25|$|In micro{{economic}}s, {{supply and}} demand is an economic model of price determination in a market. It postulates that in a competitive market, the unit price for a particular good, or other traded item such as labor or liquid financial assets, will vary until it settles {{at a point where}} the quantity demanded (at the current <b>price)</b> <b>will</b> equal the quantity supplied (at the current price), resulting in an economic equilibrium for price and quantity transacted.|$|E

25|$|If {{the demand}} decreases, then the {{opposite}} happens: {{a shift of}} the curve to the left. If the demand starts at D2, and decreases to D1, the equilibrium <b>price</b> <b>will</b> decrease, and the equilibrium quantity will also decrease. The quantity supplied at each price {{is the same as}} before the demand shift, reflecting the fact that the supply curve has not shifted; but the equilibrium quantity and price are different {{as a result of the}} change (shift) in demand.|$|E

25|$|The {{principle}} {{of supply and}} demand holds that as hydrocarbon supplies diminish, <b>prices</b> <b>will</b> rise.

25|$|The first {{criticism}} is that, following Say's {{law and the}} related circle of ideas, if demand slackens, prices will fall (barring government intervention), and the resulting lower <b>price</b> <b>will</b> stimulate demand (though at lower profit or cost – possibly even lower wages). This criticism in turn has been questioned by New Keynesian economists, who reject Say's law and instead point to evidence of sticky prices as a reason why prices do not fall in recession; this remains a debated point.|$|E

25|$|The primary {{effect of}} {{increased}} French competition {{was that the}} English raised the prices they paid to the Aboriginals to harvest fur. The result of this was greater incentive for Aboriginals to increase harvests. Increased <b>price</b> <b>will</b> lead to a gap between demand and supply and to a higher equilibrium in terms of supply. Data from the trading posts show that the supply of beavers from the Aboriginals was price-elastic and therefore traders responded with increased harvests as prices rose. The harvests were further increased {{due to the fact}} that no tribe had an absolute monopoly near any trade and most of them were competing against each other to derive the maximum benefit from the presence of the English and the French.|$|E
25|$|Raising {{the price}} of carbon will achieve four goals. First, it will provide signals to {{consumers}} about what goods and services are high-carbon ones and should therefore be used more sparingly. Second, it will provide signals to producers about which inputs use more carbon (such as coal and oil) and which use less or none (such as natural gas or nuclear power), thereby inducing firms to substitute low-carbon inputs. Third, it will give market incentives for inventors and innovators to develop and introduce low-carbon products and processes that can replace {{the current generation of}} technologies. Fourth, and most important, a high carbon <b>price</b> <b>will</b> economize on the information that is required to do all three of these tasks. Through the market mechanism, a high carbon <b>price</b> <b>will</b> raise {{the price of}} products according to their carbon content. Ethical consumers today, hoping to minimize their “carbon footprint,” have little chance of making an accurate calculation of the relative carbon use in, say, driving 250 miles as compared with flying 250 miles. A harmonized carbon tax would raise the price of a good proportionately to exactly the amount of CO2 that is emitted in all the stages of production that are involved in producing that good. If 0.01 of a ton of carbon emissions results from the wheat growing and the milling and the trucking and the baking of a loaf of bread, then a tax of $30 per ton carbon will raise the price of bread by $0.30. The “carbon footprint” is automatically calculated by the price system. Consumers would still not know how much of the price is due to carbon emissions, but they could make their decisions confident that they are paying for the social cost of their carbon footprint.|$|E
