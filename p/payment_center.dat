One method used to cause payment posting delays was to was to have customers submit payments by mail to a more distant <b>payment</b> <b>center</b> (such as having Ohio customers send their payments to a Arizona address instead of an address in Ohio or even Illinois) or intentionally understaff select payment centers so that it was not possible to process payments very quickly.|$|E

40|$|Screening for {{cervical}} cancer (CC) {{has been an}} important part of prevention strategies in Latvia since the early 1960 s, reducing its incidence from 31. 7 / 100, 000 women in 1963 to 8. 9 / 100, 000 in 1989. Political and socioeconomic changes after 1991 greatly affected the entire healthcare system, including CC screening, which was temporarily suspended. In 2005, CC screening targeting all women 25 to 69 years old was officially reintroduced in Latvia, with revision in 2007. However, the nature of the screening program remained opportunistic. The inactivity of women, lack of availability of the required services, overloaded general practitioners, and lack of involvement of gynecologists and obstetricians resulted in low coverage of the target population (10 % in 20052006). Organized screening was finally implemented in Latvia in 2009. Currently, the national Health <b>Payment</b> <b>Center</b> is responsible for inviting women for screening. Cytological smears, principally performed in a 3 -year interval, are read by cytopathologists and cytotechnologists at 25 government-based and private laboratories. Cytological testing outside the program is still very frequent and performed on an ongoing basis in parallel with the organized screening. The results of the first round of screening (20092011) show encouraging trends, with a stepwise increase in positive responses to the invitation letter, an increase in coverage inside the program, and increasing detection of cervical high-grade lesions and carcinoma in situ. Unfortunately there is still no cytology quality control monitoring in place, and there are no clear recommendations for human papillomavirus (HPV) testing. Because HPV testing is not reimbursed, it is rarely performed...|$|E

The former director of the <b>Payment</b> Cards <b>Center,</b> Peter Burns, who is acting as a senior payments advisor to HPS, also joined the discussion to outline Heartland's post-breach efforts aimed at improving information sharing and data security within the consumer payments industry. In conclusion, Carr introduced several technology solutions that are under discussion in payment security circles as ways to better secure payment card data as they move among the different parties in the card payment systems: end-to-end encryption, tokenization, and chip technology. While HPS has been very supportive of end-to-end encryption, each of these alternatives offers its own set of advantages and disadvantages.

40|$|On December 14, 2001, the <b>Payment</b> Cards <b>Center</b> of the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia held a {{workshop}} exploring retail credit risk modeling practices and evolving techniques. The workshop {{was led by}} Paul Calem, a senior economist at the Board of Governors, Division of Research and Statistics. Calem is currently involved in the Board's efforts supporting reforms to the international Basel Capital Accord intended to refine risk-based bank capital standards. Existing credit risk modeling practices in the banking industry are being evaluated by the international regulatory community {{in the context of}} developing an internal ratings-based (IRB) approach to capital requirements. While the broader effort encompasses both wholesale and retail lending, Calem's comments and the workshop discussion focused specifically on the retail sector.
