5|$|<b>Pipe</b> <b>Dream</b> is {{the seventh}} musical {{by the team}} of Richard Rodgers and Oscar Hammerstein II; it premiered on Broadway on November 30, 1955. The work is based on John Steinbeck's short novel Sweet Thursday—Steinbeck wrote the novel, a sequel to Cannery Row, {{in the hope of}} having it adapted into a musical. Set in Monterey, California, the musical {{tells the story of the}} romance between Doc, a marine biologist, and Suzy, who in the novel is a prostitute; her {{profession}} is only alluded to in the stage work. <b>Pipe</b> <b>Dream</b> was a flop and a financial disaster for Rodgers and Hammerstein.|$|E
5|$|Star Trek: Voyager – Elite Force is a first-person shooter {{video game}} {{developed}} by Raven Software {{and published by}} Activision. The game was initially released on September 20, 2000 for Windows and Mac OS personal computers. Aspyr Media was responsible for porting the game to the Mac OS platform. Elite Force was later ported to the PlayStation 2 console by <b>Pipe</b> <b>Dream</b> Interactive and published by Majesco Entertainment on December 11, 2001.|$|E
40|$|<b>Pipe</b> <b>dreams</b> {{represent}} permutations pictorially as {{a series}} of crossing pipes. Re-cent applications of <b>pipe</b> <b>dreams</b> include the calculation of Schubert polynomials, fillings of moon polyominoes, and in the combinatorics of antidiagonal simplicial complexes. These applications associate <b>pipe</b> <b>dreams</b> to words of elementary sym-metric transpositions via a canonical mapping. However, this canonical mapping {{is by no means the}} only way of mapping <b>pipe</b> <b>dreams</b> to permutation words. We define sensical mappings from <b>pipe</b> <b>dreams</b> to words and prove sensical mappings are in bijection with standard shifted tableaux of triangular shape. We characterize the set of <b>pipe</b> <b>dreams</b> associated to a given word (under any sensical map) using step ladder moves. These moves induce a partial order on the set of <b>pipe</b> <b>dreams</b> mapping to a given word, yielding a distributive lattice. ...|$|R
40|$|Weighted {{enumeration}} {{of reduced}} <b>pipe</b> <b>dreams</b> (or rc-graphs) {{results in a}} combinatorial expression for Schubert polynomials. The duality between the set of reduced <b>pipe</b> <b>dreams</b> and certain antidiagonals has important geometric implications [A. Knutson and E. Miller, Gröbner geometry of Schubert polynomials, Ann. Math. 161, 1245 - 1318]. The original proof of the duality was roundabout, relying on the algebra of certain monomial ideals and a recursive characterization of reduced <b>pipe</b> <b>dreams.</b> This paper provides a direct combinatorial proof.

5|$|The {{development}} of a PlayStation 2 version of Elite Force was announced in late 2000. Whereas the original version of Elite Force had been published by Activision and developed by Raven Software, the PlayStation 2 version was published by Majesco Entertainment and developed by their in-house studio, <b>Pipe</b> <b>Dream</b> Interactive. Elite Force {{was to be the}} second PlayStation 2 project undertaken by Majesco. The PlayStation 2 version of the game includes most of the same content as the computer version of the game, albeit that the game's graphics were simplified slightly for the console. Due to the lack of online support for the PlayStation 2, the port only allows for four players to compete in a multiplayer game. <b>Pipe</b> <b>Dream</b> paid particular attention to adjusting the controls of the game to suit the PlayStation 2's gamepad, introducing an auto-aim feature to assist the player. The first screenshots of the game were released in March 2001, and the game was released on December 11, 2001.|$|E
5|$|As {{the show}} progressed through tryouts, Hammerstein {{repeatedly}} revised it, obscuring Suzy's profession {{and the nature}} of Fauna's house. <b>Pipe</b> <b>Dream</b> met with poor reviews, and rapidly closed once it exhausted its advance sale. It had no national tour or London production, and has rarely been presented since. No movie version of the show was made; the Rodgers & Hammerstein Organization (which licenses their works) once hoped for a film version featuring the Muppets with Fauna played by Miss Piggy.|$|E

Tyler took a three-month {{leave of absence from}} Howdy Doody to shoot the movie. Tyler and her husband were both killed in a car crash on July 3, days after production of the movie was completed and before the movie premiered. Presley was so devastated over her untimely death that he refused to watch the film.|$|E

5|$|When rehearsals {{opened in}} September 1955, Rodgers {{assembled}} {{the cast and}} told them that he was going into the hospital for a minor operation. In fact, Rodgers had been diagnosed with cancer of the jawbone. He spent the weekend before the operation writing one final song for <b>Pipe</b> <b>Dream.</b> The surgery required removal of part of the jawbone and tongue, and some of the lymph nodes. The operation took place on September 21, 1955; within ten days of the operation he was back in the theatre watching rehearsals, though for some time only as a spectator.|$|E
5|$|Cannery Row {{is set in}} Monterey, California, before World War II. In Sweet Thursday, Doc {{returns from}} the war to find Cannery Row almost deserted {{and many of his}} {{colorful}} friends gone. Even his close friend Dora, who ran the Bear Flag Restaurant, a whorehouse, has died, and her sister Fauna has taken her place as madam. A former social worker, Fauna teaches the girls how to set a table properly, hopeful they will marry wealthy men. Doc's friends Mack (Mac in <b>Pipe</b> <b>Dream)</b> and Hazel (both men) are still around. They decide Doc's discontent is due to loneliness, and try to get him together with Suzy, a prostitute who has just arrived in Monterey. The two have a brief romance; disgusted by her life as a hooker, Suzy leaves the bawdy house and moves into an abandoned boiler. She decides she cannot stay with Doc, but tells her friends that if Doc fell ill, she would care for him. The accommodating Hazel promptly breaks Doc's arm as he sleeps, bringing the two lovers back together. At the end, Doc and Suzy go off to La Jolla to collect marine specimens together.|$|E

500|$|The musical {{received}} {{moderate to}} poor reviews. Brooks Atkinson of The New York Times termed it [...] "a pleasant, lazy romance... Mr. Rodgers and Mr. Hammerstein {{in a minor}} key". John Chapman of the Daily News stated, [...] "Perhaps Hammerstein and Rodgers are too gentlemanly {{to be dealing with}} Steinbeck's sleazy and raffish denizens." [...] Walter Kerr of the Herald Tribune suggested, [...] "Someone seems to have forgotten to bring along that gallon of good, red wine." [...] John McClain of the Journal-American stated, [...] "This {{is a far cry from}} the exalted talents of the team that produced South Pacific. They must be human, after all." [...] Steven Suskin, in his book chronicling Broadway opening night reviews, stated that <b>Pipe</b> <b>Dream</b> received one favorable review from the seven major New York critics, two mixed, and four unfavorable. Louis Kronenberger, in Time magazine, summed it up as [...] "roficient, professional, and disappointing."

500|$|The poor {{reviews of}} <b>Pipe</b> <b>Dream</b> made a {{national}} tour or London run impractical. Subsequent productions {{have been extremely}} rare. In 1981, a community theatre production of <b>Pipe</b> <b>Dream</b> was presented by the Conejo Players Theatre in Thousand Oaks, California. Los Angeles Times critic Dan Sullivan admired the small-scale staging, but called the show [...] "the emptiest musical that two geniuses ever wrote" [...] and said of it, [...] "imagine a song [...] about a bawdyhouse which describes the goings-on there after midnight as 'friendly, foolish and gay'". In 1995 and 2002, 42nd Street Moon presented it as a staged concert. It was presented in March–April 2012 by New York City Center Encores!, also as a staged concert; the cast featured Will Chase (Doc), Laura Osnes (Suzy), Leslie Uggams (Fauna), Stephen Wallem (Hazel) and Tom Wopat (Mac). [...] In July and August 2013 it was presented by London's small Union Theatre, directed by Sasha Regan. No film version was contemplated in the authors' lifetimes. The Rodgers & Hammerstein Organization, which licenses the pair's works, proposed a film version with the Muppets. Humans would play Doc and Suzy; Muppets would play the other roles—with Miss Piggy as Fauna.|$|E
500|$|In another memo, Steinbeck {{noted that}} the pathos of Suzy being a prostitute had given much of the {{dramatic}} tension to the scene in which Doc rejects Suzy, and later, her rejection of him. [...] "I think if you will finally bring {{the theme of this}} play into the open, but wide open, you will have solved its great weakness and have raised it to a high level... If this is not done, I can neither believe nor take <b>Pipe</b> <b>Dream</b> seriously." ...|$|E
500|$|Rodgers and Hammerstein, despite {{extraordinary}} early successes, such as Oklahoma!, Carousel and South Pacific, {{had suffered}} back-to-back Broadway flops {{in the mid-1950s}} with Me and Juliet and <b>Pipe</b> <b>Dream.</b> [...] While Oklahoma! had broken new ground in 1943, any new project in the late 1950s would {{have to compete with}} modern musicals and techniques, like the brutal realism in West Side Story, and with other Broadway musical hits such as The Music Man, My Fair Lady and The Pajama Game. [...] Rodgers and Hammerstein had made it their rule to begin work on their next musical as soon as the last opened on Broadway, but by the start of 1957, six months after <b>Pipe</b> <b>Dream</b> closed, the pair had no new stage musical in prospect. [...] They had, however, been working since 1956 on the popular television version of Cinderella, which was broadcast on CBS on March 31, 1957. [...] Rodgers was still recovering from an operation for cancer in a tooth socket, and he was drinking heavily and suffering from depression. [...] In June 1957, Rodgers checked himself into Payne Whitney Psychiatric Clinic, and he remained there for twelve weeks. [...] According to his daughters, Mary and Linda, this did not put a stop to his drinking.|$|E
