5|$|In the 4th {{inning of}} the 2015 All Star Game, 2014 World Series MVP Madison Bumgarner pitched to future 2015 World Series MVP Salvador Pérez, who struck out but reached first {{due to a}} passed ball. This {{was the first time}} the {{previous}} year's MVP faced the current year's future MVP in the All Star Game. Bumgarner and Pérez also faced each other in the final play of the 2014 World Series: Pérez <b>popped</b> <b>out.</b>|$|E
5|$|In 1924, Goebel {{was again}} {{selected}} as an All-Pro {{player with the}} Tigers, playing in ten games, making two touchdown receptions, and returning a fumble for a touchdown. In all, he was credited with three touchdowns and 18 points in 1924. While playing end for the Columbus Tigers in 1924, Goebel was involved {{in one of the}} oddest plays in NFL history. Goebel was the intended receiver of a forward pass, but the ball <b>popped</b> <b>out</b> of his arms and was snatched out of the air by Oscar Knop of the Chicago Bears. Knop began running for the goal line with the ball, but he was running the wrong way toward a safety. After running 30 yards, Knop was caught from behind and tackled by his teammate Ed Healey on the four-yard line.|$|E
5|$|Before the 1927 season, Paschal {{returned}} his playing contract unsigned {{because of a}} salary dispute. By that time, the Yankees were forming the nucleus of what became the Murderers' Row teams of the late 1920s. He signed for an estimated $8,000 ($ today), a 13% raise. In the season-opening win against the Athletics, right field starter Babe Ruth struck out twice and <b>popped</b> <b>out,</b> forcing Huggins to replace him with Paschal in the sixth inning. As the last man ever to pinch-hit for Ruth, Paschal singled. In one of his few starts of the 1927 season, Paschal was a single short of hitting for the cycle, and almost had three home runs. Replacing the injured Bob Meusel, Paschal hit two home runs, a triple that was yards shy of a home run, and a double which bounced off the right field stands during an 11–2 rout of the Indians. Paschal did not play in the Yankees' 1927 World Series victory over the Pittsburgh Pirates. Overall, he played in 50 games, primarily as a pinch hitter. After the season, Paschal was discussed as a trade for Boston Red Sox pitcher Red Ruffing, but discussions fell apart (Ruffing was later acquired in a proposed trade during the 1930 season).|$|E

40|$|A single, unique target often <b>pops</b> <b>out</b> {{quickly and}} {{efficiently}} from a field of homogenous distractors in visual search. <b>Pop</b> <b>out</b> has helped shape theories of visual attention and feature integration {{as well as to}} identify basic features in human vision. The present experiments demonstrate a new phenomenon, false <b>pop</b> <b>out,</b> wherein one of the homogenous distractors competes with the singleton target to <b>pop</b> <b>out,</b> perhaps by breaking an overall grouping or pattern emerging from the display. Using a compilation of several studies, this research reports the effect in a number of display contexts using a number of different stimuli, and provides converging evidence toward the idea that low and high level features contribute equally to the primary perceptual experience, a counterintuitive finding for most current theories of visual search...|$|R
5|$|The {{rivalry between}} Yokozuna and The Undertaker began at Survivor Series 1993. Yokozuna, who was pushed as an unstoppable monster, {{was unable to}} inflict any serious damage on The Undertaker when the two faced each other in an {{elimination}} match. Yokozuna slammed The Undertaker's head into the steel steps {{leading up to the}} ring, but The Undertaker was unharmed. Later, Yokozuna used his finishing move, the Banzai Drop, on The Undertaker. When he tried to repeat the move, however, The Undertaker became the first wrestler to sit up after the move, surprising Yokozuna and his managers. The Undertaker was granted a title shot, but Jim Cornette, Yokozuna's American spokesperson, included a clause in the contract that The Undertaker would not get a rematch if he lost. Paul Bearer, The Undertaker's manager, included a clause stating that the confrontation would take place in a Casket match. In the following weeks, it was revealed that Yokozuna had a fear of caskets. The Undertaker used this knowledge to gain a psychological advantage going into the match. On one occasion, Paul Bearer brought the casket to the ring to intimidate Yokozuna. When Yokozuna approached the casket to face his fear, the Undertaker <b>popped</b> <b>out</b> to scare Yokozuna.|$|E

A David Eckstein single followed by a Preston Wilson walk in the bottom of the seventh put runners at first and second with none out for the heart of the Cardinals order: Pujols, Edmonds, and Rolen. Pujols <b>popped</b> <b>out</b> and Edmonds flied out, so it appeared Detroit might hold the Cardinals to a one-run lead. Instead, Scott Rolen singled and scored Eckstein, doubling the Cardinals lead to 4–2.|$|E

After Pedroia <b>popped</b> <b>out,</b> a balk moved Ellsbury to second before he scored on Youkilis's double. Ortiz's double and Ramirez's single scored a run each. The Red Sox loaded the bases on a double and walk before Drew's single scored another run. Ryan Speier relieved Morales and walked all three batters he faced to force in three more Boston runs. Matt Herges relieved Speier and got Youkilis to fly out to right to end the inning.|$|E

40|$|AbstractTo {{determine}} {{the nature of}} face perception, several studies used the visual search paradigm, whereby subjects detect an odd target among distractors. When detection reaction time is set-size independent, the odd element is said to “pop out”, reflecting a basic mechanism or map for the relevant feature. A number of previous studies suggested that schematic faces do not <b>pop</b> <b>out.</b> We show that natural face stimuli do <b>pop</b> <b>out</b> among assorted non-face objects. Animal faces, on the other hand, do not <b>pop</b> <b>out</b> from among the same assorted non-face objects. In addition, search for a face among distractors of another object category is easier than the reverse search, and face search is mediated by holistic face characteristics, rather than by face parts. Our {{results indicate that the}} association of <b>pop</b> <b>out</b> with elementary features and lower cortical areas may be incorrect. Instead, face search, and indeed all feature search, may reflect high-level activity with generalization over spatial and other property details...|$|R

25|$|Stengel {{kept his}} word and named Paige to the 1953 All-Star team despite Paige {{not having a}} very good year. He got in {{the game in the}} eighth inning. First, Paige got Gil Hodges to line out, then after Roy Campanella singled up the middle, Eddie Mathews <b>popped</b> <b>out.</b> He then walked Duke Snider, and Enos Slaughter lined a hit to center to score Campanella. National League pitcher Murry Dickson drove in Snider, but was thrown out at second base trying to stretch the hit into a double. Paige ended the year with a disappointing 3–9 record, but a respectable 3.53 ERA. Paige was {{released}} after the season when Veeck once again had to sell the team.|$|E
25|$|In , Martin {{had another}} major {{incident}} with Jackson and it {{eventually led to}} him losing his position. On July 17 against the Kansas City Royals, Jackson came to the plate {{in the bottom of}} the tenth inning with Thurman Munson on base and Martin put the bunt sign on. After Jackson fouled the first pitch off, the sign was taken off and Jackson was given the sign to swing away. Jackson bunted again, and then on the third pitch he bunted again and <b>popped</b> <b>out.</b> A furious Martin demanded Jackson be suspended for the remainder of the season after the game, but after conversing with upper management Martin agreed on a five-game suspension. Then, when Jackson returned, he told reporters that he did not know why Martin had suspended him.|$|E
25|$|The {{associated}} problem mission managers faced was if one rib popped free, {{there would}} be increased pressure on the remaining two, and {{if one of them}} <b>popped</b> <b>out</b> the last would be under so much pressure it would never release. The second part of the problem was due to Galileo revised flight plan. The probe had never been intended to approach the Sun any closer than the orbit of Earth, but sending it to Venus would expose it to temperatures at least 50 degrees higher than at Earth distance. So the probe had to be protected from that extra heat, part of which involved adapting some of the computer functions. Forty-one device drivers had been programmed into the computer, but with no room for any more, the mission planners had to decide which driver they could use in association with the heat protection. They chose the antenna motor reverse driver.|$|E

25|$|A {{defensive}} stop on USC's next {{possession and}} a 15-yard punt return gave Texas the ball near midfield, and the Longhorns capitalized when Young found Thomas for 14yards on one play, and Taylor running 30yards {{for a touchdown}} on another. Pino's extra point extended the Longhorns' lead to 16–7. On the next drive, Leinart threw a pass intended for Reggie Bush that was grabbed by Texas linebacker/safety Drew Kelson. But Kelson landed on his back after catching the pass and the ball <b>popped</b> <b>out.</b> The pass was ruled incomplete; equipment issues again prevented a review. USC's drive continued with a Leinart pass to wide receiver Dwayne Jarrett, the top Trojan receiver of the day with ten catches totaling 121yards, a quarterback keeper of 14yards, and a Bush 12-yard run took the Trojans to the Texas 13-yard line with 40seconds {{to play in the}} half. But two sacks by defensive tackle Frank Okam pushed USC back 13yards and forced the Trojans to use two timeouts. Consequently, Danelo's 43-yard field goal allowed USC three points, and the half ended with Texas still ahead, 16–10.|$|E
25|$|Los Angeles closer Kenley Jansen came in {{to pitch}} the ninth inning, hoping to hold the score at 4-3 and give the Dodgers a chance to tie or win {{the game in the}} bottom of the inning. But Jayson Werth led off with a 450-foot (137-meter) home run into the left-field stands that quieted the crowd and gave the Nationals an {{important}} insurance run. Jansen then walked second baseman Daniel Murphy and hit Harper with a pitch and, after Rendon <b>popped</b> <b>out,</b> first baseman Ryan Zimmerman doubled off the right field wall, scoring both Murphy and Harper and knocking Jansen out of the game. By the time Washington pinch hitter Chris Heisey came to bat with a 7-3 lead, many Dodger fans were leaving the stadium; Heisey capped the inning by scoring Zimmerman with a sacrifice fly to make the score 8-3. Nationals closer Mark Melancon then pitched a perfect ninth to seal the victory, completing 4⅔ scoreless innings by the Nationals′ bullpen; in the series thus far, Nationals relievers had pitched 12⅓ innings without yielding a single run, striking out 14 Dodgers.|$|E
25|$|Kershaw pitched five {{innings and}} {{held on to the}} lead, but the Nationals {{repeatedly}} pushed him to the brink, and his frequent discussions on the mound with Dodgers catcher Yasmani Grandal incited a chorus of boos from the crowd. In the second inning, with two Nationals on base after Daniel Murphy and Ryan Zimmerman singled and Anthony Rendon reached first on a fielder's choice, Danny Espinosa – batting seventh instead of a probable eighth due to Ramos′s unavailability – struck out for the second out. A Dodgers error then allowed Severino to reach first base and load the bases, but Scherzer <b>popped</b> <b>out</b> to end the inning without the Nationals scoring a run. In the third inning, Rendon singled to drive in two runs as part of what promised to be a big inning, cutting the Dodgers′ lead to 4-2, but Espinosa struck out to end the inning with two men on base. Severino doubled in the fourth and scored on a sacrifice fly by Trea Turner to reduce the Dodgers′ lead to 4–3, but in the fifth, with Jayson Werth and Rendon on base, Espinosa again struck out to end the inning. Although he provided his typically reliable defense in the field during the game, Espinosa′s strikeouts had left six men on base and brought three rallies to an end.|$|E

25|$|This was {{the first}} World Series game ever played in Colorado. At 4 hours 19 minutes, it became the longest nine-inning game in World Series history until game five of 2017. Game3 was also the 600th World Series game ever played. Starting pitcher Daisuke Matsuzaka pitched five innings of {{scoreless}} ball and left in the sixth with no runs allowed. The Red Sox struck first with a six-run third inning. Rookie Jacoby Ellsbury hit a leadoff double, moved to third on Dustin Pedroia's single, and scored on David Ortiz's double. After Manny Ramirez was intentionally walked, Mike Lowell's single scored two more runs. J. D. Drew <b>popped</b> <b>out</b> before Ramirez was thrown out at home on Jason Varitek's single with Lowell advancing to third. After Julio Lugo walked to load the bases, Matsuzaka hit a two-run single for his first base hit and RBI in the Major Leagues. Ellsbury capped the scoring with his second double of the inning and knock Colorado starter Josh Fogg out of the game. The Rockies' bats came {{to life in the}} sixth and seventh innings against a normally solid but shaky Boston bullpen. After Matsuzaka walked two straight in the sixth with one out, reliever Javier López allowed back-to-back RBI singles to Brad Hawpe and Yorvit Torrealba. Mike Timlin allowed two straight leadoff singles in the seventh before NLCS MVP Matt Holliday brought the Rockies to within one run with a three-run home run off Hideki Okajima. Brian Fuentes gave back those runs in the eighth by walking Lugo with one out and allowing a subsequent single to Coco Crisp before Ellsbury and Dustin Pedroia, who had four and three hits, respectively, on the night (the first time in World Series history two rookies had at least three hits in a game) hit back-to-back RBI doubles, raising Boston's lead to 9–5. Jonathan Papelbon came on for a four-out save, getting Holliday to fly out on one pitch, leaving runners on first and second. Jason Varitek would tack on Boston's tenth run {{in the top of the}} ninth off of LaTroy Hawkins with a sacrifice fly, scoring Mike Lowell who, not generally considered a stolen base threat, had just stolen third base, the first time a Red Sox baserunner stole third base in the World Series since 1975, after hitting a leadoff single and moving to second on a sacrifice bunt. Papelbon came back out in the bottom of the ninth to complete the save, getting the first two outs before surrendering a two-out triple to Brad Hawpe, then finishing the game with a groundout from Yorvit Torrealba. The Red Sox took Game3 by a final score of 10–5.|$|E

Upon sliding into third, Mueller sprained his ankle and had to leave the game. As Mueller went to the locker room, Dodger manager Chuck Dressen summoned game 1 starter Ralph Branca in to relieve Newcombe on only one day's rest. Bobby Thomson came up to bat, and on Branca's second pitch, Thomson drove the ball to deep left field for a walk-off home run to clinch the pennant for the Giants. This home run came to be known as the [...] "Shot Heard 'Round the World" [...] as the Giants won the National League pennant, advancing to the World Series.|$|E
