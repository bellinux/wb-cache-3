A modest enhancement of ~ 3 % in the detected counts was measured for point sources far from the horizontal shift register (at Y= 800) for the preflash exposure.

The calibration lamp was used to <b>preflash</b> the wide field CCDs to about 2000 counts, and the <b>preflash</b> was read out {{before the start of}} the science observations.

5000|$|A-TTL is an initialism {{that stands}} for Advanced-Through The Lens flash metering. As with {{ordinary}} TTL flash exposure systems, a sensor inside the camera reads {{the amount of}} light being reflected off the film during the exposure. When the sensor determines that the exposure is sufficient, it terminates the flash pulse. A-TTL, first seen on the T90 (which predates the EOS family), is a flash exposure system that adds a brief <b>preflash</b> during exposure metering when the camera is in the programmed exposure (P) mode. The amount of light returned from this <b>preflash</b> is used to determine an appropriate tradeoff between aperture and shutter speed in P mode. Depending on the specific flash unit {{and whether or not}} it is set to bounce, the <b>preflash</b> might be infrared or it might be the normal white flash. In an A-TTL system the sensor that reads the <b>preflash</b> return is located on the flash unit; this caused some issues especially when using filters as the filter would cover the lens (but not the sensor outside the lens) thus causing inaccurate settings. Some early Canon EOS cameras also used the A-TTL <b>preflash</b> in non-programmed exposure modes to detect [...] "out of range" [...] conditions; the [...] "out of range" [...] warning feature was dropped on later models, reportedly due to patent conflicts.|$|R
40|$|An {{analysis}} of WFPC 2 observations of Omega Cen and NGC 2419 {{leads to the}} following results. 1. The correction formula developed by Whitmore, Heyer, and Casertano (1999; hereafter WHC 99) does a reasonable job of correcting for CTE loss down to extremely low count levels (i. e., so faint you cannot actually see the object but only know of its existence from longer exposures). There is no sharp cutoff to the detection threshold for very faint stars. 2. A comparison of the WHC 99 formula with the Dolphin (2000 b; hereafter D 00) formula shows reasonable agreement for bright and moderately bright stars, with the D 00 formula giving better results. However, at very faint levels, the D 00 formula overestimates, and the WHC 99 formula underestimates, the correction by tens of percent. Our current recommendation {{is to use the}} D 00 formula for CTE loss correction. 3. A reexamination of the long-vs-short nonlinearity shows that the effect is very small (a few percent) or nonexistent for uncrowded fields, with less than ~ 1000 stars per chip. However, for crowded fields, with ~ 10, 000 stars per chip, apparent nonlinearities of tens of percent are possible. The most likely explanation is that this is due to an overestimate of the sky measurement in the short exposure, which is probably due to the presence of scattered light around bright stars and the subsequent improvement in CTE loss in these regions. No correction formula has been derived in the current study since the effect is dependent on the analysis parameters (aperture size) and probably also on the photometry package (psf-fitting, aperture photometry, [...] .). 4. <b>Preflashing</b> may be a useful method of reducing the effects of CTE loss for certain observations (moderately bright objects on very faint backgrounds), but the effects o...|$|E
40|$|Photographic {{processing}} and lithographic printing reproduction {{are two different}} processes. In photography, the transparency reproduces the original scene in continuous tone. Whereas, in lithographic printing, the reproduction {{is a result of}} an all-or-nothing process. A transparency may have a tonal range that exceeds the range that can be reproduced in lithographic printing. So tone compression is performed on transparencies that exceed the tonal range for printing. Avoiding tone compression during lithographic production results in considerable savings in cost and time. One of the methods to reduce tonal range is for the photographer to understand the relationship between emulsion flashing and the tonal range of transparencies. Flashing is the process of projecting nonimage white light to the film emulsion either before or after exposure, but prior to processing. This study investigated the relationship between flashing and exposure for a transparency which would reduce its tonal range and make it suitable for printing. The hypotheses under investigation were: (1) it is possible to flash Ektachrome transparency film by a predetermined amount of light to produce a desired reduction in the tonal range of a transparency, making it more acceptable to the printing range of lithographic printing when using coated paper; (2) the post-flashing technique produces the most acceptable result in achieving the desired tonal range as compared to the pre-flashing technique; (3) the flashing technique produces the same result in a transparency as the image prepared by the use of adjusting the lighting ratio in measured photography. An experimental investigation was conducted. A setup consisting of standard scales was photographed at various exposures and different degrees of flashing. The photography was performed using a 4 X 5 camera. The setup was illuminated at 45 angles by means of two strobe lights. Exposure was controlled by altering the aperture opening of the lens or fstop. The degree of flashing was determined by pre-exposing or post-exposing the Ektachrome transparency film emulsion to non-image white light through sheets of parchment paper placed at a distance of three inches from the camera lens. The amount of light that could reach the lens during flashing was controlled by varying the number of sheets of parchment paper. Thirty-two transparencies were photographed. The transparencies were processed by E- 6 process. The tonal ranges of the transparencies were measured by means of a transmission densitometer. A visual test was conducted to determine the visual appeal of the transparencies by professionals in the field of photography and printing. The outcome of the experimental investigation showed that the tonal range of a transparency is reduced when the film emulsion is flashed. The results suggest that <b>preflashing</b> by an amount of a little over one-third of the light required for normal exposure and then exposing the film to the subject or setup at one and a half stop below the normal exposure produces transparencies that have a tonal range within the limits of lithographic printing and that are visually appealing. It was also shown that pre-flashing the film had a greater effect on reducing the tonal range than post-flashing. Moreover, the flashing technique was compared with methods used to reduce the tonal range by adjusting the lighting ratio. Based on these results, the first hypothesis was confirmed, the second was rejected, and the third was qualitatively accepte...|$|E

40|$|Pre-heat trains {{differ from}} most other heat {{recovery}} networks {{in a number}} of important ways. Combination of factors gives rise to the need for a design procedure specific to pre-heat trains. Outlining these factors, we first observe that one cold stream (the incoming crude) dominates the heat demand. We next observe that the heat recovery comes from streams a number of streams having similar temperature spans. Looking at typical Composite Curves (Figure 1) we observe that rather than the presence of a distinct and clear 'pinch point', the curves are close together over quite a large temperature region. Consideration of the process leads to the observation that the heating is undertaking in three distinct stages: storage to desalter, desalter to <b>preflash</b> and <b>preflash</b> to column. The operating temperature of both desalter and <b>preflash</b> can only be varied over a relatively small temperature span. Finally, we see that fouling is an important consideration. At the hot end of the train, this fouling is affected by velocity and by exchanger wall temperature. Consideration of fouling must be incorporated into the design procedure...|$|R

We aimed at verifying this hypothesis by recording saturated photosignals in the rat retina after single and double {{flashes of light}} and determining the time tc {{to the beginning of}} the signal recovery. The time course of Cai after a flash was calculated from a change of the spatial Ca 2 + concentration profile recorded in the space between the rods. After single flashes tc increased linearly with the logarithm of flash intensity, confirming the assumption that tc is determined by deactivation of a single species X* in the phototransduction cascade. The photoresponse was shortened up to 45 % if the test flash was preceded by a conditioning <b>preflash.</b> The shortening depended on the reduction of Cai induced by the <b>preflash.</b> The data suggest that the phototransduction gain determining the amount of activated X* is regulated by a Cai-dependent mechanism in a short time period (< 800 ms) after the test flash. Lowering of Cai by a <b>preflash</b> reduced the gain up to 20 % compared to its value in a dark-adapted rod.

Writing time for a 10 x 10 arcmin plate is a few minutes and the whole procedure can be performed promptly after the acquisition of the field image and without mechanical debris as in milling or laser cutting. A computer controlled writing device suited for the AFOSC camera of the Asiago 1. 8 m telescope was built. The same focal plane mask can be UV erased and used more than 450 times. High contrasts have been reached by means of an appropriate passband filter in the light beam of the spectrograph. Our first successful observation run took place in January 2003. Spectra of selected stars in the crowded M 67 cluster field and emission lines from the gaseous planetary nebula M 97 were obtained...|$|R
40|$|The {{concept of}} a binary power cycle {{utilizing}} direct contact heat exchangers was first proposed by Jacobs and Boehm in 1973 for use with geothermal brines. This concept was proposed primarily to overcome difficulties associated with the fouling and scaling nature of many moderate temperature brines. However, thermodynamic analyses and subsequent economic analyses clearly pointed to possible economic advantages over conventional binary cycles even with non-fouling, non-scaling brines. For a direct contact binary power plant to be economically attractive {{it is necessary that}} a small pinch point be obtainable so that a maximum amount of power can be obtained per unit mass flow of geothermal brine. Since the working fluid comes in direct contact with the brine it must be immiscible with the brine, low in cost and, if part of it goes into solution in the brine, easily recoverable. In addition, noncondensible gases from the brine must be controlled to limit their effect on condenser pressure. The 500 kWe DCHX test facility installed at East Mesa was designed to evaluate techniques to provide economical operation. The choice of the East Mesa test site as a first location to evaluate the DCHX system placed additional requirements on the system. The brine at East Mesa was at low pressure, requiring the use of downhole pumps. The selection of isobutane as a working fluid required increasing the pressure of the brine. The high amount of dissolved CO{sub 2 } in the brine required that it be <b>preflashed</b> to prevent the carryover of CO{sub 2 } gas through the turbine and into the condenser which would adversely affect the system performance. All of these problems have been met by the system designer and operator, Barber-Nichols Engineering. Further, problems with isobutane turbine design, supposed state-of-the-art, were encountered and resolved...|$|R
40|$|This work {{is divided}} in two {{principal}} sections. The first concerns {{the application of}} more convenient structures to intensive energy consuming plants built before the energy crisis. Two case studies are considered. The first regards {{the implementation of a}} <b>preflash</b> device (drum or column) on a crude distillation unit. The limitations of both apparatuses are considered together with the energy saving realized. Particular emphasis is given to the evaluation of the best structure that matches the scope in the energy plant reduction and the respect of the production specifications. The second case considered regards a light ends distillation plant. Different separation sequences derived from the plant configuration are considered. The possibility to reach a reduction of the energy consumption is considered together with the maximum reusage of the plant apparatus, that allows to minimize the capital cost investment. The total annual cost is associated to the required heat exchanger area for the condensers and the reboilers and to the column section diameter. The best solution, that satisfy the scope of the retrofit work minimizing {{at the same time the}} employing of new equipment and the energy consumption, is then identified. In the second section of the work the column sequence design is considered. The starting point was the separation of a four components mixture considered with five different feed compositions. All the possible simple column sequences were first analyzed using different sets of heuristic rules and after with more rigorous evaluation. The different solutions are compared to put in evidence the limitations of the heuristic rules, which anyway remain a good tool for a first screening of the most promising structures. The best distillation sequence for each feed composition case is also considered for the implementation of a divided wall column to perform a three component separation. The resulting “hybrid” sequences are made by a simple column that follows or precedes a divided wall column. This type of column was modeled using the modified Underwood-Fenske-Gilliland method to obtain the first design parameters to be utilized as the input to a more rigorous simulation performed with the Aspen Plus simulation package. The different hybrid configurations are then compared with respect to the best simple column structures from which are derived. In the last part of the work a new method to map the space of distillation columns with less than n- 1 columns is proposed. Up to now this configuration space was never predicted in a systematic way and only heuristic rules are available to predict only a few of all the possible configurations. Including more distillation column configurations in the research space increases the possibility to identify the sequence that satisfies the research scope. The generation method is presented for a four components mixture but is absolutely general and can be applied for any number of components. ...|$|R
