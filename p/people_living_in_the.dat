5|$|The Yaghnobi <b>people</b> <b>living</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Sughd {{province}} of Tajikistan still speak a dialect of the Sogdian language.

The great majority of the Sogdian people assimilated with other local groups such as the Bactrians, Chorasmians, and in particular with Persians and came to speak Persian. In 819 the Persians founded the Samanid Empire in the region. They are among the ancestors of the modern Tajiks. Numerous Sogdian cognates {{can be found in the}} modern Tajik language, although the latter is a Western Iranian language.|$|E
5|$|The {{accident}} {{had a large}} {{impact on}} the community, with only 1,600 <b>people</b> <b>living</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> two Russian settlements.

Issues were further complicated by erroneous reports in Russian media that there were five survivors. The Governor's cabin in Barentsburg was manned during the aftermath, and bulletins were distributed with updated information in Russian. The accident was one of the triggers causing Arktikugol to abandon Pyramiden in 1998.|$|E

5|$|The first fortifications in Malta {{were built}} during the Bronze Age. At least six sites have been {{identified}} as possible fortified settlements. The best preserved of these is the village of Borġ in-Nadur, close to the modern town of Birżebbuġa. Around 1450 BC, the inhabitants of the village built a 4.5m high D-shaped bastion to bar access to their village. The wall was built facing inland, showing that the <b>people</b> <b>living</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> village were more afraid of attacks from the land than from the sea.|$|E

Abkhaz defence official said that Georgian forces were pushed out of the Kodori Gorge by the operation. Although he claimed that Russians {{did not participate in}} the battle, Russian military traffic headed for the gorge was witnessed by an Associated Press reporter. Casualties were light on both sides; Abkhaz fighters accidentally killed one of their comrades, and two Georgian soldiers were also killed.

5|$|As the {{population}} expanded, {{some of these}} settlements were sub-divided to create new hamlets and more marginal land was again settled, with sheilings (clusters of huts occupied while summer pasture was being used for grazing) becoming permanent settlements. Perhaps ten per cent of {{the population}} lived {{in one of the}} burghs that had grown up in the later Medieval period, mainly in the east and south of the country. They may have had a mean population of about 2,000, and the largest, Edinburgh, probably had a population of over 10,000 {{at the beginning of the}} era, but many were much smaller than 1,000. During the seventeenth century, the number of <b>people</b> <b>living</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> capital grew rapidly. It also expanded beyond the city walls in suburbs at Cowgate, Bristo and Westport and by 1750, with its suburbs, it had reached a population of 57,000.

5|$|Many {{factors have}} {{influenced}} the construction of dams along the Snake River. A total of fifteen dams have been constructed along the Snake River for a multitude of different purposes, from its headwaters in the Rocky Mountains to its mouth on Lake Wallula, a slackwater reservoir formed behind McNary Dam on the Columbia River. Dams on the Snake can be grouped into three major categories. From its headwaters {{to the beginning of}} Hells Canyon, many small dams block the Snake to provide irrigation water. Between here and Hells Canyon, the first dam on the Snake, Swan Falls Dam, was built in 1901. In Hells Canyon, a cascade of dams produce hydroelectricity from the river's lofty decrease in elevation over a comparatively small distance. Finally, a third cascade of dams, from Hells Canyon to the mouth, facilitates navigation. Many different government and private agencies have worked to build dams on the Snake River, which now serve an important purpose for <b>people</b> <b>living</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Snake's drainage basin and trade of agricultural products to Pacific seaports.|$|E

5|$|Offshore, several oil {{and natural}} gas rigs were {{evacuated}} due to the proximity of Earl. An estimated 10,000 workers were evacuated from both onshore and offshore rigs. The storm forced many Florida residences to evacuate, especially <b>people</b> <b>living</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> barrier islands along the Florida Gulf Coast. About 30 Air Force jets from Eglin Air Force Base were sent to Oklahoma to protect them from the storm. A mandatory evacuation was issued for 20,000 residents in Leon County as well as all barrier islands along the Florida coast due to the risk of substantial flooding. Franklin County was briefly under a mandatory evacuation order on September2, the reasons for the lifting of the order are unknown. State parks along the Florida Panhandle were also closed and highways became congested with thousands of residents and tourists evacuating the barrier islands.|$|E
5|$|Some of the {{earliest}} evidence of salt processing dates to around 8,000 years ago, when <b>people</b> <b>living</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> area of present-day Romania boiled spring water to extract salts; a salt-works in China dates to approximately the same period. Salt was also prized by the ancient Hebrews, the Greeks, the Romans, the Byzantines, the Hittites, Egyptians, and the Indians. Salt became an important article of trade and was transported by boat across the Mediterranean Sea, along specially built salt roads, and across the Sahara on camel caravans. The scarcity and universal need for salt have led nations {{to go to war}} over it and use it to raise tax revenues. Salt is used in religious ceremonies and has other cultural significance.|$|E

The process of separation and differentiation of the eastern and western Baltic tribes deepened during the period of Roman influence, when the economy, culture and customs of the Western Balts became increasingly influenced by the more highly developed Przeworsk and Wielbark cultures people. From the beginning of the Common Era we can speak of the Western Balt culture, which included several distinct groups of the Western Baltic cultural circle and which definitely can be connected with the Baltic peoples.|$|E
