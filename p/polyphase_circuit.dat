The RSA consists of coarse-grained processing elements that can be configured as complex DSP functions that are the basic building blocks of Polyphase-FIR filters, phase shifters, DFTs, and Polyphase-DFT circuits. The homogeneous characteristic of the RSA architecture, where each reconfigurable processing element (PE) cell is connected to its nearest neighbors via configurable switch (SW) elements, enables array expansion for parallel processing and facilitates time sharing computation of high-throughput data by individual PEs. For DFT circuit configurations, an algorithmic optimization technique has been employed to reduce {{the overall number of}} vector-matrix products to be mapped on the RSA. The hardware complexity and throughput of the RSA-based DFT structures have been evaluated and compared against several conventional modular FFT realizations.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a new analytical technique {{for improving the}} performance prediction of single-phase induction motors, especially capacitor motors. The technique uses the split-phase motor electrical equivalent circuit analysis together with electrical and magnetic parameters whose variation is computed from the equivalent balanced polyphase motor, so that the same magnetic circuit analysis {{can be used for}} both. (The term split-phase is used to cover motors operating from a single-phase supply but with the phase windings split into two orthogonal windings, one of which may have a capacitor in series with it during running or starting.) The technique accounts for the elliptical envelope of the magnetizing field vector and results in improved precision, since the three-phase electromagnetic model is considered to be more precise than the normal split-phase motor analysis. An important result is the computation of vector polygons of flux density for each section of the magnetic circuit, providing a better basis for core loss prediction. The double-frequency torque ripple is also obtained from the stator magnetomotive force and flux-density polygons. Three different electrical equivalent circuit methods for the split-phase motor (based respectively on the cross-field theory, forward- and backward-revolving fields, and symmetrical components) are evaluated to determine the method best suited for incorporating the variation of the circuit parameters from the <b>polyphase</b> magnetic <b>circuit</b> analysis, and it is discussed how the core losses can be included in these circuits to obtain the best overall performance prediction...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: In {{this chapter}} we discuss {{flexible}} cognitive radio circuits for dynamic access of unused spectrum. Ideally, such circuits can work at an arbitrary radio frequency (RF). We review techniques to realize radios {{without resorting to}} frequency selective dedicated filters, in particular a recently proposed polyphase multipath technique canceling harmonics and sidebands [11, 12]. Using this technique, a wideband and flexible power upconverter with a clean output spectrum can be realized on a CMOS chip, aiming at flexible radio transmitter applications. Prototype chips can transmit at an arbitrary frequency between DC and 2. 4 GHz. Unwanted harmonics and sidebands are more than 40 dB lower then the desired signal up to the 17 th harmonic of the transmit frequency. Such <b>polyphase</b> multipath <b>circuits</b> need flexible multi-phase clocking with a large frequency range and low phase errors. We will compare a Shift Register (SR) to a Delay Locked Loop (DLL) for multi-phase clock generation, and motivate why a SR is not only more flexible but often also better [16]. For a given power budget, we show that a SR almost always generates less jitter than a DLL, assuming both are realized with current mode logic. This is {{due to differences in}} jitter accumulation and the possibility to choose latch delays in a SR much smaller than the delays of DLL elements. For N-phase clock generation, a SR also functions as a divide-by-N and requires a VCO with N times higher frequency. However, this does not necessarily lead to more power consumption and can even have advantages like higher Q and less area for the inductors...|$|R

The process of replacing one set of variables to another related set of variable is called winding transformation or simply transformation or linear transformation. The term linear transformation means that the transformation from old to new set of variable and vice versa is governed by linear equations.The equations relating old variables and new variables are called transformation equation and the following general form: Variable = matrixvariable Variable = matrixvariableTransformation matrix is a matrix containing the coefficients that relates new and old variables. Note that the second transformation matrix in the above-mentioned general form is inverse of first transformation matrix.The transformation matrix should account for power invariance in the two frames of reference. In case power invariance is not maintained, then torque calculation should be from original machine variables only.|$|R
40|$|A {{new method}} for {{representing}} distorted wave forms is investigated. The method suggested by us is a modified vector symbolic method. It has been hitherto {{thought that the}} vector symbolic method {{cannot be applied to}} the distorted waves, because the rotating speeds of each harmonic vector are not identical. Representing the argument of the n-th harmonic vector by l/n times as large as the phase angle of the harmonic component, the relative positions of respective harmonic vectors are invariable wherever the standard vector is put, and the wave shape can be deduced from the vector diagram. We found various correspondences between the wave forms and the vector diagrams. Therefore, the wave shape can be estimated from the vector diagram, and the mutual relationships between two wave forms can also be known. In electric or magnetic circuits, the causes of distorted wave forms are in general obvious. Therefore, there are very often the fixed relationships between the amplitudes and phase angles of the harmonics. Further, in <b>polyphase</b> a. c. <b>circuits,</b> there are often the fixed relationships between corresponding harmonics in the wave forms of the respective phases. When the wave forms of those circuits are discussed, the new method investigated in this paper may offer a useful key...|$|R
40|$|The {{tremendous}} {{increase in}} wireless communication {{over the last}} few decades has led to a congestion of the radio frequency (RF) spectrum, which is utilized for transmission and reception of information. As suitable RF spectrum is scarce, attempts are being made to use the RF spectrum in a more intelligent efficient way. A Cognitive Radio addresses this problem by Dynamic Spectrum Access, i. e. measure which spectrum is temporarily locally free and then use it. The Cognitive Radio transmitter needs to be flexible to be able to transmit where ever there is free spectrum available. Conventional transmitters not only produce the desired upconverted information signal but also many unwanted harmonics of the local oscillator (LO) and distortion products related to the baseband signal. These unwanted products have been usually suppressed using dedicated RF filters which are narrowband and are not flexible. For Cognitive Radio transmitters flexibility is a key requirement, and hence other techniques are wanted to suppress unwanted products, without using the inflexible filters. Moreover, agile operation of the cognitive radio transmitter in a broad band is wanted. Previous research has shown that <b>polyphase</b> multipath <b>circuits</b> can in principle cancel a large number of harmonics and distortion products. However, a solution for wideband polyphase baseband signal generation including digital-to-analog conversion and filtering was lacking. Moreover, the upconversion was done using a large number of paths which takes quite some chip area and is not very power efficient. In this work a less complex and more power efficient implementation of this technique is proposed. The proposal is actually based on a combination of three techniques, namely: 1) 8 -path polyphase upconversion, 2) tuning of the LO duty cycle ratio to close to 7 / 16 and 3) a tunable first order RF filter. The combination of these three techniques allows to suppress all unwanted products to more than 40 dB below the desired signal. It is possible to improve this further if a tunable RLC network with high quality factor is used at the RF output. The multiphase baseband signals required for an 8 -path upconversion can be generated using a simplified vector modulator type of architecture. In order to allow for a Spurious Free Dynamic Range of 50 dB, the use of a Digital to Analog Converter (DAC) with a resolution of at least 7 bits is proposed. It is shown {{that it is possible to}} cancel the first dominant DAC image by using a polyphase DAC architecture, which relaxes analog reconstruction filtering requirements. To verify the functionality of the proposed techniques, a flexible 8 -path transmitter chip was fabricated in a 160 nanometer CMOS technology. The transmitter works over 3 octaves in frequency from 100 MHz to 800 MHz. Measurements show that the frequency ii agile transmitter achieves a broadband clean output spectrum where all unwanted products are at least 40 dB below the wanted transmit signal. This is the first polyphase multi-path transmitter combining the baseband multi-phase generation and RF circuit on one chip. Compared to other harmonic rejection transmitter designs with similar frequency range, it is more power efficient and has better LO leakage and image rejection. Note that this chip suppresses ALL LO harmonics and distortion products for ALL frequencies, without any external filters...|$|R
