In order to gain as much <b>power</b> <b>as</b> possible and build up his army, Ganon wants {{to take control of the}} shrine maidens' <b>power</b> <b>as</b> well as abducting people and sending them into the Dark World where they would become part of his army.

The four Links eventually save the shrine maidens, retrieve the Dark Mirror, destroy Shadow Link and Vaati, and face Ganon in a final battle.
