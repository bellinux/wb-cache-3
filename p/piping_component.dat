40|$|A {{framework}} for Acoustic Induced Vibration (AIV) evaluation is outlined {{which is based}} on estimating the pipe surface strain for an evaluation framework of structural fatigue. Critical to this approach is that the assessment is implemented with frequency based formulations. The frequency based formulation allows for more accurate determination of the pipe’s structure response and combining different sources, such as the valve and piping elements. The approach relies on internationally recognized standards as the core technology, in particular the IEC 60534 - 8 - 3 control valve aerodynamic noise prediction standard and the fatigue assessment in design codes, such as the ASME Boiler and Pressure Vessel code.

40|$|The main {{objective}} {{of this research is}} to develop an analysis program which can accurately simulate ratcheting in <b>piping</b> <b>components</b> subjected to seismic or other cyclic loads. Ratcheting is defined as the accumulation of deformation in structures and materials with cycles. This phenomenon has been demonstrated to cause failure to <b>piping</b> <b>components</b> (known as ratcheting-fatigue failure) and is yet to be understood clearly. The design and analysis methods in the ASME Boiler and Pressure Vessel Code for ratcheting of <b>piping</b> <b>components</b> are not well accepted by the practicing engineering community. This research project attempts to understand the ratcheting-fatigue failure mechanisms and improve analysis methods for ratcheting predictions. In the first step a state-of-the-art testing facility is developed for quasi-static cyclic and seismic testing of straight and elbow <b>piping</b> <b>components.</b> A systematic testing program to study ratcheting is developed. Some tests have already been performed an d the rest will be completed by summer' 99. Significant {{progress has been made in}} the area of constitutive modeling. A number of sophisticated constitutive models have been evaluated in terms of their simulations for a broad class of ratcheting responses. From the knowledge gained from this evaluation study two improved models are developed. These models are demonstrated to have promise in simulating ratcheting responses in <b>piping</b> <b>components.</b> Hence, implementation of these improved models in widely used finite element programs, ANSYS and/or ABAQUS, is in progress.

40|$|When the <b>piping</b> <b>component</b> {{materials}} used in refrigeration systems corrode, this degradation is often due to the materials 2 ̆ 7 environment (or, more generally, the presence or lack of a corrosion supporting electrolyte), galvanic coupling between mismatched materials, the substances carried by the piping system, and/or {{the temperature of the}} substances surrounding the components. Laboratory testing was performed in collaboration with a local industry partner to qualify and quantify the electrochemical ­ and, in this case, corrosion behaviors of steel and aluminum alloys often used in such piping systems as those behaviors change with different material coatings. A combination of Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy (EIS) and Open Circuit Potential (OCP) data provided the means to characterize the thermodynamic tendencies and kinetic behaviors of corrosion activity through these coatings, allowing us to draw conclusions about which material treatments (coatings) are most appropriate for reducing corrosion in refrigeration pipelines. While most coatings proved to inhibit surface corrosion on the alloys when compared to bare samples, we found that electrochemical testing can be used to provide a relative performance ranking among coated samples, with the best corrosion protection attributed to a combination of coating chemistry, coating thickness, and surface adhesion...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{the estimation of}} the reliability levels associated with a cracked pipe found acceptable as per the failure assessment diagram (FAD) based acceptance criteria of ASME Section XI, Appendix H. This acceptance criterion is built on the concepts of fracture mechanics. The parameters which enter the acceptance criteria are piping geometry, applied loading, crack size, and the material properties (tensile and fracture). Most of these parameters are known to exhibit uncertainty in their values. The FAD used also has an associated modeling bias. The code addresses these uncertainties by providing a factor of safety on the applied load. The use of a common factor of safety {{for a variety of}} pipe sizes, crack configuration, load combination, and materials may not ensure consistent level of safety associated with the <b>piping</b> <b>component</b> being evaluated. This level of safety can be evaluated by using structural reliability concepts.

The issue exists as to the proper methods to analyze and control hazards associated with D&D activities on facilities collocated with existing operating nuclear facilities, or future collocated facilities being considered with the resurgent nuclear industry.

A key feature of qualified fatigue monitoring is the measurement of realistic loads based on plant instrumentation and/or local temperature measurement. The major prerequisites for any subsequent fatigue assessment are the accurate component stress analysis and the identification of relevant cycles, using highly qualified and efficient cycle counting methods. In the framework of the paper the pertinent cycle counting methods such as rain flow and peak-valley, are evaluated and allocated to the relevant design codes. The peculiarities of a nuclear power plant typical one year operational thermal load time history is discussed in terms of the resulting stress-time history.

40|$|The {{last four}} decades have {{witnessed}} {{a significant change}} in the oil and gas offshore industry where field developments have moved from shallow water (10 metres to 100 metres) to deep water (100 metres to 1000 metres) and currently ultra deep water, 1000 metre and deeper. The subsea structures, components and pipelines have to stand such high external hydrostatic pressure which becomes in some cases the governing design criteria rather than the well pressure and temperature. This study focuses on pipe induction bends, which is a vital element in any ultra deep water subsea system. Bends are mainly used in the tie-in spools to connect pipeline end structures to manifolds or to well head trees. A significant amount of work has been conducted to study the behaviour of pipe bends under internal pressure in the last 150 years for its widely used applications in power plants, processing facilities and generic industrial use, however, minimal work has been conducted for pipe bends under external pressure for its rare applications. Oil and gas explorations and developments started to increase the demand of better understanding the pipe bend behaviour under high external pressure. As a result of the lack of knowledge and experimental work in this area, codes and standards have either considered it as a <b>piping</b> <b>component</b> or recommended quite stringent design criteria that more fits shallow water applications but is almost impossible to comply with deep water applications. Designers end up with required pipe wall thicknesses that exceed the manufacturing capabilities and the practical welding limits.

40|$|In {{this thesis}} the {{performance}} of different constitutive models in ratchet simulation is investigated. Ratcheting is accumulated plastic strains which may occur when a structure is subjected to a constant load in combination with cyclic loading. In the assessment of nuclear class 1 pressure retaining component ratcheting {{is one of the}} three failure modes that are addressed and may limit the design life of nuclear pressurized components and piping systems. A steel structure subjected to a constant load in combination with cyclic loading into the plastic region undergoes a change of the material characteristics in several aspects. These cyclic material characteristics are complex and may vary for different load situations, load levels, temperatures and materials. In addition to this, the presence of a mean stress may also affect the material cyclic characteristics. In previous numerical investigations on ratcheting {{there has not been a}} sufficiently robust case of simulation. However, in most of these investigations, the simulation response is compared with ratcheting experiments which either are conducted under load levels which are not common for a nuclear pressurized component, the experimental specimen is not comparable with a pressurized component or only a few experimental tests have been conducted. Hence, it has not been settled which material characteristics need to be considered to accurately simulate ratcheting in a pressurized <b>piping</b> <b>component</b> under load levels common in a nuclear power plants. As a result of this, it is not obvious which types of constitutive material models is needed and how the model parameters should be calibrated in order to simulate ratcheting in a nuclear component accurately. As part of this thesis an extensive experimental program has been conducted on pressurized tube specimens. In total 30 test specimens made of two different materials, 316 L and P 235, have been manufactured and tested. In order to determine material properties, monotonic tensile load and internal pressure experiments have been performed. The remaining test specimens have been used for ratcheting experiments. The experimental results show ratcheting in the hoop direction when the tube is subjected to certain combinations of internal pressure and cyclic axial strains. The higher the pressure is and the larger the strain ranges are, the higher the ratcheting response becomes. In addition to this, also the cyclic hardening and softening behavior in the tubes axial direction and the direction of the incremental plastic strain tensor is investigated. The results show that the material cyclic hardening or softening behavior and direction of the plastic strain vector varies strongly depending on the level of primary and secondary loads. Measured ratcheting strains are compared to numerical simulations using different constitutive models. In this thesis the interrelated models of Prager, Armstrong-Frederick and Chaboche are investigated. In addition to these, the Besseling model is investigated. Among the constitutive models investigated, the Besseling multi-linear model shows by far the best agreement with the ratcheting experiments. The more advanced models are able to capture the material ratchetingbehavior, but overestimate the hoop strain in the tube tests. Investigation results also indicate that significant cyclic hardening material behavior influence the direction of the plastic stain vector and, hence, affect the accuracy of predicted results when disregarded. This effect is most apparent for the experiments subjected to high pressure and high deformation controlled loads. In the tests which experience significant cyclic hardening, the direction of the plastic strain vector starts to deviate after roughly 20 loading cycles. Simulation of ratcheting should be done with an as simple constitutive model as possible, while still capturing the essential response. Important reasons are that simple models are easier to understand and work with, and that fewer tests are needed for determining model parameters. Based on this the Besseling constitutive model is recommended for simulation of pressure equipment subjected to cyclic plastic deformation. However, if shake-down does not occur at relative early stage, effects related to cyclic softening or hardening may need to be taken into consideration.

40|$|Welding {{is applied}} in many {{industrial}} sectors to join components, {{and has become}} an important manufacturing process because it enables the fabrication of structures that could not otherwise be constructed. Weld regions have inhomogeneous microstructures and {{are more susceptible to}} crack initiation and crack propagation than the surrounding base material regions. Residual stresses are also formed, which superimpose with applied loads, resulting in a reduction of the maximum applied load a component can sustain. In particular for nuclear installations, the limited failure tolerance and the relative abundance of rather large welds require a reliable assessment of component integrity for lifetime management. Residual stresses need to be considered in such assessments because they can contribute to initiation and propagation of defects. Commonly, residual stresses are more difficult to determine experimentally or to predict by numerical methods than stresses resulting from applied loads; hence residual stress assessment in welded nuclear components is an important area of research. The present work concerns the experimental determination of residual stresses by neutron diffraction in three full-scale mock-ups of components found in nuclear power installations. Two of these mock-ups represent dissimilar metal girth welds joining ferritic steel pressure vessel nozzles to austenitic stainless steel primary piping sections. The third represents a welded clad layer on a section of a reactor pressure vessel wall. In this work neutron diffraction has been used as the technique for residual stress determination. This technique is based on the principle of Bragg diffraction and measures changes in lattice spacing; i. e., strain. Residual stresses can be determined in three directions in the bulk of a component at a spatial resolution of typically 1 - 5 mm. Such a resolution is appropriate in view of the distances over which the residual stresses normally vary in welded metallic components. There are a number of challenges associated with neutron diffraction measurements addressed in the current study. One of these is that component dimensions and geometries necessitate machining to facilitate access of the neutron beams to the measurement locations. Neutron diffraction measurements are also known {{to be sensitive to the}} inhomogeneity in the microstructure and to local variations in chemical composition in the weld region; therefore dedicated reference specimens are needed in order to calibrate the strain determinations. Prior to the description of the experimental work undertaken, background information is provided on the main aspects of the work. Definitions are given for residual stresses and strains and their main characteristics are explained (chapter 2). A short overview of the most important techniques for strain and stress measurement being used today is given in chapter 3. These are the relaxation techniques, where the relaxation of strains due to material removal is measured; and the diffraction techniques, where lattice deformations caused by stresses are observed through Bragg diffraction. A detailed account of residual stress determination based on neutron diffraction is followed by a description of the facility at the Joint Research Centre that was used for the present investigations. An overview of the industrially relevant welding techniques is given in chapter 4, where additional detail is provided on the arc welding methods used for the manufacture of the components investigated in this study. The mechanism responsible for residual stress formation in welds, namely local plastic deformation caused by steep temperature gradients, and the dendritic microstructure of stainless steel fusion welds similar to those investigated here are discussed based on a few examples. The experimental work and the results obtained are described in chapters 5, 6 and 7 with each chapter covering one of the three components. The first component is a “thin" walled (25 mm wall thickness) bi-metallic girth welded pipe. The second component is a ferritic steel block with a 10 mm thick welded stainless steel clad layer applied to one of its surfaces. This component represents a nuclear reactor pressure vessel wall with a thickness of 146 mm. The third component is a thick walled (51 mm wall thickness) bi-metallic girth welded pipe. Both, the thin and the thick walled bi-metallic pipes, represent joints between ferritic steel pressure vessel nozzles and austenitic stainless steel pipes. For each component, details are provided concerning the manufacturing techniques employed, including the welding processes, the associated heat treatments and the final machining applied to the thick walled pipe. For the access of the neutron beams in three measurement orientations windows and access slots were cut into each of the bi-metallic piping weld specimens. The clad layer specimen thickness was locally reduced from 146 mm to 25 mm. This significant reduction was necessary to achieve a high spatial resolution in the measurements. The alterations described lead to stress relaxation and stress redistribution within the components. For the thick bi-metallic pipe the relaxation of strains was monitored by strain gauges during cutting showing negligible impact at the location of the neutron diffraction measurements. All component modifications are described in detail as well as the design and manufacture of the reference specimens needed for the calibration of the strain measurements. The measurement procedures and the data analyses are explained, and for each specimen the neutron diffraction results are presented in terms of residual strains and the derived stresses. In the thin walled bi-metallic pipe, tensile residual stresses have been found in the welding direction within the fusion zone. These tensile stresses reach values not far below the yield level of the material near the outer surface; and they decrease to almost 0 MPa toward the inner surface of the pipe. In the ferritic part of the pipe compressive residual stresses have been found near the austenitic-ferritic material interface. Here, the highest compression is observed close to the inner surface, decreasing toward the outer surface. In the welding transverse direction, tensile stresses have been obtained near the outer surface changing gradually to compressive stresses near the inner surface. The maximum stress levels attained in tension and compression are slightly lower than those in the welding direction. The piping radial direction exhibits overall the lowest stress levels in this component with values varying between + 100 MPa and - 100 MPa. The stainless steel clad layer of the clad component exhibits high tensile stresses in the welding longitudinal direction as well as in the welding transverse direction. The stress level ranges between 250 and 500 MPa with a considerable scatter of the data. The ferritic steel substrate is found to be in compression in both directions with minimum stress levels between - 150 and - 200 MPa near the austenitic-ferritic material interface. The stresses in the interface normal direction observed in this component scatter about 0 MPa. In the fusion zone of the thick walled bi-metallic <b>piping</b> <b>component,</b> tensile residual stresses have been found in the welding direction. In the ferritic part compressive residual stresses have been found in this direction near the austenitic-ferritic interface. Both of these observations are similar to those made for the thin walled component. The maximum stress levels observed are slightly higher than in the thinner component; the tensile stresses in the fusion zone reach the nominal yield level. No clear trend is observed for the welding longitudinal stresses between the outer and the inner surface. For the other two measurement directions the scatter of the data is so high that the magnitude of the stresses cannot be determined with sufficient accuracy. For all three components the data recorded from the fusion zones exhibit higher scatter than those from the base materials. The neutron diffraction results have been compared to third party numerical predictions of the residual stresses and to stress measurements by strain relaxation techniques. The numerical predictions have been performed by finite element analyses. Simplified and more detailed approaches have been applied. In the simplified approaches the welding process itself has been neglected unlike in the detailed models. In all cases the detailed numerical assessments produced a better agreement with the neutron diffraction results than the simplified ones. In particular, in the fusion zones the simplified numerical approaches under predict the residual stresses found by neutron diffraction. The applied third party strain relaxation techniques were the ring core method and deep hole drilling for the clad layer component, and surface hole drilling and the crack compliance method for the thick walled bi-metallic pipe. Most comparisons with the neutron diffraction data show a qualitative, but not a close quantitative agreement. The discrepancies are attributed to the use of differently extracted test pieces from the original components and to the differences in the measurement geometries that apply to the different methods used. Subsequent to the presentation of the measurements and their results, an assessment of the experimental methods and the analysis of the results are performed. In particular attention is given to the method of obtaining the measurement uncertainties. In stress determination by neutron diffraction it is common practice to calculate the uncertainties solely from the fitting uncertainties of the neutron data; a practice that has been applied in this work as well. The detailed assessment of the results indicates that this approach can provide appropriate uncertainty values only for materials that are sufficiently homogenous. This is the case, for example, for the ferritic steel substrate of the clad layer component. For the less homogeneous regions, like the welds in these components, it is observed that the experimental data exhibit larger scatter than one would expect on the basis of the counting statistics. The analysis of the effect suggested that the uncertainty is underestimated by a factor of up to 10 in the worst case presented. The second uncertainty contributor analysed in more detail is the uncertainty in the detector position.. The analysis shows that, for the highest strains measured, an uncertainty in detector position as small as 1 ° or 2 ° results in an additional strain uncertainty comparable to that stemming from the fitting uncertainties. Other sources of uncertainty, such as possible errors in specimen positioning or variations of the specimen temperature, are also briefly analysed. It is found that these do not produce significant additional uncertainty contributions in these investigations. Based on the observations and subsequent analyses of the findings and comparisons several conclusions are derived. The most significant conclusions can be summarized as follows:  The applied cutting schemes for the specimens and the use of the dedicated reference specimens have made the neutron diffraction measurements possible. The necessary alterations to the specimens have an impact on the stresses under investigation. It is demonstrated that the impact should be quantified through experiments or modelling, in order to relate the stresses measured to the original stresses present in the test piece.  It is shown that for a material like the welds studied in this work, the impact of the material inhomogeneity on the neutron diffraction measurements must be considered in a complete uncertainty analysis. It is found that this uncertainty contribution can be larger than the contribution from the fitting uncertainty of the neutron data.  The neutron diffraction stress measurements can be used for the validation of numerical stress prediction methods. It is demonstrated that the simplified numerical approaches for these specimens are not sufficient. Following from the above, a number of recommendations are formulated for further improvements in the application of neutron diffraction for future residual stress measurements in large welded components. In similar cases it is recommended to apply experimental techniques capable of mitigating the problem of the high scatter in the results obtained for the fusion zones. The time-of-flight technique is presented as one option, or where possible, rocking of the specimen during measurements could be applied to increase the number of grains sampled during a diffraction measurement. Furthermore, the importance of quantifying the stress relaxation due to modifications of the specimens is pointed out. This quantification could be achieved by numerical simulation, but preferably by measurement, in particular when the recommendations just mentioned are followed...|$|E

Various methods of analyses for cracks {{are used in the}} determination of fracture characterizing parameters, which in turn can be used to predict loads and crack sizes at which failure would occur. [...] In engineering practice, robust methods for estimating fracture parameters are useful, given the lack of details of material data, geometric configuration and computational sophistication in an operational industrial plant. This thesis focuses on the approximate methods for the determination of (1) crack tip plastic zone size, (2) the J of circular-ended notches and (3) the J for three-dimensional pressure vessels and <b>piping</b> <b>components.</b> Furthermore, this thesis focuses on design perspectives based on robust methods.
