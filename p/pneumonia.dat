5|$|Occasionally, {{influenza}} {{can cause}} severe illness including primary viral <b>pneumonia</b> or secondary bacterial <b>pneumonia.</b> The obvious symptom is trouble breathing. In addition, {{if a child}} (or presumably an adult) {{seems to be getting}} better and then relapses with a high fever, that is a danger sign since this relapse can be bacterial <b>pneumonia.</b>|$|E
5|$|<b>Pneumonia,</b> another {{potential}} complication, develops {{in as many}} as 20% of people with pulmonary contusion. Contused lungs are less able to remove bacteria than uninjured lungs, predisposing them to infection. Intubation and mechanical ventilation further increase the risk of developing pneumonia; the tube is passed through the nose or mouth into the airways, potentially tracking bacteria from the mouth or sinuses into them. Also, intubation prevents coughing, which would clear bacteria-laden secretions from the airways, and secretions pool near the tube's cuff and allow bacteria to grow. The sooner the endotracheal tube is removed, the lower the risk of <b>pneumonia,</b> but if it is removed too early and has to be put back in, the risk of <b>pneumonia</b> rises. People who are at risk for pulmonary aspiration (e.g. those with lowered level of consciousness due to head injuries) are especially likely to get <b>pneumonia.</b> As with ARDS, the chances of developing <b>pneumonia</b> increase with the size of the contusion. Children and adults have been found to have similar rates of complication with <b>pneumonia</b> and ARDS.|$|E

5|$|Unlike most {{strains of}} influenza, H1N1 does not disproportionately infect adults older than 60years; {{this was an}} unusual and {{characteristic}} feature of the H1N1 pandemic.

This manifests itself as increased breathing difficulty and typically occurs 3–6 days after initial onset of flu symptoms. The <b>pneumonia</b> caused by flu can be either direct viral <b>pneumonia</b> or a secondary bacterial <b>pneumonia.</b> In fact, a November 2009 New England Journal of Medicine article recommends that flu patients whose chest X-ray indicates <b>pneumonia</b> receive both antivirals and antibiotics.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background Mycoplasma <b>pneumoniae</b> and Chlamydophila <b>pneumoniae</b> {{are major}} causes of lower and upper {{respiratory}} infections {{that are difficult}} to diagnose using conventional methods such as culture. The ProPneumo- 1 (Prodesse, Waukesha, WI) assay is a commercial multiplex real-time PCR assay for the simultaneous detection of M. <b>pneumoniae</b> and/or C. <b>pneumoniae</b> DNA in clinical respiratory samples. Objective The aim {{of this study was to}} evaluate the sensitivity and specificity of the ProPneumo- 1, a newly developed commercial multiplex real-time PCR assay. Methods A total of 146 clinical respiratory specimens, collected from 1997 to 2007, suspected of C. <b>pneumoniae</b> or M. <b>pneumoniae</b> infections were tested retrospectively. Nucleic acid was extracted using an automated NucliSense easyMag (bioMerieux, Netherlands). We used a "Home-brew" monoplex real-time assay as the reference method for the analysis of C. <b>pneumoniae</b> and culture as the reference method for the analysis of M. <b>pneumoniae.</b> For discordant analysis specimens were re-tested using another commercial multiplex PCR, the PneumoBacter- 1 assay (Seegene, Korea). Results Following discordant analysis, the sensitivity of the ProPneumo- 1 assay for pathogens, C. <b>pneumoniae</b> or M. <b>pneumoniae,</b> was 100 %. The specificity of the ProPneumo- 1 assay, however, was 100 % for C. <b>pneumoniae</b> and 98 % for M. <b>pneumoniae.</b> The limits of detection were 1 genome equivalent (Geq) per reaction for pathogens, M. <b>pneumoniae</b> and C. <b>pneumoniae.</b> Due to the multipex format of the ProPneumo- 1 assay, we identified 5 additional positive specimens, 2 C. <b>pneumoniae</b> in the M. <b>pneumoniae</b> -negative pool and 3 M. <b>pneumoniae</b> in the C. <b>pneumoniae</b> -negative pool. Conclusion The ProPneumo- 1 assay is a rapid, sensitive and effective method for the simultaneous detection of M. <b>pneumoniae</b> and C. <b>pneumoniae</b> directly in respiratory specimens. </p...|$|R
40|$|In {{order to}} {{evaluate}} the role of Mycoplasma <b>pneumoniae</b> and Chlamydia <b>pneumoniae,</b> we studied 613 children aged 2 - 14 years who were hospitalized for community-acquired lower respiratory tract infections (LRTIs). The patients {{were enrolled in the}} study by 21 centers in different regions of Italy from May 1998 through April 1999. Paired serum samples were obtained on admission and after 4 - 6 weeks to assay the titers of M. <b>pneumoniae</b> and C. <b>pneumoniae</b> antibodies. Nasopharyngeal aspirates for the detection of M. <b>pneumoniae</b> and C. <b>pneumoniae</b> were obtained on admission. Acute M. <b>pneumoniae</b> infections in 210 patients (34. 3 %) and acute C. <b>pneumoniae</b> infections in 87 (14. 1 %) were diagnosed. Fifteen of the 18 children with M. <b>pneumoniae</b> and/or C. <b>pneumoniae</b> infections whose treatments were considered clinical failures 4 - 6 weeks after enrollment had not been treated with macrolides. Our study confirms that M. <b>pneumoniae</b> and/or C. <b>pneumoniae</b> plays a significant role in community-acquired LRTIs in children of all ages and that such infections have a more complicated course when not treated with adequate antimicrobial agents...|$|R
40|$|Objectives: This {{retrospective}} study was {{aimed to explore}} the epidemiological and clinical profiles of Mycoplasma <b>pneumoniae</b> infection in neonates. Methods: From 2011 to 2014, 1322 hospitalized neonates with lower respiratory tract infections were screened for Mycoplasma <b>pneumoniae</b> by detection of Mycoplasma <b>pneumoniae</b> antibodies using Serion ELISA classic Mycoplasma <b>pneumoniae</b> kits. Results: Mycoplasma <b>pneumoniae</b> was identified in 89 (6. 7 %) patients. The age ranged from 1 day to 28 days with a median of 22 days. The male to female ratio was 1. 15 : 1. Mycoplasma <b>pneumoniae</b> infection peaked in spring (from March through May) and winter (from December through February). Compared with non-Mycoplasma <b>pneumoniae</b> infected neonates, those with Mycoplasma <b>pneumoniae</b> infection were older, presented fever more frequently, and had less tachypnea. Conclusions: Mycoplasma <b>pneumoniae</b> could be an important etiologic agent for respiratory tract infection in neonates. In neonates Mycoplasma <b>pneumoniae</b> infection was usually associated with older age, presence of fever, and less tachypnea.
