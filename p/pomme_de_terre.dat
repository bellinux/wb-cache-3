5|$|The East Plains Trail {{followed}} the older routes of the West Plains Trail from Pembina to Breckenridge, Minnesota, then struck east {{by a variety}} of routes out of the Red River Valley across the upper valleys of the <b>Pomme</b> <b>de</b> <b>Terre</b> and Chippewa Rivers (tributaries of the Minnesota River), to Saint Cloud and Sauk Rapids on the Upper Mississippi. Soon however, a branch was added to connect the East Plains Trail with the Woods Trail. This link skirted the west slope of the Leaf Mountains and joined the East Plains routes at Elbow Lake or near the Otter Tail River. At times, this eastern connection may have been the better-travelled of the two variants.|$|E
25|$|The Lake of the Ozarks, <b>Pomme</b> <b>de</b> <b>Terre</b> Lake, and Truman Lake in the {{northern}} Ozarks were formed by impounding the Osage River and its tributary the <b>Pomme</b> <b>de</b> <b>Terre</b> River in 1931, 1961 and 1979 respectively. Grand Lake in northeast Oklahoma was created in 1940. Stockton Lake was formed by damming the Sac River {{near the city of}} Stockton, Missouri in 1969 and supplements the water supply of Springfield in nearby Greene County. Most of the dams were built for the dual purpose of flood control and hydropower generation.|$|E

6000|$|On the Coppermine River the medicine-man, {{according}} to Hearne, prophesies of travellers, like the Highland second-sighted man, ere they appear. The Finns and Lapps boast of similar powers. Scheffer is copious on the clairvoyant feats of Lapps in trance. The Eskimo Angakut, when bound {{with their heads}} between their legs, cause luminous apparitions, just as was done by Mr. Stainton Moses, and by the mediums known to Porphyry and Iamblichus; the Angakut also send their souls on voyages, and behold distant lands. One of the oddest Angekok stories in Rink's Tales and Traditions of the Eskimo (p. 324) tells how some children played at magic, making 'a dark cabinet,' by hanging jackets over the door, to exclude the light. 'The slabs of the floor were lifted and rushed after them:' a case of 'movement of objects without physical contact'. This phenomenon in future attended the young medium's possessions, {{even when he was}} away from home. This particular kind of manifestation, so very common in trials for witchcraft, and in modern spiritualistic literature, does not appear to prevail much among savages. Persons otherwise credible and sane tell the authorities of the Psychical Society that, with only three amateurs present, things are thrown about, and objects are brought from places many miles distant, and tossed on the table. These are technically termed apports. The writer knows a case in which this was attested by a witness of the most unimpeachable character. But savages hardly go so far. Bishop Callaway has an instance in which 'spirits' tossed objects into the midst of a Zulu circle, but such things are not usual. Savages also set out food for the dead, but they scarcely attain to the credulity, or are granted the experience, of a writer in the Medium. {53} This astonishing person knew a familiar spirit. At dinner, one day, an empty chair began to move, 'and in answer to the question whether it would have some dinner, said [...] "Yes"'. It chose croquets de <b>pomme</b> <b>de</b> <b>terre,</b> which were placed on the chair in a spoon, lest the spirit, whose manners were rustic, should break a plate. 'In a few seconds I was told that it was eaten, and looking, found the half of it gone, with the marks showing the teeth.' Perhaps few savages would have told such a tale to a journal which ought to have a large circulation--among believers.|$|E
50|$|The {{village of}} <b>Pomme</b> <b>de</b> <b>Terre</b> was first {{settled in the}} late 1860s and was platted in 1874 in section 24 of <b>Pomme</b> <b>de</b> <b>Terre</b> Township. <b>Pomme</b> <b>de</b> <b>Terre</b> had a post office from 1868 until 1879, and again from 1880 until 1902. At its height, <b>Pomme</b> <b>de</b> <b>Terre</b> had two stores, two {{blacksmith}} shops, a grist mill, elevator, hotel and saloon. In 1873 an attempt to have <b>Pomme</b> <b>de</b> <b>Terre</b> named the county seat failed. The development of Herman, the growth of Elbow Lake as the county seat, {{and the failure of}} the railroad to come through <b>Pomme</b> <b>de</b> <b>Terre</b> (going instead to the north through Ashby) led to the eventual demise of the village.|$|E
