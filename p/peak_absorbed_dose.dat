40|$|PURPOSE: To {{determine}} whether intense laser-produced x rays {{have an increased}} radiation hazard. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Mammalian cells were exposed to x rays from a laser-produced plasma that produced ultrahigh <b>peak</b> <b>absorbed</b> <b>dose</b> rates, up to a factor of 10 (10) higher than those produced by conventional x rays used in imaging. The cell survival was studied {{as a function of}} the absorbed dose. The survival of mammalian cells exposed to high <b>peak</b> <b>absorbed</b> <b>dose</b> rates with laser-produced x rays was compared with the survival of cells exposed to standard absorbed dose rates with conventional x-ray sources. Comparative survival studies were performed by using a conventional x-ray tube and a cobalt 60 source. The absorbed doses in the irradiation field were measured with thermoluminescent dosimeters. RESULTS: Cell survival following irradiation by filtered, laser-produced x rays with a high dose rate was not markedly different from the survival following irradiation by conventional sources. There was, however, a notable difference between the survival after exposure to filtered, laser-produced x rays and the survival after exposure to unfiltered laser-produced x rays. CONCLUSION: Exposure to filtered, laser-produced x rays with a high dose rate does not lead to increased harm to mammalian cells exposed in vitro compared with the harm from exposure to x rays from conventional sources, which indicates that the use of high-power laser facilities for medical imaging is justifie...|$|E
40|$|This {{theoretical}} and case study review of dynamic exposures of aquatic organisms to organic contaminants examines variables important for interpreting exposure and therefore toxicity. The timing {{and magnitude of}} the absorbed dose change when the dynamics of exposure change. Thus, the dosemetric for interpreting toxic responses observed during such exposure conditions is generally limited to the specific experiment and cannot be extrapolated to either other experiments with different exposure dynamics or to field exposures where exposure dynamics usually are different. This is particularly true for mixture exposures, for which the concentration and composition and, therefore, the timing and magnitude of exposure to individual components of different potency and potentially differentmechanisms of action can vary. Aquatic toxicology needs studies that develop temporal thresholds for absorbed toxicant doses to allow for better extrapolation between conditions of dynamic exposure. Improved experimental designs are required that include high‐quality temporal measures of both the exposure and the absorbed dose to allow better interpretation of data. For the short term, initial water concentration {{can be considered a}} conservative measure of exposure, although the extent to which this is true cannot be estimated specifically unless the dynamics of exposure as well as the toxicokinetics of the chemicals in the exposure scenario for the organism of interest are known. A better, but still limited, metric for interpreting the exposure and, therefore, toxicity is the <b>peak</b> <b>absorbed</b> <b>dose,</b> although this neglects toxicodynamics, requires appropriate temporal measures of accumulated dose to determine th...|$|E
40|$|Session 1 Radiation induced {{chemical}} {{changes in}} polyhydroxymethylacrylate gels (PHEMAG) used in 3 D radiation dosimetry {{have been studied}} using Raman spectroscopy. The gels were irradiated to low energy xray and the polymerization of PHEMAG gels are followed by the change of Raman shift intensity of the carbon covalent bond of PHEMAG originated from both monomer and the cross-linker. The variation in <b>peak</b> intensities with <b>absorbed</b> <b>dose</b> was observed. The peak intensities of covalent bond of carbon in the polymer gels decrease with increasing tube voltage. This indicates that polymerization increase with higher dose of radiation. The concentration of monomers was also varied.

30|$|Conclusively, the {{cellular}} response to ionizing radiation {{is complex and}} differs with <b>absorbed</b> <b>dose.</b> The response acquired at high <b>absorbed</b> <b>doses</b> cannot be extrapolated down to low <b>absorbed</b> <b>doses</b> or vice versa. We also demonstrated that the thyroid - already at <b>absorbed</b> <b>doses</b> similar to those obtained in radionuclide therapy - responds with expression of {{a high number of}} genes. Due to the increased heterogeneous irradiation at low <b>absorbed</b> <b>doses,</b> we suggest that this response partly originates from non-irradiated cells in the tissue, i.e., bystander cells.|$|R
30|$|In {{the first}} {{trimester}} of pregnancy, the <b>absorbed</b> <b>dose</b> to the uterus {{may be used as}} a substitute for the <b>absorbed</b> <b>dose</b> to the embryo. Similarly, the <b>absorbed</b> <b>dose</b> to the fetus from radioactive substances without placental transfer is expected to be within the same range as the dose to the uterus. In the case of radioactive substances with placental transfer, the <b>absorbed</b> <b>dose</b> to organs and tissues of the mother may, as a first approximation, be taken as representative of the <b>absorbed</b> <b>dose</b> to the corresponding organs and tissues of the fetus [51].|$|R
30|$|Following the {{recommendations}} of Publication 103 of the ICRP [14], these <b>absorbed</b> <b>doses</b> were then sex-averaged and the effective dose was evaluated using the tissue weighting factors of Publication 60 of the ICRP [15]. Recommendations of the ICRP subsequent to this publication were followed in the effective <b>dose</b> evaluation: the <b>absorbed</b> <b>dose</b> to the thymus gland {{was used as a}} surrogate for that to the oesophagus; the <b>absorbed</b> <b>dose</b> to the colon wall was calculated as the mass-weighted sum of the <b>absorbed</b> <b>doses</b> to the walls of the upper and lower large intestines; and the gonadal <b>absorbed</b> <b>dose</b> was taken to be the mean of the <b>absorbed</b> <b>doses</b> to the testes and ovaries [16].|$|R
30|$|Among the {{patients}} who did not complete 4  cycles, 14 were stopped because of an expected kidney <b>absorbed</b> <b>dose</b> after the following cycle higher than 25  Gy. Indeed, at our institution, before giving a subsequent cycle of treatment, the <b>absorbed</b> <b>doses</b> to kidneys during the previous (p) treatments are examined and an expected cumulative <b>absorbed</b> <b>dose</b> after the following (p[*]+[*] 1) cycle is determined. The latter is calculated as the mean <b>absorbed</b> <b>dose</b> over the previous (p) treatments to which is added the cumulative <b>absorbed</b> <b>dose</b> over these (p) treatments. We withheld PRRT if the expected cumulated <b>absorbed</b> <b>dose</b> after the subsequent treatment was predicted to exceed 25  Gy for kidneys (except for very specific cases where cost/benefit ratio led us to continue treatment). For instance, a cumulative <b>absorbed</b> <b>dose</b> above 18.75  Gy after the third cycle would lead to stop the treatment.|$|R

40|$|Radioembolisation (RE), with yttrium- 90 (90 Y) {{labelled}} microspheres, is {{an increasingly}} common treatment method for unresectable liver tumours. The tolerable mean <b>absorbed</b> <b>dose</b> for normal liver (NL) tissue {{is higher in}} RE than in External Beam Radiation Therapy (EBRT); <b>absorbed</b> <b>dose</b> heterogeneity {{is thought to be}} one important reason, together with a low <b>absorbed</b> <b>dose</b> rate, but the knowledge of microsphere distributions is limited. The aim of this thesis was to describe macroscopic and small-scale heterogeneity in the distribution of microspheres and consequently in <b>absorbed</b> <b>dose,</b> and to create a hepatic branching artery tree model, able to reproduce normal liver microsphere and <b>absorbed</b> <b>dose</b> distributions. Another aim was to develop and evaluate a method for prediction of <b>absorbed</b> <b>dose</b> to the surgeon’s hands during liver resection on still radioactive tissues. Two patients with marginally resectable cholangiocarcinoma underwent resection, nine days after RE with resin SIR-Spheres®. Considering radiation safety, simulation of <b>absorbed</b> <b>dose</b> to surgeon’s hands was performed with the software Varskin Mod 2 ® before surgery and <b>absorbed</b> <b>dose</b> rate measurements were done with thermoluminescent dosimeters (TLD) on resected tissue. The macroscopic sphere distribution within NL was investigated by gamma well chamber activity measurements on punch biopsies from sliced resected tissues and by calculating coefficient of variation (CV) and skewness (SK), in relation to biopsy mass. Small-scale heterogeneity in microsphere and <b>absorbed</b> <b>dose</b> distribution was studied by light microscopy and subsequent <b>absorbed</b> <b>dose</b> simulations by beta dose point kernel convolution. A branching artery tree model was used, to simulate microsphere and <b>absorbed</b> <b>dose</b> distributions. Tissue measurements and simulations of <b>absorbed</b> <b>dose</b> to surgeon’s hands showed similar results. The CV and SK of activity concentration, by gamma well chamber measurements, decreased rapidly with increasing mass and/or mean activity concentration. Aggregations of clusters increased in frequency and CV and SK for <b>absorbed</b> <b>dose</b> distribution increased with mean sphere concentration. The branching artery tree model was able to resemble the biopsy sphere and <b>absorbed</b> <b>dose</b> distributions. Expected <b>absorbed</b> <b>dose</b> to the surgeon’s hands was not alarming, but simulations and measurements of surgeon finger <b>absorbed</b> <b>dose</b> are recommended. Decreasing CV and SK for macroscopic distribution indicated a heterogeneous pattern larger than the punch biopsy masses investigated. Small-scale sphere and <b>absorbed</b> <b>dose</b> heterogeneity both increased with mean sphere concentration. The branching artery tree model helps to explain the distribution mechanism better than previous distribution models. The shown heterogeneity and the arterial tree model provide knowledge that may be helpful in optimising RE treatment, regarding number of injected spheres and activity per sphere...|$|R
30|$|In {{line with}} the expectation, the {{comparison}} of the <b>absorbed</b> <b>doses</b> per activity between the lemon-juice and chewing-gum stimulation groups yielded, on average, a significantly lower value for the chewing-gum than for the lemon-juice stimulation group (Table  2 and Figure  4). The <b>absorbed</b> <b>dose</b> per activity was approximately 30 % to 40 % lower when chewing tasteless gum. The above findings demonstrate that the increased blood flow {{appears to be a}} decisive factor causing the increased <b>absorbed</b> <b>doses</b> in the lemon-juice stimulation group. However, {{no significant difference in the}} <b>absorbed</b> <b>doses</b> per activity (P[*]≥[*] 0.60) was observed between the chewing-gum stimulation and non-stimulation groups (Figure  4); the percentage difference of the mean <b>absorbed</b> <b>dose</b> was − 8 % for the submandibular gland and 5 % for the parotid gland. Contrary to the expectation, chewing-gum stimulation and non-stimulation yielded similar <b>absorbed</b> <b>doses</b> per activity. Thus, the assumed washout effect was not large enough to alter significantly the <b>absorbed</b> <b>dose</b> between the chewing-gum stimulation and non-stimulation groups.|$|R

30|$|One hundred eighty-seven {{patients}} who completed treatment with [177 Lu]-DOTA-TATE and underwent PTS for dosimetry calculation {{were included in}} this retrospective study. The correlation between the cumulative <b>absorbed</b> <b>dose</b> to kidneys {{after the completion of}} treatment and the <b>absorbed</b> <b>dose</b> after the first cycle(s) was studied. Multilinear regression analysis was done to predict the cumulative <b>absorbed</b> <b>dose</b> to the kidneys of the subsequent cycles, and an algorithm for the follow up of kidney <b>absorbed</b> <b>dose</b> is proposed.|$|R
30|$|In conclusion, {{the strong}} <b>absorbed</b> <b>dose</b> {{heterogeneity}} verified {{in this study}} was due to varying degree of sphere aggregation. The sphere clusters were located in both arterioles and small arteries and increased in size with increasing number of spheres per mass unit. The <b>absorbed</b> <b>dose</b> simulations showed that also the <b>absorbed</b> <b>dose</b> inhomogeneity increased with increasing <b>absorbed</b> <b>dose.</b> These results contradict earlier modelling studies and may have important influence in explaining the radiobiological situation in RE therapy.|$|R
40|$|A method using {{dose rate}} {{constant}} and anisotropy function for calculating <b>absorbed</b> <b>dose</b> distribution in brachytherapy has been recommended by AAPM Report no. 51. In 2003, the radiation treatment planning equipment with the method for obtaining the <b>absorbed</b> <b>dose</b> distribution in brachytherapy using Cs- 137 needles was introduced into Department of Radiology, Nagoya University Hospital. The method beforehand requires radial dose functions g(r) and anisotropy functions F(r, θ). These functions are decided from known <b>absorbed</b> <b>dose.</b> However, {{it is difficult}} technologically to measure the <b>absorbed</b> <b>dose</b> distribution {{in the vicinity of}} the Cs- 137 needle for brachytherapy. Therefore, we obtained these functions after the <b>absorbed</b> <b>dose</b> distribution had been calculated using a conventional method. The <b>absorbed</b> <b>dose</b> distribution calculated by the conventional method must be compared with the measurement one. In order to verify the accuracy of this method, we compared the <b>absorbed</b> <b>dose</b> distribution obtained with this method and that obtained with EGS 4 Monte Carlo simulation. Furthermore, we examined the influence of the geometry of the needle source to the <b>absorbed</b> <b>dose</b> distribution. As a result, both <b>absorbed</b> <b>dose</b> distributions obtained by two methods were good agreement with each other. In addition, there was little influence to the dose distribution on the basis of a difference of the geometry on both ends of the needle...|$|R

The effective dose coefficients ranged from 0.001 to 0.063  mSv/MBq.|$|R
30|$|Based on {{preliminary}} {{observations of}} the low variability of the kidney <b>absorbed</b> <b>dose</b> across successive cycles of treatment administered empirically, we hypothesized that the cumulative <b>absorbed</b> <b>dose</b> would be correlated to the <b>absorbed</b> <b>dose</b> after the first cycle(s).

30|$|The {{macroscopic}} and microscopic non-uniformity of the <b>absorbed</b> <b>dose</b> distributions may {{be valuable}} information for explaining the tolerance {{of a relatively}} high mean <b>absorbed</b> <b>dose</b> in the entire liver parenchyma. Strong dose gradients within individual biopsies {{will result in a}} systematic non-uniformity and, thus, a lower mean <b>absorbed</b> <b>dose</b> to the parenchyma regions that are not very close to large clusters. Such systematic inhomogeneity in the <b>absorbed</b> <b>dose</b> may be beneficial for the radiation tolerance of the parenchyma. A higher concentration of spheres needed for treatment with lower activity per sphere, i.e., resin spheres, increases the <b>absorbed</b> <b>dose</b> non-uniformity within the liver parenchyma, competing with the increase in non-uniformity due to the higher activity per microsphere of glass spheres. Therefore, <b>absorbed</b> <b>dose</b> non-uniformity is not just a question of activity per microsphere, but also of the concentration of microspheres.|$|R
30|$|Although the photon yield is {{relatively}} low, {{the high level}} of activity administered makes quantitative gamma camera imaging of 177 Lu possible [21, 22].

A clear correlation between tumor <b>absorbed</b> <b>doses</b> and the response to the treatment was reported in pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors [24]. Although it has been demonstrated that patient-specific <b>absorbed</b> <b>doses</b> for 177 Lu can be calculated and have a clinical benefit, the <b>absorbed</b> <b>dose</b> limits for normal tissue and the desirable <b>absorbed</b> <b>dose</b> to the tumors require further investigations.|$|R
30|$|The higher tolerated mean <b>absorbed</b> <b>dose</b> for {{selective}} {{internal radiation}} therapy (SIRT) with intra-arterially infused 90 Y microspheres compared to external beam therapy is speculated {{to be caused}} by <b>absorbed</b> <b>dose</b> inhomogeneity, which allows for liver regeneration. However, the complex liver microanatomy and rheology makes modelling less valuable if the tolerance doses are not based on the actual microsphere distribution. The present study demonstrates the sphere distribution and small-scale <b>absorbed</b> <b>dose</b> inhomogeneity and its correlation with the mean <b>absorbed</b> <b>dose</b> in liver tissue resected after SIRT.|$|R
30|$|The {{introduction}} of more realistic anatomical models with more detailed biokinetic models regarding the uptake, distribution, {{and retention of}} radiopharmaceuticals creates the possibility of more accurate and representative <b>absorbed</b> <b>dose</b> estimations. One of the main challenges for medical internal radiation dosimetry is to select an appropriate biokinetic model describing the uptake, retention, and clearance of the radiopharmaceutical of interest. For internal <b>absorbed</b> <b>dose</b> calculations for the Reference Person, updating the general biokinetic models includes more realistic representations of the alimentary and respiratory tract models. Updated nuclear decay data are also available in ICRP Publication 107 [22], and performing <b>absorbed</b> <b>dose</b> estimations based on the new, more realistic SAF values [21] will allow more detailed <b>absorbed</b> <b>dose</b> calculations and will provide more accurate <b>absorbed</b> <b>dose</b> estimations for patients examined with radiopharmaceuticals. The aim of this work was to update the IDAC-Dose 2.0 [23] created to calculate <b>absorbed</b> <b>dose</b> based on earlier published SAF values [24] for the ICRP adult computational voxel phantoms [20]. The updated version, IDAC-Dose 2.1, {{is based on the}} SAF values published by the ICRP [21] and implements the computational framework for internal dose assessment already used by ICRP for <b>absorbed</b> <b>dose</b> calculations at occupational and public exposures. If reliable biokinetic data for the substances are available, the program enables calculations of <b>absorbed</b> <b>dose</b> and effective dose up to 1252 radionuclides published in ICRP Publication 107.

30|$|The {{adaption}} ratio (simulated/measured mean dose) {{was almost}} perfect for individual biopsies, on average 0.99 [*]±[*] 0.025. When comparing the mean <b>absorbed</b> <b>dose</b> {{distribution of the}} sub-sample of 16 biopsies (measured activity) with the 41 biopsies (measured activity), {{it is obvious that}} the former is not a representative sample, regarding macroscopic distribution (mean: 38 [*]±[*] 21 vs. 47 [*]±[*] 34 Gy, median 36 vs. 38 Gy), thus with an overall adaption ratio (sub-sample/sample mean <b>absorbed</b> <b>dose)</b> of only 0.81. By weighting the macroscopic influence of the 16 biopsies, the adaption of the mean is better (mean: 43 [*]±[*] 38 vs. 47 [*]±[*] 34 Gy, median: 36 vs. 38 Gy), with an overall adaption ratio (weighted-sub-sample/sample mean <b>absorbed</b> <b>dose)</b> of 0.91, but it is still far from perfect. The reason for this is that the regions with the highest mean <b>absorbed</b> <b>dose</b> were not included in the microscopic sample, as cluster tracking through sequential sections was complicated for biopsies with a high concentration of microspheres. Therefore, the biopsy with the highest mean <b>absorbed</b> <b>dose</b> (i.e., 84 Gy) was used to represent the macroscopic dose distribution > 67 Gy.

However, this would not have a large impact on the distribution in the lower part of the spectrum, which is the most critical for the risk of adverse effects and overall survival of the liver following SIRT.

An example of a weak regulation at the two lower <b>absorbed</b> <b>dose</b> levels followed by a strong regulation at the highest dose level was demonstrated by the Asprv 1 gene (1.6, 2.1, and 17 at 13, 130, and 260 kBq, respectively).

Effects on cellular response to external stress and cell cycle regulation and proliferation were detected at 1.4 and 11 Gy.|$|R
30|$|The mean {{effective}} dose was more than 40 % higher in female than male subjects, predominantly originating from the almost 60 % higher <b>absorbed</b> <b>dose</b> to the urinary bladder wall and more than 90 % higher <b>absorbed</b> <b>dose</b> to the kidneys in females. The high kidney <b>absorbed</b> <b>dose</b> to subject 2 (0.090  mGy/MBq) {{could be attributed to}} the retention of urine in the kidney as previously described but the kidney <b>absorbed</b> <b>dose</b> for subject 6 (0.047  mGy/MBq) is also greater than for any of the male subjects (mean 0.036  mGy/MBq) and the difference in {{effective dose}} between male and female subjects remains notable.|$|R
