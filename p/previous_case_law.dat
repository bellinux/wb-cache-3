2500|$|Third, the EU is {{formally}} {{not enabled}} to legislate on collective bargaining, although the EU, with all member states, is {{bound by the}} jurisprudence of the European Court of Human Rights on freedom of association. In Wilson and Palmer v United Kingdom the Court held that any detriment for membership of a trade union was incompatible with article 11, and in Demir and Baykara v Turkey the Court held [...] "the right to bargain collectively with the employer has, in principle, {{become one of the}} essential elements" [...] of article 11. This approach, which includes affirmation of the fundamental right to strike in all democratic member states, has been seen as lying in tension with some of the Court of Justice's <b>previous</b> <b>case</b> <b>law,</b> notably ITWF v Viking Line ABP and Laval Un Partneri Ltd v Svenska Byggnadsarbetareforbundet. These controversial decisions, quickly disapproved by legislative measures, suggested the fundamental right of workers to take collective action was subordinate to business freedom to establish and provide services. More positively, the Information and Consultation Directive 2002 requires that workplaces with over 20 or 50 staff have the right to set up elected work councils with a range of binding rights, the European Works Council Directive 2009 enables work councils transnationally, and the Employee Involvement Directive 2001 requires representation of workers on company boards in some European Companies. If a company transforms from a member state corporation to incorporate under the European Company Regulation 2001, employees are entitled to no less favourable representation than under the member state's existing board participation laws. This is practically important as a majority of EU member states require employee representation on company boards. Fourth, minimum job security rights are provided by three Directives. The Collective Redundancies Directive 1998 specifies that minimum periods of notice and consultation occur if more than a set number of jobs in a workplace are at risk. The Transfers of Undertakings Directive 2001 require that staff retain all contractual rights, unless there is an independent economic, technical or organisational reason, if their workplace is sold from one company to another. Last, the Insolvency Protection Directive 2008 requires that employees' wage claims are protected in the event that their employer falls insolvent. This last Directive gave rise to Francovich v Italy, where the Court of Justice affirmed that member states which fail to implement the minimum standards in EU Directives are liable to pay compensation to employees who should have rights under them.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: In cases 102 - 103 / 2008 for {{the first}} time the Italian Constitutional Court has {{referred}} a question to the Court of Justice under the article 234 EC procedure. The article analyses this decision in light of <b>previous</b> contrary <b>case</b> <b>law</b> and argues that, insofar as supremacy will be construed according to the Simmenthal doctrine, the scope for preliminary ruling from that Constitutional Courtwill be rather narrow, as mainly limited to principaliter proceedings. Such a conclusion brings about an important theoretical implication. Constitutional Courts such as the Italian one will face difficulties in interacting directly with the Court of Justice and, notably, in conveying at supranational level the authentic versions of national constitutional traditions. Conversely, ordinary courts seem in a better position to play a similar role. As a consequence, if we want the Court of Justice to modify its octroy√©e methodology of construing common constitutional traditions, we have to place all our stakes on a judicial dialogue based on ordinary courts as the privileged interface between the EU and national constitutional environments. fundamental/human rights; judicial review; supremacy; European Court of Justice; Italy...|$|R

The Court prefaced their verdict by {{referring}} to two other seminal freedom of expression <b>cases</b> from <b>previous</b> German <b>Case</b> <b>Law,</b> the Mephisto Decision and the Anachronistischer Decision. The court ruled that under the German Grundgesetz (constitution) chapter about Kunstfreiheit (Freedom of art) the novel Josephine Mutzenbacher was both pornography and art, and that the former is not necessary and sufficient to deny the latter. In plain English, even though the contents of Josephine Mutzenbacher are pornographic, they are still considered art and in the process of [...] "indexing" [...] the book, the aspect of freedom of art has to be considered. The court's ruling forced the BPjM to temporarily remove the Rowohlt edition of Josephine Mutzenbacher from its [...] "list of youth-endangering media". This edition was added to the list again in 1992 in a new decision of the BPjM which considered the aspect of freedom of art, but deemed the aspect of protecting children to be more important. Later editions of the book by other publishers were not added to the list.|$|R

40|$|Sexual crimes {{continues}} to be a scourge in our society. It is therefore not surprising that the prevention and criminalisation of sexual crimes in South Africa has received a large amount of attention over the last few years. Contrarily, the matter of historical sexual abuse has received only occasional consideration. Cases of historical sexual abuse present numerous challenges to all parties involved. The victims of historical sexual abuse, often children at the time, are now adults. Some of these victims might not want to relive the experience or confront the offender. On the other hand, the offender might have been rehabilitated and become a respected citizen. In Hewitt v S 2017 1 SACR 309 (SCA) the Supreme Court of Appeal heard the appeal against the sentence of Bob Hewitt, a retired tennis champion. He was convicted of committing numerous sexual offences against young girls. The first of these crimes was committed more than three decades ago.

40|$|Award date: 30 November 2015 Supervisor: Professor Claire Kilpatrick, European University InstituteThis {{thesis is}} an {{analysis}} of judgments of the European Court of Human Rights and the European Committee of Social Rights arising from austerity measures in the European sovereign debt crisis. The thesis considers the protection afforded to socio-economic interests under the two systems, and how this protection has been tested by the challenges arising from the economic crisis. The first chapter is {{an analysis of}} the social Euro-crisis cases. Brought under Article 1 of Protocol 1 to the ECHR the measures enacted to reduce government spending were an alleged violation of the right to property. Almost all of the social Euro-crisis cases were held to be inadmissible by the Court, which cited the gravity of the economic crisis in the respondent states and the executive‚Äôs margin of appreciation in matters of social and economic policy. The second chapter places the social Euro-crisis cases in context temporally and thematically, in considering two <b>previous</b> lines of <b>case</b> <b>law</b> developed by Strasbourg: financial and economic stability, and emergency and exceptional circumstances. The ECtHR decisions focus on the severity of the crisis, determining that the margin of appreciation is broader in such circumstances. The ECtHR section concludes that it does not appear that the European sovereign debt crisis has seen Strasbourg develop any definitive crisis approach to ensure that Convention rights are protected in times of economic instability. The third chapter examines the <b>case</b> <b>law</b> generated by the European Committee of Social Rights during the same period. This section serves to act as a counterpart to the ECtHR section. The Committee emphasised that times of crisis require socio-economic rights to be protected, and finds many of the challenged austerity measures incompatible with the European Social Charter...|$|R

5000|$|Four main issues arise {{out of the}} {{interpretation}} of s.994. First of all, who {{has a right to}} complain against whom? Secondly, what specifically does the [...] "company's affairs" [...] mean in s.994(1)(a)? Thirdly, when is something [...] "unfair" [...] {{and at the same time}} [...] "prejudicial"? And lastly, when it says [...] "the interests of members", what counts as an [...] "interest" [...] of a [...] "member"? The defining feature of the s.994 action is that it is completely vague. Courts were therefore capable of interpreting the provisions gradually as they felt would be fair. After hearing a case, a court may make [...] "such order as it thinks fit" [...] under s.996. This wide discretion means that <b>previous</b> <b>case</b> <b>law</b> is not as weighty in precedent, as in other areas of law, since each case will be decided on its particular facts.|$|E
50|$|The {{doctrine}} of jurisprudence constante also influences how court decisions are structured. In general, court decisions of common law jurisdictions give a sufficient ratio decidendi as to guide future courts. The ratio {{is used to}} justify a court decision {{on the basis of}} <b>previous</b> <b>case</b> <b>law</b> as well as {{to make it easier to}} use the decision as a precedent for future cases. By contrast, court decisions in some civil law jurisdictions (most prominently France) tend to be extremely brief, mentioning only the relevant legislation and codal provisions and not going into the ratio decidendi in any great detail. This is the result of the legal positivist view that the court is only interpreting the legislature's intent and therefore detailed exposition is unnecessary. Because of this, ratio decidendi is carried out by legal academics (doctrinal writers) who provide the explanations that in common law jurisdictions would be provided by the judges themselves.|$|E
50|$|A {{lower court}} may not rule against a binding precedent, {{even if it}} feels that it is unjust; it may only express the hope that a higher court or the {{legislature}} will reform the rule in question. If the court believes that developments or trends in legal reasoning render the precedent unhelpful, and wishes to evade it and help the law evolve, it may either hold that the precedent is inconsistent with subsequent authority, or {{that it should be}} distinguished by some material difference between the facts of the cases. If that judgment goes to appeal, the appellate court {{will have the opportunity to}} review both the precedent and the case under appeal, perhaps overruling the <b>previous</b> <b>case</b> <b>law</b> by setting a new precedent of higher authority. This may happen several times as the case works its way through successive appeals. Lord Denning, first of the High Court of Justice, later of the Court of Appeal, provided a famous example of this evolutionary process in his development of the concept of estoppel starting in the High Trees case: Central London Property Trust Ltd v.
