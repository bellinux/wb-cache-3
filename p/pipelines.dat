5|$|A {{government}} inquiry {{was undertaken}} {{to determine the}} future use of the <b>pipelines,</b> and took evidence from the various stakeholders, most of whom presented the case that favored their companies or industry. The inquiry concluded that the <b>pipelines</b> should be sold for continued use in transporting petroleum. An auction for the <b>pipelines</b> was announced in 1946, {{which was designed to}} give preference to bidders who intended to use them for moving petroleum. 16 bids were received, with the highest cash bidders being companies hoping to use the <b>pipelines</b> for natural gas. Assessing the different bids proved difficult and the discussions became enmeshed in national politics, with companies seeking support from various Washington politicians. Meanwhile, a threatened national coal strike raised concerns over the availability of natural gas, strengthening the arguments of the natural gas lobby.|$|E
5|$|After {{the end of}} the {{war there}} were {{extended}} arguments over how the <b>pipelines</b> should be used. In 1947, the Texas East Transmission Corporation purchased the <b>pipelines</b> for $143,127,000, the largest post-war disposal of war-surplus property. The corporation converted them to transport natural gas, transforming the energy market in the north-east. The Little Big Inch was returned to carry oil in 1957. The <b>pipelines</b> are owned by Spectra Energy Partners and Enterprise Products and remain in use.|$|E
5|$|In 1877, Standard {{clashed with}} Thomas A. Scott, the {{president}} of the Pennsylvania Railroad, Standard's chief hauler. Rockefeller envisioned <b>pipelines</b> as an alternative transport system for oil and began a campaign to build and acquire them. The railroad, seeing Standard's incursion into the transportation and pipeline fields, struck back and formed a subsidiary to buy and build oil refineries and <b>pipelines.</b>|$|E
5000|$|In 1970-1980s, the Ukrainian gas {{transmission}} system was {{developed as a}} gas export route to Europe. [...] The first large-scale export <b>pipeline,</b> the Dolyna-Uzhhorod-Western border <b>pipeline,</b> became operational in 1967. It was {{the first stage of}} the Bratstvo (Brotherhood) <b>pipeline</b> system. [...] In 1978, the Soyuz <b>pipeline</b> (Orenburg-Western border <b>pipeline)</b> was built as the first Soviet natural gas export <b>pipeline.</b> It followed by the Urengoy-Pomary-Uzhhorod <b>pipeline</b> in 1983 (now also named as Bratstvo or Brotherhood <b>pipeline)</b> and the Progress <b>pipeline</b> (Yamburg-Western border <b>pipeline)</b> in 1988. Between 1986 and 2001, the Yelets-Kremenchuk-Ananyiv-Tiraspol-Izmail rote was developed.|$|R

5|$|Three {{bills were}} {{signed into law}} in {{response}} to the spill. Under a new law, the California Fire Marshall will be required to review the oil <b>pipelines</b> conditions every year while federal regulations only mandate a review every five years. Another new law provides for making oil spill response times faster and more effective. Finally, a new law will force intrastate <b>pipelines</b> to use the best-known technology such as automatic shut-off valves.|$|E
5|$|After {{winning the}} bidding, TETCO raised {{the money to}} pay the {{government}} through a combination of bonds and share issues. A further government enquiry was required before the sale was allowed to go through, which was complicated by the reluctance of the state of Pennsylvania to allow the <b>pipelines</b> to be used to pump gas east through its territory. The government of Pennsylvania was influenced by the coal industry, who feared they would lose sales, but it eventually relented and the sale of the <b>pipelines</b> to TETCO was finally completed on November 1. The value of the company soared, and the original investors saw the value of their holdings increase 63-fold.|$|E
5|$|Between 1947 and 1949, {{a network}} of gas <b>pipelines,</b> which linked Comodoro Rivadavia with Buenos Aires, was built. The gas {{distribution}} reached 15 million m³, reducing costs by a third.|$|E

A general analysis of coal and heavy viscous oil <b>pipelining</b> systems is introduced and <b>pipeline</b> transport of concentrated coal-water slurry, coal-water fuel, coal <b>pipelining</b> in other than water carrier liquid (e. g. methanol) and capsule <b>pipeline</b> transport (coal-log <b>pipelining)</b> is described...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—A novel {{mesochronous}} <b>pipelining</b> {{scheme is}} described in this paper. In this scheme, data and clock travel together. At any given time a <b>pipeline</b> stage could be operating {{on more than one}} data wave. The clock period in the proposed <b>pipeline</b> scheme is determined by the <b>pipeline</b> stage with largest difference between its minimum and maximum delays. This is a significant performance gain compared to conventional <b>pipeline</b> scheme where clock period is determined by the stage with the largest delay. A detailed analysis of the clock period constraints is provided to show the performance gains and of mesochronous <b>pipelining</b> over other <b>pipelining</b> schemes. Also, the number of <b>pipeline</b> stages and <b>pipeline</b> registers is small. The clock distribution scheme is simple in the mesochronous <b>pipeline</b> architecture. An 8 8 -bit carry-save adder multiplier has been implemented in mesochronous <b>pipeline</b> architecture using modest TSMC 180 -nm (drawn length 200 nm) CMOS technology. The multiplier architecture and simulation results are described in detail in this paper. The <b>pipelined</b> multiplier is able to operate on a clock period of 350 ps (2. 86 GHz). This is a of 1. 7 times over conventional <b>pipeline</b> scheme, with fewer <b>pipeline</b> stages and <b>pipeline</b> registers.

Therefore, part of the cathodic protection current that the auxiliary anode carries to <b>pipeline</b> 1 will flow into <b>pipeline</b> 2 as stray current and affects the corrosion of <b>pipeline</b> 2 —see Fig.  6.|$|R
5|$|By {{the end of}} the war, {{there was}} {{considerable}} debate over the future of the <b>pipelines.</b> The major oil companies, such as Standard Oil, campaigned for the conversion of the <b>pipelines</b> for the transfer of natural gas. Demand for natural gas was rising rapidly, and it was produced in large quantities in the Texas oilfields, but could not be got to market in the north-east and was otherwise burnt off uselessly into the atmosphere. The railroad and coal companies, who saw this as likely to introduce additional competition for coal and coal gas, and therefore lower demand for their goods and services, argued against this move. The smaller oil companies proposed continuing to use the <b>pipelines</b> for oil in order to undermine the transport monopolies of the larger corporations.|$|E
5|$|In some select cases, <b>pipelines</b> {{can even}} {{transport}} solids, such as coal and other minerals, over long distances; short distance {{transportation of goods}} such as grain, cement, concrete, solid wastes, pulp etc. is also feasible.|$|E
5|$|Once steel {{supplies}} {{had been}} agreed, an initial tranche of $35 million in funding {{was provided by}} the government Reconstruction Finance Corporation, which owned and manage the operation of the <b>pipelines</b> through its subsidiary organizations, the Defense Plants and the Defense Supplies corporations. In turn, the actual construction and operation of the <b>pipelines</b> would be carried out by the War Emergency <b>Pipelines</b> company (WEP), a non-profit corporation backed by a consortium of the largest oil companies in the United States: Atlantic Refining, Cities Service Oil, Consolidated Oil, Gulf Oil, Pan American Petroleum and Transportation, Standard Oil, Tidewater Associated Oil, Shell Oil, Socony-Vacuum Oil, Sun Oil and the Texas Pipe Line Company. The WEP was led by W. Alton Jones and Burt Hull, both with extensive backgrounds in the industry, with Oscar Wolfe as its chief engineer. The company established its offices in Little Rock, Arkansas.|$|E

5|$|The Big Inch and Little Big Inch, collectively {{known as}} the Inch <b>pipelines,</b> are {{petroleum}} <b>pipelines</b> extending from Texas to New Jersey, built between 1942 and 1944 as emergency war measures in the U.S. Before World War II, petroleum products were transported from the oil fields of Texas to the north-eastern states by sea by oil tankers. After the United States entered the war on 1 January 1942, this vital link was attacked by German submarines in the Operation Paukenschlag, threatening both the oil supplies to the north-east and its onward transshipment to Great Britain. The Secretary of the Interior, Harold Ickes, championed the pipeline project {{as a way of}} transporting petroleum by the more-secure, interior route.|$|E
5|$|Enron's {{shareholders}} lost $74 {{billion in}} the four years before the company's bankruptcy ($40 to $45 billion was attributed to fraud). As Enron had nearly $67 billion that it owed creditors, employees and shareholders received limited, if any, assistance aside from severance from Enron. To pay its creditors, Enron held auctions to sell assets including art, photographs, logo signs, and its <b>pipelines.</b>|$|E
