50|$|Lightweight diving {{helmets and}} bandmasks usually use a demand {{controlled}} breathing gas supply {{as the standard}} mode, as it is more economical on gas consumption - the amount of gas supplied is the amount needed for the diver's respiratory requirements. However, {{there may be a}} freeflow valve to provide gas at a constant flow at a rate determined by the valve which is operated by the diver. One of the functions of freeflow supply is to defog the faceplate. Another is for breathing gas supply in case of demand valve malfunction, and a third is to assist with clearing water from a leaking helmet, or to prevent inflow through a leaking exhaust <b>port</b> or <b>neck</b> seal.The demand valve of a lightweight helmet can also freeflow for some of the same reasons as can happen with a scuba demand valve.|$|R
5000|$|Manhasset Bay, New York, is an embayment {{in western}} Long Island off Long Island Sound. Manhasset Bay forms the northeastern {{boundary}} of the Great Neck Peninsula and the southwestern boundary of Cow <b>Neck</b> (<b>Port</b> Washington Peninsula or Manhasset Neck). On {{the north side of}} the bay there are three points, Barkers Point at the entrance, Plum Point coming the furthest into the Bay, and Tom's Point in the back bay. On the other side, Hewlett Point forms the entrance nearly a mile from Barkers Point. [...] Hart Island lies in the Sound just outside the mouth of Manhasset Bay.|$|R
60|$|Her {{dress was}} of a plain brown-holland looking material, the bonnet she had thrown off was of the {{coarsest}} straw, but her whole air declared her the daughter of that lordly house; and had gold and rubies been laid before her instead of cowslips with fairy favours, they would well have become her princely <b>port,</b> long <b>neck,</b> and stately head, crowned with a braid of her profuse black hair. That regal look was more remarkable in her than beauty; her brow was too high, her features not quite regular, her complexion of gypsy darkness, but with a glow of eyes very large, black, and deeply set, naturally grave in expression, but just now beaming and dancing {{in accordance with the}} encouraging smiles on her fresh, healthy, red lips, as her hands, very soft and delicate, though of large and strong make, completed the ball, threw it in the little boy's face, and laughed to see his ecstasy over the delicious prize; teaching him to play with it, tossing it backwards and forwards, shaking him into animation, and ever and anon chasing her little dog to extract it from between his teeth.|$|R
5000|$|Manhasset Bay was {{previously}} known as Schout's Bay (a schout being roughly the Dutch {{equivalent of a}} sheriff), Martin Garretson's Bay (Martin Garretson was the Schout at one point), and later Cow Bay or Cow Harbor. [...] Cow Neck was so called because it offered good grazing land. By 1659, there were over 300 cows and 5 mi (8 km) fence separating Cow Neck from the areas south of it. The settlers came to an agreement that each of them could have one cow on the neck for each section of fence the individual had constructed. The area was more formally divided among the settlers when the fence was removed in 1677. Manhasset took on the name Little Cow <b>Neck,</b> <b>Port</b> Washington was known as Upper Cow Neck.|$|R
5000|$|In F. Scott Fitzgerald's The Great Gatsby (1925), Sands Point (<b>Port</b> Washington/Manhasset <b>neck)</b> was {{referred}} to as [...] "East Egg". East Egg residents inherited their fortunes and were more highly respected than the nouveau riche in newer [...] "West Egg" [...] (Great Neck/Kings Point), because Sands Point had [...] "old money". The story's fictional Buchanans lived {{in the western part of}} Sands Point. Reports incorrectly suggest that Fitzgerald [...] - [...] while he was a guest at the mansion of Herbert Bayard Swope on Hoffstot Lane, at Prospect Point in Sands Point [...] - [...] used the site and its parties as his inspiration for the fictional Buchanan home in East Egg. The home may have served as one of the many inspirations, as Fitzgerald did likely visit it during his time living in Great Neck (1922-24), but not as a guest of Swope's. Fitzgerald left Great Neck for Paris in 1924, prior to Swope's buying that mansion. The likely story with regard to Swope is that Fitzgerald and his good friend Ring Lardner would observe many parties held at the home Swope was residing in during the time Fitzgerald was actually living in the area. This Swope residence was adjacent to Lardner's home on Shore Road in Great Neck, and is not extant, though Lardner's mansion is still standing.|$|R
40|$|Selective neck {{dissection}} (SND) {{is known}} to be a valid procedure to stage the clinically N 0 neck but its reliability to control metastatic neck disease remains controversial. This study analysed if selective neck dissection is a reliable procedure to prevent regional metastatic disease in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC). We retrospectively analysed the medical records of 163 previously untreated patients with squamous cell carcinoma of the oral cavity, oropharynx, larynx and hypopharynx treated initially in our departement from January 1990 to December 2002. All patients had unilateral or bilateral SND, in combination with surgical resection of the primary tumour. SND was performed in 281 necks. Finally, 146 patients who underwent 249 SND (39 I-III, I-IV, 210 II-IV, II-V) had adequate follow-up and were assessed for the regional control. The median follow-up was 37 months (1 - 180 months). The end points of the study were neck control following SND and overall survival. Twenty-five percent (30 / 119) of patients staged cN 0 had lymph node (LN) metastasis. Overall, regional recurrence was observed in 2. 8 % of the necks (7 / 249) : 1. 6 % (4 / 249) in dissected field and 1. 2 % (3 / 249) in undissected field. Seventy-eight percent (194 / 249) of the necks were staged pN 0 with a subsequent failure rate of 1. 5 % (3 / 194); 16 % (39 / 249) were staged pN 1 and postoperative radiotherapy (PORT) was proposed in 21 of these patients. The failure rate with PORT was 9. 5 % and 5. 5 % without PORT. Six percent (16 / 249) of the necks were staged pN 2 b and all had PORT with one subsequent recurrence. Extracapsular spread (ECS) was reported in 16. 5 % of positive SND specimens (9 / 55); all by one were treated by PORT with a subsequent failure rate of 22 % (2 / 9). At 3 years, overall survival for the whole population was 70 % and statistically highly correlated with pN stage (p< 0. 001). These results support the reliability of SND to stage the clinically N 0 neck. SND is a definitive operation not only in pN 0 but also in most pN 1 and pN 2 b <b>necks.</b> <b>PORT</b> is not justified in pN 1 neck without ECS. In pN 2 b necks, the low rate of recurrence supports adjuvant PORT. The presence of ECS, despite adjuvant PORT, remains associated with a higher risk of recurrence...|$|R
