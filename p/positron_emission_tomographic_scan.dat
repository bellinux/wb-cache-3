50|$|The use of neuroimaging {{has made}} it {{possible}} for researchers to monitor and compare structural and functional differences of brains exhibiting OCD symptoms in comparison to brains that do not have OCD and to measure specific structure's neural activity. The MRI scanning techniques have identified smaller levels of white matter volume in women with OCD in comparison to control patients that do not have OCD. The use of <b>positron</b> <b>emission</b> <b>tomographic</b> <b>scan,</b> better known as the PET scan, has enabled researchers to observe structures of the OFC, anterior cingular cortex, and the striatum for evidence of abnormal neural activity. In relationship to delayed-maturation theory of obsessive compulsive disorder, PET scans have consistently observed the caudate nucleus, cingulate volume, and volumes of both gray matter and white matter to be less consistent in patients with OCD in comparison to patients that do not have OCD. In brief, the use of neuroimaging supports delayed-maturation theory of obsessive compulsive disorder by providing researchers with concrete proof of decreased neural activity in patients with OCD in comparison to age-related patients, specifically children, without OCD.|$|E

This report introduces a kinetic model that relates 6 -[18 F]fluorodopamine <b>positron</b> <b>emission</b> <b>tomographic</b> <b>scanning</b> results to {{specific aspects of}} cardiac sympathoneural function. Inputs were the 6 -[18 F]fluorodopamine concentration in arterial blood and the estimated contribution of circulating metabolites of 6 -[18 F]fluorodopamine. All of the three compartments in the model were intraneuronal. Two compartments corresponded to vesicles in sympathetic nerves, consistent with the "multiple vesicular pool" hypothesis from preclinical studies. The model successfully fit the empirical time-activity curve for myocardial 6 -[18 F]fluorodopamine-derived radioactivity and predicted correctly the effects of several neuropharmacological and physiological manipulations on the time-activity curve. Myocardial cell uptake of metabolites of 6 -[18 F]fluorodopamine from the circulation could explain an immediate peak of 6 -[18 F]fluorodopamine-derived radioactivity.

METHODS: <b>Positron</b> <b>emission</b> <b>tomographic</b> <b>scans</b> with [11 C]WAY- 100635 were performed on 25 patients with major depressive disorder. These included 15 unmedicated depressed patients. Ten of these unmedicated patients were scanned again during selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor treatment. A further 10 patients with major depressive disorder were scanned on one occasion only while taking selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors. Comparisons were made with [11 C]WAY- 100635 <b>positron</b> <b>emission</b> <b>tomographic</b> <b>scans</b> in 18 healthy volunteer subjects. Region of interest analysis and statistical parametric mapping were performed on binding potential images generated using a reference tissue model.

We investigated whether tumor FDG avidity {{was associated with}} worse survival among patients with completely resected node-negative pure and mixed bronchioloalveolar carcinoma. MethodsWe performed a cohort study of 36 patients who had completely resected pure and mixed bronchioloalveolar carcinoma between 1998 and 2004, who had no hilar or mediastinal lymph node metastases, and who had undergone a preoperative <b>positron</b> <b>emission</b> <b>tomographic</b> <b>scan.</b> Tumor FDG avidity {{was defined as a}} standardized uptake value of 2. 5 or greater. Survival analysis was performed with a proportional hazards model. ResultsOf 36 patients studied, 26 patients (72 %) were alive and 10 patients (28 %) were dead after a median follow-up of 31 months (interquartile range 17 - 41 months). Seventeen patients (47 %) had FDG-avid tumors, and 19 patients (53 %) had non-avid tumors. Three-year survival was 49 % in the FDG-avid group and 95 % in the non-avid group (P =. 005). FDG avidity had a hazard ratio of death of 8. 6 (95 % confidence interval 1. 4 - 244. 7, P =. 02) after adjusting for tumor size, the presence of multifocal bronchioloalveolar carcinoma, and the presence of histologically mixed bronchioloalveolar carcinoma.

Setting Department of Surgery of the University of Southern California. Patients Forty-four healthy subjects and 45 patients with esophageal cancer prior to esophagectomy. Six patients were unresectable and 39 had a complete resection. Main Outcome Measures Plasma DNA levels were measured using polymerase chain reaction. Twenty resected patients had follow-up plasma DNA levels measured. Results: Preoperatively, plasma DNA levels exceeded the normal level in 38 (84 %) of 45 patients. Preoperatively, 12 patients received neoadjuvant therapy and 11 had plasma DNA levels higher than normal. All 6 unresectable patients had DNA levels higher than normal. At initial follow-up, the plasma DNA levels remained higher than normal in 2 (10 %) of 20 patients, and systemic disease was subsequently detected in each. Plasma DNA levels dropped lower than or remained normal in 18 (90 %) of 20. In 14 of 18 patients, {{there was no evidence}} of recurrent disease at a median of 12 months (range, 3 - 20 months); in 4 patients, the plasma DNA level rose higher than normal on follow-up and all developed subsequent systemic disease on computed tomographic or <b>positron</b> <b>emission</b> <b>tomographic</b> <b>scan.</b> Six of the 20 patients developed systemic disease during the follow-up (2 had persistently elevated plasma DNA levels, and 4 developed elevated plasma DNA levels at subsequent follow-ups).

40|$|BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Cardiovascular {{risk factors}} {{significantly}} {{increase the risk}} of developing Alzheimer disease. A possible mechanism may be via ischemic infarction-driving amyloid deposition. We conducted a study to determine the presence of β-amyloid in infarct, peri-infarct, and hemispheric areas after stroke. We hypothesized that an infarct would trigger β-amyloid deposition, with deposition over time. METHODS: Patients were recruited within 40 days of acute ischemic stroke and imaged with computed tomographic or magnetic resonance imaging and Pittsburgh compound B (11 C-PiB) <b>positron</b> <b>emission</b> <b>tomographic</b> <b>scans.</b> Follow-up <b>positron</b> <b>emission</b> <b>tomographic</b> <b>scanning</b> was performed in a subgroup ≤ 18 months after the stroke event. Standardized uptake value ratios for regions of interest were analyzed after coregistration. RESULTS: Forty-seven patients were imaged with (11) C-PiB <b>positron</b> <b>emission</b> tomography. There was an increase in (11) C-PiB accumulation in the stroke area compared with a reference region in the contralesional hemisphere, which was not statistically significant (median difference in standardized uptake value ratio, 0. 07 [95 % confidence interval, - 0. 06 to 0. 123]; P= 0. 452). There was no significant increase in the accumulation of (11) C-PiB in the peri-infarct region or in the ipsilesional hemisphere (median difference in standardized uptake value ratio, 0. 04 [95 % confidence interval, - 0. 02 to 0. 10]; P= 0. 095).

40|$|Background: Cognitive reserve (CR) is {{the ability}} of an {{individual}} to cope with advancing brain pathological abnormalities so that he or she remains free of symptoms. Epidemiological data and evidence from positron emission tomography suggest that it may be mediated through education or IQ. Objective: To investigate CR-mediated differential brain activation in Alzheimer disease (AD) subjects compared with healthy elderly persons. Participants: Using radioactive water positron emission tomography, we scanned 12 AD patients and 17 healthy elderly persons while performing a serial recognition memory task for nonverbalizable shapes under 2 conditions: low demand, in which one shape was presented in each study trial, and titrated demand, in which the study list length was adjusted so that each subject recognized shapes at approximately 75 % accuracy. <b>Positron</b> <b>emission</b> <b>tomographic</b> <b>scan</b> acquisition included the encoding and recognition phases. A CR factor score that summarized years of education, National Adult Reading Test estimated IQ, and Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale–Revised vocabulary subtest score (explaining 71 % of the total variance) was used as an index of CR. Voxel-wise, multiple regression analyses were performed with the "activation" difference (titrated demand–low demand) as the dependent variables and the CR factor score as the independent one. Brain regions where regression slopes differed between the 2 groups were identified.

40|$|BackgroundThe optimal {{surgical}} technique for lobectomy in lung cancer {{is not well}} defined. Proponents of video-assisted thoracic surgery (VATS) hypothesize that less trauma leads to quicker recovery, whereas those who advocate thoracotomy claim it as an oncologically superior procedure. However, a well-balanced comparison of the two procedures is lacking in the literature. MethodsAll patients who underwent lobectomy for clinical stage 1 A lung cancer by computed tomographic and <b>positron</b> <b>emission</b> <b>tomographic</b> <b>scan</b> were identified from a prospective database. Patient characteristics were compared by the Student t test, Pearson χ 2, and Fisher exact test. A propensity score–matched analysis was performed. Survival was assessed by Kaplan–Meier and Cox proportional hazards analysis. Complications were assessed by a multivariate logistic regression model evaluating age, sex, comorbidities, pulmonary function, tumor size, nodal status, surgeon, and histologic characteristics. ResultsFrom May 2002 to August 2007, 398 patients underwent an attempt at VATS lobectomy and 343 underwent thoracotomy. An “intent-to-treat” analysis was performed. There was 1 postoperative death in each group. Survival by Cox model was no different for VATS versus thoracotomy (hazard ratio 0. 72; P =. 12), whereas age (hazard ratio 1. 03; P <. 001), larger tumor size (hazard ratio 1. 34; P <. 001), and higher nodal stage (hazard ratio 1. 92; P <. 001) were associated with worse survival. Logistic regression demonstrated fewer complications for VATS lobectomy (odds ratio 0. 73; P =. 06), whereas age (odds ratio 1. 04; P <. 001) and tumor size (odds ratio 1. 2; P <. 020) correlated with {{a greater number of}} complications. Patients undergoing VATS lobectomy demonstrated a 2 -day shorter length of stay than patients undergoing thoracotomy (P <. 001). Propensity score–matched analysis supported these findings.

40|$|ObjectiveSeveral {{studies have}} {{suggested}} that positron emission tomography is more accurate than computed tomography for the staging of non–small cell lung cancer and can reduce the rate of unnecessary thoracotomy in patients with potentially resectable disease. However, there are few data on the utility of positron emission tomography in the diagnosis of patients with tumors of 2 cm or less in size. MethodsPatients with cT 1 /cT 2 tumors of 2 cm or less in size were retrospectively reviewed. All had a computed tomographic scan, as well as a <b>positron</b> <b>emission</b> <b>tomographic</b> <b>scan</b> on a dedicated scanner, with a standard uptake value reported. A standard uptake value of 2. 5 g/mL or greater was considered positive. The results of computed tomography and positron emission tomography were correlated with pathologic results after either resection (n = 60) or mediastinoscopy (n = 4). ResultsSixty-four patients (38 women; mean age, 66 years) had a mean tumor size of 1. 4 cm (range, 0. 7 - 2. 0 cm). Forty-three patients had adenocarcinoma, 13 had adenocarcinoma–bronchioloalveolar carcinoma, 5 had squamous cell carcinoma, and 3 had other tumor types. Twenty-nine (45 %) tumors had negative positron emission tomographic results. Both tumor size (> 1 cm vs ≤ 1 cm) and cell type (adenocarcinoma−bronchioloalveolar carcinoma vs all other cell types) were significant predictors of positron emission tomography uptake in the primary tumor (P =. 05 and. 01, respectively). Nodal metastases were detected pathologically in 11 (17 %) patients (5 N 1 and 6 N 2). Positron emission tomographic sensitivity and specificity for nodal metastases were only 45 % and 89 %, respectively. There was no statistically demonstrable survival difference between positron emission tomography–positive and positron emission tomography–negative tumors (3 -year survival of 87 % vs 100 %, respectively).

METHODS: We stereotactically implanted quadripolar electrodes in both anterior limbs of the internal capsules into six patients with severe obsessive-compulsive disorder. Psychiatrists and psychologists performed a double-blind clinical assessment. A blinded random crossover design {{was used to assess}} four of those patients, who underwent continuous stimulation thereafter. RESULTS: The psychiatrist-rated Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale score was lower in the stimulation-on condition (mean, 19. 8 +/- 8. 0) than in the postoperative stimulator-off condition (mean, 32. 3 +/- 3. 9), and this stimulation-induced effect was maintained for at least 21 months after surgery. The Clinical Global Severity score decreased from 5 (severe; standard deviation, 0) in the stimulation-off condition to 3. 3 (moderate to moderate-severe; standard deviation, 0. 96) in the stimulation-on condition. The Clinical Global Improvement scores were unchanged in one patient and much improved in the other three during stimulation. During the stimulation-off period, symptom severity approached baseline levels in the four patients. Bilateral stimulation led to increased signal on functional magnetic resonance imaging studies, especially in the pons.

This study {{evaluated}} the safety, efficacy {{and validity of}} 6 -[18 F]fluorodopamine <b>positron</b> <b>emission</b> <b>tomographic</b> <b>scanning</b> of cardiac sympathetic innervation and function in humans. Methods. <b>Positron</b> <b>emission</b> <b>tomographic</b> (PET) <b>scans,</b> arterial blood and urine were obtained after a 3 -min intravenous infusion of 6 -[18 F]fluorodopamine (1 to 4 mCi, 188 to 809 mCi/mmol) in healthy volunteers, with or without pretreatment with oral desipramine to inhibit neuronal uptake of catecholamines. Results. 6 -[18 F]Fluorodopamine PET scanning visualized the left ventricular myocardium. Blood pressure increased slightly and transiently. The estimated absorbed radiation dose to the main target organ, {{the wall of the}} urinary bladder, was 0. 8 to 1. 0 rad/mCi of injected 6 -[18 F]fluorodopamine. By 24 h after the injection, the main 6 F-compound in urine was 6 F-vanillylmandelic acid, a metabolite of 6 F-norepinephrine. Desipramine attenuated accumulation of myocardial 6 -[18 F]fluorodopamine-derived radioactivity and plasma 6 Fdihydroxyphenylacetic acid. Conclusions. 6 -[18 F]Fluorodopamine produces negligible hemodynamic effects and acceptable radiation exposure at doses that visualize the left ventricular myocardium. Sympathetic nerves take up 6 -[18 F]fluorodopamine, which is translocated from the axoplasm into storage vesicles, where is it beta-hydroxylated to the fluorinated analogue of the sympathetic neurotransmitter norepinephrine. Therefore, the basis for visualization of myocardium after 6 -[18 F]fluorodopamine injection in humans is radiolabeling by 6 -[18 F]fluorodopamine and 6 -[18 F]fluoronorepinephrine of vesicles in sympathetic terminals. 6 -[18 F]Fluorodopamine PET scanning provides a novel means for assessing sympathetic innervation and function noninvasively in the human heart...|$|R

Test-retest tumor measurement reproducibility may vary considerably across serial scans on the same patient unless rigorous attention is paid to standardization of image acquisition parameters and unless measurements are made by trained, experienced observers using validated objective methods. Target lesion selection also must be done with care to choose lesions that are or will be reproducibly measurable. Likewise, new lesions will be missed or misinterpreted on follow-up imaging studies unless those imaging studies are obtained using techniques suitable for detecting early, small lesions. Reader variability is clearly a major component of the problem. The increasing availability of semiautomatic image processing algorithms will help ameliorate that issue. In addition, an array of internationally accepted guidelines, standards, and accreditation programs now exist to help address these problems...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Introduction Mixed {{warm and}} cold {{autoimmune}} hemolytic anemia runs a chronic course with severe intermittent exacerbations. Therapeutic {{options for the}} treatment of hemolysis associated with autoimmune hemolytic anemia are limited. There have been only two reported cases of the effective use of rituximab in the treatment of patients with mixed autoimmune hemolytic anemia. We report a case of severe mixed autoimmune hemolytic anemia that did not respond to steroids and responded to four weekly doses of rituximab (one cycle). Case presentation A 62 -year-old Caucasian man presented with dyspnea, jaundice and splenomegaly. His blood work revealed severe anemia (hemoglobin, 4. 9 g/dL) with biochemical evidence of hemolysis. Exposure to cold led to worsening of the patient's hemolysis and hemoglobinuria. A direct antiglobulin test was positive for immunoglobulin G and complement C 3 d, and cold agglutinins of immunoglobulin M type were detected. A bone marrow biopsy revealed erythroid hyperplasia. A <b>positron</b> <b>emission</b> <b>tomographic</b> <b>scan</b> showed no sites of pathologic uptake. There was no other evidence of a lymphoid or myeloid disorder. Initial therapy consisted of avoidance of cold, intravenous methylprednisolone and a trial of plasmapheresis. However, there was no clinically significant response, and the patient continued to be transfusion-dependent. He was then started on 375 mg/m 2 /week intravenous rituximab therapy. After two treatments, his hemoglobin stabilized and the transfusion requirement diminished. Rituximab was continued for a total of four weeks and led to the complete resolution of his hemolytic anemia and associated symptoms. At the patient's last visit, about two years after the initial rituximab treatment, he continued to be in complete remission. Conclusion To the best of our knowledge, this is the first reported case of mixed-type autoimmune hemolytic anemia that did not respond to steroid therapy but responded completely to only one cycle of rituximab. The previous two reports of rituximab use in mixed autoimmune hemolytic anemia described an initial brief response to steroids and the use of rituximab at the time of relapse. In both of these case reports, the response to one cycle of rituximab was short-lived and a second cycle of rituximab was required. Our case report demonstrates that severe hemolysis associated with mixed autoimmune hemolytic anemia can be unresponsive to steroid therapy and that a single cycle of rituximab may lead to prompt and durable complete remission. </p...|$|E

40|$|The {{distribution}} of fluconazole in tissue of human volunteers {{was determined by}} <b>positron</b> <b>emission</b> <b>tomographic</b> <b>scanning</b> over a 2 -h period following the infusion of a tracer dose of 18 F-fluconazole (5 to 7 mCi) plus 400 mg of unlabeled drug (the standard daily dose of fluconazole). Previous studies have validated this approach for animals. From serial <b>positron</b> <b>emission</b> <b>tomographic</b> imaging and blood sampling, pharmacokinetics of fluconazole in tissue were determined. There was significant {{distribution of}} the radiolabeled drug in all organs studied, with nearly constant levels achieved by 1 h. Plateau concentrations of fluconazole in key organs (micrograms per gram) included the following: whole brain, 4. 92 +/- 0. 17; heart, 6. 98 +/- 0. 20; lung, 7. 81 +/- 0. 46; liver, 12. 94 +/- 0. 24; spleen, 22. 96 +/- 2. 5; kidney, 11. 23 +/- 0. 61; prostate, 8. 24 +/- 0. 58; and blood, 3. 76 +/- 0. 30. Since levels of fluconazole of > 6 micrograms/g are needed to treat infection with most strains of Candida and levels of > 10 micrograms/g are needed for Cryptococcus neoformans, Coccidioides immitis, and Histoplasma capsulatum, the following predictions can be made. The current standard dose of 400 mg/day should be more than adequate {{in the treatment of}} urinary tract and hepatosplenic candidiasis but problematic in the treatment of candidal osteomyelitis, even with the higher levels that develop after multiple doses. Similarly, higher doses should be considered, particularly in immunocompromised patients, with infection with C. neoformans, H. capsulatum, and C. immitis that involves the central nervous and musculoskeletal systems...|$|R
40|$|Context: The {{dopamine}} overactivity {{hypothesis of}} schizophrenia {{remains one of}} the most influential theories of the pathophysiology of the illness. Radiotracer brain imaging studies are now directly testing aspects of the overactivity hypothesis. Objective: To assess presynaptic dopaminergic function in a large cohort of patients with schizophrenia by means of [18 F]fluorodopa uptake and a high-sensitivity 3 -dimensional <b>positron</b> <b>emission</b> tomograph. We predicted elevations in striatal [18 F]fluorodopa uptake and reductions in prefrontal cortical [18 F]fluorodopa uptake in patients with schizophrenia. Design: Case-control study. Setting Research institute investigation recruiting hospital outpatients. Patients Sixteen male medicated hospital outpatients with a DSM-IV diagnosis of schizophrenia (mean age, 38 years) and 12 age-matched male volunteers free of psychiatric and neurologic illness. Intervention [18 F]fluorodopa <b>positron</b> <b>emission</b> <b>tomographic</b> <b>scanning.</b> Main Outcome Measure [18 F]fluorodopa uptake constant Ki measured with statistical parametric mapping and region-of-interest analyses. Results Statistical parametric mapping (P<. 05 corrected) and region-of-interest analyses (P<. 01) showed increased [18 F]fluorodopa uptake, confined primarily to the ventral striatum in patients with schizophrenia. No reductions in prefrontal cortical [18 F]fluorodopa uptake Ki were seen in the statistical parametric mapping and region-of-interest analyses, although dorsal anterior cingulate [18 F]fluorodopa Ki correlated with performance on the Stroop Color-Word Test in both groups. Conclusions As in studies in unmedicated patients, presynaptic striatal dopamine dysfunction is present in medicated schizophrenic patients, adding further in vivo support for dopamine overactivity in the illness...|$|R
40|$|ObjectivesThis report characterizes a {{syndrome}} of granulomatous infiltration presenting as sustained monomorphic {{ventricular tachycardia}} (SMVT) with mediastinal adenopathy {{in patients with}} preserved ventricular function. BackgroundUnlike truly idiopathic ventricular tachycardia, SMVT due to granulomatous infiltration responds poorly to radiofrequency ablation and has a poor prognosis. MethodsPatients without obstructive coronary artery disease and with normal ventricular function presenting with SMVT other than posterior fascicular morphology were evaluated. Computed chest tomograms, cardiac magnetic resonance imaging, and 18 -fluorodeoxyglucose <b>positron</b> <b>emission</b> <b>tomographic</b> <b>scans</b> (18 FDG PET-CT) were performed. Significant lymph nodes were evaluated for tuberculosis and sarcoidosis. Initial treatment included antiarrhythmic drugs ± radiofrequency ablation. Additionally, patients with evidence of tuberculosis received anti-tuberculosis therapy; the rest were treated as sarcoidosis. ResultsMediastinal adenopathy with mid-myocardial scar and/or focal myocardial inflammation was observed in 14 patients; lymph nodes revealed noncaseating granulomas in all. Evidence of tuberculosis was present in 79 %. During follow-up (median duration 25 months), SMVT recurred despite initial treatment in 92 %. Addition of disease-specific therapy abolished further recurrences in 64 % of them. Decrease in SMVT correlated with resolution of myocardial inflammation on serial 18 FDG PET-CTs. Appropriate therapies occurred in 67 % of patients receiving implantable cardioverter-defibrillators. ConclusionsA subset of patients with SMVT with preserved ventricular function has a syndrome of arrhythmogenic myocarditis with granulomatous mediastinal adenopathy due to myocardial tuberculosis or cardiac sarcoidosis. This entity is optimally managed {{with a combination of}} disease-specific therapy and antiarrhythmic measures...|$|R
40|$|Hypothesis: There is {{no utility}} of PET {{as part of}} a routine metastatic survey in {{patients}} with T 2 to T 4 melanoma. Design Retrospective review of a cohort study between December 1998 and July 2004. Setting University hospital tertiary care center. Patients and Methods There were 64 patients with T 2 to T 4 melanomas who underwent PET for detection of occult metastases at our institution. All patients underwent surgical excision of the primary lesion and sentinel lymph node dissection. Data included were pathologic findings of the primary lesion and sentinel lymph nodes, laboratory data, and radiological reports. None of the patients had clinically suspected regional or distant metastases prior to PET. The diagnostic yield of PET was evaluated through retrospective analysis. Positive scans were then correlated for accuracy with follow-up imaging, biopsy, and clinical information when available. Results: <b>Positron</b> <b>emission</b> tomography did not reveal occult distant metastases in any of the patients. <b>Positron</b> <b>emission</b> <b>tomographic</b> <b>scans</b> showed no abnormalities in 94 % of these patients. In 2 patients (3 %), false-positive findings were reported on PET (muscular activity and intranodal melanocytic nevocellular inclusion). Further, PET was not useful in predicting regional lymph node metastases. Nineteen of 64 patients had positive sentinel lymph nodes, and only 2 (11 %) were identified on PET. Overall, PET did not change clinical management in any of the patients. Conclusions: This study suggests no utility for PET in the detection of occult metastases in patients at initial diagnosis of melanoma. Omission of PET imaging from preoperative evaluations for patients with melanoma is recommended...|$|R
40|$|Background: Gantenerumab is a fully human anti-Aβmonoclonal {{antibody}} {{in clinical}} {{development for the}} treatment of Alzheimer disease (AD). Objectives: To investigate whether treatment with gantenerumab leads to a measurable reduction in the level of Aβ amyloid in the brain and to elucidate the mechanism of amyloid reduction. Design: A multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, ascending-dose <b>positron</b> <b>emission</b> <b>tomographic</b> study. Additionally, ex vivo studies of human brain slices from an independent sample of patients who had AD were performed. Setting: Three university medical centers. Patients: Patients with mild-to-moderate AD. Intervention: Two consecutive cohorts of patients received 2 to 7 infusions of intravenous gantenerumab (60 or 200 mg) or placebo every 4 weeks. Brain slices from patients who had AD were coincubated with gantenerumab at increasing concentrations and with human microglial cells. Main Outcome Measures: Percent change in the ratio of regional carbon 11 -labeled Pittsburgh Compound B retention in vivo and semiquantitative assessment of gantenerumab-induced phagocytosis ex vivo. Results: Sixteen patients with end-of-treatment <b>positron</b> <b>emission</b> <b>tomographic</b> <b>scans</b> were included in the analysis. The mean (95 % CI) percent change from baseline difference relative to placebo (n= 4) in cortical brain amyloid level was - 15. 6 % (95 % CI, - 42. 7 to 11. 6) for the 60 -mg group (n= 6) and - 35. 7 % (95 % CI, - 63. 5 to - 7. 9) for the 200 -mg group (n= 6). Two patients in the 200 -mg group showed transient and focal areas of inflammation or vasogenic edema on magnetic resonance imaging scans at sites with the highest level of amyloid reduction. Gantenerumab induced phagocytosis of human amyloid in a dose-dependent manner ex vivo. Conclusion: Gantenerumab treatment resulted in a dose-dependent reduction in brain amyloid level, possibly through an effector cell-mediated mechanism of action. © 2012 American Medical Association.

40|$|ObjectiveSurgical {{resection}} is {{the standard}} of care for stage I non–small cell lung cancer. The objective {{of this study was}} to evaluate computed tomography–guided radiofrequency ablation as an alternative treatment option for high-risk patients with stage I non–small lung cancer. MethodsPatients with medically inoperable stage I non–small lung cancer were offered radiofrequency ablation. Thoracic surgeons evaluated and performed radiofrequency ablation under computed <b>tomographic</b> <b>scanning</b> guidance. Response was assessed by means of computed <b>tomographic</b> and <b>positron</b> <b>emission</b> <b>tomographic</b> <b>scanning.</b> Time to progression and survival were monitored every 3 months. ResultsNineteen patients underwent radiofrequency ablation over a 3 -year period. There were 8 men and 11 women with a median age of 78 years (range, 68 - 88 years). Radiofrequency ablation resulted in pneumothorax requiring a pigtail catheter in 12 (63 %) patients. An initial complete response was observed in 2 (10. 5 %) patients, a partial response in 10 (53 %) patients, and stable disease in 5 (26 %) patients. Early progression occurred in 2 (10. 5 %) patients. During follow-up, local progression occurred in 8 (42 %) nodules, and the median time to progression was 27 months. There were no procedure-related mortalities, and 6 deaths occurred during follow-up. The mean follow-up in the remaining patients was 29 months (range, 9 - 52 months). The probability of survival at 1 year was estimated to be 95 % (95 % confidence interval, 0. 85 - 1. 0). The median survival was not reached. ConclusionOur experience indicates that radiofrequency ablation is safe in high-risk patients with stage I non–small lung cancer, with reasonable results in patients who are not fit for surgical intervention...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVE AND IMPORTANCE: Lhermitte-Duclos disease (LDD) {{represents}} a focally indolent dysplastic {{growth of the}} cerebellar cortex. The 106 cases reported previously in the literature show an extremely slow evolution, and the operative indications and techniques for this disease entity are still controversial. The authors present the first case of LDD studied with <b>positron</b> <b>emission</b> tomography using the labeled tracers [(18) F] 2 -fluoro- 2 -deoxy-d-glucose ([(18) F]FDG) and (11) C-labeled methionine ([(11) C]Met) to study the glucose and protein metabolism of the lesion. CLINICAL PRESENTATION: A 40 -year-old woman suddenly became unconscious then completely recovered 5 minutes later. Magnetic resonance imaging of her brain showed a well-delineated 10 x 5 -cm abnormal area with enlarged cerebellar folia, {{which led to the}} diagnosis of LDD. TECHNIQUE: On <b>positron</b> <b>emission</b> <b>tomographic</b> <b>scans,</b> [(18) F]FDG and [(11) C]Met uptake in the normal cerebral and cerebellar cortex appeared higher than normal, reaching levels found in patients with primary malignant brain tumors. Moreover, the uptake of both tracers was heterogeneous, in contrast to the homogeneous uptake visualized on magnetic resonance imaging scans. The areas of greatest [(11) C]Met and [(18) F]FDG uptake were discordant. Some areas of greater than normal [(18) F]FDG uptake corresponded to areas of moderate or low [(11) C]Met uptake. Because of the important mass effect in the posterior fossa, total surgical resection was performed. A histological examination confirmed the diagnosis of LDD. CONCLUSION: This first reported metabolic study of LDD supports the view that LDD is an active and evolving disease. These data should prompt reevaluation of the indications for surgery in patients with this disease as well as the timing of surgery. Case ReportsJournal Articleinfo:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|R
40|$|ObjectivesOur {{objective}} {{was to determine the}} long-term survival of patients with resected synchronous multiple pulmonary malignant tumors. MethodsThis is a multi-institutional retrospective study of patients who underwent surgical resection of synchronous (nonbronchioloalveolar) non–small cell lung cancer. ResultsBetween March 1996 and December 2009, 67 patients (30 men) underwent 121 operations. Forty-four patients had bilateral tumors. <b>Positron</b> <b>emission</b> <b>tomographic</b> <b>scans</b> were performed in 58 (87 %) patients, computed <b>tomographic</b> <b>scans</b> and magnetic resonance imaging of the brain in 53 (79 %), and mediastinoscopy in 56 (84 %). N 2 lymph nodes were benign in all patients before undergoing resection of bilateral tumors of the same histologic type. Types of resection were lobectomy in 62, sublobar in 73, and pneumonectomy in 1. Eleven patients (16 %) had postoperative morbidities. Cancer-specific 3 - and 5 -year survivals were 73 % and 69 %, respectively, and overall 3 - and 5 -year survivals were 64 % and 53 %, respectively. Subgroup analysis demonstrated no difference in overall survival at 5 years between bilateral tumors of the same histologic type (M 1 a) (49 %) versus different histologic types 42 % (P = . 88), or between bilateral tumors (50 %) and ipsilateral tumors (54 %) (P = . 83). ConclusionsThe 5 -year survival of surgically resected, synchronous, N 2 -negative, nonbronchioloalveolar, non–small cell lung cancer is excellent, even in patients who have bilateral lung lesions that harbor the same histologic features. Although the new TNM classification system labels this disease as clinical stage IV M 1 a, survival acts more like a separate T 1 lesion after surgical resection. Thus, surgical resection should be considered in appropriately selected patients who have multiple pulmonary malignant tumors that are N 2 negative...|$|R
40|$|Total and {{regional}} cerebral glucose metabolism (CMRgl) {{was measured by}} <b>positron</b> <b>emission</b> tomography with 2 -(F- 18) fluoro- 2 -deoxy-D-glucose ((18) FDG) in 20 term infants with hypoxic ischemic encephalopathy (HIE) after perinatal asphyxia. All infants had signs of perinatal distress, and 15 were severely acidotic at birth. Six infants developed mild HIE, twelve moderate HIE, and two severe HIE during their first days of life. The <b>positron</b> <b>emission</b> <b>tomographic</b> <b>scans</b> were performed at 4 - 24 d of age (median, 11 d). One hour before scanning, 2 - 3. 7 MBq/kg (54 - 100 µCi/kg) (18) FDG was injected i. v. No sedation was used. Quantification of CMRgl {{was based on a}} new method employing the glucose metabolism of the erythrocytes, requiring only one blood sample. In all infants, the most metabolically active brain areas were the deep subcortical parts, thalamus, basal ganglia, and sensorimotor cortex. Frontal, temporal, and parietal cortex were less metabolically active in all infants. Total CMRgl was inversely correlated with the severity of HIE (p mol. min(- 1). 100 g(- 1), 11 with moderate HIE had 26. 6 (13. 0 - 65. 1) µmol. min(- 1). 100 g(- 1), and two with severe HIE had 10. 4 and 15. 0 µmol. min(- 1). 100 g(- 1), respectively. Five of six infants who developed cerebral palsy had a mean (range) CMRgl of 18. 1 (10. 2 - 31. 4) µmol. min(- 1). 100 g(- 1) compared with 41. 5 (13. 0 - 100. 8) µmol. min(- 1). 100 g(- 1) in the infants with no neurologic sequela at 2 y. We conclude that CMRgl measured during the subacute period after perinatal asphyxia in term infants is highly correlated with the severity of HIE and short-term outcome...|$|R
