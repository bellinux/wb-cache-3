40|$|The {{addition}} of Nb significantly retards recovery and recrystallization through solute drag and precipitation pinning effects. It {{is important to}} describe the precipitation behaviour precisely because finely distributed precipitates retard the restoration process abruptly. The isothermal precipitation behaviour has been studied frequently. However, during industrial hot deformation processing, the temperature decreases continuously, so that isothermal data cannot be applied directly to predict the precipitation under these conditions. The focus {{of this study is}} therefore on the CCP (Continuous-Cooling-Precipitation) behaviour of Nb <b>carbonitride</b> <b>in</b> <b>austenite.</b> To calculate the CCP behaviour, isothermal PTT (Precipitation-Time-Temperature) data in terms of the P$ sb{ rm s}$ (precipitation start) and P$ sb{ rm f}$ (precipitation finish) times are first required. In 1987, Dutta and Sellars developed a thermodynamic model to predict P$ sb{ rm s}$ times for the precipitation of niobium <b>carbonitride,</b> and <b>in</b> 1989, Liu and Jonas developed a model for titanium <b>carbonitride.</b> <b>In</b> the present work, the L-J (Liu-Jonas) model is used to calculate the P$ sb{ rm s}$ time at a given temperature from experimental data. Since the prediction models are only limited to the P$ sb{ rm s}$ times, a new calculation method for the P$ sb{ rm f}$ time, based on reaction kinetics and classical nucleation and growth theory, is proposed in this study. Two models are developed to follow the precipitation process, and the time exponent and rate constant for the kinetics are formulated for each model. The additivity rule, which was developed by Scheil in 1935, is then used to calculate the extent of precipitation during continuous cooling. Isothermal precipitation rates for 0. 040 % Nb steels are measured experimentally by the stress relaxation method. The CCP behaviour is then calculated and is then examined by continuous cooling testing, using a hot deformation dilatometer. Precipitates are observed by transmission electron microscopy of specimens quenched after a period of cooling at various cooling rates. The P$ sb{ rm s}$ and P$ sb{ rm f}$ times estimated from the particle size data show good agreement with the calculated CCP behaviour...|$|R

40|$|Precipitation {{sequence}} under tempering in a 10 %Cr steel {{has been}} considered in details. Two different precipitation processes have been identified, concurrently. First, at 350 °C, a dispersion of M 2 C phase with orthorhombic lattice appears. At 525 °C, the M 2 C phase is displaced by the formation of M 23 C 6 carbide. However, this process remains uncompleted. Dissolution of M 2 C phase occurs completely due to the for-mation and growth of more stable M 6 C phase {{as a result of}} tempering in the range of 650 to 770 °C.

40|$|Abstract A {{structural}} steel, 35 CrMoV steel, {{has been}} attempted firstly by explosive powder compaction followed by sintering (EPC-sintering). The nitrogen {{content of the}} steel was 0. 15 wt%, which was accordant with the definition of high nitrogen steel (HNS). The final density of the EPC-sintering steel was only about 6. 9 g/cm 3, which indicated that the processing parameters must be modulated further. In the sample of this steel, some radial cracks were found around {{the center of the}} cross-section of the steel, resulting in no mechanical tests carrying out.

40|$|AbstractEffect of {{nitrogen}} on the creep deformation behaviour and the dislocation substructure development and precipitation on creep exposure in 316 LN {{austenitic stainless steel}} has been studied. Four heats of the steel with nitrogen in the range 0. 07 - 0. 22 wt. % were melted Creep tests on the steels were carried out at 923 K over a stress range of 140 - 225 MPa. Norton's law (έ = Aσn) relating steady state creep rate with applied stress was found to obey by the steels. The power law exponent ‘n’ was found to decrease from 13. 6 to 5. 5 {{with the increase in}} nitrogen content. Transmission electron microscopic studies were carried out on the creep tested steels to understand the evolution of dislocation substructure on creep exposure. Dislocations were observed to have rearranged in the form of subgrains in the material containing 0. 07 wt. % nitrogen. The tendency to form subgrain decreased with the increase in nitrogen content.

40|$|Stress {{relaxation}} {{measurements were}} carried out on a plain carbon and four Ti steels over the temperature range 850 to 1050 $ sp circ$C. The {{results show that the}} stress relaxation of plain carbon austenite after a 5 % prestrain can be described by the relation $ sigma$ = $ sigma sb 0 $-$ alpha$ln(1 + $ beta$t). By contrast, in the solution-treated Ti steels, relaxation is arrested at the start of precipitation and is resumed when precipitation is complete. As a result, this new mechanical method is suitable for following <b>carbonitride</b> precipitation <b>in</b> microalloyed <b>austenite</b> at hot working temperatures. PTT diagrams were determined by the present technique for the steels containing 0. 05, 0. 11, 0. 18 and 0. 25 % Ti. The PTT curves obtained are C shaped for all the steels. The upper parts of these curves are shifted to significantly longer times as the Ti and C concentrations are reduced. By contrast, the positions of the lower arms of the curves are relatively independent of the current values of the solubility product (Ti) (C). This phenomenon is attributed to the catalytic effect of trace amounts of dissolved N on the nucleation rate of Ti(CN) <b>in</b> <b>austenite.</b> Changes <b>in</b> the size distribution and morphology of the precipitates during relaxation of the 0. 25 % Ti steel were followed by means of electron microscopy.

Finally, the experimental results are compared with the predictions of classical nucleation theory and of the diffusion controlled particle growth theory. Good agreement was obtained between the predictions of the theories and the experimental results. It is demonstrated by means of the thermodynamic analysis of nucleation that the Ti(CN) precipitate/austenite interface is of a semi-coherent nature.

40|$|Two {{aspects of}} {{mechanical}} property improvement in vanadium and niobium H. S. L. A. steels have been investigated. They are, dispersion hardening of the ferrite by fine <b>carbonitride</b> <b>precipitates</b> and, secondly, grain refinement {{of the final}} ferrite/pearlite structure. The investigation involved {{the study of the}} morphologies of ferrite and <b>carbonitride</b> <b>precipitates</b> <b>in</b> laboratory treated and in commercially hot-rolled samples of vanadium, niobium and vanadium-niobium steels. Ferrite grain morphologies were compared with prior austenite grain structures to elucidate the mechanisms of grain refinement accompanying the polymorphic transformation. Commercial steels were used in this investigation rather than the higher alloy analogues often used in previous investigations. It was confirmed that fine precipitate dispersions significantly improved the strength of the vanadium and niobium H. S. L. A. steels and that precipitation of these carbonitrides often occurred at the migrating austenite/ferrite interface. Alloy carbonitride precipitation associated with ferrite formation from undeformed (recrystallised) austenite was generally consistent with either the Interphase Precipitation Planar model or Interphase Precipitation Curved model proposed for higher alloy steels by other investigators. These mechanisms, which are respectively associated with coherent and incoherent interphase boundaries, lead to layers of particles with spacings and regularity which vary with transformation conditions. Although a general correspondence was established between precipitate modes in the H. S. L. A. steels and higher alloy steels, the lower volume fraction of precipitate in the H. S. L. A. steels precluded the operation of the 2 ̆ 2 quasi-ledge 2 ̆ 2 mechanism proposed for higher alloy steels. Where the austenite grain size prior to transformation was large, or the reduction small, complete transformation could not be achieved by the 2 ̆ 2 cascade nucleation 2 ̆ 2 process and coarse intragranular ferrite resulted, giving rise to mixed ferrite grain size structures. The influence of prior austenite grain size on grain refinement of the ferrite was examined by means of measurements of grain size distributions <b>in</b> <b>austenite</b> and ferrite. Finer ferrite grain structures resulted from deformation and subsequent transformation of smaller austenite grains. This grain refinement did not result principally from a reduction in size of the small ferrite grains nucleated at, and adjacent to, the austenite grain boundaries, but by {{an increase in the number}} of these small grains at the expense of coarse intragranular ferrite grains. Ferrite grain size distributions in both laboratory rolled and commercially rolled steels were heavily skewed to larger grain sizes, but were not consistent with a log-normal distribution. The numerical mean grain size of the ferrite was found to be a poor indicator of ferrite grain structures in these steels and it is proposed that a more appropriate characterisation of ferrite grain structures is provided by mean grain sizes weighted in terms of surface area or volume. Carbonitride precipitation was found to influence ferrite grain structure development in two ways. Firstly, pinning due to precipitates on the austenite sub-structure, together with solute redistribution and precipitation at the interphase boundary, can exert retarding effects on ferrite growth during the polymorphic transformation, indirectly enhancing grain refinement by allowing activation of additional ferrite nucleation sites. Secondly, in the commercially hot-rolled steels, ferrite grain shape anisotropy was observed which was associated with retardation of ferrite growth perpendicular to the rolling plane by precipitates on the elongated substructure of deformed austenite. The same modes of interphase precipitation were also observed on transformation of deformed (unrecrystallised) <b>austenite,</b> but <b>in</b> this case the dispersions were characterised by significantly finer particle sizes and sheet spacings, as well as a general loss of regularity of the layered structure. Examination of the commercially hot-rolled strip indicated that not all of the available vanadium and niobium <b>carbonitride</b> <b>precipitated</b> <b>in</b> the steel during the polymorphic transformation and thus the full strengthening potential was not achieved. Higher strengths were obtained by cooling rapidly to approximately 600 °C to suppress interphase precipitation and then allowing fine multivariant precipitation to occur in situ in ferrite during ageing. Nucleation of ferrite grains was observed to occur preferentially at grain boundaries, deformation bands and deformed twin boundaries. The nucleation frequency at prior austenite grain boundaries was shown to increase rapidly with deformation, even for light reductions, but approached a limiting value at higher reductions. Further transformation proceeded by the 2 ̆ 2 cascade nucleation 2 ̆ 2 process in which renucleation of ferrite occurs at, or just ahead of, the advancing austenite/ferrite interface <b>in</b> the deformed <b>austenite.</b> The extent of 2 ̆ 2 cascade nucleation 2 ̆ 2 was found to increase with increasing reduction. On the basis of the present work it is proposed that the effects of interfacial drag by precipitates on the austenite sub-structure and the sideways impingement of the growing ferrite grains can combine to temporarily immobilise the advancing ferrite growth front, allowing renucleation of ferrite grains at adjacent austenite subgrain boundaries or, more probably, at the interface between austenite and ferrite grain boundary cusps, arising from grain interface junctions. Higher strains <b>in</b> the <b>austenite</b> favour extension of the cascade nucleation into the grain interior because of the generation of both finer particles which more strongly retard ferrite growth and higher stored strain energy which enhances nucleation of ferrite...|$|R

To describe diffusional transformations in substitution alloys, we derive the "quasi-equilibrium" kinetic equation which generalizes its earlier versions by {{taking into account}} possible "interaction renormalization" effects. For the interstitial alloys Me-X, we derive the explicit expression for the diffusivity D of an interstitial atom X which notably differs from those used in previous phenomenological treatments. This microscopic expression for D is applied to describe the diffusion of carbon <b>in</b> <b>austenite</b> basing on some simple models of carbon-carbon interaction. The results obtained enable us to make certain conclusions about the real form of these interactions, and about {{the scale of the}} "transition state entropy" for diffusion of carbon <b>in</b> <b>austenite.</b> Comment: 26 pages, 5 postscript figures, LaTe...|$|R
40|$|Upper bainite, lower bainite and {{granular}} structure in isothermally treated steels have all themselves C curves. A single microstructure is always {{produced in the}} primary stage, whereas the nearby two-microstructure complex is usually produced in the medium or final stage of the transformation. Only a single microstructure and Arrhenius equation must be used to deduce the overall activation energy for the transformation product. A combination of overall activation energy, morphology and free energy curve can explain the bainitic transformation mechanism and {{granular structure}} formation mechanism. The former follows military atom diffusionless martensite-like shear, which occurred in carbon-depleted region controlled by carbon atom diffusion <b>in</b> <b>austenite,</b> and the latter results from civilian atom diffusionless interface control transformation, which occurred in the most carbon-depleted region controlled by carbon atom diffusion <b>in</b> <b>austenite...</b>|$|R
40|$|Abstract. As for the techno-interface of CC-HR region, the {{precipitation}} and {{dissolution of}} <b>carbonitride</b> <b>in</b> Nb micro-alloyed steel E 36 were studied during continuous casting, roller conveying, stack cooling, heat-preserved and heating units in typical slab process flow by hot simulation experiment based on study of heat transfer. The results are as follows: Ti(C,N), and (Ti,Nb) (C,N) precipitate in turn in continuous casting and conveying. A few (Ti,Nb) (C,N) particles are not solid solute completely after heating. The precipitation of carbonitride is effected significantly by different cooling rate in conveying. When slab conveied {{at the rate}} of 6. 00 ˚C/min and then cooled down to 600 ˚C, the distribution density of carbonitride particles is higher, and the average equivalent diameter of carbonitride particles is smaller, some carbonitride particles distribute along the austenitic grain boundaries and the generation elements of carbonitride particles are under over-saturation state. When slab conveyed {{at the rate of}} 0. 30 ˚C/min or 0. 15 ˚C/min and then cooled down to 400 ˚C, the distribution density of carbonitride particles is lower, and the average equivalent diameter of carbonitride particles is bigger, the <b>carbonitride</b> particles <b>precipitate</b> fully. The behavior of <b>carbonitride</b> <b>in</b> slab are effected by different thermal history in heating. The status of carbonitride is effected insignificantly by different thermal history after heating...|$|R
