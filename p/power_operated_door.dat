50|$|In February 1964, {{the first}} of 120 double deck {{trailers}} was delivered by Tulloch Limited to the New South Wales Government Railways. These were purchased to replace wooden carriage stock from Sydney's suburban fleet. The first 40 were built with <b>power</b> <b>operated</b> <b>doors</b> to <b>operate</b> with the Sputnik power cars, the remaining 80 were fitted with manually <b>operated</b> <b>doors</b> for operation with the Suburban and Tulloch stock.|$|R

50|$|Between 1956 and 1960, 40 power {{cars and}} 40 trailer cars were built by Commonwealth Engineering for the New South Wales Government Railways. Broadly {{similar to the}} Tulloch built carriages, built earlier in the 1950s, they {{differed}} in having motors on all four (as opposed to two) bogies and <b>power</b> <b>operated</b> <b>doors.</b> They <b>operated</b> as eight carriage sets and were targeted as S sets, gaining the nickname Sputniks after the Russian satellite that was launched {{at the same time}} as their entry into service.|$|R

5000|$|From 1910 over {{a hundred}} ACP {{carriages}} were built, intended for later conversion to electric traction. The [...] "P" [...] suffix to the code indicated the central corridor running {{the length of the}} eight passenger compartments, though this did not connect with the guards' area at one end. The suburban electric multiple unit fleet was provided with guards accommodation from the introduction of the Swing Door and Tait trains in 1919, both having a two-man crew with a motorman (driver) and guard. Communication bells between driver and guard were not provided until the Harris trains of 1956, eliminating the use of green flags to indicated 'right of way' for departure from stations. [...] The later Harris trains were also the first to introduce guard controlled <b>power</b> <b>operated</b> <b>doors</b> to Victorian passenger trains, this being continued on the Hitachi trains of 1972.|$|R
50|$|Until {{the arrival}} of the Flexity trams in 2005, H1 type car 381 was the most modern tram in Adelaide.Originally part of an order for 40 H1 type cars, 381 was just {{completed}} by JA Lawton & Sons of Adelaide when the reconstitution of the MTT caused cancellation of the remaining thirty-nine cars. A partly constructed 382 was scrapped before it was completed {{as a result of the}} change in policy. Like the H type upon which 381 was based on, it was fitted with PC5L2 type controllers although in this case, they were taken out of F1 type tram 264 (more details to be found in the F1 type section). Originally fitted with a standard link and pin type coupler, 381 was later fitted with a Tomlinson automatic style coupler (although it was not able to operate in multiple with the H type). <b>Power</b> <b>operated</b> <b>doors</b> were also fitted.|$|R
5000|$|The trains were to use {{equipment}} {{based on}} the British Rail Mark 4 coaches modified for long distance service. All the cars were air-conditioned with <b>power</b> <b>operated</b> <b>doors</b> and {{designed to meet the}} safety standards of each country they would run through, the most stringent of these requirements being for the Channel Tunnel. A fleet of 139 cars were originally ordered, broken down as 47 seated cars, 72 sleeper cars and 20 service vehicles. The cars would have normally been configured as 9 seven-car and 9 eight-car sub-sets, with four spares (two seated cars and two service vehicles). The trains would have run as either individual sub-sets (for beyond London services and to some European destinations), or as two sets coupled together (from London and through the Tunnel). As the trains were designed to run as fixed formation sub-sets, only the two outer ends of each sub-set had buffers and draw gear. The sub-sets would have been configured as follows: ...|$|R

5000|$|The Liverpool Overhead Railway {{opened on}} 6 March 1893 with 2-car {{electric}} multiple units, {{the first to}} operate in the world. Each lightweight car had a [...] motor that took power from a third rail. In 1902 these were replaced with two [...] motors, which reduced the travel time. After 1945 some trains were modernised, replacing the timber body with aluminium and plywood and fitting <b>power</b> <b>operated</b> sliding <b>doors</b> under control of the guard. The trains were all removed from service when the railway closed in 1956.

5000|$|Between 1926 and 1960, a {{total of}} 417 motor cars and 417 trailer cars were built by various {{contractors}} including Leeds Forge Company, Walsh Island Dockyard, Clyde Engineering, Tulloch Limited and Comeng. The pre-war [...] "1927 type" [...] cars were known as the [...] "Standard" [...] cars as they dominated the suburban fleet, and featured First and Second Class travel until 1 January 1940. More cars (the majority being trailer cars), were delivered by Tulloch Limited between 1940 and 1957 to cater for system expansion, and to replace many of the decrepit Wooden trailer cars. The 80 cars built by Comeng from 1957 to 1960 (40 motor and 40 trailer cars) {{became known as the}} Sputnik cars. They had 4 single <b>power</b> <b>operated</b> <b>doors</b> on each side and were of spot-welded construction. These cars were introduced at the time of electrification extension from Parramatta to Penrith. One 8-car set of Tulloch cars was fitted with power-doors and ran from 1956 to 1976 as set F39. Between 1968 & 1973, 97 Standard & Tulloch motor-cars were converted from two to four motors on new air-ride bogies for better performance and adhesion, starting with C7500 (ex C3500). These single deck electric multiple unit (EMU) sets were the backbone of the Sydney suburban network until the stainless-steel double deck cars of the S (and later C, K & R) sets took over. The last of the Sputniks had their final retirement in 1993. Many cars were painted blue & white during the PTC years from 1972 onwards, and the last blue & white cars were repainted in 1987. Several cars were fitted with Beclawat sliding windows during overhauls as a cost-cutting measure (see photo). After 1976, they carried a deep 'Indian Red' livery until their retirement. In 1991, one eight-car set H22 was painted in a special livery to promote Taronga Zoo. Two power-door W-sets were painted in special liveries for the Zoo (W1) and to mark Sydney's Sesqicentenary (W2). Many of the motor cars were marshalled with the Tulloch double deck trailer cars (see below) to form 4 or 8 car mixed single and double deck sets. In their final years, these cars became associated with the term 'red rattlers' by the State Government and the media, due to way the windows and window shutters rattled in their frames. On 10th June 2016, Preserved cars C7396, T4527, C3218 and C3426 were returned to operational status by Sydney Trains in conjunction with Historic Electric Traction. This train set, now known as Red Set F1, operates occasional special passenger trips through Transport Heritage NSW. At 90 years of age, Set F1 is now among the oldest fully operating electric train sets in the world.|$|R

50|$|In 1938, forty-eight {{of these}} cars were rebuilt when the District line was standardising its post-1923 stock and were {{reclassified}} as Q23 Stock.

Different flashes and beeps are emitted to alert passengers when the doors are activated or closing. The display that informs passengers that the doors have been released has also been changed to reflect the upgrade. Parts of the interior have all been painted bright yellow such as the doors and poles inside the train, for higher visibility and enhanced safety.|$|R

50|$|The Q Stock {{consisted}} of various District line trains built from 1923 (G Stock) until the mid-1930s, originally built with manually <b>operated</b> sliding <b>doors.</b> Following conversion to air <b>operated</b> <b>doors,</b> the trains became collectively known as Q Stock. Given that five {{different types of}} rolling stock were converted to Q Stock, the resulting hybrid trains looked bizarre - with the older carriages having flat sides and clerestory roofs, whilst the Q38 had flared sides at floor level.|$|R

40|$|An {{electronic}} {{position sensor}} {{for use with}} a <b>power</b> <b>operated</b> vehicle accessory, such as a power liftgate. The position sensor includes an elongated resistive circuit that is mounted such that it is stationary and extends along {{the path of a}} track portion of the <b>power</b> <b>operated</b> accessory. The position sensor further includes a contact nub mounted to a link member that moves within the track portion such that the contact nub is slidingly biased against the elongated circuit. As the link member moves under the force of a motor-driven output gear, the contact nub slides along the surface of the resistive circuit, thereby affecting the overall resistance of the circuit. The position sensor uses the overall resistance to provide an electronic position signal to an ECU, wherein the signal is indicative of the absolute position of the <b>power</b> <b>operated</b> accessory. Accordingly, the electronic position sensor is capable of providing an electronic signal that enables the ECU to track the absolute position of the <b>power</b> <b>operated</b> accessory...|$|R
