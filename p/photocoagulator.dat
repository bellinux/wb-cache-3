40|$|Since its {{discovery}} in the 1940 s, retinal photocoagulation has evolved immensely. Although the first <b>photocoagulators</b> utilised incandescent light, {{it was the}} invention of laser that instigated {{the widespread use of}} photocoagulation for treatment of retinal diseases. Laser permits choice of electromagnetic wavelength in addition to temporal delivery methods such as continuous and micropulse modes. These variables are crucial for accurate targeting of retinal tissue and prevention of detrimental side effects such as central blind spots. Laser photocoagulation is the mainstay of treatment for proliferative diabetic retinopathy amongst many other retinal conditions. Considering the escalating prevalence of diabetes mellitus, it is important for physicians to grasp the basic principles and be aware of new developments in retinal laser therapy...|$|R
40|$|Our modern-day {{therapeutic}} {{approach to}} managing neovascular age-related macular degeneration (NVAMD) is overwhelmingly via anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (anti-VEGF) strategies [1 - 4]. There {{are at least}} two mecha-nisms in which these agents achieve therapeutic significance, namely, through their anti-angiogenic and anti-permeability effects. Although anti-angiogenesis has only recently joined our expanding lexicon in retinal therapeutics, in reality our approach to NVAMD has always been anti-angiogenic [5 - 14]. Therapeutic anti-angiogenesis has its foundations in the 1960 s and 1970 s when the excellent reverse optics of the human eye were first exploited to give high-quality repro-ducible images with relatively compact fundus cameras and routine clinical fundus fluorescein angiography (FFA) arrived [15, 16]. Coupled with this was the development of commer-cially available <b>photocoagulators</b> such as the ruby laser in 1960 and the Xenon arc, first developed in Essen, Germany, in the 1940 s [17, 18]. These three breakthrough developments of photography, angiography, and photocoagulation led {{for the first time to}} an expanding, albeit anecdotal, database of clinical evidence that supported anti-angiogenesis through vascular photocoagulation as a sight-saving therapy, obser-vations that were initially seen in managing proliferative diabetic retinopathy (PDR). Thus, therapeutic anti-angiogen-esis became a reality, and the targeted destruction, both direct and indirect, of abnormal blood vessels became the strategic goal of therapy for PDR and subsequently NVAMD. These initial clinical observations gave birth to the groundbreaking randomized control trials (RCTs) so familiar to present-da...|$|R
40|$|Purpose: To compare pain {{response}} of patients undergoing panretinal photocoagulation (PRP) for proliferative diabetic retinopathy (PDR) using 532 nm standard laser versus multispot pattern scan laser and {{to evaluate the}} relationship between pain response and patient characteristics. Material and Method: Thirty-five patients had PRP with the Pascal system in a single session, while other 35 patients had PRP with conventional laser in 2 sessions. Parameters used in conventional laser were as follows: spot size 200 µm, exposure time 0. 2 s, and power sufficient to produce visible grey-white burns. We used same spot size, 20 - 30 ms exposure time, {{and higher levels of}} laser power {{in order to get a}} similar endpoint in the Pascal system. The patients were required to evaluate the severity of pain on a visual analog scale (VAS) and verbally 5 minutes after PRP with Pascal and 5 minutes after the first session of PRP with conventional laser. The relationship between pain experienced and patient characteristics was evaluated. Results: At baseline, both groups did not differ significantly (p > 0. 05, for all) with respect to sex, age, duration of diabetes, most recent HbA 1 c, treatment regimen, or patient experience. The patients in the Pascal group had a mean pain score of 0. 55 ± 0. 70 on verbal scale and 1. 54 ± 1. 22 on VAS compared to 2. 17 ± 1. 18 and 5. 54 ± 3. 28, respectively in the conventional laser group which was, statistically, significantly different in both scales (p< 0. 05). Discussion: Our study confirms that new generation pattern scanning <b>photocoagulators</b> satisfactorily decrease the pain by shortening the exposure time while increasing the laser power.

This instrument {{consists of a}} monocular indirect ophthalmoscopic delivery system, a beam control box, a standard slit-lamp delivery system and a changeover switch. The characteristics of this <b>photocoagulator</b> are as follows: a easier application, better viewing of whole fundus during retinal photocoagulation, effective photocoagulation in supine position, posibility to change direct <b>photocoagulator</b> or indirect one by the changeover switch and photocoagulation viewed from all directions around the patient head. After confirming the condition and safety by experimenting on rabbits eyes, laser photo coagulation is to be performed on diabetic retinopathy, retinal tear, branch occlusion of retinal vein, retinal neovascularization, retinal macroaneurysm and retinopathy of prematurity. Especially this monocular indirect argon laser photocoagulation can be applied more effectively than xenon light coagulation on the retinopathy of prematurity thanks to overall view of the fundus in supine position. While {{on the other hand}} it has two unfavorable points, i. e. it is unstable to be fixed and that fine and delicate laser photocoagulation in the mascular area cannot be performed.

40|$|SUMMARY We {{performed}} electroretinogr-ams (ERG) on {{both eyes}} of 11 diabetic patients before and {{one month after}} panretinal photocoagulation for diabetic retinopathy. Each patient had one eye treated with argon laser and the fellow eye treated with the xenon arc <b>photocoagulator.</b> After photocoagulation the ERG was symmetrically reduced unless the retinal area burned with xenon arc was greater than twice the retinal area burned in the fellow eye by the argon laser <b>photocoagulator.</b> Panretinal photocoagulation (PRP) {{has been shown to}} reduce the risk of blindness caused by moderate to advanced proliferative diabetic retinopathy. ' The amount of retinal destruction following PRP may determine the effectiveness of the treatment. We used electroretinograms (ERGs) following argon laser and xenon arc panretinal photocoagulation to evaluate the amount of functional retina destroyed. Materials and methods Eight men and 3 women with bilateral symmetrical severe nonproliferative diabetic retinopathy (DRS group 3) 1 or proliferative diabetic retinopathy without vitreous contraction (DRS groups 4 - 6) ' were selected. All were white and their ages ranged from 19 to 60 years with a mean of 43 - 5 years. Each patient had a complete ophthalmic examina-tion including best corrected visual acuity, slit-lamp examination, intraocular pressure measurement, and dilated direct and indirect ophthalmoscopy. Fundus photographs and fluorescein angiography were also obtained. Their retinopathy was classified by the modified Airlie House classification.

40|$|Purpose. To compare {{treatment}} {{areas and}} navigated macular laser photocoagulation (MLP) plans suggested by retro-mode scanning laser ophthalmoscopy (RM-SLO) image versus {{optical coherence tomography}} (OCT) central retinal thickness map and treatment planning among retina specialists. Methods. Thirty-nine eyes with diabetic or branch retinal vein occlusion-related ME undergoing navigated MLP with navigated <b>photocoagulator</b> had OCT and RM-SLO taken. OCT map and RM-SLO image were imported to the <b>photocoagulator</b> and aligned onto the retina. Two retina specialists placed laser spot marks separately based on OCT and RM-SLO images in a random fashion. The spots placed by each physician were compared between OCT and RM-SLO and among physicians. The areas of retinal edema on OCT and RM-SLO of the same eye were also compared. Results. The average number of laser spots using RM-SLO and OCT template was 189. 6 ± 77. 4 and 136. 6 ± 46. 8, respectively, P= 0. 003. The average area of edema on RM-SLO image was larger than that on OCT map (14. 5 ± 3. 9 [*]mm 2 versus 10. 3 ± 2. 8 [*]mm 2, P= 0. 005) because of a larger scanning area. There was narrow variability in treatment planning among retina specialists for both RM-SLO (P= 0. 13) and OCT (P= 0. 19). Conclusion. The RM-SLO image superimposed onto the fundus of the same eye {{can be used to}} guide MLP with narrow variability in treatment planning among retina specialists. The treatment areas suggested by RM-SLO-guided MLP plans for ME were shown to be larger than those suggested by OCT-guided plans...|$|E
40|$|PURPOSE. Retinal laser {{photocoagulation}} {{carries the}} risk of overtreatment due to effect variation of identically applied lesions. The degree of coagulation depends on the induced temperature increase and on exposure time. We introduce temperature controlled photocoagulation (TCP), which uses optoacoustics to determine individually exposure times necessary to create reproducible lesions. METHODS. Optoacoustic temperature measurement relies on pressure waves that are excited in the retinal tissue by repetitive low-energy laser pulses. Signal amplitudes correlate with tissue temperature and are detected by a transducer in the laser contact lens. We used a continuous wave (CW) <b>photocoagulator</b> for treatment irradiation and superimposed probe laser pulses for simultaneous temperature measurement.

40|$|Aim: To {{systematically}} refine {{and recommend}} parameter settings of spot size, power, and treatment duration using the Pascal &# 174; <b>photocoagulator,</b> a multi-spot, semi-automated, short-duration laser system. Materials and Methods: A retrospective consecutive series with 752 Caucasian eyes and 1242 laser procedures {{over two years}} were grouped into, (1) 374 macular focal / grid photocoagulation (FP), (2), 666 panretinal photocoagulation (PRP), and (3) 202 barrage photocoagulation (BP). Parameters for power, duration, spot number, and spot size were recorded for every group. Results: Power parameters for all groups showed a non-gaussian distribution; FP group, median 190 mW, range 100 - 950 mW, and PRP group, median 800 mW, range 100 - 2000 mW. On subgroup comparison, for similar spot size, as treatment duration decreased, the power required increased, albeit in a much lesser proportion than that given by energy = power x time. Most frequently used patterns were single spot (89 &#x 0025; of cases) in FP, 5 &# 935; 5 box (72 &#x 0025;) in PRP, and 2 &# 935; 2 box (78 &#x 0025;) in BP. Spot diameters as high as &# 8776; 700 &# 956;m on retina were given in the PRP group. Single session PRP was attempted in six eyes with a median spot count of 3500. Conclusion: Overall, due to the small duration of its pulse, the Pascal &# 174; <b>photocoagulator</b> tends to use higher powers, although much lower cumulative energies, than those used in a conventional laser. The consequent lesser heat dissipation, especially lateral, can allow one to use relatively larger spot sizes and give more closely spaced burns, without incurring significant side effects...|$|E

40|$|AIMS—The {{effect of}} transpupillary {{thermotherapy}} (TTT) on human choroidal melanomas was investigated {{by means of}} histopathology.  METHODS—Before enucleation TTT was performed in 11  eyes with a xenon arc <b>photocoagulator</b> with a red filter or a diode laser at 810  nm. The exposure time was 1  minute; the estimated temperature {{at the top of}} the tumour was about 65 °C.  RESULTS—Seven of 11  tumours developed necrosis to a maximum depth of 3. 9  mm with a sharp demarcation between the necrotic and the viable part of the tumour. The depth correlated with penetration of heat into the tumour. Scattered small haemorrhages in the transitional zone between the necrotic and the viable part of the tumour were observed in three eyes but large haemorrhages were absent. Ocular media were not affected owing to the low rate of absorption of radiation at 810  nm. TTT did not cause significant scleral damage. Intrascleral tumour cells with a viable appearance were observed in one eye, where the tumour was almost totally necrotic.  CONCLUSION—Results show that TTT has potential as a conservative therapeutic treatment for choroidal melanomas. ...|$|E
40|$|The {{binocular}} indirect {{argon laser}} <b>photocoagulator</b> was newly designed to enable visualisation {{of the entire}} fundus during panretinal laser photocoagulation and to treat retinal tears immediately after buckling procedures of the sclera.

40|$|PHOTOCOAGULATION {{has become}} an {{important}} method of treatment for several eye conditions. It requires the introduction into the patient's eye of {{a certain amount of}} energy, concentrated into a small area of the fundus. Simultaneous fundus observa-tion is also necessary. In addition, before photocoagulation is applied, a target mark should be visible on the pigment epithelium, exactly at the spot where the energy is to be concentrated.

40|$|AbstractPurposeTo {{compare the}} safety and {{efficacy}} of Pascal laser photocoagulation {{in comparison with the}} conventional laser photocoagulation in the treatment of diabetic retinopathy. Patients and methodsA prospective randomized case series study was done on 120 procedures done in 120 patients divided into two main groups, group A, patients undergoing focal or modified grid macular laser and group B, patients undergoing panretinal photocoagulation (PRP). Each of the two groups were subdivided into two subgroups randomly in the first we used conventional laser photocoagulation (groups A 1 and B 1) and in the other we used Pascal laser photocoagulation (groups A 2 and B 2). ResultsProcedures in groups A 1, 2 and in groups B 1, 2 had successful outcomes. Significantly higher powers were required with the Pascal (groups A 2 and B 2) than with conventional laser (groups A 1 and B 1) (p< 0. 001) in eyes that underwent PRP and focal/modified grid macular treatment with both systems.

40|$|Purpose: Diode lasers have compact dimensions, {{efficient}} electric-optical conversion, {{absence of}} major cooling requirements, long useful life, and minimal maintenance. We verified the structural and ultrastructural effects of diode red laser emissions at 670 nm on pigmented rabbit retina. Methods: Transpupillary laser pulses {{were applied to}} rabbit retinas at variable powers with a spot size of 500 mu m (approximate to 1, 000 mu m at the retina level) and duration of 200 milliseconds. Light and electron microscopic analyses were performed. Results: Subthreshold nonvisible lesions were produced using a power of 200 mW. Ophthalmoscopically visible lesions were produced using a power of 400 mW. More prominent lesions were obtained using a higher power (600 mW). Structural and peculiar ultrastructural changes correlated with the power used. In general, damage was incurred by the retinal pigment epithelium with extension into the superficial choroid posteriorly and into the outer retina anteriorly. The inner retina was involved at higher power levels. Conclusions: Ultrastructural analysis of rabbit retina treated with the 670 -nm diode laser adds newer insights on tissue changes after thermal irradiation.

40|$|PURPOSE. To {{investigate}} {{the role of}} real-time optical coherence tomography (OCT) in the detection of standard and nonvisible subthreshold laser irradiation. METHODS. We used an integrated platform consisting of a slit-lamp, a digital camera, a slit-lamp mounted OCT, and a 532 -nm laser <b>photocoagulator</b> (Topcon Inc., Tokyo, Japan). The laser aiming beam and the OCT scan were aligned to obtain real-time tomographic imaging of the irradiated area during laser exposure. Standard and subthreshold laser irradiation and simultaneous OCT acquisition were tested in artificial and biological samples. Laser testing cards were chosen as artificial samples. Freshly enucleated pig eyes were used for iris irradiation. RESULTS. Ophthalmoscopically visible reference burns {{were placed on the}} laser testing card in 2 parallel lines. Then, a series of laser spots with the same size and duration but different power were placed between the reference burns. Online OCT during laser irradiation detected changes in the reflectivity profile of the artificial sample at a power of 200 mW, in absence of ophthalmoscopically visible lesions. Similarly, reference burns were placed on pig iris and between them various laser spots were performed at ranging powers. Changes in the iris optical properties, as detected with online OCT, were produced with a power of 860 mW in absence of visible endpoint. CONCLUSIONS. Online OCT is able to identify non-ophthalmoscopically visible lesions during subthreshold laser irradiation either in artificial samples or in pig iris. © 2011 Wichtig Editore...|$|E
40|$|AbstractHigh-intensity <b>photocoagulator</b> lesions placed nasally to {{the optic}} disc {{in one eye}} {{destroyed}} all retinal layers and led to visual deafferentation of the lateral part of layer A in the contralateral lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) of adult cats. The retino-geniculate topography was determined with vertical tungsten microelectrode penetrations through LGN layers A and A 1 before and at different times after photocoagulation. Before the 20 th day a border of light excitability was found in layer A corresponding to the normal projection of the lesion onto the LGN. Deviations from the normal topographical organization were evident 30 days and later after photocoagulation. Cells were recorded within the deafferented part of layer A near to the border of deafferentation which had receptive field (RF) centers displaced by more than two degrees of visual angle {{with respect to the}} normal retinotopy. During formation of the retinal scar no identifiable points on the retina were displaced {{in the same direction as}} the RF centers. The histological control of the retinal lesions proved that there was no potentially excitable tissue left to account for a spread of excitation into the lesion. Latency measurements after electrical stimulation of the optic tract and the visual cortex suggested a retinal input and a projection into the visual cortex for the LGN cells with displaced receptive field centers. RF center displacements up to five degrees at the border of the lesions indicated a lateral spread of excitation within the LGN up to 250 μm beyond normal...|$|E
40|$|Growth-associated protein- 43 (GAP- 43) and synapsin {{were used}} as {{molecular}} markers for synaptic reorganization in the adult cat visual system following sensory deprivation. Small binocular retinal lesions (central 10 degrees) were made with a xenon light <b>photocoagulator</b> in adult cats. One, 3, 5 and 7 weeks after induction of the lesion, the neuropil levels of synapsin and GAP- 43 in the dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus (dLGN) and area 17 were determined by immunocytochemistry. GAP- 43 displayed a moderately low basal level in the dLGN of normal adult cats. The parvocellular C layers and the interlaminar plexi were characterized by higher immunoreactivity for GAP- 43. Lesion-induced alterations were observed in all layers: GAP- 43 immunoreactivity increased {{in the part of}} the dLGN representing central vision. This increase was maximal 3 weeks after the lesion. Under our experimental conditions, sensory deprivation did not significantly alter GAP- 43 levels in the visual cortex. The changes in synapsin immunoreactivity were also restricted to the dLGN. In this nucleus, synapsin immunoreactivity decreased in all layers in the part subserving central vision 1 week after lesion. By 3 weeks after lesion, the level of synapsin had already returned to normal. This study provides evidence for a capacity for structural remodelling in primary sensory brain areas such as the dLGN throughout adult life. The observed changes in GAP- 43 and synapsin in the dLGN suggest that synaptic reorganization is induced by retinal lesions. Normalization of synaptic density and activity could be important for the survival of the partially deafferented geniculate neurons. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|Retinal and {{cortical}} lesions {{are completely}} different events that trigger visual cortical plasticity. We therefore compared the cortical effects of homonymous lesions {{of the central}} retina with effects of cortical lesions. All in vivo experiments were performed in anaesthetized, adult cats. Retinal lesions were made with a Xenon-light <b>photocoagulator,</b> and cortical lesions were induced by focal application of heat or ibotenic acid injection. Both, in cortical regions representing the retinal scotoma and at the border of small focal cortical lesions single neuron activity was initially suppressed and accompanied by a narrow area of increased activity adjacent to the region of functional loss during the first 1 - 2 weeks. At the same time an increased glutamatergic NMDA response and a reduction of GABA(A) and GABA(B) responses was observed around the cortical lesions in vitro. At an early stage long-term potentiation (LTP) is facilitated in those regions that were characterized by local upregulation of excitation and downregulation of inhibition after cortical lesions. Similarly, at the border of cortical scotomas in area 17 an increased glutamate level was found while inside the scotoma GAD levels were reduced. Shifts in topography of retinal representation as well as increases of receptive field size were detected as signs of lesion-induced neuronal reorganization after retinal and cortical lesions with longer survival times. A common cascade of events is triggered in the visual cortex by retinal as well as cortical lesions: reduced GABAergic inhibition and increased glutamatergic excitation, leading to increased spontaneous activity and visual excitability that is accompanied by facilitated LTP, and appears to initiate local cortical reorganization after functional disturbances in the visual system. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|PURPOSE: To use focal {{electroretinography}} {{to evaluate}} changes in retinal function during transpupillary thermotherapy (TTT) for neovascular age-related macular degeneration (ARMD). METHODS: Sixteen eyes of 16 patients with ARMD with occult choroidal neovascularization (CNV) were studied. A 630 -nm <b>photocoagulator</b> aiming beam was modified {{for use as}} a 41 -Hz square-wave focal electroretinogram (fERG) stimulus. The stimulus was presented on a light-adapting background by a Goldmann-type lens (visual angle, 18 degrees; mean luminance, 50 cd/m(2)). fERGs were continuously monitored before, during, and after TTT for occult CNV. The amplitude and phase of the fERG's fundamental harmonic were measured. RESULTS: No suprathreshold or adverse clinical events occurred {{during the course of the}} study. fERG amplitude decreased transiently during TTT (23 % +/- 9 % [SE]; P < 0. 05). The decrease in amplitude was greatest 16 to 20 seconds and 32 to 40 seconds after the onset of TTT. It was followed by a recovery to baseline amplitude during TTT (48 to 60 seconds after TTT was begun). Within 60 seconds after TTT was completed, fERG amplitude was within the range of baseline. TTT did not alter the fERG phase. Mean fERG amplitudes and phases recorded 1 week and 1 month after TTT were comparable to mean pretreatment levels. CONCLUSIONS: fERG amplitude decreases transiently during TTT, despite the absence of ophthalmoscopically apparent lesions. Intraoperative amplitude depression may result from an adaptation effect to laser light energy and/or hyperthermia, resulting in desensitization of cone photoreceptors and bipolar cells. Treatment sites are electrophysiologically functional 1 month after TTT. Detailed parametric study of a larger patient group is needed to determine whether fERG testing is potentially useful for monitoring and perhaps for controlling and optimizing TTT for choroidal neovascularization...|$|E
