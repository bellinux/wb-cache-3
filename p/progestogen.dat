5|$|The {{degree of}} {{ovulation}} suppression in progestogen-only contraceptives {{depends on the}} <b>progestogen</b> activity and dose. Low dose progestogen-only contraceptives—traditional <b>progestogen</b> only pills, subdermal implants Norplant and Jadelle, and intrauterine system Mirena—inhibit ovulation in about 50% of cycles and rely mainly on other effects, such as thickening of cervical mucus, for their contraceptive effectiveness. Intermediate dose progestogen-only contraceptives—the progestogen-only pill Cerazette and the subdermal implant Nexplanon—allow some follicular development but more consistently inhibit ovulation in 97–99% of cycles. The same cervical mucus changes occur as with very low-dose progestogens. High-dose, progestogen-only contraceptives—the injectables Depo-Provera and Noristerat—completely inhibit follicular development and ovulation.|$|E
5|$|While {{some forms}} of birth control do not affect the menstrual cycle, {{hormonal}} contraceptives work by disrupting it. <b>Progestogen</b> negative feedback decreases the pulse frequency of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) release by the hypothalamus, which decreases the release of follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinizing hormone (LH) by the anterior pituitary. Decreased levels of FSH inhibit follicular development, preventing an increase in estradiol levels. <b>Progestogen</b> negative feedback {{and the lack of}} estrogen positive feedback on LH release prevent a mid-cycle LH surge. Inhibition of follicular development and the absence of a LH surge prevent ovulation.|$|E
5|$|Hormonal {{factors are}} capable of {{altering}} the mucosal barrier. In one study, {{a small group of}} females with apthous stomatitis had fewer occurrences of aphthous ulcers during the luteal phase of the menstrual cycle or with use of the contraceptive pill. This phase is associated with a fall in <b>progestogen</b> levels, mucosal proliferation and keratinization. This subgroup often experiences remission during pregnancy. However, other studies report no correlation between aphthous stomatitis and menstrual period, pregnancy or menopause.|$|E
50|$|This is a {{comparison}} of <b>progestogens,</b> or agonists of the progesterone receptor (PR), as medications. <b>Progestogens</b> include both progesterone and progestins (synthetic <b>progestogens).</b>|$|R
50|$|<b>Progestogens,</b> {{similarly}} to the androgens and estrogens {{through their own}} respective receptors, inhibit the secretion of the gonadotropins follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinizing hormone (LH) via activation of the progesterone receptor. This effect {{is a form of}} negative feedback on the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal (HPG) axis that the body uses to prevent sex hormone levels from becoming too elevated. Accordingly, <b>progestogens,</b> both endogenous and exogenous (i.e., progestins), have antigonadotropic effects, and progestins in sufficient amounts can markedly suppress the body's normal production of <b>progestogens,</b> androgens, and estrogens, as well as, in theory, neurosteroids.|$|R

5|$|Combined {{hormonal}} contraceptives {{include both}} an estrogen and a <b>progestogen.</b> Estrogen negative {{feedback on the}} anterior pituitary greatly decreases the release of FSH, which makes combined hormonal contraceptives more effective at inhibiting follicular development and preventing ovulation. Estrogen also reduces the incidence of irregular breakthrough bleeding. Several combined hormonal contraceptives—the pill, NuvaRing, and the contraceptive patch—are usually used {{in a way that}} causes regular withdrawal bleeding. In a normal cycle, menstruation occurs when estrogen and progesterone levels drop rapidly. Temporarily discontinuing use of combined hormonal contraceptives (a placebo week, not using patch or ring for a week) has a similar effect of causing the uterine lining to shed. If withdrawal bleeding is not desired, combined hormonal contraceptives may be taken continuously, although this increases the risk of breakthrough bleeding.|$|E
5|$|Most {{pituitary}} hormones can {{be replaced}} indirectly by administering {{the products of the}} effector glands: hydrocortisone (cortisol) for adrenal insufficiency, levothyroxine for hypothyroidism, testosterone for male hypogonadism, and estradiol for female hypogonadism (usually with a <b>progestogen</b> to inhibit unwanted effects on the uterus). Growth hormone is available in synthetic form, but needs to be administered parenterally (by injection). Antidiuretic hormone {{can be replaced}} by desmopressin (DDAVP) tablets or nose spray. Generally, the lowest dose of the replacement medication is used to restore wellbeing and correct the deranged results, as excessive doses would cause side-effects or complications. Those requiring hydrocortisone are usually instructed to increase their dose in physically stressful events such as injury, hospitalization and dental work as these are times when the normal supplementary dose may be inadequate, putting the patient at risk of adrenal crisis.|$|E
5|$|Occasionally, {{in females}} where {{ulceration}} is correlated to the menstrual cycle or to birth control pills, <b>progestogen</b> or {{a change in}} birth control may be beneficial. Use of nicotine replacement therapy {{for people who have}} developed oral ulceration after stopping smoking has also been reported. Starting smoking again does not usually lessen the condition. Trauma can be reduced by avoiding rough or sharp foodstuffs and by brushing teeth with care. If sodium lauryl sulfate is suspected to be the cause, avoidance of products containing this chemical may be useful and prevent recurrence in some individuals. Similarly patch testing may indicate that food allergy is responsible, and the diet modified accordingly. If investigations reveal deficiency states, correction of the deficiency may result in resolution of the ulceration. For example, {{there is some evidence that}} vitamin B12 supplementation may prevent recurrence in some individuals.|$|E

25|$|High {{doses of}} <b>progestogens</b> exert {{negative}} {{feedback on the}} hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis by activating the progesterone receptor.

25|$|NET was {{synthesized}} for {{the first}} time by chemists Luis Miramontes, Carl Djerassi, and George Rosenkranz at Syntex in Mexico City in 1951. It was the first highly active oral <b>progestogen</b> to be synthesized, and was preceded (as a <b>progestogen)</b> by progesterone (1934), ethisterone (1938), 19-norprogesterone (1944), and 17α-methylprogesterone (1949), as well as by nandrolone (1950), whereas noretynodrel (1952), and norethandrolone (1953) followed the synthesis of NET. The drug was first introduced, alone as Norlutin, in the United States in 1957. NET was subsequently introduced in combination with mestranol as Ortho-Novum in the U.S. in 1963, and was the second progestin, after noretynodrel in 1960, to be used in an oral contraceptive. In 1964, additional contraceptive preparations containing NET in combination with mestranol or EE, such as Norlestrin and Norinyl, were marketed in the U.S.|$|E

30|$|Irregular {{bleeding}} {{associated with}} the use of a combination of oestrogens and <b>progestogens</b> is considered as an unacceptable side effect of HRT [7]. In continuous combined regimens, oestrogens and <b>progestogens</b> are administered together daily, and such treatment should produce an atrophic endometrium and amenorrhoea. Alternately, in sequential or cyclic regimens, <b>progestogens</b> are given after oestrogens in order to induce predictable withdrawal bleeding [8]. Persistent bleeding associated with combined regimens or occurring before the discontinuation of <b>progestogens</b> in the sequential regimens should be considered abnormal, and its cause should be investigated in order to exclude uterine pathology. Various diagnostic imaging modalities that can be used are transvaginal ultrasonography (TVS), saline infusion sonohysterography (SIS) and hysteroscopy (HYS) and biopsy [9]. The diagnostic strength and advantages and disadvantages of such techniques must be known, as must their observer dependence, to guarantee that the right technique is favoured over others and that it is applied in a cost-effective way.|$|R
40|$|International audienceHormone therapy (HT) is {{the most}} {{effective}} treatment for correcting menopausal symptoms after menopause. HT initially consisted of estrogens alone and <b>progestogens</b> were secondly added to estrogens for preventing the risk of endometrial cancer associated to estrogens use. Venous thromboembolism (VTE), including deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism, is a major harmful effect of HT. It is now well known that oral and transdermal estrogens are differentially associated with VTE risk but <b>progestogens</b> may be another important determinant of the thrombotic risk among HT users. Both randomized controlled trials and meta-analysis of observational studies suggested that the VTE risk was higher among users of estrogens plus <b>progestogens</b> than among users of estrogens alone. With respect to the different pharmacological classes of <b>progestogens,</b> there is evidence for a deleterious effect of medroxyprogesterone acetate on VTE risk. In addition, observational studies showed that norpregnane derivatives were significantly associated with an increased VTE risk whereas micronized progesterone could be safe with respect to thrombotic risk. The effect of tibolone on VTE risk remains uncertain. In conclusion, <b>progestogens</b> may have differential effects on VTE risk according to the molecules and therefore represent an important potential determinant of the thrombotic risk among postmenopausal women using estrogens...|$|R
