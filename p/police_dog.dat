Many <b>police</b> <b>dogs</b> are also trained in detection as well.|$|R

5|$|White Dog, {{released}} in France as Chien Blanc, is a fictional autobiographical novel written by Romain Gary. Originally published as {{a short story}} in Life in 1970 (9 October), the full novel was published in 1970 in French in France by Éditions Gallimard. Gary's English version of the novel was published in North America {{in the same year}} by New American Library. The novel provides a fictionalized account of Gary and his wife's experiences in the 1960s with a stray Alabama <b>police</b> <b>dog</b> trained to attack black people on sight, and their attempts to have the dog reprogrammed.|$|E

25|$|The Swedish Police Authority {{currently}} deploys around 400 <b>police</b> <b>dogs,</b> {{of which}} about 70 percent German Shepherds and 20 percent Malinois. The remaining 10 percent {{consist of a}} range of breeds, including Boxers, Labradors, and Springer Spaniel. There is however no requirement for the dogs to be purebred, as long as they meet mental and physical requirements set by the <b>police.</b> <b>Dogs</b> aged 18–48 months are eligible to take admission tests for the K9 training. The <b>police</b> <b>dogs</b> live with their operators, and after retirement at age 8-10 the operator often assumes the ownership of the dog.|$|R
5|$|The First Nations in {{the north}} {{typically}} had some prior experience of Europeans, for example through contact with the Hudson's Bay Company, and there was little conflict between the police and these native communities, and few crimes committed. The First Nations typically {{did not like the}} police, however, and often blamed them for wider government policies; for their part, the mounted police often regarded the First Nations with contempt. By comparison, the mounted police got on much better with the Inuit, who had seen far less contact with Europeans. The force generally took a more liberal, paternalistic attitude towards them, often applying informal justice rather than official laws when the occasional Inuit crime was committed. Members of the First Nations and Inuit were employed to drive <b>police</b> <b>dog</b> sleds and cook for their patrols.|$|E
5|$|A fictionalized memoir set in {{both the}} United States and France during the 1960s American civil rights movement, White Dog focuses on the events that occur after Gary and his then-wife Jean Seberg, an actress and an activist, adopt a {{handsome}} and clearly well-trained German Shepherd dog who comes back to their home with one of their other dogs. At first, the dog, which they name Batka, is an ideal new member of the family: intelligent, devoted, and quickly befriending the couple's assortment of other animals. To their dismay, they discover that the dog, a former Alabama <b>police</b> <b>dog,</b> was trained to attack black people on sight. Although they are told the dog is {{too old to be}} retrained, they take him to a black dog trainer to try. Instead, the man trains the dog to attack white people, including Gary himself. Gary states that he changed the ending of the American version to be more optimistic.|$|E
5|$|Kentuckian {{departed}} New York for {{her first}} trooping voyage on 2 March, picking up nearly 2,000 soldiers at Saint-Nazaire—among them some 1,500 men of the 363rd Infantry Regiment of the U.S. 91st Infantry Division, and a number from the U.S. 33rd Infantry Division—before returning to New York on 1 April. Her arrival on another trooping run in June returned 1,860 men, including over 1,500 members of the 345th Field Artillery Regiment of the U.S. 90th Infantry Division. An officer of that unit brought back a black <b>police</b> <b>dog</b> named Pat, who, purportedly, had been the personal dog of Germany's Crown Prince Wilhelm. Another trip in July returned another 1,852 men from Saint-Nazaire. In all, Kentuckian made {{a total of five}} trooping runs from France, bringing back 8,895 men by the time she completed her last trip on 31 August at Norfolk, Virginia.

5|$|The Guardian {{obtained}} a four-minute video on 21 April from an anonymous bystander {{who had been}} filming on Cornhill between 7:10 and 7:30pm. The footage shows Tomlinson standing behind a bicycle rack in Royal Exchange Passage {{with his hands in}} his pockets, and a group of advancing police officers. When a <b>police</b> <b>dog</b> approaches him, he turns his back. At that point, he is hit on the legs and pushed by the TSG constable, and can be seen scraping along the ground {{on the right side of}} his forehead. Eyewitnesses said they heard a noise as his head hit the ground. The IPCC sought an injunction against the broadcast of the video by Channel4 News, but a judge rejected the application. An image obtained by Sky News on 24 April appears to show bruising on the right side of Tomlinson's forehead. A head injury was recorded by the second and third pathologists.|$|E
