40|$|The {{effect of}} the alien {{horse-chestnut}} <b>leaf</b> <b>miner,</b> Cameraria ohridella, on native fauna was studied by comparing the species richness of native <b>leaf</b> <b>miner</b> communities and the abundance of selected native <b>leaf</b> <b>miner</b> species in the presence and absence of horse-chestnut trees infested by C. ohridella, in various environments in Europe. The species richness of native <b>leaf</b> <b>miner</b> communities in Switzerland was lower at sites where C. ohridella was present than at control sites. In Switzerland, France and Bulgaria, several native <b>leaf</b> <b>miner</b> species were significantly less abundant {{in the vicinity of}} infested horse-chestnuts. The native species most affected by the presence of the invasive alien species were those occurring early in the year and sharing their parasitoid complex with C. ohridella.

The {{seasonality}} of C. elaeidis, its natural enemies and their relationship with temperature, rainfall and relative humidity was observed between January 2009 and December 2010 at the main station of the Nigerian Institute for Oil Palm Research, Nigeria. Past <b>leaf</b> <b>miner</b> population estimates were obtained from NIFOR entomology division from 1976 - 1980. This study analyses temporal patterns in <b>leaf</b> <b>miner</b> abundance, and elucidates general patterns and factors influencing <b>leaf</b> <b>miner</b> abundance. Multiple linear regressions were {{used to analyze the}} relationship between abundance of <b>leaf</b> <b>miner,</b> its parasitoids and predators and the following climatic variables: maximum and minimum temperature (oC), rainfall (mm) and relative humidity (%). For the analyses, climate variables from the month of collection (control variable) or from the month before the collection (delayed variable) were used. The abundance of <b>leaf</b> <b>miner</b> and predatory ants peaked in the dry season, while parasitoids were most abundant in the rainy season. Significant correlations (P is not great than 0. 05) were found between <b>leaf</b> <b>miner,</b> its natural enemies and both control and delayed weather variables. For all years, maximum temperature was the most dominant variable for all the <b>leaf</b> <b>miner</b> stages. Significant correlations were found between <b>leaf</b> <b>miner,</b> its natural enemies and both control and delayed weather variables. This indicates that the weather variables at both the month of collection and with a delayed month in relation to collection is critical for pest-weather evaluation. This is important for <b>leaf</b> <b>miner</b> control. Temperature, rainfall and relative humidity had an effect on the population of C. elaeidis, and this effect was manifested primarily in seasonal fluctuations in oil palm agroecosystems.

40|$|Shaded coffee agroecosystems {{traditionally}} have few pest problems potentially due to higher abundance {{and diversity of}} predators of herbivores. However, with coffee intensification (e. g., shade tree removal or pruning), some pest problems increase. For example, coffee <b>leaf</b> <b>miner</b> outbreaks {{have been linked to}} more intensive management and increased use of agrochemicals. Parasitic wasps control the coffee <b>leaf</b> <b>miner,</b> but few studies have examined the role of predators, such as ants, that are abundant and diverse in coffee plantations. Here, we examine linkages between arboreal ant communities and coffee <b>leaf</b> <b>miner</b> incidence in a coffee plantation in Mexico. We examined relationships between incidence and severity of <b>leaf</b> <b>miner</b> attack and: (1) variation in canopy cover, tree density, tree diversity, and relative abundance of Inga spp. shade trees; (2) presence of Azteca instabilis, an arboreal canopy dominant ant; and (3) the number of arboreal twig-nesting ant species and nests in coffee plants. Differences in vegetation characteristics in study plots did not correlate with <b>leaf</b> <b>miner</b> damage perhaps because environmental factors act on pest populations at a larger spatial scale. Further, presence of A. instabilis did not influence presence or severity of <b>leaf</b> <b>miner</b> damage. The proportion of leaves with <b>leaf</b> <b>miner</b> damage was significantly lower where abundance of twig-nesting ants was higher but not where twig-nesting ant richness was higher. These results indicate that abundance of twig-nesting ants in shaded coffee plantations may contribute to maintenance of low <b>leaf</b> <b>miner</b> populations and that ants provide important ecosystem services in coffee agroecosystems...|$|R
40|$|Natural {{enemies of}} the {{groundnut}} leaf miner,Aproaerema modicella (Deventer), were studied at the International Crops Research Institute for the Semi-Arid Tropics (ICRISAT) located near Hyderabad in peninsular India.

40|$|Leaf mining {{is a form}} of endophagous {{herbivory}} {{in which}} insect larvae live and feed within leaf tissue. In this review we discuss aspects of <b>leaf</b> <b>miner</b> ecology, and the current evidence for three hypotheses relating to the evolution of this feeding guild. We also present a summary of the literature coverage relating to these herbivores, which have been relatively poorly studied compared with insects that feed externally such as sap suckers and leaf chewers. The majority of published studies concern <b>leaf</b> <b>miners</b> from the northern hemisphere, with a general focus on those species considered to be agricultural, forestry or horticultural pests. In a more detailed case study, we examine aspects of <b>leaf</b> <b>miner</b> ecology of Australian species. At least 114 species have been recorded as <b>leaf</b> <b>miners</b> in Australia in four orders: Coleoptera, Lepidoptera, Diptera and Hymenoptera. Lepidoptera and Diptera are the most speciose orders of Australian leaf miners; Hymenoptera are represented by a single endemic genus and half of all coleopteran miners are species introduced for biological control. Both the known number of leaf-mining species in Australia and the known number of hosts have increased in recent years following new targeted surveys. <b>Leaf</b> <b>miners</b> in Australia occur in many habitats and feed {{on a wide variety of}} host plants in at least 60 families although most individual species are monophagous. Although much of the research on <b>leaf</b> <b>miners</b> in Australia has focused on species that are commercially important pests or biological control agents, studies on fundamental aspects of <b>leaf</b> <b>miner</b> ecology are increasing.

40|$|This study {{investigated}} effects of plant quality and natural enemies on the abundance and survivorship of several <b>leaf</b> <b>miner</b> species on Florida scrub oaks over several ecological scales. Three oak species (Quercus laevis, Q. geminata, and Q. myrtifolia) and four leafminer species (Acrocercops albinatella, Brachys tesselatus, Stilbosis quadripustulatus, and Cameraria sp. nova) {{were the main}} focus of five separate studies, addressing effects of bottom-up and top-down factors at regional, local, and individual scales. At the regional scale, it was observed that Cameraria sp. nova was aggregated into sites, and sites closer to each other exhibited similar densities of mines than sites farther apart. None of the bottom-up and top-down factors studied were spatially structured, but did influence the variation in Cameraria abundance over the range of the host plant Q. myrtifolia. At the local scale, all <b>leaf</b> <b>miners</b> studied were aggregated between and within plants, and variation in bottom-up factors among individual plants explained variation in abundance for some of the <b>leaf</b> <b>miners</b> studied. Intra-specific competition was identified as an important factor influencing mine survivorship, but inter-specific competition among <b>leaf</b> <b>miners</b> and gall-formers did not shape the community structure of oak herbivores. Experimental manipulation of bottom-up and top-down factors via fertilization and natural enemy removal showed that bottom-up effects were important determinants of <b>leaf</b> <b>miner</b> abundance, as fertilized plants supported 2 to 5 -fold more herbivores than control plants. The removal of natural enemies, on the other hand, did not significantly impact the abundance and/or the survivorship of <b>leaf</b> <b>miners</b> and other guilds studied. At individual scales, it was demonstrated that two <b>leaf</b> <b>miner</b> species responded to random variations in leaf morphology, by increasing in abundance in individual host plants with more asymmetric leaves and/or higher levels of fluctuating as ymmetry. These results offered support for the plant stress hypothesis and differences in host plant quality were again partially responsible for the results found...|$|R
40|$|<b>Leaf</b> <b>miners</b> {{typically}} show non-random distributions both {{between and}} within plants. We tested {{the hypothesis that}} <b>leaf</b> <b>miners</b> on two oak species were clumped on individual host trees and individual branches and addressed whether clumping was influenced by aspects of plant quality and how clumping and/or interactions with other oak herbivores affected leaf-miner survivorship. Null models were used to test whether oak herbivores and different herbivore guilds co-occur at the plant scale. Twenty individual Quercus geminata plants and 20 Quercus laevis plants were followed over the season for the appearance of <b>leaf</b> <b>miners</b> and other herbivores, and foliar nitrogen, tannin concentration, leaf toughness and leaf water content were evaluated monthly for each individual tree. The survivorship {{of the most common}} <b>leaf</b> <b>miners</b> was evaluated by following the fate of marked mines in several combinations that involved intraand inter-specific associations. We observed that all <b>leaf</b> <b>miners</b> studied were clumped at the plant and branch scale, and the abundance of most leaf-miner species was influenced by plant quality traits. Mines that occurred singly on leaves exhibited significantly higher survivorship than double and triple mines and leaves that contained a mine or a leaf gall and a mine and damage by chewers exhibited lowest survivorship. Although <b>leaf</b> <b>miners</b> were clumped at individual host trees, null model analyses indicated that oak herbivores do not co-occur significantly less than expected by chance and there was no evidence for biological mechanisms such as inter-specific competition determining community structure at the plant scale. Thus, despite co-occurrence resulting in reduced survivorship at the leaf scale, such competition was not strong enough to structure separation of these oak herbivore communities...|$|R
