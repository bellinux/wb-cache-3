40|$|In this Article, Professor Drummonds {{examines}} {{the division of}} workplace regulatory authority between {{the states and the}} federal government. The Article first explores the decline of the New Deal system of collective bargaining and reviews the debates ignited by this decline. It then reviews the role of state law in regulating the workplace, and illustrates the complex relationship between federal and state law in the workplace by examining reductions in coverage for AIDS in employer-provided group medical plans. The Article sets forth a framework and theory for deciding federal-state authority issues. It analyzes traditional preemption doctrine and recent Supreme Court decisions outside of labor and employment law, and then applies these lessons to preemption doctrine in employment law, urging congressional revision of ERISA 2 ̆ 7 s <b>preemption</b> <b>provisions,</b> and judicial abrogation of current Federal Arbitration Act preemption doctrine. The Article concludes by recommending major revisions in the primary preemption doctrines that evolved out of the New Deal-era statutes concerning unionized employees...|$|R

40|$|This {{symposium}} was convened {{to address}} the growing and seemingly conflicting jurisprudence governing federal preemption of state damage actions.

The question raised in cases under the MDA is whether the Act 2 ̆ 7 s <b>preemption</b> <b>provision</b> nullifies state damage actions based on personal injuries caused by medical devices that are defective, poorly designed, or promoted in ways that do not alert patients (and physicians) to the risks that attend their use.

40|$|The Article evaluates Lindsey {{and other}} recent cases dealing with local {{regulations}} restricting tobacco advertising; it also examines their respective preemption analyses, {{suggesting that the}} use of the FCLAA 2 ̆ 7 s <b>preemption</b> <b>provision</b> against such regulations is unwarranted. The article argues that in Lindsey, the Ninth Circuit misconstrued the Supreme Court 2 ̆ 7 s discussion of the preemptive scope of the FCLAA by failing to read it in the proper contex and that the FCLAA 2 ̆ 7 s <b>preemption</b> <b>provision</b> was not intended to prevent the particular types of regulations involved in Lindsey and these other cases. It argues that the <b>preemption</b> <b>provision</b> was only meant to preempt health-risk or health-related requirements or prohibitions with respect to the advertising or promotion of cigarettes, which these regulations do not involve. The article also revisits Cipollone, examines the different positions taken with respect to the issue of whether the FCLAA preempts state law tort claims, and concludes that the decision that the FCLAA 2 ̆ 7 s <b>preemption</b> <b>provision</b> does preempt certain state law tort damages claims is probably not the best result. The article contends that Congress never intended this provision to be used to 2 ̆ 2 immunize 2 ̆ 2 cigarette manufacturers from such claims; in addition, state law tort damages claims serve important functions. It concludes with an argument that Cipollone prevents any regulation of cigarette manufacturers 2 ̆ 7 behavior and any state imposed obligations manufacturers owe to their customers, and that this result is undesirable...|$|E

40|$|Early in his administration, President Obama {{issued a}} {{memorandum}} about preemption that ordered {{federal agencies to}} fully consider state interests before preempting state laws. The Obama memorandum was a rebuke to the Bush Administration, which had regularly inserted <b>preemption</b> <b>provisions</b> into federal regulations in areas affecting health, consumer safety, and the environment. As a result of preemption, state laws {{could not be more}} protective than federal standards, and corporations were spared state tort lawsuits and state regulatory regimes. Preemption not only tends to pit corporate interests against the public welfare, but it can also undermine federalism. There is currently a lively debate as to whether the best institutional actor to foster federalism is the judiciary, Congress, or agencies. Yet despite the centrality of modern Presidents to preemption policy, the role of the President is all but ignored in preemption scholarship. Accordingly, this Article adds the President to the mix. In general, congressional lawmaking about preemption is preferable to presidential preemption because states have more opportunities to influence Congress. Nevertheless, there are many situations in which Congress cannot or will not consider the preemption implications of legislation. Accordingly, this Article explores ways in which the President can effectively ensure a vibrant role for the states in federalism regimes by using his Article II powers to push federal agencies {{to do a better job}} of considering state interests when they regulate...|$|R
40|$|Congress {{enacted the}} Employee Retiree Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA) to protect {{employees}} 2 ̆ 7 retirement and welfare benefits. Nevertheless, the Act {{has been interpreted}} by the U. S Supreme Court {{over the years to}} be in essence an Employers 2 ̆ 7 Security Act, with employers using ERISA to shield themselves against employee benefit-related claims. The flaw in the current ERISA scheme lies at the intersection of ERISA 2 ̆ 7 s <b>preemption</b> and remedial <b>provisions.</b> Courts broadly interpret the <b>preemption</b> <b>provisions</b> of ERISA to invalidate employee benefits-related state laws and then force employees to depend on an inadequate, 2 ̆ 2 comprehensive and reticulated 2 ̆ 2 remedial scheme. This “intersectionality” problem leads to a state of affairs that is contrary to ERISA 2 ̆ 7 s purpose of protecting the interests of participants and beneficiaries by 2 ̆ 2 providing for appropriate remedies, sanctions, and ready access to the Federal courts. 2 ̆ 2 To cure what currently ails ERISA, this article proposes three alternative reforms - one judicial and two legislative. The judicial approach would call for the Court to adopt a remedialist approach, which would be in line both with Congress 2 ̆ 7 s intent to incorporate most of the common law of trusts into ERISA, and also consistent with a modern interpretation of a remedial statute. Additionally, Congress should re-examine and reject the far-fetched analogy between ERISA, enacted in 1974, and the 2 ̆ 2 days of the divided bench 2 ̆ 2 analysis and provide an express and expansive definition for 2 ̆ 2 appropriate equitable relief 2 ̆ 2 under proposed Section 3 (43).

40|$|Section 301 of the Copyright Act of 1976 {{expressly}} preempts {{state law}} {{actions that are}} within the 2 ̆ 2 general scope of copyright 2 ̆ 2 and that assert claims that are 2 ̆ 2 equivalent to 2 ̆ 2 the rights conferred by the Act. The Act eliminated the previous system of common law copyright for unpublished works, which had prevailed under the prior 1909 Copyright Act. By federalizing copyright law, the drafters of the statute sought to achieve uniformity and to avoid the potential for state protection of infinite duration. The legislative history of § 301 stated that this <b>preemption</b> <b>provision</b> was set forth 2 ̆ 2 in the clearest and most unequivocal language possible, so as to foreclose any conceivable misinterpretation [...] . and to avoid the development of any vague borderline between State and Federal protection. 2 ̆ 2 In fact, this goal has never been realized. Instead, there are literally hundreds {{of federal and state}} decisions interpreting this provision, which can charitably be described as inconsistent and even incoherent. And, despite the plethora of court of appeals decisions that have overruled district court decisions, and/or that have contained strong dissenting opinions, the U. S. Supreme Court has never decided a case under § 301. In short, it would not be an overstatement to describe this important provision in the Copyright Act as a 2 ̆ 2 legislative failure. 2 ̆ 2 This Article first reviews the background of the 1909 and 1976 Acts, including the rationales for copyright protection and the role played by the <b>preemption</b> <b>provision</b> in advancing those goals. This Article canvasses extensively the judicial treatment of § 301, including detailed critiques of many of these decisions. This Article also examines the constitutional aspects of preemption, including the role played by the Supremacy Clause. Most importantly, this Article seeks to provide ways to advance the original goal of the drafters of § 301, of federalizing copyright law, and of affording consistent interpretation of the preemption provisions. This Article continually returns to first principles - the goals of the drafters - and uses them to argue for expanded preemption of many state law claims...|$|E
40|$|Congress has {{enacted the}} 1976 Copyright Act {{which does not}} grant resale {{royalties}} to fine artists. It does, however, add a strong <b>preemption</b> <b>provision</b> {{that was not a}} part of the 1909 Act. This provision emphatically preempts any state law granting a right equivalent to a right granted by the federal statute to any work which is the subject matter of copyright. In its desire to increase protection for fine artists, the State of California has enacted the first droit de suite legislation in the United States, patterned after European copyright law, which extends resale royalties to fine artists. This comment demonstrates that despite the fact that the 1976 Act does not mention a resale royalty for fine artists the California Resale Royalties Act is preempted by federal law since droit de suite covers subject matter which is copyrightable and is equivalent to a right granted by the 1976 Act. The author believes that workable droit de suite legislation must be enacted and enforced on the federal level in order to allow fine artists to benefit as their work increases in value...|$|E
40|$|In 2012, California {{banned the}} sale of force-fed foie gras¾the “fatty liver” of ducks and geese. Just three years later, a federal {{district}} court overturned that ban in Association des Éleveurs de Canards et d’Oies du Québec v. Harris (Canards). Animal rights activists decried the decision as a step backwards in ethical eating. Industry groups retorted that the Poultry Products Inspection Act (PPIA) required the ruling. From a distance, several commentators inquired: was foie gras worth the fuss? This Note responds affirmatively. Section 467 (e) of the PPIA prohibits states from imposing “ingredient requirements” that are “in addition to, or different than” those made under the PPIA. The Canards court construed that provision as expressly preempting California’s foie gras ban, which¾unlike the PPIA¾mandated that foie gras products come from non-forced-fed ducks and geese. This reasoning is problematic. By literally imposing section 467 (e), the Canards court failed to rigorously analyze whether California’s ban created an ingredient requirement {{within the meaning of}} the PPIA. A proper preemption analysis requires that contextual construction. Further, the PPIA’s purpose and legislative history suggest that section 467 (e) should not be read as preempting California’s ban. The Canards court’s reasoning might have dramatic implications. Because the Federal Meat Inspection Act and the Egg Products Inspection Act contain virtually identical <b>preemption</b> <b>provisions,</b> other courts could apply the Canards court’s logic to displace state laws providing from the humane treatment of cows, pigs, and egg-laying hens. In other words, Canards could broadly eviscerate states’ ability to regulate animal cruelty. As a consequence, the foie gras fight extends far beyond ducks and geese. It may affect the food we all eat...|$|R
40|$|It is not {{uncommon}} for state legislatures and the federal government to enact laws that involve similar issues. However, the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended (ERISA) provides that state laws are preempted to the extent they relate to employee benefit plans. Since its enactment in 1974, most of the state laws that have been preempted focused on health matters. However, this is likely to change. With many of their constituents lacking adequate retirement benefits as well as the increased attention being placed on 401 (k) plans, states are likely to start attempting to legislate in the area of retirement plans. In fact, some states have already begun to propose legislation in this area. States that want to help bolster their constituents’ ability to save for retirement will enact bills designed to address the amount of workers covered by 401 (k) plans, the fees charged to these types of plans, and the adequacy of the benefits received by workers who participate in 401 (k) plans. However, a uniform system is necessary for plans to operate efficiently and effectively. Interested persons and organizations should not be required to spend their time and resources interacting with the multitude of states in addition to the federal government. Furthermore, workers should be able to take comfort that the same rules apply regardless of where they are located and that they can freely transfer between their employer’s locations without having to worry that their retirement benefits will change. As a result, ERISA’s <b>preemption</b> <b>provisions</b> should be interpreted broadly to provide a uniform set of rules for retirement plans that does not differ based on where the employer and its workers are located. This Article argues {{that the federal government is}} optimally suited to address coverage, cost, and benefit adequacy issues related to 401 (k) pla...|$|R
40|$|In an {{increasingly}} digital world, it can often feel like numbers define us. Whether {{your social security}} number, your phone number, or your credit score, the cold truth is that your identity is often boiled down to a single number. In the financial world, your credit score traditionally defines your eligibility for credit {{and the cost of}} credit, but the uses of credit scores have expanded to include premiums for insurance, employment eligibility, and other non-financial determinations. Particularly in tough financial times, small fluctuations in credit scores can have large impacts on consumers’ access to affordable credit. As furnishers and credit reporting agencies increasingly send information to each other electronically and use electronic forms for error resolution, the human element of the consumer can get lost in the translation. Credit reporting agencies investigate consumer disputes electronically by using codes to signify complicated and nuanced challenges to errors on credit reports without paying much attention to the specific claims made by consumers. In a system dominated by cold numbers, how can consumers defend their reputations and hold furnishers responsible for errors on their credit reports? This article addresses whether or not consumers can bring state claims against data furnishers and how the system can be reformed to create a more fair and efficient method of resolving credit report inaccuracies. First, this article explains the current regulation of the credit reporting market and the competing <b>preemption</b> <b>provisions</b> of the Fair Credit Reporting Act. Second, using recent case law, this article analyzes the different methods that courts use to reconcile the competing provisions of FCRA. Third, this article argues for adoption of a more inclusive standard, the recklessness standard, for state claims brought by consumers, particularly because of the industry’s movement towards electronic dispute resolution systems. Finally, this article makes recommendations to clarify preemption under the FCRA and improve the dispute process for consumers, including possible actions by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) and federal legislation...|$|R
40|$|The Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA) {{was enacted}} {{in large part}} to protect {{employee}} benefit plan participants. Yet ERISA’s broad preemption clause may actually thwart this goal in certain cases by imposing unexpected consequences on participants who die before appropriately updating their beneficiary designations. For instance, although many state laws presume divorce to revoke the former spouse’s beneficiary status, the U. S. Supreme Court’s 2001 decision in Egelhoff v. Egelhoff ex rel. Breiner made clear that ERISA preempts such state-level wills doctrines, enabling a former spouse to benefit when the deceased participant likely intended otherwise. The rationale behind this broad <b>preemption</b> <b>provision</b> applies equally to other wills doctrines such as “slayer statutes,” which prevent murderers from benefitting from their crimes. Therefore, it is likely impossible to confine the impact of this pre-emptive effect to the divorce realm. Moreover, in the wake of Kennedy v. Plan Administrator for DuPont Savings 2 ̆ 6 Investment Plan, decided by the U. S. Supreme Court in 2009, the federal common law no longer appears to be a valid solution to this problem of effecting the likely intent of deceased plan participants. Congressional action to amend ERISA is therefore necessary to avoid these inequitable results...|$|E
40|$|Expressing its {{concern about}} growing rates {{of cancer and}} other diseases, coupled {{with the lack of}} data about the effect of the {{thousands}} of chemicals used in U. S. society, in 1976 Congress enacted the Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA). Congress intended for TSCA to shed new light on chemical risks and provide the U. S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) with a set of tools to address those risks and protect human health and the environment. In the years since TSCA’s passage, the procedural hurdles and the difficult-to-meet legal standards built into the statute, along with a court decision rejecting EPA’s use of its authority to ban dangerous chemicals, have impeded EPA’s ability to regulate chemical use and manufacture. This Comment argues that both the EPA and state governments have the authority to act now to address the risks posed by dangerous chemicals. By utilizing certain sections of the statute in new and aggressive ways, EPA can effectively address chemical risks. Further, this Comment argues that TSCA’s <b>preemption</b> <b>provision</b> affords states leeway to continue to regulate the use of chemicals within their borders. Though reform of TSCA is necessary, EPA and states can effectively protect against chemical risks in the near-term by using the full extent of their authority under the current law...|$|E

It explores {{the scope of the}} Ohio Constitution’s home rule authority, in part, by evaluating courts’ statements on the validity of several types of local ordinances, as they confront home rule and a legislative attempt at preemption. Types of local ordinances evaluated include those that prohibit or ban drilling, those that impose additional permitting fees, hearings or other requirements upon drillers, and those that pertain to more traditional exercises of zoning authority. The Article also considers some similar local control efforts in the region—in particular, in New York and Pennsylvania—which have constitutional home rule provisions similar to Ohio’s, and where, like Ohio, the shale oil and gas industry is active. By considering the constitutions, legislation, and local control efforts of nearby states that are, like Ohio, within the Utica, Marcellus, and Barnett shale plays, this Article gauges the legal circumstances under which localities might regulate the actions of the shale oil and gas industry within their borders, and under what circumstances these efforts might succeed. Because this problem presents itself throughout the country, this Article looks briefly at similar circumstances in other regions, in particular, Colorado and Texas. These states have active shale oil and gas industries, legislatures vigorously working to preempt local control, and some engaged local communities hoping to exert some influence over oil and gas activities in their jurisdictions...|$|E
40|$|We are at {{an unusual}} moment in telecommunications. We have two very live cases of entry: Internet {{protocol}} television (IPTV) and municipal wireless broadband. IPTV will create new competition with cable, satellite and over-the-air broadcast TV, promising lower prices and new services. Muni wireless {{makes it possible for}} local communities to add new broadband capabilities to compete with DSL and cable broadband. Unsurprisingly given the newness of the services, there is substantial uncertainty about whether and how these services should be regulated, and we have seen legislative action at municipal, state and federal levels. To assess that, I set forth a general framework for matching jurisdictions to tasks and consider coordination costs; information aggregation; speed; tailoring; and competence, capture and corruption. I also set forth a typology of legislative approaches: mandatory federal; default federal; uniformity by choice; experimental labs and competitive federalism; and mixed jurisdiction regulation. I also consider specific regulatory issues for telcom entry control, namely, the extent of the natural monopoly and the desired level of cross-subsidization. I consider four prior of telcom entry and regulation: cable TV franchising; control over pole attachments; the local entry <b>preemption</b> <b>provisions</b> of the 1996 Telecommunications Act; and entry into satellite broadcasting. With that framework, I turn to muni wireless and IPTV. Muni wireless turns on decisions about quintessentially local assets, such as municipal light poles, and provision of the service involves few across-jurisdiction externalities. Plus {{there are a number of}} decisions regarding the service—tradeoffs between advertising and price and disagreements over the extent of the digital divide—that suggest we should see natural variation in the services. That makes local control appropriate and we should be critical of contrary state and federal efforts. For IPTV, a critical question is the required scope of entry: to what extent will an entrant be required to build-out services to serve an entire local area? Again that turns on contested conceptions about universal service obligations and would be best addressed locally...|$|R
40|$|Federal {{preemption}} {{is perhaps}} the most important public law issueof the day. The stakes in preemption cases are enormous, as preemption determines whether the federal government or the statescontrol regulatory policy in a host of politically controversial contexts. Congress clearly has primary constitutional authority insetting federal preemption policy, but, for numerous political and practical reasons, cannot be solely responsible for its implementation. Determining which organ of the federal government is best at implementing preemption policy has therefore become the central preoccupation of the academic literature. While this comparative institutional analysis is certainly important in allocating preemptionpolicy-making business, it has elided a very important issue: Congress has an interest not only in what substantive preemption policy should be, but also in who should be primarily responsible for implementing it. In other words, there is a strategic delegation choiceto be made by Congress for which current institutional choice approaches to preemption do not fully account. This Article addresses the delegation issue by providing a framework for how Congress should be “legislating preemption. ” It identifies two previously overlooked challenges posed by delegating preemption implementation responsibility to the federal courts instead of to federal agencies. First, Congress has only weak policing tools when it delegates to federal courts, and therefore has little opportunity to correct the judiciary when it strays from Congress’s preemption policy preferences. Second, in its preemption jurisprudence, the Supreme Court has adopted what this Article terms a Centralization Default, which leads it to generally disfavor anti-preemption arguments when Congress does not provide clear instructions to the contrary. The Article then proposes that Congress respond to these challenges by drafting broad standards and creating favorable legislative history when preemption policy coincides with the Centralization Default. By contrast, Congress should draft clear rules when it wants to overcome the Centralization Default. After developing the “legislating preemption” framework, the Article uses the Dodd-Frank Act’s national bank <b>preemption</b> <b>provisions</b> to illustrate what happens when Congress does not apply the framework. As the Article shows, Congress’s failure to account for its weak post-delegation policing tools or the Centralization Default will likely lead to more federal preemption than Congress intended...|$|R
40|$|After {{nearly thirty}} years, the judicially crafted Chevron and Skidmore judicial-review doctrines have found new life as exotic, yet familiar, {{legislative}} tools. When Chevron deference applies, courts employ two steps: they consider whether the statutory provision {{at issue is}} ambiguous, and, if so, they defer to an administering agency’s reasonable interpretation. Skidmore deference, in contrast, is a less deferential regime in which courts assume interpretative primacy over statutory ambiguities but defer to agency action based on four factors — the agency’s thoroughness, reasoning, consistency, and overall persuasiveness. In the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, Congress directed courts to review the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency’s (OCC) decisions to preempt state law under Skidmore’s four criteria. It also provided a savings clause that permitted Chevron deference for other OCC determinations. This {{was the first time}} that Congress codified either Skidmore or Chevron. By doing so, Congress itself used the judicially choreographed Chevron two-step and Skidmore quadrille — to which I refer collectively as Chevmore — to inform ongoing debates in administrative law. In this Essay for the Fordham Law Review symposium Chevron at 30 : Looking Back and Looking Forward, I focus on one way in which Chevmore codification can improve administrative law: encouraging agencies to improve their expertise in preempting state law (or “agency preemption”). To do so, I present a case study of Congress’s response to the OCC’s controversial preemption of state consumer-protection law. I begin in Part I by focusing on administrative expertise’s role in Chevmore deference generally and in agency preemption specifically. With expertise’s doctrinal and normative place in mind, I explain in Part II. A that, because of the OCC’s conflicts of interest and purported status as a “captured” agency, the agency’s broad preemption rulings were most likely not the product of agency expertise. I continue in Part II. B to argue that, with Dodd-Frank’s substantive and procedural <b>preemption</b> <b>provisions</b> (including its codified Skidmore provision), Congress did more than establish its disapproval of the OCC’s broad preemption rulings. Instead, it confronted the conflict and capture concerns by encouraging the OCC to develop and use its preemption expertise. It did so by codifying the appropriate preemption standard, establishing various procedural requirements for the OCC to support its decisions with data, and limiting judicial deference (through Skidmore codification) to the OCC’s preemption decisions. Despite Congress’s largely successful attempt to encourage agency expertise, I briefly conclude in Part II. C by considering how Congress can further improve agencies’ expertise as to preemption specifically and other matters generally. Congress can lead agencies to consider how their technical and administrative expertise interacts with federalism values by requiring the agencies to consider those values and consult with affected parties. Congress can also use Chevmore codification to improve agencies’ use of technical and administrative expertise both in and outside of the preemption context by allowing agencies to exchange Skidmore deference for Chevron deference when they develop and apply their expertise to certain matters...|$|R
40|$|The {{comprehensive}} federal {{scheme for}} regulating pension and other employee benefit plans, ERISA, is approaching its fifteenth anniversary. ERISA {{has attracted a}} large administrative gloss and a burgeoning case law. Experience has begun to show {{the effects of the}} statute. Parts of ERISA appear to have worked smoothly. The reporting and disclosure provisions that were a central goal of the legislation have been implemented without much ruckus. Another major goal of the statute, the vesting scheme that restricts the forfeiture of pension benefits, has also proved easy to institute. The disclosure and vesting rules have produced scant litigation. Other parts of ERISA have become much more problematic. The overbroad <b>preemption</b> <b>provision</b> has wreaked aimless interference upon state regulation of areas such as health insurance that are quite peripheral to pension policy. Neither a substantial string of Supreme Court cases nor occasional Congressional repair has been able to cure the mess. Another well known instance of statutory shortsightedness is ERISA 2 ̆ 7 s effort to regulate the financial affairs of multiemployer plans. The 1974 legislation insisted on covering these plans without working out the principles, which Congress had to supply by amendment in 1980. The 1980 amendment imposed unexpected and dismaying retroactive liabilities on employers. Although the Supreme Court has mostly sustained the constitutionality of the scheme, employer resistance to participation in multiemployer plans has increased, and there is reason to think that the legislation may ultimately be seen to have doomed the multiemployer system. Yet another instance of serious disorder in ERISA is the insurance system that protects workers 2 ̆ 7 pension benefits in the event that a plan defaults. Because the program rewards moral hazard, the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation (the federal insurer whose duty is to suffer the consequences) has amassed a deficit that is growing by billions and that makes the program inherently unstable...|$|E
40|$|Even {{before the}} nuclear core meltdowns at the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear {{reactors}} in Japan re-stoked public anxiety about nuclear energy, Vermont’s Senate, {{under the auspices}} of Vermont Act No. 160, voted to block continued operation of Vermont Yankee Nuclear Power Plant after the expiration of its forty-year operating license. This article examines whether a state can legislatively override a permit issued by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission extending the license of a power plant. The author places this question within a broader federalism context, in which states assert their sovereign rights to regulate the environment in the shadow of federal mandates. She finds persuasive the absence of an express <b>preemption</b> <b>provision</b> in the Atomic Energy Act (AEA) or language mandating the use of nuclear power, the AEA’s reservation of state authority over the generation, sale, and transmission of energy produced by nuclear power plants, and the passage of environmental laws giving states regulatory authority over some aspects of nuclear power plant operation. Additionally, the author argues that policy arguments favoring preemption, such as the need for uniformity and coordination of shared resources, superior federal resources and technical knowledge, and prevention of spillover effects do not apply in this situation; while arguments against preemption, such as preserving states as robust centers of governance and regulatory experimentation and as checks on federal government excesses and errors, and avoidance of regulatory gaps and regulatory capture, do. Even collective action problems, which arise when a state thinks solely of its own interests to the detriment of other states or {{the nation as a whole}} and often favor preemption, are weak. An argument that Vermont’s initiative may derail recent national efforts to “restart” the nuclear power industry as a way to reduce the nation’s dependence on foreign oil and its global carbon footprint also gains little traction. For these and other reasons, the author concludes that Vermont Act. No. 160 should withstand a preemption challenge...|$|E
40|$|Presently, {{broadcasters}} {{and cable}} television companies {{deal directly with}} the two baseball leagues and the individual clubs, which in turn purport to sell all of the rights regarding the televising of the games. The players {{wanted to be a}} part of those contracts to get a bigger share of the television revenues. In the Baltimore Orioles case both sides sought a judicial resolution of their rights in the telecasts. The baseball players 2 ̆ 7 demand was based on their rights of publicity in their performances. This common law right allegedly precluded the clubs and the leagues from contracting with the broadcasters for televising the players 2 ̆ 7 performances without first obtaining their express consent. Thus, the players asserted that the telecasts of major league games were unauthorized and, therefore, infringed their property rights. In response, the clubs alleged that they owned the exclusive right to broadcast the games as well as all rights in the telecasts. The opinions in the Baltimore Orioles litigation are seriously flawed. The courts did not correctly analyze what protection the Copyright Act extends to the telecast of a live event and both courts erroneously applied the Act 2 ̆ 7 s <b>preemption</b> <b>provision</b> so expansively that right of publicity claims appear to be extinguished whenever the exploited aspect of an individual 2 ̆ 7 s persona is contained in a copyrighted work. This article discusses the opinions in Baltimore Orioles, Inc., v. Major League Baseball Players Association and analyzes the nature and scope of the protection copyright grants to the telecast of a live event such as a baseball game. It points out the flaws in the opinions and demonstrates why the rights of publicity which professional athletes have in their performances should not be preempted whenever those performances are embodied in copyrighted audiovisual works. The last section explains why this article 2 ̆ 7 s arguments against federal preemption should also preserve the publicity interests that actors, singers, and other entertainers have in their acts, routines, and performing styles whether or not their performances are fixed in copyrighted works...|$|E
40|$|In {{an era of}} {{regulatory}} skepticism, proponents of regulation in general and environmental regulation in particular face {{a number of new}} political and legal hurdles, particularly at the federal level. Frustrated with federal inaction or weak federal regulation, it is increasingly common for states and local governments to adopt environmental laws that seek to provide greater environmental protection. The critical question is when federal environmental law provides a ceiling, preempting such state regulatory programs. In this article, which is part of a forthcoming symposium on federal preemption in the Northwestern Law Review, Professors Glicksman and Levy develop a framework for evaluating ceiling preemption issues in the environmental law arena and then apply it to the specific problem of state regulation of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions that contribute to global climate change. Traditional preemption doctrine emphasizes the purpose of federal laws, which is relevant to all three major forms of preemption: express, occupation of the field, and conflict preemption (including state laws that are an obstacle to the accomplishment of the object and purpose of federal law). Few environmental statutes expressly preempt more stringent state laws. The values of federalism, political process theory, and textualism support a presumption against implied preemption that should only be overcome if there is a direct conflict between federal and state law or state regulation would compromise a clear and primary purpose of a federal statute. The question then becomes which environmental purposes might provide sufficient justification to overcome the presumption and support ceiling preemption. Federal environmental law emerged largely as a response to various collective action problems that tended to prevent states, acting individually, from adopting appropriate environmental laws. Such concerns included negative externalities, the need for resource pooling, the 2 ̆ 2 race to the bottom 2 ̆ 2 phenomenon, the rationalization of standards (uniformity), and the so-called NIMBY (not in my back yard) problem. In considering the problem of ceiling preemption, then, it makes sense to ask whether the collective action problem in question is implicated by state regulation that is more protective of the environment than federal regulation. In general terms, negative externalities, resource pooling issues, and the race to the bottom can be expected to cause underregulation by states, and thus do not support ceiling preemption. In contrast, uniformity and NIMBY concerns would tend to support ceiling preemption. Using this basic framework, the article offers a detailed analysis of state regulation of GHG emissions, which industry has argued is preempted by federal law, including the Clean Air Act. This analysis suggests that the primary purposes of the Act, which include controlling negative externalities, taking advantage of resource pooling, and preventing a race to the bottom, do not generally support ceiling preemption. Although resource pooling might support ceiling preemption as a means of strengthening the bargaining position of the Unites States vis-à-vis other countries, this purpose was not a significant concern when the Act was adopted. The need for uniformity supports limited ceiling preemption for mobile sources of emissions (i. e., cars and trucks), which are subject to express <b>preemption</b> <b>provisions.</b> Uniformity concerns are less significant for stationary sources, and there is little evidence to support broad ceiling preemption on this basis. Finally, NIMBY concerns were not an important factor in the adoption of the Clean Air Act. The article also considers the implications of the framework for preemption under a cap and trade program, which is the likely form that any federal regulatory program for GHG emissions would take...|$|R
40|$|The Securities and Exchange Commission (2 ̆ 2 SEC 2 ̆ 2) {{recently}} {{adopted a}} novel exemption from the registration {{requirements of the}} Securities Act of 1933. This new exemption, Regulation CE, contains a single rule, Rule 1001, that exempts from registration 2 ̆ 2 [o]ffers and sales of securities that satisfy the conditions of paragraph (n) of Sec. 25102 of the California Corporations Code [...] 2 ̆ 2 California section 25102 (n), in turn, exempts offerings to 2 ̆ 2 qualified purchasers 2 ̆ 2 and includes a 2 ̆ 2 test-the- waters 2 ̆ 2 provision that allows issuers to solicit purchasers in writing, even if non-qualified investors receive the solicitation. Regulation CE {{is part of the}} SEC 2 ̆ 7 s continuing effort to ease the regulatory burdens on small businesses issuing securities. The intent of the regulation is to facilitate capital raising by small businesses by providing a coordinated federal-state exemption, without sacrificing investor protection. Regulation CE is the first coordinated federal-state exemption that defers to the state exemption. While states have previously adopted exemptions from state registration tied to compliance with federal exemptions, this is the first transaction exemption adopted by the SEC that defers to a state exemption. The basic idea underlying Regulation CE-allowing issuers to solicit qualified purchasers-is sensible, but the SEC 2 ̆ 7 s execution of that idea creates a regulatory quagmire. In essence, the SEC is giving California authorities the power to determine the scope of an exemption from federal securities law. Regulation CE 2 ̆ 7 s delegation of authority to California state officials probably exceeds the SEC 2 ̆ 7 s regulatory authority. In addition, the language of Regulation CE effectively allows California officials to amend the federal exemption without further proceedings at the federal level-a possible violation of the federal Administrative Procedure Act. Finally, applying Regulation CE to so-called 2 ̆ 2 covered securities 2 ̆ 2 violates the <b>preemption</b> <b>provisions</b> Congress recently added to section 18 of the Securities Act. Even if Regulation CE is valid, the interaction of federal law and California law presents difficult interpretive questions. For instance, as drafted, calculation of the 2 ̆ 2 aggregate offering price 2 ̆ 2 of a Regulation CE offering is troublesome. Additionally, the application of the integration doctrine to Regulation CE offerings is confusing. If the SEC had drafted the regulation more carefully, these problems could have been avoided. This article first introduces and outlines the Regulation CE exemption- a task that can only be fully accomplished by also reviewing the requirements of section 25102 (n) of the California Corporations Code. The accompanying appendix to this article focuses, in particular, on the definition of 2 ̆ 2 qualified purchaser 2 ̆ 2 and the wandering trail one must follow to give content to that term. The article then examines the SEC 2 ̆ 7 s authority to adopt an exemption like Regulation CE and whether Regulation CE is consistent with section 18 of the Securities Act. Finally, the article examines the difficult interpretive issues this new type of federalstate coordination raises-in particular, the determination of the 2 ̆ 2 aggregate offering price 2 ̆ 2 of a Regulation CE offering and the application of the integration doctrine to Regulation CE offerings...|$|R
