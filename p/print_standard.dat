The value of CCPs is well established by research and commercial practice; however, only 25 % of these products are utilized. The objective of this project {{was to develop a}} computer program containing a database of advanced analytical and comprehensive engineering information on CCPs, accessible through a user-friendly interface. Version 1. 0 of the ACAA CCP Data Manager was specifically designed to: perform multiple-criteria queries to produce a set of sample for in-depth study; view and <b>print</b> <b>standard</b> test reports, such as C 618 reports; compare and contrast analytical results in graphs and tables; graph utilization information by application and region; and save data to a file for use in other computer applications, such as spreadsheet programs. The program was designed to contain descriptive information about a given CCP sample, including sample formation data (material type, sample location, fuel type, collection device etc.), combustion system design data (steam generator type, furnace type, SO{sub 2 } and NO{sub x} control information, ash-handling configurations), test data (chemical, mineralogical, and physical characterization data), and utilization potential of the CCP. The location of the plant is identified by region. The database has been initially populated with information on over 800 CCP samples, taken from the Coal Ash Resources Research Consortium (CARRC).

40|$|OBJECTIVE: Computer-tailored and Internet-based {{interventions}} to promote physical activity behavior have shown some promise, but only few {{have been tested}} among African Americans. We examined the feasibility and efficacy of three 1 -year, multiple contact physical activity interventions (Tailored Internet, Tailored <b>Print,</b> <b>Standard</b> Internet) in a subsample of African American participants (n = 38) enrolled in a randomized controlled trial. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Participants randomly assigned to Tailored Internet and Print programs received individually tailored computer expert system feedback delivered via Internet or print. Participants in the Standard Internet program received access to six currently available physical activity Web sites. Self-reported physical activity was assessed at baseline and 6 and 12 months with the 7 -Day Physical Activity Recall. RESULTS: Across all participants, physical activity changed from 17. 24 min/week (standard deviation [SD] = 20. 72) at baseline to 139. 44 min/week (SD = 99. 20) at 6 months, to 104. 26 min/week (SD = 129. 14) at 12 months. According to available consumer satisfaction data (n = 30), 70 % reported reading {{most or all of}} the physical activity information received by Internet or mail. Most participants described the Internet- and print-based physical activity programs as "somewhat" or "very" helpful (80 %) and enjoyable (87 %). CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that computer-tailored and Internet-based interventions are able to produce long-term increases in physical activity and associated process variables among African American participants. Future studies with larger numbers of African American participants are needed to determine which of the programs (Tailored Print, Tailored Internet, Standard Internet) are more effective and what program modifications might be helpful in assisting this population in becoming more active...|$|E

This randomised control study evaluated the effects of using environmental <b>print</b> compared to <b>standard</b> <b>print</b> (the same labels in manuscript form) in an 8 -week intervention (30 min per week) to foster 3 - to 4 -year-old's (N = 73) emergent literacy skills and print motivation. At the end of the intervention, the environmental print group outperformed a no intervention control group on letter sound knowledge, letter writing, environmental <b>print</b> and <b>standard</b> <b>print</b> reading, print concepts, and print motivation, even after controlling for receptive language abilities. Most of these gains were sustained 2 months later. The environmental print group also outperformed the <b>standard</b> <b>print</b> group on print motivation and environmental print reading at post-test, and on print motivation, environmental <b>print</b> and <b>standard</b> <b>print</b> reading, and letter writing at 2 -month follow-up.

40|$|Using an Internet-based {{industry}} survey, {{the differences}} and similarities of offset and digital print demerits within the print industry are examined. Running parallel to this examination {{is a look}} at the extent to which demerit-based quality assurance procedures exist within the printing industry. The survey findings indicate that offset and digital printing processes share common color-related print demerits. What differentiates offset print demerits from digital print demerits can be attributed to two factors: (1) technology differences and (2) <b>printing</b> <b>standards.</b> Offset <b>printing,</b> given the multitude of material choices, produces more frequent print demerits, relating to non-conforming materials. Digital print demerits more likely result from technical constraints such as addressability and resolution. The other factor associated is a lack of <b>printing</b> <b>standards</b> for digital printers. While both processes show a high frequency of color-related problems, offset print providers have more tools and standards available for addressing these problems. Digital print providers, on the other hand, have few color standards or tools for solving similar problems. When examining procedures for defect prevention, the general lack of digital <b>printing</b> <b>standards</b> makes the use of formal quality assurance procedures difficult. Offset print providers {{are more likely to have}} formal quality assurance procedures for dealing with frequent and severe print demerits and formal procedures for how customer quality requirements are communicated...|$|R

40|$|Print {{buyers are}} asking {{printers}} {{to have their}} printing processes certified {{in order to become}} preferred suppliers. Comprehensive process certification is something new to printers in the US. A successful certification program requires that the certification body is independent and is technically capable, as well as a market that demands the certification. A number of printing industry influencers approached RIT in December 2008 and asked RIT to offer a process certification program to the U. S. printing industry. In 2009, a committee was formed of faculty and staff from the School of Print Media and the Printing Applications Laboratory to investigate this proposal. The committee submitted a research project proposal to the Printing Industry Center (CIAS) in November 2009 with the goal of conducting a <b>printing</b> <b>standards</b> survey in order to capture the view of printing companies regarding the role of <b>printing</b> <b>standards</b> applicable to workflow from data reception to printing. A questionnaire was designed to assess the role of standards that impact five areas of workflow: file creation and data reception, contract proof, CTP/press calibration, process control, and workflow efficiency. An Internet-based survey tool was used to implement the survey worldwide. A total of 117 companies (including 90 printers) from North America, Europe, Asia, and Mexico participated in the survey.

40|$|There is {{a limited}} {{understanding}} {{of the effects of}} practice on reading efficiency and comfort when students with low vision read <b>standard</b> <b>print</b> with optical devices. This descriptive study used a multiple baseline single-subject design to examine effects of practice on the reading rate, accuracy, duration and visual fatigue of three high school students with visual impairments when they read <b>standard</b> <b>print</b> with newly prescribed optical devices (reading spectacles). The study also examined differences between measures of reading efficiency and comfort when students read large print without optical devices and when they read <b>standard</b> <b>print</b> with optical devices. Baseline data were collected prior to intervention. Intervention consisted of daily practice sessions reading novels in <b>standard</b> <b>print</b> with individually prescribed optical devices for a maximum of thirty-eight minutes. Measures of reading efficiency and comfort were graphed daily during baseline and intervention. Oral reading rate, accuracy, and comprehension were probed during intervention and maintenance. A positive relationship between practice and oral reading rate was demonstrated for three students and a positive relationship for silent reading rate for two students. No relationship was demonstrated between practice and duration nor between practice and fatigue. One student maintained oral reading rate three weeks after cessation of practice sessions. There were no advantages for reading large <b>print</b> over reading <b>standard</b> <b>print</b> with optical devices for two of the students on measures of reading rate, accuracy, or duration; one student demonstrated no differences between reading media while the other demonstrated faster reading rates with <b>standard</b> <b>print.</b> One student demonstrated no differences in accuracy, but faster rates and longer duration with large print. Although students reported the same symptoms of visual fatigue with both media, they demonstrated more frequent occurrences of fatigue when reading <b>standard</b> <b>print</b> with optical devices. All expressed preference for reading <b>standard</b> <b>print</b> with reading spectacles. Reasons included portability, availability of materials, and social implications.
