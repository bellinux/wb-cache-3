40|$|AbstractBackgroundUlnar {{shortening}} is {{a common}} and useful method for treating ulnar wrist pain from many causes. Many devices used to perform osteotomy have been introduced in the literature; however, the devices are not universally available. The standard freehand technique is still commonly used in clinical practice; however, it is associated with several complications and is time-consuming. We present a freehand technique for ulnar-shortening osteotomy using a <b>predrilled</b> <b>hole</b> method. MethodsFrom 2011 to 2013, we performed the <b>predrilled</b> <b>hole</b> method for ulnar shortening in 18 cases using the six-hole limited-contact dynamic compression plate (LC-DCP) and in two cases using the Acumed six-hole Locking Midshaft Ulna Plate. ResultsAll patients had uneventful union, and the average operative time was 39. 7 minutes (range, 32 – 50 minutes). The average follow-up period was 21 months (range, 12 – 30 months). There were no complications except in three patients in the LC-DCP group who complained of implant irritation. Good functional outcomes were achieved with this method. ConclusionOur technique is easy and quick to use and can minimize soft-tissue manipulation. The union rate is high and complications are few...|$|E

40|$|This {{research}} includes parametric studies {{performed with}} the use of three-dimensional nonlinear finite element models in order to investigate the effects of cantilever wingwall configurations on the behavior of integral abutment bridges located on straight alignment and zero skew. The parametric studies include all three types of cantilever wingwalls; inline, flared, and U-shaped wingwalls. Bridges analyzed vary in length from 100 to 1200 feet. Soil-structure and soil-pile interaction are included in the analysis. Loadings include dead load in combination with temperature loads in both rising and falling temperatures. Plasticity in the integral abutment piles is investigated by means of nonlinear plasticity models. Cracking in the abutments and stresses in the reinforcing steel are investigated by means of nonlinear concrete models. The effects of wingwall configurations are assessed in terms of stresses in the integral abutment piles, cracking in the abutment walls, stresses in the reinforcing steel of abutment walls, and axial forces induced in the steel girders. The models developed are analyzed for three types of soil behind the abutments and wingwalls; dense sand, medium dense sand, and loose sand. In addition, the models consider both the case of presence and absence of <b>predrilled</b> <b>holes</b> at the top nine feet of piles. The soil around the piles below the <b>predrilled</b> <b>holes</b> consists of very stiff clay. The results indicate that for the stresses in the piles, the critical load is temperature contraction and the most critical parameter is the use of <b>predrilled</b> <b>holes.</b> However, for both the stresses in the reinforcing steel and the axial forces induced in the girders, the critical load is temperature expansion and the critical parameter is the bridge length. In addition, the results indicate that the use of cantilever wingwalls in integral abutment bridges results in an increase in the magnitude of axial forces in the steel girders during temperature expansion and generation of pile plasticity at shorter bridge lengths compared to bridges built without cantilever wingwalls...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe {{success of}} {{bilateral}} sequential single-lung transplantation {{has led to}} the rebirth of the transsternal bilateral thoracotomy incision. Despite the multiple advantages of this incision over a median sternotomy for this operation, one distinct disadvantage is the high prevalence of sternal disruption at the transverse sternotomy site, which is traditionally closed with sternal wires. This disruption rate is between 20 % and 40 % in most institutions and can lead to significant pain and deformity in addition to slowing the postoperative recovery and increasing the risk of sternal infection. To overcome this problem we have designed and manufactured a device that provides a sound method of fixating the sternum. The device is composed of two plates, one anterior and one posterior to the sternum, that are fixed {{to each other and to}} the sternum by means of screws into internally threaded posts positioned in <b>predrilled</b> <b>holes</b> through the bone on either side of the sternotomy. All components of the device are made from titanium and a range of post lengths are available to accommodate variability in sternal thickness. The structure of the device is demonstrated.

40|$|In {{consideration}} {{of the difficulty of}} monitoring internal deformation in dam model tests, a new optical fiber sensor based on fiber Bragg grating (FBG) technology has been developed. Quasi-distributed FBGs are installed on a slender bar (circular cross-section) along axial direction to make an FBG sensing bar. For the dam physical model in this study, FBG sensing bars can be embedded in <b>predrilled</b> <b>holes</b> within the dam structure and the dam foundation. When the dam is loaded by hydraulic jacks and dam deformations occur, the sensing bar works like an elastic beam under arbitrary transverse and axial loading. According to the bending beam theory, the distribution of both horizontal and vertical displacements can be calculated from the strains measured by the FBGs. The two sensing bars used in the test were calibrated in the laboratory before testing. The calibration results have shown that the displacements measured by the sensing bars were in good agreement with those obtained using other conventional gauges. Recently a two-dimensional gravity dam model was constructed and instrumented with two embedded FBG sensing bars, together with surface mounted displacement transducers and strain rosettes. In the overload test, all the sensors were used to perform real-time monitoring of the model dam deformation. Major monitoring results are presented, compared and analyzed. The displacements measured by the FBG sensing bars in the dam model test are in good agreement with those from displacement transducers. The test results also reveal the deformation mechanism and failure mode of the gravity dam. 考虑到大坝模型试验中内部变形难以监测的现状,研制了一种新型的基于光纤布拉格光栅(FBG) 技术的光纤传感器。这种传感器为圆棒式结构,其表面沿轴向安装了准分布式的光纤布拉格光栅。对于大坝物理模型,该传感器可预埋入坝体和坝基的内部。当大坝受到油压千斤顶荷载产生变形时,该传感器类似于一根一端固定并同时受轴向拉、压和横向弯曲的弹性梁。根据弯梁原理,由光纤布拉格光栅测得的应变结果可反算出大坝沿水平向和竖向的位移分布。室内标定试验结果表明,该传感器测得的变形量与其他常规传感器的读数一致。在一个二维混凝土重力坝物理模型的超载破坏试验中,采用预埋于坝体、坝基内部的光纤传感器以及表面安装式位移计、电阻应变花对该模型进行实时的变形监测。试验结果验证了该光纤传感器在大坝模型内部变形监测中的有效性,同时也揭示了大坝在超载作用下的变形机制和破坏形态。Department of Civil and Environmental Engineerin...|$|R
40|$|The highway {{departments}} {{of the states}} which use integral abutments in bridge design were contacted in order to study the extent of integral abutment use in skewed bridges and to survey the different guidelines used for analysis and design of integral abutments in skewed bridges. The variation in design assumptions and pile orientations among the various states in their approach {{to the use of}} integral abutments on skewed bridges is discussed. The problems associated with the treatment of the approach slab, backfill, and pile cap, and the reason for using different pile orientations are summarized in the report. An algorithm based on a state-of-the-art nonlinear finite element procedure previously developed by the authors was modified and used to study the influence of different factors on behavior of piles in integral abutment bridges. An idealized integral abutment was introduced by assuming that the pile is rigidly cast into the pile cap and that the approach slab offers no resistance to lateral thermal expansion. Passive soil and shear resistance of the cap are neglected in design. A 40 -foot H pile (HP 10 X 42) in six typical Iowa soils was analyzed for fully restrained pile head and pinned pile head. According to numerical results, the maximum safe length for fully restrained pile head is one-half the maximum safe length for pinned pile head. If the pile head is partially restrained, the maximum safe length will lie between the two limits. The numerical results from an investigation of the effect of <b>predrilled</b> oversized <b>holes</b> indicate that if the length of the <b>predrilled</b> oversized <b>hole</b> is at least 4 feet below the ground, the vertical load-carrying capacity of the H pile is only reduced by 10 percent for 4 inches of lateral displacement in very stiff clay. With no <b>predrilled</b> oversized <b>hole,</b> the pile failed before the 4 -inch lateral displacement was reached. Thus, the maximum safe lengths for integral abutment bridges may be increased by predrilling. Four different typical Iowa layered soils were selected and used in this investigation. In certain situations, compacted soil (> 50 blow count in standard penetration tests) is used as fill on top of natural soil. The numerical results showed that the critical conditions will depend on the length of the compacted soil. If the length of the compacted soil exceeds 4 feet, the failure mechanism for the pile is similar to one in a layer of very stiff clay. That is, the vertical load-carrying capacity of the H pile will be greatly reduced as the specified lateral displacement increases...|$|R

Based on the better understanding of bamboo structural, physical and mechanical performance [2], bamboo is extremely potential to be utilized as an engineering structure material [3]. However, lack of strong and reliable connection restricts its further application in construction. At present, there are many types of connections used in timber structures in the residential or commercial houses, including nailed connections [4], bolted connections [5], dowel connections [6 – 9] and adhesive bonded steel connection. Epoxy bonded steel connection, which is used in bamboo timbers, is that a threaded steel bar is placed into <b>predrilled</b> <b>holes</b> in timber members and bonded with epoxy resin. The embedded steel bar with the epoxy bonding agent allow a strong connection to be made with increased stiffness of the joint and the structure could be also kept for its excellent esthetic appeal and fire resistance without any cover [10, 11].

40|$|Abstract: Background. In a {{previous}} study at our institution, {{it was determined that}} resorbable screws with untapped drill holes resulted in the highest resistance forces to linear load when compared with titanium screws. The 1. 1 -mm drill diameter/ 2. 0 -mm screw diameter and 1. 5 / 2. 0 drill/screw combinations were superior to the 1. 1 / 1. 5 combinations; however, there was no conclusion as to the best screw size to drill bit diameter. The aim of this prospective study was to compare the pullout strength of resorbable screws in fresh frozen cadaveric laryn-geal cartilage. The importance of drill hole diameter will also be determined. Methods. After debridement of connective tissue and peri-chondrium, 12 cartilage specimens were tested. Linear pullout strength of screws was measured using a load cell. Resorbable screws of size 2. 0 mm were tested using drill hole diameters of 0. 0 mm, 0. 8 mm, and 1. 5 mm. All tested screws were 6 mm in length or greater. Results. We found no strong evidence that the means for the 0. 8 / 2. 0 and 1. 5 / 2. 0 differ or that the 0. 0 / 2. 0 and 0. 8 / 2. 0 means differ. There is evidence that the 0. 0 / 2. 0 and 1. 5 / 2. 0 means differ (adjusted p value. 0108), with the 0. 0 / 2. 0 combination having a smaller mean. Conclusions.

40|$|Bolts, rivets and {{location}} pins {{are commonly used}} in various engineering applications for assembly of components and structures. The holes produced for the assembly is susceptible to cracks due to fatigue caused by tensile loads applied. These cracks can be prevented or its propagation can be prolonged by inducing compressive residual stress in the material around the hole. Cold expansion hole {{is one of the}} techniques used to induce compressive stress zone, by inserting a tapered mandrel/pin or ball into an undersized hole. A novel application of the cold expansion and surface modification of walls of the cylindrical <b>hole</b> is presented. <b>Predrilled</b> <b>holes</b> of different diameters in commercially available aluminum and Al- 2014 -T 6 aluminum alloy plates are cold expanded using a specially fabricated tapered tool that rotates and simultaneously traverses through the hole. The tapered tool expands the hole to the desired diameter and also stirs the internal wall of the hole. In order to understand the role of frictional heating and stirring in the cold expansion of holes three mediums, namely, dry (without cooling and lubricating), metal working fluid (cooling and lubricating) and Al 2 O 3 nanoparticles (lubricating and frictional heating) are used. The residual stress, surface roughness and hardness of the wall of the holes are measured and SEM images are captured. Significant residual stresses are induced in the material around the hole region. Significant hardness improvement with reasonable surface finish is obtained. Moreover the cold expanded holes showed considerable improvement in the fatigue life of the holes. The fatigue life is found to be directly proportional to residual stresses induced around the hole and inversely proportional to surface roughness. Hardness has a negative impact on fatigue life. The rotating tool cold expansion process is compared with conventional cold expansion process and good efficiency of cold expansion is achieved in case of Al- 2014 -T 6 aluminum alloy material using nanoparticles, in terms of fatigue life achieved. It is observed that frictional heating and the plastic deformation have combined effect on the performance of the cold expansion of cylindrical holes...|$|R
40|$|Light and {{flexible}} protective constructions in aluminium could {{be subjected to}} a blast load. In this thesis the effect of blast loading on aluminium plates of the type 1050 A ? H 14 was studied through experiments and numerical simulations. The effect of fragmentation was idealized with <b>predrilled</b> <b>holes.</b> The thesis was written at the Structural Impact Laboratory (SIMLab) at NTNU {{in collaboration with the}} Norwegian Defence Estates Agency (NDEA). Tensile tests revealed a clearly anisotropic behavior of the 1050 A ? H 14 material. However, preliminary studies indicated that the grain direction had a minimal impact on the plate deformation, and that the modified Johnson-Cook material model was a sufficient approach. It was performed experiments with the gas gun at SIMLab to apply blast loading on aluminium plates. The gas gun showed excellent repeatability, but the pressure and impulse it caused did not emulate a real explosion. It seemed that the loading applied from the gas gun was asymmetric and varied over the plate. Thus, the experimental setup needs to be modified in order to get more insight into the problem. No fracture occurred in the gas gun experiments. Numerical simulations in LS-DYNA were used to validate the load curves obtained from the experiments. The load curves was obtained through pressure transducers that were placed on &# 188; of the aluminium plate, and the numerical analysis showed that these values were not representative for the loading that occurred on the entire plate. The aluminium plates with diamond shaped holes and slits showed similar capacity as the plates without holes for small loads. Digital Image Correlation (DIC) was used to describe the plate deformation, and proved to be an accurate method to compare the results from the numerical simulation in LS-DYNA to the gas gun experiments. Numerical analyses with the finite element software IMPETUS Afea was used to simulate blast loading {{with the use of the}} Corpuscular method. The results indicated that the geometry of the charge affected the magnitude of the blast load in a significant way. IMPETUS Afea seems to be not suited to simulate long-range blast loading. </p...|$|R
40|$|This Doctorate program {{focuses on}} the shear {{strengthening}} of reinforced concrete (RC) beams using fibre-reinforced polymers (FRP) composites. Several research problems related to shear strengthening still linger and therefore require further research studies to be entirely solved. The main objective of this program is to experimentally and analytically study the FRP strengthening methods of full-scale RC T-section beams in shear. During this Ph. D. program major aspects related to shear strengthening of RC beams with fibre-reinforced polymers (FRP) sheets and rods are investigated as follows: 1) Shear strengthening of RC beams with externally-bonded (EB) FRP-Influencing factors and conceptual debonding model: On {{the basis of this}} effort, a new design approach is proposed to calculate the shear contribution of the FRP considering the effect of the transverse steel (among other influencing parameters) on the FRP contribution in shear resistance. The proposed model shows the best correlation with experimental results in comparison with the current design codes and guidelines; 2) Performance of end-anchorage systems for RC beams strengthened in shear with epoxy-bonded FRP composites: The results of this study reveal that specimens retrofitted with EB FRP methods and properly designed end-anchorage systems can achieve a superior contribution to shear resistance compared to specimens strengthened using EB FRP with no anchorage and Near-Surface Mounted (NSM) rebar method; 3) Shear strengthening of RC beams with EB FRP- Effect of strip-width to strip-spacing ratio: An experimental and analytical investigation with emphasis on the effect of strip-width to strip-spacing ratio on the contribution of FRP (Vf) in shear strengthened of RC beams with EB FRP strips is carried out; and 4) Behaviour of RC beams strengthened in shear using embedded through-section (ETS) FRP rods method: A newly developed shear strengthening method is investigated Embedded through-section (ETS) FRP rod method is a promising method for strengthening RC beams in shear using FRP rods. In the ETS method, FRP rods are epoxy-bonded to <b>predrilled</b> <b>holes</b> through the cross section of the RC beams. The test results not only confirmed the feasibility of the ETS method, but also revealed that the performance of the beams strengthened using this method is significantly superior to that of the beams strengthened with EB FRP and NSM FRP methods...|$|R
40|$|Improved Fumigants After 14 years, chloropicrin, Vapam and Vorlex {{continue}} to effectively control internal decay of pressure-treated Douglas-fir transmission poles, but 6 years after application of methylisothiocyanate (MIT) some poles are becoming reinfested by decay fungi although NIT residues remain high in these poles. The closed-tube bioassay, developed through our research, {{is an effective}} method for detecting fumigant persistance, and future studies will aim at determining the actual fumigant concentrations detected in wood by this bioassay. A study of MIT movement through Douglas-fir pole sections following treatment with gelatin encapsulated MIT was completed and results indicate that addition of small quantities of water along with the capsules will give excellent fumigant release and movement into the wood. Decay fungi were virtually eliminated from in service transmission poles 21 months after treatment with gelatin encapsulated MIT near the groundline. In poles treated up to 12 feet above the groundline with encapsulated MIT and chloropicrin, no decay fungi could be isolated 1 year after treatment. Both fumigants were well distributed through the poles and appear to have moved laterally from the treatment holes. One {{of the goals of}} our research has been eventual fumigant application to poles at the treatment plant shortly after conventional preservative treatments. This would provide <b>predrilled</b> <b>holes</b> for later fumigant retreatment and would effectively protect the entire i iipole cross section. While the most economical application method would involve incorporating the fumigant treatment holes into the conventional predrilling process, it would also result in preservative treated fumigant holes. Consequently we have initiated studies to determine the influence of creosote and pentachlorophenol on fumigant movement into treated wood. Preliminary results indicate that creosote and P- 9 penta base oil slow movement of MIT into wood but do not prevent the build up of fungitoxic concentrations in the wood. The new, pelletized MIT formulation has been evaluated in our laboratory assay for wood fumigants. The results indicate that pelletized MIT is as effective as pure MIT on an active ingredient basis. Since pelletized MIT has many similar application and safety advantages as encapsulated MIT, we intend to further evaluate pellets in poles in service.
