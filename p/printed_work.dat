Although Parker claimed in a letter that he was the author, it is likely that at the very least Joscelyn did most of the research, and the manuscript of the work, which is now Vitellius E xiv, is largely in his handwriting. Further, Parker's son, after the archbishop's death, noted beside the bequest notation for Joscelyn's brother Thomas that John Joscelyn was the author of the work.|$|E

25|$|The first {{printing}} {{which carries}} Mentelin's name is Augustine's Tractatus de arte praedicandi {{from the year}} 1465. However, {{it is assumed that}} Mentelin had already begun to print significantly earlier, probably even already in 1458. His oldest known <b>printed</b> <b>work</b> is a Latin Bible printed with 49 lines per page ("B49"), whose first volume is dated 1460. As Gutenberg's Bible was printed with 42 lines per page, Mentelin's had fewer pages and proved handier.|$|E
25|$|After {{the end of}} {{editing and}} design work, the {{printing}} phase begins. The first step involves {{the production of a}} pre-press proof, which the printers send for final checking and sign-off by the publisher. This proof shows the book precisely as it will appear once printed and represents the final opportunity for the publisher to find and correct any errors. Some printing companies use electronic proofs rather than printed proofs. Once the publisher has approved the proofs, printing – the physical production of the <b>printed</b> <b>work</b> – begins.|$|E
25|$|In writing 1632, Flint's web forum Mutter of Demons at Baen's Bar {{was soon}} {{taken over by}} {{exploratory}} posts as captivated readers commented on the E-ARC released book, creating a ground swell of interest ("Internet buzz") {{in the months before}} its hardcover release. So strong was the response, especially after the release of the <b>printed</b> <b>work,</b> that a new 1632 Tech Manual sub-forum was created for discussions about it in early 2000, for the discussions had also spilled over into Weber's Bu-ships tech forum, and Weber joined the bandwagon by suggesting a sequel was in order. In the event, the two co-wrote 1633 and collaborated further on integrating the short fiction (much of it unsolicited) into the de facto Ring of Fire sequel. It was followed by two other related forums: 1632 Slush and 1632 Comments, within the next two years.|$|E

25|$|Forman's {{papers have}} proven to be a {{treasure}} trove of rare, odd, unusual data {{on one of the most}} studied periods of cultural history. They include autobiographies, guides to astrology, plague tracts, alchemical commonplace books and notes on biblical and historical subjects. They also contain his disputes with the Company of Barber-Surgeons and his largely unsuccessful magical experiments. At one time he possessed the copy of the Picatrix currently in the British Library. Forman left behind a large body of manuscripts dealing with his patients and with all the subjects that interested him, from astronomy and astrology to medicine, mathematics, and magic. His Casebook is the most famous of these resources, though he also produced diaries and a third-person autobiography. His only <b>printed</b> <b>work</b> was a pamphlet advertising a bogus method for divining the longitude while at sea.|$|E
500|$|Catholic school {{textbooks}} in the vilayet included a geography book (Kratka zemljopisna početnica s dodatkom o Bosni, 1869) by Franjo Ž. Franjković, an alphabet book with elements of religious education (Bukvar s napomenkom članakah nauka vjere za katoličku mladež u Bosni, 1869), and another geography book (Početni zemljopis za katoličke učionice u Bosni, 1871) by the Franciscan Grgo Martić. The Catholic bishop of Mostar Paškal Buconjić financed the printing of an Ottoman Turkish grammar in 1871. The Hebrew books included Meshek Beti (...) and Appe Zutre (...) , which list religious observances, respectively, on Shabbat and Passover, {{and a small}} liturgical book titled Tikkun Moda'ah. These were composed around 1875 by the Sarajevo Rabbi Eliezer Papo.

500|$|Evelyn Waugh, born in 1903, was {{the younger}} son of Arthur Waugh, the {{managing}} director of the London publishing firm of Chapman & Hall. After attending Lancing College and Hertford College, Oxford, Waugh taught for three years in a series of private preparatory schools before beginning his career as a writer. His first commercially <b>printed</b> <b>work</b> was a short story, [...] "The Balance", which Chapman and Hall included in a 1926 anthology. He worked briefly as a Daily Express reporter, and wrote a short biography of the pre-Raphaelite painter Dante Gabriel Rossetti before achieving success in 1928 with the publication of his comic novel, Decline and Fall. By the end of 1932 Waugh had written two further novels, Vile Bodies and Black Mischief, and two travel books. His professional successes coincided with private upheavals; in June 1928 he married Evelyn Gardner, but just over a year later the marriage ended when she declared her love for the couple's mutual friend John Heygate. Reconciliation proved impossible, and Waugh filed for divorce in September 1929. At the same time, Waugh was undergoing instruction which led to his reception, in September 1930, into the Roman Catholic Church.|$|E

500|$|In early 1929 Gernsback went bankrupt, and his {{magazines}} {{were sold}} to Bergan A. Mackinnon; both Amazing Stories and Amazing Stories Quarterly continued publication under their new ownership, and Sloane remained as editor. [...] Within two months Gernsback had launched two new magazines, Air Wonder Stories and Science Wonder Stories. [...] Gernsback still believed in the educational value of science fiction, and contrasted his goals for Air Wonder Stories with the fiction appearing in aviation pulps such as Sky Birds and Flying Aces, which were [...] "purely 'Wild-West'-world war adventure-sky busting" [...] stories, in his words. [...] He planned to fill Air Wonder with [...] "flying stories of the future, strictly along scientific-mechanical-technical lines, full of adventure, exploration and achievement". [...] Both Air Wonder and Science Wonder were edited by David Lasser, who had no prior experience as an editor and who knew little about sf, but whose degree from MIT had convinced Gernsback to take him on. [...] Lasser <b>printed</b> <b>work</b> by some popular authors, including Fletcher Pratt, Stanton Coblentz, and David H. Keller, {{and two of the}} winners of the contests Gernsback frequently ran subsequently became well known in the field: Raymond Palmer, later the editor of Amazing Stories, and John Wyndham, best known for his 1951 novel The Day of the Triffids. [...] The readership of the two magazines overlapped strongly, most readers being science fiction fans rather than aviation fans. [...] With these two titles established, Gernsback added Science Wonder Quarterly in October 1929, also edited by Lasser. [...] At the same time Gernsback sent a letter to some of the writers he had already bought stories from, asking for [...] "detective or criminal mystery stories with a good scientific background", and in January 1930 he launched Scientific Detective Monthly, edited by his deputy, Hector Grey, as a new cross-genre title, giving him four magazines in all.|$|E

2500|$|Gorgona was a {{group of}} artists active in Zagreb between 1959 and 1966, that {{advocated}} non-conventional forms of visual art expression. It included the painters Josip Vaništa, Julije Knifer, [...] Marijan Jevšovar, Đuro Seder, sculptor Ivan Kožarić, art theoreticians and critics Radoslav Putar, Matko Meštrović, Dimitrije Bašičević (Mangelos), and architect Miljenko Horvat. Individually they were significant representatives of their own artistic fields, and together they had a major impact on the direction of contemporary art in Croatia. Besides working in more traditional techniques, they pioneered radical forms of artistic expression related to existentialism, neo-dadaism and proto-conceptualism. Their anti-magazine Gorgona (11 issues published 1961-1966) was simply designed, each edition intended to showcase the work and views of a single artist and was in itself a <b>printed</b> <b>work</b> of art. The group was preoccupied by the absurd, sent people invitations [...] for events that never took place, placed ads for the sale of trivial objects, planned unfeasible projects, and {{even went so far as}} to exclude the audience to have the whole place for themselves. The Gorgona publication, and the group's activities raised interest in international art circles - and they had frequent contact with such artists as Dieter Roth, Victor Vasarely, Piero Manzoni, Lucio Fontana and Robert Rauschenberg.|$|E

His editor, Laing, bids us observe [...] "that all these opprobrious terms are copied from Foxe, or rather from the black letter tract." [...] But the black letter tract, I conceive, must be Knox's own.

He showed us Dryden's translation of Virgil, with Dr. Johnson's autograph in it and a large collection of Bibles, of all dates,--church Bibles, family Bibles of the common translation, and older ones. He says he has written or is writing a history of the Bible (as a <b>printed</b> <b>work,</b> I presume). Many of these Bibles had, no doubt, been in actual and daily use from generation to generation; but they were now all splendidly bound, and were likewise very clean and smooth,--in fact, every leaf had been cleansed by a delicate process, a part of which consisted in soaking the whole book in a tub of water, during several days. Mr. ------ is likewise rich in manuscripts, having a Spanish document with the signature of the son of Columbus; a whole little volume in Franklin's handwriting, being the first specimen of it; and the original manuscripts of many of the songs of Burns. Among these I saw [...] "Auld Lang Syne," [...] and [...] "Bruce's Address to his Army."
