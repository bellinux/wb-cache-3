50|$|A further {{addition}} {{which opened}} in 2011 was the education centre which was created as a renovation of the old soft bill aviary. The pheasants and kookaburras which lived in the soft bill aviary were {{moved to a new}} pheasantry along the front of the tropical house, while a group of Old English Game fowl from the building now join the other free roaming animals (including peafowl, helmeted guineafowl, silver <b>pheasant,</b> <b>chicken</b> and Parma wallaby). This new centre houses a hands on animal encounter hall in which both schools and general visitors are given the chance to hold bearded dragons, corn snake and a Chilean rose tarantula, while being given an educational talk about them. On the adjoining side there is also a museum which displays a variety of items which have been seized by HM customs at Heathrow Airport and donated to the park, a display of tribal artefacts (including genuine weaponry, tattoo kits and replica shrunken heads), displays of bones, feathers, eggs and fossils, along with an alligator skin which visitors are able to touch.|$|E

40|$|The present paper explores {{amino acid}} {{composition}} of breast and thigh muscles of common pheasant and compares it {{with that in}} broiler chickens. The experimental feeding of both <b>pheasant</b> and broiler <b>chickens</b> proceeded {{for a period of}} 42 days at the identical conditions employing the same diet and rearing technology. Muscles were analysed for the content of following amino acids: Asp, Thr, Ser, Glu, Pro, Gly, Ala, Val, Met, Ile, Leu, Tyr, Phe, His, Lys, and Arg. The results show that the levels of most amino acids in thigh and breast muscles of pheasants (related to dry matter content) were significantly higher (P ≤ 0. 01) than those in broiler chickens. In 42 -day-old birds, the levels of individual amino acids in breast muscles (related to 100 % of dry matter content) ranged from 8. 02 to 127. 32 g. kg - 1 in <b>pheasant</b> <b>chickens</b> and from 19. 77 to 110. 33 g. kg - 1 in broiler chickens while the corresponding average values in thigh muscles ranged from 14. 77 g. kg - 1 to 132. 77 g. kg - 1 in <b>pheasant</b> <b>chickens</b> and from 14. 02 g. kg - 1 to 93. 53 g. kg - 1 in broiler chickens. One interesting finding is {{that in the case of}} broiler chickens the levels of most amino acids in breast muscles were significantly higher (P ≤ 0. 01) than those in thigh muscles. In the case of <b>pheasant</b> <b>chickens,</b> the difference between breast and thigh muscles was not confirmed which indicates that both muscles have high nutritive value. The results of amino acid composition of pheasant and broiler meat have proven a high nutritive value of pheasant meat in respect to human nutrition...|$|R

There are numerous pictures, often commissioned by the artist, in which Turkish Angora cats, painted in many shades, are depicted in naturalistic terms. For this reason he was also called [...] "Cat-Heyer". In addition, there are numerous pictures of other animals, such as deer, hares, <b>pheasants,</b> <b>chickens,</b> deer and dogs (mainly his dog Mucki).

25|$|After 7 days of loading, the {{crankshaft}} of {{the compressor}} broke, damaging the machine's casing and causing {{the loss of}} the 643 sheep stowed. It took a month for a local machinist to rebuild the crankshaft and associated machinery. The frozen carcasses were resold locally during this time, and, encouragingly, they were considered to be indistinguishable from fresh meat. On 15 February 1882, the Dunedin sailed with 4331 mutton, 598 lamb and 22 pig carcasses, 250 kegs of butter, hare, <b>pheasant,</b> turkey, <b>chicken</b> and 2226 sheep tongues.

40|$|Reticuloendotheliosis virus 60 S RNA {{labeled with}} 125 I, or reticuloendotheliosis virus {{complementary}} DNA labeled with 3 H, were hybridized to DNAs from infected <b>chicken</b> and <b>pheasant</b> cells. Most of the sequences of the viral RNA {{were found in}} the infected cell DNAs. The reticuloendotheliosis viruses, therefore, replicate through a DNA intermediate. The same labeled nucleic acids were hybridized to DNA of uninfected <b>chicken,</b> <b>pheasant,</b> quail, turkey, and duck. About 10 % of the sequences of reticuloendotheliosis virus RNA were present in the DNA of uninfected <b>chicken,</b> <b>pheasant,</b> quail, and turkey. None were detected in DNA of duck. The specificity of the hybridization was shown by competition between unlabeled and 125 I-labeled viral RNAs and by determination of melting temperatures. In contrast, 125 I-labeled RNA of Rous-associated virus-O, an avian leukosis-sarcoma virus, hybridized 55 % to DNA of uninfected chicken, 20 % to DNA of uninfected pheasant, 15 % to DNA of uninfected quail, 10 % to DNA of uninfected turkey, and less than 1 % to DNA of uninfected duck...|$|R
5000|$|The Phasianidae [...] are {{a family}} of heavy, groundliving birds which {{includes}} <b>pheasants,</b> partridges, junglefowl, <b>chickens,</b> Old World quail, and peafowl.

50|$|A comb is a fleshy {{growth or}} crest {{on the top}} of the head of gallinaceous birds, such as turkeys, <b>pheasants,</b> and {{domestic}} <b>chickens.</b> Its alternative name cockscomb (with several spelling variations) reflects that combs are generally larger on males than on females (a male gallinaceous bird is called a cock). There can be several fleshy protuberances on the heads and throats of gallinaceous birds, i.e. comb, wattle, ear lobes and nodules, which collectively are called caruncles, however, in turkeys caruncle refers specifically to the fleshy nodules on the head and throat.|$|R
5000|$|Bonasa umbellus {{was first}} {{described}} by Linnaeus who classified it as Tetrao umbellus, {{placing it in}} a subfamily with Eurasian grouse. The subfamily Bonasa was applied by British naturalist John Francis Stephens in 1819. [...] Ruffed grouse is the preferred common name because it applies only to this species. Misleading vernacular names abound, however, and it is often called partridge (sometimes rendered pa'tridge, or shortened to pat), <b>pheasant,</b> or prairie <b>chicken,</b> {{all of which are}} properly applied to other birds. Other nicknames for ruffed grouse include drummer or thunder-chicken.|$|R
50|$|Although {{the origin}} of the dish was based on vegetables, meat and fish were added in later years. Up to 25 {{ingredients}} may be used in making the dish, such as beef, pork, <b>chicken,</b> <b>pheasant,</b> fish, abalone, sea cucumbers, and various vegetables. Boiled beef and sliced mu are placed in the dish with seasoned beef and the seafood. Mushrooms, carrots and other vegetables are placed next, with meatballs, walnuts, pine nuts, ginkgo nuts, and finely shredded red pepper used as garnish to create a colorful balance. Soup stock is poured over and then the dish is cooked with charcoal in the burner.|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT Sera from <b>chicken,</b> turkey, <b>pheasant,</b> quail {{and their}} {{intergeneric}} hybrids were compared by their reactions in two-dimensional immunoelectrophoresis with homologous and heterologous antisera. As many as 44 antigenically distinguishable components were resolved in these sera {{by use of}} this technique. Sera from the intergeneric hybrids, when allowed to react with rabbit anti-White Leghorn antiserum, gave more precipitin peaks than did any of the parental sera in reaction with this same antiserum. Thus it appeared that intergeneric hybridization induced a propagation of avian serum antigens recognized by rabbit antiserum to a single parental serum. For example, all parental sera, in reaction with homologous or heterologous antisera, appeared to contain only one precipitin peak which migrated in the albumin area. Sera from the intergeneric hybrids of chicken X turkey, <b>chicken</b> X <b>pheasant,</b> and <b>chicken</b> X quail had two antigenically distinguishable peaks in the albumin area. Sera from turkey X pheasant and pheasant X quail had only one peak in this region. These results agree with the observations obtained from polyacrylamide disc gel electrophoresis of the plasma proteins...|$|R
5000|$|Brown {{was born}} and raised on a farm without running water or {{electricity}} in Bridgeton, New Jersey near the Delaware River. He learned to read early and was a voracious reader. He was fascinated by World War II and would borrow day-old papers from the next door farm to follow it. He especially enjoyed reading biographies including those of America’s founding fathers and others such as Abraham Lincoln, George Washington Carver, and Marie Curie. From his earliest years, he worked on the farm, milking cows, pulling weeds, and cleaning the stable. An enterprising youth, he involved his younger brother, Carl, in various businesses, such as growing <b>pheasants</b> and <b>chickens</b> for sale. In 1951, they started a tomato growing business, which eventually grew to become one of New Jersey's largest, with sales of over 1520000 lb a year. He later said, [...] "farming is all I ever wanted to do with all my life. You have to know soils, weather, plant pathology, entomology, management, even politics.
