5|$|Lenny invites {{his friends}} in Springfield to a party at his apartment, where he tells them that he has adopted a new faith {{in the form of}} a brand new <b>plasma</b> <b>screen</b> television. Homer {{immediately}} falls in love with its high-definition picture, and begins to spend all his time at Lenny's home watching television. Marge sends over Bart and Lisa to convince him to come back but they too become enthralled. After a few days, Homer is kicked out by Lenny, and when he returns home he no longer enjoys watching his regular CRT television. Marge tells him that she has entered the family in a contest where first prize is a <b>plasma</b> <b>screen</b> television. Later, they get a call and discover that instead of first prize, they won the third prize: a trip to the studios of Fox Broadcasting Company. There, Homer learns of a reality show called Mother Flippers in which the mothers of two families switch places, and the grand prize happens to be enough money to buy a new <b>plasma</b> <b>screen</b> television.|$|E
5|$|In 2006, Anuncio Digital Media, {{a locally}} started digital {{advertising}} firm, installed its first mall-based digital signage network, {{which consists of}} a series of twenty <b>plasma</b> <b>screen</b> televisions around the main concourse and in the food court that display six-second sound-free advertisements. Post Oak Mall was the first of four CBL-owned malls to receive this network, with four other CBL malls scheduled to follow. The advertising displays were activated on September 1, 2006.|$|E
5|$|The iLoo (short for Internet loo) was a {{cancelled}} Microsoft {{project to}} develop a Wi-Fi Internet-enabled portable toilet. The iLoo, which was to debut at British summer festivals, was described as being a portable toilet with wireless broadband Internet, an adjustable <b>plasma</b> <b>screen,</b> a membrane wireless keyboard, a six-channel speaker system, and toilet paper embossed with popular web site addresses. The iLoo was also to have an extra screen and keyboard on the outside, and was to be guarded. It was intended as the next {{in a series of}} successful initiatives by MSN UK which sought to introduce the internet in unusual locations, including MSN Street, MSN Park Bench and MSN Deckchair.|$|E

We find that for collisions between heavy nuclei such as Au+Au, both <b>plasma</b> <b>screening</b> and gluon scattering are important. As a result, the effect due to absorption by hadrons becomes relatively minor. The final J/psi survival probability in these collisions is only a few percent.

40|$|The {{effect of}} <b>plasma</b> <b>screening</b> on the {{electronic}} and vibrational {{properties of the}} H 2 + molecular ion was analyzed within the Born-Oppenheimer approximation. When a molecule is embedded in a <b>plasma,</b> the <b>plasma</b> <b>screens</b> the electrostatic interactions. This screening is accounted for in the Schr√∂dinger equation by replacing the Coulomb potentials with Yukawa potentials that incorporate the Debye length as a screening parameter. Variational expansions in confocal elliptical coordinates were used to calculate energies of the 1 ssg and the 2 psu states over a range of Debye lengths and bond distances. When the Debye length {{is comparable to the}} equilibrium bond distance, the <b>plasma</b> <b>screening</b> reshapes the potential energy curve. Expectation values, dipole polarizabilities and spectroscopic constants were calculated for the 1 ssg state...|$|R

While the company enjoyed some success in gaining substantial market share from traditional leaders in the space, particularly with plasma TVs and digital cameras, the limited short-term profit potential of those product lines led then-CEO Wayne Inouye to pull the company out of that segment during 2004. Gateway still acts as a retailer selling third-party electronic goods online.|$|E

40|$|We analyze {{enhancement}} of thermonuclear fusion reactions due to strong <b>plasma</b> <b>screening</b> in dense matter using a simple electron drop model. The model assumes fusion in a potential that is screened by an effective electron cloud around colliding nuclei (extended Salpeter ion-sphere model). We calculate the mean field screened Coulomb potentials for atomic nuclei with equal and nonequal charges, appropriate astrophysical S factors, and enhancement factors of reaction rates. As a byproduct, we study analytic {{behavior of the}} screening potential at small separations between the reactants. In this model, astrophysical S factors depend not only on nuclear physics but on <b>plasma</b> <b>screening</b> as well. The enhancement factors are in good agreement with calculations by other methods. This allows us to formulate the combined, pure analytic model of strong <b>plasma</b> <b>screening</b> in thermonuclear reactions. The results can be useful for simulating nuclear burning in white dwarfs and neutron stars. Comment: 15 pages, 8 figure...|$|R

40|$|Using {{the results}} of {{extensive}} Monte Carlo simulations we discuss corrections to the linear mixing rule in strongly coupled binary ionic mixtures. We analyze the <b>plasma</b> <b>screening</b> function at zero separation, H_{jk}(0), for two ions (of types j= 1, 2 and k= 1, 2) in a strongly coupled binary mixture. The function H_{jk}(0) is estimated by two methods: (1) from the difference of Helmholtz Coulomb free energies at large and zero separations; (2) by fitting the Widom expansion of H_{jk}(x) in powers of interionic distance x to Monte Carlo data on the radial pair distribution function g_{jk}(x). These methods are shown {{to be in good}} agreement. For illustration, we analyze the <b>plasma</b> <b>screening</b> enhancement of nuclear burning rates in dense stellar matter.
