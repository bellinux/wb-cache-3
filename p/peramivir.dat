25|$|The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) inclusively {{recommends}} {{those six}} months and older to get a yearly vaccination to protect from influenza A viruses (H1N1) and (H3N2) and up to two influenza B viruses (depending on the vaccination). Comprehensive protection starts by ensuring vaccinations are current and complete. The three FDA-approved neuraminidase antiviral flu drugs available in the United States, recommended by the CDC, include: oseltamivir (Tamiflu®), zanamivir (Relenza®), and <b>peramivir</b> (Rapivab®).|$|E
25|$|However, {{when the}} antigenicities of the seed strains and wild viruses do not match, {{vaccines}} fail {{to protect the}} vaccinees. In addition, {{even when they do}} match, escape mutants are often generated. Drugs available for the treatment of influenza include Amantadine and Rimantadine, which inhibit the uncoating of virions by interfering with M2, and Oseltamivir (marketed under the brand name Tamiflu), Zanamivir, and <b>Peramivir,</b> which inhibit the release of virions from infected cells by interfering with NA. However, escape mutants are often generated for the former drug and less frequently for the latter drug.|$|E
50|$|<b>Peramivir</b> has a guanidino group {{similar to}} {{zanamivir}} and a hydrophobic group similar to oseltamivir. Mutations that effect {{the efficiency of}} oseltamivir and zanamivir can also effect <b>peramivir</b> efficiency. Resistances to <b>peramivir</b> have been seen at the mutation of H274Y residue in vitro. One of these resistances is associated with cross-resistance to <b>peramivir</b> and oseltamivir. <b>Peramivir</b> is approved in Japan as Rapiacta and also available in South Korea as Peramiflu.|$|E
50|$|<b>Peramivir</b> is {{approved}} {{for the treatment}} of influenza under the tradenames Rapiacta® in Japan and Peramiflu in South Korea. In the USA and elsewhere, <b>peramivir</b> is undergoing the late-phase clinical trial. <b>Peramivir</b> is used as intravenous and was used in the emergency treatment of 2009 H1N1 in select patients.|$|E
50|$|<b>Peramivir</b> is a {{pharmaceutical}} drug {{used to treat}} viral infections. Like zanamivir and oseltamivir, <b>peramivir</b> is a neuraminidase inhibitor, acting as a transition-state analogue inhibitor of influenza neuraminidase and thereby preventing new viruses from emerging from infected cells. Experimental data indicate that <b>peramivir</b> may have useful activity against many viruses of interest, including H5N1 (avian bird flu), hepatitis B, polio, measles and smallpox. HHS Secretary Mike Leavitt announced on January 4, 2007 that the Department has awarded a $102.6 million, four-year contract to BioCryst Pharmaceuticals for advanced development of their influenza antiviral drug, <b>peramivir.</b>|$|E
50|$|In October 2009, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) {{issued an}} {{emergency}} use authorization (EUA) {{for the use}} of <b>peramivir</b> based on safety data from phase I, phase II, and limited phase III trial data. The emergency use authorization for <b>peramivir</b> expired in June 2010. On 19 December 2014, the FDA approved <b>peramivir</b> to treat influenza infection in adults.|$|E
50|$|BioCryst Pharmaceuticals {{submitted}} {{a new drug}} application (NDA) to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for intravenous <b>peramivir</b> in December 2013. <b>Peramivir</b> (Rapivab) was approved for intravenous administration in Dec 2014.|$|E
50|$|In October 2009, it was {{reported}} that the experimental antiviral drug <b>Peramivir</b> had been effective in treating serious cases of swine flu. On October 23, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) issued an Emergency Use Authorization for <b>Peramivir</b> (now expired), leading to wider and faster availability for patients. Since the FDA's decisions and actions are closely watched around the world, this move is likely to also increase demand for <b>Peramivir</b> internationally.|$|E
50|$|According to a {{research}} report published in June 2011, a new variant of swine flu had emerged in Asia with a genetic adaptation (a S247N neuraminidase mutation) giving some resistance to oseltamivir and zanamivir, but no {{significant reduction in}} sensitivity to <b>peramivir.</b> But a H274Y virus mutation showed resistance to oseltamivir and <b>peramivir,</b> but not to zanamivir, and only in N1 neuraminidases. Ultimately 3.2% (19/599) of A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses collected between 2009 and 2012 had highly reduced <b>peramivir</b> inhibition due to the H275Y NA mutation.|$|E
50|$|<b>Peramivir</b> (trade name Rapivab) is an {{antiviral}} drug developed by BioCryst Pharmaceuticals {{for the treatment of}} influenza. <b>Peramivir</b> is a neuraminidase inhibitor, acting as a transition-state analogue inhibitor of influenza neuraminidase and thereby preventing new viruses from emerging from infected cells. It is approved for intravenous administration.|$|E
50|$|In 2012 BioCryst {{reported}} that it should halt enrollment on its study for intravenous <b>peramivir</b> in potentially life-threatened people after an interim analysis led trial monitors to conclude {{that it would be}} futile to continue and the trial should be terminated. The difference between <b>peramivir</b> and control group (oral oseltamivir) for the primary endpoint, clinical or virologic, was small. In 2013 the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA/HHS) released new funding under the current $234.8 million contract to enable completion of a New Drug Application filing for intravenous (IV) <b>peramivir.</b>|$|E
5000|$|...Only Zanamivir and Oseltamivir are FDA approved. <b>Peramivir</b> {{is used in}} Japan and South Korea. Laninamivir is used in Japan only.|$|E
5000|$|In October 2009, it was {{reported}} that the experimental antiviral drug <b>peramivir</b> had been [...] "life-saving" [...] effective in intravenous treating 8 serious cases of swine flu. On October 23, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) issued an Emergency Use Authorization for <b>peramivir,</b> allowing the use of the drug in intravenous form for hospitalized patients only in cases where the other available methods of treatment are ineffective or unavailable; for instance, if oseltamivir resistance develops and a person is unable to take zanamivir via the inhaled route. The U.S. government (department of Health and Human Services) gave BioCryst Pharmaceuticals more than $77 million to finish the Phase III clinical development of <b>peramivir.</b> In 2009 the department of Health and Human Services had already given about $180 million to the program. Biocryst also donated 1200 courses of treatment to the US department of Health and Human Services. The Emergency Use Authorization expired on June 23, 2010.In 2011 a phase III trial found the median durations of influenza symptoms were the same with 1 intravenous injection of <b>peramivir</b> against 5 days of oral oseltamivir for people with seasonal influenza virus infection.|$|E
50|$|New NA {{inhibitor}} analogues were synthesized, {{based on}} Zanamivir, Oseltamivir and <b>Peramivir,</b> with rational structure-based drug design {{and can be}} categorized into four groups.|$|E

50|$|Neuraminidase inhibitors (NAIs) are a {{class of}} drugs which block the {{neuraminidase}} enzyme. They are commonly used as antiviral drugs because they block the function of viral neuraminidases of the influenza virus, by preventing its reproduction by budding from the host cell. Oseltamivir (Tamiflu) a prodrug, Zanamivir (Relenza), Laninamivir (Inavir), and <b>Peramivir</b> belong to this class. Unlike the M2 inhibitors, which work only against the influenza A, neuraminidase inhibitors act against both influenza A and influenza B. The neuraminidase inhibitors oseltamivir and zanamivir were approved in the US and Europe for treatment and prevention of influenza A and B. <b>Peramivir</b> acts by strongly binding to the neuraminidase of the influenza viruses and inhibits activation of neuraminidase much longer than Oseltamivir or Zanamivir. However, Laninamivir in the cells is slowly released into the respiratory tract, resulting in long-lasting anti-influenza virus activity. Thus the mechanism of the long-lasting activity of laninamivir is basically {{different from that of}} <b>Peramivir.</b>|$|E
50|$|Neuraminidase inhibitors {{are useful}} for combating {{influenza}} infection: zanamivir, administered by inhalation; oseltamivir, administered orally; <b>peramivir</b> administered parenterally, that is through intravenous or intramuscular injection; and laninamivir which is in phase III clinical trials.|$|E
50|$|<b>Peramivir</b> {{has also}} been {{approved}} in Japan and South Korea and is available in Japan as Rapiacta and in South Korea as Peramiflu. As of 2015, {{it is the only}} intravenous option for treating swine flu.|$|E
50|$|An {{intramuscular}} (IM) <b>peramivir</b> phase II {{study for}} seasonal influenza in 2008-2009 found no {{effect for the}} primary endpoint of improvement in the median time to alleviation of symptoms in subjects with confirmed, acute, uncomplicated influenza infection versus placebo.|$|E
50|$|There are 2 {{subgroups of}} NA inhibitors {{that have been}} {{approved}} by regulatory authorities in the US and Europe, Zanamivir and Oseltamivir. Both are for the treatment and prevention of influenza. Furthermore, <b>Peramivir</b> and Laninamivir have been approved by regulatory authorities {{in some parts of}} Asia.|$|E
50|$|<b>Peramivir,</b> an {{experimental}} anti-influenza drug, developed by BioCryst Pharmaceuticals {{has not yet}} been approved for sale in the United States. This drug can be given as an injection, so may be particularly useful in serious cases of influenza where the patient is unconscious and oral or inhaled drug administration is therefore difficult.|$|E
50|$|<b>Peramivir</b> is the {{cyclopentane}} derivative {{designed with}} a guanidino group replacing the C-4 hydroxyl group of Neu5Ac2en {{in the active}} site, with negatively charged carboxylate group and a n-butyl side chain. 1-ethylpropylamide, diethylamide, dipropylamide and 4-morpholinylamide groups all showed excellent inhibitory activity. Changing the cyclopentane ring to a pyrrolidine ring showed high inhibitory activity as well.|$|E

5000|$|A {{perspective}} piece {{published in}} The New England Journal of Medicine in 2009 {{noted that the}} FDA issued Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) to use an unapproved drug {{in case of an}} emergency, but also noted that this could only issued only after the {{secretary of health and human}} services has declared a public health emergency. [...] "In the case of the 2009 H1N1 influenza pandemic, such a declaration was made on April 26, 2009. An EUA for a medical product has a term of 1 year, but it can be renewed, depending on the circumstances of the emergency. It is important that product development continue to focus on the goal of approval (there are ongoing clinical trials evaluating the efficacy of intravenous <b>peramivir</b> in treating influenza), because the EUA is only a temporary means for making a product available during an emergency." ...|$|E
5000|$|<b>Peramivir</b> is {{developed}} by structure-based drug design. After the influenza NA inhibitor activity of α/β-6-acetyl-amino-3,6-dideoxy -D-glycero-altro-2-nonulofuranosonic acid {{was reported by}} Yamamoto et al., the cyclopentane derivatives was designed with a guanidino group replacing C4-hydroxyl position of DANA in the active site, similar to Zanamivir. Babu et al. found that the addition of n-butyl side chain makes the compound fit better to the hydrophobic region of the enzyme. However, the conformation of the n-butyl group {{was found to be}} different when bound to influenza virus A from its conformation when bound to influenza virus B. [...] Since the compound processed similar binding interaction with active site of NA to zanamivir and due to the mutation in some zanamivir-resistance strains, the position of guanidino group was altered and the n-butyl group was replaced in order to change its active site interaction.|$|E
50|$|Vaccines {{and drugs}} are {{available}} for the prophylaxis and treatment of influenza virus infections. Vaccines are composed of either inactivated or live attenuated virions of the H1N1 and H3N2 human influenza A viruses, {{as well as those}} of influenza B viruses. Because the antigenicities of the wild viruses evolve, vaccines are reformulated annually by updating the seed strains.However, when the antigenicities of the seed strains and wild viruses do not match, vaccines fail to protect the vaccinees. In addition, even when they do match, escape mutants are often generated. Drugs available for the treatment of influenza include Amantadine and Rimantadine, which inhibit the uncoating of virions by interfering with M2, and Oseltamivir (marketed under the brand name Tamiflu), Zanamivir, and <b>Peramivir,</b> which inhibit the release of virions from infected cells by interfering with NA. However, escape mutants are often generated for the former drug and less frequently for the latter drug.|$|E
5000|$|Neuraminidase inhibitors {{may be used}} {{to treat}} viral {{pneumonia}} caused by influenza viruses (influenza A and influenza B). No specific antiviral medications are recommended for other types of community acquired viral pneumonias including SARS coronavirus, adenovirus, hantavirus, and parainfluenza virus. Influenza A may be treated with rimantadine or amantadine, while influenza A or B may be treated with oseltamivir, zanamivir or <b>peramivir.</b> These are of most benefit if they are started within 48 hours of the onset of symptoms. Many strains of H5N1 influenza A, also known as avian influenza or [...] "bird flu", have shown resistance to rimantadine and amantadine. The use of antibiotics in viral pneumonia is recommended by some experts, as it is impossible to rule out a complicating bacterial infection. The British Thoracic Society recommends that antibiotics be withheld in those with mild disease. The use of corticosteroids is controversial.|$|E
50|$|People in at-risk {{groups should}} be treated with antivirals (oseltamivir or zanamivir) as soon as {{possible}} when they first experience flu symptoms. The at-risk groups include pregnant and post partum women, children under two years old, and people with underlying conditions such as respiratory problems. People who are not in an at-risk group who have persistent or rapidly worsening symptoms should also be treated with antivirals. People who have developed pneumonia should be given both antivirals and antibiotics, as in many severe cases of H1N1-caused illness, bacterial infection develops. Antivirals are most useful if given within 48 hours of the start of symptoms and may improve outcomes in hospitalised patients. In those beyond 48 hours who are moderately or severely ill, antivirals may still be beneficial. If oseltamivir (Tamiflu) is unavailable or cannot be used, zanamivir (Relenza) is recommended as a substitute. <b>Peramivir</b> is an experimental antiviral drug approved for hospitalised patients in cases where the other available methods of treatment are ineffective or unavailable.|$|E
40|$|<b>Peramivir,</b> a sialic acid analogue, is a {{selective}} inhibitor of neuraminidases produced by influenza A and B viruses. We evaluated the efficacy {{and safety of}} a single intravenous dose of <b>peramivir</b> in outpatients with uncomplicated seasonal influenza virus infection. A total of 300 previously healthy adult subjects aged 20 to 64 years with a positive influenza virus rapid antigen test were recruited within 48 h of the onset of influenza symptoms and randomized to three groups: single intravenous infusion of either 300 mg <b>peramivir</b> per kg of body weight, 600 mg <b>peramivir,</b> or matching placebo on study day 1. Influenza symptoms and body temperature were self-assessed for 14 days. Nasal and pharyngeal swabs were collected to determine the viral titer.

40|$|Oral {{antiviral}} {{agents to}} treat influenza are challenging to administer {{in the intensive}} care unit (ICU). We describe 57 critically ill patients treated with the investigational intravenous neuraminidase inhibitor drug <b>peramivir</b> for influenza A (H 1 N 1) pdm 09 [pH 1 N 1]. Most received late <b>peramivir</b> treatment following clinical deterioration in the ICU on enterically-administered oseltamivir therapy. The median age was 40 years (range 5 months- 81 years). Common clinical complications included pneumonia or acute respiratory distress syndrome requiring mechanical ventilation (54; 95 %), sepsis requiring vasopressor support (34 / 53; 64 %), acute renal failure requiring hemodialysis (19 / 53; 36 %) and secondary bacterial infection (14; 25 %). Over half (29; 51 %) died. When comparing the 57 peramivir-treated cases with 1627 critically ill cases who did not receive <b>peramivir,</b> <b>peramivir</b> recipients were more likely to be diagnosed with pneumonia/acute respiratory distress syndrome (p = 0. 0002) or sepsis (p =, 0. 0001), require mechanical ventilation (p =, 0. 0001) or die (p =, 0. 0001). The high mortality could be due to the pre-existing clinical severity of cases prior to request for <b>peramivir,</b> but also raises questions about <b>peramivir</b> safety and effectiveness in hospitalized and critically ill patients.
