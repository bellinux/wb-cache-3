40|$|ABSTRACT. Uvarovite and grossular, {{the former}} com-paratively rare, occur along the serpentinite-graphite schist contact in the Fengtien area, {{on the eastern}} slope of the Central Range of Taiwan. Uvarovite occurs as small emerald-green {{euhedral}} crystals on diopside-fels with dodecahedral crystal forms and many other modifica-tions. Its refractive index is 1. 782, specific gravity 3. 702, and unit cell edge 11. 912 A. Chemical and probe analyses give average Cr 20 3 contents of 11. 60 wt. ~; spectro-graphic analysis shows significant enrichment in Cr, Be, Co, Y, Sb, and La over grossular. Associated minerals include nephrite, diopside, tremolite asbestos, zoisite, and clinozoisite. Grossular is reddish-brown; large crystals, dodecahedral in form often modified by trapezohedrons, are associated with diopside, idocrase, and calcite, n = 1. 746, SG = 3. 636, and a = 11. 866 A. Structurally and chemically it is quite near the grossular end member. Grossular {{is considered to be}} formed from <b>pneumatolysis</b> associated with the intrusion of ultramafic rocks, whereas uvarovite is a replacement product of relict chromite in the original ultramafic rocks where migration of elements such as silicon and calcium from wall rocks are prominent. UVAROVITE {{is a member of the}} ugrandite series and is the rarest of the six end members of the garnet family. The pure uvarovite nd member has not been recorded in natural minerals; in fact the natural garnet that has been called 'uvarovite' always contain a considerable amount of the grossular and andradite molecule. Garnets with uvarovite as the dominant molecule are of restricted occurrence and are found chiefly in serpentinite, often in association with chromite (Chakraborty, 1968), and in metamorphosed limestones and skarn ore-bodies (Deer et al., 1963). The best-known occurrences are those in Outokumpu, nort...|$|E
40|$|Quartz and felspar porphyries and {{associated}} greenschists of the West Coast Range are described. Felspar porphyries {{are considered to}} have originated by the felspathising of spilitic lavas, lava breccias and related greywackes {{during a period of}} progressive metamorphism. Metamorphic mineral assemblages of the greenschist and albiteepidote- amphibolite facies are recognized in the porphyries and are identified with increasing degrees of porphyritising of host rocks. Sharp contacts between chlorite-sericite schists and quartzites are regarded as metamorphic in origin and as indicating the replacing action of a chloritising and sericitising front. Haematite rich rocks and low grade pyritic ores which respectively occupy narrow zones above and below the schist quartzite contact are regarded as representing minor haematlsing and pyritising fronts. Sulphide and silicate metasomatism are closely related to the structure of the range and it appears that the advance of fronts has been engendered and controlled by the upward fiow of heated waters through fault fissures and pore spaces. Metasomatic replacement was effected by diffusion and exchange through intergranular films. This mechanism is thermodynamically efficient and allows adequate explanations of growth, and also of corrosion structures, of quartz and felspar crystals in the porphyries. During the advance of fronts there was extensive transport of material; metamorphism was not merely an adjustment to changed isogradial conditions. In particular, migrating solutions leached iron, copper and suiphur from the basic rocks and precipitated them in specific zones where they now form low grade ores. After a period of rising temperatures and progressive metamorphism there followed an interval of cooling and retreat of thermal zones. Because of the presence of abundant water there was during this cooling phase an intense retrograde metamorphism of the recently formed felspathic rocks. Hydration of these rocks resulted in the liberation of silica and thus gave rise to quartz porphyries and quartz sericite schists. Extreme <b>pneumatolysis</b> and leaching of silica from the porphyries gave rise to kaoJinised rocks and to veins of quartz and chert. A similar kind of leaching of sulphides from the low grade ores, and of selective precipitation of sulphides in pipes and veins, gave rise to rich ore bodies...|$|E
40|$|At {{the present}} time, it is {{generally}} accepted that tin veins can be deposited from pneumatolytic as well as hydrothermal solutions, although those of pneumatolytic origin, containing characteristic pneumatolytic minerals such as fluorite, topaz, tourmaline, apatite and other fluorine and boron-bearing minerals, and accompanied by typical pneumatolytic alterations of the country rock, are of commoner occurrence. That the veins under consideration were not formed under pure pneumatolytic conditions is indicated {{by the absence of}} characteristic pneumatolytic alterations of the wall-rocks. The slaty rocks in which the veins are enclosed are often intensely chloritized, silicified, epidotized and sideritized, while no characteristic pneumatolytic minerals have been observed in them even under the microscope. These alterations are regarded to be characteristic of hydrothermal processes. Moreover, the veins themselves contain usually more or less siderite and chlorite, as can easily be revealed under the microscope. These minerals occur, through rather sparingly, in ordinary cassiterite veins, and are most abundantly associated with hydrothermal tin veins, siderite, particularly, being of deposition, in most tin veins, in the last stage of <b>pneumatolysis,</b> or in pneumato-hydatogenetic or hydrothermal stages. The occurrence of chalcedony, evidently transformed from an opaline silica, as an important gangue-mineral is most instructive. This mineral is an extremely rare associate of ten-stone. Only a few examples of tin veins containing chalcedony have hitherto been reported, and they all belong to the category formed under hydrothermal or allied conditions. As already fully discussed under the heading of "the deposition of the main cassiterite ore," the presence of chalcedony in the veins under consideration indicates that they were formed under hydrothermal conditions at a temperature below 360 ℃. On the other hand, {{it must be noted that}} some minerals regarded as common associates of pneumatolytic deposits, such as fluorspar, wolframite and bismuth ores with sporadic microscopic topaz, are present in the veins. There minerals are, of course, of very common occurrence in the deposits formed at high temperatures, but may be deposited either from gaseous solutions or from superheated aqueous solutions containing soluble or gaseous compounds of fluorine, tungsten and bismuth. Typical hydrothermal veins containing scheelite, wolframite, fluorspar, bismuth ores, etc. are numerous even in this country. The veins of this district are unique in the fact that the orebringer for them is a dioritic magma. Considering, however, that acid rocks can be derived from a basic magma by processes of differentiation chiefly due to fractional crystallization and setting or by the expulsion of the residual fluid magma, and that an acid differentiation-product with a composition or quartz-monzonite-pegmatite or aplite, akenobeite, is actually found as a small boss in this district, the genetic connection of the veins with the dioritic rocks is highly probable. Summarizing all that has been stated, the copper tin veins of the Akenobe district were deposited from hydrothermal solutions, still containing fair quantities of mineralizers, at gradually decreasing temperatures, chiefly considerably below 360 ℃. The solutions had naturally a temperature far above the critical point of water (364 ℃) and were gaseous in character, after emanation from the consolidating diorite magma. As they ascended through the surrounding slate complex, the rate of the fall of temperature was very rapid, and they soon changed to superheated hydrothermal solutions. Lastly, the writer frankly states that he is quite in the dark as to whether the stannic oxide first separated from the solutions in the colloid state and subsequently became crystalline, or whether it crystallized directly as cassiterite by chemical reactions between stannic fluoride and other compounds...|$|E
40|$|Rarotonga is the {{emergent}} summit of a Plio-Pliestocene volcanic complex built by effusive and pyroclastic eruptions of mainly mafic magma. Petrographically the mafic rock types are ankaramite and basalt. Phenocryst assemblages {{provide the basis}} for recognizing two types of ankaramites and basalt, one with a relatively simple equilibrium assemblage of olivine, titanaugite and magnetite (type I), and one with olivine, diopside-augite and titanaugite in which phenocrysts show dis-equilibrium textures (type II) The final stages of volcanism on Rarotonga witnessed the pyroclastic eruption of phonolites and the effusive eruption of foidal phonolites. [...] Chemically the two mafic types are divided on silica content with, the type I rocks generally have lower silica content than the type n rocks. The remaining elements (both major and trace) having similar concentrations in both types. Although some of the mafic rocks have primitive compositions they probably do not represent primary compositions due to the presence of accumulated minerals. Both type J and type II rocks are enriched in incompatible trace elements compared to primitive mantle. On Bowen diagrams the foidal phonolites and phonolites plot as extensions of the trends defined by the mafic rocks. There is, however, a compositional gap between the mafic rocks and the felsic rocks. [...] Distribution coefficients determined on mafic rocks from Rarotonga show high concentrations of most of the incompatible trace elements (e. g., Sr, Th, Y, REE etc.) in the pyroxenes relative to the other phases suggesting that fractionation of pyroxenes dominated trace element distributions during crystal fractionation. In such cases, the highly incompatible elements (Kd < 0. 001) are the LFSE Ba and Cs, and the HFSE. Elements that could also be classified as strongly incompatible are Nb and Ta (Kd < 0. 1). The remaining trace elements have Kd values that range from ~ 0. 1 (La) up to ~ 0. 8 (Yb). Magnetite incorporates higher amounts of Nb and Ta compared to the titanaugites, and any significant fractionation of magnetite will effect the bulk distribution of Nb and Ta. The LREE have lower Kd values than MREE and HREE with the HREE having Kd values close to unity. Consequently, the separation of titanaugite produces an overall enrichment of REE in the residual liquid with an increase in the La/Yb ratio. [...] Most of the bulk compositional variation observed in the Rarotonga lavas is due to crystal fractionation processes. Rayleigh fractional crystallization is preferred to equilibrium crystallization on account of the abundance of zoned phenocrysts in many of the Rarotonga rocks. Olivine and clinopyroxene were the two phases controlling crystal fractionation of the mafic rocks. In the type II magmas, the first clinopyroxenes to crystallize had diopside-augite compositions while later clinopyroxenes had titanaugite compositions. As the magma fractionated towards more intermediate compositions kaersutite began to crystallize. Due to slight differences in silica saturation the type I magmas fractionated toward a foidal phonolite end-member forming a low silica suite. The type II magmas fractionated towards phonolite forming a high silica suite. [...] Viscosity increased during fractionation of the magma chambers inhibiting eruption of the intermediate compositions. A late stage fluid (probably formed during <b>pneumatolysis)</b> was concentrated in the fractionating magma chambers (Na₂O, Th and Y, etc.). This fluid along with continued increase of alkalis decreased the overall viscosity of the magma to a point where eruptions could start again. The phonolite magmas, which only formed pyroclastic eruptions, were slightly more viscous than the foidal phonolites which erupted as flows. [...] Whereas much of the compositional variability observed amongst Rarotonga lavas can be attributed to fractional crystallization, important differences in incompatible element ratios and bulk composition of primitive Rarotonga lavas must have been inherited from processes occurring in their mantle source regions. Quantitative modeling shows that the primary magmas which produced the lavas on Rarotonga were produced by low degrees of partial melting (< 5 %) of a (garnet-free) spinel lherzolite source. The mantle source also contained either an amphibole or a mica phase and was enriched relative to primitive mantle in the highly incompatible elements. The type I magmas were probably produced slightly deeper in the mantle than the type II magmas...|$|E
