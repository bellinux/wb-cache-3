50|$|To {{increase}} {{the efficiency of}} the Rhine bridge, the city of Konstanz decided in co-operation with the highway department of the day, and the Deutsche Reichsbahn, to fundamentally rebuild the bridge. The spans were unchanged, but the bridge was widened by about 50%. The Ed. Züblin company from Stuttgart was awarded the contract to build the substructure. Construction work began in November 1936. After a 190-meter-long temporary bridge was built downstream, the road bridge sections were taken apart, with the railway remaining in operation, albeit under restrictions. The superstructure of the old bridge, as well as the substructure, abutments and pillars were disassembled down to the water line. In the shelter of a sheet pile enclosed <b>pit,</b> <b>timber</b> piles with lengths of 18 to 20 m were driven into the river bottom, the abutments were extended downstream and the pillars were widened. New abutments were then built, using concrete with exposed brickwork from granite from Waldulm. The pillars were encased in concrete in the shelter of the sheet pile enclosed pit. The contract for the steel superstructure was awarded to the M.A.N. company from Mainz-Gustavsburg. The bridge sections were constructed in the factory in Mainz-Gustavsburg and transported by rail to the site where they were hoisted in place using a gantry crane and rivetted together. The new bridge was inaugurated on 9 October 1938.|$|E

50|$|In 1807 the Vestry {{decided that}} it was not {{hygienic}} for goods to be loaded or unloaded {{in the vicinity of the}} market and ordered all saw <b>pits,</b> <b>timber</b> and other encroachments around the Market Place to be removed. The market was struggling during this time and an attempt to revive it in 1821 was not very successful. A Butter Cross, also known as a market house, was erected in 1831. This building also housed the town fire engine and had an upstairs room that for a time housed the Clock House School and later the Town Surveyor's Office. This office was covered by a turret which housed the Town Clock (purchased by public subscription about 1750) and the Fire Bell. In later refurbishments this clock was re-housed in St Peter's Church Tower. The Town Stocks were also placed in the Market Place and local offenders (and those who refused to go to church) were placed in them.|$|R
50|$|Old {{coal mine}} working are eroding {{out of the}} sea-cliffs at Joggins. Recently {{dendrochronology}} had been employed to date the <b>timber</b> <b>pit</b> props. A late nineteenth century age has been inferred, with most props dating from the 1860s and 1870s.|$|R
50|$|Canterbury {{grew into}} the {{economic}} and political centre of Kent during the seventh century, as evidenced by rubbish <b>pits,</b> metalworking, <b>timber</b> halls, and sunken-feature buildings from the period. Intensive development was also present at Dover, and possibly at Rochester, although archaeological evidence is lacking. It is known that both Canterbury and Rochester were the home to major mints in this period, primarily producing silver sceattas. This suggests that from the seventh century onward, kings in Kent were establishing control over the kingdom's economic structure.|$|R
50|$|The coach house {{complex is}} {{established}} on a floor framing system consisting of hardwood stumps, rough sawn hardwood drop log bearers, pit sawn hardwood joists and floor boards. Exterior walls to both buildings are timber framed {{with the dominant}} wall construction for both structures being a system of vertically expressed hardwood posts housed into bed log bearers and extended up to meet a hardwood top plate. Smaller twin sections of timber are fixed to posts to create rebates running {{the length of the}} post. <b>Pit</b> sawn <b>timber</b> slabs are stacked horizontally into these rebates to create the wall membrane.|$|R
50|$|While most Maleny {{district}} {{houses of}} the late 19th and early 20th centuries were built of <b>pit</b> sawn local <b>timber,</b> few surviving houses of this type were identified in the 1995 Caloundra City Cultural Heritage Study. Included amongst these was Fairview, listed as Armstrong's House 56, identified for its historic, aesthetic, representative value and integrity. A 2001 review of over 350 places identified in the 1995 survey resulted in a much shorter list of locally significant places. While some farm houses were noted the new list did not include any houses constructed of <b>pit</b> sawn local <b>timber.</b> The only building constructed of local pit-sawn timber included in the listing was {{the first stage of}} the Maleny Hotel 26, erected in 1907. Fairview House (1907) {{was not included in the}} preliminary register as a place sufficiently well known or documented for its cultural heritage significance, but was included as a place worthy of further investigation.|$|R
50|$|In 1950 a {{train driver}} noticed a void beneath {{the tracks and}} it became {{apparent}} that work was required to stabilise the <b>pits.</b> The original <b>timbers</b> were removed and the pits spanned with prefabricated concrete beams reinforced with bullhead rail and shear links. One more beam was fabricated than was required for the work and this was stored in a nearby yard. Again it was not recorded whether the pits were filled.|$|R
50|$|The {{frame is}} of timber, and is {{basically}} that installed by Taylor's in 1885. A new foundation of RSJs was inserted beneath the frame in 1932, and two <b>timber</b> <b>pits,</b> which now contain the treble and 3rd, {{were added to}} the East side. A single cast iron lowsided pit for the flat 6th was added on the south side in 1976. The additions of 1932 and 1976 were both carried out by Taylor's.|$|R
50|$|By 1932 all {{underground}} haulage {{had been}} mechanised and most pit ponies {{taken out of}} the pit. Steel supports began to replace the traditional <b>timber</b> <b>pit</b> props. These originally were not universally accepted because miners complained that whereas timber supports creaked when they began to break, which acted as a warning, steel supports did not. Eventually, however, steel supports were accepted. There were also technological advances with coal cutters and conveyors which were becoming increasingly necessary as tonnage began to increase.|$|R
40|$|Nanosilica (Nano-SiO 2) sol {{fabricated}} by a {{sol-gel process}} was introduced into wood modification with phosphorus flame retardants {{to improve the}} flame retardancy and leaching resistance of wood. The obtained materials were characterized by scanning electron microscopy and energy dispersive spectrometer (SEM-EDS), thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), cone calorimetric (CONE), and infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR). The residual rate of flame retardants before and after leaching was determinated by a leaching resistance. The {{results showed that the}} phosphorus flame retardants and SiO 2 sol could reside in the poplar wood and are widely distributed in the vessels, <b>pits,</b> wood <b>timber,</b> and the spaces between wood cells of poplar substrate. TGA and CONE results indicated that the introduction of nano-SiO 2 aerogel with phosphorus flame retardants had a significantly synergistic effect on improving the flame retardancy and inhibiting the release of smoke and toxic gases. In addition, the leaching resistance test, combined with infrared analysis and EDS analysis, confirmed that the phosphorus flame retardants were able to be fixed by SiO 2 aerogel in the wood...|$|R
50|$|The {{central core}} of the cattle yards {{comprises}} crushes for de-horning, cutting, drafting, dipping, and branding. Surrounding the stock working facilities of the central core, are the receiving, forcing and holding yards. The de-horning and cutting crush, cattle dip and stock loading ramp are in better condition than most sections of the yards, possibly through having remained in use and repair until {{the closure of the}} station. The loading ramp was built in the early 1960s and is the most recent structure. The most substantial feature of the yards is the cattle dip, which is of the conventional design and construction. The dip was built during the O'Beirne's tenure and is the earliest surviving structure within the yards. The walls of the dip are of concrete with concrete rendered steps and <b>pit.</b> Bush <b>timber</b> uprights and rafters support a corrugated iron roof that covers the dip itself. Steps lead out of the dip to a concrete-surfaced draining and pound yard. Beyond the dip is a large circular holding yard over 50 metres in diameter which forms a significant feature of the stockyards.|$|R
50|$|Emil Höglund and Edvin Wiik {{were both}} in the timber business. Emil Höglund worked as a clerk and Edvin Wiik worked as an {{independent}} buyer of timber for the Hellnäs sawmills. As the sawmill was expected to foreclose after defaulting on its payments, both were faced with unemployment. Discussing their options, they decided to establish their own company, Wiik & Höglund, which was founded on August 28, 1929. The company was to engage in trade in round <b>timber,</b> <b>pit</b> props and pulpwood. Wiik acted as a buyer, and Höglund, having studied at a commercial college and {{spent some time in}} England in 1928, was responsible for sales and bookkeeping.|$|R
50|$|Adjacent to {{the arrival}} road {{inspection}} <b>pits</b> and a <b>timber</b> framed stores building clad in corrugated iron was also provided. Two elevated de-ashing roads were constructed {{to the south of}} the site near the coal stage. These de-ashing pits consisted of a set of pits between the rails and side pits that were used for the disposal of the ashes from the smokebox and ashpan produced by the burning of coal in the firebox of the steam locomotives. Running underneath these pits at an angle was a sunken rail line where wagons were placed to collect the deposited ashes. in 1925 these deashing pits had a steel and timber frame corrugated iron clad shed constructed over them.|$|R
50|$|The U.S. {{corporation}} {{would have}} the rights to all the mineral resources, including oil fields, found within a 20-kilometer zone {{on each side of}} the railway lines, as well as the privilege of carrying on subsidiary activities such as the laying of pipe lines, the utilization of water power for construction, and the building of port and terminal facilities on the Black Sea and the Gulf of Alexandretta. The corporation could utilize the resources of the public lands, including sand pits, gravel <b>pits,</b> quarries and <b>timber,</b> without compensation and was granted exemption from taxation. Retired Rear-Admiral Colby Mitchell Chester led the U.S. syndicate, thus the name Chester concession was employed, although the official name of the syndicate was the Ottoman-American Development Company.|$|R
50|$|Because of {{the thin}} coal seams, a special type of mining was practised at Arigna. A main tunnel was driven from which {{branched}} {{a series of}} secondary tunnels every 5-6 meters, where the coal was mined. The secondary tunnels followed the seams and were rather low. The miners typically worked lying on their back to cut the coal. These 'Cutters' or 'Brushers' also prepared the mine for the next days work, and extended the roads using explosives. 'Drawers' filled hutches (tubs) and pushed {{them out to the}} main underground mine road. Here the hutches were linked up to an endless-rope haulage system and were pulled to the outside. Sometimes small diesel locomotives were used to pull hutches out of the <b>pit.</b> 'Proppers' used <b>timber</b> pillars to prop up the mine roof.|$|R
50|$|The Sale Yards are {{a series}} of open pavilions with bush-timber posts, {{concrete}} floors, dressed timber roof framing and corrugated iron roofs. The roofs are a mixture of gabled, half-gabled and hipped forms, with fixed timber louvres infilling some of the gables. The yards contain {{a series of}} pens, framed in walls and gates of timber slats, with some of the walls being relocatable to vary the size of the pens. The gates have sliding timber slats used as catches. To the periphery {{are a series of}} uncovered pens and loading ramps for vehicles and the railway. The smaller pavilion to the east of the group contains an auction <b>pit</b> surrounded by <b>timber</b> bench seats. The yards are presently still in use weekly for pig and calf sales.|$|R
50|$|The hardest and strongest bronze {{contains}} {{large amounts}} of tin and little lead though an alloy with more than 25 per cent tin will have a low melting point and become brittle and susceptible to cracking. This low melting point {{proved to be the}} nemesis of Russia's third attempt at casting the Tsar Bell from 1733 to 1735. The bell was never rung, and a huge slab cracked off (11.5 tons) during a fire in the Kremlin in 1737 before it could ever be raised from its casting <b>pit.</b> Burning <b>timber</b> fell into the casting pit and the decision was whether to let it burn and risk melting the bell, or to pour water on it and risk causing it cracking from cooling it too quickly. The latter risk was chosen and, as feared, because of the low melting point of the bronze and uneven cooling, the bell was damaged. The present bell is sometimes referred to as Kolokol III (Bell III), because it is the third recasting; remnants from the old bell were melted down and the metal re-used to cast the new bell. This practice was fairly commonplace, as the metal materials were very costly. Bell metal was considered so valuable that the first bronze coins for England were made in France out of melted-down old bells.|$|R
40|$|Joggins, Nova Scotia, {{was one of}} {{the first}} places in North America where coal was mined. Dendrochronological meth-ods were {{employed}} to date <b>timber</b> <b>pit</b> props preserved within relic coal mine workings on the closely adjacent Fundy and Dirty seams. These remains comprise a system of “openings ” that represent formerly underground mines, now exposed by cliff retreat. Of the seventy-three samples collected, forty-eight were successfully cross-dated into floating chronologies and then compared against a local red spruce (Picea rubens) master chronology, thereby establishing the year in which each individual sample was cut as a live tree where bark was present. Results indicate cutting dates of 1849 – 1875, which are generally consistent with archival records of mining activity. Analysis of the 14 openings al-lows differentiation of two phases of mining. Most openings (1 – 9 and 11 – 12 with cut dates of 1849 – 1868) represent “adits ” driven into the cliff from the beach, and associated “levels”, which comprise an initial drift mine by the General Mining Association (1865 – 1871). Dendrochronological dates from trees with bark that precede the opening of this first mine suggest that timber stockpiled from the nearby Joggins Mine (opened 1847) was used in its construction. The remaining openings (10 and 13 – 14 with cut dates of 1873 – 1875) represent a system of “levels ” that comprise part of a later mine dug by the Joggins Coal Mining Company (1872 – 1877). Findings improve knowledge of the Joggins UNESCO World Heritage Site and help refine the regional chronology for future dendrochronological studies...|$|R
5000|$|While {{documentary}} {{evidence for the}} physical development of Taabinga is non-existent, Hector Munro, who {{was the son of}} George Munro, onetime manager of Boondooma station, and who was a friend of the Haly family, described the first structure at Taabinga as a hut:"built with bark, then perpendicular slabs with a ground floor and bark roof. The house known as the Boss's residence was built with <b>pit</b> saw and <b>timber</b> foundation logs of wood, squared on one side with walls of horizontal slabs and floor in boards of pit saw and roof shingles".From these rudimentary structures the homestead site gained more permanent buildings. It is claimed that {{the first part of the}} main residence, which still stands today, was constructed during the 1840s and was developed through to the 1850s. According to the Alford family, who later acquired Taabinga and whose papers have been published as Alford Family Notes, Charles Haly began residing at Taabinga with his family in the late 1850s, just prior to becoming sole lessee of the property. An article in The Queenslander in 1924 indicates the continued development of the homestead site in this period: [...] "Sixty-seven years ago where now stands this beautiful, and complete home, was little better than wild, crude bush". The freeholding of a portion of the Taabinga run by Charles Haly in 1863 would seem to indicate the existence of the main residence by this time. Its western wall is built from locally quarried sandstone and the cedar was obtained from the Bunya Mountains while the timber for the hardwood floors was taken from the property itself. At much the same time that the main residence was being constructed it is believed that the Halys also built the stockyards and stables. The stables, which remain well preserved, are located on an adjoining lot, however the stockyards were damaged in a fire during the 1950s.|$|R
