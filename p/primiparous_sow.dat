Factors included dietary treatments being (1) 5 % SDPP (PLA), (2) 3. 5 % yeast protein meal (NUP) and (3) medicated control (TMC) and parity (primiparous versus multiparous). The treatment groups were imposed from Day 19 through to weaning at Day 27. Selected pigs (n = 720, 28 +/- 3 days of age, 7. 4 +/- 1. 0 kg of bodyweight) were weaned and remained on their respective diets from Day 28 to Day 34. From Day 35 to Day 48 all group-housed pigs were offered a commercial weaner 1 diet, and from Day 49 to Day 68 pigs were offered a commercial weaner 2 diet. Growth performance, survival, and serum immunoglobulinGwere monitored throughout the nursery phase (Day 28 to Day 68). Adaptation of the gastrointestinal tract in the acute post-weaning phase (Day 28 to Day 34) was assessed in 36 individually housed male weaners, {{with the effects of}} feed on structural, digestive, microbial and immune parameters along the gastrointestinal tract determined atDay 34. Pre-weaning feed disappearance was greater (P< 0. 01) in multiparous litters independent of diet. In the commercial nursery, total removals (mortality and morbidity) were highest (P< 0. 01) in <b>primiparous</b> <b>sow</b> progeny, with pigs offered NUP having greater (P <= 0. 05) total removals. Pigs offered PLA had superior average daily gain, average daily feed intake and feed conversion ratio from Day 28 to Day 34 (P< 0. 05). Pigs offered NUP tended to (P= 0. 07) have superior average daily gain from Day 35 to Day 49. Pigs offered NUP had higher (P< 0. 05) serum immunoglobulinGconcentrations at Day 68 compared with pigs offered TMC, with the effect most pronounced in <b>primiparous</b> <b>sow</b> progeny. Individually housed weaners offered PLA consumed more (P< 0. 05) feed on Day 30 to Day 31, had shorter relative intestine length (P< 0. 05), greater villous height in the medial jejunum (P< 0. 10) and lower immuno-pathology scores along the intestine. Pigs offered PLA also tended (P< 0. 10) to have increased pancreatic-specific lipase and amylase activity compared with pigs offered NUP. Pigs offered NUP had a higher ratio of E. coli : coliforms in the colon (P< 0. 01) and more counts of beta-haemolytic bacteria in the medial jejunum (P< 0. 05) and colon (P< 0. 10). Diets containing either SDPP or NUP offered pigs benefits beyond nutrition relative to the medicated control diet. The benefits of SDPPwere highly effective but transient, while the yeast derived protein had a successive or accumulative effect which was more pronounced in <b>primiparous</b> <b>sow</b> progeny.

40|$|The aim of {{the present}} study was to {{estimate}} follicular and oocyte development of the same gilts in three phases of their reproductive life - prepuberal gilt (6 months old), cycling gilt (9. 5 months old) and <b>primiparous</b> <b>sow.</b> Follicular development was induced by injections of 1000 IU PMSG followed by 500 IU hCG 72 h later. Cumulus-oocyte-complexes (COCs) were recovered from preovulatory follicles of the left ovary, and follicular fluid (FF) from the right ovary always 34 h after hCG by endoscopy. Altogether, 19 gilts were used in the prepuberal (P) and cycling (C) trials and 12 of them in the primiparous trial (S). Altogether 168, 190 and 82 follicles were aspirated from the left ovary and 106, 125 and 42 COCs recovered (recovery rate 60. 5 ± 26. 9, 62. 7 ± 20. 9 and 52. 9 ± 21. 8 %). The average number of follicles was higher in C compared to P (19. 7 ± 6. 8 vs. 15. 7 ± 6. 8, p = 0. 06) and to S (14. 2 ± 4. 0, P < 0. 05), respectively. More uniform expanded COCs were aspirated from prepuberal and cycling gilts as compared to sows (89. 7 and 78. 4 % vs. 46. 3 %, P < 0. 05). Furthermore, the meiotic configuration in oocytes differed (P < 0. 05) between these groups (55. 5 and 61. 7 % vs. 0 % Telo 1 /Meta 2). Concentrations of progesterone in FF decreased (P < 0. 05) from 590. 0 ± 333. 6 (P) to 249. 1 ± 72. 6 (C) and 161. 4 ± 75. 2 ng/ml (S). FF concentrations of oestradiol- 17 β were different between gilts and sows (9. 3 ± 2. 9, 21. 9 ± 10. 6 and 94. 0 ± 15. 9 pg/ml, P < 0. 05). The progesterone/oestradiol ratio was 72. 1, 15. 2 and 4. 7. Results indicate a different follicular and oocyte development during the investigated lifetime periods. Cycling gilts should preferably be used in IVF and breeding programs. The lower reproductive potential of primiparous sows is taken into consideration at breeding.

40|$|A {{series of}} 5 {{experiments}} {{was conducted to}} test the general hypothesis that piglets subjected to intermittent suckling (IS, where piglets are temporarily separated from the sow during lactation) would have improved performance and gastrointestinal tract (GIT) structure and function after weaning compared with piglets weaned via conventional methods (abrupt weaning). It was also hypothesised that IS would not induce any additional stress or compromise piglet welfare before and after weaning, and that IS may in fact reduce the stress response immediately after weaning due to increased familiarity with creep feed and maternal separation. Piglets born to primiparous sows were {{the main focus of}} this thesis since they are lighter at birth, more susceptible to disease and generally have poorer performance than sow progeny, making them the most disadvantaged group at weaning. Separation times of 8 hours per day or 16 hours overnight were chosen for the IS regimen. Sugar absorption tests involving oral doses of mannitol, galactose and lactulose before and after weaning were used as markers of GIT tract absorptive capacity and permeability, and the stress response was assessed using a combination of neuroendocrine, immune, inflammatory and behavioural measures. Apart from a transient peak in cortisol and reduction in growth at the start of IS, the IS procedure was not associated with a chronic stress response. Onset of IS at an older age with an extended lactation (5 weeks instead of 4 weeks) markedly improved creep feed intake, post-weaning performance and galactose absorption in piglets born to primiparous sows. However, starting IS at 3 weeks with weaning at 4 weeks increased creep feed intake and post-weaning performance when progeny from multiparous sows were used and gave a varied response for <b>primiparous</b> <b>sow</b> progeny. Furthermore, IS in piglets born to primiparous sows had no effect on GIT permeability and did not attenuate post-weaning GIT structural changes, but rather advanced them as lactation progressed with IS piglets showing reduced absorption of mannitol and galactose before weaning. Longer separation times (16 hours versus 8 hours) had no impact on post-weaning performance or the stress responses, but did induce a more severe growth check at the start of IS. To further attenuate the stress associated with weaning, co-mingling (CoM, preweaning socialisation of piglets from different litters) was explored. It was hypothesised that CoM would improve post-weaning performance and GIT function through the facilitation of social eating behaviour and reduced aggression, and that combining IS with CoM would improve these measures additively. While CoM did not affect performance before or after weaning, post-weaning aggression was reduced and CoM piglets had the smallest changes in mannitol absorption over the periweaning period indicative of a larger GIT surface area. The combination of IS with CoM in piglets from multiparous sows additively improved post-weaning performance in the first week after weaning, but only when familiar groups remained together. From the experiments conducted in this thesis, it was shown that IS can improve piglet adaptation to weaning in multiparous litters, however IS in piglets born to primiparous sows gave varied responses. Furthermore, better performance outcomes were achieved if piglets had the opportunity to socialise with non-littermates and remain in familiar groups after weaning. It was shown that oral dosing with various sugars could be used in vivo to assess post-weaning changes to the GIT...|$|E
40|$|The {{present study}} was {{conducted}} to investigate the effect of exogenous prostaglandin F 2 alpha (PGF) administration on weaning-to-service interval (WSI) in <b>primiparous</b> <b>sows.</b> A total of 149 <b>primiparous</b> <b>sows,</b> 74 control and 75 treatment sows, were included in the study.

40|$|Normally, sows are in {{anoestrus}} during lactation {{and start}} their new cycle {{at the day}} of weaning. Modern hybrid <b>primiparous</b> <b>sows</b> that suckle large numbers of piglets may lose substantial amounts of body reserves during lactation. This compromises follicle development during lactation. As modern sows have short weaning-to-oestrus intervals, these compromised follicles are recruited for ovulation directly after weaning, resulting in lower ovulation rates and lower embryo survival. Postponing or skipping first oestrus after weaning in <b>primiparous</b> <b>sows</b> may help to limit {{the negative consequences of}} lactation on subsequent reproduction. Multiparous sows may have very high litter sizes, especially after long lactations as applied in organic sows. These high litter sizes compromise piglet birthweight and survival and subsequent performance. Inducing lactation oestrus in multiparous sows may help to limit litter size and improve piglet survival and performance. This study discusses physiological and reproductive effects of extending {{the start of a new}} pregnancy after lactation in <b>primiparous</b> <b>sows</b> and induction of lactation oestrus in multiparous sows.

40|$|Maturational {{changes during}} the {{follicular}} {{phase of the}} porcine oestrous cycle were investigated in spontaneously cycling gilts. The results revealed considerable variation in the morphological and biochemical development of dominant follicles in the early follicular phase. This asynchrony was emphasised by the marked differences in follicular fluid steroid concentrations and LH binding to granulose cells and theca tissue between follicles of identical size within the same ovary. The nature of this variation may have great significance on our present understanding of asynchronies in embryo development. On {{the basis of the}} variables assessed in this study, those follicles destined to ovulate or to become atretic were only readily distinguishable on Day 20 of the oestrous cycle, suggesting that the selection of the preovulatory population continues over a 4 day period from about Day 16 to Day 20 of the cycle and, furthermore, that the selection process involves some initial maturation even in those unselected follicles that ultimately join the atretic pool. Leading on from this study, the control of the initiation of follicular development in lactating primiparous sows was examined by assessing the relationships between ovarian activity and circulating hormone levels following manipulation of the suckling stimulus. In the first experiment, piglet suckling behaviour and follicular development were 'investigated following a reduction in litter size to five piglets (split-weaning), seven days before weaning at 21 days post-partum. Overall, morphological and biochemical follicular development were significantly advanced (p < 0. 001) in the treatment sows. The significantly (p < 0. 001) greater concentration of follicular fluid oestradiol in follicles recovered from the split-weaned sows suggested that the supply of androgen substrate was probably limiting production of this steroid in the control animals. It was proposed that the latter was due to inadequate gonadotrophin stimulation. The comparative ethological study revealed that the remaining split-weaned piglets 'multiple-suckled' quarters vacated by their heavier litter mates. Despite a constant suckling frequency, suckling intensity was reduced in the split-weaned litters as evidenced by a regression in mammary tissue growth in the dams. In a subsequent experiment, further manipulation of the suckling stimulus was achieved by physically restricting the number of mammary quarters available to the piglets. Canvas sheeting strapped around the anterior quarters of one group of sows (cover) limited the five piglets remaining after split-weaning to suckle only the posterior quarters. An investigation of circulating hormone levels, 12 hours before and 48 hours after the start of treatment, revealed that, compared to the split-weaned and control sows, LH levels were significantly (p < 0. 001) elevated in the cover sows with a concomitant significant (p < 0. 001) depression in circulating prolactin. Although split-weaning induced a similar endocrine response in several sows, this effect was short-lived and overall, levels of both hormones were similar in the split-weaned group to those recorded in the control sows. The concentration of oxytocin, released at suckling was unaffected by litter size or the intensity of mammary stimulation. Ovarian activity at weaning was significantly enhanced in the cover (p < 0. 001) and split-weaned (p < 0. 001) groups. Hence, it was concluded that the critical factor influencing hormone levels and follicular development in the lactating sow was the neural intensity of the suckling stimulus. The cumulative data of the lactation experiments suggest that in practice, serious consideration should be given to the use of litter size reduction as a means of effectively improving the performance of the <b>primiparous</b> <b>sow</b> and her litter during lactation...|$|E
40|$|The {{profitability}} of pig production may be {{expressed as a}} function of reproductivity and productivity. The optimal selection pressure on reproductivity relative to productivity depends on the response to selection and the economic value of the response. Reproductive performance is primarily a function of the dam and involves age at first oestrus, conception rate, litter size and the interval between weaning and oestrus. An increase in the litter size would improve the reproductive performance. Mean litter size has been rather constant in most countries over the last decades. This means that there has been no response to selection or no selection pressure on litter size. It could also imply a relatively deterioration in the environment or negative effects of selection for production characteristics. It has not been established whether selection for litter size is worthwhile. The heritability of the trait, possible selection differential and the economic value of litter size are important components determining the response to selection. Of these, heritability seems to be the major limiting factor. Estimates of this factor have been consistently low (~ 0. 10). A negative correlation between direct genetic and maternal effect might reduce the effective heritability or response to selection. A dam may influence her offspring through the environment she provides as well as through the genes transmitted to the offspring. This environmental effect of the dam on her offspring is referred to as maternal influence. The present study was focussed on the effect of the post-natal maternal conditions on the fertility of the daughter. Maternal influences are partly due {{to the size of the}} litter in which a gilt is raised. Gilts raised in small compared with large litters might produce larger litters. This maternal influence affects h 2 estimated by daughter-dam regression but not h 2 estimated by paternal half sib analysis. It is not clear how important the maternal influence on litter size is. Systematic differences in h 2 estimated by daughter-dam or paternal half sib analysis, have not been found. A negative effect of being raised in large litters on the size of the first litter from gilts raised in large litters was reported (table 2. 6). So maternal effects might counterbalance the response to selection for litter size. The experiments were performed to estimate the effect of standardization level (litter size during the suckling period) on the development of the gilt, age at puberty, size of the first litter and number of corpora lutea after first oestrus of the weaned <b>primiparous</b> <b>sow.</b> The effect of maternal influences on the response to selection was studied by simulation. Three generations of Dutch Landrace gilts were reared. The first generation (192 gilts) was purchased and the litters produced were standardized at 8 piglets within 24 hours of birth. Litters produced by the gilts of generation two were standardized at 6 (low level) or 12 piglets (high level). Thus the effect of the standardization level on production and reproduction traits was measured in gilts of generation three. Gilts were inseminated at a fixed age of approximately 255 days. Growth of litters from birth to weaning at five weeks of age, expressed per piglet, at the high standardization level was 24 % lower than those at the low level. From weaning to 56 days of age the difference was 8 %. This resulted in a weight at 56 days of 15. 8 and 18. 7 kg for gilts raised at the high and low levels respectively. Milk energy intake was ca. 26 % lower for piglets raised in large compared with small litters. The intake of milk and creep feed (ME) from 21 days to weaning was reduced by ca. 19 % (table 5. 1). Relations between intake of milk and creep feed, and growth were stronger at the high than at the low standardization level. Milk production is a limiting factor for growth especially in large litters. The significant weight difference between both standardization level groups at 56 and 74 days of age had disappeared at insemination. At a fixed weight (~ 100 kg) high standardization level gilts deposited more backfat than those standardized at the low level. At the high standardization level 20 % of the gilts that produced a litter did so as a result of insemination at the first oestrus while at the low level this per centage was 49. This result was obtained although the age at first oestrus and conception rate were not affected by the standardization level, and gilts were inseminated at a fixed age. From a total of 111 high and low standardization level gilts which produced a litter, 96 were halothane negative. The estimate of standardization level effect on litter size obtained from halothane negative gilts, after correction for oestrus number at insemination, was - 0. 48 piglets (high-low; table 5. 5). The realized difference in standardization level was 5. 4 piglets which resulted in an estimate of the "m-value", defined by Falconer (1965), of - 0. 09. The coefficient m is the partial regression coefficient of daughters' phenotypic value on mothers' phenotypic value for litter size in the absence of genetic variation among the mothers. This m value can be split into a pre- and a post-natal component m 1 and m 2 (m = m 1 + m 2 ). Uterus weight was higher in low compared with high standardization level sows. The former also tended to have longer uterus horns. A tendency to a higher number of corpora lutea in low than in high standardization level gilts was observed in sows in which oestrus after weaning of the first litter was induced. Results obtained suggest that a low standardization level positively affects weaning weight and development of the uterus. This, in combination with a larger pool of primordial follicles might explain the positive effect on litter size. From a simulation study and derived formulae it was concluded that daughter- dam regression coefficients (trait: first litter size) are seriously biased by pre-and post-natal maternal effects while granddaughter-granddam estimates are biased to a much smaller extent (fig. 5. 5). Standardization of litters will eliminate the post-natal maternal effect as determined by litter size during the suckling period. Maternal influences affect the response to selection in two ways. Firstly the relation between additive genetic value and phenotypic value will be changed. A value of - 0. 1 or - 0. 2 for m reduced the regression coefficient by 5 and 11 % respectively. Secondly, maternal effects result in an important permanent negative effect on litter size as, in a selection programme for litter size, the next generation of gilts will be born and raised in large litters. Selection of boars only from the largest litters does not result in a permanent negative effect. The reduction of the regression coefficient of additive genetic value to phenotypic value by maternal effects can be eliminated by correction of the data. For this purpose accurate estimates of m 1 and m 2 are needed. It is doubtful whether this correction is worthwhile as the effect on the regression coefficient and thus on the response to selection is small. Standardization of litters will be more efficient as it also removes the permanent negative effect on litter size as far as is determined by post- natal maternal effects. It cannot be concluded from a negative daughter-dam correlation for number born that selection of replacement gilts born and raised in large litters would not bring about desirable genetic changes in litter size. The value of the regression coefficient of additive to phenotypic value is of significance. Over a range of plausible values for m this regression coefficient, and thus genetic change, decreased by 5 to 10 % due to maternal effects. So the genetic implications of maternal effects on litter size are limited. Selection will result in an additive genetic response. The permanent negative environmental effect on litter size, if replacement gilts are born and raised in large litters, does reduce the phenotypic value. To a large extent, standardization of litters will remove this, from an economic point of view, unfavourable effect. The response to several generations of selection for litter size might be zero because of this permanent negative environmental effect and/or the limited size of the experiment. Selection for fertility is possible but is not always evident because too few animals have been used. Large scale experiments or lines in which litters are standardized are needed to improve litter size or overall reproductive performance by selection. Points of interest for the future are - assessing the economically important components of overall reproductive performance - achieving accurate estimates of genetic and phenotypic correlations and heritabilities involved - combining the sources of information in an index and - assessing an optimal selection scheme. It may be postulated that the rather constant mean litter size over the last decades is probably caused by a low realized selection pressure. A higher selection pressure in combination with more efficient methods (larger scale experiments, standardization of litters, accurate data collection, combining sources of information) practized over a period of 10 years or more will result in a response to selection which is of economic interest...|$|E

40|$|In <b>primiparous</b> <b>sows,</b> {{feed intake}} is {{generally}} insufficient to meet lactation demands during lactation. Inadequate nutrient supply increases mobilisation of body reserves during lactation and, as a consequence, affect subsequent reproduction. Excessive loss of body reserves during lactation {{is not only}} associated with delayed postweaning oestrus {{and the size of}} the subsequent litter, but also increases culling rate and reduces sow longevity and the productivity of the breeding herd. The aim of the thesis was to develop a clear understanding of the impact of a negative energy balance during lactation affects reproductive performance of modern <b>primiparous</b> <b>sows</b> in Australia, and evaluate feeding strategies involving energy manipulations during crucial periods for improving subsequent litter size. In the first study, the associations of sow body weight changes during lactation and the body weight at weaning with subsequent reproductive performance were studied. By minimising body weight loss and maintain adequate body reserves at weaning through the supply of sufficient energy when rearing equal to or less than ten piglets during lactation, the post-weaning reproduction of modern <b>primiparous</b> <b>sows</b> may not be affected. In the second study, the carry-over effects of energy intake during the early antral phase and subsequent follicular phase on follicle recruitment and ovulation rate were assessed using a gilt model. Follicle size at the end of the luteal phase was greater for gilts that were previously fed at a high feed level. During the follicular phase, high feeding increased follicle size at Day 5 and plasma oestradiol concentration. Nevertheless, a low feed level during the luteal phase reduced ovulation rate and the number of embryo, and this was not counteracted by feed level during the follicular phase. Plasma progesterone concentration after ovulation was lower for gilts that were restricted-fed throughout the whole period than for other treatments. These results indicate that undernutrition during early antral follicular development may have a residual effect on follicle recruitment and quality. In the third study, the effects of substituting 1 kg of a standard lactation diet with 1 kg of a sugar-rich or fat-rich diet during late lactation on blood glucose and insulin changes were investigated. The results suggest that a sugar-enriched diet during the last week of lactation elevates circulating glucose and insulin concentrations, and may potentially improve post-weaning fertility in <b>primiparous</b> <b>sows.</b> Therefore, the fourth study investigated the effects of pre-weaning energy substitutions plus postweaning altrenogest treatment as positive control on follicular development, endocrine characteristics and subsequent litter size in <b>primiparous</b> <b>sows.</b> The weaning-to-ovulation interval tended to be reduced in the sugar-rich treatment, although body weight loss during the treatment period, post-weaning follicle development, plasma oestradiol and pre-weaning leptin did not differ among treatments, except body weight loss was lower and leptin was higher in the altrenogest treatment. Post-ovulatory progesterone concentration in the sugar treatment was higher. Sows in the sugar-rich and altrenogest treatments had a greater proportion of litters with larger litter sizes. The outcome indicates that increasing circulating insulin and glucose concentrations during late lactation or a week of metabolic recovery positively improves subsequent litter size in <b>primiparous</b> <b>sows.</b> It is recommended from the outcomes of this thesis that an improvement of reproductive performance can be achieved by maximising energy intake (with insulin-stimulating diet) during late lactation or post-weaning altrenogest administration for a week for energy restoration to minimising post-weaning negative energy impacts, and ultimately improve reproductive performance in <b>primiparous</b> <b>sows.</b> Thesis (Ph.

Embryo size and volume on day 11. 5 to 11. 75 of gestation were recorded. Embryo recovery was 71. 4 % based on the number of corpora lutea. Minimal differences were observed between sows and gilts for endocrine and embryo data. However, endocrine differences were noted for pigs with high embryo survival (> 71 % recovery) compared to those with low survival. Peak estradiol- 17 β occurred closer to the onset of estrus in pigs with high embryo survival than in pigs with low embryo survival, and peak LH occurred later after the onset of estrus for pigs with high embryo survival.

Seventeen primiparous Landrace X Large White sows farroed in August 1982, lactated 23. 8 ± 0. 4 days (mean ± SEM), and weaned 9. 0 ± 0. 3 pigs per litter. Blood for determination of progesterone, luteinizing hormone (LH), and estradiol- 17 β (E) was collected every 6 h from 1 day before to 12 days after weaning. Twelve sows exhibited spontaneous estrus 135 ± 9 h after weaning, and these sows {{were considered to be}} normal. Five sows were anestrous for at least 23 days postweaning and failed to ovulate, as indicated by concentrations of progesterone that were less than 1. 0 ng/ml in blood samples collected daily during this period. From Day 0 to Day 30 postweaning, levels of estradiol in anestrous sows varied between 3 and 30 pg/ml, concentrations of LH were low, and preovulatory-like LH surges did not occur. Beginning on Day 30 postweaning, four anestrous sows were given 1. 5 µg GnRH (i. v.) hourly until onset of estrus and blood was collected every 6 h during GnRH treatment. The average interval from beginning of GnRH treatment to onset of estrus was 84 ± 5 h (range 72 to 96 h). Patterns of estradiol and LH secretion around estrus were similar in normal sows and those treated with GnRH. Estradiol remained elevated above basal concentrations (25 pg/ml) for 49. 6 ± 4. 0 h in normal sows compared to 48. 0 ± 0 h in GnRH-treated sows.

A log survivorship function identified the characteristic interval length to differentiate between two bouts. Interval lengths larger than 12 min separated two meals (29 min two drinking bouts). The meal and drinking bout criteria were used to derive the following traits: feeding and drinking duration per day (FD, DD), interval duration within feeding (pauseF) or drinking (pauseW) meal, feeding and drinking meal duration per day (FMD, DMD) and feeding and drinking visits per day (FV, DV).

Weaning-to-ovulation interval tended to be reduced in the S treatment compared with C (p = 0. 06) and F (p = 0. 08) treatments. Body weight (BW) loss during the treatment period, post-weaning follicle development, plasma oestradiol and pre-weaning leptin did not differ among C, F and S sows, although BW loss was lower and leptin was higher in the R treatment. Post-ovulatory progesterone concentration in the S treatment was higher (p < 0. 05). Sows in the S and R treatments had {{a greater proportion of}} litters with larger litter sizes (p < 0. 05). The outcome suggests that increasing circulating insulin and glucose concentrations during late lactation or a week of metabolic recovery positively improves subsequent litter size in <b>primiparous</b> <b>sows.</b> TY Chen, P Stott, EG Bouwman and P Langendij...|$|R
