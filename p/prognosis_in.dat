For example, having {{two copies of}} ApoE4 (a variant of the gene encoding apolipoprotein E that also {{plays a role in}} Alzheimer's disease) seems to increase risk for delayed ischemia and a worse outcome. The occurrence of hyperglycemia (high blood sugars) after an episode of SAH confers a higher risk of poor outcome.|$|E

5|$|The five-year {{survival}} rate for endometrial adenocarcinoma following appropriate treatment is 80%. Most women, over 70%, have FIGO stage I cancer, {{which has the}} best prognosis. Stage III and especially Stage IV cancers has a worse prognosis, but these are relatively rare, occurring in only 13% of cases. The median survival time for stage III-IV endometrial cancer is nine to tenmonths.

25|$|Ependymomas are tumors {{arising from}} the ependyma, an epithelium-like tissue of the central nervous system. In {{patients}} with NF2 and ependymomas, the tumor suppressant function of Merlin may be compromised. Loss of function mutations occurring in chromosome 22q, where Merlin proteins are coded, can promote tumorigenesis, or {{the creation of new}} tumorous cells.

25|$|Angiogenesis is {{essential}} for the supply of oxygen and nutrients to nourish the growing tumor. CYR61 is a powerful angiogenic inducer in vivo, and it can also promote cancer cell proliferation, invasion, survival, epithelial–mesenchymal transition, and metastasis. Accordingly, forced overexpression of CYR61 enhanced tumor growth in xenografts of breast cancer cells, prostate cancer cells, ovarian carcinoma cells, and squamous carcinoma cells. Clinically, CYR61 expression correlates with the tumor stage, tumor size, lymph node positivity, and poor <b>prognosis</b> <b>in</b> several cancers, including breast cancer, prostate cancer, glioma, gastric adenocarcinoma, and squamous cell carcinoma.|$|E
25|$|Surgical removal is the {{treatment}} of choice, but chest x-rays should be taken first to rule out metastasis. Removal should be with wide margins to prevent recurrence, taking the whole mammary gland if necessary. Because 40 to 50 percent of dog mammary tumors have estrogen receptors, spaying is recommended by many veterinarians. A recent study showed a better <b>prognosis</b> <b>in</b> dogs that are spayed {{at the time of}} surgery or that had been recently spayed.

25|$|Ovarian cancer {{survival}} varies {{significantly with}} subtype. Dysgerminomas {{have a very}} favorable <b>prognosis.</b> <b>In</b> early stages, they have a five-year survival rate of 96.9%. Around two-thirds of dysgerminomas are diagnosed at stage I. Stage-III dysgerminomas have a five-year survival of 61%; when treated with BEP chemotherapy after incomplete surgical removal, dysgerminomas have a 95% two-year survival rate. Sex-cord-stromal malignancies also have a favorable prognosis; because they are slow-growing, even those with metastatic disease can survive a decade or more. Low malignant potential tumors usually only have a bad prognosis when there are invasive tumor implants found in the peritoneal cavity.|$|E
25|$|The International Prognostic Scoring System (IPSS) was {{developed}} in the mid-1990s to assess the prognosis of MDS patients. This system stratifies cases into 2 groups; a lower-risk group (sub divided into low and intermediate-1) and a higher risk (subdivided into intermediate-2 and high). It uses the blast percentage, number of cytopaenias and bone marrow cytogenetics data to place cases of CMML into these groups. Due to the scoring system being developed for MDS, the more myeloproliferative cases of CMML (WBC >13x109) are excluded from the scoring system. Although the IPSS scoring system is used clinically, there is a high variability in each group. For this reason, new modalities for assessing <b>prognosis</b> <b>in</b> MDS (and CMML) are being developed.|$|E
25|$|Malignant {{tumors are}} also {{subdivided}} histopathologically into those showing blood vessel wall invasion {{and those that}} do not. Without blood vessel wall invasion there is a better prognosis. Dogs with noninvasive adenocarcinomas have an average survival time of two years, while dogs with invasive adenocarcinomas have an average survival time of one year. Tumor size also affects the <b>prognosis,</b> <b>in</b> that dogs with tumors greater than five centimeters have a greater chance of lymph node metastasis. Tumor type is also important. Sarcomas and carcinosarcomas carry an average survival time of nine to twelve months. Inflammatory carcinomas have a very poor prognosis, and have usually metastasized by the time of diagnosis. Metastasis for any malignant mammary tumor is usually to the regional lymph nodes and lungs.|$|E

In this study, we aimed to evaluate the expression of KIF 2 A and its robustness and potential to predict clinical outcomes in gastric cancer (GC) patients. The messenger RNA (mRNA) expression of KIF 2 A was determined in 24 pairs of cancerous and adjacent nontumor tissues by real-time polymerase chain reaction. Immunohistochemistry of KIF 2 A was performed on a tissue microarray composed of 461 GC and 65 matched adjacent nontumor tissues removed during surgeries and 18 chronic gastritis, 15 intestinal metaplasia, and 37 low-grade and 62 high-grade intraepithelial neoplasias acquired through gastric endoscopic biopsies. Univariate and multivariate Cox regression models were used to perform survival analyses. The high KIF 2 A expression was significantly correlated to histological type, TNM stage, and lymph node metastasis. A negative correlation was found between KIF 2 A expression and the 5 -year survival rate of GC patients. In addition, multivariate analysis indicated that KIF 2 A is an independent prognostic factor in GC. This study demonstrated the high KIF 2 A expression might serve as an independent marker for poor <b>prognoses</b> <b>in</b> GC patients...|$|R

Because he had little experience in teaching, his early classes followed the teachings of Dr. Roche, a French surgeon who wrote a book on medicine and surgery that Argumosa would later translate into Spanish in 1828. He continued until 1829, when he became the Chair of Surgery at the College of San Carlos, then later worked at the surgical clinic. During those years he married Micaela Adán, the daughter of sculptor Juan Adán Morlán, and had three children: Diego, who died when he was nine years old, and Isabel and Natalia.|$|E
25|$|The first {{reported}} cases of knocked-out teeth being replanted was by Pare’ in 1593. In 1706, Pierre Fauchard also reported replanting knocked out teeth. Wigoper in 1933 used a cast gold splint to hold reimplanted teeth in place. In 1959, Lenstrup and Skieller declared that the success rate of replanted knocked out teeth {{should be considered a}} temporary procedure because the success rate of less than 10% was so poor. In 1966 in a retrospective study, Andresen theorized that 90% of avulsed teeth could be successfully retained if they were replanted within the first 30 minutes of the accident. In 1974, Cvek showed that removal of the dental pulp following reimplantation was necessary to prevent resorption of the tooth root. In 1974, Cvek showed that storage of knocked out teeth in saline could improve the success of replanted teeth. In 1977, Lindskog et al. showed that the key to retention of the knocked-out teeth was to maintain the vitality of the periodontal ligament. In 1980, Blomlof showed the storing the periodontal ligament cells in a biocompatible medium could extend the extra oral time to four hours or more. He found that the best storage medium was a medical research fluid called Hank’s Balanced Solution. In this study, it was serendipitously discovered that milk could also maintain cell viability for two hours. In 1981, Andreasen showed that crushing of cells on the tooth root could cause death of the cells and lead to resorption and reduction in <b>prognosis.</b> <b>In</b> 1983, Matsson et al. showed that soaking in Hank’s Balanced Solution for thirty minutes prior to reimplantation could revitalize extracted dog’s teeth that were dry for 60 minutes. In 1989, a systematic storage device was developed to optimally store and preserve knocked out teeth. In 1992, Trope et al. showed that extracted dog’s teeth could be stored in Hank’s Balanced Solution for up to 96 hours and still maintain significant vitality. In this study, milk was only able to maintain vitality for two hours.|$|E
