40|$|University of Minnesota Ph. D. dissertation. December 2012. Major: Statistics. Advisor:Glen Meeden. 1 {{computer}} file (PDF); x, 130 pages. <b>Cluster</b> <b>sampling</b> is a survey design that {{is commonly used}} when a simple random sample may be too costly or inefficient to implement for a population. The idea of a <b>cluster</b> <b>sample</b> is that a population {{can be divided into}} groups called clusters. The usual <b>cluster</b> <b>sample</b> consists of sampling n of the N clusters within a population. Within these <b>clusters,</b> a further <b>sample</b> may be taken of secondary sampling units. When a further sample is taken within the primary sample, this is called a two-stage <b>cluster</b> <b>sampling</b> design. Design-based estimates of mean and total are well-established for two-stage <b>cluster</b> <b>samples.</b> For certain populations, however, a Bayesian approach may be preferred for ease of interpretation or to estimate a parameter not well-developed in the design-based literature. When a Bayesian approach is used, a commonly desired property of the model is that the sampled and unsampled units are exchangeable. In this way, the data and not the model is influencing population estimates. A Bayesian approach in which the sampled and unsampled units are exchangeable is the Bayes Urn model. In this dissertation, we will show how the Bayes Urn model can provide admissible estimators under any finite parameter space. Using simulation studies for a variety of two-stage <b>cluster</b> <b>samples,</b> we will show how the Bayes Urn estimates are similar to the standard design-based estimates. As an extension, we will use the Bayes Urn model to incorporate auxiliary information for two-stage <b>cluster</b> <b>samples.</b> For both of these cases we will compare the Bayes Urn estimate of the population total to the standard design-based estimates as well as two standard Bayesian estimates. In the case when auxiliary information is available for a two-stage <b>cluster</b> <b>sample,</b> there is no well-developed Bayesian approach in the literature. In addition to population total, we will also consider estimates of cluster median, in which no design-based approach is well-developed in the literature. Through these simulation studies, the admissibility proof, and the flexible properties inherent of the Bayes Urn model, we will see that this approach can provide useful estimations in complex designs beyond the two-stage <b>cluster</b> <b>sample</b> design...|$|R

It is drawn from a combination of the restricted adaptive <b>cluster</b> <b>sampling</b> of Brown (1994) and a two-stage adaptive <b>cluster</b> <b>sampling.</b> For this new sampling design an unbiased estimator of the total and its sample variance are also suggested.
