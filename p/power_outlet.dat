40|$|This thesis {{describes}} {{the design and}} construction of a self-feeding robot. Biological models have been the inspiration {{for much of the}} current Embedded Robotics research. However, some aspects of living creatures have not been completely explored in these models. One of these aspects is the need that living creatures have for food in order to maintain an adequate energy level to function. This thesis proposes to build a robot capable of acquiring its “food. ” In this case the “food ” is electric energy acquired from the <b>power</b> <b>outlets</b> in the walls. The energy from the <b>power</b> <b>outlets</b> is used to recharge the robot’s batteries. Therefore, the robot has skills such as: searching for <b>power</b> <b>outlets,</b> connecting to <b>power</b> <b>outlets,</b> and recharging its batteries...|$|R

25|$|About 6 a.m. on 17 November 2010 a fire {{broke out}} on the vehicle deck of the MS Pearl of Scandinavia on its way from Oslo to Copenhagen. The ferry's fire {{sprinkler}} system {{put out the fire}} before any of the crew or the 490 sleeping passengers were injured and the ship could dock in Copenhagen under its own power. It was determined that the cause of the fire was a short circuit in the plug of an extension cord used to charge a rebuilt Nissan Qashqai, converted into a battery electric vehicle by the Sakskøbing based company A Future EV. The company owner was returning from Norway where the vehicle had started the approval process for general sale there, and had used an extension cord to charge the vehicle from a general purpose <b>power</b> <b>outlet</b> on the ferry. The ferry operator DFDS Seaways consequently prohibited vehicle charging on board its ferries while the investors withdrew their support for the vehicle company forcing it into bankruptcy.|$|E
