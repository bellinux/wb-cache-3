5|$|Common ravens {{are known}} to steal and cache shiny objects such as pebbles, <b>pieces</b> <b>of</b> <b>metal,</b> and golf balls. One theory is that they hoard shiny objects to impress other ravens. Other {{research}} indicates that juveniles are deeply curious about all new things, and that common ravens retain an attraction to bright, round objects based on their similarity to bird eggs. Mature birds lose their intense interest in the unusual, and become highly neophobic.|$|E
5|$|Steel drums are a distinctively Trinidadian {{ensemble}} {{that evolved}} from improvised percussion instruments used in Carnival processions. By the late 1930s, bamboo tubes, a traditional instrumental, were supplemented by <b>pieces</b> <b>of</b> <b>metal</b> used percussively; over time, these metal percussion instruments were pitched to produce {{as many as}} twenty-some tones. Steel bands were large orchestras of these drums, and were banned by the British colonial authorities. Nevertheless, steel drums spread across the Caribbean, and are now an entrenched {{part of the culture}} of Trinidad and Tobago.|$|E

25|$|A rivet is {{essentially}} a two-headed and unthreaded bolt which holds two other <b>pieces</b> <b>of</b> <b>metal</b> together. Holes are drilled or punched through the two <b>pieces</b> <b>of</b> <b>metal</b> to be joined. The holes being aligned, a rivet is passed through the holes and permanent heads are formed onto {{the ends of the}} rivet utilizing hammers and forming dies (by either coldworking or hotworking).|$|E

25|$|Since {{the melted}} metal flows {{out of the}} workpiece, there must be room on the {{opposite}} side of the workpiece for the spray to exit. When possible, <b>pieces</b> <b>of</b> <b>metal</b> are cut on a grate that lets the melted metal fall freely to the ground. The same equipment can be used for oxyacetylene blowtorches and welding torches, by exchanging the part of the torch in front of the torch valves.|$|E

25|$|Bottle caps, or closures, {{are used}} to seal the {{openings}} of bottles of many types. They can be small circular <b>pieces</b> <b>of</b> <b>metal,</b> usually steel, with plastic backings, and for plastic bottles a plastic cap is used instead. Caps can also be plastic, sometimes with a pour spout. Flip-Top caps like Flapper closures provide controlled dispensing of dry products. The crown cork, the first form of a bottle cap, possessed flanges bent over a sealed bottle to compress the liquid inside. It was invented and patented in 1892 by William Painter of Baltimore, Maryland.|$|E
25|$|In {{terms of}} hard pollution, {{plastics}} like bags and packaging are most common, they {{catch in the}} trees at the high-water mark on the creek banks, tires are also particularly common {{as well as other}} car parts such as batteries and <b>pieces</b> <b>of</b> <b>metal.</b> Large pieces of concrete somehow find their way into the creek at various locations and sit amongst the rocks almost blending in if it weren't for the exposed aggregate. Clothing is also common, particularly synthetic items such as gloves, shoes and bags, while clothing such as shirts made from organic materials break down into the environment.|$|E
25|$|World War I bomb sight designs had {{improved}} rapidly, {{with the ultimate}} development being the Course Setting Bomb Sight, or CSBS. This was essentially a large mechanical calculator that directly represented the wind triangle using three long <b>pieces</b> <b>of</b> <b>metal</b> in a triangular arrangement. The hypotenuse of the triangle was the line the aircraft needed to fly along in order to arrive over the target {{in the presence of}} wind, which, before the CSBS, was an intractable problem. Almost all air forces adopted some variation of the CSBS as their standard inter-war bomb sight, including the US Navy and US Army, who used a version designed by Georges Estoppey, the D-series.|$|E
5000|$|Strike branding: Similar to {{the process}} used to brand livestock, [...] a <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> <b>metal</b> is heated and pressed onto the skin for the brand. Historically {{it was used to}} claim {{ownership}} of slaves or to punish criminals, but as a form of body art, strike branding is less preferable to other types because it is not precise and tends to spread greatly on healing, and is not advisable for curved areas of the body. More successful is the multi-strike brand; it is done piece-by-piece rather than all at once. For example, to get a V-shaped brand, two lines would be burned separately by a straight <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> <b>metal,</b> rather than by a V-shaped <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> <b>metal.</b>|$|R

25|$|Fully {{autonomous}} only {{appeared in}} the second half of the 20th century. The first digitally operated and programmable robot, the Unimate, was installed in 1961 to lift hot <b>pieces</b> <b>of</b> <b>metal</b> from a die casting machine and stack them. Commercial and industrial robots are widespread today and used to perform jobs more cheaply, more accurately and more reliably, than humans. They are also employed in some jobs which are too dirty, dangerous, or dull to be suitable for humans. Robots are widely used in manufacturing, assembly, packing and packaging, mining, transport, earth and space exploration, surgery, weaponry, laboratory research, safety, and the mass production of consumer and industrial goods.|$|E
25|$|Electrotype {{was also}} used to {{manufacture}} matrices {{that could be used}} as moulds for individual <b>pieces</b> <b>of</b> <b>metal</b> type. This had several advantages over traditional punchcutting in hard steel: the type master only needed to be carved out of soft metal, and was also useful for large sizes of type, since it was hard to drive large punches into a matrix effectively. It cut the cost of decorative types that would not be used so often as body text typefaces. On the other hand, it gave no steel punch {{that could be used to}} create multiple matrices quickly, and was reported to not always give such good results as steel punchcutting.|$|E
25|$|Friction stir welding (FSW) is a {{solid-state}} joining {{process that}} uses a non-consumable tool to join two facing workpieces without melting the workpiece material. Heat is generated by friction between the rotating tool and the workpiece material, {{which leads to a}} softened region near the FSW tool. While the tool is traversed along the joint line, it mechanically intermixes the two <b>pieces</b> <b>of</b> <b>metal,</b> and forges the hot and softened metal by the mechanical pressure, which is applied by the tool, much like joining clay, or dough. It is primarily used on wrought or extruded aluminium and particularly for structures which need very high weld strength. FSW is also found in modern shipbuilding, trains, and aerospace applications.|$|E
60|$|After {{the heavy}} rain of a {{thunderstorm}} has washed the soil, it sometimes happens that a child, or a rustic, finds a wedge-shaped <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> <b>metal</b> {{or a few}} triangular flints in a field or near a road. There was no such <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> <b>metal,</b> there were no such flints, lying there yesterday, and the finder is puzzled {{about the origin of}} the objects on which he has lighted. He carries them home, and the village wisdom determines that the wedge-shaped <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> <b>metal</b> is a 'thunderbolt,' or that the bits of flint are 'elf-shots,' the heads of fairy arrows. Such things are still treasured in remote nooks of England, and the 'thunderbolt' is applied to cure certain maladies by its touch.|$|R

25|$|The {{documentary}} featured {{one notable}} {{change from the}} UFO Files story – Tim Oates, grandson of Brawley Oates and the now-owner of the property with the sealed well where the UFO wreckage was purportedly buried, allowed the investigators to unseal the well, {{in order to examine}} it for possible debris. Water was taken from the well which tested normal except for large amounts of aluminum present; the well had no significant contents. It was stated in the episode that any large <b>pieces</b> <b>of</b> <b>metal</b> had been removed from the well by a past owner of the property. Further, the remains of a windmill base were found near the well site, which refuted Ms. Pegues' statements (from the 1979 Time magazine article) that Judge Proctor never had a windmill on his property.|$|E
25|$|Remembering the {{effective}} use of propaganda in the leadup to the second World War, the opposing camps later began berating one another with enormous signs displaying loud political slogans, facing {{each other across the}} border zone. That on the western side was erected first, in direct response to the ban on sales of Western newspapers in East Berlin, and comprised an illuminated display board 30 m wide and 1.5 m deep, facing east, supported on three steel lattice towers 25 m high and topped by the words DIE FREIE BERLINER PRESSE MELDET (The Free Berlin Press Announces). Important messages were spelt out on the display board using up to 2,000 bulbs. The sign was switched on {{for the first time on}} 10 October 1950, watched by a large crowd. A month later, on 18 November, the Communist authorities in the east ordered its destruction using a catapult made from a compressed air hose loaded with pebbles and small <b>pieces</b> <b>of</b> <b>metal.</b> However, the order was not executed and the sign lasted until 1974, an eventual victim of its own high maintenance costs.|$|E
25|$|Bernhardt {{was one of}} {{the first}} actresses to star in moving pictures. The first {{projected}} film was shown by the Lumiere brothers at the Grand Café in Paris on 28 December 1895. In 1900, the cameraman who had shot the first films for the Lumiere brothers, Clément Maurice, approached Bernhardt and asked her to make a film out of a scene from her stage production of Hamlet. The scene was Prince Hamlet's duel with Laertes, with Bernhardt in the role of Hamlet. Maurice made a phonograph recording at the same time, so the film could be accompanied by sound. The sound of the clashing wooden prop swords was not loud and realistic enough, so Maurice had a stage hand bang <b>pieces</b> <b>of</b> <b>metal</b> together in sync with the sword fight. Maurice's finished two-minute film, Le Duel d'Hamlet, was presented to the public at the 1900 Paris Universal Exposition between 14 April and 12 November 1900. The short film became one of the most popular attractions of the Exposition. The sound quality on the disks and the synchronization were very poor, so the system never became a commercial success. Nonetheless, her film is cited as one of the first examples of a sound film.|$|E
