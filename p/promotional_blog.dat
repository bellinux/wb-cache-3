40|$|Promotional blogs for [NEW] Bold MUKU Project were {{inspired}} by the current situation when Indonesian teenagers have no big interest in reading books because of the digital media. In 2011, a book-sharing movement, Bold MUKU Project, tried to track back Indonesian teenagers 2 ̆ 7 reading interest and yet did not work successfully due to the unspecific target market, the lack of planning, sources, and member structuring. Therefore, the promotional blogs must be created based on {{the interest of the}} target audience and relevant concepts. The results of the surveys and the concepts of Internet consumer behavior and theory of copywriting by Rob Bowdery are considered to create promotional blogs for [NEW] Bold MUKU Project, that is, the main blog and an Instagram account. The main blog provides information and discussion among the community. The second <b>promotional</b> <b>blog</b> is Instagram as a place to attract viewers to open the main blog. In conclusion, in order to have successful promotional blogs, the contents of the promotional blogs must fit to the target audience 2 ̆ 7 s interests and needs...|$|E
40|$|This thesis will {{chart the}} lives of two films {{released}} in the 21 st century that had audiences identifiable as cult: The Room (Tommy Wiseau, 2003) and Snakes on a Plane (David R. Ellis, 2006). It will cover each film's conception, production history, release, reception and ongoing half-life. But special focus will be given in each case to the online activities of the fans, be it creating fan art or spreading word of these particular films. Specifically, this thesis will discuss online fan activity pertaining to both films, and how each film and fan activities related to each fit {{in the context of}} fan studies and cult studies. This thesis is not so much about cult films per se but about how cult audiences are created and maintained in the age of modern, Web-based practices and phenomena (<b>promotional</b> web pages, <b>blogging,</b> forums, memetics, and so on) ...|$|R
40|$|Nos últimos anos, muitos blogs ganharam notoriedade e se tornaram referências em determinados nichos. Estes blogs atraem tanto a atenção do público assim como de empresas querendo desenvolver ações promocionais junto a esta audiência. Por outro lado, o desenvolvimento de serviços de publicidade online permitiu o surgimento de novos pequenos anunciantes, assim como novos pequenos veículos que dispostos a exibir anúncios. O objetivo deste trabalho é, portanto, compreender a profissionalização dos blogs brasileiros a partir de uma investigação sobre as dinâmicas promocionais na blogosfera. A pesquisa busca {{discutir}} a relação entre a cultura participativa (Jenkins, 2006 b) da Internet, a virtualização da economia e o papel dos blogueiros neste contexto. Para tal, foi conduzido um estudo netnográfico que consistiu em: a) acompanhar os cem blogs brasileiros de maior autoridade do ranking do indexador Blogblogs, onde investigou-se a presença e o gerenciamento de publicidade e buscou-se outros indícios da profissionalização do meio; b) realizar uma observação participante no I Fórum de Mídias Digitais e Sociais FMDS e no BlogCamp Paraná. In recent years, many blogs {{have gained}} notoriety {{and have become}} authorities in certain niches. These blogs attract both {{the attention of the}} public as well as companies aiming to develop <b>promotional</b> campaigns targeting <b>blogs</b> audience. Moreover, the development of online advertising services allows the emergence of new small advertisers, in addition to new small vehicles willing to display ads. Therefore, the objective {{of this study is to}} understand the professionalization of Brazilian blogs through an investigation of the promotional dynamics in the blogosphere. The research discusses the relationship between the participatory culture (Jenkins, 2006 b) of the Internet, the virtualization of the economy and the role of bloggers in this context. In order to achieve this work's goals, a netnographic study was conducted and it consisted of: a) following the 100 most authoritative Brazilian blogs ranked in the Blogblogs index to investigate the presence and management of advertising and to find other evidences of the professionalization of the medium; b) conducting a participant observation in the I Digital and Social Media Forum (FMDS) and in the BlogCamp Paraná...|$|R
40|$|Conservative Christian {{organizations}} are gradually gaining more political influence in democratic societies, {{such as the}} United States. Conservative Christian values are not always in tune with contemporary western values towards equality and gendered hierarchies. These conflicting values, of conservative Christian movements and feminists {{are the subject of}} this thesis. 	In preparation for this paper I researched the construction of gender sensitive concepts, namely the traditional family, fatherhood and motherhood {{within the context of the}} Christian Coalition of America. The Christian Coalition is a Christian Right Movement and is widely viewed as a conservative organization. Thus, with the foregoing in mind, the research question of this thesis is: How does the discourse of the Christian Coalition construct the ‘ideal’ traditional family and what does this mean for the construction of fatherhood and motherhood? 	Motherhood is an established and powerful concept within feminist discourse, however fatherhood is comparatively speaking discursively less prominent. This does not mean that fatherhood has not an important place in the construction of the traditional family. Therefore, I have chosen to research both concepts within the context of ‘traditional’ family structures. The Christian Coalition has fixed ideas regarding how the family, fatherhood and motherhood are defined and this is reflected in their <b>promotional</b> material, in <b>blogs</b> that support their ideas and in articles that appear on their own website. Analysis of this literature forms the basis of my research, looking specifically at ways in which the Christian Coalition and its own agendas create specific concepts of the family, motherhood and fatherhood. The feminist discourse that is researched is not compatible with the discourse of the Christian Coalition. Feminists view the same concepts in a different light. For them marriage, fatherhood and motherhood are not about hierarchy, but about equality. 	 A pivotal aim is to make clear precisely how these concepts are both defined and created and then subsequently used to present members of the organization with powerful, stereotypical views both of what the family, fatherhood and motherhood are, and more importantly, are not. 	The aim of this thesis is to contribute to the discussion between feminists and conservative Christian movements. It is important that feminists have a more educated and nuanced understanding of these movements, in order to engage in discussions about gender equality with, rather than against, the members of conservative organizations...|$|R
40|$|Purpose of {{the study}} This {{bachelor}} thesis aims to map the landscape of Estonian corporate blogs. It focuses mainly on the following topics: the effectiveness of (corporate) blogs in public relations and {{their role in the}} society at large, the potential and purposes of blogging, the definitions and categorizing of (corporate) blogs, good and bad practices. The main research questions were as follows: What is the current situation in the Estonian corporate blogosphere? If and what kind of enterprises should and should not blog? What is the potential and purpose of (corporate) blogging? What is the role of blogs in the yesterday, today and tomorrow of the Estonian corporate- and infotechnological realm? Keywords: corporate blogging, blogging definition, blogging typology, Information society, public sphere, public relations, effectiveness, potential and purpose of blogs Nature {{of the study}} The nature of this research is mainly question-asking and situation-mapping, it is an introduction to, hopefully many future studies on the topic. As for now, the bachelor thesis claims to offer an insight to the field of Estonian business blogs, discuss different viewpoints and questions that could be important in context of the topic (further on). Method The empirical methods used were mapping and expert interviews. The selection of 35 corporate blogs were mapped during January and March-April, 2007 using the search engines of www. neti. ee, www. google. ee, www. blog. ee, www. blog. tr. ee and www. ajaveeb. ee. The search words were „blog”, „corporate blog”, „business blog”, „group blog” and the names of different enterprises. Virtually all topic catalogues of neti. ee were scanned through (e. g. media, banking, tourism, catering, technology, ministries). Blogs were also found through personal recommendations and tips. The blogs are mapped by their author(s), content, purpose, extent and pattern. Yet the main value of the thesis lies in the expert interviews. Three experts, gurus of the field were interviewed: the chief editor of the technology magazine [Digi] – Henrik Roonemaa, the founder and CEO of the internet marketing enterprise Altex – Robin Gurney and the „Technokratt” and media hacker, schooler and thinker – Peeter Marvet. Key findings: the mapping The main results were: blogs are not very accessible, companies do not introduce or define their blogs (why and for whom are they blogging?), much visual and systematic confusion occurs (who is blogging, how can I get back to main website?), there is still little CEO blogs and all-employee blogs, rather groups (of experts) than individuals, blog. Thankfully, the <b>promotional</b> <b>blog</b> is not very widely spread in Estonia (for now) and personal topics are preferred. Key findings: the interviews The company planning to start blogging should first think through what do they want to achieve, can it be done by blogging, what is the time-cost benefit, what are the alternatives, do they have a good blogger, what do they have to say and who should care? The purpose of blogging is to reach the win-win solution of a mixed-motive communication (satisfy the company’s needs while trying to help our publics to satisfy theirs). Blogosphere, as such, is a complex term and according to the interviewees, a corporate blogosphere, as such, does not exist (in Estonia). The interviewees did also not believe in the power of blogs to create community. They agreed that blogging can be an effective PR-tool, when used properly, when used badly (a „dead” blog, uninteresting content, not dealing with the comments), it could be devastating to the company. In the future visions, Marvet sees that the information is starting to drift pass media (post advertising media). Roonemaa is also convinced that the importance of the Web in our everyday and business lives continues to rise. Gurney knows already today that the markets are conversations...|$|E
