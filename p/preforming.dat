Such heating is further complicated when internal air-structures are introduced into the preform- such as in Microstructured Polymer Optical Fibre (MPOF) <b>preforms.</b> The aim of this study was thus to investigate heat transfer in an MPOF <b>preform.</b> The effect of air-structure was studied using both numerical heat transfer simulations and <b>preform</b> heating experiments. A two-dimensional conductive heat transfer model with surface radiation was used in simulating the transient heat transfer in MPOF <b>preforms</b> with the results compared to those for a solid <b>preform.</b> It was found that relatively long heating times were required to reach a uniform temperature distribution within a <b>preform,</b> and that depending on the <b>preform’s</b> air fraction its centre could heat up either faster or slower than a solid <b>preform.</b> Experimental tests where both a solid and an air-structured <b>preform</b> were heated in a drawing furnace with internal temperatures measured across the <b>preform,</b> confirmed the findings from the numerical simulations. ...|$|R
