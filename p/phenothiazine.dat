Examples of plants producing Type I Photosensitivity include Buckwheat and St John's wort (Hypericum perforatum). Certain drugs such as <b>phenothiazine</b> or its derivatives may also lead to photosensitivity reactions, commonly in sheep. <b>Phenothiazine</b> is converted by the body into the photodynamic compound <b>phenothiazine</b> sulfoxide.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to his epidemiological research, Gordon also researched and published extensively {{on the use of}} various anthelmintics in sheep. He was responsible for the discovery in the late 1930s of <b>phenothiazine,</b> a safe and effective anthelmintic. His research showed that this compound could effectively control intestinal parasites in sheep and cattle. This discovery, and local production of the required chemicals, resulted in a massive cut in the economic losses suffered by farmers due to intestinal parasitism. <b>Phenothiazine</b> was the mainstay of internal parasite control in sheep in Australia until the 1960s, when broad-spectrum anthelmintics became available.|$|E

In certain cases, elderly patients' previous interactions with <b>phenothiazine</b> derivatives or pre-existing neuroleptic treatment may have had some contribution towards dyskinesia at the administration of hydroxyzine due to hypersensitivity caused due to the prolonged treatment, and therefore some contraindication is given to the short-term administration of hydroxyzine to those with previous <b>phenothiazine</b> use.|$|E

40|$|A rapid {{screening}} method {{was developed for}} the determination of <b>phenothiazines</b> by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF-MS). In this method, α-cyano- 4 -hydroxy cinnamic acid (CHCA) {{was used as the}} matrix to assist the ionization of <b>phenothiazines.</b> The identification of 11 <b>phenothiazines</b> with heavy side chains was performed by their protonated molecular ions [M + H]+ at m/z = 340 – 447, and the quantification was achieved using triflupromazine at m/z = 353 as the internal standard (IS). The relative ionization efficiencies of 11 <b>phenothiazines</b> and IS on MALDI-TOF-MS were different from those on ESI-TSQ-MS, but the product ion spectra on MALDI-MS-MS were quite similar to those on ESI-MS-MS except in the case of flupentixol. The limit of detection was 0. 3 ng/ml with its quantification range of 1 – 50 ng/ml urine in the best case, and limit of detection was 5 ng/ml with its quantification range of 10 – 100 ng/ml urine in the worst case for 10 <b>phenothiazines</b> except thiethylperazine.

25|$|Levomepromazine (INN, BAN, USAN), {{also known}} as methotrimeprazine, is a <b>phenothiazine</b> {{neuroleptic}} drug. It is sold in many countries under the generic name (levomepromazine) or under brand names such as Nozinan, Levoprome, Detenler, Hirnamin, Levotomin, Neurocil and many more.

25|$|In {{addition}} to influencing the neurotransmitters dopamine, serotonin, epinephrine, norepinephrine, and acetylcholine {{it has been}} reported that antipsychotic drugs could achieve glutamanergic effects. This mechanism involves direct effects on antipsychotic drugs on glutamate receptors. By using the technique of functional neurochemical assay chlorpromazine and <b>phenothiazine</b> derivatives have been shown to have inhibitory effects on NMDA receptors that appeared to be mediated by action at the Zn site. It was found that there is an increase of NMDA activity at low concentrations and suppression at high concentrations of the drug. No significant difference in glutamate and glycine activity from the effects of chlorpromazine were reported. Further work will be necessary to determine if the influence in NMDA receptors by antipsychotic drugs contributes to their effectiveness.|$|E
500|$|Particular {{attention}} has been paid to the function of dopamine in the mesolimbic pathway of the brain. This focus largely resulted from the accidental finding that <b>phenothiazine</b> drugs, which block dopamine function, could reduce psychotic symptoms. It is also supported by the fact that amphetamines, which trigger the release of dopamine, may exacerbate the psychotic symptoms in schizophrenia. The influential dopamine hypothesis of schizophrenia proposed that excessive activation of D2 receptors was the cause of (the positive symptoms of) schizophrenia. Although postulated for about 20years based on the D2 blockade effect common to all antipsychotics, it was not until the mid-1990s that PET and SPET imaging studies provided supporting evidence. While dopamine D2/D3 receptors are elevated in schizophrenia, the effect size is small, and only evident in medication naive schizophrenics. On the other hand, presynaptic dopamine metabolism and released is elevated despite no difference in dopamine transporter. The altered synthesis of dopamine in the nigrostriatal system have been confirmed in several human studies. Hypoactivity of dopamine D1 receptor activation in the prefrontal cortex has also been observed. [...] The hyperactivity of D2 receptor stimulation and relative hypoactivity of D1 receptor stimulation is thought to contribute to cognitive dysfunction by disrupting signal to noise ratio in cortical microcircuits. [...] The dopamine hypothesis is now thought to be simplistic, partly because newer antipsychotic medication (atypical antipsychotic medication) can be just as effective as older medication (typical antipsychotic medication), but also affects serotonin function and may have slightly less of a dopamine blocking effect.|$|E

2500|$|... out a basic {{understanding}} of the nervous system and how nerves communicate between one another. Before this discovery, there were drugs that had been found that demonstrated some type of influence on the nervous system. In the 1930s, French scientists began working with a compound called <b>phenothiazine</b> in the hope of synthesizing a drug that would be able to combat malaria. Though this drug showed very little hope in the use against malaria-infected individuals, it was found to have sedative effects along with what appeared to be beneficial effects toward patients with Parkinson’s disease. This black box method, wherein an investigator would administer a drug and examine the response without knowing how to relate drug action to patient response, was the main approach to this field, until, in the late 1940s and early 1950s, scientists were able to identify specific neurotransmitters, such as norepinephrine (involved in the constriction of blood vessels and the increase in heart rate and blood pressure), dopamine (the chemical whose shortage is involved in Parkinson’s disease), and serotonin (soon to be recognized as deeply connected to depression). In the 1950s, scientists also became better able to measure levels of specific neurochemicals in the body and thus correlate these levels with behavior. The invention of the voltage clamp in 1949 allowed for the study of ion channels and the nerve action potential. These two major historical events in neuropharmacology allowed scientists not only to study how information is transferred from one neuron to another but also to study how a neuron processes this information within itself.|$|E
2500|$|In 1933, the French {{pharmaceutical}} company Laboratoires Rhône-Poulenc began {{to search for}} new anti-histamines. [...] In 1947, it synthesized promethazine, a <b>phenothiazine</b> derivative, which {{was found to have}} more pronounced sedative and antihistaminic effects than earlier drugs. A year later, the French surgeon Pierre Huguenard used promethazine together with pethidine as part of a cocktail to induce relaxation and indifference in surgical patients. Another surgeon, Henri Laborit, believed the compound stabilized the central nervous system by causing [...] "artificial hibernation", and described this state as [...] "sedation without narcosis". He suggested to Rhône-Poulenc that they develop a compound with better stabilizing properties. In December 1950, the chemist Paul Charpentier produced a series of compounds that included RP4560 or chlorpromazine. Simone Courvoisier conducted behavioural tests and found chlorpromazine produced indifference to aversive stimuli in rats. Chlorpromazine was distributed for testing to physicians between April and August 1951. Laborit trialled the medicine on at the Val-de-Grâce military hospital in Paris, using it as an anaesthetic booster in intravenous doses of 50 to 100mg on surgery patients and confirming it as the best drug to date in calming and reducing shock, with patients reporting improved well being afterwards. He also noted its hypothermic effect and suggested it may induce artificial hibernation. Laborit thought this would allow the body to better tolerate major surgery by reducing shock, a novel idea at the time. Known colloquially as [...] "Laborit's drug", chlorpromazine was released onto the market in 1953 by Rhône-Poulenc and given the trade name Largactil, derived from large [...] "broad" [...] and acti* [...] "activity.|$|E
