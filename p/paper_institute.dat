50|$|The American <b>Paper</b> <b>Institute</b> {{originally}} promoted {{four different}} variants of the recycling symbol for different purposes. The plain Möbius loop, either white with an outline or solid black, {{was to be}} used to indicate that a product was recyclable. The other two variants had the Möbius loop inside a circle—either white on black or black on white—and were meant for products made of recycled materials, with the white-on-black version to be used for 100% recycled fiber, and the black-on-white version for products containing both recycled and unrecycled fiber. For example, a paper envelope might have both the first and last of these four symbols, to indicate that it was recyclable, and made from both recycled and unrecycled fibers.|$|E

50|$|Initially {{conceived}} {{as part of}} an ambitious project to quantify non-tariff trade barriers (NTBs) spearheaded by the National Association of Manufacturers (NAM)’s International Economic Affairs (IEA) department led by Nicholas E. Hollis, vice president and manager,ICTN evolved from a coalition of twenty five industrial trade associations, representing such diverse sectors as the American <b>Paper</b> <b>Institute,</b> the Farm and Industrial Equipment Institute, the Computer and Business Equipment Manufacturers Association, the General Aviation Manufacturers, National Electrical Manufacturers Association and many others, which supported the NAM’s study approach for NTBs. The association coalition emerged from a series of conferences organized by Hollis in 1972 under the chairmanship of Samuel E. MacArthur, {{chairman and chief executive of}} Federal-Mogul Corporation- a ball bearing manufacturing company headquartered near Detroit. The project momentum accelerated after a presentation at the Homestead before more than 100 NAM directors - many of them chief executives of major corporations. The project evolved into a formalized task force of the IEA and a separate trade association group which became known as the Inter-Association Trade Group (IATG) in 1975.|$|E
