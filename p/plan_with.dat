40|$|The {{interleaving}} of <b>planning</b> <b>with</b> execution {{is a basic}} {{approach to}} <b>planning</b> <b>with</b> incomplete information. This paper investigates {{the use of this}} approach in stationary environments. We first define a computational framework where this approach can be investigated. We then show how the interleaving of <b>planning</b> <b>with</b> execution can be used for reducing <b>planning</b> <b>with</b> incomplete information to <b>planning</b> <b>with</b> complete information and constraint satisfaction. In addition, we show a restriction on our model where this reduction yields a polynomial procedure for <b>planning</b> <b>with</b> incomplete information. Finally, we discuss belief-based conditional planning; an approach which bridges part of the gap between planning while executing and general conditional planning. 1 Introduction Consider a robot in a maze. The robot is initially located in the entrance point of the maze, while its objective is to reach the exit point. The robot can move along the walls of the maze and can assume its movements won' [...] ...|$|R
40|$|The {{planning}} women (N = 199) {{do during}} pregnancy for {{their return to}} work post birth and {{the factors that influence}} employment planning during late pregnancy were investigated in this study. The findings revealed three components of planning: Planning for Childcare, <b>Planning</b> <b>with</b> Partner, and <b>Planning</b> <b>with</b> Employer. Several factors emerged as consistent cross-sectional predictors of these components (work satisfaction, hours worked before commencing maternity leave, anticipated weeks of maternity leave and anticipated hours per week on the return to work). Anticipated support from family and friends, and from the workplace also predicted <b>Planning</b> <b>with</b> Partner and <b>Planning</b> <b>with</b> Employer, respectively.

40|$|SummaryAimTo analyse (quantitatively-statistically) {{conformity}} indices {{calculated for}} stereotactic radiosurgery treatment <b>plans</b> <b>with</b> {{one and two}} isocentres in cases of brain tumour. Materials/MethodsA retrospective study of 33 patients with brain tumours treated between April 2005 and January 2006 was performed in the Radiotherapy Department of the Oncology Centre in Łódź. Stereotactic surgery was performed in all patients. All treatment plans {{were divided into two}} groups: <b>plans</b> <b>with</b> one isocentre and <b>plans</b> <b>with</b> two isocentres. For each treatment plan various kinds of conformity parameters were calculated and optimal prescription isodose level was determined. ResultsAll conformity indices are within ranges and were accepted. Their values are lower in <b>plans</b> <b>with</b> two isocentres in comparison to <b>plans</b> <b>with</b> one isocentre. ConclusionsConformity indices are very helpful in the analysis of treatment plans, but they do not give real insight into all aspects of plans. Prescription isodose should completely enclose PTV volume. Optimal prescription isodose does not cover PTV; thus from a clinical point of view it is inapplicable...|$|R
5|$|Early in his reign, {{there were}} plans {{regarding}} {{a marriage of}} Władysław and Princess Elisabeth of Bohemia, Princess Palatine (daughter of Frederick V, Elector Palatine).

5|$|In {{preparation}} for the 1944 invasion of Normandy, the Allied nations conducted a complex series of deceptions under the codename Bodyguard.

With public sentiment tending towards environmentalism, Parks Canada issued major new policy in 1979, which emphasized conservation.

The act also required each park to produce a management <b>plan,</b> <b>with</b> greater public participation.|$|E

It consisted of tiled reinforced concrete base and pillars, and was modelled after previous piers in the area. Its flat roof was also made of concrete, topped with bitumen waterproofing.

It has a seven-bay east/west <b>plan</b> <b>with</b> central entrances and three bays north/south, topped by a fully glazed ironwork hipped-roof. An entablature with protruding horizontal geison sits above Ionic half-column supports and corner pilasters. The centre entrance bay on the west front towards the kitchen garden breaks forward as a portico, with pairs of giant engaged columns and broken pediment with a small oculus. Between each pair of columns are large round-headed windows with Gibbs surrounds and keystones.|$|E
5|$|Construction {{started in}} June 2017 to extend Tonkin Highway north, past Ellenbrook {{and through the}} Swan Valley to Brand Highway and Great Northern Highway in Muchea. Interchanges are planned at {{junctions}} with Reid Highway, Hepburn Avenue and Beechboro Road North, Gnangara Road, The Promenade, Stock Road, Neaves road and Brand Highway and Great Northern Highway. The 3rd stage was originally planned to be a 2 lane single-carriageway road with at-grade intersections, with provision for upgrading in the future, but in the end, {{it was decided that}} the ultimate <b>plan</b> <b>with</b> a 4 lane dual-carriageway was to go ahead.

5|$|During the English {{occupation}} of Scotland under the Commonwealth, fortresses {{in the style}} of the trace italienne were built. These were polygonal in <b>plan</b> <b>with</b> triangular bastions, as at Ayr, Inverness and Leith. Twenty smaller forts were built as far away as Orkney and Stornoway. Control of the Highlands was secured by strongpoints at Inverlocky and Inverness. These were built at a massive cost in money and manpower. The citadel at Inverness, begun in 1652 and using stone shipped from as far away as Aberdeen, had cost £50,0000 when it was still unfinished by 1655. Inverlochy had a garrison of 1,000 and from 1654 became the centre for a new administrative region of Lochaber, made up of three of the most remote and lawless shires.|$|E
