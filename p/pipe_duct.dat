50|$|Thermal {{insulation}} and acoustic insulation are installed on piping and mechanical systems to achieve {{one or more}} of the following; energy savings, personnel protection, process control, condensation control, noise reduction and reduction of greenhouse gas emissions. Mechanical systems include piping, boilers, HVAC systems, and ducts.Mechanical insulation is commonly installed in industrial and commercial facilities. Industrial facilities are not open to the public and include power plants, oil refineries, manufacturing buildings, storage buildings, paper mills, pharmaceuticals, chemical plants, food processing plants, waste water and water treatment plants, petrochemical, auto manufacturing, and plastics manufacturing. In an industrial facility, insulation is required for systems that carry or store liquid, gas, air, or product in which the temperature of the substance being transferred or stored is impacted by the temperature of the ambient air. These systems must be insulated to maintain process temperatures for both cold and hot systems; to protect liquids from freezing; to provide burn protection for personnel from possible exposure to hot systems; and for sound attenuation.Commercial buildings include any facility that accepts the public or is used by a company for employees in a non-industrial or manufacturing setting. Mechanical insulation represents 1 to 2 percent of the total cost for a new commercial facility. Commercial facilities include office buildings, schools, restaurants, hospitals, hotels, casinos, sports arenas, libraries, and dormitories. Systems that often require insulation in commercial buildings include all HVAC systems; <b>pipe,</b> <b>duct,</b> and equipment; hot and cold domestic plumbing pipe and equipment; roof drain pipe; emergency generator exhaust systems; and kitchen hood exhaust ductwork.|$|E

40|$|The {{volatile}} {{transition from}} quiescent laminar to strongly fluctuating turbulent dynamics in shear flows remains only poorly understood despite its practical importance {{and more than}} a century of intense research. The theoretical understanding of the transition process has been complicated by the lack of a linear instability mechanism and additionally by a catastrophic collapse of turbulence which can occur after extremely long lifetimes. Turbulence close to onset is investigated experimentally in three different geometries: <b>pipe,</b> <b>duct</b> and channel flow. The reverse transition from turbulent to laminar flow is observed to be a general feature of shear flows. A critical point is uncovered at slightly higher flow rates, where the nature of the flow changes abruptly to the generic case of expanding turbulence. The critical exponent associated with this phase transition is found to be universal. This confirms a conjecture made over 20 years ago based on an analogy between fluid turbulence and discrete models in statistical physics.

40|$|This {{report is}} to present the {{progress}} made on the project entitled ''Establishment of an Environmental Control Technology Laboratory (ECTL) with a Circulating Fluidized-Bed Combustion (CFBC) System'' during the period January 1, 2007 through March 31, 2007. The effort in this quarter has concentrated on installing the CFBC Facility and for conducting cold fluidization operations tests in the CFBC facility. The assembly of the ash recirculation <b>pipe</b> <b>duct</b> from the cyclones back to the bed area of the combustor, including {{the upper and lower}} loop seals was completed. The electric bed pre-heater was installed to heat the fluidizing air as it enters the wind box. The induced draft fan along with its machine base and power supply was received and installed. The flue gas duct from secondary cyclone outlet to induced draft fan inlet was received and installed, as well as the induced fan flue gas discharge duct. Pressure testing from the forced draft fan to the outlet of the induced fan was completed. In related research a pilot-scale halogen addition test was conducted in the empty slipstream reactor (without (Selective Catalytic Reduction) SCR catalyst loading) and the SCR slipstream reactor with two commercial SCR catalysts. The greatest benefits of conducting slipstream tests can be flexible control and isolation of specific factors. This facility is currently used in full-scale utility and will be combined into 0. 6 MW CFBC in the future. This work attempts to first investigate performance of the SCR catalyst in the flue gas atmosphere when burning Powder River Basin (PRB), including the impact of PRB coal flue gas composition on the reduction of nitrogen oxides (NOx) and the oxidation of elemental mercury (Hg(0)) under SCR conditions. Secondly, the impacts of hydrogen halogens (Hydrogen fluoride (HF), Hydrogen chloride (HCl), Hydrogen Bromide (HBr) and Hydrogen Iodine (HI)) on Hg(0) oxidation and their mechanisms can be explored...|$|E

40|$|International audienceThis work {{deals with}} the {{building}} of a discrete model able to describe and to predict the evolution of complex gas flows in heterogeneous media. In many physical applications, large scales numerical simulation is no longer possible {{because of a lack of}} computing resources. Indeed the medium topology may be complex due to the presence of many obstacles (walls, pipes, equipments, geometric singularities etc.). Aircraft powerplant compartments are examples where topology is complex due to the presence of <b>pipes,</b> <b>ducts,</b> coolers and other equipment. Other important examples are gas explosions and large scale dispersion of hazardous materials in urban places, cities or underground involving obstacles such as buildings and various infrastructures. In all cases efficient safety responses are required. Then a new discrete model is built and solved in reasonable execution times for large cells volumes including such obstacles. Quantitative comparisons between experimental and numerical results are shown for different significant test cases, showing excellent agreement. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved...|$|R
