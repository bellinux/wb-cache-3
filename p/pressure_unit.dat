5000|$|This example {{demonstrates}} {{why there}} is some confusion surrounding pressure head {{and its relationship to}} pressure.

5000|$|The {{crew was}} awakened at 11:53 pm {{for the start}} of Flight Day Five activities. The middeck {{payloads}} took center stage as the STS-62 crew worked through the second half of its fifth day on orbit. Allen and Gemar took turns in the Lower Body Negative <b>Pressure</b> <b>Unit,</b> each turn lasting an hour and 45 minutes. The sack-like device sealed at the waist so that pressure around the lower body could be gradually decreased. The lowered pressure drew body fluids down to the legs and lower torso, similar to the body's normal state on Earth. The LBNP protocol underwent testing as a countermeasure to a condition known as [...] "orthostatic intolerance", in which a person feels lightheaded after standing. Some astronauts experienced such sensations upon standing after shuttle landings. Allen and Gemar also performed a 45-minute ramp test, but at the direction of ground controllers, terminated the test 40 seconds early. Casper, Thuot and Ivins relaxed on board Columbia {{for the first half of}} the day.|$|E
40|$|A {{combined}} geometry plasto-hydrodynamic <b>pressure</b> <b>unit</b> {{has been}} investigated theoretically and experimentally. Previous investigators have used either stepped parallel or tapered bore <b>pressure</b> <b>unit</b> for die-less drawing and/or coating of wires, tubes and stripes. In the present study a combined parallel and tapered bore unit {{has been used in}} conjunction with polymer melts as pressure fluid. In this present work a <b>pressure</b> <b>unit</b> is heated to convert the polymer feed into a viscous melt and the pressure in the fluid is generated by hydrodynamic action when a wire is drawn through it. Experimental work has been carried out on different pressure units with similar external but different internal geometries to investigate the performance of new <b>pressure</b> <b>unit.</b> Different types of polymer were used as the pressure medium. In this work analytical models based on Newtonian and pseudo-Newtonian characteristics have been developed to investigate the performance of the <b>pressure</b> <b>unit</b> and to optimise the process. The predicted results showed reasonable agreement those observed experimentally in magnitudes of maximum pressure. Experimental and theoretical results, showed that there exists a gap ratio (optimum) for which the pressure is maximum. For greater or smaller values of the gap ratio than the optimum value, a decreased magnitude for the maximum pressure was obtained. The maximum pressure at that gap ratio(optimum) is much higher compared to those obtained using either stepped or tapered bore <b>pressure</b> <b>unit</b> at similar conditions...|$|E

40|$|An {{experimental}} protocol to harmonize {{the pressure and}} temperature-histories of model samples treated in different individual high <b>pressure</b> pilot <b>units</b> was developed. This protocol {{was based on the}} endpoint strategy. Step zero of this protocol consisted of an exploratory measurement of the pressure, temperature-history of the pressure transmitting medium in the different chambers without the use of a container. In steps one and two of the protocol, the temperature of a sample was measured, which was placed in a container. Two types of samples were considered, a pure water sample allowing free convection (step 1) and a viscous water-based system (using a water soluble thickener) preventing free convection in the sample container (step 2). The high <b>pressure</b> <b>units</b> differed primarily in pressure build-up and pressure release times. The suggested endpoint strategy enabled the minimization of differences in temperature-histories during the pressure holding phase. Pressure, temperature-histories measured in the different high <b>pressure</b> <b>units</b> and information on the inactivation kinetics of a-amylase based systems were used to compare the process impact of different pressure, temperature-histories on the enzyme inactivation. The differences in temperature-histories significantly influenced the degree of enzyme inactivation; in particular the temperature-histories during the pressure build-up phase substantially contributed to differences in residual enzyme activity...|$|R
