He only makes a $2 profit (minus fees), no matter how high the share price goes. <b>For</b> example, if <b>the</b> stock price goes up to $11, the buyer of the call will exercise the option and the investor will sell the shares that he bought at $5 for $11, for a $6 profit, but must then pay out $11 - $7 = $4, making his profit only $2 ($6 − $4). <b>The</b> <b>premium</b> paid <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>put</b> must then be subtracted from this $2 profit to calculate the total return on this investment.|$|R
