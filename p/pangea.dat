5|$|Several {{theories}} {{have been proposed}} about the biogeography of the spinosaurids. Since Suchomimus was {{more closely related to}} Baryonyx (from Europe) than to Spinosaurus—although that genus also lived in Africa—the distribution of spinosaurids cannot be explained as vicariance resulting from continental rifting. Sereno et al. proposed that spinosaurids were initially distributed across the supercontinent <b>Pangea,</b> but split {{with the opening of the}} Tethys Sea. Spinosaurines would then have evolved in the south (Africa and South America: in Gondwanaland) and baryonychines in the north (Europe: in Laurasia), with Suchomimus the result of a single north-to-south dispersal event. It has also been suggested that baryonychines could be the ancestors of spinosaurines, which appear to have replaced the former in Africa. In 2006, it was demonstrated that Iberia was near northern Africa during the Early Cretaceous; some researchers have argued that the Iberian region was a stepping stone between Europe and Africa, which is supported by the presence of baryonychines in Iberia. The direction of the dispersal between Europe and Africa is still unknown, and subsequent discoveries of spinosaurid remains in Asia and Australia indicate that it may have been complex.|$|E

5000|$|The {{creation}} of the sandstone seen exposed at Bilger's Rocks was during the Carboniferous Period that lasted from 354 to 290 million years ago.

These rocks were once covered by softer rocks (i.e. limestone & shale) that have been eroded away. In the vicinity of Bilger's Rocks the remaining sandstone bed measures over 50 ft thick and is broken up over hundreds of yards.

40|$|We {{generate}} a detailed ∼ 30 Myr record of pCO 2 spanning {{most of the}} Late Triassic (Carnian-Norian-Rhaetian) to earliest Jurassic (Hettangian), based on stable carbon isotope ratios of soil carbonate and preserved organic matter from paleosols in the eastern North American Newark rift basin. Atmospheric pCO 2 was near 4500 ppm in the late Carnian, decreasing to below ∼ 2000 ppm by the late Rhaetian just before the earliest Jurassic eruption of the Central Atlantic Magmatic Province, which triggered measurable pulses of CO 2 outgassing. These data are consistent with published modeling results using the GEOCLIM model, which predict a decrease in pCO 2 over the Late Triassic {{as a result of}} the progressive increase in continental area subject to the intense weathering regime of the tropical humid belt due to <b>Pangea’s</b> northward motion. The finer-scale pCO 2 changes we observe may be dependent on the lithology introduced to the tropics, such as the dip to ∼ 2000 ppm around 212 Ma and its rebound to ∼ 4000 ppm at 209 Ma, which can be accomplished by introducing a more weatherable subaerial basaltic terrain. These observations indicate that the consumption of CO 2 by continental silicate weathering can force long-term changes in pCO 2 comparable to those driven by presumed changes in mantle degassing...|$|R
40|$|The Sibiel Shear Zone is a 1 - 3 km wide, ductile {{shear zone}} {{located in the}} South Carpathian Mountains, Romania. In the Rsinari area, the ductile shear zone juxtaposes {{amphibolite}} facies rocks of the Lotru Metamorphic Suite against greenschist facies rocks of the Rauorul Cisndioarei Formation. The first represents the eroded remnants of Peri-Gondwanan arcs formed between the Neoproterozoic-Silurian (650 - 430 Ma), regionally metamorphosed to amphibolite facies during the Variscan orogeny (350 - 320 Ma). The second is composed of metasedimentary and metavolcanic Neoproterozoic-Ordovician (700 - 497 Ma) assemblages of mafic to intermediate bulk composition also resembling an island arc metamorphosed during the Ordovician (prior to similar to 463 Ma). Between these lie the epidote amphibolite facies mylonitic and ultramylonitic rocks of the Sibisel Formation, a tectonic melange dominated by mafic actinolite schists attenuated into a high strain ductile shear zone. Mineral Rb-Sr isochrons document the time of juxtaposition of the three domains during the Permian to Early Triassic (similar to 290 - 240 Ma). Ductile shear sense indicators suggest a right lateral transpressive mechanism of juxtaposition; the Sibiel shear zone is a remnant Permo-Triassic suture between two Early Paleozoic Gondwanan terranes. A zircon and apatite U-Th/He age transect across the shear zone yields Alpine ages (54 - 90 Ma apatite and 98 - 122 Ma zircon); these data demonstrate that the exposed rocks were not subjected to Alpine ductile deformation. Our results have significant implications for the assembly of Gondwanan terranes and their docking to Baltica during <b>Pangea's</b> formation. Arc terranes free of Variscan metamorphism existed until the Early Triassic, emphasizing the complex tectonics of terrane amalgamation during the closure of Paleotethys...|$|R
40|$|The Variscan orogeny in the Cantabria–Asturias Arc (CAA) of {{northern}} Spain represents a multiphase deformation history associated with <b>Pangea’s</b> amalgamation. To determine {{the timing and}} kinematic history of deformation, a paleomagnetic investigation was carried out on Devonian limestones in three structural domains of the CAA’s hinge zone. Two characteristic remagnetizations in the CAA are distinguished: an Early Permian (B) component that postdates initial Westphalian–Stephanian aged folding (F 1 and F 2), and a Late Carboniferous (C) component that postdates F 1 deformation. Both the B and C magnetizations experienced a later F 3 folding phase. The kinematics and geometry of post-magnetization deformation are determined by bringing measured magnetic directions into agreement with reference directions. These structural corrections also allow separation of deformation events in time. We conclude that generally east–west-trending, but variably plunging, fold axes characterize F 3 folding in the hinge zone of the CAA. This post-magnetization deformation involved significant amounts of tilting and (sub) vertical axis rotation, which together produced clockwise rotation {{in the north of}} the arc and counterclockwise rotation in the south of the arc, to form the horseshoe-shaped orocline that is observed today. F 3 fold axes change from near-vertical to moderately inclined between and within structural domains, due to the structural fabric imposed by F 1 and F 2. Based on calculated F 3 fold properties, we can reconstruct pre-existing F 1 and F 2 structural geometries of the hinge zones. This analysis shows that F 1 and F 2 structures are the result of Late Carboniferous deformation, as part of the same east–west but temporally discrete compression regimes. On the other hand, F 3 is controlled by Permian, north–sout...|$|R

40|$|As {{our best}} {{opportunity}} to study the anatomy of an icehouse period from onset to demise, the Late Paleozoic Ice Age has been a popular subject in recent years. Studies have investigated the imprint of different scales of Pennsylvanian climate change on glacial, tropical, carbonate, and alluvial records, but overlooked subtropical, arid records. This bias results from our poor understanding of marine erg-margin systems and their stratigraphic architecture. The Wyoming Shelf preserves a mixed siliciclastic-carbonate series deposited in the Pennsylvanian subtropics (Amsden and Tensleep Formation). To explore whether this succession recorded different scales of climate and sea-level changes, this series was investigated {{using a combination of}} surface exposure descriptions, petrography, isotope geochemistry, and subsurface data. ^ The long-term (30 Myrs) climatic signal is strongly controlled by <b>Pangea’s</b> northward motion through climate belts. Shorter-term deviations from this arid to humid, then humid to arid trend can be explained by superimposed changes in climate. The Ranchester Limestone Member (RLM) and the Tensleep Formation, deposited in arid coastal settings during high-frequency sea-level fluctuations, make for an outstanding analog to improve the sequence stratigraphic frameworks of marine erg-margins. Lateral changes in the preservation of thick (3 ̆e 10 m) eolian sandstones in the upper Tensleep Formation are explained by the rejuvenation of a basement lineament, whose seismicity is the preferred trigger for fluidized sand injection through planar fractures in dolomite intervals. ^ The RLM contains an unconformity evidenced from petrographic, biostratigraphic, and geochemical data. The basal RLM (middle Bashkirian) is characterized by negative δ 13 C values (- 3. 6 to - 1. 8 ‰; avg. = - 2. 9 ‰). Similar facies in the upper RLM and Tensleep Formation (middle to late Moscovian) have higher δ 13 C values (- 2. 5 to 1. 7 ‰; avg. = - 0. 2 ‰). Lower values suggest interaction with meteoric waters. The hypothesis of a prolonged exposure of the shelf during the early Moscovian coincides with prolonged periods of relative sea-level lowstands in other paleotropical records, suggesting a potential link with a glacial epoch. These insights will aid in future studies on the significance of subtropical, mixed successions, and further our understanding of the low-latitude response to sea-level and climatic changes during the Phanerozoic’s longest icehouse period. ...|$|R

25|$|The {{break-up}} of <b>Pangea</b> in the Early Jurassic {{generated a}} sequence of rift basins in northern South America, surrounding the proto-Caribbean.

25|$|The Carboniferous {{was a time}} {{of active}} {{mountain}} building, as the supercontinent <b>Pangea</b> came together. The southern continents remained tied together in the supercontinent Gondwana, which collided with North America-Europe (Laurussia) along the present line of eastern North America. This continental collision resulted in the Hercynian orogeny in Europe, and the Alleghenian orogeny in North America; it also extended the newly uplifted Appalachians southwestward as the Ouachita Mountains. In the same time frame, much of present eastern Eurasian plate welded itself to Europe along the line of the Ural mountains. There were two major oceans in the Carboniferous the Panthalassa and Paleo-Tethys. Other minor oceans were shrinking and eventually closed the Rheic Ocean (closed by the assembly of South and North America), the small, shallow Ural Ocean (which was closed by the collision of Baltica, and Siberia continents, creating the Ural Mountains) and Proto-Tethys Ocean.|$|E
25|$|The family Stangeriaceae (named for Dr. William Stanger, 18111854), {{consisting}} {{of only three}} extant species, {{is thought to be}} of Gondwanan origin, as fossils have been found in Lower Cretaceous deposits in Argentina, dating to 70135mya. The family Zamiaceae is more diverse, with a fossil record extending from the middle Triassic to the Eocene (54200mya) in North and South America, Europe, Australia, and Antarctica, implying the family was present before the break-up of <b>Pangea.</b> The family Cycadaceae is thought to be an early offshoot from other cycads, with fossils from Eocene deposits (3854mya) in Japan, China, and North America, indicating this family originated in Laurasia. Cycas is the only genus in the family and contains 99species, the most of any cycad genus. Molecular data have recently shown Cycas species in Australasia and the east coast of Africa are recent arrivals, suggesting adaptive radiation may have occurred. The current distribution of cycads may be due to radiations from a few ancestral types sequestered on Laurasia and Gondwana, or could be explained by genetic drift following the separation of already evolved genera. Both explanations account for the strict endemism across present continental lines.|$|E
25|$|The {{geological}} {{history of}} Europe traces {{back to the}} formation of the Baltic Shield (Fennoscandia) and the Sarmatian craton, both around 2.25billion years ago, followed by the Volgo–Uralia shield, the three together leading to the East European craton (≈ Baltica) which became a part of the supercontinent Columbia. Around 1.1billion years ago, Baltica and Arctica (as part of the Laurentia block) became joined to Rodinia, later resplitting around 550million years ago to reform as Baltica. Around 440million years ago Euramerica was formed from Baltica and Laurentia; a further joining with Gondwana then leading {{to the formation of}} <b>Pangea.</b> Around 190million years ago, Gondwana and Laurasia split apart due to the widening of the Atlantic Ocean. Finally, and very soon afterwards, Laurasia itself split up again, into Laurentia (North America) and the Eurasian continent. The land connection between the two persisted for a considerable time, via Greenland, leading to interchange of animal species. From around 50million years ago, rising and falling sea levels have determined the actual shape of Europe, and its connections with continents such as Asia. Europe's present shape dates to the late Tertiary period about five million years ago.|$|E
25|$|The {{geological}} {{age of the}} Caribbean Sea {{is estimated}} to be between 160 and 180million years and was formed by a horizontal fracture that split the supercontinent called <b>Pangea</b> in the Mesozoic Era. It is assumed the proto-caribbean basin existed in the Devonian period. In the early Carboniferous movement of Gondwana to the north and its convergence with the Euramerica basin decreased in size. The next stage of the Caribbean Sea's formation began in the Triassic. Powerful rifting {{led to the formation of}} narrow troughs, stretching from modern Newfoundland to the west coast of the Gulf of Mexico which formed siliciclastic sedimentary rocks. In the early Jurassic due to powerful marine transgression, water broke into the present area of the Gulf of Mexico creating a vast shallow pool. The emergence of deep basins in the Caribbean occurred during the Middle Jurassic rifting. The emergence of these basins marked the beginning of the Atlantic Ocean and contributed to the destruction of Pangaea at the end of the late Jurassic. During the Cretaceous the Caribbean acquired the shape close to that seen today. In the early Paleogene due to Marine regression the Caribbean became separated from the Gulf of Mexico and the Atlantic Ocean by the land of Cuba and Haiti. The Caribbean remained like this for most of the Cenozoic until the Holocene when rising water levels of the oceans restored communication with the Atlantic Ocean.|$|E
25|$|The {{sedimentary}} sequence {{drilled in}} the basin starts with the La Quinta Formation, that is found in a widespread area across northern Colombia and Venezuela. The formation of sandstones, basalts, conglomerates and volcanic ash was deposited in a lacustrine depositional environment in a rift basin setting related to the break-up of <b>Pangea</b> and has been dated to the Late Jurassic and earliest Cretaceous, 160 to 140 Ma. The formation is time-equivalent with the Girón Formation of the Eastern Ranges. The Early Cretaceous Río Negro Formation, a unit composed of sandstones, conglomerates and siltstones, is very variable in thickness {{in the basin}} and associated with continental sedimentation on rift shoulders to a post-rift setting. The formation is time-equivalent with the Tibasosa Formation of the Eastern Ranges and the Tambor Formation of the Middle Magdalena Valley. The fossiliferous limestones and shales of the Lagunitas Formation, lower member of the Cogollo Group, contain beds of dolomite and are indicative of a shallow, saline environment. The formation is correlated with the Rosablanca Formation of the Middle Magdalena Valley and western Eastern Ranges and the Tibú Formation of the Maracaibo Basin. The unit is the deepest source rock for the oils in the Cesar-Ranchería Basin. The upper member of the Cogollo Group, the Aguas Blancas Formation, presents a large lateral variability in lithologies. Black biomicrites and fossiliferous limestones are indicative of a middle to outer platform environment, while sandy shales and glauconitic sandstones indicate a shallow marine environment. The variation in lithologies and organic content of this source rock formation is associated with basinal relative sea level changes and the organic-rich strata to the Aptian anoxic event, dated to approximately 120 million years ago.|$|E

500|$|Highly active {{periods of}} {{volcanism}} in {{what are called}} large igneous provinces have produced huge oceanic plateaus and flood basalts in the past. These can comprise hundreds of large eruptions, producing millions of cubic kilometers of lava in total. No large eruptions of flood basalts have occurred in human history, the most recent having occurred over 10 million years ago. [...] They are often associated with breakup of supercontinents such as <b>Pangea</b> in the geologic record, and {{may have contributed to}} a number of mass extinctions. Most large igneous provinces have either not been studied thoroughly enough to establish the size of their component eruptions, or are not preserved well enough to make this possible. Many of the eruptions listed above thus come from just two large igneous provinces: the Paraná and Etendeka traps and the Columbia River Basalt Group. The latter is the most recent large igneous province, and also one of the smallest. A list of large igneous provinces follows to provide some indication of how many large eruptions may be missing from the lists given here.|$|E
500|$|When the rifting of <b>Pangea,</b> due to {{the process}} of plate tectonics, pushed North America away from Europe and Africa and into the Panthalassic Ocean (ancestor to the modern Pacific Ocean), the Pacific Northwest {{was not part of the}} {{continent}}. As the North American continent moved westward, the Farallon Plate subducted under its western margin. As the plate subducted, it carried along island arcs which were accreted to the North American continent, resulting in the creation of the Pacific Northwest between 150 and 90million years ago. The general outline of the Columbia Basin was not complete until between 60 and 40million years ago, but it lay under a large inland sea later subject to uplift. Between 50 and 20million years ago, from the Eocene through the Miocene eras, tremendous volcanic eruptions frequently modified much of the landscape traversed by the Columbia. The lower reaches of the ancestral river passed through a valley near where Mount Hood later arose. Carrying sediments from erosion and erupting volcanoes, it built a [...] thick delta that underlies the foothills on the east side of the Coast Range near Vernonia in northwestern Oregon. Between 17million and 6million years ago, huge outpourings of flood basalt lava covered the Columbia River Plateau and forced the lower Columbia into its present course. The modern Cascade Range began to uplift 5 to 4million years ago. Cutting through the uplifting mountains, the Columbia River significantly deepened the Columbia River Gorge.|$|E
