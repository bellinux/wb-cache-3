Marx's analysis of value was dialectical {{in the sense that}} he thought value phenomena could only be understood dynamically, holistically and relationally, but he did not spell out all the conceptual, quantitative and logical implications of his position with great exactitude. The scholarly debate about those implications continues even today.|$|E

The Medicare institution, including those subsidy arrangements, operates {{in a uniform manner}} across geographical space. From time to time, since the introduction of Medicare on 1 February 1984, ad hoc reviews of the Medicare subsidy arrangements have been undertaken. This empirical study present the first examination of the <b>price</b> <b>relativities</b> of various specialist and general practitioner services that have arisen under Medicare over time, and across geographical space. The empirical work involves estimating and testing time-series relative price equations for ten groups of medical practitioner services, for each state and territory in Australia, on quarterly Health insurance Commission (HC) data. Seventy-two equations are estimated in total, on 49 quarterly observations from September, 1984 to September, 1996. The important conclusions of the work are that price outcomes under Medicare are characterised by spatial non-uniformity, despite the uniformity of the subsidy mechanism. A related conclusion is that institutional reforms to the subsidy arrangements under Medicare may, in some cases, prove blunt instruments if prices and their relativities are the relevant policy targets. The results inform a presently informed medico-legal debate about <b>price</b> <b>relativities</b> in the health sector under Medicare and service to caution the applications of institutional change as a tool for effecting relative price change...|$|E
40|$|In {{a carbon}} {{constrained}} world, transitioning {{some or all}} of the fuel for transport away from fossil fuels to renewable sources of energy will become increasingly important. This dissertation examines the current penetration of first generation biodiesel in the Australian diesel market and identifies the factors that will most influence current and future penetration. The research identifies three critical factors in shaping penetration: <b>price</b> <b>relativity</b> to mineral (regular) diesel, government policy, and the environmental benefits of biodiesel. This dissertation concludes that these factors will be definitive in determining the penetration of biodiesel in the Australian diesel market. Analysis of <b>price</b> <b>relativity</b> shows that mineral diesel is currently cheaper to supply than biodiesel, despite significant subsidisation. Importantly, the research also shows that biodiesel is likely to remain more expensive than mineral diesel under a carbon price or carbon tax regime. The biodiesel policies and programs at the federal and state government levels are examined and critically assessed. The option of mandated targets is discussed and analysed. The research finds that despite several programs and policies currently in place, there is a lack of overall policy direction on biodiesel in the short term. The analysis also highlights the significant potential for government policy to shape <b>pricing</b> <b>relativity</b> – either in favour of, or against biodiesel. The environmental and sustainability benefits of first generation biodiesel are assessed. The emerging role of the various sustainability roundtables in providing sustainability assurance is outlined and discussed. The research concludes that biodiesel does offer both environmental and sustainability benefits over mineral diesel – providing that sustainability criteria are adhered to. The research also concludes that there is not a clear consensus on those credentials among the various stakeholders and that more needs to be done to increase awareness of those benefits to foster uptake...|$|R
40|$|This {{study is}} the second {{in a series of}} AERU Research Reports {{presenting}} results of Consumer Surveys for various agricultural and horticultural products. In this study meat is the commodity under investigation and Christchurch was the location of the survey. Expenditure on meat is a major item in the family budget and in recent years a number of factors have operated to influence buying and consumption patterns. Not the least of these factors has been the steady increase in price of all meats and a changing <b>price</b> <b>relativity</b> between types of meat. It is hoped that the results of the survey will assist the meat trade in planning and executing its marketing operations...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a model of}} climate change adaptation in the Nepalese economy and uses it to simulate long-run impacts of climate change and cropland re-allocation on household poverty. We develop a computable general equilibrium (CGE) model for Nepal, with a nested set of constant elasticity of transformation (CET) functional forms to model the allocation of land within different agricultural sectors. Supply of land depends on the magnitude of {{effects of climate change}} on different crops. Land transformation elasticities in the CET functions reflect the ease of switching from one crop to another based on their agronomic characteristics and degree of impacts of climate change. The distinguishing feature of the model is flexibility of CET values. Use of a set of CET values at the sectoral level thus captures the transformation effects of agronomic feasibility and profitability of crops while, at the same time, retaining the role of <b>price</b> <b>relativity</b> in the demand side of land along with other factors of production. The results suggest that, in the long run, farmers tend to allocate land to crops that are comparatively less impacted by climate change, such as paddy. Furthermore, the results reveal that land re-allocation tends to reduce income disparity among household groups and poverty by significantly moderating the income losses of marginal farmers.

30|$|Price {{processes}} are modeled to have continuously compounded returns given by locally bilateral gamma processes with zero covariations between them. It is observed that covariances can arise at specific horizons only if integrated variations are stochastic. This observation suggests that perhaps variations are Markovian and functionally {{dependent on the}} price processes themselves. Anticipating {{the absence of such}} dependence except when <b>price</b> <b>relativities</b> are strained leads to the conjecture that the dependencies must be nonlinear. For stylized models with a known nonlinear dependence, it is verified that support vector machine regressions are capable of detecting the prevailing nonlinearity. For variations to depend on prices, the parameters of the underlying bilateral gamma process should depend on prices. Support vector machine regressions are then employed to model parameter variations as depending nonlinearly on prices.|$|E
40|$|In this paper, all {{technology}} transfers are {{embodied in}} trade flows within a three-region, six-tradedcommodity {{version of the}} GTAP model. 4 % Hicks-Neutral technical progress in heavy manufacturing in one region has uneven impacts on productivity elsewhere. Why? Destination regions’ ability to harness new technology depends on their absorptive capacity and on the structural congruence of the source and destination. Together with trade volume, these two factors determine the recipient’s success in capturing foreign technology. Sectors, intensive in heavy manufacturing, register higher productivity growth. Inter-regional competition coupled with changes in <b>price</b> <b>relativities,</b> loom large in general equilibrium adjustment. Hicks-neutrality of the TFP (total factor productivity) improvement implies that, at the initial configuration of inputs, the marginal products of land, labour, and capital, change by the same proportion in any region. However, for the experiment conducted, productivity changes and the spillover coefficients dominate the variable impact across sectors and regions. ...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} was to quantify the extent of the increase in dairy farming in Canterbury, New Zealand, and to examine factors that have led to the changes in land use and production. In this paper we present data on land use change, production and productivity, together with product price data for the alternative activities. Data were obtained from a variety of printed sources and personal communications. Between 1980 and 2009 the land used for dairying in Canterbury increased from about 20, 000 ha to nearly 190, 000 ha. Per cow and per hectare production also increased both in absolute terms and also relative to elsewhere in New Zealand. Total production increased about fifteen fold during this period. On a national basis Canterbury produced 15 % of New Zealand’s milk in 2008 - 09 compared to 2 % in 1982 - 83. Drivers of this land use change were the development of irrigation, lower land prices relative to elsewhere in New Zealand, the adoption of new technologies and reduced profitability of some aspects of traditional farming systems. It is suggested that, given the current <b>price</b> <b>relativities</b> and some further irrigation development, the Canterbury land area involved in dairy farming could double in the next 20 years...|$|E
40|$|Despite the {{continuous}} growth of dry bulk trade volume, {{the profitability of}} bulk shipping sector has not been improved. The Baltic dry index (BDI), {{an indicator of the}} dry bulk business, hit more than 4, 000 in 2010 but has tumbled down to approximately 900 recently. The bulk shipping business is still suffering in a devastating situation. Many ship owners have forced to lay up their vessels to reduce the operating loss. It is believed that the poor profitability of the dry bulk shipping market is mainly caused by the over expansion in shipping capacity. The price of commodities and the volume of seaborne trade are identified as determinants to the dramatic growth of world tonnage in the past few decades. One of the main objectives {{of this study is to}} examine the <b>price</b> volume <b>relativity</b> in the bulk shipping industry. Our findings suggest that a negative relationship between the freight rate and world tonnage exists. Department of Logistics and Maritime Studie...|$|R
40|$|As {{part of a}} {{comprehensive}} review of Australia's tax system, the taxes on alcoholic beverages recently came under scrutiny. In its initial response to the review in May 2010, the government chose to not change those taxes, even though the review recommended the wine tax switch from an "ad valorem" to a volumetric basis and that all beverages be taxed to the same extent per litre of alcohol. This paper introduces a mini-symposium of three other papers aimed at contributing to what will be an on-going public policy debate on the optimal taxation of alcohol for purposes of covering social costs associated with harmful alcohol consumption, influencing consumer behaviour through altering beverage <b>prices</b> levels and <b>relativities,</b> and raising government revenue.
