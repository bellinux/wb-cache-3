40|$|Abstract. When {{drill in}} a highly {{permeable}} zone the common problem faced by the operator is lost circulation of drilling mud into the formation. Lost circulation of mud are costly and therefore lost circulation materials (LCM) being introduced to the mud formulation to prevent lost circulation from the formation. Since Malaysia is {{the one of the}} major country producer of Palm kernel Oil (PKO) with the high production of crude fibre from palm kernel (<b>palm</b> <b>kernel</b> <b>expeller),</b> thus this study was carried out to determine the ability of <b>Palm</b> <b>Kernel</b> <b>Expeller</b> (PKE) to be used as LCM in drilling mud. PKE used was in granule form by cause of pressing under high pressure compress to remove palm oil. Rheological and API filtration test were carried to determine the characteristic PKE in drilling mud. Water based mud (WBM) sample was used in this study with four (4) different concentration of PKE. The results show the filter cake formed was improved as the concentration increased and the filtrate loss reduced. SEM data also shows the ability of PKE to form a bridge across the pore thus reducing the loss of filtration...|$|E

40|$|This {{experiment}} {{was conducted to}} investigate the effects of <b>palm</b> <b>kernel</b> <b>expellers</b> on growth performance, nutrient digestibility, and blood profiles of weaned pigs. A total of 88 weaned pigs (6. 94 ± 0. 76 kg body weight [BW]; 28 d old) were randomly allotted to 2 dietary treatments (4 pigs/pen; 11 replicates/treatment) in a randomized complete block design (sex as a block). The dietary treatments were a typical nursery diet based on corn and soybean meal (CON) and CON added with 20 % of <b>palm</b> <b>kernel</b> <b>expellers</b> (PKE). Pigs were fed for 6 wk using a 3 -phase feeding program with declining diet complexity and with phases of 1, 2, and 3 wk, respectively. Blood was collected from randomly selected 2 pigs in each pen before weaning and on d 7 after weaning. Pigs were fed respective dietary treatments containing 0. 2 % chromic oxide from d 29 to 35 after weaning. Fecal samples were collected from randomly selected 2 pigs in each pen daily for the last 3 days after the 4 -d adjustment period. Measurements were growth performances, digestibility of dry matter, nitrogen and energy, white and red blood cell counts, packed cell volume, and incidence of diarrhea. The PKE increased average daily gain (ADG) (246 vs 215 g/d; p = 0. 06) and average daily feed intake (ADFI) (470 vs 343 g/d; p< 0. 05) and decreased gain-to-feed ratio (G:F) (0. 522 vs 0. 628 g/g; p< 0. 05) during phase 2 compared with CON, but did not affect growth performance during phase 1 and 3. During overall experimental period, PKE increased ADG (383 vs 362 g/d; p = 0. 05) and ADFI (549 vs 496 g/d; p< 0. 05) compared with CON, but did not affect G:F. However, {{no differences were found}} on digestibility of dry matter, nitrogen, and energy between CON and PKE. The PKE reduced frequency of diarrhea (15 % vs 25 %; p = 0. 08) for the first 2 wk after weaning compared with CON. Similarly, PKE decreased white blood cells (8. 19 vs 9. 56 × 103 /μL; p = 0. 07), red blood cells (2. 92 vs 3. 25 × 106 /μL; p = 0. 09), and packed cell volume (11. 1 % vs 12. 6 %; p = 0. 06) on d 7 after weaning compared with CON. In conclusion, addition of 20 % <b>palm</b> <b>kernel</b> <b>expellers</b> to nursery diet based on corn and soybean meal had no negative effects on growth performance, nutrient digestibility, and blood profiles of weaned pigs...|$|R
40|$|This {{experiment}} {{was conducted to}} investigate the effects of <b>palm</b> <b>kernel</b> <b>expellers</b> on productive performance, nutrient digestibility, and changes in white blood cells (WBC) of lactating sows. A total of 14 sows (200 ± 12 kg of average body weight [BW]; 2. 5 of average parity) were used and moved from gestation room to farrowing room on d 109 of gestation. Sows {{were randomly assigned to}} 2 dietary treatments in a completely randomized design. The treatments were a diet based on corn and soybean meal (CON) and CON added with 20 % of <b>palm</b> <b>kernel</b> <b>expellers</b> (PKE). Sows were fed the treatments for 28 days (weaning) after farrowing. Blood was collected from each sow and 4 randomly selected piglets from each sow before farrowing or on d 3, 7, or 14 of lactation. Sows were fed respective treatments containing 0. 2 % chromic oxide from d 15 to 21 of lactation. Fecal samples were collected daily for the last 3 days after the 4 -d adjustment period. Measurements were performances and WBC changes of sows and litter, nutrient digestibility of sows, and daily diarrhea of litter. Sows fed PKE had greater average daily feed intake (7. 38 vs 7. 10 kg/d; p< 0. 05) and lost less BW (− 6. 85 vs − 8. 54 kg; p< 0. 05) and backfat depth (− 0. 42 vs − 0. 71 mm; p< 0. 05) than those fed CON. However, there were no differences on digestibility of dry matter, nitrogen, and energy and weaning to estrus interval of sows fed either CON or PKE. Piglets from sows fed PKE gained more BW (203 vs 181 g/d; p = 0. 08) and had less frequency of diarrhea (6. 80 vs 8. 56 %; p = 0. 07) than those from sows fed CON. On the other hand, no difference was found on preweaning mortality of piglets from sows fed either CON or PKE. Sows fed PKE had lower number of WBC (9. 57 vs 11. 82 × 103 /μL; p = 0. 09) before farrowing than those fed CON, but no difference on d 3 and 7. Similarly, piglets from sows fed PKE had also lower number of WBC (7. 86 vs 9. 80 × 103 /μL; p< 0. 05) on d 14 of lactation than those from sows fed CON, but no difference on d 3 and 7. In conclusion, addition of 20 % <b>palm</b> <b>kernel</b> <b>expellers</b> to lactation diet based on corn and soybean meal had no negative effects on productive performance, nutrient digestibility, and WBC changes of lactating sows...|$|R

This PT was open only to National Reference Laboratories (NRLs). The EURL-HM- 23 test item was a <b>palm</b> <b>kernel</b> <b>expeller</b> spiked with As, Cd, Hg and Pb. The homogeneity and stability of the test item were evaluated and the assigned values were derived from the results reported by the selected expert laboratories. Thirty four National Reference Laboratories from thirty countries (all EU member states plus Iceland and Norway) registered to the exercise and reported results. Laboratory results were rated using z- and zeta (ζ-) scores in accordance with ISO 13528 : 2015. The following relative standard deviations for proficiency assessment (σpt) were set according to the modified Horwitz equation: 15 % for total As and iAs; 16 % for Cd; 17 % for Pb and 22 % for Hg. More than 87 % of the participating NRLs reported satisfactory results (according to the z-score) for total As, Cd, Pb and Hg, and more than 76 % for iAs, thus confirming their ability in monitoring maximum levels set by the EU Directive 2002 / 32 /EC.

Eight barrows (initial BW of 40. 0 kg, SD = 4. 5) were individually housed in metabolism crates. A replicated 4 × 3 incomplete Latin square design was employed involving 4 dietary treatments, 3 periods, and 8 animals. Three experimental diets contained 40 % CE, PKE or CR as {{the only source of}} P. A P-free diet mainly based on corn starch, sucrose, and gelatin was also prepared to estimate the basal endogenous loss of P. The marker-to-marker method was used for fecal collection. Values for the ATTD of P in the CE and PKE were greater than in the CR (46. 0 and 39. 7 vs − 14. 0 %; p< 0. 05). However, the STTD of P did not differ greatly among the test ingredients (56. 5, 49. 0, and 43. 2 % in the CE, PKE, and CR, respectively).

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{determine}} the effect of β-mannanase supplementation on digestible energy (DE) and metabolizable energy (ME) contents of copra <b>expellers</b> (CE) and <b>palm</b> <b>kernel</b> <b>expellers</b> (PKE) fed to pigs. Six barrows with an initial body weight of 38. 0 kg (standard deviation = 1. 5) were randomly allotted to a 6 × 6 Latin square design with 6 dietary treatments and 6 periods. Six experimental diets were prepared in a 3 × 2 factorial treatment arrangement with 3 diets of a corn-soybean meal-based diet, a CE 30 % diet, and a PKE 30 % diet and with 2 concentrations of supplemental β-mannanase at 0 or 2, 400 U/kg. All diets had the same proportion of corn:soybean meal ratio at 2. 88 : 1. The marker-to-marker procedure was used for fecal and urine collection with 4 -d adaptation and 5 -d collection periods. No interactive effects were observed between diet and β-mannanase on energy digestibility and DE and ME contents of experimental diets. However, diets containing CE or PKE had less (p< 0. 05) DE and ME contents compared with the corn-soybean meal-based diet. The DE and ME contents in CE and PKE were not affected by supplemental β-mannanase.

Our {{results showed that}} enzyme treatment decreased (p 0. 05) among treatment groups in the finisher period, ADG of chickens in the control (PKE-free diet) was higher (p 0. 05) FCR. The intestinal villus height and crypt depth (duodenum, jejunum and ileum) were not different (p> 0. 05) among treatments except for duodenal crypt depth. The villus height and crypt depth of birds in enzyme treated PKE diets were higher (p 0. 05) among treatments. Results {{of this study suggest}} that exogenous enzyme is effective in hydrolyzing the fiber (hemicellulose and cellulose) component and improved the ME values of PKE, however, the above positive effects were not reflected in the growth performance in broiler chickens fed the enzyme treated PKE compared to those received raw PKE.

A digestibility {{study was conducted with}} twenty four lambs fed one of four different amounts (0, 15, 30 or 45 %) of their dry matter (DM) intake as PKE, plus molasses pellets (PKEM; 90 % PKE and 10 % molasses) with the remainder of the diet being fresh pasture. Sheep were fed at either maintenance or ad libitum during two experimental periods, that differed in pasture quality. Digestibilities were extrapolated linearly to estimate digestible energy concentration and the apparent digestibility of DM, crude protein, neutral detergent fibre and gross energy at any intakes for a diet consisting of 100 % PKEM. Overall, the estimated apparent digestibility of DM, crude protein, neutral detergent fibre and gross energy for PKEM at intakes of 670 and 1, 214 gDM/lamb/day were 63. 0, 52. 0, 67. 0 and 64. 0 %, respectively.

40|$|In this study, the {{combustion}} properties {{of three of}} the UK's commonly imported biomass fuels for co-firing, which are <b>palm</b> <b>kernel</b> <b>expellers,</b> shea residue, and waste from olive oil production are examined. The fuels were characterised and their thermal decomposition properties were studied by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). Additionally the products from their devolatilisation were identified by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (py-GC-MS) analysis of the evolved vapours and tars from high heating rate pyrolysis tests. Finally, chars from the fuels were prepared, analysed, and combustion studies were conducted by TGA-MS to determine the conversion of char-nitrogen to different nitrogen-containing species. In general, the main constituents of their ash fractions were K, Si, Ca and Mg, resulting in high alkali indices, which predict a large tendency to fouling. The pyrolysis and combustion kinetic parameters, estimated from TGA studies of these fuels and their chars, are much lower than those reported in the literature for lignocellulosic biomass. It is suspected that there is oil/fat evaporation processes overlapping with the decomposition of their lignocellulosic fractions, which significantly affects the apparent kinetics. The pyrolysis conditions used promoted depletion of nitrogen in the char, resulting in approximately 79 - 91 % of the fuel-N being released with the volatiles. In combustion of the char, NOx and N- 2 are the major nitrogen compounds detected.

40|$|Biomass is {{the most}} {{utilized}} form of renewable energy, especially in developing nations, and is a possible replacement for fossil fuel in power generation. The most commonly used method for recovering energy from biomass is combustion. Many countries are exploring the utilization of energy crops and indigenous residues to deliver sustainable sources of biomass. For these bio-resources, detailed characterization of the fuel properties is essential in order to optimize the combustion processes. In this study, some potential energy crops and woods from Nigeria, namely Terminalia superba, Gmelina arborea, Lophira alata, Nauclea diderrichii, and also one abundant agricultural residue, <b>palm</b> <b>kernel</b> <b>expellers</b> (PKE), were characterized for their combustion properties. Standard characterization methods such as proximate and ultimate analyses, metals analysis, and ash fusion test were {{used for this purpose}} and the results were compared with some U. K. biomass.

Finally, combustion studies were conducted by suspending single biomass particles in a methane flame to obtain information on reactivities and combustion characteristics. Results indicate that the ash fractions in the Nigerian woods were low in K, Si, and Ca, resulting in low calculated alkali indices, hence these fuels are not predicted to cause severe fouling problems. Furthermore, the analysis of the evolved product during devolatilisation from Py-GC-MS suggests that the content of oil is high in Gmelina. Finally, the results from the single particle combustion experiments revealed a longer char burn out rate for Lophira and Nauclea when compared with those of Terminalia and Gmelina...|$|R
30|$|Two {{experiments}} {{were conducted to}} determine the effects of enzyme complex on in vitro dry matter (DM) digestibility for feed ingredients. The objective of experiment 1 was to screen feed ingredients that can be effective substrates for an enzyme complex, mainly consisted of β-pentosanase, β-glucanase and α-amylase, using in vitro digestibility methods. In experiment 1, the test ingredients were three grain sources (barley, corn and wheat) and six protein supplements (canola meal, copra expellers, cottonseed meal, distillers dried grains with solubles, <b>palm</b> <b>kernel</b> <b>expellers</b> and soybean meal). In vitro ileal and total tract digestibility (IVID and IVTTD, respectively) of DM for test ingredients were determined. In vitro digestibility methods consisted of two- or three-step procedure simulating in vivo digestion in the pig gastrointestinal tracts with or without enzyme complex. As the enzyme complex added, the IVID of DM for corn and wheat increased (p <  0.05) by 5.0 and 2.6 percentage unit, respectively. The IVTTD of DM for corn increased (p <  0.05) by 3.1 percentage unit with enzyme complex addition. As the effect of enzyme complex was the greatest in corn digestibility, corn grains were selected to determine the in vitro digestibility of the fractions (starch, germ, hull and gluten) that maximally respond to the enzyme complex in experiment 2. The IVID of DM for corn starch, germ and hull increased (p <  0.05) by 16.0, 2.8 and 1.2 percentage unit, respectively. The IVTTD of DM for corn starch and hull also increased (p <  0.05) by 8.6 and 0.9 percentage unit, respectively, with enzyme complex addition. In conclusion, the enzyme complex increases in vitro DM digestibility of corn and wheat, and the digestibility increments of corn are mainly attributed to the increased digestibility of corn starch.|$|R

EFB fibre and PKE, due to their physical properties, were recommended to be blended with sawdust in producing quality briquettes. In overall, converting palm biomass into briquettes has increased its energy content and reduced moisture content about minimum of 5 % and 38 % respectively compared to its raw materials.

40|$|Purpose: Production of feed is an {{important}} contributor to life cycle greenhouse gas emissions, or carbon footprints (CFPs), of livestock products. Consequences of methodological choices and data sensitivity on CFPs of feed ingredients were explored to improve comparison and interpretation of CFP studies. Methods and data for emissions from cultivation and processing, land use (LU), and land use change (LUC) were analyzed. Method: For six ingredients (maize, wheat, <b>palm</b> <b>kernel</b> <b>expeller,</b> rapeseed meal, soybean meal, and beet pulp), CFPs resulting from a single change in methods and data were compared with a reference CFP, i. e., based on IPCC Tier 1 methods, and data from literature. Results and discussion: Results show that using more detailed methods to compute N 2 O emissions from cultivation hardly affected reference CFPs, except for methods to determine leaching (contributing to indirect N 2 O emissions) in which the influence is about - 7 to + 12 %. Overall, CFPs appeared most sensitive to changes in crop yield and applied synthetic fertilizer N. The inclusion of LULUC emissions can change CFPs considerably, i. e., up to 877 %. The level of LUC emissions per feed ingredient highly depends on the method chosen, {{as well as on}} assumptions on area of LUC, C stock levels (mainly aboveground C and soil C), and amortization period. Conclusions: We concluded that variability in methods and data can significantly affect CFPs of feed ingredients and hence CFPs of livestock products. Transparency in methods and data is therefore required. For harmonization, focus should be on methods to calculate leaching and emissions from LULUC. It is important to consider LUC in CFP studies of food, feed, and bioenergy products...|$|E

To reduce this, rations can be formulated with expected carbohydrate fermentation being higher in level, and rate, than that of protein fermentation, as it is accepted that available energy is the limiting factor during fermentation in the hindgut. In this study, {{a modified version of}} a gas production technique was used to determine fermentation characteristics of protein in feedstuffs and concentrates after pre-digestion with pepsin and pancreatic enzymes in order to simulate digestion in the stomach and small intestine of pigs. Completing the incubations in an N-free environment, and with an excess of rapidly fermentable carbohydrates, made N the limiting factor to microbial growth, and so gas production profiles reflect availability of N. Results showed that fermentation of protein in the hindgut can be determined with this modified gas production technique, and that there were distinct differences in protein fermentation among the feed samples. Availability of protein for fermentation was highest in pea meal, solvent extracted soybean meal and feather meal, and lowest in <b>palm</b> <b>kernel</b> (<b>expeller),</b> wheat grain and meat meal. Between 5 and 15 h of incubation, gas production increased linearly. Urea was used as a positive control, as it is readily available to microbes. Gas production after 10 h of incubation, relative to gas production with urea, was assumed to be a measure of protein availability, allowing the content and proportion of fermentable crude protein (CP) to be estimated. Results show that this gas production technique ranked feed samples relative to their CP availability in the hindgut.

40|$|Purpose - Production of feed is an {{important}} contributor to life cycle greenhouse gas emissions, or carbon footprints (CFPs), of livestock products. Consequences of methodological choices and data sensitivity on CFPs of feed ingredients were explored to improve comparison and interpretation of CFP studies. Methods and data for emissions from cultivation and processing, land use (LU), and land use change (LUC) were analyzed. Method - For six ingredients (maize, wheat, <b>palm</b> <b>kernel</b> <b>expeller,</b> rapeseed meal, soybean meal, and beet pulp), CFPs resulting from a single change in methods and data were compared with a reference CFP, i. e., based on IPCC Tier 1 methods, and data from literature. Results and discussion Results - show that using more detailed methods to compute N 2 O emissions from cultivation hardly affected reference CFPs, except for methods to determine NO - 3 leaching (contributing to indirect N 2 O emissions) in which the influence is about - 7 to + 12 %. Overall, CFPs appeared most sensitive to changes in crop yield and applied synthetic fertilizer N. The inclusion of LULUC emissions can change CFPs considerably, i. e., up to 877 %. The level of LUC emissions per feed ingredient highly depends on the method chosen, {{as well as on}} assumptions on area of LUC, C stock levels (mainly aboveground C and soil C), and amortization period. Conclusions - We concluded that variability in methods and data can significantly affect CFPs of feed ingredients and hence CFPs of livestock products. Transparency in methods and data is therefore required. For harmonization, focus should be on methods to calculate NO - 3 leaching and emissions from LULUC. It is important to consider LUC in CFP studies of food, feed, and bioenergy product...|$|E
40|$|In this study, a {{modified}} version of the gas production technique was used to determine protein fermentation characteristics in rumen fluid of 19 feedstuffs. Performing the incubations in a N-free environment, and with an excess of rapidly fermentable carbohydrates, made N the limiting factor to microbial growth, and so gas production profiles reflected the availability of N from the feed samples. Results showed that fermentation of protein in rumen fluid can be determined with this modified gas production technique, and that there were distinct differences in protein fermentation between the feed samples. Availability of protein for fermentation was highest in wheat, potato pieces and lupin, and lowest in Rumiraap, a formaldehyde treated rapeseed meal, <b>palm</b> <b>kernel</b> <b>expeller</b> and brewery grains. The protein degradation characteristics of the 19 feed ingredients were also determined with the in situ nylon bag technique. With the obtained results, the amount of rumen escape protein (REP) was calculated for each feedstuff. The results showed that the rate of degradation ranged from 0. 010 /h for Rumiraap to 0. 151 /h for wheat. The amount of REP ranged from 197 g/kg CP for lupin to 840 g/kg CP for Rumiraap. Comparing the gas production results with the results obtained with the nylon bag technique showed that there was a good relationship between the gas production after 12 - 25 h of incubation and the calculated amount of REP (r 2 = 0. 83 - 0. 85). The results show that the adapted gas production technique, being depleted of N and using an excess of rapidly fermentable carbohydrates, is suitable to recognize differences in N availability between feed samples and can be used as an alternative to the nylon bag technique and other in vitro technique...|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{the study}} was to {{determine}} the effect of different inclusion levels of <b>palm</b> <b>kernel</b> <b>expeller</b> (PKE) in dairy concentrates for grazing Jersey cows on lactation performance and rumen fermentation patterns. Forty-eight multiparous, Jersey cows, grazing kikuyu-ryegrass during spring, were blocked according to 4 % fat corrected milk, days in milk and lactation number and randomly allocated to three treatments based on PKE level in the concentrate. The PKE inclusion in the control (C), low PKE (LP), and high PKE (HP) treatment concentrates was 0, 200, and 400 g/kg, respectively, and was fed for a 60 d period, preceded by a 21 d adaptation period. The PKE partially substituted some of the maize and soybean in the concentrate. Additionally, eight rumen-fistulated, lactating dairy cows were randomly allocated to the C and HP treatment in a two period cross-over design. Cows received 6 kg (as is) concentrate per day divided over two milkings and strip-grazed pasture as one group. Milk yield and milk fat content did not differ between treatments and were 21. 3, 21. 3 and 20. 7 kg/cow/d and 46. 3, and 46. 5, and 46. 6 g/kg for the C, LP and HP treatment, respectively. Milk protein, milk urea nitrogen, body weight and body condition score did not differ between cows on all treatments. Total volatile fatty acid, mean ruminal pH, ammonia nitrogen, and in situ pasture dry matter and neutral detergent fibre degradability did not differ between cows on all treatments. The acetic to propionic acid ratio was higher (P= 0. 006) for cows receiving treatment HP compared to cows receiving treatment C (3. 40 vs. 3. 22). It was concluded that PKE can sustain milk yield and milk fat components at a level of up to 400 g/kg of concentrate when fed at 6 kg/cow/d to cows grazing kikuyu-ryegrass pasture. A more practical recommendation might be to limit PKE to 200 g/kg of concentrate due to potential palatability problems and a slow rate of intake when fed during milking in the parlour.

40|$|Two {{studies were}} {{conducted}} on pregnant, non-lactating dairy cows to investigate the metabolisable energy (ME) requirements for maintenance and the efficiency with which ME is used for body weight (BW) gain. In the first experiment, 53 non-lactating, pregnant Holstein-Friesian × Jersey cross dairy cows were fed one of three allowances [low: 7. 5 kg,medium: 10. 1 kg, or high: 12. 4 kg of dry matter (DM) /day] of freshly cut autumn pasture for 38 ± 2 days (mean ± SD) in individual stalls to allow the measurement of estimated DM and ME intake daily. Animals were blocked by age (6 ± 2 years), day of gestation (208 ± 17 days), and BW (526 ± 55 kg). Cows on the low, medium, and high allowance treatments consumed 7. 5, 9. 4, and 10. 6 kg of DM/day, and BW gain, including the conceptus, was 0. 2, 0. 6, and 0. 9 kg/day. The ME content of pasture was estimated by wet chemistry from in vitro true digestibility and by near infrared spectroscopy. Total ME requirements for maintenance, pregnancy, and limited activity were 1. 07 MJ ME/kg of measured metabolic BW/day. This is more than 45 % higher than current recommendations. Differences {{may be due to}} an underestimation of ME requirements for maintenance or pregnancy, an overestimation of diet metabolisability, or a combination of these. Further research is necessary to determine the reasons for the greater ME requirements measured in the present study, but the results are important for on-farm decisions regarding feed allocation for nonlactating, pregnant dairy cows. In experiment 2, the amount of ME required for BW gain from pasture and commonly used supplementary feeds was investigated to estimate the efficiency with which ME is used for BW gain (kg). Control cows were offered autumn pasture to estimated maintenance requirements (- 0. 55 MJ ME/kg BW 0. 75), with an additional 20 MJ ME/d allocated for pregnancy and activity. All other cows received the same allowance of autumn pasture (Past) and an additional allowance (2. 5 or 5. 0 kg DM/day) of Past, spring pasture silage (Psil), maize silage (Msil), maize grain (Mgr), or <b>palm</b> <b>kernel</b> <b>expeller</b> (PKE). Regression analyses on BW allowed the determination of ME intake on BW gain for each feed; the kg was estimated from this, assuming each kg of BW contained 25 MJ of net energy. The kg of Past and Msil were 0. 34 and 0. 47, consistent with published literature and the kg of Psil (0. 50) was in line with published values for spring pasture. The greatest kg (0. 61) was for PKE, possibly due to its high fibre and fat content, and the fact that acetate and medium to long chained fatty acids are not substantially used for conceptus metabolism. The kg for Mgr was low (0. 38), possibly because the end products of digestion of starch (i. e. propionate and the hepatic-derived glucose) are used preferentially for conceptus metabolism and less for BW gain, or because the composition of BW gain differed relative to the other treatments. Results confirm differences between feeds in kg when pasture is the base diet, and provide important information for feed budgeting and ration formulation in grazing systems...|$|E
40|$|Pulverised {{coal-fired}} power generation technologies {{are important for}} meeting the electricity consumption worldwide, especially for the developing countries. Changing fuels (coal blending, co-combustion, new fuels, etc.) is common practice in the power stations, which may result in the change of ash deposition behaviours. Ash deposition issues can reduce the heat transfer and {{have a negative effect}} on the long-term operation of the combustion systems. Therefore, prediction of ash deposition behaviours is significant for the efficient operation of boilers. In this thesis, new ash deposition prediction models based on particle impaction and sticking behaviours, ash melting behaviour and multi-slagging routes have been developed in order to understand ash deposit formation and predict the slagging propensities through using Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) methods and ash deposition indices. Regarding the CFD methods, an ash deposition model has been proposed to predict the ash deposit formation on an uncooled probe for the co-combustion of South African coal and <b>palm</b> <b>kernel</b> <b>expeller</b> in an entrained flow reactor. A new revised particle impaction sub-model has been developed in order to minimize the numerical related errors without excessive meshing. The molten fraction model obtained from the chemical equilibrium calculations was employed to predict the particle sticking behaviour. The simulation results show that the revised particle impaction model is suitable to accurately resolve particle impaction without using a prohibitive meshing size. Particle impaction and sticking properties dictate the ash deposit formation. In addition, a CFD-based dynamic ash deposition model has been developed to predict the slagging formation on a cooled probe under high furnace temperatures of Zhundong lignite (rich in alkali and alkaline earth metal elements) combustion in a pilot-scale furnace. The developed model is based on the inertia impaction, the thermophoresis and the direct alkali vapour condensation and incorporates the influence of the heat transfer rate. The results show that particle deposition from the inertia impaction and the thermophoresis dictates ash deposit formation under high furnace temperatures. The deposition caused by the direct alkali vapour condensation is less significant. As deposition time increases, particle impaction efficiency decreases and sticking efficiency increases due to the thermophoresis and the local temperature conditions. In addition, the ash deposition characteristics are influenced under different furnace temperatures, due to the changes in the particle impaction and sticking behaviours. Further, a new method for building the ash deposition indice has been proposed to predict the slagging propensities of coals/blends combustion in utility boilers. The method is based on the initial slagging routes and the sintered/slagging route. Two types of initial slagging routes are considered, namely (i) pyrite-induced initial slagging on the furnace wall, and (ii) fouling caused by the alkaline/alkali components condensing in the convection section. In addition, the sintered/slagging route is considered by the liquids temperature, which represents the melting potential of the main ash composition and is calculated using the chemical equilibrium methods. The partial least square regression (PLSR) technique, coupled with a cross validation method, is employed to obtain the correlation for the ash deposition indice. The results obtained show that the developed indice yields a higher success rate in classifying the overall slagging potential in boilers than some of the typical slagging indices. In addition, both SiO 2 and Al 2 O 3 can reduce the slagging potential, but the drop in slagging propensity is more significant by adding Al 2 O 3 compared to SiO 2...|$|E
