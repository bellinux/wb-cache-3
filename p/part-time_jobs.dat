5|$|The {{employer}} mandate requires employers meeting certain {{criteria to}} provide health insurance to their workers. The mandate applies to employers with more than 50 employees that do not offer health insurance to their full-time workers. Critics claimed that the mandate created a perverse incentive for business to keep their full-time headcount below 50 and to hire part-time workers instead. Between March 2010 and 2014 the number of <b>part-time</b> <b>jobs</b> declined by 230,000, {{while the number of}} full-time jobs increased by 2 million. In the public sector full-time jobs turned into <b>part-time</b> <b>jobs</b> much more than in the private sector. A 2016 study found only limited evidence that ACA had increased part-time employment.|$|E

In October 2004, the group signed to Newcastle based indie label Kitchenware Records. Upon signing to the record label they changed their band name to Editors.|$|E
5|$|Focused on hockey, {{exposed to}} drugs and alcohol and {{frequently}} getting into fights, James {{paid little attention to}} her education and nearly dropped out of school. A vice-principal at Valley Park Middle School, Ross Dixon, encouraged her to pay greater attention to her studies, allowing her to graduate from Overlea High School, now named Marc Garneau Collegiate Institute, and move onto Seneca College in Toronto. James struggled academically in her first year at Seneca, partially because she had rarely been held accountable for failing in her studies in the past, and partly because she was playing two sports at both the college and community level while working <b>part-time</b> <b>jobs</b> to help pay the family's bills. Seneca's hockey coach Lee Trempe had several arguments with James before she began to take her studies seriously.|$|E
5|$|In a {{study done}} by Rosamund Weatherall, Heather Joshi and Susan Macran of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine in 1994, the {{research}} presented suggests that women presented with the double burden have a lower mortality rate than women who are simply housewives. The women who were observed that had <b>part-time</b> <b>jobs</b> had a mortality rate lower than the women with full-time jobs and children. The same study also suggests that women who have young children {{are less likely to}} die than women who have no children or have older children. Although this evidence can not be strictly attributed to the double burden of having children and a career field, it can give a good indication of a trend in society. Also, this study was conducted in multiple countries including England, Wales, and the United States which gives the information presented from the study a more global perspective on the double burden.|$|E
30|$|Results {{from this}} study {{indicated}} that students’ subjective beliefs about initiative, independence and self-guidance as perceived behavioral control varied with intermediating intention part-time willingness and choice target apprenticeship. The data supported the assumed linear behavioral model linking Self-Direction, <b>Part-time</b> <b>Job</b> Willingness and Apprenticeship Choice. Path analysis exemplified that <b>Part-time</b> <b>Job</b> Willingness served as an endogenous mediating variable and was linked with Apprenticeship Willingness. Path analysis revealed that perceived independence and self-guidance evaluations varied significantly with <b>part-time</b> <b>job</b> willingness. Independence Interest showed the strongest, although negative, relationship with <b>part-time</b> <b>job</b> willingness. Initiative showing and <b>part-time</b> <b>job</b> were not linked in a statistically significant way. The relationship with <b>Part-time</b> <b>Job</b> Willingness and Apprenticeship Choice was positive and significant. Self-guidance want had a significant direct positive relationship with Apprenticeship. The aggregate impacts and unique situations of variables {{have to be taken}} into consideration when interpreting the path analysis model of this study. In aggregation, any single sample of behavior reflects not only the relevant general disposition, but also the influence of various other factors unique to the particular occasion, situation, and action being observed (see Ajzen [1991]). It is also worth noting that path analysis reveals provide estimates of assumed causal effect that one variable has on another through its causal effect on other variables, but it does not prove causation between one variable and another, ort the direction of the assumed causal order.|$|R

The suburb was once considered affluent, but as of 2012, {{almost half of the}} working age population are economically inactive and less than half of households own a car. The area has than higher levels of unemployment in comparison with Gateshead and England: at Broadway, Pottersway and the Avenue, only 23.8% of adults have full-time employment and 10.09% have <b>part-time</b> <b>jobs.</b> Around 3.1% of the population are self-employed. Those in employment work outside the area, except those employed in the suburb's public houses, betting shops or fast-food outlets. Other small shops provide some local employment, but few are open {{for any length of time}} as they cannot compete with larger retailers elsewhere in Gateshead.|$|E

30|$|The {{probability}} of being inactive in t is not increased by taking up a <b>part-time</b> <b>job</b> compared {{to having a}} full-time job in t− 1. The probabilities are 0.082 versus 0.113 when being high-paid and 0.138 versus 0.136 when being low-paid. Furthermore, the {{probability of}} being inactive is significantly larger when being unemployed (0.301) or inactive (0.708) in t− 1 instead of part-time employed in t− 1. Hence, working part-time in the past significantly increases the probability {{of being in the}} labor force in present. The same figures reveal that a low-paid <b>part-time</b> <b>job</b> in t− 1 goes along with a significantly higher probability of being inactive than a high-paid <b>part-time</b> <b>job</b> in t− 1 (0.138 versus 0.082).|$|R
