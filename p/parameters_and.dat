30|$|This {{study has}} {{proposed}} an approach for reducing <b>parameter</b> <b>and</b> structural uncertainty in LCC prediction modeling. The proposed approach herein quantifies uncertainty based on possibility theory. Subsequently, the Hartley-like measure {{is used to}} perform {{the sensitivity of the}} LCC prediction model <b>parameter</b> <b>and</b> structure. Using the sensitivity analysis, we are able to quantify precisely the effect of each LCC prediction model <b>parameter,</b> <b>and</b> also the effect of model structure. This analysis yields that the spectral, shape, <b>and</b> vegetation <b>parameters</b> are the most sensitive parameters in three different model structures.|$|R
