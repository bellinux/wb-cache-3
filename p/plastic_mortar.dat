Her first school was on a plantation in South Carolina, where she endured the rough life as best she could, and taught {{a large number of}} children from neighboring plantations. She also taught a class of aged people, who were then able to read the Bible. She next took charge of a school on Sonora Plantation, in Mississippi, the people much hindered by the use of tobacco and whisky. Her plantation school had no windows, but it was well ventilated and the rain beat in fiercely. Not being successful in getting the authorities to fix the building, she secured the willing service of two of her larger students. She mounted one mule, and the two boys another, and thus they rode to the gin mill.

In this paper, the expression relating the change in free energy of the pore water with an isothermal change in pressure is first derived. Based upon definitions of suctions, it is then shown that total, matric, and osmotic suctions can all be expressed in the same thermodynamic form. The widely accepted, but not yet satisfactorily validated, assumption that the total suction comprises matric and osmotic components is then confirmed theoretically. The well-known Kelvin equation for matric suction, and Morse and van’t Hoff equations for osmotic suction are subsequently derived from the corresponding thermodynamic equations. The applicability of latter two equations in evaluating the osmotic suctions of cement mortar and concrete is highlighted...|$|R

The solution illustrates trade-offs between elastic modulus, strength and dissipated work that are a result of transitions between various failure mechanisms associated with brick rupture and rupture of the interfaces. Detailed scaling relationships are presented with the goal of providing material developers with a straightforward means to identify synthesis targets that balance competing mechanical behaviors and optimize material response.

40|$|Abstract. Masonry {{represents}} the oldest building {{material in the}} history. The rehabilitation of a damaged building involves knowledge about the building material’s properties, the execution technology, the elaboration of the rehabilitation project and, also, theoretical knowledge about the strength calculus of the rehabilitated structure. All these are {{required in order to}} assess the bearing capacity. With the view to determine the strength and deformability characteristics of the old masonry (made from bricks and “bound ” with low-strength mortars), this paper proposes an analysis concerning the mechanical characteristics of the component materials and proposing a new method for testing the mortar adhesion to the “masonry stone ” (bricks). The test method involves determining the maximum tensile stress applied by a direct load at right angles {{to the surface of the}} mortar. The strength of a mortar can vary. If mixed with higher amounts of portland cement, a harder mortar is obtained. The more lime that is added, the softer and more <b>plastic</b> the <b>mortar</b> becomes, increasing its workability. A mortar strong in compression might be desirable for a hard stone, whereas a softer, more permeable lime mortar, would be preferable for a historic wall of soft bricks.

Appreciably, the research had confirmed that Aer-Tech material despite being classified as a light weight material had given high compressive strength of about 33. 91 N/mm 2. The compressive strength characteristics of Aer-Tech material make the material a potential cost effective construction material, comparable to conventional concrete. The material also showed through this study that it is a structural effective material with its singly reinforced beam giving ultimate moment of about 38. 7 KN. In addition, the Aer-Tech material is seen as a very good ductile material since, the singly reinforced beam in tension showed visible signs of diagonal vertical cracks long before impending rapture.

40|$|This {{programme}} of {{work was}} initiated {{as a result of}} recent major changes within Europe that have impacted upon the type of masonry mortars that are in use and the appropriate test procedures. A new suite oftest method standards, the EN 1015 series, has been issued by CEN {{over the last few years}} and supports two new mortar standards, BS EN 998 - 1 and BS EN 998 - 2, which are for plastering and rendering and masonry mortars respectively. In addition, there has been a large increase in the use of factory made mortar. Factory production, particularly as a dry mortar, leads itself to the production of more complex mortar formulations, and some mortars now contain as many as eight separate admixtures. These changes have lead to a large increase in the number of mortars that are highly air entrained, whilst the use of retarders and other admixtures in these mortars means that they frequently have pronounced thixotropic and other time dependant properties. All of these changes have in turn led to greater complexity in the fields of test methods and procedures. This thesis describes an investigation to define the properties of <b>plastic</b> <b>mortar</b> from first principles, then to compare these properties with the results produced by existing test methods to confirm ifthe latter were adequate. It was found that there were some properties for which several test methods existed, but some for which there were none.

50|$|Throughout the 1990s Cragg {{continued}} to develop two larger groups {{of work that}} have sustained his production up to the present: the Early Forms and the Rational Beings. The Early Forms series investigate the possibilities of manipulating everyday, familiar containers {{and the ways in}} which they can morph into and around one another in space. These sculptures derive their profiles and contours from simple, tick-walled vessels - such as chemistry vessels, <b>plastic</b> bottles and <b>mortars.</b> The surfaces of these initial objects are extended and contorted until new, sculpturally independent forms of movement arise. Through these processes of manipulation the initial objects develop new lines and contours, positive and negatively curving surfaces and volumes, protrusions and deep recessing folds. The broad field of containers and vessels used function as metaphors for cell, organ, organism or body. The Early Forms can be characterized as forms transmutating along a bilaterally curved axis, often with organic, even figurative, qualities. The Rational Beings are describable as organic looking forms often made of carbon fibre on a core of polystyrene. These sculptures derive their forms from the contours of gestural drawings, which Cragg then translates into the third dimension using thick, circular or oval discs which are superimposed (often vertically), glued together and covered with a skin. The underlying structure of these sculptures gives their skin the tension of a membrane, reflecting the basic structures of many organisms, organs, plants and animals.|$|R
40|$|The main {{objective}} of this thesis is to investigate the characteristics of rice husk ash RHA) and then its behaviour in self-compacting high performance concrete (SCHPC) with respects to rheological properties, hydration and microstructure development and alkali silica reaction, in comparison with silica fume (SF). The main {{results show that the}} RHA is a macro-mesoporous amorphous siliceous material with a very high silica content comparable with SF. The pore size distribution is the most important parameter of RHA besides amorphous silica content. This parameter affects pore volume, specific surface area, and thus the water demand and the pozzolanic reactivity of RHA and its behaviour in SCHPC. The incorporation of RHA decreases filling and passing abilities, but significantly increases plastic viscosity and segregation resistance of SCHPC. Therefore, RHA {{can be used as a}} viscosity modifying admixture for SCHPC. The incorporation of RHA increases the superplasticizer adsorption, the superplasticizer saturation dosage, yield stress and <b>plastic</b> viscosity of <b>mortar.</b> Fresh mortar formulated from SCHPC is a shear-thickening material. The incorporation of RHA/SF ecreases the shearthickening degree. The incorporation of RHA/SF increases the degree of cement hydration. SF appears more effective at 3 days possibly due to the better nucleation site effect, whereas RHA dominates at the later ages possibly due to the internal water curing effect. The incorporation of RHA/SF increases the degree of C 3 S hydration, particularly the C 3 S hydration rate from 3 to 14 days. The pozzolanic reaction takes place outside and inside RHA particles. The internal pozzolanic eaction products consolidate the pores inside RHA particles rather than contribute to the pore refinement in the cement matrix. In the presence of the high alkali concentration, RHA particles act as microreactive aggregates and react with alkali hydroxide to generate the expansive alkali silica reaction products. Increasing the particle size and temperature increases the alkali silica reactivity of RHA. The mechanism for the successive pozzolanic and alkali silica reactions of RHA is theorized. Additionally, a new simple mix design method is proposed for SCHPC containing various supplementary cementitious materials, i. e. RHA, SF, fly ash and limestone powder...|$|R
30|$|Nanotitanium dioxide {{has been}} used in several studies with cement-based {{materials}} due to its functionalities, such as removal of volatile organic compounds and self-cleaning, which are commonly known as photocatalytic properties (Lee and Kurtis 2010; Chen et al. 2012). Unlike nanosilica, it is a non-reactive filler and has no pozzolanic activity (Chen et al. 2012). Zhang and Li (2011) conducted a test on the concrete and demonstrated that a small quantity of nanoTiO 2 may have a better performance than adding a large volume. According to them, adding 1  wt% nanotitanium dioxide would increase the compressive strength by 118 %. This quantity could also reduce the porosity from 11 to 9 %. They concluded that the finer the pore structure of the concrete is, the higher the resistance of the concrete would be against the chloride penetration. Senff et al. (2012) prepared cement samples with 12  wt% nanotitanium dioxide based on a water/binder weight ratio of 0.5 and did rheological and flow table measurements. They found that the torque, yield stress, and <b>plastic</b> viscosity of <b>mortars</b> increase significantly by this modification. However, changes in the mechanical properties, such as the compressive strength, were not obvious. According to the study carried out by Meng et al. (2012), where 0, 5, and 10  wt% nanoTiO 2 were mixed by the cement, the compressive strength decreases once 10  wt% nanotitanium dioxide were added to the cement. Similar results were shown by Perez-Nicolas et al. (Pérez-Nicolás et al. 2017) where they found that after 28 days of curing, increasing the amount of nanometrically structured TiO 2 in the cement decreased the compressive strength due to the increase of mixing water. Chen et al. (2012) used a similar percentage as Meng et al. (2014) and showed that the compressive strength increases at all ages. Besides, cement samples could withstand the corrosion and flame abrasion (Lee and Kurtis 2010). Mohseni et al. (2016) studied the application of nanoTiO 2 on rice hush ash-based cement composites. The percentage of nanoparticles used varies from 1 to 5  wt% of the binder, and the water-to-binder ratio of 0.4 was used to prepare the slurry. Improvements of the compressive strength and durability were recorded, especially for the mixture having 10  wt% rice hush ash and 5  wt% nanoTiO 2. They also observed reductions in the transfer properties with the increase of nanoadditives in the chloride permeability test.|$|R
40|$|The {{rheological}} {{and material}} parameters determining the pumpability of fresh self-compacting mortar {{have been studied}} in full-scale (70 m Ø 50 mm rubber hose and screw pump with max capacity 7 m 3 /h). Concrete pressure gradient over the hose length (dp/dx) and flow rate were measured to quantify pumpability. The rheological properties of the pumped mortars were measured with a ConTec BML viscometer. Finally, the rheological properties of the slip layer that occurs in vicinity of {{the wall of the}} hose during pumping was studyed as matrix phase (paste and filler < 0. 125 mm) in a parallel plate rheometer. Five different concrete mixes were investigated showing that slump flow is not suitable for differentiating pumpability. Interpretation of rheological data was, moreover, complicated since the measured values of plastic viscosity and yield stress were altered simultaneously from mix to mix. The data imply that both yield stress and plastic viscosity govern pumpability. Increased <b>plastic</b> viscosity of <b>mortar</b> and paste was found to correlate with decreased mortar pumpability. No clear trends could be found for mortar yield stress. Increased paste yield stress was, however surprisingly, related to increased pumpability. The plastic viscosity seemed, however, to dominate yield stress when the two factors varied simultaneously within the given workability range. These parameters should, therefore, not be studied independently. Increased hysteresis area calculated from the paste measurements correlated well with reduced pump flow, also indicating a relation to the rheology of the slip layer. The predicted pressure losses were 5 - 7 times higher than the measured values. This indicates that {{one or more of the}} premises of the Buckingham-Reiner equation are erroneous in these tests, like inhomogeneous fluid and slippage. The existence of a plug is due to yield stress which was observed in both matrix and mortar. The combination of instrumented steady state pumping, concentric viscometre, parallel plate viscometer and visualized boundary flow rate were used to estimate slip layer thickness. The modified Buckingham Reiner equation resulted in slip zone thickness in the order of 0. 6 – 1 mm. The thicknesses were not sensitive to variations in matrix yield stress, whereas plastic viscosity had a major effect as shown in plots of slip zone viscosity vs slip zone thickness. At the slip zone thickness corresponding to the matrix rheology, the calculated specific viscosities (Pa•s/m) were all similar to the lowest values reported by Kaplan (2001). The average rates of shear in the thinnest slip zone were estimated to be as high as 1000 [s- 1]. This is much higher than those used in the parallel plate viscometer [100 s- 1] and future parallel plate viscometre test made in conjunction with studies of this kind should be carried out to 1000 [s- 1]. Based on a few flow profile calculations and comparison with visualized profiles it seems reasonable to assume that the rheological properties of the concrete are not constant, but vary over the cross section of the tube and possibly also along the tube due to factors such as tixotropic behaviour, possibly shear thickening, stiffening, wall effects and/or segregation under shear. Some investigations of effect of pumping on compressive strength were made by measuring strength on cubes made from concrete before and after pumping. These showed negligible effects of pumping on strength. Further research recommendations are given. © Copyright SINTEF Building and Infrastructure 201...|$|R
