Using the estimation results of our ex-dividend analysis and estimates of corporate tax rates on retained and distributed profit we find that investors have shifted from capital gains <b>preference</b> to <b>dividend</b> <b>preference.</b> The reason for this outcome is the tax advantage of distributed profit in corporate taxation which has outweighted the tax disadvantage of dividend income in personal taxation. ...|$|R

The analysis jointly focuses on the tax-based preferences of five categories of shareholders, including both domestic and foreign-domiciled shareholder classes. Incorporating the dividend franking percentage as a direct measure {{of the degree of}} tax benefit associated with dividends, strong evidence supporting the existence of tax-based dividend clienteles is present for both domestic and foreign shareholder categories. This includes domestic corporate blockholders and company directors, and local institutional investors following tax reforms in 2000, and foreign institutional shareholders which, alternatively, demand lower dividends and dividend franking.

40|$|We study stock {{holdings}} {{and trading}} behavior {{of more than}} 60, 000 households and find evidence consistent with dividend clienteles.

Finally, consistent with the behavioral “attention ” hypothesis, we document that older and low-income investors purchase stocks following dividend announcements. MORE THAN 40 YEARS AGO Miller and Modigliani (1961) argued that dividend clienteles could form based on investor characteristics.

40|$|We survey 384 CFOs and Treasurers, {{and conduct}} {{in-depth}} interviews {{with an additional}} two dozen, to determine the key factors that drive dividend and share repurchase policies. Consistent with Lintner (1956), we find that managers are very reluctant to cut dividends, that dividends are smoothed through time, and that dividend increases are tied to long-run sustainable earnings but much less so {{than in the past}}. Managers are less enthusiastic than in the past about increasing dividends and see repurchases as an alternative. Paying out in the form of repurchases is viewed by managers as more flexible than using dividends, permitting a better opportunity to optimize investment.

40|$|We propose and {{implement}} a new test of the dividend signaling hypothesis {{that is designed to}} discriminate between dividend signaling and other theories that would account for the apparent existence of a <b>dividend</b> <b>preference.</b> Our test refines the use of data on stock price responses to dividend announcements. In particular, we study the effect of dividend taxation on the bang-for-the-buck, which we define as the share price response per dollar of dividends. Most dividend signaling models imply that an increase in dividend taxation should increase the bang-for-the-buck. In contrast, other <b>dividend</b> <b>preference</b> theories imply that an increase in dividend taxation should decrease the bang-for-the-buck.

Our central finding {{is that there is a}} strong positive relationship between dividend tax rates and the bang-for-the-buck.
