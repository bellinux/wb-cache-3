25|$|Africa's {{geography}} {{makes it}} {{particularly vulnerable to}} climate change, and seventy per cent of the population rely on rain-fed agriculture for their livelihoods. Tanzania's official report on climate change suggests that the areas that usually get two rainfalls in the year will <b>probably</b> <b>get</b> more, and those that get only one rainy season will get far less. As of 2005, the net result {{was expected to be}} that 33% less maize—the country's staple crop—would be grown.|$|E
25|$|When Benaud won the toss on a {{pitch that}} looked rather inanimate {{most of us}} thought that Australia would <b>probably</b> <b>get</b> about 500 runs against an English attack which {{for the most part}} was devoid of fire, venom and guile. Previous matches had shown that the off-spinners might toil and spin but that they could not turn. Knight, always short of a length, should not on a good pitch worry any batsmen of even average class. Statham had seemed rather lethargic: {{certainly}} not the Statham of other years... Thinking over the game later on, one wondered how this bowling on a dead pitch succeeded in dismissing Australia for 404 runs.|$|E
25|$|It was {{initially}} decided that Arthur {{would not go}} to prison for stealing the Christmas club money, until a legal advisor to the programme suggested that EastEnders would not be portraying a likely outcome. In reality he would <b>probably</b> <b>get</b> twenty-eight days in prison, so that others could be taught a lesson, and so {{that is what happened}} on-screen. The episode where Arthur was sent to prison was written by Bill Lyons, and dominated by Arthur's trial. A special court set had to be hired, but it was too large to fit into the regular EastEnders studio at Elstree, and needed an extra studio. The episode cut {{back and forth between the}} trial and the regular goings-on in the Square before climaxing with the shock decision of the judge, who told Arthur that, as he had betrayed people's trust he must be seen to be punished, and she sentenced him to twenty-eight days.|$|E
50|$|The other No Man's Heath in England <b>probably</b> <b>gets</b> {{its name}} from lying close to four {{different}} counties. Similarly this settlement <b>probably</b> <b>gets</b> {{its name from}} straddling four different civil parishes: Malpas, Hampton, Bickley and Macefen.|$|R
50|$|This {{book was}} {{published}} less than two decades after Portuguese colonial rule ended. This <b>probably</b> <b>gets</b> reflected {{in the attempt to}} be extra-critical of Portuguese rule, while play-up the positive changes brought in post-1961.|$|R
50|$|Originally {{known as}} Thorp (a once common village name meaning hamlet or small village), it most <b>probably</b> <b>gets</b> {{its name from}} being owned by Helewise de Perrow who was an early {{landowner}} during the 13th century.|$|R
500|$|.....Second, [...] {{would have}} the {{advantage}} of reassuring [...] and making her feel more comfortable during her role.

500|$|IGN's Roth Cornet {{wrote that}} [...] "though it's {{unlikely}} {{to stand out}} {{as one of the}} shrewdest political satires of its time, [...] is a clever, unrestrained and—most importantly—sidesplitting parody that pokes fun at both a vapid media and one of the world's most dangerous dictators." [...] Edward Douglas of ComingSoon.net said the film was [...] "hilarious, but it will <b>probably</b> <b>get</b> us nuked." [...] Jordan Hoffman of The Guardian gave the film three out of five stars and wrote that [...] "if this unessential but agreeable movie really triggered an international response, this is life reflecting art in a major way." ...|$|E
500|$|Compared to [...] "Colonel Homer", Lurleen's {{comeback}} episode [...] "Papa Don't Leech" [...] received rather negative {{reviews from}} television critics. Richard Keller of TV Squad expressed dislike for the episode, stating {{that he hopes}} the show will reconsider {{the next time they}} decide to give a [...] "solo opportunity" [...] to a one-off character [...] "many people don't remember". Robert Canning of IGN said, [...] "there were too few laugh-out-loud moments in this lackluster episode. Overall, it was nice to see Lurleen again, but she'd <b>probably</b> <b>get</b> more laughs in future cameos than in carrying an entire episode." ...|$|E
50|$|Aphaenogaster <b>probably</b> <b>gets</b> most of {{its food}} from tended aphids on the roots of plants, which {{explains}} that they are rarely seen on the surface. The funnel-shaped openings could {{play a role in}} trapping arthropods, which are also eaten.|$|R
50|$|Originally called Linton, {{the village}} <b>probably</b> <b>gets</b> {{its name from}} the Linn (a waterfall) on the river which it grew alongside. It was later called East Linton to {{distinguish}} it from West Linton in Peebleshire when the railways were built.|$|R

500|$|Minogue thought {{people liked}} Charlene {{because she was}} portrayed as an average Australian teenager, {{experiencing}} a difficult relationship with her mother. She continued, [...] "She {{is a bit of}} a rebel and they probably relate to that, and while she has her problems she will always come out on top." [...] Minogue shared some similarities with her character, but thought Charlene was far more outspoken and tomboyish than she was. Minogue liked that Charlene often said what she thought, but joked that if she were in trouble and tried to punch someone like Charlene did, she would <b>probably</b> <b>get</b> [...] "flattened". Minogue also said Charlene was sensitive, but she was unlikely to show it and would [...] "rather die than be caught crying." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{internal}} {{structures of}} the crest of Corythosaurus are quite complex, making possible a call {{that could be used}} for warning or attracting a mate. Nasal passageways of Corythosaurus, as well as Hypacrosaurus and Lambeosaurus are S-shaped, with Parasaurolophus only possessing U-shaped tubes. Any vocalization would travel through these elaborate chambers, and <b>probably</b> <b>get</b> amplified. Scientists speculate that Corythosaurus could make loud, low pitched cries [...] "like a wind or brass instrument", such as a trombone. The sounds could serve to alert other Corythosaurus to the presence of food or a potential threat from a predator. The nasal passages emit low-frequency sounds when Corythosaurus exhaled. The individual crests would produce different sounds, so it is likely that each species of lambeosaurine would have had a unique sound. However, even though the range for different lambeosaurine nasal passages vary, they all probable made low-pitched sounds. This might be because low sounds (below 400 Hz) travel a set distance in any environment, while higher (above 400 Hz) sounds have a larger spread in the distance travelled.|$|E
500|$|The {{other half}} of the army fared worse: lacking guides with local knowledge, it lost many men to hunger and thirst in its wanderings through the deserted borderlands, before {{reaching}} the fertile plains of Cappadocia around Caesarea. After looting the area, they turned south and made for Syria. On their way, they were encountered by a Byzantine force of 12,000, which swiftly called in reinforcements. The Byzantines then attacked at night, defeating the Abbasid army and recovering its loot. The surviving Abbasid troops scattered, with some following one of their leaders, Radad, to Malatya, and some 5,000 under Malik ibn Tawq finding refuge in Qaliqala. It was from the latter group that the Zuqnin chronicler drew his information. The campaign {{is one of the few}} such border raids to be known in detail, and, as the Islamic historian Hugh N. Kennedy comments, [...] "We <b>probably</b> <b>get</b> much closer to the reality of frontier warfare, with its confusions, hardships and failures, in this account than in the brief and sanitised versions provided by the Arabic historians." ...|$|E

5000|$|Thrush {{has been}} portrayed by Bobby Moynihan in {{multiple}} episodes of Saturday Night Live, interacting with White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer (Melissa McCarthy). Thrush credits the SNL portrayal for raising his profile [...] "and <b>probably</b> <b>gets</b> my phone calls answered {{a little bit}} more quickly." ...|$|R
500|$|Cranston's {{performance}} {{was a frequent}} topic in the critiques. Even prior to the airing of the episode, James Hibberd of Entertainment Weekly suggested that the actor's voice would be perfect for an animated television series. VanDerWerff and Carp were amongst the journalists who issued favorable assessments of Cranston's acting. Carp noted that [...] "Cranston's work is even more impressive {{when you consider that}} he not only plays the hero and villain but manages to be funny as both." [...] In addressing [...] "Part II", Carp concluded that [...] "as early as the stunning end of the world sequence, the actor plants the hint of suppressed craziness in Spaceman Drake and it was soon obvious that the just crew would not only be manning a mission to help him combat the mutineers but <b>probably</b> <b>get</b> wrapped up in this nut's dream to terra form Mars." [...] For VanDerWerff, [...] "Cranston is the very best kind of guest voice, fully inhabiting his character but also {{having a lot of fun}} with the jokes. It’s a nice reminder of just how funny Cranston can be, and I hope he gets even more bizarre stuff to do next week." [...] Jonah Gardner of Ology later said, [...] "Bryan Cranston remains a god among men." ...|$|E
500|$|The Food Album has {{received}} mixed reviews from most critics; many felt {{that while the}} album was amusing {{it was not an}} essential release. Allmusic reviewer Johnny Loftus awarded the album three out of five stars and wrote that, [...] "The Food Album is an enjoyable bag of treats. Just don't eat too much, or you'll <b>probably</b> <b>get</b> sick." [...] Likewise, The Rolling Stone Album Guide awarded the album three out of five stars. Anthony [...] of The Buffalo News gave the album a moderately positive review and wrote that, [...] "here are two kinds of people in the world: those who love Weird Al Yankovic and those who can't stand him. Count me among the Weird One's biggest fans, and that's why I flipped out when listening to The Food Album." [...] He concluded that the album was [...] "like reading Mad magazine"; he gave the record three stars out of five. Tim Grobaty of the Press-Telegram, on the other hand, wrote negatively of the album, stating [...] "Yankovic's songs {{are the kinds of things}} that are sort of funny in concept, less funny when you actually hear them once, and increasingly irritating with each subsequent listen [...] his food songs are among his worst." ...|$|E
500|$|According to Bruce, [...] "In Yo Face" [...] was {{originally}} titled [...] "Pie in Yo Face", {{but it was}} decided that the final title sounded better. [...] "The Bone" [...] features surf rock-influenced guitars. According to Bruce, [...] "Mike's beat for this was so fuckin' crazy sounding I {{had no idea what the}} fuck to do with it." [...] "To Catch a Predator" [...] was written during the mixing process, when the group realized that the album needed a song [...] "that attacks an evil". Inspired by the television series To Catch a Predator, the song's lyrics describe Violent J luring pedophiles into his house to violently murder them. According to Bruce, [...] "I could easily see myself killing pedophiles in real life and having no guilt. The only reason I don’t do it is because I'd <b>probably</b> <b>get</b> caught. So its nice to live it out through my music." [...] "Boing Boing", a comedic sex-oriented rap, samples audio from a pornographic film which had previously been sampled by the group on their Tunnel of Love EP. Bruce says that the song was intended as a joke. Some fans interpreted the song as Bruce and Utsler calling themselves ugly, while others believed that they were bragging about how many women they have sex with. Bruce commented [...] "We're not sex symbols, especially not me. If there are girls, they’re there to see Shaggy." ...|$|E

500|$|Magnus [...] "adores her {{daughter}} Ashley, respecting her independence and self-reliance – but that doesn't preclude some occasional mother-daughter friction". Tapping {{has said that}} there is a [...] "huge amount of respect" [...] between the two characters, adding [...] "Ashley knows that when her mother says she needs to do something then she says it for a reason. And Magnus has a huge amount of respect for Ashley because Ashley can do things that she can't." [...] Magnus made a hard choice of having Ashley even though she does not have her mother's longevity, and Magnus would outlive {{her daughter}}. In the first season Magnus recruits Will as her protégé. When asked what Magnus thinks of Will, Tapping stated [...] "I think Helen finds him fascinating. He's so idealistic, she sees in him all the qualities that she admires, but all the qualities that she knows will <b>probably</b> <b>get</b> beaten out of him over the course of time. His idealism and purity of thought and the way he analyses things... she absolutely respects that, but I think she also realises that there's going to come a time when he's going to become a bit jaded... There are a couple of episodes where there's been this bizarre sexual tension between the two of them... but generally there's just a huge healthy respect." [...] During a Blastr interview in 2011, Tapping further explains Magnus' relationship with Will; [...] "I love how this relationship has developed. [...] "It's been a really organic transformation of Will's character and Magnus. To actually bring somebody on board who, initially, it's all about teaching him the ropes. And then as the seasons have gone on he's come into his own. He's come into his own as a scientist. He's come into his own in terms of his relationship with the people in the Sanctuary." [...] Dunne meanwhile stated [...] "there's a nice synchronicity that has formed between the two characters. And really, they're two people that depend on each other for survival. And therefore, that's where the respect comes out of." ...|$|E
500|$|In December 2010, {{following}} Gary Speed's {{departure from}} the job as manager of Sheffield United for the position as the head coach of Wales, Adams {{was one of a}} handful of names linked to the vacant position at United. On Christmas Eve, Vale chairman Bill Bratt announced he had [...] "reluctantly" [...] given Adams permission to talk to Sheffield United. Six days later it was announced that he would be taking the position, and he announced his three aims as manager would be to firstly avoid relegation, to then challenge for promotion, and finally [...] "to develop a structure that will build us a reputation for home grown talent that fans can be proud of in their team". Former United player Alan Cork was installed as his assistant, Cork had worked as Adams' assistant at Fulham, Swansea, Leicester and Coventry. The fourth manager at the club that season, he brought in Dave Bassett in a consultancy role after finding managing the club a bigger task than he had previously assumed. As Adams explained: [...] "When you're manager at Port Vale you <b>probably</b> <b>get</b> three calls a day and one of those is from the wife asking me what time I'm coming home for my tea." [...] His honeymoon period dissipated quickly, as United failed to win in his first eleven games in charge (four draws and seven defeats) and slipped into 23rd spot after letting slip a two-goal lead to lose 3–2 to fellow relegation strugglers Scunthorpe United. Adams told the press that [...] "The fans were singing 'you're not fit to wear the shirt', I cannot disagree with them. That is as disappointing a result as I have ever had in my career." [...] It took three months before he achieved his first win. The victory came on 8 March 2011 (his fourteenth game in charge), as his side came from behind to beat Nottingham Forest 2–1. Sheffield United were relegated to League One at the end of the season, finishing six points short of safety. Adams and United parted company after a meeting with owner Kevin McCabe. McCabe stated that he wished to initiate a [...] "clean sweep at the top and start afresh"; whilst Adams said that whilst he was [...] "very, very disappointed with the decision... I am a Blade and will always be a Blade." ...|$|E
