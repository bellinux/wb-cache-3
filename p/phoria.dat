50|$|Phoropter is {{a common}} name for an {{ophthalmic}} testing device, also called a refractor. It is commonly used by eye care professionals during an eye examination, and contains different lenses used for refraction of the eye during sight testing, to measure an individual's refractive error and determine his or her eyeglass prescription. It also is {{used to measure the}} patients' <b>phorias</b> and ductions, which are characteristics of binocularity.|$|R
50|$|The {{history of}} the phoropter, as a {{binocular}} refracting device which can also measure <b>phorias,</b> ductions, and other traits of binocularity, as distinct from the monocular optometer, which cannot, starts in the mid-1910s, {{with the introduction of}} the Ski-optometer by Nathan Shigon, and the Phoro-optometer by Henry DeZeng. These two inventions, as they continued to improve, were accompanied by a third device, the Greens' Refractor, which entered the market in 1934. European manufacturers were working on similar devices as well.|$|R

25|$|Monovision {{is the use}} of single-vision lenses (one {{focal point}} per lens) to focus an eye (typically the {{dominant}} one) for distance vision and the other for near work.

50|$|Instrument used {{to measure}} the {{associated}} heterophoria (or compensating prism). It consists of a small central fixation letter X surrounded by two letters O, one on each side of X, the three letters being seen binocularly, and two coloured polarized vertical bars in line with the centre of the X which are seen by each eye separately. The instrument can be swung through 90° to measure any vertical fixation disparity. The associated <b>phoria</b> is indicated by the misalignment of the two polarized bars when the subject fixates the X through cross-polarized filters in front of the eyes. The amount of associated <b>phoria</b> is given by the value of the base-in or base-out prism power necessary to produce alignment and the eye. The unit {{can also be used to}} detect suppression.

The two {{groups did not differ}} significantly from each other in visual acuity, cycloplegic refraction, the amount of <b>phorias</b> and tropias, stereo acuity, fusion, or accommodation. Convergence near point > or = 8 cm was, however, statistically more frequent in the dyslexic group. This finding was also significant in the general deficiency subgroup compared with the other subgroups. The most conspicuous common denominator in those with dyslexia was revealed to be the convergence insufficiency type of exodeviation, occurring in 38 % of the general deficiency dyslexic subgroup and in 36 % of the visuomotor dyslexic subgroup.

40|$|The {{altitude}} {{at which}} oxygen supplementation should commence {{to be administered}} to aircrew in South Africa, flying in unpressurised aircraft is 12, 000 feet. Above that altitude effects of reduced tissue oxygen content (hypoxia) become significant. Vision is particularly sensitive to hypoxia, and {{it was decided to}} test visual parameters at 12, 000 feet to see if there were any subtle changes which might impair flight safety. It this were so, the level at which oxygen supplementation should commence would have to be lowered. The visual parameters to be assessed, all important in aviation, were colour vision, contrast sensitivity, and the presence of <b>phorias</b> (potential squints). 37 Healthy volunteers had these parameters assessed in an altitude chamber at ground level, 8, 000 feet and 12, 000 feet. Analysis of the results revealed no clinically significant degradation of vision at 12, 000 feet, and it was concluded that the present altitude at which oxygen supplementation should begin (12, 000 feet) is appropriate. It was advised that further testing should take place in subjects based at sea level. Dissertation (MSc) [...] University of Pretoria, 2006.

40|$|The {{prevalence}} of oculomotor dysfunctions associated with blast-induced mild {{traumatic brain injury}} (mTBI) in warfighters has increased {{as a consequence of}} recent conflicts. This study evaluated the effectiveness of computerized oculomotor vision screening (COVS) in a military population. Oculomotor functions were assessed with COVS and by conventional methods in 20 U. S. military personnel with and 20 without mTBI. The validity of COVS was determined by Pearson correlation and Bland-Altman method or the kappa coefficient. The repeatability of the COVS was assessed with the coefficient of repeatability or the kappa coefficient. The results showed that COVS had high sensitivity and specificity for screening near oculomotor functions. Overall, the COVS showed excellent validity and repeatability for assessing near lateral and vertical <b>phorias,</b> Worth 4 Dot, and fixation, as well as pursuit and saccadic eye movements. Despite the strong Pearson correlation, the Bland-Altman analysis identified minor to moderate discrepancies for both positive and negative fusional vergence and their associated recovery {{as well as for the}} monocular accommodative facility measurements. This study demonstrated that non-eye-care professionals may be able to use the COVS as a tool to efficiently screen oculomotor functions in a military population with or without mTBI...|$|R

30|$|This {{study shows}} that {{reducing}} the time duration to less than one hour would considerably {{increase the number of}} children diagnosed with migraine. One can argue that this time reduction might increase the overlap between the diagnostic criteria of migraine and tension type headaches but it can be easily overcome by adding one common/known migraine trigger and one family member suffering from ICHD 2 migraine to the present diagnostic features. One cannot consider any other diagnoses in these children even if only one of phonophobia or photophobia is present. Other short duration activity affected headaches like cluster headaches and paroxysmal hemicranias, though reported in children, are very rare and no case was diagnosed in this age group during the study period. Short duration mild to moderate non throbbing headaches attributed to uncorrected refractive errors, <b>phorias</b> and tropias were diagnosed when prolonged and tiring near or far focusing precipitated peri orbital pain. Other brief headaches attributed to cough, valsalva, cold, external compression etc. were easy to diagnose clinically and was not a problem differentiating from brief migraine without aura episodes. Children and adolescents complaining of aura like manifestations were not included in this study and benign occipital epilepsies with brief colored auras with automatisms were not a diagnostic consideration in these patients.|$|R
40|$|This {{experimental}} {{study was conducted}} on 14 volunteer female clerks to measure viewing distance variation and related ophthalmological changes in office activities with (session 1) and without (session 2) VDU. A video camera connected to an electronic elaborator {{was used to determine}} eye-screen distance of the VDU operators during the task. Before and after each of the two work sessions far refraction, far <b>phorias,</b> near point of accommodation (APP), and fusional convergence were measured. Blinking rate of each subject was measured by a transducer only during the "VDU session'. The objective measurements of the eye-screen distance, whose range was between 48. 42 and 65. 33 cm, allowed a precise quantification of the occupational visual load during session 1. The accommodation was about 1. 5 - 2 D on average and the fusional convergence 10 - 13 delta on average. The symptomatology shows a number of disturbances in session 1 (71. 4 %) clearly higher than in session 2 (35. 7 %). The study of refraction before and after the task has shown a slight excess of accommodation compared to the theoretical value in both sessions, more marked in session 1. The APP shows no statistical significative variation. A tendency to exophoria was registered at the beginning {{and at the end of}} the trial and the fusional convergence clearly decreased, especially in the first session...|$|R
5000|$|Heterophoria is an eye {{condition}} in which the directions that the eyes are pointing at rest position, when not performing binocular fusion, {{are not the same}} as each other, or, [...] "not straight". There can be esophoria, where the eyes tend to cross inward in the absence of fusion, exophoria, in which they diverge, or hyperphoria, in which one eye points up or down relative to the other. <b>Phorias</b> are known as 'latent squint' because the tendency of the eyes to deviate is kept latent by fusion. A person with two normal eyes has single vision (usually) because of the combined use of the sensory and motor systems. The motor system acts to point both eyes at the target of interest; any offset is detected visually (and the motor system corrects it). Heterophoria only occurs during dissociation of the left eye and right eye, when fusion of the eyes is absent. If you cover one eye (e.g. with your hand) you remove the sensory information about the eye's position in the orbit. Without this, there is no stimulus to binocular fusion, and the eye will move to a position of [...] "rest". The difference between this position, and where it would be were the eye uncovered, is the heterophoria. The opposite of heterophoria, where the eyes are straight when relaxed and not fusing, is called orthophoria.|$|R
