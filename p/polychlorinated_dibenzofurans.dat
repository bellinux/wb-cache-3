40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{discrepancies}} between polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxin to <b>polychlorinated</b> <b>dibenzofuran</b> (PCDD to PCDF) ratios in laboratory and field {{studies in the}} exhaust of combustion sources are not fully explained by available formation models. In this paper we present the results of experimental studies of the surface mediated formation of PCDD/F at the conditions mimicking the combustion cool zone from a mixture of 1, 2 -dichlorobenzene (1, 2 -DCBz) and 2 -monochlorophenol (2 -MCP) over a model surface consisting of 5 % CuO/Silica. The PCDD to PCDF ratio {{was found to be}} strongly dependent on the ratio of chlorinated benzenes to chlorinated phenols and oxygen content. The higher the 1, 2 -DCBz to 2 -MCP ratio, the lower the PCDD to PCDF ratio. PCDFs are formed predominantly from chlorinated benzenes, while chlorinated phenols are responsible for majority of PCDDs. These laboratory results are in general agreement with full-scale measurement and can be used to improve predictive models of PCDD/F formation...|$|R

Nonetheless, elevated EROD activity indicated that birds in Howe Sound were responding to an Ah-receptor-mediated stressor, which was also affecting hematocrit values and possibly vitamin A status. In addition, a low proportion of lymphocytes in individuals across locations in early spring samples was associated with poor body condition. The apparent loss of fitness just prior to the onset of northerly migrations to breeding grounds is of particular concern.

Both tebuconazole and permethrin form PCDD/F during gas-phase oxidation, but much greater yields {{occurred in the}} presence of surrogate ash corresponding to wood treated with copper-based fungicides. The significant yields have implications for the increased toxicity of PCDD/F emissions during fires of wood impregnated by combination of organic and copper-based preservatives. The oxidative pyrolysis of tebuconazole and permethrin over simulated wood ash generated amounts of PCDD/F exceeding those of untreated wood by 3 orders of magnitude. We obtained yields of 1000 ng WHO 97 -TEQ/g tebuconazole and 5500 ng WHD 97 -TEQ/g permethrin when reacting the organochlorines in an oxidizing atmosphere over surrogate wood ash. Gasphase oxidation also produce measurable quantities of PCDD/F, corresponding to 1 ng WHD 97 -TEQ/g tebuconazole and 36 ng WHD 97 -TEQ/g permethrin. In the case of tebuconazole, the present measurements correlate well with those obtained from oxidative pyrolysis of CBA-treated wood in the cone calorimeter.
