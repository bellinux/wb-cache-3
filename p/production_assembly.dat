The sedan was not released in Europe, where similar Toyota models were offered. The second-generation ES was a major sales success, becoming Lexus' best-selling vehicle overall. In its first full year of sales, the ES logged 39,652 units, and throughout the following years of its production run, sales reached near or above that figure. Although the initial US base price was $26,550, this increased to over $30,000 in later years. By 1994, {{in part because of}} the rising yen and high demand, the manufacturer's suggested retail price had increased to $31,200, 19.3 percent more than the original 1992 figure. In 1993, a passenger airbag was added as standard equipment.|$|E
500|$|The Bomb Squad {{worked out}} an {{elaborate}} method {{that involved the}} members assembling different types of sounds in the studio. They proceeded to reconfigure and recontextualize fragments from various sources into their own compositions. Each member brought a different philosophy to composing music, arranging sounds, and working with technology, while sampled material was taken from singles, LP albums, and radio, among other sources. Hank Shocklee called the group [...] "a <b>production</b> <b>assembly</b> line where each person had their own particular specialty." [...] In his words, he came [...] "from a DJ's perspective. Eric [...] is coming from a musician’s perspective. So together, you know, we started working out different ideas." [...] Sadler advocated a more traditional, structured approach to songwriting, while Shocklee's approach was more experimental. As the main lyricist, Chuck D wanted to recontextualize the sampled material into his lyrics and create a theme for the album.|$|E
