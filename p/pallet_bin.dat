40|$|We {{study the}} {{combinatorial}} FIFO stack-up problem. In delivery industry, bins {{have to be}} stacked-up from conveyor belts onto pallets with respect to customer orders. Given k sequences q_ 1, [...] ., q_k of labeled bins and a positive integer p, {{the aim is to}} stack-up the bins by iteratively removing the first bin of one of the k sequences and put it onto an initially empty pallet of unbounded capacity located at one of p stack-up places. <b>Bins</b> with different <b>pallet</b> labels have to be placed on different <b>pallets,</b> <b>bins</b> with the same pallet label have to be placed on the same <b>pallet.</b> After all <b>bins</b> for a <b>pallet</b> have been removed from the given sequences, the corresponding stack-up place will be cleared and becomes available for a further pallet. The FIFO stack-up problem is to find a stack-up sequence such that all pallets can be build-up with the available p stack-up places. In this paper, we introduce two digraph models for the FIFO stack-up problem, namely the processing graph and the sequence graph. We show that there is a processing of some list of sequences with at most p stack-up places if and only if the sequence graph of this list has directed pathwidth at most p- 1. This connection implies that the FIFO stack-up problem is NP-complete in general, even if there are at most 6 <b>bins</b> for every <b>pallet</b> and that the problem can be solved in polynomial time, if the number p of stack-up places is assumed to be fixed. Further the processing graph allows us to show that the problem can be solved in polynomial time, if the number k of sequences is assumed to be fixed. Comment: 18 pages, 7 figure...|$|R
40|$|Lack of {{visibility}} {{of the assets}} in a product supply chain compromises attempts to optimise supply chain management. Increasing the {{visibility of}} these assets presents a relatively unexplored frontier in operations and supply where organisations can create competitive advantage through the opportunities asset visibility offer. This research aims at investigating the key capabilities of asset visibility specifically those associated with returnable transport assets that travel across supply chains carrying material and products e. g. cages, boxes, trays, trolleys and <b>pallet</b> <b>bins.</b> In addition, how these capabilities may influence supply chain visibility and firm performance {{in a way that}} might lead to sustainable competitive advantage is examined. To achieve these objectives, the research develops a two-stage model that is theoretically grounded in the extended resource-based view. Philosophically, the research adopts a critical realist approach using abductive logic. Methodologically, a sequential exploratory strategy for data collection is implemented. A qualitative, indepth site-based case study supported by field expert interviews was conducted as a pilot study. The pilot study findings refined the initial conceptual model derived from literature and informed the next stage of the research. The quantitative phase focused on refining the factors constituting asset visibility capabilities and then testing the relationship between these capabilities and supply chain visibility, performance and sustainable competitive advantage. Key findings are that asset visibility capabilities are shaped through three key capabilities: (1) an asset management capability formed by both core technological aspects related to tracking and tracing technology, and non-technological ones focusing on logistic-related capability; (2) a complementary technological capability comprising of IT infrastructure for supply chain integration; and (3) a complementary nontechnological capability represented through three sub-capabilities: (a) supply chain process integration; (b) focal firm- 3 PL relational orientation; and (c) internal firm integration. The research findings prove a positive relationship between asset visibility capabilities and supply chain visibility. In addition, a positive relationship between these capabilities and sustainable competitive advantage through the mediated effect of supply chain visibility and firm performance, is confirmed.

40|$|Abstract—The {{automation}} of kitting tasks—collecting a set {{of parts}} for one particular car into a kit—has a huge impact in the automotive industry. It considerably increases the automation levels of tasks typically conducted by human workers. Collecting the parts involves picking up objects from <b>pallets</b> and <b>bins</b> as well as placing them in the respective compartments of the kitting box. In this paper, we present a complete system for automated kitting with a mobile manipulator thereby focusing on depalletizing tasks and placing. In order to allow for low cycle times, we present particularly efficient solutions to object perception as well as motion planning and execution. For easy portability to different platforms, all components are integrated into a skill-based framework that is tightly coupled with a task planning component. We present results of experiments at both a research laboratory environment and at the industrial site of PSA Peugeot Citroën serving as a proof of concept for the overall system design and implementation.

40|$|Industrial {{shipment}} of horticultural crops needs a cheaper alternative to controlled atmosphere reefer containers for transportation from Europe to markets of America or Asia. The diffusion membrane system patented by Marcellin {{thirty years ago}} has been recently developed in France. In this work {{the design of a}} model for packaging low quantity of products, and the extrapolation of results to <b>pallets</b> or <b>bins</b> scale has been restudied. Essentially, at chilling storage temperature the O 2 and CO 2 diffusion through the silicone membrane interacts with respiratory activity of the product within the sealed pack, to allow to an optimum equilibrium atmosphere. The size of a membrane of known O 2 and CO 2 permeabilities, able to generate and stabilise recommended atmospheres was calculated. Finally, packages made of an impermeable polymeric sheet with a silicone diffusion window of 1 and 1. 5 dm 2 were applied on 5 kg of ‘Cornabo’ peppers for 21 days at 8 ºC, to generate about 5 - 6 %O 2 and 4 - 5 %CO 2 at the steady sate. Results were compared to air atmosphere at 95 % RH. Cold storage was followed by a shelf life of 4 days at 15 ºC and 60 - 70 % RH. The gas composition changes within packages, sensorial quality, decay and disorders were monitored. After storage with 1 dm 2 membrane the desired atmosphere was achieved, although no equilibrium was reached. However with 1. 5 dm 2, gas composition equilibrated at about 7 %O 2 and 4 %CO 2, being adequate for design purposes. Slightly better sensorial quality and lower decay, without disorders, in modified atmospheres packaged than in control peppers were found. Key words: Packaging design, silicone membrane...|$|R
40|$|Within such {{disciplines}} as Management Science, Information and Computer Science, Engineering, Mathematics and Operations Research, {{problems of}} cutting and packing (C&amp;P) {{of concrete and}} abstract objects appear under various specifications (cutting problems, knapsack problems, container and vehicle loading problems, <b>pallet</b> loading, <b>bin</b> packing, assembly line balancing, capital budgeting, changing coins, etc.), although they all have essentially the same logical structure. In cutting problems, a large object must be divided into smaller pieces; in packing problems, small items must be combined to large objects. Most of these problems are NP-hard. Since the pioneer work of L. V. Kantorovich in 1939, which {{first appeared in the}} West in 1960, there has been a steadily growing number of contributions in this research area. In 1961, P. Gilmore and R. Gomory presented a linear programming relaxation of the one-dimensional cutting stock problem. The best-performing algorithms today are based on their relaxation. It was, however, more than three decades before the first `optimum? algorithms appeared in the literature and they even proved to perform better than heuristics. They were of two main kinds: enumerative algorithms working by separation of the feasible set and cutting plane algorithms which cut off infeasible solutions. For many other combinatorial problems, these two approaches have been successfully combined. In this thesis we do it for one-dimensional stock cutting and two-dimensional two-stage constrained cutting. For the two-dimensional problem, the combined scheme provides mostly better solutions than other methods, especially on large-scale instances, in little time. For the one-dimensional problem, the integration of cuts into the enumerative scheme improves the results of the latter only in exceptional cases. While the main optimization goal is to minimize material input or trim loss (waste), in a real-life cutting process there are some further criteria, e. g., the number of different cutting patterns (setups) and open stacks. Some new methods and models are proposed. Then, an approach combining both objectives will be presented, to our knowledge, for the first time. We believe this approach will be highly relevant for industry...|$|R
40|$|Prototype {{software}} held on {{floppy disk}} with thesis print copy in library. A simulation system for design and optimisation of horticultural packaging systems was developed. This computer-based system is applicable {{to a range}} of horticultural products and package designs and predicts product cooling rate, product weight loss, local in-package relative humidity, and package material moisture properties. A zone definition methodology was developed which related geometric characteristics {{of a wide range of}} packaging systems to specific model input data. The methodology also allowed the important intra- and inter-zonal heat and mass transfer pathways to be delineated and characterised. The model component hierarchy treated the fluid, packaging and product as equally important. This decision, differing from some previous models, was instrumental in achieving both greater flexibility and improved alignment between the modelled system and reality. The dynamic simulation system was developed, with two model components. The pre-cooling (heat transfer) model within the 'Packaging Simulation for Design' software included ten major convective or conductive heat transfer pathways between air, packaging and product. Whilst these were the most significant modes of heat transfer envisaged, not all are necessarily significant for any particular package design. The dynamic bulk storage (mass transfer) model, also within the 'Packaging Simulation for Design' software, included six major mass transfer pathways associated with: packaging material moisture uptake, water vapour transport across packaging and ventilation boundaries, and product mass transfer. In addition, a quasi-steady-state simulation system 'Weight Loss Simulator' was developed. The associated software incorporates a database of packaging configurations, and product specific data. The user inputs only a sub-set of the data needed by the dynamic model. With the exception of in-package fluid velocity, most data needed for using the models could be adequately estimated using previously available methods. An experimental technique was developed for characterisation of airflow distribution within horticultural product packages. This technique used CO 2 as a tracer gas, measuring arrival times at different locations following injection of CO 2 into the air stream entering the package. Several package designs for apples were characterised and inpack air velocities estimated. The heat transfer model was successfully applied {{to a range of}} both small and large packaging units (from single cardboard packs to apple <b>pallets</b> and <b>bins).</b> Both time-temperature data collected as part of this research and data from three external sources were predicted as well as could be expected, taking into account model input data uncertainties. The dynamic and quasi-steady-state mass transfer models were tested for apple and tomato packaging systems (including both commercially used and prototype configurations). Where good quality input data were available, both models accurately predicted the mass loss from product/package systems. Overall, the generalised simulation systems developed in this research were shown to be of sufficient accuracy for confidence to be placed in their application to design, optimisation and comparison of packaging system performance across a range of typical horticultural food cooling and storage operations. Nevertheless, areas for possible improvement are identified. The models may be applicable beyond horticultural commodities, but require testing for other products to substantiate this...|$|R
