The psoralen was covalently attached to the thymidine residue in the oli-gonucleotide as either a furan-side monoadduct, which is formed through the cycloaddition between the 4 ’ 3 ’ double bond of the psoralen and the 5, 6 double bond of the thymidine, or a pyrone-side monoadduct, which is formed through the cycloaddition between the 3, 4 double bond of the psoralen and the 5, 6 double bond of the thymidine. As a comparison, we have also investigated the wavelength-dependent <b>photoreversal</b> of the isolated thymidine-HMT monoadducts. All <b>photoreversal</b> action spectra correlate with the extinction spectra of the isolated monoadducts. In {{the case of the}} pyrone-side monoadduct, two absorption bands contribute to the <b>photoreversal</b> with a quantum yield of 2 X a t wavelengths below 250 nm and 7 X a t wavelengths from 287 to 314 nm. The incorporation of the monoadduct into the D N A oligomer had little effect upon the <b>photoreversal</b> rate. For the furan-side monoadduct at least three absorption bands contribute to the <b>photoreversal.</b> The quantum yield varied from 5 X IOb 2 a t wavelengths below 250 nm to 7 X IO 4 at wavelengths between 295 and 365 nm. In contrast to the case of the pyrone-side monoadduct, the incorporation of the furan-side monoadduct into the DNA oligomer reduced the <b>photoreversal</b> rate constan...|$|E
40|$|Prototrophic mutants {{produced}} by UV light in Escherichia coli K- 12 strains with argE 3 (Oc) and hisG 4 (Oc) defects are distinguished as backmutations and specific nonsense suppressor mutations. In strains carrying a umuC defect, mutants are not produced unless irradiated cells are incubated and then exposed to photoreversing light (delayed <b>photoreversal</b> mutagenesis). The mutants thus produced {{are found to}} be specifically suppressor mutations and not backmutations. The suppressor mutations are primarily glutamine tRNA ochre suppressor mutations, which have been attributed previously to mutation targeted at T = C pyrimidine dimers. In a lexA 51 recA 441 strain, where the SOS mutagenesis functions are constitutive, targeting at dimers is confirmed by demonstrating that the induction of glutamine tRNA suppressor mutations is susceptible to <b>photoreversal.</b> In the same strain induction of backmutations is not susceptible to <b>photoreversal.</b> Thus delayed <b>photoreversal</b> mutagenesis produces suppressor mutations that can be targeted at pyrimidine dimers and does not produce backmutations that are not targeted at pyrimidine dimers. This correlation supports the idea that delayed <b>photoreversal</b> mutagenesis in umuC defective cells reflects a mutation process arrested at a targeting pyrimidine dimer photoproduct, which is the immediate cause of both the alteration in DNA sequence and the obstruction (unless repaired) to mutation fixation and ultimate expression...|$|E

40|$|The {{kinetics}} of the <b>photoreversal</b> {{reaction of}} the M-intermediate of bacteriorhodopsin (bR) was investigated by time-resolved optical absorption spectroscopy and photovoltage measurements using double-flash excitation (a green flash (532 nm) followed by a blue flash (400 nm) after a variable delay). The sign of the photovoltage and the 1 H/ 2 H kinetic isotope effect indicate that the Schiff base is reprotonated by a group between the Schiff base and the extracellular surface, probably Asp 85. Analysis of the kinetic data shows that the charge movement in 150 mM KCl at 12 degrees C is characterized by two components with time constants of approximately 100 ns and approximately 600 ns, respectively, which are independent of the delay time between the flashes and the pH. The amplitudes of the fast and slow components depend on the delay and the pH. The slower component starts {{to contribute to the}} charge movement only after delays longer than 100 micros, is absent at low pH, and increases in amplitude with a pKa of approximately 6. Because the proton release group deprotonates after 70 - 100 micros and has a transient pKa of 5. 8, these results suggest the following assignment: the fast and the combination of fast and slow components represent <b>photoreversal</b> from two M states, with the release group protonated and deprotonated, respectively. The slow phase of the <b>photoreversal</b> starts from a state with the release group deprotonated, and with the pK of Asp 85 elevated, and is probably due to the restoration of the pK of Asp 85 to its initial low value. This provides further evidence for coupling between the pK's of Asp 85 and the release group and suggests that proton release {{is the first step in}} the reprotonation switch. At alkaline pH the amplitude of the electrical signal from the back photoreaction decreases with an apparent pK of 8, without a corresponding decrease in the amount of M. At neutral pH the movement of the positively charged guanidinium group of Arg 82 from a position near the release group on the surface to Asp 85 makes a substantial contribution to the electrical <b>photoreversal</b> amplitude. Above the pK of the release group in the unphotolysed state (approximately 8), Arg 82 stays near the surface, leading to a corresponding signal reduction...|$|E

The protein is synthesized several hours before germ anlage formation. In normal embryos at early blastoderm stages, {{synthesis of}} PI 1 is restricted to posterior embryonic fragments but not to pole cells. In "double-abdomen" embryos, a mirror-image duplication of the abdomen is formed by cells that would otherwise develop into head and thorax. Embryos were programmed for double-abdomen development by UV irradiation of the anterior pole, and half of them were reprogrammed for normal development by subsequent exposure to visible light (<b>photoreversal).</b> Correspondingly, PI 1 was synthesized in anterior fragments of UV-irradiated embryos but not after <b>photoreversal.</b> In a control experiment, UV irradiation of the posterior pole caused neither double-abdomen formation nor PI 1 synthesis in anterior fragments. The identity of PI 1 formed in anterior fragments of prospective double abdomens with the protein found in posterior fragments was revealed by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis and limited proteolysis. Suppression of PI 1 synthesis in anterior fragments of normal embryos is ascribed to the activity of cytoplasmic ribonucleoprotein particles thought to act as anterior determinants...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe {{signaling}} {{state of}} the photoreceptor photoactive yellow protein is the long-lived intermediate I 2 ′. The pH dependence of the equilibrium between the transient photocycle intermediates I 2 and I 2 ′ was investigated. The formation of I 2 ′ from I 2 {{is accompanied by a}} major conformational change. The kinetics and intermediates of the photocycle and of the <b>photoreversal</b> were measured by transient absorption spectroscopy from pH 4. 6 to 8. 4. Singular value decomposition (SVD) analysis of the data at pH 7 showed the presence of three spectrally distinguishable species: I 1, I 2, and I 2 ′. Their spectra were determined using the extrapolated difference method. I 2 and I 2 ′ have electronic absorption spectra, with maxima at 370 ± 5 and 350 ± 5 nm, respectively. Formation of the signaling state is thus associated with a change in the environment of the protonated chromophore. The time courses of the I 1, I 2, and I 2 ′ intermediates were determined from the wavelength-dependent transient absorbance changes at each pH, assuming that their spectra are pH-independent. After the formation of I 2 ′ (∼ 2 ms), these three intermediates are in equilibrium and decay together to the initial dark state. The equilibrium between I 2 and I 2 ′ is pH dependent with a pKa of 6. 4 and with I 2 ′ the main species above this pKa. Measurements of the pH dependence of the <b>photoreversal</b> kinetics with a second flash of 355 nm at a delay of 20 ms confirm this pKa value. I 2 and I 2 ′ are photoreversed with reversal times of ∼ 55 μs and several hundred microseconds, respectively. The corresponding signal amplitudes are pH dependent with a pKa of ∼ 6. 1. <b>Photoreversal</b> from I 2 ′ dominates above the pKa. The transient accumulation of I 2 ′, the active state of photoactive yellow protein, is thus controlled by the proton concentration. The rate constant k 3 for the recovery to the initial dark state also has a pKa of ∼ 6. 3. This equality of the equilibrium and kinetic pKa values is not accidental and suggests that k 3 is proportional to [I 2 ′]...|$|E

40|$|When excision-deficient Escherichia coli {{carrying}} umuC or umuD alleles {{were exposed}} to visible light several hours after ultraviolet irradiation, base-pair-substitution mutations were induced in these normally non-UV-mutable bacteria. It is argued that delayed <b>photoreversal</b> of pyrimidine dimers removes blocks to DNA replication and allows the "survival" and expression of misincorporated bases. A model for UV mutagenesis is proposed with two steps: (i) misincorporation opposite a photoproduct, which can be mediated directly by RecA protein, and (ii) bypass, only the latter process requiring umuD+ and umuC+ alleles. Basal levels of gene products are sufficient {{for at least some}} misincorporation events, although induced levels of umuD and umuC gene products are necessary for the bypass step. umuC bacteria containing the recA 441 allele showed a greater yield of mutants, and those containing recA 430 a reduced yield, following delayed <b>photoreversal.</b> The lexA 51 allele (which results in constitutive derepression of RecA protein production) did not significantly alter the yield of mutants but caused them to appear marginally sooner in a recA 441 umuC strain. These results emphasize that the nature of the RecA protein and not its concentration is paramount in determining the level of misincorporation. Experiments with recA 441 umuC bacteria at 43 degrees C and 30 degrees C suggest that the misincorporation effect is unlikely to be attributable to cleavage of a DNA binding protein such as a repressor or a component of the polymerase complex. Moreover, misincorporation seems to occur without the need for induced synthesis of any other protein under recA control...|$|E
40|$|An {{approach}} to the detection of pyrimidine dimer-DNA glycosylase activity in living cells is presented. Mutants of Escherichia coli defective in uvr functions required for incision of UV-irradiated DNA were infected with phage T 4 denV+ or denV- (defective in the T 4 pyrimidine dimer-DNA glycosylase activity). In the former case the denV gene product catalyzed the incision of UV-irradiated host DNA, facilitating the subsequent excision of thymine-containing pyrimidine dimers. Isolation of these dimers from the acid-soluble fraction of infected cells was achieved by a multistep thin-layer chromatographic system. Exposure of the dimers to irradiation that monomerizes pyrimidine dimers (direct <b>photoreversal)</b> resulted in the stoichiometric formation of free thymine. Thus, in vivo incision of UV-irradiated DNA dependent on a pyrimidine dimer-DNA glycosylase can be demonstrated...|$|E

To identify the crosslinked nucleotide in 16 S RNA. AcVal-tRNA 1 Val- 16 S [32 P]RNA was digested completely with RNase T 1 and the band containing the covalently attached oligonucleotides from tRNA and rRNA was isolated by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The crosslinked oligonucleotide, and the 32 P-labeled rRNA moiety released from it by <b>photoreversal</b> of the crosslink at 254 nm, were then analyzed by secondary hydrolysis with pancreatic RNase A and RNase U 2.

This complex was digested to completion with RNase T 1 and the resulting RNA fragments were labeled at the 3 ' end with [5 '- 32 P]pCp.

However, the quantum yield of proton release increases gradually with increasing ionic strength; it plateaus with a value of 0. 43 +/- 0. 03 at ionic strengths above 200 mM. Changing the ionic strength has no detectable effect on the quantum yield of formation of the M spectral state. It thus appears {{that as many as}} two protons can be released and rebound in each photochemical cycle at high ionic strengths.

Investigation of the origin of cell classes in the vertebrate retina provides support for the notion that cones, rods and bipolar cells all originated from a primordial ciliary photoreceptor, whereas ganglion cells, amacrine cells and horizontal cells all originated from rhabdomeric photoreceptors. Knowledge of the molecular differences between cones and rods, together with knowledge of the scotopic signalling pathway, provides an understanding of the evolution of rods and of the rods ’ retinal circuitry.

Irradiation with shorter-wavelength lights not only accelerates the <b>photoreversal</b> of metaretinochrome to retinochrome but also leads to a slight production of isoretinochrome (13 -cis-retinochrome), yielding a photoequilibrium mixture of three kinds of retinochrome. 13 -cis- and 9 -cis-retinochromes are photosensitive, and are converted into metaretinochrome upon irradiation with orange light. When steadily exposed to orange light {{in the presence of}} a trace of retinochrome-protein, all of the all-trans-, 13 -cis-, and 9 -cis-retinals are catalytically isomerized only to the 11 -cis form, although the reaction rate is reduced in the order of the retinals listed above. In the dark, 9 -cis-retinochrome, like retinochrome, remains unchanged, but both meta- and 13 -cis-retinochromes slowly change to retinochrome. The chromophore of 13 -cis-retinochrome changes directly to the all-trans form, whereas the 11 -cis chromophore of metaretinochrome goes to all-trans mainly through the 13 -cis form. The direct isomerization from 11 -cis to all-trans hardly occurs at temperatures as low as 20 degrees C, and shows high values of the activation enthalpy and entropy changes. Based upon these findings, the role of retinochrome in the photoreception of the visual cells is discussed...|$|E
40|$|We have {{observed}} rapid, light-initiated changes in unbound cytosol ATP and ADP during the rhodopsin-to-metarhodopsin II transition in intact rod outer segments (ROS). Upon illumination of the ROS, ATP is rapidly {{removed from the}} unbound phase of ROS, accompanied by the concomitant release of ADP into the cytosol. The exchange process involves decreases of approximately equal to 0. 5 mM ATP in ROS cytosol ATP content {{in response to a}} saturating flash. At levels of light well below saturation (less than 0. 001 % bleach), the process is highly amplified, with a decrease in cytosol ATP of approximately equal to 2, 000 ATP molecules per absorbed photon per ROS. Rapid time-resolution techniques reveal that cytosol ATP content decreases rapidly, within 250 msec of a saturating flash. Bleaching rhodopsin to metarhodopsin II results in a decrease in cytosol ATP, accompanied by an increase in cytosol ADP, whereas <b>photoreversal</b> of metarhodopsin II by a blue flash reverses the process, increasing ATP concentration to its control level in the dark. The photoreversibility of the ATP decrease during the rhodopsin-to-metarhodopsin II transition establishes a direct link between the state of an early intermediate of photolyzed rhodopsin and the state of a nucleoside triphosphate in intact ROS. The results are consistent with a light-activated exchange of unbound ATP for bound ADP, and we propose, therefore, an ATP/ADP amplification cycle in which metarhodopsin II catalyzes the exchange of ATP for ADP on a nucleotide binding protein...|$|E
40|$|The sunburn {{reaction}} {{is the most}} common consequence of human exposure to ultraviolet radiation (UVR), and is mediated at least in part by interleukin- 6 (IL- 6). The aim {{of this study was to}} determine if DNA is a major chromophore involved in the induction of IL- 6 following UV irradiation of a human epidermoid carcinoma cell line (KB), and of normal human epidermal keratinocytes. We first confirmed that IL- 6 release was associated with enhanced levels of IL- 6 mRNA transcripts. The wavelength dependence for IL- 6 release was then investigated by irradiating the cells at defined wavelengths (254, 302, 313, 334, and 365 nm) with a monochromator. The maximum effect on IL- 6 release was observed at 254 nm with only low levels of induction observed at wavelengths above 313 nm. The wavelength dependence for UV- induced IL- 6 release was similar to that for DNA absorption or for the induction of cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers (CPD). To determine whether UV- induced DNA damage mediated IL- 6 secretion, the role of CPD was investigated by treating keratinocytes with photosomes (photolyase encapsulated in liposomes) followed by photoreactivating light. This <b>photoreversal</b> procedure led to a reduction in the levels of the UVC-induced secretion of IL- 6, which in normal human keratinocytes was unambiguously associated with repair of CPD. We conclude that the release of IL- 6 from human keratinocytes following short-wave UVC and UVB irradiation is mediated by DNA damage and that CPD play an important role in this process...|$|E
40|$|Since the {{discovery}} of ribozymes in the 198 O 2 ̆ 7 s, {{there have been many}} examples of catalytic DNA or RNA that can catalyze a variety of reactions, including phosphodiester bond cleavage, porphyrin metallation and nucleotide synthesis. A novel catalytic DNA (DNAzyme) was generated by in vitro selection that could perform a photochemical reaction, the <b>photoreversal</b> of thymine dimers upon irradiation of light. Photolyase enzymes found in nature catalyse the photorepair of thymine dimers with the aid of sensitizers, such as FADH and tryptophan. Curiously, one DNAzyme, UVlC, could repair thymine dimers without the aid of photosensitizers. UV 1 C was found to be active when using light that was significantly red-shifted relative to that of normal DNA absorbance. Using spectroscopic techniques, it was determined that the red-shifted action spectrum and rate enhancement profile were caused by the presence of a guanine quadruplex in the catalytic core. Further characterization of UV 1 C revealed interesting information on the folding, substrate specificity and enzyme mechanism. Using sequence mutant constructs, it was determined that the 32 ̆ 7 -binding arm of the enzyme could be removed with very little effect on repair rates. Cross-linking reactions determined that the thymine dimer was situated in close proximity, or stacked with the putative guanine quartet. Interestingly, substrates containing uracil dimers with deoxyribose sugar rings were efficiently repaired by UVl C, whereas thymine dimer substrates containing ribosyl sugar rings were not. Oxidative damage to guanines was not detected, which implied that a fast rate of back electron transfer may have occured after the thymine dimer photosplitting process. DNA "aptamers" (binders) were generated by in vitro selection that could simultaneously bind to the electron transfer protein cytochrome c, and to the small metalloporphyrin, hemin. Aptarners selected contained guanine-rich sequences located centrally with respect to the overall sequence. Chemical probing analysis determined that a central guanine-quadruplex formed that was responsible for binding to hemin. Through footprinting analysis, the binding site for cytochrome c on the DNA was determined. The ternary complex represents a potential model for the study of electron transfer between artificial and naturally-occurring heme electron transfer systems...|$|E
40|$|The {{ability of}} a number of calcium {{antagonistic}} drugs including nitrendipine, D 600, and D 890 to block contractures in single skinned (sarcolemma removed) muscle fibers of the frog Rana pipiens has been characterized. Contractures were initiated by ionic substitution, which is thought to depolarize resealed transverse tubules in this preparation. Depolarization of the transverse tubules is the physiological trigger for the release of calcium ion from the sarcoplasmic reticulum and thus of contractile protein activation. Since the transverse tubular membrane potential cannot be measured in this preparation, tension development is used as a measure of activation. Once stimulated, fibers become inactivated and do not respond to a second stimulus unless allowed to recover or reprime (Fill and Best, 1988). Fibers exposed to calcium antagonists while fully inactivated do not recover from inactivation (became blocked or paralyzed). The extent of drug-induced block was quantified by comparing the height of individual contractures. Reprimed fibers were significantly less sensitive to block by both nitrendipine (10 degrees C) and D 600 (10 and 22 degrees C) than were inactivated fibers. Addition of D 600 to fibers recovering from inactivation stopped further recovery, confirming preferential interaction of the drug with the inactivated state. A concerted model that assumed coupled transitions of independent drug-binding sites from the reprimed to the inactivated state adequately described the data obtained from reprimed fibers. <b>Photoreversal</b> of drug action left fibers inactivated even though the drug was initially added to fibers in the reprimed state. This result is consistent with the prediction from the model. The estimated KI for D 600 (at 10 degrees and 22 degrees C) and for D 890 (at 10 degrees C) was approximately 10 microM. The estimated KI for nitrendipine paralysis of inactivated fibers at 10 degrees C was 16 nM. The sensitivity of reprimed fibers to paralysis by D 600 and D 890 was similar. However, inactivated fibers were significantly less sensitive to the membrane-impermeant derivative (D 890) than to the permeant species (D 600), which suggests a change in the drug-binding site or its environment during the inactivation process. The enantomeric dihydropyridines (+) and (-) 202 - 791, reported to be calcium channel agonists and antagonists, respectively, both caused paralysis, which suggests that blockade of a transverse tubular membrane calcium flux is not the mechanism responsible for antagonist-induced paralysis. The data support a model of excitation-contraction coupling involving transverse tubular proteins that bind calcium antagonists...|$|E

The kinetic and activation parameters indicate that solvent displacement by CO involves an interchange mechanism for the Cr(CO) 6 system, while for the Mo(CO) 6 and W(CO) e systems the mechanism is more associative in character. The photochemistry of (rj 6 - 2, 6 -X 2 C 5 H 3 N) Cr(CO) 3 was investigated both in low-temperature matrices (X = H, (CH 3) 3 Si) and in room temperature solution (X = H, CH 3, or (CH 3) 3 Si) Room temperature photolysis (k^c > 410 nm) of (t] 6 -pyndine) Cr(CO) 3 in CO saturated methanol yielded ('n 1 -pyndme) Cr(CO) 5 which subsequently formed Cr(CO) 6 in a secondary photochemical process The efficiency of this reaction is reduced in cyclohexane, or when X = CH 3 rather than X = H Photolysis in low temperature matrices resulted in an i f to rł haptotropic rearrangement of pyridine (Acxc - 460 nm, X = H) Visible irradiation in a CO-doped methane matrix produced (t| 1 -pyndine) Cr(CO) 5 while in N 2 matrix/ac-(Vi>yndine) (N 2) 2 Cr(CO) 3 is formed Irradiation with A*« = 308 nm produced both the nng-slip product and also the CO-loss product (rj 6 -pyndine) Cr(CO) 2 Time resolved infrared spectroscopy in cyclohexane revealed only the CO-loss product = 308 nm, X = H) The apparent difference in roomtemperature and low-temperature photochemistry is explamed by the rapid regeneration of the parent species from the r| ^intermediate This explanation is supported by the laser flash photolysis experiments = 355 nm) in CO-saturated cyclohexane (S), where the recovery of the (r| 6 -pyndine) Cr(CO) 3 absorption follows a biphasic time profile, whereby the faster process was assigned to the r|l to rf rearrangement and the slower to the {{reaction of}} (r| 6 -pyndine) Cr(CO) 2 (S) with CO When the matrix photochemistry was investigated in a CO-doped matrix, where X = (CH 3) 3 Si, no pentacarbonyl or hexacarbonyl species were obtained Both the nng-slip and the CO-loss product were formed following irradiation with = 308 nm, and both were sensitive to <b>photoreversal</b> with white light, which may explain the lack of photoproducts following long wavelength photolysis. Crystals of (ti 6 - 2, 6 -X 2 C 5 H 3 N) Cr(CO) 3 (X - H, CH 3, or (CH 3) 3 Si) were characterised by X-Ray diffraction. When X = H or CH 3 an eclipsed conformation is adopted, where the carbonyl ligands eclipse the carbon atoms. When X = (CH 3) 3 Si the more common conformation where the carbonyl groups are in a staggered conformation and eclipse the ring bond centres is adopted.
