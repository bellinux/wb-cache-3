50|$|Located in {{a central}} {{position}} on the Walker street boundary of the hospital site are four substantial rendered masonry gate <b>posts</b> with cast iron palisade gate. The central two gate <b>posts</b> are larger than the flanking <b>posts</b> and all feature steeply pitched double gabled cap.

30|$|Entertainment <b>posts,</b> which {{aimed to}} amuse or bring enjoyment, were next most common, {{comprising}} 78 (31 %) of all <b>posts.</b> The humor <b>posts</b> accounted for 59 (23 %) of all <b>posts</b> in the study. Most humor <b>posts</b> were images (e.g., either cartoons or memes) with captions and were typically related to either math or teaching. Some <b>posts</b> were shared by members, but most {{came from the}} faculty administrator.

30|$|Table  1 {{illustrates}} the total <b>posts</b> uploaded {{by the four}} political parties across the six-week period. The frequency of <b>posts</b> is higher in the In-dataset {{as compared to the}} Sw-dataset. Furthermore, the volume of <b>posts</b> differs across the parties: Socialdemokraterna have the fewest <b>posts.</b> While a total of 111 videos were <b>posted</b> by In political parties, the total number of videos <b>posted</b> in the Sw-dataset was only 40. This gap is also valid for infographics: In political parties <b>posted</b> 245 infographics, and Sw parties <b>posted</b> 51 infographics. In the data regarding live-videos, the total numbers <b>posted</b> by the BJP was over three times those observed in the Sw-dataset. A sharp contrast can also be noted with regards to photographs: the In parties <b>posted</b> six times the total uploaded by the Sw parties.|$|R
5|$|Another {{part of the}} 5th Division had {{gathered}} unseen below Courtnay's <b>Post,</b> which was held by the 14th Battalion, and at 04:00 they rushed the trench, throwing hand grenades. The <b>post</b> was only defended by an Australian section, two of whom were killed and another two wounded; as the Turks occupied {{that part of the}} <b>post</b> the surviving Australians retreated. The Turks were now in a position to observe and bring fire down on Monash Valley. However, from another section of the <b>post</b> Private Albert Jacka led a small group of men in a counter-attack on the Turks. Jacka shot five of the Turks, bayoneted another two, and chased the rest out of the <b>post.</b> For this feat he was awarded the Victoria Cross.|$|E
5|$|At 03:00, {{just before}} dawn, Spragg took {{command of the}} trench in the {{southern}} sector of No.3 <b>Post,</b> opposite where the Turks appeared to be gathering their forces to assault the <b>post.</b> He successfully deployed his men {{so that when the}} attack began, it was met and broken up by the New Zealanders' small arms fire. But by 03:30 the <b>post</b> was under sustained Turkish rifle and grenade attack and the relieving 2nd Squadron was still held up on a ridge to the south of the <b>post.</b> Between them and No.3 <b>Post</b> was a strong Turkish force which had dug in and were in communication with the Turkish attackers in the gully {{to the north of the}} <b>post.</b> However, the 2nd Squadron could now bring their own small arms fire onto the Turks attacking No.3 <b>Post,</b> making them keep their heads down. At daylight Elmslie led a troop in an attack which captured a Turkish trench to the left of the <b>post.</b> At 06:30 communications were re-established with No.3 <b>Post</b> by using signal flags, and Allied artillery were able to bring harassing fire onto the Turkish communications trenches. But by now the defenders were running short of supplies, especially ammunition, and no one could be spared to look after the wounded, who had to see to themselves.|$|E
5|$|Beilhart {{became friends}} with C. W. <b>Post,</b> who was a patient at the sanitarium, but <b>Post</b> was healed by a Christian Science faith healer, Mrs Elizabeth K. Gregory.

50|$|Another key {{difference}} is the goal <b>posts.</b> Rugby union <b>posts</b> consists of two <b>posts</b> with a crossbar but without a net, whereas Gaelic football consists of two <b>posts</b> with crossbar and a net.
