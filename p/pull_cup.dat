Compared to controls, {{they found that}} patients included {{in the experimental group}} had increased eruption of the mandibular incisors, decrease of the ramal inclination, decrease of the mandibular plane, increase of the overbite, decrease of the gonial angle and increase of the mandibular corpus inclination were found. They stated that vertical chin cup maybe effective in treating skeletal open bite patients. However, Pedrin et al used removable plate with palatal crib and combined it with a high-pull chin cup in 30 patients for 12 months and compared it to 30 patients who were followed with no treatment. They found that no positive skeletal influence on the vertical facial pattern of patients treated for open bite in the mixed dentition by their stated protocol. Another study stated that there is no positive effect of vertical <b>pull</b> chin <b>cup</b> in controlling the vertical facial height and that close of an anterior open bite was mostly done by dentoalveolar changes.|$|R

40|$|Buffalo {{farming in}} Italy is {{traditionally}} oriented towards mozzarella cheese production {{and over the}} last decade it has been rapidly increased. As a result, intensive techniques and mechanisation of farm activities have been introduced. Those sudden changes in rearing techniques have aroused a general concern about buffaloes welfare and its possible consequences on products quality. Human-animal interactions are recognized {{to have an impact on}} productivity, behaviour and welfare, particularly in dairy farms, where the milking process involves a close interaction with a human handler. Focusing on the first month of lactation, this preliminary study aimed at evidencing buffalo behavioural responses to machine milking. Relationship between behaviour and oxytocin administrations, often performed to allow milk let down, has been also investigated. The experiment included 8 multiparous and 6 primiparous buffaloes, calving in the same period. Starting from the first entrance in the milking parlour, the animals were followed two days/ week during the morning milking for the first 5 weeks of lactation. Behaviour observation was performed following a “focal animal sampling” (continuous recording) technique. Proportional frequencies of the following behaviours were calculated: kicking, stepping, defecating, urinating, vocalizing, <b>pulling</b> the teat <b>cup</b> off the teats. The exogenous oxytocin administration at milking was recorded. Pearson Chi-Square test was used to verify the presence of differences between primiparous and multiparous cows’ behaviour at milking. Cochran’s Q test was used to assess the variability of behaviour over time and a binomial regression was performed in order to verify the correlations between animal behaviours and the need to administer oxytocin. Considering lactation number, every behavioural pattern in primiparous cows, except for stepping, resulted to be more frequently performed (36. 67 % vs 24. 36 % for kicking; 5 % vs 2. 56 % for defecating; 11. 67 % vs 5. 13 % for <b>pulling</b> the teat <b>cup</b> off the teats). The behaviour of urinating (48. 33 % vs 11. 54 %) proved to have a significantly higher mean frequency of occurrence compared to the multiparous one (P< 0. 001). The frequency of oxytocin administration showed a high variability over time (P< 0. 001), soon decreasing, while the selected behaviours proved to be more stable in time, except for kicking and urinating (P< 0. 05). Some correlations between animal behaviour at milking and oxytocin administration were found; particularly kicking, stepping and urinating appeared to be significantly related to the requirement of exogenous molecule (P< 0. 001). The occurrence of behaviours considered as indicators of acute stress and their correlation with oxytocin administration are a clear proof of the machine milking impact on buffaloes welfare and productivity...|$|R
40|$|Objective: Hot {{beverage}} scalds are {{a leading}} cause of burns in young children. The aim {{of this study was to}} look at the circumstances surrounding these injuries in terms of setting, mechanism, supervision and first aid to inform a prevention campaign. Methods: A cross-sectional study was delivered via iPad to parents and caregivers presenting with a child aged 0 – 36 months with a hot beverage scald at a major paediatric burns centre. Results: Of the 101 children aged 0 – 36 months that presented with a hot beverage scald over a 12 -month period, 54 participants were included. The scald aetiology was as expected with the peak prevalence in children aged 6 – 24 months, <b>pulling</b> a <b>cup</b> of hot liquid down over themselves. The majority of injuries occurred in the child’s home and were witnessed by the caregiver or parent. The supervising adult was often in close proximity when the scald occurred. Less than a third (28 %) of participants received recommended first aid treatment at the scene, with an additional 18 % receiving this treatment with three hours of the injury— usually at an emergency department. Conclusions: While the aetiology of these scalds were as expected, the low use of recommended burn first aid was of concern. Although supervision was present in almost all cases, with the parent/caregiver close-by, this proximity still permitted injury. Attentiveness and continuity of supervision, which can be difficult with competing parental demands, appear to play a more important role role; as do considerations of other safety mechanisms such as hazard reduction through keeping hot drinks out of reach and engineering factors such as improved cup design. By incorporating the findings from this study and other research into a hot beverage scald prevention campaign, we hope to see a change in knowledge and behaviour in parents and caregivers of young children, and ultimately a reduction in the incidence of hot beverage scalds.

On November 15, 2007, former Red Star goalkeeper legend {{and member of the}} Intercontinental Cup winner generation of 1991, Zvonko Milojević, was involved in a car accident in Germany in which he received severe injuries (as of 2009, he's still recuperating and fighting to regain the strength needed to walk again). Red Star entered the 2007/08 season with clear ambitions, which, again, were inevitable at the Marakana - to defend their double crown and to play competitively in Europe.

40|$|The SARS (severe acute {{respiratory}} syndrome) {{outbreak of}} 2006 {{and fears of}} avian influenza have sensitized many to the risks of transmission of especially viral illnesses during air travel. People worry about recirculated air, and some wear masks during trips. On several recent flights I have noticed another likely means of viral transmission: careless hygiene practices by flight attendants serving drinks. Using hands I never see washed or cleaned with waterless cleaners, and after handling money required {{for some of the}} drinks, the attendants <b>pull</b> stacks of <b>cups</b> out of their plastic wrappers and handle the cups by the rims when serving the drinks. Rims are the business ends of the cups 9 ̆ 7 to which we apply our mouths when drinking. Wiser practice would be to place the cups upside down and keep them in their plastic sleeves on the cart, pull them out handling only the bottom outside surfaces of the cups, and never touch the rims from which we drink. The containers from which the drinks are served should always have openings that don 9 ̆ 2 t require handling the area over which the liquid flows when poured (think about how we handle milk-carton-type containers in which some kinds of orange juice are packaged). Similar practices should apply in restaurants. Americans fly about 650 million domestic air trips annually. The number of meals eaten out annually is about 100 billion. Observe how your waiters handle pitchers and drinking glasses next time you eat in a restaurant. Does your waiter hold the water glass by the rim as he serves it? Does he place the water pitcher on the table and lean against it with his hands {{on the rim of the}} pitcher while pleasantly chatting with you? If so, he is putting his customers at risk from germs transmitted from his hands, from other customers, from handled money, or from his own nose and skin. The message about the critical importance of hand washing in health care settings may finally be getting enough attention to turn heads and decrease nosocomial infection rates. The cleaning products industry has developed many new, quick, easy methods for sanitizing. But my observations suggest that common sense and thoughtful application of what we know about disease transmission 9 ̆ 7 not only in the hospital setting but also in our everyday lives 9 ̆ 7 are lacking. We practicing physicians need to carry our greater mindfulness about sensible hygiene from the hospital and clinic out into the community. It is a matter of social responsibility and public health. The costs of the common cold and viral gastroenteritis in the US are each estimated at about 40 billion annually. 1, 2 In 10...|$|R
