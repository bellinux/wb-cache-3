The most popular audio device in history, the transistor radio changed listening habits, allowing people to listen to radio anywhere. [...] The earbud uses either a moving iron driver or a piezoelectric crystal to produce sound. [...] The 3.5mm radio and phone connector, which is the most commonly used in <b>portable</b> <b>application</b> today, has been used at least since the Sony EFM-117J transistor radio which was released in 1964. Its popularity was reinforced with its use on the Walkman portable tape player in 1979.|$|E

40|$|Power {{electronics}} and fuel cell technologies {{play an important}} role in the field of renewable energy. The demand for fuel cells will increase as fuel cells become the main power source for <b>portable</b> <b>applications.</b> In this application, a high-efficiency converter is an essential requirement and a key parameter of the overall system. This is because the size, cost, efficiency, and reliability of the overall system for <b>portable</b> <b>applications</b> primarily depend on the converter. Therefore, the selection of an appropriate converter topology is an important and fundamental aspect of designing a fuel cell system for <b>portable</b> <b>applications</b> as the converter alone plays a major role in determining the overall performance of the system. This paper presents a review of power electronics applications in fuel cell systems, which include various topology combinations of DC converters and AC inverters and which are primarily used in fuel cell systems for <b>portable</b> or stand-alone <b>applications.</b> This paper also reviews the switching techniques used in power conditioning for fuel cell systems. Finally, this paper addresses the current problem encountered with DC converters and AC inverter...|$|R
