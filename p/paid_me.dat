[...] Beacham, a mother of two infant children, agreed to appear in the film to support her family: [...] "I had to choose between a play that I really, really wanted to do, which would have <b>paid</b> <b>me</b> £65 a week, and this script for a film called Inseminoid.

500|$|To {{illustrate}} the edition {{and to provide}} images for the folio, Boydell obtained {{the assistance of the}} most eminent painters and engravers of the day. Artists included Richard Westall, Thomas Stothard, George Romney, Henry Fuseli, Benjamin West, Angelica Kauffman, Robert Smirke, John Opie, and Boydell's nephew and business partner, Josiah Boydell. Among the engravers were Francesco Bartolozzi and Thomas Kirk. Boydell's relationships with his artists, particularly his illustrators, was generally congenial. James Northcote praised Boydell's liberal payments. He wrote in an 1821 letter that Boydell [...] "did more for the advancement of the arts in England than the whole mass of the nobility put together! [...] He <b>paid</b> <b>me</b> more nobly than any other person has done; and his memory I shall every hold in reverence".|$|E

500|$|Boydell's {{relationships}} with his illustrators were generally congenial. One of them, James Northcote, praised Boydell's liberal payments. He {{wrote in an}} 1821 letter that Boydell [...] "did more {{for the advancement of}} the arts in England than the whole mass of the nobility put together! [...] He <b>paid</b> <b>me</b> more nobly than any other person has done; and his memory I shall ever hold in reverence". Boydell typically paid the painters between £105 to £210, and the engravers between £262 and £315. Joshua Reynolds at first declined Boydell's offer to work on the project, but he agreed when pressed. [...] Boydell offered Reynolds carte blanche for his paintings, giving him a down payment of £500, an extraordinary amount for an artist who had not even agreed to do a specific work. [...] Boydell eventually paid him a total of £1,500.|$|E
500|$|In an {{interview}} with [...] FT Magazines Rosie Millard, Hedren discussed Hitchcock's attitude towards her after {{she decided not to}} work for him again: [...] "He did ruin my career. He kept me under contract, <b>paid</b> <b>me</b> to do nothing for close on two years." [...] Hitchcock sold her contract to Universal Studios, which dismissed her when she refused to work on one of its television shows. However, her acting career continued and she appeared in a number of film and television productions. Hedren said that while she was still under contract to Hitchcock, he turned down several film roles on her behalf, and was particularly disappointed when she heard from French director François Truffaut that he had wanted her for his film Fahrenheit 451. Truffaut's daughter Laura disputed this, telling Tony Lee Moral her mother had expressed surprise at the mention of Hedren's possible involvement in the project. Laura Truffaut was also sceptical of the story. [...] "It is extremely unlikely in my view that my father seriously entertained this project without sharing it with my mother as he was not secretive about the other actors who were considered for casting." ...|$|E

Garrison reported, [...] "its seven-foot propeller missed me by a foot, but chopped most of Melmoth into scraps". He went on to take note of the damage, [...] "everything that I built {{was destroyed}}. Everything that I bought off somebody's shelf—the engine, the avionics, the instruments—survived...I kept the remains for a year, and then, after salvaging what I could, sold the empty hulk to a metal dealer to be shipped to Taiwan and converted into heaven knows what.

2500|$|Another {{negative}} {{effect of the}} pig cull on the Zabbaleen was {{the loss of the}} economic value of the pigs themselves. According to Fahmi and Sutton, pigs are the main source of income for the Zabbaleen. Before the cull, the Zabbaleen had collected 6,000 tons of MSW daily, of which 60 percent was organic waste which was consumed by the pigs. Every six months, the Zabbaleen would take their pigs to traders, earning around 450LE (approximately 80 USD) per pig. Although the Egyptian government made financial compensations for some of pigs slaughtered; compensations were not given to all of the Zabbaleen who lost pigs to the cull and those who received compensation received far less money compared to what they would have received [...] from selling the pigs to traders. According to one Zabbaleen pig breeder, [...] "The government <b>paid</b> <b>me</b> between LE 50 (US$ 10) and LE 250 (US$ 50) for each pig I lost, depending on its size, whilst meat processors would have given me as much as LE 1,000 (US$ 200)." [...] The pig cull also resulted in increased cases of malnutrition and anaemia in Zabbaleen children because prior to the cull, pork had been the only affordable source of animal protein for most of the Zabbaleen.|$|E

2500|$|In late 2005, Helmet {{were dropped}} by Interscope {{following}} lacklustre sales for Size Matters. Helmet then signed with Warcon Enterprises {{and announced that}} a new album was in the works. Helmet performed at the 2006 SXSW festival in Austin, Texas, with a temporary lineup consisting of Charlie Walker on drums, Chris Traynor on bass, and Anthony Truglio (formerly of Gandhi) on guitar. The new album, Monochrome, was recorded and co-produced by Wharton Tiers, who recorded Helmet's first two albums, Strap It On and Meantime. For the album, Hamilton and Traynor returned to the studio with newly recruited drummer, Mike Jost (formerly of Adair). Helmet headlined the 2006 Warped Tour in support of Monochrome, with Jeremy Chatelain reprising his role from the 2005 Size Matters tour. The band later split with Warcon due {{to a variety of}} financial disputes between Hamilton and the label's owners. Hamilton stated [...] "Amphetamine Reptile and Interscope were both fantastic experiences for us, and Warcon {{was the first time that}} I’d actually run into any problems with a label. I trusted somebody and got screwed. I’m not bitter about it, but I lost a lot of money. They never <b>paid</b> <b>me</b> tour support that they were contractually obligated to pay. There were a lot of things. I’ve never seen one penny of royalties from them, but I own the record [...] now, so it’s my record." ...|$|E
