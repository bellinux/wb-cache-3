5|$|On April 24, 2003, {{only two}} weeks after the fall of Baghdad, a dozen Turkish special forces were arrested in Da Quq (a tribal village 45 minutes north of Kirkuk). According to Time, a weekly world news magazine, they were wearing {{civilian}} clothes and intended to infiltrate Iraq, lagging behind a humanitarian convoy, in order to destabilize the region to a level where Turkey could reasonably send its own peacekeeping force. However, they were intercepted by American forces, who claimed they had received <b>prior</b> <b>knowledge</b> <b>of</b> the group.|$|E
5|$|Shepard then {{recruits}} former squad member Tali'Zorah, Thane Krios, and Samara (later optionally {{replaced by}} Morinth), before {{being sent to}} explore a supposedly disabled Collector ship. There, Shepard learns that the Collectors were originally Protheans that were turned into slaves of the Reapers. With EDI's help, Shepard also finds out how to bypass the Omega-4 Relay before being ambushed by the Collectors. Although Shepard's squad escape, his/her relationship with the Illusive Man is strained due to his <b>prior</b> <b>knowledge</b> <b>of</b> the trap. After optionally earning the loyalty of the squad, Shepard visits a derelict Reaper and acquires an IFF necessary to safely travel through the Omega-4 Relay. Shepard may also acquire a disabled geth that, if activated, voluntarily joins the squad and is named Legion.|$|E
5|$|Though Nixon {{lost much}} popular support, even {{from his own}} party, he {{rejected}} accusations of wrongdoing and vowed to stay in office. He insisted {{that he had made}} mistakes, but had no <b>prior</b> <b>knowledge</b> <b>of</b> the burglary, did not break any laws, and did not learn of the cover-up until early 1973. On October 10, 1973, Vice President Agnew resigned —unrelated to Watergate— and was convicted on charges of bribery, tax evasion and money laundering during his tenure as Governor of Maryland. Nixon chose Gerald Ford, Minority Leader of the House of Representatives, to replace Agnew. One researcher suggested Nixon effectively disengaged from his own administration after the swearing in of Gerald Ford as Vice President on December 6, 1973.|$|E

5|$|At {{the start}} of development, Nihilistic wanted to support editing of the game by the user-community, having seen the {{benefits}} to the community while working on other games. Staff who worked on Jedi Knight knew the experience of creating a new, customized programming language called COG that gave the programmers the results they wanted but cost time and significant project resources. With Redemption, they wanted to incorporate an existing scripting engine that would more easily enable users to further develop the game instead of developing their own code again, which would consume months of development time. The team tested various languages, but became aware of another studio, Rebel Boat Rocker, which was receiving attention for its use of the Java language. Speaking to that studio's lead programmer Billy Zelsnak, Nihilistic decided to experiment with Java, having little <b>prior</b> <b>knowledge</b> <b>of</b> it. The language successfully integrated into the NOD engine without problems, providing a standardized and freely distributable scripting engine. Several designers were trained to use Java {{to allow them to}} build the several hundred scripts required to drive the game's storyline.|$|E
5|$|In September York {{arrived from}} Ireland, {{and at the}} {{parliament}} of October that year, the duke {{walked up to the}} throne and put his hand on it. The act, signifying usurpation, left the assembly in shock. It is unclear whether Warwick had <b>prior</b> <b>knowledge</b> <b>of</b> York's plans, though it is assumed that this had been agreed upon between the two in Ireland the previous March. It soon became clear, however, that this regime change was unacceptable to the lords in parliament, and a compromise was agreed. The Act of Accord of 31October 1460 stated that while Henry VI was allowed to stay on the throne for the remainder of his life, his son Edward, Prince of Wales, was to be disinherited. Instead, York would succeed the king, and act as protector.|$|E
5|$|Kagame {{spent most}} of his {{childhood}} and young adult years living in Uganda, and has a personal relationship with President Yoweri Museveni dating back to the late 1970s; they fought together in the Ugandan Bush War, and Kagame was appointed head of military intelligence in Museveni's national army following the NRA victory in 1986. When the RPF soldiers abandoned the Ugandan army and invaded Rwanda in 1990, Museveni did not explicitly support them, but according to Prunier it is likely that he had <b>prior</b> <b>knowledge</b> <b>of</b> the plan. Museveni also allowed the RPF safe passage through Ugandan territory to the Virunga mountains after their early defeats in the war, and revealed in a 1998 heads of state meeting that Uganda had helped the RPF materially during the Rwandan Civil War. Following the RPF victory, the two countries enjoyed a close political and trade relationship.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} antecedents of patent {{importance}} {{by looking at}} the <b>prior</b> <b>knowledge</b> set <b>of</b> academic inventors. Using independent methodologies, we distinguish between the scientific knowledge set and the technical knowledge set, and separate these from other kinds of prior expertise. We find that the patents of the inventors who have a <b>prior</b> scholarly <b>knowledge</b> <b>of</b> the topic are on average more important (more cited after 6 years). Conversely, we find an inverted U-shape relationship between prior technical relatedness and patent importance. These results are potentially useful to support the work of practitioners such as university technology managers, which often face difficulties in identifying the importance and perspective value of the disclosed inventions, amid high market and legal uncertainty and budget shortages...|$|R

5|$|The chronicle {{records that}} in 1228, while Óláfr and his chiefs were away from Mann, {{the island was}} {{attacked}} and devastated by Alan, his brother Thomas, Earl of Atholl (d. 1231), and Rögnvaldr. It was only when Alan left with most of his force that Óláfr was able {{to regain control of}} the island. Rögnvaldr sailed from Galloway in the winter of the same year, landed on Mann, and burnt all the ships of Óláfr and his chiefs. The chronicle states that Rögnvaldr stayed at Ronaldsway for forty days; and that he won over the hearts of the southern inhabitants of the island. Óláfr and his forces arrived at Tynwald on 14 February 1229, where they attacked Rögnvaldr and his men. The chronicle claims that Rögnvaldr was treacherously killed by his own men, without the <b>prior</b> <b>knowledge</b> <b>of</b> Óláfr, and also notes that Óláfr never avenged his half-brother's death.|$|E
5|$|After the Second Test, McCabe was {{involved}} in an infamous incident that has caused speculation ever since. His captain Bradman {{was known for his}} reserved personality, did not drink and often eschewed social activities with teammates, preferring to privately listen to music or read. Combined with his success, Bradman gained a reputation for cockiness. In the 1930s, Australia had been divided along sectarian lines, with a sizeable Irish Catholic minority that included McCabe often pitted against Anglicans and/or Protestants such as Bradman (of Anglo-Irish descent), particularly practitioners of Freemasonry, leading to speculation that the tension was fuelled by religion. Four of the five Catholics in the team, McCabe, leading bowler Bill O'Reilly, along with Leo O'Brien and Chuck Fleetwood-Smith were summoned by the Board of Control to respond to allegations that they were undermining Bradman. Bradman denied having <b>prior</b> <b>knowledge</b> <b>of</b> the meeting, although the alleged infighting was reported in the press. Opening batsman Jack Fingleton was not invited, speculated to be due to his journalistic background, but Bradman later alleged that he was the ringleader. After that, Bradman's relationship with O'Reilly and Fingleton never recovered. During the meeting, players were variously accused of undermining Bradman's authority, laziness, lack of attention to fitness, but the board refused to specifically accuse those summoned. The details were leaked to the media, but the board denied that the meeting had taken place. Bradman denied that he was anti-Catholic, saying that O'Reilly and Fingleton wanted to depose him from the captaincy and install McCabe in his place.|$|E

The findings suggest that teachers can facilitate students' comprehension of an expository text corpus by providing appropriate background <b>knowledge</b> <b>of</b> content and strategies for recognizing and utilizing text structure.
