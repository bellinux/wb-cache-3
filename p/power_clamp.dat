40|$|Electrostatic {{discharge}} (ESD) is {{a well-known}} contributor that reduces the reliability and yield of the integrated circuits (ICs). As ICs become more complex, they are increasingly susceptible to such failures due to the scaling of physical dimensions of devices and interconnect on a chip [1]. These failures are caused by excessive electric field and/or excessive current densities and result in the dielectric breakdown, electromigration of metal lines and contacts. ESD can affect the IC in its different life stages, from wafer fabrication process to failure in the field. Furthermore, ESD events can damage the integrated circuit permanently (hard failure), or cause a latent damage (soft failure) [2]. ESD protection circuits consisting of I/O protection and ESD <b>power</b> supply <b>clamps</b> are routinely used in ICs to protect them against ESD damage. The main objective of the ESD protection circuit {{is to provide a}} low-resistive discharge path between any two pins of the chip to harmlessly discharge ESD energy without damaging the sensitive circuits. The main target of this thesis is to design ESD <b>power</b> supply <b>clamps</b> that have the lowest possible leakage current without degrading the ESD protection ability in general purpose TSMC 65 nm CMOS technology. ESD clamps should have a very low-leakage current and should be stable and immune to the power supply noise under the normal operating conditions of the circuit core. Also, the ESD clamps must be able to handle high currents under an ESD event. All designs published in the general purpose 65 nm CMOS technology have used the SCR as the clamping element since the SCR has a higher current carrying capability compared to an MOS transistor of the same area [3]. The ESD <b>power</b> supply <b>clamp</b> should provide a low-resistive path in both directions to {{be able to deal with}} both PSD and NDS zapping modes. The SCR based design does not provide the best ESD protection for the NDS zapping mode (positive ESD stress at VSS with grounded VDD node) since it has two parasitic resistances (RNwell and RPsub) and one parasitic diode (the collector to base junction diode of the PNP transistor) in the path from the VSS to VDD. Furthermore, SCR-based designs are not suitable for application that exposed to hot switching or ionizing radiation [2]. In GP process, the gate oxide thickness of core transistors is reduced compared with LP process counterpart to achieve higher performance designs for high-frequency applications using 1 V core transistors and 2. 5 V I/O option. The thinner gate oxide layer results in higher leakage current due to gate tunneling [4]. Therefore, using large thin oxide MOS transistors as clamping elements will result in a huge leakage. In this thesis, four <b>power</b> supply ESD <b>clamps</b> are proposed in which thick oxide MOS transistors are used as the main clamping element. Therefore, the low-leakage current feature is achieved without significantly degrading the ESD performance. In addition, the parasitic diode of the MOS transistors provides the protection against NSD-mode. In this thesis, two different ESD <b>power</b> supply <b>clamp</b> architectures are proposed: standalone ESD <b>power</b> supply <b>clamps</b> and hybrid ESD <b>power</b> supply <b>clamps.</b> Two standalone clamps are proposed: a transient PMOS based ESD clamp with thyristor delay element (PTC), and a static diode triggered power supply (DTC). The standalone clamps were designed to protect the circuit core against ± 125 V CDM stress by limiting the voltage between the two power rails to less than the oxide breakdown voltage of the core transistors, BVOXESD = 5 V. The large area of this architecture was the price for maintaining the low-leakage current and an adequate ESD protection. The hybrid clamp architecture was proposed to provide a higher ESD protection, against ± 300 V CDM stress, while reducing the layout area and maintaining the low-leakage feature. In the hybrid clamp structure, two clamps are connected in parallel between the two power supply rails, a static clamp, and a transient clamp. The static clamp triggers first and starts to sink the ESD energy and then an RC network triggers the primary transient clamp to sink most of the ESD stress. Two hybrid designs were proposed: PMOS ESD <b>power</b> supply <b>clamp</b> with thyristor delay element and diodes (PTDC), and NMOS ESD <b>power</b> supply <b>clamp</b> with level shifter delay element and diode (NLDC). Simulation results show that the proposed clamps are capable of protecting the circuit core against ± 1. 5 kV HBM and at least against ± 125 V CDM stresses. The measurement results show that all of the proposed clamps are immune against false triggering, and transient induced latch-up. Furthermore, all four designs have responded favorably to the 4 V ESD-like pulse voltage under both chip powered and not powered conditions and after the stress ends the designs turned off. Finally, TLP measurement results show that all four proposed designs meet the minimum design requirement of the ESD protection circuit in the 65 nm CMOS technology (i. e. HBM protection level of ± 1. 5 kV) ...|$|R

The Raman cavity was separated from the VECSEL resonator by a tilted dichroic mirror, which steers the Raman beam to an output coupler external to the VECSEL. The spectral emission of the VECSEL, and consequently of the Raman laser, was set by a 4 -mm-thick quartz birefringent filter in the VECSEL cavity.

40|$|Reflective {{modulators}} {{based on}} the combination of an electroabsorption modulator (EAM) and semiconductor optical amplifier (SOA) are attractive devices for applications in long reach carrier distributed passive optical networks (PONs) due to the gain provided by the SOA and the high speed and low chirp modulation of the EAM. Integrated R-EAM-SOAs have experimentally shown two unexpected and unintuitive characteristics which are not observed {{in a single pass}} transmission SOA: the clamping of the output power of the device around a maximum value and low patterning distortion despite the SOA being in a regime of gain saturation. In this thesis a detailed analysis is carried out using both experimental measurements and modelling in order to understand these phenomena. For the first time it is shown that both the internal loss between SOA and R-EAM and the SOA gain play an integral role in the behaviour of gain saturated R-EAM-SOAs.

Variations in modal parameters of winding structure with solid insulation ageing is studied using Finite Element Modelling (FEM). Results are used to discuss the sensitivity of winding vibrations to solid insulation ageing...|$|R
40|$|The thermal {{analysis}} and management {{is an important}} issue for power semiconductor devices especially as increasing current density and power dissipation in modern power electronics applications. Nearly sixty percent of electrical and mechanical failures of power electronics devices are temperature-induced. An accurate junction temperature prediction plays an essential role in the design and optimization of power semiconductor devices. ^ In this dissertation, a new thermal model based on Fourier-series solution of heat conduction equation was presented in detail. One-dimensional and two-dimensional Fourier-series thermal model have been programmed in Matlab/Simulink. Compared with traditional finite difference thermal model and equivalent RC thermal network, the new thermal model can provide high simulation speed with high accuracy, which has been proved to be more favorable in dynamic thermal characterization on power semiconductor switches. ^ A complete electro-thermal simulation model of IGBT and power diodes under inductive load switching condition has been successfully implemented in Malab/Simulink environment. The experimental results on IGBT and <b>power</b> diode with <b>clamped</b> inductive load test have validated the new electro-thermal simulation model. The advantage of Fourier-series thermal model over widely-used equivalent RC thermal network in dynamic thermal characterization has also been proved by the measured junction temperature. ...|$|R
40|$|Spontaneous oscillatory {{fluctuations}} in membrane potential are often observed in heart cells, but their basis remains controversial. Such activity is enhanced in cardiac Purkinje fibers {{by exposure to}} digitalis or K-free solutions. Under these conditions, we find that voltage noise is generated by current fluctuations that persist when membrane potential is voltage <b>clamped.</b> <b>Power</b> spectra of current signals are not made up of single time-constant components, as expected from gating of independent channels, but are dominated by resonant characteristics between 0. 5 and 2 HZ. Our {{evidence suggests that the}} periodicity arises from oscillatory variations in intracellular free Ca that control ion movements across the surface membrane. The current fluctuations are strongly cross-correlated with oscillatory {{fluctuations in}} contractile force, and are inhibited by removing extracellular Ca or exposure to D 600. Chelating intracellular Ca with injected EGTA also abolishes the current fluctuations. The oscillatory mechanism may involve cycles of Ca (or Sr) movement between sarcoplasmic reticulum and myoplasm, as previously suggested for skinned cardiac preparations. Our experiments in intact cells indicate that changes in surface membrane potential can modulate cytoplasmic Ca oscillations in frequency and perhaps amplitude as well. A two-way interaction between surface membrane potential and intracellular Ca stores may be a common feature of heart, neuron, and other cell types...|$|R
