5|$|Competitors {{must meet}} {{a series of}} written and unwritten {{requirements}} before entering. The first is that each musher must have a team of dogs. The race does not furnish any dogs, but <b>participants</b> <b>have</b> been known to lease or borrow dog teams rather than raise their own. In the 2009 Yukon Quest, for example, Newton Marshall from the Jamaica Dogsled Team borrowed a dog team from Canadian Hans Gatt. Each competitor must have completed at least two sled dog races sanctioned by Yukon Quest International: one of 200miles (320km) and one of 300miles (480km). Sanctioned races include the Copper Basin 300 and the Tustumena 200, Alaska races held before the Quest.|$|E

5|$|Another {{criticism}} of Kohlberg’s {{theory is that}} people frequently demonstrate significant inconsistency in their moral judgements. This often occurs in moral dilemmas involving drinking and driving and business situations where <b>participants</b> <b>have</b> been shown to reason at a subpar stage, typically using more self-interest driven reasoning (i.e., stage two) than authority and social order obedience driven reasoning (i.e., stage four). Kohlberg’s theory is {{generally considered to be}} incompatible with inconsistencies in moral reasoning. Carpendale has argued that Kohlberg’s theory should be modified to focus on the view that the process of moral reasoning involves integrating varying perspectives of a moral dilemma rather than simply fixating on applying rules. This view would allow for inconsistency in moral reasoning since individuals may be hampered by their inability to consider different perspectives. Krebs and Denton have also attempted to modify Kohlberg’s theory to account for a multitude of conflicting findings, but eventually concluded that the theory is not equipped to take into consideration how most individuals make moral decisions in their everyday lives.|$|E
5|$|In a {{range of}} studies, <b>participants</b> <b>have</b> been {{requested}} to answer general knowledge questions, each of which had two possible answers, and also to estimate their chances of answering each question correctly. If the participants had a sufficient degree of self-knowledge, their level of confidence in regard to each answer they gave would be high for the questions they answered correctly and lower for the ones they answered wrong. However, this generally is not the case. Many people are overconfident; indeed, studies show that most people systematically overestimate their own abilities. Moreover, people are overconfident {{about their ability to}} answer questions that are deemed to be hard but underconfident on questions that are considered easy.|$|E

40|$|Epidemiological {{data on the}} {{periodontal}} {{health and}} oral hygiene practices of young individuals in Latin America are limited. This {{study was conducted in}} a sample of 355 first-year students randomly selected from 3, 251 new students entering the largest university in Colombia. Participants received a periodontal examination and were interviewed about oral hygiene practices. Specifically, this study assessed the relationship between oral hygiene practices (including smoking tobacco) and plaque accumulation and/or periodontal bleeding on probing (BOP). <b>Participants</b> <b>had</b> extensive plaque accumulation and BOP, with a mean O´Leary plaque index of 56 % and mean BOP of 37 %. Both measures were higher for proximal surfaces. Plaque indices of at least 50 % were not associated with any oral hygiene factors; however, plaque index and use of dental floss were associated with a BOP of at least 50 %. Frequency of tooth brushing was higher in female than in male participants. Only 5 % of participants reported smoking tobacco. On average, <b>participants</b> <b>had</b> 2. 7 ± 4. 6 pockets of at least 4 mm (18 % of <b>participants</b> <b>had</b> &# 8805; 5 and 9 % of <b>participants</b> <b>had</b> &# 8805; 10 pockets of this depth, respectively).

Only 8 % of participants were diagnosed with moderate periodontitis, and no participants were diagnosed with severe periodontitis.
