2500|$|It is {{reported}} that {{the ratio of the}} longitudinal to the transverse (radial and tangential) diffusion rates for wood ranges from about 100 at a moisture content of 5%, to 2 - 4 at a moisture content of 25% (Langrish and Walker, 1993). Radial diffusion is somewhat faster than tangential diffusion. Although longitudinal diffusion is most rapid, it is of practical importance only when short pieces are dried. Generally the timber boards are much longer than in width or thickness. For example, a typical size of a green board used for this research was 6 m long, 250mm in width and 43mm in thickness. If the boards are quartersawn, then the width will be in the radial direction whereas the thickness will be in tangential direction, and vice versa for <b>plain-sawn</b> boards. [...] Most of the moisture is removed from wood by lateral movement during drying.|$|E
5000|$|The {{types of}} rip-cuts {{influence}} {{the quality of}} the lumber. <b>Plain-sawn</b> is {{the most common type of}} cut where a log is repeatedly run through a saw and much of the lumber has wood grain nearly parallel to the width of the boards. Quarter sawn and rift-sawn wood is more time consuming and wasteful to produce but is higher quality.|$|E

50|$|When {{boards are}} {{cut from a}} log they are usually rip cut along the length (axis) of the log. This {{can be done in}} three ways: <b>plain-sawing</b> (most common, also known as flat-sawn, bastard-sawn, through and through, and tangent-sawn), quarter-sawing (less common), or rift sawing (rare).|$|R
40|$|This report {{reviews the}} {{procedure}} employed {{in an investigation}} of the sources and influence of internal stresses in laminated construction, and discusses the influence of shrinkage and swelling stresses caused by atmospheric conditions upon the tensile strength across grain in laminated construction with special reference to airplane propellers. The investigation covered three sources of internal stress, namely, the combination of <b>plain-sawed</b> and quarter-sawed material in the same construction, the gluing together of laminations of different moisture contents, and the gluing together of laminations of different densities. Glued specimens and free specimens, made up under various manufacturing conditions, were subjected to various climatic changes inducing internal stresses and then were tested...|$|R
30|$|Quarter-sawn and <b>plain-sawn</b> {{specimens}} of Scots pine were semi-isostatically compressed at 5, 15, 50, and 140 [*]MPa in a Quintus press. Elastic strain {{was measured using}} a telescope device that was pushed together when wood was compressed and remained in this position at release of pressure. Delayed elastic and plastic strains were assessed through repeated callipering during 5 years after densification. At 140 [*]MPa, wood reached an almost compact structure (ρ ≈ 1450 [*]kg/m 3) {{but as a result}} of elastic springback the density decreased to just below 1000 [*]kg/m 3. At 140 [*]MPa, the elastic and delayed elastic strains were 14.6 % and 1.8 %, respectively, in quarter-sawn specimens, and were 13.1 % and 0.8 %, respectively, in <b>plain-sawn</b> specimens. The higher elastic strains in quarter-sawn specimens can be attributed to elastic springback in the tangentially deformed latewood bands.|$|E
40|$|The {{acoustical}} {{properties of}} four Indonesian tropical hardwood species were evaluated in this study. The objectives {{of this study}} were to determine acoustical parameters e. g. logarithmic decrement, sound absorption, sound velocity as well as density and wood stiffness; and to evaluate the potential of those species for acoustical purposes. Sonokeling (Dalbergia latifolia), Mahoni (Swietenia mahagony), Acacia (Acacia mangium) and Manii wood (Maesopsis eminii) were selected in this research. Three different cutting plane patterns of sawn timber (quarter-sawn, flat-sawn, and <b>plain-sawn)</b> were converted into small specimens. The methods for determining acoustical properties were longitudinal vibration testing and time of flight of ultrasonic wave method. The result showed no significant difference (α= 0. 05) of acoustical properties in logarithmic decrement, sound absorption, and ultrasonic velocity means on quarter-sawn, flat-sawn, and <b>plain-sawn</b> for all wood species tested. We found that Mahoni and Sonokeling had good acoustical properties of logarithmic decrement, ultrasonic wave velocity, and ratio of wood stiffness to wood density; and is preferred for crafting musical instruments. Acacia and Manii woods are recommended for developing acoustic panels in building construction because those species possess higher sound absorption values...|$|E
40|$|When wood is {{densified}} through semi-isostatical compression in a Quintus- press at pressures up to 140 MPa, {{the material}} properties change. The cells are flattened, size is decreased and shape is changed, {{as a consequence}} of this the density is increased. Most properties of native woods are strongly correlated to the density. This is also true for densified wood. To understand the compression mechanisms plastic and elastic strains were studied at different pressures. Strength, density, anatomy and swelling were studied. Some of the methods used were: image analysis, computer tomography scanning (CT), scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and mechanical testing. Data was statistically analysed by linear regression and multivariate statistical methods. A big advantage of using semi-isostatic pressure is that wood of all dimensions, with knots and anomalous wood can be compressed without major checking. As the pressure is mediated through a flexible diaphragm the density becomes homogenous. <b>Plain-sawn</b> wood with inside-face to press-table gets the most homogenous density and the most rectangular shape. Strength is improved by the densification, especially the hardness, the bending and the axial compression strength. At water-soaking densified wood, the cell-shape recovers almost completely. This indicates the non-destructive character of the process. The swelling pressure, that develops when densified wood is restrained from dimensional change and then water-soaked, is more than twice as high as for native wood. The swelling can be reduced by deep impregnation with oil in combination with a surface lacquer. Godkänd; 2006; 20061130 (pafi...|$|E
