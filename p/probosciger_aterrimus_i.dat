50|$|The palm {{cockatoo}} (<b>Probosciger</b> <b>aterrimus),</b> {{also known as}} the goliath cockatoo or great black cockatoo, is a large smoky-grey or black parrot of the cockatoo family native to New Guinea, Aru Islands, and Cape York Peninsula. It has a very large black beak and prominent red cheek patches.|$|R
5000|$|The palm {{cockatoo}} was originally described by German naturalist Johann Friedrich Gmelin in 1788 as Psittacus aterrimus [...] Its specific name, <b>Probosciger</b> <b>aterrimus,</b> is from Latin proboscis, long thin nose + -ger, carry, and Latin superlative adjective for ater, black, hence a [...] "black bird {{with a long}} thin nose (beak)".|$|R
25|$|Hyacinth macaws (Anodorhynchus hyacinthinus) {{have been}} {{repeatedly}} observed to use tools when breaking open nuts, for example, {{pieces of wood}} {{being used as a}} wedge. Several birds have wrapped a piece of leaf around a nut to hold it in place. This behaviour is also shown by palm cockatoos (<b>Probosciger</b> <b>aterrimus).</b> It seems that the hyacinth macaw has an innate tendency to use tools during manipulation of nuts, as naïve juveniles tried out a variety of objects in combination with nuts.|$|R
40|$|The {{ability to}} {{identify}} individuals within a population is often essential for a detailed understanding of the ecology and conservation of a species. However, some species, including large parrots, are notoriously difficult to catch and mark for individual identification. Palm cockatoos (<b>Probosciger</b> <b>aterrimus)</b> are a large, poorly understood species of parrot which are likely in severe decline within the eastern part - and possibly the western part - of their range on Cape York Peninsula, Australia. Here, we investigated whether three different palm cockatoo call types are sufficiently individually distinctive {{to function as a}} non-invasive "marker" for identifying individuals over time. Using Discriminant Function Analysis, overall identification accuracy among 12 putative individuals for all call types was 81 % (i. e. 148 out of 183 calls were assigned to the correct individual) on the basis of multiple temporal, energy (amplitude) and frequency measurements on the spectrogram. For three different call types, individual identification accuracy among males and females ranged from 69 to 95 %. However, based on a limited sample sizes of five putative individuals between years, our data suggest that individual call structure, as quantified by call parameters, was not stable between years. We discuss the applicability of these results for future studies of palm cockatoos and other parrot species...|$|R
40|$|Vis near Cardwell, {{the current}} known {{distribution}} in Queensland (Qld) extends from Bowen to Cooktown with one isolated specimen collected near Coen on Cape York Peninsula (Hall 1995; Duncan et al. 1999). It {{has also been}} recorded in the Alligator River area in the Northern Territory (McKean et al. 1981). The conservation status of S. saccolaimus in Qld has recently been defined as ‘Critically Endangered’, and the species has not been recorded anywhere in Australia for at least 18 years (Duncan et al. 1999; Menkhorst and Knight 2001). The likely reasons for the apparent decline are unclear, but may involve land-clearing and changed fire regimes in the coastal zone where it is thought to occur (Duncan et al. 1999). In contrast, Bonaccorso (1998) considers S. saccolaimus to be secure, albeit also poorly known in Papua New Guinea. In other parts of their range S. saccolaimus is known to roost in houses, caves, hollow trees and tombs (Hall 1995). In Australia, S. saccolaimus is known only to roost in tree hollows in poplar gums Eucalyptus platyphylla and Darwin woollybutt E. miniata (McKean et al. 1981; Compton and Johnson 1983). Compton and Johnson (1983) suggest that E. platyphylla woodlands {{may be an important}} in determining the distribution of S. saccolaimus in Qld. Extralimitally, S. saccolaimus has been recorded in gardens, sclerophyll woodland and rainforest (Bonaccorso 1998). In mid August 2001, a small colony of S. saccolaimus was discovered while carrying out field surveys for nest sites of the palm cockatoo <b>Probosciger</b> <b>aterrimus</b> on the Lockhart River Aboriginal Reserve in the Iron Range area of Cap...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. As an order, Parrots (Psittaciformes) {{are both}} the longest lived birds {{and among the}} most endangered. Palm Cockatoos (<b>Probosciger</b> <b>aterrimus)</b> have an {{extremely}} slow life history, including {{one of the lowest}} rates of breeding success reported for parrots. Here we use population viability analysis (PVA) to examine whether populations of Palm Cockatoos are viable in the long term with such low rates of reproduction. We built PVA models for two field sites with robust data on reproductive success and availability of nest-hollows: Iron Range on Cape York Peninsula (Queensland, Australia) and Crater Mountain (Eastern Highlands Province, Papua New Guinea). Our Iron Range models incorporate a fluctuating resource base of nest-hollows resulting from natural losses from fire, wind and tree decay and natural replenishment through tree breakages in tropical cyclones. The number of females allowed to breed each year in the simulations was limited by the availability of hollows. Our Iron Range models suggest that the population is only viable if juvenile and adult mortality rates are very low, and that at least some birds in the population live to 100 years old. Based on known maximum lifespans in the Cacatuidae, we conclude that Palm Cockatoos at Iron Range are unlikely to live for long enough on average to support their low rates of reproduction, and highlight the possibility that the population may be in decline. At Crater Mountain, where nestlings are harvested for food by local people, the models suggest that the reported current rate of 40 % of nestlings taken is not sustainable...|$|R
40|$|Cockatoos are the {{distinctive}} family Cacatuidae, a major lineage {{of the order}} of parrots (Psittaciformes) and distributed throughout the Australasian region of the world. However, the evolutionary history of cockatoos is not well understood. We investigated the phylogeny of cockatoos based on three mitochondrial and three nuclear DNA genes obtained from 16 of 21 species of Cacatuidae. In addition, five novel mitochondrial genomes were used to estimate time of divergence and our estimates indicate Cacatuidae diverged from Psittacidae approximately 40. 7. million years ago (95 % CI 51. 6 - 30. 3. Ma) during the Eocene. Our data shows Cacatuidae began to diversify approximately 27. 9. Ma (95 % CI 38. 1 - 18. 3. Ma) during the Oligocene. The early to middle Miocene (20 - 10. Ma) was a significant period in the evolution of modern Australian environments and vegetation, in which a transformation from mainly mesic to xeric habitats (e. g., fire-adapted sclerophyll vegetation and grasslands) occurred. We hypothesize that this environmental transformation was a driving force behind the diversification of cockatoos. A detailed multi-locus molecular phylogeny enabled us to resolve the phylogenetic placements of the Palm Cockatoo (<b>Probosciger</b> <b>aterrimus),</b> Galah (Eolophus roseicapillus), Gang-gang Cockatoo (Callocephalon fimbriatum) and Cockatiel (Nymphicus hollandicus), which have historically been difficult to place within Cacatuidae. When the molecular evidence is analysed in concert with morphology, it is clear that many of the cockatoo species' diagnostic phenotypic traits such as plumage colour, body size, wing shape and bill morphology have evolved in parallel or convergently across lineages...|$|R
40|$|The {{breeding}} of palm cockatoos <b>Probosciger</b> <b>aterrimus</b> was studied for 3 years from July 1999 to February 2002 {{in and around}} Iron Range National Park, Cape York Peninsula, Australia. Palm cockatoos were weakly seasonal breeders, with the peak of egg-laying occurring in September; 41 breeding attempts were monitored at 28 nesting hollows. Nearly all (27 / 28) nests were in tropical savanna woodland and an average distance of 320 m to rainforest. Males defended about four nest sites, only a subset of which were used for breeding. The typical active nest tree was in a near-vertical hollow with an opening that faced skywards; 62. 1 % of active nests were in living trees and the most common species of nest tree was Eucalyptus tetrodonta (48. 3 %). DNA fingerprinting revealed that some pairs reused the same nest hollow even when breeding attempts were separated by 1 {{or more years of}} no breeding activity, but that changes in hollow ownership also occurred. Nest usurpation, male territorial displays at the nest and evidence of interference competition by conspecifics suggest strong competition for nest sites, which is probably driven by variation in hollow quality and high investment in the nesting platform. Of active nests, 81 % failed to produce a fledgling, thereby ranking the breeding success of palm cockatoos among the lowest reported for any species of parrot. They also invariably laid a single egg and seemed to breed infrequently, and thus they use an extremely slow life-history strategy. We suggest that this slow life history makes palm cockatoos on Cape York Peninsula sensitive to environmental perturbations, with fire being the most probable threatening process...|$|R
40|$|Psittacine beak and feather disease (PBFD), {{the most}} {{prevalent}} viral disease affecting psittacines, is caused by beak and feather disease virus (BFDV). An outbreak of the disease {{has been reported in}} wild endangered Cape parrots (Poicephalus robustus), which is endemic to South Africa. No treatment or vaccine is commercially available. In this study, an investigation into the outbreak was undertaken. BFDV diversity was assessed and viral load and clinical signs correlated. A plant-produced BFDV subunit vaccine was produced in parallel with a corresponding challenge model. Cape parrots were assessed and 53 blood samples collected. Viral load was determined using quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR), and 22 BFDV full-length genome sequences acquired to infer phylogenetic relatedness. The capsid gene (cp) was optimised for transient Agrobacterium-mediated expression in whole-plant Nicotiana benthamiana (N. benthamiana). Virus-like particles (VLPs) were purified and analysed using transmission electron microscopy. Virions from a Palm cockatoo (<b>Probosciger</b> <b>aterrimus)</b> were purified and a BFDV dsDNA molecular clone was synthesised and replication assessed in 293 TT mammalian cells and N. benthamiana using rolling circle replication and qPCR. Two distinct BFDV phylogenetic clusters were reported for Cape parrots, and a direct correlation was seen between viral load in the blood and clinical signs in PBFD-afflicted birds. The CP was successfully expressed in N. benthamiana, and increased through optimisation of Agrobacterium infiltration density and the inclusion of the NSs silencing suppressor. The CP formed VLPs, which were shown to be morphologically similar to infectious virions. The dsDNA molecular clone was shown to replicate autonomously in mammalian 293 TT cells, and in plants {{with the assistance of the}} Bean yellow dwarf virus replication associated protein (Rep). BFDV genetic diversity in Cape parrots highlights the importance of ensuring new strains are not inadvertently introduced into the wild. This is the first systematic investigation of virus diversity in Cape parrots and assessment of BFDV viral load in a wild psittacine population. The CP was successfully produced in planta and presence of VLPs suggests the possibility of developing pseudovirions. This is the first reported replication of BFDV in tissue culture, and will greatly expand the scope of available research...|$|R
