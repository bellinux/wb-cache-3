40|$|Shelled yellow corn is {{commonly}} stored in concrete or corrugated steel bins. Granular materials compact {{under their own}} weight, primarily due to particle rearrangement, leading {{to an increase in}} bulk density and a change in volume when stored. Reliable grain <b>pack</b> <b>factors</b> are needed to estimate storage capacities and to accurately monitor grain inventories. A science-based model (WPACKING) of <b>pack</b> <b>factors</b> is available that uses the differential form of Janssen’s equation and takes into account the variation in density caused by pressure variation with height and moisture content of the grain and accounts for the effects of grain type, test weight, bin geometry, and bin material. However, this model needs to be compared to field data over a wide range of conditions to ensure robust prediction accuracy. The objective of this research was to determine the field <b>pack</b> <b>factors</b> and bin capacities for on-farm and commercial bins used to store corn in the U. S. and compare them to predictions of the WPACKING program. Bin inventory measurements were conducted in concrete bins with depths up to 31. 4 m (114. 8 ft) and corrugated steel bins with diameters up to 32. 8 m (156 Â ft). These values were also compared to the techniques used by the USDA Risk Management Agency (RMA) and the USDA Farm Service Agency, Warehouse Branch (FSA-W). The differences between predicted and reported mass were - 4. 54 % (maximum underprediction) to + 4. 53 % (maximum overprediction) for WPACKING, - 2. 69 % to 4. 97 % for the RMA method, and - 3. 33 % to + 5. 67 % for the FSA-W method. The absolute average difference was lowest for the WPACKING model (0. 90 %) compared to the RMA and FSA-W methods (1. 61 % and 1. 86 %, respectively). WPACKING had less than half as many prediction differences above 1 % (13 out of 51 bins) as did the RMA and FSA-W methods, which had 29 out of 51 and 33 out of 51, respectively. The RMA and FSA-W methods do {{not take into account the}} variations in <b>pack</b> <b>factor</b> due to bin type and moisture content of the stored grain...|$|R
40|$|Storing grain in {{bulk storage}} units results in grain packing from {{overbearing}} pressure, which increases grain bulk density and storage unit capacity. This study compared <b>pack</b> <b>factors</b> of hard red winter (HRW) wheat in vertical storage bins using different methods: the existing packing model (WPACKING), the USDA Risk Management Agency (RMA) method, and the USDA Farm Service Agency Warehouse Licensing and Examination Division (FSA-W) method. Grain bins containing HRW wheat were measured in Kansas, Oklahoma, and Texas. Packing {{was measured in}} corrugated steel bins and reinforced concrete bins with diameters ranging from 4. 6 to 31. 9 m (15. 0 to 104. 6 ft) and equivalent level grain heights ranging from 4. 1 to 41. 6 m (13. 4 to 136. 6 ft). The predicted masses of compacted stored wheat based on WPACKING, RMA, and FSA-W were compared to the reported mass from scale tickets. <b>Pack</b> <b>factors</b> predicted by WPACKING ranged from 0. 929 to 1. 073 for steel bins and from 0. 986 to 1. 077 for concrete bins. <b>Pack</b> <b>factors</b> predicted by the RMA method ranged from 0. 991 to 1. 157 for steel bins and from 0. 993 to 1. 099 for concrete bins. <b>Pack</b> <b>factors</b> predicted by the FSA-W method ranged from 0. 985 to 1. 126 for steel bins and from 1. 012 to 1. 101 for concrete bins. The average absolute and median differences between the WPACKING-predicted mass and reported mass were 1. 64 % and - 1. 26 %, respectively, for corrugated steel bins and 3. 75 % and 2. 16 %, respectively, for concrete bins. In most cases, WPACKING underpredicted the mass in corrugated steel bins and overpredicted the mass in concrete bins. Comparison of the RMA-predicted mass and reported mass showed an average absolute difference of 4. 41 % with a median difference of 1. 91 % for HRW wheat in steel bins and an average absolute difference of 3. 25 % with a median difference of 1. 03 % for concrete bins. For the FSA-W-predicted mass versus reported mass, the average absolute and median differences were 3. 40 % and 3. 86 %, respectively, for steel bins and 4. 34 % and 3. 50 %, respectively, for concrete bins. Most of the mass values were overpredicted by both the RMA and FSA-W methods. Some of the large differences observed for concrete bins {{can be attributed to}} the unique geometry of these bins and the difficulty in describing these bin shapes mathematically. Overall, compared to the reported mass, WPACKING predicted the mass of grain in the bins with less error than the current RMA and FSA-W methods. Some of the differences may be because the RMA and FSA-W methods do not include the effects of grain moisture content, bin wall type, and grain height on <b>pack</b> <b>factors...</b>|$|R

40|$|There is an {{interest}} in using multiple-beam RFQ (MB-RFQ) with a high packing of beamlets {{for a variety of}} purposes. The principle of the MB-RFQ arranged as a matrix array of longitudinal rod-electrodes is known for a long time. It allows to reach a <b>packing</b> <b>factor</b> up to 40 %. The unsolved problem is to define such configuration of resonator, which preserves a high packing without disturbing RFQ fields and correctly excites electrodes surrounding every channel. According to the usual design principle, which is extended from a single-channel 4 -rod RFQ to MB-RFQ resonators, every electrode of MB-RFQ must be discretely connected with tank by coupling elements, while adjacent RFQ electrodes having different potentials cannot be interconnected by short-circuited couplers and the couplers may interconnect only next adjacent electrodes "in a chess order", avoiding adjacent electrodes. The principle reduces a <b>packing</b> <b>factor</b> considerably from the above value. A new principle for MB-RFQ is suggested. A high <b>packing</b> <b>factor</b> is preserved, because of discrete connections of adjacent electrodes are allowed. The beam dynamics in RFQ-channels is modified.

This article analyses the different case in which the input thermal power is constant and the temperature difference across the TEG varies depending on its effective thermal resistance.
