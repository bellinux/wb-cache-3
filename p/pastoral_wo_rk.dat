The author briefly analyses the discovered coincidences {{in terms of their}} accu racy and confidence, while leaving himself aside any physical explanation of the prese nted formulas. Important: all the found relations have a common nature of the “power of t wo”. The exact nature of this remains unknown for yet, so it requires further resea rch. The presented material may also be viewed as a logical continuation and development of Dirac’s and Edding- ton’s Large Numbers Hypothesis (LNH).

40|$|This paper {{explores the}} role of social {{interactions}} at the wor k floor for understanding gender pay differentials in the EU, {{using data from the}} European Working Conditions Survey. Sex similarity between subordinate and supervisor decreases the gender pay disadvantage for women in non-managerial occupations, though <b>wo</b> <b>rking</b> for a female boss is associated with a lower wage. This may point at a discrimination-for-pay effect. Female workers can avoid part of the discrimination against them by working for a woman and accepting lower pay. And when they face stronger discrimination in the situation of a male supervisor, they are “bribed ” by being offered a better salary. Different results are obtained for managerial workers, and for this group sex similarity between worker and superior actually puts women at a further disadva ntage. We also inspect whether wage formation is influenced by the proportion of women in a sector, but find no empirical support for this so-called social bias theory. Our main message here is that the traditional human capital model tends to study the wage formation process for workers in isolation, while gender pay differentials seem to be at least to some extent a sociological phenomenon, stemming from social interactions on labor markets. 1...|$|R

The SenStylus consists of a wireless pen designed to be ergonomically handled by the user for spatial interaction using a six degree of freedom optical tracking. In addition to the classic digital button(s) input, it provides analog multi-axial control, and a dual-rumble feedback output. We have integrated the device into an existing virtual reality CAD environment and extended the application functionalities with new devicespecific features. The SenStylus vibration feedback improves perception in the virtual world by controlling frequency, amplitude, and duration of the feedback, simulating a variety of responses during collisions and selection tasks.

40|$|The {{structural}} and surface changes undergone by the different precursors that are produced during {{the synthesis of}} imogolite are reported. The surface changes that occur during the synthesis of imogolite were determined by electrophoretic migration (EM) measurements, which enabled {{the identification of the}} time at which the critical precursor of the nanoparticles was generated. A critical parameter for understanding the evolution of these precursors is the isoelectric point (IEP), of which variation revealed that the precursors modify the number of active ≡Al-OH and ≡Si-OH sites during the formation of imogolite. We also found that the IEP is displaced to a higher pH level {{as a consequence of the}} surface differentiation that occurs during the synthesis. At the same time, we established that the pH of the reaction (pHrx) decreases with the evolution and condensation of the precursors during aging.

It {{is known}} that {{cryopreservation}} promotes cellular damage that could compromise sperm quality. In sperm, seminal plasma provides the major defense against oxidative stress. However, dilution in the extender before cryopreservation reduces the co ncentration of antioxidants in seminal plasma, diminishing sperm protection against reactive oxyge n species (ROS). In previous studies of our group it was demonstrated {{that this type of}} damage could be in part counteracted by the addition of antioxidants into the extenders. Extenders suppleme nted with vitamins C or E, improved sperm motility of cryopreserved sperm (Martínez-Páramo et al., 2012), and taurine and hypotaurine, besides improving motility, reduced DNA fragmentati on (Martínez-Páramo et al., 2013). However, the antioxidant supplemented extenders did not redu ce lipid peroxidation or improved sperm viability. Taking into account that broodstock diet {{plays an important role in}} gametogenesis and gamete quality (Izquierdo et al., 2001), in this <b>wo</b> <b>rk,</b> a nutritional approach to enhance the sperm antioxidant defense was attempted. Therefore, three experimental diets were tested in European seabass and gilthead seabream with the aim of reinf orcing the sperm antioxidant system before and after cryopreservation.

40|$|In 1872, our nation’s first {{national}} park, Yellowstone, was “dedicated and set apart {{as a public}} park or pleasuring ground for the ben-efit and enjoyment of the people. ” T h e anthropocentric mission of this first park is clear, and there was in 1872 little indication that this dedication was intended to inaugu-rate {{what would become the}} world’s most ambitious national park system. The develop-ment of an actual system of parks did not real-ly begin until the 1890 s and early 1900 s with the creation of Yo s e m i te, S e q u o i a, C ra te r Lake, Mount Rainier, and Glacier National Parks. Although conservation of nature was a more explicit part of the mission of these new p a rk s, “people pleasuring ” remained the highest priority (Mackintosh 1991). T h e growth of the system was largely driven by opportunity and public appeal, as opposed to what today we might call a strategic conserva-tion plan. There was in these very early park system ye a rs virtually no scientific fra m e <b>wo</b> <b>rk</b> to guide park managers with regard to the con-servation of natural elements. The scientific discipline of ecology was in its early infancy— the first scientific journal dedicated specifical-ly to this topic would not appear until 1916. There was certainly no scientific context for i n te g rating notions of natural disturb a n ce such as fire and successional change into man-agement. In {{the early years of the}} national parks, comparatively stiff guidelines were adopted for protection of national forest reserves and p a rks from fire; but they we re vigo ro u s ly debated by some. H. J. Ostrander attacked fire co n t rol policies as wo rse than ineffective because they allowed hazardous fuels to accu-mulate, while John Muir viewed fire as “the master scourge and controller of the distribu-tion of trees ” and staunchly defended thos...|$|R
40|$|The {{problem of}} {{residual}} stress measurement in industrially manufactured tempered glass components has been {{addressed by the}} development and application of an experimental stress analysis technique known as pulsed magneto-photoelasticity. In the manufacture of tempered glass, residual stress is intentionally introduced in order to strengthen the material. However, {{the exact nature of}} the stress distribution remains unknown and, as a consequence, the strength of tempered glass products can vary significantly. A pulsed magneto-polariscope has been developed to allow the residual stress in glass to be quantified both through the thickness of the material and over the surface plane. Developments to the theory of the technique have enabled optical data, collected in the presence of multiple magnetic fields, to be used to provide a more detailed analysis of the residual stress distribution than has previously been possible. In the first phase of development, a pulsed magneto-polariscope with a continuous bore solenoid coil was designed and constructed. This enabled the proposed developments to be validated by testing birefringent specimens of epoxy resin and sectioned tempered glass test specimens. In addition, computer programs were developed to reduce the experimental complexity of the technique and to provide a platform upon which further research can be undertaken. The technique was extended by the design and inclusion of a novel component termed the dual coil solenoid which enabled high instantaneous magnetic flux densities to be generated, homogenously, over a <b>wo.</b> <b>rking</b> volume thereby allowing industrially manufactured tempered glass products to be analysed. Furthermore, this enabled test specimens of glass to be placed under known loads in order to precisely validate the proposed methodology. The pulsed magneto-polariscope was used to successfully quantify the residual stress distribution within a selection of automotive tempered glass products. The results demonstrated the ability of the developed technique to measure the residual stress in these components and to detect defects incurred in the manufacturing process.

English Education Department. Faculty of Tarbiyah and Teacher Training. State Islamic Institute (IAIN) of Tulungagung. Advisor: Nany Soengkono Madayani, S. S, M. P d. Keywords : pragmatics, person deixis, {{temporal}} deixis, spatial deixis Lan g uag e is {{very important}} in human life i n this word. Between human and language cannot be separated each other. One of the functions of language is to communication. A lthough language is used to communicate, sometimes the hearer or addressees are ambiguous. In English, it is difficult to underst and if we do n ot know about who is speaker, when, and where. Here, the context is needed to underst and what the speaker’s meaning. D eixis is one of scopes study in pragmatics. It is used to make understand about what the speaker meaning. One of literary <b>wo</b> <b>rk</b> is novel. The readers may often foun d in difficulties to understand about the speaker meaning in the novel. If they know the context, they can understand easier. The formulations of research problem were : 1) W hat are the types of deixis found in the novel “Everything About Him” by Rita Clay Estrada ? 2) What are the frequency of each deixis type found in the novel “Everything about Him” by Rita Clay Estrada ? The purposes of this study were : 1) To find out the types of deixis in the novel “Everything About Him” by Rita Clay Estrada. 2) To find out the frequency of each deixis types in the novel “Everything About Him” by Rita Clay Estrada. The research design of this study was descriptive quantitative approach which employed pragmatics analysis. It is intended to investigate those two formulations of research problems i n relation to types of deixis. T he data sources were all the utterance in the novel entitled Everything About Him.

40|$|Enabling robot {{manipulators}} {{to manipulate}} and/or recognise arbitrarily placed 3 D objects under sensory control {{is one of}} the key issues in robotics. Such robot sensors should be capable of providing 3 D information about objects in order to accomplish the above mentioned tasks. Such robot sensors should also provide the means for multisensor or multimeasurement integration. Finally, such 3 D information should be efficiently used for performing desired tasks. This work develops a novel computational frame <b>wo</b> <b>rk</b> for solving some of these problems. A vision (camera) sensor is used in conjunction with a robot manipulator, in the frame-work of active vision to estimate 3 D structure (3 D geometrical model) of a class of objects. Such information is used for the visual robot control, in the frame-work of model based vision. One part o f this dissertation is devoted to the system calibration. The camera and eye/hand calibration is presented. Several contributions are introduced in this part, intended to improve existing calibration procedures. This results in more efficient and accurate calibrations. Experimental results are presented. Second part of this work is devoted to the methods of image processing and image representation. Methods for extracting and representing necessary image features comprising vision based measurements are given. Third part of this dissertation is devoted to the 3 D geometrical model reconstruction of a class o f objects (polyhedral objects). A new technique for 3 D model reconstruction from an image sequence is introduced. This algorithm estimates a 3 D model of an object in terms of 3 D straight-line segments (wire-frame model) by integrating pertinent information over an image sequence. The image sequence is obtained from a moving camera mounted on a robot arm. Experimental results are presented. Fourth part of this dissertation is devoted to the robot visual control. A new visual control strategy is introduced. In particular, the necessary homogeneous transformation matrix for the robot gripper in order to grasp an arbitrarily placed 3 D object is estimated. This problem is posed as a problem of 3 D displacement (motion) estimation between the reference model of an object and the actual model of the object. Further, the basic algorithm is extended to handle multiple object manipulation and recognition. Experimental results are presented...|$|R
40|$|ICFC 2017 - International Conference on Food Contaminants (Book of Abstracts) Mycotoxins are toxic {{secondary}} metabolites {{produced by}} fungi {{that are found}} worldwide in many food products. They are {{a diverse group of}} chemical compounds that possess a multiplicity of toxic properties and affect human and farm animal health. Additionally, they cause significant economic losses. The problem of mycotoxins results mainly from fungal growth on crop cultures at the pre - or post - harvest stages. Implicated fungi belong mostly to Aspergillus, Penicillium, Fusarium, Alternaria and Claviceps genera. For these reasons, mycotoxins presence in foods should be monitored, and their levels reduced as low as technologically possible. In recent years, several biological solutions have been studied and developed to mitigate the adverse effects of myco toxins. These strategies can be divided into three main type of action: i) Biocontrol, in this case, defined as the control of mycotoxigenic fungal growth by other microorganisms; ii) Adsorption, which refers to the use of microorganism cells to bind mycot oxins; and iii) Biotransformation, when microorganisms or pure enzymes are used to degrade or transform mycotoxins into non - toxic compounds. This presentation will revise some of the main achievements done in this field in the last years and present the <b>wo</b> <b>rk</b> done at the Centre of Biological Engineering related to this thematic. Presented topics will include: i) The inhibition of Aspergillus flavus and Penicillium nordicum growth, as the production of aflatoxins and ochratoxin A by lactic acid bacteria and t heir organic acids; ii) The adsorption of mycotoxins by microorganisms isolated from Kefir grains; and iii) The biodegradation of ochratoxin A by Pediococcus parvulusUMINHO/BPD/ 51 / 2015 from project UID/BIO/ 04469 / 2013 financed by FCT/MEC (OE).

Elucidating {{the fitness}} effects of natural genetic variants {{is one of}} the current major challenges in Evolutionary Biology. Understanding the interplay between genotype, phenotype and environment is necessary to make accurate predictions of imp ortant biological outcomes such as stress re sistance or yield in economically important plants and animals, and disease in humans. Based on population frequency patterns and footprints of selection at the DNA level, the transposable element Bari - Jheh, inserted in the intergenic region of Juvenile Ho rmone Epoxy Hydrolase (Jheh) genes, was previously identified as putatively ad aptive. However, the adaptive effect of this mutation remained elusive. In this <b>wo</b> <b>rk,</b> we integrate information on transcription factor binding sites, available ChIP - Seq data, gene expression analyses, and phenotypic assays to identify the functional and the mechanistic underpinnings of Bari - Jheh. We show that Bari - Jheh adds extra antioxidant response elements upstream of Jheh 1 and Jheh 2 genes. Antioxidant response elements ha ve been repeatedly shown to be necessary and sufficient to up - regulate downstream genes involved in oxidative stress response. Accordingly, we find that Bari - Jheh is associated with up - regulation of Jheh 1 and Jheh 2 and with resistance to oxidative stress i nduced by two different compounds relevant for natural D. melanogaster populations. We also show that Bari - Jheh is a dominant mutation. Further analysis with mutant flies further confirm that Jheh 2 is involved in oxidative stress response. Moreover we show that TEs other than Bari - Jheh might be playing a role in the D. melanogaster response to oxidative stress. Overall our results contribute to the understanding of resistance to oxidative stress in natural populations and highlight the role of transposable elements in environmental adaptation. The replicability of fitness effects on different genetic backgrounds also suggests that epistatic interactions do not seem to dominate the genetic architecture of oxidative stress resistance.

40|$|The dymanic {{behaviour}} of cracked rotating shafts {{has been}} obtained by regarding theoretical and experimental publications and by carrying out tests with various test rigs. The {{aim of the}} investigation was to detect differences in the vibrational signals. This information was used for detection {{of the presence of}} a crack. From the literature {{it can be seen that}} faults such as fatigue cracks change the characteristics of the vibrations. However, different investigators detected different vibrational behaviour and recommended different crack indicators. The majority of papers deal with theoretical considerations and simulations. This made it necessary to carry out experimental work. The conclusions of other research work was presented. It could be seen that the increase of the twice per revolution harmonic indicates the presence of a crack. However, as explained, this recommendation is not free of inconsistences. Other indicators have also been detected. The results of the experimental <b>wo</b> <b>rk</b> showed that indeed the twice per revolution harmonic increased in most of the cases when a cracked shaft was compared with an uncracked one of the same properties. Since, in particular, this harmonic is influenced by a variety of parameters it was not detected in all of the tests, even when great effort had been made to keep these parameters unchanged. Another result that was expected is the decrease of the natural frequency of the shaft when it contains a crack. This could easily be confirmed in free vibration tests and with use of the hammer impact by regarding the resulting frequency response. An effect that is not mentioned in the literature explicitly, was that the harmonics of the rotating shaft are amplified in the region of the natural frequency of the shaft. This happened very clearly for the first mode, and under certain circumstances also for the second mode. It can be assumed that this effect is caused by the high damping of the material used, polymer, under forced vib r ation, and would not be obtained for metal shafts. This information obtained can be used to design an on-line condition monitoring tool for rotating machinery...|$|R
40|$|Introduction: {{the article}} explores the folklore’s {{educational}} potential and the comical of the Mordovian {{people in the}} context of reflection of socio-philosophical categories in it. It also reveals the basis and content of the comical and specifics of the laughing matter for Moksha and Erzya people and their effect on the formation of personality. This kind of research is noval and paper has an interdisciplina ry character. Materials and Methods: the analysed materials included Mordovian myths, aphorisms, proverbs, sayings, fairytales, and ritual songs. We used quantitative-qualitative analysis, generalisations and s ynthesis. Results: a detailed comparison of Moksha and Erzya folklore revealed a significant degree of similarities. Both sub-ethnic groups share the same comical view of social vices (injustice, drunkenness, gambling, etc.) and individual vices (the manifestation of a lack of vital energy and information: laziness, slovenliness, poverty, and other forms of the wrong use of vital energy: hypocrisy, lying, stupidity, cursing, etc.). In terms of differences, Moksha people are more inclined to support common effectiveness and common justice whereas Erzya people are inclined to maintain individual justice and individual effectiveness. Consequently, the education of Moksha and Erzya in general is similar. The upbringing is directed to creating a model of behaviour that reflects sufficient and excessive vital energy, justice, hard work, tidiness, common sense, and cunning. Ridiculing of the vices, however, is sanctioned. We brought to light the object of the Moksha comical (insufficient vital energy, deviation from justice and genuineness) and its subject (deviation from human destiny, from natural creativity). We found that the tropes contain an illocutionary power. The perlocutionary effect is disapproval of the vices and admiration of the virtues which form the desiderative norms – the norms reaching the aim of education and upbringing. The desiderative norms of Moksha and Erzya are the abundant life energy and information, organised into skillful creative work, rewarded according to merit. We also mention the rational use of natural resources, following the progress of a peaceful, contemporary world. Conditioned by derision, the pejorative form judges mechanical work, work without understanding, and <b>wo</b> <b>rk</b> for profit only without creativity. Discussion and Conclusions: we exposed some socio-philosophical categories in the Moksha and Erzya comical, which create a perlocutionary ef fect and have the illocutionary power that shape the influence on the recipient’s personality implementing the basic educational function of socialisation and introduction of norms. Therefore, we proved that the comic element of folklore has an undoubted educative value...|$|R
