The pro-ligands and the metal complexes have been characterised by a combination of multinuclear NMR spectroscopic techniques, IR spectroscopy, mass spectrometry and, for selected examples, by single crystal X-ray crystallography; remarkable spectroscopic and structural data are discussed. In Chapter 2, the synthesis and characterization of thirteen NNC and ONC <b>pyridine</b> <b>based</b> pincer ligands is described, including nine novel pincer ligands and four <b>pyridine</b> <b>based</b> pincers which have been previously reported. In Chapter 3, the palladium/platinum chemistry of NNCaryl and ONCaryl <b>pyridine</b> <b>based</b> pincer ligands is explored. Variation on the donor atoms has allowed an investigation of donor property influences on C-H activation, by giving peri-activated palladium pincer complexes for the ketimine-, aldimine-, amine- and biyridine-armed ligands and generating ortho-activated ONC palladium pincer complexes {{in the case of the}} alcohol-armed pro-ligand. Use of different palladium salts also led to different regioselective C-H activations. With the ketimine-armed naphthyl ligand (HL 1 ket-nap) as the example, the interconversion chemistry between the ortho- and peri-C-H activated products is also explored. In Chapter 4, sp 3 C-H activation of the Et-armed ligand HL 4 Et with both palladium acetate and palladium chlorides has been unsuccessful, giving the N,N-coordinated bidentate species.

The aim is to create a stable cell and to avoid the need for buffer layers and encapsulation that increase device cost. Water containing electrolytes generally give lower photocurrents than those based on organic solvents, a problem that has in part been attributed to poor pore filling by the aqueous electrolyte. Here, two sets of cells have been made that are identical except for the nature of the solvent (water or acetonitrile). Photocurrent mapping has been used to compare spatially resolved inhomogeneities in the current density. High-resolution transmission mapping (3906 data points/cm 2) has been used to decouple dye coverage and film thickness from electrolyte permeation. Filling cells using heating and vacuum was found to improve water electrolyte permeation.

40|$|The {{investigation}} of strongly hydrogen bonded solid state {{materials and the}} hydrogen transfer processes therein {{are the subject of}} the present work. Strong hydrogen bonds are found whenever the hydrogen bonded species compete for the hydrogen atom, and are thereby on the verge of showing hydrogen transfer. Consequently, the strongly hydrogen bonded solid state materials investigated in this work are synthesised by co-crystallising chemical compounds which have a similar affinity for the proton. The molecular complexes of isonicotinamide with oxalic acid crystallise in two hydrogenous polymorphs and, upon substituting the acidic hydrogen for deuterium, in two deuterated polymorphs, neither being isostructural to the hydrogenous forms. This phenomenon is known as isotopomeric polymorphism and is rarely observed in molecular materials. The four polymorphic forms are found to exhibit different degrees of hydron transfer. The hydrogenous forms show strong hydrogen bonding between the acid and the <b>pyridine</b> <b>base.</b> The nature of these strong hydrogen bonds is characterised by combined X ray charge density and single crystal neutron diffraction studies and found to be covalent in nature. The covalent hydroxyl bonds are considerably elongated, to an extent that in one polymorph the hydrogen atom occupies a near central position in the strong hydrogen bond. The structural work has been complemented by ab-initio computational studies, using the plane wave and localised atomic orbital methods, to evaluate the nature and the dynamics of the strong hydrogen bonds, and to establish an energy scale for polymorphism. It is found that the atomic orbital calculations yield results in good agreement with the experiment, while the plane wave calculations fail to reproduce the experimental hydrogen bond geometries. A strong electronic delocalisation is observed in the difference electron densities of strong acid – <b>pyridine</b> <b>base</b> hydrogen bonds. The major contribution to the delocalisation is found to originate from the nitrogen lone pair density which in this type of strong hydrogen bond is found to be observed to low experimental resolutions in standard X-ray diffraction experiments. As a consequence, such hydrogen bonds are susceptible to misinterpretation, and can be misinterpreted as hydrogen bonds with a disordered hydrogen, altering the descriptive character of materials significantly from being neutral to being ionic. It is shown that a careful examination of the difference electron densities, with the knowledge of the presence of the nitrogen lone pair density, allows a reasonably accurate determination of nuclear hydrogen positions from X-ray diffraction experiments alone. The hydrogen transfer behaviour in a series of strongly hydrogen bonded materials has been studied. For the molecular complexes of pentachlorophenol with the series of dimethylpyridines, a correlation is established between the dissociation constants determined in solution and the degree of hydrogen transfer from phenol to the pyridine bases in the solid state. The influence of additional strong and weak hydrogen bonding interactions {{in the vicinity of the}} strong hydrogen bonds on the hydrogen transfer behaviour is rationalised. Similar studies have been carried out on the molecular complexes of oxalic acid and fumaric acid with the dimethylpyridines, and on the molecular complexes of pentachlorophenol with 1, 4 -diazabicyclo[2. 2. 2]octane. The design approach leading to these materials and the hydrogen transfer behaviour observed in these materials is critically analysed. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|E
40|$|The c-Jan N-terminal kinases {{are members}} of the mitogen {{activated}} protein kinase family of signaling proteins. Amino <b>pyridine</b> <b>based</b> compounds, 4 -anilino pyrimidine derivatives, and 2 -pyridine carboxamide derivatives have been identified as potent JNK inhibitors with good cellular activity. In this study we calculated molecular topological and quantum chemical descriptors of 15 training compounds and three quantitative structure activity relationships models have been constructed. The significance of three models is judged on the basis of correlation, Fischer F test and quality factor (Q). This study is helpful for screening potent inhibitors of protein kinases...|$|R
40|$|Among {{perchlorinated}} phenols, {{those of}} the o-quinonoid type (3, 5 -cyclohexadien-one- 1) are rich in reactivity (cf. S. Kumamoto, Kogyo Kagaku Zasshi, 64, 181 (1961)). The reaction of 2, 2, 4, 6 -tetrachloro- 3, 5 -dimethyl- (A) and 2, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 -hexachloro- 3, 5 -cyclohexadienone- 1 (B) with <b>pyridine</b> <b>bases</b> were studied and obained the following results. (A) and (B) reacted with pyridine in chloroform solution to yield pyridinium chlorides (AP), (BP) involved 1 mol. water of crystallization respectively, which are easily soluble in water or alcohols. Treating (AP) and (BP) above with 28...|$|R
40|$|Abstract 2 -Pyrazolines from <b>pyridine</b> <b>based</b> chalcones by {{conventional}} and microwave techniques have been synthesized and their antimicrobial activity {{as well as}} a comparison study between conventional and microwave techniques has been done. Antimicrobial activity was carried out according to the broth micro dilution method and it was observed that compound 2 d was found to be most active against gram negative bacteria and fungus Candida albicans. Microwave technique has been found superior over the conventional method in view of reaction time and energy requirement. Compounds have been characterized by 1 H NMR, 13 C NMR, IR and Mass spectral analyses...|$|R
