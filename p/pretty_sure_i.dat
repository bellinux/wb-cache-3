500|$|The film's {{producers}} {{launched a}} nationwide talent hunt to discover new faces for the film, initially refusing to employ established actors. However, the actors {{who came to}} audition were not promising enough for the roles, and the idea was scrapped. Mahesh Bhatt said, [...] "It was a disastrous talent hunt. We discovered that people lacked the courage to audition. Those who are amateurs went for audition ...and people with certain talent were like why should we risk public rejection." [...] When Suri saw some pictures of Aditya Roy Kapur and met him, he found Kapur perfect for the role and cast him to play the male lead. In June 2012, Shraddha Kapoor was signed to play the female lead. Bhatt said, [...] "Yes, Shraddha Kapoor is playing the lead with the two boys Aditya Roy Kapur and Shaad Randhawa. We found her to be very talented. All three actors have extremely challenging dramatic roles." [...] When asked about replacing new actors with known ones, Suri said [...] "People said I couldn't make a film with new actors and expect an audience to come in. But I was <b>pretty</b> <b>sure</b> <b>I</b> wanted Aditya and Shraddha to play my protagonists. My writer Shagufta Rafique and I saw them as the protagonists. See, Aditya and Shraddha may have had unsuccessful films before. But that never took away from their talent." ...|$|E
2500|$|Many viewers {{were upset}} by Lexa's {{betrayal}} of Clarke, resulting in debates about why {{she may have}} done it, and Andy Swift of TVLine's stating, [...] "I'm <b>pretty</b> <b>sure</b> <b>I</b> speak for Clarke, and all the angry viewers watching from home, when I say, 'Lexa, please meet a fiery death. ASAP.'" [...] Mariya Karimjee of Vulture viewed [...] "the hurt and confusion that washed across Eliza Taylor's face" [...] during the betrayal as [...] "one {{of the most powerful}} performances" [...] she had seen on the show and said the heavy, emotional struggle came from both characters, with Clarke realizing [...] "Lexa is the only person who understands her." [...] Kyle Fowle of The A.V. Club stated that having the characters reunite after the betrayal, [...] "allows for the show to dig into one of its most complex and compelling relationships. Clarke and Lexa are a tangle of emotions and motivations. [...] They share a connection on an emotional level, a romantic level, and they recognize the burden of responsibility that they each have taken on." [...] Fowle felt [...] "Clarke's relative forgiveness of Lexa makes sense {{within the context of the}} war of her people, and the larger political conflict at hand. When she kneels before Lexa , it's loyalty informed by weeks of patient storytelling." ...|$|E

2500|$|The {{story of}} Kullervo from Finnish mythology {{contains}} elements similar to Elric's story, {{such as a}} talking magic sword and fatal alienation of the hero from his family. [...] Besides Elric, Kullervo has been proposed as having influence on Poul Anderson's 1954 novel The Broken Sword, and J.R.R. Tolkien's TÃºrin Turambar. [...] Moorcock has stated that [...] "Anderson's a definite influence , as stated. But oddly, the Kalevala was read to us at my boarding school when I was about seven", and [...] "from {{a very early age}} I was reading Norse legends and any books I could find about Norse stories". [...] Moorcock in the same posting stated [...] "one thing I'm <b>pretty</b> <b>sure</b> of, <b>I</b> was not in any way directly influenced by Prof. T".|$|R

I was the nearest neighbour, and I used to ride over to the Double-Elm {{anywhere}} from nine to sixteen times a week with fresh butter or a quarter of venison or a sample of new sheep-dip just as a frivolous excuse to see Marilla. Marilla and me got to be extensively inveigled with each other, and I was <b>pretty</b> <b>sure</b> <b>I</b> was going to get my rope around her neck and lead her over to the Lomito.

My things must all be bought at haphazard, as they can be got out of my poor little allowance,--and things are getting so horridly dear! Only think of it, girls! gloves at two and a quarter! and boots at seven, eight, and ten dollars! and then, as you say, the fashions changing so! Why, I bought a sack last fall and gave forty dollars for it, and this winter I'm wearing it, to be sure, but it has no style at all,--looks quite antiquated!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Perhaps," [...] replied Granny mildly, [...] "but I've {{noticed that}} it is the one who has an eye open for all the little ifs in life that fares the best. Now I've kept an eye on that henyard, and I've noticed that very often Farmer Brown's boy doesn't close the henyard gate at night. I suppose he thinks that if the {{henhouse}} door is locked, the gate doesn't matter. Any one who is careless about one thing, is likely to be careless about another. Sometime he may forget to close that hole. I told you that we would try for one of those hens to-morrow morning, but the more I think about it, the more I think it will be wiser to visit that henhouse a few nights before we run the risk of trying to catch a hen in broad daylight. In fact, I am <b>pretty</b> <b>sure</b> <b>I</b> can make Farmer Brown's boy forget to close that gate." ...|$|E

I have known such passions at every period of my life, but it is mainly of the loves of my youth that I shall write, and I shall write all the more frankly because my own youth now seems to me rather more alien than that of any other person.|$|R

'I do; {{hoping that}} it is not laziness and {{weakness}} that makes me abstain from nagging about what is not brought before my eyes by the children or the police--I mean Gill, Halfpenny, and Miss Vincent.

At least, I hope it does. <b>I</b> am <b>pretty</b> <b>sure</b> that if <b>I</b> punished Wilfred for every teasing trick I know, or guess at, he would--in his present mood--only become deceitful, and esprit de corps might make Val and Fergus the same, though I don't think Mysie's truth could be shaken any more than honest Phyl's.' ...|$|R

6000|$|The {{lanterns}} had somewhat dazzled me, and I ploughed distressfully among {{stones and}} rubbish-heaps. All the other {{houses in the}} village were both dark and silent; and though I knocked at {{here and there a}} door, my knocking was unanswered. It was a bad business; I gave up Fouzilhac with my curses. The rain had stopped, and the wind, which still kept rising, began to dry my coat and trousers. [...] "Very well," [...] thought I, [...] "water or no water, I must camp." [...] But the first thing was to return to Modestine. I am <b>pretty</b> <b>sure</b> <b>I</b> was twenty minutes groping for my lady in the dark; and {{if it had not been}} for the unkindly services of the bog, into which I once more stumbled, I might have still been groping for her at the dawn. My next business was to gain the shelter of a wood, for the wind was cold as well as boisterous. How, in this well-wooded district, I should have been so long in finding one, is another of the insoluble mysteries of this day's adventures; but I will take my oath that I put near an hour to the discovery.|$|E
60|$|But {{the perils}} of the deep {{were part of the}} programme; and though I am very glad to be done with them for a while and comfortably ashore, where a squall does not matter a snuff to any one, I feel <b>pretty</b> <b>sure</b> <b>I</b> shall want to get to sea again ere long. The dreadful risk I took was financial, and double-headed. First, I had to sink {{a lot of money in}} the cruise, and if I didn't get health, how was I to get it back? I have got health to a {{wonderful}} extent; and as I have the most interesting matter for my book, bar accidents, I ought to get all I have laid out and a profit. But, second (what I own I never considered till too late), there was the danger of collisions, of damages and heavy repairs, of disablement, towing, and salvage; indeed, the cruise might have turned round and cost me double. Nor will this danger be quite over till I hear the yacht is in San Francisco; for though I have shaken the dust of her deck from my feet, I fear (as a point of law) she is still mine till she gets there.|$|E

[She laughs.] And when a woman wants a thing, she is apt {{to be a bit}} unscrupulous about how she gets it. [She moves about the room, touching the flowers, rearranging a cushion, a vase.] I didn't invent the bishop; that was George's embroidery. [Another laugh.] But, of course, I ought to have told you everything myself. I ought not to have wanted a man to whom it would have made one atom of difference whether my cousins were scullery-maids or not. Somehow, I felt that to you it might. [Vernon winces.] It's natural enough. You have a big position to maintain. I didn't know you were a lord--that was your doing. George did find it out, but he never told me; least of all, that you were Lord Bantock--or you may be <b>pretty</b> <b>sure</b> <b>I</b> should have come out with the truth, if only for my own sake. It hasn't been any joke for me, coming back here.|$|E
60|$|We {{read that}} there was not a brook in Truro. Yet there were deer here once, which must often have panted in vain; but <b>I</b> am <b>pretty</b> <b>sure</b> that <b>I</b> {{afterward}} saw a small fresh-water brook emptying into the south side of Pamet River, though I was so heedless as not to taste it. At any rate, a little boy near by told me that he drank at it. There was not a tree as far as we could see, and that was many miles each way, the general level of the upland being about the same everywhere. Even from the Atlantic side we overlooked the Bay, and saw to Manomet Point in Plymouth, and better from that side because it was the highest. The almost universal bareness and smoothness of the landscape were as agreeable as novel, making it so much the more like the deck of a vessel. We saw vessels sailing south into the Bay, on the one hand, and north along the Atlantic shore, on the other, all with an aft wind.|$|R
