40|$|Research PaperLoligo gahi (<b>Patagonian</b> longfin <b>squid)</b> {{has been}} the target of a major trawl fishery in the waters around the Falkland Islands since the early 1980 s. The catch of this {{short-lived}} species can fluctuate markedly due to variation in seasonal recruitment. Ex-vessel prices of loligo are also variable due to international market conditions and variation in the average size of squid landed. Given the importance of the fishery to the Falkland Islands, there is considerable interest in exploring opportunities to improve the value of the fishery through alternative harvest strategies, industry involvement in downstream market sectors, and by establishing rights-based management regimes. To evaluate these opportunities, cost and market data were collected. Hedonic output price and input cost models were empirically estimated and used to determine revenues and profits for three years from 1999 through 2001. Results show that the industry as currently structured has been relatively profitable at moderate stock and recruitment levels but may be unprofitable at low stock and recruitment levels. The implications of these findings for developing an integrated bioeconomic model of the fishery are discussed...|$|R
40|$|This paper shows CPUEs of Loligo gahi and Illex argentinus by Spanish vessels {{operating}} in the SW Atlantic from 1988 to 2001. The analysis of the raw data in a haul-by-haul basis indicated that the maximum CPUE for Loligo was obtained on the High Seas in March 2001 (6, 372 kg/h), whereas for Illex, it reached 15, 000 kg/h also on the High Seas in May 2001 (Division 42 º S). Maximum mean monthly CPUE for Loligo almost reached 2, 000 kg/h during August and September 2000 to the South of the Falklands (MS), {{as well as for}} Illex, a maximum value of around 2, 700 kg/h was observed in February 2000 in Division 46 º S. Both species are highly influenced by the oceanographic conditions of the area. Shortfin squid (Illex argentinus) performs yearly large migratory movements from the South of Brazil to Falklands, maybe related to its life cycle. <b>Patagonian</b> longfin <b>squid</b> (Loligo gahi) is more confined to a relative small area within Falklands waters, named Loligo-box, but with great explosions of abundance in Autumn (March to May). The seasonality observed in catches may be related to seasonality in fishing behaviour, abundance and/or in recruitments (Portela et al, 2002) ...|$|R
40|$|The seven star {{flying squid}} Martialia hyadesi is an oceanic slope ommastrephid with a {{circumpolar}} distribution {{associated with the}} Antarctic Polar Frontal Zone (APFZ) and is a minor, variable catch in the South Atlantic Illex argentinus fishery. There have been occasional unusually large catches of M. hyadesi, the latest being in 1995. Because {{of the importance of}} understanding the influence of the physical environment on fisheries for oceanic squid, and interest in developing a new fishery for M. hyadesi in the CCAMLR area, we examined specimens and data from the 1995 season and analysed 10 yr fisheries and remotely sensed oceanographic data sets from the area. The 1995 data show that M. hyadesi remains in the cool APFZ waters of the Falkland Current where it preys on oceanic fish and crustaceans and its distribution rarely extends over the <b>Patagonian</b> Shelf. The <b>squid</b> exploited by the fishery in 1995 were 6 to 12 mo old; females were immature but some males were fully mature. A remotely sensed sea surface temperature (SST) image revealed mesoscale features at the shelf break front between Patagonian Shelf water and APFZ water where the squid were caught. The appearance of M. hyadesi in the fishery over the last decade, including 1995, has been related to SST anomalies. Teleconnections probably exist between these anomalies, El Niño/Southern Oscillation (ENSO) events in the Pacific and sub-decadal oceanographic instability in the Antarctic. Squid are short-lived and populations are {{likely to be able to}} respond rapidly to environmental change. However, it is not clear at what stage in the life cycle of M. hyadesi these oceanographic events exert their effect. We propose 2 alternative, but not mutually exclusive, hypotheses. Warm events prior to the appearance of M. hyadesi may favour reproductive success of the parent generation giving rise to a strong recruitment, or alternatively this cool water species may extend its range to the edge of the Patagonian Shelf early in the development of cold oceanographic events. In either case oceanographic effects are probably mediated via the squid's prey...|$|R

The {{early development}} of the <b>Patagonian</b> <b>squid,</b> Loligo gahi D'Orbigny, 1835, was studied {{in the field and}} in the laboratory. Egg strands, spawned off San Lorenzo Island, Peru, were collected, carried to the laboratory, and incubated in a closed sea water system. Egg capsules ranged from 88 to 169 mm in length, and each capsule contained between 56 and 114 fertilized eggs. Individual eggs ranged from 1, 7 to 2, 1 mm in length, and the mantle length of hatchlings varied from 1, 9 to 2, 8 mm. Development took about 20 days at a mean temperature of 19 ºC. The pattern of embryonic development is similar to that previously observed in other species of Loligo. Following hatching, paralarvaes survived for 45 days with a diet of zooplankton (copepods, mysids and polychaete larvaes) ...|$|E

40|$|Knowledge of diet is {{critical}} in interpreting the ecological roles of marine top predators and provides information towards their conservation and management. The Falkland Islands hold {{the largest number of}} breeding gentoo penguins. Yet knowledge of gentoo penguin diet at the Falklands is limited to either broad taxonomic divisions of prey items or dietary samples collected only on a single day. This study is the first to investigate gentoo penguin diet at Cow Bay, Falklands, to the species level, over repeated sampling intervals during the breeding period. Through stomach content analysis, we determined diet over a large temporal scale (2002 / 2003 / 2004 – 2011 / 2012 / 2013) and between the guard and crèche periods of chick rearing. The principle prey item by reconstituted mass was rock cod fish Patagonotothen spp., for all periods (47 – 78 %) except that of the 2012 / 2013 crèche period (19 %) when Falkland herring Sprattus fugensis made up the bulk of the diet (52 %). Of the cephalopods recovered, <b>Patagonian</b> <b>squid</b> Doryteuthis gahi was prominent (1 – 24 %), while crustaceans contributed negligibly to gentoo penguin diet. Our findings revealed that gentoo penguins breeding at the Falkland Islands were primarily demersal foragers with an ability for pelagic feeding.

40|$|Genetic {{population}} {{structure of the}} commercially fished <b>Patagonian</b> <b>squid</b> Loligo gahi d'Orbigny was examined by collecting 19 samples (1189 individuals) from Falkland waters between March 1987 and April 1988 and subjecting individuals to electrophoretic and morphometric analysis. Morphological features (dorsal mantle length, fin length oblique, fin width, interorbital width, tentacle length, length of arms I and II, and mid-mantle circumference), sex and stage of reproductive maturity (Lipinski's universal scale) were recorded prior to electrophoresis. Analyses of allele frequencies at six polymorphic loci provided no evidence of stock separation, and the frequency distribution of genotypic classes almost exclusively fitted Hardy-Weinberg expectations for a randomly interbreeding population. Nei's mean genetic distances and identities between samples ranged from 0. 000 – 0. 002 and 0. 997 – 1. 00, respectively, supporting the contention of a genetically homogeneous breeding unit. Multivariate analyses revealed {{significant differences in the}} morphometrics among certain samples collected at approximately the same time, especially of interorbital width, first arm length and fin width. This morphological differentiation was not correlated with differences at the genetic level. The frequency distribution of dorsal mantle length and stages of reproductive maturity through the year were compatible with two alternative interpretations of {{population structure}}: (i) the existence of two temporally distinct separate spawning populations, one autumn- and the other spring-spawning, or, (ii) that slow-growing or late spawned individuals spawn at 18 months old while most squid spawn at 1 yr old in the austral spring and summer. Although {{it is not possible to}} discount either interpretation unequivocally, the latter hypothesis of population structure is more congruent with existing genetic evidence...|$|E
