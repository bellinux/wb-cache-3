25|$|In theory, {{this factor}} should not affect any {{individual}} consumer's ability {{to compare the}} APR of the same product (same duration loan) across vendors. APR may not, however, be <b>particularly</b> <b>helpful</b> when attempting to compare different products.|$|E
25|$|Other {{exceptions}} {{also exist}} {{such as the}} one in which minors who naturalize independently from their parents will not lose their Dutch citizenship. That was <b>particularly</b> <b>helpful</b> prior to 1985, when the age of majority was 21.|$|E

25|$|Some polyhedronists {{take the}} view that stellation is a two-way process, such that any two polyhedra sharing the same face planes are stellations of each other. This is {{understandable}} if one is devising a general algorithm suitable {{for use in a}} computer program, but is otherwise not <b>particularly</b> <b>helpful.</b>|$|E
25|$|Many {{institutions}} {{have worked to}} provide options for bystanders who see behavior they find unacceptable. These options are usually provided through complaint systems—so bystanders have choices about where to go. One option that is <b>particularly</b> <b>helpful</b> is that of an organizational ombudsman, who keeps no records for the employer and is near-absolutely confidential.|$|E
50|$|Physical {{examination}} {{is usually}} not <b>helpful,</b> <b>particularly</b> early in the course. Subcutaneous emphysema (crepitation) is an important diagnostic finding but is not very sensitive, being present in only 9 of 34 patients (27 percent) in one series. A pleural effusion may be detected.|$|R
30|$|When {{endoscopic}} haemostasis {{cannot be}} achieved, transcatheter arterial embolisation (TAE) (Fig. 10) may be <b>helpful,</b> <b>particularly</b> in frail patients. Compared to surgery, TAE {{has a slightly}} lower rate of haemostasis (91 % versus 100 %) and more frequent rebleeding (40 % versus 15 %), but is associated with fewer complications and better overall outcome [17].|$|R
30|$|In {{musculoskeletal}} (MSK) MRI, the T 1 signal {{intensity is}} described by comparison to that of muscle. Although many argue that muscle should also be the standard reference for T 2 -weighted imaging, using fat as the reference can be <b>helpful,</b> <b>particularly</b> in anatomic regions where there is relatively little muscle (e.g. fingers and toes).|$|R
25|$|The {{diagnosis}} can {{be confirmed}} in the laboratory by finding an absence or deficiency of the ATM protein in cultured blood cells, an absence or deficiency of ATM function (kinase assay), or mutations in both copies of the cell’s ATM gene. These more specialized tests are not always needed, but are <b>particularly</b> <b>helpful</b> if a child’s symptoms are atypical.|$|E
25|$|For {{any given}} finite problem, the {{probability}} that the simulated annealing algorithm terminates with a global optimal solution approaches 1 as the annealing schedule is extended. This theoretical result, however, is not <b>particularly</b> <b>helpful,</b> since the time required to ensure a significant probability of success will usually exceed the time required for a complete search of the solution space.|$|E
25|$|One method Tufte {{encourages}} {{to allow}} quick visual comparison of multiple series {{is the small}} multiple, a chart with many series shown on {{a single pair of}} axes that can often be easier to read when displayed as several separate pairs of axes placed next to each other.

40|$|The mechanosensitive {{channel of}} small conductance, MscS, {{is one of}} the most {{extensively}} studied MS channels to date. Past and present research involves the discovery of its physiological role as an emergency valve in prokaryotes up to detailed investigations of its conductive properties and gating mechanism. In this review, we summarize the findings on its structure and function obtained by experimental and theoretical approaches. A special focus is given to its pharmacology, since various compounds have been shown to affect the activity of this channel. These compounds have <b>particularly</b> been <b>helpful</b> for understanding the interaction of MscS with the lipid bilayer, as well as recognizing the potential of this channel as a target for novel types of antibiotics...|$|R

25|$|A DBN {{can be used}} to generatively pre-train a DNN {{by using}} the learned DBN weights as the initial DNN weights. Backpropagation or other discriminative {{algorithms}} can then tune these weights. This is <b>particularly</b> <b>helpful</b> when training data are limited, because poorly initialized weights can significantly hinder model performance. These pre-trained weights are in a region of the weight space that is closer to the optimal weights than were they randomly chosen. This allows for both improved modeling and faster convergence of the fine-tuning phase.|$|E
25|$|Design {{was carried}} out by William McLellan of Merz & McLellan. Construction began three years later in 1932 and was {{completed}} in 1936. The scheme was made viable by the recent formation of the National Grid which made generation of electricity in remote areas useful. Hydro power was <b>particularly</b> <b>helpful</b> to this grid because of its ability to be turned on and off very quickly to meet peak demands (in contrast to oil and coal stations), and to meet the natural increase during the more energy demanding winter months.|$|E
25|$|Several chromosome-banding {{techniques}} {{are used in}} cytogenetics laboratories. Quinacrine banding (Q-banding) was the first staining method used to produce specific banding patterns. This method requires a fluorescence microscope {{and is no longer}} as widely used as Giemsa banding (G-banding). Reverse banding, or R-banding, requires heat treatment and reverses the usual black-and-white pattern that is seen in G-bands and Q-bands. This method is <b>particularly</b> <b>helpful</b> for staining the distal ends of chromosomes. Other staining techniques include C-banding and nucleolar organizing region stains (NORstains). These latter methods specifically stain certain portions of the chromosome. C-banding stains the constitutive heterochromatin, which usually lies near the centromere, and NORstaining highlights the satellites and stalks of acrocentric chromosomes.|$|E

30|$|Several {{diagnostic}} imaging methodologies {{are available for}} the clinical evaluation of sarcoidosis, but all have their limitations. FDG PET/CT is frequently used, but this technique does not provide optimal results in all cases. Novel radiopharmaceuticals aimed at other disease targets may be <b>helpful,</b> <b>particularly</b> in cardiac sarcoidosis when FDG PET/CT has a low diagnostic accuracy, due to difficulties in preparing the patients who should use a specific diet combined with prolonged fasting. 68 Ga-labeled somatostatin based receptor hybrid imaging is a potential alternative to FDG PET/CT.|$|R

25|$|Once befriended, kappa may perform {{any number}} of tasks for human beings, such as helping farmers irrigate their land. Sometimes, they bring fresh fish, which is {{regarded}} as a mark of good fortune for the family that receives it. They are also highly knowledgeable about medicine, and legend states that they taught the art of bone setting to human beings. Due to these benevolent aspects, some shrines are dedicated to the worship of <b>particularly</b> <b>helpful</b> kappa. There were also festivals meant to placate the kappa in order to obtain a good harvest, some of which still take place today. These festivals generally took place during the two equinoxes of the year, when the kappa are said to travel from the rivers to the mountains and vice versa.|$|E
25|$|Taylor’s {{reasons for}} moving from Iowa and to Florida in 1910 are not clearly defined. Scattered {{reference}} to health problems {{throughout his life}} in the Midwest and his move to Ottumwa for health reasons suggest that Taylor suffered from pulmonary difficulties and that he sought out those places believed to be curative for pulmonary problems. Taylor also was a Mason and had attended a national meeting of Masons in Jacksonville, Florida in 1900 as the president of Iowa’s Prince Hall Masons. His Negro Solicitor had a southern readership, and he was known among the nation’s Black journalists. Jacksonville’s Black population was large, employment opportunities were much better than in Ottumwa, and hot springs on Florida’s eastern coast were believed to be <b>particularly</b> <b>helpful</b> for persons with pulmonary problems.|$|E
25|$|No {{official}} statement {{has been made}} on the reasons behind the choice of F/A-18 fighters as Australia's primary combat commitment, but it is commonly assumed that the obvious alternative of sending a substantial land force instead was considered to involve an unacceptably high risk of casualties, particularly given the possibility of house-to-house fighting in Iraqi cities. Iraq is largely landlocked, and Australia no longer has a fixed-wing naval aviation component; thus, a larger naval commitment could not be considered <b>particularly</b> <b>helpful.</b> The choice of the F/A-18 deployment rather than of the F-111 tactical bomber {{may have been due}} to the higher cost of operation of the F-111, and its use being limited to more politically contentious ground attack missions rather than more uncontentious tasks like combat air patrols.|$|E

30|$|Experts’ {{opinion that}} joint {{consortium}} {{may be one}} of the options for handling returns just like telecommunication tower sharing in India. Earlier companies had their own telecommunication towers. Later on companies started tower sharing and now one tower in a particular region is being used by many companies reducing their investments and operational costs. There is need of exploring such kind of business model, for example common collection centre for all used cellular phones may reduce collection cost and also, economies of scale can be achieved. Joint consortium may be <b>helpful,</b> <b>particularly</b> in case of recycling where high product volume is important.|$|R
25|$|The urate to {{creatinine}} (breakdown {{product of}} creatine phosphate in muscle) concentration ratio in urine is elevated. This {{is a good}} indicator of acid overproduction. For children under ten years of age with LNS, a urate to creatinine ratio above two is typically found. Twenty-four-hour urate excretion of more than 20mg/kg is also typical but is not diagnostic. Hyperuricemia (serum uric acid concentration of >8mg/dL) is often present but not reliable enough for diagnosis. Activity of the HGPRT enzyme in cells from any type of tissue (e.g., blood, cultured fibroblasts, or lymphoblasts) that is less than 1.5% of normal enzyme activity confirms the diagnosis of Lesch–Nyhan syndrome. Molecular genetic studies of the HPRT gene mutations may confirm diagnosis, and are <b>particularly</b> <b>helpful</b> for subsequent 'carrier testing' in at-risk females such as close family relatives on the female side.|$|E
25|$|Francisc Rainer was {{a native}} of Rohozna town, near Czernowitz, in Austrian-controlled Bukovina. His parents were Lutheran, but baptized their son Roman Catholic. His father, Gustav Adolf Ignatz Rainer, emigrated to the Romanian Old Kingdom as an {{employee}} of the Strusberg Company that built the Bucharest-Giurgiu railway, the country's first. Remaining there, he obtained a post in the administration of Căile Ferate Române. His mother Maria (or Ana) came from a clerical family, and was a housewife. The boy received his primary education at home from his parents, later attending Saint Sava National College. Among the teachers who were <b>particularly</b> <b>helpful</b> was Sabba Ștefănescu in natural sciences. Rainer read extensively, teaching himself Latin and Ancient Greek, and becoming passionate about the literary works of Goethe and the philosophy of Arthur Schopenhauer. He slowly discarded the latter's influence when he discovered Heraclitus, Ernst Haeckel, and classical materialistic thought. Such works diverted him from his original goal of becoming a Catholic missionary.|$|E
25|$|As president, one of Obregón's top {{priorities}} was securing US diplomatic {{recognition of his}} regime, to resume normal Mexico–United States relations. Although he rejected the U.S. demand that Mexico rescind Article 27 of the constitution, Obregón negotiated a major agreement with the United States, the Bucareli Treaty of August 1923 that made some concessions to the US {{in order to gain}} diplomatic recognition. It was <b>particularly</b> <b>helpful</b> when the Mexican Supreme Court, in a case brought by Texas Oil, declared that Article 27 did not apply retroactively. Another important arena in which Obregón resolved issues with the U.S. and other foreign governments was the Mexican-United States General Claims Commission. Finance Minister Adolfo de la Huerta signed a deal in which Mexico recognized a debt of $1.451million to international bankers. Finally, at the Bucareli Conference, Obregón agreed to an American demand that Mexico would not expropriate any foreign oil companies, and in exchange, the U.S. recognized his government. Many Mexicans criticized Obregón as a sellout (entreguista), including Adolfo de la Huerta for his actions at the Bucareli Conference.|$|E

40|$|The {{research}} {{examined the}} relationship between counsellor awareness of client-identified helpful events and session and event level outcome. Furthermore, counselling participants' experiences of the change processes in high and low counsellor awareness were also examined. Quantitative and qualitative methods were used to analyze ratings and word responses of clients' and counsellors' perspectives about how therapeutic change came about in helpful therapy events. Results of the quantitative study indicated no association between counsellor awareness and session and event level outcome. Results of the qualitative study indicated that in helpful events that therapists were most aware of, clients described the process as <b>particularly</b> more <b>helpful</b> than events where therapists were least aware. Descriptions from the high awareness events indicated that therapists tended to be most aware of client selected helpful events characterized by an interpersonal therapeutic focus, with clients expressing and exploring negative feelings toward significant others. Descriptions from the low awareness events indicated that therapists were least aware of client selected helpful events where clients were working toward identifying their feelings and understanding unwanted aspects of themselves...|$|R
