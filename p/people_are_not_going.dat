5000|$|An often {{forgotten}} aspect on online interactions is {{the possible}} danger present.

Hidden identities are often used in cases of Cyber-bullying and Cyberstalking. Concealing your true identity is also a technique {{that can be used to}} manipulate your new online friend or lover into convincing them you are someone completely different. This is something most online predators do in order to prey on victims. Despite the awareness of dangers, Mishna et al. found children and youth to still partake in online relationships with little care or concern for negative effects. Brym and Lenton also claim that [...] "although their true identities are usually concealed, they sometimes decide to meet and interact in real life".

50|$|Uplifting the Black {{family was}} an {{important}} part of Black unity and self-determination. The Black family, especially Black women, was expected {{to play an important role}} in shaping the next generation. Although the viewer never see who Friday's parents are, her younger brother, Cleave, whom she cares for, is a presence in the film. Cleave represents the next generation in this film. He is intelligent, young, brave and quick witted as we can see from his interactions with the neighborhood pimp, Fancy, but also innocent. Friday's mission to find and have the hitmen arrested is also a mission to protect her younger brother (the next generation). This mission becomes clear in the scene where the hitman tries to kill Friday in her apartment. Her younger brother, not knowing anything about the present danger directs the hitman to their apartment. In doing this, the film induces fear, not only for Friday's life, but her bother's also. As we are to assume that Friday is his only family, if she were to die, her brother would become an orphan and might fall victim to the common traps of Black life—poverty, drugs, gangs, etc. Grier herself talks about the disintegration of Black family in an interview with Ebony. <b>People</b> <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>going</b> to church anymore. There's more corruption, more kids dropping out, more young girls from the ages for 13 to 16 who are becoming pregnant. Families have disintegrated. Our parents aren't as strict today.
