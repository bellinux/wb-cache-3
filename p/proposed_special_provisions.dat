40|$|This paper {{discusses}} the network architecture, its constituent functional entities, {{as well as}} the algorithms needed in support of mobility. In order to achieve minimum impact on the connection quality when a user crosses the boundaries of a cell, a so called "smart buffering technique" has been designed. Throughout the <b>proposed</b> design, <b>special</b> <b>provision</b> has been taken to minimize modifications or extensions, required on existing fixed ATM infrastructure. In this respect, existing versions of B-ISDN signaling protocols (Q. 2931, ATMF UNI 3. 1) are considered, which are enhanced by a supplementary mobility related protoco...|$|R
40|$|Two years ago, {{the author}} {{completed}} a study with researchers at Virginia Tech {{that was designed}} to develop a tool to measure and control segregation of hot-mix asphalt pavements. This earlier work focused on the application of high-speed texture measurements and ultimately proposed an approach that would discourage segregation by establishing limits on allowable fluctuation of pavement macrotexture. Rather than emphasize segregation detection and measurement, the <b>proposed</b> <b>special</b> <b>provision</b> promoted new-surface uniformity. The activities discussed in this report represent {{the next step in the}} process of understanding the relationship between the uniformity and surface characteristics of hot-mix asphalt. The study documents the typical “texture profile ” for Virginia’s most common surface mixes. It revisits the texture-fluctuation provision proposed in the earlier project and delves into an expanded use of elevation profiles for promoting uniformity. Although the major findings and conclusions from this work do not specifically support a texture-based “segregation specification, ” the study does advocate continued dedication to material and construction uniformity. Alternatives to a texture-based specification include quality measures that recognize variability of traditional quality characteristics (such as percent defective and percent within limits specifications) and a new approach to reporting and using ride quality data, i. e., “roughness profiles. ...|$|R

25|$|Congress reconsidered the Act in 2006 as the <b>special</b> <b>provisions</b> {{were due}} to expire in 2007. Civil rights {{organizations}} advocated for the renewal and strengthening of the <b>special</b> <b>provisions.</b> As a matter of principle, Democrats generally supported renewing the <b>special</b> <b>provisions.</b> However, the Republican Party controlled both chambers of Congress and the presidency, and many Republicans considered the preclearance requirement an affront to states' rights and the principle of color-blindness. Furthermore, conservatives believed that the primary beneficiaries of the <b>special</b> <b>provisions</b> were African Americans, who overwhelmingly and increasingly voted for Democratic Party candidates. However, Republicans were receiving increasing support from some language minority groups, particularly Hispanics and Asian Americans, {{and they did not}} wish to risk losing that support by refusing to reauthorize the <b>special</b> <b>provisions.</b> Republicans also recognized that the Act often helped Republican candidates win by requiring jurisdictions to pack Democratic-leaning racial minorities into few electoral districts. In addition, House Judiciary Committee Chair Jim Sensenbrenner (R-WI) had a strong desire to reauthorize the <b>special</b> <b>provisions,</b> and he led an early effort to pass a reauthorization bill before his chairmanship expired at the end of 2006. Thus, a consensus in favor of reauthorizing the <b>special</b> <b>provisions</b> emerged early in the legislative process.|$|R

Ultimately, Congress determined that although significant progress had been made in reducing racial discrimination in voting since 1965, sufficient discrimination existed to justify extending the <b>special</b> <b>provisions.</b>|$|R
