40|$|SUMMARY: <b>Phosphatic</b> <b>chalks</b> {{occur in}} erosional troughs cut into soft white chalks of late Coniacian to Santonian age and based by {{strongly}} lithified and mineralized hardgrounds. The dominant mineralogy consists of low-Mg calcite, carbonate-fluorapatite, a-quartz, glauconite and iron oxides. Lithification is geochemically discernible- 90 cm {{below the surface}} of the basal hardgrounds and results in a calcite-associated enrichment in Fe, Mn and Mg but depletion in Sr. Factor analysis indicates 4 major controls on the lement distributions-carbonate-fluorapatite, clay minerals and silica, lithification, and iron minerals. White chalks are geochem-ically similar to modern coccolith oozes but hardgrounds have been indurated by the addition of a primary low-Mg calcite cement. Glauconitization was generally restricted to replacement of clay minerals during the early stages of hardground development while lithified carbonate remained in contact with seawater. Phosphatization occurred by the replacement of low-Mg calcite during burial of the hardground by an organic rich sediment. Mineralization was intimately related to organic processes. The Santonian to early Campanian <b>phosphatic</b> <b>chalks</b> of the Anglo-Paris Basin are pelletal phosphorite...|$|E
40|$|<b>Phosphatic</b> <b>chalks</b> were {{deposited}} {{during the}} mid-Santonian to early Campanian between 85 Ma and 83 Ma in NE France and southern England. The beds contain abundant brown granular phosphate, largely consisting of phosphate-filled and coated foraminiferal tests, phosphatized macrofossil fragments, faecal pellets, phosphatized intraclasts and vertebrate remains. Phosphate contents typically range from 5 – 20 % P 2 O 5. Beds 1 – 20 m thick occur within elongate 1 km long, 250 m wide and 30 m deep erosional basins (‘cuvettes’), {{cut into the}} underlying Coniacian–Santonian white chalks. Several superimposed cuvettes with consistent orientations may occur. Cuvettes are floored by phosphatized, bored and encrusted hardgrounds, and contain unique faunal assemblages that include ahermatypic colonial corals, and encrusting oyster and worm patches. Belemnites, fish and reptile remains are common. Extensive reworking by currents and biota occurred during the deposition of the phosphate. Gravity flow led to the dislocation and redeposition of basal hardground blocks {{and the formation of}} synsedimentary slump folds. <b>Phosphatic</b> <b>chalks</b> accumulated in water depths of between 70 m and a few hundred metres in oxic, current-swept areas of an open epicontinental sea of normal salinity. High surface productivity, moderate organic-carbon fluxes, reduced sedimentation rates and high rates of sediment mixing led to the precipitation of phosphate within hardground surfaces and carbonate grains. Bacterial decomposition of organic matter raised phosphate contents in pore waters and promoted the geochemical conditions necessary for phosphate precipitation. Phosphate precipitates, now transformed to carbonate fluorapatite, include μm-sized ovoid bodies and massive coatings interpreted to be of microbial origin. Phosphatization was a rapid process occurring under mixed aerobic/anaerobic redox conditions in the upper decimetre of the sediment column, close to the sediment–water interface. Phosphatization took place predominantly {{within the confines of the}} cuvettes, where phosphate grains became concentrated by current winnowing and transport. Phosphatic chalk sedimentation occurred on the NE and northern margins of the Anglo-Paris Basin following regressive events that enabled bottom currents to erode the cuvettes and maintain productivity and the other sedimentary conditions necessary for phosphate accumulation...|$|E
40|$|Ground {{investigations}} for the A 303 Stonehenge Tunnels {{revealed a}} unique and complex Chalk geology including {{the presence of the}} thickest (> 20 m thick), and previously unknown <b>phosphatic</b> <b>chalks</b> in England, partly filling fault controlled erosional channels. The use of natural gamma-ray borehole logs to determine the presence and thickness of the phosphatic deposits is of particular value and combined with the lithostratigraphy, macrofossil and nannofossil biostratigraphy from cores has, for the first time, accurately constrained the Coniacian to Santonian age and the lenticular geometry of such deposits. Four phosphatic chalk events between 88. 5 – 86. 5 Ma are recognised associated with synsedimentary faulting. We suggest a causal link between tectonics, subsidence and channel-formation, phosphatisation events, pulses of oceanic upwelling on a frequency of about 0. 5 million years to mantle-controlled plate tectonic episodes. The implications of this geology for construction of the A 303 and the archaeology of the area are discussed...|$|E

Stratigraphical correlations with the micromorphic brachiopod zones described by SURLYK for the white chalk of Denmark and Northern Germany are proposed.

40|$|Pelagic Cretaceous sediments, {{deposited}} {{in a range}} of palaeotectonic and palaeogeographic settings, from continents to oceans, are commonly black and bituminous. 3 particular time-envelopes define the major occurrences of such facies: late Barremian-Aptian-Albian, the Cenomanian-Turonian boundary and, to a lesser extent, the Coniacian-Santonian. These intervals define the duration of so-called Oceanic Anoxic Events during which global marine waters were relatively depleted in oxygen, and deposition of organic matter, derived from both terrestrial and planktonic sources, was widespread. Cretaceous OAEs correlate closely with transgressions, and such a correlation exists throughout the stratigraphical column. Flooding of land-masses is thought to have transported much terrestrial plant matterial seawards; the progressive increase in shelf-sea area is thought to have stimulated production of marine plankton. Bacterial consumption of this organic matter favoured the development of poorly oxygenated mid- to late Cretaceous waters in which many of the characteristic facies of the Period, including glauconitic sandstones and <b>phosphatic</b> <b>chalks,</b> were deposited.

40|$|Late Cretaceous elasmobranch faunas {{are known}} from {{numerous}} of NW Europe localities but their palaeoecological characteristics are still poorly known. Recent studies on Anglo-Paris Basin elasmobranch faunas from <b>phosphatic</b> <b>chalks</b> provided detailed {{data on the}} taxonomic composition of these communities. Results based on multiproxy analyses suggest peculiar conditions for Cenomanian faunas with numerous lamniforms and rare nectobenthic taxa indicative of dysoxic conditions. Changes in Turonian faunal composition correlate with a maximum in palaeotemperatures and transgressive environmental conditions. The northern Coniacian glauconitic palaeoenvironment provided cooler and shallow environments suitable for a few species with probable migration patterns. A model is proposed to explain the ecological features of the Santonian–Campanian faunas in which the habitat heterogeneity is the main factor controlling elasmobranch diversity and evenness. The dominance of small-sized species in Santonian–Campanian faunas {{is similar to the}} patterns observed in modern upwelling environments. Low beta diversity of early Campanian faunas suggests that although faunas were from disjunct upwelling erosional channels, the number of such palaeoenvironments provided a wide range of habitats allowing species to migrate depending on local ecological conditions. The Santonian/Campanian global cooling is synchronous with changes in faunal compositions. Larger-scale palaeoecological, palaeoenvironmental and palaeogeographical patterns are proposed based on comparisons with a number of other NW Europe elasmobranch faunas...|$|E
40|$|The <b>Phosphatic</b> <b>Chalk</b> of Ciply (upper part of {{the lower}} Lower Maastrichtian) was {{investigated}} for microbrachiopods in the Van Damme quarry at Ciply. Samples of this chalk were treated with a super saturated Glauber salt solution (method of SURLYK, 1972). Among the microbrachiopods collected, two new Megathyrididae were recognized: Megalhiris bidiscoidea n. sp. and Argyrotheca popielae n. sp. The presence of a new Megathiris species in this deposit is interesting because this genus is uncommon in Upper Cretaceous chalks...|$|R
40|$|Hardgrounds and {{omission}} {{surfaces are}} {{rare in the}} predominantly pelagic and hemi-pelagic chalk, chert and phosphorite lithofacies association that forms the Upper Cretaceous (Coniacian to Maastrichtian) Belqa Group succession in central Jordan. However, newly-described hardgrounds of regional extent {{at the base of}} the Dhiban Chalk Member (Campanian) in central and south Jordan reveal a complex history of sedimentation and early diagenesis. Following drowning of the Turonian carbonate platform during the Coniacian, the chalk-chert-phosphorite association was deposited on a pelagic ramp in fluctuating water depths. The Mujib Chalk and Dhiban Chalk members represent high-stand sea levels, separated by a regressive, lowstand chert-rich unit (Tafilah Member). Hardground successions can be traced over 100 km, and show an early diagenetic history of phosphatisation and biogenic silica lithification from opal-A to opal-CT and quartz that resulted in penecontemporaneous chert deformation, followed by submarine bioerosion and colonisation by corals and/or bivalves. Subsequent deposition of detrital, remanié <b>phosphatic</b> <b>chalk</b> passing up into pelagic coccolith-rich ooze reflects a transgressive third-order sea-level rise during the Early Campanian. These events provide a time-frame for early silica diagenesis and subsequent hardground development. Regional variations in the hardground successions and their early diagenesis are attributed to their precursor host sediment and relative palaeogeographic position on a homoclinal ramp at the southern margin of the Neo-Tethys Ocean...|$|R
40|$|New {{material}} of the calanticid cirripede Cretiscalpellum paucistriatum (WOODWARD, 1906) is recorded {{from the lower}} Maastrichtian (obtusa Zone) as exposed at the Saturn quarry, Kronsmoor (northern Germany); the carina is described for the first time. These specimens, together with material described previously in the literature, suggest C. paucistriatum {{to have been a}} shortlived offshoot of the C. striatum group, apparently confined to the interval from the lower obtusa to the lower sumensis zones of the lower Maastrichtian, with records to date from Norfolk (eastern England), southern Limburg (The Netherlands) and northern Germany. The species may thus be stratigraphically useful. To test this assumption, cirripede faunules from coeval strata in southern Belgium (Mons Basin; Ciply-Malogne <b>Phosphatic</b> <b>Chalk</b> Formation), eastern Denmark (Møn; white chalk facies), NE Germany (Rügen; white chalk facies) and even further afield (e. g., central and eastern Poland; opoka and white chalk facies) need to be screened. Although the general view is that the correlative value of cirripede taxa is rather limited, a tendency may be noted in the scalpellomorph genera Cretiscalpellum and Arcoscalpellum to develop short-lived species during the Late Cretaceous (Campanian and Maastrichtian). Such taxa, considered in conjunction with co-occurring members of the main lineages, may prove useful in (supra-) regional correlation, and cirripede ‘taxon range’ and ‘assemblage’ zones could thus be established...|$|R
