The aim of this work is to correlate surface properties of N-decanoyl amino acids at physiological pH and their toxicological profile in order to explore the potential use of these surfactants for …postprin...|$|E
40|$|Viruses {{are known}} to {{tolerate}} wide ranges of pH and salt conditions and to withstand internal pressures as high as 100 atmospheres. In this paper we investigate the mechanical properties of viral capsids, calling explicit attention to the inhomogeneity of the shells that is inherent to their discrete and <b>polyhedral</b> <b>nature.</b> We calculate the distribution of stress in these capsids and analyze their response to isotropic internal pressure (arising, for instance, from genome confinement and/or osmotic activity). We compare our results with appropriate generalizations of classical (i. e., continuum) elasticity theory. We also examine competing mechanisms for viral shell failure, e. g., in-plane crack formation versus radial bursting. The biological consequences of the special stabilities and stress distributions of viral capsids are also discussed. Comment: 12 page...|$|E
40|$|In {{this paper}} we study linear {{optimization}} {{problems with a}} newly introduced concept of multi-dimensional polyhedral linear second-order stochastic dominance constraints. By using the poly-hedral properties of this dominance condition we present a cutting-surface algorithm, and show its finite convergence. The cut generation problem is a difference of convex functions (DC) optimiza-tion problem. We exploit the polyhedral structure of this problem to present a novel branch-and-cut algorithm that incorporates concepts from concave minimization and binary integer programming. A linear programming problem is formulated for generating concavity cuts in our case, where the polyhedra is unbounded. We also present duality results for this problem relating the dual multipli-ers to utility functions, without the need to impose constraint qualifications, which again is possible because of the <b>polyhedral</b> <b>nature</b> of the problem. Numerical examples are presented showing the nature of solutions of our model...|$|E
40|$|One common {{feature of}} studies on trust is the variety of the construct’s typologies {{and the lack of}} a clear and {{generally}} agreed definition of the concept. This failure of alignment has been responsible for a lot of ‘communication’ problems among scholars. Often, when they suppose they are referring to the same construct, they are in reality dealing with very different concepts and types of trust. Academic comparison thus becomes sterile, and this causes different (and sometimes conflicting) interpretations. For these reasons and for further knowledge developments it is useful to order and clarify the <b>polyhedral</b> <b>nature</b> of trust. To fully appreciate the increasing complexity of trust literature, a review of the major research areas has been carried out. This makes it possible to understand the conceptual pitfalls of the construct, and the dimensions used to define the various trust typologies. The paper analyses: (1) the conceptual nature of the construct (expectation, belief, willingness, confidence or attitude); (2) its different dimensions (cognitive, emotional and behavioral aspects); (3) different trust typologies (target- content- and strength-based) ...|$|E
40|$|The {{plastic flow}} of a {{polycrystal}} is analyzed assuming grains as fine {{that the rate}} limiting process is grain boundary sliding, and grains readily accommodate their shapes by slip to preserve spatial continuity. It is shown that thinking of a polycrystal with randomly oriented grains as an homogeneous and isotropic continuum when dealing with it as a dynamical medium, even in a scale {{much larger than the}} grain size, leads to gross errors. The <b>polyhedral</b> <b>nature</b> of grains influences the plastic flow in a radical manner, as the relative velocity of adjacent grains is constrained to the common boundary plane, and only the in [...] plane shear stress contributes to their relative motion. This constriction determines that the divergency of the velocity field of the material medium does not vanish, and plastic deformation necessarily involves grain volume variations, which can only be elastic. As this has a limit, fracture follows as a necessary step of plastic flow. A theoretical approach to plastic flow is developed, and emphasis is done in superplastic deformation, from zero to fracture strain. The theory allows to quantitatively explain the observed features of superplastic materials and responds to many open questions in the field. Comment: 18 pages, 15 figures, research article.

40|$|In {{this thesis}} we study some {{critical}} {{problems in the}} area of Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) within the unifying framework of polyhedral characteristics of the production possibility sets and efficiency frontiers of important DEA models. Recent developments in DEA have made it possible to identify the efficient frontier explicitly. This thesis builds on these developments to make the following contributions. We establish theoretical results on the efficiency classifications of surfaces of the boundaries of the production possibility sets. These systematise existing research in the field and fill in many gaps. Our main results provide necessary and sufficient conditions for characterising fully-dimensional efficient surfaces. In addition, the new theoretical framework leads us to discover and address inconsistencies in the related literature. Next we study the sensitivity of efficiency classifications of Decision Making Units (DMUs) to data perturbations. In contrast to existing approaches, we study the effects of arbitrary data perturbations on the efficiency classifications of all DMUs. Theoretical constructs based on the <b>polyhedral</b> <b>nature</b> of production possibility sets lead to identifying a Conditional Stability Region for each DMU within which its data can be perturbed without affecting the efficiency classification of any other DMU. Finally, we develop a new methodology for cross-evaluation in DEA which replaces the traditional approach of peer evaluation by evaluating DMUs across all possible weights obtained from our explicit identification of the DEA production possibility set. The new approach eliminates some major flaws and weaknesses of the traditional approach and produces more meaningful results. Moreover, a set of extensions to the new approach lead to tools that allow identification of DMUs with unrealistic efficiency scores as well as the identification of under-achieving DMUs, a concept that is introduced here...|$|E
