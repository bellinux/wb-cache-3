30|$|Lastly, for {{the model}} with the {{addition}} of other explanatory variables such as the strength of IPR protection, per capita GDP, infrastructure index, political stability, regulatory quality and rule of law generated results similar with the other models. Entrepreneurial activity is, on average, lower by 0.36 <b>percentage</b> <b>point</b> from a <b>percentage</b> <b>point</b> increase in large firm dominance, 0.21 <b>percentage</b> <b>point</b> for opportunity-driven and 0.14 <b>percentage</b> <b>point</b> for necessity-driven entrepreneurs.|$|R
30|$|Similar {{observations}} can {{be inferred}} from the other two alternative models. The synthetic balanced dataset after getting the average 2002 – 2004 and 2005 – 2007 generated not statistically different coefficients of large firm dominance {{with that of the}} baseline model. Holding other factors constant, a percentage increase in large firms’ share to total employment is, on average, associated with 0.39 <b>percentage</b> <b>point</b> lower entrepreneurial activity, 0.26 <b>percentage</b> <b>point</b> lower for opportunity-driven entrepreneurs and 0.11 <b>percentage</b> <b>point</b> lower for necessity-driven entrepreneurs. Entrepreneurial intentions is likewise at risk for this alternative model, at 0.69 <b>percentage</b> <b>point</b> lower for a <b>percentage</b> <b>point</b> increase in large firm dominance, other things being equal.|$|R
30|$|The {{result is}} found robust based on {{alternative}} models/equations performed. Disregarding the year constant term, the coefficients of large firm dominance are not statistically different with the baseline model. A one-percentage point {{increase in the}} share of large firms to total employment is associated with 0.34 <b>percentage</b> <b>point</b> decrease in entrepreneurial activity, 0.21 <b>percentage</b> <b>point</b> for opportunity-driven entrepreneurs and 0.10 <b>percentage</b> <b>point</b> for necessity-driven ones, keeping all other factors constant. In addition, there is expected 0.53 <b>percentage</b> <b>point</b> decrease in entrepreneurial intentions from a higher large firm dominance, other factors remaining constant.|$|R

40|$|Using panel data {{of public}} {{unemployment}} expenditure {{as a percentage}} of GDP of 34 OECD nations across year 1980 - 2010, I explore the effect of this ratio on three unemployment outcomes: total unemployment rate, long-term unemployment rate and youth unemployment, as well as labor participation rate and investment rate. After taking into account potential endogeneity of this ratio using Durbin-Wu-Hausman test, I find the data does not support the hypothesized aggregate demand effect of unemployment insurance (UI) expenditure in theory but gives strong support for hypothesized disincentive effect in theory. The estimates indicate that every <b>percentage</b> <b>point</b> increase in public unemployment welfare expenditure relative to GDP leads to 0. 9 to 1. 1 <b>percentage</b> <b>point</b> increase in total unemployment rate and 4. 5 to 4. 7 <b>percentage</b> <b>point</b> increase in long term unemployment rate.

5|$|Life {{expectancy}} in India is at 68 years, {{with life}} expectancy for women being 69.6 years and for men being 67.3. There are around 50 physicians per 100,000 Indians. The number of Indians living {{in urban areas}} has grown by 31.2% between 1991 and 2001. Yet, in 2001, over 70% lived in rural areas. The level of urbanisation increased from 27.81% in 2001 Census to 31.16% in 2011 Census. The slowing down of the overall growth rate of population {{was due to the}} sharp decline in the growth rate in rural areas since 1991.
