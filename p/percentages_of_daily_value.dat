5000|$|Adding Up the Calcium: Nutrition Facts labels don't {{show how}} many milligrams of calcium {{are in a}} food item. Instead, they show the amount of calcium in a food as a <b>percentage</b> <b>of</b> the <b>Daily</b> <b>Value</b> (written as %Daily Value or %DV). To figure out milligrams on a food label, look at % <b>Daily</b> <b>Value</b> for calcium, and then add 0 {{to the end of}} that number. For example, girls need 130% DV for calcium every day. 130% <b>Daily</b> <b>Value</b> is the same amount as 1,300 milligrams of calcium. Note: This {{calculation}} works only for calcium, not for other nutrients on the food label.|$|R
40|$|Nutrition {{labels on}} food products-which are {{required}} for most prepared foods, such as breads, cereals, canned and frozen foods, snacks, desserts, drinks, etc. -were first mandated in the early 1970 s. They were revised extensively in 1992 {{as part of the}} Nutrition Labeling and Education Act (NLEA). Recently the Food and Drug Administration called for public comment on proposed changes to the program and solicited research related to the use and impact of the current label. In response to this request, a short consumer survey was conducted with 160 persons to see if they use the label, and, if so, which parts they use and their opinions about the usefulness of the current label. The majority of the respondents said they read the label most of the time before purchasing food, with 21 % stating they almost always do to. Parts of the label read most frequently were the calorie, fat, sugar, and fiber contents. <b>Percentages</b> <b>of</b> <b>daily</b> <b>values</b> were read less often, as were the health-related statements and the list of ingredients. Approximately half of those who consumed candy, bakery products, chips, or sodas-foods known to be high in calories-stated that they did not read the calorie content. Over two-thirds of the consumers felt confident that they understand how to read labels and said using a food label was better than relying on their own knowledge. However, the majority also though additional information about the label would be valuable. Most persons did not know the maximum calorie content of a low-calorie food, and stated that they would probably eat their favorite snack food even if it contained 400 calories per serving. Therefore, the calorie content of the food {{does not appear to have}} a major impact on the decision-making process. In conclusion, it was clear that the majority of the respondents used the label and perceived themselves as knowledgeable regarding its use. However, a more comprehensive survey is needed to measure the full extent of their knowledge and understanding. Food Consumption/Nutrition/Food Safety,...|$|R

40|$|Objective: A {{number of}} {{efforts have been}} {{conducted}} on travel behavior and transport fatalities at the neighborhood or street level, and they have identified different factors such as roadway characteristics, personal indicators, and design indicators related to transport safety. However, {{only a limited number}} of studies have considered the relationship between travel behavior indicators and the number of transport fatalities at the city level. Therefore, this study explores this relationship and how to fill the mentioned gap in current knowledge. Method: A generalized linear model (GLM) estimates the relationships between different travel mode indicators (e. g., length of motorway per inhabitants, number of motorcycles per inhabitant, <b>percentage</b> <b>of</b> <b>daily</b> trips on foot and by bicycle, <b>percentage</b> <b>of</b> <b>daily</b> trips by public transport) and the number of passenger transport fatalities. Because this city-level model is developed using data sets from different cities all over the world, the impacts of gross domestic product (GDP) are also included in the model. Conclusions: Overall, the results imply that the <b>percentage</b> <b>of</b> <b>daily</b> trips by public transport, the <b>percentage</b> <b>of</b> <b>daily</b> trips on foot and by bicycle, and the GDP per inhabitant have negative relationships with the number of passenger transport fatalities, whereas motorway length and the number of motorcycles have positive relationships with the number of passenger transport fatalities...|$|R

40|$|To {{investigate}} {{the association between}} <b>percentage</b> <b>of</b> total <b>daily</b> energy intake consumed at breakfast and weight change in middle-aged men and women, the authors analyzed data from a prospective population-based cohort study from Norfolk, United Kingdom.

Participants completed a 7 -day food diary at baseline, and objective measurements of height and weight were carried out at baseline and follow-up (1998 - 2000). Mean baseline body mass index (weight (kg) /height (m) (2)) was lowest among persons in the highest quintile <b>of</b> <b>percentage</b> <b>of</b> <b>daily</b> energy consumed at breakfast (mean values were 26. 0 in the highest quintile and 26. 3 in the lowest quintile), despite higher daily total energy intake in this group.

This kind of separation has not been demonstrated in the literature.
