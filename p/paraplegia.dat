5|$|In other diseases, {{defects in}} nuclear genes lead to {{dysfunction}} of mitochondrial proteins. This {{is the case}} in Friedreich's ataxia, hereditary spastic <b>paraplegia,</b> and Wilson's disease. These diseases are inherited in a dominance relationship, as applies to most other genetic diseases. A variety of disorders can be caused by nuclear mutations of oxidative phosphorylation enzymes, such as coenzyme Q10 deficiency and Barth syndrome. Environmental influences may interact with hereditary predispositions and cause mitochondrial disease. For example, there may be a link between pesticide exposure and the later onset of Parkinson's disease. Other pathologies with etiology involving mitochondrial dysfunction include schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, dementia, Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, epilepsy, stroke, cardiovascular disease, chronic fatigue syndrome, retinitis pigmentosa, and diabetes mellitus.|$|E
5|$|Subsequent {{chapters}} expound on how {{the arrangement}} came to be: the children's stepmother, Parwana, grew up as the less-favored child to her beautiful twin sister Masooma. One day, {{in a flash of}} jealousy, she caused Masooma to suffer a debilitating injury that resulted in <b>paraplegia.</b> Parwana subsequently spent several years caring for her sister until the latter asked her to help her commit suicide and to then marry Saboor. Their older brother, Nabi, left to work for Mr. Wahdati, a wealthy man in Kabul, and became infatuated with his wife, Nila. After Nila expressed dismay about her inability to have children, Nabi arranged for Pari to be sold to the couple.|$|E

Total prevalence was 7. 5 x 10 (- 5) inhabitants (95 % confidence limits 4. 8 - 11. 1). There were 7 patients with Friedreich's disease, 5 with early onset cerebellar ataxia with retained tendon reflexes, 4 with ataxia-telangiectasia, 9 with hereditary spastic <b>paraplegias</b> (2 autosomal dominant and 7 autosomal recessive cases).

5|$|At {{each level}} of the spinal column, spinal nerves branch off from {{either side of the}} spinal cord and exit between a pair of vertebrae, to {{innervate}} a specific part of the body. The area of skin innervated by a specific spinal nerve is called a dermatome, and the group of muscles innervated by a single spinal nerve is called a myotome. The part of the spinal cord that was damaged corresponds to the spinal nerves at that level and below. Injuries can be cervical 1–8 (C1–C8), thoracic 1–12 (T1–T12), lumbar 1–5 (L1–L5), or sacral (S1–S5). A person's level of injury is defined as the lowest level of full sensation and function. <b>Paraplegia</b> occurs when the legs are affected by the spinal cord damage (in thoracic, lumbar, or sacral injuries), and tetraplegia occurs when all four limbs are affected (cervical damage).|$|E
5|$|Schizophrenia is a {{major cause}} of disability, with active {{psychosis}} ranked as the third-most-disabling condition after quadriplegia and dementia and ahead of <b>paraplegia</b> and blindness. Approximately three-fourths of people with schizophrenia have ongoing disability with relapses and 16.7million people globally are deemed to have moderate or severe disability from the condition. Some people do recover completely and others function well in society. Most people with schizophrenia live independently with community support. About 85% are unemployed. Some evidence suggests that paranoid schizophrenia may have a better prospect than other types of schizophrenia for independent living and occupational functioning. In people with a first episode of psychosis a good long-term outcome occurs in 42%, an intermediate outcome in 35% and a poor outcome in 27%. Outcomes for schizophrenia appear better in the developing than the developed world. These conclusions, however, have been questioned.|$|E
5|$|The first {{symptoms}} of Guillain–Barré syndrome are numbness, tingling, and pain, {{alone or in}} combination. This is followed by weakness of the legs and arms that affects both sides equally and worsens over time. The weakness can take half a day to over two weeks to reach maximum severity, and then becomes steady. In one in five people, the weakness continues to progress {{for as long as}} four weeks. The muscles of the neck may also be affected, and about half experience involvement of the cranial nerves which supply the head and face; this may lead to weakness of the muscles of the face, swallowing difficulties and sometimes weakness of the eye muscles. In 8%, the weakness affects only the legs (<b>paraplegia</b> or paraparesis). Involvement of the muscles that control the bladder and anus is unusual. In total, about a third of people with Guillain–Barré syndrome continue to be able to walk. Once the weakness has stopped progressing, it persists at a stable level ("plateau phase") before improvement occurs. The plateau phase can take between two days and six months, but the most common duration is a week. Pain-related symptoms affect more than half, and include back pain, painful tingling, muscle pain and pain {{in the head and neck}} relating to irritation of the lining of the brain.|$|E

40|$|Hereditary spastic <b>paraplegias</b> (HSPs) are {{neurodegenerative}} {{motor neuron}} diseases characterized by progressive age-dependent loss of corticospinal motor tract function. Although the genetic basis is partly understood, {{only a fraction of}} cases can receive a genetic diagnosis, and a global view of HSP is lacking. By using whole-exome sequencing in combination with network analysis, we identified 18 previously unknown putative HSP genes and validated nearly all of these genes functionally or genetically. The pathways highlighted by these mutations link HSP to cellular transport, nucleotide metabolism, and synapse and axon development. Network analysis revealed a host of further candidate genes, of which three were mutated in our cohort. Our analysis links HSP to other neurodegenerative disorders and can facilitate gene discovery and mechanistic understanding of disease.

25|$|Less common {{symptoms}} {{that may be}} seen in the setting of aortic dissection include congestive heart failure (7%), fainting (9%), stroke (6%), ischemic peripheral neuropathy, <b>paraplegia,</b> and cardiac arrest.

25|$|During the war, some {{prisoners were}} sent to neutral Switzerland on grounds of ill health. Internment {{conditions}} were very strict in Switzerland but softened with time. Only the following illnesses could lead to departure from Germany: diseases of the circulatory system, serious nervous problems, tumours and severe skin diseases, blindness (total or partial), serious face injuries, tuberculosis, one or more missing limbs, paralysis, brain disorders like <b>paraplegia</b> or haemiplegia and serious mental illnesses. From 1917, the criteria were extended to prisoners older than 48 or who had spent over eighteen months in captivity. The Red Cross helped initiate these internments, which it proposed {{at the end of}} 1914 and were implemented starting in February 1915. Approval for departure in no way meant permanent freedom but instead transfer to Konstanz, where a medical commission verifying the prisoners’ state was located.|$|E

The SPG 4 gene codes for spastin, a critical neuronal protein that maintains organelle axonal transport by severing and rearranging the microtubule network [3, 4].

25|$|Sit-skis are {{designed}} for wheelchair users or other skiers with a form of <b>paraplegia.</b> The first sit-ski was built in 1967 by Josef Shrall from the Bavaria region of Germany. Early sit-skis used in para-alpine skiing had two wide skis, brakes, and were custom built to fit the specific skier. The weight of the ski prevented skiers from skiing moguls or steep slopes. Sit-ski development continued into the 1980s, with a more modern version demonstrated in Engelberg, Switzerland in 1987 at a workshop hosted by the Swiss Association of Paraplegics. As the technology advanced, a chair was developed that could {{be attached to the}} skis which were used by able-bodied skiers. They are now made from fibreglass and polyester, and the weight has been dramatically reduced, allowing skiers to ski on steeper slopes and compete in the moguls. Current sit-skis include seat-belts. As skis for able-bodied skiers have evolved to specialise for the event, the skis that sit-skiers use have also changed.|$|E
