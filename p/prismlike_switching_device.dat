30|$|Future {{work should}} also {{consider}} {{details of the}} <b>switch</b> <b>device.</b> Different patients are able to use different muscles to control a <b>switch</b> <b>device.</b> A person who uses eye blinks (Bauby, 1997), a sip-puff headset, or manipulates EEG signals (Serby, Yom-Tov & Inbar, 2005) may produce very different error probabilities than what is reported here and thus would require different keyboard designs. Future work should also explore easier methods of estimating and modeling a user’s ability to use the <b>switch</b> <b>device.</b> Koester & Simpson (2014) simply measured how well users could trigger single, double, and triple clicks of the <b>switch</b> <b>device.</b> Such an approach would be much faster than the empirical approach used here. Likewise, Simpson, Koester and LoPresti (2007) proposed that an appropriate cursor duration is one that generates a ratio of the user’s reaction time and the cursor duration equal to 0.65. If true in general, then it should be easy to model error probabilities. Regardless of the empirical method, once the error probabilities for a user’s ability with a <b>switch</b> <b>device</b> are identified and modeled, the optimization algorithm described here can be readily applied.|$|R
40|$|AbstractIn this paper, a novel {{cascaded}} transformer multilevel inverter is proposed. The {{number of}} the <b>switching</b> <b>devices</b> is reduced in the proposed topology. This topology comprises of a DC source, several single phase low-frequency transformers, two main power switches and some bidirectional <b>switching</b> <b>devices.</b> In this topology, only one bidirectional switch is employed for each transformer. However, in conventional cascaded transformer multilevel inverter, four <b>switching</b> <b>devices</b> are required for each transformer. Therefore, more output voltage levels can be obtained using fewer switching components. Reduction {{in the number of}} <b>switching</b> <b>devices</b> which also means {{reduction in the number of}} gate drivers results in smaller size and low implementation cost. Switching power losses are also reduced in this topology. Selective harmonic elimination (SHE) technique is applied to the proposed inverter to obtain a high quality output voltage.
