5|$|Creatures are {{attracted}} via Portals. Which ones come {{depend on the}} dungeon's composition. Each has its own abilities (such as spells they can cast), expertise, and job preferences. Creatures include Bile Demons, Warlocks, and Salamanders. Like the first game, creatures can be slapped with the hand to make them work harder, {{at the cost of}} their health. Certain creatures, such as Vampires and Skeletons cannot be attracted via Portals. They are obtained by their corpse decomposing in a Graveyard, and dying in captivity respectively. Certain sacrifices in the Temple, a room where creatures pray, also yield the acquisition of certain creatures. Creatures frequently enter combat (each follow one of four combat strategies) against creatures belonging to enemy keepers, or heroic forces defending the realm. Heroes enter the level via Hero Gates. The heroics forces are composed of different units to keepers: heroes include Wizards, Giants, and Guards. Most creatures have a heroic counterpart: for example, the Wizard is the counterpart of the Warlock. Heroes and rival keepers' creatures can be converted to the player's cause in the torture chamber after being captured and imprisoned. Creatures dislike their heroic counterparts, and their company may make them angry, which can lead to rebellions. Rebelling creatures either leave the dungeon, or defect to another keeper or the heroes, and may take other creatures too. Other things that can annoy creatures and cause rebellions include lack of food, not getting paid (creatures require <b>payment</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> regular basis), and being slapped.|$|E
5|$|During a lunchtime tryst in Phoenix, Arizona, a {{real estate}} {{secretary}} named Marion Crane discusses with her boyfriend, Sam Loomis, how they cannot afford to get married because of Sam's debts. After lunch, Marion returns to work, where a client drops off a $40,000 cash <b>payment</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> property. Her boss asks her to deposit {{the money in the}} bank, and she asks if she can take {{the rest of the afternoon}} off. Returning home, she begins to pack, deciding to steal the money and give it to Sam in Fairvale, California. She is seen by her boss on her way out of town, which makes her nervous. During the trip, she pulls over on the side of the road and falls asleep, only to be awakened by a state patrol officer. Suspicious about her nervous behavior, he notes her license plate number and follows her at a close distance. Hoping to shake his pursuit, Marion stops at an automobile dealership and trades in her Ford Mainline, with its Arizona license plates, for a Ford Custom 300 that has California tags.|$|E

Amandala is insisting that the move is an attempt to destabilize KREM in an election year and that the major political parties may be complicit in this attack.|$|E

25|$|The {{customer}} {{visits the}} financial institution's secure website, {{and enters the}} online banking facility using the customer number and credentials previously set up. The types of financial transactions which a customer may transact through online banking {{are determined by the}} financial institution, but usually includes obtaining account balances, a list of the recent transactions, electronic bill payments and funds transfers between a customer's or another's accounts. Most banks also enable a customer to download copies of bank statements, which can be printed at the customer's premises (some banks charge a fee for mailing hard copies of bank statements). Some banks also enable customers to download transactions directly into the customer's accounting software. The facility may also enable the customer to order a cheque book, statements, report loss of credit cards, stop <b>payment</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> cheque, advise change of address and other routine actions.|$|E

25|$|Alvin Smith {{was born}} in 1798, the first {{surviving}} child of Joseph Smith Sr. and Lucy Mack Smith. During his youth, Smith worked as a carpenter’s helper to assist the Smith family in saving up sufficient funds to make a down <b>payment</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> farm in Manchester Township, south of Palmyra, New York. Smith also assisted his father in clearing timber, planting wheat and tapping maple trees {{for the purpose of}} making maple sugar. A neighbor, Orlando Saunders, stated that the members of the Smith family “have all worked for me many a day; they were very good people. Young Joe (as we called him then) has worked for me, and he was a good worker; they all were.” In the early 1820s, Smith was involved with his father and brothers in a number of treasure digging excavations in the Palmyra–Manchester area.|$|E
500|$|By 1762, Johnson {{had gained}} a {{reputation}} for being a slow worker. Contemporary poet Charles Churchill teased Johnson for the delay in producing his long-promised edition of Shakespeare: [...] "He for subscribers baits his hook / and takes your cash, but where's the book?" [...] The comments soon stung Johnson into renewed work. It was only in 20 July 1762, when he received the first <b>payment</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> government pension of 300 pounds a year, that he no longer had to worry about money and was finally able to dedicate most of his time to finishing the work.|$|E
500|$|Newton met Holmes {{early in}} October 1975 when, the former claimed, {{he was given}} a down <b>payment</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> fee of £10,000. Holmes later denied any such transaction, admitting only an {{agreement}} that Newton would carry out a frightening operation. On 12 October Newton, calling himself [...] "Peter Keene", drove to Barnstaple in a yellow Mazda car where he approached Scott, claiming to have been hired to protect Scott from a supposed Canadian hit man. This seemed plausible to Scott, who had been beaten up a few weeks earlier, and he agreed to meet [...] "Keene" [...] at a later date. However, he was sufficiently cautious to ask a friend to make a note of the stranger's car registration number.|$|E

500|$|The {{character}} of Tim Riggins has developed over time from an unfocused and moody alcoholic {{to a young}} man of character and dependability. Sometimes that dependability is reflected in his uncanny ability to make the wrong choices for the right reasons, which usually involve his brother. Even though he has proven his ability to help others correct their misguided choices, unfortunately there is no one who does this for Tim. In this season, his irresponsible, headstrong, but lovable brother again entices Tim into another wrong choice by convincing Tim that {{the only way they can}} make any money is by transforming their newly opened garage into a chop shop. Just as they finally end this side business and Tim has enough for the down <b>payment</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> large amount of land he's been dreaming about, the police show up to arrest him at the garage. The police officers recognize Tim as [...] "number 33" [...] giving Tim no chance to deny that it's his chop shop. True to his character, he makes the decision to take the rap and allows his brother to be with his new wife and child. The season ends as Tim walks toward the jail.|$|E

2500|$|By late 1967, Thompson and {{his family}} moved back to Colorado and rented a house in Woody Creek, a small {{mountain}} hamlet outside Aspen. In early 1969, Thompson finally received a $15,000 royalty check for the paperback sales of Hell's Angels and used two-thirds of the money for a down <b>payment</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> modest home and property where he would live {{for the rest of}} his life.

2500|$|The term [...] "fixed" [...] in [...] "fixed income" [...] {{refers to}} both the {{schedule}} of obligatory payments and the amount. [...] "Fixed income securities" [...] can be distinguished from inflation-indexed bonds, variable-interest rate notes, and the like. If an issuer misses a <b>payment</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> fixed income security, the issuer is in default, and depending on the relevant law {{and the structure of}} the security, the payees may be able to force the issuer into bankruptcy. In contrast, if a company misses a quarterly dividend to stock (non-fixed-income) shareholders, there is no violation of any payment covenant, and no default.|$|E
2500|$|Granger's father {{found work}} as a clerk in the North Hollywood branch of the California Department of Unemployment, and his salary allowed him to put a small down <b>payment</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> house in Studio City, where their {{neighbor}} was actor/dancer Donald O'Connor. At his office, Granger's father became acquainted with unemployment benefits recipient Harry Langdon, who advised him to take his son to a small local theatre where open auditions for The Wookie, a British play about Londoners struggling to survive during World War II, were being held. Granger's use of a Cockney accent impressed the director, and he was cast in multiple roles. The opening night audience included talent agent Phil Gersh and Samuel Goldwyn casting director Bob McIntyre, and the following morning Gersh contacted Granger's parents {{and asked them to}} bring him to his office that afternoon to discuss the role of Damian, a teenaged Russian boy in the film The North Star.|$|E

40|$|In this paper, an Adjustable Rate Mortgage (ARM) and a Fixed Rate Mortgage (FRM) are formalized {{and studied}} {{in a simple}} continuous-time setting under the {{assumption}} of a simple one-factor Afﬁne Term Structure (ATS). Through an application of existing results from ATS theory, it is shown that when the short rate reaches a certain pre-determined boundary, the constant <b>payment</b> stream <b>on</b> <b>a</b> new FRM equals the <b>payments</b> <b>on</b> <b>an</b> existing ARM. Hereby, this paper provides a theoretical build-in cap on the formalized ARM. The ﬁnite boundary for the short-rate suggests that certain caps on ARMs should (in theory) be offered free of charge...|$|R
50|$|Graduated {{payments}} are repayment terms involving gradual {{increases in the}} <b>payments</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> closed-end obligation.

2500|$|When Lucy Stone {{married into}} the Blackwell family, she became an eager {{investor}} too but kept her purchases and accounts separate from her husband's. In 1857 they took equal ownership {{in a house}} in Orange, New Jersey, for which they traded western lands. They later sold the house to make a down <b>payment</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> farm in Montclair, New Jersey, and traded more western land to purchase a neighboring tract. After their return from Illinois in September 1859, Blackwell opened a real estate business, through which, in addition to selling and trading for clients, he traded western land for eastern properties. In this way both he and Stone became owners of a string of rental properties. While they were [...] "land rich," [...] they were [...] "cash poor," [...] so to raise funds for tax and interest payments, Blackwell briefly sold kitchen stoves manufactured by fellow abolitionist Cornelius Bramhill and then, from 1862 to 1864, was bookkeeper for the sugar refining business of one of his father's former employees.|$|E
2500|$|The Hells Angels became {{involved}} in a dispute between a Dutch drug trafficker and a Liverpool crime family in late 1992. The Liverpudlian gang had made a significant down <b>payment</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> large shipment of cannabis from Amsterdam which was seized by British customs officials during a routine check of a Dutch-registered ship docking at Manchester. Under {{the terms of the}} agreement, the drugs were no longer the responsibility of the Dutchman once they had left Dutch waters but the Liverpool family refused to pay the £140,000 owed and so the trafficker, a former Hells Angel, contracted the club to collect the debt owed to him. Three Hells Angels, Michael [...] "Long Mick" [...] Rowledge (vice-president of the Hells Angels' Wolverhampton chapter), Andrew Trevis (also from Wolverhampton) and Stephen Pollock (from the Windsor chapter) travelled to Aintree on October 7, 1992 and agreed to meet the Liverpudlians outside a supermarket in the Old Roan area. While the Hells Angels waited in their car, a gunman approached and shot Rowledge four times in the chest, killing him, before escaping in a waiting vehicle. In 1993, Delroy Davies was acquitted after a trial at Liverpool Crown Court and Thomas Dures was jailed for 13 years for conspiracy to murder.|$|E
2500|$|In 1909 Bartlett Richards bought 20,000 head {{of cattle}} from Mexico and in November of that year a very strong snow storm {{incapacitated}} the area. [...] "The Spade lost 10,000 of those cattle," [...] Lawrence said, [...] "and there was a pile of hides in Ellsworth {{as high as the}} depot." [...] Lawrence and his brother Ona skinned cattle for 50 cents a head, 25 cents per calf and everyday the intense cold brought more losses to the Spade. When Lawrence was old enough to file on a homestead, he described his land on the Alkali Lake Meadow as a quarter-mile deep and two miles wide, but he met requirements and received patent on the string of 40's in 1918. In 1925 Brass and Meyers arranged with Lawrence to buy the hay and have him care for and feed their cattle which were branded with Sandhills Land and Cattle Company's Sugar Bowl brand. Early on, Brass assisted Bixby with a $2,000.00 ($24,031.37 current) down <b>payment</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> loan to buy 2,000 acres (810 ha) of the Spade land. [...] Beginning in 1925, Bixby slowly began to obtain sections of the old Spade Ranch range by hard work and perseverance, aided by bankers willing to take a chance. In 1926, Brass and Meyers suggested Bixby move to the ranch headquarters in the Spade home valley. The same year Lawrence was asked by the Union Pacific assistant treasurer C.T. Cullen for permission to bring a hunting party to the Spade and {{for a number of years}} the men came in a private railroad car, bringing their own cook and paid handsomely for hunting rights on Bixby land and lakes. Mr. Cullen dropped by the day Lawrence was checking applications for the district school, where he was a board member. [...] "Hire this one with the Irish eyes," [...] Mr. Cullen suggested and in time Miss Eleanor Riordan of York, Nebraska began teaching Cherry County District #168. Lawrence conscientiously kept in touch with the young teacher and the day after her term ended they were married in Alliance, Nebraska on May 26, 1927.|$|E
