5000|$|Both quill and {{threadless}} stems come in {{a variety}} of bicycle handlebar clamp diameters. The ISO standard for the clamping area of a handlebar is 25.4 mm (1 inch), which is used on mountain bikes and many Japanese-made road handlebars. However, the Italian unofficial standard is 26.0 mm, which is the most common clamp size for road bars. There are also intermediate sizes such as 25.8 mm to try to achieve compatibility with either an ISO or Italian stem, and the old Cinelli-specific size of 26.4 mm. In practice, many modern stems with removable faceplates allow for slight differences in handlebar clamp diameter, but the older type of stem with a single <b>pinch</b> <b>bolt</b> must be accurately matched. In the days of quill stems, a road stem was clearly identifiable from its [...] "7" [...] shape, but nowadays it can be hard to tell the difference between a [...] "road" [...] (26.0 mm) and [...] "MTB" [...] (25.4 mm) stem. Manufacturers frequently omit the clamp size from advertising or packaging.|$|E
5000|$|Care {{is needed}} when {{choosing}} a handlebar to match a stem, or vice versa, as there are several standards. The ISO standard for the stem clamping area of a handlebar is 25.4 mm, which is used on mountain bikes and many Japanese-made road handlebars. However, the Italian unofficial standard is 26.0 mm, {{which is the most}} common clamp size for road bars. There are also intermediate sizes such as 25.8 mm to try to achieve compatibility with either an ISO or Italian stem, and the old Cinelli-specific size of 26.4 mm. In practice, many modern stems with removable faceplates are quite accommodating of slight differences in handlebar clamp size, but the older type of stem with a single <b>pinch</b> <b>bolt</b> must be accurately matched. In the days of quill stems, a road stem was clearly identifiable from its [...] "7" [...] shape, but nowadays {{it can be hard to}} tell the difference between a [...] "road" [...] (26.0 mm) and [...] "MTB" [...] (25.4 mm) stem.

5000|$|To attach {{it to the}} bicycle's main frame, the {{seatpost}} {{is inserted}} into the seat tube, which must be of a very slightly larger diameter (or a cylindrical shim can be used). The seatpost is {{held in place by}} squeezing the top of the seat tube with a tightening ring (temporarily reducing its diameter; a vertical slit cut into the tube allows this to happen without crumpling) until the tube firmly hugs the post where it leaves the frame. A hole for a <b>pinch</b> <b>bolt</b> (also known as a [...] "binder bolt") may be built into the frame for this purpose, or a [...] "seat post clamp" [...] may be purchased separately (but must be sized to closely fit the diameter of the seat tube). Whether integrated or separate, the seat post bolt can have a simple nut, can be an Allen bolt, or can include a quick-release mechanism, with a handle that releases the clamp without tools. [...] A quick-release allows easy height adjustment of the seat, though increases the risk of seat theft unless it is also used to detach the seat when parking.|$|E
5000|$|... #Caption: An aero {{seatpost}} in an aero {{seat tube}} held with two <b>pinch</b> <b>bolts</b> on an Orbea Ordu.|$|R
50|$|They may be held {{in place}} by a {{built-in}} wedge, set screws threaded into the bottom bracket shell, or <b>pinch</b> <b>bolts</b> that tighten a split bottom bracket shell. As a standard sized bottom bracket threads into the eccentric, an oversized bottom bracket shell is required to accommodate the eccentric.|$|R
50|$|As {{alternatives}} to the integrated seatpost mentioned above, some seatposts merely have an aerodynamic shape that either matches {{the shape of the}} aero seat tube or is only not round above a certain point. In the case of aero seat tubes, {{there are a variety of}} clamping mechanisms for such seatposts that include <b>pinch</b> <b>bolts</b> and wedges.|$|R
50|$|Stems tighten {{around and}} hold the {{handlebar}} either by <b>pinch</b> <b>bolts,</b> which require 'feeding' the handlebar through the stem after removing controls, accessories and bar covering; or via detachable faceplates, also called pillow blocks, especially on BMX bicycles, which allow a handlebar with controls, accessories or bar covering to be removed intact. Stems with faceplates or pillow blocks are known as pop-top stems.|$|R
25|$|Even newer designs {{have the}} bottom bracket spindle, usually hollow and larger {{diameter}} than {{is possible for}} bottom brackets with bearings held inside the bottom bracket shell of a bike frame, for reduced weight and increased stiffness, permanently attached to the right crank (Shimano and others) or the left crank (Race Face). The left crank slides onto a spline and is tightened {{with one or more}} <b>pinch</b> <b>bolts</b> (Shimano) or is pressed onto a spline by a bolt on the bottom bracket spindle (Race Face).|$|R
5000|$|... "Hollowtech II" [...] - This was {{the next}} {{iteration}} after Hollowtech cranks. For this system the bottom bracket axle was fused to the drive side crank and the non drive side crank fitted on a spline on the axle using <b>pinch</b> <b>bolts.</b> The bottom bracket bearings sat outside the BB shell in the frame, allowing the BB axle to be a larger diameter, making it stiffer and lighter. The bearing reliability of this system remains quite variable compared to previous Shimano cartridge BB's as Hollowtech II bearing alignment is {{at the mercy of}} the alignment of the BB shell threads and the facing of the BB shell rather than factory set by Shimano in the case of the cartridge BB's. Race face make a system with compatible bearings which they call X-Type.|$|R
5000|$|Thru axle - a {{removable}} axle with a threaded end that is inserted {{through a hole}} in one fork leg, through the hub, and then screwed into the other fork leg. Some axles have integrated cam levers that compress axle elements against the fork leg to lock it in place, while others rely on <b>pinch</b> <b>bolts</b> on the fork leg to secure it. Diameters for front thru axles include 20 mm, 15 mm (most common), and 9 mm. Rear axles typically have diameters of 10 or 12 mm. Most thru axles are found on mountain bikes, although some cyclocross and road bikes are using them. Thru axles repeatable locate the wheel in the fork or frame, which is important to prevent misalignment of brake rotors when using disc brakes. Unlike other axle systems (except Lefty), the thru axle is specific to the fork or frame, not the hub. Hubs/wheels do not include axles, and the axle is generally supplied with the fork or frame.|$|R
50|$|The {{arrival of}} the real Strabo was much more {{effective}} at disrupting the wedding, but Strabo soon got distracting chasing after the armoured men-at-arms which he considered delicacies. Misty was still faced with the armed Laphroig, Pinch who had a crossbow and Crabbit the magician. A stunning explosion occurred when Laphroig's thrown dagger, <b>Pinch's</b> crossbow <b>bolt,</b> and magic from Crabbit and Misty came together.|$|R
