5|$|There {{are many}} {{movements}} {{among the general}} self-harm community to make self-harm itself and treatment better known to mental health professionals, {{as well as the}} general public. For example, March 1 is designated as Self-injury Awareness Day (SIAD) around the world. On this day, some <b>people</b> <b>choose</b> to be more open about their own self-harm, and awareness organizations make special efforts to raise awareness about self-harm. Some people wear an orange awareness ribbon or wristband to encourage awareness of self-harm.|$|E
5|$|Campervans, caravans and trailer tents are {{not allowed}} into the main festival site. However, the {{purchase}} of a campervan ticket in addition to the main ticket allows access to fields just outside the boundary fence; and the cost includes access for the campervan or towing vehicle and the caravan; the car, or other vehicle used to tow the caravan, may be parked alongside it but sleeping is only authorised in the campervan/caravan and connected awning, not in the accompanying vehicle. One additional tent may accompany the caravan/campervan if space within the plot allows. Some <b>people</b> <b>choose</b> to bring or hire a motorhome, though drivers of larger vehicles or motorhomes may have to purchase a second campervan ticket if they cannot fit within the defined plot. The 2009 festival saw changes to the campervan fields; commercial vehicles were no longer classed as 'campervans', all campervans had to have a fitted sleeping area and either washing or cooking facilities, and caravans and trailer tents were allowed back at the festival. Prior to this only campervans were allowed on site, caravans and trailers being banned in the early 1990s after a number were stuck in the mud and abandoned.|$|E

25|$|Home {{education}} or homeschooling, in Australia {{is much the}} same as elsewhere. Some reasons as to why <b>people</b> <b>choose</b> to homeschool is because it's a lifestyle choice, some <b>people</b> <b>choose</b> to home educate so that they can travel and spend quality time with their kids. Some children learn differently to the general crowd and can get bored or can struggle at school, where the teachers are unable to cater for the individuality of each child.|$|E

25|$|Some {{transsexual}} {{people live}} heterosexual lifestyles (see heteronormative), while some identify as gay, lesbian, or bisexual. Many transsexual <b>people</b> <b>choose</b> {{the language of}} how they refer to their sexual orientation based on their gender identity, not their birth assigned sex, though some transsexual people still find identification with a physical-sex-based community: many trans men, for instance, are involved with lesbian communities.|$|E
25|$|The {{main reason}} <b>people</b> <b>choose</b> not to {{contribute}} to online communities surprisingly {{does not have to}} do with societal laziness, but in fact the potential contributors belief that their entries will not be taken seriously or given the credit that they deserve. When people assess the risks involved in contributing to online communities, they generally avoid participation because of the uncertainty of who the other contributors and readers are and the fear of their work being undervalued.|$|E

25|$|Tokyo – Fukuoka (1,069km): The Shinkansen {{takes about}} five hours on the fastest Nozomi, and {{discount}} carriers have made air travel far cheaper, so most <b>people</b> <b>choose</b> air. Additionally, unlike many cities, {{there is very little}} convenience advantage for the location of the Shinkansen stations of the two cities as Fukuoka Airport is located near the central Tenjin district, and Fukuoka City Subway Line 1 connects the Airport and Tenjin via Hakata Station and Haneda Airport is similarly conveniently located.|$|E
25|$|An {{example of}} this is the bouba/kiki effect. In an {{experiment}} first designed by Wolfgang Köhler, people are asked to choose which of two shapes is named bouba and which kiki. 95% to 98% of <b>people</b> <b>choose</b> kiki for the angular shape and bouba for the rounded one. Individuals on the island of Tenerife showed a similar preference between shapes called takete and maluma. Even 2.5-year-old children (too young to read) show this effect. Recent research indicated that in the background of this effect may operate a form of ideasthesia.|$|E
25|$|Books {{requiring}} restoration or conservation treatment run {{the gamut}} from the very earliest of texts to books with modern bindings that have undergone heavy usage. For each book, a course of treatment must be chosen that takes into account the book's value, whether it comes from the binding, the text, the provenance, or some combination of the three. Many <b>people</b> <b>choose</b> to rebind books, from amateurs who restore old paperbacks on internet instructions to many professional book and paper conservators and restorationists, who often in the United States are members of the American Institute for Conservation of Historic and Artistic Works (AIC).|$|E

25|$|Many <b>people</b> <b>choose</b> {{to retire}} {{when they are}} {{eligible}} for private or public pension benefits, although some are forced to retire when physical conditions no longer allow the person to work any longer (by illness or accident) or {{as a result of}} legislation concerning their position. In most countries, the idea of retirement is of recent origin, being introduced during the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Previously, low life expectancy and the absence of pension arrangements meant that most workers continued to work until death. Germany was the first country to introduce retirement, in 1889.|$|E
25|$|Riker and Ordeshook {{developed}} the modern understanding of D. They listed five major forms of gratification that people receive for voting: {{complying with the}} social obligation to vote; affirming one's allegiance to the political system; affirming a partisan preference (also known as expressive voting, or voting for a candidate to express support, not to achieve any outcome); affirming one's importance to the political system; and, for those who find politics interesting and entertaining, researching and making a decision. Other political scientists have since added other motivators and questioned some of Riker and Ordeshook's assumptions. All of these concepts are inherently imprecise, {{making it difficult to}} discover exactly why <b>people</b> <b>choose</b> to vote.|$|E
25|$|<b>People</b> <b>choose</b> to wear {{contact lenses}} for many reasons. Aesthetics and {{cosmetics}} {{are the main}} motivating factors {{for people who want}} to avoid wearing glasses or to change the appearance of their eyes. Others wear contact lenses for functional or optical reasons. When compared with spectacles, contact lenses typically provide better peripheral vision, and do not collect moisture (from rain, snow, condensation etc.) or perspiration. This can make them preferable for sports and other outdoor activities. Contact lens wearers can also wear sunglasses, goggles, or other eyewear of their choice without having to fit them with prescription lenses or worry about compatibility with glasses. Additionally, there are conditions such as keratoconus and aniseikonia that are typically corrected better with contact lenses than with glasses.|$|E

25|$|When <b>people</b> <b>choose</b> to {{do things}} about which they are {{ambivalent}} and which they would have difficulty justifying, they experience a state of cognitive dissonance, {{which can lead to}} rationalization, denial, or even self-deception. For example, a 2011 experiment found that, when the harm that their meat-eating causes animals is explicitly brought to people's attention, they tend to rate those animals as possessing fewer mental capacities compared to when the harm is not brought to their attention. This is especially evident when people expect to eat meat in the near future. Such denial makes it less uncomfortable for people to eat animals. The data suggest that people who consume meat {{go to great lengths to}} try to resolve these moral inconsistencies between their beliefs and behaviour by adjusting their beliefs about what animals are capable of feeling. Ethical vegetarians argue that it is behaviour rather than supporting beliefs that should be adjusted.|$|E
25|$|It {{has been}} found that Americans have six {{lifestyle}} choices as they age: continuing to work full-time, continuing to work part-time, retiring from work and becoming engaged in a variety of leisure activities, retiring from work and becoming involved in a variety of recreational and leisure activities, retiring from work and later returning to work part-time, and retiring from work and later returning to work full-time. An important note to make from these lifestyle definitions are that four of the six involve working. America is facing an important demographic change in that the Baby Boomer generation is now reaching retirement age. This poses two challenges: whether there will be a sufficient number of skilled workers in the work force, and whether the current pension programs will be sufficient to support the growing number of retired people. The reasons that some <b>people</b> <b>choose</b> to never retire, or to return to work after retiring include not only the difficulty of planning for retirement but also wages and fringe benefits, expenditure of physical and mental energy, production of goods and services, social interaction, and social status may interact to influence an individual’s work force participation decision.|$|E
25|$|Many tattoos {{serve as}} rites of passage, marks of status and rank, symbols of {{religious}} and spiritual devotion, decorations for bravery, sexual lures and marks of fertility, pledges of love, amulets and talismans, protection, and as punishment, like the marks of outcasts, slaves and convicts. The symbolism and impact of tattoos varies in different places and cultures. Tattoos may show how a person feels about a relative (commonly mother/father or daughter/son) or about an unrelated person. Today, <b>people</b> <b>choose</b> to be tattooed for artistic, cosmetic, sentimental/memorial, religious, and magical reasons, and to symbolize their belonging to or identification with particular groups, including criminal gangs (see criminal tattoos) or a particular ethnic group or law-abiding subculture. Some Māori still choose to wear intricate moko on their faces. In Cambodia, Laos, and Thailand, the yantra tattoo is used for protection against evil and to increase luck. Text-based tattoos including quotes, lyrics, personal mottos or scripture are popular in western culture. As an example some Christians might have a Psalm or verse from the Bible tattooed on their body. Popular verses include John 3:16, Philippians 4:13, and Psalms 23.|$|E
