[...] However, the team then changed their decision due to negative feedback from fans who were playing the alpha demo version who demanded bigger breasts. Shimbori said: [...] "That was kind of surprising.

More importantly, he believes, is that aspiring scientists find passion in science and follow their passion with hard work and vigour. The book is divided into 20 chapters in five parts.
