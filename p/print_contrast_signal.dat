40|$|In this contribution, we {{show that}} Au NRs {{functionalized}} with PEG molecules {{can be used as}} absorption nanoprobes for near-infrared imaging in live animals. We have found that the <b>contrast</b> <b>signal</b> of the in vivo image is dependent upon the transmission ability of the NIR light interacting with the different aspect ratios of Au NRs. Our study was focused on absorption in vivo imaging at 700 nm, which is within the transmission window of the skin. NIR absorption in vivo imaging was carried out by subcutaneous injection of mice with PEGylated Au NRs that have a LSPR around 700 nm. The formulation showed strong <b>contrast</b> <b>signals</b> under the tissues upon irradiation with NIR light. More importantly, our theoretical calculation suggested that the high <b>contrast</b> <b>signals</b> from the PEGylated Au NRs were generated via the NIR light absorption of the Au NRs within the tissue.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{determine}} microbubble responses to different pulse sequence schemes that exist on low mechanical index (MI) real-time perfusion imaging systems using either intravenous albumin-coated (Optison) or lipid-encapsulated (Definity) microbubbles. A tissue-mimicking phantom was created that permitted insonation of microbubbles at 3 cm (near field) and 9 cm (far field) from the diagnostic transducer face. Differences in effluent microbubble concentration were measured after they passed through vessels being insonified with pulse sequence schemes that transmitted alternating polarity (pulse inversion Doppler), alternating amplitude (power modulation), or both (contrast pulse sequencing) at a similar MI, frame rate, and transmit frequency. Normalized <b>contrast</b> <b>signal</b> intensity within a recirculating chamber was also measured in the near and far field. Pulse inversion Doppler produced less initial normalized <b>contrast</b> <b>signal</b> intensity and greater destruction rates than amplitude varying pulse sequence schemes like power modulation or contrast pulse sequencing at both the 0. 1 - and 0. 2 -MI settings.

40|$|Objectives. Transthoracic {{echocardiography}} (TTE) {{is fundamental}} in managing patients supported with ventricular assist devices (VAD). However imaging {{can be difficult}} in these patients. Contrast improves image quality but they are hydrodynamically fragile agents. The aim was to assess contrast concentration following passage through a VAD utilising a mock circulation loop (MCL). Methods. Heartware continuous flow (CF) VAD was incorporated into a MCL. Definity® contrast was infused into the MCL with imaging before and after CF-VAD. 5 [*]mm 2 regions of interest were used to obtain signal intensity (decibels), as a surrogate of contrast concentration. Results. Four pump speeds revealed significant reduction in <b>contrast</b> <b>signal</b> intensity after CF-VAD compared to before CF-VAD (all p< 0. 0001). Combined pre- and postpump data at all speeds showed a 22. 2 % absolute reduction in <b>contrast</b> <b>signal</b> intensity across the CF-VAD (14. 8 ± 0. 8 [*]dB prepump versus 11. 6 ± 1. 4 [*]dB postpump; p< 0. 0001). Mean signal intensity reduction at each speed showed an inverse relationship between speed and relative reduction in <b>signal</b> intensity. Conclusion. <b>Contrast</b> microsphere transit through a CF-VAD within a MCL resulted in significant reduction in signal intensity, consistent with destruction within the pump. This was evident at all CF-VAD pump speeds but relative signal drop was inversely proportional to pump speed...|$|R

When oblique rows {{of black}} and white dots drifted {{horizontally}} across a mid-grey surround, the perceived direction of motion was shifted to be almost parallel to the dotted lines and was often nearly orthogonal to the real motion. The reason is that the black/white <b>contrast</b> <b>signals</b> between adjacent dots {{along the length of the}} line are stronger than black/grey or white/grey <b>contrast</b> <b>signals</b> across the line, and the motion is computed as a vector sum of local contrast-weighted motion signals.

40|$|X-ray Phase Contrast (PC) Imaging has the {{potential}} to greatly improve radiography. Conventional radiography is based on the imaginary part of the refractive index, whereas PC imaging is based on the unit decrement of the real part, which can be up to 1000 times larger. This is particularly important in soft tissue imaging (e. g. mammography), where the differences in the imaginary part of the refractive index are small. Combining PC with tomosynthesis (TS) would also allow for the differentiation of overlapping tissues, thus leading to improved detection of breast lesions. Coded Aperture X-ray Phase Contrast Imaging (CAXPCi) is a technique which enables PC imaging with conventional lab sources, and which could thus be translated into a clinical environment. In this work the feasibility of a combined CAXPCi/Tomosynthesis approach is demonstrated, both on simulated and experimental data. The results of the simulations of the phase <b>contrast</b> <b>signal</b> in TS geometry are in good agreement with the experimental data. The simulator can be used in the future to understand and predict the phase <b>contrast</b> <b>signal</b> for other 3 D implementations of phase contrast imaging. The implementation of the new method in the laboratory conditions is presented and four tomosynthesis reconstruction algorithms are proposed and compared: filtered backprojection (FBP), separable paraboidal surrogates (SPS), conjugate gradient (CG) and penalized conjugate gradient (penalized-CG). The analytical reconstruction (FBP) of the phase contrast data results in noisy images. This can be greatly improved by using iterative statistical methods (SPS, CG and penalized CG), at a cost of a decreased image contrast but with an overall benefit in terms of contrast to noise ratio. CAXPCi Tomosynthesis scans of various samples, including a sample containing two superimposed TORMAM phantoms as well as breast biopsy samples, were carried out to evaluate the method’s performance under realistic mammographic conditions. Strong phase <b>contrast</b> (PC) <b>signal</b> was observed in all reconstructions, and the overlapping structures were effectively separated...|$|R
40|$|Through the {{evolution}} of technology both print and process have become more predictable and reliable. As a result, innovations {{in the press and}} plate coating technologies along with imaging software technologies have challenged the way we view print. With lithography being the predominant printing process, printers now have to find ways to differentiate themselves from others especially in the color reproduction arena. For years, traditional halftoning methods have reproduced original continuous tone images with success. Today, however, the once accepted rosette is now being challenged by a new technology that does away with conventional screen rulings and dot patterns. This new technology called Stochastic Screening, offers many benefits and is loudly touted by its champions. Tone reproduction whether it be through conventional screening methods or stochastic screening methods is influenced by all parameters in the printing process. In this study, the effects of inking on dot gain and <b>print</b> <b>contrast</b> were studied. A test form was developed to test the prediction that stochastically screened images will perform equally or better than conventionally screened images under normal and increased inking conditions. Evaluation of the test results shows that conventionally screened images actually performed better than stochastically screened images. Stochastic images actually experienced increased dot gain and loss of <b>print</b> <b>contrast</b> in the 48 % and 70 % tint areas under normal and increased inking conditions. Although stochastic images had less of a performance, the images appeared to have less variation throughout the run. At the height of implementation, it is not likely that stochastic screening will become the standard for industry because there are many unanswered questions that still surround this new technology. It is also obvious that implementation of this new technology is bound to be limited by the challenges of controlling a wide variety of equipment across industry, as well as the need to control the plating and printing processes themselves...|$|R
