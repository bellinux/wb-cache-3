40|$|Ten years ago, I {{published}} {{an article in the}} Marquette Intellectual Property Law Review titled “Trademark Exhaustion in the European Union: Community-Wide or International? The Saga Continues. ” In that article, I described the development <b>of</b> the <b>principle</b> <b>of</b> trademark <b>exhaustion</b> in the European Union (EU) and analyzed the interplay among trademark protection, trademark territoriality, and the treatment of the parallel importation of gray market products—unauthorized genuine goods imported from foreign countries—under Article 7 of the Trademark Directive (Article 7). In this Essay, I continue to explore, ten years after my 2002 article, the development <b>of</b> the <b>principle</b> <b>of</b> trademark <b>exhaustion</b> in the EU. In particular, I analyze the recent jurisprudence of the CJEU on the application of Article 7 and recount the most relevant trends in the recent CJEU’s decisions in this area. Although the focus of this Essay is primarily descriptive, I offer some critical considerations in the light of recent CJEU’s decisions. I thus argue that in its recent line of cases, the CJEU seems increasingly willing to shrink, de facto, the application <b>of</b> the <b>principle</b> <b>of</b> trademark <b>exhaustion</b> not solely to products imported from outside the EEA, but also to intra-EEA trade. Most notably, I highlight that the CJEU seems to have accepted a narrow interpretation of the notion of trademark owners’ “consent” under Article 7 (1) of the Trademark Directive. I also argue that the CJEU seems to have adopted an alarmingly broad interpretation of what can constitute a “legitimate reason” to oppose trademark exhaustion under Article 7 (2), especially to protect famous marks and luxury goods against unauthorized trade by third party importers, still within the EEA. This trend, I conclude, is troubling and may negatively impact the <b>principle</b> <b>of</b> free movement of goods within the EU/EEA. Furthermore, it grants trademark owners (primarily the owners of famous marks) an increasingly absolute right to control the distribution of their marked products in the after-sale market—precisely what the <b>principle</b> <b>of</b> trademark <b>exhaustion</b> was designed to prevent—to the detriment of consumers and market competition...|$|R

Certain problematic aspects were also demonstrated in the decision of US court in case Capitol Records v.

The thesis concludes that the <b>principle</b> <b>of</b> <b>exhaustion</b> of domestic remedies, although hindering some case, does not seem to set an unreasonably high bar of admission, but is rather applied with a degree of flexibility, which ensures protection of human rights...|$|E

40|$|In this chapter, I {{address the}} {{relationship}} between the <b>principle</b> <b>of</b> trademark <b>exhaustion</b> and the free movement of goods in free trade areas. In particular, I analyze the existing approaches to trademark exhaustion and parallel imports in the following free trade areas: the European Union (EU), or rather the European Economic Area (EEA); the North American Free Trade Area (NAFTA); and the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN). The results of this analysis highlight the different approaches that countries that are members of a free trade area may choose regarding national policies on trademark exhaustion—i. e., national, international, or regional trademark exhaustion as I explain below—and how these policies directly impact the free movement of goods within the free trade area. In particular, I note that it is only when all countries that are members of a free trade area consistently adopt a <b>principle</b> <b>of</b> international or regional trademark exhaustion that goods can freely move amongst these countries. Still, as the case of the EU/EEA demonstrates, the approach that countries adopt with respect to trademark exhaustion can also evolve over time and lead to a unified approach only at a second stage, particularly when the members of a free trade area agree to achieve a higher level of economic integration. In these instances, members of free trade areas are more likely to adopt a unified approach on trademark exhaustion that facilitates the free movement of goods within the free trade area. Other contributions in this volume comprehensively address the alternative approaches to intellectual property exhaustion. Building on these contributions, in section II, I elaborate on the <b>principle</b> <b>of</b> trademark <b>exhaustion</b> in the EU/EEA. In this section, I note that market integration has historically been a priority in the EU, thus EU law explicitly imposes a consistent approach on exhaustion to all EU/EEA Member States in order to promote free movement of goods and the internal market. In section III, I analyze the rules on trademark exhaustion in NAFTA. In this section, I note that, unlike in the EU/EEA, NAFTA members never intended to create a NAFTA internal market, thus, each NAFTA member follows its own system of choice on trademark exhaustion. Still, all NAFTA members have adopted the <b>principle</b> <b>of</b> international trademark <b>exhaustion,</b> which in turn permits the free movement of trademarked goods within NAFTA. Last, in section IV, I elaborate on the approach(es) adopted by the countries that are members of ASEAN. In this section, I stress that ASEAN members adopt a <b>principle</b> <b>of</b> non-interference with respect to national exhaustion policies (ASEAN members generally follow the <b>principles</b> <b>of</b> consensus and non-interference, referred to as the “ASEAN way,” as a general principle, not only with respect to intellectual property-related issues). In this section, I also note that, to date, ASEAN members follow different approaches on trademark exhaustion. Notably, several ASEAN members follow international exhaustion, while other members are silent on the issue or adopt the <b>principle</b> <b>of</b> national <b>exhaustion.</b> Differently than the situation in the EU/EEA and NAFTA, however, the approach adopted by ASEAN members ultimately results in preventing an effective free movement of trademarked goods within ASEAN...|$|R

During the past decade, corporations have increasingly turned to copyright law to protect the designs used in their labels, logos, products packaging, and so forth. However, I elaborate in this Essay that this trend is frequently finalized at leveraging the copyright protection on these designs to encompass the entire products to which these designs are affixed, and in turn circumvent the rule of trademark law (international first sale) by blocking the importation of gray market products under the more business-friendly rule of national copyright first sale...|$|E

40|$|This Article {{analyzes}} the <b>principle</b> <b>of</b> 2 ̆ 2 trademark exhaustion 2 ̆ 2 or 2 ̆ 2 first-sale rule 2 ̆ 2 in the European Union (EU), with {{particular attention to}} the language and different interpretations of Article 7 (1) of the First Council Directive 89 104 EEC of December 21, 1988. Traditionally, most jurisdictions define the extent <b>of</b> trademark <b>exhaustion</b> as either 2 ̆ 2 national 2 ̆ 2 or 2 ̆ 2 international 2 ̆ 2 exhaustion, depending on whether the rights granted by a mark are considered exhausted only in the domestic territory or also in foreign jurisdictions. Because of its nature as a regional integration of sovereign countries, the EU has historically favored a compromising approach toward the issue, and has adopted the so called <b>principle</b> <b>of</b> Community-wide <b>exhaustion.</b> According to this principle, trademark rights are exhausted throughout the territory of the whole EU once a product has been put on the market in any Member State. This principle was originally developed by the European Court of Justice (ECJ), and was incorporated into Article 7 (1) of the Trademark Directive in 1988. Yet, the wording of the provision is unclear as to whether Community-wide exhaustion represents a minimum standard that leaves Member States free to apply more generous rules - such as international exhaustion - or whether it applies to all trade within the EU. Unsurprisingly, this uncertainty has created many ambiguities, which have required the intervention of the ECJ in multiple instances. As a result, the ECJ has repeatedly clarified that the <b>principle</b> <b>of</b> Community-wide <b>exhaustion</b> is to be considered not as a minimum, but as the general standard for all trade within the EU. Still, despite these decisions, the pressure for a shift toward a regime <b>of</b> international <b>exhaustion</b> has not diminished, and considerable confusion continues to characterize the issue. Starting from the principle that consumer protection is still the major focus of trademark laws and policy in the EU, this Article explores whether, and under what conditions, a regime <b>of</b> international <b>exhaustion</b> could still be possible in the EU {{in the aftermath of the}} recent ECJ 2 ̆ 7 s decisions...|$|R

This “revolutionary” decision came after almost two decades of conflicting positions, including two previous Supreme Court decisions that had failed to clarify the issue, notably Quality King v. L’anza and Costco v. Omega. Yet, {{a closer look at the}} decision, particularly at the concurring and dissenting opinions in the case, seems to show that Supreme Court’s position may have been a necessary step that the Court had to take in order to redress the ambiguities that continued to linger on the issue, especially in light of the additional uncertainty that the Court itself had injected into the interpretation of Section 109 (a) with its decision in Quality King. Accordingly, more chapters may be awaiting to be written in this American saga on the territorial application <b>of</b> the <b>principle</b> <b>of</b> copyright <b>exhaustion.</b> As the concurring opinion in the case directly suggested, Congress could overrule the Supreme Court and clarify with a legislative amendment that the application <b>of</b> copyright <b>exhaustion</b> in the United States is not international but instead national exhaustion for all products.

40|$|This article {{considers}} the resale of digital copyright content. Other jurisdictions, including the EU and the US have recently considered whether consumers have rights {{to buy and}} sell second hand digital content. In Australian copyright law, there is no clear principle of first sale or exhaustion that positively permits the second hand sale of copyright goods. In the context of physical goods, resale is generally not an infringement in Australia; but without a clear right, the resale of digital goods will be an infringement of Australian copyright law. This article {{considers the}} public policy considerations around establishing a digital secondary market. It first provides a review of recent US and EU cases that reflect upon the legality of secondary digital markets, with reference to the history and development of the first sale doctrine and the <b>principle</b> <b>of</b> <b>exhaustion.</b> This article then reviews the potential impact of secondary markets on consumers’ access to copyright goods. It is proposed that, given the indeterminacy of economic analyses in this context, careful consideration should be given to the social and personal impacts of restrictions on alienation of digital goods, compared to their physical equivalents.

40|$|Copyright law sets up an {{inevitable}} {{tension between the}} intellectual property of creators and the personal property of consumers — in other words, between copyrights and copies. For {{the better part of}} the last century, copyright law successfully mediated this tension through the <b>principle</b> <b>of</b> <b>exhaustion</b> — the notion that once a rights holder transfers a copy of a work to a new owner, its rights against that owner are diminished. Rather than an idiosyncratic carveout or exception, exhaustion is an inherent part of copyright law’s balance between the rights of creators and the rights of the public. Nonetheless, many rights holders and some courts see exhaustion as nothing more than a loophole or market inefficiency that allows consumers to make unauthorized uses of intellectual property rightly controlled by the copyright owner. Two developments threaten to curtail exhaustion and consumer interests. First, content owners have endeavored to eliminate the personal property interests of consumers, redefining the notion of ownership by characterizing their transactions with consumers as licenses. Second, the tangible copy is rapidly disappearing as copyright markets shift from the distribution of physical products to exchanges of networked information. In short, the equilibrium between personal and intellectual property that exhaustion enabled depends on doctrinal assumptions about the copyright marketplace that are quickly becoming outdated. By examining the basic functions of copy ownership, this Article will attempt to construct a notion of consumer property rights in digital media that acknowledges the shift away from tangible artifacts while preserving exhaustion’s central role in the intellectual property system...|$|E
5000|$|In Case E-2/97 Mag Instruments a {{parallel}} importer purchased Maglite flashlights in California, {{where they were}} manufactured, and imported them into Norway without the manufacturer’s and trade mark owner’s consent. According to established Norwegian law, international exhaustion applied to trade marks. The EFTA Court held that under the First Trade Mark Directive 89/104/EEC, the EFTA States were entitled to opt for the international <b>exhaustion</b> <b>of</b> trade mark rights. The Court emphasized that they retained their sovereignty in foreign trade matters. Unlike the EC Treaty, the EEA Agreement did not establish a customs union, but an enhanced free trade area. The purpose and {{the scope of the}} EC Treaty and the EEA Agreement are therefore different. According to Article 8 EEA, the <b>principle</b> <b>of</b> free movement of goods as laid down in Articles 11 to 13 EEA applies only to goods originating in the EEA, while in the Community a product is in free circulation once it has been lawfully placed on the market in a Member State. In general, the latter applies {{in the context of the}} EEA only with respect to products originating in the EEA. In the case at hand, the product was manufactured in the United States and imported into Norway. Accordingly, it was not subject to the <b>principle</b> <b>of</b> the free movement of goods within the EEA. Based on this, the EFTA Court rejected the argument put forward by the governments of France, Germany, and the United Kingdom as well as by the European Commission that giving the EEA/EFTA States the right to opt for international exhaustion would lead to disparities in the EEA market. Article 7(1) of the Trade Mark Directive was interpreted so that it was for the EEA/EFTA States’ legislatures and courts to decide whether they wanted to introduce or to maintain the <b>principle</b> <b>of</b> international <b>exhaustion</b> <b>of</b> trade mark rights with regard to goods originating from outside the EEA. The EFTA Court found that international exhaustion was in the interest of free trade and competition and thus in the interest of consumers. Furthermore, the <b>principle</b> <b>of</b> international <b>exhaustion</b> was in line with the main function of a trade mark, to allow the consumer to identify with certainty the origin of the products. This interpretation of Article 7(1) of the Trade Mark Directive was also consistent with the TRIPs Agreement, which left the issue open for the Member States to regulate.|$|R
40|$|As digital {{networks}} {{emerge as}} the dominant means of distributing copyrighted works, the first sale doctrine is increasingly marginalized. The limitations first sale places on the exclusive right of distribution are of little importance when the alienation and use of copies entails their reproduction. This fact of the modern copyright marketplace has led to calls for statutory clarification of digital first sale rights. Acknowledging the obstacles to legislative intervention, this Article argues that courts are equipped today to limit copyright exclusivity in order to enable copy owners to make traditionally lawful uses of their copies, including resale through secondary markets. We argue that first sale is not simply an isolated limitation on the distribution right. Instead, it is a component <b>of</b> a broader <b>principle</b> <b>of</b> copyright <b>exhaustion</b> that emerges from early case law preceding the Supreme Court’s foundational decision in Bobbs-Merrill v.

Traditionally, exhaustion is premised on four assumptions that cannot be safely assumed in the online context: it applies to tangible copies only; it covers goods and not services; the goods should be sold but not licensed; and the property entitlement should be alienated upon transfer.

40|$|This Article {{discusses}} Section 109 of the Copyright Act, {{the first}} sale doctrine, {{in the context}} of digital media and internet-based storage. Traditionally, the first sale doctrine served as an important limitation on the exclusive rights of copyright owners, allowing copies of lawfully obtained works to be resold without interference from the copyright owner. As a result of this limitation, physical media remains freely alienable after the first sale, providing secondary markets for used copies and more consumer choice. However, {{due to the nature of}} digital media and the recent market shift among media distributors, first sale doctrine has become ambiguous and inconsistently applied. This Article argues that Section 109 of the Copyright Act should be amended to allow consumers to resell their lawfully acquired digital media.

The impact of the decision in Kirtsaeng, however, goes beyond international trade in books, pictures, and other communicative products, which are traditionally the subject matter of copyright protection. It directly extends to international trade in many other consumer products such as shampoos, watches, and chocolate. Even though these products cannot be copyrighted in their entirety because they are non-copyrightable articles, they frequently carry incidental features such as decorations, product design, product packaging, creative labels, logos, and so forth that can qualify for copyright protection.

40|$|Pharmaceuticals are an {{essential}} part of modern life. They help satisfy our everyday nutritional, sanitary and medical needs, and represent a primary method for preserving health and treating many diseases and conditions. Their spread, fostered by the progress of pharmaceutical research, created a ‘health revolution’, increasing human life expectancy and improving quality of life. Compared to surgical procedures, drugs represent a very cost-effective means for governments to protect the public health of their citizens. This should help reduce total health care expenditure. However, the cost of pharmaceuticals is accounting for an evergreater proportion of that expenditure. This in turn means that there is increasing scrutiny by governments to tighten budget controls on drugs. These elements have recently generated a renewed interest in the pharmaceutical industry’s practices, and especially in companies’ pricing policies, from both the public and regulators. They frequently claim that drugs are priced too highly and that this may undermine patients’ access to medicines, as well as their right to health. In the absence of effective market mechanisms capable of controlling excessive prices, governments have resorted {{to a wide variety of}} different policy tools to help them cap the rise of drug prices and of their health care expenditures. It is the difference between the tools used that has contributed to the presence of large price gaps across countries. Such differences in prices are the basis of what is called ‘parallel trade’. Parallel trade is a form of arbitrage that consists of the cross-border selling of a product protected by an intellectual property right (IPR) without the authorisation of the IPR owner. Parallel trade is an entirely EU phenomenon, because it is based on the <b>principle</b> <b>of</b> free movement of goods, as developed by the jurisprudence in the <b>principle</b> <b>of</b> regional <b>exhaustion</b> <b>of</b> IPRs. Under this principle any protected good that is first marketed in the EU by the IPR owner, or with his consent, shall freely circulate along the supply chain...|$|R
40|$|Copyright law {{struggles to}} provide a {{coherent}} framework for analyzing personal uses. Although there is widespread agreement {{that at least some}} such uses are non-infringing, the doctrinal basis for that conclusion remains unclear. In particular, the prevailing explanations of fair use and implied license are both flawed in important respects. This Article proposes a new explanation for the favored status of certain personal uses. Drawing on the <b>principle</b> <b>of</b> copyright <b>exhaustion</b> - the notion that once the copyright holder parts with a particular copy of a work, its power to control the use and disposition of that copy is constrained - we argue that many personal uses are rendered lawful by virtue of the simple fact of copy ownership. Owning copies entitles consumers to make certain uses of those copies and the works embodied in them, even in ways that may appear inconsistent with the rights of copyright holders. Under exhaustion, any copy owner has the right to reproduce, modify, and distribute her copy in order to fully realize its value qua copy. In a variety of personal use cases, courts have been swayed by arguments that highlight the defendant’s purchase or rightful ownership of a copy. But the prevailing approaches to personal use take copy ownership into account inconsistently and awkwardly, forcing courts to shoehorn their intuitions about ownership into doctrines designed to address very different questions. In contrast, exhaustion places copy ownership {{at the center of the}} digital personal use debate. And it helps us reconcile our intuitions about the proper scope of consumer control over copies they own with our formal legal articulations of the scope of infringement liability...|$|R
40|$|From {{its very}} beginnings, the {{jurisprudence}} of the European Court of Justice (ECJ) {{on the free}} movement of goods had to integrate intellectual property rights. 1 By and large, {{it can be said}} that the Court has been very successful in eliminating unwarranted restrictions to the free movement of goods on grounds of such rights. In several recent judgments, the Court refined its jurisprudence concerning the doctrine <b>of</b> <b>exhaustion.</b> This doctrine is the Court's formula for balancing two competing concerns: 2 on the one hand, the fundamental <b>principle</b> <b>of</b> free movement of goods, guaranteed by Art. 28 EC. This is relevant, in the present context, for parallel traders, who "play an important role in preventing the compartmentalisation of national markets". 3 On the other hand, there are the legitimate interests of the holders of intellectual property rights (recognised by Arts. 295 and 30 EC). The analysis of the case law can, thus, be subdivided into three aspects: the rights conferred on owners of intellectual property, the conditions for <b>exhaustion</b> <b>of</b> intellectual property rights to occur, and the consequences <b>of</b> <b>exhaustion...</b>|$|R
