25|$|Power {{lost the}} congressional election, and his trial against Morrison began on Dec. 3, 1924. State Rep. George Lommen {{was the first}} to take the witness stand on Power’s behalf. Morrison had {{attacked}} Lommen in the past, accusing him of collecting bribes from the operators of slot machines, as well as declaring that he was such a flip-flopping “political chameleon,” he would <b>probably</b> <b>end</b> up a Communist.|$|E
25|$|Accompanied by {{her husband}} Albert (Luigi Pistilli), Renata visits the house of Paolo Fassati (Leopoldo Trieste), an {{entomologist}} who lives {{on the grounds of}} Donati's estate. Fassati's wife Anna (Laura Betti) tells them that Donati was responsible for the Countess's death, and says that Simon will <b>probably</b> <b>end</b> up with the property. Renata, who had no idea she had a half-brother, swiftly dispenses with any notion of sibling affection and immediately begins making plans with her husband to murder Simon, who at the same time is orchestrating Renata's demise.|$|E

50|$|Williams {{and other}} place Dedumose {{as the last}} king of Egypt's 13th Dynasty. Precise dates for Dedumose are unknown, but {{according}} to the commonly accepted Egyptian chronology his reign <b>probably</b> <b>ended</b> around 1690 BC.|$|R
25|$|There {{are quite}} a few drug therapies that are {{possible}} for Parkinson's disease (ex. Sinemet). Since there is no cure for it, the patient will <b>probably</b> <b>end</b> up having to have surgery done to relieve some of the symptoms. When a patient has this procedure done, they are most likely going to receive a deep brain stimulation. So it will keep the brain stimulated even though the disease tries to disable it. Recently a study was performed to test if surgery helps the patients discover their symptoms post surgery than pre-surgery. They found that the symptoms were still present but the patients were more aware of their difficulties than before they had surgery. This shows that surgery does improve a patients speech perception, even though it might not cure their disease.|$|E

50|$|First holmgangs <b>probably</b> <b>ended</b> on {{the death}} or incapacitation of one combatant. Killing an {{opponent}} did not constitute a murder and therefore {{did not lead to}} outlawry or payment of weregeld. Later rules turned holmgang into a more ritualistic direction.|$|R
50|$|Trumped! was an American daily {{talk radio}} {{program that was}} hosted by American {{businessman}} and investor Donald Trump. It ran from June 14, 2004 and <b>probably</b> <b>ended</b> in 2008. A 2004 newspaper gives a length of two minutes for the program.|$|R
2500|$|Khan {{took part}} in the 10 m Air rifle {{individual}} event in the 2002 Commonwealth Games at the age of 15. [...] He performed well and found himself fifth before the last shot. At that moment he thought a good shot could earn him a fourth-place finish. [...] He said,"..if I could make a good I would <b>probably</b> <b>end</b> up fourth. The bronze was a possibility but slightly unlike". His final shot scored 9.9, with a total of 691.9, and he won the gold medal.|$|E
2500|$|A new song, [...] "City Hall", {{appeared}} in a setlist, and the band entered the studio in January 2009. On his online diary, Roddy Woomble noted that he had: [...] "been trying to work on lyrics for the new Idlewild record. At the moment it has {{the possibility of being}} about anything, so I've been trying to narrow that down a bit. I've been re-reading Jack Kerouac's novels and following this US election, and keeping up with all the new US groups, so maybe it'll take on a Stars and stripes theme. It'll <b>probably</b> <b>end</b> up being about mountains and Islands though." ...|$|E
2500|$|Joe Pesci didn't judge his {{character}} but found {{the scene where}} he kills Spider for talking back to {{his character}} hard to do, because he had trouble justifying the action until {{he forced himself to}} feel the way Tommy did. Lorraine Bracco found the shoot to be an emotionally difficult one because it was such a male-dominated cast, and she realized if she did not make her [...] "work important, it would <b>probably</b> <b>end</b> up on the cutting room floor". When it came to the relationship between Henry and Karen, Bracco saw no difference between an abused wife and her character.|$|E
5000|$|Placodus and its {{relatives}} {{were not as}} well-adapted to aquatic life as some later reptile groups, like the closely related plesiosaurs.

50|$|The ōn-stems were an innovated formation, {{created by}} {{attaching}} n-stem endings to older feminines in -ō.

2500|$|Shortly {{before the}} film's release, Weitz {{suggested}} that an extended {{cut of the}} film could be released on DVD, saying [...] "I'd really love to do a fuller cut of the film"; he further speculated that such a version [...] "could <b>probably</b> <b>end</b> up at {{two and a half}} hours." [...] This proposed cut would presumably not include the original ending: MTV reported in December 2007 that Weitz hoped to include that material {{at the beginning of a}} possible The Subtle Knife adaptation, and that a Compass Director's Cut might feature [...] "a moment" [...] of it as a [...] "teaser". Cast members Craig and Green have echoed this hope for such a DVD ...|$|E
2500|$|He had a minor {{knee injury}} during {{the end of}} the 2008 season, which led to {{corrective}} surgery. This slowed his Combine numbers; however, he improved upon them during MSU's Pro Days. He was one of three Spartans invited to the NFL combine. ESPN.com ranked him the 8th best running back in the draft. He was a projected third rounder in the 2009 NFL Draft. Another site lists him as a mid-second round draft choice. Ringer has drawn comparisons to NFL players Mike Hart and Chester Taylor. His performance at the MSU Pro Day [...] "absolutely blew NFL teams away", due to putting up impressive numbers while not fully recovered. NFL Analyst Mel Kiper Jr. said of Ringer [...] "He's only 5-9, 205, but he's remarkably strong, a good athlete and just a tough kid with great character. He blocks extremely well, and he'll be a very serviceable No. 2 back. He'll <b>probably</b> <b>end</b> up being a fourth- or fifth-round pick." ...|$|E
2500|$|Aosta drew up various {{plans to}} exploit the victory in Somaliland {{including}} a scheme to invade Kenya with two columns to rendezvous at Fort hall north of Nairobi, ready to capture the capital but under the text Aosta wrote, [...] "Extreme caution must be observed." [...] In Eritrea, Tessitore had proposed to invade Sudan soon after the declaration of war and capture Khartoum and Atbara. On orders from Rome, Aosta based strategy on events further north in Libya and Egypt; after the Italian invasion of Egypt Aosta considered that an offensive move was dependent {{on being able to}} link with the forces of Italian Libya, which became impossible after the British expelled the Italians from Egypt in Operation Compass (9 December 1940 – 9 February 1941). Aosta liaised with Marshal Rodolfo Graziani in Libya but as Italian supplies of fuel in the AOI diminished, passive defence became the only realistic choice. In late 1940, Aosta was advised that the war in Europe would <b>probably</b> <b>end</b> in October and waited on events.|$|E

50|$|Kirti Kaumidi also {{states that}} Jayasimha {{defeated}} Arnoraja, but adds that Jayasimha gave his daughter Kanchana in marriage to Arnoraja. Someshvara, {{the son of}} Arnoraja and Kanchana, was brought up at the Chaulukya court in Gujarat. The matrimonial alliance <b>probably</b> <b>ended</b> the conflict for a short period, but the Chaulukya-Chahamana conflict resumed after Jayasimha's death.|$|R
50|$|Unlike {{his father}} who invoked Shiva, Samkshobha's Khoh {{inscription}} opens with an invocation to the god Vasudeva. He {{is the last}} known of the dynasty, which <b>probably</b> <b>ended</b> with him.

2500|$|Medea {{comes to}} earth with {{a plot to}} set up Fanta to kill or injure a human, which would forever bar Fanta from Avalon. [...] She anoints Ryang with eye drops that will create up to 108 evil affinities with each girl he makes eye contact with, but her plan backfires when her gown is also torn by Ryang and she is miserably forced to stay on earth. For {{breaking}} the rules, the Prime Minister of Avalon (her brother Charon) exiles her, though the Chief Inspector (Fanta's brother Pain) offers parole if Medea helps Fanta deal with Ryang's evil affinities. Medea's recent plotting with rebels against the King of Avalon will <b>probably</b> <b>end</b> this deal. [...] Though she and Charon {{do not seem to}} always get along, they care about each great deal; Charon comforted her when she failed an exam miserably, partly from the pressure of having a brilliant faerie like Charon as a brother and the Prime Minister as her father, while Medea becomes visibly upset when Charon mysteriously disappears and agrees to help Pain find her brother and investigate the King of Avalon.|$|E
2500|$|Ringer was one {{of three}} MSU players to be invited to the NFL combine, along with QB Brian Hoyer and safety Otis Wiley. Ringer took part in Michigan State's 2009 NFL Pro Day at the Duffy Daugherty indoor facility. Ringer's shuttle time was 3.89, which was faster than the fastest time at the NFL combine. Ringer said of the workout, [...] "I think I did pretty well, {{especially}} coming back from my knee injury. I'm still not 100 percent, probably around 85 or 90. This is basically another big stepping stone from what I did at the combine. Now that I was able to do some training, I felt like my change of direction was superb. I feel like I did really well in the shuttle and in the three-cone drill." [...] He participated in an MSU-sponsored podcast after the event discussing the event. Ringer improved his forty time from a 4.59 at the combine to a 4.42 during Pro Days. When asked about where he wants to get drafted, Ringer responded, [...] "I'll go anywhere. To get picked up somewhere will be a blessing." [...] Ringer's performance at Pro Day [...] "absolutely blew NFL teams away", due to putting up impressive numbers while not fully recovered. With his draft stock on the rise, Ringer has worked out with several NFL teams, including the Denver Broncos, the Tennessee Titans and the San Diego Chargers. He has also drawn interest from the Seattle Seahawks. He has since received workouts from the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, the Buffalo Bills, and the New York Jets. A website that predicts him as a 3rd to 4th rounder also compares him to Priest Holmes. Ringer stated about his knee right before the draft, [...] "My leg feels fine. Right now, I'll give it between 90-95%." [...] One site calls Ringer a [...] "willing, if undersized, workhorse", but also questions his durability. When talking about draft day, Ringer responded [...] "I'm not nervous at all. I'm just kind of really mellow, calm ... knowing that whatever happens is going to happen, and whatever team I go to, that's the team where I'm meant to be." [...] Mel Kiper said of Ringer [...] "He's only 5-9, 205, but he's remarkably strong, a good athlete and just a tough kid with great character. He blocks extremely well, and he'll be a very serviceable No. 2 back. He'll <b>probably</b> <b>end</b> up being a fourth- or fifth-round pick." [...] Ringer spent time with his family in Dayton, Ohio, on April 25 watching the draft and celebrating his mother's birthday, waiting to get selected.|$|E
