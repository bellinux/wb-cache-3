40|$|Competitive {{location}} {{problems can}} be characterized {{by the fact that}} the decisions made by others will affect our own payoffs. In this paper, we address a discrete competitive location game in which two decision-makers have to decide simultaneously where to locate their services without knowing the decisions of one another. This problem arises in a franchising environment in which the decision-makers are the franchisees and the franchiser defines the potential sites for locating services and the rules of the game. At most one service can be located at each site, and one of the franchisees has <b>preferential</b> <b>rights</b> over the other. This means that if both franchisees are interested in opening the service in the same site, only the one that has <b>preferential</b> <b>rights</b> will open it. We consider that both franchisees have budget constraints, but the franchisee without <b>preferential</b> <b>rights</b> is allowed to show interest in more sites than the ones she can afford. We are interested in studying the influence of the existence of <b>preferential</b> <b>rights</b> and overbidding on the outcomes for both franchisees and franchiser. A model is presented and an algorithmic approach is developed for the calculation of Nash equilibria. Several computational experiments are defined and their results are analysed, showing that <b>preferential</b> <b>rights</b> give its holder a relative advantage over the other competitor. The possibility of overbidding seems to be advantageous for the franchiser, as well as the inclusion of some level of asymmetry between the two decision-makers...|$|R

An option contract constitutes two offers: a substantive offer and an undertaking or option to keep the offer open.

5000|$|Hypothec ( [...] or 16th century, from Fr. hypothèque, from Lat. hypotheca, from Gk. : hypothēkē), {{sometimes}} tacit hypothec, is a {{term used}} in mixed legal systems (e.g. Scots law, South African law, Ukrainian law (Іпотека)) to refer to an express or implied non-possessory real security over corporeal movable property. This real right in security operates by way of hypothecation, often arises by operation of law (generally statute), and gives a creditor a <b>preferential</b> <b>right</b> to have claims paid out of the hypothecated property as last recourse when the debtor is in default. At common law it is equivalent to an American non-possessory lien or English legal charge.|$|E
50|$|A {{right of}} {{pre-emption}} {{is a type}} of <b>preferential</b> <b>right</b> ‘to purchase at a fixed price or at a price at which the grantor is prepared to sell’. It is granted by a prospective seller to a prospective purchaser to give the purchaser right of first refusal if the prospective seller should decide to sell. A pre-emption right must comply with all the requirements for contracts in general. The capacity of the pre-emption grantor to alienate the thing in question is restricted. If the grantor breaches his undertaking to offer the thing to the holder, the holder’s remedy is an interdict preventing alienation to a third party. It is uncertain, though, whether a claim by the holder for specific performance would be successful.|$|E

50|$|In the hypothec, the {{property}} does not {{pass to the}} creditor, nor does he get possession, but he acquires a <b>preferential</b> <b>right</b> to have his debt paid out of the hypothecated property; that is, he can sell it and pay {{himself out of the}} proceeds, or in default of a purchaser he can become the owner himself. The name and the principle have passed into Scotland's civil law system, which distinguishes between conventional hypothecs, as bottomry and respondentia, and tacit hypothecs established by law. Of the latter the most important is the landlord's hypothec for rent (corresponding to distress in the law of England), which extends over the produce of the land and the cattle and sheep fed on it, and over stock and horses used in husbandry.|$|E

5000|$|In a {{situation}} of insolvency, the [...] "football creditors rule" [...] means that debts to other clubs or players are prioritised and must be paid in full before the club is eligible to compete again in the league. The Enterprise Act 2002 made reforms to the insolvency act and, from 15 September 2003, the altered procedures for administration were implemented. Most notably it abolished the Crown's <b>preferential</b> <b>right</b> to recover unpaid taxes ahead of other creditors. As such, HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC) is now often not paid in full (between 2003 and 2010, outstanding unpaid taxes to the HMRC amounted to £30 million). This legality of the football creditors rule was challenged in 2004 in Inland Revenue Commissioners v The Wimbledon Football Club Ltd. However, {{it was found that}} [...] "full payment to football creditors (out of third party funds) ahead of preferential creditors did not infringe the provisions of section s4(4)(a) of the Act" [...] and [...] "differential treatment may be necessary to secure the continuation of the company's business and may be regarded as supportable".|$|E
50|$|The fish {{sanctuary}} {{project of}} the LGU has contributed greatly to maintaining the level of fish supply in the area. Fisher-folk constitute a major {{segment of the population}} in the 18 barangays of Palompon that have access to the sea. According to DA data, some 26% of the population (1,230 out of 4,683 households) in these 18 barangays are fisher-folk. However, this estimate of fisher-folk population includes only those with bancas and do not include fisher-folk who rent boats or hire themselves out as laborers to fisher-folk-boat owners. Of these fisher-folk who own boats, 25% have motorized bancas while 75% rely on manual paddling. Because of their ability to venture out into the sea, fisher-folk with motorized bancas earn ten times as much as their colleagues with non-motorized bancas. Marketing of fish in Palompon is organized around middlemen (local name: “alpor’) who provide the fisher-folk with basic commodities and fishing supplies in exchange for the <b>preferential</b> <b>right</b> to buy their catch. The middlemen earns in two ways: 1) the basic commodities are priced at 10% higher than acquisition costs; and 2) the fish catch is priced lower by about 10-15% of the prevailing market price.|$|E

An additional requirement is [...] "Discovery", which follows the [...] "Prudent Man Rule." [...] This means that a sufficient indication of valuable mineral(s) would encourage a [...] "Prudent Man" [...] to further invest time and money developing the deposit towards the goal of mining it. The holder of a mining claim does not own the surface, the water, or even the rocks and gravel.
