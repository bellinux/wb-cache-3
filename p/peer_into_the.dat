2500|$|Heavy Rain was {{critically}} acclaimed. The UK Official PlayStation Magazine reviewer Tim Clark wrote, [...] "I'm convinced it's {{one of the}} freshest, most exciting, {{and even}} important games on PS3 so far." [...] Clark praised the effective controls of the game, {{as well as the}} pacing of the story, which the reviewer described as key, and perfectly designed to create an [...] "exhausting, exhilarating, and, crucially, involving" [...] experience. He concluded by saying that, [...] "Certainly there's nothing quite like it on PS3, or indeed any other system. Put gaming conventions aside, go in with no expectations other than this is something new and massively good-looking, and you'll be rewarded with a unique experience that lurches between genius and madness, manages to be genuinely emotional, and that you'll be bursting to talk about with your friends." [...] GamesMaster complimented Heavy Rain for being [...] "incredibly original and compelling", as [...] "the atmosphere is incredible â€“ full of driving rain (which becomes central to the plot), fizzing neon lights, dark apartments and warehouses. It's a dark noir game, not a bright adventure." [...] The game was given a GamesMaster Gold Award. IGN's Chris Roper praised the game's [...] "fantastic story that's {{one of the best in}} gaming." [...] However, he pointed out that the game's beginning is very slow, and might turn off some players. GameZone's Michael Lafferty wrote, [...] "There are some flaws, but taken as a package, Heavy Rain is a remarkable achievement in gaming that creates an interactive experience that goes beyond the pages of a good novel or film noir. This is a game that needs to be experienced." [...] Winda Benedetti wrote about the maturity of Heavy Rain as well as Remedy Entertainment's psychological action thriller Alan Wake for MSNBC, praising both titles for being [...] "emotionally powerful" [...] as well as having [...] "said goodbye to the tired alien invasions and over-the-top fantasy stories so often found in video games. Instead, they <b>peer</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> dark reaches of the very real human heart to deliver stories that are thrilling, chilling and utterly absorbing." ...|$|E
