Considerable interest {{has focused on}} understanding the molecular mechanisms of ChRs to bioengineer their properties for specific optogenetic applications such as elucidating the function of specific neurons in brain circuits. While most studies have used channelrhodopsin- 2 from Chlamydomonas reinhardtii (CrChR 2), in this work low-temperature Fourier transform infrared-difference spectroscopy is applied to study the conformational changes occurring during the primary <b>phototransition</b> of the red-shifted ChR 1 from Chlamydomonas augustae (CaChR 1). Substitution with isotope-labeled retinals or the retinal analogue A 2, site-directed mutagenesis, hydrogen−deuterium exchange, and H 2 18 O exchange were used to assign bands to the retinal chromophore, protein, and internal water molecules.

Substitution with isotope-labeled retinals or the retinal analogue A 2, site-directed mutagenesis, hydrogen-deuterium exchange, and H 2 (18) O exchange were used to assign bands to the retinal chromophore, protein, and internal water molecules. The primary <b>phototransition</b> of CaChR 1 at 80 K involves, in contrast to that of CrChR 2, almost exclusively an all-trans to 13 -cis isomerization of the retinal chromophore, as in the primary <b>phototransition</b> of bacteriorhodopsin (BR). In addition, significant differences are found for structural changes of the protein and internal water(s) compared to those of CrChR 2, including the response of several Asp/Glu residues to retinal isomerization. A negative amide II band is identified in the retinal ethylenic stretch region of CaChR 1, which reflects along with amide I bands alterations in protein backbone structure early in the photocycle. A decrease in the hydrogen bond strength of a weakly hydrogen bonded internal water is detected in both CaChR 1 and CrChR 2, but the bands are much broader in CrChR 2, indicating a more heterogeneous environment. Mutations involving residues Glu 169 and Asp 299 (homologues of the Asp 85 and Asp 212 Schiff base counterions, respectively, in BR) lead {{to the conclusion that}} Asp 299 is protonated during P 1 formation and suggest that these residues interact through a strong hydrogen bond that facilitates the transfer of a proton from Glu 169...|$|E
40|$|We {{study the}} {{in-plane}} stationary current caused by <b>phototransitions</b> {{between the states}} of a double quantum well. The electric polarization of light has both vertical and in-plane components. The stationary current originates from the periodic vibration of electrons between two non-equivalent quantum wells caused by the normal component of the alternating electric field with simultaneous in-plane acceleration/deceleration by the in-plane component of electric field. The quantum mechanism of the stationary current is conditioned by in-plane transition asymmetry which appears due to the indirect <b>phototransitions</b> with the participation of impurity scattering. The photocurrent has a resonant character corresponding to the equality of the photon energy to the distance between subbands. It is found that the current appears {{as a response to}} the linear-polarized light. Comment: 6 pages, 2 figure...|$|R

50|$|The {{ionization}} {{threshold energy}} of atoms and small molecules are typically {{larger than the}} photon energies that are most easily available experimentally. However, it can be possible to span this ionization threshold energy if the photon energy is resonant with an intermediate electronically excited state. While it is often possible to observe the lower Rydberg levels in conventional spectroscopy of atoms and small molecules, Rydberg states are even more important in laser ionization experiments. Laser spectroscopic experiments often involve ionization through a photon energy resonance at an intermediate level, with an unbound final electron state and an ionic core. On resonance for <b>phototransitions</b> permitted by selection rules, {{the intensity of the}} laser in combination with the excited state lifetime makes ionization an expected outcome. This RIS approach and variations permit very sensitive detection of specific species.|$|R

40|$|Molybdenum dichalcogenides are {{semiconductors}} with layered type structure, {{which can}} act as efficient electrodes in the realization of photoelectrochemical solar cells. The main advantage of this molybdenum diselenide (MoSe 2) semiconductor is the prevention of electrolyte corrosion because of the <b>phototransitions</b> involving non-bonding d–d orbital of the Mo atoms. Polycrystalline molybdenum diselenide thin films are prepared by pulsed electrodeposition on conducting glass and titanium substrates in galvanostatic mode from an ammoniacal solution of H 2 MoO 4 and SeO 2. The growth kinetics of the film was studied and the deposition parameters such as electrolyte bath concentration, bath temperature, time of deposition, deposition current, pH of the electrolyte and duty cycle of the current are optimized. X-ray diffraction analysis of the as deposited and annealed films showed the presence of highly textured MoSe 2 films with polycrystalline nature. EDAX spectrum of the surface composition confirms the nearly stoichiometric MoSe 2 nature of the film. Surface morphology studies by scanning electron microscope (SEM) shows that the films are pinhole free and of device quality nature. The optical absorption spectra show an indirect band gap value of 1. 16 eV. Conductivity measurements were carried out at different temperatures and electrical constants such as activation energy, trapped energy state and barrier height were calculated. # 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

Topics discussed include {{the advantages of}} the method, experimental considerations, and the determination f state densities and kinetic parameters (associated with state population/depopulation). Both steady-state and transient capacitance hanges are treated mathematically. Data for n-GaAs, p-GaAs, n-CdSe, a-Si and p-Zn~P ~ are presented to illustrate the wide applicability of the method and its sensitivity to both bulk and interface states, including those observed by other characterization methods. Electrochemical photocapacitance spectroscopy (EPS) has recently been shown to be a sensitive means for characterization f deep levels in semiconductor mate-rials (1). In the present paper, the EPS technique is described and illustrative results are presented for a variety of single-crystal nd polycrystalline materials. Since the intent of the authors is to encourage and facilitate use of EPS by both physicists and electro-chemists, considerable detail is given in areas expected to be unfamiliar to either group of scientists. It should also be emphasized that the focus here is on covering the practical aspects of applying the method rather than on providing a comprehensive quantitative treatment.

40|$|Quantum-field theory {{methods are}} applied to {{consider}} {{the state of the}} polarization field in a strongly-coupled large polaron (SCLP) and after its photodissociation. It is demonstrated that in the adiabatic approximation the polarization field in such a polaron coincides with the classical polarization field considered in Landau-Pekar theory up to small quantum fluctuations. However the state of this field after the polaron photodissociation is in principle different from that obtained in theories of Pekar and Emin. This results from the fact that as it is shown below the polarization field in a SCLP is a spatially inhomogeneous phonon condensate. If the charge carrier is removed from the SCLP on its photodissociation the phonon condensate decays into phonons. As any Bose-condensate, the phonon condensate is a superposition of states with different number of quanta where summands are phased up to small quantum fluctuations. Therefore decay of the phonon condensate at the SCLP photodissociation results in an essentially wider band in the absorption spectrum than that predicted by theories with classical consideration of the polarization: the position of maximum is 4. 2 Ep and the half-width 2. 5 Ep (3 Ep and Ep in Emin theory, respectively), where Ep is the polaron binding energy. The calculated band is in good conformity with mid-IR band in the optical conductivity spectra of complex oxides. The predicted ratio (approximately 4) of the maximum position of the band caused by the SCLP photoionization to the frequency of maximum of the band caused by <b>phototransitions</b> into polaron excited states calculated by other group is also in good conformity with experiments.

30|$|Using a {{developed}} co-precipitation method, we synthesized spherical Fe 3 O 4 nanoparticles {{with a wide}} nonlinear {{absorption band}} of visible radiation. Optical properties of the synthesized nanoparticles dispersed in an optically transparent copolymer of methyl methacrylate with styrene were studied by optical spectroscopy and z-scan techniques. We found that the electric polarizability of Fe 3 O 4 nanoparticles is altered by low-intensity visible radiation (I ≤ 0.2 kW/cm 2; λ = 442 and 561 nm) and reaches a value of 107 Å 3. The change in polarizability is induced by the intraband <b>phototransition</b> of charge carriers.

40|$|The photogalvanic {{effect is}} studied in {{electron}} gas over the liquid He surface {{with the presence}} of quantizing magnetic field. The gas is affected by the weak alternating microwave electric field tilted towards the surface normal. Both linear and circular photogalvanic effects are studied.

The photogalvanic tensor has strong resonances at the microwave frequency ω approaching to the frequencies of transitions between size-quantized subbands. The resonances are symmetric or antisymmetric, depending on a tensor component. Other resonances appear at ω≈ n ω_c, where n being integer and ω_c is the cyclotron frequency. It is found that the latter resonances split to two peaks connected with emission or absorption of ripplons.

40|$|Resonance Raman {{multicomponent}} {{spectra of}} the light-adapted form of bacteriorhodopsin, bRLA 568, and its first photoproduct, K 628, {{have been obtained}} at liquid nitrogen temperatures. The spectra of both bRLA 568 and K 628 could be obtained with the known sample compositions under our irradiating conditions and computer subtraction techniques. In agreement with previous results, we find that both bRLA 568 and K 628 contain chromophores linked to the apoprotein by protonated Schiff bases of retinal. Neither pigment form, suspended in H 2 O or 2 H 2 O, compares closely to the spectral features of all-trans and 13 -cis protonated and deuterated model chromophores, respectively. The data are consistent with other results, suggesting that a chromophore isomerization {{takes place in the}} bRLA 568 -to-K 628 <b>phototransition.</b> However, the exact structure of the in situ chromophore would appear not to involve simple trans-to- 13 -cis structures found in solution...|$|E
40|$|We {{report on}} time-resolved {{absorption}} {{studies of the}} bovine visual pigment rhodopsin with subpicosecond resolution at room temperature. Our data show that bathorhodopsin, rhodopsin's early photoproduct, is photochemically formed in 3. 0 +/- 0. 7 ps. The data suggest that bathorhodopsin formation is kinetically preceded by two species along the rhodopsin-to-bathorhodopsin reaction coordinate. The first is identified with the vertically excited Franck-Condon state. This decays with an approximately 200 -fs lifetime to an intermediate, which then decays to bathorhodopsin in 3. 0 ps. We assign this intermediate to be an excited state transient near 90 degrees along the 11 - 12 torsional coordinate of rhodopsin's chromophore. Exchange of rhodopsin's exchangeable protons for deuterons {{does not affect the}} observed dynamics. These observations are both qualitatively and quantitatively consistent with molecular dynamics calculations, which model the rhodopsin to bathorhodopsin <b>phototransition</b> as a cis-trans isomerization along the 11 - 12 torsional coordinate of rhodopsin's chromophore...|$|E
40|$|Mesoporphyrin IX {{substituted}} {{horseradish peroxidase}} was studied by fluorescence line narrowing and hole burning techniques at cryogenic temperatures. The spectral data reveal that four pyrrole tautomeric configurations of the chromophore are populated within the protein {{under the influence}} of irradiation and/or thermal treatment, and the existence of a fifth and a sixth tautomeric configuration is also likely. The relative population of the tautomers changes upon deuterium substitution through modification of the <b>phototransition</b> rate, and also depends on pH, which changes the protonation of neighboring amino acids in the heme pocket. The energy separation of the origins of the tautomers is approximately 100 cm- 1. The distribution of barrier heights separating the different tautomeric forms in the ground state and their distribution was determined by temperature cycling hole burning. The distributions can be approximated by Gaussians. The experiment directly yields the distributions on a relative temperature scale, and a model is presented to transform the barrier heights into energy values. It is suggested that the energies for the tautomers are split partially due to the protein crystal field and that the trapping of the tautomeric forms is the consequence of interactions with neighboring amino acids within the heme pocket...|$|E

An unusual complex picosecond electric response signal {{consisting of a}} positive and a negative peak was detected by a sampling oscilloscope. The ratio of the two peaks was changed by 1) reducing the repetition rate, 2) varying {{the intensity of the}} excitation beam, and 3) applying background illumination by light of 647 nm or 511 nm. All of these features {{can be explained by the}} simultaneous excitation of the bacteriorhodopsin ground form and the K intermediate. The latter was populated by the (quasi) continuous excitation attributable to its prolonged lifetime in a dehydrated state. Least-square analysis resulted in a 5 ps upper and 2. 5 ps lower limit for the time constant of the charge displacement process, corresponding to the forward reaction. That is in good agreement with the formation time of K. The charge separation driven by the reverse <b>phototransition</b> was faster, having a time constant of a 3. 5 ps upper limit.

Femtosecond two-pump probe experiments with a time resolution of 25 fs have been performed. The first рump pulse at 500 nm initiated cis-trans photoisomerization of rhodopsin chromophore, 11 -cis retinal, {{which resulted in the}} formation of the primary ground-state photoproduct within a mere 200 fs. The second pump pulse at 620 nm with a varying delay of 200 to 3750 fs relative to the first рump pulse, initiated the reverse <b>phototransition</b> of the primary photoproduct to rhodopsin. The results of this photoconversion have been observed on the differential spectra obtained after the action of two pump pulses at a time delay of 100 ps. It was found that optical density decreased at 560 nm in the spectral region of bathorhodopsin absorption and increased at 480 nm, where rhodopsin absorbs. Rhodopsin photoswitching efficiency shows oscillations as a function of the time delay between two рump pulses. The quantum yield of reverse photoreaction initiated by the second pump pulse falls within the range 15 % ± 1 %.

40|$|In this dissertation,the {{membrane}} protein channelrhodopsin- 1 {{from the green}} flagellate algae Chlamydomonas agustae (CaChR 1) is studied {{using a variety of}} spectroscopic techniques developed in the Rothschild Molecular Biophysics Laboratory at Boston University. Over the last decade, channelrhodopsins have proven to be effective optogenetic tools due to their ability to function as light-gated ion channels when expressed in neurons. This ability allows neuroscientists to optically activate an inward directed photocurrent which depolarizes the neuronal membranes and triggers an action potential. Although a variety of channelrhodopsins with different properties have been used, the underlying mechanisms of channelrhodopsin functionality is not yet fully understood. The protein studied here has several advantageous properties compared to the more extensively studied channelrhodopsin- 2 from Chlamydomonas reinhardtii including a red shifted visible absorption and slower light inactivation despite having a lower channel current. Elucidating the internal molecular mechanisms underlying the function of CaChR 1 provides critical insight into the large class of channelrhodopsin proteins leading toward improved bioengineering for specific optogenetic applications. Here near-IR pre-resonance Raman spectroscopy of CaChR 1 provides information on the structure of the unphotolyzed (P 0) retinal chromophore, the Schiff base protonation state, and presence of carboxylic acid residues interacting with the Schiff base. Low-temperature FTIR difference spectroscopy combined with site-directed mutagenesis and isotope labeling provide information on changes occurring in the retinal chromophore and protein during the primary <b>phototransition</b> (P 0 to P 1). This includes information about changes involving protonation state of binding-pocket residues, protein backbone structure, and internal water molecules. Further experiments combining low-temperature and time-resolved FTIR-difference spectroscopy reveal additional information about structural changes during the transition from the unphotolyzed state to the active (open channel) state of the protein (P 0 to P 2). This work has resulted in an initial model that describes key proton transfer events which occur between the Schiff base and carboxylic acid residues inside the active site of CaChR 1. The model raises the possibility that ion channel gating and ion specificity is regulated by the protonation changes of two key residues (Glu 169 and Asp 299) located near the Schiff base...|$|E
