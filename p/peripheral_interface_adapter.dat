A few were further expanded to 128 kB, 256 kB, or 512 kB, with home-built memory controllers/memory management units (MMUs).|$|R
5000|$|In 1976 Motorola {{switched}} the MC6800 family to a depletion-mode technology {{to improve the}} manufacturing yield and to operate at a faster speed. The <b>Peripheral</b> <b>Interface</b> <b>Adapter</b> had a slight change in the electrical characteristics of the I/O pins so the MC6820 became the MC6821.|$|E

50|$|The {{floppy disk}} drives were {{interfaced}} through a Fujitsu 8877 disk controller integrated circuit, a second-source of the Western Digital 1793. The parallel port was connected through a memory-mapped Motorola MC6821 <b>Peripheral</b> <b>Interface</b> <b>Adapter</b> (PIA) which allowed the port {{to be fully}} bidirectional; the Osborne manuals also claimed the port implemented the IEEE-488 interface bus but this was rarely used. The parallel port used a card-edge connector etched on the main board, exposed {{through a hole in}} the case; any IEEE-488 or printer cable had to be specially manufactured for the Osborne.|$|E
50|$|The W65C21S {{provides}} programmed {{microprocessor control}} {{of up to}} two peripheral devices (Port A and Port B). Peripheral device control is accomplished through two 8-bit bidirectional I/O Ports, with individually designed Data Direction Registers. The Data Direction Registers provide selection of data flow direction (input or output) at each respective I/O Port. Data flow direction may be selected on a line-by-line basis with intermixed input and output lines within the same port. The “handshake” interrupt control feature is provided by four peripheral control lines. This capability provides enhanced control over data transfer functions between the microprocessor and peripheral devices, as well as bidirectional data transfer between W65C21S <b>Peripheral</b> <b>Interface</b> <b>Adapters</b> in multiprocessor systems.|$|R

40|$|<b>Interface</b> <b>adapters</b> allow {{applications}} {{written for}} one interface {{to be reused}} with another interface without having to rewrite application code, and chaining <b>interface</b> <b>adapters</b> can significantly reduce the development effort required to create the <b>adapters.</b> However, <b>interface</b> <b>adapters</b> will often be unable to convert interfaces perfectly, so {{there must be a}} way to analyze the loss from <b>interface</b> <b>adapter</b> chains in order {{to improve the quality of}} interface adaptation. This paper describes a probabilistic approach to analyzing loss in <b>interface</b> <b>adapter</b> chains, which not only models whether a method can be adapted but also how well methods can be adapted. We also show that probabilistic optimal adapter chaining is an NP-complete problem, so we describe a greedy algorithm which can construct an optimal <b>interface</b> <b>adapter</b> chain with exponential time in the worst case.

5000|$|The chip {{high level}} design {{had to be}} turned into {{drawings}} of transistors and interconnects. At MOS Technology, the [...] "layout" [...] was a very manual process done with color pencils and vellum paper. The layout consisted of thousands of polygon shapes on six different drawings; one for each layer of the semiconductor fabrication process. Rod Orgill {{was responsible for the}} 6501 design; he had assisted John Buchanan at Motorola on the 6800. Bill Mensch did the 6502; he was the designer of the 6820 <b>Peripheral</b> <b>Interface</b> <b>Adapter</b> (PIA) at Motorola. Harry Bawcom, Mike James and Sydney-Anne Holt helped with the layout.|$|E
50|$|The {{first task}} was to {{redesign}} the 6800 MPU to improve the manufacturing yield and to operate at a faster clock. This design used depletion-mode technology and was known internally as the MC6800D. The transistor count went from 4000 to 5000 but the die area was reduced from 29.0 mm2 to 16.5 mm2. The maximum clock rate for selected parts doubled to 2 MHz. The other chips in the M6800 family were also redesigned to use depletion-mode technology. The <b>Peripheral</b> <b>Interface</b> <b>Adapter</b> had a slight change in the electrical characteristics of the I/O pins so the MC6820 became the MC6821. These new IC were completed in July 1976.|$|E
50|$|Bill Mensch joined Motorola in 1971 {{after graduating}} from the University of Arizona. He had worked several years as an {{electronics}} technician before earning his BSEE degree. The first year at Motorola was a series of three-month rotations through four different areas. Mensch did a flowchart for a modem that would become the 6860. He also worked the application group that was defining the M6800 system. After this training year, he was assigned to the 6820 <b>Peripheral</b> <b>Interface</b> <b>Adapter</b> (PIA) development team. Mensch was a major contributor to the design of this chip and received a patent on the IC layout and was named as a co-inventor of seven other M6800 system patents. Later Mensch would design the MOS Technology 6502 microprocessor.|$|E
40|$|By using {{different}} <b>interface</b> <b>adapters</b> for different methods, {{it is possible}} to construct a maximally covering web of <b>interface</b> <b>adapters</b> which incurs minimum loss during interface adaptation. We introduce a polynomial-time algorithm that can achieve this. However, we also show that minimizing the number of adapters included in a maximally covering web of <b>interface</b> <b>adapters</b> is an NP-complete problem. Comment: 7 page...|$|R

50|$|The 6502 was {{designed}} {{by many of the}} same engineers that had designed the Motorola 6800 microprocessor family. Motorola started the 6800 microprocessor project in 1971 with Tom Bennett as the main architect. The chip layout began in late 1972, the first 6800 chips were fabricated in February 1974 and the full family was officially released in November 1974. John Buchanan was the designer of the 6800 chip and Rod Orgill, who later did the 6501, assisted Buchanan with circuit analyses and chip layout. Bill Mensch joined Motorola in June 1971 after graduating from the University of Arizona (at age 26). His first assignment was helping define the peripheral ICs for the 6800 family and later he was the principal designer of the 6820 <b>Peripheral</b> <b>Interface</b> <b>Adapter</b> (PIA). Motorola's engineers could run analog and digital simulations on an IBM 370-165 mainframe computer. Bennett hired Chuck Peddle in 1973 to do architectural support work on the 6800 family products already in progress. He contributed in many areas, including the design of the 6850 ACIA (serial interface).|$|E

40|$|Despite {{providing}} similar functionality, multiple {{network services}} may {{require the use}} of different interfaces to access the functionality, and this problem will only get worse with the widespread deployment of ubiquitous computing environments. One way around this problem is to use <b>interface</b> <b>adapters</b> that adapt one interface into another. Chaining these <b>adapters</b> allows flexible <b>interface</b> adaptation with fewer adapters, but the loss incurred due to imperfect interface adaptation must be considered. This paper outlines a mathematical basis for analyzing the chaining of lossy <b>interface</b> <b>adapters.</b> We also show that the problem of finding an optimal <b>interface</b> <b>adapter</b> chain is NP-complete.

40|$|A {{universal}} <b>interface</b> <b>adapter</b> circuit <b>interfaces,</b> for example, {{a wireless}} communications headset with {{any type of}} communications system, including those that require push-to-talk (PTT) signaling. The <b>interface</b> <b>adapter</b> is comprised of several main components, including an RF signaling receiver, a microcontroller and associated circuitry for decoding and processing the received signals, and programmable impedance matching and line interfacing circuitry for interfacing a wireless communications headset system base to a communications system. A signaling transmitter, which is preferably portable (e. g., handheld), is employed by the wireless headset user to send signals to the signaling receiver. In an {{embodiment of the invention}} directed specifically to push-to-talk (PTT) signaling, the wireless headset user presses a button on the signaling transmitter when they wish to speak. This sends a signal to the microcontroller which decodes the signal and recognizes the signal as being a PTT request. In response, the microcontroller generates a control signal that closes a switch to complete a voice connection between the headset system base and the communications system so that the user can communicate with the communications system. With this arrangement, the wireless headset can be interfaced to any communications system that requires PTT signaling, without modification of the headset device. In addition, the <b>interface</b> <b>adapter</b> can also be configured to respond to or deliver any other types of signals, such as dual-tone-multiple-frequency (DTMF) tones, and on/off hook signals.
