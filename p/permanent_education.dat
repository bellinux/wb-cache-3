In this, they distinguish between the various age groups. The provinces of Flevoland and Groningen commissioned SWOV to make {{a study of the}} feasibility of traffic education for the target group of 25 - 60 years old. The study consists of two parts. In the first part a study was made of where the road safety problems of the target group lie, and of which points of application there are for traffic education. This part used the literature and analysis of databases. In the second part, the design of this traffic education, especially the learning goals, was examined. It was determined which behaviour and which of its influence factors need attention for educating the target group. For the learning goals, the same structure was used as for that of the car driving licence, as formulated by the Ministry of Transport. The specific learning goals were discussed in interviews with key figures of the <b>permanent</b> traffic <b>education</b> in the Netherlands. The interviews determined the primary items for <b>permanent</b> traffic <b>education</b> of the target group. Furthermore, the interviews, together with the literature, indicated points of application for the design of a programme for <b>permanent</b> traffic <b>education</b> and the roles that the various organisations could play. Based on this, it is suggested how Provincial Road Safety Boards can stimulate and strengthen education programmes for driving licence holders...|$|R

5000|$|Akhandananda was {{the first}} monk of the Ramakrishna order, who gave shape to the {{cherished}} desire of Vivekananda to begin rural development work—even before the Mission was established. The distressing sorrows and suffering of the masses pulled {{him down to the}} plains, and to them he became a harbinger of peace and succour. Sacrificing his Himalayan bliss, he chose to be with poor. Akhandananda practised till the very end of his life his Master's call: [...] Worship jiva as Shiva. He was one of the pillars of the Ramakrishna Movement's service activities.His experience as a wandering monk, like those of Vivekananda moved him to take steps to remove the distress and misery of the masses. Vivekananda’s encouraging letter from America which was sent as a reply to Akhandananda’s request for guidance pushed him further, and in 1894 Akhandananda began his campaign against poverty.The idea of working for the poor was conceived while he stayed in Jamnagar with Jhandu Bhatt, the famous ayurvedic physician, who served his patients with exceptional devotion.While in Khetri, Rajasthan during 1894, he went about from door to door, all alone to bring awareness in the people about the utility of education, and it was because of his efforts that the number of students in the Khetri Rajya English School rose from 80 to 257.Under his inspiration the Maharaja of Khetri Ajit Singh arranged for the education of the Golas and also set up a <b>permanent</b> <b>Education</b> Department to open schools in the villages. Akhandananda also arranged for the publication of a newspaper on agriculture in order to educate the farmers of that area. He also contacted renowned landlords in the numerous village of Khetri, inspiring them to take some concrete steps towards removing the miseries of their poor labourers. At the instance of the Swami the Sanskrit school in Khetri was converted to Vedic school and he raised subscriptions to purchase books for the poor students. He fed the Bhils, an aboriginal tribe, in Uadaipur. He left Rajputana in 1895 and returned to the Alambazar Math, the new monastery of the Ramakrishna disciples. He first came in contact with widespread famine during his travel in the Murshidabad district of Bengal. He sought help from his brother disciples in 1897 and Vivekananda, who had returned to India by then, sent two monks with money.On 1 May 1897 Vivekananda inaugurated the Ramakrishna Mission, and Akhandananda opened a relief centre on 15 May in the temple premises of Mrityunjay Bhattacharya of Kedar-Mahula in Murshidabad to save people from an all-devouring famine. Though rice was difficult to procure at that time, he managed to procure some with the help of other people and with much trouble. Then he distributed equally among the poor, weighing the rice himself on a scale. This {{was the first}} public service work done by the Ramakrishna Mission.|$|E
