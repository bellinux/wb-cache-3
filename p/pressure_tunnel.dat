They were offered in a night program by the University of Virginia, held at the all-white Hampton High School. Jackson petitioned the City of Hampton to allow her to attend the classes. After completing the courses, she was promoted to aerospace engineer in 1958, and became NASA's first black female engineer. She analyzed data from wind tunnel experiments and real-world aircraft flight experiments at the Theoretical Aerodynamics Branch of the Subsonic-Transonic Aerodynamics Division at Langley. Her goal was to understand air flow, including thrust and drag forces, in order to improve United States planes.|$|E

40|$|Optimization of rock {{support is}} a key for the {{successful}} use of underground space for hydropower development in the Himalaya. Therefore, finding innovative, optimum and economic solution {{will be the only}} way to guarantee on such optimization. A main issue is to find out the extent of hydraulic fracturing and access the water leakage possibility during the operation of such tunnels. The leaked water not only causes economic loss but also may severely affect the stability of tunnel, valley side slopes and the environment. The use of fully concrete/steel lined <b>pressure</b> <b>tunnels</b> against hydraulic fracturing in the rock mass is of costly solution. Hence, it is advantageous to explore possibilities of minimizing the length of the concrete or steel lining in high <b>pressure</b> <b>tunnels</b> and shafts. A proper assessment of hydraulic fracturing of the rock mass plays an important role in this endeavor. This paper evaluates whether or not hydraulic fracturing (splitting) will occur at the 4750 m long shotcrete-lined high <b>pressure</b> headrace <b>tunnel</b> of 456 MW Upper Tamakoshi Hydroelectric Project (UTKHEP).

40|$|Since {{the end of}} the Second World War, {{prestressed}} concrete has undergone a period of turbulent development, attributable predominantly to the intense activity in construction during this period and partly also to the change in the cost structure, which resulted in a shift from steel to {{prestressed concrete}}.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to explore the {{relationship}} between carpal <b>tunnel</b> <b>pressure</b> and fingertip force during a simple pressing task. Carpal <b>tunnel</b> <b>pressure</b> was measured in 15 healthy volunteers by means of a saline-filled catheter inserted percutaneously into the carpal tunnel of the nondominant hand. The subjects pressed on a load cell with the tip of the index finger and with 0, 6, 9, and 12 N of force. The task was repeated in 10 wrist postures: neutral; 10 and 20 degrees of ulnar deviation; 10 degrees of radial deviation; and 15, 30, and 45 degrees of both flexion and extension. Fingertip loading significantly increased carpal <b>tunnel</b> <b>pressure</b> for all wrist angles (p = 0. 0001). Post hoc analyses identified significant increase (p < 0. 05) in carpal <b>tunnel</b> <b>pressure</b> between unloaded (0 N) and all loaded conditions, as well as between the 6 and 12 N load conditions.

40|$|At the {{collapse}} zone, {{the effects of}} the thickness of the consolidation grouting layer and the water pressure on the steel lining are vital to the stability of steel-lined <b>pressure</b> diversion <b>tunnels.</b> In this paper, a joint element and the load-sharing ratio of the consolidation layer are introduced to investigate the joint load-bearing characteristics of the steel lining and the consolidation layer and to determine a suitable consolidation layer thickness; a coupling method for simulating the hydromechanical interaction of the reinforced concrete lining is adopted to investigate the effect of internal water exosmosis on the seepage field at {{the collapse}} zone and to determine the external water pressure on the steel lining. In the case of a steel-lined <b>pressure</b> diversion <b>tunnel,</b> a numerical simulation is implemented to analyse the effect of the thickness of the consolidation layer and the distribution of the seepage field under the influence of internal water exosmosis.

40|$|Elevated carpal <b>tunnel</b> <b>pressure</b> is an {{important}} pathomechanism in carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS). Several invasive methods have been described for direct measurement of carpal <b>tunnel</b> <b>pressure,</b> but all have two important limitations. The pressure gauge requires sterilisation between uses, which makes time-efficient data collection logistically cumbersome, and more importantly, the reliability of carpal <b>tunnel</b> <b>pressure</b> measurements has not been evaluated {{for any of the}} methods in use. This technical note describes a new method to measure carpal <b>tunnel</b> <b>pressure</b> using inexpensive, disposable pressure sensors and reports the within and between session reliability of the pressure recordings in five different wrist positions and during typing and computer mouse operation. Intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC [3, 1]) were calculated for recordings within one session for healthy participants (n = 7) and patients with CTS (n = 5), and for recordings between two sessions for patients with CTS (n = 5). Overall, the reliability was high. With the exception of two coefficients, the reliability of the recordings at different wrist angles varied from 0. 63 to 0. 99. Reliability for typing and mouse operation ranged from 0. 86 to 0. 99. The new method described in this report is inexpensive and reliable, and data collection can be applied more efficiently as off-site sterilisation of equipment is not required. These advances are likely to promote future research into carpal <b>tunnel</b> <b>pressure,</b> such as investigation of the therapeutic mechanisms of various conservative treatment modalities that are believed to reduce elevated carpal <b>tunnel</b> <b>pressure.</b> (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

Solutions are obtained which enable designers {{to compute the}} <b>tunnel</b> <b>pressure</b> {{that is needed to}} maintain stability of an unsupported heading during the construction process. These solutions take account of the ground surcharge, the tunnel geometry, the soil unit weight, a non-homogeneous undrained shear strength, and are expressed in dimensionless form. The numerical results have been obtained using finite element formulations of the upper and lower bound theorems of limit analysis. By obtaining upper and lower bound estimates on the <b>tunnel</b> <b>pressure,</b> the actual <b>tunnel</b> <b>pressure</b> required to maintain stability can be bracketed from above and below. This provides an inbuilt error indicator for the accuracy of the solutions. Some upper bounds are also presented from the use of simple rigid block mechanisms.
