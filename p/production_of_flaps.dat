40|$|PURPOSE. Programmed {{cell death}} (apoptosis) is the {{controlled}} death of cells that occurs with minimal collateral damage to surrounding cells or tissue during development, homeostasis, and wound healing. The authors hypothesize that keratocyte apoptosis is an initiating {{factor in the}} wound-healing response after refractive surgical procedures. To evaluate the effects of different corneal manipulations, keratocyte apoptosis was examined qualitatively and quantitatively after traditional epithelial scrape-photorefractive keratectomy (PRK), transepithelial PRK, removal of a cap of superficial cornea using a microkeratome, <b>production</b> <b>of</b> a <b>flap</b> <b>of</b> superficial cornea with a microkeratome, and laser-assisted in situ keratomileusis (LASIK) compared with unwounded controls in rabbit corneas.

40|$|The flying {{ability of}} insects is spellbinding: dragonflies can catch their prey in midair, {{mosquitoes}} have an intricate in-flight mating ritual, honey-bees {{are able to}} land precisely on a small flower. Even the minute fruit fly can accurately induce sudden flight maneuvers in milliseconds. To {{gain an understanding of}} how insects are able to perform these feats, scientists and engineers have, {{for more than a century}} and a half, pursued the principles behind how insects fly. This research has lead to many breakthroughs in our understanding of the behavior and force <b>production</b> <b>of</b> <b>flapping</b> wings. Despite such successes, many aspects of how insects are able to maneuver and precisely control their flight with such apparent ease, remain poorly understood. Insects control their flight by altering the motion of their rapidly beating wings. Therefore, in this thesis, we ask how insects actuate their wings. We focus mainly on a single degree of freedom of the wings: their orientation as they slice through the air, termed the wing pitch. This particular motion is chosen because of the sensitivity of the aerodynamic forces on both fixed wing and flapping flight to changes in wing pitch. The major results of this thesis are contained in Chapter 2 -Chapter 5. In these chapters, we build a quantitative understanding of how insects pitch their wings. This part of the thesis culminates in Chapter 5 where we show how insects modulate wing pitching to induce flight maneuvers. We briefly summarize each chapter below. In Chapter 2, we analyze the hovering wing kinematics of insects and find that they do not do any positive work to pitch their wings. The wing inertia and aerodynamic forces both tend to rotate the wing, suggesting that wing pitching is largely passive. In Chapter 3, we describe the methods we developed to measure and visualize the kinematics of freely-flying fruit flies. In Chapter 4, we analyze the kinematics of freely-flying fruit flies and find that the pitching motion of insect wings can be understood by modeling the viscoelastic properties of the wing joints. In Chapter 5, we analyze the motion of maneuvering fruit flies and find that these insects turn by modulating their wing pitch, in effect rowing through the air. We show that their flight dynamics ultimately derive from fine-tuned biomechanical properties of the wing hinge with only subtle actuation by the musculature. The second part of the thesis focuses on the numerical methods used throughout this work. In Chapter 6, we describe the aerodynamic models used to compute the forces on insect wings. Finally, we end in Chapter 7 with a discussion of a topic somewhat separate from the rest of the thesis: we introduce a genetic programming method that determines symbolic relationships between variables from time-series measurements. We apply this method to finding an improved quasi-steady model for the aerodynamic torque that rotates a two-dimensional falling plate...|$|R

As a part of this project, the current thesis investigates the draping effects of carbon fiber non-crimp fabrics on the AFS Tooling. Simulation software packages based on two different draping techniques are employed to perform the draping simulation and develop the draping strategy; ANSYS Composite PrePost (Kinematic Mapping Approach) and PAM-FORM (Finite Element Approach. An extensive material characterization of the fabrics by means of the picture frame test, the friction and the bending test are performed in order to generate required data to execute the simulation. The goal of the simulations is to obtain a near net shape flattening or flatwraps of the plies and to predict and investigate shearing of the plies that might lead to defects such as fiber wrinkling.

40|$|In recent years, {{conventional}} flaps {{which make}} a sacrifice of main arteries as reported frequently in the early stage of their development have been reevaluated in the field <b>of</b> <b>flap</b> surgery. This movement has facilitated development <b>of</b> <b>flaps</b> vascularized by perforating branches measuring about 0. 3 mm in diareter, and has also thrown light on the merits <b>of</b> venous <b>flaps</b> which make no sacrifice of main arteries. Looking back on the history <b>of</b> venous <b>flaps,</b> they initially attracted attention because, in contrast to conven- tional flaps, 1) they do not {{make a sacrifice}} of main arteries, 2) they are not limited by {{the conditions of the}} recipient site, and 3) preparation <b>of</b> the <b>flap</b> is technically easy and applicable to emergency operations. Because of these advantages, venous flaps have been used widely in the clinical setting, but the mechasism <b>of</b> <b>flap</b> survival remains conjectural. The present study was designed to determine the limits <b>of</b> venous <b>flap</b> viability supplied by one vein, {{which is one of the}} questions related to venous flap stirvival. A flom-through venous flap measuring 3. 0 × 3. 0 cm was prepared in the lateral margin of the auricle in rabbits, and the area <b>of</b> <b>flap</b> viability was determined.

Methods: Microvascular island groin flaps were elevated bilaterally in 32 Lewis rats. On the right flap, the epigastric nerve was resected and ligated (noninnervated flap), and on the left flap, the nerve was crushed (innervated flap). ASCs, SC-like cells differentiated from ASCs (dASCs), SCs, or vehicle were simultaneously injected to the dermal and hypodermal layers <b>of</b> <b>flap.</b> After 20 weeks, the reinnervation pattern <b>of</b> <b>flap</b> was assessed immunohistochemically using a neuronal marker, PGP 9. 5. Results: dASC cultures produced significantly higher amount of nerve growth factor and brain-derived neurotrophic factor compared with ASC cultures (P 0. 05). In the center <b>of</b> <b>flap,</b> there was no statistically significant increase in reinnervation density in all groups irrespective <b>of</b> <b>flap</b> innervation (P > 0. 05). Conclusions: dASCs could improve flap reinnervation by 2 mechanisms: First, neurotrophic factors produced by dASCs facilitated regrowth of cutaneous axons from the surroundings <b>of</b> <b>flap.</b> Second, nerve growth factor released by dASCs induced the collateral sprouting of undamaged axons in adjacent tissues.

This thesis presents the development of an Integrated Testing System (ITS), which allows the evaluation <b>of</b> <b>flapping</b> wing performance for different flapping motions. A detailed parametric study of the effect <b>of</b> <b>flapping</b> motion on wing performance is performed, and the optimal flapping motion for several passive flapping wings is determined by hardware-in-the-loop optimisation of two wing performance metrics. The developed ITS was able to automatically test a variety <b>of</b> passive <b>flapping</b> wings, and demonstrated precise control <b>of</b> the <b>flapping</b> motion and accurate and repeatable measurements of average lift force, mechanical power, and wing twist angle. The parametric study revealed that <b>of</b> the three <b>flapping</b> motions tested, the sinusoidal flapping motion generated the highest lift force, but a smoothed triangular motion was able to generate lift significantly more efficiently under load. The optimal flapping motion was successfully determined for three flapping wings, and was found to increase the loaded efficiency of the wings by an average of 31 % over a sinusoidal flapping motion. The determined optimal motion was almost identical for the three tested wings, and was found to strongly resemble the <b>flapping</b> motion <b>of</b> insects These findings demonstrate that significant improvements in the performance <b>of</b> passive <b>flapping</b> wings can be achieved by relatively minor variations <b>of</b> the <b>flapping</b> motion.

[...] Calculations {{have been}} made of the induced drag <b>of</b> <b>flapped</b> {{elliptic}} wings covering a range of aspect ratios from about 4 to about 12, a range <b>Of</b> <b>flap</b> spans from 0. 2 to 1. 0 of the wing span, and a range <b>of</b> <b>flap</b> cut-outs • from 0 to 0. 6 of the wing span. The results are presented in charts in a convenient form for application. Calculations have also {{been made of the}} induced drag of elliptic wings of an aspect ratio of about 6 with flaps that extend the local chord by 40 per cent when in operation; <b>flap</b> spans <b>of</b> 0. 26, 0. 5 and 0. 77 of the wing span were examined. It is concluded that for a given net flap span and lift increment minimum induced drag will be obtained with a cut-out of about 0. 1 wing span. The effect of local chord extension due to a flap was found to be negligible. These results apply strictly to elliptic wings but they probably apply with fair accuracy to wings of taper ratio of the order of 2 : 1. 1. Iutroduction.

40|$|Quasi-steady {{aerodynamic}} models play {{an important}} role in evaluating aerodynamic performance and conducting design and optimization <b>of</b> <b>flapping</b> wings. The kinematics <b>of</b> <b>flapping</b> wings is generally a resultant motion of wing translation (yaw) and rotation (pitch and roll). Most quasi-steady models are aimed at predicting the lift and thrust generation <b>of</b> <b>flapping</b> wings with prescribed kinematics. Nevertheless, it is insufficient to limit flapping wings to prescribed kinematics only since passive pitching motion is widely observed in natural flapping flights and preferred for the wing design <b>of</b> <b>flapping</b> wing micro air vehicles (FWMAVs). In addition to the aerodynamic forces, an accurate estimation of the aerodynamic torque about the pitching axis is required to study the passive pitching motion <b>of</b> <b>flapping</b> flights. The unsteadiness arising from the wing’s rotation complicates the estimation of the centre of pressure (CP) and the aerodynamic torque within the context of quasi-steady analysis. Although there are a few attempts in literature to model the torque analytically, the involved problems are still not completely solved. In this work, we present an analytical quasi-steady model by including four aerodynamic loading terms. The loads result from the wings translation, rotation, their coupling as well as the added-mass effect. The necessity of including all the four terms in a quasi-steady model in order to predict both the aerodynamic force and torque is demonstrated. Validations indicate a good accuracy of predicting the CP, the aerodynamic loads and the passive pitching motion for various Reynolds numbers. Moreover, compared to the existing quasi-steady models, the presented model does not rely on any empirical parameters and thus is more predictive, which enables application to the shape and kinematics optimization <b>of</b> <b>flapping</b> wings.
