40|$|Different {{sources of}} folate may have {{different}} bioavailability and hence may impact the standard definition of folate equivalents. In order to examine this, a short term human study was undertaken to evaluate the relative native folate bioavailabilities from spinach, Camembert cheese and wheat germs compared to <b>pteroylmonoglutamic</b> <b>acid</b> as the reference dose. The study had a single-centre, randomised, four-treatment, four-period, four-sequence, cross-over design, i. e. the four (food) items to be tested (referred to as treatments) were administered in sequences according to the Latin square, so that each experimental treatment occurred only once within each sequence and once within each study period. Each of the 24 subjects received the four experimental items separated by a 14 -day equilibrium phase and received a <b>pteroylmonoglutamic</b> <b>acid</b> supplement for 14 days before the first testing and between the testings for saturation of body pools. Folates in test foods, plasma and urine samples were determined by stable isotope dilution assays, and in urine and plasma, the concentrations of 5 -methyltetrahydrofolate were evaluated. Standard non-compartmental methods were applied to determine the biokinetic parameters C, t and AUC from baseline corrected 5 -methyltetrahydrofolate concentrations within the interval from 0 to 12 hours. The variability of AUC and C was moderate for spinach and oral solution of <b>pteroylmonoglutamic</b> <b>acid</b> but high for Camembert cheese and very high for wheat germs. The median t was lowest for spinach, though t showed a high variability among all treatments. When comparing the ratio estimates of AUC and C for the different test foods, highest bioavailability was found for spinach followed by that for wheat germs and Camembert cheese. The results underline the dependence of folate bioavailability {{on the type of}} food ingested. Therefore, the general assumption of 50 % bioavailability as the rationale behind the definition of folate equivalents has to be questioned and requires further investigation. This journal i...|$|E

40|$|Different dietary {{sources of}} folate have differing bioavailabilities which may affect their {{nutritional}} value. In {{order to examine}} if these differences also occur within the same food products, a short term human pilot study was undertaken as a follow-up study to a previously published human trial to evaluate the relative native folate bioavailabilities from low-fat Camembert cheese compared to <b>pteroylmonoglutamic</b> <b>acid</b> as the reference dose. Two healthy human subjects received the test foods in a randomized cross-over design separated by a 14 -day equilibrium phase. Folate body pools were saturated with a <b>pteroylmonoglutamic</b> <b>acid</b> supplement before the first testing and between the testings. Folates in test foods and blood plasma were analysed by stable isotope dilution assays. The biokinetic parameters Cmax, tmax and AUC were determined in plasma within the interval of 0 to 12 hours. When comparing the ratio estimates of AUC and Cmax for the different Camembert cheeses, a higher bioavailability was found for the low-fat Camembert assessed {{in the present study}} (≥ 64 %) compared to a different brand in our previous investigation (8. 8 %). It is suggested that these differences may arise from the different folate distribution in the soft dough and firm rind as well as differing individual folate vitamer proportions. The results clearly underline the importance of the food matrix, even within the same type of food product, in terms of folate bioavailability. Moreover, our findings add to the increasing number of studies questioning the general assumption of 50 % bioavailability as the rationale behind the definition of folate equivalents.

40|$|Taste {{perception}} {{may influence}} dietary preferences and nutrient intakes contributing to diet-related disease susceptibility. This study examined bitter taste genetics and whether {{variation in the}} TAS 2 R 38 gene at three polymorphic loci (A 49 P, V 262 A and I 296 V) could alter dietary and systemic folate levels and dietary vitamin C intake, and whether a nutrigenetic circuit existed that might link bitter taste, folate/antioxidant status and risk for a colonic adenomatous polyp. TAS 2 R 38 diplotype predicted bitter taste (PROP) phenotype (p value < 0. 00001) and red cell folate status (p = 0. 0179) consistent with the diplotype that has the broadest range of bitter perception (AVI/PAV) also possessing the highest average red cell folate value. However, TAS 2 R 38 diplotype did not predict dietary intake of methylfolic acid, <b>pteroylmonoglutamic</b> <b>acid</b> or total folic acid. Neither did it predict dietary intake of vitamin C. Despite this, intake of dietary folate predicts red cell folate with analysis pointing to a key nutrient-nutrient interaction between vitamin C intake and systemic folate status. Analysis of 38 patients with an adenomatous polyp and 164 controls showed that individually, dietary nutrient intake, nutrient status and taste diplotype did not influence polyp risk. However, red cell folate status (in individuals below the population median value) did interact with bitter taste diplotype (AVI/PAV) to predict polyp risk (p = 0. 0145). Furthermore, synthetic folic acid (below median intake) was statistically associated with adenoma occurrence (p = 0. 0215); individuals with adenomatous polyps had a 1. 77 × higher intake than controls. Additionally, stepwise regression taking account of all dietary nutrients showed a tight relationship between methylfolic acid (but not <b>pteroylmonoglutamic</b> <b>acid)</b> intake and red cell folate level in those with a low folate status and occurrence of an adenomatous polyp (p = 0. 0039). These findings point to a role for folate in the pathoaetiology of adenomatous polyps, with the natural and synthetic vitamers not necessarily having the same biological effect...|$|E
40|$|These {{studies were}} {{designed}} to determine whether <b>pteroylmonoglutamic</b> <b>acid</b> (PGA) at physiologic concentrations is transported across the small intestine unaltered or is reduced and methylated to the circulating folate form (5 -methyltetrahydrofolate [5 -MeFH 4]) during absorption. [3 H]PGA was incubated in vitro on the mucosal side of rat jejunum. Of the folate transferred to the serosal side, the percent identified as 5 -MeFH 4 by DEAE-Sephadex chromtography was inversely related to the initial mucosa PGA concentration: at 7, 20, and 2, 000 nM, 44 %, 34 %, and 2 %, respectively, was converted to 5 -MeFH 4. In contrast, less than 4 % of the folate transferred across ileal mucosa was 5 -MeFH 4 when the initial mucosa concentration was 20 nM. Specific activity of dihydrofolate (DHF) reductase, the enzyme responsible for converting PGA to tetrahydrofolic acid, was measured in villus homogenates and was significantly greater in the jejunum than in the ileum. 1, 000 nM methotrexate (MTX), a DHF reductase inhibitor, markedly inhibited PGA conversion to 5 -MeFH 4 by the jejunum...|$|E
40|$|Folates {{represent}} an essential nutrition com-ponent involved in many metabolic pathways, mainly in carbon transfer reactions such as purine and pyrimidine biosynthesis and amino acid in-terconversion.

40|$|Purpose: The {{initiation}} of mandatory folic acid fortification using <b>pteroylmonoglutamic</b> <b>acid</b> (PteGlu) {{has reduced the}} rate of congenital malformations. However, it {{also appears to be}} responsible for several adverse effects, including increased cancer incidence. This may be related to physicho-chemical characteristics of PteGlu. This study examines the potential effect of high concentrations of PteGlu on a population subjected to mandatory folic acid fortification using an in vitro model. Methods: Caco- 2 (colorectal cancer) and MCF 7 (breast cancer) cell lines were cultured at 6 different PteGlu concentrations (0, 0. 1, 1, 50, 250, and 500 µg/ml) for 6 days. Cell growth was determined using thiazolyl blue tetrazolium bromide assay. The genotype of dihydrofolate reductase 19 bp deletion/insertion (DHFR 19 -del) was also scored in cell lines using a restriction fragment length polymorphism technique to examine whether genetic variations may factor in cell proliferation. Results: PteGlu exhibited differential growth promoting properties between cell lines. Caco- 2 cells did not show a significant growth difference at low concentrations compared to control, however, at higher concentrations, the growth showed a contrasting trend in the early experimental period, while MCF 7 showed enhanced cell growth at all concentrations. The DHFR 19 -del genotype differed in the two cell lines. Conclusions: Altered response to PteGlu by Caco- 2 and MCF 7 may reflect a tissue specific disease aetiology or genotype specific differential enzyme activity, for example by DHFR, to critical levels of PteGlu. As folic acid fortification is a blanket intervention, and DHFR and other enzyme activities vary between individuals, PteGlu intake may have an as yet undefined effect on health. These findings may be relevant when considering mandatory folic acid fortification for disease prevention...|$|E
40|$|INTRODUCTION Nutritional and {{isotopic tracer}} studies with both animals and {{micro-organisms}} {{have shown that}} vitamin B 12 and folic acid are concerned in the biosynthesis of methionine from homocysteine {{and a source of}} C 1 -units (e. g. serine or formaldehyde). Using washed suspensions of E. coli serine {{has been found to be}} the moat important C 1 -donor and requirements for p-aminobenzoic acid and cobalamin were also demonstrated with the corresponding auxotrophic strains. Soluble extracts of acetone-dried E. coli PA 15 (a serine or glycine requiring strain) catalysed the formation of methionine from serine and homocysteine when an extract of the heated organism (EHC) served as the source of folic acid cofactor; no requirement for cobalamin was observed. However replacement of the SHC by tetrahydropteroylglutamic acid (PtH 4 G) was not possible unless the enzymic extract was prepared from acetone-dried powders of organisms which had first been grown in the presence of added cobalamin. A heat-labile, non-diffusible factor (X) was partially-purified from the extract of cobalamin-grown organisms and this factor (X) wee essential for the utilisation of PtH 4 G as a cofactor for the synthesis of methionine by extracts of acetone-dried organisms grown without added cobalamin. The synthesis of methionine by ultrasonic extracts of E. coli 121 / 176 (a cobalamin or methionine requiring strain, grown with methionine} was on the other hand dependent upon the presence of cobalamin in the reaction mixture with either EHO or PtH 4 G as the cofactor for C 1 -transfer. The object of this work was to investigate further the complexities of the methylation of homocysteine by ultrasonic extracts of Escherichia coli with particular regard to the functions of folic acid and cobalamin. EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS Section I: The Synthesis of Methionine by Ultrasonic extracts of Escherichia coli A preliminary survey of methionine formation by extracts of several strains of E. coli was made using three test systems: (I) serine as the C 1 -donor and EHC as the source of the folic acid cofactor, (II) serine as C 1 -donor and PtH 4 G as the cofactor for C 1 -transfer and (III) the formaldehyde derivative of PtH 4 G (CH 2 O-PtH 4 G) as both the donor and cofactor for the transfer of C 1 -units. Cobalamin was necessary for optimal synthesis of methionine under all conditions when extracts of cobalamin or methionine requiring strains (E. coli 121 / 126, 113 / 3) were used. With strains having no nutritional requirement for cobalamin or methionine (E. coli PA 15, W, 518) cobalamin was essential under conditions II and III i. e. only with PtH 4 G or CH 2 O-PtH 4 G present. Quantitatively the requirement for cobalamin was similar for all cobalamin-dependent eruditions with extracts of strain PA 15 and 121 / 176. Cobalamin could be replaced by several of its nucleotide-substiuted analogues but not by derivatives lacking the nucleotide residue. Hone of these compounds was significantly more active than cobalamin itself though 5, 6 -dimethylbenzimidazolylcobamide coenzyme was 2 to 3 times wore active than cobalamin for promoting the synthesis of methionine. Growth in the presence of cobalamin enhanced the ability to form methionine of ultrasonic extracts of strain 121 / 176 and PA 15 and the requirement for cobalamin in the reaction mixture (strain 121 / 176, system I and II; strain PA 15, system II) was eliminated if sufficiently high concentrations were present in the growth medium. In addition to the inability of PtH 4 G to replace EHC in the absence of cobalamin (strain PA 15), PtH 4 G also inhibited methionine synthesis when EHC supplied the cofactor for C 1 -transfer. This inhibition was overcome by cobalamin which also permits the PtH 4 G to function as a cofactor. The synthesis of methionine by ultrasonic extracts of E. coli PA 15 was proportional to the amount of extract present. Optimal synthesis occurred at 37 Â° in phosphate buffer with an initial pH of 7. 6 to 7. 8 under anaerobic conditions. Glucose, DPN, ATP and Mg 2 + were also essential for optimal methionine formation although glucose and DPN could be replaced by DPNH 2. S-adenosyl- L -homocysteine replaced homocysteine but ATP was still required. Serine and CH 2 O-PtH 4 G were the most active C 1 -donors and with the former a requirement for pyridoxal phosphate was demonstrated. This was presumably for the intermediate functioning of serine transhydroxymethylase in methionine synthesis. More direct evidence for the presence of this enzyme in ultrasonic extracts was also obtained. Growth of organisms in the presence of increasing concentrations of methionine progressively repressed their ability to form methionine in cell-free extracts. Section II: The Function of Cobalamin in the Synthesis of Methionine Inhibitory analogues of cobalamin Under conditions where cobalamin was essential for the synthesis of methionine (strain 121 / 176, systems I, II & III; strain PAl 5, systems II & III) its action was inhibited by the methylamide, ethylamide and anilide of the mono-carboxylic acids of cobalamin and by Factor B. Furthermore the anilide analogue inhibited competitively both the action of cobalamin and the cobamide coenzyme but was leas effective against the latter. The anilide analogue did not inhibit the growth of prototrophic strains of E. coli and only inhibited the growth of cobalamin or methionine requiring auxotrophs when cobalamin was the growth factor. If extracts were prepared from organisms (strain PA 15) which were first grown in the presence of cobalamin, the anilide analogue inhibited methionine formation only if it was added to the growth medium together with cobalamin. The synthesis of factor (X) by ultrasonic extracts A comparison of the different activities of ultrasonic extracts and extracts of acetone-dried E. coli PA 15 suggested that in the presence of cobalamin the ultrasonic extract was capable of effecting the formation (in vitro) of the factor (X) which had previously been purified from cobalamin-grown organisms and was required for the utilisation of PtH 4 O as a cofactor for the synthesis of methionine by extracts of acetone-dried organisms (Kisliuk & Woods). This system for the formation of X was presumably destroyed by treatment with acetone. A method using protamine sulphate was devised for the isolation of factor (X) from the products of incubating ultrasonic extracts of E. coli PA 15 with cobalamin and the material was assayed by its ability to promote the synthesis of methionine by extracts of acetone-dried organisms incapable of utilising PtH 4 G as a cofactor. The isolated factor (X) was heat-labile, non-diffusible, unstable in acidic and alkaline environments end resembled closely the material defined by Kisliuk and Woods. The mono-substituted cobalamin-amide analogues inhibited the formation of X by ultrasonic extracts but had no effect on its function in methionine synthesis. Factor B however inhibited both the formation and function of X. A more convenient method for assaying the formation of X was developed using the anilide analogue of cobalamin. Cobalamin, glucose, DPN, ATP and Mg 2 + were necessary for the optimal formation of X through DPNH 2 would replace glucose and DPN; the requirements for X formation were unchanged if cobalamin was replaced by the cobamide coenzyme. The preparation of X formed with the cobamide coenzyme had the same properties as that formed with cobalamin by strain PA 15. The material formed by incubating eobalmrin with ultrasonic extracts of the cobalamin auxotroph E. coli 121 / 176 also had similar properties. Section III: The Function of Folic Acid in the Synthesis of Methionine Pteroylmonoglutamic acids Several reduced <b>pteroylmonoglutamic</b> <b>acid</b> derivatives were active as C 1 -donors and cofactors tot the synthesis of methionine but as with PtH 4 G cobalamin was an essential component of the reaction mixture. The same reduced pteroylmonoglutamic acids, also like PtH 4 G, inhibited the synthesis of methionine in the absence of cobalamin when EHC supplied the folic acid cofactor (strain PA 15). The presence of an aminopterin-sensitive dihydropteroylglutamic acid reductase in ultrasonic extracts of E. coli PA 15 was demonstrated. The cofactor activity of dihydropteroylglutamic acid (PtH 2 G) in methionine synthesis was inhibited by aminopterin and amethopterin whereas the activity of PtH 4 G and EHC were unaffected by these anti-metabolites. This suggested that the activity of PtH 2 G depends on its conversion to PtH 4 G. Furthermore, aminopterin and amethopterin prevented the inhibitory effect of PtH 2 G, but not of PtH 4 G, on methionine formation in the absence of added cobalamin (EHC present, strain PA 15). Even in the presence of concentrations of aminopterin which completely inhibited the function of dihydropteroylglutamic acid reductase, PtH 4 G behaved as a catalyst for the formation of methionine. This suggests that PtH 4 G does not serve as the final reductant for methionine methyl group formation (by its conversion to PtH 2 G) a mechanism which has been postulated far the synthesis of the methyl groups of thymidylic acid. Conjugated forms of folic acid Several derivatives of tetrahydropteroyltriglutamic acid (PtH 4 G 3) resembled EHC in their ability to serve as cofactors for the synthesis of methionine by enzymic extracts of E. coli PA 15 in the absence of added cobalamin. with ultrasonic extracts of E. coli 121 / 176 cobalamin was however still required when PtH 4 G 3 was used as the cofactor for C 1 -transfer. From a consideration of stability and the cofactor activity per molecule of folic acid, one of the conjugated folic acids, N 5 -formyl PtH 4 G 3, qualified as a possible active component of the EHC. PtH 4 G inhibited the cofactor activity of the derivatives of PtH 4 G 3 in the same manner as it inhibited the activity of EHC (strain PA 15). Finally the active folic acid components of the EHC were fractionated by chromatography on triethylaminoethylcellulose and one component was tentatively identified as N 6 -formyl PtH 4 G 3 by comparing its cofactor activity, microbiological growth factor activity and its chromatographic behaviour with a sample of synthetic N 5 -formyl PtH 4 G 3. DISCUSSION The most satisfactory explanation of the results so far obtained is the postulation of two mechanisms for the synthesis of methionine in Escherichia coli, one being completely dependent upon the presence of cobalamin and the other being less dependent or independent of the metabolism of cobalamin. It is suggested that the second pathway is blocked in cobalamin-requiring auxotrophs whereas other strains can use both pathways. Unlike most other C 1 -transfer reactions, PtH 4 G does not serve as a folic acid cofactor for the synthesis of methionine (unless cobalamin was present). Furthermore PtH 4 G appeared to he an inhibitory analogue of the natural folic acid cofactors of the EHC and of PtH 4 G 3 and its derivatives. Nevertheless PtH 4 G was an active cofactor for methionine formation in the presence of cobalamin, presumably by the mechanism normally operating in the cobalamin auxotrophs. It would seem that the mechanism of C 1 -transfer in the formation of methionine is more complex than other C 1 -transfer reactions which have been examined; no specific requirement for either a conjugated folic acid cofactor or the added participation of cobalamin has previously been described. It seems certain that the function of cobalamin is mediated by a protein-like factor (X) which may contain cobalamin or a cobamide coenzyme. The exact function of cobalamin was not defined; it may however participate in either the transference of C 1 -units or their reduction. No other intermediates of methionine formation were isolated and it would appear that further elucidation of the mechanism of this reaction will depend on the fractionation of the enzymic extracts of several strains of Escherichia coli. </p...|$|E
