50|$|Public Administration {{theory is}} derived from several {{contemporary}} theory building tools such as Max Weber's Ideal type method. Theories are also derived from studies of evolving governments around the world, such as China's expanding bureaucracy. Different aspects {{to take into account}} are: accountability, state-citizen relations, and services for all in times of fiscal scarcity. When developing theories, the most effective theories are the ones tailored for a particular country taking aspects such as values into account. When empirical evidence is the only aspect taken into account it leads to an ineffective policy because the theory will not reflect the values of the citizens, resulting in bad citizen- state relationships. The Theory-Gap Practice is used to analyze the correlations between Public Administration theory and practice. The three fields of the theory gap-practice that describe the relationship between scholars and practitioners are: <b>Parallel,</b> <b>Transfer,</b> and Collaboration strategy.|$|E

[...] Notable Public Administration Theorist such as Max Weber expressed the importance of values in the development of public administration theory. However, theory cannot simply be derived from empirical observation of facts, it must be constructed using value judgements that direct our empirical observations and then guide out interpretation of those observations. Values are essential for the construction of public administration theories because it takes into account the meaningful ethical principles and philosophies of a culture which ensure appropriate theory practice. Public Administration theories are put into practice or considered through a few distinct strategies: <b>Parallel,</b> <b>Transfer,</b> or Collaboration also known as the theory-gap practice.

50|$|Also {{available}} for the Commodore 64 was the Creative Micro Designs CMD HD-Series. Much like the Commodore 1541 floppy drive, the CMD HD could connect to the Commodore 64's serial bus, and could operate independently of the computer {{with the help of}} its on-board hardware. A CMD HD series drive included its own SCSI controller to operate its hard drive mechanism, in addition to hosting a battery powered real-time clock module for the time-stamping of files. The stock operating speeds of the CMD HD-Series units were not very much faster than the stock speeds of a 1541 floppy drive, but the units were fully JiffyDOS compatible. Faster parallel transfers were possible with the addition of another CMD product, the CMD RAMLink and a special <b>parallel</b> <b>transfer</b> cable. With this arrangement, the performance of the system doubled that of the Lt. Kernal. One advantage the CMD products had was software compatibility, especially with GEOS, that prior solutions lacked. CMD ultimately missed opportunities to develop any features for the drive's auxiliary port (such as a printer spooler feature promised in the CMD HD user manual). Support for external SCSI devices (such as CD-ROM and Zip drives) was also noticeably missing. SCSI devices could be connected and chained to the external SCSI port, but could not be used from the HD without workarounds or special software.|$|E
50|$|At the {{physical}} layer, DSI specifies a high-speed differential signaling point-to-point serial bus. This bus includes one high speed clock lane {{and one or}} more data lanes. Each lane is carried on two wires (due to differential signaling). All lanes travel from the DSI host to the DSI device, except for the first data lane (lane 0), which is capable of a bus turnaround (BTA) operation that allows it to reverse transmission direction. When more than one lane is used, they are used in parallel to transmit data, with each sequential byte in the stream traveling on the next lane. That is, if 4 lanes are being used, 4 bits are transmitted simultaneously, one on each lane. The link operates in either low power (LP) mode or high speed (HS) mode. In low power mode, the high speed clock is disabled and signal clocking information {{is embedded in the}} data. In this mode, the data rate is insufficient to drive a display, but is usable for sending configuration information and commands. High speed mode enables the high speed clock (at frequencies from tens of megahertz to over one gigahertz) that acts as the bit clock for the data lanes. Clock speeds vary by the requirements of the display. High speed mode is still designed to reduce power usage due to its low voltage signaling and <b>parallel</b> <b>transfer</b> ability.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Many {{of the key}} {{features}} of file transfer mechanisms like reliable file <b>transferring</b> and <b>parallel</b> <b>transferring</b> are developed {{as part of the}} service. It makes very hard to re-use the same code for the different systems. We are trying to overcome this disadvantage by decoupling useful features of file transfer mechanisms from the implementation of the service and protocol, and instead placed into the messaging substrate. We may thus treat file transfer operations as a specific usage case for a more general messaging environment. This will allow us to provide file transfer quality of service to other file transfer tools that does not have same features. ...|$|R
