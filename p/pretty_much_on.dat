The New York Times reviewed it favorably: although in their description the book was [...] "constructed along utterly anarchistic lines, with each episode and anecdote left <b>pretty</b> <b>much</b> <b>on</b> its own", they asserted that [...] "It also has the flavor of life in it, and it is marked by an exhilarating revolt against the custom of arranging catastrophes and triumphs under neat chapter headings".|$|E

Entertainment Weekly gave the episode a C, writing, [...] "Aside from a well-executed invisible-elephant rampage, this one's <b>pretty</b> <b>much</b> <b>on</b> automatic pilot". Zack Handlen of The A.V. Club also graded it as a C, calling it [...] "forgettable, and under-baked; [...] not terrible {{enough to be}} a complete failure, but forgettable enough". John Keegan from Critical Myth gave the episode a moderately negative review and awarded it a 4 out of 10. He wrote, [...] "Overall, this episode felt more like a statement by the writer regarding animal rights than an episode of [...] The plot doesn’t seem to know which direction it wants to explore, and ultimately, elements of the episode contradict each other." [...] Robert Shearman and Lars Pearson, in their book Wanting to Believe: A Critical Guide to The X-Files, Millennium & The Lone Gunmen, rated the episode two stars out of five. The two wrote that, despite the episode having [...] "rare anger" [...] and a [...] "genuine passion behind" [...] its conservation message, the entry was not [...] "a very good story". Shearman and Pearson called the plot [...] "so confusing that all that impact [...] soon dissipates." [...] The plot for [...] "Fearful Symmetry" [...] was also adapted as a novel for young adults in 1996 by Les Martin, under the title Tiger, Tiger.|$|E

The United States had pressured Pakistan for a military operation in North Waziristan for years, and the US Congress linked military assistance to Pakistan for the next fiscal year with military operations in North Waziristan in June 2014. Rear Adm. John Kirby, the Pentagon press secretary, said that the Pentagon was unaware of Pakistan's decision to launch a new offensive in North Waziristan: [...] "The Pakistan military and the government understand the threat, and they continue to go after that threat." [...] On 5 November 2014, Lt. Gen. Joseph Anderson, a senior commander for US and Nato forces in Afghanistan, said in a Pentagon-hosted video briefing from Afghanistan that the Haqqani network is now [...] "fractured" [...] like the Taliban. [...] "They are fractured. They are fractured like the Taliban is. That's based <b>pretty</b> <b>much</b> <b>on</b> the Pakistan's operations in North Waziristan this entire summer-fall," [...] he said, acknowledging the effectiveness of Pakistan's military offensive. [...] "That has very much disrupted their efforts in Afghanistan and has caused them to be less effective in terms of their ability to pull off an attack in Kabul," [...] Anderson added.|$|E

2500|$|Hunting {{and trading}} in Tarsius syrichta, the species {{found in the}} Philippines, was banned in the mid-1990s, when Pizarras flew to Manila with two {{orphaned}} tarsier babies to meet Prince Charles, {{who was in the}} country, and enlisted the heir to the British throne's support to help save the species. In the wild, the territorial males attract four or five females who mate only during the full moon after a week of courtship. Each gives birth to a single young after a six-month pregnancy. The young tarsiers are <b>pretty</b> <b>much</b> <b>on</b> their own after six months. [...] Raising tarsiers as pets is a cruel sport, said Pizarras, who insists the stressed-out animals actually commit suicide or otherwise will themselves to die inside their cages. They would smash their head on the bars in a bid to escape until they crack their skulls. He also insists the animal had the capacity to simply stop breathing (a more debatable proposition).|$|E
2500|$|Rampal's first {{release of}} 2005 was Satish Kaushik's Vaada, {{in which he}} played a lead role {{opposite}} Ameesha Patel and Zayed Khan. The film was a flop. Patcy N of Rediff praised Rampal, writing: [...] "Arjun Rampal {{has done a good}} job; his is a subdued performance, and the model-turned-actor looks great in most scenes." [...] Rampal's next release was Vikram Bhatt's multi-starrer action film Elaan. The film managed to do well and became an average-grosser at the box office. Rampal earned critical acclaim for his performance in Elaan. Subhash K. Jha of IANS praised Rampal and wrote: [...] "Arjun is <b>pretty</b> <b>much</b> <b>on</b> his own. Once again playing a man with responsibilities he brings a controlled conviction to both his scenes with his screen daughter and his engrossing death scene."
