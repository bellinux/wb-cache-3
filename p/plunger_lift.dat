40|$|Methane {{emissions}} from liquid unloadings were measured at 107 wells in natural gas production regions throughout the United States. Liquid unloadings clear wells of accumulated liquids to increase production, employing {{a variety of}} liquid lifting mechanisms. In this work, wells with and without <b>plunger</b> <b>lifts</b> were sampled. Most wells without <b>plunger</b> <b>lifts</b> unload less than 10 times per year with emissions averaging 21 [*] 000 – 35 [*] 000 scf methane (0. 4 – 0. 7 Mg) per event (95 % confidence limits of 10 [*] 000 – 50 [*] 000 scf/event). For wells with <b>plunger</b> <b>lifts,</b> emissions averaged 1000 – 10 [*] 000 scf methane (0. 02 – 0. 2 Mg) per event (95 % confidence limits of 500 – 12 [*] 000 scf/event). Some wells with <b>plunger</b> <b>lifts</b> are automatically triggered and unload thousands of times per year and these wells account {{for the majority of}} the {{emissions from}} all wells with liquid unloadings. If the data collected in this work are assumed to be representative of national populations, the data suggest that the central estimate of emissions from unloadings (270 Gg/yr, 95 % confidence range of 190 – 400 Gg) are within a few percent of the emissions estimated in the EPA 2012 Greenhouse Gas National Emission Inventory (released in 2014), with emissions dominated by wells with high frequencies of unloadings...|$|R

5000|$|As {{the slide}} of the pistol enters battery, the striker engages the sear. At this point, the sear is held {{back in a}} {{partially}} cocked condition. When the trigger of the M&P is pulled, the trigger bar first engages the firing pin safety <b>plunger,</b> <b>lifting</b> it upward, and releasing firing pin safety.

The striker makes contact with the primer of the chambered round, which in turn ignites the gunpowder and propels the bullet forward. According to renowned M&P gunsmith Dan Burwell, the angle on the rear face of the sear creates a camming action against the striker.

40|$|The {{problem of}} liquid loading {{is common for}} all gas {{producing}} wells and should be identified and solved for efficient gas production. Production engineers and operators need to choose the best solution possible, one that is cost effective and also efficient in doing the job. The <b>plunger</b> <b>lift</b> operation is a cost-effective solution to this liquid loading problem and also is efficient in increasing the gas production. However, the current understanding of <b>plunger</b> <b>lift</b> operation has used field experience and some previous models that have restrictive assumptions which might not be applicable for all <b>plunger</b> <b>lift</b> installations. This research proposes a new <b>plunger</b> <b>lift</b> model that overcomes some of the limiting assumptions of earlier models by using additional data available {{in the form of}} pressure and temperature from new technology like smart plunger. The model is based on fundamental principles of mass conservation and pressure balance, and uses the smart plunger data as input.

The model predicts the plunger velocity, plunger position and annulus liquid level during an upward travel of the plunger in an onshore gas well in East Texas. The results of model implementation in VBA show the importance of fluid properties for the model, apart from indicating that the model is optimized for the given set of input data.

From the very beginning of operation (from 1972) the main part of gas is produced from wells equipped with 65 / 8 ″ production tubing. In a number of wells due to decreased gas flow rate in production tubings the formation water and condensation water are accumulated which sharply decreases the well’s production rate; the wells operation is also complicated due to water accumulation in the borehole at gas velocities in the production tubing insufficient for lifting water to the wellhead, which results in the rock wetting and destruction of the producing formation, bottomhole sand production with a possible formation of a lengthy sand plug at the well’s bottomhole.

With the reciprocating plunger, logging instruments canister can be carried and deployed to the bottom of a gas well to carry out logging and sampling tasks on the production demand of a field. After the deployment and logging tasks are performed, logging instruments canister is carried back to the surface by the plunger and then data is transferred to the wellhead device near field wireless communication technology. This newly developed <b>plunger</b> <b>lift</b> system comprises plunger body, deployment sub-assembly, retrieve sub-assembly and logging instruments canister.

40|$|Liquid loading is {{a serious}} problem in gas wells. Many proven {{artificial}} lift methods have been used to alleviate this problem. However, a complete workflow to determine the most suitable artificial lift method for given well conditions does not exist. In 2008, Han Young Park presented his thesis of decision matrix tool using a decision tree technique for data mining that determined the best artificial lift method for liquid loading in gas wells from seven artificial lift methods: <b>plunger</b> <b>lift,</b> gas lift, ESP, PCP, rod pump, jet pump, and piston pump. He determined the technical feasibility and the cost evaluation of these seven techniques. His workflow consisted of three rounds. The first round was the preliminary screening round. By using all input well conditions, the impractical techniques were screened out. In the second round, all the techniques from round one were graded and ranked. In the third round, the economic evaluation was performed by using cost for each artificial lift method and assuming the constant additional gas production per day to determine net present value (NPV) and internal rate of return (IRR). In this thesis, we propose an extended workflow from the Han-Young?s thesis for the decision matrix tool. We added integrated production simulations (reservoir to wellhead) step with commercial software in between the second and third round. We performed simulations of the various artificial lift methods to see the additional gains from each technique. We used the additional gas production resulted from simulation to calculate economic yardsticks (the third round), NPV and IRR.

Please report any quality issues you encounter to digital@library. tamu. edu, referencing the URI of the item. Includes bibliographical references (leaves 55 - 57). Issued also on microfiche from Lange Micrographics. Liquid loading in low production gas wells is a common problem faced in many producing regions around the world. Once gas rates fall below the minimum lift velocity, it is essential that some action be taken to maintain continuous operation of the well. Commonly applied solutions include: 1) reduction in wellhead pressure (compression); 2) reduction of tubing diameter (velocity strings); and 3) installation of artificial lift (<b>plunger</b> <b>lift</b> or sucker rod pumping). This thesis examines the use of a patented vortex flow modifier to lift liquids from low rate (stripper) gas wells. Vortex Flow LLC has developed a flow modifying tool using the patented EcoVeyor technology developed by EcoTech. This technology has been used successfully for almost a decade to transport solids in the coal and potash industries and is now being adapted to the oil and gas industries. Recent field tests in horizontal production pipelines have shown the ability to alter basic flow characteristics, significantly decreasing backpressure on wells and increasing production. This thesis evaluates this technology for use in the wellbore, where a tool is introduced {{at the bottom of the}} tubing string. Laboratory experiments were conducted using a 125 -ft vertical flow loop of 2 -in diameter clear PVC. In these experiments, the effects of the vortex device on gas and water flow was examined and compared with the behavior in normal pipe flow. An optimized tool was developed that alters the flow patterns in the pipe resulting in improved liquid unloading accompanied by a decrease in the tubing pressure loss by more than 15 percent. The optimized tool also lowered the minimum lift velocity required for liquid unloading. Visual observations at four locations along the test loop confirmed that the liquid phase is transported in an upward helical manner along the pipe wall, providing an improved flow path for the gas phase. Apart from assisting liquid unloading, the flow modifying tool enhances the operational envelope at low gas rates as well as forming smaller slugs during liquid unloading. Therefore the flow modifier can also reduce gas requirements during artificial gas lift and can also serve as a flow stabilizing device...|$|E
