25|$|The <b>Varela</b> <b>Project</b> (Proyecto <b>Varela</b> in Spanish) is {{a project}} that was started in 1998 by Oswaldo Payá of the Christian Liberation Movement (CLM) and named after Felix Varela, a Cuban {{religious}} leader.|$|R
2500|$|The <b>Varela</b> <b>Project</b> {{movement}} enjoyed broad based {{support among}} expatriate Cuban-Americans and the United States Government. [...] Also, {{some of the}} <b>Varela</b> <b>Project</b> leaders were accused by the Cuban government of accepting foreign political support from James Cason of the United States State Department for political purposes, which {{is against the law}} in Cuba. The dissidents deny the charges. In March 2003, the Cuban government arrested approximately 75 dissenters, who were tried and convicted of accepting funds from foreign sources for political purposes, and approximately one half of these arrested persons were associated with the <b>Varela</b> <b>Project</b> movement. [...] This was met with widespread criticism internationally, and was perceived as a crackdown. Although the project was officially legally rejected on November 2002, the same <b>Varela</b> <b>Project</b> was brought again to the National Assembly on October 2004. Its promoters claimed that the National Assembly had not responded to the <b>project.</b> The <b>Varela</b> <b>Project</b> was again re-launched in Madrid on October 2008.|$|R
5000|$|... #Subtitle level 2: Cuban government's {{response}} to the <b>Varela</b> <b>Project</b> ...|$|R
5000|$|The {{organization}} {{reported having}} collected 11,020 signatures, {{but neither the}} Constitution nor any complementary law authorizes a proposal of law by citizens without proving their right to vote. Article 88 of the Constitution does not refer to any signature, and the Article 64 of the Rules of the National Assembly clearly request as quantum of proof a notarized affidavit. Thus, the legal requisite for consideration by Cuban National Assembly is not a number at all, but {{the legal status of}} voter. The Cuban National Assembly's Constitution and Legal Affairs Committee did not suspend consideration of the <b>Varela</b> <b>Project</b> citizens' initiative, but responded to it with an expert opinion, dated on November 1, 2002, and forwarded to the promoters by courier on November 18 and by certified mail on November 26. This expert opinion dismissed the <b>Varela</b> <b>Project</b> because of formal and substantial grounds. Formally, the <b>Varela</b> <b>Project</b> did not prove the voter status of those who had provided their names, national identification numbers, addresses, and signatures. Also it wasn't presented as a proposal of law, but as a mix of allegations regarding legal issues that should be articulate as separate laws. Moreover, the <b>Varela</b> <b>Project</b> mixed up referendum and popular consultation, which are two different constitutional issues. The Cuban regime did not respond to the <b>Varela</b> <b>Project</b> with its own counter initiative, providing that the Cuban Constitution be amended to make permanent the socialist nature of the Cuban state. Such was the response to the U.S. President's speeches on May 20, 2002, and the foreign media broke the news that the huge mobilization — a typical resource of the Cuban regime against the U.S. — for irrevocable socialism was the response to the <b>Varela</b> <b>Project.</b> In fact, the response was limited since the very beginning to the expert opinion by the aforementioned Constitution and Legal Affairs Committee. [...] A BBC reporter noted that many Cubans said they felt pressured into signing the government's petition. [...] According to the United States State Department, [...] "activists reported increased harassment by State Security agents. Authorities arrested and detained Varela activists, confiscated signatures, fined and threatened activists and signers, and forced signers to rescind signatures. State Security impersonated canvassing volunteers and increasingly infiltrated the ranks of activists. In May and June, Oswaldo Paya reported State Security agents visited and pressured more than 50 <b>Varela</b> <b>Project</b> signatories to retract their signatures and denounce the <b>Varela</b> <b>Project</b> activists who had collected their signatures." ...|$|R

2500|$|The {{official}} {{response to}} the <b>Varela</b> <b>Project</b> was a dismissal by both formal and substantial grounds. The latter was argued in terms of unconstitutionality. There is no clue in the response to consider that the aspects of the <b>Varela</b> <b>Project</b> regarding the freedom to start a private business were seen by the Cuban government as the real purpose of the project. [...] Although the Cuban government has always claimed that the fundamental freedoms are already guaranteed to the Cuban people, its official respond to the <b>Varela</b> <b>Project</b> does not provide any clue either to affirm the such freedoms {{were included in the}} project's stated goals to divert attention from the privatization aspect of the project. The response simply dismissed the entire project as a disorderly way to amend the Cuban Constitution, which is not possible through mere proposal of laws.|$|R

2500|$|The <b>Varela</b> <b>Project</b> was {{announced}} as relying on Article #88(g) of the Cuban Constitution [...] of 1976, as amended in 1992, which allows citizens to propose laws if 10,000 who {{are entitled to}} vote support the proposal with a notarized affidavit that the <b>Varela</b> <b>Project's</b> promoters failed to bring together with the project itself. The simple collection, in any number, of names, national identification numbers, addresses, and signatures does not support any proposal of law {{in accord with the}} Cuban Constitution and its complementary legislation, which in this case is the Rules of the National Assembly (1996).|$|R

25|$|The {{purpose of}} the <b>Varela</b> <b>Project</b> was to {{circulate}} a proposal of law advocating for democratic political reforms within Cuba, such as the establishment of freedom of association, freedom of speech, freedom of the press, free elections, freedom of religion, freedom to start private businesses, and amnesty for political prisoners.|$|R
