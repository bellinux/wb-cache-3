Among the 104 victims studied by us, the high prevalence of Post Traumatic Stress Disorders correlates well with the incident of the torture of the victims. In some cases, the physical torture has been so severe that the victims have suffered permanent damage to their physical health as well. All this has naturally led to a great level of disability and incapacity to carry out day-to-day activities.

50|$|A {{sample that}} is not random is called a non-random sample or a non-probability sampling.

5000|$|Thus, one cannot say {{the same}} {{on the basis of}} a non{{probability}} sample than {{on the basis of a}} probability sample. The grounds for drawing generalizations (e.g., propose new theory, propose policy) from studies based on nonprobability samples are based on the notion of [...] "theoretical saturation" [...] and [...] "analytical generalization" [...] (Yin, 2014) instead of on statistical generalization. Researchers working with the notion of purposive sampling assert that while probability methods are suitable for large-scale studies concerned with representativeness, non-probability approaches are more suitable for in-depth qualitative research in which the focus is often to understand complex social phenomena (e.g., Marshall 1996; Small 2009). One of the advantages of nonprobability sampling is its lower cost compared to probability sampling. Moreover, the in-depth analysis of a small-N <b>purposive</b> <b>sample</b> or a case study enables the [...] "discovery" [...] and identification of patterns and causal mechanisms that do not draw time and context-free assumptions.|$|E
30|$|Given {{that the}} {{population}} is “abstract” (i.e., {{it was not possible}} to obtain a list of all members of the focal population), a non-probability (<b>purposive)</b> <b>sample</b> was obtained. In a <b>purposive</b> <b>sample,</b> participants are screened for inclusion based on criteria associated with members of the focal population. To achieve a convenience sample, an extensive list of employed and self-employed individuals’ names and telephone numbers was used to distribute surveys and to conduct telephone interviews. To create a list of telephone numbers and addresses, referrals from friends, relatives, family members, and religious places such as temples were used. In addition, telephone directories and the internet were used to collect business names, addresses and telephone numbers of research participants.|$|E
30|$|Because {{there are}} so many {{different}} types of SECs, our <b>purposive</b> <b>sample</b> is not representative of all SEC types. Nonetheless, this study offers specific insights as to the role of these SECs on their campuses, emphasizing functions common across sites. Our <b>purposive</b> <b>sample</b> was comprised of institutions that were looking to take advantage of a perceived niche area, STEM education. Each institution identified STEM education as an area of primary importance to their mission. Therefore, a STEM education center was aligned with their identity. Our sample did not include SECs with a strong focus in K- 12 outreach or K- 12 teacher preparation and thus does not capture features of these SECs and their significant contributions to STEM education, at their postsecondary institution.|$|E
30|$|The {{differentiation}} by Stake (1995, 2005) into intrinsic {{and instrumental}} cases guides the <b>purposive</b> <b>sampling</b> strategy.

40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{identify}} the challenges in adding a critical realist epistemological perspective to a positivist approach in research on listed companies by equity researchers and other financial services professionals. Design/methodology/approach – A <b>purposive</b> <b>sample</b> of publicly available equity research reports was examined to assess the dominant epistemological approach to investment analysis. Findings – It was found that there is an absence of a critical realist epistemological approach to investment analysis, confirming the dominance of a positivist approach to obtaining and analysing investment information. Research limitations/implications – This research drew on a small, <b>purposive</b> <b>sample,</b> and could be followed by more wide-scale research. Taking a critical realist approach may create a clash of "institutional logics" which will need to be considered by a range of stakeholders. Originality/value – Equity research reports are examined through the lens of critical realism. This exploration allows for an additional epistemological perspective on analysis of firm value. 20 page(s...|$|E
