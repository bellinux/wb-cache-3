She is inevitably grooming herself, combing her hair, and <b>peering</b> <b>at</b> {{herself in a}} mirror. Upon noticing the intruder, she flees {{into the water and}} leaves her possessions behind. The traveller then takes the invaluable items. Later, Mami Wata appears to the thief in his dreams to demand the return of her things. Should he agree, she further demands a promise from him to be sexually faithful to her. Agreement grants the person riches; refusal to return the possessions or to be faithful brings the man ill fortune.|$|E
2500|$|To his Nancy contemporaries, Bellange {{must have}} been known mainly as a painter, but no very useful {{descriptions}} of his work survive. He is recorded as painting a number of portraits, but none {{are known to have}} survived. A Beggar Looking Through His Hat in the Walters Art Museum, Baltimore, which they attribute to Bellange, was donated by the former Soviet spy Michael Straight (1931–2004): [...] "Given the secretive character of the man depicted, <b>peering</b> <b>at</b> us through a hole in his hat, the painting may have had a particular appeal for its previous owner", the museum suggests. It has been speculated that some of his prints are versions of his paintings, but there is no evidence for this, and the evidence of compositional changes made during the etching process in some prints goes against the theory.|$|E
2500|$|One of {{the first}} {{individuals}} to regularly depict witches after the witch-craze of the medieval period was Albrecht Dürer, a German Renaissance artist. His famous 1497 engraving [...] "The Four Witches", portrays four physically attractive and seductive nude witches. Their supernatural identities are emphasized by the skulls and bones lying at their feet {{as well as the}} devil discreetly <b>peering</b> <b>at</b> them from their left. The women's sensuous presentation speaks to the overtly sexual nature they were attached to in early modern Europe. Moreover, this attractiveness was perceived as a danger to ordinary men who they could seduce and tempt into their sinful world. Some scholars interpret this piece as utilizing the logic of the Canon Episcopi, in which women used their mental powers and bodily seduction to enslave and lead men onto a path of eternal damnation, differing from the unattractive depiction of witches that would follow in later Renaissance years.|$|E

2500|$|Rousseau wrote that, like {{several other}} recent works about homosexuality, Ruse's book was [...] "more {{socially}} rather than scientifically grounded" [...] and that Ruse was not [...] "willing (or equipped) {{to address the}} question about etiology." [...] He also wrote that too many of Ruse's positions are [...] "taken with AIDS <b>peering</b> <b>at</b> the reader in the face", and questioned both the extent of Ruse's compassion for homosexuals and the ability of philosophy to help homosexuals. He maintained that Ruse's conclusions [...] "neither advance the theoretical debate about homosexuality nor propose any practical solutions to the homosexual crisis." [...] While granting that Ruse's book [...] "abounds with information" [...] and had [...] "noble" [...] objectives, he argued that Ruse had an [...] "impoverished" [...] view of homosexuality that frustrated those objectives, and that Ruse neglected the role love and shame play in the lives of homosexuals. He wrote that while Ruse challenged the idea that homosexuality is a mental illness, he did so [...] "without acknowledging that these views had already been debated in the 1950s". He suggested that Ruse made comments about homosexuality that could be interpreted as expressing the desire to eliminate it, describing this as [...] "outrageous". He agreed with Ruse's conclusion {{that there should be no}} discrimination in favor of homosexuals, but nevertheless found Ruse's arguments for that conclusion offensive.|$|E
2500|$|Rowling {{revealed}} in Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince that young Merope Gaunt made {{efforts to get}} as close to Tom as she could, <b>peering</b> <b>at</b> him through the windows and bushes at every opportunity. Morfin noticed his sister's affection for Tom, and hexed him as he rode by, covering him in hives. This breach of wizarding law, and the ensuing violent struggle with Ministry of Magic officials, led to Marvolo and Morfin being imprisoned in Azkaban. As surmised by Dumbledore, once Merope was alone and no longer dominated by her father, she could make her move for Tom. She offered Tom a drink laced with a love potion as he rode by one day without his attractive companion, Cecilia. He became infatuated with Merope and they eloped. Within {{three months of the}} marriage, Merope became pregnant. Merope decided to stop giving Tom the love potion, having come to the belief such enchantment of a man was tantamount to slavery. She also revealed her witch status to Tom, believing either that he {{had fallen in love with}} her on his own or he would at least stay for their unborn child. She was wrong, and Tom quickly left his pregnant wife and went home to his parents, claiming to have been [...] "hoodwinked" [...] and tricked into marrying Merope. Tom Marvolo Riddle, their son, was born on 31 December 1926 and was left to grow up in an orphanage, as Merope had died soon after giving birth.|$|E
