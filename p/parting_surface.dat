Dimensional tolerances should not be closer than necessaryThe dimensional tolerances of a steel part produced using the impression-die forging method are outlined in the table below. It should be noted that the dimensions across the paring plane are affected by the closure of the dies, and are therefore dependent die wear and the thickness of the final flash. Dimensions that are completely contained within a single die segment or half can be maintained at a significantly greater level of accuracy.A lubricant is always used when forging to reduce friction and wear. It is also used to as a thermal barrier to restrict heat transfer from the workpiece to the die. Finally the lubricant acts as a parting compound to prevent the part from sticking in one of the dies.|$|E

50|$|Flash, {{also known}} as flashing, is excess {{material}} attached to a molded, forged, or cast product, which must usually be removed.

40|$|Injection molding {{is widely}} used to {{manufacture}} plastic parts with good surface finish, dimensional stability and low cost. The common examples of parts manufactured by injection molding include toys, utensils, and casings of various electronic products. The process of mold design to generate these complex shapes is iterative and time consuming, and requires great expertise in the field. As a result, {{a significant amount of}} the final product cost {{can be attributed to the}} expenses incurred during the product’s design. After designing the mold segments, it is necessary to machine these segments with minimum cost using an efficient tool-path. The tool-path planning process also adds to the overall mold cost. The process of injection molding can be simplified and made to be more cost effective if the processes of mold design and tool-path generation can be automated. This work focuses on the automation of mold design from a given part design and the automation of tool-path generation for manufacturing mold segments. The hypothesis examined in this thesis is that the automatic identification of mold features can reduce the human efforts required to design molds. It is further hypothesised that the human effort required in many downstream processes such as mold component machining can also be reduced with algorithmic automation of otherwise time consuming decisions. Automatic design of dies and molds begins with the part design being provided as a solid model. The solid model of a part is a database of its geometry and topology. The automatic mold design process uses this database to identify an undercut-free parting direction, for recognition of mold features and identification of parting lines for a given parting direction, and for generation of entities such as <b>parting</b> <b>surfaces,</b> core, cavity and side-cores. The methods presented in this work are analytical in nature and work with the extended set of part topologies and geometries unlike those found in the literature. Moreover, the methods do not require discretizing the part geometry to design its mold segments, unlike those found in the literature that result in losing the part definition. Once the mold features are recognized and parting lines are defined, core, cavity and side-cores are generated. This work presents algorithms that recognize the entities in the part solid model that contribute to the design of the core, cavity and side-cores, extract the entities, and use them in the design of these elements. The developed algorithms are demonstrated on a variety of parts that cover a wide range of features. The work also presents a method for automatic tool-path generation that takes the designed core/cavity and produces a multi-stage tool-path to machine it from raw stock. The tool-path generation process begins by determining tool-path profiles and tool positions for the rough machining of the part in layers. Typically roughing is done with large aggressive tools to reduce the machining time; and roughing leaves uncut material. After generating a roughing tool-path for each layer, the machining is simulated and the areas left uncut are identified to generate a clean-up tool-path for smaller sized tools. The tool-path planning is demonstrated using a part having obstacles within the machining region. The simulated machining is presented in this work. This work extends the accessibility analysis by retaining the topology information and using it to recognize a larger domain of features including intersecting features, filling a void in the literature regarding a method that could recognize complex intersecting features during an automated mold design process. Using this information, a larger variety of new mold intersecting features are classified and recognized in this approach. The second major contribution of the work was to demonstrate that the downstream operations can also benefit from algorithmic decision making. This is shown by automatically generating roughing and clean-up tool-paths, while reducing the machining time by machining only those areas that have uncut material. The algorithm can handle cavities with obstacles in them. The methodology has been tested on a number of parts...|$|R

40|$|When {{an object}} is made using Laminated Manufacturing (LM), the output is a {{rectangular}} block with the required object trapped inside. In order to enable extraction of the object, the remaining sheet {{in each layer}} is cut into square grids that grow into tiny tiles. Thus, the remaining stock inside and surrounding the object {{is in the form}} of tiled fragments. The operator 'decubes' or removes these tiles using sharp tools and extracts the object. Making use of the remaining stock as support structure and grid cutting to enable extraction of the object are very innovative ideas in the 'paste-and-cut' LM approach. However, this method is very inefficient for two reasons: firstly, cutting efficiency is poor since laser spends most of its time in grid cutting; secondly, decubing takes several hours. In this paper, an efficient method of cutting the remaining stock to extract the object is presented. Extraction of the object from the stock block has analogy with the extraction of casting from its mold-the present and proposed methods respectively being analogous to sand casting and permanent mold casting processes. In the proposed method, rather than fragmenting the remaining stock into tiny tiles, it is segmented into two stock halves that open about a <b>parting</b> <b>surface</b> of minimum area. This optimal <b>parting</b> <b>surface</b> is obtained for the convex hull of the object, rather than for the object itself, due to its complete visibility along any pair opposite directions. The convex hull is further segmented into the object and plugs. The plugs are so shaped that they do not get entangled inside the concave portions of the object. The plugs whose drawing directions coincide with the opening direction of the stock halves are merged with the corresponding stock halves. The object, all the plugs and both the stock halves form the stock block. All these pieces are made together in the LM machine. For disassembly, first the convex hull will be extracted by opening the stock halves. Subsequently the plugs that fill the concave portions of the object will be extracted from the convex hull. Thus, grid cutting and decubing are eliminated in the proposed method resulting in drastic reduction in prototyping time and improved quality of the prototype. (C) 2002. ...|$|E

We describe an efficient algorithm for solving the opposite direction moldability problem for a 2 D “polygon” bounded by edges that may be either straight or curved. We introduce a structure, the normal graph of the polygon, that represents the range of normals of the polygon’s edges, along with their connectivity. We prove that the normal graph captures the directions of all lines corresponding to feasible parting directions. Rather than building the full normal graph, which could take time O(nlogn) for a polygon bounded by n possibly curved edges, we build a summary structure in O(n) time and space, from which we can determine all feasible parting directions in time O(n). 1 Background and Previous Work In molding or casting manufacturing processes, material is reshaped in a hollow mold.

40|$|As a {{net shape}} process, die casting is {{intrinsically}} efficient {{and improvements in}} energy efficiency are strongly dependent on design and process improvements that reduce scrap rates so that more of the total consumed energy goes into acceptable, usable castings. A casting that is distorted and fails to meet specified dimensional requirements is typically remelted but this still results in a decrease in process yield, lost productivity, and increased energy consumption. This work focuses on developing, and expanding the use of, computer modeling methods {{that can be used}} to improve the dimensional accuracy of die castings and produce die designs and machine/die setups that reduce rejection rates due to dimensional issues. A major factor contributing to the dimensional inaccuracy of the casting is the elastic deformations of the die cavity caused by the thermo mechanical loads the dies are subjected to during normal operation. Although thermal and die cavity filling simulation are widely used in the industry, structural modeling of the die, particularly for managing part distortion, is not yet widely practiced. This may be due in part to the need to have a thorough understanding of the physical phenomenon involved in die distortion and the mathematical theory employed in the numerical models to efficiently model the die distortion phenomenon. Therefore, two of the goals of this work are to assist in efforts to expand the use of structural modeling and related technologies in the die casting industry by 1) providing a detailed modeling guideline and tutorial for those interested in developing the necessary skills and capability and 2) by developing simple metaÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂmodels that capture the results and experience gained from several years of die distortion research and can be used to predict key distortion phenomena of relevance to a die caster with a minimum of background and without the need for simulations. These objectives were met. A detailed modeling tutorial was provided to NADCA for distribution to the industry. Power law based metaÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂmodels for predicting machine tie bar loading and for predicting maximum <b>parting</b> <b>surface</b> separation were successfully developed and tested against simulation results for a wide range of machines and experimental data. The models proved to be remarkably accurate, certainly well within the requirements for practical application. In addition to making die structural modeling more accessible, the work advanced the state-of-the-art by developing improved modeling of cavity pressure effects, which is typically modeled as a hydrostatic boundary condition, and performing a systematic analysis of the influence of ejector die design variables on die deflection and parting plane separation. This cavity pressure modeling objective met with less than complete success due to the limits of current finite element based fluidÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂstructureÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂinteraction analysis methods, but an improved representation of the casting/die interface was accomplished using a combination of solid and shell elements in the finite element model. This approximation enabled good prediction of final part distortion verified with a comprehensive evaluation of the dimensions of test castings produced with a design experiment. An extra deliverable of the experimental work was development of high temperature mechanical properties for the A 380 die casting alloy. The ejector side design objective was met and the results were incorporated into the metamodels described above. This new technology was predicted to result in an average energy savings of 2. 03 trillion BTUÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂs/year over a 10 year period.

Along with these energy savings, reduction of scrap and improvement in casting yield will result in a reduction of the environmental emissions associated with the melting and pouring of the metal which will be saved as a result of this technology.
