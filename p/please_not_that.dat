40|$|The {{recently}} puplished Barber-Tennyson (BT 2) synthetic H_ 2 O {{water line}} list {{is the most}} complete and accurate line list in existence. It is finding application {{in a wide range}} of astrophysical environments. UKIRT spectra of comet Tempel 1, obtained after the 'Deep Impact' event, revealed several known H_ 2 O solar pumped fluorescent (SPF) lines in the 2. 8945 to 2. 8985 μm region. In addition, using synthetic spectra produced with BT 2, several emission lines were identified that had not previously been recorded in cometary spectra. Unlike the SPF lines, which are transitions from doubly-excited stretch states, these transitions, that we label 'SH', are from states with three or four quanta of vibrational excitation. The SH features were particularly strong during the period 20 - 40 minutes after impact.

And the king of Erin looked at the maiden, and was well <b>pleased,</b> <b>not</b> knowing <b>that</b> it was Gille Mairtean the fox. And he bowed low, and besought her to do him the honour to enter the palace; and Gille Mairtean, as he went in, turned {{to look back at}} Ian Direach, and laughed.|$|R

60|$|The {{deputation}} retired greatly crestfallen, and {{the result}} was that for that evening the young Canterbury girls were {{for the first time in}} their lives nearly emancipated from maternal supervision, and enjoyed the evening proportionately, flirting with a zest all the greater for its being an amusement indulged in for the first time, and making their mothers' hearts swell, and their mothers' hair figuratively stand on end at such unheard of goings on. Another consequence of the lighted walks was that many families of girls who had never hitherto been allowed to dance except in quadrilles, now found themselves allowed to waltz as they <b>pleased.</b> <b>Not</b> <b>that</b> their mothers' views of the extreme impropriety of such dances had undergone any change; but that of two evils they chose the least, and thought it better to have their daughters waltzing under their eyes, than that they should be wandering away altogether beyond their ken.|$|R

60|$|He {{felt as if}} his {{praise of}} Cornelia were somehow retrieval; {{as if it would}} avail where he seemed {{otherwise}} so helpless, and would bring them together on the old terms again. There was, indeed, nothing explicit in their alienation, and when he saw Cornelia at Mrs. Westley's first Thursday, {{he made his way to}} her at once, and asked her if she would give him some tea, with the effect of having had a cup from her the day before. He did not know whether to be <b>pleased</b> or <b>not</b> <b>that</b> she treated their meeting as something uneventful, too, and made a little joke about remembering that he liked his tea without sugar.|$|R
