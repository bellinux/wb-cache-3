5|$|Based on {{the work}} on {{albatross}} genera, Robertson and Nunn went on in 1998 to propose a revised taxonomy with 24 different species, compared to the 14 then accepted. This expanded taxonomy elevated many established subspecies to full species, but was criticised for not using, in every case, <b>peer</b> <b>reviewed</b> <b>information</b> to justify the splits. Since then, further studies have in some instances supported or disproved the splits; a 2004 paper analysing the mitochondrial DNA and microsatellites agreed with {{the conclusion that the}} Antipodean albatross and the Tristan albatross were distinct from the wandering albatross, per Robertson and Nunn, but found that the suggested Gibson's albatross, Diomedea gibsoni, was not distinct from the Antipodean albatross. For the most part, an interim taxonomy of 21 species is accepted by ITIS and many other researchers, though by no means all—in 2004 Penhallurick and Wink called for the number of species to be reduced to 13 (including the lumping of the Amsterdam albatross with the wandering albatross), although this paper was itself controversial. On all sides is the widespread agreement on the need for further research to clarify the issue.|$|R

40|$|Despite the {{importance}} of roofs, improved roof selection has not been explored in significant depth. Therefore this research explores the possibilities that roofs offer to improve the value and sustainability of buildings. It {{is concerned with the}} roof as a system, explicitly connected with the building and their impacts on wider society. This research, develops and tests techniques to better understand what constitutes value and sustainability for a building project’s context through action research. The sustainability and value themes output through the use of such techniques are then considered as a basis for the selection of roof attributes through Keeney’s value focused thinking approach. Once the roof performance attributes have been established, designers and clients then require quantitative data to decide which roof type represents the highest value / most sustainable option. Thus the research also collates and maps <b>peer</b> <b>reviewed</b> quantitative performance data on the performance of roofing systems in relation to climate type as well as providing information from leading modelling packages for different roof options. An approach for selecting the most appropriate data is then developed. This allows the practitioner to be able to access reliable <b>peer</b> <b>reviewed</b> <b>information</b> and utilise leading modelling techniques to quickly gain information regarding the performance of various roof systems for use in the project context. An approach is developed to bring this information together with the important sustainability considerations for the project to inform sustainable roof selection. This combines the different types of roof performance with the relevant decision attributes early in the design process, to provide insight into which roof option represents the best overall economic, environmental and social value and therefore the most sustainable roof option. The primary contribution to knowledge presented in this thesis is the development of a pragmatic realist approach to sustainable roof selection...|$|R

40|$|Mycotoxins are fungal {{metabolites}} which, when ingested, inhaled or absorbed {{through the}} skin, cause lowered performance, sickness or death in man or animals, including birds" (Pitt, 1996). They are poisonous substances, which occur naturally and {{are perhaps the}} most prevalent source of food related health risk in field crops. However, they are almost unrecognized publicly. Consumption of food with high levels can be fatal. Long-term exposure can, amongst other things, increase cancer risk and suppress the immune system. An invaluable web site [URL] is available as "a means of rapid access to internationally <b>peer</b> <b>reviewed</b> <b>information</b> on chemicals commonly used throughout the world, which may also occur as contaminants in the environment and food". Mycotoxins are a significant component of the site and should be consulted for further information. Filamentous fungi are ubiquitous in nature and responsible for producing mycotoxins in agricultural crops. The fungi and mycotoxins are considered generally as being natural and unavoidable. It is accepted that St Anthony's fire (Holy fire), a disease that affected many parts of Europe in the tenth century, was caused by the consumption of rye contaminated with ergot alkaloids, a known mycotoxin of Claviceps purpurea (CAST, 2003). Mycotoxins have plagued mankind before and since the beginning of organized crop production, i. e. always. They attract worldwide scientific, political and economic attention because of the significant economic losses associated with impacts on human health, animal productivity and international trade. Unfortunately, they are also considered as potential weapons and so could enter the food chain by this route. A recent report (CAST, 2003) has a wealth of information regarding mycotoxins, and has been referred to liberally in this overview. It is also available on the World Wide Web. Food contamination with mycotoxins has only been fully appreciated since the 1960 's, when an unknown disease of animals occurred in England (CAST, 200...|$|R

Purdue has explored an approach of integrating {{information literacy}} into Agriculture 101. Agriculture 101 is a halfsemester, college-wide introductory class and is team taught by the Associate Dean of Agriculture and the librarian. This opportunity reassessed the approach to addressing ACRL Information Literacy standards. Librarians had attempted to address {{as many of these}} standards as possible in a session. In this case, being an instructor of record and part of the instruction team afforded a different approach to information literacy. The core approach was a guided writing assignment in which students were asked to contrast popular and scientific articles on a topic. A portion of the assignment evaluation was anonymous student <b>peer</b> <b>review.</b> Five <b>information</b> literacy objectives were addressed through this assignment, all of which were focused on evaluating information sources. Initially, it was found that freshmen found the search process a barrier to completing the assignment. As a result, students were given articles to work with, allowing them to focus on understanding content. The primary outcome was the ability to distinguish between popular and scholarly articles. Other outcomes, such as <b>peer</b> <b>review</b> in the scientific process and improved writing, were secondary. Three semesters of assessment data provide statistically significant evidence of this approach's success in improving students' abilities. Additionally, this has afforded an opportunity to demonstrate the value and dedication of librarians to improving student learning, and the value of incorporating information literacy into the curriculum...|$|R
5000|$|Much of {{the impetus}} for this {{legislation}} {{can be traced to}} the publication of the landmark report, [...] "To Err is Human", by the Institute of Medicine in 1999 (Report). The Report cited studies that found that at least 44,000 people and potentially as many as 98,000 people die in U. S. hospitals each year as a result of preventable medical errors. Based on these studies and others, the Report estimated that the total national costs of preventable adverse events, including lost income, lost household productivity, permanent and temporary disability, and health care costs to be between $17 billion and $29 billion, of which health care costs represent one-half. One of the main conclusions was that the majority of medical errors do not result from individual recklessness or the actions of a particular group; rather, most errors are caused by faulty systems, processes, and conditions that lead people to make mistakes or fail to prevent adverse events. Thus, the Report recommended mistakes can best be prevented by designing the health care system at all levels to improve safety—making it harder to do something wrong and easier to do something right.As compared to other high-risk industries, the health care system is behind in its attention to ensuring basic safety. The reasons for this lag are complex and varied. Providers are often reluctant to participate in quality review activities for fear of liability, professional sanctions, or injury to their reputations. Traditional state-based legal protections for such health care quality improvement activities, collectively known as <b>peer</b> <b>review</b> protections, are limited in scope: They do not exist in all States; typically they only apply to <b>peer</b> <b>review</b> in hospitals and do not cover other health care settings, and seldom enable health care systems to pool data or share experience between facilities. If <b>peer</b> <b>review</b> protected <b>information</b> is transmitted outside an individual hospital, the <b>peer</b> <b>review</b> privilege for that information is generally considered to be waived. This limits the potential for aggregation of a sufficient number of patient safety events to permit the identification of patterns that could suggest the underlying causes of risks and hazards that then can be used to improve patient safety.|$|R
