To feature their mechanical aspect of fatigue behavior, the low-cycle fatigue behavior of <b>permanent</b> <b>mold</b> <b>cast</b> and die-cast Al-Si-Cu-Mg alloys at room temperature was investigated. The experimental results show that both <b>permanent</b> <b>mold</b> <b>cast</b> and die-cast Al-Si-Cu-Mg alloys mainly exhibit cyclic strain hardening. At the same total strain amplitude, the die-cast Al-Si-Cu-Mg alloy shows higher cyclic deformation resistance and longer fatigue life than does the <b>permanent</b> <b>mold</b> <b>cast</b> Al-Si-Cu-Mg alloy. The relationship between both elastic and plastic strain amplitudes with reversals to failure shows a monotonic linear behavior, and can be described by the Basquin and Cofﬁn-Manson equations, respectively...|$|E

40|$|The {{object of}} this study was to {{investigate}} tensile strength, hardness, density and wear resistance of the <b>permanent</b> <b>mold</b> <b>cast</b> iron. To carry out this experiment, suitable casting conditions, with which grey iron should be taken in the as-cast condition, were picked out, and the test pieces, JIS 8 C type tensile strength test pieces, were casted using two kinds of cast iron mold which has respectively mold ratio 6. 5 and 9. 0. The mold were coated with two layers of coating material, diatomaceous earth and soot. Irons, about 3 kg, were melted in a high frequency induction furnace at about 1450 ℃ with alumina crucible and were poured into the mold at 1300 ℃, after　being　inoculated　at　 1450 ℃ with 0. 3 % Ca-Si. Chemical composition of irons was adjusted to have required the degree of eutectic saturatio (Sc), 0. 85 to 1. 05, by the addition of low carbon steel to the base iron containing 3. 79 %C, 2. 20 %Si, 0. 44 %Mn, 0. 12 %P, 0. 05 %S. For purpose of reference, test pieces with same type were casted into green sand mold. The results obtained are as follows: (1) The microstructure of the <b>permanent</b> <b>mold</b> <b>cast</b> iron with a grey fracture in the as-cast condition is composed of ferritic and pearlitic matrix containing eutectic and fine flaky graphite, and higher Sc is, more the ferrite among the matrix becomes. (2) Strength of the <b>permanent</b> <b>mold</b> <b>cast</b> iron is better than that of the sand mold casting with same Sc:the tensile strength and the hardness of the <b>permanent</b> <b>mold</b> <b>cast</b> iron is respectively 24 to 32 kg/mm＾ 2) and 220 to 260 Hv(20). Density of the <b>permanent</b> <b>mold</b> <b>cast</b> iron is higher than that of green sand mold cast iron. (3) In case of grey iron permanent molding,it is necessary to select the chemical composition and the cooling conditions to keep away from tending to be white or mottled cast iron, and hence it tends to have similar structure and mechanical properties. Therefore,it will be recommended,in case of permanent mold casting,to controll strictly the casting conditions using the iron with higher Sc which has less chilling tendency. (4) Owing to the ferritic structure included in the matrix,wear resistance of the <b>permanent</b> <b>mold</b> <b>cast</b> iron is inferior to that of green sand mold cast iron, and higher Sc is, lower the wear resistance becomes...|$|E

40|$|In {{the present}} work, the impact {{behavior}} of unmodified A 356 alloys {{with the addition}} of Ni or V in as-cast and T 6 heat-treated conditions was assessed. Charpy V-notched specimens obtained from sand and permanent mold casting showed low total absorbed energy average values (Wt< 2 J). SEM analysis of fracture profiles and surfaces indicated a Si-driven crack propagation with a predominant transgranular fracture mode. Occasionally, intergranular contributions to fracture were detected in the <b>permanent</b> <b>mold</b> <b>cast</b> alloys due to the locally finer microstructure. Concurrent mechanisms related to the chemical composition, solidification conditions and heat treatment were found to control the impact properties of the alloys. While the trace element Ni exerted only minor effects on the impact toughness of the A 356 alloy, V had a strong influence: (i) V-containing sand cast alloys absorbed slightly higher impact energies compared to the corresponding A 356 base alloys; (ii) in the <b>permanent</b> <b>mold</b> <b>cast</b> alloys, V in solid solution led to a considerable loss of ductility, which in turn decreased the total absorbed energy...|$|E

Powertrain components offer significant potential for vehicle weight reductions. Recently, magnesium alloys have shown promise for use in powertrain applications where creep has been a limiting factor. These systems are Mg-Al based, with alkaline earth or rare earth additions. The solidification, microstructure, and creep behavior of a series of Mg- 4 Al- 4 X:(Ca, Ce, La, and Sr) alloys and a commercially developed AXJ 530 (Mg – 5 Al – 3 Ca – 0. 15 Sr) alloy (by wt%) have been investigated. The order of decreasing freezing range of the five alloys was: AX 44, AXJ 530, AJ 44, ALa 44 and ACe 44. All alloys exhibited a solid solution primary α-Mg phase surrounded by an interdendritic region of Mg and intermetallic(s). The primary phase was composed of grains approximately an order of magnitude larger than the cellular structure. All alloys were <b>permanent</b> <b>mold</b> <b>cast</b> directly to creep specimens and AXJ 530 specimens were provided in die-cast form. The tensile creep behavior was investigated at 175 °C for stresses ranging from 40 to 100 MPa. The order of decreasing creep resistance was: die-cast AXJ 530 and <b>permanent</b> <b>mold</b> <b>cast</b> AXJ 530, AX 44, AJ 44, ALa 44 and ACe 44. Grain size, solute concentration, and matrix precipitates were the most significant microstructural features that influenced the creep resistance. Decreases in grain size or increases in solute concentration, both Al and the ternary addition, lowered the minimum creep rate. In the Mg-Al-Ca alloys, finely distributed Al 2 Ca precipitates in the matrix also improved the creep resistance by a factor of ten over the same alloy with coarse precipitates. The morphology of the eutectic region was distinct between alloys but did not contribute to difference in creep behavior. Creep strain distribution for the Mg-Al-Ca alloys developed heterogeneously on the scale of the α-Mg grains. As additional bulk strain accumulated, strain localized along grain boundaries between grains with significantly different Schmid factors. At these locations cavities and cracks formed that led to the eventual creep failure. Grain size influenced the plastic strain distribution during creep...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Recently, heat {{treatment}} technologies {{have been developed}} by the CSIRO Light Metals Flagship in Australia that allow the 0. 2 % proof stress of conventional aluminum alloy high pressure diecastings (HPDC’s) {{to be more than}} doubled without encountering problems with blistering or dimensional instability [1, 2].

However, the current commercial HPDC Al-Si-Cu alloys have not been developed to exploit {{heat treatment}} or to optimize these specific mechanical properties, and one potential limitation of heat treating HPDC’s is that fracture resistance may be reduced as strength is increased. The current paper presents the outcomes of a program aimed at developing highly castable, secondary Al-Si-Cu HPDC alloys which display significantly enhanced ductility and fracture resistance in both the as-cast and heat treated conditions. Kahn-type tear tests were conducted to compare the fracture resistance of the conventional A 380 alloy with a selection of the newly developed compositions.

The results reveal that the microstructure of the PMC alloy consists of coarse and equiaxed α dendrites and interdendritic net-like eutectic phases. However, the microstructure of the PTF composite, {{similar to that of the}} PTF alloy, consists of near-spheroidal primary particles and intergranular secondarily solidified structures except SiCp, which are distributed in the secondarily solidified structures. The eutectics amount in the PTF materials is distinctly lower than that in the PMC alloy, and the microstructures of the former materials are quite compact while that of the latter alloy is porous. Therefore, the PTF alloy shows better tensile properties than the PMC alloy. Owing to the existence of the SiC reinforcing particles, the PTF composite attains an ultimate tensile strength and yield strength of 230 MPa and 128 MPa, representing an enhancement of 27. 8 % and 29. 3 % than those (180 MPa and 99 MPa) of the PTF alloy.

It was possible to pour the composite melt into the sand mold through a filter. (3) Trials were run to determine the required amount of the wetting agent, magnesium, to ensure appropriate mixing of the aluminum alloy and fly ash. The magnesium content required to mix ''F'' fly ash was much lower compared to that required to mix hybrid ''C-F'' fly ash in similar melts. Fly ash particles of less than 100 microns were mixed in aluminum melt.

40|$|The {{commercial}} {{applications of}} cast Al-Si alloys depend {{to an important}} extent on controlling the morphology of the eutectic silicon through thermal modification in the solid state and/or chemical modification of the melt before {{the production of the}} casting. The effects of modification and/or heat treatment on the microstructure and the mechanical properties of 356 alloy have been investigated on both permanent mold and sand cast samples. Strontium (0. 02 %) and sodium (0. 01 %) were used to produce well modified microstructures. The importance of the amount of modifier used was also examined in producing castings with 0. 002 % Sr and 0. 08 % Sr. Production parameters such as solution heat treatment time and artificial aging time were examined. Microstructural assessment was done by quantitative metallography using image analysis coupled to SEM while mechanical testing comprised tensile testing, hardness and microhardness measurements as well as impact tests. The greatest improvement in mechanical properties obtained with modification was observed for the lower rates of solidification, i. e sand casting. The effect of modification on the heat treatment response of 356 alloy was investigated. The differences between unmodified and modified microstructures were more important in sand cast samples than in <b>permanent</b> <b>mold</b> <b>cast</b> samples. After one hour of solution heat treatment at 540 $ sp circ$C, both permanent mold unmodified and modified microstructures became similar in terms of silicon particle size and sphericity. The processes which led to this were different. Silicon platelets in the unmodified structures segmented while silicon particles in the modified alloy coarsened. The final result was however the same. In sand cast alloy, the initial microstructural differences persisted after up to 12 hours of solution treatment. The coarser the initial as-cast microstructure, the greater the improvements associated with modification and heat treatment. It was also found that porosity caused by modification can negate many of the microstructural benefits by decreasing tensile strength and percent elongation. It was demonstrated that modification also has an influence on the aluminum matrix. The hardness of modified alloy was found to be less after the T 6 temper than in unmodified alloy. This was reflected in a lower yield strength of modified 356 alloy. Quantitative microstructure-mechanical property relationships were established for the permanent mold samples. The best silicon-structure characteristics to predict the tensile properties were found to be the particle count per unit area and the particle area. It was also determined that hardness can be a simple and inexpensive means whereby ultimate tensile strength and yield strength of 356 alloy in the T 4 condition or T 6 condition can be estimated...|$|E

40|$|The <b>permanent</b> <b>mold</b> <b>casting</b> {{process is}} a {{relatively}} popular and effective casting technology that can produce near-net-shape aluminum components with integrity, particularly for the automotive and aerospace industries. It is well recognized by the casting industry that {{it is essential to}} control the cooling of <b>permanent</b> <b>mold</b> castings in order {{to improve the quality of}} the castings, so there is a considerable incentive to develop a more effective method of mold cooling to control the temperature distribution of the <b>mold</b> and the <b>casting.</b> The current technologies for controlled cooling are air or water cooling passages and chill inserts. Each of these cooling methods presents certain disadvantages, and none offer optimum cooling control. Based on these considerations, a novel, effective and controllable water-based heat pipe has been successfully developed to be used as a new method of <b>permanent</b> <b>mold</b> cooling where high heat fluxes are normally encountered. Heat pipes featuring this design have been incorporated in an experimental <b>permanent</b> <b>mold</b> made of HI 3 tool steel that contains three symmetric steps. Computer modeling for the <b>permanent</b> <b>mold</b> <b>casting</b> process has been accomplished to predict the effect and potential of heat pipe cooling for <b>permanent</b> <b>mold</b> <b>casting.</b> Castings of A 3 56 alloy have been produced by this <b>permanent</b> <b>mold.</b> The effects of heat pipe cooling on <b>permanent</b> <b>mold</b> castings have been evaluated by analyzing the temperature distribution of the <b>mold</b> and the <b>casting,</b> as well as by measuring the dendrite arm spacing and shrinkage distribution of the castings. The effect of heat pipe cooling on the mold solidification time of castings of A 356 alloy with different coating types was also studied. Industrial trials have been carried out to evaluate this new cooling technology on an industrial scale casting machine. Because the space around the mold installed on a low pressure die casting machine is very limited, it is often very difficult to install the heat pipe in the specific desired location in the mold. A new version flexible heat pipe cooling system has been developed for the industrial casting process. Preliminary and industrial tests of the heat pipe cooling system have been performed. The effects of heat pipe cooling, as well as the effects of using traditional water and air cooling on the low pressure die casting were studied. Data on the cooling rates obtained by heat pipes, as well as some microstructures and measurements of the dendrite arm spacing are presented in this thesis. Modeling and experimental results have shown that the water based heat pipe can provide high cooling rates in casting processes. The dendrite arm spacing (DAS) of A 356 alloy is refined considerably by the heat pipes, and changes in the shrinkage pattern are provided by the dramatic changes in the heat flow patterns...|$|R

In addition, the severer corrosion happening to the as-cast condition is correlated with the galvanic corrosion between the matrix and the eutectic compounds; while improved corrosion resistance for the T 4 and T 6 conditions is ascribed to the dissolution of the secondary eutectic compounds. The measured corrosion current densities of Mg- 10 Gd- 3 Y- 0. 5 Zr alloys in as-cast, T 4, and T 6 conditions are 36 μA·cm- 2, 10 μA·cm- 2, and 33 μA·cm- 2, respectively. The proposed equivalent circuit [Rs(CPE 1 (Rt(RfCPE 2)) ] by Zview software matches well with the tested electrochemical impedance spectra (EIS) data...|$|R
50|$|Sand casting {{is one of}} {{the most}} popular and {{simplest}} types of casting, and has been used for centuries. Sand casting allows for smaller batches than <b>permanent</b> <b>mold</b> <b>casting</b> and at a very reasonable cost. Not only does this method allow manufacturers to create products at a low cost, but there are other benefits to sand casting, such as very small-size operations. The process allows for castings small enough fit in the palm of one's hand to those large enough only for train beds (one casting can create the entire bed for one rail car). Sand casting also allows most metals to be cast depending on the type of sand used for the molds.|$|R
40|$|The leaded bronze, {{the lead}}ed brass, the lead free bronze {{including}} bismuth {{and the lead}} free bronze with sulfide dispersion were <b>cast</b> into the <b>permanent</b> <b>mold</b> for the solidification cracking test. The applicability of the <b>permanent</b> <b>mold</b> <b>casting</b> process for bronzes was evaluated with comparison {{of the range of}} the solidification temperature. The lead free bronze with sulfide dispersion was more unbreakable than the other copper alloys. There were differences of the dendrite form near by the fracture and the distribution of the residual melt segregated at a part {{of the end of the}} solidification. The lead free bronze with sulfide dispersion may have a solidification form being unlikely to crack. It dispersion is possible to apply the <b>permanent</b> <b>mold</b> castings process rather than the other copper alloys, and the applicability is almost same as brass castings. 70 th World Foundry Congress 2012 (WFC 2012) held 25 - 27 April 2012, Monterrey, Mexico...|$|R
40|$|Modeling the complex, coupled fluid flow, heat {{transfer}} and solidification phenomena {{taking place in}} metal casting is a challenging task. The quality of any metal casting depends on many parameters such as the type of mould, rate of filling, and rate of solidification. Optimization of these operational parameters {{is very important in}} reducing casting defects such as oxide inclusions and porosity. This paper addresses the first steps in validating a computational fluid dynamics (CFD) model of <b>permanent</b> <b>mold</b> <b>casting</b> of aluminum. A mathematical model of the casting system has been developed using the commercial CFD package StarCD. A physical model of the system has been used to validate the mold filling phenomena in the process. Comparison of the results from these models will be presented...|$|R
