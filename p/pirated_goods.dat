With piracy the monopolist might instead produce more than one quality, hence differentiation arises as the optimal strategy. This is because the producer wants to divert consumers from the <b>pirated</b> <b>good</b> to the original one. Differentiation involves either producing a low-quality good such that piracy is eliminated or the monopolist can choose qualities such that piracy is still observed in equilibrium...|$|R

50|$|Growing over 10,000% in {{the last}} two decades, {{counterfeit}} products exist in virtually every area, including food, beverages, clothes, shoes, pharmaceuticals, electronics, auto parts, toys, and currency. The spread of counterfeit goods is worldwide, and in 2008 a study by the International Chamber of Commerce (ICC) estimated the global value of all counterfeit goods reached $650 billion every year, doubling the estimated annual profit made from the sale of illegal drugs worldwide according to data collected by Illicit Trade Monitor. The same study projected that in 2015 the upper bound of the global value of counterfeit and <b>pirated</b> <b>goods</b> could be $1.77 trillion, a number that is roughly equal to the GDP of Brazil. Counterfeit products make up 5 to 7% of world trade and have cost an estimated 2.5 million jobs worldwide, with 750,000 jobs lost in the U.S. alone.

5000|$|Such uses of {{the term}} have been criticized, {{primarily}} due to its assumption that if illegal (pirated) copies were not available, the consumers of such a pirated copy would instead purchase the product at an average market rate. Critics of the [...] "lost sales" [...] concept note that some consumers, for example those in developing countries, or those with lower income such as students, {{may not be able}} to afford the market price of certain products and if there were no pirated copies available, it is likely they would simply not purchase the ones available at the market price. Others may treat <b>pirated</b> <b>goods</b> as samples that entice them to buy the product later on. It has been suggested that the better term would be [...] "retail value of pirated goods", and that equating such a concept with financial loss is fallacious. Treating each pirated copy as a lost sale, and using an estimate for the number of pirated copies in existence, multiplied by their retail value, as tangible loss of profits by the industry has been called disparagingly [...] "copyright math" [...] (a term coined by writer Robert Reid) that leads to overestimation of the content industry losses. In academic literature there is no consensus that the concept of piracy is clearly correlated with reduction of revenue of sales of the pirated product, and estimates of lost sales have been similarly criticized, with a 2010 U.S. government report noting that many commonly cited figures cannot be substantiated. Similarly, estimates of lost sales translated to concepts such as lost jobs or reduction in individual or national incomes have been shown to be highly problematic.|$|E

40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] University of Washington, 2016 - 06 Copyright {{infringement}} {{in markets}} of information goods [...] -commonly known as piracy [...] -has remained amongst the top {{concerns for the}} manufacturers {{as well as for}} governments around the world. There exists an extensive body of literature that discusses the issue of piracy along with possible remedies and responses for the manufacturers and policymakers. In my dissertation, I intend to contribute to that stream. First, I study the economic impact of piracy on the supply chain of information goods. When information goods are sold to consumers via a retailer, in certain situations, a moderate dose of piracy seems to have a surprising positive impact on the profits of the manufacturer and the retailer, while, at the same time, enhancing consumer welfare. Clearly, such a "win-win-win" situation is not only good for the overall supply chain, but is also beneficial for the overall economy. I argue that the economic rationale for this surprising result is rooted in how piracy interacts with the problem of double marginalization. I explain this rationale and develop useful insights for management and policy. Moving on to the supply-side of piracy [...] -which has largely been abstracted away in prior literature [...] -I compare the effects of different types of anti-piracy policies. I propose a clear distinction between efforts that restrict supply of <b>pirated</b> <b>goods</b> (supply-side enforcement) and those that penalize illegal consumption (demand-side enforcement). In my effort to compare these two different types of enforcement, I construct a parsimonious model that endogenizes the supply of <b>pirated</b> <b>goods.</b> Specifically, I capture the reality that download activities generate ad revenues for the uploaders in the piracy ecosystem, and it is that mechanism that incentivizes the suppliers of <b>pirated</b> <b>goods</b> to upload illegal content. In my analyses, perhaps expectedly, I find the two types of anti-piracy measures to have similar impacts on the profit and welfares in the short-run, where the cost of development is sunk, and the decision of the firm is only about pricing the product. However, surprisingly, in the long-run [...] -where the manufacturer can respond to piracy by changing its product quality as well [...] -the two different enforcement measures may have contrasting socioeconomic implications. All in all, supply-side enforcement turns out to have a much more desirable impact in the long run. I provide explanations for my findings and discuss the implications from the perspectives of the manufacturer, consumers, and policymakers...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} the optimal choice of pricing schedules and technological deterrence levels {{in a market}} with digital piracy where sellers can influence the degree of piracy by implementing digital rights management (DRM) systems. It is shown that a monopolist’s optimal pricing schedule {{can be characterized as}} a simple combination of the zero-piracy pricing schedule and a piracy-indifferent pricing schedule that makes all customers indifferent between legal usage and piracy. An increase in the quality of <b>pirated</b> <b>goods,</b> while lowering prices and profits, increases total surplus by expanding both the fraction of legal users and the volume of legal usage. In the absence of price discrimination, a seller’s optimal level of technology-based protection against piracy is shown to be at the technologically maximal level, which maximizes the difference between the quality of the legal and <b>pirated</b> <b>goods.</b> However, when a seller can price discriminate, its optimal choice is always a strictly lower level of technology-based protection. These results are based on the following digital rights conjecture: that granting digital rights increases the incidence of digital piracy, and that managing digital rights therefore involves restricting the rights of usage that contribute to customer value. Moreover, if a digital rights management system weakens over time due to the underlying technology being progressively hacked, a seller’s optimal strategic response may involve either increasing or decreasing its level of technology-based protection. This direction of change is related to whether the DRM technology implementing each marginal reduction in piracy is increasingly less or more vulnerable to hacking. Pricing and technology choice guidelines are presented, and some welfare implications are discussed. Key words: piracy; digital piracy; piracy deterrence; copyright; digital rights management; DRM; nonlinear pricing; price discrimination; screening; intellectual property; enforcemen...|$|E
