A reactive oxygen-containing atmosphere was used as such discharge conditions are typically employed for the synthesis of thin films. Asymmetries in the flux distribution of the recorded ions {{as well as their}} {{energies and}} charge states were noticed when varying the angle between mass-energy analyser and target surface. More positively charged ions with higher count rates in the medium energy range of their distributions were detected in +E×B than in -E×B direction, thus confirming the notion that ionisation zones (also known as spokes or plasma bunches) are associated with moving <b>potential</b> <b>humps.</b> The motion of the recorded negatively charged high-energy oxygen ions was unaffected. NbO_x thin films at different angles and positions were synthesised and analysed as to their structure and properties in order to correlate the observed plasma properties to the film growth conditions.

40|$|The {{model of}} a tranSformation of ion-acoustic double layer with small {{amplitude}} into strong double layer is presented in [1]. In this paper this model and all stages of evolution are described analytically. Earlier by numerical simulation in [2] and analytically in [3] {{it has been shown}} that an ion-acoustic instability development leads to a formation of a nonmonotoneous ion-acoustic double layer with small amplitude if an electron drift velocity is a little smaller than an electron thermal velocity. But this double layer accelerates ions. Hence on first front of ion-acoustic double layer an ion density becomes smaller. But into this region the electron flow penetrate with electron velocity only a little smaller than electron thermal velocity. Hence on the first front of the potential hollow the electron drift velocity becomes more than electron thermal velocity due to flow continuity law []. Due to Bunemann mechanism interaction of electron flow with this region an electric <b>potential</b> <b>hump</b> of large amplitude is excited with growth rate, proportionalto a*(m. lm) rt 3. Here a!

Chemoreceptor neurones with myelinated axons (average conduction velocity, 11 m/s) showed action <b>potentials</b> with a <b>hump</b> on the falling phase, followed by a prolonged after-hyperpolarization (average duration, 260 ms). The duration of the hump present in the action potential of chemoreceptor neurones {{was positively correlated with}} the duration of the after-hyperpolarization. In response to prolonged depolarization, chemoreceptor neurones showed only one or a few action potentials {{at the beginning of the}} depolarization. Two types of baroreceptors neurones with myelinated axons were found: fast (F) baroreceptors (average conduction velocity, 33 m/s) and slow (S) baroreceptors (average conduction velocity, 10 m/s). F baroreceptors had action <b>potentials</b> without a <b>hump</b> followed by a short after-hyperpolarization (average duration, 43 ms), while S baroreceptors had spikes similar to those found in chemoreceptors except for a shorter hyperpolarization (average duration, 145 ms).

40|$|The ionic conductances {{underlying}} the action potential and after-hyperpolarization {{of the cat}} petrosal ganglion neurones with myelinated axons in the carotid nerve were studied in vitro. Neurones {{were divided into two}} groups based on {{the presence or absence of}} an inflexion or hump on the spike falling phase. The application of tetrodotoxin (TTX, 3 X 10 (- 7) - 3 X 10 (- 6) M) revealed the presence of a TTX-resistant component in spikes with a hump, which was abolished in Na+-free solution. The action <b>potential</b> without a <b>hump</b> was blocked by TTX. The spike hump decreased or was abolished when Ca 2 +-channel blockers (Mn 2 +, 3 - 4 mM or Co 2 +, 5 mM) or low-Ca 2 + solutions (0. 1 - 0. 2 mM) were applied to the preparation. In neurones with a hump on the spike, regenerative responses were obtained in Na+-free, high-Ca 2 + (8. 8 mM) solution; these responses were antagonized by Mn 2 +, and their amplitude was proportional to the external Ca 2 + concentration. It is concluded that the action <b>potential</b> with a <b>hump</b> was produced by an Na+ current, a part of which was TTX-resistant, and by a Ca 2 + current which is responsible for the hump. Neurones without a hump had a TTX-sensitive Na+ spike. The spike with a hump was followed by a long-lasting after-hyperpolarization which reversed polarity at about - 82 mV. During the hyperpolarization an increase in membrane conductance was observed. The amplitude and duration of the long hyperpolarizing potential decreased when Ca 2 +-channel blockers or low-Ca 2 + solutions were applied. In Na+-free solution, regenerative responses were followed by a long hyperpolarization associated with an increase in membrane conductance. It is concluded that the long after-hyperpolarization is produced by activation of the Ca 2 +-dependent K+ conductance...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. In {{this paper}} the {{formation}} of the electric thermal barriers in kind of set of solitary hollow and hump of electric potential near ECR points on ends of cylindrical trap is investigated theoretically.

In this paper the mechanism of such barrier formation for plasma electrons and ions is investigated theoretically. This mechanism can provide the formation of trap for plasma. In ECR point the transversal electron velocity is increased strongly. At motion of electrons from the system they are reflected from the magnetic barrier back inside the system.

40|$|A semi-quantal {{interpretation}} of the Ne* 2 potentials, for states dissociating into Ne(2 p 5 3 s, 3 P 0, 2) + Ne(2 p 6, 1 S 0) is presented. Starting from the ab initio potentials calculated by Cohen and Schneider, one determines a modification — as small as possible and confined to the intermediate distance range (4 - 10 a. u.) — yielding a better agreement between theory and experiment in the thermal energy range. The proposed modification affects only the 3 Σ+ u state. After the diagonalization of the spin-orbit interaction, it results in consistent diminutions of the 0 -u - 1 u(3 P 2) and 0 -u(3 P 0) <b>potentials.</b> The <b>hump</b> of the two former states is lowered (21 meV instead of 108 meV) which gives good agreement with experiments on the Ne(3 P 2) -Ne(1 S 0) collision, especially for the resulting rainbow effect. The widening imposed on the 1 u-well is confirmed by the excimer emission spectra. At energies below 80 meV, the Ne(3 P 0) + Ne(1 S 0) collision is considered as purely elastic. Above this energy, dynamical couplings induce a perturbation of the elastic differential cross section and the 3 P 0 → 1, 2 superelastic process.

40|$|To {{determine}} {{the nature of}} dopamine modulation of dendritic Ca 2 � signaling in layers V–VI prefrontal cortex (PFC) neurons, whole-cell Ca 2 � potentials were evoked after blockade of Na � and K � channels. Soma-dendritic Ca 2 � spikes evoked by suprathreshold depolarizing pulses, which could be terminated by superimposed brief intrasomatic hyperpolarizing pulses, are blocked by the L-type Ca 2 � channel antagonist nimodipine (1 �M). The D 1 /D 5 receptor agonist dihydrexidine (DHX) (0. 01 – 10 �M; 5 min) or R-(�) SKF 81291 (10 �M) induced a prolonged (� 30 min) dose-dependent peak suppression of these Ca 2 � spikes. This effect was dependent on [Ca 2 �] i- and protein kinase C (PKC) -dependent mechanisms because [Ca 2 �] i chelation by BAPTA or inhibition of PKC by bisindolymaleimide (BiM 1), but not inhibition of [Ca 2 �] i release with heparin or Xestospongin C, prevented the D 1 -mediated suppression of Ca 2 � spikes. Depolarizing pulses subthreshold to activating a Ca 2 � spike evoked a nimodipine-sensitive Ca 2 � “hump ” potential. D 1 /D 5 stimulation induced an N-[2 -((o-bromocinamyl) amino) ethyl]- 5 -isoquinolinesulfonamide (H- 89) - or internal PKA inhibitory peptide [5 – 24]-sensitive (PKAdependent) transient (� 7 min) potentiation of the <b>hump</b> <b>potential</b> to full Ca 2 � spike firing. Furthermore, application of DHX {{in the presence of}} the PKC inhibitor BiM 1 or internal PKC inhibitory peptide [19 – 36] resulted in persistent firing of full Ca 2 � spike bursts, suggesting that a D 1 /D 5 –PKA mechanism switches subthreshold Ca 2 � <b>hump</b> <b>potential</b> to fire full Ca 2 � spikes, which are eventually turned off by a D 1 /D 5 –Ca 2 �-dependent PKC mechanism.

40|$|We have {{developed}} a numerical model of a double-probe electric field sensor equipped with a photoelectron guard electrode for the particle-in-cell simulation. The model includes typical elements of modern double-probe sensors on, e. g., BepiColombo/MMO, Cluster, and THEMIS spacecraft, such as a conducting boom and a preamplifier housing called a puck. The puck is also used for the guard electrode, and its potential is negatively biased by reference to the floating spacecraft potential. We apply the proposed model {{to an analysis of}} an equilibrium plasma environment around the sensor by assuming that the sun illuminates the spacecraft from the direction perpendicular to the sensor deployment axis. As a simulation result, it is confirmed that a substantial number of spacecraft-originating photoelectrons are once emitted sunward and then fall onto the puck and sensing element positions. In order to effectively repel such photoelectrons coming from the sun direction, a <b>potential</b> <b>hump</b> for electrons, i. e., a negative potential region, should be created in a plasma region around the sunlit side of the guard electrode surface. The simulation results reveal the significance of the guard electrode potential being not only lower than the spacecraft body but also lower than the background plasma potential of the region surrounding the puck and the sensing element. One solution for realizing such an operational condition is to bias the guard potential negatively by reference to the sensor potential because the sensor is usually operated nearly at the background plasma potential...|$|E
40|$|Charge-state-resolved ion energy-time-distributions of pulsed Cu arc plasma were {{obtained}} by using direct (time dependent) acquisition of the ion detection signal from a commercial ion mass-per-charge and energy-per-charge analyzer. We find a shift of energies of Cu 2 +, Cu 3 + and Cu 4 + ions to lower values {{during the first few}} hundred microseconds after arc ignition, which is evidence for particle collisions in the plasma. The generation of Cu 1 + ions in the later part of the pulse, measured by the increase of Cu 1 + signal intensity and an associated slight reduction of the mean charge state point to charge exchange reactions between ions and neutrals. At {{the very beginning of the}} pulse, when the plasma expands into vacuum and the plasma potential strongly fluctuates, ions with much higher energy (over 200 eV) were observed. Early in the pulse, the ion energies observed are approximately proportional to the ion charge state, and we conclude that the acceleration mechanism is primarily based on acceleration in an electric field. This field is directed away from the cathode, indicative for a <b>potential</b> <b>hump.</b> Measurements by a floating probe suggest that potential structures travel and ions moving in the traveling field can gain high energies up to a few hundred electron-volt. Later in the pulse, the approximate proportionality is lost, which is either related to increased smearing out of different energies due to collisions with neutrals, and/or a change of the acceleration character from electrostatic to "gas-dynamic", i. e., dominated by pressure gradient.

40|$|Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) This thesis investigates ion energy {{distributions}} (IEDs) during plasma immersion {{ion implantation}} (PIII). PIII is a surface modification technique where an object {{is placed in}} a plasma and pulse biased with large negative voltages. The energy distribution of implanted ions is important in determining the extent of surface modifications. IED measurements were made during PIII using a pulse biased retarding field energy analyser (RFEA) in a capacitive RF plasma. Experimental results were compared with those obtained from a two dimensional numerical simulation to help explain the origins of features in the IEDs. Time resolved IED measurements were made during PIII of metal and insulator materials and investigated {{the effects of the}} use of a metal mesh over the surface and the effects of insulator surface charging. When the pulse was applied to the RFEA, the ion flux rapidly increased above the pulse-off value and then slowly decreased during the pulse. The ion density during the pulse decreased below values measured when no pulse was applied to the RFEA. This indicates that the depletion of ions by the pulsed RFEA is greater than the generation of ions in the plasma. IEDs measured during pulse biasing showed a peak close to the maximum sheath potential energy and a spread of ions with energies between zero and the maximum ion energy. Simulations showed that the peak is produced by ions from the sheath edge directly above the RFEA inlet and that the spread of ions is produced by ions which collide in the sheath and/or arrive at the RFEA with trajectories not perpendicular to the RFEA front surface. The RFEA discriminates ions based only on the component of their velocity perpendicular to the RFEA front surface. To minimise the effects of surface charging during PIII of an insulator, a metal mesh can be placed over the insulator and pulse biased together with the object. Measurements were made with metal mesh cylinders fixed to the metal RFEA front surface. The use of a mesh gave a larger ion flux compared to the use of no mesh. The larger ion flux is attributed to the larger plasma-sheath surface area around the mesh. The measured IEDs showed a low, medium and high energy peak. Simulation results show that the high energy peak is produced by ions from the sheath above the mesh top. The low energy peak is produced by ions trapped by the space charge <b>potential</b> <b>hump</b> which forms inside the mesh. The medium energy peak is produced by ions from the sheath above the mesh corners. Simulations showed that the IED is dependent on measurement position under the mesh. To investigate the effects of insulator surface charging during PIII, IED measurements were made through an orifice cut into a Mylar insulator on the RFEA front surface. With no mesh, during the pulse, an increasing number of lower energy ions were measured. Simulation results show that {{this is due to the}} increase in the curvature of the sheath over the orifice region as the insulator potential increases due to surface charging. The surface charging observed at the insulator would reduce the average energy of ions implanted into the insulator during the pulse. Compared to the case with no mesh, the use of a mesh increases the total ion flux and the ion flux during the early stages of the pulse but does not eliminate surface charging. During the pulse, compared to the no mesh case, a larger number of lower energy ions are measured. Simulation results show that this is caused by the potential in the mesh region which affects the trajectories of ions from the sheaths above the mesh top and corners and results in more ions being measured with trajectories less than ninety degrees to the RFEA front surface...|$|E

40|$|An {{extensive}} {{study has}} been done {{for the first time}} on the structure of the electrical double layer (EDL) at polarized glassy carbon (GC) and gold (Au) electrode interfaces in a series of room-temperature ionic liquids (RTILs) via the measurement of capacitance-potential curves. The parabolic capacitance-potential curves similar to those observed in high-temperature inorganic molten salts were obtained at GC electrode in all of the RTILs studied. Potential of zero charge (PZC) at GC electrode in imidazolium-based RTILs depends significantly on the electrochemical pretreatment of the electrode surface: Electrochemical oxidation pretreatment generates the oxide surface on GC electrode, which results in a favorable adsorption of positively charged imidazolium cations on the electrode surface and in turn shifts the PZC to the positive direction of potential, whereas at the electrochemically reduced GC electrode, on which the adsorption of the imidazolium cations is less favorable, PZC shifts to the negative direction of potential. Such an effect of electrochemical pretreatment was not observed at the highly oriented pyrolytic graphite electrode. The hump on the anodic side of the capacitance−potential curves at Au electrode in imidazolium-based RTILs results from the π-electronic interaction of the imidazolium ring with the metal electrode, which was substantiated by using nonmetallic electrode and varying the ions of the RTILs. Such an enhanced interaction of the imidazolium ring with a gold electrode, as in the case of anion adsorption, shifts the PZC to the negative direction of <b>potential.</b> Such a <b>hump</b> as that observed at the gold electrode was not observed at the GC electrode.

40|$|Ventral tegmental area dopaminergic neurons are {{critically}} {{involved in}} brain mechanisms of reward, motivation, and emotional arousal. The natural cholinergic agonist nicotine is highly addictive and believed to cause addiction through activating the central dopamine system. In this thesis, we used perforated patch-clamp recording {{to examine the}} effects of the cholinergic agonist carbachol on the excitability of dopamine neurons in brain slices. Results from these experiments revealed that bath application of carbachol (20 μM) for 1 - 2 min excited most cells in the VTA regardless of their membrane characteristics and neurochemical identities. Muscarinic and nicotinic receptors appeared to contribute equally to carbachol-induced excitation. A majority of cells putatively identified as dopaminergic based on the expression of hyperpolarization-activated current and dopamine-induced autoinhibition, responded to carbachol with depolarization and an increased rate of firing. Of these cells, 13 % responded to the carbachol with a switching of firing pattern from tonic firing to bursting. Carbachol-induced excitation and bursting were all reversible and could be prevented by combined muscarinic and nicotinic antagonism. [...] The synaptic blocker cocktail containing 100 μM APV (NMDA receptor blocker), 10 μM CNQX (AMPA receptor blocker) and 100 μM picotoxin (GABAA receptor blocker) did not alter carbachol's effect on neuronal excitability and bursting. In addition, a small proportion of dopamine cells were spontaneously bursting in the slice. The characteristics of these bursts were very similar to those induced by carbachol. Both spontaneous and carbachol-induced bursting could be blocked by the non-selective Ca²⁺ channel blocker cadmium and the L-type Ca²⁺ channel blocker nifedipine, while blocking the T-type Ca²⁺ channels did not have any effect on bursting. Spontaneous and induced bursting occurred on a slow, large amplitude membrane oscillation or <b>hump</b> <b>potential</b> which was dependent on Ca²⁺ entry through voltage-gated Ca²⁺ channels, and more specifically through the L-type Ca²⁺ channels. [...] In summary, the present investigation provides evidence that cholinergic excitation of dopamine cells is mainly postsynaptic. More importantly, cholinergic activation can serve as a trigger that switches the firing mode of dopamine cells and promotes burst firing. Burst firing induced as such is dependent on Ca²⁺ entry through the L-type Ca²⁺ channels, suggesting a new target for modulating the central dopamine system...|$|R
