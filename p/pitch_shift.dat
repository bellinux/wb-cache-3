40|$|The {{integration}} of nonsimultaneous frequency components {{into a single}} virtual pitch was investigated by using a pitch matching task in which a mistuned 4 th harmonic (mistuned component) produced <b>pitch</b> <b>shifts</b> in a harmonic series (12 equal-amplitude harmonics of a 155 -Hz F 0). In experiment 1, the mistuned component could either be simultaneous, stop as the target started (pre-target component), or start as the target stopped (post-target component). <b>Pitch</b> <b>shifts</b> produced by the pre-target components were significantly smaller than those obtained with simultaneous components; in the post-target condition, the size of <b>pitch</b> <b>shifts</b> did not decrease relative to the simultaneous condition. In experiment 2, a silent gap of 20, 40, 80, or 160 ms was introduced between the nonsimultaneous components and the target sound. In the pre-target condition, <b>pitch</b> <b>shifts</b> were reduced to zero for silent gaps of 80 ms or longer; by contrast, a gap of 160 ms was required to eliminate <b>pitch</b> <b>shifts</b> in the post-target condition. The third experiment tested the hypothesis that, when post-target components were presented, the processing of the pitch of the target tone started {{at the onset of}} the target, and ended at the gap duration at which <b>pitch</b> <b>shifts</b> decreased to zero. This hypothesis was confirmed by the finding that <b>pitch</b> <b>shifts</b> could not be observed when the target tone had a duration of 410 ms. Taken together, the results of these experiments show that nonsimultaneous components that occur after the onset of the target sound make a larger contribution to the virtual pitch of the target, and over a longer period, than components that precede the onset of the target sound. © 1999 Acoustical Society of America. published_or_final_versio...|$|R
30|$|Since {{conditions}} are not ideal {{in the real}} world, {{it is common for}} audio signals to be affected by various types of audio distortion. <b>Pitch</b> <b>shifting,</b> time stretching and time scaling are some difficult distortions for music identification to resist. <b>Pitch</b> <b>shifting</b> causes the spectrogram image to remain the same on the time axis, but the frequency component is just translated vertically (up or down). Time stretching causes the time axis to lengthen or shorten while the frequency axis remains constant on the spectrogram. Time scaling can be classified as the combination of <b>pitch</b> <b>shifting</b> and time stretching.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. The {{real-time}} <b>pitch</b> <b>shifting</b> {{process is}} widely used in various types of music production. The <b>pitch</b> <b>shifting</b> technology {{can be divided into}} two major types, the time domain type and the frequency domain type. Compared with the time domain method, the frequency domain method has the advantage of large shifting scale, low total cost of computing and the more flexibility of the algorithm. However, the use of Fourier Transform in frequency domain processing leads to the inevitable inherent frequency leakage effects which decrease the accuracy of the <b>pitch</b> <b>shifting</b> effect. In order to restrain the side effect of Fourier Transform, window functions are used to fall down the spectrum-aliasing. In practical processing, Haimming Window and Blackman Window are frequently used. In this paper, we compare both the effect of the two window functions in the restraint of frequency leakage and the performance and accuracy in subjective based on the traditional phase vocoder[1]. Experiment shows that Haimming Window is generally better than Blackman Window in <b>pitch</b> <b>shifting</b> process...|$|R

50|$|Although both {{instruments}} are tuned normally to a diatonic scale, on slower pieces, accidentals {{can be created}} by sharping individual notes.

The pedal can be set to momentarily jump shift the entire instrument's tuning one-half step up or down, or it can be set on continuous <b>pitch</b> <b>shift</b> change which enables playing the instrument in dobro, slide guitar, or pedal steel guitar styles.|$|E
