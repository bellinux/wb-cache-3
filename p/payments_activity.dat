40|$|Electronic {{payments}} {{have become}} a prominent feature of the U. S. economic landscape, as consumers, businesses, and governments have increasingly used electronic instruments to make retail payments. Survey research by the Federal Reserve published in 2002, for example, indicates {{that the use of}} debit and credit cards and automatic deposit and withdrawal (via the automated clearinghouse) grew fivefold from 1979 to 2000 and that the use of paper checks for payments probably peaked in the mid- 1990 s. Over the past decade especially, developers have experimented with new ways of making electronic payments. As with many innovations, {{only a small number of}} these new methods of payment have enjoyed commercial success. Nevertheless, developers' inclination to expand the range of options and techniques for making electronic payments has been consistent with the long-term direction of <b>payments</b> <b>activity</b> in the United States.; The Federal Reserve's Payments System Development Committee is concerned about regulatory and operational barriers to innovation that may inhibit the long-term development of the payments system. Accordingly, the committee asked Federal Reserve staff to seek the views of the private sector and other interested parties on developments in payments, clearing, and settlement services, focusing on potential barriers to further innovation and the implications of new technologies for the design and function of payments systems. The staff study "The Future of Retail Electronic Payments Systems: Industry Interviews and Analysis" presents highlights of interviews with representatives of forty-nine organizations and discusses areas in which, in the committee's opinion, the Federal Reserve and other organizations may be able to foster, or help reduce barriers to, innovation in the payments system. The study also provides a more detailed account of the discussions with industry representatives and the recommendations they made.; The study presents nine key issues [...] including settlement timing and standards [...] and accompanying recommendations. No single issue was consistently identified, no single recommendation was made by a significant number of interviewees, and, with a few exceptions, no fundamental problems with or barriers to innovation in existing clearing and settlement arrangements were noted. These results should not, however, be interpreted as satisfaction with the status quo. Rather, they point to the complexity and difficulty of innovation. The results also highlight the need to identify and address barriers to innovation, where appropriate, and to monitor closely clearing and settlement arrangements to ensure that they evolve in ways that support safe and efficient payments today and in the future.

40|$|Real-time gross {{settlement}} (RTGS) {{systems such as}} CHAPS Sterling require large amounts of liquidity to support <b>payment</b> <b>activity.</b> To meet their liquidity needs, RTGS participants borrow from the central bank or rely on incoming payments from other participants. Both options can prove costly [...] the latter in particular if participants delay outgoing payments until incoming ones arrive. This article presents an empirical analysis of the timing and funding of payments in CHAPS. The authors seek to identify the factors driving the intraday profile of <b>payment</b> <b>activity</b> {{and the extent to}} which incoming funds are used as a funding source, a process known as liquidity recycling. They show that the level of liquidity recycling in CHAPS is high and stable throughout the day, and attribute this result to several features of the system. First, the settlement of time-critical payments provides liquidity to the system early in the settlement day; this liquidity can be recycled for the funding of less urgent payments. Second, CHAPS throughput guidelines provide a centralised coordination mechanism, in effect limiting any tendency toward payment delay. Third, the relatively small direct membership of CHAPS facilitates coordination between members, for example, through the use of bilateral net sender limits. Coordination encourages banks to maintain a relatively constant flux of payments throughout the day. The authors also argue that the high level of recycling helps to reduce liquidity risk, and that the relatively smooth intraday distribution of payments serves to mitigate operational risk associated with highly concentrated <b>payment</b> <b>activity.</b> They note, however, that the benefits of liquidity recycling are not evenly distributed between members of CHAPS.

40|$|This paper {{develops}} {{a model of}} bank reserve management and federal funds rate determination that incorporates the role of interbank payments. In the model, uncertainty in the receipt of payments generates a precautionary demand for bank reserves as banks face both reserve requirements and penalties for overnight overdrafts. Days with higher payment volume are assumed to create more uncertainty in a bank's reserve account that accentuates this precautionary motive. As a result, upward pressure {{is placed on the}} equilibrium funds rate. Implications of the model are then estimated using a panel of large banking institutions. Using the parameter estimates, simulations of the model suggest that patterns in <b>payment</b> <b>activity</b> explain many intra-maintenance period movements in both the level and volatility of the federal funds rate.

This heightened visibility raises several questions. In which <b>payments</b> <b>activities</b> are nonbanks engaged? What roles do nonbanks play in specific payments types? What types of risk are potentially associated with nonbank participation? This paper begins to address these questions. Preliminary findings include: (1) Nonbanks are involved in a myriad of activities and roles, both in traditional and emerging payments types; (2) Nonbank business relationships with banks and other participants in the payments systems are often highly complex and interrelated; (3) Nonbanks are rarely directly involved in settlement activities and, hence, appear to be associated with limited settlement and systemic risk; (4) Both nonbanks and banks appear to be increasingly susceptible to operational risk factors.; Published as a book in 2003.

Although it is con-cluded that the Dutch retail payment market as a whole showed strong dynamic potential in terms of product and process innovations over the last decade, some parts of the payment services industry have recently attracted controversy and antitrust scrutiny. These market imperfections touch upon transparancy of pricing consumer payment services, infrastructural arrangements, organisation of the Dutch debit card network, and accessibility of retail payment systems. In the second part of this article, these imperfections will be studied within a theoretic framework.

Among G- 10 central banks, different combinations of prices, collateral, and quantity limits have been chosen to manage the supply of intraday credit.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} how {{recent changes in}} the U.

Since 1990, reductions in statutory reserve requirements have significantly reduced {{the importance of the}} requirements as a constraint on the deposit and lending behavior of banks and other depository institutions. During the same period, depositories' interbank <b>payments</b> <b>activities</b> have come to determine most, if not all of their, demand for Federal Reserve Bank deposits. Our analysis suggests that measures of the monetary source base should be broadened to include all Federal Reserve deposits held by domestic depository institutions rather than just those deposits available to satisfy statutory reserve requirements, and that adjustments for the effects of changes in reserve requirements must recognize that many depositories' behavior is not affected by such requirements.

40|$|We {{study the}} {{liquidity}} demand of large settlement {{banks in the}} UK and its eect on the Sterling Money Markets {{before and during the}} sub-prime crisis of 2007 - 08. Liquidity holdings of large settlement banks experienced on average a 30 % increase in the period immediately following 9 th August, 2007, the day when money markets froze, igniting the crisis. Following this structural break, settlement bank liquidity had a precautionary nature in that it rose on calendar days with a large amount of <b>payment</b> <b>activity</b> and for banks with greater credit risk. We establish that the liquidity demand by settlement banks caused overnight inter-bank rates to rise, an eect virtually absent in the pre-crisis period. This liquidity eect on inter-bank rates occurred in both unsecured borrowing as well as borrowing secured by UK government bonds. Further, the eect was more strongly linked to lender risk than to borrower risk. ...|$|R
40|$|At present, {{electronic}} <b>payment</b> <b>activities</b> {{constructed on}} the Internet mainly employ the certificate-based public key cryptosystems to solve related security issues. But {{it is based}} on the condition that the certificate authority (CA) must be honest and needs to manage the key directory. Furthermore, it needs to spend extra time to verify the signature signed in the digital certificate by the CA. For the considerations of efficiency, a secure electronic payment system proposed in this paper is developed by using elliptic curve cryptosystems (ECC) instead of modular exponentiation schemes, because ECC possess fewer bits achieving the same security level as other public key cryptosystems. In this paper we have designed a session key exchange scheme and a blind signature scheme for the e-cash based payment systems using the self-certified public key cryptosystems based on ECC. In summary, the proposed efficient self-certified public key cryptosystems make the on-line electronic payment system securely workable.

40|$|Analysis of the {{characteristics}} and structure {{of a network of}} financial institutions can provide insight into the complex relationships and interdependencies that exist in a payment, clearing, and settlement system (PCSS), and allow an intuitive understanding of the PCSS's efficiency, stability, and resiliency. The authors review the literature related to the PCSS network and describe the daily and intraday network structure of <b>payment</b> <b>activity</b> in the Large Value Transfer System (LVTS), which is an integral component of Canada's financial system. The picture that emerges confirms that the LVTS is highly centralized among a few key participants, similar to other PCSSs, based on the network of relationships. This could heighten the systemic importance of these participants, and the susceptibility of the system to financial contagion. There have been small variations in the relative importance of individual banks, but the network-wide pattern of relationships has remained stable from 2004 to 2008, even through the credit crisis.

This gap is illustrated by a critical appraisal of literature relating to the sociology of money, the adoption of information and communication technologies and self-service technologies. The paper argues that bank-marketing professionals adopt an activity-centred social marketing strategy. This strategy places customers and their activities at the centre to help ensure a fit between <b>payment</b> <b>activities,</b> services, and values relating to money within different cultural contexts. The strategy has managerial implications for, when payments services are tracked according to customers and activities, the data required are different from data generated by following customer segments and products.

40|$|This paper uncovers {{trends in}} payment timing in Canada's Large Value Transfer System (LVTS) from 2003 to 2011. Descriptive {{analysis}} shows that LVTS <b>payment</b> <b>activity</b> {{has not been}} peaking {{in the late afternoon}} since 2008, and the improvement was most significant in 2009. Ordinary least squares regressions are conducted to identify various factors that might have contributed to the changes in the payment value time distribution. The main findings include that a larger proportion of high-value payments results in later payment submission and hence settlement; as an important source of intraday liquidity, a higher CDSX payout value tends to speed up LVTS transactions. Several changes in the system parameters - such as increases in the frequencies of the Jumbo algorithm and Jumbo queue expiry - also quickened the settlement. In addition, the results suggest that the temporary exceptional liquidity initiatives introduced in late 2008 and a large increase in settlement balances were major contributors to the earlier settlement of LVTS payments...|$|R

40|$|Recent {{approaches}} to modeling the client's payment-scheduling problem allow {{the client to}} control both the timing of payments and the completion times of activities. In practice, the activity schedule is typically determined by the contractor rather than the client. This paper addresses this drawback by considering a model in which the client selects the <b>payment</b> <b>activities</b> and the contractor selects the activity schedule, each to maximize his own net present value (NPV). In addition, the contractor has the option to reject the project {{if it does not}} provide a minimum NPV. The new model is shown to be NP-hard in the strong sense and a branch-and-bound procedure is provided for its solution. Results are obtained for the new model that contradict those of the older models.

Furthermore, it is no longer ideal for the client to focus payments {{at the beginning and end}} of the project.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to quantify the contagion effect of an operational incident occurring at one ARTIS participant’s site on the <b>payment</b> <b>activity</b> of the other ARTIS participants. We used model simulations to focus on operational problems occurring at one of the participants, not an operational failure of the ARTIS platform itself. The scenarios are designed according to an ex-ante estimation of potential risk concentrations based on actual data for the sample period (Schmitz et al., 2006). The main conclusion from the simulations was that the contagion effect in ARTIS is low on condition that the existing business continuity arrangements prove effective. However, this is a very restrictive assumption. Without the use of business continuity arrangements or if they turn out to be not fully effective, the contagion effect on the smooth functioning of the payment system was substantial in all three scenarios. In contrast to the most common approach described in the literature, we used actual (instead of simulated) liquidity data to study the contagion effect at the individual bank level as well as at the aggregate level of unsettled payments. A non-negligible number of banks failed to settle payments in all three scenarios. The paper also provides results on two features of large-value payment systems that have hitherto gone unstudied in the literature: the stop-sending rule and debit authorization.

40|$|One of the Federal Reserve's roles is {{to provide}} payment {{services}} to depository institutions and to the U. S. Treasury. Many of the nation's transfers of funds [...] whether they are large-dollar payments for financial market transactions or small-value business and consumer payments [...] settle through depository institutions' accounts held at the Federal Reserve for reserve-maintenance purposes and transaction processing. If a depository institution has insufficient balances during the day to cover its debits, it will run a negative balance or "daylight overdraft" in its Federal Reserve account until sufficient funds are received later in the day. Because depository institutions generally hold a relatively small amount of funds overnight in their Federal Reserve accounts {{in relation to the}} trillions of dollars of payments processed by the Federal Reserve each day, the Federal Reserve extends intraday credit to ensure the smooth functioning of the U. S. payment system. To reduce the risks that depository institutions present to the Federal Reserve through their use of daylight credit and to address the risks that payment systems, in general, present to the banking system and other sectors of the economy, the Federal Reserve Board in 1985 developed a payments system risk (PSR) policy. One of the primary goals of the PSR policy is to control depository institutions' use of Federal Reserve intraday credit, and as the policy has evolved, the Board has adopted specific methods for controlling daylight overdrafts.
