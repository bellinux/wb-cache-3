5|$|The {{last chapter}} {{of the body of}} the book – if Chapter 10 is {{considered}} more or less an epilogue – covers towns seen as part of the English landscape. Hoskins justifies this on the grounds that understanding towns brings pleasure. He describes in turn planned towns, the open-field town, and the market town. Towns were planned as early as Norman times, Abbot Baldwin planning Bury St Edmunds between 1066 and 1086; Stratford-on-Avon was laid out in 1196. Another burst of town planning came with the spa towns in the late 18th century, and of new industrial towns like Middlesbrough and Barrow-in-Furness in the mid 19th century. Open-field towns like Nottingham, Leicester, and Stamford grew naturally in their own open fields, but were trapped by <b>pasture</b> <b>rights</b> from growing in the 19th century, giving Nottingham slums, and Leicester a problem that it just managed to solve, growing across its fields: while Stamford stopped growing entirely, becoming fossilised as what Hoskins calls a museum piece of a beautiful 17th and 18th century town. Finally, the market towns like Marlborough grew up around their often large and handsome market places, which are however of any number of shapes.|$|E

Most of the tenants were Fadl tribesmen who had shifted from a nomadism to a semi-sedentism that combined agriculture and grazing. The emir, who resided in Damascus, was in effect an absentee landlord, and he and his immediate family became wealthy members of the Damascene social elite. The emir married a woman from the well-known Kurdish Damascene family, Buzu. Some Kurdish families, including the Buzu, were afterward incorporated into Al Fadl.

25|$|Camel caravans, said to {{have first}} been used by Muhammad's great-grandfather, were {{a major part of}} Mecca's bustling economy. Alliances were struck between the merchants in Mecca and the local nomadic tribes, who would bring goods – leather, livestock, and metals mined in the local {{mountains}} – to Mecca to be loaded on the caravans and carried to cities in Syria and Iraq. Historical accounts also provide some indication that goods from other continents may also have flowed through Mecca. Goods from Africa and the Far East passed through en route to Syria including spices, leather, medicine, cloth, and slaves; in return Mecca received money, weapons, cereals and wine, which in turn were distributed throughout Arabia. The Meccans signed treaties with both the Byzantines and the Bedouins, and negotiated safe passages for caravans, giving them water and <b>pasture</b> <b>rights.</b> Mecca became the center of a loose confederation of client tribes, which included those of the Banu Tamim. Other regional powers such as the Abyssinian, Ghassan, and Lakhm were in decline leaving Meccan trade to be the primary binding force in Arabia in the late 6th century.|$|E

5000|$|From {{the medieval}} era, a Graf usually ruled a {{territory}} {{known as a}} Grafschaft (county). In the Holy Roman Empire, many Imperial counts (Reichsgrafen) retained near-sovereign authority in their lands until the Congress of Vienna subordinated them to larger, neighboring monarchs through the German mediatisation process of 1815, preserving their precedence, allocating familial representation in local legislatures, some jurisdictional immunities and the prestigious privilege of Ebenbürtigkeit. In regions of Europe where nobles did not actually exercise Landeshoheit, or sovereignty over the populace, the Graf long retained specific feudal privileges over the land and in the villages in his county, such as rights to peasant service, to periodic fees for use of common infrastructure such as timber, mills, wells and <b>pastures.</b> These <b>rights</b> gradually eroded and were largely eliminated before or during the 19th century, leaving the Graf with few legal privileges beyond land ownership, although comital estates in German-speaking lands were often substantial.

40|$|Despite {{programmes}} {{for rural}} land reform and redistribution around the world, inequitable land distribution and rural poverty remain profound {{in much of}} the rural South. This paper suggests a new approach to land reform and rural development. “Rural territorial development” (RTD) is based on and encourages shared territorial identity (distinctive productive,historical, cultural and environmental features) amongst different stakeholders and socialgroupings. It builds on the fact that rural people’s livelihood strategies are complex and often mostly non-agricultural in nature. It works by (1) promoting collaboration between different sectoral agencies, levels and administrative units of government, and with civil society and private sector actors, within distinctive geographical spaces; and (2) creating new, inclusive multi-stakeholder fora for participatory development planning and implementation at the meso scale—working across groupings of local municipalities, which are often too small on their own to drive economic development. The paper presents case studies of RTD approaches in Brazil and South Africa. It finds that a territorial approach to land reform could potentially: • Strengthen land reform groups over wider areas by creating platforms to secure institutional support, improve productivity, tackle collective marketing needs, and negotiate with private sector interests. • Support a more integrated approach to diverse and overlapping issues of tenure security, access to seasonal <b>pasture,</b> indigenous <b>rights,</b> land expropriation and restitution, and market based land access. • Improve co-ordination among and more responsive prioritisation by state agencies. • Improve service delivery and agricultural support to land reform communities, with better prioritisation of scarce resources for social and physical infrastructure. • Create shared platforms whereby diverse social groups can debate and agree on visions and practical priorities to help steer government interventions. The Brazilian and South African experiences are at a very early stage; a variety of institutional and political problems still remain. Despite its potential, RTD is no magic bullet. The main lessons identified by the studies include that: • Follow-up development and agricultural support is needed, delivered within a more integrated, decentralised approach involving government agencies, social movements and other rural development actors. • Investing in new territorial institutional frameworks and processes can help reconcile divergent interests. New territorial institutions are needed, with legal powers and capacity to manage delivery of strategic development projects on the ground. • A genuinely enabling national policy framework for RTD will overcome weak participation by parochial local municipalities, the private sector and sectoral, top-down government agencies...|$|R
25|$|The {{population}} of Nuristan is ethnically {{distinct from the}} rest of Afghanistan, and divided into four major groups, the Kom, Kata, Kushtoz, and Kalasha. These subgroups were in turn divided into different clans and sects of the Islamic religion, depending on lineages and the interpretations of individual religious leaders. These groups could clash violently over water <b>rights,</b> <b>pasture,</b> and religious beliefs. Five different languages and various dialects are spoken by these groups, making translators from other areas of Afghanistan useless. The Soviets had to contend with a rebel group known as the Dawlet of eastern Nuristan. They were professing a Salafi version of Islam, and hostile to any political rivals. The Nuristanis had resisted Islam as late as the year 1895 and before that had been considered a nation of infidels with a long tradition of violently resisting outsiders, their beliefs, and their invasions. Resistance in Nuristan revolved around a specific group of Islamic fighters known as Hezb-e-Islami Gulbuddin or HIG. During the Soviet occupation HIG received more support from the CIA than any other Mujahideen resistance group. When it came to infiltration from Pakistan, and setting up ambushes, HIG was regarded as the most skillful. In 2006 HIG was actively resisting the Afghan government. When Captain Aaron Swain of Cherokee Co. had sounded out Afghan Border Police Commander Ahmed Shah about setting up near Kamdesh, he was told that HIG insurgents tried to blow up Shah’s jeep on his last trip there and it was a bad place.|$|R
