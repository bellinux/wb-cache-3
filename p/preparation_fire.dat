40|$|Fire {{suppression}} {{effectiveness of}} a new kind of dry powder based on potassium bicarbonate was studied in this paper. The powder consisted of superfine potassium bicarbonate and some organic and inorganic additives, which was denoted as 'K-powder'. The physical and chemical characteristics of the K-powder were characterized by a series of techniques of X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy, Fourier transforms infrared (FTIR) and thermal gravity analysis, etc. Performance of the new potassium-based powder in fire suppression was studied by laboratory-scale experiments, which exhibited much superior fire suppression efficacy than that of the commercial bicarbonate powder. Such improvements could be reasonably ascribed to the special chemical composition, microstructure and radiation effect on the mechanisms. The <b>preparation,</b> <b>fire</b> suppression and possible fire-extinguishing mechanisms were studied in detail. Department of Building Services Engineerin...|$|E

40|$|There are {{insufficient}} data on forest {{fires in the}} Gambia because of inadequate staffing at the field level and the unwillingness of the population to expose fire offenders for prosecution. It is clear, however, {{that most of the}} country’s forest lands are burnt annually. The resulting losses are huge considering the incalculable amounts of timber and fuelwood destroyed and the low agricultural productivity resulting from soil degradation. The use of fire is intrinsic in the socio-economic activities of the rural population. Because {{of the nature of the}} farming system (small-scale and temporal) and the absence of other appropriate means of land <b>preparation,</b> <b>fire</b> is usually resorted to as a way of preparing fields for crop cultivation. Consequently, a significant number of forest fires result from field clearing, because control over these fires was and is still generally lacking. Other traditional causes of forest fires are hunting, honey collection, herding, fuelwood collection and smoking. State control over the ownership of forest resources caused the general public to have a laissez-faire attitude towards forest fires, especially in the past, when fire prevention and control were seen as the responsibility of the Forestry Department. Following political independence in 1965, government policies put a lot of emphasis on economic development, mainly through th...|$|E
40|$|The {{subject of}} the study is a {{functional}} analysis of the settlements in the valley of the Lower Habur dating to {{the first half of the}} third millennium. In Chapter 1 the geo-climatic conditions of the region and the research history as well as the results of the latest research and the aims of the study are presented. The mostly unpublished results of the salvage excavations at Tall Knedig serve as the fundamental basis for the interpretation of the settlement functions (Chapter 2). The excavations brought to light 14 architectural units, including some storage buildings (three round silos and one multicellular building). In the houses many installations and objects were found which indicate domestic activities like food <b>preparation</b> (<b>fire</b> places, tannours, grinding stones) and also storing (pits, chambers or storage jars). The economic analysis has shown that the households from Tall Knedig had an agricultural background, indicators for craft specialization, however, could not be proven. The storage structures suggest that most households could either store their yearly requirements of grain or even had capacity for some reserves. A few storage facilities had clearly more capacity then was used for the needs of their associated households. Bricked-up entrances as well as other features lead to the assumption that some of the inhabitants of Tall Knedig used their houses only seasonally. The settlement was surrounded by a massive brick wall during the first half of the third millennium. In Chapter 3 all other excavated sites of the Lower Habur region with traces of occupation from the era are discussed. Aside from Tall Knedig twelve settlements - partly with extensive storage facilities - were excavated. From the inventory of some of these so called store rooms it is concluded that not all of them were used exclusively for storage purposes. To get a more precise picture of the relations between these settlements it was necessary to develop a regional chronological framework for the first half of the third millennium (Chapter 4). The sequence of the pottery and other characteristics permit a subdivision in three phases. Moreover it is outlined how the urban centres of the adjacent regions correspond with these chronological phases. In Chapter 5 the settlements in the Lower Habur valley, recorded during two survey seasons by the Tübinger Atlas des Vorderen Orients, are analysed. The surface material indicates that nine further sites - in addition to the excavated settlements - were occupied during the first half of the third millennium. The material of a number of sites provides no clear evidence for settlement activities. Most of the settlements along the river valley were small villages of less than one ha in size, whereas only one larger village (Tall Knedig, 3 ha) and one small town (Tall Bderi, 6 ha) could be identified. The vast majority of the sites were situated in the northern part of the Lower Habur region. In the southern river valley only a few settlements were located - at a long but equal distance from each other. The study of the sites has shown that their subsistence, based on farming, livestock (including seasonally migratory herders) and hunting, was to a high degree dependent on the ecological conditions. These were (and still are) characterized by variabilities which caused to a certain degree a flexibility in the economical behaviour. This is reflected to some extent by the numerous storage facilities. There are so far no indications for the assumption, that the rural sites in the Lower Habur valley were tied to large urban centres outside the region...|$|E

The final version of this article may be found at [URL] (login may be required). The version made available in OpenBU was supplied by the author. Excavations of a kitchen at Escalera al Cielo in the Puuc Maya region of Yucatán, Mexico uncovered a concentration of fired clay balls (ca. 3 – 5 cm in diameter), in addition to other de facto domestic refuse. The kitchen pertains to an intensively excavated elite residential group that was rapidly abandoned sometime {{near the end of the}} Terminal Classic period (A.

The results of experimental replications and a suite of analyses comprising modal analysis, ceramic petrography, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), and microbotanical residue analysis reveal aspects of clay <b>preparation,</b> <b>firing</b> temperatures, repeated use of the balls, firing conditions, and specific plant food or fuel residues adhering to them. We show that the fired clay balls were manufactured with local, clay-rich soil and employed by the inhabitants of Escalera al Cielo as heating elements; relatively high concentrations of microbotanical residues from edible plants adhering to them support the hypothesis that they were involved in kitchen activities related to food processing...|$|R

40|$|We have {{investigated}} the pattern of neuronal activity involved in the gradual return of sensory-evoked abdominal flexions in crayfish with chronically transected nerve cords. Recordings were made from eight types of identified neurone that mediate phasic abdominal movements, in a preparation consisting of the isolated abdominal nerve cord and tailfan. Responses of the cells to pinches and dorsiflexions of the tailfan were compared in two groups of animals: animals whose cords had been cut at the thoracic-abdominal junction 4 - 17 weeks earlier (chronic preparations), and animals whose cords had been cut at the same site either just before the experiment or up to 6 days earlier (acute preparations). Sensory stimuli produced bursts of spikes in 73 % of the fast flexor motoneurones impaled in chronic <b>preparations,</b> but never <b>fired</b> these neurones in acute preparations. However, fast flexor motoneurones in both <b>preparations</b> were <b>fired</b> with approximately equal frequency by single impulses in the giant axons, suggesting that the firing thresholds of these motoneurones had not changed. Sensory stimuli also caused spiking in the extensor inhibitor and the flexor inhibitor in chronic preparations; in contrast, responses in the fast extensor motoneurones were always subthreshold and occasionally hyperpolarizing. None of these cells was fired by similar stimuli in acute preparations. Neurones restricted to the giant axon pathways (lateral, medial, segmental and motor giants) were silent during sensory-evoked flexor discharges in chronically transected cords. Flexor discharges were accompanied by intense activity in non-giant axons recorded from the dorsal cord. Two identified, non-giant interneurones with axons in the dorsal cord were substantially depolarized but never fired by sensory input in chronic <b>preparations.</b> Sensory-evoked <b>firing</b> in the fast flexor motoneurones was not abolished by removal of the posterior stump of the nerve cord at the transection site. About 20 % of chronic preparations generated cyclic motor output in response to unpatterned sensory stimulation. The pattern of motor activity that develops in chronically transected cords resembles that seen in normal crayfish during non-giant tailflips. Because cord transection permanently isolates the abdomen from rostral neural centres normally required for the generation of such tailflips, the return of co-ordinated motor output in chronically cut cords may result from the sensory activation of non-giant circuitry within the abdominal nervous system...|$|R
