An l 1 -constrained minimization problem is formulated to find demixing filter coefficients for source separation while capturing scaling invariance and sparseness of solutions. The minimization aims to reduce (lagged) cross correlations of the mixture signals, which are modeled stochastically. The problem is non-convex, however it is put in a nonlinear least squares form where the robust and convergent Levenberg-Marquardt iterative method is applicable to compute local minimizers. Efficiency is achieved in recovering lower dimensional demixing filter solutions than the physical ones. Computations on recorded and synthetic mixtures show satisfactory performance, and are compared with other iterative methods. Key words.

Mais precisamente, um dos objetivos é mostrar, no contexto da mecânica lagrangeana, que se há um split da energia potencial em uma parte no plano cujo jato k mostra que ela não tem mínimo no ponto de equilíbrio e existe o jato k- 1 do seu gradiente, e a outra em R^ que tenha mínimo no ponto de equilíbrio, este é instável. A instabilidade do ponto de equilíbrio em estudo é provada mostrando a existência de uma trajetória assintótica ao mesmo. Para isso, apresentamos um resultado inicial para lagrangeanos com uma forma bem específica e, a seguir, mostramos que a classe de lagrangeanos que descrevemos acima pode ser levada a esta forma, através de uma adequada mudança de coordenadas espaciais.

40|$|The {{geometric}} {{evolution of}} brittle fault systems in inverted oblique and offset rift systems has been simulated using scaled sandbox analogue models. Dry fine-grained quartz sand {{was used to}} represent the brittle upper crust. Extensional faults geometries in the models were governed by the geometry and orientation of a stretch-ing zone {{at the base of}} the models. Oblique rift models were characterized by segmented en-echelon border fault systems trending parallel to the rift axis and the underlying zone of basement stretching. Offset rift models promoted highly-segmented border faults as well as offset sub-basins within the rift. In both types of models, intra-rift fault arrays were oriented sub-perpendicular to the extension direction. Inversion of the oblique and offset extensional models was achieved by horizontal shortening. This resulted in <b>partial</b> <b>inversion</b> of the border and intra-rift faults as well as the formation of new reverse faults. The geometries, distribution, orientations and number of these new reverse faults were strongly controlled by the earlier-formed fault extensional architec-tures. At the margins of the rift zone, shortening was mainly accommodated by <b>partial</b> <b>inversion</b> of the border faults together with the formation of hanging-wall bypass faults and footwall shortcut thrusts. Inversion of the offset rift models produced reactivation of the extensional accommodation zones as soft-linked transfer zones between new thrust faults. The analogue model results have been compared with natural inversion structures in the Atlas Mountains of Morocco and the Ukrainian Donbas fold belt. The analogue modelling results suggest that the High Atlas formed as the result of oblique inversion of an oblique rift system, and the contractional structures in the Ukranian Donbas belt were generated by <b>partial</b> <b>inversion</b> of the earlier-formed Donbas exten-sional graben via two major newly developed short-cuts that uplifted and exhumed the basin.

Field dependence (rod-and-frame test vertical) was tested under conditions of inversion and noninversion. Significantly greater field dependence was observed for subjects exposed to complete inversion rotation of the rod-and-frame configuration in the experimental period than for subjects exposed to rotation without <b>inversion,</b> <b>partial</b> rod-and-frame <b>inversion</b> rotation, or inversion rotation without a frame. The change in field dependence was not significantly affected by 10 minutes of active experience with inversion, and no significant aftereffects were observed. The results are interpreted {{in terms of the}} effect of conflict on perceptual-cognitive decentering. Implications for perceptual adaptation and personality theory are discussed. One of the immediate experimental effects of inverting the visual field is a sense {{of loss of}} control over what is being seen. The experienced synchrony between self-movement and the perceived constancy of the visual world is altered, and the subject often has strong emotional reactions to such changes (Blatt, Quinlan, & D'Afflitti, 1972; Cegalis, 1971).
