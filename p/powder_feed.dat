50|$|During the 1980s, a {{class of}} thermal spray {{processes}} called high velocity oxy-fuel spraying was developed. A mixture of gaseous or liquid fuel and oxygen is fed into a combustion chamber, where they are ignited and combusted continuously. The resultant hot gas at a pressure close to 1 MPa emanates through a converging-diverging nozzle and travels through a straight section. The fuels can be gases (hydrogen, methane, propane, propylene, acetylene, natural gas, etc.) or liquids (kerosene, etc.). The jet velocity at the exit of the barrel (>1000 m/s) exceeds the speed of sound. A <b>powder</b> <b>feed</b> stock is injected into the gas stream, which accelerates the powder up to 800 m/s. The stream of hot gas and powder is directed towards the surface to be coated. The powder partially melts in the stream, and deposits upon the substrate.

Yttria-stabilized Zirconia (YSZ) coating was prepared with vacuum plasma spraying for clarifying the effect of <b>powder</b> <b>feeding</b> instability on coating structure. Optic micro-morphology of coating was obtained for porosity ratio estimation. An imaginary ring of bent tube was proposed for understanding particle behavior when unavoidable bends exist.

According to the calculation, reducing equivalent diameter and increasing carrier gas flowrate have the same effect on powder carrying. A threshold was proposed to understand the slug behavior as: growing, maturity and breaking. Due to the break of slug, ‘powder flooding’ happens and may cause mutation in in-flight particle stream.

The presented work studies the effects of the powder stream on HDR-LMD with Inconel 718. Experiments have been designed and conducted by using different <b>powder</b> <b>feeding</b> nozzles—a three-jet and a coaxial <b>powder</b> <b>feeding</b> nozzle—since the <b>powder</b> stream is mainly determined by the geometry of the <b>powder</b> <b>feeding</b> nozzle. After the deposition trials, metallographic analysis of the samples has been performed. The laser intensity distribution (LID) and the powder stream intensity distribution (PID) have been characterized, based on which the processes have been simulated. Finally, for verifying and correcting the used models for the simulation, the simulated results have been compared with the experimental results. Through the conducted work, suitable boundary conditions for simulating the process with different powder streams has been determined, and the effects of the powder stream on the process have also been determined. For a LMD process with a three-jet nozzle a substantial part of the powder particles that hit the melt pool surface are rebounded; for a LMD process with a coaxial nozzle almost all the particles are caught in the melt pool. This is due to the different particle velocities achieved with the two different nozzles. Moreover, the powder stream affects the heat exchange between the heated particles and the melt pool: a surface boundary condition applies for a powder stream with lower particle velocities, in the experiment provided by a three-jet nozzle, and a volumetric boundary condition applies for a powder stream with higher particle velocities, provided by a coaxial nozzle...|$|R
