40|$|Abstract Imitation can {{be defined}} as the copying of behavior. To a biologist, {{interest}} in imitation is focused on its adaptive value for the survival of the organism, but to a psychologist, the mechanisms responsible for imitation are the most interesting. For psychologists, the most important cases of imitation are those that involve demonstrated behavior that the imitator cannot see when it performs the behavior (e. g., scratching one’s head). Such examples of imitation are sometimes referred to as opaque imitation because they are difficult to account for without positing cognitive mechanisms, such as perspective taking, that most animals have not been acknowledged to have. The present review first identifies various forms of social influence and social learning that do not qualify as opaque imitation, including species-typical mechanisms (e. g., mimicry and contagion), motivational mechanisms (e. g., social facilitation, incentive motivation, transfer of fear), attentional mechanisms (e. g., local enhancement, stimulus enhancement), imprinting, following, observational conditioning, and learning how the environment works (affordance learning). It then presents evidence for different forms of opaque imitation in animals, and identifies characteristics of human imitation that have been <b>proposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>distinguish</b> <b>it</b> from animal imitation. Finally, it examines the role played in opaque imitation by demonstrator reinforcement and observer motivation. Although accounts of imitation have been proposed that var...|$|E
40|$|The glpTQ operon and the glpA and glpB {{genes are}} located {{adjacent}} {{to one another}} near min 49 of the linkage map of Escherichia coli K- 12. The positions and directions of transcription of the glpA and glpB genes {{with respect to the}} glpTQ operon were determined in the present work. Strains harboring Mu d 1 (Ap lac) fusions in either glpA or glpB were converted to the respective lambda p 1 (209) lysogens. Induction of these lysogens with mitomycin C resulted in production of Lac+ phage progeny which carried adjacent chromosomal DNA. Genetic crosses with a collection of glpT mutant strains were performed with several such phage lines. A fine-structure deletion map of the glpT gene was thus constructed. All phages used for this mapping carried DNA starting with the promoter-proximal end of glpT. This indicated that the glpTQ operon and the glpA and glpB genes are transcribed divergently. Additional evidence supporting this conclusion was obtained by physical mapping of restriction endonuclease cleavage sites in plasmids carrying these genes and in plasmids carrying glpA-lacZ or glpB-lacZ fusions. A new designation (glpC) for the gene encoding the 41, 000 -Mr subunit of the anaerobic sn-glycerol- 3 -phosphate dehydrogenase was <b>proposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>distinguish</b> <b>it</b> from the glpA gene, which encodes the 62, 000 -Mr subunit of the dehydrogenase, and the glpB gene, which encodes a membrane anchor subunit of the dehydrogenase. These three genes were present in an operon transcribed in the order glpA glpC glpB in the clockwise direction on the linkage map of E. coli...|$|E
500|$|The Australian magpie {{was first}} {{described}} by English ornithologist John Latham in 1801 as Coracias tibicen, the type {{collected in the}} Port Jackson region. Its specific epithet derived from the Latin tibicen [...] "flute-player" [...] or [...] "piper" [...] {{in reference to the}} bird's melodious call. An early recorded vernacular name is piping poller, written on a painting by Thomas Watling, one of a group known collectively as the Port Jackson Painter, sometime between 1788 and 1792. Tarra-won-nang, or djarrawunang, wibung, and marriyang were names used by the local Eora and Darug inhabitants of the Sydney Basin. Booroogong and garoogong were Wiradjuri words, and carrak was a Jardwadjali term from Victoria. Among the Kamilaroi, it is burrugaabu, galalu, or guluu. It was known as Warndurla among the Yindjibarndi people of the central and western Pilbara. Other names used include piping crow-shrike, piper, maggie, flute-bird and organ-bird. The term bell-magpie was <b>proposed</b> <b>to</b> help <b>distinguish</b> <b>it</b> from the European magpie but failed to gain wide acceptance.|$|R
