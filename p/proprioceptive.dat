5|$|These direct pain inputs, {{as well as}} {{indirect}} inputs, {{are thought}} to induce long-term pain avoidance behavior that results in chronic posture changes and consequently, in functional and anatomical remodeling of vestibular and <b>proprioceptive</b> nuclei. As a result, chronic neuropathic pain can induce macroscopic anatomical remodeling of the hindbrain, including the cerebellum. The magnitude of this remodeling and the induction of neuron progenitor markers suggest the contribution of adult neurogenesis to these changes.|$|E
5|$|The medial {{zone of the}} {{anterior}} and posterior lobes constitutes the spinocerebellum, also known as paleocerebellum. This sector of the cerebellum functions mainly to fine-tune body and limb movements. It receives <b>proprioceptive</b> input from the dorsal columns of the spinal cord (including the spinocerebellar tract) and from the cranial trigeminal nerve, {{as well as from}} visual and auditory systems. It sends fibers to deep cerebellar nuclei that, in turn, project to both the cerebral cortex and the brain stem, thus providing modulation of descending motor systems.|$|E
5|$|The arms contain tension sensors so the octopus {{knows whether}} its arms are {{stretched}} out, {{but this is}} not sufficient for the brain to determine the position of the octopus's body or arms. As a result, the octopus does not possess stereognosis; that is, it does not form a mental image of the overall shape of the object it is handling. It can detect local texture variations, but cannot integrate the information into a larger picture. The neurological autonomy of the arms means the octopus has great difficulty learning about the detailed effects of its motions. It has a poor <b>proprioceptive</b> sense, and it only knows what exact motions were made by observing the arms visually.|$|E
5|$|Ely Rabin and Andrew M. Gordon {{reported}} in 2004 in the Journal of Applied Physiology on {{their use of}} the Magic Wand to create vibrations in the left biceps brachia to study proprioception signals in humans related to fingertip contact on surfaces. Rabin and Gordon followed up their research in 2006 with a subsequent paper published in the journal Experimental Brain Research. They wrote that extension of muscles and sensory clues worked together to provide regional perception of the patient's upper extremity in a localized area. Rabin and Gordon later co-wrote a 2010 paper with additional authors in Neuroscience Letters and expanded on research incorporating use of the Magic Wand to stimulate the biceps brachia. They measured people suffering Parkinson's disease (PD) for <b>proprioceptive</b> ability while their subjects' biceps muscles were stimulated with the vibrator. In 2007, researchers published a paper in the journal Gait & Posture about use of the Magic Wand to help measure balance and postural sway. While testing their subjects' balance while having to deal with simultaneous vibration, the researchers attached one Magic Wand to each leg.|$|E
25|$|In {{the absence}} of CPG, control by brain as it happens in {{complete}} spinal cord injury, sensory feedback {{is very important in}} generating rhythmic locomotion. Firstly, locomotor movements can be initiated or blocked by some <b>proprioceptive</b> afferent inputs. Other work confirmed the importance of hip afferents for locomotor rhythm generation since flexion of the hip will abolish the rhythm whereas extension will enhance it. Secondly, <b>proprioceptive</b> afferents may participate in adapting walking speed, in determining overall cycle duration, and in regulating the structure of the step cycle’s subphases (i.e., swing, stance), which is required for speed adaptation and interlimb coupling. Thirdly, <b>proprioceptive</b> afferents are involved in setting the level of muscle activity through various reflex pathways.|$|E
25|$|Exteroceptive senses are {{senses that}} {{perceive}} the body's own position, motion, and state, known as <b>proprioceptive</b> senses. External senses include the traditional five: sight, hearing, touch, smell and taste, {{as well as}} thermoception (temperature differences) and possibly an additional weak magnetoception (direction). <b>Proprioceptive</b> senses include nociception (pain); equilibrioception (balance); proprioception (a sense of the position and movement of the parts of one's own body).|$|E
25|$|Hallucinations {{can occur}} in any sensory modality—visual, auditory, olfactory, gustatory, tactile, <b>proprioceptive,</b> equilibrioceptive, nociceptive, thermoceptive and chronoceptive.|$|E
25|$|In {{the water}} at neutral buoyancy, the cues of {{position}} received by the kinesthetic, <b>proprioceptive</b> and organic senses are reduced or absent. This effect may be exacerbated by the diver's suit and other equipment.|$|E
25|$|Inferior {{cerebellar}} peduncle integrates <b>proprioceptive</b> info and outputs to the vestibulocerebellum. The peduncle is {{not part}} of the lateral-spinothalamic-tract-pathway; the medulla receives the info and passes it onto the peduncle from elsewhere (see somatosensory system).|$|E
25|$|The resting {{position}} of the temporomandibular joint is not with the teeth biting together. Instead, the muscular balance and <b>proprioceptive</b> feedback allow a physiologic rest for the mandible, an interocclusal clearance or freeway space, which is 2 to 4mm between the teeth.|$|E
25|$|The sensory {{function}} of the trigeminal nerve is to provide tactile, <b>proprioceptive,</b> and nociceptive afference to the face and mouth. Its motor function activates the muscles of mastication, the tensor tympani, tensor veli palatini, mylohyoid and the anterior belly of the digastric.|$|E
25|$|A {{somatosensory}} {{state can}} be divided in a tactile and <b>proprioceptive</b> state and can be represented by a specific neural activation pattern within the somatosensory state map. This state map {{is assumed to be}} located in the somatosensory association cortex (see cerebral cortex, somatosensory system, somatosensory cortex).|$|E
25|$|Kinesthetic, <b>proprioceptive</b> {{and organic}} {{perception}} {{are a major}} part of the sensory feedback making the diver aware of personal position and movement, and in association with the vestibular and visual input, allowing the diver to function effectively in maintaining physical equilibrium and balance in the water.|$|E
25|$|Biofeedback {{therapy for}} facial synkinesis aims to {{increase}} the patient’s awareness of the facial muscle posture and movement. Facial muscles contain few to none intrinsic muscle sensory receptors (used for <b>proprioceptive</b> feedback) and additionally they do not span movable joints and so lack joint receptors (another source for <b>proprioceptive</b> feedback). Thus, biofeedback allows the patient to actively sense the motion of their muscles. The two common forms of biofeedback used are electromyographic feedback and mirror feedback. Electromyographic feedback includes visual EMG signals (coming from facial muscle sites displayed to the patient from a computer {{in the form of}} waveform traces) or auditory signals that indicate strength of muscle contraction. The subsequent role of the patient is to control the movement of undesired muscle during volitional movement by incorporating the information perceived through the EMG. While mirror feedback is a much more basic way of providing the patient feedback on muscle movement, studies have shown that both are very effective options for synkinesis/paresis reduction. Biofeedback is commonly coupled to facial retraining techniques to achieve maximal effectiveness.|$|E
25|$|On {{the other}} hand, the tail's ability to {{function}} as a <b>proprioceptive</b> sensor/modulator has also been investigated. As aforementioned, the tail demonstrates a high degree of muscularization and subsequent innervation that ostensibly collaborate in orienting the organism. Specifically, this is accomplished by coordinated flexion and extension of tail muscles to produce slight shifts in the organism's center of mass, orientation, etc., which ultimately assists it with achieving a state of <b>proprioceptive</b> balance in its environment. Further mechanobiological investigations of the constituent tendons in the tail of the rat have identified multiple factors that influence how the organism navigates its environment with this structure. A particular example is that of a study in which the morphology of these tendons is explicated in detail. Namely, cell viability tests of tendons of the rat's tail demonstrate a higher proportion of living fibroblasts that produce the collagen for these fibers. As in humans, these tendons contain a high density of golgi tendon organs that help the animal assess stretching of muscle in situ and adjust accordingly by relaying the information to higher cortical areas associated with balance, proprioception, and movement.|$|E
25|$|By its nature, body schema {{integrates}} <b>proprioceptive,</b> (the {{sense of}} the relative position of neighbouring parts of one's body), and tactile information to maintain a three-dimensional body representation. However, other sensory information, particularly visual, {{can be in the}} same representation of the body. This simultaneous participation means there are combined representations within the body schema, which suggests the involvement of a process to translate primary information (e.g. visual, tactile, etc.) into a single sensory modality or an abstract, amodal form.|$|E
25|$|REM sleep {{physiology}} and somatic symptoms {{coupled with the}} awareness that one is paralyzed, can generate a variety of psychological symptoms during sleep paralysis, including fear and worry that are aggravated by catastrophic cognitions about the attack. This can activate a fight-flight reaction and panic-like arousal. Consequently, when the person attempts to escape the paralysis, somatic symptoms and arousal are exacerbated, as execution of motor programs {{in the absence of}} dampening <b>proprioceptive</b> feedback can lead to heightened sensations of bodily tightness and pressure, and even pain and spasms in limbs.|$|E
25|$|Proprioception, the {{kinesthetic}} sense, {{provides the}} parietal cortex {{of the brain}} with information on the movement and relative positions of {{the parts of the}} body. Neurologists test this sense by telling patients to close their eyes and touch their own nose with the tip of a finger. Assuming proper <b>proprioceptive</b> function, at no time will the person lose awareness of where the hand actually is, even though it is not being detected by any of the other senses. Proprioception and touch are related in subtle ways, and their impairment results in surprising and deep deficits in perception and action.|$|E
25|$|Spasticity, if present, {{can be very}} important. It is not a {{contraindication}} per se, but severe spasticity must {{be treated}} first depending in which muscle groups it is present. Spascticity can be treated with botox or myotomies. In some cases spastic tone can be useful to facilitate hand grasp and grip. Harmful spasticity that does not respond to medication or surgical treatment is a contraindication. The shoulder muscles, pectoralis major and latissimus dorsi, must be evaluated. The shoulder must not only have good motor condition but also good <b>proprioceptive</b> control. The trophicity and articular condition of the upper limb must also be considered. A poor condition requires a preoperative rehabilitation program.|$|E
25|$|The neural {{control of}} normal sleep {{states and the}} {{relationship}} to narcolepsy are only partially understood. In humans, narcoleptic sleep {{is characterized by a}} tendency to go abruptly from a waking state to REM sleep with little or no intervening non-REM sleep. The changes in the motor and <b>proprioceptive</b> systems during REM sleep have been studied in both human and animal models. During normal REM sleep, spinal and brainstem alpha motor neuron hyperpolarization produces almost complete atonia of skeletal muscles via an inhibitory descending reticulospinal pathway. Acetylcholine {{may be one of the}} neurotransmitters involved in this pathway. In narcolepsy, the reflex inhibition of the motor system seen in cataplexy has features normally seen only in normal REM sleep.|$|E
25|$|It is {{the optic}} tectum {{of the brain}} which {{eventually}} processes these infrared cues. This portion of the brain receives other sensory information as well, most notably optic stimulation, but also motor, <b>proprioceptive</b> and auditory. Some neurons in the tectum respond to visual or infrared stimulation alone; others respond more strongly to combined visual and infrared stimulation, and still others respond only {{to a combination of}} visual and infrared. Some neurons appear to be tuned to detect movement in one direction. It has been found that the snake’s visual and infrared maps of the world are overlaid in the optic tectum. This combined information is relayed via the tectum to the forebrain.|$|E
25|$|Voluntary {{stretches}} to the legs, such as {{the wall}} stretch, condition the hamstrings and the calf muscle to various movements before vigorously working them. But a study has shown that Kinesiology tape gives more promising effect in hamstring extensibility to produce more fluid movement. Thirty previously injured males showed a greater advantage of hamstring extensibility in longer durations with Kinesiology tape, or elastic therapeutic tape. However, they were more advantageous {{in the beginning of}} the exercise with a voluntary, static stretch or <b>proprioceptive</b> neuromuscular facilitation, which are stretching techniques specific to optimize the range of motion of the limb. This shows that stretches do help in the immediate time frames, whereas Kinesiology tape helps in long durations to prevent any future injuries from occurring. The environment and surroundings, such as uneven terrain, can cause the feet to position in an unnatural way, so wearing shoes that can absorb forces from the ground’s impact and allow for stabilizing the feet can prevent some injuries while running as well. Shoes should be structured to allow friction-traction at the shoe surface, space for different foot-strike stresses, or for comfortable, regular arches for the feet.|$|E
25|$|In {{central nervous}} system not all bHLH genes are {{involved}} in neurogenesis because NeuroD and ‘’Math3/NeuroM’’ families are also involved in the neuronal-versus-glial cell fate decision. Another pro-neural family (which includes ‘’math1’’ and ‘’math5’’) {{is essential to the}} development of a small number of neural lineages whereas ‘’math1’’ have also a role in the specification interneuron identity. Cell types that depend on ‘’math1’’ expression belong to the <b>proprioceptive</b> sensory pathway. Bertrand et al. (2002) have confirmed the proneural activity of ‘’mash1’’, ngn1 and ngn2, and possibly math1 and ‘’math5’’ in the mouse. Neurogenesis in the {{central nervous system}} depends on proneural gene inhibition by Notch signaling pathway and the absence of this key regulator results in the premature differentiation of neurons. To maintain neural progenitor cells a regulatory loop takes place between neighboring cells, that involves the lateral inhibition process (see lateral inhibition). In the absence of Lateral inhibition some proneural genes such as ASCL1 or ‘’neuroG’’ are capable of inducing the expression of neuron-specific genes leading to the premature formation of early born-neurons. Ratié and colleagues (2013) comprised that Notch proneural gene network have an important role in cell fate renewal and transition in the mouse.|$|E
25|$|The dynamic {{interactions}} between Spinal cord and sensory input are ensured by modulating transmission in locomotor pathways in a state- and phase-dependent manner. For instance, <b>proprioceptive</b> inputs from extensors can, during stance, adjust {{the timing and}} amplitude of muscle activities of the limbs to the speed of locomotion but be silenced during the swing phase of the cycle. Similarly, skin afferents participate predominantly in the correction of limb and foot placement during stance on uneven terrain, but skin stimuli can evoke different types of responses depending on when they occur within the step cycle. It {{is important to note}} that inputs from the hip appear to play a critical role in spinal locomotion. Experiments on spinal animals showed that when one limb is held with the hip flexed, locomotion on that side stops while the other limb continues walking. However, when the stopped limb is extended at the hip joint to a point normally reached at the end of stance during walking, it suddenly flexes and starts walking again provided that the contralateral limb is a position to accept the weight of the hindquarters. Other work confirmed the importance of hip afferents for locomotor rhythm generation since flexion of the hip will abolish the rhythm whereas extension will enhance it.|$|E
25|$|The {{spinal cord}} {{processes}} and interprets proprioception {{in a manner}} similar to how our visual system processes information. When we view a painting, the brain interprets the total visual field, as opposed to processing each individual pixel of information independently, and then derives an image. At any instant the spinal cord receives an ensemble of information from all receptors throughout the body that signals a <b>proprioceptive</b> “image” that represents time and space, and it computes which neurons to excite next based on the most recently perceived “images.” The importance of the CPG is not simply its ability to generate repetitive cycles, but also to receive, interpret, and predict the appropriate sequences of actions during any part of the step cycle, i.e., state dependence. The peripheral input then provides important information from which the probabilities of a given set of neurons being active at any given time can be finely tuned to a given situation during a specific phase of a step cycle. An excellent example of this is when a mechanical stimulus is applied to the dorsum of the paw of a cat. When the stimulus is applied during the swing phase, the flexor muscles of that limb are excited, and the result is enhanced flexion in order to step over the obstacle that created the stimulus. However, when the same stimulus is applied during stance, the extensors are excited. Thus, the functional connectivity between mechanoreceptors and specific interneuronal populations within the spinal cord varies according to the physiological state. Even the efficacy of the monosynaptic input from muscle spindles to the motor neuron changes readily from one part of the step cycle to another, according to whether a subject is running or walking.|$|E
500|$|Paraná maneuver, {{makes use}} of a <b>proprioceptive</b> reflex to test venous muscle pump induced flow. (<b>Proprioceptive</b> refers to a {{response}} to a perceived stimulus especially with regard to movement and position of the body). A slight push to the waist, triggers a muscle contraction in the leg, in order to maintain posture. This maneuver is very useful for studying deep vein flow and detecting valvular incompetence, mainly at the popliteal vein level, (above the back of the knee). It is used when legs are painful or very edematous (swollen with fluid).|$|E
500|$|Balance and {{equilibrium}} {{depend on}} vestibular function and secondary input from visual, organic, cutaneous, kinesthetic and sometimes auditory senses which are processed {{by the central}} nervous system to provide the sense of balance. Underwater, some of these inputs may be absent or diminished, making the remaining cues more important. Conflicting input may result in vertigo, disorientation and motion sickness. The vestibular sense is [...] essential in these conditions for rapid, intricate and accurate movement. <b>Proprioceptive</b> perception makes the diver aware of personal position and movement, in association with the vestibular and visual input, and allows the diver to function effectively in maintaining physical equilibrium and balance in the water. In the water at neutral buoyancy, the <b>proprioceptive</b> cues of position are reduced or absent. This effect may be exacerbated by the diver's suit and other equipment.|$|E
500|$|Posterior cord syndrome, {{in which}} just the dorsal columns of {{the spinal cord}} are affected, is usually seen in cases of chronic {{myelopathy}} but can also occur with infarction of the posterior spinal artery. [...] This rare syndrome causes the loss of proprioception and sense of vibration {{below the level of}} injury while motor function and sensation of pain, temperature, and touch remain intact. [...] Usually posterior cord injuries result from insults like disease or vitamin deficiency rather than trauma. Tabes dorsalis, due to injury to the posterior part of the spinal cord caused by syphilis, results in loss of touch and <b>proprioceptive</b> sensation.|$|E
500|$|Stratton tried {{variations}} of the experiment {{over the next few}} years. First he wore the glasses for eight days, back at Berkeley. The first day he was nauseated and the inverted landscape felt unreal, but by the second day just his own body position seemed strange, and by day seven, things felt normal. A sense of strangeness returned when the glasses were taken out, though the world looked straight side up; he found himself reaching out with the right hand when he should have used the left, and the other way around. Then he tried the experiment outdoors. [...] He also tried another experiment disrupting the mental link between touch and sight. There he wore a set of mirrors attached to a harness as shown in the figure allowing, and forcing, him to see his body from above. He found the senses adapted in a similar way over three days. His interpretation was that we build up an association between sight and touch by associational learning over a period of time. During certain periods, the disconnect between vision and touch made him feel as if his body was not where his touch and <b>proprioceptive</b> feeling told him it was. This out-of-body experience, caused by an altered but normal sensory perception, vanished when he attended to the issue critically, focusing on the disconnect.|$|E
2500|$|Self-maintenance {{is based}} on [...] "proprioception", or sensing one's own {{internal}} status. In the battery charging example, the robot can tell proprioceptively that its batteries are low and it then seeks the charger. Another common <b>proprioceptive</b> sensor is for heat monitoring. Increased proprioception will be required for robots to work autonomously near people and in harsh environments. Common <b>proprioceptive</b> sensors include thermal, optical, and haptic sensing, {{as well as the}} Hall effect (electric).|$|E
2500|$|Problems with balance {{can occur}} {{when there is}} a {{disruption}} in any of the vestibular, visual, or <b>proprioceptive</b> systems. Abnormalities in balance function may indicate a wide range of pathologies from causes like inner ear disorders, low blood pressure, brain tumors, and brain injury including stroke.|$|E
2500|$|Spinal {{locomotion}} {{results from}} intricate dynamic interactions between a central program in lower thoracolumbar spine and <b>proprioceptive</b> feedback from {{body in the}} absence of central control by brain as in [...] complete spinal cord injury (SCI). Following SCI, the spinal circuitry below the lesion site does not become silent rather it continues to maintain active and functional neuronal properties although in a modified manner.|$|E
2500|$|Since {{the root}} of the problem is neurological, doctors have {{explored}} sensorimotor retraining activities to enable the brain to [...] "rewire" [...] itself and eliminate dystonic movements. The work of several doctors such as Nancy Byl and Joaquin Farias has shown that sensorimotor retraining activities and <b>proprioceptive</b> stimulation can induce neuroplasticity, making it possible for patients to recover substantial function that was lost due to Cervical Dystonia, hand dystonia, blepharospasm, oromandibular dystonia, dysphonia and musicians' dystonia.|$|E
2500|$|Brain {{areas in}} the parietal and frontal lobes are {{associated}} with the deployment of attention (internally, or through eye movements, head turns or limb reaches) into contralateral space. [...] Neglect is most closely related to damage to the temporo-parietal junction and posterior parietal cortex. [...] The lack of attention to the left side of space can manifest in the visual, auditory, <b>proprioceptive,</b> and olfactory domains. [...] Although hemispatial neglect often manifests as a sensory deficit (and is frequently co-morbid with sensory deficit), it is essentially a failure to pay sufficient attention to sensory input.|$|E
2500|$|For {{those who}} {{attended}} the Vancouver Conference or learned about it later on, {{it was apparent that}} the poetics of Charles Olson, <b>proprioceptive</b> or Projectivist in its reach, was exerting a significant and lasting influence on the emerging generation of artists and poets who came to prominence in the 1950s and 1960s. Subsequent to this emerging generation of artists who felt Olson's impact, poets such as Robert Creeley and Robert Duncan would in turn exert their own huge impact on our national poetries (see also: Black Mountain poets and San Francisco Renaissance). Of this particular company of poets encountered in Vancouver, Palmer says: ...|$|E
2500|$|Research has {{uncovered}} {{a link between}} agoraphobia and difficulties with spatial orientation. Individuals without agoraphobia are able to maintain balance by combining information from their vestibular system, their visual system, and their <b>proprioceptive</b> sense. [...] A disproportionate number of agoraphobics have weak vestibular function and consequently rely more on visual or tactile signals. [...] They may become disoriented when visual cues are sparse (as in wide-open spaces) or overwhelming (as in crowds). Likewise, they may be confused by sloping or irregular surfaces. In a virtual reality study, agoraphobics showed impaired processing of changing audiovisual data in comparison with nonsuffering subjects.|$|E
