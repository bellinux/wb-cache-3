40|$|Arabinoxylans (AX) are a {{component}} of wheat bran that could have application as a food ingredient or <b>for</b> <b>non-food</b> <b>uses</b> if a commercial source could be established at a reasonable price. AX can be co-produced with ethanol in an integrated process, which could enhance the economics of a wheat-based biorefinery principally producing ethanol, and thus facilitate the introduction of commercial wheat-based fuel ethanol production in the UK. A study was therefore undertaken to investigate the economic feasibility of co-producing AX with ethanol from wheat. Pearling is an advanced wheat fractionation technology that preferentially recovers bran from the outer layers of the wheat kernel. The practical feasibility and economic benefit of recovering wheat bran for AX extraction via pearling was also investigated. This paper describes experimental studies to investigate the AX content in bran fractions obtained by pearling, the yields of AX extracted from pearling fractions, and the feasibility of recovering starch from the removed bran via washing, in order to minimise the reduction in ethanol yield due to starch losses with the bran. The following paper describes simulation and economic analysis of ethanol–AX co-production with and {{without the use of}} pearling to obtain the bran for AX extraction. AX was more concentrated in the outer bran layers of the wheat kernel, and the yield and purity of AX extracted from pearling fractions of these layers were greater than for fractions arising from the inner bran layers. This suggests that recovery of bran for AX extraction by pearling would give advantages in terms of yield. However, the quality and functionality of the AX extracted from the outer bran layers, compared with AX arising {{from other parts of the}} wheat kernel, need to be investigated. Enzyme treatment of AX extracts significantly enhanced the purity of the extracts. Washing bran with water prior to AX extraction resulted in 71 – 77...|$|R

Based {{on the current}} uses of cereals grown in Wallonia (Belgium), various scenarios defining possible futures for the Walloon cereal sector have been created. Purpose. These scenarios lay the basis for research aiming at assessing the sustainability of food and <b>non-food</b> <b>uses</b> of cereals. Method. Based on contrasted hypotheses, four scenarios for the uses of Walloon cereals by 2030 have been defined {{with the support of}} stakeholders involved in all the steps of the chain. Results. The first scenario, called "Business-as-Usual", extrapolates trends from 15 years before 2010 and up to 2030. In the second scenario, called "Strategic", the current system is optimized from the environmental, economic and social point of view. The third and fourth scenarios break with current trends. The third scenario, called "Localization", considers an increased autonomy and the development of new cereal processing units in Wallonia. The fourth scenario, called "Globalization", focuses on a massive level of cereal export in response to an increasing demand from the global market and deals with high added-value products within Wallonia. Conclusions. Issues such as competition between food <b>uses</b> and <b>non-food</b> <b>uses</b> of cereals and of Walloon dependency on imports are addressed in these scenarios illustrating possible future situations, from food self-sufficiency to dramatic globalization, through the development of new outlets combining the adaptation of cropping practices, consumption, the evolution of habits and the use of new technologies...|$|R
40|$|A time-series {{analysis}} of potato prices {{will be introduced}} in this study. Potatoes are the leading vegetable in the United States {{from the viewpoint of}} annual production. Compared with the other table food plants, potatoes ranks second only to wheat. Almost 81 % of the potatoes produced are used for food consumption, 5 % of the crop are used for seed and the remaining 14 % of the crop, which are the surplus consisting mostly of poor grade potatoes, go <b>for</b> <b>non-food</b> <b>uses,</b> such as livestock feed and industrial products, starch and alcohol. At the same time potatoes {{are one of the most}} widely grown crops in the United States. They are grown in every state and harvested during every month of the year in some sections of the country. During recent years, there has been a tendency toward more specialization in potato production. The total acreage trended downward but the yields per acre have increased rapidly. Production of potatoes is becoming concentrated in the high-yielding areas and on large commercial farms. This high specializing and commercializing tendency makes potato price analysis more important. Potato price analysis in this study is centered on Chicago and St. Louis, the two big wholesale markets of midwest potatoes, and is devoted largely to the late crop. Since the data we have cover a period of only seven years, the study will be emphasized with respect to short-time price analysis, i. e., annual and short-term cyclic price fluctuations and seasonal price variations. The main objectives of this study are three, listed in the following: To find out the effects of changes in late crop production, intermediate crop prices, and their pertinent factors on the late crop prices, i. e., to make a potato price structure analysis. To verify the hypothesis that markets adjust potato prices toward equilibrium levels, i. e., seasonal average level, - if price starts out too high or too low, that means the price is out of line and will adjust itself toward the seasonal average. To indicate the predictive value of certain measurable market phenomena on late potato crop prices. Advisor: Clarence J. Mille...|$|R

This {{is especially true in}} the case of biomass crops <b>for</b> <b>non-food</b> <b>uses</b> (energy, fibre and forage), grown with limited water supply. In this frame, we investigated growth and physiological response of two genotypes of biomass sorghum (Sorghum bicolor (L.) Moench) to contrasting levels of soil moisture in a pot experiment carried out in a greenhouse. Two water regimes (high and low water, corresponding to 70 % and 30 % field capacity) were applied to JS- 2002 and Trudan- 8 sorghum genotypes, respectively bred for dry sub-tropical and mild temperate conditions. Two harvests were carried out at 73 and 105 days after seeding. Physiological traits (transpiration, photosynthesis and stomatal conductance) were assessed in four dates during growth. Leaf water potential, its components and relative water content were determined at the two harvests. Low watering curbed plant height and aboveground biomass to a similar extent (ca. 70 %) in both genotypes. JS- 2002 exhibited a higher proportion of belowground to aboveground biomass, i. e., a morphology better suited to withstand drought. Despite this, JS- 2002 was more affected by low water in terms of physiology: during the growing season, the average ratio in transpiration, photosynthesis and stomatal conductance between droughty and well watered plants was, respectively, 0. 82, 0. 80 and 0. 79 in JS- 2002; 1. 05, 1. 08 and 1. 03 in Trudan- 8. Hence Trudan- 8 evidenced a ca. 20 % advantage in the three traits. In addition, Trudan- 8 could better exploit abundant moisture (70 % field capacity), increasing aboveground biomass and water use efficiency. In both genotypes, drought led to very low levels of leaf water potential and relative water content, still supporting photosynthesis. Hence, both morphological and physiological characteristics of sorghum were involved in plant adaptation to drought, in accordance with previous results. Conversely, the common assumption that genotypes best performing under wet conditions are less suited to face drought was contradicted by the results of the two genotypes in our experiment. This discloses a potential to be further exploited in programmes of biomass utilization for various end uses, although further evidence at greenhouse and field level is needed to corroborate this finding...|$|R
40|$|The {{current work}} aimed to resolve some long-standing {{questions}} about the potential benefits and limitations of co-digestion of slaughterhouse wastes. To achieve this, a laboratory-scale trial was carried out using the mechanically recovered organic fraction of municipal solid waste mixed with either sheep blood or a mixture of pig intestines with flotation fat. Both of these co-substrates are difficult to digest in isolation because of their high nitrogen and lipid concentrations, and are regulated as Category 3 materials under the Animal By-Products Regulations (EC 1069 / 2009). The results showed that at an organic loading rate of 2 kg VS m? 3 day? 1 with the slaughterhouse material making up 20 % of the load on a volatile solids basis the process could operate successfully. As the loading was increased to 4 kg VS m? 3 day? 1 signs of inhibition appeared with both co-substrates, however, and volumetric methane production {{was reduced to a}} point where co-digestion gave no process advantage. The main operational problem encountered was an increase in the concentration of volatile fatty acids in the digestate, particularly propionic acid: this was thought to be a result of ammonia toxicity. The concentration of potentially toxic elements in the digestate made it unsuitable for agricultural application <b>for</b> food <b>production,</b> although the increased nitrogen content made it more valuable as a fertiliser <b>for</b> <b>non-food</b> crop <b>use...</b>|$|R

Previous work {{introduced the}} breakage equation describing First Break roller milling of wheat {{in terms of}} a breakage function that incorporated relevant input and processing parameters such as roll gap, kernel diameter and kernel hardness. The resulting empirical function, based on polynomial fits, was sufficiently flexible to describe the range of particle size distributions encountered in typical milling operations, but contained a high number of coefficients, making the interpretation of the physical significance of the coefficients difficult and requiring an excessive amount of experimental data. The current work simplifies the breakage function by normalising the output particle size distribution against the milling ratio raised to a power. The Kumaraswamy probability distribution function is then used to describe the normalised data obtained following First Break milling {{of a wide range of}} wheat at different roll gaps under both Sharp-to-Sharp and Dull-to-Dull roll dispositions. Using this approach, the effects of roll gap and kernel diameter on wheat breakage can be described using just four parameters.

The effect of self-assembly under flow is rarely studied for food materials, but it is widely studied <b>for</b> <b>non-food</b> systems. The <b>use</b> of well-defined flow, often simple shear, turned out to be essential to study and control the structure formation process in foods as well. This observation encouraged us to develop a number of different shearing devices that allowed processing of biopolymer systems under simple shear flow. This paper reviews our main findings. In the case of protein fibrillization, the shear rate was found to control the growth rate as well as the properties of the fibrils formed. In the case of dough processing, simple shear flow made the product more process tolerant and induced gluten migration. The use of shear flow for dense caseinate dispersions led to hierarchically structured and fibrous material. Based on the presented results, we conclude that introducing simple shear flow in food structuring processes can lead to a much broader range of structures, thereby better utilizing the full potential of food ingredients...|$|R

The objectives of this research were to map the Ol locus and modifying genes involved in oleic acid content of safflower seeds and to determine the nature of Ol through a candidate gene approach. Two F 2 mapping populations from the nuclear male-sterile line CL- 1 and the high oleic acid lines CR- 6 (< 75 % oleic acid) and CR- 9 (< 84 %) were developed and phenotyped for oleic acid content at the F 2 and F 3 seed level. A genetic linkage map comprising 15 linkage groups and 116 random amplified polymorphic DNA, simple sequence repeat (SSR), and sequence-characterized amplified regions marker loci was constructed for the CL- 1 × CR- 9 population. The Ol gene was mapped to linkage group (LG) T 3 tightly linked to the SSR marker ct 365, which was confirmed in the CL- 1 × CR- 6 population. Additionally, a quantitative trait locus with a minor effect on increasing oleic acid content was identified on LG T 2.
