The Ranking SVM function uses a mapping function to describe the match between a search query and the features {{of each of the}} possible results. This mapping function projects each data pair (such as a search query and clicked web-page, for example) onto a feature space. These features are combined with the corresponding click-through data (which can act as a proxy for how relevant a page is for a specific query) and can then be used as the training data for the Ranking SVM algorithm.|$|E

In <b>pair-wise</b> <b>ranking,</b> RankSVM is a widely-used algorithm and has been successfully applied to the ranking problem in the previous work. However, RankSVM suffers from the critical problem of long training time needed {{to deal with a}} huge number of pairs. In this paper, we propose a data selection technique, Pruned RankSVM, that selects the most informative pairs before training. Experimental results show that the performance of Pruned RankSVM is on par with RankSVM while using significantly fewer pairs.

However, existing visual saliency estimation approaches often construct a unified model for all scenes, thus leading to poor performance for the scenes with diversified contents. To solve this problem, we propose a multi-task rank learning approach which can be used to infer multiple saliency models that apply to different scene clusters. In our approach, the problem of visual saliency estimation is formulated in a <b>pair-wise</b> <b>rank</b> learning framework, in which the visual features can be effectively integrated to distinguish salient targets from distrac-tors. A multi-task learning algorithm is then presented to infer multiple visual saliency models simultaneously. By an appropriate sharing of information across models, the generalization ability of each model can be greatly improved. Extensive experiments on a public eye-fixation dataset show that our multi-task rank learning approach outperforms 12 state-of-the-art methods remarkably in visual saliency estimation.

40|$|Bipartite ranking is a {{fundamental}} ranking problem that learns to order relevant instances ahead of irrelevant ones. One major approach for bipartite ranking, called the pair-wise approach, tackles an equivalent binary classification problem of whether one instance out {{of a pair of}} instances should be ranked higher than the other. Nevertheless, the number of instance pairs constructed from the input data could be quadratic {{to the size of the}} input data, which makes <b>pair-wise</b> <b>ranking</b> generally infeasible on large-scale data sets. Another major approach for bipartite ranking, called the point-wise approach, directly solves a binary classification problem between relevant and irrelevant instance points. This approach is feasible for large-scale data sets, but the resulting ranking performance can be inferior. That is, it is difficult to conduct bipartite ranking accurately and efficiently at the same time. In this paper, we develop a novel scheme within the pair-wise approach to conduct bipartite ranking efficiently. The scheme, called Active Sampling, is inspired from the rich field of active learning and can reach a competitive ranking performance while focusing only on a small subset of the many pairs during training. Moreover, we propose a general Combined Ranking and Classification (CRC) framework to accurately conduct bipartite ranking. The framework unifies point-wise and pair-wise approaches and is simply based on the idea of treating each instance point as a pseudo-pair. Experiments on 14 real-word large-scale data sets demonstrate that the proposed algorithm of Active Sampling within CRC, when coupled with a linear Support Vector Machine, usually outperforms state-of-the-art point-wise and <b>pair-wise</b> <b>ranking</b> approaches in terms of both accuracy and efficiency...|$|E

In this study, we decided to use a range of participatory tools in order to assess the knowledge, the perception and the 2009 relative incidence of FMD in 51 villages in the Svay Rieng province of Cambodia. The detection of antibodies directed to the non-structural FMD virus proteins (NSP) at village level was used to cross-validate results from participatory epidemiology. Matrix scoring agreements of <b>pair-wise</b> disease <b>ranking</b> and losses due to FMD, respectively W= 0. 13 and W= 0. 22 P< 0. 0001, showed a significant importance and similar perception of FMD for all districts visited.

The observed proportions of positive agreement between both serological and participatory approaches for 2009, varied between 42 % for village status and 68 % for animal status. Our study shows that even if FMD is considered as the second most important disease, livestock owners see no benefit in reporting it since the disease is known to have low direct impacts. Participatory methods have proved useful in evaluating the effect of FMD at household level but seem to overestimate the presence of the disease. (Résumé d'auteur...|$|R

The approach consists in designing a library of various periodic function shapes (motion programs), and a knowledgebase of mechanism types that are capable of generating periodic functions, together with classified information concerning the kinematic functional capabilities and technical characteristics of each mechanism type. Mechanisms are assessed against the desired function shape and specifications and a user-prioritized set of nonkinematic criteria. Assessment of functional capabilities is based on the maximum number of extreme points of the most complex function a given mechanism type can generate. If a mechanism type has been assessed as potentially capable of generating the desired function, it goes into the second step, at which it is compared to other successful alternatives based on nonkinematic criteria. <b>Pair-wise</b> comparisons and <b>ranking</b> of alternatives are carried out using the analytic-hierarchy process (AHP) as the decision-making tool.

In this paper, we study the problem of social strength modeling (SSM) for the users in a social media community, who are typically associated with diverse form of data. In particular, we take Flickr [...] -the most popular online photo sharing community [...] -as an example, in which users are sharing their experiences through substantial amounts of multimodal contents (e. g., photos, tags, geo-locations, friend lists) and social behaviors (e. g., commenting and joining interest groups). Such heterogeneous data in Flickr bring opportunities yet challenges to the research community for SSM. One of the key issues in SSM is how to effectively explore the heterogeneous data and how to optimally combine them to measure the social strength. In this paper, we present a kernel-based learning to rank framework for inferring the social strength of Flickr users, which involves two learning stages.

40|$|Environmental {{degradation}} and {{the deterioration of}} the natural resource base have become serious problems in Ethiopia. The existing biophysical, environmental and socio-economic indicators provide sufficient testimonies for the severity of the problem of natural resources deterioration in Ethiopia. Most forms of the nation’s environmental problems are directly or indirectly attributable to the rapid dwindling of the country’s vegetation cover and the consequent degradation of its land resource. To combat this problem national level environmental conservation and rehabilitation efforts were started in the 1970 s, with particular focus on the fast deteriorating highland areas of the country. Closing degraded land areas from human and livestock intervention to promote natural regeneration of plants, commonly termed as exclosures, is among the major conservation efforts practiced in the highland areas of Tigray, northern Ethiopia. The introduction of this policy has brought major changes in land use in Tigray. Land areas formerly used as grazing land, bush lands, wood lands, and even some crop lands were converted to forestry. These were areas where local people generate lots of economic benefits (such as source of grazing; fodder collection; fuelwood; and other wood and non-wood products). This land use conversion limits the harvest of environmental products by local people due to the adoption of restrictive use rules. As a result, local people have encountered losses of economic benefits and welfare. These have led many local residents to view such a land use policy change as a less favoured land use option. On the other hand, local government and non-government agencies in favour of exclosures strongly argue for the desirability of exclosures in terms of the ecological functions and long-run economic benefits. With respect to exclosures, several knowledge gaps arise: (1) the local costs of establishing exclosures and economic welfare loss emanating from access restriction have not been quantified and as a result little has been known about the economic contribution of environmental resource use in the welfare of rural people, (2) the factors that condition rural households’ heavy dependence on ‘natural extraction’ have not been systematically identified, (3) the ecological services provided by the vegetation restoration in exclosures and the tradeoffs of alternative land use options have not been quantified and valued in order to give economic justification for such land use conversion, and (4) sustainable management of the closed areas has become a serious practical problem. Sustainability criteria and indicators, their relative importance, and areas that need special attention for efficient and effective interventions have not been critically identified. Therefore, this study aimed at contributing to the existing stock of knowledge on the economic importance of environmental resource use to rural livelihoods; the trade-offs in terms of economic values (costs and benefits) associated with converting existing land use types to forestry; and the sustainable management of community owned natural resource systems. This may foster economic rationality among decision makers and the general public in land allocation for various uses and for sustainable management of closed areas. It would also provide important inputs to policy makers and insights into resource management options and livelihood strategies. The thesis has four core chapters (chapters 2, 3, 4, and 5). With the help of empirical data from 360 randomly sampled rural households from 12 villages in Tigray, chapter 2 examines the role of forest environmental products in the wellbeing of rural households and compares the value of environmental goods with other household economic activities. We found that income from environmental sources occupies the second largest share in average total household income next to crop income. The poverty and inequality analyses show that incorporating environmental incomes in household accounts contribute significantly to the reduction in measured rural poverty and income inequality. Using the ‘livelihood approach’ as an analytical framework and multinomial logit (MNL) regression method, the determinants of households’ livelihood activity choice and their reliance on environmental extraction were identified in chapter 3. The MNL regression analyses indicate that heterogeneity in access to livelihood assets determines the choice of a household's livelihood strategy. Thus, targeted interventions in enhancing the positions of asset-poor households need to be introduced in order to mitigate local pressure on natural environment and improve the economic wellbeing of local people without hampering the resource base. By integrating the available data on on-site and off-site effects of exclosures (i. e. the effects on soil erosion, biomass production, sedimentation, crop yield, and opportunity cost of land and labour) chapter 4 undertakes an economic analysis of the soil and water conservation effects of exclosures using the model of cost-benefit analysis. Key benefit and cost items were identified, quantified, and valued. Direct market prices and variants of indirect techniques (i. e. replacement cost method, productivity change method, and damage cost avoided) of environmental valuation were used to value the various benefit and cost items. Our alternative scenario analyses indicate that establishing exclosures in degraded land has a positive net present value (NPV). However, converting productive agricultural land to forestry yields a negative NPV even under some hypothetical scenarios of overestimated values of forest products and a low social discount rate. Thus, land conversion to forestry or other land use changes should be carefully analyzed and justified in economic terms before introducing the proposed land use change. Using the general procedure of multi-criteria analysis (MCA), chapter 5 analyzes the sustainable management of community owned natural resources (with particular focus on community forestry). Three variants of MCA methods (<b>ranking,</b> <b>pair-wise</b> comparisons, and scoring) were used. Our analyses indicate that the performance of the prevailing resource management system is poor. Thus, the application of ‘traditional environmental management packages’ in Ethiopia which commonly pays due attention to the ecological aspects alone has to be substituted by research-based holistic management prescriptions. In order to harmonize both developmental and environmental objectives, locally relevant sets of criteria and indicators of sustainability should be carefully identified and evaluated from the local perspectives. status: publishe...|$|R

But somehow they are rarely evaluatedand usually with a top-down approach. This is the case in Cambodia, where thousands of Village AnimalHealth Workers (VAHWs) have been trained by the government, and where no standardized evaluationtool is available to accurately assess the situation. Based on methodology developed by the French NGO Agronomes et Vétérinaires Sans Frontières (AVSF) inMadagascar for farmers' association evaluation, we developed our own participatory methods to collectinformation about the VAHW context and build a criteria grid for their evaluation. In this framework,several participatory approaches were used such as problem trees, semi-structured interviews, <b>pair-wise</b> <b>ranking</b> and focus groups. The grid was built with the help of relevant stakeholders involved inthe animal health system in Cambodia in order to (i) identify VAHW functions; (ii) set up criteria andassociated questionnaires, and (iii) score the grid with all the stakeholders. The tool was divided into fivecategories of evaluation criteria: sustainability, treatment, production, vaccination and disease reporting. Our approach looked at local indicators of success developed and used by VAHWs themselves, whichshould lead to better acceptability of evaluation.

Roughness sensation of fingertip was tested under different lubricants including water and diluted syrup solutions at room temperature (25 oC) and body temperature (37 oC) by using simple pairwise comparison in order to observe the just noticeable difference threshold and perception levels. Additionally in this research applied force load during roughness observation was tested with <b>pair-wise</b> <b>ranking</b> method to illustrate its possible effect on the human sensation. Obtained results showed that human roughness discrimination capability reduces with an increasing viscosity of the lubricant, where the temperature was not found to be significant. Moreover, the increase in the applied force load showed an increase in the sensitivity of roughness discrimination capability. Observed effects of the applied factors were also used for estimating the oral sensation of texture during eating. These findings are significant for our fundamental understanding to the texture perception, but also could find applications in the material sciences which may include food sciences that needs information about texture perception for the development of new foods with controlled textural features...|$|E
40|$|Objective: The {{present study}} was {{conducted}} in New Sandwip island (Jahajerchar) of the Meghna estuary, Noakhali to explore animal species are being reared, their disease status, and also to finding out the constraints and opportunitities for keeping livestock in the island. Materials: Considering local knowledge as an epidemiological intelligence, the livestock species and their disease profile as well as livestock keeping problems were assessed through two focus group discussion with informants&# 146; interview using Participatory Disease Searching (PDS) tools. The interview was conducted predominantly using semi-structured questionnaire (SSI) and other participatory epidemiology(PE) tools such as simple ranking (SR), <b>pair-wise</b> <b>ranking</b> (PWR), proportional pilling (PP) and transect work (visualization) were applied with flexibility to collect information. Results: PDS tools identified sheep (69 %) is the main livestock species followed by cattle (16 %) and buffalo (15 %) in the island. The Peste des Petits Ruminant (PPR) in sheep (90 %), anthrax in cattle (52 %) and Haemorrgic Septicemia (HS) in buffalo (59 %) were confirmed as top important species-wise diseases via the study. This place is prospect for sheep and buffalo raising rather than cattle. Lack of of shelter (Khella) for keeping livestock during adverse climatic condition, no access of portable water along with inadequate veterinary health care facilities were recognized as constraints for livestock raising in this island. Conclusion: This place is potential for sheep and buffalo raising rather than cattle. The study has validated the significance of accepting participatory disease searching tool in order to capture voluntarily submitted epidemiological data towards establishing a cost effective, unique national disease surveillance system in Bangladesh.

40|$|Livelihood {{stressors}} {{in southern}} Africa, such as HIV/Aids and climate change, {{do not act}} in isolation but rather interact concurrently in complex socio-ecological systems with diverse, interrelated and compounded affects. Households experience differential vulnerability to such stressors based on contextual factors such as geographical location, income level and the gender and age of its members. Households’ differential experiences of vulnerability are further defined by the households’ use of their capital stocks: the human, social, natural, financial and physical capital available to the household to form livelihoods and resist the detrimental effects of a stressor. The capital stocks of 340 households were measured in two sites in the Eastern Cape, South Africa, using a household survey. These data were analysed to determine differences between the sites, households with heads of different gender and households of different income levels. Further data relating to the drivers and interactions of stressors over temporal and spatial scales, {{as well as the}} perceived value of various forms of capital by different social groups in the two sites, were collected via Participatory Learning and Action (PLA) methods including timelines, mental modelling and <b>pair-wise</b> <b>ranking.</b> Although the two sites have similar levels of income and fall within the same province, many significant differences emerged. The two sites showed different distributions of household head genders and different stressors and perceptions of vulnerability, perhaps owing to differences in their capital stocks, acting alongside the influence of culture and access on a shifting rural-urban continuum. These discrepancies further transpired to reflect crucial differential experiences along gender lines and income levels in each site. Vulnerability was often context specific, not only because of unique drivers of stress in different areas, but also because socio-economic groups and localities often had characteristics that could potentially exacerbate vulnerability, as well as characteristics that can potentially facilitate adaptive capacity. Stressors were found to have depleted multiple forms of capital over time, while new stressors were emerging, raising concerns over the most appropriate means of social protection within these contexts...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background HIV {{prevention}} {{research in}} resource-limited countries {{is associated with}} a variety of ethical dilemmas. Key amongst these is the question of what constitutes an appropriate standard of health care (SoC) for participants in HIV prevention trials. This paper describes a community-focused approach to develop a locally-appropriate SoC {{in the context of a}} phase III vaginal microbicide trial in Mwanza City, northwest Tanzania. Methods A mobile community-based sexual and reproductive health service for women working as informal food vendors or in traditional and modern bars, restaurants, hotels and guesthouses has been established in 10 city wards. Wards were divided into geographical clusters and community representatives elected at cluster and ward level. A city-level Community Advisory Committee (CAC) with representatives from each ward has been established. Workshops and community meetings at ward and city-level have explored project-related concerns using tools adapted from participatory learning and action techniques e. g. chapati diagrams, <b>pair-wise</b> <b>ranking.</b> Secondary stakeholders representing local public-sector and non-governmental health and social care providers have formed a trial Stakeholders' Advisory Group (SAG), which includes two CAC representatives. Results Key recommendations from participatory community workshops, CAC and SAG meetings conducted in the first year of the trial relate to the quality and range of clinic services provided at study clinics as well as broader standard of care issues. Recommendations have included streamlining clinic services to reduce waiting times, expanding services to include the children and spouses of participants and providing care for common local conditions such as malaria. Participants, community representatives and stakeholders felt there was an ethical obligation to ensure effective access to antiretroviral drugs and to provide supportive community-based care for women identified as HIV positive during the trial. This obligation includes ensuring sustainable, post-trial access to these services. Post-trial access to an effective vaginal microbicide was also felt to be a moral imperative. Conclusion Participatory methodologies enabled effective partnerships between researchers, participant representatives and community stakeholders to be developed and facilitated local dialogue and consensus on what constitutes a locally-appropriate standard of care in the context of a vaginal microbicide trial in this setting.
