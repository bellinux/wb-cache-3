40|$|Atrichia with <b>papular</b> <b>lesions</b> {{is a rare}} form {{of total}} alopecia, in which {{mutations}} in the hairless gene {{have been shown to}} underlie the phenotype. In the literature to date, atrichia with <b>papular</b> <b>lesions</b> has generally been reported to be inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. A few rare cases exist, however, in which parent-to-child transmission of atrichia with <b>papular</b> <b>lesions</b> has been documented. In this study, further investigations were carried out into the molecular basis of atrichia with <b>papular</b> <b>lesions</b> in a family with mother-to-son transmission by searching for mutations in the human hairless gene. Specific ally, we wanted to determine whether this case truly represented an example of dominantly inherited atrichia with <b>papular</b> <b>lesions,</b> or whether another mode of inheritance might be responsible for the disorder in this kindred. Pseudodominant inheritance, for example, occurs when an individual with a known recessive disorder has a clinically unaffected partner, but then unexpectedly gives birth to children who are affected with the same recessive disorder as the affected parent, and can easily be distinguished from classical dominant inheritance with molecular diagnosis and haplotype analysis. In the family reported here, we have determined that both the mother and son are, in fact, homozygous for a novel mutation in the hairless gene, R 33 X. We provide the first evidence for pseudodominant inheritance in atrichia with <b>papular</b> <b>lesions,</b> {{and at the same time}} extend our knowledge of pathogenetic mutations in the human hairless gene. Importantly, this information allows revisions in genetic counseling for risk of transmission for individuals in the family, previously impossible in the absence of knowing the genetic basis of atrichia with <b>papular</b> <b>lesions</b> in this unusual kindred...|$|R

40|$|A {{patient with}} a {{monoclonal}} IgG kappa cryoglobulin presented with the purpura-arthralgia syndrome but showed no evidence of plasma cell myeloma.

On cryoprecipitation the monoclonal cryoglobulin preferentially interacted with autologous non-cryo IgG forming intermediate type, 9 S IgG– 11 S IgG complexes.

40|$|Congenital atrichia with <b>papular</b> <b>lesions</b> is a rare, {{autosomal}} recessive form of total alopecia and mutations in the hairless (hir) gene have {{been implicated in}} this disorder. Published estimates of the prevalence of this disorder remain surprisingly low considering pathogenetic mutations in hir {{have been found in}} distinct ethnicities around the world. Therefore, it is likely that congenital atrichia with <b>papular</b> <b>lesions</b> is far more common than previously thought and is often mistaken for its phenocopy, the putative autoimmune form of alopecia universalis. To clarify this discrepancy, we propose criteria for the clinical diagnosis of congenital atrichia with <b>papular</b> <b>lesions.</b> Among these is the novel report of the consistent observation of hypopigmented whitish streaks on the scalp surface of affected individuals. Additionally, we report the identification of a novel missense mutation in hir from a family of Arab Palestinian origin that exhibits the pathognomonic features of atrichia with <b>papular</b> <b>lesions.</b> Collectively, we anticipate that an increased recognition of this disorder will result in more accurate diagnosis and the sparing of unnecessarily treatment to patients...|$|R

Results: The age of patients ranged from 28 days to 5 years and M: F ratio was 1 : 1. 5. Clinically, the diagnoses suggested were histiocytosis, varicella, transient neonatal pustular melanosis, keloid, sarcoidosis, seborrheic keratosis and LCH.

A therapeutic trial of tetracycline or chloramphenicol is indicated in patients in whom the diagnosis of scrub typhus is suspected. The recommended treatment regimen for scrub typhus is doxycycline.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Introduction & Objective: Acne vulgaris is {{a common}} skin disease which affects {{a large number of}} {{adolescents}} and adults at some time in their life. Several drugs have been used for the treatment of acne vulgaris and recently systemic azithromycin has been tried for its treatment. The aim {{of this study was to}} compare the therapeutic efficacy of azithromycin vs. tetracycline in acne vulgaris. Materials & Methods: The present study was a randomized investigator-blind clinical trial, carried out at the outpatient department of Besat Hospital of Sanandaj in 2008. 82 patients were allocated randomly into two groups. Azithromycin 500 mg for 3 consecutive days per week for the first month, then 250 mg/ every other day was prescribed for the first group. The second group received tetracycline 250 mg/ 6 h. The treatments continued for 12 weeks. The therapeutic efficacy of these drugs was assessed on the basis of lesion counting. Data were introduced into SPSS 11. 5 software and analyzed by means of independent t- test, Mann-Whitney and chi-square test. Results: The mean number of lesions was not statistically different before treatment in the two groups. There was statistically a significant difference in the mean number of inflammatory <b>papular</b> <b>lesions</b> on the face and back after treatment (p< 0. 05). However no significant difference was found in comedons lesions in both groups. The percentages of improvement of inflammatory <b>papular</b> <b>lesions</b> on the face and back were 82. 3, 63. 6 and 80. 14 and 58. 56 respectively (p< 0. 05). Conclusion: This study suggested that azithromycin was more effective than tetracycline in treating inflammatory <b>papular</b> <b>lesions</b> of acne vulgaris on the face and back.
