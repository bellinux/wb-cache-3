40|$|International audienceSince the {{influenza}} A (H 1 N 1) {{virus has}} made headlines of newspapers in 2009, {{awareness of the}} importance of pandemic risk has risen, especially among insurers. In fact, the occurrence of a severe pandemic could cause a significant increase in mortality, and consequently might cause the bankruptcy of insurance companies. Thus, it is essential for insurers to better understand pandemic risk. This is entirely consistent with the requirements of the new European Directive Solvency 2, which encourages insurers to control all the risks they face and to hold sufficient capital for these risks. This capital can be calculated by a standard formula, an internal model or a <b>partial</b> <b>internal</b> model. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to propose a way of integrating the risk of pandemic influenza in a <b>partial</b> <b>internal</b> model for the death guarantee and protection business. To do so, mortality risk is split into a trend and a pandemic shock event. The model takes into account the nature of available data and of the level of segmentation chosen by the insurance company (individual or aggregate data) ...|$|R

40|$|Part 2 of {{this series}} of two papers {{presents}} the applications of the discrete singular convolution (DSC) algorithm. The main {{purpose of this paper}} is to explore the utility, test the accuracy and examine the convergence of the proposed approach for the vibration analysis of rectangular plates with <b>internal</b> supports. Both <b>partial</b> <b>internal</b> line supports and complex internal supports are considered for 21 square plates of various combinations of edge support conditions. The eects of dierent size, shape and topology of the internal supports and dierent boundary conditions on the vibration response of plates are investigated. The <b>partial</b> <b>internal</b> line supports may vary from a central point support to a full range of cross or diagonal line supports. Several closed-loop supports, such as ring, square and rhombus, and their combinations are studied for complex internal supports. Convergence and comparison studies are carried out to establish the correctness and accuracy of the DSC algorithm. The DSC results are compared with those in the available literature obtained by using other methods. Numerical results indicate that the DSC algorithm exhibits controllable accuracy for plate analysis and shows excellent exibility in handling complex geometries, boundary conditions and support conditions.

40|$|Botrytis cinerea is a necrotrophic {{pathogen}} causing pre- and post-harvest {{diseases in}} at least 235 plant species. It manifests extraordinary genotype and phenotype variation. One {{of the causes of}} this variation is transposable elements. Two transposable elements have been discovered in this fungus, the retrotransposon (Boty), and the transposon (Flipper). In this work, two complete (Boty-II- 76 and Boty-II- 103) and two partial (Boty-II- 95 and Boty-II- 141) long terminal repeat (LTR) retrotransposons were identified by an in silico genomic sequence analysis. Boty-II- 76 and Boty-II- 103 contain 6439 bp nucleotides with a pair of LTRs at both ends, and an internal deduced pol gene encoding a polyprotein with reverse transcriptase and DDE integrase domains. They are flanked by 5 bp direct repeats (ACCAT, CTTTC). In Boty-II- 141, two LTRs at both ends, and a <b>partial</b> <b>internal</b> pol gene encoding a protein with a DDE integrase domain were identified. In Boty-II- 95, a right LTR and a <b>partial</b> <b>internal</b> pol gene encoding a protein with no conserved domains were identified. Boty-II uses a self-priming mechanism to initiate synthesis of reverse transcripts. The sequence of the presumed primer binding site for first-strand reverse transcription is 5 &# 8217;-TTGTACCAT- 3 &# 8217;. The polypurine-rich sequence for plus-strand DNA synthesis is 5 &# 8217;-GCCTTGAGCGGGGGGTAC- 3 &# 8217;.
