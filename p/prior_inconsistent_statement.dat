40|$|How well do hearsay rules {{function}} {{under the}} current Federal Rules of Evidence? One issue, dormant yet pulsating beneath the surface for decades, involves the admissibility of <b>prior</b> <b>inconsistent</b> <b>statements</b> by witnesses. The long-standing “orthodox” rule admitted the prior statement only to impeach the witness’s trial testimony; {{it could not be}} used as substantive evidence of the facts asserted. In 1972, the Advisory Committee on the Federal Rules of Evidence (“the Advisory Committee” or “the Committee”) proposed an innovative rule permitting all <b>prior</b> <b>inconsistent</b> <b>statements</b> to be used both for impeachment and as substantive evidence—a sea change in practice.

40|$|The {{common law}} {{has come a}} long way since Sir Walter Raleigh was convicted of treason on the basis of accusations {{contained}} in unproduced letters and the hearsay declarations of unproduced witnesses. However, despite the painstaking development and innumerable formulations and reformulations of the hearsay rule over the past several centuries, there are areas of that body of law which are as yet unsettled and the subject of heated controversy. One such area is that of <b>prior</b> <b>inconsistent</b> <b>statements</b> of witnesses, the controversy over which has continued over the years and has surfaced once again with promulgation of the new Federal Rules of Evidence. Legal theories, like social and cultural philosophies, often follow marked trends and patterns. A few years ago exclusionary rules were on the ascendancy, especially in the area of criminal law, while today it is increased admissibility which is in vogue. Both had their advocates throughout common law history, and will probably always find support. It is a reflection of this current trend that the traditional rules governing substantive use of <b>prior</b> <b>inconsistent</b> <b>statements,</b> once unquestioningly accepted, have since been roundly criticized by authorities from Wigmore to the Supreme Court. The purpose of this article is to attempt to redress the balance just slightly, by setting out some of the counterarguments which lie behind the traditional substantive exclusion of <b>prior</b> <b>inconsistent</b> <b>statements.</b> An attempt will be made to emphasize practical, rather than merely theoretical, considerations...|$|R
50|$|Prior {{consistent}} <b>statements</b> and <b>prior</b> <b>inconsistent</b> <b>statements,</b> {{in the law}} of evidence, occur where a witness, testifying at trial, makes {{a statement}} that is either consistent or inconsistent, respectively, with a previous statement given at an earlier time such as during a discovery, interview, or interrogation.

40|$|Federal Rule of Evidence 801 (d) (1) (A) is a compromise. The Supreme Court’s {{version of}} the Rule, which it {{submitted}} to Congress in 1972, would have made all <b>prior</b> <b>inconsistent</b> <b>statements</b> of a witness present in court for cross-examination admissible as substantive evidence. The Court’s proposal was strongly favored by the Advisory Committee on the Federal Rules of Evidence (or “the Advisory Committee”) members who drafted the Rule. They submitted it to the Court knowing that it {{was consistent with the}} approach taken by some states and favored by authorities like John Henry Wigmore, Edmund Morgan, and Charles McCormick. But the Court’s proposal was a departure from the common law approach, which treated all <b>prior</b> <b>inconsistent</b> <b>statements</b> as hearsay, admissible only for impeachment.

50|$|In Australia, {{the term}} 'unfavourable witness' {{is defined by}} section 38 of the Evidence Act which permits the {{prosecution}} to cross-examine their own witness. For example, if the prosecution calls all material witnesses relevant to a case before the court, and any evidence given is not favourable to, or supports the prosecution case, or a witness has given a <b>prior</b> <b>inconsistent</b> <b>statement,</b> then the prosecution may seek leave of the court, via section 192, to test the witness {{in relation to their}} evidence.|$|E
5000|$|If the {{opponent}} {{shows that the}} witness made a <b>prior</b> <b>inconsistent</b> <b>statement</b> and implies that after that statement and prior to trial the witness was [...] "gotten to" [...] or otherwise developed a motive to lie in court, rehabilitation can be attempted by showing that the witness made a prior consistent statement (consistent with the testimony) before the alleged events {{that gave rise to}} the alleged motive to lie. The jury is left with two pretrial statements that are inconsistent with each other, but only one is inconsistent with the testimony, and both were made before the witness was allegedly gotten to. Thus, there might be softening of the accusation that the testimony flows from such as a bribe. Also, there is always a case for allowing a prior consistent statement made at any time before trial to help explain away what is arguably only a seemingly inconsistent statement that is subject to interpretation, such as if it was lifted out of the context that would explain the statement.|$|E

40|$|As a new crime type, {{knowledge}} about {{trafficking in persons}} is still emerging.

Victim detection, identification and reporting, and prosecution of traffickers, underlies anti-trafficking responses of compliance and law enforcement through collaborative immigration and policing initiatives. Differing responses by state and national jurisdictions to detect, investigate and prosecute trafficking cases highlight issues of the complexities of transnational trafficking cases, victim support programs, provision of legal advice, <b>prior</b> <b>inconsistent</b> <b>statements</b> and the credibility of witnesses. These underpin the need for more research to characterise the victims of trafficking, reconceptualise the visa framework, provide victim support services, ensure laws protect witnesses and improve policing education...|$|R
40|$|In State v.

40|$|Since 1975, Rule 613 (b) of the Federal Rules of Evidence has governed the {{admission}} of extrinsic evidence of a <b>prior</b> <b>inconsistent</b> <b>statement</b> in federal court. Rule 613 (b) requires the proponent of the <b>prior</b> <b>inconsistent</b> <b>statement</b> to provide the declarant an opportunity to explain or deny it. There is no requirement that the proponent provide that opportunity at any particular time or in any particular sequence. Rule 613 reflected a change from the common law that {{had fallen out of}} fashion in the federal courts. That common law rule, known as the Rule in Queen Caroline’s Case, required the proponent of a <b>prior</b> <b>inconsistent</b> <b>statement</b> to confront the declarant witness with the statement on cross-examination before introducing any extrinsic evidence of the prior statement. For a variety of reasons, the Advisory Committee reasoned that the Rule in Queen Caroline’s Case constituted an unnecessary encumbrance on cross-examination. Despite the plain meaning of Rule 613 (b), and the clear explanation in the Advisory Committee’s Note, a number of federal courts have continued to apply the common law Rule in Queen Caroline’s Case, citing assorted rationales for doing so. Their actions have caught the attention of the Advisory Committee on Evidence Rules, which has entertained the idea of amending Rule 613 (b) to reflect the common law Rule in Queen Caroline’s Case. All things considered, amending Rule 613 (b) to adopt the common law of thirty-five years ago is unwise. The English history behind the Rule in Queen Caroline’s Case undermines its credibility. Furthermore, Rule 613 (b) accomplishes nearly all of the legitimate policy goals of that common law rule while providing for more effective cross-examination. While there does exist a split among United States courts of appeals, most circuit courts apply Rule 613 (b) as intended, and only a minority of circuit courts apply the superseded Rule in Queen Caroline’s Case. Rather than amend Rule 613 (b) to return to the common law Rule in Queen Caroline’s Case, the Advisory Committee should consider amending the Rule to make uniform the application of the Rule as originally intended. At the very least, the Advisory Committee should not amend Rule 613 (b) to return Queen Caroline to her throne...|$|E

40|$|A recent {{amendment}} to Federal Rule of Evidence 801 (d) (1) (B) expands the {{situations in which}} prior consistent statements by testifying witnesses {{can be used as}} substantive evidence, and not merely as rehabilitating evidence. In this piece, the Authors argue that the revised rule may mislead judges and lawyers to conclude that prior consistent statements are always usable as substantive evidence when offered to rehabilitate a witness. Nothing {{could be further from the}} truth. The intent, although hard to discern on the face of the revised rule, is only to allow substantive use of consistent statements that are otherwise admissible to rehabilitate the testimony of a witness whose credibility has been attacked in a way that can be properly answered by proving prior consistencies. Thus the rule allows substantive use of consistent statements when they are relevant to repair attacks charging the witness with having forgotten what actually happened or charging the witness with making <b>prior</b> <b>inconsistent</b> <b>statements</b> in those limited cases in which proving consistent statements could refute such an attack. Perhaps most importantly, the revised rule does not do away with the premotive requirement adopted by the Supreme Court in the Tome case more than twenty years ago...|$|R
50|$|Evidentiary {{standards}} are codified by the Evidence Act of 2005. The Act includes many modern, liberal English common law provisions including {{the exclusion of}} evidence that is unfairly prejudicial, exclusion of evidence of attempts to settle outside court, and exclusion of evidence of subsequent remedial measures. The Act, however, does not guarantee parties before a court to confront the witnesses against them when the court believes the witness' identity needs to be protected. Physical evidence on an issue renders documentary evidence on the same issue inadmissible unless the court finds there is substantive and reasonable ground for the physical evidence to be untrue and irrelevant. Thus, judges retain {{a high level of}} discretion in the admission of evidence in all cases and the ability to rebut witness evidence in certain others. Witnesses may be impeached by <b>prior</b> <b>inconsistent</b> <b>statements</b> or by evidence of prior bad acts involving dishonesty or fraud. There are also provisions protecting witnesses and victims of sexual crimes which render evidence about the witness or victim's sexual behavior inadmissible in most situations. Hearsay (including non-hearsay and hearsay exceptions), party admissions, burdens, and presumptions are also codified in a fashion similar to the United States Federal Rules of Evidence.|$|R

40|$|Prosecution of {{domestic}} violence is extremely difficult, {{largely due to the}} fact that defendants are successfully pressuring victims to refuse to testify or to recant their testimony at trial. With its decision in Crawford, the Supreme Court eliminated the ability of prosecutors to use hearsay exceptions to place the domestic violence victim 2 ̆ 7 s statements before the jury for their substantive consideration. The Supreme Court also closed this avenue to combat defendants 2 ̆ 7 efforts to avoid liability through coercive pressure on victims. Therefore, the Court 2 ̆ 7 s change in the Confrontation Clause law limits the prosecution 2 ̆ 7 s arsenal for combating witness intimidation and, at the same time, places an unwieldy Rule 801 (d) (1) (A) squarely into play. Unfortunately, the current rule is ineffective in assisting domestic violence prosecutions and preventing witness intimidation. When the defendant 2 ̆ 7 s pressure results in recantation, rather than refusal to testify, the Court 2 ̆ 7 s forfeiture by wrongdoing remedy to witness intimidation is not available. In this situation, the prosecution is left with a faulty witness and no prior statement. The defendant, on the other hand, is the double beneficiary of the Crawford decision: he has an enhanced right to confront the victim and Rule 801 (d) (1) (A) prevents redress of his intimidation of the victim. The modified rule, however, is able to properly align the positive benefits of the Crawford decision by ensuring the defendant 2 ̆ 7 s full confrontation rights and eliminating the incentive to intimidate witnesses. In this way, allowing substantive use of <b>prior</b> <b>inconsistent</b> <b>statements</b> is vital to society 2 ̆ 7 s efforts to hold batterers accountable for the violence they inflict on their victims...|$|R
