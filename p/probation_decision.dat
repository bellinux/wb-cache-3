500|$|Various {{sectors of}} society {{expressed}} concern over the light sentence; the Police Inspectors' Association asked for clearer guidelines on the penalties to be expected in such cases. The Junior Police Officers' Association also complained that the <b>probation</b> <b>decision</b> could {{not be seen as}} a deterrent, but accepted that the court decision had to be respected as the magistrate [...] "would have considered all factors." [...] The Standard editorial derided Yuen's reasoning as [...] "unpersuasive". Kevin Zervos, deputy director of public prosecutions, requested that Yuen rethink his sentence. The police also received criticism for charging Bokhary under the Police Force Ordinance – with a maximum penalty of six months imprisonment – instead of the Offences Against the Person Ordinance, which carries a maximum two-year sentence. Police Director of Crime and Security Xavier Tang responded that the lesser charge had been chosen because officers believed they had a better chance of conviction – she was said to be ready to plead guilty to assaulting police.|$|E
40|$|Articulation {{of purpose}} is, and should be, an {{important}} feature of any governmental activity. Since 1962, and {{the publication of the}} Model Penal Code, governments have increasingly seen fit to identify the purposes of punishment. To the extent such purposes have been expressly identified, however, they have primarily related to imprisonment, informing the duration inquiry. Governments have been far less dedicated to the articulation of the purposes of probation, a disposition that today easily accounts for the majority of penal outcomes in U. S. courts. This paper explores the role of purpose in <b>probation</b> <b>decision</b> making. It begins with a historical survey of probation, before and after the Model Penal Code, and assesses the unfortunate effects of purposelessness, a deficit the Code 2 ̆ 7 s probation provisions did little to ameliorate. The paper observes that as probation has become increasingly diversified in its applications over time, the absence of identified purpose in probation decisions has become all the more problematic. In its final part, the paper discusses the importance of articulated purpose in <b>probation</b> <b>decision</b> making, both with regard to decisions to grant probation and the types of probation conditions to which particular individuals are potentially subject...|$|E
40|$|Some 20 years ago, I {{released}} a defendant facing a minor charge pending his trial, who promptly beat up proprietors {{in a new}} attempted robbery. I had no access to information about the defendant’s criminal history. Even today, my mistakes {{that are based on}} inadequate information can allow tremendous harm to victims, communities, families, and children. I profoundly hope that I’m sending the right people to prison, to probation under proper conditions, and to the right providers. It is, of course, terrible when someone we release promptly causes great harm. It is understandable that observers blame the judge for that harm (even if the judge had no lawful choice). But our decisions often play out badly over a much longer period of time. Others may participate along the path to the harm and spare us at least visible fault, but we still desperately hope that we improve the outcome: a criminal pretrial, sentence, or <b>probation</b> <b>decision</b> that best protects the community from future criminal conduct; a family custody, dependency, or delinquency decision that leads to the most successful childhood, adulthood, and subsequent parenting; a civil commitment decision that leads to the highest level of functioning for an impaired citizen; a disposition that helps any victims best emerge from their victimization and serves the legitimate purposes of “just deserts. ...|$|E

40|$|After {{a period}} of {{relative}} stagnation, {{the past few months}} witnessed the adoption of a plethora of legislative instruments under the third pillar. These instruments {{can be seen as the}} third wave of third-pillar law, following the wave of measures adopted post-Maastricht and the second wave of measures adopted post-Amsterdam and Tampere. The third wave of third-pillar law extends to most major areas of European integration in criminal law. New legislation involves the harmonization of substantive criminal law (including the terrorism, organized crime and racism and xenophobia), mutual recognition (with measures such as the European Evidence Warrant and legislation on the recognition of <b>probation</b> <b>decisions</b> and the transfer of sentenced persons), the work of EU criminal justice bodies such as Europol and Euro just, and the development of standards to regulate the proliferation of third pillar mechanisms to collect, analyze and exchange personal data. By analyzing the background and content of these instruments, this article will assess their impact on the future development of EU criminal law and justice.

5000|$|Originally {{intended}} by the producers {{as one of}} the housemates, Boy George (George Alan O'Dowd) had his request to appear on the final series of Celebrity Big Brother turned down by the Probation Service. O'Dowd was convicted in January 2009 for false imprisonment after he handcuffed a Norwegian man to a wall in his east London home. He was sentenced to 15 months imprisonment. Released from prison in May 2009 on licence from Her Majesty's Prison Service, various conditions were applied to his licence conditions, which terminated in April 2010. O'Dowd applied to the High Court for judicial review of the National <b>Probation</b> Service's <b>decision</b> to refuse his request to reside in the Big Brother house and not to report to his probation officer during his time in the house (or alternatively for the probation officer to meet him in the Big Brother house). Richard Clayton QC, representing the Probation Service, said O'Dowd's participation would pose [...] "a high level of risk" [...] to the service's reputation. Mr Clayton argued that if he used the show to promote his status as a celebrity and earn [...] "a lucrative sum of money" [...] it could undermine public confidence in the criminal justice system. The judge accepted that the <b>Probation</b> Service's <b>decision</b> was not unreasonable, meaning that O'Dowd could not appear.|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} the {{appliance}} of non-custodial penalties, completed by the necessity of respecting the measures of surveillance and/or certain obligations imposed by the court, is to ensure the re-socialization and reintegration into the community to which they belong. In this context, at the European Union’s level it was adopted 2008 / 947 /JHA Framework Decision of the Council on 27 November 2008 regarding the appliance of mutual recognition principle {{in the case of}} judgments and <b>probation</b> <b>decisions</b> for supervising the probation measures and alternative sanctions. The most important criterion under which judicial decision can be transmitted to another Member State is referring to the convicted person residency, considering that adopting such a measure the chances of social reintegration of the sentenced person will increase, allowing them to preserve the family, linguistic, cultural links. The probation service has a critical role for community supervision of the measures and obligations imposed by the Romanian court to the sentenced person. This institution has a number of specific tasks even when the Romanian court sends the legal judgment accompanied by the certificate in another Member State, seeking its recognition and enforcement. These responsibilities relate in particular to the cooperation activity that needs to be carried out with similarauthority of the executing Member State, since it can always intervene the possibility of restoring the competence of executing the decision of the Romanian court. The critical observations relate to the legislative act both European and our internal law...|$|R

Eleven students were detained by the police, cited, and released during the protest; these students {{became known as the}} [...] "Irvine 11". After an original recommendation of a one-year ban on the organization followed by another year of probation as well as fifty hours of community service by its members, UCI administrators reduced the punishment on appeal to a ban for an academic quarter, one hundred hours of community service, and two years of <b>probation.</b> The university's <b>decision</b> [...] "cited e-mails between members of the student union and detailed minutes from a Feb. 3 meeting", however, the MSU stated that the protest was done by individual students, and not MSU as a group.|$|R
40|$|This article {{describes}} a unique process which allows {{a select few}} {{students who have been}} dismissed for academic deficiency the opportunity to create a Plan for Academic Success (Plan), which, if accepted, reverses the academic dismissal for one semester. If the Plan is accepted, the individual student assumes responsibility for taking action to complete the required steps which will ultimately bring the Plan to fruition. The findings based on data from Fall 2002 —Fall 2007 indicate that students whose Plans were accepted were academically successful and were retained at a rate consistent with the retention rate of the institution as a whole. The College of Charleston (College) is a public liberal arts college with an undergraduate enrollment of 10, 000 students. The College requires students to maintain minimum scholastic attainment standards in order to avoid being placed on academic probation; failure to meet these standards within 15 credit hours of being placed on academic probation may result in academic dismissal. Oversight of the academic <b>probation</b> process and <b>decisions</b> regarding continued <b>probation</b> or academic dismissal are centralized in the office of Undergraduate Academic Services. Students who have been dismissed for academic deficiency have the opportunity to meet with the director of Undergraduate Academic Services to discuss the circumstances that led to their dismissal. Most students Dismissed for Academic Deficiency (DAD) are required to leave the College for one or more semesters before they can re-apply and be readmitted. However, each semester a small number of students is given the opportunity to write a Plan for Academic Success (Plan), with the possibility of having their dismissal status changed to probation status. The Plan is unique to the College of Charleston, both in terms of its composition and the high level of self-advocacy and responsibility that is placed upon the student. The Plan has proven to be effective in terms of retention and graduation of students...|$|R
