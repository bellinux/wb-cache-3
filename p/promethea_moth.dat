25|$|While {{the starry}} five-pointed leaves of Liquidambar {{resemble}} those of some maples (Acer), Liquidambar is easily distinguished from Acer by its glossy, leathery leaves that are positioned singly (alternate), not in pairs (opposite) on the stems. Luna and <b>Promethea</b> <b>moth</b> caterpillars feed on the leaves.|$|E
50|$|The larvae of the spicebush {{swallowtail}} {{are easily}} found inside leaves {{that have been}} folded over by the application of silk; small larvae are brown, resembling bird droppings, and mature larvae are green. The anterior of a larva has two large eyespots and resembles {{the head of a}} snake. Since one or more broods (generations) of spicebush swallowtails typically occur each year, spicebush is a useful plant for the butterfly garden, since the egg-laying females are strongly attracted to it. <b>Promethea</b> <b>moth</b> cocoons, if present, are obvious during the cold season after leaf drop, and resemble dead leaves still hanging from twigs. Neither of these insects is ever present in sufficient quantities to defoliate a medium through large spicebush, although very small specimens may suffer even from a single caterpillar.|$|E
40|$|The <b>promethea</b> <b>moth</b> Callosamia promethea is one {{of three}} species of silkmoths from the genus Callosamia that occur in North America. Cross {{attraction}} of males to heterospecific calling females has been observed in the field, and hybrid progeny have been produced by pairing heterospecifics in captivity. These observations suggest that all three species share or have considerable overlap in the sex attractant pheromones produced by females, so that other prezygotic isolating mechanisms, such as diel differences in reproductive activity, limit hybridization in the field. Coupled gas chromatography-electroantennogram detection and gas chromatography- mass-spectrometry analyses of extracts of volatiles collected from female promethea moths supported the identification of (4 E, 6 E, 11 Z, 13 Z) -hexadeca- 4, 6, 11, 13 -tetraenal [(4 E, 6 E, 11 Z, 13 Z) - 16 :Ald] as the compound in extracts that elicited the largest responses from antennae of males. The identification was confirmed by non-selective synthesis of several isomers as analytical standards, and stereoselective synthesis of (4 E, 6 E, 11 Z, 13 Z) - 16 :Ald for testing in field trials. Male moths were strongly attracted to synthetic (4 E, 6 E, 11 Z, 13 Z) - 16 :Ald, suggesting that this compound is the major and possibly the only component of the sex pheromone of these large saturniid moths. Based on the cross-attraction of heterospecifics, it is likely that this is also a major pheromone component of the other two North American Callosamia species as well.
