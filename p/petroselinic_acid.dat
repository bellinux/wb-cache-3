30|$|Transdifferentiation {{involves}} reprogramming {{one type}} of adult cell into another mature cell type, without having to generate intermediary stem cells. It has received significant attention because it may have {{a considerable number of}} applications in cell and cancer therapy. Successful transdifferentiation from one cell type to another by overexpressing lineage-specific genes in vivo (Takeuchi &[Bruneau 2009]; Zhou et al.[2008]) and in vitro (Graf &[Enver 2009]; Ieda et al.[2010]) has been previously reported. Not only can cell transdifferentiation be enforced through the overexpression of the appropriate set of genes, but also through the application of specific molecules, which is a promising alternative to conventional chemotherapy for cancer treatment, for example, the use of all-trans-Retinoid acid (ATRA) for the treatment of acute promyelocitic leukemia (APL) (Kakizuka et al.[1991]). The fact that there was no treatment based on cell differentiation therapy for solid tumors prompted us to study whether novel transdifferentiating molecules secreted by human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) could prevent cancer progression. Our studies showed that, irrespective of the presence of hESCs, albumin-associated lipids (albuMAX®), and specifically poly- and monounsaturated fatty <b>acids</b> (linoleic, oleic, <b>petroselinic</b> and palmitoleic <b>acids)</b> accounted for the transdifferentiation of several distinct human cancer cell lines (HCCLs) into adipocyte-like cells (Ruiz-Vela et al.[2011]).|$|R
40|$|AbstractIn this study, {{the effects}} of {{salinity}} on growth, fatty acid, essential oil, and phenolic composition of cumin (Cuminum cyminum L.) seeds {{as well as the}} antioxidant activities of their extracts were investigated. Plants were treated with different concentrations of NaCl treatment: 0, 50, 75, and 125 mmoL. Plant growth was significantly reduced with the severity of saline treatment. This also caused important reductions in the seed yield and yield components. Besides, NaCl treatments affected fatty <b>acid</b> composition. <b>Petroselinic</b> and linoleic <b>acids</b> proportions diminished consistently with the increase in NaCl concentration, whereas palmitic acid proportion increased. Furthermore, NaCl enhanced essential oil production in C. cyminum seeds and induced marked changes on the essential oil quality. Essential oil chemotype was modified from γ-terpinene/ 1 -phenyl- 1, 2 ethanediol in control to γ-terpinene/β-pinene in salt stressed plants. Total polyphenol content was higher in treated seeds, and salinity improved the amount of individual phenolic compounds. Moreover, antioxidant activities of the extracts were determined by four different test systems, namely 2, 2 -diphenyl- 1 -picrylhydrazyl, β-carotene/linoleic acid chelating, and reducing power assays. The highest antioxidant activities were reveled in severe stressed plants. In this case, cumin seeds produced under saline conditions may function as a potential source of essential oil and antioxidant compounds, which could support the utilization of this plant in a large field of applications such as food industry...|$|R

30|$|<b>Petroselinic</b> <b>acid,</b> a {{positional}} isomer of oleic acid, was {{isolated from the}} vegetable oil of Coriandrum sativum fruits. This uncommon fatty acid was subsequently used as substrate for sophorolipid fermentation with a Starmerella bombicola lactone esterase overexpression (oe sble) strain. A <b>petroselinic</b> <b>acid</b> based diacetylated sophorolipid lactone was obtained in high purity without incorporation of de novo synthesized fatty acids such as oleic acid. A total production of 40  g/L was obtained. The <b>petroselinic</b> <b>acid</b> based sophorolipid lactone was subsequently hydrolyzed towards the <b>petroselinic</b> <b>acid</b> based sophorolipid acid. For both compounds, their critical micelle concentration (CMC) and corresponding surface tension were compared to their oleic acid based counterparts. Both <b>petroselinic</b> <b>acid</b> based sophorolipids displayed a much lower CMC value than their oleic acid based counterparts, although their minimal surface tension was the same. Besides, the sophorolipid fermentation product was chemically modified towards a novel C 12 sophorolipid aldehyde. This derivative constitutes an interesting building block for further modification towards new-to-nature sophorolipids with high potential for self-assembly applications.|$|E
40|$|We have {{previously}} {{demonstrated that the}} double bond of <b>petroselinic</b> <b>acid</b> (18 : 1 [delta] 6 cis) in coriander (Coriandrum sativum L.) seed results from the activity of a 36 -kD desaturase that is structurally related to the [delta] 9 -stearoyl-acyl carrier protein (ACP) desaturase (E. B. Cahoon, J. Shanklin, J. B. Ohlrogge [1992] Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 89 : 11184 - 11188). To further characterize the biosynthetic pathway of this unusual fatty acid, 14 C-labeling experiments were conducted using developing endosperm of coriander. Studies were also performed using suspension cultures of transgenic tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum L.) that express the coriander 36 -kD desaturase, {{and as a result}} produce <b>petroselinic</b> <b>acid</b> and [delta] 4 -hexadecenoic acid. When supplied exogenously to coriander endosperm slices, [1 - 14 C]palmitic acid and stearic acid were incorporated into glycerolipids but were not converted to <b>petroselinic</b> <b>acid.</b> This suggested that <b>petroselinic</b> <b>acid</b> is not formed by the desaturation of a fatty acid bound to a glycerolipid or by reactions involving acyl-coenzyme As (CoA). Instead, evidence was most consistent with an acyl-ACP route of <b>petroselinic</b> <b>acid</b> synthesis. For example, the exogenous feeding of [1 - 14 C]lauric acid and myristic acid to coriander endosperm slices resulted in the incorporation of the radiolabels into long-chain fatty acids, including primarily <b>petroselinic</b> <b>acid,</b> presumably through acyl-ACP-associated reactions. In addition, using an in vitro fatty acid biosynthetic system, homogenates of coriander endosperm incorporated [2 - 14 C]malonyl-CoA into <b>petroselinic</b> <b>acid,</b> of which a portion was detected in a putative acyl-ACP fraction. Furthermore, analysis of transgenic tobacco suspension cultures expressing the coriander 36 -kD desaturase revealed significant amounts of <b>petroselinic</b> <b>acid</b> and [delta] 4 -hexadecenoic acid in the acyl-ACP pool of these cells. Also presented is evidence derived from [U- 14 C]nonanoic acid labeling of coriander endosperm, which demonstrates that the coriander 36 -kD desaturase positions double bonds relative to the carboxyl end of acyl-ACP substrates. The data obtained in these studies are rationalized in terms of a biosynthetic pathway of <b>petroselinic</b> <b>acid</b> involving the [delta] 4 desaturation of palmitoyl-ACP by the 36 -kD desaturase followed by two-carbon elongation of the resulting [delta] 4 -hexadecenoyl-ACP...|$|E
40|$|Studies were {{conducted}} to characterize the metabolism of the unusual fatty acid <b>petroselinic</b> <b>acid</b> (18 : 1 cis[delta] 6) in developing endosperm of the Umbelliferae species coriander (Coriandrum sativum L.) and carrot (Daucus carota L.). Analyses of fatty acid compositions of glycerolipids of these tissues revealed a dissimilar distribution of <b>petroselinic</b> <b>acid</b> in triacylglycerols (TAG) and the major polar lipids phosphatidylcholine (PC) and phosphatidylethanolamine (PE). <b>Petroselinic</b> <b>acid</b> comprised 70 to 75 mol% of the fatty acids of TAG but only 9 to 20 mol% of the fatty acids of PC and PE. Although such data appeared to suggest that <b>petroselinic</b> <b>acid</b> is at least partially excluded from polar lipids, results of [1 - 14 C]acetate radiolabeling experiments gave a much different picture of the metabolism of this fatty acid. In time-course labeling of carrot endosperm, [1 - 14 C]acetate was rapidly incorporated into PC in high levels. Through 30 min, radiolabel was most concentrated in PC, and of this, 80 to 85 % was {{in the form of}} <b>petroselinic</b> <b>acid.</b> One explanation for the large disparity in amounts of <b>petroselinic</b> <b>acid</b> in PC as determined by fatty acid mass analyses and 14 C radiolabeling is that turnover of these lipids or the fatty acids of these lipids results in relatively low accumulation of <b>petroselinic</b> <b>acid</b> mass. Consistent with this, the kinetics of [1 - 14 C]acetate time-course labeling of carrot endosperm and "pulse-chase" labeling of coriander endosperm suggested a possible flux of fatty acids from PC into TAG. In time-course experiments, radiolabel initially entered PC at the highest rates but accumulated in TAG at later time points. Similarly, in pulse-chase studies, losses in absolute amounts of radioactivity from PC were accompanied by significant increases of radiolabel in TAG. In addition, stereospecific analyses of unlabeled and [1 - 14 C]acetate-labeled PC of coriander endosperm indicated that <b>petroselinic</b> <b>acid</b> can be readily incorporated into both the sn- 1 and sn- 2 positions of this lipid. Because <b>petroselinic</b> <b>acid</b> is neither synthesized nor further modified on polar lipids, the apparent metabolism of this fatty acid through PC (and possibly through other polar lipids) may define a function of PC in TAG assembly apart from its involvement in fatty acid modification reactions...|$|E
30|$|Different {{hydrophobic}} substrates {{other than}} oleic acid {{have already been}} reported for sophorolipid fermentation, for example hydroxylated fatty acids (Van Bogaert et al. 2011 b), arachidonic acid (Prabhune et al. 2002; Shah and Prabhune 2007; Van Bogaert et al. 2009), linoleic acid (Kasture et al. 2008) and linolenic acid (Gupta and Prabhune 2012). In this work, a synthetic pathway towards new-to-nature sophorolipids was developed via the incorporation of <b>petroselinic</b> <b>acid</b> 1 in the fermentation pathway. Incorporation of <b>petroselinic</b> <b>acid</b> in sophorolipid derivatives was never described before and offers many advantages. First of all, high amounts of <b>petroselinic</b> <b>acid</b> 1 {{are present in the}} vegetable oil of C. sativum fruits, making this fatty acid economically interesting as hydrophobic substrate for sophorolipid fermentation. Furthermore, the position of the double bond of <b>petroselinic</b> <b>acid</b> 1 greatly influences the characteristics of this fatty acid as compared to oleic acid. Therefore, it is anticipated that incorporation of <b>petroselinic</b> <b>acid</b> in sophorolipid compounds can also have a great influence on the sophorolipid properties. Besides, synthesis of sophorolipid compounds with the double bond at an alternative position opens possibilities for the synthesis of mid-chain C 12 sophorolipid derivatives via an ozonolysis reaction.|$|E
40|$|Little {{is known}} about the {{metabolic}} origin of <b>petroselinic</b> <b>acid</b> (18 : 1 delta 6 cis), the principal fatty acid of the seed oil of most Umbelliferae, Araliaceae, and Garryaceae species. To examine the possibility that <b>petroselinic</b> <b>acid</b> is the product of an acyl-acyl carrier protein (ACP) desaturase, Western blots of coriander and other Umbelliferae seed extracts were probed with antibodies against the delta 9 -stearoyl-ACP desaturase of avocado. In these extracts, proteins of 39 and 36 kDa were detected. Of these, only the 36 -kDa peptide was specific to tissues which synthesize <b>petroselinic</b> <b>acid.</b> A cDNA encoding the 36 -kDa peptide was isolated from a coriander endosperm cDNA library, placed under control of the cauliflower mosaic virus 35 S promoter, and introduced into tobacco by Agrobacterium tumefaciens-mediated transformation.

This modified strain only produces sophorolipid lactones, thus resulting in a more homogenous sophorolipid product {{than the one that}} can be obtained with the S. bombicola wild type. The desired sophorolipid lactone 5 was obtained in high purity without incorporation of de novo synthesized fatty acids. The corresponding <b>petroselinic</b> <b>acid</b> based sophorolipid acid 7 was synthesized from sophorolipid lactone 5 via alkaline hydrolysis. <b>Petroselinic</b> <b>acid</b> based sophorolipid lactone 5 and acid 7 have a much lower CMC value than their oleic acid based counterparts, which indicates that the fatty acid incorporated in the sophorolipid has a great influence on the geometric structure of the derivatives.

40|$|A {{new type}} of {{composite}} membrane is introduced to mimic plant uptake of hydrophobic organic contaminants (HOCs). <b>Petroselinic</b> <b>acid</b> (cis- 6 -octadecenoic acid),the major component of plant lipids, was embedded in the matrix of cellulose acetate polymer to form the <b>petroselinic</b> <b>acid</b> embedded cellulose acetate membrane (PECAM). Accumulation of the polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) naphthalene (Nap), phenanthrene (Phe), pyrene (Pyr), and benz(a) pyrene (Bap) by PECAM was compared with their uptake by plants. The accumulation of Nap, Phe, Pyr, and Bap by PECAM reached equilibrium in 24, 48, 144, and 192 h, respectively. The petroselinic acid-water partition coefficients (log K(pw), 3. 37, 4. 90, 5. 24, and 6. 28 for Nap, Phe, Pyr, and Bap, respectively) were positively correlated with the hydrophobicity of the compounds (R(2) = 0. 995) and were almost {{the same as the}} lipid-normalized root partition coefficients (log K(lip)) for the corresponding compounds.

In the first experiment, rainbow trout were fed one of eight diets containing fish, flax, canola or Camelina sativa oil with or without coriander oil. Coriander oil in the diet increased concentrations of eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA; 20 : 5 n- 3) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA; 22 : 6 n- 3, P < 0. 05) in the fillet. There was a trend to increased 20 : 5 n- 3 + 22 : 6 n- 3 / 20 : 4 n- 6 ratios when coriander oil was added to the diet (P = 0. 067). The second trial set out to investigate the effects of varied levels of coriander oil in canola oil based diets, on i) the capacity of rainbow trout hepatocytes to desaturate, elongate and esterify [1 - 14 C] α-linolenic acid (18 : 3 n- 3; ALA) and [1 - 14 C] linoleic acid (18 : 2 n- 6, LA), ii) reducing the production of 20 : 4 n- 6 in hepatocytes and iii) gene expression. This experiment demonstrated a significant increase in 22 : 6 n- 3 (P = 0. 011) and a decrease 20 : 4 n- 6 (P = 0. 023) in rainbow trout hepatocytes. Furthermore, there was a three-fold decrease in acetate for the [1 - 14 C] 18 : 2 n- 6 and nearly a two-fold increase for the [1 - 14 C] 18 : 3 n- 3 substrate when coriander was added at increasing levels, illustrating an increase in peroxisomal β-oxidation. Relative gene expression of ∆ 6 desaturase decreased with addition of coriander oil at the 0. 5 inclusion level of coriander oil. The final experiment was conducted to determine if bypassing the first ∆ 6 desaturase and rate-limiting step in the n- 3 FA pathway causes increased conversion of stearidonic acid (SDA; 18 : 4 n- 3) to 20 : 5 n- 3 and 22 : 6 n- 3. Rainbow trout were fed one of six diets containing either fish, conventional linseed (flax), or SDA enriched linseed oil (LO) with and without coriander oil. Inclusion of coriander oil did not affect any growth or feed intake parameters of rainbow trout. However, the addition of coriander oil caused a significant increase in whole body 22 : 6 n- 3 and 20 : 4 n- 6 concentrations in fish fed SDA enriched LO with coriander oil (SDA+C) compared to fish fed conventional linseed oil (LO). These results suggest that <b>petroselinic</b> <b>acid,</b> found in coriander oil, has the ability to influence FA bioconversion of the n- 3 and n- 6 FA pathway thereby increasing 22 : 6 n- 3 and possibly 20 : 5 n- 3 in rainbow trout and reducing ARA when fed VO-based diets. Furthermore, it seems as though <b>petroselinic</b> <b>acid</b> causes improved bioconversion to 22 : 6 n- 3 when the first ∆ 6 desaturase is bypassed.

Regulations are more and more strict and alternative more and more searched. In general, those ones consist in the use of substitution solvents. Thus, the purpose of this work was designed to evaluate the performances of a green solvent compared to n-hexane in aniseed oil extraction...|$|E
40|$|AbstractTo {{evaluate}} {{the accumulation of}} oil and fatty acids in coriander during fruit ripening, a field experiment was conducted under organic cultivation conditions in Auch (near Toulouse, southwestern France) during the 2009 cropping season. The percentage and composition of the fatty acids of coriander were determined by gas chromatography. Our results showed that rapid oil accumulation started in early stages (two days after flowering, DAF). Twelve fatty acids were identified. Saturated and polyunsaturated acids were the dominant fatty acids at earlier stages (2 – 12 DAF), but decreased after this date. After this stage, <b>petroselinic</b> <b>acid</b> increased to its highest amount at 18 DAF. In contrast, palmitic acid followed the opposite trend. Saturated and polyunsaturated fatty acids decreased markedly and monounsaturated fatty acids increased during fruit maturation. It appears that the fruit of coriander may be harvested before full maturity...|$|E

The TAG structure ultimately determines the final physical properties of the oils and the position of FAs in the TAG molecule affects the digestion; absorption and metabolism; and physical and technological properties of TAGs. Fixed oils from the fruits of dill (Anethum graveolens), caraway (Carum carvi), cumin (Cuminum cyminum), coriander (Coriandrum sativum), anise (Pimpinella anisum), carrot (Daucus carota), celery (Apium graveolens), fennel (Foeniculum vulgare), and Khella (Ammi visnaga), all from the Apiaceae family, were extracted at room temperature in chloroform/methanol (2 : 1 v/v) using percolators. Crude lipids were fractionated by solid phase extraction to separate neutral triacylglycerols (TAGs) from other lipids components. Neutral TAGs were subjected to transesterification process to convert them to their corresponding fatty acids methyl esters (FAMES) using 1 % boron trifluoride (BF 3) in methanol. FAMES were analyzed by gas chromatography-quadrupole time of flight (GC-QTOF) mass spectrometry. Triglycerides were analyzed using high performance liquid chromatography-quadrupole time of flight (LC-QTOF) mass spectrometry. <b>Petroselinic</b> <b>acid</b> was the major fatty acid in all samples ranging from 57 % of the total fatty acids in caraway up to 82 % in fennel. All samples contained palmitic (16 : 0), palmitoleic (C 16 : 1 n- 9), stearic (C 18 : 0), petroselinic (C 18 : 1 n- 12), linoleic (C 18 : 2 n- 6), linolinic (18 : 3 n- 3), and arachidic (C 20 : 0) acids. TAG were analyzed using LC-QTOF for accurate mass identification and mass spectrometry/mass spectrometry (MS/MS) techniques for regiospesific elucidation of the identified TAGs. Five major TAGs were detected in all samples but with different relative concentrations in all of the tested samples. Several other TAGs were detected as minor components and were present in some samples and absence in the others. Regiospecific analysis showed a non-random fatty acids distribution. <b>Petroselinic</b> <b>acid</b> was predominantly located at the sn- 1 and sn- 3 positions...|$|E
40|$|Coriander (Coriandrum sativum L.), a herbal plant, {{belonging}} to the family Apiceae, is valued for its culinary and medicinal uses. All parts of this herb are in use as flavoring agent and/or as traditional remedies {{for the treatment of}} different disorders in the folk medicine systems of different civilizations. The plant is a potential source of lipids (rich in <b>petroselinic</b> <b>acid)</b> and an essential oil (high in linalool) isolated from the seeds and the aerial parts. Due to the presence of a multitude of bioactives, a wide array of pharmacological activities have been ascribed to different parts of this herb, which include anti-microbial, anti-oxidant, anti-diabetic, anxiolytic, anti-epileptic, anti-depressant, anti-mutagenic, anti-inflammatory, anti-dyslipidemic, anti-hypertensive, neuro-protective and diuretic. Interestingly, coriander also possessed lead-detoxifying potential. This review focuses on the medicinal uses, detailed phytochemistry, and the biological activities of this valuable herb to explore its potential uses as a functional food for the nutraceutical industry...|$|E
