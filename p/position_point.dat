50|$|The most {{important}} archaeological discovery in Cephalonia (and indeed in Greece) {{of the past}} twenty years is that, in 1991, of the Mycenaean tholos tomb at the outskirts of Tzanata, near Poros in southeastern Cephalonia (Municipality of Elios-Pronni) in a lovely setting of olive trees, cypresses and oaks. The tomb was erected around 1300 B.C; kings and highly ranked officials were buried in such tombs during the Mycenaean period. It constitutes the largest tholos tomb yet found in northwestern Greece and was excavated by archaeologist Lazaros Kolonas. The size of the tomb, the nature of the burial offerings found there, and its well-chosen <b>position</b> <b>point</b> to the existence of an important Mycenaean town in the vicinity.|$|E

50|$|The {{point guard}} (PG), {{also called the}} one or point, {{is one of the}} five {{positions}} in a regulation basketball game. A point guard has perhaps the most specialized role of any <b>position.</b> <b>Point</b> guards are expected to run the team's offense by controlling the ball and making sure that it gets to the right players at the right time. Above all, the point guard must totally understand and accept their coach's game plan; in this way, the position can be compared to a quarterback in American football or a playmaker in association football (soccer). While the guard must understand and accept the coach's gameplan, he must also be able to adapt to what the defense is allowing, and he also must control the pace of the game.|$|E

Kostka extended his lead by adding the pole <b>position</b> <b>point</b> to his tally, but after an eventful race, it was Sini who prevailed. Sini won the race with an extra point for fastest lap, while Kostka finished down in fourth place after contact with Sini's team-mate Giovanni Berton and Diego Romanini - breaking a halfshaft and causing a puncture respectively - which gave Sini the title by one point. Baldan had already been eliminated from contention after being involved in a first lap incident with Team BMW Dinamic team-mates Max Mugelli and Niccolò Mercatali.|$|E

50|$|Some, {{including}} some fundamentalist Christians, condemn the ecumenical councils for other reasons. Independency or congregationalist polity among Protestants may involve {{the rejection of}} any governmental structure or binding authority above local congregations; conformity to the decisions of these councils is therefore considered purely voluntary and the councils are to be considered binding only insofar as those doctrines are derived from the Scriptures. Many of these churches reject the idea that anyone other than the authors of Scripture can directly lead other Christians by original divine authority; after the New Testament, they assert, the doors of revelation were closed and councils can only give advice or guidance, but have no authority. They consider new doctrines not derived from the sealed canon of Scripture to be both impossible and unnecessary whether proposed by church councils or by more recent prophets. Catholic and Orthodox objections to this <b>position</b> <b>point</b> {{to the fact that}} the Canon of Scripture itself was fixed by these councils. They conclude that this would lead to a logical inconsistency of a non-authoritative body fixing a supposedly authoritative source.|$|E
50|$|Archaeological finds {{from the}} Drakaina cave in the {{beautiful}} gorge of Poros, which was excavated in recent years, confirm human habitation in Poros since 5,700 B.C. Interesting finds brought to light - tools made of stone and bone, figurines, pottery - tell us {{a good deal about}} the use of the cave in prehistoric and historic times. Finds from the Classical period indicate that the cave was then associated with the cult of the Nymphs. The name Drakena (She-Dragon) refers to the local legend of a dragon that lived in the gorge of Poros. In the popular imagination certain marks in the rocks {{on the side of the}} gorge were believed to be the dragon's foot prints. The area around Poros was certainly inhabited during the period when Mycenae was all-powerful, evidenced by the discovery, in 1991, of a tholos (Beehive tomb) in nearby Tzanata. The size of the tomb, the nature of the burial offerings found there and its well chosen <b>position</b> <b>point</b> to the existence of an important Mycenaean town in the vicinity. In the Archaeological Museum of Argostoli one can admire the major findings of the tholos tomb like golden bull horns, a golden double axe and engraved seals of precious stone. Although other tombs from the Mycenaean period have been found on the island, notably at Mazarakata and Lakithra, the Tzanata tomb is the most impressive yet to be discovered on Cephalonia or Ithaca.|$|E
