40|$|The {{subject of}} this {{investigation}} was the film boiling of liquid drops on a hot horizontal surface (the Leidenfrost Phenomenon). Using Gottfried and Bell 2 ̆ 7 s model of a Leidenfrost drop, the thickness of the vapor cushion beneath film boiling water drops, 6, was calculated over a range of <b>test</b> <b>plate</b> and drop temperatures. The results indicated that the vapor cushion thickness varied very slowly with <b>test</b> <b>plate</b> temperature and maintained a finite value at <b>test</b> <b>plate</b> temperatures where the Leidenfrost Phenomenon cannot be initiated. To experimentally verify this fact, a heat exchanger was fabricated to cool the hot <b>test</b> <b>plate</b> while water drops were film boiling on it. This revealed that the Leidenfrost state can be maintained down to an average <b>test</b> <b>plate</b> temperature of 54 C. The assumption that Leidenfrost drops exist at the boiling point of the liquid was tested.

40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (p. 104 - 116). Ammonia is {{the major}} end-product of protein catabolism in abalone, and is excreted into the surrounding water. Build-up of ammonia in abalone aquaculture systems can reach high toxic levels and impact negatively on farming operations. Ammonia levels therefore have to be regulated. Accurate estimates of toxic un-ionized ammonia (FAN) from the total ammonia nitrogen (TAN) measured by <b>photometer</b> <b>test</b> kits is crucial as inaccuracies could result in major losses of abalone on the farms. The accuracy and applicability of two frequently used <b>photometer</b> <b>test</b> kits (the Nesslers method and the Palintest method) were compared. The calculated TAN concentrations were regressed against the prepared standard ammonia concentrations in seawater for both methods. The predicted slope (β = 1) if the methods were 100 % accurate was compared to observed slopes using the Nesslers (β= 0. 8327) and Palintest (β = 0. 7507) methods. Both these test kits underestimated the TAN concentrations, but the Nesslers method was more accurate. Nitrites and nitrates are toxic to abalone at much larger concentrations than ammonia and exist at low concentrations in natural systems, therefore the sensitivity of their tests was not as important. Nitrites and nitrates were monitored using the Ferrous sulphate method and the Cadmium reduction method, respectively...|$|R

40|$|Determining the {{temperature}} distribution within a semitransparent medium using remotely sensed spectral emission data {{is called the}} spectral remote sensing (SRS) method.

40|$|The direct {{detection}} of organic biomarkers for living or fossil microbes on Mars by an in situ instrument {{is a worthy}} goal for future lander missions. Several new and innovative biotechnology approaches are being explored. Firstly we have proposed an instrument based on immunological reactions to specific antibodies to cause activation of fluorescent stains. Antibodies are raised or acquired {{to a variety of}} general and specific substances that might be in Mars soil. These antibodies are then combined with various fluorescent stains and applied to micron sized numbered spots on a small (2 - 3 cm) <b>test</b> <b>plate</b> where they become firmly attached after freeze drying. Using technology that has been developed for gene mining in DNA technology up to 10, 000 tests per square inch can now be applied to a <b>test</b> <b>plate.</b> On Mars or the planet/moon of interest, a sample of soil from a trench or drill core is extracted with water and/or an organic solvent and ultrasonication and then applied to the <b>test</b> <b>plate.</b> Any substance, which has an antibody on the <b>test</b> <b>plate,</b> will react with its antibody and activate its fluorescent stain. At the moment a small UV light source will illuminate the <b>test</b> <b>plate,</b> which is observed with a small CCD camera, although other detection systems will be applied. The numbered spots that fluoresce indicate the presence of the tested-for substance, and the intensity indicates relative amounts. Furthermore with up to a thousand <b>test</b> <b>plates</b> available false positives and several variations of antibody can also be screened for. The entire instrument can be quite small and light, on the order of 10 cm in each dimension. A possible choice for light source may be small UV lasers at several wavelengths. Some of the wells or spots can contain simply standard fluorescent stains used to detect live cells, dead cells, DNA, etc. The stains in these spots may be directly activated, with no antibodies being necessary. The proposed system will look for three classes of biomarkers: those from extant life, such as DNA, those from extinct life such as hopanes, and those from organic compounds not necessarily associated with life such as PAHs, rocket exhaust contamination and other a/pre-biotic chemicals. Both monoclonal and polyclonal antibodies can be used. Monoclonal antibodies react with a very specific compound, but polyclonal antibodies may react to any of a whole family of compounds. Furthermore the technique of phage display to raise antibodies against classically non-antigenic molecules is also being considered.
