5|$|The Newfoundland Referendums of 1948 were {{a series}} of two referendums to decide the <b>political</b> <b>future</b> of the Dominion of Newfoundland. Before the referendums, Newfoundland was in debt and went through several {{delegations}} {{to determine whether the}} country would join Canada, remain under British rule or regain independence. The voting for the referendums occurred on June 3 and July 22, 1948. The eventual result was for Newfoundland to enter Canadian Confederation.|$|E
5|$|Despite the one-sided {{national}} loss in 1984, Ferraro {{was still}} viewed as {{someone with a}} bright <b>political</b> <b>future.</b> Many expected her {{to run in the}} 1986 United States Senate election in New York against first-term Republican incumbent Al D'Amato, and during 1985 she did Upstate New York groundwork towards that end. A Senate candidacy had been her original plan for her career, before she was named to Mondale's ticket. But in , she said she would not run, due to an ongoing U.S. Justice Department probe on her and her husband's finances stemming from the 1984 campaign revelations.|$|E
5|$|The United Nations Security Council {{brokered}} the Renville Agreement in {{an attempt}} to rectify the collapsed Linggarjati Agreement. The agreement was ratified in January 1948 and recognised a cease-fire along the so-called 'Van Mook line'; an artificial line which connected the most advanced Dutch positions. Many Republican positions, however, were still held behind the Dutch lines. The agreement also required referenda to be held on the <b>political</b> <b>future</b> of the Dutch held areas. The apparent reasonableness of Republicans garnered much important American goodwill.|$|E

5|$|By March 1808, Jennings {{believed}} that his {{future in the}} Harrison-dominated {{western part of the}} territory was bleak. By November he had left Vincennes and moved to Jeffersonville, in Clark County, Indiana Territory, before settling in nearby Charlestown. Jennings may have believed his <b>political</b> <b>future</b> would have more success {{in the eastern part of}} the territory. Settlements in the southeast and eastern portion of the territory opposed slavery and Harrison's aristocratic manner, which were similar to Jennings's beliefs, while the western portion of the territory and Vincennes area remained proslavery. Although petitions to allow slavery were received before the formation of the Indiana Territory, the issue attracted widespread attention in 1807 when Harrison and his supporters in the territorial legislature revived efforts to allow slavery in the territory. Jennings and his supporters who opposed slavery wrote writing articles appearing in the Vincennes Western Sun newspaper attacking Harrison's administration, its pro-slavery sentiments, and aristocratic policies.|$|E
5|$|During the {{beginning}} of the second Bhutto Administration, a Bhutto family feud between Benazir and her mother, Nusrat Bhutto, surfaced over the <b>political</b> <b>future</b> of Murtaza Bhutto, Nusrat's son and Benazir's younger brother. Benazir thanked Zardari for his support. In September 1996, Murtaza and seven others died in a shootout with police in Karachi, while the city was undergoing a three-year civil war. At Murtaza's funeral, Nusrat accused Benazir and Zardari of being responsible and vowed to pursue prosecution. Ghinwa Bhutto, Murtaza's widow, also accused Zardari of being behind his killing. President Farooq Leghari, who would dismiss the Bhutto government seven weeks after Murtaza's death, also suspected Benazir and Zardari's involvement. Several of Pakistan's leading newspapers alleged that Zardari wanted his brother-in-law out of the way because of Murtaza's activities as head of a breakaway faction of the PPP.|$|E
5|$|During the campaign, Kemp's {{endorsement}} {{was highly}} coveted. Forbes {{had tried to}} get Kemp {{to run in the}} 1996 campaign, but Kemp declined and in fact endorsed Forbes just as Dole was closing in on the nomination, and just after Dole gained the endorsements of former contenders Lamar Alexander and Richard Lugar. Some feel the primary reason for the endorsement was to keep the flat tax idea and other supply-side views alive. Many thought Kemp had destroyed his own <b>political</b> <b>future</b> with the endorsement, and Kemp profusely apologized to Dole's campaign offices. After it became clear Dole would be the nominee, Kemp attempted to form a bipartisan seminar with Felix Rohatyn to produce a fiscal plan that could be endorsed by both parties.|$|E

40|$|A 24 -hour {{exchange}} market was created on the Web to trade <b>political</b> <b>futures</b> contracts using fictitious money. In this online market, a <b>political</b> <b>futures</b> contract is a futures contract which matures {{on the election}} day with a liquidation price determined by the percentage of votes a candidate receives on the election day. Continuous double auctions were implemented as the system for order storage and price discovery. We drew market participants {{in the form of}} tournaments in which top traders won cash awards. Such a market was run, with about 400 registered traders, during the U. S. presidential election in November 2004 and Taiwan parliamentary election in December 2004. The experiments recorded transaction price, highest bid, lowest ask, and trading volume of each contract as a function of time. Despite the relatively small scale of the exchange, {{in terms of the number}} of participants and duration of the tournament, we report evidence for asymptotic power-law behaviors of the distributions of price returns, trading volumes, inter-transaction time intervals, and accumulated wealth that were found universal in real financial markets.

5|$|Seeking a {{union with}} the United States was not a {{referendum}} option, despite the idea having some currency amongst locals. With the Cold War looming, U.S. interest in Newfoundland were centered primarily on its strategic importance to the defence of North America. The Americans' ability to maintain bases on the island satisfied those concerns - after receiving assurances that the Canadian government would honour the leases for bases on Newfoundland, the U.S. State department had no further interest in the <b>political</b> <b>future</b> of Newfoundland. President Harry S. Truman's administration had little incentive to pursue annexation. With respect to foreign policy, such a territorial ambition would have only served to antagonize two key allies. With respect to domestic policy, the administration would not likely {{have been able to}} convince Congress to offer statehood to Newfoundland due to its small population and geographical isolation from the then-48 existing states, and would not likely have been able to convince Newfoundlanders to accept territorial status as an alternative to admission as a U.S. state.|$|E
5|$|The {{integration}} of the princely states {{raised the question of}} the future of the remaining colonial enclaves in India. At independence, the regions of Pondicherry, Karikal, Yanam, Mahe and Chandernagore were still colonies of France, and Daman and Diu, Dadra and Nagar Haveli and Goa remained colonies of Portugal. An agreement between France and India in 1948 provided for an election in France's remaining Indian possessions to choose their <b>political</b> <b>future.</b> A plebiscite held in Chandernagore on 19 June 1949 resulted in a vote of 7,463 to 114 in favour of being integrated with India. It was ceded to India on a de facto basis on 14 August 1949 and de jure on 2 May 1950. In the other enclaves, however, the pro-French camp, led by Edouard Goubert, used the administrative machinery to suppress the pro-merger groups. Popular discontent rose, and in 1954 demonstrations in Yanam and Mahe resulted in pro-merger groups assuming power. A referendum in Pondicherry and Karaikal in October 1954 resulted in a vote in favour of merger, and on 1 November 1954, de facto control over all four enclaves was transferred to the Republic of India. A treaty of cession was signed in May 1956, and following ratification by the French National Assembly in May 1962, de jure control of the enclaves was also transferred.|$|E
5|$|The signatories had {{all been}} active in Lithuania's {{independence}} movement. Antanas Smetona, Donatas Malinauskas, and several others had participated in secret Lithuanian fellowships in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. These groups were involved in promoting the illegal distribution of Lithuanian-language publications using the Latin alphabet, which was banned by the Tsarist government from 1866 to 1904, as well as fighting other attempts at Russification by the authorities. Antanas Smetona, Steponas Kairys, Alfonsas Petrulis, and Mykolas Biržiška were expelled from their secondary schools for these activities. Jonas Basanavičius, the future chairman of the Council of Lithuania when the Act was signed, worked as a physician in Bulgaria and furthered the cause of public health there. Despite the demands of his medical work abroad, he contributed continuously to Lithuanian affairs. He organized {{the publication of a}} major underground newspaper, Aušra; its first issue appeared in 1883. Basanavičius was active in Bulgaria's political life as well, representing its Democratic party. Many of the signatories had participated in the 1905 Great Seimas of Vilnius, which shaped the <b>political</b> <b>future</b> of the Lithuanian state.|$|E
40|$|Financial {{markets are}} complex systems; all the {{information}} scattered around the market is fairly and dynamically reflected in the current prices. It is difficult to understand the dynamics of markets merely by traditional analyzing methods. We propose here a new concept inspired by complex networks to study the trading behavior and the dynamics of markets. A web-based platform for prediction market which trades the <b>political</b> <b>futures</b> contracts is built to monitor the trading behavior among the human players. Two experiments are conducted on this platform in parallel for 30 days. From the accumulated transaction data, we reconstruct the so-called cash-flow networks. By examining the degree distributions of these networks, we observe that the network structure is scale-free with a power-law exponent of 1. 15, which means {{that there must be}} a non-trivial mechanism governing the network growth in our markets. Through carrying out a post-simulation modelling by a continuous double auction market with "zero-intelligence" traders, we demonstrate that such a simple model is capable of generating scale-free networks. We thus suggest that the scale-free nature of the cash-flow networks should rely on the institutional design and the structure of markets rather than on the traders' strategies.
