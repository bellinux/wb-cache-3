The advantage of this compiled approach {{is to provide a}} flexible set of boundary scan cells, including pads and test access port (TAP) controllers. The boundary scan register is automatically created when compiling the <b>pad</b> <b>ring</b> and different parameterized function complexities allow easily the dedication of the TAP controller to any application. The user-defined elements implementation is also supported, especially by means of logic synthesis, and a test vector generation tool allows one to automatically generate the serial boundary scan test vectors from the parallel test vectors defined for the manufacturing test of the circuit. The cost of boundary scan integration has shown to be reasonable in the manufactured chips...|$|E
40|$|A {{stability}} checker is a clocked storage element, {{much like}} a flip-flop, which detects unstable and late signals in the pipeline of a digital system. The On-line stability checker operates concurrently with its associated circuit-under-test (CUT). This thesis describes the full custom very-large-scale integration (VLSI) design and testing process of On-Line Stability Checkers. The goals of this thesis are to construct and test Stability Checker designs, {{and to create a}} design template for future class projects in the EE 431 Computer-Aided Design (CAD) of VLSI Devices course at Cal Poly. A method for concurrent fault testing called On-line Stability Checking was introduced by Franco and McCluskey [10] to detect reliability failures. Reliability failures initially manifest themselves as delay faults and transient glitching, which become progressively larger over time due to the wearout of conducting metal lines, eventually leading to functional faults. Stability checkers periodically detect reliability failures by monitoring CUT output signals for unstable and late input signals over a time period after the sampling clock edge. The checkers are tested by applying variable delayed input test patterns to emulate reliability failures. Consequently, configurable delay chains were incorporated into the system to provide variable delays on the input signal lines. The system also includes external test signal ports. Circuit and layout designs were implemented in the Electric VLSI Design tool [12] and simulated with LTSPICE [13]. Electric provides Design Rule Checking (DRC) and Layout-versus-Schematic (LVS) utilities for verification. Each module was designed in a bottom-up, hierarchical cell-based approach. Functional simulation, DRC and LVS checks were performed at every subsequent higher cell layer in the design hierarchy. The final chip layout was taped out for fabrication on November 29, 2010 and finished parts were received on July 7, 2011 after two manufacturing delays. Finished packaged parts were successfully verified for functionality based on SPICE simulations. The stability checkers were tested for flip-flop operation, glitch detection and late signal arrival detection. Configurable delay chains were tested to determine delay resolution and uniformity. Actual delay resolution and range measurements show a 3 to 4 times difference compared to simulated values. The Electric design template created from this project includes basic CMOS logic gates with uniform standard cell heights. The template contains a 40 -pin <b>pad</b> <b>ring</b> cell along with the individual <b>pad</b> <b>ring</b> components. EE 431 students would be able to create custom chips that are compatible for fabrication via the MOSIS MEP service. In future work, the template design library can be expanded to include more logic gate variants of various inputs and drive strengths as well as more complex functional modules...|$|E
40|$|Advances in CMOS (Complementary Metal Oxide Semiconductor) device {{technology}} have helped reduce typical die core sizes by shrinking the minimum transistor feature size. In {{the case of}} wirebonded devices with high IO counts, the final die size is increasingly determined by the size and layout of the IO cells and corresponding wirebond pads. Typical wirebond pad designs consist of a top-level metal {{that does not include}} any circuitry beneath the bonding region. Further, placement rules typically require the placement of ESD circuitry, buffers, and busses inside of the bond <b>pad</b> <b>ring</b> in order to avoid possible damage and reliability failures caused by wirebonding. On die with high pad counts, this exclusion area can represent a significant percentage of the die area that is not used for circuitry. This papers describes a layout technology called Bond Over Active (BOA), that was developed to utilize this “excluded ” region beneath wirebond pads in order to minimze die area. Two different BOA layouts are evaluated using a standard test structure. Wirebond assembly reliability and package stress reliability are determined. The transfer of forces from the top metal pad to the active silicon during wirebonding are predicted using mechanical simulations. The results of the simulations are used to explain the similar levels of reliability observed for the two BOA layouts...|$|E

40|$|To {{cope with}} the huge {{time-to-market}} pressure, every designer is looking at a “plug-andplay” solution to build complex System-on-Chips. One of the current challenges of such designs is to assemble quickly and consistently a high numbers of IPs around one or more on-chip-bus. Thanks to SPIRIT, Synopsys coreTools & ST Microelectronics design data structures, this process can be made much more efficient. SPIRIT consortium is providing a standard way of describing IP for integration purpose and this is now supported by various CAD tools. The coreAssembler tool is used to automate and speed up the Front-End design capture of a 65 nm System-on-Chip. Each IP is described using SPIRIT metadata which are built automatically from standard ST Microelectronics design data structures. The automatic protocol based connection {{capability of the tool}} is then used to perform a correct by construction assembly suitable for chip verification as well as chip implementation. The ability to extend coreAssembler by writing custom plug-in is demonstrated by showing how the IP-based design capture flow is linked with <b>pad</b> <b>ring</b> design, and how it interfaces with ST design data structures. Moreover, this paper will outline the features and usage of a complex plug-in, specifically developed to promote and consolidate IP timing constraints into one unique chip level SDC. Overall, this SPIRIT-based IP assembly methodology is showing a significant productivity increase, helping to enter quickly and earlier physical design and chip verification, and enabling quick reacts to specification changes. ...|$|E
40|$|Control {{area network}} (CAN) is a two- wired, half duplex, {{high-speed}} network system, {{that is far}} superior to conventional serial communication protocol such as RS 232, with regards to functionality and reliability and yet CAN implementations are more cost effective. CAN is a serial network technology that is widely used in real-time automobile control. It is a multi-master serial bus that uses broadcast to transmit to all CAN nodes. It is good for short message transfer. Its data transfer size is limited to 8 bytes with 1 Mbps speed. It provides {{a significant reduction in}} wiring complexity and additionally makes it easy to connect with several devices using a single bus. CAN provides an effective mechanism for clock synchronization known as “bit-stuffing”. It is very difficult to predict the precise transmission time of message which leads to an adverse impact on many time critical applications. To mitigate above problem different “bit-stuffing” techniques such as XOR masking and Software Bit Stuffing (SBS) are available in the literature. In this thesis a novel alternative method known as Eight-to-Eleven Modulation (EEM) technique is used for “bit-stuffing” and a comparison is brought with existing SBS technique and the superior features of EEM is derived. The proposed technique is validated through FPGA implementation. In this thesis, design to tape out is perform for a CAN controller. The Register Transfer Level (RTL) coding is done by Verilog HDL (Hardware Description Language). Synopsys VCS simulator is used to simulate the RTL code. Synthesized netlist is created by using Synopsys Design Vision. Cadence SoC encounter is used for automatic place and route and cadence icfb is used for final integration of the design with the <b>pad</b> <b>ring.</b> Final GDS II file is created for tape-out. UMC 180 mixed mode library is used for implementing the system with six metal layers and one poly layer. ...|$|E
40|$|Recently, {{there is}} a new trend of demand of a {{biomedical}} device that can continuously monitor patient’s vital life index such as heart rate variability (HRV) and respiration rate. This desired device would be compact, wearable, wireless, networkable and low-power to enable proactive home monitoring of vital signs. This device should have a radar sensor portion and a wireless communication link all integrated in one small set. The promising technology that can satisfy these requirements is the impulse radio based Ultra-wideband (IR-UWB) technology. Since Federal Communications Commission (FCC) released the 3. 1 GHz- 10. 6 GHz frequency band for UWB applications in 2002 [1], IR-UWB has received significant attention for applications in target positioning and wireless communications. IR-UWB employs extremely narrow Gaussian monocycle pulses or any other forms of short RF pulses to represent information. In this project, an integrated wireless UWB transceiver for the 3. 1 GHz- 10. 6 GHz IR-UWB medical sensor was developed in the 0. 18 µm CMOS technology. This UWB transceiver can be employed for both radar sensing and communication purposes. The transceiver applies the On-Off Keying (OOK) modulation scheme to transmit short Gaussian pulse signals. The transmitter output power level is adjustable. The fully integrated UWB transceiver occupies a core area of 0. 752 mm^ 2 and the total die area of 1. 274 mm^ 2 with the <b>pad</b> <b>ring</b> inserted. The transceiver was simulated with overall power consumption of 40 mW for radar sensing. The receiver is very sensitive to weak signals with a sensitivity of - 73. 01 dBm. The average power of a single pulse is 9. 8 µW. The pulses are not posing any harm to human tissues. The sensing resolution and the target positioning precision are presumably sufficient for heart movement detection purpose in medical applications. This transceiver can also be used for high speed wireless data communications. The data transmission rate of 200 Mbps was achieved with an overall power consumption of 57 mW. A combination of sensing and communications can be used to build a low power sensor...|$|E

Six MG 94 had their water-cooling mantles drilled and cut open, making these guns air-cooled and thus water-free and lighter for use as aircraft machine guns. These 6 MG 94 air-cooled guns were taken out of service in 1944.|$|R

40|$|Emerging "bandwidth hungry" {{applications}} such as high definition video distribution and ultra fast multimedia side-loading have extended the need for multi-gigabit wireless solutions {{beyond the reach of}} conventional WLAN technology or even more recently emerging UWB and MIMO systems. The availability of 7 GHz of unlicensed bandwidth in the 60 GHz spectrum, represents a unique opportunity to address such data-throughput requirements. The 60 GHz Integrated CMOS digital radio chipset comprises of PHY and MAC layers, RF transceiver, High-Speed Digital Interface and an underlying Serial Communication Fabric. To have a complete communication solution compliant with the latest ECMA- 369, ISO/DIS 13156 and IEEE 802. 15. 3 c standards, we build a million gate digital implementation of MAC and PHY. The Serial Peripheral Interface (SPI) serves as the bridge between the higher layers in the communication stack (PAL-MAC) and the lower layers like PHY-RF Front End. The MAC module can setup the communication link on the fly by tuning parameters such as operating channel, channel bonding and bandwidth, data rates, error correction mechanisms, handshaking mechanisms, etc, by using the SPI to communicate with internal components. The SPI interface plays a crucial rule in not only this, but also during the testing and debug phase. Operation of each of the RF modules is monitored through the serial interface using local SPI slaves which are hooked up to the 4 -wire serial bus running all through the chip. The SPI host controller emulates an embedded protocol analyzer. For calibration and fine tuning purposes, digital settings can also be loaded onto these modules through the SPI interface. R- 2 R DACs are used to convert these commands into analog voltages which then provide a tunable bias to the RF and mixed-signal modules. Other key functions of this serial communication and control interface are: Initialization of all of the RF and mixed signal modules, DC calibration of data converter, PLL and other mixed-signal modules, data acquisition, parametric tuning for digital modules such as linear equalizer, Gain Control loops (AGC, VGA), etc. Ultra high speed digital Input-Output buffers are used to provide an external data interface to the radio chipset. These high speed I/Os are also used in the gbps (gigabit-per-second) link for data transfer between the RF transceiver chip and the PHY-MAC baseband chip. The IOs are expected to comply with different signaling standards such as LVDS, SLVS 200, SLVS 400, etc. A robust system involves a meticulous <b>pad</b> <b>ring</b> design with proper power domains and power cuts. Full-chip integration of the digital PHY, MAC, peripheral logic and IO ring is done in a semi-custom fashion. M. S.

40|$|The Problem: The {{extent of}} {{previous}} work on processor in memory systems using merged DRAM-logic process technology [1, 2, 3, 4] {{indicates that the}} technology has great promise. Most of the results to date, however, have been architectural studies with simulation results or proposed architectures. Relatively few designs make it to final silicon due to the prohibitively high Non-Recurring Engineering (NRE) costs of this new process technology. Of the designs that do make it to silicon, many have found that a merged DRAM-logic process is fickle: subtle noise or leakage problems {{can lead to a}} non-working DRAM array. This difficulty in realizing PIM architectures in silicon has left the research community with a lack of real platforms for compiler and application development, and thus there is much uncertainty about our ability to efficiently utilize these typically fine-grained parallel processor systems. Motivation: Advances in FPGA technology have helped close the gap between RTL- and HDL- based simulation and final silicon performance levels. The density of FPGAs has also become sufficient to implement a reasonably-sized microarchitecture on a single device. However, FPGAs alone are not sufficient to simulate a PIM system despite the availability of small banks of high-bandwidth memory macros integrated into the FPGA arrays. These banks of memory are simply too small and sparsely populated to do the job.

The controller chip set design allows for pipelining of successive MAP 2 ̆ 7 s as well as operation on 1024 x 1024 pixel, 8 -bit gray scale images. To facilitate the design, additional scaleable CMOS standard library cells and corresponding parameterized schematic library components were designed and integrated with the RIT CMOS standard cell library designed by Computer Engineering graduate student Larry Rubin as part of his Masters thesis 1. In particular, additional D flip-flops with both Q and Q bar outputs, and-orinverts, or-and-inverts, CMUXes, and MOSIS 64 and 84 pin <b>pad</b> <b>rings</b> were created. The cells were designed to be fabricated using the Metal Oxide Semiconductor Implementation System (MOSIS) scaleable CMOS 2. 0 pm Nwell (SCN) process. A complete set of Cadence design rule verification tools were also integrated with the existing CAE tool set to perform design rule checking (DRC), electrical rule checking (ERC), layout versus schematic checking (LVS), and layout parameter extraction (LPE) for the MOSIS SCN 2. 0 pm N-well dense rule set. To verify the CMOS standard cell designs, test chips were designed and sent to MOSIS for fabrication. The layout and design rule verification of the final two test chips, test chips five and six, was performed by the author. Test chip four contains a variety of MUXes and D flip-flops, test chip five contains a variety of transfer gates and inverters.
