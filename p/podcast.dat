40|$|Despite {{potential}} benefits of <b>podcasts</b> for college education, little research has examined students’ psychological drives for using <b>podcasts.</b> To explore {{the relationship between the}} use of <b>podcasts</b> and college students’ appreciation of them, this study investigated students’ motivations, attitudes and behaviors with regard to <b>podcasts</b> use including their learning environment. Based on a survey with 636 college students, this study found that six dimensions of motivations were prominent for <b>podcasts</b> use: (1) voyeurism/social interaction/companionship, (2) entertainment/relaxation/arousal, (3) education/information, (4) pastime/escape, (5) habit, and (6) convenience. In particular, motivations catering to relationship consolidation, excitement and educational achievement better explained the actual use of <b>podcasts</b> as well as students’ appreciation than other motivations identified. In addition, students’ attachment to the medium is a strong predictor of their <b>podcasts</b> use and gratification. Students also used <b>podcasts</b> to satisfy their fashion motivation. Theoretical and practical implications of using <b>podcasts</b> for digital literacy in college education were discussed...|$|R

40|$|Currently {{little is}} known about how {{students}} use <b>podcasts</b> of exercise material (as opposed to lecture material), and whether they perceive such <b>podcasts</b> to be beneficial. This study aimed to assess how exercise <b>podcasts</b> for phonetics are used and perceived by second year speech and language therapy students. Eleven <b>podcasts</b> of graded phonetics exercises were produced and made available to the 36 students in the cohort, who then took part in two voluntary surveys. Surveys were completed by 26 and 30 students respectively. Responses show that students tend to listen to the <b>podcasts</b> on a computer at home, rather than on an mp 3 player when on the move. Many students also listen to the <b>podcasts</b> with family and friends. Students report that they found the exercise <b>podcasts</b> very useful for their learning. They liked the ability to repeat the recordings many times and felt that there was improvement in their confidence in transcription and in their test scores due to using them. For this subject they would prefer exercise <b>podcasts</b> to recordings of lectures...|$|R

The results show that <b>podcasts</b> are regarded as valuable sources of scientific information by listeners and that blogs and forums can act as public spaces for audience members to share knowledge, develop their own ideas about science and provide feedback to media producers.
