5|$|Some writers {{that emerged}} after the Second World War {{followed}} MacDiarmid by writing in Scots, including Robert Garioch and Sydney Goodsir Smith. Others demonstrated a {{greater interest in}} English language poetry, among them Norman MacCaig, George Bruce and Maurice Lindsay. George Mackay Brown from Orkney, and Iain Crichton Smith from Lewis, wrote both poetry and prose fiction shaped by their distinctive island backgrounds. The Glaswegian poet Edwin Morgan became known for translations of works {{from a wide range}} of European languages. He was also the first Scots Makar (the official national poet), appointed by the inaugural Scottish government in 2004. Many major Scottish post-war novelists, such as Muriel Spark, James Kennaway, Alexander Trocchi, Jessie Kesson and Robin Jenkins spent much or most of their lives outside Scotland, but often dealt with Scottish themes, as in Spark's Edinburgh-set The <b>Prime</b> <b>of</b> Miss Jean Brodie (1961) and Kennaway's script for the film Tunes of Glory (1956). Successful mass-market works included the action novels of Alistair MacLean, and the historical fiction of Dorothy Dunnett. A younger generation of novelists that emerged in the 1960s and 1970s included Shena Mackay, Alan Spence, Allan Massie and the work of William McIlvanney.|$|E

40|$|The prior {{presentation}} of a word enhances {{the probability that the}} word will be identified from a degraded cue. This enhancement, or priming, may occur without recollection of the prior presentation. In investigations of the effect of delay on nonrecollective memory, <b>priming</b> <b>of</b> word completion may occur at long delays after the initial word presentation (e. g., HORIZON) when the degraded cue contains scattered letters (e. g., R Z) but not when the degraded cue contains the initial letters (e. g., HOR). These particular cues are known as fragments and stems respectively. <b>Priming</b> <b>of</b> fragment completion may occur weeks after the study presentation whereas <b>priming</b> <b>of</b> stem completion may disappear within hours. The present research investigated this apparent discrepancy between the duration <b>of</b> <b>priming</b> effect for the two types of cues by examining completion of both within the same experiment. Particularly, it tested the hypothesis that the decline in <b>priming</b> <b>of</b> completion is greater when cues have many possible completions. Subjects completed fragments that have 1 completion or fragments and stems that have more than 7 completions. Priming was measured over a 48 -hour delay interval in each <b>of</b> 4 experiments. <b>Priming</b> <b>of</b> stem completion declined at a greater rate than <b>priming</b> <b>of</b> fragment completion over the 48 -hour interval, thus replicating within a single experiment the previous between-experiment findings. The number-of-completions hypothesis was not rejected in Experiments 1 and 3 because the decline in <b>priming</b> <b>of</b> multiple fragment completion did not differ from the decline in <b>priming</b> <b>of</b> stem or unique fragment completion. However, in Experiment 2 the decline in <b>priming</b> <b>of</b> multiple fragment completion differed from the decline in <b>priming</b> <b>of</b> stem completion but not from the decline in <b>priming</b> <b>of</b> unique fragment completion. Thus, the number-of-completions hypothesis may not be a viable explanation of the differential effect <b>of</b> delay on <b>priming</b> <b>of</b> fragment and stem completion. When the same words served in both the unique fragment and stem conditions, the effect <b>of</b> delay on <b>priming</b> <b>of</b> completion was similar for both conditions (Experiment 4) ...|$|R

40|$|Three {{experiments}} {{explored the}} extent to which word fragment completion and word stem completion could be "primed," or facilitated, by prior study of the words.

25|$|The poem is {{seventeen}} lines long.

This climaxes in line 16, which is the longest in the poem at 17 syllables, and is immediately followed by the shortest line in the poem, at 7 syllables.
