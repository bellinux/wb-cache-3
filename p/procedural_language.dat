2500|$|Citizens {{belonging}} to the officially recognized minorities enjoy the right to [...] "use their language in communication with authorities and in courts of law". Article 25 of the Czech Charter of Fundamental Rights and Basic Freedoms provides {{the right of the}} national and ethnic minorities to education and communication with authorities in their own language. Act No. 500/2004 Coll. (The Administrative Rule) in its paragraph 16 (4) (<b>Procedural</b> <b>Language)</b> provides that a citizen of the Czech Republic who belongs to a national or an ethnic minority, which traditionally and on a long-term basis lives within the territory of the Czech Republic, has the right to address an administrative agency and proceed before it {{in the language of the}} minority. In the case that the administrative agency does not have an employee with knowledge of the language, the agency is bound to obtain a translator at the agency's own expense. According to Act No. 273/2001 (About The Rights of Members of Minorities) paragraph 9 (The right to use language of a national minority in dealing with authorities and in the courts of law) the same also applies to members of national minorities in the courts of law.|$|E

40|$|The Object-Z {{notation}} {{is a good}} meta-language {{that can}} be used to specify denotational semantics of programming languages. It has been effectively applied to some categories of languages. These include the <b>procedural</b> <b>languages,</b> the object-oriented <b>procedural</b> <b>languages</b> [9] and specification languages [8]. To widen these catergories, this paper applies Object-Z to the specification of the semantics of a small typed functional language...|$|R

50|$|Verilog and Verilog/AMS are not <b>procedural</b> {{programming}} <b>languages,</b> but event-based hardware description languages (HDLs). As such, {{they provide}} sophisticated and powerful language features for definition and synchronization of parallel actions and events. On the other hand, many actions defined in HDL program statements can {{run in parallel}} (somewhat similar to threads and tasklets in <b>procedural</b> <b>languages,</b> but much more fine-grained). However, Verilog/AMS can be coupled with <b>procedural</b> <b>languages</b> like the ANSI C language using the Verilog Procedural Interface of the simulator, which eases testsuite implementation, and allows interaction with legacy code or testbench equipment.|$|R
