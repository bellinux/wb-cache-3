Dynamic pricing, {{which is a}} method to control demand by pricing electricity at hourly (or more often) intervals, has been studied by many researchers.

We provide a dynamic <b>pricing</b> model <b>that</b> takes into account such cost functions within the settings of unit commitment problems (UCPs). Our model gives convex hull price (CHP), {{which has not been}} used in the context of dynamic pricing, though it is known that the CHP minimizes the uplift payment which is disadvantageous to suppliers for a given demand. In addition, we apply an iterative algorithm based on the subgradient method to solve our model. Numerical experiments show the efficiency of our model on reducing uplift payments.

40|$|In {{competitive}} electricity markets, {{the costs}} for each ancillary service should be charged {{to those who}} cause the costs to be incurred with charges based on the {{factors that contribute to}} these costs.

40|$|Water in {{the western}} United States can be bought and sold, but the {{transactions}} will always be complicated. Transfers of water will always be expensive and time consuming because of the hydrologic and institutional interconnections inherent to water. Our data show {{that most of the}} water rights in the West are messy. Therefore, markets cannot be quick fixes, and using markets for future water allocation, even if it is economically efficient, will take time and resources to set up. Untangling serial uses and negotiating multiple ownership claims are hurdles, not barriers, and they can be overcome in time but will require both time and money. Buying existing water rights may be less costly than building infrastructure to transport available water from long distances or desalinating seawater, but the transactions will come at a price. Municipalities may purchase water from farmers and thus bear the transaction costs directly, or the private sector may purchase agricultural water (e. g., Two Rivers Water and Farming, Colorado (Landry 2012)), bear the associated risk and transaction costs, and sell it on to municipalities. In either case, the end users will inevitably pay higher prices for water. Markets can and will be part of western U. S. water allocation, but they do not provide quick solutions.

40|$|Suppliers in {{competitive}} electricity markets regularly respond to <b>prices</b> <b>that</b> change hour by hour {{or even more}} frequently, but most consumers respond to price changes on a very different time scale, i. e. they observe and respond to changes in price as reflected on their monthly bills.

It develops a computable equilibrium model to estimate the time-of-use (TOU) <b>prices</b> <b>that</b> can be used in retail electricity markets. An optimization model for the supply side of the electricity market, combined with a price-responsive geometric distributed lagged demand function, computes the TOU <b>prices</b> <b>that</b> satisfy the equilibrium conditions.

40|$|When {{prices are}} set properly, {{they serve as}} {{important}} signals to guide customers to consume the efficient quantity of a good. However, in electricity markets many consumers do not pay <b>prices</b> <b>that</b> <b>reflect</b> the scarcity of power. The true social cost of power varies throughout a typical day; power is usually low cost during off-peak periods in the night but it is high cost during a hot July afternoon. Economists have argued for several decades that consumers should pay a <b>price</b> <b>that</b> varies with the true social cost of power. However, {{the vast majority of}} consumers pay a fixed price whether they use power at midnight or noon. This can create a host of economic inefficiencies. Fortunately, this is beginning to change. In many states, including Texas, large commercial and industrial users of electricity pay <b>prices</b> <b>that</b> <b>reflect</b> the social <b>cost</b> of power at the time of consumption. This pricing mechanism is called ?real-time pricing? (RTP) in electricity markets. I have access to a unique, new dataset of virtually all 8000 commercial and industrial users in Texas that includes information on both whether they pay real-time prices and their hourly consumption for one year. First, I econometrically iv estimate the types of commercial and industrial firms that are likely to ?sign up? for time-varying prices. Second, I test whether the customers on real-time prices reduce demand substantially in response to higher <b>prices.</b> I find <b>that</b> customers with greater total hourly consumption {{are more likely to be}} on real-time pricing. Customers with more ?peaky? load profiles are less likely to be on real-time pricing. Customers in south and west Texas have a greater probability of being on RTP than customers in Houston.

40|$|This project {{extends the}} idea that policy makers should address {{problems}} by improving economic incentives. This project adds that presenting incentives in a way <b>that</b> <b>reflects</b> how people make decisions can sometimes improve consumers’ responses to the incentives and policy outcomes. This paper uses behavioral economics to propose ways to increase electricity policy effectiveness. The cost of generating power fluctuates enormously from hour to hour but most customers pay time-invariant prices for power. The mismatch between the fluctuating cost and the fixed price wastes billions of dollars. Critical Peak Pricing (CPP) reduces this waste by setting offpeak, peak, and “critical” <b>prices</b> <b>that</b> better <b>reflect</b> the <b>cost</b> of power during time periods. Customers in CPP pilot programs used less power during high-priced periods than did customers on traditional, time-invariant rates. CPP customers reported high satisfaction levels and often saved 10 % or more. Yet, roughly 99 % of customers reject opportunities to switch to CPP. The psychology literature documents a set of decision making heuristics that people use to choose among options with uncertain payoffs. This paper describes the evidence that {{one or more of}} these heuristics explains customer reluctance to opt-in to CPP. It then suggests Incentive Preserving Rebates that change the presentation of CPP to address these heuristics. Incentive Preserving Rebates reframe scarcity “events” as opportunities to get rebates rather than as periods of extremely high prices. Incentive Preserving Rebates change the presentation, but change neither marginal incentives nor each customer’s total annual payments. The paper then explores the implications of Incentive Preserving Rebates for customers who participated in a California pilot program...|$|R
40|$|Today {{a growing}} number of goods and {{services}} are provided in the marketplace free of charge; indeed, free or the appearance of free, have become part of our ecosystem. More often than not, free goods and services provide real benefits to consumers and are clearly pro-competitive. Yet free goods may also create significant costs. We show that {{despite the fact that the}} consumer does not pay a direct price, there are indirect <b>prices</b> <b>that</b> <b>reflect</b> the opportunity <b>cost</b> associated with the consumption of free goods. These indirect costs can be overt or covert, in the same market in which the product is distributed or in related markets, monetary or non-monetary, and short-term or long-term. Most of the economic literature on free goods has focused on two-sided markets in which the free good is provided in exchange for attention or information. We analyze the welfare effects of additional cases that are becoming commonplace in our economy. Our analysis indicates that even goods that are offered for philanthropic motivations might sometimes harm competition and welfare. The article also stresses the need to evaluate the pricing strategies of firms that offer free goods in light of new research pointing to the 2 ̆ 2 irrational 2 ̆ 2 behavioral response of consumers when faced by a free option. This welfare analysis serves as a basis for the exploration of the antitrust implications of the provision of free goods, which has been relatively neglected. Indeed, as this paper shows, free goods raise significant issues for antitrust enforcement, which run the gamut from market definition to market power and to the evaluation of the competitive effects of mergers and more generally to strategic business behavior. We use examples from diverse jurisdictions and markets to exemplify our arguments and, in particular, focus on three case studies: free search services, free internet browsers and free newspapers...|$|R
40|$|This report {{recommends}} a {{change to the}} way consumers pay for the network that carries electricity from generators to homes, so <b>that</b> it better <b>reflects</b> the <b>cost</b> of running the network. Overview Australians are paying too much for power. In the five years to 2013, the average household power bill rose 70 per cent: from $ 970 to $ 1660 a year. The prices we pay are also unfair: some people are paying more than their fair share. These consumers are paying on average about $ 150 a year more than they should to subsidise other consumers. To get fairer and cheaper prices, network tariffs need urgent reform. Electricity networks transport power from generators to our homes and businesses. Like roads and freeways, they are built at a size to keep electricity moving at times of maximum demand – peak hour. Yet the price we pay to use electricity networks is the same whatever {{the time of day}} or season. The price therefore provides no incentive to use the network efficiently by avoiding peak times. It also provides little incentive for network owners to invest efficiently because it is unrelated to their main cost: building enough infrastructure to meet peak demand and avoid blackouts. Network owners spent $ 17. 6 billion on expanding power networks between 2009 and 2013. If prices had encouraged consumers to use less power in periods of peak demand, $ 7. 8 billion of this investment could have been avoided and the savings passed on as lower power bills. It is widely agreed that reform is needed. Yet {{there is a lack of}} specific proposals to improve the structure and operation of network tariffs. This report, the third in a series of Grattan reports on the excessive cost of electricity, fills that gap. It proposes two major reforms to the way network companies charge customers for the cost of carrying power to homes and small businesses. First, the 43 per cent of the consumer bill that goes to fund the network should no longer be based on total energy use. Instead, consumers should pay for the maximum load they put on the network. This tariff is called a capacity-based charge because it is based on the capacity of the infrastructure that must be built to carry this maximum load. A capacity charge far better <b>reflects</b> the <b>cost</b> of building and running the network. Yet this reform alone may not reduce peak demand in areas where the network is under pressure. Therefore the report also proposes the introduction of a new tariff in areas that - in the absence of <b>prices</b> <b>that</b> better <b>reflect</b> the <b>cost</b> of running the network - will require expensive infrastructure upgrades. Under this tariff, consumers will be charged more for use during times (usually in summer) when the network is under most strain. Because these periods drive total investment in infrastructure, reducing peak demand levels ultimately leads to lower prices. These reforms will give all consumers incentives to use electricity more efficiently. When they do, the pressure on network companies to invest in infrastructure will fall, and power prices with it. But governments must commit to these reforms and carefully explain their benefits. Advanced electricity meters will need to be installed on most Australian homes, at material shortterm cost. Politicians may decide it is too hard. But if they do, they will miss an opportunity to deliver cheaper and fairer power prices.  ...|$|R
