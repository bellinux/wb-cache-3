5|$|Nevertheless, Antillean {{music can}} be {{characterized}} by the <b>prominence</b> <b>of</b> the Carnival celebration (prominently from Trinidad and Tobago), {{and the importance of}} calypso-like song traditions. The Lesser Antilles is also home to a strong Indo-Caribbean population; though Indo-Caribbean music is found elsewhere in the Caribbean, the <b>prominence</b> <b>of</b> Indian-influenced styles is a hallmark of the Antillean music scenes. Regional forms can also be found outside of the Caribbean entirely, most notably in New York City, where Brooklyn's Labor Day Carnival features music and parades, mas and steel bands; this Carnival is distinct to New York, and reflects elements of a pan-Caribbean nature.|$|E

5|$|Commentary on {{the album}} has {{included}} discussion of its minimal instrumentation and the interjection of unexpected sounds. Reviewers have described the lyrics on the songs as unconventional and dark, and noted the <b>prominence</b> <b>of</b> vocal harmonies between the Deal sisters.

40|$|In {{order to}} gain {{knowledge}} about the interaction between top-down expectations of listeners concerning prosodic prominence and its acoustic correlates, two exploratory empirical studies were carried out. First, native and non-native subjects rated <b>prominences</b> <b>of</b> speech read at normal and very fast —prosodically very different — speech. Later, these ratings were compared with introspective <b>prominence</b> ratings <b>of</b> different listeners. First results indicate a major influence of the introspection on prominence ratings, especially if acoustic cues are difficult to interpret, {{as it is the}} case in very fast speech. Compared to native subjects, non-natives rely less on their introspection and more on the acoustics...|$|R

5|$|French Creole {{music is}} most famously {{associated}} with Martinique and Guadeloupe, though {{the islands of}} Saint Lucia and Dominica are also home to French Antillean music.

5|$|Ottawa distinguishes {{two types}} of {{grammatical}} third person in sentences, marked on both verbs and animate nouns. The proximate form indicates a more salient noun phrase, and obviative indicates a less prominent noun phrase. Selection and use of proximate or obviative forms is a distinctive aspect of Ottawa syntax that indicates the relative discourse <b>prominence</b> <b>of</b> noun phrases containing third persons; {{it does not have}} a direct analogue in English grammar.|$|E
5|$|Sydenham Hill {{is one of}} {{the highest}} {{locations}} in London; 109metres (357ft) above sea level (spot height on Ordnance Survey Map); {{and the size of the}} Palace and <b>prominence</b> <b>of</b> the site made it easy to identify from much of London. This led to the residential area around the building becoming known as Crystal Palace instead of Sydenham Hill. The Palace was destroyed by fire on 30 November 1936 and the site of the building and its grounds is now known as Crystal Palace Park.|$|E
5|$|The Silver Age {{marked a}} decline in the <b>prominence</b> <b>of</b> American comics in genres such as horror, romance, teen and furry animal humor, or westerns, which were more popular than superhero adventures in the late 1940s through the mid-1950s, and fans of these genres see the Silver Age as a decline from that earlier era.|$|E
25|$|The {{most obvious}} {{feature of the}} area is Upper and Lower Aughanduff {{mountains}} (rising to 234 and 227 meters respectively), although they are perhaps more correctly classed as two <b>prominences</b> <b>of</b> the same rock outcrop. As a result, the townland boasts scenic views of multi-peaked Slievenacappel ("mountain of the horse"), Slieve Gullion, Mullaghbawn, and Dromintee, as well as counties Louth and Monaghan {{to the south and}} west.|$|R
50|$|The terrain {{consists}} {{mainly of}} {{a jumble of}} the low, flattened ridges typical of mature sandy basins. The scattered <b>prominences</b> <b>of</b> 100 feet (30 m) or more, some quite steep, owe their existence to caps of iron-rich sand. A cuesta forms escarpments beyond {{the headwaters of the}} Creek and along some of its southerly tributaries. There is a small, marshy floodplain in the lower reaches.|$|R

5|$|For a long time, {{bivalves}} {{were thought}} to be better adapted to aquatic life than brachiopods were, outcompeting and relegating them to minor niches in later ages. These two taxa appeared in textbooks as an example of replacement by competition. Evidence given for this included the fact that bivalves needed less food to subsist because of their energetically efficient ligament-muscle system for opening and closing valves. All this has been broadly disproven, though; rather, the <b>prominence</b> <b>of</b> modern bivalves over brachiopods seems due to chance disparities in their response to extinction events.|$|E
5|$|In Brazil, the Bororo people {{incorporate}} {{the stars of}} Auriga into a massive constellation representing a caiman; its southern stars represent {{the end of the}} animal's tail. The eastern portion of Taurus is the rest of the tail, while Orion is its body and Lepus is the head. This constellation arose because of the <b>prominence</b> <b>of</b> caymans in daily Amazonian life. There is evidence that Capella was significant to the Aztec people, as the Late Classic site Monte Albán has a marker for the star's heliacal rising. Indigenous peoples of California and Nevada also noticed the bright pattern of Auriga's stars. To them, the constellation's bright stars formed a curve that was represented in crescent-shaped petroglyphs. The indigenous Pawnee of North America recognized a constellation with the same major stars as modern Auriga: Alpha, Beta, Gamma (Beta Tauri), Theta, and Iota Aurigae.|$|E

5|$|In most cases, thyroid cancer {{presents}} as a painless {{mass in the}} neck. It is {{very unusual}} for thyroid cancers to present with other symptoms, although in some cases cancer may cause hyperthyroidism. Most malignant thyroid cancers are papillary, followed by follicular, medullary, and thyroid lymphoma. Because of the <b>prominence</b> <b>of</b> the thyroid gland, cancer is often detected earlier {{in the course of}} disease as the cause of a nodule, which may undergo fine needle aspiration. Thyroid function tests will help reveal whether the nodule produces excess thyroid hormones. A radioactive iodine uptake test can help reveal the activity and location of the cancer and metastases.|$|E
5|$|In the {{tradition}} of sixteenth-century royal festivals, Catherine de' Medici's magnificences took place over several days, with a different entertainment each day. Often individual nobles or {{members of the royal}} family were responsible for preparing one particular entertainment. Spectators and participants, including those involved in martial sports, would dress up in costumes representing mythological or romantic themes. Catherine gradually introduced changes to {{the tradition}}al form of these entertainments. She forbade heavy tilting of the sort that led to the death of her husband in 1559; and she developed and increased the <b>prominence</b> <b>of</b> dance in the shows that climaxed each series of entertainments. As a result, the ballets de cour, a distinctive new art form, emerged from the creative advances in court entertainment devised by Catherine de' Medici.|$|E
5|$|Money is {{important}} throughout the film. Concerns about money dominate {{much of the}} film—for example, a large portion is devoted to Wei and her students' attempt to earn enough money for bus tickets—as well as motivating them. Most major characters, including Wei, demand payment for their actions, and it is left unclear whether Wei's search for Zhang Huike is motivated by altruism or {{by the promise of}} a 10-yuan bonus. Zhu Ying points out the <b>prominence</b> <b>of</b> money in the film creates a conflict between traditional Confucian values (such as the implication that the solutions to Wei's problems can be found through the help of authority figures) and modern, capitalist and individualistic society.|$|E

It is characterized by early pathologic contact between primary osseous <b>prominences</b> <b>of</b> the acetabular rim (so-called pincer FAI) and/or the femoral head-neck junction (cam FAI).

In the course of acquisition, children use several strategies to mark stress prominence before the adult algorithm of primary stress is used productively.

In other words, children use the stress information available in higher prosodic domains as a cue for the acquisition of the algorithm of primary stress...|$|R
