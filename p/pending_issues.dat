500|$|The United Kingdom and Argentina both {{claim the}} Falkland Islands. The UK's {{position}} is that the Falklanders have not indicated a desire for change, {{and that there are}} no <b>pending</b> <b>issues</b> to resolve concerning the islands. The UK bases its position on its continuous administration of the islands since 1833 (except for 1982) and the islanders' [...] "right to self-determination as set out in the UN Charter". Argentine policy maintains that Falkland Islanders do not have a right to self-determination, claiming that in 1833 the UK expelled Argentine authorities (and settlers) from the Falklands with a threat of [...] "greater force" [...] and, afterwards, barred Argentines from resettling the islands. Argentina posits that it acquired the Falklands from Spain when it achieved independence in 1816, and that the UK illegally occupied them in 1833.|$|E
500|$|Editor Louise Innes, who {{was working}} on her first X-Files episode, said the {{post-production}} editing process was [...] "not {{as easy as it}} sounds." [...] Innes was tasked with connecting roughly forty shots and creating the illusion of one, uniform scene. After the reels of film were combined, several <b>pending</b> <b>issues</b> had to be tweaked in post-production. For instance, during the scene in which Scully runs into an elevator, two shots were spliced together; however, the color did not completely match. The images and their colors were later corrected by the series' [...] "postproduction [...] troubleshooters" [...] using digital manipulation. When the episode was filmed, it was shot in 2.35:1 widescreen. When the episode aired, it was shown letterboxed to fit in a 1.33:1 television screen; this was the first X-Files episode to receive this treatment. Carter reasoned that this method would allow for more action to be viewable in each frame.|$|E

However, Paraguay {{said it would not}} return to the Mercosur fold as long as Venezuela held its rotating presidency. Venezuela holds Mercosur's rotating presidency until July 2014. Paraguay has objected to Venezuela's inclusion in the trading bloc, and says that a new member can only be included after a unanimous vote and argues that such a vote should not have been held while Paraguay was suspended. Foreign Minister Eladio Loizaga said he would rather deal with Paraguay's neighbours individually at first.

40|$|AbstractThis work {{presents}} a methodological framework for facilitating knowledge transfer between process engineering to biosensing, employing case based reasoning to match successfully solved problems in industrial catalysts with biosensor drawbacks, {{adapted to the}} latter through their common scientific background, where ‚Äòcompatibility‚Äô and ‚Äòcomparability‚Äô are more prominent. The proposed framework has been implemented in mediator-based electrochemical biosensors, where the inability to recycle the cofactors in situ without compromising the functionality of the whole system remains a <b>pending</b> <b>issue.</b> The opening of technology channels between the two domains may, also, contribute to solving the problem of enzyme stability in industrial catalysis...|$|R
