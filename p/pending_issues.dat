500|$|The United Kingdom and Argentina both {{claim the}} Falkland Islands. The UK's {{position}} is that the Falklanders have not indicated a desire for change, {{and that there are}} no <b>pending</b> <b>issues</b> to resolve concerning the islands. The UK bases its position on its continuous administration of the islands since 1833 (except for 1982) and the islanders' [...] "right to self-determination as set out in the UN Charter". Argentine policy maintains that Falkland Islanders do not have a right to self-determination, claiming that in 1833 the UK expelled Argentine authorities (and settlers) from the Falklands with a threat of [...] "greater force" [...] and, afterwards, barred Argentines from resettling the islands. Argentina posits that it acquired the Falklands from Spain when it achieved independence in 1816, and that the UK illegally occupied them in 1833.|$|E
500|$|Editor Louise Innes, who {{was working}} on her first X-Files episode, said the {{post-production}} editing process was [...] "not {{as easy as it}} sounds." [...] Innes was tasked with connecting roughly forty shots and creating the illusion of one, uniform scene. After the reels of film were combined, several <b>pending</b> <b>issues</b> had to be tweaked in post-production. For instance, during the scene in which Scully runs into an elevator, two shots were spliced together; however, the color did not completely match. The images and their colors were later corrected by the series' [...] "postproduction [...] troubleshooters" [...] using digital manipulation. When the episode was filmed, it was shot in 2.35:1 widescreen. When the episode aired, it was shown letterboxed to fit in a 1.33:1 television screen; this was the first X-Files episode to receive this treatment. Carter reasoned that this method would allow for more action to be viewable in each frame.|$|E

Paraguay has objected to Venezuela's inclusion in the trading bloc, and says that a new member can only be included after a unanimous vote and argues that such a vote should not have been held while Paraguay was suspended. Foreign Minister Eladio Loizaga said he would rather deal with Paraguay's neighbours individually at first.

40|$|AbstractThis work {{presents}} a methodological framework for facilitating knowledge transfer between process engineering to biosensing, employing case based reasoning to match successfully solved problems in industrial catalysts with biosensor drawbacks, {{adapted to the}} latter through their common scientific background, where ‘compatibility’ and ‘comparability’ are more prominent. The proposed framework has been implemented in mediator-based electrochemical biosensors, where the inability to recycle the cofactors in situ without compromising the functionality of the whole system remains a <b>pending</b> <b>issue.</b> The opening of technology channels between the two domains may, also, contribute to solving the problem of enzyme stability in industrial catalysis...|$|R
