Reactions are thereafter carried out using Schlenk techniques. The gloveboxes are thus only used for the most air-sensitive stages in an experiment. In their more liberal use, gloveboxes are used for the entire synthetic operations including reactions in solvents, work-up, and <b>preparation</b> <b>of</b> <b>samples</b> for spectroscopy.|$|E

50|$|The {{business}} of CROs is usually done through a “pay for service” arrangement. Contrary to manufacturing companies, invoicing of CROs {{is not based}} on unit product price, but on full-time equivalents (FTEs), that is, the cost of a scientist working one year on a given customer assignment. Companies offering both contract research and manufacturing services (CRAMS) combine the activities of CROs and CMOs. Their history is either a forward integration of a CRO, which adds industrial scale capabilities or backwards integration of a CMO. As there are only limited synergies (e.g. > 90% of the projects end at the sample preparation stage). It is questionable, though, whether one-stop shops really fulfil a need. Actually, the large fine chemical companies consider the <b>preparation</b> <b>of</b> <b>samples</b> more as marketing tool (and expense …) rather than a profit contributor.|$|E
5000|$|A {{microtome}} (from the Greek mikros, meaning [...] "small", and temnein, meaning [...] "to cut") {{is a tool}} used to cut extremely {{thin slices}} of material, known as sections. Important in science, microtomes are used in microscopy, allowing for the <b>preparation</b> <b>of</b> <b>samples</b> for observation under transmitted light or electron radiation. Microtomes use steel, glass, or diamond blades depending upon the specimen being sliced and the desired thickness of the sections being cut. Steel blades are used to prepare sections of animal or plant tissues for light microscopy histology. Glass knives are used to slice sections for light microscopy and to slice very thin sections for electron microscopy. Industrial grade diamond knives are used to slice hard materials such as bone, teeth and plant matter for both light microscopy and for electron microscopy. Gem quality diamond knives are used for slicing thin sections for electron microscopy.|$|E
50|$|NMR {{spectroscopy}} {{has been}} utilized {{for the analysis}} of biological samples since the 1980s, and can be used as an effective technique for the identification and quantification of both known and unknown metabolites. For details on the principles of this technique, see NMR spectroscopy. In pharmacometabolomics analyses, NMR is advantageous because minimal sample preparation is required. Isolated patient samples typically include blood or urine due to their minimally-invasive acquisition, however, other fluid types and solid tissue samples have also been studied with this approach. Due to the minimal <b>preparation</b> <b>of</b> <b>samples</b> before analysis, samples can be completely recovered following NMR analysis. This permits samples to be repeatedly processed with extremely high levels of reproducibility, as well as maintaining precious patient samples for alternative analysis. The high reproducibility and precision of NMR, coupled with relatively fast processing time (greater than 100 samples per day), makes this process a relatively high-throughput form of sample analysis. One disadvantage of this technique is the relatively poor metabolite detection sensitivity compared to MS-based analysis, leading to a requirement for greater initial sample volume. Furthermore, the initial instrument costs are extremely high, for both NMR and MS equipment.|$|E

30|$|The {{standard}} deviation <b>of</b> <b>sample</b> ‘c’ in size distribution of particles {{is more than}} the other three samples.

The larger core grows faster because of the low concentration of the Pt atoms. In consequence, Pt nanoparticles have different sizes and their statistical distribution is wide (Figure  4 c).|$|R

40|$|Ion beam {{analysis}} plays a {{major role}} in the analysis of semiconductor structures. It can provide fast and routine measurements for many problems, especially related to elemental profiling. The major ion beam based methods RBS, SIMS, and SNMS, when applied in a supplementary manner, allow quantitative and sensitive elemental profiling. Special <b>preparation</b> <b>of</b> <b>samples,</b> like membranes for backside analysis, and the correction of the measured signal with respect to physical effects induced by the probing beam can improve the capabilities of these techniques. But from a practical point of view, ion beam analysis is only one approach, thus for many problems, alternative techniques like electron microscopy or X-ray analysis can provide better and faster access to the desired information. One example discussed in this paper was the analysis of surface contamination by TXRF. The synergy of approaching analytical problems by several methods is obvious. The use of focused ion beams for <b>preparation</b> <b>of</b> <b>samples</b> and subsequent analysis with different methods reflects this situation...|$|E
