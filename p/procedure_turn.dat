25|$|The {{aircraft}} departed McGhee Tyson Airport {{outside of}} Knoxville 27 minutes late {{on what was}} the second leg of the flight with seven passengers and three crew. The DC-3A was cleared for an approach to runway 27 at Tri-Cities Regional Airport. The visibility at the airport was 3 miles (4.8km) in light snow and fog with a 900-foot (274 m) broken ceiling and overcast at 1,700 feet (518 m). The crew reported problems with the automatic direction finder and {{they were unable to}} find the outer marker visually or aurally. The aircraft passed to the east of the outer marker and while outside the normal <b>procedure</b> <b>turn</b> area descended and hit the wooded slope on the north-west side of the Holston Mountain range, killing all 10 people on board.|$|E
25|$|The {{approach}} procedure in use for this flight {{in the low}} clouds and low visibility conditions that night required the pilot to fly over the MAC VOR at 3,900 feet, then turn west-northwest to fly out over the water, descend to 1,540 feet and level off within nine miles, then make a left base turn to fly east, back toward the airport (a teardrop <b>procedure</b> <b>turn),</b> and descend for final approach {{with the use of}} the MAC VOR. The pilot was not allowed to descend below 1,540 feet until the turn was completed, and then not below 1,045 feet unless he had the runway in sight. Once the pilot could see the airport from that altitude, he would be allowed to circle and land on the runway of his choice. This is called a circle-to-land manoeuvre, or sometimes a cloud break procedure. The pilot elected to attempt this circling approach to land on runway 29 instead of landing straight in on runway 11, though the reported clouds at the time would have made a circling approach impossible at the minimum altitude of 1,045 feet.|$|E
500|$|Despite this, {{possibly}} due {{to their}} concerns with passenger comfort (the VOR 1 approach would have required performing the [...] "circle to land" [...] maneuver at a relatively low altitude over the airport to land on runway 19), or possibly by simply being late to {{set up for the}} recommended VOR 1 approach (the flight time was only about 8 minutes from takeoff at Albany to the Glens Falls area, with a significant tailwind component of approximately 50 knots), the crew did not execute the VOR 1 approach. Instead, the crew appeared to select an improvised and unauthorized modified version of the VOR/DME 19 approach, which included flying outbound followed by a course reversal at about [...] north of the airport, over Lake George. As the crew performed what appeared to be an unpublished and unauthorized <b>procedure</b> <b>turn</b> for course reversal on the VOR/DME 19 approach path, they descended prematurely and hit the side of a mountain. It was subsequently determined that a [...] southerly wind created a downdraft effect which, coupled with the aircraft's low altitude over the terrain, contributed to the crash.|$|E

2500|$|The fatal {{accident}} occurred on 5 November 1956. The aircraft, a Handley Page HP.81 Hermes 4A (registration: G-ALDJ), operated an international non-scheduled passenger flight from Blackbushe via Malta and Cyprus to Tripoli and back. The first stop at Malta involved a crew change. Due {{to the flight}} arriving at Tripoli's King Idris Airport five hours late, there was a reduced rest time for the crew that {{had taken over the}} aircraft in Malta. However, this was insufficient to prevent a delayed takeoff from Idris Airport. Before the aircraft was due to land at Blackbushe Airport, it was cleared to Blackbushe beacon at [...] for a final approach to runway 08. Two minutes after the flightdeck crew reported passing the beacon at , the <b>procedure</b> <b>turn</b> was completed at [...] The aircraft was cleared to land after it had passed the Outer Marker, following which the aircraft descended below the ILS glide slope. It hit a beech tree [...] short of the runway threshold, swerved to the left and came to a halt in a group of pine trees [...] further on. The accident destroyed the aircraft and killed seven of the 80 occupants (three out of six crew members and four out of 74 passengers). The subsequent accident investigation established the captain's fatigue while operating in difficult conditions, as well as his misjudgement of the aircraft's height based on his vision of the airport lights, as the probable cause.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Procedure</b> <b>turn</b> (PT): ICAO {{defines a}} PT as a {{maneuver}} {{in which a}} turn is made away from a designated track followed by a turn {{in the opposite direction}} to permit the aircraft to intercept and proceed along the reciprocal of the designated track. A standardized way of reversing course to get lined up for final approach. The approach chart must indicate that a <b>procedure</b> <b>turn</b> is authorized for the approach, via a [...] "procedure turn barb" [...] symbol or a similar notation. Note that when a <b>procedure</b> <b>turn</b> exists for an approach, the maximum speed of the aircraft in the <b>procedure</b> <b>turn</b> is limited by regulations (typically, it should not exceed 200 knots IAS). The <b>procedure</b> <b>turn</b> is typically entered by tracking a navaid course outbound (usually following a reciprocal of the inbound course), and then turning 45° off of the course; after that, the pilot flies this leg for a certain time, then conducts a 180° turn to get on a 45° intercepting course, and then re-intercepts the inbound course.|$|E

50|$|Some {{approach}} procedures do {{not permit}} straight-in approaches unless the pilots are being radar vectored. In these situations, pilots are required to complete a <b>procedure</b> <b>turn</b> (PT) or other course reversal, generally within 10 NM of the PT fix, to establish the aircraft inbound on the intermediate or final approach segment. When conducting any type of approach, if the aircraft is not lined up for a straight-in approach, then a course reversal might be necessary. The idea of a course reversal is to allow sufficiently large changes in the course flown (in order to line the aircraft up with the final approach course), without taking too much space horizontally and while remaining {{within the confines of}} protected airspace. This is accomplished in one of three ways: a <b>procedure</b> <b>turn,</b> a holding pattern, or a teardrop course reversal.|$|E

50|$|Following {{the second}} <b>procedure</b> <b>turn,</b> a continual descent begins from {{a height of}} {{approximately}} 3,200 ft, as they had a definite glide path indication. This could not, however, {{have come from the}} ILS glide path transmitter, as the flight path led over the glide path station with its many weak and steep secondary glide path beams. The flight director system could offer an explanation for the regular rates of descent. At approximately 3,200 ft over N a spurious glide path was crossed during the second <b>procedure</b> <b>turn.</b> Now if {{on the basis of this}} indication, which might have also coincided with a localizer indication, the flight director was set to the approach mode in order to follow both pointers on this, the subsequent approach might be explained, but only if the two pilots neglected to keep the normal, continuous, mutual check on the basic navigational instruments and the marker control. The artificial horizon pitch bar which is not integrated with the ILS glide path signals required an average rate of descent of approximately 500 ft/min to maintain a 2.5° glide path without wind correction. In this instrumentation, the ILS glide path indication takes the form of a small triangle in the artificial horizon.|$|E

5000|$|The {{reason for}} the poor {{tracking}} of the ILS localizer during the first approach attempt {{can be explained by}} the defect found on the Captain's ILS equipment. The flag current which was set too high is not of significance here, as the aircraft never flew in an area where this localizer flag would normally have to respond. There should have been a localizer indication the whole hand. On the other hand, it was extremely disturbing that the deflection sensitivity of the localizer had been set more than 50% too high. Because the localizer indication and therefore the IFS steering pointer too were so [...] "jittery", they could hardly be followed anymore. In addition, it was easy to miss crossing the localizer, as this only lasted 3-4 seconds after the second <b>procedure</b> <b>turn,</b> which was completely unsuccessful, instead of the usual 10 seconds. The difficulties in intercepting and following the localizer up to the first overshoot, which is the latest time that a change of pilot and therefore also a change of the primarily used blind flying instruments may be assumed, become evident if one compares the flight path of the first section with that of the second.|$|E
