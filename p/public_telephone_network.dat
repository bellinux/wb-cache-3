The switch in turn connects the call to another subscriber of the same wireless service provider or to the <b>public</b> <b>telephone</b> <b>network,</b> which includes the networks of other wireless carriers. Many of these sites are camouflaged to blend with existing environments, particularly in scenic areas.|$|E
25|$|Since 1998, {{microband}} Asynchronous Transfer Mode {{technology has}} been used along the North–South Railway line to send television signals; 64 kbit/s transmission lines are leased from the Vietnam Post and Telecommunications Corporation (VPTC). Along some sections of the line—for example, from Hanoi to Vinh and from Nha Trang to Ho Chi Minh City—a fiber optic cable network has been deployed; Vietnam Railways intends to extend the network along the remaining distance from Vinh to Nha Trang. A switching system featuring digital exchanges is in place, connected via the existing transmission system and the <b>public</b> <b>telephone</b> <b>network.</b> As the modernization of the telecommunication system progresses, manual exchanges are gradually being replaced with digital exchanges.|$|E
