50|$|<b>Precision</b> <b>approach</b> <b>radars</b> (PAR) are {{commonly}} used by military controllers of airforces of several countries, to assist the pilot in final phases of landing in places where instrument landing system and other sophisticated airborne equipment are unavailable to assist the pilots in marginal or near zero visibility conditions. This procedure is also called talkdowns.|$|R
50|$|<b>Precision</b> <b>approach</b> <b>radars</b> {{are most}} {{frequently}} used at military air traffic control facilities. Many of these facilities use the AN/FPN-63, AN/MPN, or AN/TPN-22. These radars can provide precision guidance to a distance of 10 to 20 miles. The OJ-333 Radar scope is the indicator which the air traffic controller uses to provide instructions to the pilots.|$|R
25|$|Each {{air force}} base is {{equipped}} with air field <b>radar</b> <b>approach</b> systems (AFRAS) that monitors air traffic within the Air Field's operational sector 24 hours per day. These systems include primary <b>approach</b> <b>radars,</b> <b>precision</b> <b>approach</b> <b>radars,</b> and secondary surveillance radar and display systems. These systems {{have a range of}} more than 120km. The AFRAS are maintained by Saab Grintek as well as Tellumat. Air Force Base Overberg in the Western Cape is also equipped with a Doppler tracking radar and is used primarily by the Test Flight and Development Centre SAAF and the Denel Overberg Test Range for aircraft and missile development tests. In the Western Cape there is a radar station at Kapteinskop, jointly used by Air Force Base Langebaanweg and Cape Town International Airport to monitor air traffic. Air Force Base Makhado has another radar station located in the mountains {{to the north of the}} main base complex apart from its AFRAS radar (located in the main base itself).|$|R

50|$|This will {{be either}} a <b>precision</b> <b>approach</b> <b>radar</b> (PAR) or an airport {{surveillance}} radar (ASR) approach. Information is published in tabular form. The PAR provides vertical and lateral guidance plus range. The ASR only provides heading and range information.|$|E
50|$|The Army will {{continue}} to operate and maintain a <b>precision</b> <b>approach</b> <b>radar</b> (PAR) at Fort Sill's Henry Post Field for the foreseeable future. Since the Air Force frequently uses this service at Fort Sill, the agreement states the Army will provide the Air Force two years notice if future plans call for the cessation of PAR operations at Fort Sill. The agreement calls for the Army to continue {{the current level of}} funding for the operation and maintenance of the Fort Sill ARAC until the Sheppard RAPCON assumes the approach control responsibility. The Army {{will continue}} to fund the <b>precision</b> <b>approach</b> <b>radar</b> equipment and manpower necessary to support PAR operations at Henry Post Field.|$|E
50|$|The Air Operations Department employs 230 {{military}} and civilian personnel to operate NAS Meridain/McCain Field and Naval Outlying Landing Field (NOLF) Joe Williams. Their primary mission is to support Commander, Training Air Wing ONE, the wing's subordinate training squadrons and its associated T-45 Goshawk aircraft {{in the conduct of}} undergraduate strike pilot training. Additional services are furnished to support operations for NAS and transient military aircrews. Air Traffic Control Division operates the control tower and radar final control systems. They provide flight planning services and issue clearances and instructions to pilots for all phases of military flight operations within the vicinity of the airport. Ground Electronics Maintenance Division (GEMD) ensures all assigned UHF, VHF and FM radio communications, air navigation aids, weather monitoring/reporting equipment and <b>precision</b> <b>approach</b> <b>radars</b> required to conduct safe and effective flight operations around NAS Meridian and its outlying field operate at or above designated performance standards. GEMD also provides sound support services and functions as point of contact for matters related to 3M, frequency management, equipment configuration and computer repair/assistance.|$|R
50|$|It is {{equipped}} with an Instrument Landing System, VHF Omni-directional Radio Range, Distance Measuring Equipment, Airport Surveillance <b>Radar,</b> <b>approach</b> lights, <b>precision</b> <b>approach</b> angle guidance lights, and more.|$|R
50|$|The airport has one {{paved runway}} (900 m (2954 ft) x 20 m (67 ft)). The runway offered <b>Precision</b> <b>Approach</b> Path Indicator and illumination. Discussions were held about {{extending}} the runway to 1200 metres, but those plans were withdrawn due to severe protests by nearby residents. The airfield was in use from 06:30 - 23:59 daily. <b>Radar</b> <b>approach</b> had been available since June 2002.|$|R
50|$|On 1 July 2010 the Defence, Logistics and Environment {{operations}} of Elsag Datamat {{were transferred to}} SELEX Sistemi Integrati, together with Elsag's subsidiary Space Software Italia and the activities related to the PAR (<b>Precision</b> <b>Approach</b> <b>Radar)</b> radar systems for surface, land and naval applications, formerly owned by SELEX Galileo.|$|E
50|$|It {{is worth}} {{mentioning}} {{that in this}} TRACON for Windows version the player is given the option to work in TRACON or RAPCON but under RAPCON we simply see a classic Terminal Area Control over some military sectors, without any apparent possibility of reverting to the <b>Precision</b> <b>Approach</b> <b>Radar</b> position.|$|E
5000|$|The Carrier Controlled Approach is {{analogous}} to ground-controlled approach using the ship's <b>precision</b> <b>approach</b> <b>radar.</b> Pilots are told (via voice radio) where they are in relation to glideslope and final bearing (e.g., [...] "above glideslope, right of centerline"). The pilot then makes a correction and awaits further information from the controller.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Precision</b> <b>approach.</b> The MAP on a <b>precision</b> <b>approach</b> {{is reached}} when the {{aircraft}} reaches the decision height prescribed for the approach {{while maintaining the}} glideslope.|$|R
50|$|APALS (Autonomous <b>Precision</b> <b>Approach</b> Landing System). Lone Star Airlines became Lockheed Martin's APALS launch {{customer}} in 1996. The {{intent of the}} system was to provide <b>precision</b> <b>approach</b> capabilities at airports {{that did not have}} the equipment and procedures to support a <b>precision</b> <b>approach.</b> APALS equipped aircraft would be able to safely and successfully operate into and from airports under conditions not available to other aircraft.|$|R
50|$|Joint <b>Precision</b> <b>Approach</b> and Landing System is {{a similar}} system for {{military}} usage.|$|R
50|$|The {{squadron}} {{was quickly}} repurposed {{and brought back}} on 1 August 1962 as Marine Air Traffic Control Unit 73 (MATCU-73). MATCU-73 was responsible for providing air traffic control and <b>precision</b> <b>approach</b> <b>radar</b> services at NAS South Weymouth. This new designation {{did not last long}} because on 1 January 1963 they reverted to MACS-21.|$|E
50|$|Larger {{airports}} sometimes offer <b>precision</b> <b>approach</b> <b>radar</b> (PAR), {{but these}} systems {{are more common}} at military air bases than civilian airports. The aircraft's horizontal and vertical movement is tracked via radar, and the controller tells the pilot his position relative to the approach slope. Once the pilots can see the runway lights, they may continue with a visual landing.|$|E

50|$|To {{meet these}} {{requirements}} the report recommended installation of {{airport surveillance radar}} and installation of VHF omnidirectional range (VOR)/distance measuring equipment (DME) on aircraft. In addition the report made several other recommendations such as installing transponders to aircraft to provide altitude and identification information to ground-based radar and to install <b>precision</b> <b>approach</b> <b>radar</b> to improve the capability of aircraft to land in poor weather conditions.|$|E
50|$|The {{control tower}} {{constructed}} {{during the war}} burned down in an extensive fire on March 17, 1946, which caused $1.5 million worth of damage. Construction was not begun on a new tower until 1951; it was opened in June 1952. A new Tower/Communications Building replaced that structure in March 1976. The tower was equipped with radio navigation and landing aids including <b>precision</b> <b>approach</b> <b>radar,</b> non-directional beacon and VHF omni-directional range.|$|E
50|$|The ground-controlled {{approach}} was normal until the aircraft was {{seen on the}} <b>precision</b> <b>approach</b> <b>radar</b> suddenly descending below the glide slope. At 850 m (2,800 ft) from the runway threshold, the aircraft's landing gear struck part of the approach lighting system. The pilot {{lost control of the}} aircraft as it hit several more obstructions, including the 2 m (7 ft) seawall at the runway threshold, leaving a half mile long trail of burning wreckage on the airfield.|$|E
40|$|The {{content of}} this work is an {{overview}} of <b>precision</b> <b>approach</b> used by GNSS and avionics for operation in low visibility conditions. This thesis describes existing requirements and proposals for new standards {{that are important to}} define GBAS performance. The objective {{of this work}} is to compare the alternative systems to guide aircraft during <b>precision</b> <b>approach</b> CAT II/III. GBAS operational implementation is additionally devised in this thesis...|$|R
25|$|Prior to the WAAS, the U.S. National Airspace System (NAS) did {{not have}} the ability to provide lateral and {{vertical}} navigation for <b>precision</b> <b>approaches</b> for all users at all locations. The traditional system for <b>precision</b> <b>approaches</b> is the instrument landing system (ILS), which used a series of radio transmitters each broadcasting a single signal to the aircraft. This complex series of radios needs to be installed at every runway end, some offsite, along a line extended from the runway centerline, making the implementation of a <b>precision</b> <b>approach</b> both difficult and very expensive. The ILS system is composed of 180 different transmitting antennas at each point built. The newer system is free of huge antenna systems at each airport.|$|R
50|$|The airport has 7 hangars, Aeronautical Mechanicals, VOR, ILS CAT I, and PAPI (<b>Precision</b> <b>Approach</b> Path Indicator) system.|$|R
50|$|For {{military}} users, TLS {{also provides}} a <b>Precision</b> <b>Approach</b> <b>Radar</b> (PAR) graphic display of aircraft position compared to the desired approach course {{in order for a}} PAR operator to provide talk-down guidance to the pilot. Since the TLS operates using the long range band of SSR (1030/1090 MHz) there is no rain fade such as experienced with a traditional PAR that uses primary radar. For a traditional PAR, the ability to track the aircraft position is dependent on the aircraft radar cross section.|$|E
5000|$|AN/MPN-11 was {{a mobile}} (trailer-mounted) {{version of the}} AN/CPN-4 GCA unit. The CPN-4 was the {{follow-on}} replacement for the MPN-1. It contained newer, more powerful radars, better radios including UHF as standard and power-operated slewing of the <b>precision</b> <b>approach</b> <b>radar</b> (PAR) antennas. The horizontal and vertical radar presentations were contained on a single CRT screen. If necessary, a single operator could perform all of the GCA functions. (CPN stands for air-transportable [...] "Cargo" [...] Radar for Navigation.) The entire CPN-4 unit could {{be broken down into}} air-transportable pieces.) ...|$|E
50|$|The {{aircraft}} was descended with guidance from {{air traffic control}} using a <b>precision</b> <b>approach</b> <b>radar.</b> Despite this the crew allowed the aircraft to descend too quickly and failed to check what was the decision height for Leipzig Airport. The Tu-134 struck a radio mast only two to three metres above its base and crashed. Three of the six crew and 24 of the 28 passengers {{were killed in the}} crash. The majority of the passengers were travelling to visit the Leipzig Trade Fair. The surviving crewmembers and the radar controller were all sentenced to prison terms {{as a result of the}} crash.|$|E
