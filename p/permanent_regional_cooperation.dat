30|$|But {{the fact}} that the <b>regional</b> <b>cooperation</b> body does not possess {{monetary}} incitements (ownership) towards the PTA, is used by the PTA as an argument against involving the <b>regional</b> <b>cooperation</b> body in all matters. For example in situations in which the <b>regional</b> <b>cooperation</b> body agenda differs from that of the county council, the PTA excludes the <b>regional</b> <b>cooperation</b> body from involvement and, approaching the county council and certain municipalities.|$|R
30|$|The <b>regional</b> <b>cooperation</b> {{body has}} a {{non-financial}} {{relationship with the}} PTA and is responsible for strategic regional traffic planning in the county. The <b>regional</b> <b>cooperation</b> body consists of political representatives from the county council and the 12 municipalities {{and serves as a}} “meeting place” for discussing county issues. The <b>regional</b> <b>cooperation</b> body also includes civil servants working in the public administration.|$|R
30|$|The {{relationship}} between the county council and the <b>regional</b> <b>cooperation</b> body seems to have changed due to the election in 2006. The PTA president stated that before the 2006 election, political dialogue between the PTA, <b>regional</b> <b>cooperation</b> body, and county council was very productive. Before 2006, the political orientation of the majority was the same in both the <b>regional</b> <b>cooperation</b> body and the county council; according to the PTA president, both the <b>regional</b> <b>cooperation</b> body and county council chairs were good friends. After the 2006 election, the political majorities of the different organizations changed, and now the county council was governed by a Conservative block, whereas the <b>regional</b> <b>cooperation</b> body had a Social Democratic chair. According to the PTA president, the dialogue between the county council and the <b>regional</b> <b>cooperation</b> body had become “frosty”. Due to these frosty relations, the PTA president almost exclusively discussed policy issues with the county council as a single part [31]. In addition, civil servants working in the municipalities stated in interview that their main dialogue was with PTA directly, not via the <b>regional</b> <b>cooperation</b> body (see, e.g., [32]).|$|R
40|$|<b>Regional</b> <b>cooperation</b> is {{a strong}} {{instrument}} in common cross-border solution development. Currently, the main Energy sector challenges in the European Union, {{as well as in}} other world economies, are mainly referred to sustainable, competitive and secure energy market. The Energy sector issues due to their nature cannot frequently be effectively resolved by a single country. Stakeholders trying to find the best approach for communication created various formats of <b>regional</b> <b>cooperation,</b> therewith complicating the overall system and hampering problem solving by function duplication and overlapping. The research provides an insight to the <b>regional</b> <b>cooperation</b> practice in the Baltic Sea region in electricity sector. The aim of the paper is to present the developed by the authors Model of <b>Regional</b> <b>cooperation</b> based on analysis of the existing practice of <b>regional</b> <b>cooperation</b> in the Energy sector. The Object of the research is the Energy sector development opportunities, while the Subject of the research – existing formats of macro-regional cooperation addressing Energy sector challenges. Based on quantitative and qualitative data analysis the two models for <b>regional</b> <b>cooperation</b> facilitation were developed: Optimized Strategic Model of <b>regional</b> <b>cooperation</b> in a field of economy and Functional Model for Optimization of <b>regional</b> <b>cooperation.</b> The both models can be applied not only in the Baltic Sea region, but also in any other region of the European Union or the world, for different spheres of economy...|$|R
40|$|Economic {{reform in}} China since 1978 {{has led to}} the rise of urban {{entrepreneurialism}} and a powerful force of political fragmentation. There is intensive inter-jurisdiction competition for capital, from both the market and central resources. Building on a debate about the problematic nature and fragmented consequences of the entrepreneurial strategy, this paper argues that <b>regional</b> <b>cooperation</b> constitutes a new policy option for jurisdictions to overcome the negative effects of political fragmentation. It first reviews <b>regional</b> <b>cooperation</b> in China in general to provide a background of contextual changes and policy responses since 1949 and discusses the rationale behind the current proliferating of <b>regional</b> <b>cooperation.</b> It then develops a theoretical interpretation of what is behind the increasing interest in <b>regional</b> <b>cooperation</b> and how such cooperation is impacted by state politics in a transitional economy. It is argued that current <b>regional</b> <b>cooperation</b> projects are mostly unformulaic in nature and thus subject to contextually specific circumstances and political wills of key officials. Rather than serving as an institutional platform for inter-jurisdiction networking, <b>regional</b> <b>cooperation</b> may become a means or 'institutional fix' to open up new venues for capital accumulation. The recent Pan-Pearl River Delta Forum is used to illustrate the formation and growth of a controversial <b>regional</b> <b>cooperation</b> project from a development background of the nature outlined above. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
30|$|This section {{deals with}} the {{regional}} organization, the <b>regional</b> <b>cooperation</b> body. The <b>regional</b> <b>cooperation</b> body has no budgetary influence over the PTA, so its financial resources are weak {{compared with those of}} the municipalities and the county council. Despite this, in the studied case, the <b>regional</b> <b>cooperation</b> body managed to mobilize other resources to influence the planning process. The main strategies the <b>regional</b> <b>cooperation</b> body used were the mobilization of informational resources and political mobilization by seeking cooperation with powerful individual actors. This section describes how resource exchange occurs horizontally, compared with the former case in which resource dependency occurred via hierarchal delegation chains.|$|R

40|$|Recently, {{competition}} among universities {{has a whole}} new face, and emphasis is given toward interdependence and interactive evolution between universities and regions. From this social perspective, universities should contribute to regional development by serving the regional society using results of intellectual work, and {{it is necessary for}} universities to accomplish social contribution and <b>regional</b> <b>cooperation</b> strategically. One of the most important parts in strategic planning is that students participate in activities for social contribution and <b>regional</b> <b>cooperation.</b> This paper presents a survey of the university students’ awareness on social contribution and <b>regional</b> <b>cooperation</b> using several statistical methods and attempts to find factors which affect activities for social contribution and <b>regional</b> <b>cooperation</b> using logistic regression analysis...|$|R

40|$|This chapter {{argues that}} <b>regional</b> <b>cooperation</b> {{may be a}} {{promising}} framework to work towards sustainable development. There are two broad pathways linking <b>regional</b> <b>cooperation</b> and sustainable development. On the one hand, shared or transboundary socio-environmental concerns may spark <b>regional</b> <b>cooperation</b> and on the other, pre-existing regional organisations created for other purposes become frameworks to address sustainability concerns. Yet, neither of these processes is automatic and whether they take place depends {{on the existence of}} particular drivers pursuing a sustainability agenda at the regional level. Ultimately, whether <b>regional</b> <b>cooperation</b> fosters sustainable development and how this takes place thus depends to a large extent on the specific people or organisations driving a sustainability agenda at the regional level and their relationship to national governments...|$|R

40|$|This article {{analyses}} <b>regional</b> <b>cooperation</b> {{between the}} Stabilisation and Association Process (SAP) states with {{particular emphasis on}} the interplay with EU integration. It argues that <b>regional</b> <b>cooperation</b> is not solely a means of stabilising the SAP 'five' (SAP 5) in advance of policies to integrate them with the EU but that <b>regional</b> <b>cooperation</b> is itself {{a vital part of}} the EU integration process. This applies to both the regional integration/trade liberalisation component, which is a clear functional EU pre-accession activity, and also to the more diverse set of activities which are targeting the regional hard and soft security problems. The latter addresses the more baseline, region-wide aspects of Europeanisation, and is therefore more of a foundation course for EU accession than integration 'proper', but is nevertheless a necessary step in the SAP countries own 'return to Europe'. With Croatia on the verge of EU candidate status the political conditions for SAP zone <b>regional</b> <b>cooperation</b> should become increasingly favourable and it is important that the practical as well as political contributions of the <b>regional</b> <b>cooperation</b> commitment to the EU integration endeavour of the SAP 5 are clearly understood. It is also vital that the actual <b>regional</b> <b>cooperation</b> programme avoids over-ambitious agendas and is properly adjusted to real needs and evolving circumstances of the SAP region.

40|$|A central {{factor in}} the lack of South Asian <b>regional</b> <b>cooperation</b> is the visceral {{animosity}} between India and Pakistan. The India-Pakistan security dilemma has prevented the region from exploiting a number of opportunities that <b>regional</b> <b>cooperation</b> could offer, including the benefits of economic growth, water/energy security and {{the social construction of}} intraregional goodwill through cultural interaction. These benefits could be employed by national governments to pursue development goals. It is incumbent upon India and Pakistan {{to pave the way for}} substantive <b>regional</b> <b>cooperation</b> by taking measures to encourage cross-border economic and social activities. There are a number of challenges in the India-Pakistan relationship that hinder <b>regional</b> <b>cooperation.</b> However economic integration, if decoupled from political disputes, provides a model through which the two states can develop mutually beneficial relations. In particular, three specific areas of cooperation between Pakistan and India should be pursued: increased levels of trade and the introduction of reforms that facilitate bilateral foreign direct investment; cooperation vis-à-vis water and energy resources; and the reduction of travel restrictions. These processes would constitute the first steps towards wider <b>regional</b> <b>cooperation...</b>|$|R
40|$|The {{presented}} {{thesis is}} analyzing the <b>regional</b> <b>cooperation</b> in the Western Balkans (WB) focusing on interactions of local actors.

Contemporary studies on New Regionalism (NR) actually do not consider the Western Balkans {{to be part of this}} process and as a result we lack sufficient information about the basic characteristics of this region. The author proves that the WB is engaged in the process of the new regionalism and in fact by focusing on the institutional structure he demonstrates that several parallel processes are ongoing in the region as for example <b>regional</b> <b>cooperation,</b> integration or cooperation with another region. For the purpose of this research two projects of <b>regional</b> <b>cooperation</b> were chosen, South Eastern European Cooperation Process (SEECP) and the <b>Regional</b> <b>Cooperation</b> Council (RCC) which are regarded as the main pillars of the political cooperation in the WB.
