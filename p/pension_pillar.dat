However, brokerage in Slovenia has a much longer tradition: the first stock exchange in Ljubljana existed as early as in the period between 1924 and 1942. Unfortunately, during the Second World War the trading on the old exchange was suspended, {{and after the war}} also officially banned by a decree. Slovenians were thus left without a stock exchange for almost half a century. Then in the 1989 the Ljubljana Stock Exchange was officially established. In the year 1993 LJSE introduced electronic trading on BTS - on complex Stock Exchange Information System three times a week, floor trading still remained on Tuesdays and Thursdays. The new system of electronic information dissemination - SEOnet was launched in year 2002. Three years later LJSE introduced the elite segment of the official market, listing Slovenia's prime companies, and named it Prime Market. In the middle of the year 2008 the first regional road-show of SE Europe, organized by all 8 exchanges from the region, was held in Zagreb. In the same year Vienna Stock Exchange became the new majority owner of the LJSE (it acquired an 83.34% share). Year 2009 was crucial for establishment of [...] "CEE Stock Exchange Group" [...] (CEESEG), which at the time comprised the Vienna Stock Exchange and the stock exchanges of Budapest, Ljubljana and Prague. In the year 2010 {{there were a lot of}} important events: The SBITOP Index as the first genuine LJSE blue-chip index became a benchmark index, LJSE launched INFO HRAMBA - the new information system for the central storage of regulated information of all issuers on the LJSE, LJSE published the Slovene Capital Market Development Strategy, which had been prepared in cooperation with the capital market participants and was the answer to the changed economic and financial circumstances in the previous two years, LJSE proposed the introduction of 'P accounts' in the third <b>pension</b> <b>pillar,</b> LJSE started trading on the international trading system Xetra® and thus became integrated into the international capital market. As of July 2015 Ljubljana Stock Exchange is owned by Zagreb Stock Exchange. On 22 February 2016, the Ljubljana Stock Exchange, along with the Belgrade Stock Exchange, decided to join SEE Link, and EBRD-sponsored regional network for trading securities.|$|E

We demonstrate that highly indebted countries with no access to international financial markets and unsustainable pension systems can introduce radical reforms in response to short-term funding needs rather than long-term adequacy concerns. We argue that the narrow timeframe of the recent reforms raises questions about the sound footing of the new systems which may ultimately not prevent the introduction of further measures.

Firstly, global private <b>pension</b> <b>pillar</b> is characterized. Its long term return is estimated from derived virtual portfolio.

The Advocacy Coalition Framework in exploring the dynamics of the public-policy process proved to be able to explain situations where there is sharp political conflict.

40|$|The private <b>pension</b> <b>pillar</b> {{established}} in 1998 has generated equally important short-, medium- and long-term effects. This article addresses the short- and medium-term time horizons, which differ from one another. In the short term, the government lost contribution revenues, while its pension expenditures did not decrease. However, since this shortfall in state revenues did not influence the consumption and savings decisions of households, {{in this analysis}} the short-term indicators of fiscal impact on demand disregard the impact of lost revenues. In the medium term, however, the rechanneling of contributions increased public debt and household savings. Consequently, similarly to official statistics, our household indicators and our medium-term fiscal indicator (augmented SNA deficit) {{take into account the}} effect of lost revenues. As the vast majority of members returned to the state <b>pension</b> <b>pillar</b> in 2011, for the purposes of our analysis, we could well assume that the private <b>pension</b> <b>pillar</b> never existed. Accordingly, the difference between our medium-term fiscal indicator and the short-term indicator disappears. As a result, we have changed our household indicators retroactively {{in such a way as}} if the contributions and the returns they yielded had always belonged to the state. This was necessary because the official statistics do not spread this amount over time, but account for it in full for 2011 as a capital transfer between households and the general government, which renders evaluation of the developments extremely difficult. pension reform, savings, pension funds, statistical correction, net lending, deficit. ...|$|E

We use a multi-period overlapping generation model with a pay-as-you-go <b>pension</b> <b>pillar,</b> a funded <b>pension</b> <b>pillar</b> and a government. Shocks are smoothed via the public debt and variations in the indexation of pension entitlements and pension contributions. The intensity of these adjustments increases when the pension funding ratio or public debt gets closer to their boundaries. The best-performing pension arrangement is a hybrid funded scheme in which both contributions and entitlement indexation are simultaneously deployed as stabilisation instruments. We find that contribution and indexation adjustment policies are substitutes {{and the same is}} the case for contribution and tax adjustment policies. By contrast, indexation and tax adjustment policies are complements. We compare different taxation regimes and conclude that a regime in which pension benefits are taxed, while contributions are paid before taxes, is preferred to a regime in which contributions are paid after taxes, but benefits are untaxed...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. The aim of {{the study}} was is to {{evaluate}} the impact of a privately accumulated second pillar compo-nent on old-age pension. This evaluation is based on quantitative, statistical data and qualitative analysis of pension accumulation results in second pillar during the years 2004 – 2012. Three groups of different monthly wage size (low, medium, and high) earners are analyzed by calculating the accumulated amounts and old-age pension values of persons who joined and who did not join the second <b>pillar</b> <b>pension</b> funds in 2004 and who re-tired in the beginning of 2013. The pension reform success (or failure) is evaluated {{from the point of view}} of old age pension beneficiaries by comparison of gain or loss of all three groups of participants due to participation in second <b>pillar</b> <b>pension</b> funds. The results show that due to the longer life expectancy the capital accumulated by women in the second pillar does not exceed the present value of loss in the pay-as-you-go system. The com-parison of “official ” annuities exposes a more optimistic result for both genders of participants of fully funded private second <b>pillar</b> <b>pension</b> funds, but is not confirmed by commercial annuities.

Within the pension block we model both the first <b>pension</b> <b>pillar,</b> financed on a pay-as-you-go basis, and the fully-funded second pillar of the Slovenian pension system. The modelling of the first <b>pension</b> <b>pillar</b> is based on cash flows of the mandatory pension insurance institution, the relationship between the pension base and the pension, and the process of harmonising pension growth to wage growth. The modelling of the second pillar centres on implementation of the liquidity constraint. Use was made of supplementary pension profiles, and the ratio between premia paid and pensions paid out from supplementary pension insurance. The category of total pension was also introduced, and the model ensured that at every point households adjusted the scope of labour supply and their current consumption towards the target total pension. ...|$|E

Stress was layed upon varying {{the parameters of the}} current Slovenian pension system and introducing mandatory supplementary pension insurance in Slovenia.

The volume of supplementary pension saving is insufficient at present in Slovenia to compensate the deterioration of rights from the first <b>pension</b> <b>pillar.</b> Not only is the participation in the (voluntary) second pillar insufficient, but especially the premia are too low.

40|$|This paper {{studies the}} impact of recent changes in second pension pillars of three Central and Eastern European Countries. The paper seeks to answer the {{following}} questions: i) what is the impact on the sustainability of Poland's pension system of the decrease in the pension contribution going to the second <b>pension</b> <b>pillar</b> from 7. 3 % to 2. 3 % in 2011; ii) {{what are the implications of}} the recent changes on gross replacement rates; iii) does the weakening of the Polish second pension system have a different impact on pension system sustainability than a similar move in a Hungarian-style pension system with a defined-benefit first pillar and iv) how does Estonia's temporary decrease in pension contributions compensated by temporarily higher future rates affect pension sustainability in that country. The simulation results show that in our baseline scenario the Polish move would permanently lower future pension-system debt, chiefly as a result of a cut in replacement rates. But using a combination of pessimistic assumptions including strong population ageing, low real wage growth and a high indexation of existing pension benefits, coupled with bringing in tax expenditures related to the third voluntary <b>pension</b> <b>pillar</b> and an increase in the share of minimum pensions leads to higher pension system deficits and eventually more public debt at a very long horizon. The simulations also suggest that the Hungarian pension reversal reduces deficit and debt only temporarily, mainly because of Hungary's costly defined-benefit first pension pillar: the weakening of the second pillar is tantamount to swapping low current replacement rates (in the defined-contribution second pillar) against high future replacement rates in the defined-benefit first <b>pension</b> <b>pillar.</b> Finally, results show that the Estonian move will increase public debt only very moderately in the long run, even though this result is sensitive to the effective interest rate on public debt...|$|E
