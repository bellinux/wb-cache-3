25|$|According to neuroimaging data, PET {{studies on}} recall and {{recognition}} have consistently found increases in regional {{cerebral blood flow}} (RCBF) in the following six brain regions: (1) the prefrontal cortex, particularly on the right hemisphere; (2) the hippocampal and parahippocampal regions of the medial temporal lobe; (3) the anterior cingulate cortex; (4) the posterior midline area that includes posterior cingulate, retrosplenial (see retrosplenial region), <b>precuneus,</b> and cuneus regions; (5) the inferior parietal cortex, especially on the right hemisphere; and (6) the cerebellum, particularly on the left.|$|E
25|$|The {{brain regions}} {{associated}} with theory of mind include the superior temporal gyrus (STS), the temporoparietal junction (TPJ), the medial prefrontal cortex (MPFC), the <b>precuneus,</b> and the amygdala. The reduced {{activity in the}} MPFC of individuals with schizophrenia {{is associated with the}} Theory of mind deficit and may explain impairments in social function among people with schizophrenia. Increased neural activity in MPFC is related to better perspective-taking, emotion management, and increased social functioning. Disrupted brain activities in areas related to theory of mind may increase social stress or disinterest in social interaction, and contribute to the social dysfunction associated with schizophrenia.|$|E
25|$|NREM {{sleep is}} {{characterized}} by decreased global and regional cerebral blood flow. Non-REM sleep which constitutes ~80% of all sleep in humans. Initially, {{it was expected that}} the brainstem, which was implicated in arousal would be inactive, but this was later on found to have been due to low resolution of PET studies and it was shown that there is some slow wave activity in the brainstem as well. However, other parts of the brain, including the <b>precuneus,</b> basal forebrain and basal ganglia are deactivated during sleep. Many areas of the cortex are also inactive, but to different levels. For example, the ventromedial prefrontal cortex is considered the least active area while the primary cortex, the least deactivated.|$|E
25|$|Platel (2005) defined musical {{semantic}} memory as memory for pieces without memory for the temporal or spatial elements; and musical episodic memory as memory for pieces and {{the context in}} which they were learned. It was found that two distinct patterns of neural activations existed when comparing semantic and episodic components of musical memory. Controlling for processes of early auditory analysis, working memory and mental imagery, Platel found that retrieval of semantic musical memory involved activation in the right inferior and middle frontal gyri, the superior and inferior right temporal gyri, the right anterior cingulate gyrus and parietal lobe region. There was also some activation in the middle and inferior frontal gyri in the left hemisphere. Retrieval of episodic musical memory resulted in activation bilaterally in the middle and superior frontal gyri and the <b>precuneus.</b> Although bilateral activation was found there was dominance in the right hemisphere. This research suggests independence of episodic and semantic musical memory. The Levitin Effect demonstrates accurate {{semantic memory}} for musical pitch and tempo among listeners, even without musical training, and without episodic memory of the original learning context.|$|E
2500|$|Neuroimaging {{research}} has supported this view, demonstrating specific brain regions consistently engaged during theory of mind tasks. PET research on theory of mind, using verbal and pictorial story comprehension tasks, has identified {{a set of}} brain regions including the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), and area around posterior superior temporal sulcus (pSTS), and sometimes <b>precuneus</b> and amygdala/temporopolar cortex. [...] Subsequently, research on the neural basis of theory of mind has diversified, with separate lines of research focused on the understanding of beliefs, intentions, and more complex properties of minds such as psychological traits.|$|E
2500|$|There {{is higher}} {{prevalence}} of dyslexia in males than in females. [...] However, different abnormalities {{are found in}} female brains as opposed to male brains. In a study that examined gray matter volume in dyslexic females, {{it was found that}} there was less gray matter volume in the right <b>precuneus</b> and paracentral lobule/medial frontal gyrus. [...] In males, there was less gray matter volume in the left inferior parietal cortex. [...] This study shows that dyslexia in females does not involve the left hemisphere regions involved in language as it does in males. Instead, it affects the sensory and motor cortices such as the motor and premotor cortex and primary visual cortex.|$|E
2500|$|Studies from Rebecca Saxe's lab at MIT, using a false-belief versus false-photograph task {{contrast}} {{aimed at}} isolating the mentalizing {{component of the}} false-belief task, have very consistently found activation in mPFC, <b>precuneus,</b> and temporo-parietal junction (TPJ), right-lateralized. [...] In particular, it has been proposed that the right TPJ (rTPJ) is selectively involved in representing the beliefs of others. [...] However, some debate exists, as some scientists have noted that the same rTPJ region has been consistently activated during spatial reorienting of visual attention; Jean Decety from the University of Chicago and Jason Mitchell from Harvard have thus proposed that the rTPJ subserves a more general function involved in both false-belief understanding and attentional reorienting, rather than a mechanism specialized for social cognition. However, {{it is possible that}} the observation of overlapping regions for representing beliefs and attentional reorienting may simply be due to adjacent, but distinct, neuronal populations that code for each. The resolution of typical fMRI studies may not be good enough to show that distinct/adjacent neuronal populations code for each of these processes. In a study following Decety and Mitchell, Saxe and colleagues used higher-resolution fMRI and showed that the peak of activation for attentional reorienting is approximately 6-10mm above the peak for representing beliefs. Further corroborating that differing populations of neurons may code for each process, they found no similarity in the patterning of fMRI response across space.|$|E
2500|$|Multivariate pattern {{analysis}} using EEG {{has suggested that}} an evidence based perceptual decision model may be applicable to free will decisions. It was found that decisions could be predicted by neural activity immediately after stimulus perception. Furthermore, when the participant was unable to determine {{the nature of the}} stimulus the recent decision history predicted the neural activity (decision). The starting point of evidence accumulation was in effect shifted towards a previous choice (suggesting a priming bias). Another study has found that subliminally priming a participant for a particular decision outcome (showing a cue for 13ms) could be used to influence free decision outcomes. Likewise, it has been found that decision history alone can be used to predict future decisions. The prediction capacities of the Soon et al. (2008) experiment were successfully replicated using a linear SVM model based on participant decision history alone (without any brain activity data). Despite this, a recent study has sought to confirm the applicability of a perceptual decision model to free will decisions. When shown a masked and therefore invisible stimulus, participants were asked to either guess between a category or make a free decision for a particular category. Multivariate {{pattern analysis}} using fMRI could be trained on [...] "free decision" [...] data to successfully predict [...] "guess decisions", and trained on [...] "guess data" [...] in order to predict [...] "free decisions" [...] (in the <b>precuneus</b> and cuneus region).|$|E
50|$|The <b>precuneus</b> is {{a region}} {{of the brain that}} is {{involved}} in attention, episodic memory, and visuospatial processing.

5000|$|The <b>precuneus</b> is {{involved}} in memory tasks, such as when people look at images and try to respond {{based on what they}} have remembered in regard to verbal questions about their spatial details. It {{is involved}} with the left prefrontal cortex in the recall of episodic memories including past episodes related to the self. The <b>precuneus</b> is also involved in source memory (in which the [...] "source" [...] circumstances of a memory are recalled) with the left inferior prefrontal cortex: here its role is suggested to be providing rich episodic contextual associations used by the prefrontal cortex to select the correct past memory. In the recollection of memories, {{it has been suggested that}} the <b>precuneus</b> 'decides' whether context information exists that can be useful for involving the aid of the hippocampus. Alternatively it has a different involvement when judging the familiarity as it decides whether the processing of perceptual features would be more useful. In this way the <b>precuneus</b> gets involved in diverse processes such as attention, episodic memory retrieval, working memory and conscious perception.|$|E

5000|$|The <b>precuneus</b> {{seems to}} be a {{recently}} expanded part of the brain, as in less developed primates such as New world monkeys [...] "the superior parietal and precuneate regions are poorly developed". It has been noted that [...] "the <b>precuneus</b> is more highly developed (i.e. comprises a larger portion of the brain volume) in human beings than in non-human primates or other animals, has the most complex columnar cortical organization and is among the last regions to myelinate".|$|E
50|$|Episodic {{memory of}} musical {{information}} involves {{the ability to}} recall the former context associated with a musical excerpt. In the condition invoking episodic memory for music, activations were found bilaterally {{in the middle and}} superior frontal gyri and <b>precuneus,</b> with activation predominant in the right hemisphere. Other studies have found the <b>precuneus</b> to become activated in successful episodic recall. As it was activated in the familiar memory condition of episodic memory, this activation may be explained by the successful recall of the melody.|$|E
50|$|The <b>precuneus</b> {{is a part}} of the {{superior}} parietal lobule in front of the occipital lobe (cuneus). It is hidden in the medial longitudinal fissure between the two cerebral hemispheres. It is sometimes described as the medial area of {{the superior}} parietal cortex. The <b>precuneus</b> is bounded anteriorly by the marginal branch of the cingulate sulcus, posteriorly by the parietooccipital sulcus, and inferiorly by the subparietal sulcus. It is involved with episodic memory, visuospatial processing, reflections upon self, and aspects of consciousness.|$|E

50|$|It is {{also known}} after Achille-Louis Foville as the {{quadrate}} lobule of Foville. The Latin form of praecuneus was first used in 1868 and the English <b>precuneus</b> in 1879.|$|E
50|$|Functional imaging has {{linked the}} <b>precuneus</b> to the {{processes}} involved in self-consciousness, such as reflective self-awareness, that involve rating one's own personality traits compared to those judged of other people.|$|E
50|$|Together {{with the}} prefrontal cortex, the <b>precuneus,</b> is more {{activated}} upon {{the learning of}} words briefly flashed when they are supraliminal (and so enter consciousness) than subliminal (and so do not enter consciousness).|$|E
50|$|Several {{brain regions}} have {{been implicated in}} the {{neurological}} basis of flashbacks. The medial temporal lobes, the <b>precuneus,</b> the posterior cingulate gyrus and the prefrontal cortex are the most typically referenced with regards to involuntary memories.|$|E
50|$|The <b>precuneus</b> {{has been}} {{suggested}} {{to be involved in}} directing attention in space both when an individual makes movements and when imaging or preparing them. It is involved in motor imagery and shifting attention between motor targets. It is also involved in motor coordination that requires shifting attention to different spatial locations. It is also together with the dorsal premotor cortex involved in visuospatial mental operations (such as in a modified form of the game of Amidakuji). It is suggested that while the premotor area engages in the mental operation, the <b>precuneus</b> aids monitoring the success of that operation in terms of internally represented visual images.|$|E
