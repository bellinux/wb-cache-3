5|$|USB 3.0 {{introduced}} Type-A SuperSpeed <b>plugs</b> and receptacles {{as well as}} micro-sized Type-B SuperSpeed <b>plugs</b> and receptacles. The 3.0 receptacles are backward-compatible {{with the}} corresponding pre-3.0 <b>plugs.</b>|$|E
5|$|Their {{resistance}} to arc erosion makes iridium alloys ideal for electrical contacts for spark <b>plugs,</b> and iridium-based spark <b>plugs</b> are particularly used in aviation.|$|E
5|$|USB3.0 {{defines a}} new SuperSpeed {{transfer}} mode, with associated new backward compatible <b>plugs,</b> receptacles, and cables. SuperSpeed <b>plugs</b> and receptacles are {{identified with a}} distinct logo and blue inserts in standard format receptacles.|$|E
30|$|In the {{vibratory}} sleeve penetration process, {{there are}} three degrees of soil <b>plug</b> inside the sleeve, namely the unplugged, partially <b>plugged</b> and fully <b>plugged.</b> When the soil <b>plug</b> is fully <b>plugged,</b> the soil <b>plug</b> doesn’t slide along the sleeve wall. Hence, the open-end piles in fully <b>plugged</b> mode behave like closed-end piles. Nevertheless, there is relative sliding between the soil <b>plug</b> and sleeve wall in other types of <b>plugged</b> mode.|$|R

30|$|When {{the degree}} of soil <b>plug</b> is fully-plugged, total {{internal}} shaft resistance Q_si is larger than soil <b>plug</b> end resistance Q_p, and soil <b>plug</b> resistance Q_plug is equal to soil <b>plug</b> end resistance Q_p. When {{the degree of}} soil <b>plug</b> is partially-plugged, total internal shaft resistance Q_si is smaller than soil <b>plug</b> end resistance Q_p, and soil <b>plug</b> resistance Q_plug is equal to total internal shaft resistance Q_si.|$|R
5|$|A recommended, {{backward}} compatible change to Mini-B <b>plugs</b> {{that results in}} longer lasting connectors.|$|E
5|$|The Micro plug {{design is}} rated {{for at least}} 10,000 connect-disconnect cycles, {{which is more than}} the Mini plug design. The Micro {{connector}} is also designed to reduce the mechanical wear on the device; instead the easier-to-replace cable is designed to bear the mechanical wear of connection and disconnection. The Universal Serial Bus Micro-USB Cables and Connectors Specification details the mechanical characteristics of Micro-A <b>plugs,</b> Micro-AB receptacles (which accept both Micro-A and Micro-B <b>plugs),</b> and Micro-B <b>plugs</b> and receptacles, along with a standard-A receptacle to Micro-A plug adapter.|$|E
5|$|There {{are several}} types of USB connector, {{including}} some that have been added while the specification progressed. The original USB specification detailed standard-A and standard-B <b>plugs</b> and receptacles; the B connector was necessary so that cabling could be plug ended at both ends and still prevent users from connecting one computer receptacle to another. The first engineering change notice to the USB2.0 specification added Mini-B <b>plugs</b> and receptacles.|$|E
40|$|Friction Pull <b>Plug</b> Welding (FPPW) is a {{solid state}} repair process for defects up to one inch in length, only {{requiring}} single sided tooling (OSL) for usage on flight hardware. Experimental data {{has shown that the}} mass of <b>plug</b> heat sink remaining above the top of the plate surface after a weld is completed (the <b>plug</b> heat sink) affects the bonding at the <b>plug</b> top. A minimized heat sink ensures complete bonding of the <b>plug</b> to the plate at the <b>plug</b> top. However, with a minimal heat sink three major problems can arise, the entire <b>plug</b> could be pulled through the plate hole, the central portion of the <b>plug</b> could be separated along grain boundaries, or the <b>plug</b> top hat can be separated from the body. The Chamfered Heat Sink Pull <b>Plug</b> Design allows for complete bonding along the ISL interface through an outside diameter minimal mass heat sink, while maintaining enough central mass in the <b>plug</b> to prevent <b>plug</b> pull through, central separation, and <b>plug</b> top hat separation...|$|R
5000|$|A {{straight}} <b>plug</b> (or no-flare <b>plug)</b> is a typical-looking cylinder, without flares, and is kept {{in place}} by sliding o-rings against {{both ends of the}} <b>plug.</b> A grooved <b>plug</b> is a variation on the straight <b>plug,</b> with grooves carved in the material to hold the o-rings snug.|$|R
50|$|The {{device with}} a mini-A <b>plug</b> {{inserted}} became an OTG A-device, and the device with a mini-B <b>plug</b> inserted became a B-device (see above). The type of <b>plug</b> inserted {{was detected by}} the state of the ID pin (the mini-A <b>plug's</b> ID pin was grounded, while the mini-B <b>plug's</b> was floating).|$|R
5|$|USB 3.0 and USB 1.0 Type-A <b>plugs</b> and {{receptacles}} {{are designed}} to interoperate. In order to achieve USB3.0's SuperSpeed (and SuperSpeed+ for USB3.1Gen2), 5 extra pins {{are added to the}} unused area of the original 4 pin USB1.0 design, making USB3.0 Type-A <b>plugs</b> and receptacles backward compatible to those of USB1.0.|$|E
5|$|Automobile air {{conditioning}} systems were commonly fitted with fusible <b>plugs,</b> operating at 100–110°C, but from concerns about the environmental effects of any released refrigerant gas this function has {{been taken over by}} an electrical switch.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{completion}} of the dam, the entrances to the two outer diversion tunnels were sealed at the opening and halfway through the tunnels with large concrete <b>plugs.</b> The downstream halves of the tunnels following the inner <b>plugs</b> are now the main bodies of the spillway tunnels. The inner diversion tunnels were plugged at approximately one-third of their length, beyond which they now carry steel pipes connecting the intake towers to the power plant and outlet works. The inner tunnels' outlets are equipped with gates that can be closed to drain the tunnels for maintenance.|$|E
2500|$|This <b>plug,</b> {{commonly}} called a 13A <b>plug</b> or 13 amp <b>plug,</b> has three rectangular pins forming an isosceles triangle. The BS 1363 <b>plug</b> has a fuse which is suitably rated {{to protect the}} appliance's flexible cord from overload.|$|R
50|$|At {{least one}} {{manufacturer}} sells a <b>plug</b> that combines a cigarette lighter <b>plug</b> and a powerlet, {{in much the}} same way that combination auto/airplane notebook computer power adapters combine a cigarette lighter <b>plug</b> and an ARINC 628/EmPower <b>plug.</b>|$|R
5000|$|The wire {{from each}} spark <b>plug</b> is {{just long enough}} to reach the distributor, without excess. Each end of a spark <b>plug</b> wire has a metal {{terminal}} that clips onto the spark <b>plug</b> and distributor, coil, or magneto. There are dedicated spark <b>plug</b> wire pliers, tools designed for removing the terminal from a spark <b>plug</b> without damaging it.|$|R
5|$|Specifications for Mini-A and Mini-B {{plug and}} {{receptacle}}. Also receptacle that accepts both <b>plugs</b> for On-The-Go. These {{should not be}} confused with Micro-B plug and receptacle.|$|E
5|$|The Micro-AB {{receptacle}} {{is capable}} of accepting both Micro-A and Micro-B <b>plugs,</b> attached {{to any of the}} legal cables and adapters as defined in revision 1.01 of the Micro-USB specification.|$|E
5|$|USB cables exist {{with various}} {{combinations}} of <b>plugs</b> on {{each end of}} the cable, as displayed below in the USB cables matrix.|$|E
2500|$|The term <b>plug</b> is {{in general}} and {{technical}} use in all forms of English, common alternatives being power <b>plug,</b> electric <b>plug,</b> ...|$|R
5000|$|This <b>plug,</b> {{commonly}} called a 13 A <b>plug</b> or 13 amp <b>plug,</b> has three rectangular pins forming an isosceles triangle. The BS 1363 <b>plug</b> has a fuse which is suitably rated {{to protect the}} appliance's flexible cord from overload.|$|R
50|$|<b>Plug's</b> fellow Jūden-chan and rival, {{who becomes}} her supervisor. She is rather serious {{when it comes}} to work and is rather annoyed with how <b>Plug</b> is {{carrying}} out her job. In turn, <b>Plug</b> finds Allesta irritating for interfering with her work and the two girls tend to fight a lot. She sometimes ends up crying, which <b>Plug</b> uses as blackmail material. Compared to <b>Plug,</b> Allesta is rather busty, which causes <b>Plug</b> to tease her about that.|$|R
5|$|Fusible <b>plugs</b> are {{sometimes}} fitted to the receivers of air compressors {{as a precaution}} against the ignition of any lubricating oil vapour that might be present. Should {{the action of the}} compressor heat the air above a safe temperature the core will melt and release the pressure.|$|E
5|$|Mercury {{was used}} inside wobbler lures. Its heavy, liquid form made it useful since the lures made an {{attractive}} irregular movement when the mercury moved inside the plug. Such use was stopped due to environmental concerns, but illegal preparation of modern fishing <b>plugs</b> has occurred.|$|E
5|$|Similar to OATS, arthroscopic {{articular}} cartilage paste grafting is a surgical procedure offering cost-effective, long-lasting results for stage IV lesions. A bone and cartilage paste derived from crushed <b>plugs</b> of the non-weight-bearing intercondylar notch can achieve pain relief, repair damaged tissue, and restore function.|$|E
50|$|A rubber <b>plug</b> used to {{separate}} the cement slurry from other fluids, reducing contamination and maintaining predictable slurry performance. Two types of cementing <b>plug</b> are typically used on a cementing operation. The bottom <b>plug</b> is launched ahead of the cement slurry to minimize contamination by fluids inside the casing prior to cementing. A diaphragm in the <b>plug</b> body ruptures to allow the cement slurry to pass through after the <b>plug</b> reaches the landing collar. The top <b>plug</b> has a solid body that provides positive indication of contact with the landing collar and bottom <b>plug</b> through an increase in pump pressure.|$|R
40|$|Inexpensive self-expanding <b>plug</b> makes {{convenient}} low-pressure seal. Simple elastomeric <b>plug</b> seals round {{ports and}} holes better than regular cork. <b>Plug</b> is inserted with plastic tool that squeezes it to diameter smaller than port opening. Once tool is removed, <b>plug</b> self-expands {{to its original}} shape, exerting stronger pressure to sealed surface than cork. <b>Plug</b> is less expensive to make than screw-on or cam-expanded seals...|$|R
40|$|Lost {{circulation}} {{control in}} millimeter-wide fractures {{has been a}} challenge in well drilling all the time. Low pressure-bearing capacity of a <b>plugging</b> zone will result in excessive consumption of lost circulation materials (LCMs) and extra down time. In this study, laboratory experiments were conducted on the <b>plugging</b> of millimeter-wide fractures to evaluate the <b>plugging</b> effects {{of different types of}} LCM including rigid granules, elastic particles and fiber. Maximum <b>plugging</b> pressure, total loss volume before sealing and <b>plugging</b> time were taken as the evaluation index of the LCM <b>plugging</b> effect. According to the experimental results, the synergistic <b>plugging</b> mechanisms of different LCM combinations were also analyzed. Experimental results showed that the total loss volume of the <b>plugging</b> zone formed by rigid and elastic particle combination was generally greater than 400  mL, and the maximum <b>plugging</b> pressure of the <b>plugging</b> zone formed by elastic particle and fiber combination was generally less than 6  MPa. In contrast, the <b>plugging</b> zone formed by the combination of the three types of LCMs has the maximum <b>plugging</b> pressure of up to 13  MPa and total loss volume before sealing of 75  mL. In the synergistic <b>plugging</b> process, rigid granules form a frame with high pressure-bearing capacity in the narrower parts of the fractures; elastic particles generate elastic force through elastic deformation to increase the friction between a fracture and a <b>plugging</b> zone to make the <b>plugging</b> zone more stable; fibers filling in the pore space between the particles increase the tightness and integrity of the <b>plugging</b> zone. The experimental results can provide guidance for the optimal design of LCMs used in the field...|$|R
5|$|The data pins in the {{standard}} <b>plugs</b> are actually recessed in the plug compared to the outside power pins. This permits the power pins to connect first, preventing data errors by allowing the device to power up first and then establish the data connection. Also, some devices operate in different modes {{depending on whether the}} data connection is made.|$|E
5|$|The {{front and}} rear wheels are {{different}} sizes. Instead of a spare wheel, a roadside repair kit with a 12 volt electric compressor (<b>plugs</b> into cigarette lighter) {{and a bottle of}} repair fluid is located under the cushion of the rear passenger seat.|$|E
5|$|The {{ignition}} system {{consisted of two}} rear-mounted, crankshaft-driven magnetos, each supplying one {{of a pair of}} spark <b>plugs</b> fitted to each cylinder. This is common practise for aero engines, as it ensures continued operation {{in the case of a}} single magneto failure, and has the advantage of more efficient combustion over a single spark plug application.|$|E
50|$|<b>Plug</b> 1 & <b>Plug</b> 2 Present... First Serve is {{the eighth}} album from hip-hop group De La Soul members Kelvin Mercer (a.k.a. <b>Plug</b> 1), and David Jolicoeur (a.k.a. <b>Plug</b> 2), in {{collaboration}} with French DJ duo Chokolate and Khalid, released on April 3, 2012.|$|R
50|$|A USB 3.0 Standard-B {{receptacle}} accepts {{either a}} USB 3.0 Standard-B <b>plug</b> or a USB 2.0 Standard-B <b>plug.</b> Backward compatibility applies to connecting a USB 2.0 Standard-B <b>plug</b> into a USB 3.0 Standard-B receptacle. However, {{it is not}} possible to <b>plug</b> a USB 3.0 Standard-B <b>plug</b> into a USB 2.0 Standard-B receptacle, due to a physically larger connector. The Standard-B is used at the device side.|$|R
50|$|When the <b>plug</b> is conically tapered, the stem/handle is {{typically}} {{attached to the}} larger diameter end of the <b>plug.</b> <b>Plug</b> valves usually do not have bonnets but often have {{the end of the}} <b>plug</b> with the handle exposed or mostly exposed to the outside. In such cases, there is usually not much of a stem. The stem and handle often come in one piece, often a simple, approximately L-shaped handle attached {{to the end of the}} <b>plug.</b> The other end of the <b>plug</b> is often exposed to the outside of the valve too, but with a mechanism that retains the <b>plug</b> in the body.|$|R
