5|$|The US Post Office {{released}} the first <b>postage</b> stamp issue honoring Zachary Taylor on June 21, 1875, 25 {{years after his}} death. In 1938, Taylor would appear again on a US <b>Postage</b> stamp, this time on the 12-cent Presidential Issue of 1938. Taylor's last appearance (to date, 2010) on a US <b>postage</b> stamp occurred in 1986 when he was honored on the AMERIPEX presidential issue. After Washington, Jefferson, Jackson and Lincoln, Zachary Taylor was the fifth American president to appear on US <b>postage.</b>|$|E

5|$|Heavily {{influenced}} by {{the example of the}} British postal system, which issued its first stamp, the Penny Black, in 1840, the Belgian government supported the inauguration of a Belgian equivalent. Under the existing system, <b>postage</b> costs were paid by the receiver rather than the sender, which discouraged people from receiving, and therefore sending, letters. The idea of <b>postage</b> stamps, which would allow the sender to pay in advance, was officially sanctioned by Leopold I on the Loi apportant des modifications au régime des postes ("Law bringing modifications to the postal system") on 24 December 1847 while the radical liberal and future Prime Minister, Walthère Frère-Orban, served as Minister of Public Works. The debate on the reform of the <b>postage</b> in Belgium occurred {{at the same time as}} widespread <b>postage</b> reform, {{influenced by}} the British example, in France, Bavaria and elsewhere.|$|E
5|$|The {{design of}} the First Issue (<b>postage</b> currency) was {{directly}} based on Spinner’s original handmade examples. Some varieties even had perforated stamp-like edge. While not actually legal tender, <b>postage</b> currency could be exchanged for United States Notes in $5 lots and were receivable in payment of all dues to the United States, up to $5. Subsequent issues would no longer include images of stamps and were referred to as Fractional Currency. Despite the July 1862 legislation, <b>postage</b> stamps remained a form of currency until <b>postage</b> currency gained momentum {{in the spring of}} 1863. In 1863, Secretary Chase asked for a new fractional currency that was harder to counterfeit than the <b>postage</b> currency. The new fractional currency notes were different from the 1862 <b>postage</b> currency issues. They were more colorful with printing on the reverse, and several anti-counterfeiting measures were employed: experimental paper, adding surcharges, overprints, blue end paper, silk fibers, and watermarks to name a few. Fractional currency shields which had single sided specimens were sold to banks to provide a standard for comparison for detecting counterfeits. <b>Postage</b> and fractional currency remained in use until 1876, when Congress authorized the minting of fractional silver coins to redeem the outstanding fractional currency.|$|E

5|$|Treasurer of the United States Francis E. Spinner {{has been}} {{credited}} with finding {{the solution to the}} shortage of coinage: he created <b>postage</b> currency (which led into the use of Fractional currency). <b>Postage</b> (or postal) currency was the first of five issues of US Post Office fractional paper money printed in 5-cent, 10-cent, 25-cent, and 50-cent denominations and issued from 21 August 1862 through 27 May 1863. Spinner proposed using <b>postage</b> stamps, affixed to Treasury paper, with his signature on the bottom (see illustration below). Based on this initiative, Congress supported a temporary solution involving fractional currency and on 17 July 1862 President Lincoln signed the <b>Postage</b> Currency Bill into law. The intent, however, was not that stamps should be a circulating currency.|$|E

5|$|Postal {{stationery}} {{have been}} produced {{in the form of}} registered envelopes, postal cards, envelopes, letter cards, newspaper wrappers, airletters and telegram forms with different designs of impressed stamp applied to show that <b>postage</b> had been pre-paid. Except for limited early usage of previously issued British postal stationery, which were not overprinted like the <b>postage</b> stamps, all post-paid impressed stamps before 1984 were based on variations of a design showing the country's name in Irish, Éire, with appropriate values in text and numeral tablets centred around an Irish harp motif. This was initially superseded by a shamrock design that later became loosely based on the logo of wavy lines and the word POST used by An Post from 1984. An Post has also used some designs based on <b>postage</b> stamps as post-paid impressed stamps on Irish postal stationery.|$|E
