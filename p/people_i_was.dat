25|$|Well, it's {{not really}} a choice at all. It's just, you know, I started playing very young and from early on, the <b>people</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> {{listening}} to had some element of finger style. Probably the first guitarist I was emulating was Scotty Moore, when I was maybe 6 or 7. And he played with a pick, but he also used fingers. And {{a lot of the}} session players, like Chet Atkins, they played with fingers or a pick. Then I listened to a certain amount of light classical guitar playing. And of course later on, when the first wave of rock 'n' roll kind of fell away, folk music was very popular and very influential in my style. So it was really less of a choice than what I fell into. I use a pick occasionally. I certainly use it more in the studio when {{you want to get a}} certain tone. But it's just the way I came up. I wasn't taught. I just sort of figured things out on my own terms. I guess that was one of the ways that I became comfortable and it just kind of set in.|$|E
25|$|I {{was saved}} {{from the gas}} chambers, saved from Hitler. I spent several years in Nazi death camps. Besides {{the fact that they}} murdered my wife and 11 children, my mother, my sisters and my brother – of my whole family, some 150 <b>people,</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> the only one who survived – I {{witnessed}} their cruelty. I remember as if it were today how they shot me in the arm. I was afraid to go to the Nazi infirmary, though there were doctors there. I knew that if I went in, I'd never come out alive. … Despite my fear of the Nazis, I plucked a leaf from a tree and stuck it to my wound to stanch the bleeding. Then I cut a branch and tied it around the wound to hold it in place. With God's help, it healed in three days. Then I promised myself that if, with God's help, I got well and got out of there, away from those resha'im (wicked people), I would build a hospital in Eretz Yisrael where every human being would be cared for with dignity. And the basis of that hospital would be that the doctors and nurses would {{believe that there is a}} God in this world and that when they treat a patient, they are fulfilling the greatest mitzvah in the Torah.|$|E

500|$|Mike Marqusee {{has written}} at length on the {{conflicts}} in Dylan's life during this time, with its deepening alienation from his old folk-revival audience and clear-cut leftist causes. He {{suggests that the}} song is probably self-referential: [...] "The song only attains full poignancy when one realises it is sung, at least in part, to the singer himself: he's the one 'with no direction home. Dylan himself has noted that, after his motorcycle accident in 1966, he realized that [...] "when I used words like 'he' and 'it' and 'they,' and talking about other <b>people,</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> really talking about nobody but me." ...|$|E
500|$|In 1973, {{while still}} grieving {{the loss of}} her daughter, Rice took a {{previously}} written short story and turned it into her first novel, the bestselling Interview with the Vampire. She based her vampires on Gloria Holden's character in Dracula's Daughter: [...] "It established to me what vampires were—these elegant, tragic, sensitive <b>people.</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> really just going with that feeling when writing Interview With the Vampire. I didn't do a lot of research." [...] After completing the novel and following many rejections from publishers, Rice developed obsessive–compulsive disorder (OCD). She became obsessed with germs, thinking that she contaminated everything she touched, engaged in frequent and obsessive hand washing and obsessively checked locks on windows and doors. Of this period, Rice says, [...] "What you see when you're in that state is every single flaw in our hygiene and you can't control it and you go crazy." ...|$|E
500|$|Reaction to {{the episode}} by news media {{organizations}} was extremely negative and caused controversy, criticizing the episode for its portrayal of domestic violence. A. J. Hammer of Showbiz Tonight {{said of the}} episode, [...] "Like so many other <b>people,</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> just shocked by what I saw on Family Guy last night," [...] and continued, [...] "It was really just a depressing half hour of television." [...] In the same interview, Hammer asked television host Wendy Walsh of The Doctors about the storyline, to which she responded, [...] "The main theme of the show was about this poor 'stupid' woman who was too dumb to leave her relationship. And domestic violence is far more complicated than that. We're watching someone rationalize a domestic violence relationship {{and this is the}} kind of thought process that actually goes on in real life. It’s not satire anymore." ...|$|E

500|$|In 1999, William Broyles, Jr. {{turned down}} the chance to write the script, but decided to sign on [...] "when I found out I could have an {{extensive}} amount of creative control". Fox projected the release date for July 2001, while Broyles sent the studio an outline and a chronicle of the fictional planet [...] "Aschlar". Entitled The Visitor and billed as [...] "episode one in the Chronicles of Aschlar", Broyles' script {{caught the attention of}} director Tim Burton, who was hired in February 2000. [...] "I wasn't interested in doing a remake or a sequel of the original Planet of the Apes film," [...] Burton said later. [...] "But I was intrigued by the idea of revisiting that world. Like a lot of <b>people,</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> affected by the original film. I wanted to do a 're-imagining'." [...] Richard D. Zanuck signed on as producer in March. [...] "This is a very emotional film for me. I greenlighted the original Apes when I was the head of Fox in 1967." ...|$|E
500|$|Another myth {{concerns}} Saul Bass, {{the graphic}} designer who created {{many of the}} title sequences of Hitchcock's films and storyboarded some of Psychos scenes, claiming he had directed the shower scene. This was refuted by several figures associated with the film, including Leigh, who stated: [...] "absolutely not! I have emphatically said this in any interview I've ever given. I've said it to his face in front of other <b>people...</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> in that shower for seven days, and, believe me, Alfred Hitchcock was right next to his camera {{for every one of}} those seventy-odd shots." [...] Hilton A. Green, the assistant director, also refutes Bass' claim: [...] "There is not a shot in that movie that I didn't roll the camera for. And I can tell you I never rolled the camera for Mr. Bass." [...] Roger Ebert, a longtime admirer of Hitchcock's work, summarily dismissed the rumor, stating, [...] "It seems unlikely that a perfectionist with an ego like Hitchcock's would let someone else direct such a scene." ...|$|E
500|$|Breakaways {{critical}} acclaim also enabled Clarkson to also earn critical respect, {{particularly from the}} rock and indie music scene, who had looked down upon American Idol contestants. In his memoir, Davis recalled a meeting with Simon Fuller and Sony BMG President Charles Goldstuck, where Fuller acknowledged how the worldwide success of Breakaway had validated American Idol itself. The popularity of [...] "Since U Been Gone" [...] among the rock community also resulted in various cover versions by rock acts, such as A Day to Remember, Ted Leo, and Tokyo Police Club. Clarkson herself recalled, [...] "It's ridiculous how well that song was received by hard rockers, by indie <b>people.</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> walking around {{with a friend of}} mine and this hard-rock guy {{came up to me and}} was like, 'I look stupid, but I tell my friends I love this song.' People at concerts are like, 'That's my guilty pleasure. I don't mean to be mean, but I didn't want to like the American Idol girl.' But they love that song, and it kind of won them over." ...|$|E

500|$|The {{track that}} {{underwent}} {{the most extensive}} change was [...] "I Miss You", an old song from the Debut era, {{the result of the}} input of Howie Bernstein (a protégé of Hooper and an aspiring programmer), who gave the song its [...] "Latin-tinged [...] ". Back in London, Björk contacted [...] "old standby" [...] Talvin Singh to record additional percussion parts for it. Fellow former Sugarcubes member Einar Örn Benediktsson was also contacted to play the trumpet on [...] "Enjoy". Renowned English sessionist Gary Barnacle was enlisted to play the saxophone. Although he had not been involved in music for a long time, Brazilian composer Eumir Deodato immediately agreed to participate on the album at Björk's request. The singer decided to contact him after being impressed by his arrangements of a rare Milton Nascimento song called [...] "Travessia". Deodato's presence as composer and conductor [...] "immediately bolstered" [...] "Hyperballad", [...] "You've Been Flirting Again" [...] and [...] "Isobel". This addition of strings, brass and percussion elements gave Post the balance Björk felt her original recordings had lacked. By the time the album was finished in April 1995, the list of co-producers included: Björk, Hooper, Bernstein, Massey, and Tricky. Björk has said: [...] "The people I collaborated with were all <b>people</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> hanging out with in clubs in London. I had known them all for a while before we ended up working together." ...|$|E

2500|$|The film also sparked {{negative}} reactions {{because of its}} content. [...] "A lot of people got freaked out", says Bakshi. [...] "The people {{in charge of the}} power structure, the people in charge of magazines and the people going to work in the morning who loved Disney and Norman Rockwell, thought I was a pornographer, and they made things very difficult for me.

But being a sucker for Halloween-themed episodes, I tuned into Fox's [...] "Animation Domination" [...] comedy block last night. What I saw was seriously awful."

[...] He was inspired to write his first novel, Hear the Wind Sing (1979), while watching a baseball game. In 1978, Murakami was in Jingu Stadium watching a game between the Yakult Swallows and the Hiroshima Carp when Dave Hilton, an American, came to bat. According to an oft-repeated story, in the instant that Hilton hit a double, Murakami suddenly realized that he could write a novel. He went home and began writing that night. Murakami worked on Hear the Wind Sing for ten months in very brief stretches after working days at the bar. He completed the novel and sent it to the only literary contest that would accept a work of that length, winning first prize.|$|E
