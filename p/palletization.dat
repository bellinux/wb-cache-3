40|$|The <b>palletization</b> problem {{involves}} interlocking {{boxes on}} a pallet. There are two approaches {{dealing with the}} solution to this problem: mathematical and heuristic. Three models are proposed in the thesis. Model 1 is an Integer Linear Programming (ILP) model dealing with boxes with different lengths and widths but same height. Model 2 provides systematic procedures for 3 D <b>palletization</b> problems by combining the ILP Model 1 and rules of thumb. Model 3 employs a heuristic, in which the main emphasis is on the random sequence of boxes. All three models are capable of performing multi-layer <b>palletization.</b> The pallet utilization, Work-In-Process (WIP), loading stability and <b>palletization</b> time are used as performance measures. Model 3 is implemented in a physical Robotic <b>Palletization</b> System (RPS) through a "C" program which integrates the subsystems consisting of a vision, a conveyor and a robot...|$|E
40|$|The {{focus of}} this paper is on the {{physical}} aspect of the robotic <b>palletization</b> of multiple box sizes. Three algorithms were developed to cope with three different types of <b>palletization</b> problems. They are boxes of uniform height, boxes grouped by similar height, and boxes of different heights. A robot sequence program, {{with the aid of a}} vision system and a conveyor system, has been developed to implement the first algorithm and to carry out the loading process. The main objectives of this study are to reduce both the work in process area and the <b>palletization</b> time, and to maximize the space used on the pallet. Practical limitations are set and reflected in the algorithm. The results of this study are presented and compared with other results from existing algorithms.

40|$|A {{new method}} for the on-substrate fine {{positioning}} of micro/meso-scale discrete components is proposed, where component positions are finely adjusted using micro linear sliders and fixtures on the substrate. Each micro linear slider is actuated by vibratory impacts exerted by {{two pairs of}} micro cantilever impacters.

An array of the prototype externally-resonated linear micro vibrometers is fabricated using the MCNC MUMPS service. These prototypes are tested for forward and backward motion via external vibration applied by a piezoelectric stack vibrator.

40|$|Timed event graphs (TEGs) are {{suitable}} to model manufacturing systems in which synchronization and delay phenomena appear. Since 1980 s, TEGs are studied {{as a class}} of linear discrete event systems in idempotent semirings such as the (min,+) algebra. In this paper, we consider the class of weighted TEGs (WTEGs) that corresponds to TEGs where the edges have integer weights. By introducing nonunitary weights, WTEGs widen the class of manufacturing systems that can be modeled, especially systems with batches and duplications. Moreover, a subclass of WTEGs called weight-balanced TEGs (WB-TEGs) can be studied with the algebraic tools that stem from the theory of (min,+) linear systems. In this paper, the focus lies on some modeling issues for manufacturing systems. Besides cutting and <b>palletization</b> operations, it is shown that WB-TEGs are also well adapted to describe periodic routing policies and, in a symmetrical way, how to merge flows similar to a multiplexer. In order to simplify the modeling step, a class of cycloweighted TEGs (CW-TEGs) is introduced. It {{is an extension of}} WTEGs where the weights of the edges can change according to a periodic sequence. Finally, we propose some elements of modeling that can be described by CW-TEGs or equivalently with an input-output transfer relation in an appropriate idempotent semiring of operators...|$|E
40|$|The {{decision-making}} process {{is one of}} the complicated processes involved in warehouse operation for efficiently fulfilling various specific customer orders. This is especially true if the orders require cross-border delivery activities, such as <b>palletization</b> of the delivery goods according to regulation requirements. Case-based reasoning is an intelligent method for complex problem solving that uses past cases to find a solution to new problems. To achieve an appropriate solution, retrieving useful prior cases effectively for the problem is essential. However, current case retrieval methods are mainly based on a fixed set of attributes for different type of orders in which specific order features for case groups are neglected. In this paper a hybrid approach called the case-genetic algorithm-based decision support model (C-GADS), is proposed in classifying new customer orders into case groups with the highest similarity value, allowing for effectively selecting the most similar cases among the group. The proposed model also suggests the types of features considered in each case group. It helps enhance the effectiveness of formulating warehouse order operations based on grouping similar cases. To validate the feasibility of the proposed model, a case study is conducted and the results show that planning effectiveness is enhanced. Department of Industrial and Systems Engineerin...|$|E
40|$|Today’s {{competitive}} environment has forced companies to rethink {{and come up}} with strategies for cost minimization. Logistics accounts for {{a significant part of the}} total costs in a manufacturing company, thus leaving room for major reductions through re-engineering of logistics processes. In logistics, packaging has become an important focus area where there are opportunities to increase efficiency and reduce costs associated with logistics. Furthermore, pallet configurations have always been an area of concern for various industries. Packing boxes onto pallets, i. e. <b>palletization,</b> consists of arranging different products that are packed in boxes onto pallets in the most efficient way. An efficient <b>palletization</b> system has many advantages such as cost reduction of transportation and inventory, reduced loading and unloading operation times, and facilitation of freight handling. A minor increase in the number of products loaded on the pallet may lead to significant savings. The purpose of this study has been to assess and evaluate McNeil AB’s packaging system focusing mainly on the pallet configurations and the impact these have on various logistical activities. McNeil AB, a Johnson & Johnson company, is a world leading organization in smoking cessation products, with the Nicorette brand recognized globally. The Nicorette products come in different forms, such as gums, inhalers, lozenges and nasal sprays. In order to achieve the objectives of the study, the boxes and the pallet configurations of the company have been reviewed and analyzed from a packaging logistics point of view. The analysis has resulted in a set of modified boxes and pallet reconfigurations to improve efficiency. In fact, eight boxes have been modified and given new dimensions based on the optimal pallet configuration. Also, of the total 52 pallet configurations that exist within the company, 36 have been modified with either new layers, modified boxes or modified pallet configuration. These new modified pallet configurations do not only result in an improved external filling rate but also in pallet loads that are more secure and stable. The reconfigurations have led to the fact that the external filling rate of the pallet loads has improved by 24, 5 %, going from an average external filling rate of 66, 5 % to 82, 8 %. To evaluate the impact of the changes that have been made, a cost analysis has been carried out to determine the savings of the proposed modifications. The cost analysis has been based on transportation, warehousing and pallet costs. With the proposed modified boxes and pallet reconfigurations, annual savings of approximately 1 MSEK can be achieved. Other benefits with the proposed boxes and pallet configurations are increased product safety, less pallets to handle and lower environmental impact, all of which lead to a more efficient logistics flow.
