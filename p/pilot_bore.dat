Isaac subcontracted the construction work to John Waddell & Sons of Edinburgh who appointed James Brunlees and Charles Douglas Fox, eldest son of Sir Charles Fox, as engineers in chief. Two shafts were dug in the grounds of the Mersey Docks and Harbour Board for the pilot tunnel - one in Birkenhead with a diameter of 17 ft and the other in Liverpool of diameter 15 ft.

Before the tunnel was dedicated, it was renamed to honor Dwight D. Eisenhower and Edwin C. Johnson. Construction on the first bore of the tunnel was started on March 15, 1968. Construction efforts suffered many setbacks and the project went well over time and budget. One of the biggest setbacks was the discovery of fault lines {{in the path of the}} tunnel that were not discovered during the <b>pilot</b> <b>bores.</b> These faults began to slip during construction and emergency measures had to be taken to protect the tunnels and workers from cave-ins and collapses.

2500|$|Initial {{geological}} investigation occurred from 1946 to 1963, {{which involved}} drilling the sea-bed, sonic surveys, submarine boring, observations using a mini-submarine, and seismic and magnetic surveys. To establish a greater understanding, a horizontal <b>pilot</b> <b>boring</b> was undertaken {{along the line}} of the service and main tunnels. Tunnelling occurred simultaneously from the northern end and the southern. The dry land portions were tackled with traditional mountain tunnelling techniques, with a single main tunnel. However, for the 23.3-kilometre undersea portion, three bores were excavated with increasing diameters respectively: an initial pilot tunnel, a service tunnel, and finally the main tunnel. The service tunnel was periodically connected to the main tunnel with a series of connecting shafts, at 600- to 1,000-metre intervals. The pilot tunnel serves as the service tunnel for the central five-kilometre portion. Beneath the Tsugaru Strait, the use of a tunnel boring machine (TBM) was abandoned after less than two kilometres (...) owing to the variable nature of the rock and difficulty in accessing the face for advanced grouting. Blasting with dynamite and mechanical picking were then used to excavate.|$|R
40|$|Introduction The {{direction}} of mining development over the last 30 years has been toward the use of larger and more powerful equipment. This direction is, to a degree, controlled {{by the need to}} penetrate and extract rock over as wide a range of compressive strengths as possible. An illustration of the success of this approach has, for example, recently been given by the raising of the ventilation shaft at the Kloof Gold Mine (Ref. 1). In that bore, which exceeded 1, 100 m in length, the drilling and raise boring heads had to penetrate rock of up to 550 MPa uniaxial compressive strength, and were able to do this, for the <b>pilot</b> <b>bore</b> at a rate of 1 m. /hour, and with the main bore at an average rate of 54 m/month. However, to achieve this rate, loads of up to 20 tons/cutter had to be applied to the tool, and the wear rate of these tools was a significant cost item. The problems with this approach, are twofold.

40|$|Trenchless {{technologies}} are methods {{used for the}} construction and rehabilitation of underground utility pipes. These methods are growing increasingly popular due to their versatility and their potential to lower project costs. However, the use of trenchless technologies in Iowa and their effects on surrounding soil and nearby structures has not been adequately documented. Surveys of and interviews with professionals working in trenchless-related industries in Iowa were conducted, {{and the results were}} analyzed and compared to survey results from the United States as a whole. The surveys focused on method familiarity, pavement distress observed, reliability of trenchless methods, and future improvements. Results indicate that the frequency of pavement distress or other trenchless-related issues are an ongoing problem in the industry. Inadequate soil information and quality control/quality assurance (QC/QA) are partially to blame. Fieldwork involving the observation of trenchless construction projects was undertaken with the purpose of documenting current practices and applications of trenchless technology in the United States and Iowa. Field tests were performed in which push-in pressure cells were used to measure the soil stresses induced by trenchless construction methods. A program of laboratory soil testing was carried out in conjunction with the field testing. Soil testing showed that the installations were made in sandy clay or well-graded sand with silt and gravel. Pipes were installed primarily using horizontal directional drilling with pipe diameters from 3 to 12 inches. Pressure cell monitoring was conducted during the following construction phases: <b>pilot</b> <b>bore,</b> pre-reaming, and combined pipe pulling and reaming. The greatest increase in lateral earth pressure was 5. 6 psi and was detected 2. 1 feet from the centerline of the bore during a pilot hole operation in sandy lean clay. Measurements from 1. 0 to 2. 5 psi were common. Comparisons were made between field measurements and analytical and finite element calculation methods...|$|E
40|$|AbstractConcept of {{converting}} coal in-situ into gas {{has existed for}} many years. Basically it involves drilling a pair of wells into a coal seam and injecting gasifying agent like oxygen or air and steam through the Injector and after ignition and gasification of coal, the gas is brought to the surface through the other hole (Producer) and used as fuel or chemical feedstock. The first experimental work {{can be traced back}} to 1912 when William Ramsey began work in Durham, U. K. Intensive coal gasification work began in the then USSR in 1930 s at a shallower depth. This led to industrial scale projects in several parts particularly in Russia and Uzbekistan. One project of Uzbekistan is still operational. These trials established the basic technology of UCG. There was a renewed interest in UCG in Western Europe in view of energy shortage in 1944 - 1959. Borehole method was tested in Newmann Spinney and Bayton in U. K. This could not be sustained for long as during 1960 s, low cost fuel was available in plenty and therefore there was a period of lull on the progress of UCG in Europe. Oil/gas price and supply have dictated the pace of progress in UCG. After the first oil crisis, USA again embarked on the development of UCG in 1972 and continued in 1980 s, involving in the process a number of institutes and agencies. This led to considerable technological development. There were concerns on environmental pollution which the trial raised. It was thought appropriate to test the application of technological developments that had taken placed in oil and gas industry in UCG. In 1990 s deviation and in seam drilling was tried in “Al Tremidal” in Spain. The trial was successful and it proved the viability of directional drilling and benefits of CRIP technology (Controlled Retractable and Injection Point). As a result of Spanish trial, Department of Trade and Industry Technology (DTI), U. K., emphasized growing importance of UCG as clean coal technology. In its report of 2004 on the Review of Feasibility of UCG in U. K., UCG has been identified as an additional source for energy security within the context of a low carbon economy, if planning and environmental issues can be dealt with. China has carried out 16 field trials since 1980 s and has involved a number of agencies in order to address various issues in a comprehensive manner. Technology transfer agreement was executed with DTI-UK and a UCG Centre has been created in China University of Mining and Technology. Attempts are also being made in China to carry out gasification at deeper depths. Recently Australia has carried out a successful trial in Chinchila involving several agencies like Sydney University, Ergo Energy, Linc Energy, GE etc. Japan has overseas coal interests and has involved University of Tokyo for experimental studies. New Zealand carried out a small trial in 1994 with the help of USA. Other countries like Pakistan, Ukraine and Romania are also interested in UCG. In India, a beginning was made in UCG in 1980 s. Two <b>pilot</b> <b>bore</b> holes were drilled north of Mehsana town of Gujarat to see the suitability of application of UCG technique. However, further study on the subject has not been made since then. Recently there has been a surge of interest in UCG and as a consequence ONGC has signed an agreement with Skochinsky Institute of Mining (SIM), Russia. MOUs are also being executed with other coal/lignite based companies like Coal India Ltd, Gujarat Mineral Development Corporation Ltd, Gujarat Industries Power Corporation Ltd., Neveli Lignite Corporation Ltd., etc. The paper attempts to highlight continuous worldwide efforts for technological development for harnessing coal through in-situ gasification. The technology assumes all the more significance in view of limited resources of oil/gas and abundance of mineable and un-mineable coals...|$|E

The frustration prompted one engineer to comment, [...] "We were going by the book, but the damned mountain couldn't read". The first bore was dedicated March 8, 1973. Initially this tunnel was used for two-way traffic, with one lane for each direction. The amount of traffic through the tunnel exceeded predictions, and efforts soon began to expedite construction on the second tube (the Johnson bore), which was finished on December 21, 1979. The initial engineering cost estimate for the Eisenhower bore was $42 million; the actual cost was $108 million (equivalent to $ million today). Approximately 90% of the funds were paid by the federal government, with the state of Colorado paying the rest. At the time, this figure set a record for the most expensive federally aided project. The excavation cost for the Johnson bore was $102.8 million (equivalent to $ million today).|$|R
