5|$|Despite {{the aim of}} the NCMP {{scheme to}} {{ameliorate}} the impacts of the first-past-the-post system, its legitimacy is highly doubted. It is based neither on a clear electoral mandate like ordinary MPs, nor on expertise or specialization (as in the case of NMPs). As a result, the <b>privileges</b> <b>of</b> NCMPs are severely curtailed and this limits their effectiveness as alternative voices in Parliament.|$|E
5|$|One of the <b>privileges</b> <b>of</b> U.S. {{citizenship}} {{is the opportunity}} to become a commissioned officer in the Marine Corps. When there is a draft, a non-citizen can be drafted as a resident alien, or can join in the ranks as a foreigner, but cannot be an officer without U.S. citizenship.|$|E
5|$|The Peerage Act 1963 allowed all Scottish {{peers to}} sit in the House of Lords; it also {{permitted}} all Irish peers {{to sit in}} the House of Commons for any constituency in the United Kingdom, as well as to vote in parliamentary elections, without being deprived of the remaining <b>privileges</b> <b>of</b> peerage.|$|E

5|$|The <b>privileges</b> <b>of</b> the Hasekura {{family were}} {{abolished}} {{at this point}} by the Sendai fief, and their property and belongings seized. It is at this time, in 1640, that Hasekura's Christian artifacts were confiscated, and they were kept in custody in Sendai until they were rediscovered {{at the end of}} the 19th century.|$|E
5|$|Due to his wartime experiences, Frederick William was {{convinced}} that Brandenburg-Prussia would only prevail with a standing army. Traditionally, raising and financing army reserves was a privilege of the estates, yet Frederick William envisioned a standing army financed independently of the estates. He succeeded in getting the consent and necessary financial contributions of the estates in a landtag decree of 26 July 1653. In turn, he confirmed several <b>privileges</b> <b>of</b> the knights, including tax exemption, assertion of jurisdiction and police powers on their estates (Patrimonialgerichtsbarkeit) and the upholding of serfdom (Leibeigenschaft, Bauernlegen).|$|E
5|$|In 1529 {{the king}} summoned Parliament {{to deal with}} annulment, thus {{bringing}} together those who wanted reform but who disagreed what form it should take; it {{became known as the}} Reformation Parliament. There were Common lawyers who resented the <b>privileges</b> <b>of</b> the clergy to summon laity to their courts; there were those who had been influenced by Lutheran evangelicalism and were hostile to the theology of Rome; Thomas Cromwell was both. Henry's Chancellor, Thomas More, successor to Wolsey, also wanted reform: he wanted new laws against heresy.|$|E

25|$|As {{the knights}} (later, nobles - the szlachta class) started to acquire <b>privileges,</b> some <b>of</b> them {{began to change}} the way that the pospolite ruszenie functioned. The length of the service was set at two weeks. The <b>Privilege</b> <b>of</b> Buda of 1355 {{required}} the king to compensate any losses incurred by the nobles in wars abroad, and the <b>Privilege</b> <b>of</b> Koszyce of 1374 required him to pay the ransom for any nobles taken into captivity during wars abroad. A <b>privilege</b> <b>of</b> 1388 extended that compensation for losses incurred when defending the country and confirmed that the nobles were to receive a monetary wage for their participation and that they should be consulted with by the king beforehand.|$|R

5|$|The Emperors Hadrian, Septimius Severus and Constantius I all held {{court in}} York during their various campaigns. During his stay 207–211AD, the Emperor Severus proclaimed York {{capital of the}} {{province}} of Britannia Inferior, {{and it is likely}} that it was he who granted York the <b>privileges</b> <b>of</b> a colonia or city. Constantius I died in 306AD during his stay in York, and his son Constantine the Great was proclaimed Emperor by the troops based in the fortress. In 311AD a bishop from York attended the Council at Arles to represent Christians from the province.|$|E

5|$|The case {{received}} extensive {{attention in}} the Japanese media, especially in Okinawa, and the crime sparked a public debate over the U.S. military presence in Japan, the <b>privileges</b> <b>of</b> extraterritoriality, {{as well as the}} fair trial practices of Japanese legal system and the Japanese police. The case involved the Treaty of Mutual Cooperation and Security between the United States and Japan and the U.S.–Japan Status of Forces Agreement (SOFA).|$|E
5|$|The <b>privilege</b> <b>of</b> {{access is}} no longer exercised, but it is {{possibly}} still retained by peers whether members of the House of Lords or not.

5|$|The {{son of a}} {{prominent}} Isle of Man family with strong naval connections, Heywood joined Bounty under Lieutenant William Bligh {{at the age of}} 15 and, although unranked was given the <b>privileges</b> <b>of</b> a junior officer. Bounty left England in 1787 on a mission to collect and transport breadfruit from the Pacific, and arrived in Tahiti late in 1788. Relations between Bligh and certain of his officers, notably Fletcher Christian, became strained, and worsened during the five months that Bounty remained in Tahiti.|$|E
5|$|Unique to Article 14(2)(a) is an {{addendum}} {{stating that}} the right to freedom of speech and expression may be curtailed by restrictions designed to protect the <b>privileges</b> <b>of</b> Parliament, or to provide against contempt of court, defamation or incitement to any offence. The Constitution does not require Parliament to show that is necessary or expedient to restrict free speech in the interest of these grounds.|$|E
5|$|A Non-constituency Member of Parliament (NCMP) is {{a member}} of a Singaporean {{opposition}} political party who, according to the Constitution and Parliamentary Elections Act, is declared to have been elected a Member of the Parliament of Singapore despite having lost in a general election by virtue of having been one of the best-performing losers. NCMPs enjoy most of the <b>privileges</b> <b>of</b> ordinary Members of Parliament. They are, however, not allowed to vote on several types of bills such as bills to amend the Constitution and motions of no confidence in the Government. An election candidate who has been offered an NCMP seat may decline to take it up.|$|E

5|$|Although Mariano Moreno was a criollo, a Spanish citizen {{born in the}} Americas, he did {{not work}} with the other criollos of Buenos Aires who sought to promote {{political}} changes against the <b>privileges</b> <b>of</b> the Spanish-born. Unlike the criollo politicians Manuel Belgrano and Juan José Castelli, he did not support viceroy Liniers or the Carlotist project, which sought the coronation of Carlota of Spain in the Americas. He joined mayor Martín de Álzaga instead, which allowed him to serve as legal adviser of the Cabildo. In that capacity, he wrote a petition to the King of Spain, so that the Buenos Aires Cabildo was named Protector of the Cabildos of the Viceroyalty of the Río de la Plata. As a result, all petitions from local cabildos to the King or the Viceroy would be channeled through the Cabildo at the capital.|$|E
5|$|Barley's {{relationship}} with Morley was short-lived. By 1600, Morley {{had turned to}} East as his assignee, authorising him to print under his name for three years. Two years later, Morley died, and his music patent fell into abeyance. Unable {{to rely on the}} protections and <b>privileges</b> <b>of</b> Morley's monopoly, Barley most likely came under increasing pressure from the Stationers' Company. His financial circumstances also deteriorated after he was the target of a successful lawsuit by a cook named George Goodale, who was seeking payment of a debt of 80 pounds. As a result of the suit, many of Barley's goods were seized, including various books and reams of paper. Barley greatly reduced his output from 1601 to 1605, publishing only six works.|$|E
5|$|Being {{the last}} male {{member of the}} House of Árpád, Andrew was elected king {{after the death of}} King Ladislaus IV in 1290. He was the first Hungarian monarch to issue a {{coronation}} diploma confirming the <b>privileges</b> <b>of</b> the noblemen and the clergy. At least three pretenders—Albert of Austria, Mary of Hungary, and an adventurer—challenged his claim to the throne. Andrew expelled the adventurer from Hungary and forced Albert of Austria to conclude a peace within a year, but Mary of Hungary and her descendants did not renounce their claim. The Hungarian bishops and Andrew's maternal family from Venice were his principal supporters, but the leading Croatian and Slavonian lords were opposed to his rule.|$|E
40|$|The paper {{analyzes}} the <b>privilege</b> <b>of</b> sanctuary in English criminal law between the 13 th and 16 th centuries. The general <b>privilege</b> <b>of</b> sanctuary belonged to all churches, chapels and churchyards. Any felon {{who had taken}} sanctuary could remain there for forty days. During that time he had to declare to the coroner whether he would stand trial or abjure the realm. If he chose the latter, he then had to confess his guilt before the coroner, swear {{to leave the country}} and never return without the king’s license. He was assigned the nearest port from which he should leave the country. If, during this forty days <b>privilege</b> <b>of</b> sanctuary, or while he was en route to the seaside, he was arrested and arraigned, he might plead the <b>privilege</b> <b>of</b> sanctuary. The private sanctuaries, created by a grant either from the Pope or from the king, usually imposed no time limit and gave protection for life. The sanctuary, therefore, {{could be used as a}} convenient base for planning criminal activities. No doubt, the <b>privilege</b> <b>of</b> sanctuary was frequently abused. As a result, judges became more hostile to the plea of sanctuary and in 1534 the privilege was taken away from all traitors. Sanctuary and abjuration disappeared in the Tudor period. In 1624, it was enacted that no sanctuary or <b>privilege</b> <b>of</b> sanctuary be hereafter admitted or allowed in any case...|$|R

5|$|Democracy {{essentially}} means {{rule of the}} people. To build {{a democratic}} society and rule, there must be citizen participation by an informed electorate. The freedom to speak and express is thus crucial {{for the formation of}} public opinion on political questions, and is indispensable to the discovery and spread of political truth. In Singapore, the right to freedom of speech and expression is guaranteed to citizens by Article 14(1)(a) of the Constitution, though it is subject to many qualifications. Parliament may by law impose restrictions on the right as it considers necessary or expedient {{in the interest of the}} security of Singapore, friendly relations with other countries, public order or morality, and restrictions designed to protect the <b>privileges</b> <b>of</b> Parliament or to provide against contempt of court, defamation or incitement to any offence.|$|E
5|$|Emir Sanjar al-Jawli {{acquired}} the governorship of Gaza and central Palestine in 1311. He highly favored Gaza and transformed {{it into a}} flourishing city, having built in it a horse-race course, a madrasa (college), a mosque, a khan (caravansary), a maristan (hospital), and a castle. In late 1332, coinciding with the appointment of Emir Taynal al-Ashrafi as governor, some of the provincial <b>privileges</b> <b>of</b> Gaza, such as the governor's direct subordination to the sultan in Cairo, were removed by an-Nasir Muhammad's decree. From then, and until 1341 when Sanjar al-Jawli served a second term as governor, Gaza became subordinate to the na'ib as-saltana (viceroy) of Syria, Emir Tankiz al-Husami.|$|E
5|$|In 1228, Andrew {{authorized}} his son, Béla, {{to revise}} his previous land grants. Pope Honorius also supported Béla's efforts. Béla confiscated {{the domains of}} two noblemen, Simon Kacsics and Bánk Bár-Kalán, who had taken part in the conspiracy to murder Queen Gertrude. In 1229, upon Béla's proposal, Andrew confirmed the <b>privileges</b> <b>of</b> the Cuman chieftains who had subjected themselves to Béla. Robert, Archbishop of Esztergom, made a complaint about Andrew to the Holy See, because Andrew continued to employ Jews and Muslims. Pope Gregory IX authorized the archbishop to perform acts of religious censure to persuade Andrew to dismiss his non-Christian officials. Under duress, Andrew issued a new Golden Bull in 1231, which confirmed that Muslims were banned from employment, and empowered the Archbishop of Esztergom to excommunicate the king if he failed to honor {{the provisions of the}} new Golden Bull. In {{the second half of the}} year, Andrew invaded Halych and restored his youngest son, Andrew, to the throne.|$|E
