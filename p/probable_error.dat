40|$|Maintaining {{acceptable}} {{indoor air}} quality (IAQ) has become a public issue, policymakers have had developed strategies to address the performance of it. Pollutant concentrations measured during the occupied period of a space is a key parameter to determine IAQ. Apart {{from a number of}} sampling schemes concerning the measurement time of the average pollutant level, an 8 -hour continuous measurement has been widely adopted in local IAQ assessments, with a balance of accuracy and measurement effort. It is believed that the longer the measurement time, the higher the accuracy and confidence level of the measurement can be achieved. However, the <b>probable</b> <b>errors</b> of the measurement regarding the measurement periods were not addressed clearly in those assessments. This study, taking a long-term carbon dioxide (CO 2) measurement in a typical open-plan office building as a reference, develops a database to examine the <b>probable</b> <b>errors</b> of different sampling schemes.

6000|$|The same {{familiar}} patterns recur {{in every}} large collection of finger prints, and the eye soon selects {{what appear to}} be typical forms; but are they truly [...] "typical" [...] or not? By a type I understand an ideal form around which the actual forms are grouped, very closely in its immediate neighbourhood, and becoming more rare with increasing rapidity at an increasing distance from it, just {{as is the case with}} shot marks to the right or left of a line drawn vertically through the bull's eye of a target. The analogy is exact; in both cases there is a well-defined point of departure; in both cases the departure of individual instances from that point is due to a multitude of independently variable causes. In short, both are realisations of the now well-known theoretical law of Frequency of Error. The problem then is this:--take some one of the well-marked patterns, such as it appears on a particular digit,--say a loop on the right thumb; find the average number of ridges that cross a specified portion of it; then this average value will determine an ideal centre from which individual departures may be measured; next, tabulate the frequency of the departures that attain to each of many successive specified distances from that ideal centre; then see whether their diminishing frequency as the distances increase, is or is not in accordance with the law of frequency of error. If it is, then the central form has the attributes of a true type, and such will be shown to be the case with the loops of either thumb. I shall only give the data and the results, not the precise way in which they are worked out, because an account of the method employed in similar cases will be found in Natural Inheritance, and again in the Memoir on Finger Prints in the Phil. Trans.; it is too technical to be appropriate here, and would occupy too much space. The only point which need be briefly explained and of which non-mathematical readers might be ignorant, is how a single numerical table derived from abstract calculations can be made to apply to such minute objects as finger prints, as well as to the shot marks on a huge target; what is the common unit by which departures on such different scales are measured? The answer is that it is a self-contained unit appropriate to each series severally, and technically called the <b>Probable</b> <b>Error,</b> or more briefly, P.E., in the headings to the following tables. In order to determine it, the range of the central half of the series has to be measured, namely, of that part of the series which remains after its two extreme quarters have been cut off and removed. The series had no limitation before, its two ends tailing away indefinitely into nothingness, but, by the artifice of lopping off a definite fraction of the whole series from both ends of it, a sharply-defined length, call it PQ, is obtained. Such series as have usually to be dealt with are fairly symmetrical, so the position of the half-way point M, between P and Q, corresponds with rough accuracy to the average of the positions of all the members of the series, that is to the point whence departures have to be measured. MP, or MQ,--or still better, 1/2(MP + MQ) is the above-mentioned <b>Probable</b> <b>Error.</b> It is so called because the amount of Error, or Departure from M of any one observation, falls just as often within the distance PE as it falls without it. In the calculated tables of the Law of Frequency, PE (or a multiple of it) is taken as unity. In each observed series, the actual measures have to be converted into another scale, in which the PE of that series is taken as unity. Then observation and calculation may be compared on equal terms.|$|E

50|$|In {{addition}} to analysis of variance, Fisher named and promoted {{the method of}} maximum likelihood estimation.

Fisher stated that deviations exceeding twice the standard deviation are regarded as significant. Before this deviations exceeding three times the <b>probable</b> <b>error</b> were considered significant. For a symmetrical distribution the <b>probable</b> <b>error</b> is half the interquartile range.

The primary focus is on two kinds of gene-roles: (1) the chromosomal locations of genes, and (2) the biological processes in which genes plays a role. Regarding chromosomal locations, the discrepancies revealed are striking and systematic, suggesting a structurally common origin. In regard to the biological processes, difficulties arise because genes frequently play roles in multiple processes, and processes may have many designations (such as synonymous terms). Our algorithms make use of the roles defined in the NCIT Biological Process hierarchy to uncover many <b>probable</b> gene-role <b>errors</b> in the NCIT.
