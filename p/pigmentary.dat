25|$|Kearns–Sayre {{syndrome}} {{is characterized by}} onset before 15 years of age of CPEO, heart block and <b>pigmentary</b> retinopathy.|$|E
25|$|It is {{important}} to have a dilated eye exam to determine if there is <b>pigmentary</b> retinopathy that may signify Kearns-Sayre syndrome which is associated with cardiac abnormalities.|$|E
25|$|Structural {{coloration}} {{is involved}} in the production of blue colors, iridescence, most ultraviolet reflectance and in the enhancement of <b>pigmentary</b> colors. Structural iridescence has been reported in fossil feathers dating back 40 million years. White feathers lack pigment and scatter light diffusely; albinism in birds is caused by defective pigment production, though structural coloration will not be affected (as can be seen, for example, in blue-and-white budgerigars).|$|E
25|$|Free {{radicals}} {{may also}} be involved in Parkinson's disease, senile and drug-induced deafness, schizophrenia, and Alzheimer's. The classic free-radical syndrome, the iron-storage disease hemochromatosis, is typically associated with a constellation of free-radical-related symptoms including movement disorder, psychosis, skin <b>pigmentary</b> melanin abnormalities, deafness, arthritis, and diabetes mellitus. The free-radical theory of aging proposes that free radicals underlie the aging process itself. Similarly, the process of mitohormesis suggests that repeated exposure to free radicals may extend life span.|$|E
25|$|Individuals with CS appear prematurely {{aged and}} exhibit severe growth {{retardation}} leading to short stature. They {{have a small}} head (less than the -3 standard deviation), fail to gain weight and failure to thrive. They also have extreme cutaneous photosensitivity (sensitivity to sunlight), neurodevelopmental abnormalities, and deafness, and often exhibit lipoatrophy, atrophic skin, severe tooth decay, sparse hair, calcium deposits in neurons, cataracts, sensorineural hearing loss, <b>pigmentary</b> retinopathy, and bone abnormalities. However, {{they do not have}} a higher risk of cancer.|$|E
25|$|MC1R has a {{slightly}} different function in cold-blooded animals such as fish, amphibians, and reptiles. Here, α-MSH activation of MC1R results in the dispersion of eumelanin-filled melanosomes throughout the interior of pigment cells (called melanophores). This gives {{the skin of the}} animal a darker hue and often occurs in response to changes in mood or environment. Such a physiological color change implicates MC1R as a key mediator of adaptive cryptic coloration. The role of ASIP's binding to MC1R in regulating this adaptation is unclear; however, in teleost fish at least, functional antagonism is provided by melanin-concentrating hormone. This signals through its receptor to aggregate the melanosomes toward a small area in the centre of the melanophore, resulting in the animal's having a lighter overall appearance. Cephalopods generate a similar, albeit more dramatic, <b>pigmentary</b> effect using muscles to rapidly stretch and relax their pigmented chromatophores. MC1R does not appear {{to play a role in}} the rapid and spectacular colour changes observed in these invertebrates.|$|E

500|$|The wings, head {{parts of}} thorax and abdomen of Lepidoptera {{are covered with}} minute scales, from which feature the order 'Lepidoptera' derives its names, the word [...] "lepteron" [...] in Ancient Greek meaning 'scale'. Most scales are lamellar, or blade-like and {{attached}} with a pedicel, while other forms may be hair-like or specialized as secondary sexual characteristics. The lumen or surface of the lamella, has a complex structure. It gives color either due to the <b>pigmentary</b> colors contained within or due to its three-dimensional structure. Scales provide a number of functions, which include insulation, thermoregulation, aiding gliding flight, amongst others, {{the most important of}} which is the large diversity of vivid or indistinct patterns they provide which help the organism protect itself by camouflage, mimicry, and to seek mates.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Pigmentary</b> {{glaucoma}} (also, <b>pigmentary</b> dispersion syndrome) {{is caused}} by pigment cells sloughing off {{from the back of}} the iris and floating around in the aqueous humor. Over time, these pigment cells can accumulate in the anterior chamber in such a way that it can begin to clog the trabecular meshwork. [...] It is a rare condition that occurs mostly among Caucasians, mostly males in their mid-20s to 40s, and most are nearsighted.|$|E
2500|$|Also, some {{individuals}} exhibit <b>pigmentary</b> disorders, such as albinism. Although {{these individuals are}} rare in the wild, they are common in captivity, where they are often selectively bred to make {{a variety of different}} color [...] "morphs". Boa constrictors have an arrow-shaped head with very distinctive stripes on it: One runs dorsally from the snout {{to the back of the}} head; the others run from the snout to the eyes and then from the eyes to the jaw.|$|E
2500|$|The colours of {{most species}} are <b>pigmentary</b> (via papiliochrome); but two species, Troides magellanus and the much rarer T. prattorum, are noted {{for their use}} of limited-view iridescence: the yellow of the dorsal hindwings is {{modified}} by bright blue-green iridescence which is only seen when the butterfly is viewed at a narrow, oblique angle. This [...] "grazing iridescence" [...] is brought about through diffraction of light (after back-reflection) by the wings' extremely steeply-set, multilayered rib-like scales (rather than the ridge-lamellae of most other iridescent butterflies, such as Morpho species). Such limited-view iridescence was previously only known from one other species, the riodinid Ancyluris meliboeus. In A. meliboeus, however, the iridescence is produced by ridge-lamellar scales and features {{a wider range of}} colours.|$|E
2500|$|Titanium dioxide is {{the most}} widely used white pigment because of its {{brightness}} and very high refractive index, in which it is surpassed only by a few other materials. Approximately 4.6 million tons of <b>pigmentary</b> TiO2 are used annually worldwide, and this number is expected to increase as utilization continues to rise. When deposited as a thin film, its refractive index and colour make it an excellent reflective optical coating for dielectric mirrors and some gemstones like [...] "mystic fire topaz". TiO2 is also an effective opacifier in powder form, where it is employed as a pigment to provide whiteness and opacity to products such as paints, coatings, plastics, papers, inks, foods, medicines (i.e. pills and tablets) as well as most toothpastes. In paint, it is often referred to offhandedly as [...] "the perfect white", [...] "the whitest white", or other similar terms. Opacity is improved by optimal sizing of the titanium dioxide particles.|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{forget all}} that a skilled vivisector {{can do with}} living things," [...] said Moreau. [...] "For my own part, I'm puzzled why the things I have done here have not been done before. Small efforts, of course, have been made,--amputation, tongue-cutting, excisions. Of course you know a squint may be induced or cured by surgery? Then {{in the case of}} excisions you have all kinds of {{secondary}} changes, <b>pigmentary</b> disturbances, modifications of the passions, alterations in the secretion of fatty tissue. I have no doubt you have heard of these things?" ...|$|E
6000|$|The {{organs of}} sight and hearing are {{generally}} admitted to be homologous {{with one another and}} with various dermal appendages; hence these parts are liable to be abnormally affected in conjunction. Mr. White Cowper says [...] "that in all cases of double microphthalmia brought under his notice he has at the same time met with defective development of the dental system." [...] Certain forms of blindness seem {{to be associated with the}} colour of the hair; a man with black hair and a woman with light-coloured hair, both of sound constitution, married and had nine children, all of whom were born blind; of these children, five [...] "with dark hair and brown iris were afflicted with amaurosis; the four others, with light-coloured hair and blue iris, had amaurosis and cataract conjoined." [...] Several cases could be given, showing that some relation exists between various affections of the eyes and ears; thus Liebreich states that out of 241 deaf-mutes in Berlin, no less than fourteen suffered from the rare disease called <b>pigmentary</b> retinitis. Mr. White Cowper and Dr. Earle have remarked that inability to distinguish different colours, or colour-blindness, [...] "is often associated with a corresponding inability to distinguish musical sounds." [...] (25/23. These statements are taken from Mr. Sedgwick in the 'Medico-Chirurg. Review' July 1861 page 198; April 1863 pages 455 and 458. Liebreich is quoted by Professor Devay in his 'Mariages Consanguins' 1862 page 116.) ...|$|E
