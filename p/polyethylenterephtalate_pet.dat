40|$|Two plasma {{deposited}} {{acrylic acid}} (pdAA) surfaces {{with very different}} surface density of COOH groups, wettability and stability in water were compared about their suitability to support adhesion and growth of 3 T 3 murine fibroblast cell lines. <b>Polyethylenterephtalate</b> (<b>PET)</b> and tissue culture polystyrene (TCPS) were used as control. PdAA surfaces with a low surface density of COOH groups (4 +/- 1 %, from the C Is XPS spectra) resulted more cell adhesive than coatings with higher COOH density...|$|E
40|$|Progress in laser {{technology}} {{over the years}} and its flexibility of use promise a wide range of methods for the fabrication of organic and large area electronics (OLAE). Several examples of laser-machining in the reel-to-reel process are discussed, such as dicing of devices, drilling of via holes and opening of contacts. In this paper we will focus on laser drilling of via holes applied directly on flexible substrates for a two layer interconnect metallization. The substrates consist of a 50 µm thick and 200 mm wide web of Polyimide (PI) or <b>Polyethylenterephtalate</b> (<b>PET).</b> The challenge is to stop the laser on a metallization of a few micrometer thickness. The second metallization layer is deposited afterwards by screen printing or sputtering. An ultra-violet solid state laser with five axes in a reel-to-reel environment is used...|$|E
40|$|In 2007 the Large Hadron Collider will be {{launched}} at CERN in Geneva. One {{of the most}} exciting experiments planned for this new equipment is the CMS experiment (Compact Muon Solenoid). This is a huge and sophisticated detector for high energy species created by the particle collisions under test. The conversion of the particle energy into Cherenkov radiation is one of the effects used for measurements. The light impulses are measured by a system of photodetectors. It is necessary to provide the light signals to these detectors with low losses. Therefore crystals and light guides are enveloped with flexible material of high reflectivity. It was the task of FEP to provide this material. The most challenging part of was the coating of the polymer film. <b>Polyethylenterephtalate</b> (<b>PET)</b> was used as the substrate material for the layer stack. The film was coated with an adhesion promoting layer and aluminium. But the reflectivity of the metal would not have been high enough for the requirements of CERN. Therefore a four layer stack consisting of silica and niobia as materials with low and high refractive index, respectively, was applied on top of the aluminium layer. The optical thickness was optimized {{in such a way that}} the stack provided a maximum reflectivity between 400 nm and 650 nm under an angle of incidence of 70 °. Finally a reflectivity ? 95 % was achieved. This value met the requirements of CERN. The material was coated in the coFlex? 600 sputter roll coater at FEP site. A newly designed DMS system for the deposition of silica was used for these runs. Deposition rate and uniformity data for this equipment will be presented...|$|E
