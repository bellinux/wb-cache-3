50|$|These efforts {{succeeded in}} {{influencing}} public <b>perception</b> <b>of</b> <b>climate</b> science. Between 1988 and the 1990s, public discourse {{shifted from the}} science and data of climate change to discussion of politics and surrounding controversy.|$|E
50|$|Commentators {{have argued}} that the climate change discourses {{constructed}} in the media have not been conducive to generating the political will for swift action. The polar bear has become a powerful discursive symbol in the fight against climate change. However, such images may create a <b>perception</b> <b>of</b> <b>climate</b> change impacts as geographically distant, and MacNaghten argues that climate change needs to be framed as an issue 'closer to home'. On the other hand, Beck suggests that a major benefit of global media is that it brings distant issues within our consciousness.|$|E
30|$|The {{findings}} from Ochenje et al. (2016), Munthali et al. (2016), and Roco et al. (2015) show that farmers’ <b>perceptions</b> <b>of</b> how <b>climate</b> change affects their farming activities {{have a direct}} link with how they perceive the kind of adaptation they need. This deduction {{is also consistent with}} Elum et al. (2017), who examined how farmers’ <b>perceptions</b> <b>of</b> <b>climate</b> change formed their adaptation strategies. They also examined the trend in climate parameters and the constraints on farmers. Primary data based on questionnaires were collected from 150 randomly sampled farmers in three provinces in South Africa from June to August 2015. Analysis <b>of</b> the farmers’ <b>perceptions</b> <b>of</b> <b>climate</b> change showed that most farmers indicated that they had experienced higher temperatures, drought, and lower crop yields attributable to changing weather conditions over time. Other studies also report similar findings. For instance, Arshad et al. (2016) examined farmers’ <b>perceptions</b> <b>of</b> <b>climate</b> change and the impact on farm productivity in rural Pakistan. Their study showed that farmers’ adaptation strategies were highly influenced by the way they perceived the impact <b>of</b> <b>climate</b> change on the productivity of their farms. The increased need by farmers for extension services as well as financial services, they argued, were also found to be influenced by farmers’ <b>perceptions</b> <b>of</b> <b>climate</b> change and its effects on their farm productivity.|$|R

40|$|It is well {{recognized}} that tourism {{development is a}} prominent contributor to climate change, but is also a “victim” <b>of</b> <b>climate</b> change. Therefore, to mitigate <b>climate</b> change is <b>of</b> great importance for the sustainability of tourism. Yet extant studies regarding tourism and climate change tend {{to be dominated by}} a supply-side stance, albeit the core role of the tourist in the tourism industry. While researchers are increasingly adopting a tourist perspective, few seek to understand the linkage between climate change and tourists’ specific mitigation behaviors in a tourism context; this is especially so in China. This study investigates the impact <b>of</b> Chinese tourists’ <b>perceptions</b> <b>of</b> <b>climate</b> change on their mitigation behaviors based on norm activation theory. Drawing on 557 self-administrated questionnaires collected in China, it finds that tourists’ <b>perceptions</b> <b>of</b> <b>climate</b> change and perceived contribution <b>of</b> tourism to <b>climate</b> change both positively affect energy saving and carbon reduction behavior in tourism. Yet, compared with perceived contribution <b>of</b> tourism to <b>climate</b> change, tourists’ <b>perceptions</b> <b>of</b> <b>climate</b> change are found to be a much stronger predictor for energy saving and carbon reduction behavior. Therefore, it suggests that tourists’ <b>perceptions</b> <b>of</b> <b>climate</b> change in a general context is more strongly related to climate change mitigation behavior in tourism, calling for attention to go beyond the tourism context to alleviate the negative impacts <b>of</b> tourism on <b>climate</b> change...|$|R
50|$|Research {{on global}} warming is often being portrayed through the same journalistic {{principles}} as other news stories; newsworthiness and contested phenomena. Despite previous attempts at balanced reporting giving rise to a skewed <b>perception</b> <b>of</b> <b>climate</b> scepticism, the debate over anthropogenic climate change in Norway is quite progressive compared to others. So much so that you don't even see conservative politicians or media commentators question mainstream climate science anymore as to them {{it is clear that}} the planet is warming. Moreover, the main debate is centred on the timescale of change due to our impacts.|$|E
5000|$|Leiserowitz is {{a widely}} {{recognized}} expert on American and international public opinion on global warming, including public <b>perception</b> <b>of</b> <b>climate</b> change risks, support and opposition for climate policies, and willingness to make individual behavioral change. He has published over 100 scientific articles and book chapters on climate change beliefs, perceptions and behaviors [...] and often appears on popular talk shows such as Bill Moyers [...] and Real Time with Bill Maher. Leiserowitz is a geographer trained in the cognitive and social psychology of risk perception and decision making. His 2003 PhD dissertation 'Global Warming in the American Mind' has been widely influential. Members of his PhD committee [...] included, among others, Paul Slovic, who is often considered alongside Daniel Kahneman and Amos Tversky, as the founding father of research on human judgment, risk perception, and decision making.|$|E
5000|$|Different ideological worldviews of {{responding}} to climate change: Nowadays, because of the perception of science as a dominant policy driver, much of the policy prescription and action in climate change arena have concentrated on assumptions around standardised governance and planning systems, linear policy processes, readily transferable technology, economic rationality, {{and the ability of}} science and technology to overcome resource gaps. As a result, there tends to be a bias towards technology-led and managerial approaches to address climate change in apolitical terms. Besides, a wide range of different ideological worldviews would lead to a high divergence of the <b>perception</b> <b>of</b> <b>climate</b> change solutions, which also has a great influence on decisions made in response to climate change. Exploring these issues from a political economy perspective provides the opportunity to better understand the “complexity of politic and decision-making processes in tackling climate change, the power relations mediating competing claims over resources, and the contextual conditions for enabling the adoption of technology”.|$|E
40|$|Previous {{studies have}} {{revealed}} that American undergraduate students complain about International Teaching Assistants’ (ITAs) lack of English proficiency and rate ITAs lower than American Teaching Assistants (ATAs) on teaching evaluations. This study investigates student <b>perceptions</b> <b>of</b> classroom <b>climate</b> to discover how ITAs might overcome students’ ethnocentric preconceptions. Survey results from 485 undergraduate students found that student <b>perceptions</b> <b>of</b> classroom <b>climate</b> differed significantly with ITAs as compared to ATAs. Student <b>perceptions</b> <b>of</b> classroom <b>climate</b> also differed significantly by the biological sex of the student.

40|$|The {{present study}} {{examined}} the relationship between dance-related perfectionism and <b>perceptions</b> <b>of</b> motivational <b>climate</b> in dance over time. In doing so, three possibilities were tested: (a) perfectionism affects <b>perceptions</b> <b>of</b> the motivational <b>climate,</b> (b) <b>perceptions</b> <b>of</b> the motivational <b>climate</b> affect perfectionism, and (c) the relationship is reciprocal. Two hundred seventy-one young dancers (M = 14. 21 years old, SD = 1. 96) from UK Centres for Advanced Training completed questionnaires twice, approximately 6 months apart. Cross-lagged analysis indicated that perfectionistic concerns led to increased <b>perceptions</b> <b>of</b> an ego-involving <b>climate</b> and decreased <b>perceptions</b> <b>of</b> a task-involving <b>climate</b> over time. In addition, <b>perceptions</b> <b>of</b> a task-involving <b>climate</b> led to increased perfectionistic strivings over time. The findings suggest that perfectionistic concerns may color <b>perceptions</b> <b>of</b> training/performing environments so that mistakes are deemed unacceptable and only superior performance is valued. They also suggest that <b>perceptions</b> <b>of</b> a task-involving <b>climate</b> in training/performing environments may encourage striving for excellence and perfection without promoting excessive concerns regarding their attainment...|$|R
30|$|Variation in <b>perceptions</b> <b>of</b> school <b>climate</b> {{is based}} on {{different}} factors. From a multilevel approach, there are student-, school-, and classroom-related {{factors that contribute to}} determine the student <b>perception</b> <b>of</b> school <b>climate,</b> including sex and race, school size and faculty turnover, and characteristics of the teacher, class size, and the concentration of students with behavior problems (Koth et al. 2008). There are also contextual factors that contribute to determine the student <b>perception</b> <b>of</b> school <b>climate,</b> including norms, goals, values, interpersonal relationships, teaching and learning practices, and organizational structure (Cohen et al. 2009). Furthermore, the student <b>perception</b> <b>of</b> school <b>climate</b> {{is based on}} student background and motivational factors, and quality and consistency of interpersonal interactions within the school community (Haynes et al., 1997).|$|R
5000|$|The {{problematic}} <b>perception</b> <b>of</b> <b>climate</b> {{change as}} simply a “global” issue: Climate change initiatives and governance approaches {{have tended to be}} driven from the global scale. While the development of international agreements has witnessed a progressive step of global political action, this globally-led governance of climate change issue may be unable to provide adequate flexibility for specific national or sub-national conditions. Besides, from the development perspective of view, the issue of equity and global environmental justice would require a fair international regime within which the impact of climate change and poverty could be simultaneously prevented. In this context, climate change is not only a global crisis that needs the presence of international politics, but also a challenge for national or sub-national governments. The understanding of the political economy of climate change could explain the formulation and translation of international initiatives to specific national and sub-national policy context, which provides an important perspective to tackle climate change and achieve environmental justice.|$|E
5000|$|Contribution {{to climate}} change is {{correlated}} to gender. A study on car use in Sweden for example found that {{men are more likely}} to use the car more, for longer distances and alone compared to women, thereby exhausting more CO2 than women. A study of young people in Finland shows that concern over climate change has a higher impact on climate friendly consumption in women compared to men.This may be incidental to differences in <b>perception</b> <b>of</b> <b>climate</b> change. Women tend to agree with the scientific opinion that anthropogenic pollution is mainly responsible for climate change (m: 56%, f: 64%) and are more concerned about its effects: 29% of men and 35% of women in the US [...] "worry about global warming a great deal".Women furthermore possess unique skills and knowledge, which are important in building equal and sustainable responses {{to climate change}}. The UNFPA report State of world population 2009 - Facing a changing world: women, population and climate identifies women as important actors in mobilizing against climate change. [...] The report quotes Wangari Maathai that “Women hold the key to Climate’s Future”; “when we talk about reducing emissions from deforestation and degradation, {{we need to focus on}} women …” ...|$|E
50|$|Gender is a {{topic of}} {{increasing}} concern within climate change policy and science. Generally, gender approaches to climate change address gender- differentiated consequences of climate change, as well as unequal adaptation capacities and gendered contribution to climate change. Furthermore, the intersection of climate change and gender raises questions regarding the complex and intersecting power relations arising from it. These differences, however, are mostly not due to biological or physical differences, but are formed by the social, institutional and legal context. Subsequently, vulnerability is less an intrinsic feature of women and girls but rather a product of their marginalization.Roehr notes that, while the United Nations officially committed to gender mainstreaming, in practice gender equality is not reached {{in the context of}} climate change policies. This is reflected in the fact that discourses of and negotiations over climate change are mostly dominated by men.Some feminist scholars hold that the debate on climate change is not only dominated by men but also primarily shaped in ‘masculine’ principles, which limits discussions about climate change to a perspective that focuses on technical solutions. This <b>perception</b> <b>of</b> <b>climate</b> change hides subjectivity and power relations that actually condition climate-change policy and science, leading to a phenomenon that Tuana terms ‘epistemic injustice’.Similarly, MacGregor attests that by framing climate change as an issue of ‘hard’ natural scientific conduct and natural security, it is kept within the traditional domains of hegemonic masculinity.|$|E
50|$|Students’ {{race and}} {{ethnicity}} can have an influence on their <b>perception</b> <b>of</b> the school’s <b>climate.</b> For instance, a study collected information from African American and white middle school students found differences in their <b>perception</b> <b>of</b> racial <b>climate</b> in their school. Therefore, African American, female, and lower income students have a more negative <b>perception</b> <b>of</b> the racial <b>climate</b> than white, middle class, and male students. Another study also conducted with middle school students found that students from a Hispanic/Latino background felt that relationships with teachers played a bigger role in their <b>perception</b> <b>of</b> community <b>climate</b> than relationships with students. In contrast, student relationships was a higher priority for Asian and white students.|$|R
40|$|This thesis tests <b>perceptions</b> <b>of</b> <b>climate</b> {{variability}} {{with actual}} rainfall data. It also compares the <b>perceptions</b> <b>of</b> agriculturists in Burkina Faso, West Africa {{with those of}} agriculturists in the Sulphur Springs Valley, Southeastern Arizona. This study contests claims by other researchers that farmers' <b>perceptions</b> <b>of</b> <b>climate</b> change are shaped by events rather than variation in climate. The analyses demonstrate that people in both regions are able to detect variations in <b>climate</b> on time-scales <b>of</b> at least a decade. Both groups of farmers key into intra-annual variation that is related to seasonality. That perceptions are based on seasons {{is due to the}} fact that seasonality shapes the vulnerability <b>of</b> farming to <b>climate</b> in both regions. This thesis adds perceptions to the analytical field <b>of</b> <b>climate</b> vulnerability studies and points out that the atmospheric phenomena behind the variability farmers perceive merits scientific investigation...|$|R

50|$|According to {{a survey}} {{conducted}} IPCC WGI Co-Chairs and Technical Support Unit (TSU) on April 25, 2014, many of the polled authors stated that they saw {{the need for a}} better gender balance. This is reflected in the gender balance of contributors to the fifth IPCC assessment report. Only 27% of contributors to Working Group II, concerned with impacts, adaptation and vulnerability and 18,5% of contributors of Working Group I, concerned with the physical science basis, are female. This also applies to other organisation, as for example only 7% of leadership positions in the offices of National Weather Services are women. On a similar note, a study conducted by the University of Oxford in cooperation with the Nielsen Company found that 18 of the 22 ‘most influential spokespeople on climate change’ are male. Female spokespeople were neither politicians nor scientists and their direct connection to climate change is therefore doubtful. A list of prominent women scientists is available at Women in climate change.Some feminist scholars hold that the debate on climate change is not only dominated by men but also primarily shaped in ‘masculine’ principles, which limits discussions about climate change to a perspective that focuses on technical solutions. This <b>perception</b> <b>of</b> <b>climate</b> change hides subjectivity and power relations that actually condition climate change policy and science, leading to a phenomenon that Tuana terms ‘epistemic injustice’.Similarly, MacGregor criticizes the scientific discourse from a less quantitative perspective but focusses on discursive aspects. She attests that by framing climate change as an issue of ‘hard’ natural scientific conduct and natural security, it is kept within the traditional domains of hegemonic masculinity. Seager maintains that the 2 °C aim, which is a reoccurring topic in the climate change debate, is not, as often assumed, a safe goal for all people on the planet. Rather it will ensure the stability of a patriarchal capitalism and subsequently the continuity of power for those who are powerful today.|$|E
30|$|The {{results of}} multinomial logit {{regressions}} show that age, sex, marital status, household size, and education level {{are the main}} factors significantly influencing farmers’ <b>perception</b> <b>of</b> <b>climate</b> change in study area. This result {{is consistent with the}} fact that the socio-demographic characteristics influence farmers’ <b>perception</b> <b>of</b> <b>climate</b> change as reported by previous authors (Kapoury et al. 2016; Ayanwuyi et al. 2010; Legesse et al. 2010; Olayemi 2012; Sahu and Mishra 2013). This result is however in contrast to the findings of Odewumi et al.

30|$|Unlike the wet lowland condition, {{change in}} {{temperature}} and precipitation {{and frequency of}} drought experienced in the past are less important in influencing farmers’ <b>perception</b> <b>of</b> <b>climate</b> in the dry lowland.

50|$|When {{gathering}} information about school climate, {{it is recommended}} to gather information from multiple perspectives (e.g., teachers, administrators, students, etc.). For instance, a study comparing parents’, teachers’, and students’ <b>perceptions</b> <b>of</b> school <b>climate</b> found that students reported worse ratings of safety and connectedness than the adults. In addition, some student characteristics also affect their <b>perception</b> <b>of</b> school <b>climate.</b> Therefore, having behavior problems, being held back a grade, coming from a single-parent family, or having a different ethnic background can all influence a student’s <b>perception</b> <b>of</b> school <b>climate.</b> This {{emphasizes the importance of}} {{gathering information}} from different informants when assessing school climate.|$|R
30|$|Results of the {{selection}} model for the wet lowland condition (Table  8) indicate that education level of the household head, age of the household head, changes in temperature and precipitation, number of crop failures in the past, and frequency of drought in the past significantly {{increase the likelihood of}} farmers’ <b>perception</b> <b>of</b> <b>climate</b> change (P[*]<[*] 0.01). Likewise, duration of food shortage faced in the past is statistically significant in enhancing farmer’s <b>perception</b> <b>of</b> <b>climate</b> change (P[*]<[*] 0.05).|$|E
30|$|In {{line with}} the results, any {{intervention}} that promotes the use of adaptation measures toclimate change may account for location-specific factors that determine farmers' <b>perception</b> <b>of</b> <b>climate</b> change and adaptive responses thereof.|$|E
30|$|Based on {{the model}} result {{educational}} attainment, {{the age of the}} head of the household, thenumber of crop failures in the past, changes in temperature and precipitation significantly influencedfarmers’ <b>perception</b> <b>of</b> <b>climate</b> change in wet lowland parts of the study area. In dry lowland condition,farming experience, climate information, duration of food shortage, and the number of crop failuresexperienced determined farmers’ <b>perception</b> <b>of</b> <b>climate</b> change. Farmers’ adaptation decision in both the wet and dry lowland conditions is influenced by household size, the gender of household head, cultivatedland size, education, farm experience, non-farm income, income from livestock, climate information, extension advice, farm-home distance and number of parcels. However, the direction of influence and significance level of most of the explanatory variables vary between the two parts of the study area.|$|E

30|$|Descriptive {{statistics}} {{were used to}} analyze farmers’ <b>perception</b> <b>of</b> <b>climate</b> change, whereas chi-squared {{test was used to}} determine farmers’ perception on propagation of G. kola whether there is {{a significant difference in the}} perception between the farmers’ demography background. A multinomial logit (MNL) regression was used to identify the main determinants of farmers’ <b>perception</b> <b>of</b> <b>climate</b> change. The advantage of the multinomial logit is that it permits the analysis of decisions across more than two categories allowing the determination of choice probabilities for different categories of climate attributes. Apart from the well-known drawbacks of the independence of irrelevant alternatives (IIA), this approach is more appropriate than the probit or logit models that have conventionally been used. Instead of having two dichotomous alternatives (0, 1) as in the multivariate logit or probit models, the multinomial logit has J possible states or categories (Cramer 2003; Tse 1987).|$|E
30|$|There are {{studies that}} have sought to {{establish}} a relationship between actual impacts or changes in climate and people’s perception of these changes. The findings yield varied results. For instance, Adimassu et al. (2014) and Becken et al. (2013) established that communities are not always scientifically accurate in their assessment of climate change. Thus, there are cases where climate change and its associated impacts are exaggerated or underestimated. In Gladstone South Africa, Gandure et al. (2013) found mixed results; farmers’ perception of high rainfall variability was supported by meteorological data while their perception of rainfall onset was at variance with meteorological data. The implication is that awareness of climate change impact if not verified with empirical data, can lead to misinformation. On the other hand, Howe et al. (2014) established that in India, respondents who indicated annual rainfall changes (increasing or decreasing) were located in parts of India that corresponded with their perceived changes. There are other {{studies that have}} examined the influence of socio-economic factors on the <b>perception</b> <b>of</b> <b>climate</b> change. For instance, Opiyo et al. (2016) established that gender, livestock ownership, and access to extension services influenced the <b>perception</b> <b>of</b> <b>climate</b> change. Maddison (2007) found that experience (years spent in farming) influenced farmer perceptions of climate change. These findings suggest that <b>perception</b> <b>of</b> <b>climate</b> change assumes a spatial scale and will depend on socio-economic attributes of the population under study.|$|E
40|$|The {{purposes}} of this study were (1) to compare <b>perceptions</b> <b>of</b> school <b>climate</b> measured by 10 subscales of the NASSP School Climate Survey and student satisfaction measured by 8 subscales of the Student Satisfaction Survey of language-minority students to those of non-language-minority students and (2) to investigate whether students' <b>perceptions</b> <b>of</b> school <b>climate,</b> student satisfaction, gender, or language group affected students' academic achievement. The sample population included ninth-grade students at Nogales High School. Students were classified as second-language learners according to the district's Identification, Assessment, and Program Placement flow chart. The study used four independent predictors of reading and math achievement: language group, gender, school climate, and student satisfaction. A multiple regression analysis tested relationships between the predicated variable and independent predictors. The Pearson product-moment correlation determined the relationship between student satisfaction and <b>perception</b> <b>of</b> school <b>climate.</b> A two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) distinguished whether satisfaction and <b>perceptions</b> <b>of</b> school <b>climate</b> were different for second-language learners and non-second-language learners and whether there was a difference in satisfaction and <b>perceptions</b> <b>of</b> school <b>climate</b> by gender among second-language learners and non-second-language learners. The findings of this study indicated a moderate correlation between student satisfaction and <b>perceptions</b> <b>of</b> school <b>climate.</b> Statistically significant differences were found by language group for student satisfaction and for satisfaction by gender among non-second-language learners. No statistically significant differences were found by language group for school climate, for gender among second-language learners for satisfaction or school <b>climate,</b> or between <b>perceptions</b> <b>of</b> school <b>climate</b> for boys and girls among non-second-language learners.
