5|$|Ballo's father wrote a {{book about}} his daughter's death, and refrained from {{interviews}} with the press until the book was published in 2009. Titled Kaja: 1988–2008, the book became a bestseller in Norway. It reached second place on the bestseller list of the Bestseller Association in Norway for general literature, in May 2009. The author stated he wrote the book as an expository method to both process his grief, inform his family about the controversy, and educate the <b>public</b> <b>about</b> suicide.|$|E
5|$|By the 1910s, {{the use of}} breaker boys was {{dropping}} because of improvements in technology, stricter child labor laws, and the enactment of compulsory education laws. The practice of employing children in coal breakers largely ended by 1920 because of {{the efforts of the}} National Child Labor Committee, sociologist and photographer Lewis Hine, and the National Consumers League, all of whom educated the <b>public</b> <b>about</b> the practice and succeeded in obtaining passage of national child labor laws.|$|E

5|$|Series creator Stephen Hillenburg {{first became}} {{fascinated with the}} ocean as a child. He also began {{developing}} his artistic abilities at a young age. Although these two interests would not overlap {{with each other for}} a long time—the idea of drawing fish seemed boring to him—Hillenburg pursued both during college, receiving a major in marine biology and a minor in art. After graduating in 1984, he joined the Ocean Institute, an organization in Dana Point, California, dedicated to educating the <b>public</b> <b>about</b> marine science and maritime history.|$|E

5|$|The authors {{discuss the}} broader concept of denial using social science theory, noting its {{occurrence}} appears in society when individuals are frightened or ashamed of their actions. They write that these motivations, when expanded {{from an individual}} to wider society, present themselves {{as a form of}} disease. The book identifies climate change denial itself as a pathology afflicting the culture of the planet. The authors lament that an inverse relationship exists between an increasing scientific consensus regarding climate change, and a simultaneous increase in denial within the greater <b>public</b> <b>about</b> the same issue.|$|E
5|$|Umbricht's {{death from}} {{melanoma}} helped alert the general <b>public</b> <b>about</b> the disease. Former Los Angeles Rams linebacker Jack Pardee credited Umbricht's battle with melanoma for saving {{his life in}} 1965. Pardee, a Pro Bowl linebacker, had been ignoring a mole on his armpit. After hearing of Umbricht's battle with cancer, and that his mole was similar to Umbricht's, {{he went to the}} team doctor, who diagnosed him with melanoma. Although Pardee's melanoma had also spread throughout his body, he made a complete recovery.|$|E
5|$|A {{few minutes}} later at 11:00, The Great Artiste dropped {{instruments}} attached to three parachutes. These instruments also contained an unsigned letter to Professor Ryokichi Sagane, a physicist at the University of Tokyo who studied with three of the scientists responsible for the atomic bomb at the University of California, Berkeley, urging him to tell the <b>public</b> <b>about</b> the danger involved with these weapons of mass destruction. The messages were found by military authorities but not turned over to Sagane until a month later. In 1949, {{one of the authors}} of the letter, Luis Alvarez, met with Sagane and signed the document.|$|E

5|$|C-SPAN {{offers a}} number of public {{services}} related to the network's public affairs programming. C-SPAN Classroom, a free membership service for teachers, began in July 1987 and offers help using C-SPAN resources for classes or research. The C-SPAN School Bus, introduced in November 1993, traveled around the U.S. educating the <b>public</b> <b>about</b> government and politics using C-SPAN resources, {{and served as a}} mobile television studio. The bus also recorded video footage of the places that it visited. A second bus was introduced in 1996. The two original buses were retired in 2010, and the C-SPAN Digital Bus was inaugurated, introducing the public to C-SPAN's enhanced digital products. C-SPAN has also equipped six Local Content Vehicles (LCVs) to travel the country and record unique political and historical stories, with each vehicle containing production and web-based technologies to produce on-the-spot content.|$|E
5|$|In 1963, the Michigan State Highway Department petitioned AASHO {{to again}} {{make the change}} it had {{requested}} back in 1958, moving I-96 over I-196 to end at Muskegon and renumbering I-96 west of Grand Rapids to I-67. The state cited problems with destination signing and numerous complaints from the <b>public</b> <b>about</b> confusion caused by the numbering. At their October 21, 1963 meeting, AASHO approved the relocation of I-96, but rejected I-67, stating that the number should be kept for a more major route in case the system is expanded, and instead assigned I-196 to the not-yet-complete Benton Harbor–Grand Rapids highway. The signage was switched in January 1964. With the scheduled completion of the Lodge Freeway on October 29, 1964, a full freeway route was available from I-96 into downtown Detroit via I-696 and the Lodge, {{but it would be}} some time before I-96 was finished into the city.|$|E
5|$|In May 2009, the San Diego Association of Governments (SANDAG) {{announced}} that fixing SR67 was number17 on its priority list, {{resulting in an}} estimated 2030 completion of a four-lane highway {{that would not be}} limited-access. A month later, Caltrans and the California Highway Patrol agreed to take more efforts to educate the <b>public</b> <b>about</b> the safety issues. Signs were installed in 2010 to encourage drivers to practice safe driving habits; from January 2007 to early December2010, twenty-four people died from accidents on SR67. Following a March 2009 fatal crash, some of the survivors filed a lawsuit against Caltrans for negligence in maintaining and designing the highway, but the suit was decided in favor of the department. In a 2010 report, Caltrans suggested that two lanes could be added along the highway from I-8 to Dye Road in order to improve traffic flow.|$|E

5|$|Law {{enforcement}} officers often receive inquiries and demands about their investigations that stem from unrealistic portrayals on television. In a 2010 survey of Canadian police officers, some were frustrated by these CSI-affected queries, though most {{saw them as}} opportunities to inform the <b>public</b> <b>about</b> real police work. New technologies and the increased public awareness of forensic science have stimulated new interest in solving cold cases and encouraged higher accountability among police investigators. However, the increased demand for forensic evidence can cause an unmanageable workload for forensic laboratories. Some crime labs process several thousand cases every year. Many law enforcement agencies have insufficient storage space for the increasing amount of physical evidence they collect. In some investigations, DNA evidence is not collected simply because {{there is not enough}} space to store it properly.|$|E
5|$|On the {{day prior}} to the game, spread bettors favored Virginia Tech to win by 11.5 points. Despite that advantage, Tech head coach Frank Beamer warned his team and the <b>public</b> <b>about</b> the threat underdog Air Force posed to the Hokies' chances of winning. Both Beamer and Air Force head coach Fisher DeBerry were among the longest-tenured coaches in college {{football}} at the time. DeBerry had been a college coach for 19years, while Beamer had coached for 16 years. The game would be an opportunity for DeBerry to gain his 150th career win and defeat a ranked team {{for the first time}} since 1999. Ticket sales {{prior to the}} game were sluggish, as both teams failed to sell out their assigned allotments, and local sales registered fewer than 8,000tickets sold. In addition, local media coverage of the game was very sparse.|$|E
