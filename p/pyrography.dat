5000|$|Turner {{produced}} some fine, detailed pyrographic artworks. On {{his trip to}} the Continent, he was inspired by European and French master paintings and portraits. His love of portrait painting and exposure to early French <b>pyrography,</b> led to his interest in this art form. He created three known pyrographic portraits of European ladies together with a pyrographically decorated oak blanket chest, inscribed on the lid: [...] "This chest decorated in <b>pyrography</b> by me Charles H.F. Turner for my grand daughter Elise 1901".|$|E
50|$|Eaton {{was known}} for her <b>pyrography</b> works of nude figures that resembled etchings. She {{is thought to be}} the first artist to use <b>pyrography</b> for {{magazine}} illustrations, like the Winter and March illustrations, and created book covers using <b>pyrography.</b> A noted work is a frieze, Song of the Sea. She and her husband, Hugh M. Eaton, collaborated on their work and shared their Brooklyn workplace, Valhall Studio. The designed book-plates, book binding, illuminations, etchings, and pyrographic works of art. They were also interested in photography. Hugh, who owned a printing press, published illustrations made by the himk and/or his wife. She created architectural panel designs like Song of Iris for a dining room, nursery, and Even-Song to be placed over a mantel. By 1901, she illustrated the story Bettina's Easter Stock and with her husband illustrated Hail and Farewell.|$|E

50|$|Mang-osan {{started his}} journey with the {{arts at the}} age of 19. Using raw {{indigenous}} materials, he produced pieces depicting Cordilleran subjects on acrylic on canvas, mixed media, <b>pyrography</b> and solar drawing on various surfaces such as handmade paper and wooden panel.|$|E
50|$|Soldering irons {{are most}} often used for installation, repairs, and limited {{production}} work in electronics assembly. High-volume production lines use other soldering methods. Large irons {{may be used for}} soldering joints in sheet metal objects. Less common uses include <b>pyrography</b> (burning designs into wood) and plastic welding.|$|E
50|$|Trujillo {{is married}} and has a son, Tye, and daughter, Lulah. In April 2017, Tye {{performed}} with Korn during their South American tour, filling in for longtime bassist Reginald Arvizu. Trujillo's wife, Chloé, has also created a <b>pyrography</b> design of the Aztec calendar {{on one of his}} basses.|$|E
50|$|A large {{range of}} tones and shades can be achieved. Varying the type of tip used, the temperature, or the way the iron {{is applied to the}} {{material}} all create different effects. After the design is burned in, wooden objects are often coloured. Light-coloured hardwoods such as sycamore, basswood, beech and birch are most commonly used, as their fine grain is not obtrusive. However, other woods, such as maple, pine or oak, are also used. <b>Pyrography</b> is also applied to leather items, using the same hot-iron technique. Leather lends itself to bold designs, and also allows very subtle shading to be achieved. Specialist vegetable-tanned leather must be used for <b>pyrography</b> (as modern tanning methods leave chemicals in the leather which are toxic when burned), typically in light colours for good contrast.|$|E
50|$|Laser cutters {{can be set}} {{to scorch}} the {{material}} instead of cutting {{all the way through}} it. Many laser cutters provide software facilities to import image files and transfer them onto a sheet of wood. Some laser systems are sufficiently sensitive to perform <b>pyrography</b> on thin card or even paper.|$|E
5000|$|Although he crafted other things, Wara {{was best}} known for his wooden sculptures ( [...] in Pitjantjatjara). He carved them by hand and burned designs into them with a hot wire stick (this is called <b>pyrography).</b> His sculptures are of the perentie lizard, a type of goanna from central Australia which is also Wara's totem.|$|E
5000|$|The term means [...] "writing with fire", {{from the}} Greek pur (fire) and graphos (writing).

5000|$|The Basilica of San Nicandro {{was built}} atop Roman ruins {{on the eastern}} {{outskirts}} of the city, {{on the road to}} Isernia. The church has had many reconstructions and most recently restored in 2001. It features two naves and retains an altar in wood marquetry and <b>pyrography.</b> Under the altar is the crypt the tomb of St Nicandro was discovered, a spring called [...] "Manna of St. Nicandro" [...] also appears in the crypt.|$|E
50|$|Calle {{originally}} {{started working}} with traditional oil painting but decided to dedicate her work to drawing in 1994. She now works mostly with drawing and explores the use of line and its possibilities within her art. Calle uses a reduced black and white palette. She uses drawing to experiment with many other materials such as printed text, letraset, aluminum, wire, copper, iron and cloth. She also experiments with different techniques like sewing or knitting on canvas, <b>pyrography,</b> dactylography, collage, and typewriting.|$|E
5000|$|Gourd decoration, {{including}} <b>pyrography,</b> is {{an ancient}} tradition in Africa and Asia as well as among the indigenous peoples of the Americas, notably the central highland people of Peru, the Navajo, Hopi and Pueblo nations of the American Southwest, and the Nuxálk and Haida nations of British Columbia. Gourd crafting and painting has evolved from early hand carvings to the modern day use, by some, of electric wood burners and high-speed pen-shaped rotary tools {{that can be used}} to inscribe almost any design.|$|E
5000|$|There {{are ongoing}} discussions {{as to whether}} turning is a trade, craft, or an art form. Turning in its {{original}} form was certainly utilitarian. If your last name is [...] "Turner" [...] chances are there was a production wood turner some generations ago in your family tree. Many turners produce spindle work for furniture, architectural work, toys, and of course, bowls. But in recent years, many artists use turned pieces as a canvas for carving, <b>pyrography,</b> gold leaf work, inlay, stain and painting.|$|E
50|$|Nehmad {{produced}} primarily abstract prints employing various techniques, often including <b>pyrography.</b> In recent years, she {{has been}} working on the series WASTED, that references the large number of people killed by guns in the United States. The large triptychs in this series have dark abstract shapes representing spilled blood. There are small holes burned into the paper representing the number of people killed by gun violence in the United States. Each hole is stitched over with thread, the color of which indicates whether the death was homicide, suicide, accident, police action, or of undetermined cause.|$|E
5000|$|The {{process has}} been practiced {{by a number of}} {{cultures}} including the Egyptians and some African tribes since the dawn of recorded history. Pyrographer Robert Boyer hypothesises that the art form dates back to prehistory, when early humans created designs using the charred remains of their fires. It was known in China {{from the time of the}} Han dynasty, where it was known as [...] "Fire Needle Embroidery". During the Victorian era, the invention of <b>pyrography</b> machines sparked a widespread interest in the craft, and it was at this time that the term [...] "pyrography" [...] was coined (previously the name [...] "pokerwork" [...] had been most widely used) In the late 19th century, a Melbourne architect by the name of Alfred Smart discovered that water-based paint could be applied hot to wood by pumping benzoline fumes through a heated hollow platinum pencil. This improved the pokerwork process by allowing the addition of tinting and shading that were previously impossible. In the early 20th century, the development of the electric pyrographic hot wire wood etching machine further automated the pokerwork process, and Art Nouveau pyrographic gloveboxes and other works were popular in that era. <b>Pyrography</b> is a traditional folk art in many parts of Europe, including Romania, Hungary and Flanders, as well as Argentina and other areas in South America.|$|E
50|$|Pyrolysis {{also plays}} an {{important}} role in several cooking procedures, such as baking, frying, grilling, and caramelizing. It is a tool of chemical analysis, for example, in mass spectrometry and in carbon-14 dating. Indeed, many important chemical substances, such as phosphorus and sulfuric acid, were first obtained by this process. Pyrolysis has been assumed to take place during catagenesis, the conversion of buried organic matter to fossil fuels. It is also the basis of <b>pyrography.</b> In their embalming process, the ancient Egyptians used a mixture of substances, including methanol, which they obtained from the pyrolysis of wood.|$|E
5000|$|Peebles' “Resonating Bodies” projects, {{initiated}} in 2008, feature {{a series of}} amplified habitat sculptures for solitary bees, titled [...] "Audio Bee Booths" [...] and [...] "Audio Bee Cabinets". These permanent outdoor works utilize cabinetry and other woodworking, electronics, <b>pyrography,</b> and earth-based building techniques (adobe and cob). Resonating Bodies, {{is a series of}} integrated media installations, community outreach projects and a web site which illuminates aspects of Canada's biodiversity through focusing on pollination ecology, with special attention paid to the intersection of native bees, habitat and coevolution of plants and pollinators of the Greater Toronto Area and beyond (See [...] "Resonating Bodies" [...] at wordpress and on Facebook).|$|E
5000|$|After {{completing}} {{secondary school}} Rassenfosse joined the family business. Auguste Donnay, whom Rassenfosse's father had hired to decorate a home, became {{a friend of}} Armand and introduced him to other students of the Academy of Fine Arts in Liege including Gustave Serrurier, Emil Berchmans and Oscar Berchmans. Unknown to his family, by 1882 Rassenfosse was contributing drawings signed [...] "Zig" [...] to the satirical journal Le Frondeur, and was experimenting with etching using crude tools. In 1884 he married. The same year he showed his work to Adrien de Witte, an art teacher at the Liège Academy of Fine Arts. de Witte encouraged him to try out new techniques, including <b>pyrography.</b> This is a decorative technique in which a line drawing is burned into the wood. He made his first painting this year. In 1886, he began contributing illustrations to the magazine Wallonia.|$|E
50|$|The {{debate on}} the use of {{dressings}} for preservation of book bindings has spanned several decades as research and experimental evidence have slowly accumulated. The main argument is, when done incorrectly, multiple disadvantages exist, and when done correctly, little to no preservation advantage occurs. Pamphlets and guidelines give numerous downsides to dressings use, including: the dressing becoming increasingly acidic and discolors and stains the leather, oxidizes (penetration and expansion of oils including displacement and weakening of fibers) and stiffens, leave a sticky surface, collects dust, wicks into adjacent materials, forms unstable surface spews, encourages biological deterioration and mold growth, blocks surface porosity, impedes further treatment, wets and swells the leather, affects surface finishes, and desiccates the leather. Meanwhile, scientific experiments have shown no substantial benefits. The main authorities on the subject, therefore, discourage it, with a caveat for special cases done under the direction of a conservator. Leather can be decorated by a variety of methods, including <b>pyrography</b> and beading.|$|E
40|$|A {{technique}} for <b>pyrography</b> characteristic Simulation based on digital image is proposed. Firstly, a fast color characteristics transfer method based on local vector matching is used {{according to the}} similar feature of local region of image. Then, the color space is converted from RGB to Ruderman et al. ’s perception-based color space lαβ, according to a certain standard, feature vector is obtained from the mean values and standard deviation of local region of source image, and also, a sample matching is performed between the target and the source image according the local vector characteristics. Therefore, the Welsh’s point-to-point matching algorithm is avoided. On the basis of color transfer, the result image is integrated with the texture image, through adjusting the Alpha information; the china traditional folk <b>pyrography</b> painting effect is obtained. The experimental {{results show that the}} color transfer algorithm has the some advantages, such as high precision, strong universality and faster computation speed; and the final <b>pyrography</b> effects are satisfying.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} the discolouration of <b>pyrography</b> artwork applied to three different wood species {{when exposed to}} natural light. Samples were 'scorched' {{in a controlled manner}} at a range of temperatures to produce different shades from light to dark. This allowed comparisons to be made between different wood species and different temperatures. It was elucidated that <b>pyrography</b> is the result of several processes developed between migrating extractive substances and coloured reaction products formed through the thermal degradation of wood components, which combine in caramelisation and Maillard reactions. Each species was shown to react differently. The results confirm that these colours, caused through the 'scorching' process, are extremely sensitive during light exposure. Light induced colour change was more profound for segments 'scorched' at 350 ºC, particularly for the hardwood species. Overall, samples made of Douglas fir were found to discolour the least during exposure to natural light...|$|E
40|$|All {{previous}} studies of <b>pyrography</b> have been focussed on colour obtained through modifying the work parameters. This paper analyses colour nuances obtained by laser woodworking by measuring colour changes digitally. The investigated parameter is colour reproduction by laser technology, using different image conversion methods (Halftone Round, Jarvis, and so on). The changes of image reproduction are analysed globally and colour by colour. The {{results show that the}} colour nuances are represented to a more and less degree, according to the conversion method selected. To evaluate the aesthetic changes, CIEL*a*b* colour measurements were applied. The results show that laser burning on wood surfaces has a great influence on wood colour. These findings will be useful to develop innovative design possibilities for wood surfaces for furniture and other products...|$|E
