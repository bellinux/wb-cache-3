40|$|The {{formation}} of spironolactone (<b>S)</b> <b>bodies,</b> eosinophilic laminated cytoplasmic inclusions, is induced in the aldosterone-producing {{cells of the}} human adrenal cortex after the administration of spironolactone. The {{aim of this study}} was to define the enzyme histochemical characteristics of <b>S</b> <b>bodies,</b> S-body-containing cells, and the apparently hyperplastic zona glomerulosa (zG) of adrenal tissues attached to aldosteronomas. <b>S</b> <b>bodies</b> were found in 14 of 19 aldosteronomas, in 10 of 19 adrenal tissues attached to aldosteronomas, and in the adrenal tissues in a patient with aldosteronism due to bilateral diffuse zG hyperplasia. The <b>S</b> <b>bodies</b> themselves exhibited most intense 3 beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (3 beta HSD) activity but did not exhibit glucose- 6 -phosphate dehydrogenase (G 6 PD), NADP-dependent isocitrate dehydrogenase (NADP-ICDH), or succinate dehydrogenase (SDH) activity, confirming histochemically the origin of <b>S</b> <b>bodies</b> in the smooth endoplasmic reticulum. In two adenomas, <b>S</b> <b>bodies</b> were found to be surrounded by reaction products of acid hydrolase but were not found in the other adenomas and the remaining adrenal tissues. S-body-containing cells, irrespective of being neoplastic or not, showed enhanced 3 beta HSD, G 6 PD, and NADP-ICDH activity and weak SDH activity (Type I pattern of enzyme activity). Though zG was hyperplastic in most of the adrenal tissues attached to the adenomas, zG cells that did not contain <b>S</b> <b>bodies</b> showed the opposite pattern (Type II pattern) of enzyme activity (ie, weak 3 beta HSD, G 6 PD, and NADP-ICDH activity and intense SDH activity), in contrast to those in the adrenal tissues in a patient with aldosteronism due to bilateral diffuse zG hyperplasia (which showed the Type I pattern). The results are consistent with the view that hyperplastic zG cells, except S-body-containing cells, in the case of aldosteronoma are not hyperfunctioning. The latter cells may have enhanced but possibly abortive steroidogenic activity...|$|R

The present study aimed to further delineate the relationship between masculinity and men 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>body</b> image by examining various dimensions of CMN in relation to various dimensions of men 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>body</b> image (muscularity, leanness, and fitness) in a cross-national sample. Participants comprised young men from the United States (n = 192), the United Kingdom (n = 141), Australia (n = 160), and Sweden (n = 142). Multigroup path analyses showed that CMN was related to drive for muscularity, leanness, and fitness in all 4 countries, but there were differences across countries in which dimensions of CMN predicted men 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>body</b> image. Whereas conformity to the masculine norm of winning was a salient predictor across the 4 countries, conformity to the norm of risk-taking was linked to Australian men 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>body</b> image, and conformity to the norm of violence to British men 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>body</b> image.

40|$|Much of {{the concept}} of space in La Ceppède 2 ̆ 7 s Théorèmes is defined in the {{portrayal}} of Christ 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>body.</b> In this text, space appears as distances or gaps—between God and humankind, grace and damnation, poet and reader—which must be overcome by contemplation of Christ 2 ̆ 7 s redemptive act. Within the poet 2 ̆ 7 s meditative framework, Christ 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>body</b> acts as a physical, intermediate space in which the metaphysical principles of celestial will take form. For the meditant, the knowledge gained from reflection on Christ 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>body</b> allows the transcendence from the external, physical spaces of the material world in which s/he lives, to the internal, spiritual spaces of the divine world to which s/he aspires. Generically, La Ceppède 2 ̆ 7 s depiction of Christ 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>body</b> is often revealed in the poetic form of the blason, a lyric subgenre which itself plays on the dynamics between the external, physical description of the initial image or blason, and the more abstract, metaphysical interpretation of what is ultimately symbolized or blasonné. This paper will explore the relationship between the public spaces of the body and the private spaces of the heart and mind as illustrated in La Ceppède 2 ̆ 7 s adaptation of blason. La Ceppède depicts Christ 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>body</b> as a physical, public text, the reading and contemplation of which enable the dévot to accede to a more intimate, private link with God based on prayer and worship. The study begins with a brief history and definition of blason, then moves to specific textual analysis of sonnets dealing with Christ 2 ̆ 7 s eyes and hands...|$|R

40|$|Body {{depilation}} is {{a relatively}} new area of research inquiry. Although women in many industrialized cultures have engaged in body depilation for some time, this behavior has been documented only recently in men. While originally thought to be the practice of just a small percentage of men, recent studies suggest that more men engage in body depilation than had been previously hypothesized (Boroughs 2 ̆ 6 Thompson, 2002; Boroughs, Cafri, 2 ̆ 6 Thompson, 2005; Martins, Tiggemann, 2 ̆ 6 Churchett, 2008; Tiggemann, Martins, 2 ̆ 6 Churchett, 2008). Nevertheless, this area of research is understudied and the relationship between body depilation and men 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> overall <b>body</b> image is poorly understood. Since much of the documented evidence of men 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>body</b> depilation is either descriptive anecdotes via media accounts (see Gomes, 2001; Smith, 2000; Stuever, 2000; Stein, 1999; Schuler, 2000) or scientific investigations of the behavior that were undertaken to provide descriptive data about body depilation by men (see Boroughs 2 ̆ 6 Thompson, 2002; Boroughs, et al., 2005; Martins, et al., 2008; Porche, 2007; Tiggemann, et al., 2008), now {{the time has come to}} further the understanding of this behavior in men. The purpose of these studies was to increase both the breadth and depth of our understanding of body depilation in men and its correlates with general body image concerns. A central aim of the first study was to test Social Comparison Theory (Festinger, 1954) as a workable theoretical paradigm to explain the genesis and maintenance of body depilation. The second study investigated women 2 ̆ 7 s attitudes towards men 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>body</b> hair and men 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>body</b> depilation. Research questions that have provided the foundation for the design of this study include: a) is there a relationship between men 2 ̆ 7 s drive for muscularity, frequency of weekly exercise, and influence by others (via social comparison) that is related to their body depilation behaviors, b) do sexual minority men differ from heterosexual men with regard to depilation behaviors, c) what are women 2 ̆ 7 s attitudes toward men 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>body</b> hair and body depilation by men, and d) how might the attitudes of sexual minority women differ from heterosexual women on the topic of men 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>body</b> hair and body depilation by men...|$|R
40|$|Women 2 ̆ 7 s {{pursuit of}} beauty {{represents}} a global epidemic that spans many centuries. While {{the characteristics that}} define beauty vary across time and culture, a common thread prevails in which a female 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>body</b> serves as the canvas upon which her beauty will be judged. As such, women strive towards conforming their bodies to the ideal image of beauty {{in the hopes of}} reaping its associated societal benefits. Today 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> perfect <b>body</b> symbolizes control, hard work, ambition, and desire, from which is expected success, happiness, and fulfillment (Brownell, 1991). Thus, {{it comes as no surprise}} that women in Western culture strive to conform their bodies to the culture 2 ̆ 7 s ideal image. As efforts meet with failure, women face potential threats to their body satisfaction, body image, and self-esteem. Examination of other cultures illustrates alternative images that more loosely define beauty in terms of body. The question that arises involves the extent to which culture influences women 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>body</b> image and body satisfaction. The following literature review is devoted to examining the impact of culture on women 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>body</b> image and body satisfaction. By exploring cultures where women enjoy more positive body image regardless of their shape or size, it is hoped that variables will be identified that may serve as models in cultures showing women more vulnerable to poorer body image and less body satisfaction...|$|R

METHODS: CARDIA is a study of coronary artery disease risk factors in 5115 Black and White persons aged 18 to 30 at baseline. Analyses of covariance were carried out with body mass index and change in body mass index as the dependent variables, and with parental education, parental body size, and participant education as the major independent variables. RESULTS: Father 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>body</b> size was positively associated with participant 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> baseline <b>body</b> mass index among Black men, White men, and White women. Mother 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>body</b> size was positively associated with baseline body mass index among all race-sex groups, and with change in body mass index among White women.

CONCLUSIONS: Parental education may influence body mass index and changes in young adulthood, especially among White women.
