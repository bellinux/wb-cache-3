The route became concurrent with US6 beginning in 1932, between SR7 and the <b>Pennsylvania</b> <b>state</b> line. In 1939, the highway was rerouted north of its concurrency with US 6, replacing SR 538. In about 1969, SR 11 opened at SR 167 as an at-grade intersection, and seven years later, an interchange replaced the intersection.
