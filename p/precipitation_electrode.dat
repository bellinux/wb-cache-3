50|$|Precipitation and {{dissolution}} of a lithium salt {{takes place at}} any location where the electrolyte is present. However, increased <b>precipitation</b> on <b>electrode</b> surfaces decreases power density because the salt in a solid state is an insulator.

30|$|Considering above situations, we {{designed}} a Pd-functionalised carbon nanocomposite as an impedance enhancer to dramatically increase {{the sensitivity of}} an amperometric assay of MMP- 7, which has the following two functions. (1) Carbon nanospheres are a poor-conductive material [24]; (2) Pd nanoparticles can catalyse the oxidation of 4 -chloro- 1 -naphthol with H 2 O 2 to generate insoluble precipitation in situ, forming high-resistance <b>precipitation</b> on <b>electrodes</b> [25]. These two factors increase resistivity and significantly reduce current, which can remarkably improve {{the sensitivity of the}} biosensor to have a low LOD of 17.38  fg mL− 1. The constructed Pd-functionalized nanocomposite for catalytic precipitation reaction is practical in amperometric assays of MMP- 7 with high selectivity and sensitivity.|$|R
30|$|Matrix metalloproteinase- 7 plays {{a pivotal}} role in tumour {{progression}} and metastasis as an enzyme that can degrade the cell-matrix composition and cleave peptides between alanine and leucine in various biomolecular activation processes. In this work, a Pd-functionalised carbon nanocomposite was designed as a new impedance enhancer for an amperometric sensor of MMP- 7. Pd nanoparticles in the enhancer can catalyse the oxidation of 4 -chloro- 1 -naphthol with H 2 O 2 to generate insoluble precipitation in situ, forming high-resistance <b>precipitation</b> on <b>electrodes.</b> In addition, poorly conductive carbon nanospheres of the nanocomposite increased the precipitation resistance, further causing a dramatic increase in resistivity of the enhancer and, subsequently, a significant decrease in current. This can significantly promote the current signal difference between the biosensor treated with and without the target analyte, which {{is directly related to the}} sensitivity of the amperometric biosensor. Overall, electrochemical biosensor can sensitively detect MMP- 7 in the range of 100  fg mL− 1 to 100  ng mL− 1 with a limit of detection for MMP- 7 of 17.38  fg mL− 1.|$|R
30|$|In summary, a Pd-functionalized carbon {{nanocomposite}} was fabricated as a novel impedance enhancer, which reveals promising H 2 O 2 catalytic {{performance for}} 4 -CN oxidation. Utilising the high impedance of insoluble oxidised 4 -CN <b>precipitation</b> on the <b>electrode,</b> an amperometric biosensor for detection of MMP- 7 was constructed. The biosensor possesses comparable sensitivity, a broad detection range, good practicability and outstanding selectivity to {{the detection of}} MMP- 7, which suggests it potential application in various bio-applications.

40|$|Global {{environmental}} concerns, {{the depletion}} of the earth's finite resources and economic considerations are all incentives to interest consumers in renewable energies. Although the latter cannot yet replace all existing energy sources, they can supplement power generated by utilities and increase the diversity of our energy supply. Since years an immerse reserve of energy is lying under seas, an inexhaustible fuel essentially composed of organic matter. The bacteria present either in sediments or in seawater could oxidise organic matter as well as reduce oxygen dissolved in subsurface seawater. These different reactions result in a voltage drop between sediments and water surface, thus generating current. In 2002, a US team 1 has demonstrated that bacteria isolated from marine sediments, Geobacter sulfurreducens, could transfer electrons directly to electrode, without the contribution of soluble electron mediator 2. This new way of electron transfer promises high yields of current production and enables facilities such as microbial fuel cells to be implemented easily. Concurrently, French researchers 3 have demonstrated that a stainless steel cathode covered by a biofilm formed in seawater reveals extraordinarily high catalytic properties for the electrochemical reduction of dissolved oxygen. In this context, an installation was implemented in Genova harbour, simply composed of two stainless steel electrodes: one dipped in sea mud, and another immersed in surface seawater. First results were encouraging but indicated a current limitation. Various assumptions were emitted to explain this phenomenon: substrate diffusion, <b>precipitation</b> on <b>electrode</b> surface, low conductivity. Analyses of electrochemical kinetics and mass transfer revealed that the anode process was the rate limiting step. In order to better understand these phenomena, experiments on different anodic materials (graphite and stainless steel) were carried out in laboratory with Geobacter sulfurreducens. These tests showed {{on the one hand}} that stainless steel was not well suited for anode material, {{and on the other hand}} that graphite anode could sustain current densities up to 7 A/m² which was seven times higher than figures previously reported in bibliography...|$|R
40|$|Recent {{advances}} in nano-biotechnology {{have made it}} possible to realize a great variety of enzyme electrodes suitable for sensing and energy applications. In coating miniaturized electrodes with enzymes, {{there is no doubt that}} most of the available deposition processes suffer from the difficulty in depositing uniform and reproducible coatings of the active enzyme on the miniature transducer element. This mini-review highlights the promising prospects of two techniques, electrochemical deposition (ECD) and electrophoretic deposition (EPD), in enzyme immobilization onto miniaturized electrodes and their use as biosensors and biofuel cells. The main differences between ECD and EPD are described and highlighted in the sense to make it clear to the reader that both techniques employ electric fields to deposit enzyme but the conditions from which each process is achieved and hence the mechanisms are quite different. Many aspects dealing with deposition of enzyme under ECD and EPD are considered including surface charge of enzyme, its migration under the applied electric field and its <b>precipitation</b> on the <b>electrode.</b> Still all issues discussed in this mini-review are generic and need to be followed in the future by extensive theoretical and experimental research analysis. Finally, the advantages of ECD and EPD in fabrication of miniature biosensor and biofuel cell electrodes are described and discussed. (c) 2014 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R
50|$|The {{alkaline}} {{fuel cell}} used by NASA in 1960s for Apollo and Space Shuttle program generated electricity at nearly 70% efficiency using aqueous solution of KOH as an electrolyte. In that situation, CO2 coming in through oxidant air stream and generated as by product from oxidation of methanol, if methanol is the fuel, reacts with electrolyte KOH forming CO32−/HCO3−. Unfortunately as a consequence, K2CO3 or KHCO3− precipitate on the electrodes. However, this effect has found to be mitigated by the removal of cationic counterions from the electrode, and carbonate formation {{has been found to}} be entirely reversible by several industrial and academic groups, most notably Varcoe. Low-cost CO2 systems have been developed using air as the oxidant source. In alkaline anion exchange membrane fuel cell, aqueous KOH is replaced with a solid polymer electrolyte membrane, that can conduct hydroxide ions. This could overcome the problems of electrolyte leakage and carbonate precipitation, though still taking advantage of benefits of operating a fuel cell in an alkaline environment. In AAEMFCs, CO2 reacts with water forming H2CO3, which further dissociate to HCO3− and CO32−. The equilibrium concentration of CO32−/HCO3− is less than 0.07% and there is no <b>precipitation</b> on the <b>electrodes</b> in the absence of cations (K+, Na+). The absence of cations is, however, difficult to achieve, as most membranes are conditioned to functional hydroxide or bicarbonate forms out of their initial, chemically stable halogen form, and may significantly impact fuel cell performance by both competitively adsorbing to active sites and exerting Helmholtz-layer effects.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{describes}} general {{trends in}} the redox potential and solubility of a dimercaptan, 2, 5,-dimercapto- 1, 3, 4 -thiadiazole (DMcT), and its various derivatives in acetonitrile, and illustrates how these trends manifest in the cyclic voltammetry observed at glassy carbon electrodes. Attention {{is focused on the}} polymerization/depolymerization process-es which are the origins of the excellent charge-storage capabilities of electrodes based on the DMcT family of com-pounds. The extent of oligomerization/polymerization of DMcT at glassy carbon is shown to increase with increasing overpotential and/or oxidation time, as judged from its subsequently observed quasi-stable depolymerization wave. Oxidation of dimer DMcT results in extensive <b>precipitation</b> onto the <b>electrode,</b> relative to that observed for oxidation of monomer DMcT, as expected in light of solubilities observed for those compounds in acetonitrile. The protonation state of the compounds is shown to have a considerable effect on both their solubility and, as reported previously in part, redox potential. Similarly, chemical coupling of the redox processes of these compounds to their protonation state and, for DMcT, to a disproportionation reaction known to occur for its oxidation product(s) complicates analysis of the system as a whole. However, from consideration of all of the observed trends, a general picture emerges illustrating the redox char-acter of DMcT during polymerization and depolymerization. Most importantly, it is shown that the electrochemical irre-versibility typical of those processes can be avoided by careful control of the protonation state and solubility of the elec-troactive species, allowing the measurement of quasi-reversible redox couples. That and other results are discussed {{in the context of the}} use of DMcT in secondary battery electrodes...|$|R
40|$|The {{development}} of novel electrochemical sensors and solid phase on-line derivatisation devices using conducting polymeric materials {{has been investigated}} in this work. Polypyrrole was the material of choice due to its merits over other conducting polymers, particularly the ease of synthesis {{and the ability to}} incorporate a wide range of counterions. Polypyrroles containing a range of chemically active substances have been electrochemically synthesised and their properties characterised using various techniques. Incorporation of the desired substances was verified using elemental analysis, amino acid analysis, fast atom bombardment mass spectrometry (FABMS) and energy dispersive X-ray (EDX) analysis. The electroactivity and conductivity of these polymers were evaluated using chronopotentiometry, cyclic voltammetry and cyclic resistometry. The electrochemical release of counterions, such as anthraquinone- 2, 6 -sulphonic acid (AQSA), dichromate, human serum albumin (HSA) and pyridine- 2, 6 -dicarboxylic acid (PDCA), from polypyrrole polymers has been investigated. It was found that the rate of release of the counterion {{is a function of the}} counterion size, charge and hydrophobicity. The applied potential and the solution conditions (ionic strength, pH, supporting electrolyte and solvent) also affected the rate of release. Polypyrrole was coated onto platinum and thin mercury film electrodes, and the capability of preconcentrating metal ions by complexation and/or <b>precipitation</b> using these <b>electrodes</b> have been investigated. Experimental results demonstrated that polypyrrole modified electrodes were able to chemically preconcentrate silver ions and subsequently generate voltammetric signals. Polypyrrole modified electrodes were also found to enhance selectivity for the detection of dichloramine over other chloramine species. Polypyrroles containing diethyldithiocarbamate (DTC) and aryl sulfatase (AS) have been investigated for use as polymeric reagents in a reactor for on-line derivatisation. The DTC ligands were electrochemically released from the polymer into the eluent to form copper-DTC and nickel-DTC complexes for subsequent detection. Polymer immobilised AS catalysed the derivatisation of p-nitrocatecholsulfate (PNCS) to p-nitrocatechol which enhanced the sensitivity of PNCS detection. This study has indicated that it is possible for polypyrroles containing chemically active substances to be used as electrochemical sensors and solid phase on-line derivatisation devices...|$|R
