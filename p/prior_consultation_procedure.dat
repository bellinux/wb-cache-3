This was controversial among other Mekong River Commission member states Cambodia, Thailand, and Vietnam, who argued that as a mainstream dam, Don Sahong is subject to <b>Prior</b> <b>Consultation</b> under the Mekong River Commission <b>Procedures</b> for Notification, <b>Prior</b> <b>Consultation,</b> and Agreement (PNPCA). [...] Under these procedures, the proponent nation of a mainstream dam is required to not only notify neighbouring countries of its intention, but also to undertake a consultation aimed at reaching consensus with neighbouring states. The Government of Laos has maintained that as the dam site is only on a channel within the mainstream of the river, it {{is not subject to}} the process of <b>Prior</b> <b>Consultation</b> like dams that cover the entire mainstream such as the Xayaburi dam.|$|R

In contrast to the widespread conception that <b>prior</b> <b>consultation</b> is a means for preventing and resolving conflict, it argues that this new legislation will not help to transform conflicts as long as the normative framework itself is contested and the preconditions for participatory governance are not in place. Establishing these preconditions would result in state institutions capable of justly balancing the diverse interests at stake; measures that reduce power asymmetries within consultations; and joint decision-making processes with binding agreements...|$|R

40|$|The {{forestry}} and reindeer herding sectors {{utilize the}} same land in northern Sweden, and adversely affect each other's productivity. The {{common pool resource}} character of this situation has {{made it difficult to}} find ways to resolve conflicts that could threaten the two sectors' continued co-existence. A <b>consultation</b> <b>procedure</b> that was introduced to reduce conflicts {{does not appear to be}} effective, since conflicts between the two actors still occur. One reason for this failure might be found in the power distribution between forestry and reindeer herding. Earlier research has shown that a co-management system in which the allocation of power between the stakeholders is uneven is difficult to maintain in the long term. However, it is unclear just how uneven the power distribution is between the two actors in this case, and the consequences the disparity might have for the viability and stability of the management system. Focusing on the power relations within the <b>consultation</b> <b>procedures,</b> this paper explores the potential of the present institutional system to take the different interests of the stakeholders into account and to use the <b>consultation</b> <b>procedures</b> as tools for co-managing the forest resources in northern Sweden...|$|R
40|$|Background: Open access {{endoscopy}} (OAE) {{implies that}} physicians can refer their patient for colonoscopy without <b>prior</b> <b>consultation</b> by a gastroenterologist. Despite {{the benefits of}} OAE, concern has been raised about {{the increasing number of}} unnecessary colonoscopies. We prospectively studied the effect of consultation carried out by a gastroenterologist prior to the requested colonoscopy, compared with OAE on the number of declined colonoscopies and the assessment of urgency. Secondly, we aimed to evaluate the extent to which <b>prior</b> <b>consultation</b> contributes to complete medication and past medical history of the referral, compared with the OAE application. Methods: Referrals of 255 consecutive patients for colonoscopy were criticized using both an evaluation form for OAE and a consultation of 7, 5 minutes carried out by a gastroenterologist. Statistical analyses were performed using the McNemar Test and the Wilcoxon signed rank test. Results: Declination of direct scheduling of the colonoscopy occurred in 6. 3 % and 11. 4 % of the patients based on OAE and on <b>prior</b> <b>consultation,</b> respectively [P= 0. 02]. Main reasons for declination of colonoscopy by consultation included diagnosis of IBS (20. 7 %), recent performed colonoscopy (10. 3 %) and incorrect surveillance (17. 2 %). Seven of the 16 referrals (43. 8 %) declined by OAE were approved during the consultation. Main reasons (71. 4 %) for approval were missing indications and information on the application form. Based on OAE and consultation 43. 9 % and 25. 5 % of the colonoscopies were marked as urgent, respectively. In 13 of the 224 (5. 8 %) performed colonoscopies a malignancy was found. In addition, this was the case in 6. 3 % and 10. 8 % of the colonoscopies marked as urgent by OAE and consultation, respectively. Both, OAE and <b>prior</b> <b>consultation,</b> showed an association between urgency and malignancy [P< 0. 001]. In 31. 5 % of the referrals, medication noted on the application form was incomplete. However, specified for most relevant groups of medication (insulin and relevant anticoagulants), this was only in 1. 6 % of the cases. In addition, relevant medical history was not mentioned in 54. 9 % of the application forms (abdominal surgery 35. 8 %, cardiac disease 15. 4 %, COPD 3. 1 %, prior malignancy 3. 7 %, diabetes mellitus 3. 0 % and coagulation disorder 0. 6 %). Conclusion: <b>Prior</b> <b>consultation</b> by gastroenterologists is preferable, since it more precisely assesses whether colonoscopy is indicated and consequently could drastically lower the annual amount of unnecessary colonoscopies. In addition, <b>prior</b> <b>consultation</b> gives complete information about past medical history and current medication and it estimates the degree of urgency more precisely. Declination of colonoscopies by reviewing the application forms alone seems not to be safe. Our findings suggest that <b>consultation</b> <b>prior</b> to colonoscopy is a tool to improve the quality and safety of medical care. ...|$|R

40|$|The {{incorporation}} of safety considerations into land-development control decisions associated with nonnuclear hazardous installations {{in a major}} metropolitan planning authority area in the United Kingdom is examined.
