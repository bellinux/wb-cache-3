5|$|Although {{there are}} no records as to the designs of the early steam engines {{produced}} by the Mars Works, Evans's most famous engine design appeared around 1812. Called the Columbian Engine as a patriotic gesture, it {{would prove to be}} the most advanced and successful steam engine design created by Evans—he brought to bear his now extensive experience in designing and building high-pressure steam engines. This horizontally oriented engine allowed the crankshaft and <b>piston</b> <b>rod</b> to work closely together {{at one end of the}} machine, thus reducing the need for a heavy working beam like those required for conventional engines. The <b>piston</b> <b>rod</b> itself was kept working to a straight line while by a new type of linkage wherein two sets of pivoted bars guided the movements of the working bar. This linkage is still known as the Evans straight-line linkage, though it was superseded within a few years by more precise straight line mechanisms. The Columbian was also the culmination of the grasshopper-style of steam engine. Perfected designs like the Columbian saw a popularization of the grasshopper-style and its wide use in a range of applications. In 1813 he made the decision to introduce a condenser to the Columbian design. This significantly cut the running cost to the engine, and at this point his engines were as efficient and powerful as low-pressure Watt-Boulton designs, yet far cheaper to build and smaller in size. Within a year 27 Columbian engines were operating or under construction in applications ranging from sawmilling and grain milling to the manufacturing of paper, wire and wool.|$|E
25|$|The tandem {{compound}} {{first appeared on}} the Erie Railroad in 1867. Like the Vauclain compound, a {{tandem compound}} has each pair of high- and low-pressure cylinders driving a common crosshead, connecting rod and crank; but unlike the Vauclain compound, the cylinders are mounted fore and aft of each other. The rear wall of the forward cylinder is usually the forward wall of the rear cylinder. The <b>piston</b> <b>rod</b> of the rear cylinder {{is connected to the}} crosshead in the usual way, but the forward cylinder may have its <b>piston</b> <b>rod,</b> or rods, in either of two forms: either the <b>piston</b> <b>rod</b> of the rear cylinder is extended forwards to also carry the forward piston; or if the forward cylinder be the low-pressure cylinder (and thus larger in diameter than the high-pressure cylinder behind), it may have two long piston rods which pass above and below, or to either side, of the high-pressure cylinder in order to reach the common crosshead.|$|E
25|$|These terms {{refer to}} the {{orientation}} of the engine cylinder. A vertical cylinder stands vertically with its <b>piston</b> <b>rod</b> operating above (or below) it. A vertical cylinder stands vertically with its <b>piston</b> <b>rod</b> operating above (or below) it. A vertical inverted engine is defined as a vertical cylinder arrangement, with the crankshaft mounted directly below the cylinder(s). With an inclined or horizontal type, the cylinder and piston are positioned at an incline or horizontally. An inclined inverted cylinder is an inverted cylinder operating at an incline. These terms are all generally used in conjunction with the engine types above. Thus, one may have a horizontal direct-acting engine, or an inclined compound double acting engine, etc.|$|E

25|$|Although {{the firm}} still served the textile industry, Murray began to {{consider}} how the design of steam engines could be improved. He wanted to make them simpler, lighter, and more compact. He also wanted the steam engine to be a self-contained unit that could readily be assembled on site with pre-determined accuracy. Many existing engines suffered from faulty assembly, which took much effort to correct. One problem that Murray faced was that James Pickard had already patented the crank and flywheel method of converting linear motion to circular motion. Murray ingeniously got round this difficulty by introducing a hypocycloidal gear. This consisted of a large fixed ring with internal teeth. Around the inside of this ring a smaller gear wheel, with half the outer one's diameter, would roll driven by the <b>piston</b> <b>rod</b> of the steam engine, which {{was attached to the}} gear's rim. As the <b>piston</b> <b>rod</b> moved backwards and forwards in a straight line, its linear motion would be converted into circular motion by the gear wheel. The gear wheel's bearing was attached to a crank on the flywheel shaft. When he used the hypocycloidal gear he was able to build engines that were more compact and lightweight than previous ones. However, Murray ceased to use this type of motion as soon as Pickard's patent expired.|$|E
25|$|In 1889 Samuel M. Vauclain of the Baldwin Locomotive Works {{devised the}} Vauclain {{compound}} locomotive. This design used a double-expansion engine fitted {{into the space}} occupied by a conventional single-expansion engine on the locomotive, using a single piston valve with conventional gear to control both the high- and low-pressure cylinders. The high-pressure cylinder could be placed above or below the low-pressure cylinder, each had its own <b>piston</b> <b>rod</b> connected to a common crosshead, so that one connecting rod and crank was required for each pair of cylinders. Substantial fuel efficiencies were achieved, but maintenance difficulties doomed the type. Most were converted to conventional engines.|$|E

25|$|The {{design of}} {{the action of the}} weapon {{combined}} functions of several different machine guns of the same era. The action consisted of a sliding breech block connected to a rotary crank, which in turn was operated by an off-set connecting rod, driven by the <b>piston</b> <b>rod</b> of the weapon. The feeding system was also unconventional, utilizing a box magazine mounted {{on the left side of}} the gun, holding 10 stripper clips with five rounds each. The stripper clips were fed one at a time through the gun from left to right where the empty clips were ejected (japanese type 11 light machine gun utilised similar feature). It used the rear sight and the barrel of the Krag–Jørgensen rifle.|$|E
25|$|The first {{full-scale}} working railway {{steam locomotive}} {{was built in}} the United Kingdom in 1804 by Richard Trevithick, a British engineer born in Cornwall. This used high-pressure steam to drive the engine by one power stroke. The transmission system employed a large flywheel to even out the action of the <b>piston</b> <b>rod.</b> On 21 February 1804, the world's first steam-powered railway journey in the world took place when Trevithick's unnamed steam locomotive hauled a train along the tramway of the Penydarren ironworks, near Merthyr Tydfil in South Wales. Trevithick later demonstrated a locomotive operating upon a piece of circular rail track in Bloomsbury, London, the Catch Me Who Can, but never got beyond the experimental stage with railway locomotives, not least because his engines were too heavy for the cast-iron plateway track then in use.|$|E
25|$|The side-lever was an {{adaptation}} of the earliest form of steam engine, the beam engine. The typical side-lever engine {{had a pair of}} heavy horizontal iron beams, known as side levers, connected in the centre {{to the bottom of the}} engine with a pin; this connection allowed a limited arc in which the levers could pivot. These levers extended, on the cylinder side, to each side of the bottom of the vertical engine cylinder. A <b>piston</b> <b>rod,</b> connected vertically to the piston, extended out of the top of the cylinder. This rod attached to a horizontal crosshead which, at each end, was connected to vertical rods (known as side-rods). These rods connected down to the levers on each side of the cylinder. This formed the connection of the levers to the piston on the cylinder side of the engine. The other side of the levers (the opposite end of the lever pivot to the cylinder) were connected to each other with a horizontal crosstail. This crosstail in turn connected to and operated a single connecting rod, which turned the crankshaft. The rotation of the crankshaft was driven by the levers which, at the cylinder side, were driven by the piston oscillating vertically.|$|E

500|$|On 21 January 1960, the Settle rail crash, {{which cost}} {{the lives of}} five passengers, was caused when the <b>piston</b> <b>rod,</b> {{cross-head}} and connecting rod of No. 70052 came loose and damaged the opposite line as a freight train was approaching. The locomotive of the freight train was derailed towards 70052's train and tore out the sides of three passenger coaches. Part of the slide assembly was redesigned, and was fitted as the locomotives were routinely [...] "shopped".|$|E
500|$|Bruix made port visits in Spain and Portugal in June {{before another}} <b>piston</b> <b>rod</b> was damaged on the 7th. She began a refit on 20 September that lasted until 4 November that {{modified}} her for {{service as a}} flagship. On 20 November the ship became the flagship of a cruiser division. In 1901 she participated in the annual fleet maneuvers {{with the rest of}} the Northern Squadron. During this training the British steamer [...] collided with the ship, lightly damaging the plating of her armored ram on 27 June. Bilge keels were fitted to Bruix in November–December and she remained at the dockyard until 10 January 1902 to evaluate the operation of her turrets. The ship was assigned to the Atlantic Division in April and visited several Spanish ports during the month and into May.|$|E
500|$|On 18 August 1897, {{together}} with the protected cruiser , she escorted the armored cruiser [...] that carried President Félix Faure on a state visit to Russia. Shortly after departure, Bruix fractured a <b>piston</b> <b>rod</b> in her port engine which forced her to return to port. Her repairs and armament trials lasted until January 1898, although {{the last of the}} trials was not completed until 25 February. Bruix was then assigned to the Far Eastern Squadron where she was based at Saigon, French Indochina until October, although she made a port visit to Manila, the Philippines, on 5 May after the American victory in the Battle of Manila Bay. While returning home in November, she damaged her starboard propeller on the 20th while transiting the Suez Canal. The ship reached Toulon on the 28th and was under repair until January 1899 before rejoining the Northern Squadron on 3 February.|$|E

2500|$|There are two {{definitions}} of a direct-acting engine encountered in 19th-century literature. The earlier definition applies the term [...] "direct-acting" [...] to {{any type of}} engine other than a beam (i.e. walking beam, side-lever or grasshopper) engine. The later definition only uses the term for engines which apply their power directly to the crankshaft via the <b>piston</b> <b>rod</b> and/or connecting rod. Unless otherwise noted, this article uses the later definition.|$|E

2500|$|Before the {{development}} of the double acting piston, the linkage to the beam and the <b>piston</b> <b>rod</b> had been by means of a chain, which meant that power could only be applied in one direction, by pulling. This was effective in engines that were used for pumping water, but the double action of the piston meant that it could push as well as pull. This was not possible as long as the beam and the rod were connected by a chain. Furthermore, {{it was not possible to}} connect the <b>piston</b> <b>rod</b> of the sealed cylinder directly to the beam, because while the rod moved vertically in a straight line, the beam was pivoted at its centre, with each side inscribing an arc. To bridge the conflicting actions of the beam and the piston, Watt developed his parallel motion. This masterpiece of engineering uses a four bar linkage coupled with a pantograph to produce the required straight line motion much more cheaply than if he had used a slider type of linkage. [...] He was very proud of his solution.|$|E
2500|$|The {{engine is}} a uniflow design with four poppet-type exhaust valves in the {{cylinder}} head. For maintenance, a power assembly, {{consisting of a}} cylinder head, cylinder liner, piston, piston carrier, and <b>piston</b> <b>rod,</b> can be individually and relatively easily and quickly replaced. The block is made from flat, formed and rolled structural steel members and steel forgings welded into a single structure (a [...] "weldment"). Blocks may, therefore, be easily repaired, if required, using conventional shop tools. Each bank of cylinders has an overhead camshaft which operates the exhaust valves and the unit injectors.|$|E
