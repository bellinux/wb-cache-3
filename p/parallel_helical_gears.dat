50|$|The angled teeth engage more {{gradually}} than do {{spur gear}} teeth, {{causing them to}} run more smoothly and quietly. With <b>parallel</b> <b>helical</b> <b>gears,</b> each pair of teeth first make contact at a single point at {{one side of the}} gear wheel; a moving curve of contact then grows gradually across the tooth face to a maximum, then recedes until the teeth break contact at a single point on the opposite side. In spur gears, teeth suddenly meet at a line contact across their entire width, causing stress and noise. Spur gears make a characteristic whine at high speeds. For this reason spur gears are used in low-speed applications and in situations where noise control is not a problem, and helical gears are used in high-speed applications, large power transmission, or where noise abatement is important. The speed is considered high when the pitch line velocity exceeds 25 m/s.|$|E

However, the direct computation of the transmission error requires a 3 -dimensional contact analysis with correct gear geometry, which is impractically computationally intense. Therefore, a simplified representation of the transmission error is desired, a so-called meta-model, is developed. The model is based on response surface method, and the coefficients of the angle-dependent transmission error are dependent on shaft eccentricity (parallel misalignment), shaft bending (angular misalignment), torque and speed. <b>Parallel</b> spur <b>gear,</b> <b>helical</b> <b>gear</b> and planetary gear are studied, with parameters for wind turbine applications is considered and Abaqus 6. 12 - 1 {{is used for the}} development of the meta-models.

40|$|Abstract. The two gears of {{the double}} circular-arc <b>helical</b> <b>gear</b> is a mesh of a concave/convex combination. Because the {{curvature}} is close to each other, the strength also increased and thus, it is often used in heavily-loaded workplaces. The national standard for double circular-arc <b>helical</b> <b>gear</b> (ex., GB 12759 - 91) {{is based on the}} size of the gear module to design its tooth profile. This shows that tooth geometric-related designs are quite complicated. If the effect of the different pressure angle parameter is considered, we would be unable to conduct relevant studies for the original standard formula with a double circular-arc <b>helical</b> <b>gear</b> set at a pressure angle of 24 °. Firstly, this paper would redefine a new double circular-arc <b>helical</b> <b>gear</b> according to the discontinuousness tooth profile molded line {{of the double}} circular-arc <b>helical</b> <b>gear</b> and unchangeable pressure angle and explain the improvements in the design and stress analysis of the tooth especially since the double circular-arc <b>helical</b> <b>gear</b> has no limitation in the minimum number of teeth. Thus, the decrease in the driving gears’ number of module and can further increase the reduction gear ratio. For heavily-loaded planetary gear reducer, it’s quite obvious in the miniaturizing and high torque superiority.

40|$|<b>Helical</b> <b>gears</b> {{are widely}} used in {{gearboxes}} due to its low noise and high load carrying capacity, {{but it is difficult}} to diagnose their early faults based on the signals produced by condition monitoring systems, particularly when the gears rotate at low speed. In this paper, a new concept of Root Mean Square (RMS) value calculation using angle domain signals within small angular ranges is proposed. With this concept, a new diagnosis algorithm based on the time pulses of an encoder is developed to overcome the difficulty of fault diagnosis for <b>helical</b> <b>gears</b> at low rotational speeds. In this proposed algorithm, both acceleration signals and encoder impulse signal are acquired at the same time. The sampling rate and data length in angular domain are determined based on the rotational speed and size of the gear. The vibration signals in angular domain are obtained by re-sampling the vibration signal of the gear in the time domain according to the encoder pulse signal. The fault features of the <b>helical</b> <b>gear</b> at low rotational speed are then obtained with reference to the RMS values in small angular ranges and the order tracking spectrum following the Angular Domain Synchronous Average processing (ADSA). The new algorithm is not only able to reduce the noise and improves the signal to noise ratio by the ADSA method, but also extract s the features of <b>helical</b> <b>gear</b> fault from the meshing position of the faulty gear teeth, hence overcoming the difficulty of fault diagnosis of <b>helical</b> <b>gears</b> rotating at low speed.
