It {{was found that the}} system had developed as a notable alternative to conventional bookstores. One cannot equate public bookcases with classic <b>peer-to-peer</b> <b>exchange,</b> but they certainly represent the voluntary transfer of goods. Surveyed users also indicated that they believed that regular use of public bookcases could function as an example for similar schemes for other desirable goods. This acceptance has led to a rapid dissemination of public bookshelves throughout Germany. It has been found that durable construction and storm-resistance promote sustained use.|$|E

50|$|Sharing {{economy is}} an {{umbrella}} term {{with a range}} of meanings, often used to describe economic and social activity involving online transactions. Originally growing out of the open-source community to refer to peer-to-peer based sharing of access to goods and services, the term is now sometimes used in a broader sense to describe any sales transactions that are done via online market places, even ones that are business to business (B2B), rather than peer-to-peer. For this reason, the term sharing economy has been criticised as misleading, some arguing that even services that enable <b>peer-to-peer</b> <b>exchange</b> can be primarily profit-driven. However, many commentators assert that the term is still valid as a means of describing a generally more democratized marketplace, even when it's applied to a broader spectrum of services.|$|E

50|$|Shipment Miles. These include Food miles, and {{transportation}} miles {{that are used}} consistently in industrial processes. As illustrated the <b>peer-to-peer</b> <b>exchange</b> site, swapexchange, distance is {{a significant factor in}} not only the costs of a product, but also its non-renewable (and gradual renewable) energy depletion impact. The concept of shipment Miles shows that globalized trade should be minimized for daily purchases(i.e.: daily food), and reduced as much as possible for infrequent purchases(i.e.: Electronics). In the past, the limited recycling infrastructure and value of transportation energy resources has limited recycling circuits. Because recycling materials required new infrastructure as well as transportation resources, there was limited cycle development. There were also worries that materials would be downcycled. Non-renewable miles will become inherently unsustainable as non-renewable fuel sources diminishes and becomes increasing controversial as an environmentally destructive resource. The need for fuel efficient transportation methods has been recognized by the EPA and implemented through their SmartWay program.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. This paper depicts an {{initiative}} to deploy an online <b>peer-to-peer</b> <b>exchange</b> {{system for a}} community network of single parents – {{a group of people}} in need of goods, services, and social support in their local neighborhoods. We apply participant observation and semi-structured interviews to uncover key issues that can hinder the emergence of sharing practices in local community networks of this type. Our study illustrates how pressures related to single parenthood can impede opportunities to engage in <b>peer-to-peer</b> <b>exchange,</b> even when community members view the social and material benefits of participation as desirable and necessary. This complicates the prevalent narrative that local <b>peer-to-peer</b> <b>exchange</b> systems are an accessible and convenient alternative to traditional markets. Moreover, we discuss our collaboration with the community as well as the developers of the sharing platform, highlighting the challenges of user-centered design in the sharing economy...|$|E

The explorative approach provided me material for the retrospective reflection to achieve this ambition. The thesis project consisted three iterations, one experiment, and a literature overview.
