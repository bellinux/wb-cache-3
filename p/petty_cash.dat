5|$|During {{the first}} Beatles' flight to America Epstein was offered {{numerous}} samples of products by merchandisers who required a licence {{to be allowed}} to sell them such as clocks, pens, plastic wigs, bracelets, and games. Epstein rejected all of them; directing the merchandisers to Byrne instead, who was already in New York ensconced in The Drake Hotel on Park Avenue at 56th Street. Byrne rented expensive offices on Fifth Avenue, hiring two limousines (on 24-hour standby) and a helicopter to fly clients to and from the airport, insisting that only the presidents of merchandising companies were allowed to talk directly with him, or with his partner, Lord Eliot, who helped to promote the company name with use of his title. Eliot would later recall going to the Seltaeb office {{once or twice a week}} to draw $1,000 from <b>petty</b> <b>cash.</b>|$|E

25|$|One of {{the early}} {{problems}} for the Unit was the difficulty in sourcing film stock. At the time, the only wildlife cameramen were amateurs, and the footage wasn't always good enough for broadcast. The embryo unit's first film camera, a clockwork Bolex, was bought from a Bristol camera shop with <b>petty</b> <b>cash</b> by Desmond's assistant, Tony Soper. Some of Scott's own expedition films were used for early episodes of Look. One particularly outstanding film from 1955, shot by Heinz Sielmann, showed woodpeckers inside a nest hole.|$|E

500|$|Official records {{released}} into the public domain on 4 January 2005 {{as part of the}} Freedom of Information Act 2000 only date back to 3 June 1929, when A.E. Banham at the Treasury authorised the Office Keeper [...] "to spend 1d a day from <b>petty</b> <b>cash</b> towards the maintenance of an efficient cat". In April 1932, the weekly allowance was increased to 1s 6d. By the twenty-first century, the mouser was costing £100 per annum. The cats do not necessarily belong to the Prime Minister in residence and it is rare for the Chief Mouser's term of office to coincide with that of a Prime Minister. The cat with the longest known tenure at Downing Street is Wilberforce, who served for thirteen years under Edward Heath, Harold Wilson, Jim Callaghan, and Margaret Thatcher.|$|E

The concert was recorded and later released as The 30th Anniversary Concert Celebration (1993). Young later recruited this line up of Booker T. and the M.G's, to tour with him and record as his studio band.|$|R
500|$|Feeling {{as though}} he were [...] "constantly trying to prove myself", Beck {{suffered}} a backlash, with skeptics denouncing him as a self-indulgent fake and the latest marketing opportunity. In the summer of 1994, Beck was struggling and many of his fellow musicians thought he had lost his way. Combined with the song's wildly popular music video and the world tour, Beck reacted believing the attention could not last, resulting in a status as a [...] "one-hit wonder". At other concerts, crowds were treated to twenty minutes of reggae or Miles Davis or jazz-punk iterations of [...] "Loser". At one-day festivals in California, he surrounded himself with an artnoise combo. The drummer set fire to his cymbals; the lead guitarist [...] "played" [...] his char with the strings faced towards his body; and Beck changed the words to [...] "Loser" [...] so that nobody could sing along. [...] "I can't tell you how many times I was looking at faces that were looking back at me with complete bewilderment—or just pointing and shaking their heads and laughing—while performing during that period," [...] he later recalled. Despite this, Beck gained the respect of his peers, such as Tom <b>Petty</b> and Johnny <b>Cash,</b> and created an entire wave of bands determined to recapture the Mellow Gold sound. Feeling his previous releases were just collections of demos recorded {{over the course of several}} years, Beck desired to enter the studio and record an album in a continuous linear fashion, which became Odelay.|$|R
500|$|The {{introduction}} of sound had driven costs higher: by 1930, the average U.S. feature film cost $375,000 to produce. A {{broad range of}} motion pictures occupied the B category. The leading studios made not only clear-cut A and B films, but also movies classifiable as [...] "programmers" [...] (also known as [...] "in-betweeners" [...] or [...] "intermediates"). As Taves describes, [...] "Depending on {{the prestige of the}} theater and the other material on the double bill, a programmer could show up at the top or bottom of the marquee." [...] On Poverty Row, many Bs were made on budgets that would have barely covered <b>petty</b> <b>cash</b> on a major's A film, with costs {{at the bottom of the}} industry running as low as $5,000. By the mid-1930s, the double feature was the dominant U.S. exhibition model, and the majors responded. In 1935, B movie production at Warner Bros. was raised from 12 to 50 percent of studio output. The unit was headed by Bryan Foy, known as the [...] "Keeper of the Bs". At Fox, which also shifted half of its production line into B territory, Sol M. Wurtzel was similarly in charge of more than twenty movies a year during the late 1930s.|$|E
2500|$|After the war, Newhart {{worked for}} United States Gypsum as an accountant. He later {{said that his}} motto, [...] "That's close enough" [...] and his habit of {{adjusting}} <b>petty</b> <b>cash</b> imbalances with his own money shows {{he did not have}} the temperament to be an accountant. He also said he was a clerk in the unemployment office who made $55 a week, but who quit upon learning unemployment benefits were $45 a week and he [...] "only had to come in to the office one day a week to collect it." ...|$|E

Though {{not close to}} Wang Da Zhi, he gives him a hard time when he misunderstood Da Zhi for {{going back to the}} triads. But shows his braveness and loyalty when he protects Da Zhi when Da Zhi's triad boss comes to the restaurant to cause trouble. He likes to convince his co-workers to contribute into the employee <b>petty</b> <b>cash</b> fund only to secretly take from it to help support the elderly people that raised him.|$|E
2500|$|This time, Griffith's gamble {{paid off}} and he succeeded in {{establishing}} his printing works in Middle Abbey Street, {{across the street from}} the Freeman's Journal and the newspaper wholesalers Eason & Son. The financial health of the SFPP remained, however, extremely fragile as payments for debentures trickled in over a six-year period. These sums came in handy for <b>petty</b> <b>cash</b> and to pay small bills but could not be used for any long-term investment. Griffith was therefore forced to make the daily newspaper as attractive as possible for the greatest number of readers, what might be called [...] "tabloidisation" [...] today. In contrast with the austerity of Griffith's previous publications, the Sinn Féin Daily was abundantly illustrated with cartoons, photographs and maps. We find large tables of national statistics, articles on industry or the language movement, and extracts from the Resurrection of Hungary side by side with descriptions of the latest Paris fashions, serialised novels and sensational news gleaned from the international press. It is a measure of Griffith's understanding of the market and his skill as an editor that the circulation of the two newspapers reached 64,515 during the month which followed the launch of the daily.|$|E
2500|$|Porter {{served for}} four years as the chief {{engineer}} under guitarist and producer Atkins. Porter became the engineer big-name artists wanted to work with, and he was influential in creating the Nashville sound. Record producer Owen Bradley once asked Atkins how he got his sound, and Atkins said, [...] "it was Bill Porter." [...] He recorded more than 579 records that charted—49 were top 10, 11 were number one, and 37 were certified gold records. Most were recorded at what is now RCA's Studio B in Nashville, where Porter {{was responsible for the}} sound. (At the time, there was only one studio, with no letter designation. In 1964, a more modern studio was added to the building, and the earlier one became known as [...] "Studio B".) The studio's acoustics were problematic, with resonant room modes creating an uneven frequency response. To lessen the problem, Porter took $60 from the studio's <b>petty</b> <b>cash</b> and bought [...] fiberglass acoustic ceiling panels which he and Tommy Strong, his assistant engineer, cut into triangles and hung from the ceiling at varying heights; these were called [...] "Porter Pyramids".|$|E
2500|$|In 2010, a {{commission}} chaired by Sir Thomas Legg demanded Murphy repay £577.46 in expenses {{which he had}} overclaimed. He did not appeal, and repaid the money in full. Expenses documents made available showed he also claimed over one million pounds between 2001 and 2012. In 2007/8 he claimed £3,900 for food, £2,284 for <b>petty</b> <b>cash</b> and £4,884 for a new bathroom. He claimed £249 for a TV set and a further £99 for a TV stand; £1762.50 of taxpayers money paid for Murphy's website whilst further claims included Labour party adverts in the local press. He claimed almost £2000 of public cash to pay private accountants to handle his tax returns. In 2012 Murphy was {{among a group of}} 27 MPs named as benefiting from up to £20,000 per year expenses to rent accommodation in London, {{at the same time as}} letting out property they owned in the city. Although the practice did not break rules, it has been characterised as a [...] "loophole" [...] that allows politicians to profit from Commons allowances. He also designated his constituency home in Glasgow as his second home for which he claimed £780 a month in mortgage interest payments in 2007/8. Murphy had previously apologised [...] "on behalf of all politicians" [...] for the expenses scandal in 2009.|$|E

A broad range of Hollywood motion pictures occupied the B-movie category: The leading studios made not only clear-cut A and B films, but also movies classifiable as [...] "programmers" [...] (also [...] "in-betweeners" [...] or [...] "intermediates").

Loew's, the parent company of MGM, announced in 1935 that it would run double features at all of its subsequent-run theaters. A low-cost production unit was established at the studio under Lucien Hubbard, [...] "although the term B movie was strictly taboo at Metro." [...] Columbia, which primarily served the B-movie market, expanded annual production from thirty pictures to more than forty.|$|E

60|$|Twenty-five {{days later}} a {{telegram}} came to Conroy's rooms: 'Notice given. Waterloo again. Twenty-fourth.' That same evening he was wakened by the shudder and the sigh that {{told him his}} sentence had gone forth. Yet he reflected on his pillow that he had, in spite of lapses, snatched something like three weeks of life, which included several rides on a horse before breakfast--the hour one most craves Najdolene; five consecutive evenings on the river at Hammersmith in a tub where he had well stretched the white arms that passing crews mocked at; a game of rackets at his club; three dinners, one small dance, and one human flirtation with a human woman. More notable still, he had settled his month's accounts, only once confusing <b>petty</b> <b>cash</b> with the days of grace allowed him. Next morning he rode his hired beast in the park victoriously. He saw Miss Henschil on horse-back near Lancaster Gate, talking {{to a young man}} at the railings.|$|E

It all looks like work. But you'll find the best way is to wait till you get a couple of dozen or so, and then work them off in a batch. But if you see Rossiter about, then start stamping something or writing something, or he'll run you in for neglecting your job. He's a nut. I'm jolly glad I'm under old Waller now. He's the pick of the bunch. The other heads of departments are all nuts, and Bickersdyke's the nuttiest of the lot. Now, look here. This is all you've got to do.

6000|$|Nay, {{you might}} answer, {{speaking}} for them--'We {{do not let}} these wars come to pass for our play, nor by our carelessness; we cannot help them. How can any final quarrel of nations be settled otherwise than by war?' I cannot now delay, {{to tell you how}} political quarrels might be otherwise settled. But grant that they cannot. Grant that no law of reason can be understood by nations; no law of justice submitted to by them: and that, while questions of a few acres, and of <b>petty</b> <b>cash,</b> can be determined by truth and equity, the questions which are to issue in the perishing or saving of kingdoms can be determined only by the truth of the sword, and the equity of the rifle. Grant this, and even then, judge if it will always be necessary for you to put your quarrel into the hearts of your poor, and sign your treaties with peasants' blood. You would be ashamed to do this in your own private position and power. Why should you not be ashamed also to do it in public place and power? If you quarrel with your neighbour, and the quarrel be indeterminable by law, and mortal, you and he do not send your footmen to Battersea fields to fight it out; nor do you set fire to his tenants' cottages, nor spoil their goods. You fight out your quarrel yourselves, and at your own danger, if at all. And you do not think it materially affects the arbitrement that one of you has a larger household than the other; so that, if the servants or tenants were brought into the field with their masters, the issue of the contest could not be doubtful? You either refuse the private duel, or you practise it under laws of honour, not of physical force; that so it may be, in a manner, justly concluded. Now the just or unjust conclusion of the private feud is of little moment, while the just or unjust conclusion of the public feud is of eternal moment: and yet, in this public quarrel, you take your servants' sons from their arms to fight for it, and your servants' food from their lips to support it; and the black seals on the parchment of your treaties of peace are the deserted hearth and the fruitless field. There is a ghastly ludicrousness in this, as there is mostly in these wide and universal crimes. Hear the statement of the very fact of it in the most literal words of the greatest of our English thinkers:-- ...|$|E
50|$|<b>Petty</b> <b>cash</b> imprest {{system allows}} only the {{replenishment}} of the spend made. So, if one starts the month with €100 in one’s <b>petty</b> <b>cash</b> float and spend €90 of that {{cash in the}} month, an amount of €90 will be then placed in one’s <b>petty</b> <b>cash</b> float to bring the balance of your <b>petty</b> <b>cash</b> float back to €100. The replenishment is credited to the primary cash account, usually a bank account (Dr - <b>Petty</b> <b>Cash</b> a/c, Cr - Bank a/c) and the debits {{will go to the}} respective expense accounts, based on the <b>petty</b> <b>cash</b> receipt dockets (Dr - Expense a/c, Cr - <b>Petty</b> <b>Cash</b> a/c)...|$|E
50|$|The imprest system {{ensures that}} one must {{document}} how the <b>petty</b> <b>cash</b> is spent. In a <b>petty</b> <b>cash</b> system, <b>petty</b> <b>cash</b> receipts are written for each amount issued. So, when all of these receipts are totalled {{at the end of}} the month and deducted from the opening <b>petty</b> <b>cash</b> float, the calculated value must agree with what is left in the <b>petty</b> <b>cash</b> float. Under the imprest system, only that which is recorded as spent is replenished. Any shortfalls may have to be replenished by the guardian, usually a bookkeeper, of the <b>petty</b> <b>cash</b> float from their own personal resources.|$|E
50|$|In an imprest {{system the}} amount {{requested}} is documented, the documentation being the <b>petty</b> <b>cash</b> dockets and their associated receipts or invoices.
