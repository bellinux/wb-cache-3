In the pre-2004 EU members, the major problem in transport deals with congestion and pollution. After the recent enlargement, the new states that joined since 2004 added the problem of solving accessibility to the transport agenda. The Polish road network was upgraded such as the A4 autostrada.|$|E

25|$|The {{causes of}} the Great Recession seem similar to the Great Depression, but {{significant}} differences exist. The previous chairman of the Federal Reserve, Ben Bernanke, had extensively studied the Great Depression {{as part of his}} doctoral work at MIT, and implemented policies to manipulate the money supply and interest rates in ways that were not done in the 1930s. Bernanke's <b>policies</b> <b>will</b> undoubtedly be analyzed and scrutinized in the years to come, as economists debate the wisdom of his choices. Generally speaking, the recovery of the world's financial systems tended to be quicker during the Great Depression of the 1930s as opposed to the late-2000s recession.|$|E
25|$|In December 2014, the Polish {{government}} {{will vote on}} a bill which calls for microgeneration, as well as large scale wind farms in the Baltic Sea {{as a solution to}} cut back on co2 emissions from the country's coal plants as well as to reduce Polish dependence on Russian gas. Under the terms of the new bill, individuals and small businesses which generate up to 40kW of 'green' energy will receive 100% of market price for any electricity they feed back into the grid, and businesses who set up large-scale offshore wind farms in the Baltic will be eligible for subsidization by the state.

2500|$|Supporters of PR see coalitions as an advantage, forcing {{compromise}} between parties {{to form a}} coalition at {{the centre of the}} political spectrum, and so leading to continuity and stability. [...] Opponents counter that with many policies compromise is not possible (for example funding a new stealth bomber, or leaving the EU). Neither can many policies be easily positioned on the left-right spectrum (for example, the environment). So policies are horse-traded during coalition formation, with the consequence that voters {{have no way of knowing}} which <b>policies</b> <b>will</b> be pursued by the government they elect; voters have less influence on governments. [...] Also, coalitions do not necessarily form at the centre, and small parties can have excessive influence, supplying a coalition with a majority only on condition that a policy or policies favoured by few voters is/are adopted. Most importantly, the ability of voters to vote a party in disfavour out of power is curtailed.|$|E

50|$|If {{there is}} no {{hysteresis}} in unemployment, then for example if the central bank wishes to lower the inflation rate it may shift to a contractionary monetary policy, which if not fully anticipated and believed will temporarily increase the unemployment rate; if the contractionary policy persists, the unemployment rise will eventually disappear as the unemployment rate returns to the natural rate. Then {{the cost of the}} anti-inflation <b>policy</b> <b>will</b> have been temporary unemployment. But if there is hysteresis, the unemployment rise initiated by the contractionary <b>policy</b> <b>will</b> never completely go away, and in this case the cost of the anti-inflation <b>policy</b> <b>will</b> have been permanently higher unemployment, making the policy less likely to have greater benefits than costs.|$|R
2500|$|Various {{institutions}} have undertaken zero-tolerance policies, for example, in the military, in the workplace, and in schools, {{in an effort}} to eliminate various kinds of illegal behavior, such as harassment. Proponents hope that such <b>policies</b> <b>will</b> underscore the commitment of administrators to prevent such behavior. Others raise a concern about this use of zero-tolerance policies, a concern which derives from analysis of errors of omission versus errors of commission. Here is the reasoning: Failure to proscribe unacceptable behavior may lead to errors of omission—too little will be done. But zero tolerance may be seen as a kind of ruthless management, which may lead to a perception of [...] "too much being done". If people fear that their co-workers or fellow students may be fired, terminated, or expelled, they may not come forward at all when they see behavior deemed unacceptable. (This {{is a classic example of}} Type I and type II errors.) The Type Two error, where it occurs with respect to zero tolerance, leads to the situation where too stringent a policy may actually reduce reports of illegal behavior.|$|E
2500|$|In May 2016, three IMF economists {{published}} {{new research}} findings and criticized {{some of the}} fundamental assumptions of the neoliberal doctrine. They warned that austerity policies could {{do more harm than}} good because of their social costs – increased inequality, which [...] "in turn hurts the level and sustainability of growth". Speaking of capital account liberalization, that is unrestricted movement of capital across international borders ("openness") and fiscal consolidation, meaning policies to reduce fiscal deficits and debt levels ("austerity"), they wrote: [...] "Since both openness and austerity are associated with increasing income inequality, this distributional effect sets up an adverse feedback loop. The increase in inequality engendered by financial openness and austerity might itself undercut growth, the very thing that the neoliberal agenda is intent on boosting. There is now strong evidence that inequality can significantly lower both the level and the durability of growth". [...] Additionally, they recommended actively combating inequality by redistributing wealth via taxes and government spending, noting [...] "the evidence of the economic damage from inequality suggests that policymakers should be more open to redistribution than they are" [...] and [...] "the fear that such <b>policies</b> <b>will</b> themselves necessarily hurt growth is unfounded".|$|E
2500|$|A 2011 report [...] "China's Rare-Earth Industry", {{issued by}} the US Geological Survey and US Department of the Interior, {{outlines}} industry trends within China and examines national policies that may guide {{the future of the}} country's production. The report notes that China's lead in the production of rare-earth minerals has accelerated over the past two decades. In 1990, China accounted for only 27% of such minerals. In 2009, world production was 132,000 metric tons; China produced 129,000 of those tons. According to the report, recent patterns suggest that China will slow the export of such materials to the world: [...] "Owing to the increase in domestic demand, the Government has gradually reduced the export quota during the past several years." [...] In 2006, China allowed 47 domestic rare-earth producers and traders and 12 Sino-foreign rare-earth producers to export. Controls have since tightened annually; by 2011, only 22 domestic rare-earth producers and traders and 9 Sino-foreign rare-earth producers were authorized. The government's future <b>policies</b> <b>will</b> likely keep in place strict controls: [...] "According to China's draft rare-earth development plan, annual rare-earth production may be limited to between 130,000 and 140,000 [...] during the period from 2009 to 2015. The export quota for rare-earth products may be about 35,000 [...] and the Government may allow 20 domestic rare-earth producers and traders to export rare earths." ...|$|E

This {{is due to the fact}} that the introduction of this policy has exacerbated white fears of dispossession and raised black expectations of redress.

Nevertheless, it is argued that this is only prevalent in the short run where as in the long run nation building could be achieved through this programme...|$|R
