5|$|There are {{a variety}} of end uses to weather forecasts. Weather {{warnings}} are important forecasts because they are used to protect life and property. Forecasts based on temperature and precipitation are important to agriculture, and therefore to traders within commodity markets. Temperature forecasts are used by utility companies to estimate demand over coming days. On an everyday basis, people use weather forecasts to determine what to wear on a given day. Since outdoor activities are severely curtailed by heavy rain, snow and wind chill, forecasts can be used to plan activities around these events, and to <b>plan</b> <b>ahead</b> and survive them.

25|$|Adolescents' {{thinking}} is less bound to concrete events {{than that of}} children: they can contemplate possibilities {{outside the realm of}} what currently exists. One manifestation of the adolescent's increased facility with thinking about possibilities is the improvement of skill in deductive reasoning, which leads to the development of hypothetical thinking. This provides the ability to <b>plan</b> <b>ahead,</b> see the future consequences of an action and to provide alternative explanations of events. It also makes adolescents more skilled debaters, as they can reason against a friend's or parent's assumptions. Adolescents also develop a more sophisticated understanding of probability.|$|E

25|$|Dancing en pointe {{stresses}} the feet {{in various ways}} and thus can potentially cause injuries if the dancer does not <b>plan</b> <b>ahead</b> or take into account health and safety concerns. Injuries can result from improper technique, poorly fitting pointe shoes, and lack of effective cushioning and accessories. Some types of injuries are prevented by adhering to proper technique such as correct upper-body positioning, maintaining straight knees when required, keeping body weight centered over the box of the shoes, and avoiding sickling. Problems dealing with technique can be easily fixed by proper training and one-on-one interactions with the dance instructor to improve the dancer's technique.|$|E
25|$|In , Kojima was {{involved}} in the productions of two MSX2 games: a spinoff of Snatcher titled SD Snatcher; and a sequel to Metal Gear titled , which further evolved the stealth game genre. The player had more abilities, such as crouching, crawling into hiding spots and air ducts, distracting guards by knocking on surfaces, and using a radar to <b>plan</b> <b>ahead.</b> The enemies had improved artificial intelligence (AI), including a 45-degree field of vision, the detection of various different noises, being able to move from screen to screen, and a three-phase security alarm. The game also had improved graphics and a complex storyline dealing with themes such as the nature of warfare and nuclear disarmament.|$|E

Then, Isaac Ellwood tossed his hat into the foray.

25|$|Large fruit-eating {{birds in}} {{tropical}} forests depend on trees which bear fruit {{at different times}} of the year. Many species, such as pigeons and hornbills, {{have been shown to be}} able to decide upon foraging areas according to the time of the year. Birds that show food hoarding behavior have also shown the ability to recollect the locations of food caches. Nectarivorous birds such as hummingbirds also optimize their foraging by keeping track of the locations of good and bad flowers. Studies of western scrub jays also suggest that birds may be able to <b>plan</b> <b>ahead.</b> They cache food according to future needs and risk of not being able to find the food on subsequent days.|$|E
25|$|Countries where {{fixed rate}} loans are the {{common form of}} loan for a house {{purchase}} usually {{need to have a}} specific legal framework in place to make this possible. For example, in Germany and Austria the popular Bausparkassen, a type of mutual building societies, offer long-term fixed rate loans. They are legally separate from banks and require borrowers to save up a considerable amount, at a rather low fixed interest rate, before they get their loan; this is done by requiring the future borrower to begin paying in his fixed monthly payments well before actually getting the loan. It is generally not possible to pay this in as a lump sum and get the loan right away; {{it has to be done}} in monthly installments of the same size as what will be paid during the payback phase of the mortgage. Depending on whether there are enough savers in the system at any given time, payout of a loan may be delayed for some time even when the savings quota has already been met by the would-be borrower. The advantage for the borrower is that the monthly payment is guaranteed never to be increased, and the lifetime of the loan is also fixed in advance. The disadvantage is that this model, in which you have to start making payments several years before actually getting the loan, is mostly aimed at once-in-a-lifetime home buyers who are able to <b>plan</b> <b>ahead</b> for a long time. That has become a problem with the generally higher mobility that is demanded of workers nowadays.|$|E
500|$|A New York Times {{article by}} Peter De Jonge {{explained}} that [...] "The West Wing is never plotted {{out for more}} than a few weeks ahead and has no major story lines", which De Jonge believed was because [...] "with characters who have no flaws, it is impossible to give them significant arcs". Sorkin has stated: [...] "I seldom <b>plan</b> <b>ahead,</b> not because I don't think it's good to <b>plan</b> <b>ahead,</b> there just isn't time." [...] Sorkin has also said, [...] "As a writer, I don't like to answer questions until the very moment that I have to." [...] The Seattle Post-Intelligencers TV critic John Levesque has commented that Sorkin's writing process [...] "can make for ill-advised plot developments". Further complicating the matter, in television, Sorkin will have a hand in writing every episode, rarely letting other writers earn full credit on a script. Peter De Jonge has reported that ex-writers of The West Wing have claimed that [...] "even by the spotlight-hogging standards of Hollywood, Sorkin has been exceptionally ungenerous in his sharing of writing credit". In a comment to GQ magazine in 2008, Sorkin said, [...] "I'm helped by a staff of people who have great ideas, but the scripts aren't written by committee." ...|$|E

500|$|The {{children}} who waited longer, when re-evaluated as teenagers and adults, demonstrated a striking array of advantages over their peers.

500|$|The sequel [...] was {{released}} in 1990 for the MSX2. It further evolved the stealth gameplay of its predecessor and introduced most of the gameplay elements present in Metal Gear Solid, including the three-dimensional element of height, allowing players to crouch and crawl into hiding spots and air ducts and underneath desks. The player could also distract guards by knocking on surfaces and use a radar to <b>plan</b> <b>ahead.</b> The enemies had improved AI, including a 45-degree field of vision, turning their heads left and right to see diagonally, the detection of various different noises, being able to move from screen to screen (they were limited to a single screen in earlier games), and a three-phase security alarm (where reinforcements are called in to chase the intruder, then remain {{on the lookout for}} some time after losing sight of the intruder, and then leave the area). The game also had a complex storyline and improved graphics.|$|E

500|$|Each {{episode of}} Twin Peaks was written sequentially; this allowed the overall plot to gather {{momentum}} as it progressed but allowed for the organic process of adding new elements as the writers thought of them; a process favored by series co-creator David Lynch. It also allowed Mark Frost, Lynch's partner in creating the series, to <b>plan</b> <b>ahead</b> to ensure plot details and threads would be revisited as necessary. Deschanel recalls the teleplay for the episode being approximately 40–45 pages long, which he felt offered the show a [...] "leisurely" [...] pace compared to modern television episode, which are filmed from teleplays of up to 120 pages. This allowed the series to dwell on its subtext and unexpressed desires of its characters, rather than focusing solely on narrative action. Deschanel and Peyton have described the episode as exemplifying the need to [...] "be a fan" [...] of the series to fully enjoy it, as the progression {{and development of the}} characters occurs over multiple episodes and rewards the attention of a regular viewer.|$|E
500|$|The {{first season}} of Glee {{consists}} of twenty-two episodes. The pilot episode was originally broadcast on May 19, 2009. The series returned on September 9, 2009, airing an additional twelve episodes on Wednesdays in the 9:00pm timeslot until December 9, 2009, {{for a total}} of thirteen episodes. On September 21, 2009, nine more episodes were ordered for the first season by Fox, and the first of these episodes was broadcast on April 13, 2010. These episodes aired on Tuesday evenings at 9:00pm. On January 11, 2010, it was announced that Fox had commissioned a second season of the show. The second season began production in June 2010. Season two began on September 21, 2010, airing in the 8:00pm time slot on Tuesdays, and consists of twenty-two episodes. The show was chosen by Fox to fill the coveted timeslot that followed the network's coverage of Super Bowl XLV in 2011, and the network originally planned to move the show to the 9:00pm time slot on Wednesdays following the post–Super Bowl broadcast. However, Fox later revised its schedule, leaving Glee on Tuesdays in order to concentrate on building up its weaker Wednesday and Thursday line-ups. A third season was ordered by Fox on May 23, 2010, {{before the end of the}} first season. The early renewal of the show allowed the production team to cut costs and to <b>plan</b> <b>ahead</b> when writing scripts. The third season broadcasts remained in the show's Tuesday 8:00pm time slot, and began airing on September 20, 2011.
