5|$|<b>Perseverance</b> Road, {{and some}} housing, defines {{the western edge}} of much of the park. William Haines was the {{district}} clerk for Tea Tree Gully from 1867 to 1902 and Member of Parliament for Gumeracha from 1878 to 1884. Since 1862, he had lobbied for construction of a road to link Tea Tree Gully to Anstey Hill Road. The 1½ mile road was eventually approved and subsequently opened in 1880. Known as Haines' Folly before its completion, it was officially called Haines' <b>Perseverance</b> Road at the opening ceremony.|$|E

5|$|By {{the end of}} season, Emery {{compiled}} a 15–9–4 record and 2.81 GAA in 34 regular-season appearances, posting a 10–0–3 record and 2.15 GAA in 16 appearances at Chicago's United Center. Emery was again nominated, this time by the Chicago Blackhawks, for the Bill Masterton Memorial Trophy, honoring dedication and <b>perseverance.</b>|$|E
5|$|He far {{exceeded}} doctors' expectations; he was skating {{by the beginning}} of September and was back playing hockey less than four months following the accident. He played a five-game conditioning stint with the Saint John Flames of the American Hockey League in late October before being recalled by the Flames on October 28, 1999. That night, he made his NHL debut against the Ottawa Senators and was praised by his coach, Brian Sutter, for playing a mistake free game. He scored his first NHL goal on November 10 against the San Jose Sharks. Regehr played 57 games for the Flames in 1999–2000, scoring five goals and 12 points. He was the Flames nominee for the Bill Masterton Memorial Trophy, which recognizes <b>perseverance,</b> sportsmanship and dedication to hockey. At the age of 19, he was the youngest nominee in NHL history. The Flames also presented him with the Ralph T. Scurfield Humanitarian Award in honour of his <b>perseverance.</b>|$|E
5|$|Late in the campaign, he was {{selected}} by the Professional Hockey Writers' Association as the Canucks' nominee for the Bill Masterton Memorial Trophy, awarded for <b>perseverance,</b> dedication and sportsmanship. Burrows was not shortlisted for the award, however. Prior to the last game of the season, he received his second consecutive Most Exciting Player Award.|$|E

5|$|The {{football}} season is one focused on growth and reestablishing {{a sense of}} Lion pride. The culmination of their hard work is tested in their last {{game of the season}} as they play the Dillon Panthers led by J.D. McCoy.

5|$|A {{free agent}} when the NHL resumed play in 2005–06, Selänne {{returned}} to Anaheim by signing a one-year, $1 {{million contract with}} the Mighty Ducks. During a resurgent season, he scored his 1,000th career point on January 30, 2006, with a goal in a 4–3 victory over Los Angeles. Selänne completed the season with 40 goals and 90 points, both of which led the Mighty Ducks, and he was named {{the recipient of the}} Bill Masterton Memorial Trophy for dedication and <b>perseverance.</b>|$|E
5|$|Bessas first sent an {{expeditionary force}} to {{suppress}} a rebellion among the Abasgians, who neighboured Lazica to the north. The expedition, under John Guzes, was successful, and the Abasgian leader Opsites {{was forced to}} flee across the Caucasus to the Sabir Huns. In spring 551, after a long siege and thanks largely to his own <b>perseverance</b> and bravery, the Byzantines and their Sabir allies (some 6,000 troops) captured Petra. A few Persians continued to resist from the citadel, but Bessas ordered it torched. Following his victory, he ordered the city walls razed to the ground.|$|E
5|$|By {{what right}} do you dare accuse the nation of... want of <b>perseverance</b> in the emperor's interest? The nation has {{followed}} {{him on the}} fields of Italy, across the sands of Egypt and the plains of Germany, across the frozen deserts of Russia.... The nation has followed him in fifty battles, in his defeats and in his victories, {{and in doing so}} we have to mourn the blood of three million Frenchmen.|$|E
5|$|Emery has {{received}} numerous awards and accolades. In April 2013, {{he won the}} William M. Jennings Trophy along with teammate Corey Crawford, awarded to the goaltender or goaltenders who give up the fewest goals in the season. Emery finished {{the season with a}} 1.94 goals against average and a 0.922 save percentage. His 17 wins included 12 straight to start the year, the best such streak in NHL history. Emery is a two-time Bill Masterton Memorial Trophy finalist for his dedication and <b>perseverance.</b>|$|E
5|$|However, the {{happiness}} of Bobby Dodd's early life came to a sad end in 1924 when his father committed suicide due to business failure and financial troubles. The family was forced to move, but was held together by the <b>perseverance</b> of Dodd's mother. During the next three seasons, the Kingsport Indians were very successful, gaining two state titles. They were helped by Dodd, who moved from receiver to quarterback and kicker. In 1926, Bobby Dodd graduated and {{was admitted to the}} University of Tennessee with a football scholarship.|$|E
5|$|Jim avidly {{read the}} Liverpool Echo or Express, liked solving crosswords and instigated discussions about varied subjects. His {{attitude}} to life {{was based upon}} self-respect, <b>perseverance,</b> fairness and a strong work ethic. His political views were far from left-wing, as he insisted {{that there was nothing}} anyone could do about the situation the working classes were in at the time, and nothing would ever change.|$|E
5|$|The Bill Masterton Memorial Trophy {{is awarded}} {{annually}} to the National Hockey League player who best exemplifies {{the qualities of}} <b>perseverance,</b> sportsmanship, and dedication to ice hockey. It is named after Bill Masterton, the only player in NHL history to die {{as a direct result}} of injuries suffered during a game. The winner is selected by a poll of the Professional Hockey Writers' Association after each team nominates one player in competition. It is often awarded to a player who has come back from career– or even life-threatening illness or injury.|$|E
5|$|After {{graduating from}} Harvard and {{serving in the}} Army during World War I, Tunis began his writing career freelancing for American sports {{magazines}} while playing tennis in the Rivera. For {{the next two decades}} he wrote short stories and articles about sports and education for magazines including Reader's Digest, The Saturday Evening Post and Esquire. Tunis' work often protested the increasing professionalization of sports in America. He believed that amateur participation in sports taught values important for good citizenship like <b>perseverance,</b> fair play and equality, and that the emphasis on professional sports was turning America into a country of spectators. His sports books also tackled current social issues such as antisemitism and racial equality.|$|E
5|$|Frustrated by Parker's <b>perseverance</b> despite {{everything}} that's been inflicted, Osborn publicly reveals that he's alive on Halloween. During the battle that ensues between them, Osborn attempts to kill Parker by impaling his nemesis with his goblin glider. When Reilly sacrifices himself to save Parker (and immediately deteriorates on death as all clones do), Parker realises {{he is actually}} the original. During this same period, Osborn {{may or may not}} have been responsible for the murder or abduction of Peter's newborn daughter, after one of his allies apparently prematurely induces Mary Jane's pregnancy and the stillbirth of the baby.|$|E
5|$|In November 1791, a French convoy sailed from Mahé on {{the short}} journey to Mangalore. The convoy {{included}} two merchant vessels and the frigate Résolue, a 36-gun warship under Captain Callamand. Passing northwards, the convoy soon passed Tellicherry and Cornwallis sent Strachan with Phoenix and <b>Perseverance</b> to stop and inspect the French ships to ensure they were not carrying military supplies. As Smith halted the merchant ships and sent boats to inspect them, Strachan did the same to Résolue, hailing the French captain and placing an officer in a small boat to board the frigate. The French captain was outraged at this violation of his neutrality, and responded by opening fire: British sources suggest that his initial target was the small boat, although Phoenix was the ship most immediately damaged.|$|E
5|$|In short, had Mr. Boulton {{done nothing}} {{more in the}} world than he has {{accomplished}} in improving the coinage, his name would deserve to be immortalised; and if it be considered that this was done in the midst of various other important avocations, and at enormous expense,— for which, at the time, he could have had no certainty of an adequate return,—we shall be at a loss whether most to admire his ingenuity, his <b>perseverance,</b> or his munificence. He has conducted the whole more like a sovereign than a private manufacturer; and the love of fame has always been to him a greater stimulus than the love of gain. Yet it is to be hoped that, even in the latter point of view, the enterprise answered its purpose.|$|E
5|$|In {{the long}} term, however, the British backed Iraq and {{rejected}} an international {{inquiry into the}} killings, fearing that this may provoke further massacres against Christians. They also did not insist on punishing the offenders, who were now seen as heroes by Iraqis. The official British stance was to defend the Iraqi government for its <b>perseverance</b> and patience {{in dealing with the}} crisis and to attribute the massacres to rogue army units. A report on the battle of Dirabun blames the Assyrians, defends the actions of the Iraqi Army, and commends Sidqi as a good officer.|$|E
5|$|One {{of the few}} {{bright spots}} in this stretch was Iginla, who {{captured}} the Rocket Richard and Art Ross Trophies in 2001–02 as NHL goal- and point-scoring champion after scoring 52 goals and 96 points. Iginla again won the Rocket Richard Trophy, tied with Rick Nash and Ilya Kovalchuk, with 41 goals in 2003–04. Another bright spot for the team during this time was defenceman Robyn Regehr who became the youngest nominee ever for the Bill Masterton Memorial Trophy, which recognizes <b>perseverance,</b> sportsmanship and dedication to hockey. Regehr had suffered two broken legs {{in a car accident}} the summer of 1999, but recovered in time to play 57 games at the age of 19.|$|E
5|$|Roberts was {{member of}} Memorial Cup and Minto Cup winning teams as Canadian junior hockey and box {{lacrosse}} champions, respectively. He {{was a first}} round selection of the Calgary Flames, 12th overall, at the 1984 NHL Entry Draft and played ten seasons in Calgary. Roberts {{was a member of}} the Flames' 1989 Stanley Cup championship team and made two of his three NHL All-Star Game appearances as a representative of the team. A serious neck injury forced him to miss the majority of two seasons, and while his return earned him the 1996 Bill Masterton Memorial Trophy for <b>perseverance</b> and dedication to the game, he was forced into retirement following the 1995–96 season.|$|E
5|$|The Hall of Values {{features}} lifelike robotics and dioramas which display incidents from Swaminarayan's life, portraying {{his message}} {{about the importance of}} peace, harmony, humility, service to others and devotion to God. Set in 18th century India, the audience experiences eternal messages gleaned from ancient Hindu culture such as non‐violence, vegetarianism, <b>perseverance,</b> prayers, morality, and family harmony through 15 3-D dioramas which make use of state of the art robotics, fibre optics, light and sound effects, dialogues, and music. The hall also features the world's smallest animatronic robot in the form of Ghanshyam Maharaj, the child form of Swaminarayan.|$|E
5|$|The {{original}} home of Clan MacIntyre is likewise {{the subject of}} conjecture. There is general agreement that the clan arose in the Hebrides, the islands west of the Scottish mainland. Some accounts, however, identify Skye as the ancestral home, while another tradition holds Islay {{to have been the}} locale. The story of how the clan made its way to the mainland and settled along the shore of Loch Etive in the vicinity of Ben Cruachan is again shrouded in myth and magic. It is said that seeking fresh pastures for their cattle they were initially obstructed by a mountain spirit. After testing their <b>perseverance</b> and courage the spirit instructed them to make their new home where the white cow in their herd should first lie down to rest. This site became known as Glen Noe.|$|E
5|$|The teams {{came out}} for the second half, and Rangers began an attack almost immediately. A series of short, quick passes from Marsh and Roger Morgan {{released}} Allen {{but he was not}} quick enough to make something of the chance. A high pass from Keen followed, striking defender Clarke in the back, from which the Albion defence were forced to clear. The attacks continued to come from Rangers as Lazarus passed the ball through to Marsh who took the ball around two defenders, but his shot went over the bar. QPR were rewarded for their <b>perseverance</b> in the sixty-third minute as Lazarus took the ball around Albion captain Graham Williams, crossing the ball in for Morgan, who scored with a header to reduce the deficit to a single goal.|$|E
5|$|From 1936 on, several admirers {{tried unsuccessfully}} to persuade Sorabji to record Opus clavicembalisticum. Given that Sorabji had not {{recorded}} any of his works, and {{that none of them}} had been published since 1931, his friends and admirers began {{to be concerned about the}} fate of his output. The most ambitious attempt to ensure the preservation of his music and writings was initiated by Frank Holliday (1912–1997), who met Sorabji in 1937 and was his closest friend for about four decades. In the early 1950s Holliday organised the presentation of a letter inviting Sorabji to make recordings of his own music. Sorabji received the letter in 1953, but made no recordings then, in spite of the enclosed cheque for 121 guineas (just over £127). Holliday's <b>perseverance</b> and closeness to Sorabji did, however, eventually change Sorabji's attitude, and several recordings were made in Sorabji's house between 1962 and 1968. Holliday also helped with the WNCN broadcast of Sorabji's music in 1970 (which took place without Sorabji's consent). Their friendship ended in 1979 as a result of disagreements about some of Sorabji's decisions.|$|E
5|$|Prior to the 2001–02 season, {{the club}} {{announced}} that captain Saku Koivu {{had been diagnosed}} with non-Hodgkin lymphoma and would miss the entire season. Koivu managed to return with three games left in the regular season, and along with goaltender Jose Theodore, who would win the Hart Trophy that year, led the Canadiens into the playoffs {{for the first time in}} four seasons. The eighth-seeded Canadiens upset the Boston Bruins in the first round of the playoffs, and Koivu led the team in playoff scoring with 10points in 12games. In recognition of his tenacity in returning from cancer treatment, the league voted Koivu as the Bill Masterton Memorial Trophy winner for dedication and <b>perseverance.</b> However, in the second round of the playoffs, the team was defeated by the Carolina Hurricanes in six games. The Canadiens finished fourth in the Northeast Division in the 2002-03 season, missing the playoffs by six points. After the Habs finished with a record of 18–19–5–4 in the first 48 games of the 2002–03 season, the team replaced Therrien with Claude Julien.|$|E
5|$|The North American {{version of}} Wild Guns {{was set to}} be {{released}} {{in the third quarter of}} 1994 and was reviewed at the time, but the release was unexpectedly delayed until the third quarter of 1995. Reviewers at Electronic Gaming Monthly cited the cooperative multiplayer mode and challenging levels as the game's strongest points. They declared it one of the best shooters on the SNES and compared it to the Neo Geo game NAM-1975. GamePro praised the game for its intense action, fun cooperative multiplayer mode, colorful graphics, and ability to shoot almost any on-screen object. They remarked that the game is difficult even on easy, but that players are rewarded for <b>perseverance.</b> Nintendo Power found the game to have good graphics and control, and complimented the presence of both male and female playable characters. However, they believed the game was not as challenging as other shooters. A 32X version was reportedly planned for 1996, but never materialized.|$|E
5|$|The RAAF's Chinook fleet {{suffered}} two serious accidents. On 26 June 1975, A15-011 crashed {{when one}} of its engine turbines disintegrated. No. 3 Aircraft Depot was assigned responsibility for repairing the helicopter, {{but it did not}} reenter service until 21 May 1981 as the maintenance unit lacked experience with major helicopter repairs. On 4 February 1985, A15-001 struck power lines and crashed into <b>Perseverance</b> Dam near Toowoomba, Queensland, while undertaking a navigation exercise. The helicopter's pilot, an exchange officer from the Royal Air Force, was killed and the other three aircrew suffered minor injuries. The helicopter was written off and used as a fire training aid at Amberley. The court of inquiry into this incident found that the air crew were unaware of the presence of the power lines as they were not marked on the maps used to plan the flight, and were difficult to see. However, the inquiry also judged that the mission had been inadequately planned and recommended that No. 12 Squadron update the master map used for preparing operations in the Amberley region to ensure that it included all flying hazards.|$|E
5|$|The {{historic}} Ellis Cottage and Rumps Bakery buildings lie {{near the}} corner of <b>Perseverance</b> and North East roads. Built in 1854, Ellis Cottage is a single room stone building built by John Stevens, founder of Steventon Estate that later become the suburb of Tea Tree Gully. It was named after the Ellis family, who owned and used the building for storage for many years until World War II. Rumps Bakery was built in 1854 with local stone. From 1867 to 1893 it was rented to Charles Rumps, who started Tea Tree Gully's first bakery in the building in 1872. In 1894, the building was sold to Ernest Heitmann, who continued {{to use it as}} a bakery. Until the mid-20th century, the Ellis family and an adjacent general store frequently used it for storage. Assisted by a government grant and supervised by the Department of Environment and Heritage, the Friends of Anstey Hill stabilised both buildings in 2000.|$|E
