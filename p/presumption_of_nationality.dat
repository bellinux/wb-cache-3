50|$|In the United States, {{a trusted}} {{traveler}} card, such as NEXUS, {{is a valid}} secured document under the Western Hemisphere Travel Initiative and may be used by itself to reenter the United States from Canada, including by air. Although the card creates a <b>presumption</b> <b>of</b> <b>nationality,</b> neither US nor Canadian law views the NEXUS card as full proof of citizenship. NEXUS cards issued after September 2010 are accepted as proof of citizenship (if the card holder is a citizen of either country), and the traveler is no longer required to carry the passport if traveling by land only. However, airport documentation checks can and do require presentation of a passport {{in addition to the}} NEXUS card {{in the event of a}} secondary inspection.|$|E
5000|$|German {{passports}} {{are issued}} to nationals of Germany {{for the purpose}} of international travel. A German passport is, besides the German ID card and the German Emergency Travel Document (called [...] "Reiseausweis als Passersatz"), the only other officially recognised document that German authorities will routinely accept as proof of identity from German citizens. Besides serving as proof <b>of</b> identity and <b>presumption</b> <b>of</b> German <b>nationality,</b> they facilitate the process of securing assistance from German consular officials abroad (or other EU-members in the case that a German consular facility is absent). German passports are valid for ten years (for people older than 24) or six years (for people until the age of 24) and share the standardised layout and burgundy red design with other EU passports. Every German citizen is also a citizen of the European Union. The passport, along with the national identity card allows for free rights of movement and residence in any of the states of the European Union and European Economic Area.|$|R
50|$|De facto travel {{documents}} are documents which in practice will {{be sufficient to}} cross borders legally, but with no legal status as a travel document. Within the Border Controls in the Common Travel Area, travel between Ireland, the United Kingdom, the British Crown Dependencies, Isle of Man and Channel Islands, no travel {{documents are}} required by British or Irish citizens. As this requirement does not hold for others, these citizens have to establish the <b>presumption</b> <b>of</b> having this <b>nationality,</b> which requires in practice some form of identification. The documents {{used for this purpose}} (most notably: driving licence) are thus de facto travel documents. Some airlines still require passport from CTA citizens.|$|R

40|$|Preliminary draft) Fighting {{tax evasion}} is costly {{for the tax}} {{authorities}} as individual actions are hid-den. Without monitoring, sel 8 ̆ 5 sh agents will underreport their true income. Thus, when auditing is costly partial, random audits are implemented to deter evaders from cheating. In this paper we investigate two alternative mechanisms based on: random auditing: <b>presumption</b> <b>of</b> innocence or <b>presumption</b> <b>of</b> guilt schemes. Theses sym-metric schemes are based: on aggregate disclosure of tax evasion existence, collective nes and random audits. We experimentally test their e ¢ ciency to lessens tax eva-sion and conclude the <b>presumption</b> <b>of</b> guilt scheme shows even better results than the <b>presumption</b> <b>of</b> guilt scheme...|$|R

40|$|There has {{recently}} been a proliferation of case law dealing with potential inroads into the <b>presumption</b> <b>of</b> innocence in the criminal law of England and Wales, {{in the light of}} article 6 (2) of the European Convention on Human Rights.

The first is how the courts should address the question <b>of</b> when the <b>presumption</b> <b>of</b> innocence is interfered with.

40|$|This article’s primary {{aim is to}} {{highlight}} the essentially critical potential <b>of</b> the <b>presumption</b> <b>of</b> innocence, {{as well as the}} need for this critical potential to be duly recognized. It is argued that the essential meaning <b>of</b> the <b>presumption</b> <b>of</b> innocence is best understood when approached from what is referred to as its counterfactual status. As a first step, the different values and functions that are attributed to the <b>presumption</b> <b>of</b> innocence in contemporary legal literature are discussed, in order to provide an outline of the central ideas it contains or is supposed to contain. Subsequently, the concept of ‘counterfactuality’ is introduced and it is argued that a counterfactual perspective can further clarify the nature <b>of</b> the <b>presumption</b> <b>of</b> innocence. Next, a number of fundamental shifts in society and criminal justice are discussed that affect the <b>presumption</b> <b>of</b> innocence and that lend a large measure of urgency to disclosing its essence and critical potential. The conclusion argues that today’s threats to the <b>presumption</b> <b>of</b> innocence are of a fundamental nature, and that attempts to preserve the principle’s efficacy should focus on the value attached to its counterfactual and critical nature...|$|R

2500|$|One of Anthony Flew's most {{influential}} professional works was his 1976 The <b>Presumption</b> <b>of</b> Atheism in which Flew forwarded {{the proposition that}} the question of God's existence should begin with the <b>Presumption</b> <b>of</b> Atheism:"What I want to examine is the contention that the debate about the existence of God should properly begin from the <b>presumption</b> <b>of</b> atheism, that the onus of proof must lie upon the theist. The word 'atheism', however, has in this contention to be construed unusually. Whereas nowadays the usual meaning of 'atheist' in English is 'someone who asserts {{that there is no such}} being as God, I want the word to be understood not positively but negatively... in this interpretation an atheist becomes: not someone who positively asserts the non-existence of God; but someone who is simply not a theist.The introduction of this new interpretation of the word 'atheism' may appear to be a piece of perverse Humpty-Dumptyism, going arbitrarily against established common usage. 'Whyever', it could be asked, don't you make it not the <b>presumption</b> <b>of</b> atheism but the <b>presumption</b> <b>of</b> agnosticism?Flew's proposal to change his profession's use of the term atheism saw limited acceptance in the 20th century, but in the early 21st century Flew's negative sense of 'atheism' came to be forwarded more commonly. The impact of Flew's proposed negative atheism, which is often referred to today as 'weak atheism' or 'soft atheism', is illustrated by analytic Philosopher William Lane Craig's 2007 assessment that the <b>Presumption</b> <b>of</b> Atheism had become [...] "one of the most commonly proffered justifications of atheism." [...] And BBC journalist William Crawley 2010 analysis: [...] "The <b>Presumption</b> <b>of</b> Atheism (1976) made the case, now followed by today's new atheism, that atheism should be the ... default position". In recent debates, atheists often forward the <b>Presumption</b> <b>of</b> Atheism referring to atheism as the [...] "default position" [...] or has [...] "no burden of proof" [...] or asserting that the burden of proof rests solely on the theist.|$|R
