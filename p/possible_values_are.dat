Categorical variables with more than two <b>possible</b> <b>values</b> <b>are</b> called polytomous variables; categorical variables are often assumed to be polytomous unless otherwise specified. Discretization is treating continuous data {{as if it were}} categorical. Dichotomization is treating continuous data or polytomous variables as if they were binary variables.
