We had no loss of reduction before healing of the osteotomy gap which occurred after a mean time of 13  weeks. There was no case of infection, implant failure, loss of reduction, delayed union or non-union. However, when the correction of the angle was greater and consequently the osteotomy gap wider, the time for complete union was longer. Even for duration of 24  weeks, the double-dorsal-locked <b>plates</b> <b>construction</b> proved stable enough to maintain the reduction.

40|$|International audienceSample {{homogenization}} is {{an essential}} step for genomic DNA extraction, with multiple downstream applications in Molecular Biology. Genotyping {{hundreds or thousands of}} samples requires an automation of this homogenization step, and high throughput homogenizer equipment currently costs 7000 euros or more. We present an apparatus for homogenization of individual Drosophila adult flies in 96 -well micro-titer dishes, which was built from a small portable paint-shaker (F 5 portable paint-shaker, Ushake). Single flies are disrupted in each well that contains extraction buffer and a 4 -mm metal ball. Our apparatus can hold up to five 96 -well micro-titer <b>plates.</b> <b>Construction</b> of the homogenizer apparatus takes about 3 - 4  days, and all equipment can be obtained from a home improvement store. The total material cost is approximately 700 euros including the paint-shaker. We tested the performance of our apparatus using the ZR- 96 Quick-gDNA™ kit (Zymo Research) homogenization buffer and achieved nearly complete tissue homogenization after 15  minutes of shaking. PCR tests did not detect any cross contamination between samples of neighboring wells. We obtained on average 138  ng of genomic DNA per fly, and DNA quality was adequate for standard PCR applications. In principle, our tissue homogenizer can be used for isolation of DNA suitable for library production and high throughput genotyping by Multiplexed Shotgun Genotyping (MSG), as well as RNA isolation from single flies. The sample adapter can also hold and shake other items, such as centrifuge tubes (15 - 50  mL) or small bottles...|$|E
25|$|In steel <b>plate</b> <b>construction,</b> {{stringers}} join parallel steel plates. The plate assemblies are fabricated off site, and welded together on-site to form steel walls {{connected by}} stringers. The walls become the form into which concrete is poured.

40|$|Noise {{reduction}} {{testing is}} completed for two single steel <b>plate</b> <b>constructions</b> with different thicknesses {{and for two}} double wall constructions with different air gap thicknesses that include the same two plates used in the single <b>plate</b> <b>constructions.</b> Results compare favorably with known theory and experimental results from previous literature. These favorable comparisons include the direct relationship between mass per unit area and transmission loss for single <b>plate</b> <b>constructions,</b> {{the presence of a}} noise reduction valley near the mass-air-mass frequency, the dependency of the mass-air-mass frequency on the air gap thickness, and the existence of a bridge frequency. Despite the similarities between theory and experimental results, there are discrepancies. Both the mass-air-mass and bridge frequencies for the double wall constructions were over predicted by equations offered in the literature. Additionally, the theory over predicted the bridge frequency, and the bridge frequency did not shift with changing air gap thickness. To uncover if these discrepancies are a result of structural dynamics not accounted by theory, experimental modal analysis was conducted on the single and double <b>plate</b> <b>constructions.</b> Investigation into the mode shape behavior reveals that the double wall noise reduction minimum attributed to the mass-air-mass frequency occurs in a region containing mode shapes where the two plates display synchronous motion and an unexpected noise reduction peak occurs in a frequency region where the double wall construction mode shapes exhibit asynchronous motion. Finally, acceleration plots of the constructions when excited by sound reveals that the bridge frequency occurs at a transition when the plate vibration reduces significantly...|$|R
25|$|Traditional jian blades {{are usually}} of sanmei (three <b>plate)</b> <b>construction,</b> which {{involved}} sandwiching {{a core of}} hard steel between two plates of softer steel.

40|$|Objective: The role of plate {{configuration}} {{was found}} inconclusive on the biomechanical {{effects of the}} plate size and hole number for dual <b>plate</b> <b>constructions</b> in humeral shaft fractures. The {{purpose of this study}} was to test the biomechanical stability of various dual <b>plate</b> <b>constructions.</b> Methods: Twenty-four left humeri (4 th Generation Composite Humerus, Sawbones, Malmö, Sweden) with comminuted midshaft humeral fracture were used. Four groups of plate constructs were tested: laterally fixed 8 -hole locking plate and screws were combined with anteriorly locking plates containing 0, 4, 6, or 8 holes in groups I, II, III, and IV, respectively. The alterations in axial, bending, and torsional angles were recorded. Results: There were no fixation failures during axial, bending, or torsional stiffness testing within the elastic behavior limits. Axial stiffness was highest in Group IV. Torsional stiffness, posterior-to-anterior bending stiffness, lateral-to-medial bending stiffness, and medial-to-lateral bending stiffness were lowest in Group I. Conclusion: The similar stiffness values for the 8 -to- 4 hole and 8 -to- 6 hole <b>plate</b> <b>constructions</b> indicate that the 8 -to- 4 hole construction is an option in young adults, while the stiffest 8 -to- 8 hole combination may be an option for osteoporotic patients...|$|R

Through a detailed nonlinear finite element analysis, this study will examine the internal force and deformation redistribution characteristics of flat-plate structure under fire.
