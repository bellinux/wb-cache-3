40|$|Motivated by {{the former}} {{researchers}} who focus only {{on one of the}} factor related to intangible investments, this study analyzes factors related to intangible investments. This study investigates wether cash, equity, expense and income are related to intangible investments. The reasons why the issue becomes a crucial matter are: First, recent accounting and finance literature say that intangible assets are a firm value creator and increasingly becoming the major drivers of firm value and performance. Second, current financial statements provide very little information about these assets. Even worse, much of the information that is provided is partial, inconsistent, and confusing. Third, intangible assets empirical studies in Indonesia are still very limited. Using sample from manufacture firms listed at the Jakarta Stock Exchange (JSX) over 2003 - 2007, the result indicates that generally cash, equity, expense and income are <b>positively</b> related <b>to</b> intangible assets. These findings have twelve main concerns: First, unexpected cash are <b>positively</b> related <b>to</b> intangible assets but statistically insignificant. Second, the increasing unexpected cash are negatively related to intangible assets and statistically insignificant. Third, the decreasing unexpected cash are negatively related to intangible assets and statistically insignificant. Fourth, unexpected equity are <b>positively</b> related <b>to</b> intangible assets and statistically significant. Fifth, the increasing unexpected equity are <b>positively</b> related <b>to</b> intangible assets and statistically significant. Sixth, the decreasing unexpected equity are <b>positively</b> related <b>to</b> intangible assets but statistically insignificant. Seventh, unexpected expense are <b>positively</b> related <b>to</b> intangible assets and statistically significant. Eighth, the increasing unexpected expense are <b>positively</b> related <b>to</b> intangible assets and statistically significant. Ninth, the decreasing unexpected expense are <b>positively</b> related <b>to</b> intangible assets but statistically insignificant. Tenth, unexpected income are <b>positively</b> related <b>to</b> intangible assets but statistically insignificant.

40|$|AbstractThe present {{longitudinal}} study (two waves), conducted on {{a population of}} 274 secondary-school teachers, expands on previous research on burnout and work engagement. Accordingly, the effect of organizational factors (obstacles, facilitators) as well as personal resources (self-efficacy) on burnout and engagement is tested longitudinally following the Social Cognitive Theory. More specifically, we test the loss and gain cycles, and reciprocal relationships concerning burnout, engagement, and self-efficacy over time. Four questions are addressed: (1) Are obstacles <b>positively</b> related <b>to</b> burnout and work self-efficacy over time? (2) Are facilitators <b>positively</b> related <b>to</b> engagement and self-efficacy over time? (3) Is work self-efficacy negatively related to burnout and obstacles over time? and (4) Is work self-efficacy <b>positively</b> related <b>to</b> engagement and facilitators over time? The results of a hard-copy survey carried out at two waves (8 months between the two times), which were computed on Structural Equation Modeling show that obstacles are <b>positively</b> related <b>to</b> burnout, {{which in turn is}} <b>positively</b> related <b>to</b> self-efficacy over time.
