5|$|Beginning in the 15th century, {{the cross}} {{with a double}} {{traverse}} is seen on the arms of archbishops, and relates to their <b>processional</b> <b>cross</b> and the jurisdiction it symbolizes. Except for cardinals of the Roman Curia, most cardinals head an archdiocese and use an archiepiscopal cross on their arms. Other cardinals use a simple Latin cross, as {{is found in the}} arms of Cardinal Joseph Zen, bishop emeritus of Hong Kong, because Hong Kong is not an archdiocese.|$|E
5|$|Besides the Holy See, another Catholic see has {{the right}} to bear the triple tiara in its coat of arms: the Patriarchate of Lisbon. The title of Patriarch of Lisbon was created in 1716 and is held by the {{archbishop}} of Lisbon since 1740. While the coat of arms of the Holy See combines the tiara with the crossed keys of St. Peter, that of the Lisbon Patriarchate combines it with a <b>processional</b> <b>cross</b> and a pastoral staff.|$|E
5|$|Donatian {{stands in}} front of a set of windows that are just outside the {{pictorial}} space. He holds a jewelled <b>processional</b> <b>cross</b> in his left hand, and a wheel containing five lit tapered candles in his right. The wheel is his usual attribute, and refers to an incident when he nearly drowned after being flung into the Tiber, but was saved after Pope Dionysius threw him a carriage wheel he was able to use as a float.|$|E

5|$|The {{outside of}} the mantle may be any color, {{typically}} red, while the inside is white or sometimes yellow to distinguish it from a secular mantle. David Johnson suggested that the mantle of all bishops should be white inside, excepting only patriarchs who use ermine, to indicate that all bishops are equally bishops. Above the mantle is a mitre (of the Eastern style) between a <b>processional</b> <b>cross</b> and a crosier. The earliest examples of the arms of Orthodox hierarchs have the cross to the dexter of the mitre and the bishop's staff to sinister, but opposite examples exist. An abbot (archimandrite or hegumen) should display a veiled abbot's staff to distinguish it from the bishop's staff.|$|E
25|$|Only {{one other}} Catholic see uses the triple tiara in its coat of arms: the Patriarchate of Lisbon. The title of Patriarch of Lisbon {{was created in}} 1716 and is held by the {{archbishop}} of Lisbon since 1740. The coat of arms of the Holy See combines the tiara with the crossed keys of St. Peter, while that of the Lisbon Patriarchate combines it with a <b>processional</b> <b>cross</b> and a pastoral staff. Also the Archbishop of Benevento uses the tiara in its coat of arms.|$|E
25|$|Before the {{installation}} of the Republic, in 1901, the Junta de Paróquia continued to purchase and adorn the interior, buying a silver <b>processional</b> <b>cross,</b> owing to the theft of the original, and a silver kettle that cost 230$440. Finally, on 24 October 1909, a clock arrived for the tower, made in France (at a cost of 487$180), thus fulfilling one of the longstanding requests. In 1910, with the establishment of the first Portuguese Republic, the church lost the title Royal Chapel. Former emigres to America offered a red tunic in valuer in 1917 for the image of Senhor dos Passos.|$|E

50|$|Details of the {{original}} liturgical use of the Cross are not known. When the sources, most importantly the Essen Liber Ordinarius of 1400, describe the use of <b>processional</b> <b>crosses</b> for processions, they speak generally and without distinguished individual <b>crosses.</b> <b>Processional</b> <b>crosses</b> were often used in pairs and {{on the basis of}} the creation of the Cross with large enamels under Abbess Mathilde it is assumed that the Cross with large enamels was made as a companion to the Cross of Otto and Mathilde. The two crosses were used together under Cardinal Hengsbach. The Cross with large enamels was last used in 1992 at the funeral of the second Bishop of Essen, Dr. Hubert Luthe. Today the Cross with large enamels, like the other three Ottonian <b>processional</b> <b>crosses</b> of the cathedral, is no longer in use for conservation reasons.|$|R
25|$|The Lutheran {{practice}} has varied {{at different times}} and in different countries. Thus, according to the Württemberg Kirchenordnung of 1553, a funeral procession was prescribed, the bier being followed by the congregation singing hymns; the Brandenburg Kirchenordnung (1540) directed a cross-bearer to precede the procession and lighted candles to be carried, and this was prescribed also by the Waldeck Kirchenordnung of 1556. At present funeral processions survive in general only in the country districts; the <b>processional</b> <b>cross</b> or crucifix is still carried. In some provinces also the Lutheran Church has retained the ancient rogation processions in the week before Whitsuntide and, in some cases, {{in the month of}} May or on special occasions (e.g. days of humiliation, Busstage), processions about the fields to ask a blessing on the crops. On these occasions the ancient litanies are still used.|$|E
500|$|Other {{insignia}} {{include the}} <b>processional</b> <b>cross,</b> the mitre and the crosier. Eastern traditions favor {{the use of}} their own style of head gear and crosier, {{and the use of the}} mantle or cloak rather than the ecclesiastical hat. The motto and certain shapes of shields are more common in ecclesiastical heraldry, while supporters and crests are less common. The papal coats of arms have their own heraldic customs, primarily the Papal Tiara (or mitre), the keys of Saint Peter, and the ombrellino (umbrella). Pope Benedict XVI replaced the use of the Papal Tiara in his coat of arms with a mitre. He was the first pope to do so, despite the fact that Pope Paul VI was the last pope to be crowned with the tiara. [...] The arms of institutions have slightly different traditions, using the mitre and crozier more often than is found in personal arms, though there is a wide variation in uses by different churches. [...] The arms used by organizations are called impersonal or corporate arms.|$|E
2500|$|The ceremonies begin {{when the}} Master of Ceremonies (MC) rings the bell. The porter opens the sacristy {{door and the}} servers and ministers leave the sacristy and enter {{the church in the}} {{following}} manner: first the thurifer carrying his thurible and boat (or the aspersorium if the Asperges is to be had); next come the acolytes carrying their candles (the custom in Northern European and English-speaking countries is to have a crucifer holding a <b>processional</b> <b>cross</b> walking between the acolytes); the Master of Ceremonies comes next; and finally the three sacred ministers enter in single file in reverse order of precedence (or {{on either side of the}} celebrant if he is wearing the cope for the Asperges or some other ceremony before the Mass. The deacon and sub-deacon should be holding the ends of the cope.) ...|$|E

5000|$|The {{cross is}} thought to date to the 12th century. It is around 60 cm long and weighs around 7 kg. It is made from one piece of metal, either gold, or bronze and gold. The central cross has an {{elongated}} descending arm and flared ends surrounded by an elaborately ornamented encircling band. Like many Ethiopian <b>processional</b> <b>crosses,</b> {{the bottom of the}} cross is supported by [...] "Adam's arms", a motif that realistically or abstractly portrays the arms of Adam. [...] On <b>processional</b> <b>crosses</b> they are draped with brightly colored pieces of cloth for festive occasions.|$|R
50|$|In the Roman Catholic and Anglican churches, <b>processional</b> <b>crosses</b> {{are used}} in processions preceded by incense and flanked or {{followed}} with candles. The cross is brought up to the altar by an altar server who has been chosen to serve as crucifer.|$|R
2500|$|In the chancel is a sedilia {{which is}} dated 1846 {{but which is}} {{probably}} a restoration of an Early English sedilia. At {{the east end of}} the north aisle, but moved from elsewhere, is an ogee-headed piscina. The font was designed by Scott. It is thought that the reredos was also designed by Scott; it depicts the Last Supper behind a tripartite arcade, with a canopy above. The choir stalls, which survived the fire, date from Harrison's restoration. The rood, [...] dating from 1915–16 and by Giles Gilbert Scott, was erected in memory of William Glynne Charles Gladstone. The pulpit dating from about 1951 was designed by H.S.Goodhart-Rendel in a Wren style. In 1884 Edward Frampton created wall paintings in the south aisle of the chancel but, apart from two fragments at the east end, these have disappeared. The <b>processional</b> <b>cross</b> and churchwardens' staves were designed by George Frederick Bodley.|$|E
2500|$|The Ardagh Chalice and the Derrynaflan Hoard of chalice, paten with stand, strainer, and basin (only {{discovered}} in 1980) {{are the most}} outstanding pieces of church metalware to survive (only three other chalices, and no other paten, survive). [...] These pieces are thought {{to come from the}} 8th or 9th century, but most dating of metalwork is uncertain, and comes largely from comparison with manuscripts. [...] Only fragments remain from what were probably large pieces of church furniture, probably with metalwork on wooden frameworks, such as shrines, crosses and other items. The Cross of Cong is a 12th-century Irish <b>processional</b> <b>cross</b> and reliquary that shows insular decoration, possibly added in a deliberately revivalist spirit. The gilt-bronze [...] "Athlone Crucifixion Plaque" [...] (National Museum of Ireland, perhaps 8th century) is much the best known of a group of nine recorded Irish metal plaques with Crucifixions, and is comparable in style to figures on many high crosses; it may well have come from a book cover.|$|E
2500|$|Inside {{the church}} is a west gallery. [...] The pulpit and reading desk, three-sided altar rails, a parish chest, and a hatchment commemorating the Aldersley family all date from the 17thcentury. [...] In {{the church is}} a monumental brass {{to members of the}} Massie family of Coddington. The east window is to the memory of Samuel Aldersey who died in 1855, and the {{southeast}} window is in memory of Hugh Robert Aldersey who died aged20 in 1848. [...] Both of these windows are by Wailes. A third window is by Frampton in memory of Canon Royd's son, a lieutenant in the Royal Navy who died of wounds in 1884. [...] The altar was given in 1912 in memory of Albert Lowe and the carved oak reredos was given in the same year as a memorial to Catherine Hughes. The communion rails date from 1833. [...] The <b>processional</b> <b>cross</b> was given in memory of John James Rutter, a churchwarden from 1917 to 1926, whilst the litany desk was given in memory of Thomas Moore, the rector's warden for 55years, and his wife Mary Ellen. [...] At the west end of the church are two bibles, a Breeches Bible and a Bishop's Bible.|$|E
50|$|Some Orthodox <b>processional</b> <b>crosses</b> {{will have}} an icon of the Crucifixion on one side, and the Resurrection on the other. The side with the Resurrection will face forward on Sundays and during the Paschal season, the Crucifixion will face forward on other days.|$|R

60|$|This early Christian art of Ireland {{is full of}} {{interest}} to the artist, the archaeologist and the historian. In its rudest forms, such as the little iron hand-bell, the plain stone chalice and the rough wooden staff, it {{brings us back to the}} simplicity of the primitive Christian Church, while to the period of its highest development we owe the great masterpieces of Celtic metal-work. The stone chalice is now replaced by the chalice of silver and gold; the iron bell has its jewel-studded shrine, and the rough staff its gorgeous casing; rich caskets and splendid bindings preserve the holy books of the Saints and, instead of the rudely carved symbol of the early missionaries, we have such beautiful works of art as the <b>processional</b> <b>cross</b> of Cong Abbey. Beautiful this cross certainly is with its delicate intricacy of ornamentation, its grace of proportion and its marvel of mere workmanship, nor is there any doubt about its history. From the inscriptions on it, which are corroborated by the annals of Innisfallen and the book of Clonmacnoise, we learn that it was made for King Turlough O'Connor by a native artist under the superintendence of Bishop O'Duffy, its primary object being to enshrine a portion of the true cross that was sent to the king in 1123. Brought to Cong some years afterwards, probably by the archbishop, who died there in 1150, it was concealed at the time of the Reformation, but at the beginning of the present century was still in the possession of the last abbot, and at his death it was purchased by professor MacCullagh and presented by him to the museum of the Royal Irish Academy. This wonderful work is alone well worth a visit to Dublin, but not less lovely is the chalice of Ardagh, a two-handled silver cup, absolutely classical in its perfect purity of form, and decorated with gold and amber and crystal and with varieties of cloisonne and champleve enamel. There is no mention of this cup, or of the so-called Tara brooch, in ancient Irish history. All that we know of them is that they were found accidentally, the former by a boy who was digging potatoes near the old Rath of Ardagh, the latter by a poor child who picked it up near the seashore. They both, however, belong probably to the tenth century.|$|E

50|$|The Franciscans, who {{promoted}} self-flagellation as a {{means of}} identification with the suffering of Christ, were probably responsible for a number of large Italian <b>processional</b> <b>crosses</b> in which the Flagellation occupies the back of the cross, with a Crucifixion on the front. These were presumably sometimes followed in processions by flagellants, who could see Christ suffering in front of them.|$|R
50|$|Tomás García Cándido, a priest, {{oversees the}} {{collection}} of ecclesiastical objects. Goldsmith objects include chalices, patens, Mass glasses, candelabras, ciboria, and <b>processional</b> <b>crosses.</b> A medieval collection of wood carvings consists of 30 pieces from the 12th, 13th, 14th, and 15th centuries, plus 24 pieces from the 16th, 17th, and 18th centuries. Books dating to 1522 and Liturgical vestments round out the collection.|$|R
5000|$|The cross {{has been}} located in Essen since its creation, {{excepting}} some evacuations during wars and other crises. The Inventarium reliquiarum Essendiensium of 12 July 1627, the earliest {{inventory of the}} Abbey's treasury, allows no certain identification, since it only recorded [...] "two crucifixes decorated with lots of gems and gold, but gilt in copper on the back," [...] a description which matches {{all four of the}} <b>processional</b> <b>crosses</b> in the Essen Cathedral Treasury. Likewise, the Liber ordinarius, which regulated the liturgical use of the Abbey treasures, only mentions <b>processional</b> <b>crosses</b> in general terms. Since donated sacral objects were not usually exchanged, it is believed that the cross belonged to the Abbey continuously until the secularisation of the Abbey in 1802. During the Thirty Years War, the Abbess fled with its treasure to Cologne. In 1794, as the French advanced on Essen, the cathedral treasury was brought to Steele (modern Essen-Steele) and hidden in the orphanage donated by Abbess Francisca Christina of Sulzbach.|$|R
