5|$|The {{traditional}} {{game has}} inspired filmmakers and screenwriters {{and has been}} portrayed in the 1998 film Into My Heart with Rob Morrow and Claire Forlani, BBC sitcom To the Manor Born and also in a Marks & Spencer clothes advert where models, including Twiggy and Myleene Klass, <b>played</b> <b>the</b> <b>game.</b> The popularity of the game was underlined when it featured as a question on long-running British quiz series University Challenge.|$|E
5|$|Asked {{what impact}} {{the money would}} have on him, Kinsler said: I'm {{going to play the}} same {{regardless}} of whether I'm making five dollars or $1 trillion. It really doesn't make a difference to me. I'm {{going to go out there}} and play hard, and money doesn't bring respect. The way you play the game brings respect. When I finish playing the game, it's not how much money I made that is going to be my legacy. It's how I <b>played</b> <b>the</b> <b>game,</b> and what I did on the field.|$|E

50|$|An unusual {{aspect of}} <b>the</b> <b>game</b> was that <b>the</b> player has <b>the</b> choice between <b>playing</b> <b>the</b> <b>game</b> with music only, or sound effects only. It is not {{possible}} to <b>play</b> <b>the</b> <b>game</b> with both at the same time.|$|R
5|$|Despite {{its highly}} touted lineup, Michigan entered the tournament as the sixth {{youngest}} {{team in the}} country and the youngest team in the field of 68 teams according to Sports Illustrated, based on weighted minutes <b>played.</b> <b>The</b> <b>game</b> marked Michigan's first NCAA Championship Monday appearance since 1989. Some sources claim 1993 as the school's last appearance, but those results have been vacated by the NCAA due to the University of Michigan basketball scandal.|$|E
5|$|For the 1958 season, the {{durations}} of timeouts {{was extended}} from 60 to 90 seconds and Bell mandated officials call a few TV timeouts during each game — a change which triggered criticism from sportswriters. The 1958 championship game {{became the first}} NFL championship game decided in overtime and it {{was considered to be}} the greatest football game ever <b>played.</b> <b>The</b> <b>game</b> further increased football's marketability to television advertising, and the drama associated with overtime was the catalyst. Years later, after witnessing Bell openly crying after the game, Raymond Berry attributed it to Bell's realization of the impact the game would have on the prevalence of the sport.|$|E
5|$|In September 2006, Thompson brought another $600 million {{lawsuit against}} Cody Posey, Rockstar Games, Take-Two Interactive, and Sony Computer Entertainment. The lawsuit claimed that 14-year-old Posey <b>played</b> <b>the</b> <b>game</b> obsessively before murdering his father, stepmother, and stepsister {{on a ranch}} in Hondo, New Mexico. Posey's defense team argued that he was abused by his father and was taking Zoloft {{at the time of}} the killings. The suit alleged that the murders would not have taken place if Posey had not obsessively played Vice City. The case was {{dismissed}} in December 2007, as New Mexico held no jurisdiction over Sony or Take-Two.|$|E

5|$|Mother 2 was {{designed}} to fit within an eight megabit limit, but was expanded in size and scope twice: first to 12 megabits and second to 24 megabits. The game was originally scheduled for release in January 1993 on a 12 megabit cartridge. It was finished around May 1994 and the Japanese release was set for August 27, 1994. With the extra few months, the team <b>played</b> <b>the</b> <b>game</b> and added small, personal touches. Itoi told Weekly Famitsu that Shigeru Miyamoto liked the game {{and that it was}} the first role-playing game that Miyamoto had completed. Mother 2 would release in North America about a year later.|$|E
5|$|Since 1912 {{the teams}} have <b>played</b> <b>the</b> <b>game</b> at the Cotton Bowl stadium in Dallas, Texas, amid the {{atmosphere}} of the adjacent Texas State Fair. This is unusual because most college football games alternate between the opponents home stadiums. Dallas was chosen as the neutral site because it is approximately halfway between the two schools. The stadium is divided down the 50-yard line, with half of the stadium predominantly clad in the crimson and cream colors of Oklahoma, and the other half mostly wearing the burnt orange and white of Texas.|$|E

5|$|The first Halo book, , {{sold more}} than 1,000,000 copies and {{prompted}} an extended agreement between Del Rey Books and Microsoft to produce more Halo novels. William C. Dietz, a Seattle-based science fiction author, was approached to write the next Halo novel.

Players can fight against these Links, which are AI-controlled opponents based on their game's data. Winning against Shadow Links earns a rupee bounty based on their difficulty, and {{achievements}} can be earned for fulfilling certain conditions. A more challenging Hero mode is unlocked upon completing the main adventure.|$|E
50|$|Many {{reviews of}} the iOS/Android version of <b>the</b> <b>game</b> {{levelled}} criticism at the 'always-online' necessity, where the user needs {{to be connected to}} the Internet in order to <b>play</b> <b>the</b> <b>game.</b> Reviewers stated that requirement made it difficult to <b>play</b> <b>the</b> <b>game</b> while on <b>the</b> move.|$|R

5|$|The {{sport was}} first {{developed}} at a bridge located in Ashdown Forest, {{close to the}} village of Upper Hartfield, East Sussex, England. Built in 1907 and originally called Posingford Bridge, it is considered to be the bridge on which Milne and his son first <b>played</b> <b>the</b> <b>game.</b> However, it is uncertain whether the sport was first played at the bridge then written into the story, or vice versa. The bridge maintained the public's interest and a campaign to rebuild it in the late seventies was considered important enough to feature on the BBC NineO'Clock News. The bridge was subsequently reopened by Christopher Robin Milne and officially renamed as Poohsticks Bridge.|$|E
5|$|They have a 77% {{winning record}} in test match rugby, {{and are the}} only {{international}} side with a winning record against every opponent. Since their international debut in 1903, they have lost to only six of the 19 nations they have played in test matches. Since {{the introduction of the}} World Rugby Rankings in 2003, New Zealand has held the number one ranking longer than all other teams combined.

40|$|The aim of {{this report}} is {{to see whether the}} graphic design of a game {{influences}} children’s will to play games. I am especially looking at minimalist graphic design and how well it works for a game aimed at children age 7 - 9. Does the style of <b>the</b> <b>game</b> design have any impact at all concerning the children’s wish to <b>play</b> <b>the</b> <b>game</b> or is <b>the</b> <b>game</b> mechanic all that matters. The final results concluded that although <b>the</b> graphic design <b>plays</b> a part in the children’s willingness to <b>play</b> <b>the</b> <b>game</b> <b>the</b> <b>game</b> mechanics are by far the biggest factor in whether children will <b>play</b> <b>the</b> <b>game</b> or not...|$|R

5|$|When {{considering}} the project, Charles Cecil <b>played</b> <b>the</b> <b>game</b> again and noticed many issues, including pixilated backgrounds, FMV and audio were of poor quality, {{and he also}} felt some dialogue was out of place.

5|$|All {{but one of}} the 22 {{people to}} manage Scotland had <b>played</b> <b>the</b> <b>game</b> professionally. The {{exception}} is Dawson Walker, who was placed in interim charge of the team while Matt Busby was recovering from the effects of the Munich air disaster. Of the 21 Scotsmen to hold the post of manager, ten were never capped for the senior Scotland team as a player (Walker, Stein, Prentice, MacDonald, MacLeod, Ferguson, Roxburgh, Brown, Smith and Stark), although some of them did represent the Scottish Football League (Stein, Prentice, MacDonald and Ferguson). Of the 11 that played for Scotland, six earned at least 10 caps: McColl (14), Docherty (25), McLeish (77), Burley (11), Levein (16) and Strachan (50). Four also served as Scotland captains; Docherty (8), McLeish (8), Levein (1) and Strachan (5). Berti Vogts, the only foreign manager to hold the post, earned 96 caps for West Germany and was part of their 1974 World Cup winning side.|$|E
5|$|Football was {{introduced}} to the university by John A. Harts in 1895. Harts was a student from Kansas who had <b>played</b> <b>the</b> <b>game</b> in his home state. The university had its first paid coach in Vernon L. Parrington, who led the Sooners to a record of ninewins, oneloss, and twoties over four seasons. Bennie Owen brought Oklahoma to the national stage during his 22-year tenure as head coach. He retired with a 122–54–16 record, including four seasons in which the team went unbeaten. During Owen's tenure, Oklahoma became a charter member of the Southwest Conference, in which they remained for fiveyears before leaving to join the Missouri Valley Intercollegiate Athletic Association. The MVIAA conference would later transform into the Big Six, Big Seven, and finally the Big Eight Conference.|$|E
