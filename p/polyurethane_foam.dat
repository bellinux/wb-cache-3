5|$|The fire {{may have}} been caused by the {{accidental}} ignition of <b>polyurethane</b> <b>foam</b> insulation used on the building's outer walls. In China, the foam is commonly used as insulation material without the addition of flame retardants, and the foam produces toxic gases and carbon monoxide when burned. The Beijing Television Cultural Center was said to have used polyurethane insulation, which magnified the ferocity of a 2009 fire that consumed the center. In a 24 November press conference, local authorities said that the two apartments next to the destroyed building would be renovated as well, and that foam cladding on their exteriors would be switched out in favor of fire-resistant materials. Chinese citizens have also questioned the lack of an indoor fire sprinkler system in high rise buildings.|$|E
5|$|The British {{engineering}} firm Atelier One and freelance engineer Chris Hornzee-Jones (who later {{went on to}} form the {{engineering firm}} Aerotrope in 2005) provided the sculpture's structural design, and Performance Structures, Inc. (PSI) was chosen to fabricate it because {{of their ability to}} produce nearly invisible welds. The project began with PSI attempting to recreate the design in miniature. A high-density <b>polyurethane</b> <b>foam</b> model was selected by Kapoor, which was then used to design the final structure, including the interior structural components. Initially, PSI planned to build and assemble the sculpture in Oakland, California, and ship it to Chicago through the Panama Canal and St. Lawrence Seaway. However, this plan was discarded after park officials deemed it too risky, so {{the decision was made to}} transport the individual panels by truck and to assemble the structure on-site, a task undertaken by MTH Industries.|$|E
5|$|To {{reduce the}} {{likelihood}} of damage to the A-10's fuel system, all four fuel tanks are located near the aircraft's center and are separated from the fuselage; projectiles would need to penetrate the aircraft's skin before reaching a tank's outer skin. Compromised fuel transfer lines self-seal; if damage exceeds a tank's self-sealing capabilities, check valves prevent fuel flowing into a compromised tank. Most fuel system components are inside the tanks so that fuel will not be lost due to component failure. The refueling system is also purged after use. Reticulated <b>polyurethane</b> <b>foam</b> lines both the inner and outer sides of the fuel tanks, retaining debris and restricting fuel spillage in the event of damage. The engines are shielded {{from the rest of the}} airframe by firewalls and fire extinguishing equipment. In the event of all four main tanks being lost, two self-sealing sump tanks contain fuel for 230miles (370km) of flight.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Rigid <b>polyurethane</b> <b>foams</b> were {{prepared}} using sepiolite nanofibers as main functional fillers. The effect of sepiolite nanofibers on {{the properties of}} <b>polyurethane</b> <b>foams</b> was studied systematically. Through characterization by scanning electron microscope, X-ray diffraction and property test, {{it was found that}} the thermal insulation effect can be maintained, and the mechanical properties can be improved due to the good interfacial bond between sepiolite nanofibers and rigid <b>polyurethane</b> <b>foams...</b>|$|R
30|$|There is some contradiction the {{literature}} {{as to the}} effect fire retardants have on the overall toxicity of <b>polyurethane</b> <b>foams.</b> A large majority of {{the literature}} indicates that the addition of fire retardants does not increase toxicity of <b>polyurethane</b> <b>foams.</b> This {{is due to the}} large range of available fire retardants found in <b>polyurethane</b> <b>foams,</b> which suggests that the toxicity will likely follow the general trends in the literature for all materials regarding fire retardants. Fire retardants, such as gas-phase free radical quenchers, have been reported to increase the yields of CO in well-ventilated conditions by preventing the oxidation of CO to CO 2. Other fire retardants such as melamine are reported to significantly increase the HCN yield of <b>polyurethane</b> <b>foams.</b> The presence of Cu 2 O drastically decreased the yield of HCN in <b>polyurethane</b> <b>foams</b> at lower temperatures, but had little effect at high temperatures.|$|R
30|$|Usually, <b>polyurethane</b> <b>foams</b> are {{prepared}} by the reaction between polyols and diisosyanates {{with the addition of}} a surfactant and water. Petroleum-based polyols can be replaced with lignins. Pan and Saddler used hardwood ethanol organosolv lignin and hardwood kraft lignin to replace almost 30  % commercial polyols with the lignins [12]. Addition of another biomass polyol to lignin was investigated. Lignin-based <b>polyurethane</b> <b>foams</b> could be prepared using kraft lignin or lignosulfonate, molasses, PEG with poly(phenylene methylene), or polyisocyanate in the presence of surfactants and a small amount of water [167]. The apparent density, compression strength, and elastic modulus of the <b>polyurethane</b> <b>foams</b> increased with increasing lignin contents. The obtained <b>polyurethane</b> <b>foams</b> exhibited thermal stability up to 300  °C. The <b>polyurethane</b> <b>foams</b> prepared using polyols derived from lignins and molasses displayed water absorbent properties. By adding microcrystalline cellulose, the water absorption rate increased initially and kept larger amount of water over long periods of time [168]. Polyols, except lignin, can affect the mechanical and thermal properties of <b>polyurethane</b> <b>foams.</b> Hatakeyama et al. [169, 170] investigated the mechanical and thermal properties of lignin-based <b>polyurethane</b> <b>foams</b> derived from sodium lignosulfonate mixed with diethylene glycol, triethylene glycol, and PEG. The glass transition temperatures and thermal stability increased with decreasing oxyethylene chain lengths, and the compression strength and compression modulus increased with increasing oxyethylene chain lengths.|$|R

25|$|Polyurethane rubber {{is a more}} cost {{effective}} material to use in place of silicone. Polyurethane comes in various levels of hardness which are measured on the Shore scale. Rigid <b>polyurethane</b> <b>foam</b> is used in prototyping {{because it can be}} milled and shaped in high density. Flexible <b>polyurethane</b> <b>foam</b> is often used in the actual building of the final animatronic figure because it is flexible and bonds well with latex.|$|E
25|$|Some storing {{materials}} can {{be harmful to}} ceramic objects. Wool felt attracts and harbors insects including moths and silverfish which can be potentially very harmful to other collection material types. <b>Polyurethane</b> <b>foam</b> deteriorates over time which leaves a by-product that are sticky and acidic.|$|E
30|$|As {{the global}} usage of <b>polyurethane</b> <b>foams</b> is {{expected}} to continue to increase yearly, {{it is important that the}} fire community have a clear understanding of the fire toxicity of <b>polyurethane</b> <b>foams</b> and the reasons why they produce significant amounts of toxic gases during combustion. Since HCN is a major contributor to the fire toxicity of <b>polyurethane</b> <b>foams,</b> the mechanisms by which they decompose are vital in understanding why they produce large-quantities of HCN during under-ventilated burning.|$|R
40|$|<b>Polyurethane</b> <b>foams</b> {{are widely}} used in many {{industrial}} applications, including automotive, upholstered furniture and mattresses, insulating panels for building. Depending on the desired application, <b>polyurethane</b> <b>foams</b> can be produced using many different chemicals and formulations. The physical properties of flexible <b>polyurethane</b> <b>foams</b> depend on their composition. They will be {{closely related to the}} characteristics of the polyol used, to the stoichiometry (polyol/isocyanate), to the quantity of catalysts and surfactants and to the water content (and so to the density). By its chemical nature, a polyurethane is very flammable. The flammability of <b>polyurethane</b> <b>foams</b> is an important industrial issue. This paper deals with the influence of the composition of conventional flexible PU foams on their thermal stability and fire behaviour. (c) 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R

25|$|From {{the first}} half of the twentieth century, {{physicians}} used other substances as breast implant fillers—ivory, glass balls, ground rubber, ox cartilage, Terylene wool, gutta-percha, Dicora, polyethylene chips, Ivalon (polyvinyl alcohol—formaldehyde polymer sponge), a polyethylene sac with Ivalon, polyether foam sponge (Etheron), polyethylene tape (Polystan) strips wound into a ball, polyester (<b>polyurethane</b> <b>foam</b> sponge) Silastic rubber, and teflon-silicone prostheses.|$|E
25|$|The major {{application}} of 4,4'-MDI is {{the production of}} rigid polyurethane. Typically, one metric ton of <b>polyurethane</b> <b>foam</b> needs 616 kg of MDI and 386 kg of polyol, with 54 kg of pentane as a blowing agent. These rigid polyurethane foams are good thermal insulators and used in nearly all freezers and refrigerators worldwide, as well as buildings. Typical polyols used are polyethylene adipate (a polyester) and poly(tetramethylene ether) glycol (a polyether).|$|E
40|$|Five {{component}} level flammability {{tests were}} conducted in a 400 cubic foot chamber to determine the products of combustion and relative destruction of coated (with fire-retardants) and uncoated <b>polyurethane</b> <b>foams</b> during exposure of the foams to a large flaming ignition source for five minutes. The test {{results indicate that the}} improved state-of-the-art <b>polyurethane</b> <b>foams</b> without the added fire retardant and coating treatments were not significantly better than untreated older less fire-resistant <b>polyurethane</b> <b>foams.</b> however, by treating and coating the state-of-the-art foams, the production of toxic gases was delayed and the destruction of the foam limited...|$|R
30|$|These {{reactions}} are accelerated {{in the presence}} of oxygen, which reduces the temperature of the decomposition steps. <b>Polyurethane</b> <b>foams</b> based on polyether polyols will have a lower decomposition temperature in air than polyester polyol based foams. However, as noted by Paabo and Levin (1987), many studies into the decomposition of <b>polyurethane</b> <b>foams</b> do not differentiate between flaming and non-flaming decomposition, and focus on the temperature of decomposition rather than the presence of flames. Therefore, in certain conditions, <b>polyurethanes</b> <b>foams</b> can reach their auto-ignition temperature and ignite which will significantly alter the effect the decomposition mechanisms and resulting products.|$|R
30|$|The {{chemistry}} of <b>polyurethane</b> <b>foams</b> and their thermal decomposition {{are discussed in}} order to assess the relationship between the chemical and physical composition of the foam and the toxic products generated during their decomposition. The toxic product generation during flaming combustion of <b>polyurethane</b> <b>foams</b> is reviewed, in order to relate the yields of toxic products and the overall fire toxicity to the fire conditions. The methods of assessment of fire toxicity are outlined in order to understand how the fire toxicity of <b>polyurethane</b> <b>foams</b> may be quantified. In particular, the ventilation condition has a critical effect on the yield of the two major asphyxiants, carbon monoxide and hydrogen cyanide.|$|R

25|$|The {{microphone}} {{features a}} high membrane compliance {{with a large}} backchamber volume, a prepolarized backplane and a high impedance preamplifier located inside the backchamber. The windscreen, based on the high transmission coefficient of infrasound through matter, is made of a material having a low acoustic impedance and has a sufficiently thick wall to ensure structural stability.

25|$|<b>Polyurethane</b> <b>foam</b> (including foam rubber) is {{sometimes}} made using {{small amounts of}} blowing agents to give less dense foam, better cushioning/energy absorption or thermal insulation. In the early 1990s, because of their impact on ozone depletion, the Montreal Protocol restricted the use of many chlorine-containing blowing agents, such as trichlorofluoromethane (CFC-11). By the late 1990s, blowing agents such as carbon dioxide, pentane, 1,1,1,2-tetrafluoroethane (HFC-134a) and 1,1,1,3,3-pentafluoropropane (HFC-245fa) were widely used in North America and the EU, although chlorinated blowing agents remained in use in many developing countries.|$|E

40|$|The work {{focuses on}} {{research}} related to determination of application possibility of new, ecofriendly boroorganic polyols in rigid <b>polyurethane</b> <b>foams</b> production. Polyols were obtained from hydroxypropyl urea derivatives esterified with boric acid and propylene carbonate. The influence of esterification type on properties of polyols and next on <b>polyurethane</b> <b>foams</b> properties was determined. Nitrogen and boron impacts on the foams’ properties were discussed, for instance, on their physical, mechanical, and electric properties. Boron presence causes improvement of dimensional stability and thermal stability of <b>polyurethane</b> <b>foams.</b> They can be applied even at temperature 150 °C. Unfortunately, introducing boron in <b>polyurethanes</b> <b>foams</b> affects deterioration of their water absorption, which increases {{as compared to the}} foams that do not contain boron. However, presence of both boron and nitrogen determines the decrease of the foams combustibility. Main impact on the decrease combustibility of the obtained foams has nitrogen presence, but in case of proper boron and nitrogen ratio their synergic activity on the combustibility decrease can be easily seen...|$|R

25|$|The {{design of}} Enterprise {{was not the}} same as that planned for , the first flight model; the aft {{fuselage}} was constructed differently, and it did not have the interfaces to mount OMS pods. A large number of subsystems—ranging from main engines to radar equipment—were not installed on Enterprise, but the capacity to add them in the future was retained, as NASA originally intended to refit the orbiter for spaceflight at the conclusion of its testing. Instead of a thermal protection system, its surface was primarily covered with simulated tiles made from <b>polyurethane</b> <b>foam.</b> Fiberglass was used for the leading edge panels in place of the reinforced carbon–carbon ones of spaceflight-worthy orbiters. Only a few sample thermal tiles and some Nomex blankets were real. Enterprise used fuel cells to generate its electrical power, but these were not sufficient to power the orbiter for spaceflight.|$|E
25|$|These ants are {{not hard}} to control, and most ant killers will solve problems, {{especially}} if controlled {{as soon as the}} problem is noticed. At this point, they could be put under control in just a few days. However, the longer someone waits, the larger the population is and the longer it will take to control the situation, possibly a few weeks. Standing water should be eliminated, as odorous house ants are attracted to moisture. Plants should be trimmed back so they cannot be used to get inside. Cracks, holes and joints should be sealed with <b>polyurethane</b> <b>foam</b> or caulk, especially those that are near the ground.
