40|$|A {{nonlinear}} kinetic-fluid {{model for}} high-beta plasmas with multiple ion species {{which can be}} applied to multiscale phenomena is presented. The model embeds important kinetic effects due to finite ion Larmor radius (FLR), wave-particle resonances, magnetic particle trapping, etc. in the framework of simple fluid descriptions. When further restricting to low frequency phenomena with frequencies less than the ion cyclotron frequency the kinetic-fluid model takes a simpler form in which the fluid equations of multiple ion species collapse into single-fluid density and momentum equations and a low frequency generalized Ohm's law. The kinetic effects are introduced via plasma <b>pressure</b> <b>tensors</b> for ions and electrons which are computed from particle distribution functions that are governed by the Vlasov equation or simplified plasma dynamics equations such as the gyrokinetic equation. The ion FLR effects provide a finite parallel electric field, a perpendicular velocity that modifies the ExB drift, and a gyroviscosity tensor, all of which are neglected in the usual one-fluid MHD description.

However, the opposite holds for the slow wind, and the overall particle contribution L_P = L_p + L_α tends to exceed the magnetic one L_M. These aspects are at variance with previous models. We examine whether introducing realistic ion temperature anisotropies can resolve this discrepancy. From the general multifluid transport equations with gyrotropic species <b>pressure</b> <b>tensors,</b> we derive the equations governing both the meridional and azimuthal dynamics of general axisymmetrical, rotating stellar winds that include two major ion species. The azimuthal dynamics are examined in detail, using the empirically constructed meridional flow profiles for the solar wind.

40|$|The {{influence}} of a guide field on collisionless driven reconnection is investigated by means of two-dimensional electromagnetic particle simulation in an open system. In a quasi-steady state when reconnection electric field evolves fully, a current layer evolves locally in a narrow kinetic region and its scale decreases in proportion to an electron meandering scale as the guide field is intensified. Here, the meandering scale stands for an average spatial scale of nongyrotropic motions {{in the vicinity of}} the reconnection point. Force terms associated with off-diagonal components of electron and ion <b>pressure</b> <b>tensors,</b> which are originating from nongyrotropic motions of charged particles, becomes dominant at the reconnection point and sustain the reconnection electric field even when the guide field is strong. It is also found that thermalization of both ions and electrons is suppressed by the guide field.

The radii of tension also reach zero. With the further equimolar radius decrease the surface tension becomes negative, though the drop holds stable in the conditions of the numerical experiment. It means that such droplet is metastable. Apparently, it testifies that the notion of surface tension which is used in macroscopic theory can not be applied to such small drops.

In this limit, we are able to express all these coefficients in terms of known thermodynamic quantities, such as the thermodynamic pressure, energy density, and the velocity of sound. We explicitly demonstrate that the ratio of bulk viscosity to bulk relaxation time behaves very differently, as a function of temperature, than the ratio of shear viscosity to shear relaxation time. We further explicitly compute, for the first time, the transport coefficients that couple the bulk viscous pressure to the shear-stress tensor and vice versa. The coefficient that couples bulk viscous <b>pressure</b> to shear-stress <b>tensor</b> is found to be orders of magnitude larger than the bulk viscosity itself, suggesting that bulk viscous pressure production owes more to this coupling than to the expansion rate of the system.

40|$|In {{previous}} {{simulations of}} collisionless 2 D magnetic reconnection it was consistently {{found that the}} term in the generalised Ohm's law that breaks the frozen-in condition is the divergence of the electron <b>pressure</b> <b>tensor's</b> non-gyrotropic components. A fully relativistic particle-in-cell (PIC) code was used to model $X$-point collapse with a guide-field in two and three spatial dimensions. We show that in a 2 D $X$-point collapse with a guide-field close {{to the strength of}} the in-plane field, the increased induced shear flows along the diffusion region lead to a new reconnection regime in which electron inertial terms play a dominant role at the $X$-point. This transition is marked by the emergence of a magnetic island - and hence a second reconnection site - as well as electron flow vortices moving along the current sheet. The reconnection electric field at the $X$-point is shown to exceed all lower guide-field cases for a brief period, indicating a strong burst in reconnection. By extending the simulation to three spatial dimensions it is shown that the locations of vortices along the current sheet (visualised by their $Q$-value) vary in the out-of-plane direction, producing tilted vortex tubes. The vortex tubes {{on opposite sides of the}} diffusion region are tilted in opposite directions, similarly to bifurcated current sheets in oblique tearing-mode reconnection. The tilt angles of vortex tubes were compared to a theoretical estimation and were found to be a good match. Particle velocity distribution functions for different guide-field runs, for 2. 5 D and 3 D simulations, are analysed and compared. Comment: A&A, Forthcoming articl...|$|R

Grad's distribution functions are used to determine the third-order tensors and their production terms for mixtures whose constituent's rest masses are not too disparate, so that it follows a system of $ 13 r+ 1 $ scalar field equations. By restricting to a binary mixture characterized by the six fields of partial particle number densities, four-velocity and temperature, the remainder 21 scalar equations are used to determine the constitutive equations for the non-equilibrium pressures, diffusion fluxes, <b>pressure</b> deviator <b>tensors</b> and heat fluxes.
