5|$|After Pelacur, Sarumpaet {{began working}} on a film {{adaptation}} entitled Jamila dan Sang Presiden (Jamila and the President). The film's production took three years, due in <b>part</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> lack of funding; the total budget was Rp.6.5 billion (US$800,000) Released on 30 April 2009, the film was well received both domestically and internationally. It was submitted to the 82nd Academy Awards for Best Foreign Language Film, but not nominated.|$|E
5|$|After {{extensive}} {{negotiations to}} implement a collateral structure open to all eurozone countries, on 4 October 2011, a modified escrow collateral agreement was reached. The expectation is that only Finland will utilise it, due, in <b>part,</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> requirement to contribute initial capital to European Stability Mechanism in one instalment instead of five instalments over time. Finland, {{as one of the}} strongest AAA countries, can raise the required capital with relative ease.|$|E
5|$|Cambodian Rocks was {{the first}} release of its kind, {{followed}} {{by a number of}} similar compilations like Cambodian Cassette Archives and other unrelated titles by the same or similar names, inspired by the original or exploiting its weak standing with regard to intellectual property.

5|$|Capital {{punishment}} is sanctioned in the United States for certain federal and military crimes, {{and used in}} 31 states. No executions took place from 1967 to 1977, owing in <b>part</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> U.S. Supreme Court ruling striking down arbitrary imposition of the death penalty. In 1976, that Court ruled that, under appropriate circumstances, capital punishment may constitutionally be imposed. Since the decision {{there have been more}} than 1,300 executions, a majority of these taking place in three states: Texas, Virginia, and Oklahoma. Meanwhile, several states have either abolished or struck down death penalty laws. In 2015, the country had the fifth-highest number of executions in the world, following China, Iran, Pakistan and Saudi Arabia.|$|E
5|$|Gerry Anderson biographers Simon Archer and Marcus Hearn {{suggest that}} Thunderbird 6 {{develops}} {{the character of}} Lady Penelope from her previous appearances in the Thunderbirds franchise. This is argued to be due, in <b>part,</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> more mature reading of the character's lines from Sylvia Anderson, who provided Penelope's voice from the first episode of the Thunderbirds television series. Archer and Hearn also praise the work of David Graham, particularly his reading of Parker's dialogue, but note that other regular characters, such as Gordon and John, appear infrequently in the film.|$|E
5|$|In September 1939, as {{with most}} other aspects of A/S, no clear plan existed for the {{armament}} of Coastal Command's aircraft. While operational control {{was given to the}} Admiralty, the faith of both services in ASDIC proved ill-founded. It ruled out the submarine threat, and caused a refocusing on surface attacks. In addition, no A/S weapons had been developed properly in the inter-war period. Most of the munitions were left over from the First World War, due in <b>part</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> wish to economise and the fact no order had been given to dispose of them.|$|E

5|$|It is {{difficult}} to gain an accurate picture of incidence and prevalence of self-harm. This is due in a <b>part</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> lack of sufficient numbers of dedicated research centres to provide a continuous monitoring system. However, even with sufficient resources, statistical estimates are crude since most incidences of self-harm are undisclosed to the medical profession as acts of self-harm are frequently carried out in secret, and wounds may be superficial and easily treated by the individual. Recorded figures can be based on three sources: psychiatric samples, hospital admissions and general population surveys.|$|E
5|$|Parachutes was {{recognised}} to have {{an alternative}} rock sound similar to English band Radiohead in their Bends era. In fact, {{it has been suggested}} that the album's commercial success was due in <b>part</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> portion of Radiohead's audience being alienated by the band's experimental and more electronic-influenced Kid A album.|$|E
5|$|The Browns won another {{championship}} in 1954, thanks in <b>part</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> strong regular-season performance from Lavelli. Lavelli {{led the team}} in receiving that year and made the Pro Bowl after the Browns beat the Lions for their second NFL title. A third NFL championship followed in 1955. In the championship game against the Rams, Lavelli caught a touchdown {{in the second quarter}} and scored a second time on a 50-yard pass just {{before the end of the}} first half. The Browns won 38–14.|$|E

5|$|The SG-1000's launch did {{not prove}} to be successful. The three launch games, {{all of which were}} ported from Sega's VIC dual-arcade board, lacked the name {{recognition}} of Famicom launch games Donkey Kong, Donkey Kong Jr., and Popeye. However, the situation was quickly turned around. Thanks in part to the SG-1000's steadier stream of releases (21 SG-1000 games by the end of 1983, as compared to only 9 Famicom games), and in <b>part</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> recall on Famicom units necessitated by a faulty circuit, the SG-1000 chalked up 160,000 units in sales in 1983, far exceeding Sega's projection of 50,000 units.|$|E
5|$|The {{cause of}} Smart's eclipse may be traced in <b>part</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> {{prejudice}} of the age, one {{which was founded}} in reason but developed in fear. There was one inescapable fact which hampered any clear perception of Smart's work—he had been confined for madness. It was easier to use a difficult allusion or unusual image as evidence of madness than to interpret it. What could cause a fundamentally rational group of people to react so irrationally? To some degree, it was the fear of 'enthusiasm'.|$|E

Following the eruption, relief workers gathered around the girl, speaking with her and listening to her responses. She attracted the attention of the reporters at the site because of her sense of dignity and courage, and caused controversy when people wondered why the media workers had not saved her (which was impossible without equipment).|$|E
5|$|Wisconsin {{ultimately}} {{put into}} Leyte Gulf and dropped anchor there on 13 June for repairs and replenishment. Three weeks later, on 1 July, the battleship and her escorts sailed once more for Japanese home waters for carrier air strikes on the enemy's heartland. Nine days later, carrier planes from TF 38 destroyed 72 enemy aircraft {{on the ground}} and smashed industrial sites in the Tokyo area. Wisconsin and the other ships made no attempt whatsoever to conceal the location of their armada, due in large <b>part</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> weak Japanese response to their presence.|$|E
5|$|An early Italian humanist {{who came}} to Poland in the mid-15th century was Filippo Buonaccorsi. Many Italian artists came to Poland with Bona Sforza of Milan, when she married King Sigismund I the Old in 1518. This was {{supported}} by temporarily strengthened monarchies in both areas, {{as well as by}} newly established universities. The Polish Renaissance lasted from the late 15th to the late 16th century and was the Golden Age of Polish culture. Ruled by the Jagiellon dynasty, the Kingdom of Poland (from 1569 known as the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth) actively participated in the broad European Renaissance. The multi-national Polish state experienced a substantial period of cultural growth thanks in <b>part</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> century without major wars – aside from conflicts in the sparsely populated eastern and southern borderlands. The Reformation spread peacefully throughout the country (giving rise to the Polish Brethren), while living conditions improved, cities grew, and exports of agricultural products enriched the population, especially the nobility (szlachta) who gained dominance in the new political system of Golden Liberty. The Polish Renaissance architecture has three periods of development.|$|E

5|$|At {{that time}} in Hawaii, gold coins brought a premium over their face value if {{purchased}} with silver; only gold {{could be used for}} certain transactions, such as paying customs duties. Silver had been heavily imported into the kingdom in the 1870s despite government efforts to slow the flow with taxes, and thus gold was more expensive there in terms of silver than in the United States, which was more stable monetarily. Any large influx of silver into circulation, such as by the Kalākaua coins, meant that silver {{in the hands of the}} public might become worth less in terms of gold. In 1883, Hawaii was in a recession, due in <b>part</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> fall in sugar prices because of overproduction.|$|E
5|$|Because of poor-quality soil, much of Wales is {{unsuitable}} for crop-growing and livestock farming {{has traditionally been}} the focus of agriculture. The Welsh landscape (protected by three national parks) and 45 Blue Flag beaches, as well as the unique culture of Wales, attract large numbers of tourists, who play an especially vital role in the economy of rural areas. Wales has struggled to develop or attract high value-added employment in sectors such as finance and research and development, attributable in <b>part</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> comparative lack of 'economic mass' (i.e. population) – Wales lacks a large metropolitan centre. The lack of high value-added employment is reflected in lower economic output per head relative to other regions of the UK – in 2002 it stood at 90% of the EU25 average and around 80% of the UK average. In June 2008, Wales made history by becoming the first nation in the world to be awarded Fairtrade Status.|$|E
5|$|Cited as an {{influential}} {{title in the}} video game industry {{and one of the}} best games of all time, Shadow of the Colossus is often regarded as an important example of video game as art due to its minimalist landscape designs, immersive gameplay and emotional journey. It received wide critical acclaim by the media and was met with strong sales compared to Ico, due in <b>part</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> larger marketing campaign. The soundtrack was also widely praised. The game won several awards for its audio, design, and overall quality. Shadow of the Colossus is also referenced numerous times in debates regarding the art quality and emotional perspectives of video games. A remake of the game with ultra-high definition art assets is currently in development and scheduled for release on the PlayStation 4 in 2018.|$|E
