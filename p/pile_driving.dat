25|$|The Iron Workers {{soon found}} {{themselves}} {{at war with}} the AFL and, in particular, the United Brotherhood of Carpenters and Joiners of America. The Carpenters claimed that pile-driving work, which was done primarily by Iron Workers in many areas, belonged to them and convinced the Building Trades Department to go along with them. When the Iron Workers refused to relinquish this work the AFL suspended it from membership in 1917. Other unions, such as the Lathers, then claimed that work that had historically been done by iron workers belonged to them instead. Unable to call on the support of other AFL unions in its fights with employers, the Iron Workers relented the following year and ceded <b>pile</b> <b>driving</b> work, with the exception of work related to bridge building, to the Carpenters.|$|E

Dynamic load tests were carried out by using the Case Method and the CAPWAP Method which {{were used to determine}} the {{bearing capacity}} of piles.

In the static load tests, two piles with 0. 813 m diameter and one pile with a diameter of 1. 0 m were tested. The finite element analysis was performed to back calculate the load-displacement response of piles. A hyperbolic model for soils and an elastic-plastic model for rocks were used in the study.

2500|$|Prefabricated piles {{are driven}} into the ground using a pile driver. Driven piles are either wood, {{reinforced}} concrete, or steel. Wooden piles are made from the trunks of tall trees. Concrete piles are available in square, octagonal, and round cross-sections (like Franki piles). They are reinforced with rebar and are often prestressed. Steel piles are either pipe piles {{or some sort of}} beam section (like an H-pile). Historically, wood piles used splices to join multiple segments end-to-end when the driven depth required was too long for a single pile; today, splicing is common with steel piles, though concrete piles can be spliced with mechanical and other means. Driving piles, as opposed to drilling shafts, is advantageous because the soil displaced by driving the piles compresses the surrounding soil, causing greater friction against the sides of the piles, thus increasing their load-bearing capacity. Driven piles are also considered to be [...] "tested" [...] for weight-bearing ability because of their method of installation; thus the motto of the <b>Pile</b> <b>Driving</b> Contractors' Association is [...] "A Driven Pile...Is a Tested Pile!".|$|E

30|$|Most of the {{researches}} of soil plugging effect {{focused on}} the soil plugging mechanisms of jacked or impact-driven pipe piles, instead of vibro-driven pipe piles. However, {{the difference between the}} sleeve of cast-in-place piles and pipe piles is obvious, especially when the sleeve diameter is larger or the sleeve wall thickness is thinner, which is vital to the performance of soil plug (Lehane and Gavin 2001; Randolph 2003). The vibratory sleeve driving is a complex mechanical process with respect to the interaction between the sleeve wall and the soils. It involves strong disturbance of the surrounding soils induced by vibration and extrusion, as well as the cyclic shearing and sliding between the sleeve wall and soils. In recent years, some researches on soil plugging effect during vibratory pipe <b>piles</b> <b>driving</b> were conducted according to Henke and Grabe (2008); however, these researches only {{focused on the}} soil plugging effect based on the analysis of the radial stress of the soils inside and outside the pile wall. Therefore, more researches with respect to the degree of soil plug, arching effect and influence should be investigated.|$|R
40|$|Large lateral {{movements}} of a <b>pile</b> during impact <b>driving</b> can cause yielding {{of the surrounding}} soil. When this happens, the effective stresses between the soil and the pile wall diminish, and the pile shaft resistance decreases. A piling project {{was carried out in}} a marble area in Hong Kong, where highly variable rockhead contours and deep depressions filled with weak soil deposits were found. Many steel H-piles were driven to depths of more than 100 m, and the verticality of such long piles was a concern. A pile test program consisting of four driven steel H-piles with pile lengths up to 164. 5 m was conducted. Verticality monitoring and dynamic pile tests at several penetration depths were performed. This paper aims at interpreting the verticality of the four long piles, studying the relevance of pile verticality to the encountered geological features, and studying the effect of pile verticality on the pile capacity. The maximum lateral <b>pile</b> movement during <b>driving</b> was up to 8. 7 m at a depth of 100 m, and the maximum local pile inclination reached 0. 139. The lateral {{movements of}} the <b>piles</b> during <b>driving</b> well matched the rockhead inclination and soil conditions. Both one-way sway and two-way cyclic sway of the test piles were observed. Cyclic sway was shown to cause more severe reduction of the pile shaft resistance than one-way sway.

60|$|Between Kalloo and Oordam, on the {{opposite}} side, a sand bar had been discovered, which somewhat diminished {{the depth of the}} stream and rendered <b>pile</b> <b>driving</b> comparatively easy. A strong fort was erected on each bank and the work of driving in the piles began. From each side a framework of heavy timber, supported on these massive piles, was carried out so far that the width of open water was reduced from twenty-four to thirteen hundred feet, and strong blockhouses were erected upon each pier to protect them from assault. Had a concerted attack been made by the Antwerp ships from above, and the Zeeland fleet from below, the works could at this time have been easily destroyed. But the fleet had been paralyzed by the insubordination of Treslong, and there was no plan or concert; so that although constant skirmishing went on, no serious attack was made.|$|E

40|$|BAMA Gruppen AS have {{constructed}} a new 44 000 m 2 warehouse, office and distribution centre in Groruddalen in northern parts of Oslo, Norway. Norwegian Geotechnical Institute (NGI) were employed as geotechnical consultants, contributing to evaluation of different foundation methods, design of pile foundations {{in cooperation with}} structural engineers and installation of piles {{in cooperation with the}} piling contractor. Within the perimeter of the warehouse, the depth to bedrock is between 30 to 50 meters. The typical soil profile is about 2 m of various fill material over 5 to 10 meters of stiff to very stiff clay over a slightly overconsolidated quick clay. Because of the extent of piling, concrete piles were very cost effective for the client. The stiff clay layer however could in theory lead to damaging tension stresses in the concrete <b>piles</b> during <b>driving.</b> For concrete <b>piles</b> up to 50 m length, the total number of blows is also considerable. NGI performed pile-driving simulations, and the contractor performed test-driving at the site. During test-driving, PDA equipment was mounted, monitoring <b>pile</b> stresses during <b>driving</b> of the whole pile length. Test-driving was successful, and pile stresses observed within acceptable limits. During the early phases of production driving, the number of <b>piles</b> broken during <b>driving</b> was higher than expected. The large number of piles did however give good statistical data to interpret combinations of pile cross section and hammer weight and energy (fall height) which were unfavourable. In cooperation with the piling contractor, NGI continuously evaluated the piling production procedure and stop criteria.
