5|$|Unlike the organolithium compounds, the {{organometallic}} compounds of the heavier alkali metals are predominantly ionic. The application of organosodium compounds in chemistry {{is limited in}} part due to competition from organolithium compounds, which are commercially available and exhibit more convenient reactivity. The principal organosodium compound of commercial importance is sodium cyclopentadienide. Sodium tetraphenylborate can also be classified as an organosodium compound since in the solid state sodium is bound to the aryl groups. Organometallic compounds of the higher alkali metals are even more reactive than organosodium compounds and of limited utility. A notable reagent is Schlosser's base, a mixture of n-butyllithium and potassium tert-butoxide. This reagent reacts with <b>propene</b> to form the compound allylpotassium (KCH2CHCH2). cis-2-Butene and trans-2-butene equilibrate when in contact with alkali metals. Whereas isomerisation is fast with lithium and sodium, it is slow with the heavier alkali metals. The heavier alkali metals also favour the sterically congested conformation. Several crystal structures of organopotassium compounds have been reported, establishing that they, like the sodium compounds, are polymeric. Organosodium, organopotassium, organorubidium and organocaesium compounds are all mostly ionic and are insoluble (or nearly so) in nonpolar solvents.|$|E

An explanation for the unexpected shift from 1, 2 -anti to 1, 2 -syn selectivity seen in the reaction when applying nucleophiles of different sizes in the addition to a-chloro aldehydes is offered.

40|$|Abstract-AJ This PhD work {{is focused}} on the {{development}} of a new methodology aiming at the introduction of the perfluoroalkylated side-chains into various types of molecules. Synthesis of perfluoroalkylated compounds, owing to their biological properties, is a frequent target of organic chemistry. 1 During the last couple of decades a number of different methods enabling the perfluoroalkylation have been developed. Among the classical methods belong procedures based on nucleophilic, electrophilic, or radical reactions. 2 Interestingly, only a few examples of a transition metal catalyzed perfluoroalkylation reactions have been reported. 3 Despite the fact that many of these methods have wide synthetic applicability, they are not general and search for new procedures is a desirable target. One of the possible and hitherto unexplored methods for the synthesis of perfluoroalkylated compounds is a ruthenium-complex catalyzed alkene cross-metathesis. Potentially, a reaction of a suitable terminal alkene reactant bearing a perfluoroalkylated moiety with the second terminal alkene could give rise to a new and more complex internal alkene. Regarding perfluoroalkylated alkenes suitable for the cross-metathesis reactions, (perfluoroalkyl) <b>propenes</b> can be considered as convenient substrates that can be easily prepared from [...] ...|$|R

The process occurs {{in the presence of a}} strong acting acid such as sulfuric acid or hydrofluoric acid (HF) as catalyst. Depending on the acid used, the unit takes the name of SAAU (Sulphuric Acid Alkylation Unit) or HFAU (Hydrofluoric Acid Alkylation Unit).|$|E
25|$|The chief use of ethane is the {{production}} of ethene (ethylene) by steam cracking. When diluted with steam and briefly heated to very high temperatures (900nbsp&°C or more), heavy hydrocarbons break down into lighter hydrocarbons, and saturated hydrocarbons become unsaturated. Ethane is favored for ethene production because the steam cracking of ethane is fairly selective for ethene, while the steam cracking of heavier hydrocarbons yields a product mixture poorer in ethene and richer in heavier alkenes (olefins), such as <b>propene</b> (propylene) and butadiene, and in aromatic hydrocarbons.|$|E
25|$|Steam {{cracking}} is a petrochemical {{process in}} which saturated hydrocarbons are broken down into smaller, often unsaturated, hydrocarbons. It is the principal industrial method for producing the lighter alkenes (or commonly olefins), including ethene (or ethylene) and <b>propene</b> (or propylene). Steam cracker units are facilities in which a feedstock such as naphtha, liquefied petroleum gas (LPG), ethane, propane or butane is thermally cracked {{through the use of}} steam in a bank of pyrolysis furnaces to produce lighter hydrocarbons. The products obtained depend on the composition of the feed, the hydrocarbon-to-steam ratio, and on the cracking temperature and furnace residence time.|$|E
40|$|The role of {{chlorine}} as a substituent upon ionization, protonation and electrophilic addition of HCl {{has been studied}} by means of computational chemistry and photoelectron spectroscopy. Gas-phase carbon 1 s photoelectron spectra of four chlorinated methanes (CClnH 4 −n, n= 1, 2, 3, 4), six chlorinated ethenes (C 2 ClnH 6 −n) and seven chlorinated <b>propenes</b> are recorded. The spectra are analyzed by means of theoretical modeling and ionization energies for each inequivalent carbon are extracted. Furthermore, ground-state potentials for each site are computed and thereby the ionization energies can be decomposed into contributions from the ground state and relaxation, e. g. delocalization of charge in the final state. It is found that chlorine primarily acts by making the ground-state potential of the neighboring carbon more positive. However, upon ionization, chlorine also donates {{a significant amount of}} electrons both to a neighboring carbon and to a second-nearest π-bonded neighbor. Activation energies for the electrophilic addition of HCl to the chlorinated ethenes and <b>propenes</b> are computed and probably we overestimate the energies by about 10 % compared to experimental results. Protonation enthalpies are predicted with uncertainties of 0. 09 eV or less. We find that chlorine upon protonation act as an effective electron donor via the π-system if in a neighboring position to the protonated carbon and that the effective donation is much larger for protonation than for ionization and electrophilic addition. The explanation is that the protonated site has an enhanced ability to accept electrons compared to if the same site is ionized or is subject to an electrophilic addition. At room temperature, both 3 -chloropropene and 2, 3 -dichloropropene possess two stable rotational conformers. As a part of the theoretical modeling of a spectrum, we predict a theoretical vibrational lineshape for each chemical inequivalent site in the molecule. As the theoretical lineshapes for each of these rotamers are qualitatively different, the relative intensities of the vibrational lineshapes could be optimized and thereby relative populations could be determined. Adsorption of 1, 1 -dichloroethene (Cl 2 C=CH 2) to a Si(111) - 7 × 7 surface is studied by means of XPS. It is found that 1 / 3 of the molecules break one C-Cl bond and 2 / 3 break both C-Cl bonds when chemisorbing to the surface. Physisorption spectra were compared to gas-phase spectra of the same compound, and it is found that except for broadening caused by the polarizable surface, the gas-phase spectrum constitutes an excellent model for the spectrum of the physisorbed species. We recommend that gas-phase spectra are used on a routine basis when assigning spectra of physisorbed species. Comparing to experiments, we find that we are able to compute theoretical ionization energies within chemical accuracy, e. g. within 0. 04 eV. However, our computed C-Cl bond lengths have deviations in the range of 0. 6 pm whereas the desired accuracy is ± 0. 1 pm. The inaccuracy is related to a very slow basis set convergence for chlorine, making it a demanding substituent to model. </p...|$|R

40|$|International audienceA {{synthetic}} procedure {{yielding a}} mixture of Z- and E- 1 -propenyl isocyanide (CH(3) CH═CHNC) is described. The microwave spectrum of this mixture has been recorded in the 12 - 100 GHz spectral range, and the spectra of the Z and E isomers have been assigned for the first time. Most transitions of the Z form were split into two components of equal intensity due to tunneling of the methyl group, which allowed the barrier to internal rotation of this group to be determined as 4. 0124 (12) kJ/mol by fitting 568 transitions with a maximum value of J = 46 using the computer program Xiam. This fit had a root-mean-square deviation as large as 4. 325. The same transitions were therefore fitted anew using the more sophisticated program Erham. This fit has a rms deviation marginally better (4. 136) than the Xiam fit. No split MW lines were found for E- 1 -propenyl isocyanide. The absence of splittings is ascribed to a barrier to internal rotation of the methyl group that is {{significantly higher than the}} barrier of the Z isomer. It is concluded that the barrier must be larger than 6 kJ/mol for the E form. The experimental work was augmented by quantum chemical calculations at CCSD/cc-pVTZ, B 3 LYP/cc-pVTZ, and MP 2 /cc-pVTZ levels of theory. The CCSD method predicts rotational constants of the Z and E forms well. The B 3 LYP barriers to internal rotation of a series of substituted <b>propenes</b> were calculated and found to be in good agreement with experiments.

25|$|The fastest {{reactions}} {{tend to be}} in {{the order}} of triple-bonded > double-bonded > single bonded molecules, and also lower molecular weight molecules are faster than higher ones. So acetylene is faster than ethylene, and ethylene is faster than <b>propene,</b> etc. The molecular weight factor in polymer deposition is dependent on the monomer flow rate, in which a higher molecular weight monomer typically near 200 g/mol needs a much higher flow rate of 15 g/cm2, whereas lower molecular weights around 50 g/mol require a flow rate of only 5 g/cm2. A heavy monomer therefore needs a faster flow, and would likely lead to increased pressures, decreasing polymerization rates.|$|E

Because the reaction is exothermic, cooling is needed: SAAU plants require lower temperatures so the cooling medium needs to be chilled, for HFAU normal refinery cooling water will suffice. It {{is important to keep}} a high ratio of Isobutane to Alkene at the point of reaction to prevent side reactions which produces a lower octane product, so the plants have a high recycle of Isobutane back to feed. The phases separate spontaneously, so the acid phase is vigorously mixed with the hydrocarbon phase to create sufficient contact surface.|$|E
25|$|A higher {{cracking}} temperature (also {{referred to}} as severity) favors the production of ethene and benzene, whereas lower severity produces higher amounts of <b>propene,</b> C4-hydrocarbons and liquid products. The process also results in the slow deposition of coke, a form of carbon, on the reactor walls. This degrades {{the efficiency of the}} reactor, so reaction conditions are designed to minimize this. Nonetheless, a steam cracking furnace can usually only run for a few months at a time between de-cokings. Decokes require the furnace to be isolated from the process and then a flow of steam or a steam/air mixture is passed through the furnace coils. This converts the hard solid carbon layer to carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide. Once this reaction is complete, the furnace can be returned to service.|$|E

Incondensable are from a chemical perspective similar to diluents but they do not condense at the pressure and temperature of the process, and therefore they concentrate to a point that must be vented.
