25|$|In {{a digital}} circuit, an FSM may be built using a <b>programmable</b> <b>logic</b> device, a <b>programmable</b> <b>logic</b> controller, logic gates and flip flops or relays.

40|$|One of {{the methods}} for {{designing}} digital devices is {{through the use of}} <b>programmable</b> <b>logics.</b> What is necessary for the separate stages of designing is both constructing and using different descriptions. For this purpose, languages for hardware description like VHDL (Very Hardware Description Language), ABEL, Verilog and others are used. With their help we construct structural and behavioral descriptions of the objects designed. These sets of descriptions are then used for drawing up the models of devices we’re going to be in need of for their designing. This paper presents developed VHDL descriptions of arithmetic-logistic units. We have both structural and behavioral models described, the latter being simulated in WebPack. The paper also features final results and analyses. The paper is an element of a database of project decisions for digital schemes and units on the basis of <b>programmable</b> <b>logics,</b> currently developed by our team...|$|R

25|$|Since {{the rise}} of {{reconfigurable}} <b>programmable</b> <b>logic</b> devices, sharing of logic designs has been a form of open-source hardware. Instead of the schematics, hardware description language (HDL) code is shared. HDL descriptions are commonly used to set up system-on-a-chip systems either in field-programmable gate arrays (FPGA) or directly in application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC) designs. HDL modules, when distributed, are called semiconductor intellectual property cores, or IP cores.|$|E

25|$|Industrial {{automation}} incorporates <b>programmable</b> <b>logic</b> controllers in {{the manufacturing}} process. <b>Programmable</b> <b>logic</b> controllers (PLCs) use a processing system which allows for variation of controls of inputs and outputs using simple programming. PLCs make use of programmable memory, storing instructions and functions like logic, sequencing, timing, counting, etc. Using a logic based language, a PLC can receive a variety of inputs and return a variety of logical outputs, the input devices being sensors and output devices being motors, valves, etc. PLCs are similar to computers, however, while computers are optimized for calculations, PLCs are optimized for control task and use in industrial environments. They are built so that only basic logic-based programming knowledge is needed and to handle vibrations, high temperatures, humidity and noise. The greatest advantage PLCs offer is their flexibility. With the same basic controllers, a PLC can operate a range of different control systems. PLCs make it unnecessary to rewire a system to change the control system. This flexibility leads to a cost-effective system for complex and varied control systems.|$|E

40|$|This paper proposes novel {{universal}} {{logic gates}} using the current quantization characteristics of nanodevices. In nanodevices like the electron waveguide (EW) and single-electron (SE) turnstile, the channel current is a staircase quantized function of its control voltage. We use this unique characteristic to compactly realize Boolean functions. First we present {{the concept of}} the periodic-threshold threshold logic gate (PTTG), and we build a compact PTTG using EW and SE turnstiles. We show that an arbitrary three-input Boolean function can be realized with a single PTTG, and an arbitrary four-input Boolean function can be realized by using two PTTGs. We then use one PTTG to build a universal <b>programmable</b> two-input <b>logic</b> gate which can be used to realize all two-input Boolean functions. We also build a <b>programmable</b> three-input <b>logic</b> gate by using one PTTG. Compared with linear threshold logic gates, with the PTTG one can build digital circuits more compactly. The proposed PTTGs are promising for future smart nanoscale digital system use...|$|R
25|$|Most modern PID {{controllers}} {{in industry}} are implemented in {{distributed control systems}} (DCS), <b>programmable</b> <b>logic</b> controllers (PLCs), or as a panel-mounted digital controller.

Users of such systems do not accept product obsolescence {{at the same rate as}} domestic users, and it is entirely likely that despite having been installed over 20 years ago, many 68000-based controllers will continue in reliable service well into the 21st century.|$|E
25|$|Computers {{can perform}} both {{sequential}} control and feedback control, and typically a single computer will do both {{in an industrial}} application. <b>Programmable</b> <b>logic</b> controllers (PLCs) are a type of special purpose microprocessor that replaced many hardware components such as timers and drum sequencers used in relay logic type systems. General purpose process control computers have increasingly replaced stand alone controllers, with a single computer able to perform the operations of hundreds of controllers. Process control computers can process data from a network of PLCs, instruments and controllers in order to implement typical (such as PID) control of many individual variables or, in some cases, to implement complex control algorithms using multiple inputs and mathematical manipulations. They can also analyze data and create real time graphical displays for operators and run reports for operators, engineers and management.|$|E
