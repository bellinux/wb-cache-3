50|$|Although only {{described}} {{towards the}} very end of the twentieth century, N. benstonei was probably first collected in July 1911 by Henry Nicholas Ridley on Mount Tahan in Pahang. The Ridley 16097 series comprises three herbarium sheets: one deposited at the Singapore herbarium and two at Kew. The former consists of a climbing stem fragment with two upper <b>pitchers</b> <b>and</b> two female inflorescences. The two sheets at Kew are barcoded K000651565 (climbing stem with immature female inflorescence but no <b>pitchers)</b> <b>and</b> K000651564 (climbing stem with upper <b>pitchers),</b> <b>and</b> differ significantly in morphology. Ridley referred the Ridley 16097 material to N. singalana.|$|R

50|$|WAR {{values are}} scaled equally for <b>pitchers</b> <b>and</b> batters; that is, <b>pitchers</b> <b>and</b> {{position}} players will have {{roughly the same}} WAR if their contribution to their team is deemed similar. However, the values are calculated differently for <b>pitchers</b> <b>and</b> position players: position players are evaluated using statistics for fielding <b>and</b> hitting, while <b>pitchers</b> are evaluated using statistics related to the opposing batters' hits, walks, and strikeouts in Fangraphs' version and runs allowed per 9 innings with a team defense adjustment for Baseball Reference's version. Because the independent WAR frameworks are calculated differently, {{they do not have}} the same scale and cannot be used interchangeably in an analytical context.|$|R

5|$|Since 1957, {{there have}} been five Gold Glove batteries. The <b>pitcher</b> <b>and</b> catcher, collectively known as the battery, {{are the only two}} players on the field {{involved}} in every pitch. In particular, the <b>pitcher</b> <b>and</b> catcher control the running game with tools such as pickoffs or the strength of the catcher's throwing arm. The first <b>pitcher</b> <b>and</b> catcher on the same team to win Gold Gloves in the same year were Jim Kaat and Earl Battey, with the Minnesota Twins in 1962. Only two pairs of batterymates have won Gold Gloves together more than once: Iván Rodríguez and Kenny Rogers won with the Texas Rangers in 2000, and again with the Detroit Tigers in 2004 and 2006. Yadier Molina and Adam Wainwright matched the feat, winning in both 2009 and 2013.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} the characteristics of physical fitness in baseball <b>pitchers</b> <b>and</b> infielders focusing on variations in power output ability and stretch-shortening cycle (SSC) ability in field tests. Twenty-five male university <b>pitchers</b> <b>and</b> 22 university infielders participated. They performed five kinds of jumping (Standing triple jump (STJ), Standing double leg triple jump (SDTJ), Standing long jump (SLJ), Counter movement jump (CMJ), 5 rebound jumps (RJ)), and five kinds of medicine ball throw (Overhead throw (OT), Back throw (BT), Push of upper limb (Push), Shoulder horizontal adduction (SHA) and Twist of trunk throw (Twist)). Push, SHA and Twist were performed purely concentrically (concentric throw: CT) and with SSC movement (rebound throw: RT). These powers were assessed using the Throw index (Tauchi et al., 2006), and pre-stretch augmentations (Walshe et al., 1996) were calculated. It was found that: 1) OT, BT <b>and</b> SDTJ in <b>pitchers</b> were significantly higher than in infielders, and that there were significant correlations between pitched ball speed and OT, BT, and SDTJ. 2) Push RT-index and Push CT-index in infielders were significant higher than in <b>pitchers,</b> <b>and</b> significant correlations were found between thrown ball speed, batted ball speed and Push RT-index and Push CT-index in infielders. 3) SHA augmentation in infielders was significantly higher than in <b>pitchers,</b> <b>and</b> there was a significant correlation between thrown ball speed and SHA augmentation in infielders. 4) Twist of trunk power did not differ between <b>pitchers</b> <b>and</b> fielders. These results indicate that baseball <b>pitchers</b> <b>and</b> infielders obtain different physical fitness characteristics through the differences in their movement forms and required abilities...|$|R
