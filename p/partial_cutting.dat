50|$|Wounds {{inflicted on}} {{residual}} trees during <b>partial</b> <b>cutting</b> often provide portals for decay fungi. Affected trees {{are prone to}} blowdown and breakage at the wound site, {{and even if they}} survive to rotation age their value is reduced by staining and decay in the wood. The influence of temperature on microbial diversity in wounds in white and black spruces was investigated by Dumas and McLaughlin (2003). Samples were taken from trees wounded during manual or feller-buncher <b>partial</b> <b>cutting</b> and skidding operations in the Black Sturgeon Forest, 120 km northeast of Thunder Bay, Ontario. The samples were taken from 76 trees in early October when the mean aerial temperature exceeded 0 °C and 23 trees in late October/early November when the mean aerial temperature was below 0 °C, to serve as the pre-freeze-up and post-freeze-up groups, respectively. The wounds were sampled and cultured. The number and ratio of bacteria, actinomycetes, and fungi on one-week-old wounds varied between pre- and post- freeze-up wounds, wound locations, and media. However, random samples of the different classes of microbes isolated from the 2 spruce species did not differ significantly, indicating no relationship between tree species and microbe. Wounds were more common on stems (94) than on roots (64) or butts (33). Wounds on roots averaged 2 and 3 times the area of those on stems and butts, respectively. More bacteria than fungi were isolated from the pre-freeze-up wounds than from the post-freeze-up wounds, while fungi were more plentiful than bacteria on the post freeze-up wounds.|$|E

Hybrid spruce (the complex of white spruce, Sitka spruce, and occasionally Engelmann spruce) {{was one of several}} coniferous species used in a study in the Moist Cold subzone of the Interior Cedar-Hemlock zone in northwestern British Columbia. A total of 109 gaps were selected from a population of openings created by logging within each light and heavy <b>partial</b> <b>cutting</b> treatment in stands averaging 30 m in canopy height; 76 gaps were less than 1000 m2, 33 were between 1000 m2 and 5000 m2. Canopy gap size was calculated as the area of an ellipse, the major axis of which was the longest line that could be run from canopy edge to canopy edge inside the gap, and the minor axis was the longest line that could be run from canopy edge perpendicular to the long line. Seedlings were planted in gaps and in the undisturbed and clearcut treatment units. There were strong and consistent trends in growth response among the seedlings as gap size increased. In all species, growth increased rapidly from small single-tree gaps to about 1000 m2, but thereafter, there was little change up to 5000 m2. Tree size and current growth rates for all species were highest in full open conditions. In large and medium gaps (300-1000 m2), the largest trees of all species occurred in the middle gap position, with little difference between the sunny north and shady south positions, lodgepole pine excepted. The light advantage expected off the north end of higher-latitude gaps was not a benefit for tree growth, suggesting that below-ground effects of canopy edge trees have an important influence of seedling growth in these forests (Coates 2000).|$|E
50|$|There is {{no direct}} known control for aspen trunk rot. There are {{management}} steps to preserve healthy stands of aspen. As a rule older stands contain a {{greater amount of}} decayed heartwood than young stands. Maintaining healthy stands and preventing mechanical and fire damage reduces the likelihood of disease. This is because trees with open wounds, frost cracks or conks {{are more susceptible to}} the fungus. This makes it hard to prevent because {{it can be difficult to}} prevent wounds on the tree. To reduce the impact that causing wounds can have, it is recommended that development of recreation areas not be in aspen stands because they could become more susceptible to decay and disease following injury caused by humans. It is also recommended that <b>partial</b> <b>cutting</b> to thin and remove defective trees not be used as a management technique because residual stands often deteriorate within 5 years. Instead the goal should be to maintain uniform, well-stocked stands and harvest the whole stand before the decay becomes excessive.|$|E
40|$|Application. A partial {{overstory}} did {{not influence}} {{the number of}} stumps that sprouted {{or the number of}} sprouts per clump. Sprout clump survival and growth of dominant sprouts can be maximized under heavy <b>partial</b> <b>cuttings.</b> Additional overstory removal or sprout clump thinning may be necessary to maintain vigor of stump sprouts beneath partial overstories. Abstract. A 28 -year-old water oak (Quercus nigra L.) plantation was thinned from below to either 254 or 462 stems per hectare to determine the influence of a partial canopy on oak stump sprout development. Sprout clump survival, number of living sprouts in a clump, and height and DBH of the dominant sprout in a clump were measured in years l- 5 and 7 after harvest. By year 7, sprout clump survival under the heavily thinned canopy was 23 % higher than under the lightly thinned canopy. Within-clump sprout mortality was not influenced by overstory thinning level, but by year 2 height and diameter increment were 15 % and 22 % greater, respectively, under the heavy overstory removal. Positive height and diameter growth of dominant sprouts continued under both canopy conditions through year 7, but early benefits of the heavy overstory removal on sprout growth diminished. Additional overstory removal or sprout clump thinning would be necessary to sustain sprout clump survival and sprout growth over extended periods...|$|R
40|$|In the West, {{thinning}} and <b>partial</b> <b>cuttings</b> {{are being}} considered for treating millions of forested acres that are overstocked and prone to wildfire. The objectives of these treatments include tree growth redistribution, tree species regulation, timber harvest, wildlife habitat improvement, and wildfire-hazard reduction. Depending on the forest type and its structure, thinning has {{both positive and negative}} impacts on crown fire potential. Crown bulk density, surface fuel, and crown base height are primary stand characteristics that determine crown fire potential. Thinning from below, free thinning, and reserve tree shelterwoods have the greatest opportunity for reducing the risk of crown fire behavior. Selection thinning and crown thinning that maintain multiple crown layers, along with individual tree selection systems, will not reduce the risk of crown fires except in the driest ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa Dougl. ex Laws.) forests. Moreover, unless the surface fuels created by using these treatments are themselves treated, intense surface wildfire may result, likely negating positive effects of reducing crown fire potential. No single thinning approach can be applied {{to reduce the risk of}} wildfires in the multiple forest types of the West. The best general approach for managing wildfire damage seems to be managing tree density and species composition with well-designed silvicultural systems at a landscape scale that includes a mix of thinning, surface fuel treatments, and prescribed fire with proactive treatment in areas with high risk to wildfire...|$|R

40|$|The stand {{dynamics}} {{and production of}} two one-acre plots of eastern hemlock (Tsuga canadensis L) in Connecticut have been followed {{for more than six}} decades. Data were recorded for all individual trees. One plot (Saltonstall) was established in 1924 after the removal of a hardwood overstory. This stand had a nearly pure, almost fully closed understory of hemlock that was subjected to <b>partial</b> <b>cuttings</b> in 1936, 1954, and 1956. The stand was lost to the hemlock woolly adelgid (Adelges tsugae) in 1993. The other plot (Perry) was established in 1931 in a nearly pure hemlock stand that had arisen on an abandoned pasture around 1850. This plot had a crop-tree release cutting in 1931 and has not been infested with hemlock woolly adelgid. Both plots developed a rotated sigmoid diameter distribution, characteristic of uneven-aged forests, after sixty years of management. The 1936 attempt at group-selection cutting in the Saltonstall plot did not maintain the reverse J-shaped diameter distribution that had initially existed. The stand was essentially even-aged and the diameter distribution shifted to a broad bell-shaped form and then to a rotated sigmoid curve when a new age class grew large enough {{to be included in the}} tally. The thinning of the Perry plot also turned the initial bell-shaped diameter-distribution curve to the rotated sigmoid form for the same reason. Annual periodic increment (including harvested volumes) was 52 and 50 cubic feet/acre for the Saltonstall and Perry plot, respectively. Annual basal area growth decreased from over 3 ft 2 /acre to approximately 2 ft 2 /acre on both plots over sixty years.

The objects {{of this study were}} to investigate the effects of fire and coarse woody debris (CWD) increment on early tree succession and tree species diversity along forest – gap gradient 10 years after restorative <b>partial</b> <b>cuttings</b> in southern Finland. Seedling densities and heights, microhabitat distributions and tree species diversity were compared between four restoration treatments; unburned treatments with 5 and 60 m 3 CWD ha- 1, and burned treatments with 5 and 60 m 3 CWD ha- 1. Total seedling densities were tested with two-way analysis of variance. Species diversity was analyzed by species richness and Shannon index, which were tested with two-way analysis of variance. In general, the burned treatments included higher seedling densities and higher seedlings. The different amounts of dead wood revealed differences in deciduous tree species. The density of birch was higher in the treatments with 60 m 3 CWD ha- 1 and the heights of birch and other deciduous tree species were higher in burned treatment with 60 m 3 CWD ha- 1. Pine and birch were abundant in the burned treatments. The densities of spruce were very high in the unburned treatment with 5 m 3 CWD ha- 1, but fairly low in the other treatments. The seedling densities and heights were the lowest in the forest. Seedling densities did not vary significantly between the edge and gap segment. Microhabitat distributions of the coniferous seedlings differed between the unburned and burned treatments, but no clear differences were observed between the low (5 m 3 ha- 1) and high amount (60 m 3 ha- 1) of CWD. Microhabitat distributions of seedlings between forest, edge and gap did not differ noticeably, except with spruce in the burned treatments between the edge and gap. Tree species diversity of regeneration was slightly higher in the burned than in the unburned treatments. Different amounts of CWD did not affect the tree species diversity. The tree species diversity was significantly lower in the forest than in the treatment area, but it did not differ between the edge and gap. The results indicate that early tree succession is likely to be more abundant after burning than without. Fire as a restoration tool can be suggested for the regeneration of pine and birch. Dead wood appears to be insignificant for early tree succession. The limited size of restoration areas does not impede the tree succession, since the densities and heights of seedlings were generally the highest near the forest edge. Fire might increase tree species diversity...|$|R
