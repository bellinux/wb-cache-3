The penal bond, although an artifact of historical interest, fell out of use by the early part of the nineteenth century in the United States.|$|E

2500|$|Early {{common law}} cases held that <b>performance</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>contract</b> {{always had to}} take place. No matter what {{hardship}} was encountered contracting parties had absolute liability on their obligations. In the 19th century the courts developed a doctrine that contracts which became impossible to perform would be frustrated and automatically come to an end. In Taylor v Caldwell Blackburn J held that when the Surrey Gardens Music Hall unexpectedly burnt down, the owners {{did not have to}} pay compensation to the business that had leased it for an extravagant performance, because it was neither party's fault. An assumption underlying all contracts (a [...] "condition precedent") is that they are possible to perform. People would not ordinarily contract to do something they knew was going to be impossible. Apart from physical impossibility, frustration could be down to a contract becoming illegal to perform, for instance if war breaks out and the government bans trade to a belligerent country, or perhaps if the whole purpose of an agreement is destroyed by another event, like renting a room to watch a cancelled coronation parade. But a contract is not frustrated merely because a subsequent event makes the agreement harder to perform than expected, as for instance in Davis Contractors Ltd v Fareham UDC where a builder unfortunately had to spend more time and money doing a job than he would be paid for because of an unforeseen shortage of labour and supplies. The House of Lords denied his claim for contract to be declared frustrated so he could claim quantum meruit. Because the doctrine of frustration is a matter of construction of the contract, it can be contracted around, through what are called [...] "force majeure" [...] clauses. Similarly, a contract can have a force majeure clause that would bring a contract to an end more easily than would common law construction. In The Super Servant Two Wijsmuller BV contracted to hire out a self-propelling barge to J. Lauritzen A/S, who wanted to tow another ship from Japan to Rotterdam, but had a provision stating the contract would terminate if some event made it difficult related to the 'perils or dangers and accidents of the sea'. Wijsmuller BV also had a choice of whether to provide either The Superservant One or Two. They chose Two and it sank. The Court of Appeal held that the impossibility to perform the agreement was down to Wijsmuller's own choice, and so it was not frustrated, but that the force majeure clause did cover it. The effect of a contract being frustrated is that it is that both parties are prospectively discharged from performing their side of the bargain. If one side has already paid money over or conferred another valuable benefit, but not got anything in return yet, contrary to the prior common law position, the Law Reform (Frustrated Contracts) Act 1943 gives the court discretion to let the claimant recover a 'just sum', and that means whatever the court thinks fit in all the circumstances.|$|E

40|$|This study {{investigates the}} design <b>of</b> <b>a</b> {{time-based}} procurement <b>contract</b> when <b>a</b> supplier possesses private information about intrinsic completion time and {{may choose to}} exert time reduction effort. We first derive the optimal (complex) contract for the buyer, and then evaluate the <b>performance</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> (simple) fixed-price and fixed-time (FPFT) contract. Our analysis shows that {{the structure of the}} optimal time-based <b>contract</b> and the <b>performance</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> FPFT <b>contract</b> depend largely on time reduction forms. Specifically, if time reduction follows a multiplicative model, the optimal contract induces the intrinsically slow supplier to reduce time, and offers a fixed payment to the intrinsically fast supplier. This result is opposite to what could occur when time reduction follows an additive model. We also show that, in a specific multiplicative model, the FPFT contract achieves at least eight-ninth of the available surplus for the buyer, whereas the <b>performance</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> FPFT <b>contract</b> deteriorates dramatically in an additive model. In response to this underperformance, we then propose <b>an</b> enhanced linear <b>contract,</b> and demonstrate that, using this contract, the buyer loses no more than one-sixteenth of the available surplus. Our results shed light on the important effect of time reduction forms on time-based contract design. Restricted Access: Metadata Onl...|$|R

50|$|For the defense, Mr. Wentworth, without calling witnesses, in {{his address}} to the Court, stated that the {{defendant}} would not have resisted the payment of the rent {{if he could have}} discovered for what he was paying such, having frequently applied to Mr Campbell for the boundaries of his farm, but without being able to obtain them. In consequence of which, had the defendant been disposed to impound any cattle, he could not have done so without making himself liable to an action at law for a trespass. Another important fact was, that the defendant carried on a trade in supplying the shipping in the harbour with ballast, by the consent of the plaintiff; and yet although the farm ought to have been held sacred to the lessee, and which in fact the lessor was bound to secure to his tenant, <b>a</b> person <b>of</b> the name of Cunningham was in the habit of taking away quantities of soil for ballast, under the sanction <b>of</b> <b>an</b> order from the Colonial Secretary.

40|$|The <b>performance</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>contracting</b> {{company is}} closely {{linked with the}} quality of the {{decisions}} at the strategic level. However, the increasing complexity of organizations’ internal and external environments and the unstructured nature of decisions at the strategic level make the decision making a very complicated task. The number of influential variables is so large and their effects are so varied that any attempt to encapsulate them in a rational manner can indeed hinder the decision making process. To this end, this research explores the advantages of decision support tools and the benefit these tools can yield for the strategic management. Some of these tools are deterministic and structured: they rely on straightforward calculation or optimisation techniques. The solution to the unstructured problems, however, has relied on heuristic approaches and judgement of the decision-maker. While deterministic problems have to a large extent been addressed and appropriate models and algorithm have been developed for them, the unstructured problems have remained relatively unattended and the research works in this area tend to focus on single issues. This paper conceptualizes an umbrella framework using a “Viable Systems Diagnosis” VSD Model and a "Decision Framework", within which strategic decision making research applicable to construction can be coordinated and developed, thus avoiding wasteful duplication and gaps in knowledge. To this end, the research highlights the relevance and potential use of artificial intelligent techniques in assisting the managers with unstructured decisions. Further, it is argued that a strategic decision support system should assume an integrated structure, as many decision nodes, within the overall decision making structure, share common attributes and the inter-connection amongst these decision nodes has a complex structure. Therefore, the object oriented approach will provide an efficient structure {{for the development of the}} overall framework...|$|R
