2500|$|Early in {{her career}} Amos {{released}} many CD singles in conjunction with her albums—so many that a book called Tori Amos Collectibles was published in 1997 cataloging her world-wide releases, test pressings and bootlegs to that date. One of Amos' best selling early releases is the five-track Crucify EP. Amos' penchant for including non-album B-sides on each of her singles was {{a major factor in}} her initial popularity, particularly her cover of the Nirvana song [...] "Smells Like Teen Spirit" [...] from the aforementioned EP, which garnered significant press attention and critical praise. Many of Amos' B-sides are featured on the box set A Piano: The Collection (2006). With the production of CD singles becoming less common in the music business {{around the turn of the}} century, Amos has released far fewer B-sides since her contract with Epic Records began. As a result, B-sides for Scarlet's Walk were released through the internet and on an EP titled Scarlet's Hidden Treasures (2004), the sole B-side for The Beekeeper was released as on the DVD included in the album's limited edition version, and B-sides for American Doll Posse were distributed depending on packaging and <b>place</b> <b>of</b> <b>purchase.</b>|$|E

METHODS We have used data from the Pesquisa de Orçamento Familiar (Household Budget Survey) of 2008 - 2009 {{with a sample of}} 152, 895 subjects over 10 years <b>of</b> age. The <b>purchase</b> <b>of</b> food outside the home was collected from the records of all expenditures made in seven days. The <b>places</b> <b>of</b> <b>purchase</b> were grouped according to their characteristics: supermarket, bakery, street food, restaurant, snack bar, fruit shop, and other <b>places.</b> The types <b>of</b> food were grouped into nine categories, considering the nutritional aspects and the marketing characteristics of the item. We have estimated the frequency <b>of</b> <b>purchase</b> in the seven groups <b>of</b> <b>places</b> in Brazil and according to gender and type <b>of</b> food <b>purchased</b> per <b>place.</b> We have calculated the average age, income and years of education, as well as the per capita expenditure according to <b>places</b> <b>of</b> <b>purchase</b> <b>of</b> food consumed outside the home. RESULTS The <b>purchase</b> <b>of</b> food outside the home was reported by 41. 2 % of the subjects, being it greater among men than women (44 % versus 38. 5 %). Adults had a higher frequency (46 %) than teenagers (37. 7 %) and older adults (24. 2 %). The highest frequency <b>of</b> <b>places</b> <b>of</b> <b>purchase</b> were snack bar (16. 9 %) and restaurant (16. 4 %), while the fruit shop (1. 2 %) presented the lowest frequency. Sweets, snack chips and soft drinks were the most purchased items in most places. Average expenditure was higher for restaurant (R$ 33. 20) and lower for fruit shop (R$ 4. 10) and street food (R$ 5. 00). CONCLUSIONS The highest percentage of food consumed outside the home comes from snack bars and restaurants, pointing to important places for the development of public policies focused on promoting healthy eating...|$|R

6000|$|She listened so {{well that}} she was really {{listening}} after he had ceased to speak. He had kept his grasp of her, drawing her close, and though they had again, for the time, stopped walking, his talk--for others at a distance--might have been, in the matchless place, that of any impressed tourist to any slightly more detached companion. On possessing himself of her arm he had made her turn, so that they faced afresh to Saint Mark's, over the great presence of which his eyes moved while she twiddled her parasol. She now, however, made a motion that confronted them finally with the opposite end. Then only she spoke--"Please take your hand out of my arm." [...] He understood at once: she had made out {{in the shade of}} the gallery the issue of the others from their <b>place</b> <b>of</b> <b>purchase.</b> So they went to them side by side, and it was all right. The others had seen them as well and waited for them, complacent enough, under one of the arches. They themselves too--he argued that Kate would argue--looked perfectly ready, decently patient, properly accommodating. They themselves suggested nothing worse--always by Kate's system--than a pair of the children of a supercivilised age making the best of an awkwardness. They didn't nevertheless hurry--that would overdo it; so he had time to feel, as it were, what he felt. He felt, ever so distinctly--it was with this he faced Mrs. Lowder--that he was already in a sense possessed of what he wanted. There was more to come--everything; he had by no means, with his companion, had it all out. Yet what he was possessed of was real--the fact that she hadn't thrown over his lucidity the horrid shadow of cheap reprobation. Of this he had had so sore a fear that its being dispelled was in itself of the nature of bliss. The danger had dropped--it was behind him there in the great sunny space. So far she was good for what he wanted.|$|E
