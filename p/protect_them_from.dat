5|$|Active and cheerful, the Russian Toy was {{originally}} bred {{both as an}} anti-rat dog and a watch dog. The second quality is still active in the breed, {{and they can be}} very vocal. They can become quite attached to their family, regardless of the ages of the family members. Russian Toys are usually very reserved with strangers, but very loyal to their owners, always ready to <b>protect</b> <b>them</b> <b>from</b> any perceived danger.|$|E
5|$|In 1831, Mexican {{authorities}} {{gave the}} settlers of Gonzales a small cannon to help <b>protect</b> <b>them</b> <b>from</b> frequent Comanche raids. Over {{the next four}} years, the political situation in Mexico deteriorated, and in 1835 several states revolted. As the unrest spread, Colonel Domingo de Ugartechea, the commander of all Mexican troops in Texas, felt it unwise to leave the residents of Gonzales with a weapon and requested {{the return of the}} cannon.|$|E
50|$|In Fijian mythology, Dakuwaqa (Dakuwanga) is a shark-god. He {{was greatly}} {{respected}} by fishermen because he <b>protected</b> <b>them</b> <b>from</b> any danger at sea and sometimes <b>protected</b> <b>them</b> <b>from</b> evil denizens of the sea.|$|R

Jon also gives Sam the specific mission of traveling to the Citadel in Oldtown to become a maester, so that he may better understand {{the threat of the}} Others and eventually succeed Maester Aemon.|$|E
5|$|Later, when Rosier has an {{accident}} outside the village, he is rescued by the Romani, who treat the mayor with their traditional healing practices. He sells them his father's house, {{in order to}} <b>protect</b> <b>them</b> <b>from</b> the Fascist policy of imprisoning the homeless. Lundi enrolls the children in her school. The freedom-loving Romani recognize that these French {{are trying to help}} but struggled with life in a fixed place and the rules of formal education.|$|E
5|$|Many {{saltwater}} fish manufacture {{large amounts of}} trimethylamine oxide to <b>protect</b> <b>them</b> <b>from</b> the high osmotic effects of their environment; conversion of this compound to dimethylamine {{is responsible for the}} early odour in unfresh {{saltwater fish}}. In animals, free radical nitric oxide (derived from an amino acid), serves as an important regulatory molecule for circulation.|$|E

25|$|Tufted puffins are preyed upon {{by various}} avian raptors such as snowy owls, bald eagles and {{peregrine}} falcons, and mammals like the Arctic fox. Foxes seem to prefer the puffin over other birds, making the bird a main target.

5|$|Once Allied {{troops were}} on the ground, some German units used the Rommelspargel for defense, by cutting them down and using the logs to {{reinforce}} impromptu positions. Sturmmann Karl Vasold of the 12th SS Panzer Division Hitlerjugend described how his unit dug in under fire in a tank trench and foxholes on the road from Buron to Villons-les-Buissons, and used cut-down Rommelspargel poles to cover their positions and <b>protect</b> <b>them</b> <b>from</b> enemy fire.|$|E
5|$|Some {{birds and}} insects use {{defensive}} regurgitation {{to ward off}} predators. The northern fulmar vomits a bright orange, oily substance called stomach oil when threatened. The stomach oil is made from their aquatic diets. It causes the predator's feathers to mat, leading {{to the loss of}} flying ability and the loss of water repellency. This is especially dangerous for aquatic birds because their water repellent feathers <b>protect</b> <b>them</b> <b>from</b> hypothermia when diving for food.|$|E
5|$|The {{archives}} {{are housed}} in a building south of and connected to the main building, which also contains NARA facilities. The Clinton archives {{are the first to}} include electronic information along with physical documents. The total amount of records is , the most of any presidential archive.

5|$|The elite cavalry {{corps of}} the Persians was the Aswaran. The lance was {{probably}} their preferred weapon, having {{the power to}} skewer two men simultaneously. Their horses were covered in lamellar armor to <b>protect</b> <b>them</b> <b>from</b> enemy archers. Persian archers had a lethal range of about 175 meters and accurate range at about 50–60 meters.|$|E
5|$|The {{final step}} of {{drinking}} water treatment is disinfection to ensure that final drinking water is free from infectious microorganisms. As suspended particles (turbidity) can provide a growth substrate for microorganisms and can <b>protect</b> <b>them</b> <b>from</b> disinfection treatment, it is extremely important that the water treatment process achieves a good level of removal of suspended particles.|$|E

5|$|The {{small size}} and {{independence}} of the laser modules allowed the huge NIF building to be dispensed with. Instead, the modules were arranged in groups surrounding the target chamber in a compact arrangement. In baseline designs, the modules were stacked in 2-wide by 8-high groups in two rings {{above and below the}} target chamber, shining their light through small holes drilled into the chamber to <b>protect</b> <b>them</b> <b>from</b> the neutron flux coming back out.|$|E

5|$|Birds {{are often}} {{important}} to island ecology. Birds have frequently reached islands that mammals have not; on those islands, birds may fulfil ecological roles typically played by larger animals. For example, in New Zealand the moas were important browsers, {{as are the}} kereru and kokako today. Today the plants of New Zealand retain the defensive adaptations evolved to <b>protect</b> <b>them</b> <b>from</b> the extinct moa. Nesting seabirds may also affect the ecology of islands and surrounding seas, principally through the concentration of large quantities of guano, which may enrich the local soil and the surrounding seas.|$|E

Before graduating, she becomes the first Black female streetcar conductor in San Francisco. While still in high school, Maya visits her father in southern California one summer and has some experiences pivotal to her development. She drives a car {{for the first time}} when she must transport her intoxicated father home from an excursion to Mexico. She experiences homelessness for a short time after a fight with her father's girlfriend.|$|E
5|$|Many {{women are}} {{convinced}} that their husbands are putting their lives at risk by engaging in extramarital sexual relations without using protection; however, because of their secondary status, they are often unwilling to initiate discussions about HIV/AIDS in the home. Most women in Malawi do not view divorce as a viable option, even when their husbands are HIV-positive and refuse to <b>protect</b> <b>them</b> <b>from</b> the virus by wearing condoms during marital intercourse. Because they lack the education and training needed to seek gainful employment, women are not usually able to support {{themselves and their children}} outside of marriage without resorting to commercial sex work for money.|$|E
5|$|Muskrats {{are covered}} with short, thick fur, which is medium to dark brown or black in color, with the belly a bit lighter (countershaded); as the age increases, it turns a partly gray in color. The fur has two layers, which helps <b>protect</b> <b>them</b> <b>from</b> the cold water. They have long tails covered with scales rather than hair, and to aid them in swimming, are {{slightly}} flattened vertically, which is a shape that is unique to them. When they walk on land, their tails drag on the ground, which makes their tracks easy to recognize.|$|E
40|$|The {{effect of}} CL 184, 005, a potent and {{specific}} platelet-activating factor antagonist, has been examined {{in a variety}} of animal models relevant to gram-negative bacterial sepsis. Pretreatment of mice with CL 184, 005 <b>protected</b> <b>them</b> <b>from</b> the lethal effects of platelet-activating factor. When rats or primates rendered hypotensive with endotoxin were treated with CL 184, 005, blood pressure was normalized. Pretreatment of rats with CL 184, 005 <b>protected</b> <b>them</b> <b>from</b> the gastrointestinal lesions induced by endotoxin. Pretreatment of rats and mice with CL 184, 005 <b>protected</b> <b>them</b> <b>from</b> the lethal effects of endotoxin. Plasma tumor necrosis factor levels in endotoxin-treated mice were lower when the mice were pretreated with CL 184, 005. These observations suggest that CL 184, 005 may be potentially useful in the treatment of gram-negative bacterial sepsis, and the agent is undergoing clinical evaluation...|$|R
