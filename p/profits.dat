5|$|The Virginia Lottery is an {{independent}} agency of the Commonwealth of Virginia. It was created in 1987 when Virginians {{voted in favor of}} a state lottery. The first ticket was sold on September 20, 1988. All <b>profits</b> from Virginia Lottery ticket sales go to K-12 public education. In Fiscal Year 2017, the Lottery's <b>profits</b> totaled well over a half billion dollars, accounting for approximately 9 percent of school funding in Virginia. That brought total Lottery <b>profits</b> in Virginia (from 1989 to June 2017) to more than $11 billion.|$|E

5|$|Virginia voters {{approved}} a government-run lottery in 1987. Before the vote, supporters of a lottery suggested {{a number of}} possible ways in which lottery <b>profits</b> could be designated in Virginia, such as education, transportation and Chesapeake Bay cleanup. However, the referendum made no designation of how lottery <b>profits</b> would be spent. Sales began September 20, 1988. In 1989, the General Assembly directed Lottery proceeds to capital construction projects. From 1990 to 1998, the proceeds went to Virginia's General Fund. Starting in 1999, a provision in Virginia's budget called for all proceeds to be assigned exclusively to education. In November 2000, Virginia {{voters approved}} the creation of the State Lottery Proceeds Fund by an 83.5-point margin. The measure, which is a permanent part of Virginia's Constitution, directs the General Assembly to use all Lottery <b>profits</b> for educational purposes.

In the absence of this much <b>profit,</b> these parties would withdraw their time and funds from the firm and use them to better advantage elsewhere.

5|$|In most situations, revenue-maximizing {{prices are}} not profit-maximizing prices. For example, if {{variable}} costs per unit are nonzero (which they almost always are), then {{a more complex}} computation of a similar kind yields prices that generate optimal <b>profits.</b>|$|E

Also suppose the new maximum <b>profit</b> is B and new <b>profit</b> corresponding to the old price is A. Thus price M yields A in <b>profit</b> and price N yields B in <b>profit.</b>|$|R

The cases of monopoly with variable coefficient of capital, monopoly with fix coefficient of capital, competition with fix coefficient of capital, are studied.

5000|$|An {{equivalent}} perspective {{relies on}} the relationship that, for each unit sold, marginal <b>profit</b> (Mπ) equals marginal revenue (MR) minus marginal cost (MC). Then, if marginal revenue is greater than marginal cost at some level of output, marginal <b>profit</b> is positive and thus a greater quantity should be produced, and if marginal revenue is less than marginal cost, marginal <b>profit</b> is negative and a lesser quantity should be produced. At the output level at which marginal revenue equals marginal cost, marginal <b>profit</b> is zero and this quantity {{is the one that}} maximizes <b>profit.</b> Since total <b>profit</b> increases when marginal <b>profit</b> is positive and total <b>profit</b> decreases when marginal <b>profit</b> is negative, it must reach a maximum where marginal <b>profit</b> is zero—or where marginal cost equals marginal revenue—and where lower or higher output levels give lower <b>profit</b> levels.
