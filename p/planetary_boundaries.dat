25|$|Transgressing {{one or more}} <b>planetary</b> <b>boundaries</b> may {{be highly}} {{damaging}} or even catastrophic, due {{to the risk of}} crossing thresholds that trigger non-linear, abrupt environmental change within continental- to planetary-scale systems. The 2009 study identified nine <b>planetary</b> <b>boundaries</b> and, drawing on current scientific understanding, the researchers proposed quantifications for seven of them. These seven are climate change (CO2 concentration in the atmosphere < 350 ppm and/or a maximum change of +1 W/m2 in radiative forcing); ocean acidification (mean surface seawater saturation state with respect to aragonite ≥ 80% of pre-industrial levels); stratospheric ozone (less than 5% reduction in total atmospheric O3 from a pre-industrial level of 290 Dobson Units); biogeochemical nitrogen (N) cycle (limit industrial and agricultural fixation of N2 to 35 Tg N/yr) and phosphorus (P) cycle (annual P inflow to oceans not to exceed 10 times the natural background weathering of P); global freshwater use (< 4000nbsp&km3/yr of consumptive use of runoff resources); land system change (< 15% of the ice-free land surface under cropland); and the rate at which biological diversity is lost (annual rate of < 10 extinctions per million species). The two additional <b>planetary</b> <b>boundaries</b> for which the group had not yet been able to determine a boundary level are chemical pollution and atmospheric aerosol loading.|$|E
25|$|Human {{activities}} {{related to}} agriculture and nutrition globally contribute to the transgression of four out of nine <b>planetary</b> <b>boundaries.</b> Surplus nutrient flows (N, P) into aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems are of highest importance, followed by excessive land-system change and biodiversity loss. Whereas {{in the case of}} biodiversity loss, P cycle and land-system change, the transgression is in the zone of uncertainty – indicating an increasing risk (yellow circle in the figure), the N boundary related to agriculture is more than 200% transgressed – indicating a high risk (red marked circle in the figure).|$|E
50|$|The <b>planetary</b> <b>boundary</b> {{layer is}} {{the portion of}} the {{troposphere}} that is influenced by the interaction with {{the surface of the earth}} and will adjust to surface forcings within a timescale of 1 hour. The <b>planetary</b> <b>boundary</b> layer is characterized by turbulence during the daytime and by stability during the night. At the top of the <b>planetary</b> <b>boundary</b> layer, there is a stable layer that is frequently termed the inversion layer as temperature tends to increase with height in contrast to much of the troposphere. The <b>planetary</b> <b>boundary</b> layer can have lower level clouds located around the capping inversion top. The two main types of clouds within the <b>planetary</b> <b>boundary</b> layer are fair-weather cumulus clouds and stratocumulus clouds. The underlying surface primarily determines the type of cloud produced within the <b>planetary</b> <b>boundary</b> layer. The presence of the capping inversion can also trap aerosols within the <b>planetary</b> <b>boundary</b> layer. The increase of anthropogenic aerosols from burning fossil fuels can have significant impacts on precipitation and climate.|$|R
50|$|Remote sensing of the <b>planetary</b> <b>boundary</b> layer {{refers to}} the {{utilization}} of ground based, flight based, or satellite based remote sensing instruments to measure properties of the <b>planetary</b> <b>boundary</b> layer including boundary layer height, aerosols and clouds. Satellite remote sensing of the atmosphere {{has the advantage of}} being able to provide global coverage of atmospheric <b>planetary</b> <b>boundary</b> layer properties while simultaneously providing relatively high temporal sampling rates. Advancements in satellite remote sensing have provided greater vertical resolution which enables higher accuracy for <b>planetary</b> <b>boundary</b> layer measurements.|$|R
5000|$|The <b>planetary</b> <b>boundary</b> {{layer is}} the part of the {{troposphere}} that is closest to Earth's surface and is directly affected by it, mainly through turbulent diffusion. During the day the <b>planetary</b> <b>boundary</b> layer usually is well-mixed, whereas at night it becomes stably stratified with weak or intermittent mixing. The depth of the <b>planetary</b> <b>boundary</b> layer ranges from as little as about 100 m on clear, calm nights to 3000 m or more during the afternoon in dry regions.|$|R
25|$|Aerosol {{particles}} in the atmosphere impact the health of humans and influence monsoon and global atmospheric circulation systems. Some aerosols produce clouds which cool the Earth by reflecting sunlight back to space, while others, like soot, produce thin clouds in the upper stratosphere which behave like a greenhouse, warming the Earth. On balance, anthropogenic aerosols probably produce a net negative radiative forcing (cooling influence). Worldwide each year, aerosol particles result in about 800,000 premature deaths. Aerosol loading is sufficiently important to be included among the <b>planetary</b> <b>boundaries,</b> {{but it is not}} yet clear whether an appropriate safe threshold measure can be identified.|$|E
500|$|At {{the global}} scale, {{scientific}} data now indicates {{that humans are}} living beyond the carrying capacity of planet Earth and that this cannot continue indefinitely. This scientific evidence comes from many sources but is presented in detail in the Millennium Ecosystem Assessment and the <b>planetary</b> <b>boundaries</b> framework. An early detailed examination of global limits {{was published in the}} 1972 book Limits to Growth, which has prompted follow-up commentary and analysis. A 2012 review in Nature by 22 international researchers expressed concerns that the Earth may be [...] "approaching a state shift" [...] in its biosphere.|$|E

40|$|The {{quality of}} MM 5 {{ensembles}} is evaluated for short-range probabilistic quantitative precipitation forecasts over Arizona during the Southwest monsoon. The sensitivity of different ensemble constructs is examined {{with respect to}} analysis uncertainty, model parameterization uncertainty, and a combination of both. Model uncertainty is addressed through different cumulus and <b>planetary</b> <b>boundary</b> layer parameterizations, and through stochastic forcing representative of a component of subgrid-scale uncertainty. A first-order autoregression model adds a stochastic perturbation to the Kain-Fritsch cumulus scheme and MRF <b>planetary</b> <b>boundary</b> layer scheme. A sensitivity study is also conducted to determine the MM 5 <b>planetary</b> <b>boundary</b> layer parameterizations capable of simulating {{the structure of the}} pre-convective, monsoon atmospheric boundary layer. The results indicate that ensemble precipitation forecasts are skillful and may assist operational weather forecasters during the monsoon.

2500|$|The {{hydrologist}} David Molden thinks <b>planetary</b> <b>boundaries</b> are {{a welcome}} new {{approach in the}} 'limits to growth' debate. [...] "As a scientific organizing principle, the concept has many strengths [...] the numbers are important because they provide targets for policymakers, giving {{a clear indication of}} the magnitude and direction of change. They also provide benchmarks and direction for science.

2500|$|<b>Planetary</b> <b>boundaries</b> is {{a concept}} of nine Earth system {{processes}} which have boundaries proposed 2009 {{by a group of}} Earth system and environmental scientists led by Johan Rockström from the Stockholm Resilience Centre and Will Steffen from the Australian National University. The group wanted to define a “safe operating space for humanity” for the international community, including governments at all levels, international organizations, civil society, the scientific community and the private sector, as a precondition for sustainable development. The framework is based on scientific evidence that human actions since the Industrial Revolution have become the main driver of global environmental change. The scientists assert that once human activity has passed certain thresholds or tipping points, defined as [...] "planetary boundaries", there is a risk of [...] "irreversible and abrupt environmental change”. The nine Earth system process boundaries [...] mark the safe zone for the planet {{to the extent that they}} are not crossed. As of 2017,two boundaries have already been crossed, while others are in imminent danger of being crossed.|$|E
2500|$|The United Nations {{secretary}} general Ban Ki-moon endorsed {{the concept of}} <b>planetary</b> <b>boundaries</b> on 16 March 2012, when he presented the key points of the report of his High Level Panel on Global Sustainability to an informal plenary of the UN General Assembly. Ban stated: [...] "The Panel’s vision is to eradicate poverty and reduce inequality, to make growth inclusive and production and consumption more sustainable, while combating climate change and respecting a range of other planetary boundaries." [...] The concept was incorporated into the so-called [...] "zero draft" [...] {{of the outcome of}} the United Nations Conference on Sustainable Development to be convened in Rio de Janeiro 20–22 June 2012. However, the use of the concept was subsequently withdrawn from the text of the conference, [...] "partly due to concerns from some poorer countries that its adoption could lead to the sidelining of poverty reduction and economic development. It is also, say observers, because the idea is simply too new to be officially adopted, and needed to be challenged, weathered and chewed over to test its robustness before standing a chance of being internationally accepted at UN negotiations." ...|$|E
