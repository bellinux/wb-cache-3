5000|$|Polarization {{effects can}} reduce the {{strength}} of received signals. One component is the geometrical alignment of the transmitting and receiving antennas; many antenna produce a preferred plane of polarization. Transmitting and receiving station antennas may not be aligned {{from the perspective of}} an observer on the moon. This component is fixed by the alignment of the antennas and stations may include a facility to rotate antennas to adjust polarization. Another component is Faraday rotation on the Earth-Moon-Earth path; the plane of polarization of radio waves rotates as they pass through ionized layers of the Earth's atmosphere. This effect is more pronounced at lower VHF frequencies and becomes less significant at 1296 MHZ and above. Some of the <b>polarization</b> <b>mismatch</b> loss can be alleviated by using a larger antenna array (more Yagi elements or a larger dish).|$|E
30|$|Therefore, the {{relationship}} between <b>polarization</b> and skills <b>mismatch</b> seems an empirical matter. We analyse {{the relationship}}s between imbalanced job <b>polarization</b> and skills <b>mismatch</b> at two levels in European countries. At the country-level, we estimate a system of two equations, {{one for each of}} the country-level variables gauging imbalanced <b>polarization</b> and <b>mismatch,</b> respectively. The main result is that imbalanced job <b>polarization</b> decreases <b>mismatch</b> between skills demand and skills supply proxied by level of educational attainment, but there is no statistically significant effect from skills mismatch to imbalanced job polarization. Thereafter we consider the individual-level and study the determinants of mismatch by running multi-level mixed effects logistic models. Determinants are divided into two categories: individual-level and macro-level, and imbalanced job polarization is one of the macro-level determinants. The main result is that the effect of imbalanced job <b>polarization</b> on individual-level <b>mismatch</b> was arguably favourable for individuals in non-crisis time (it decreases overeducation risk although it increases the chances of undereducation, both gauged using the normative measure) but unfavourable during the global financial crisis of 2008 – 2009 and the following two years. The effect on overeducation gauged by the statistical measure is the opposite to the effect based on the normative measure, but we demonstrate that these results nevertheless allow for a coherent view on the interaction between job <b>polarization</b> and skills <b>mismatch</b> in Europe.|$|R

5000|$|Polarization {{diversity}} combines {{pairs of}} antennas with orthogonal polarizations (i.e. horizontal/vertical, ± slant 45°, Left-hand/Right-hand circular polarization etc.). Reflected signals can undergo polarization changes {{depending on the}} medium through which they are traveling. A polarization difference of 90° will result in an attenuation factor of up to 34 dB in signal strength. By pairing two complementary polarizations, this scheme can immunize a system from <b>polarization</b> <b>mismatches</b> that would otherwise cause signal fade. Additionally, such diversity has proven valuable at radio and mobile communication base stations since it is less susceptible to the near random orientations of transmitting antennas.|$|R

30|$|This paper {{considers}} {{the education of}} the labour force based on an analysis of trends in and the relationships between job <b>polarization</b> and skills <b>mismatch.</b> Both job <b>polarization</b> and skills <b>mismatch</b> have become topics of increasing interest, but relationships between the two have been relatively neglected in the literature. We argue that the relationship between <b>polarization</b> and skills <b>mismatch</b> is an empirical matter, which we analyse at both the macroeconomic and microeconomic level in European countries. A novel job polarization index (JPI) is proposed to measure imbalanced job polarization. It takes into account not only the change in the share of medium-level jobs, as is typical for measuring pure polarization, but also the imbalance between the change in high-level and low-level jobs. Skills mismatch at macro-level is measured by a skills mismatch index (SMI), while traditional measures of undereducation and overeducation are used at the microeconomic level. At the macroeconomic level, we estimate a system of two equations, one for each of the country-level variables gauging <b>polarization</b> and <b>mismatch,</b> respectively. Imbalanced job polarization measured by the JPI negatively affects skills mismatch at the macroeconomic level (SMI), but there is no significant reverse effect. Thereafter we consider the microeconomic level and study the determinants of mismatch using multi-level mixed effects logistic models. The effect of imbalanced job <b>polarization</b> on individual-level <b>mismatch</b> was arguably favourable for individuals in non-crisis time, decreasing overeducation risk although also increasing the chances of undereducation, both gauged using the normative measure, but unfavourable during the global financial crisis of 2008 – 2009 and the following two years.|$|R

40|$|International audienceWe {{present a}} polarization- {{reconfigurable}} multi-slot antenna with four switchable linear polarizations (as 0 ⁰, ± 45 ⁰ and 90 ⁰) for implant communications. The design {{is based on}} four bow-tie shaped slots acting as radiators etched on a circular metallization plane with 45 ⁰ rotated sequential arrangements. RF switches based on PIN diodes are connected across each slot in order to modify the radiators polarization. We apply a differential source to feed the slot antenna through a ground-tapered Balun. In order to obtain a broadside radiation pattern, a reflector is placed at the quarter-wave distance below the radiator. Measured results are showing that the realized multi-slot antenna can generate four switchable linear polarization states with wide bandwidth and stable gain.

40|$|Abstruct- The {{effect of}} fiber {{polarization}} mode dispersion (PMD) on a {{coherent optical system}} with pilot carrier is twofold. First, the PMD causes state of <b>polarization</b> (SOP) <b>mismatch</b> between the message signal and pilot carrier. Second, the degrees of polarization (DOP) of the message signal and pilot carrier are degraded by PMD. Because coherrnt reception relies both on the SOP’S and DOP’s of the waves, system performance is degraded by PMD. The effect of SOP mismatch causes interme-diate frequency (IF) signal amplitude degradation whereas DOP variation not only results in IF signal amplitude degradation but further induces IF noises. Here we derive analytical expressions to evaluate the performance degradation. It is shown {{that there is no}} performance degradation if only one principle state of polarization is excited and maximum degradation occurs when both principle states of polarization are equally excited.

40|$|We address {{theoretically}} {{differences and}} similarities on the electronic structure of CdSe/CdS dot-in-dot nanocrystals (NCs) with wurtzite/wurtzite (WZ/WZ), zinc-blende/zinc-blende (ZB/ZB) and polytype ZB/WZ crystalline phases, {{as they are}} currently being synthesized and used in optoelectronic devices. We show that the electronic structure of polytypic CdSe/CdS NCs closely resembles that of WZ or ZB NCs with regard to quantum confinement and strain, resulting in similar single-exciton wave functions. The main differences arise in the nature and magnitude of built-in electric fields. We predict that these fields are stronger in polytypes than in pure WZ or ZB NCs due to the sharp spontaneous <b>polarization</b> <b>mismatch</b> between the cubic core and the hexagonal shell lattices. Polarization in NCs is currently believed to be screened by several surface effects. In polytypical structures, however, the <b>polarization</b> <b>mismatch</b> at the interface may create effective charges that are sufficiently far from the outer surface to be quenched. To make a definitive assessment on this controversial issue, we propose experiments in polytypic ZB/WZ NCs where both core and shell are made of CdSe. In such a case, band offsets are small, strain is absent, and our calculations predict pyroelectricity should become the driving force, inducing transitions from type-I to type-II excitons with increasing core or shell size.

30|$|Overall, {{this paper}} {{stresses}} {{the merits of}} the job requirement approach. With respect to the study of skill demand in general, research on mismatching greatly benefits from subjective measures on the skill content of jobs. Based on the results of job tasks, it would be worthwhile to study the link between <b>polarization</b> and <b>mismatching</b> using over time data. The Employment Survey is a repeated cross-sectional survey that allows for replicating some of the analyses presented above for data collections from 1979, 1985 / 86, 1991 / 92, 1998 / 99 and 2012 (Rohrbach-Schmidt and Tiemann 2011). Ideally, however, to test for the occupational mobility hypothesis and to separate cohort from age effects, our analyses should be validated with panel data. A further extension would be to distinguish between subjects studied, testing whether overeducated workers are equally as able as matched workers, though they have degrees in subjects that are in less demand in the labor market (e.g., Green and McIntosh 2007). The analyses could be further extended by including specific occupation-level variables, e.g., indicating the occupation’s current labor market situation (unemployment rates, regional distribution).|$|R
