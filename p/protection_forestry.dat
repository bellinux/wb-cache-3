40|$|This paper {{examines}} two {{drastic changes}} {{in the performance of}} local water associations in providing local public goods - appropriate levels of water table - in the reclamation system in the Powiat Pyrzyce in the Voivodship Zachodniopomorski in northwest Poland. Employing an institutional economics approach shows the results of processes of revalorisation of the interrelated property objects land and reclamation infrastructure that have been triggered and shaped not only by the drastic political, economic and administrative changes after the breakdown of the socialist regime in Poland in 1990, but also by the prospect of joining the European Union and the proactive leadership of the director of the Powiat Department of Environmental <b>Protection,</b> <b>Forestry</b> and Agriculture. More precisely, both processes - the discontinuation (from 1990 onwards) and revival (from 2002 onwards) of the local water associations - were mainly determined by changing market conditions together with variances in the ability of state authorities to effectively control and facilitate these associations. Further, the delay in overcoming the period of collective inaction was fostered by the time-delayed and cumulative effects of neglecting the cleaning and the maintenance of secondary ditches.

40|$|Access to {{reliable}} information {{is often a}} limiting factor in agriculture. Achieving sustainable food production requires many decisions: choice of appropriate plants or animals, management techniques, diagnosis of problems and selection of solutions. Information technology enables storage and retrieval of vast quantities of data; it also offers tools to aid decision making and sharing of knowledge. Since the mid- 1990 s, {{with the support of}} an international consortium, CAB International has developed Compendia: mixed media encyclopaedic knowledge bases on CD-ROM and the Internet. So far, Compendia have been developed for crop <b>protection,</b> <b>forestry,</b> and animal health and production. An Aquaculture Compendium is currently under development (see www. cabicompendium. org). Compendia are being used worldwide to apply knowledge to solve problems. The Compendia are user-friendly and extremely extensive reference databases, with built-in diagnostic tools and expert systems. They contain global coverage of crops, trees, farm animals (relevant to each Compendium), their production and the diseases and pests that affect them. Each Compendium contains data, detailed text, images, maps, statistics, and references. Hundreds of experts from around the world contribute to the content, which is then peer-reviewed, and edited and compiled by CABI as an independent scientific organization. A notepad facility enables users to store their personal notes, or share them with colleagues. The Compendia have been designed to enable content to be copied, to aid the compilation of teaching and training materials. Here, we will demonstrate the Compendia content and technology; specific case studies will illustrate how they are facilitating knowledge sharing in support of sustainable food production...|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{investigate}} ways in which coastal <b>protection</b> <b>forestry</b> measures can be employed, taking into account beaches and people's lifestyles. Up until now, there has been little focus on this issue with regard to folk customs. Three locations, Karimata Village in Miyako Island, Ogami Island, and Tonaki Island were used as a case study for this paper. The following is a discussion on the problems and current state of administrative policies in breakwater works and the relationship of the region's inhabitants to the beaches in regard to religious ceremonies of the region. Coastal environments in Okinawa are deeply ingrained in the cultural life, in particular religious ceremonies, of the region's residents. The disaster prevention projects that have been carried out in coastal areas in Okinawa to date have been done so without consideration to the nature and culture of the region. Instead, they have been undertaken with a view to functionality alone. Results of surveys on the relationship between the natural coastal vegetation and the stepped / low-lying upright hollow tide embankments show that the number of plant varieties tends to decrease with the transition from a natural beach environment to these man-made structures. While the number of plant varieties is greater with the low-lying upright hollow embankments, they cut off the beach from the inland areas and thus vegetation continuity is lost. On the other hand, the steps on the stepped tide embankments support vines and creepers that grow out towards the inland areas. The preservation and restoration of the nature and historic culture of these beach environments is a substantial problem confronting disaster protection projects in the coastal regions of Okinawa...|$|E
40|$|Assessment of slope {{instability}} on forest lands in South Westland {{was limited to}} the resource allocation level of evaluating slope movements on forest lands with the prime objective of providing an overview of slope movement potential adequate for forestry development planning. Three sites were selected for detailed investigation on the three most unstable landform units which were identified by previous studies, viz:- 1. Greenland Group Hill Country: Boulder Creek; 2. Alpine Fault Zone slopes: Havelock Creek, and; 3. Cretaceous-Tertiary Hill Country: Grave Creek. Investigations were divided into three stages, engineering geology field and laboratory studies, assessment of slope movement processes and instability controls, and implications of {{slope instability}} for forest management. The dominant type of slope failure at Boulder Creek is debris slump/slide-avalanche in crushed hornfelsed sandstone and puggy tectonic breccia bedrock materials with failures typically initiated during high intensity rainstorm events and seismic events. The Boulder creek catchment is presently undergoing a period of increased slope activity which is generating a substantial quantity of sediment and is overloading the stream channel with rock debris. Boulder Creek provides an exceptional example of slope instability problems in Greenland Group Hill Country, this being explained by the oversteepened sides of the glaciated Moeraki River valley in fault-crushed bedrock. Alpine Fault Zone slopes fail most commonly by debris slide-avalanche in crushed mylonite schist and crushed garnet schist bedrock triggered by high intensity rainstorm events. Investigations at Havelock Creek also identified large-scale rock (block) slide failures in the same crushed bedrock materials which are initiated by infrequent seismic events. The Grave Earthflow, located in Cretaceous-Tertiary Hill Country, was triggered by construction of State Highway 6 in 1963 - 65. Failure is taking place by a complex rotational slide-earthflow type of movement along a zone of basal shear in grey mud material derived from faulting in lower Otumotu Formation bedrock. Surface movement monitoring investigations measured a high rate of movement of up to 419 cm/year. Unloading of toe support in December 1984 caused an instantaneous acceleration in movement rates which subsequently declined during the monitoring period of March 1985 to June 1986. This deceleration process obscured any climatic influences on movement. Slope failure potential in South Westland slopes is governed by the fundamental causes of slope instability: the distribution of weak fault zone materials and crushed bedrock, and the steep topography (20 - 65 °). Aerial photograph evidence suggests that slope instability features develop very rapidly (within one rainstorm event) and active instability periods occur in short-lived episodes (less than 50 years) which are coincident with the occurrence of heavy precipitation periods. Recommendations for future management of South Westland forest lands are:- 1. Alpine Fault Zone slopes should be limited to <b>protection</b> <b>forestry</b> management practices. 2. Greenland Group Hill Country and Cretaceous-Tertiary Hill Country should be assessed by more detailed phases of evaluation for small-scale bush-mill harvesting methods only. 3. Engineering geology methods of investigation and data presentation have been demonstrated to make a valuable contribution to forest resource allocation studies and it is recommended that these methods be applied to all levels of evaluation of slope movement potential on forest lands...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. During {{the last}} decade, {{we have seen}} the emergence, under the auspices of non-state authorities, of market-driven {{governance}} schemes for certification of forest holdings and eco-labelling of wood products.

It is found that certification processes in both countries have resulted in high participation in certification schemes, high market penetration by certified forest or-ganisations, and reduced conflict prevalence over forestry practices. Although forest certifi-cation seems to have modified on-the-ground practices in ways that lead to less environmental deterioration of forests, we still know too little about forest certification’s environmental impact and efficacy as a problem-solving instrument. More research is therefore urged in these areas...|$|R
