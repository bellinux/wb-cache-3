40|$|In {{the use of}} {{the fuzzy}} {{calculus}} for design, the issue arises over how to resolve what value of a <b>performance</b> <b>parameter</b> should be used, given the desires specified for the design parameters and the set of functional requirements. It is shown that the method to use to solve this problem is to use, in the most general case, any member of a range of functions which evaluate between the min function and the clipped max function. 1 Introduction In {{the use of the}} fuzzy calculus in design, design parameters are combined using <b>performance</b> <b>parameter</b> expressions (PPE's), to form desired <b>performance</b> <b>parameter</b> (PP) values. But for each <b>performance</b> <b>parameter,</b> there is a set of functional requirements (FR's), for the PP to be within, which is also specified with a fuzzy membership function. A typical example is shown in Figure 1. Given the DP induced curve and the FR curve, how does one select which PP value to use?

500|$|The {{need for}} frequency-independent delay in {{satellite}} applications {{led to more}} research into the waveguide incarnation of cross-coupled filters. [...] Previously, satellite communications systems used a separate component for delay equalisation. [...] The additional degrees of freedom obtained from cross-coupled filters held {{out the possibility of}} designing a flat delay into a filter without compromising other <b>performance</b> <b>parameters.</b> [...] A component that simultaneously functioned as both filter and equaliser would save valuable weight and space. [...] The needs of satellite communication also drove research into the more exotic resonator modes in the 1970s. [...] Of particular prominence in this respect is the work of E. L. Griffin and F. A. Young, who investigated better modes for the [...] band when this began to be used for satellites in the mid-1970s.|$|E
500|$|Ski poles {{are used}} for balance and propulsion. Modern {{cross-country}} ski poles are made from aluminium, fibreglass-reinforced plastic, or carbon fibre, depending on weight, cost and <b>performance</b> <b>parameters.</b> Formerly {{they were made of}} wood or bamboo. [...] They feature a foot (called a basket) {{near the end of the}} shaft that provides a pushing platform, as it makes contact with the snow. Baskets vary in size, according to the expected softness/firmness of the snow. Racing poles feature smaller, lighter baskets than recreational poles. Poles designed for skating are longer than those designed for classic skiing. Traditional skiing in the 1800s used a single pole for both cross-country and downhill. The single pole was longer and stronger than the poles that are used in pairs. In competitive cross-country poles in pairs were introduced around 1900.|$|E

500|$|Filter <b>performance</b> <b>parameters,</b> such as {{stopband}} {{rejection and}} rate of transition between passband and stopband, are improved by adding more components and thus increasing {{the length of the}} filter. [...] Where the components are repeated identically, the filter is an image parameter filter design, and performance is enhanced simply by adding more identical elements. [...] This approach is typically used in filter designs which use a large number of closely spaced elements such as the waffle-iron filter. [...] For designs where the elements are more widely spaced, better results can be obtained using a network synthesis filter design, such as the common Chebyshev filter and Butterworth filters. [...] In this approach the circuit elements do not all have the same value, and consequently the components are not all the same dimensions. [...] Furthermore, if the design is enhanced by adding more components then all the element values must be calculated again from scratch. [...] In general, there will be no common values between the two instances of the design. [...] Chebyshev waveguide filters are used where the filtering requirements are rigorous, such as satellite applications.|$|E

2500|$|During {{testing of}} the caliber in 1988, {{it was decided that}} the full-power {{commercial}} load of the 10mm Auto was the best available semi-automatic pistol cartridge for law enforcement usage, but it produced excessive recoil for most agents. Thereafter, experiments were carried out, and a specification for reduced-recoil ammunition was created. The requirement was later submitted to the Federal Cartridge Corporation for production and followed further review. This became known as the [...] "10mm Lite", or [...] "10mm FBI" [...] load, remaining common from various manufacturers today. With some pistol reliability problems increasing in this lighter load, Smith & Wesson observed that a version of the 10mm case reduced to 22 millimeters in length from the original 25mm could be made with the retained <b>performance</b> <b>parameters</b> of the [...] "10mm Lite". This altered cartridge was named the [...]40 Smith & Wesson. The shorter case allowed use in pistols designed with similar dimensions to those chambered in 9mm Luger, with the advantage that smaller-handed shooters could now have smaller-frame semi-automatic handguns with near—or in some cases, exact—10mm performance. Colloquially called the [...] "Forty Cal" [...] and other synonyms, this innovation since became a common handgun cartridge among law enforcement agencies and civilians in the United States, while the parent 10mm Auto remains fairly popular. Colt, Dan Wesson Firearms, Glock, Kimber Manufacturing, Nighthawk Custom, Smith & Wesson, STI International, Armscor, and Tanfoglio still offer handguns in 10mm Auto. In 2015 SIG Sauer entered the 10mm marketplace with their P220 model chambered in 10mm. [...] Ruger introduced a 10mm auto model to their popular SR1911 line in mid 2017.|$|E
