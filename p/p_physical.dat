5000|$|Homuncular {{functionalism}} {{was developed}} largely by Daniel Dennett {{and has been}} advocated by William Lycan. It arose {{in response to the}} challenges that Ned Block's China Brain (a.k.a. Chinese nation) and John Searle's Chinese room thought experiments presented for the more traditional forms of functionalism (see below under [...] "Criticism"). In attempting to overcome the conceptual difficulties that arose from the idea of a nation full of Chinese people wired together, each person working as a single neuron to produce in the wired-together whole the functional mental states of an individual mind, many functionalists simply bit the bullet, so to speak, and argued that such a Chinese nation would indeed possess all of the qualitative and intentional properties of a mind; i.e. it would become a sort of systemic or collective mind with propositional attitudes and other mental characteristics. Whatever the worth of this latter hypothesis, it was immediately objected that it entailed an unacceptable sort of mind-mind supervenience: the systemic mind which somehow emerged at the higher-level must necessarily supervene on the individual minds of each individual member of the Chinese nation, to stick to Block's formulation. But this would seem to put into serious doubt, if not directly contradict, the fundamental idea of the supervenience thesis: there can be no change in the mental realm without some change in the underlying physical substratum. This can be easily seen if we label the set of mental facts that occur at the higher-level M1 and the set of mental facts that occur at the lower-level M2. Given the transitivity of supervenience, if M1 supervenes on M2, and M2 supervenes on <b>P</b> (<b>physical</b> base), then M1 and M2 both supervene on P, even though they are (allegedly) totally different sets of mental facts.|$|E

In the study of such systems, large-scale simulation research {{has been identified as}} a necessary resource to realistically evaluate cooperative vehicular systems and traffic management policies in city-sized scenarios. In this context, this paper presents the iTETRIS multi-technology wireless simulation platform aimed at providing an optimally, efficiently and well-designed framework for the evaluation of vehicular communications and its potential impact on traffic efficiency.

The IEEE 802. 11 p pilot pattern is identical {{to that in the}} well-known IEEE 802. 11 a/g (WiFi) standard, which was initially designed for indoor environments with little or no mobility. However, in a V 2 V drive-by situation, the channel im-pulse response rapidly changes due to the high relative veloc-ity between transmitter and receiver, as well as the changes in the scattering environment. Hence, for such V 2 V channels, ad-vanced decision directed channel estimation methods are needed to reach a frame error rate (FER) smaller than 10 − 1. Even more importantly, the channels are nonstationary, which implies that the Doppler power spectral density (DSD) and the power delay profile (PDP) change on a timescale comparable with the fram...|$|E

The repetition code proposed in wireless access for vehicular environment (WAVE) standard is inefficient in realistic channel conditions and rapidly changing network topologies. In this study, we propose the use of systematic raptor codes as a forward error correction (FEC) scheme at the MAC layer. This code is optimised for short packet lengths, as are expected in safety applications. We have developed a multi-layered simulator that consists of realistic IEEE 802.11 <b>p</b> <b>physical</b> layer results, an analytical random access MAC model and FEC codes implemented at different OSI layers. The model considers safety messages under non-saturated channel conditions according to the vehicular IEEE 802.11 p standard.

The performance evaluation of raptor codes against repetition codes in the shared control channel with different antenna schemes is also presented.|$|E

What are {{the differences in the}} supports needed by caregivers of individuals with ESLD at end of life versus other life-limiting diagnoses? Methods The South Australian Health Omnibus is an annual, random, face-to-face, cross-sectional survey. In 2002, 2003 and 2005 - 2007, respondents were asked a range of questions about end-of-life care; there were approximately 3000 survey participants annually (participation rate 77. 9 %). Responses were standardised for the whole population. The families and friends who cared for someone with ESLD were the focus of this analysis. In addition to describing caring, respondents reported additional support that would have been helpful. Results Of 1504 deaths reported, 145 (9. 6 %) were due to ESLD. The ESLD cohort were older than those with other 'expected' causes of death (> 65 years of age; 92. 6 % versus 70. 6 %; <b>p</b> <b>physical</b> care, information provision, and emotional and spiritual support.

In this setting, however, gauging system performance through field trials can be very expensive especially {{when the number of}} studied vehicles is high. Therefore, many existing studies have been conducted using either network or physical layer simulators; both approaches are problematic. Network simulators typically abstract physical layer details (coding, modulation, radio channels, receiver algorithms, etc.) while physical layer ones do not consider overall network characteristics (topology, network traffic types, and so on). In particular, network simulators view a transmitted frame as an indivisible unit, which leads to several limitations. First, the impact of the vehicular radio channel is typically not reflected in its appropriate context. Further, interference due to frame collisions is not modeled accurately (if at all) and, finally, the benefits of advanced signal processing techniques, such as interference cancellation, are difficult to assess. To overcome these shortcomings we have integrated a detailed physical layer simulator into the popular NS- 3 network simulator. This approach aims {{to bridge the gap between}} the physical and network layer perspectives, allow for more accurate channel and physical layer models, and enable studies on cross-layer optimization.

Physical immobilization was accomplished by ion exchange reaction between the 3 -(2 -pyridyl) - 5, 6 -bis(4 -phenylsulfonic acid) - 1, 2 - 4 -triazine anion (PDTS) and a strongly basic, quarternary ammonium (polystyrene) type anion-exchange resin. The immobilized PDTS was found to be useful for collection and preconcentration of trace metal ions from dilute aqueous solutions. The metal ions could be quantitatively recovered from the PDTS-resin by treatment with hot 1 M hydrochloric acid. Applications of physically immobilized PDTS in metal ion chromatography proved impractical, because the metal ions could not be eluted without concomitant desorption of immobilized ligands by the eluting reagents. Picolinaldehyde phenylhydrazone (PAPH) was immobilized on silica by covalent bonding and found to be effective as a stationary phase for metal ion chromatography. This ferroin-type reagent was synthesized by modification of a silane compound which was chemically immobilized on the surface of controlled pore glass. The chemically bonded PAPH proved to be relatively stable in contact with acidic medium and exhibited good retention for iron(II), cobalt(II), nickel(II), copper(I), and copper(II) ions. Sorption isotherms were determined and found to be of the Langmuir type. The Langmuir parameters, K and b, were determined for each metal ion and interpreted in terms of their coordination tendencies and with respect to the number of chelate ligands bonded to the silica substrate.
