A stu-dy {{to evaluate the}} effect of <b>procodazole</b> on the antibody-mediated response {{was carried out in}} puppies infected with Toxocara canis embryonated eggs. The antibody response (antibody activity in association with IgG and with the IgG 1 and IgG 2 isotypes) against T. canis was established by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and cru-de antigen. One group of dogs was previously treated with <b>procodazole</b> (G-E), prior to and after the infection. Another infected group remained without treatment (G-I), and one group of non-treated and non-infected animals was left as control (G-C). Animals of G-E and G-I remained infected throughout 14 weeks, when all infected animals received piperazine. <b>Procodazole</b> reduced significantly the number of worms recovered in G-E and delayed spontaneous worm elimination. Total IgG response was higher in G-E than that of G-I, whereas IgG 1 and IgG 2 levels were lower than that of G-I. A dichotomous IgG 1 /IgG 2 response was obser-ved in the two infected groups: first, secretion of IgG 2 was stimulated, but when infection progressed this response decreased and IgG 1 levels increased...|$|E
