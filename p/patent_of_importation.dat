5000|$|The origins <b>of</b> the 1790 <b>Patent</b> Act can {{be found}} in House Resolution 41, which brought about a {{discussion}} concerning the constitutionality <b>of</b> authorizing <b>patents</b> <b>of</b> <b>importation.</b> House Resolution 41 is the reason for why the <b>Patent</b> Act <b>of</b> 1790 did not provide for <b>patents</b> <b>of</b> <b>importation</b> when it was finally passed. Patent Board members, who also called themselves the “Commissioners for the Promotion of Useful Arts”, were given the authority to grant or refuse a patent after deciding if the invention or discovery was “sufficiently useful and important.” [...] The first board members included Thomas Jefferson, Henry Knox, and Edmund Randolph. Obtaining a patent required an overall fee of about four to five dollars：filing the application cost fifty cents plus ten cents per hundred words of specification: two dollars for producing the actual patent, one dollar for affixing the Great Seal and twenty cents for endorsement and all other services. The duration <b>of</b> each <b>patent</b> was assigned by the Patent Board, and could be of any length as long as it did not exceed fourteen years.|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe {{importation}} {{market has}} been turned into an attractive market for merchants with ever-growing increase in number <b>of</b> <b>importation</b> companies and rising volume of imports during recent years. The basic and fundamental changes are required for their structure in importation companies due to the wide range of various types of imported commodities and effect of their performance on economic variables. The improvement in variables of marketing potentials to enhance performance and competitive advantage <b>of</b> <b>importation</b> companies with impact of moderating role of risk management are necessarily assumed as the reasons for selection of the subject of this study. The present research is of applied type in terms of goal and a descriptive-survey in terms of method of data collection.

40|$|Background: Given the {{interconnectivity}} of Brazil {{with the}} rest of the world, Zika virus (ZIKV) infections have the potential to spread rapidly around the world via viremic travellers. The extent of spread depends on the travel volume and the endemicity in the exporting country. In the absence of reliable surveillance data, we did mathematical modelling to estimate the number <b>of</b> <b>importations</b> <b>of</b> ZIKV from Brazil into Europe. Design: We applied a previously developed mathematical model on <b>importations</b> <b>of</b> dengue to estimate the number <b>of</b> ZIKV <b>importations</b> into Europe, based on the travel volume, the probability of being infected at the time of travel, the population size of Brazil, and the estimated incidence of ZIKV infections. Results: Our model estimated between 508 and 1, 778 imported infections into Europe in 2016, of which we would expect between 116 and 355 symptomatic Zika infections; with the highest number <b>of</b> <b>importations</b> being into France, Portugal and Italy. Conclusions: Our model identified high-risk countries in Europe. Such data can assist policymakers and public health professionals in estimating the extent <b>of</b> <b>importations</b> in order to prepare for the scale up of laboratory diagnostic assays and estimate the occurrence of Guillain–Barré Syndrome, potential sexual transmission, and infants with congenital ZIKV syndrome...|$|R

Although measles was declared eliminated from the United States in 2000, measles cases and outbreaks continue to occur each year as a result <b>of</b> <b>importations</b> <b>of</b> the disease from countries in which it remains endemic. We describe the epidemiology <b>of</b> <b>importations</b> <b>of</b> measles virus into the US during the post-elimination 0 era. MethodsMeasles is nationally notifiable in the USA and local and state health departments report confirmed measles cases to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). A 0 case is considered internationally imported if {{at least some of the}} exposure period (7 - 210 days before rash onset) occurred outside of the USA, rash onset occurred within 210 days of entering the USA, and there was no known exposure to measles in the US during that time.

40|$|All {{mitochondrial}} tRNAs in kinetoplastid protozoa are {{encoded in}} the nucleus and {{imported from the}} cytosol. Incubation of two in vitro-transcribed tRNAs, tRNA(Ile) (UAU) and tRNA(Gln) (CUG), with isolated mitochondria from Leishmania tarentolae, {{in the absence of}} any added cytosolic fraction, resulted in a protease-sensitive, ATP-dependent importation, as measured by nuclease protection. Evidence that nuclease protection represents importation was obtained by the finding that Bacillus subtilis pre-tRNA(Asp) was protected from nuclease digestion and was also cleaved by an intramitochondrial RNase P-like activity to produce the mature tRNA. The presence of a membrane potential is not required for in vitro <b>importation.</b> A variety <b>of</b> small synthetic RNAs were also found to be efficiently imported in vitro. The data suggest that there is a structural requirement for <b>importation</b> <b>of</b> RNAs greater than approximately 17 nt, and that smaller RNAs are apparently nonspecifically imported. The signals for <b>importation</b> <b>of</b> folded RNAs have not been determined, but the specificity of the process was illustrated by the higher saturation level <b>of</b> <b>importation</b> <b>of</b> the mainly mitochondria-localized tRNA(Ile) as compared to the level <b>of</b> <b>importation</b> <b>of</b> the mainly cytosol-localized tRNA(Gln). Furthermore, exchanging the D-arm between the tRNA(Ile) and the tRNA(Gln) resulted in a reversal of the in vitro importation behavior and this could also be interpreted in terms of tertiary structure specificity...|$|R
