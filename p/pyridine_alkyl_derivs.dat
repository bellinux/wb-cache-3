Emphasis was placed on (NS) -chelate and (NN) -chelate platinum complexes. Bidentate (NS) -donor ligands were used as non-leaving ligands in the synthesis of platinum(II) complexes with iodo, chloro, bromo and oxalato groups as leaving groups. These complexes were synthesized and studied since many questions regarding the interaction of sulfur-donors and platinum still exist. These relate to thermodynamic and kinetic factors and their influence on anticancer action. In this dissertation the properties of novel platinum(II) complexes of a bidentate ligand having an aromatic nitrogen-donor atom in combination with a thioethereal sulfur atom capable of forming a five-membered ring with platinum(II) were studied.

"The {{research}} {{presented in}} this dissertation deals with the syntheses, characterization, electrochemical and photophysical studies of porphyrin-fullerene or porphyrin-carbon nanotube based donor-acceptor conjugates. The first chapter provides {{an introduction to the}} research {{presented in this}} thesis. A summary of primary events that occur in natural photosynthetic systems, the necessity and importance of the artificial photosynthetic mimics for light energy harvesting, the importance of non-covalent porphyrin-fullerene donor-acceptor models over covalent ones and some recent developments in model biomimetic systems are presented. Additionally, the importance of the nano-sized materials, solubilization of carbon nanotubes via chemical functionalization and utilization of these nanomaterials in building donor-acceptor nanohybrids is discussed. The second chapter discusses the syntheses and characterization of the control compounds and physical methods employed to monitor the photochemical pathways occurring in the studied donor-acceptor conjugates. The third chapter focuses on the design and syntheses of rigid, noncovalent “two-point” bound porphyrin-fullerene dyads assembled via crown etherammonium cation complexation and axial coordination or ∏-∏ interactions. The effect of axial ligation or ∏-∏ interactions in addition to the crown etherammonium cation binding, on photochemical charge stabilization in these supramolecuar dyads is systematically investigated. The fourth chapter deals with the photoinduced electron-transfer processes occurring in supramolecular triads comprised of cis and trans functionalized bis- 18 -crown- 6 porphyrin self assembled with fullerene functionalized with <b>pyridine</b> or <b>alkyl</b> ammonium cation entities. The 1 : 2 stoichiometric supramolecular porphyrin:fullerene conjugates are obtained by utilizing either “two-point” binding methodology involving metalligand coordination and alkyl ammonium cation-crown ether binding or the latter type of binding solely. Variation of metal ion in the porphyrin (zinc or magnesium) cavity results in the free energy changes of charge separation and charge recombination. Employing higher number of the acceptor entities improves the electron-transfer rates, with kCS being 2 - 3 orders of magnitude higher than the kCR, thus indicating charge stabilization in these conjugates. The fifth chapter discusses the role of a secondary electron donor in generating longlived charge separated states in supramolecular conjugates formed via crown ether-ammonium cation binding. The sixth chapter presents the application of the present type of conjugates. Here, potassium ion-induced switching of intrato intermolecular electron transfer in crown ether appended porphyrin-fullerene donor acceptor conjugates is demonstrated. Investigations in the seventh chapter involve solubilization of single wall carbon nanotubes by ∏-stacking with pyrene functionalized imidazole or phenyl moieties and subsequent utilization of these nanotubes to build supramolecular donor-acceptor nanohybrids with donors such as porphyrin or napthalocyanine The compounds described in this dissertation were synthesized and characterized by proton NMR and ESI-Mass spectroscopy.

40|$|A {{recently}} developed atmospheric pressure interface mass spectrometer (APi-TOF) measured the {{negative and positive}} ambient ion composition at a boreal forest site. As observed in previous studies, the negative ions were dominated by strong organic and inorganic acids (e. g. malonic, nitric and sulfuric acid), whereas the positive ions consisted of strong bases (e. g. <b>alkyl</b> <b>pyridines</b> and quinolines). Several new ions and clusters of ions were identified based on their exact masses, {{made possible by the}} high resolution, mass accuracy and sensitivity of the APi-TOF. Time series correlograms aided in peak identification and assigning the atomic compositions to molecules. Quantum chemical calculations of proton affinities and cluster stabilities were also used to confirm the plausibility of the assignments. Acids in the gas phase are predominantly formed by oxidation in the gas phase, and thus the concentrations are expected to vary strongly between day and night. This was also the case in this study, where the negative ions showed strong diurnal behavior, whereas the daily changes in the positive ions were considerably smaller. A special focus in this work was the changes in the ion distributions occurring during new particle formation events. We found that sulfuric acid, together with its clusters, dominated the negative ion spectrum during these events. The monomer (HSO 4 −) was the largest peak, together with the dimer (H 2 SO 4 · HSO 4 −) and trimer ((H 2 SO 4) 2 · HSO 4 −). SO 5 − also tracked HSO 4 − at around 20 % of the HSO 4 − concentration at all times. During the strongest events, the tetramer and a cluster with the tetramer and ammonia were also detected. Quantum chemical calculations predict that sulfuric acid clusters containing ammonia are much more stable when neutral, thus the detection of a single ion cluster implies that ammonia can be an important compound in the nucleation process. We also believe to have made the first observations of an organosulfate (glycolic acid sulfate) in the gas phase. This ion, and its cluster with sulfuric acid, correlates with the HSO 4 −, but peaks in the early afternoon, some hours later than HSO 4 − itself.

40|$|Drawing {{inspiration}} from nature where enzymes containing multi-metallic active sites are ubiquitous, chemists have designed various ligands to bind {{more than one}} metal in precise structural arrangements. In Chapter One, a class of binucleating Schiff base pyrrole (Pacman) macrocycles which are both straightforward to synthesise and can be varied systematically to alter the metal environment and intermetallic separation are introduced, along with the state-of-the-art in this area. Previously reported complexes of these ligands with late transition metals, lanthanides and actinides are also reviewed. The results and discussion chapters of the thesis focus on the isolation and investigation of previously unexplored early transition-metal Pacman complexes and present new advances in low oxidation state uranium Pacman chemistry. In Chapter Two, binuclear chromium(II) complexes of two Schiff base macrocycles, H 4 LMe and H 4 LA are described. [Cr 2 (LMe) ] features an ortho-phenyl spacer between the macrocycle donor compartments whereas the Cr(II) ions are separated by a larger anthracenyl spacer in [Cr 2 (LA) ]. Both compounds have been characterised in solution and the solid state. Reactivity {{studies were carried out}} for [Cr 2 (LMe) ]. Reactions of [Cr 2 (LMe) ] with isocyanides and triphenylphosphine oxide were investigated leading to the isolation of the contrasting co-ordination compounds [Cr 2 (OPPh 3) 2 (LMe) ] and [Cr 2 (μ-CNR) (LMe) ] (R = xylyl, tBu). Oxidation of [Cr 2 (LMe) ] with I 2 yields the Cr(III) /Cr(III) Pacman products [Cr 2 (μ- I) (I) (THF) (LMe) ] and [Cr 2 (μ-I) (py) 2 (LMe) ][I] when carried out in THF or <b>pyridine,</b> respectively. Cr(III) <b>alkyl</b> compounds are obtained by reaction of [Cr 2 (μ-I) (I) (THF) (LMe) ] with the non-reducing alkyl transfer reagents MgBrEt and ZnEt 2. When ZnEt 2 in toluene is employed, one zinc cation is incorporated in the molecular cleft, whereas use of MgBrEt in THF yields the simple chromium alkyl complex [Cr(Et) 2 (endo-THF) (LMe) ]. One ethyl group may be abstracted from [Cr(Et) 2 (endo-THF) (LMe) ] by [CPh 3][B(C 6 F 5) 4] to form a cationic alkyl complex. The activity of both the neutral and cationic alkyl species towards ethylene was investigated. Conclusions are discussed {{at the end of the}} chapter. Previously, investigation of low oxidation state uranium Pacman chemistry has been confined to the smaller macrocycle, H 4 LMe, and frequently resulted in the formation of insoluble polymeric materials that were intractable and challenging to analyse. In Chapter Three, metallation of the larger macrocycle, H 4 LA, with UI 3 to generate a single soluble species is described, although this product could not be isolated or characterised in the solid state. A new synthesis of [U(BH 4) 3 (THF) 2] from UI 3 and NaBH 4 affords an alternative U(III) precursor to UI 3. Metallation of H 4 LA using a sodium base and U(BH 4) 3 (THF) 2 yields the ionic product [Na(THF) 4][U(BH 4) 2 (μ-BH 4) (THF) 2 (LA) ] which was characterised in solution and the solid state. Reaction of this compound with KO(C 6 H 2 (tBu) 3) forms the ligand substitution product [U(OAr) 2 (endo-BH 4 K) (THF) 2 (LA) ] which undergoes selective reaction with excess S 8 or CS 2 to form [U(OAr) 2 (μ-S 2) (LA) ] and [U(OAr) 2 (μ-S) (LA) ] respectively. It was discovered that the [U(BH 4) 3 (THF) 2] metallation strategy could be successfully extended to H 4 LMe to form [Li(THF) 4][U(BH 4) 2 (μ-BH 4) (LMe) ]. Protonolysis of the borohydride ligands of the complexes of the two different macrocycles was investigated using the weak acid [HNEt 3][BPh 4]. NMR spectroscopy indicated that both exo BH 4 − groups in both complexes can be successively removed to generate neutral and cationic complexes but these were not isolated. Metallation of H 4 LA with UCl 4 forms the ionic product [Li(THF) 4][U(Cl) 2 (μ-Cl) 3 (LA) ]. Various ligand substitution reactions were attempted but the only structurally characterised product was [U(OtBu) (Cl) U(OtBu) (py) (μ-Cl) (LA) ], formed by reaction with KOtBu. Conclusions are discussed at the end of the chapter. Experimental and characterising data are provided in Chapter Four...|$|R
40|$|AbstractEarth-abundant Transition Metal Complexes for Catalytic Proton and Carbon Dioxide ReductionBy Van Sara ThoiDoctor of Philosophy in ChemistryUniversity of California, BerkeleyProfessor Christopher J. Chang, ChairThe {{immediacy of}} global climate change and {{depletion}} of non-renewable resources have intensified efforts in sustainable energy technologies. In particular, the conversions of protons to hydrogen and carbon dioxide to value-added chemicals have garnered heavy interest in the search for sustainable alternative fuels. The present work will focus on the development of cheap and earth-abundant metal catalysts for proton and carbon dioxide reduction. Our group has published a previous report on the electrocatalytic generation of hydrogen from neutral water by a high-valent molybdenum-oxo complex supported by a pentadentate ligand, [(PY 5 Me 2) MoO] 2 + (PY 5 Me 2 = 2, 6 -bis(1, 1 -di(pyridin- 2 -yl) ethyl) pyridine), on a mercury electrode. However, the use of a mercury electrode under aqueous conditions is not conducive for characterizing the active catalytic species. Thus, a study of this system in organic media with a carbon electrode is initiated to examine the catalytic mechanism. Voltammetry and controlled-potential electrolyses show that a total of three electrons are necessary to obtain the active catalyst and offer new insights into the mechanism for hydrogen generation. This work corroborates with a computational mechanistic study. Moving towards first-row transition metal complexes for hydrogen evolution, a new series of Co complexes supported by a tetradentate pyridine platform has been developed for electrocatalytic and photocatalytic water reduction to understand the effects of open coordination sites. As direct tetradentate analogues to PY 5 Me 2, three new ligands of the form PY 4 Me x H y (2 -(1, 1 -bis(2 -pyridyl) ethyl) - 6 -(2 -(2 -pyridyl) <b>alkyl)</b> <b>pyridine,</b> x = 1 - 3 and y = 0 - 2) and their Co complexes are synthesized and characterized. In the solid-state structure, the Co complex supported by PY 4 Me 3 is a five-coordinate species, while [(PY 4 Me 2 H) Co(CH 3 CN) (OTf) ] + and [(PY 4 MeH 2) Co(CH 3 CN) (OTf) ] + are six-coordinate complexes. The extra methyl group in PY 4 Me 3 platform impedes the binding of a sixth ligand in the equatorial site. Interestingly, this small difference leads to significant differences in the electrochemical and photochemical behaviors of all three Co complexes. Although [(PY 4 Me 3) Co(CH 3 CN) ] 2 + has the lowest cathodic onset potential for electrocatalytic water reduction, it is the least active for photochemical hydrogen evolution. On the contrary, the six-coordinate [(PY 4 MeH 2) Co(CH 2 CN) (OTf) ] +, which has the highest catalytic onset potential, has the highest photocatalytic performance. At pH 7, [(PY 4 MeH 2) Co(CH 3 CN) (OTf) ] + photochemically reduces water to hydrogen with turnover numbers of up to 1000 in 18 h. This series of complexes offer insights on structural tuning of the ligand platform to improve catalytic hydrogen evolution. Another important reaction related to sustainable energy is the reduction of carbon dioxide. The abundance of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere offers tremendous opportunities for using CO 2 as a C 1 feedstock. However, carbon dioxide is a thermodynamic sink and its activation requires multiple electrons and a large amount of energy. Thus, the use of metal catalysts to serve as a multi-electron reservoir is highly desirable. In this vein, a novel motif that uses a nickel complex supported by bis(N-imidazolylpyridine) methane, [Ni(Me bimpy) ] 2 +, is discovered to be an active electrocatalyst for carbon dioxide reduction. Because of the large thermodynamic overpotential for carbon dioxide reduction, selectivity for CO 2 conversion over proton reduction is crucial. In this system, only the conversion of carbon dioxide to carbon monoxide is observed even in the presence of high proton concentration. Furthermore, the potential at which carbon dioxide is reduced can be tuned by elongating the alkyl bridge; the added flexibility of [Ni(Et bimpy) ] 2 + and [Ni(Pr bimpy) ] 2 + decrease the potential by 100 mV and 200 mV, respectively, from the parent complex. The ligand platform can be further functionalized to tune the potential and increase the stability of the complexes. Thus, a new family of Ni catalysts supported by carbene-pyridine ancillary ligands has been synthesized and fully characterized. Another approach towards sustainable long-term CO 2 utilization is solar-driven photochemical reduction of CO 2. To this end, a second generation of Ni catalysts has been developed that utilizes carbenes and isoquinolines as ligand donors. By tuning the &# 61552; systems in the ligand platform, a Ni complex supported by bis(3 -imidazoylisoquinolynl) propane ([Ni(Pr bimiq 1) ] 2 +) emerges as a promising electrocatalyst that reduces CO 2 to CO at a catalytic onset potential E 1 / 2 = − 1. 20 V vs. SCE. Moreover, photocatalytic CO 2 + reduction has been accomplished that utilizes a molecular Ir photosensitizer and an amine sacrificial reductant in an acetonitrile solution. In the presence of the catalyst, a five-fold increase in CO production is observed above background reactions. Turnover numbers of up to 98, 000 in 7 hours have been achieved and demonstrate the potential of solar-driven catalytic CO 2 reduction on a larger industrial scale. Taken together, this body of work displays the potential of earth-abundant metal catalysts for proton and carbon dioxide reduction. Understanding the molecular basis for these reactions will further aid the development of robust and efficient catalysts in both homogeneous and heterogeneous systems...|$|R
