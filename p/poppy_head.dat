40|$|A single-factor field {{experiment}} {{was conducted in}} 2008 and 2009. The {{aim of this study}} was to evaluate the low-morphi-ne poppy cv. Mieszko which was sown at three different dates: I-early, II-optimal, III-delayed. The results of the experiment demonstrate that there is no difference between morphological traits at characteristic growth stages. Plants in the population varied in the number of <b>poppy</b> <b>heads</b> (from 1 to 6). Plant pro-ductivity in the crop depended on the sowing date and growing year. Sowing poppy at the early and optimal date allowed more productive individuals that produced <b>poppy</b> <b>heads</b> with a higher unit weight to be obtained in the crop population. The most pro-ductive plants in the crop formed 3 or more <b>poppy</b> <b>heads</b> per plant. The results of experiment proved that the date of poppy sowing had a significant effect on plant growth and, as a conse-quence, on yield, in spite of the fact that it is a no-cost agrotech-nical factor.
