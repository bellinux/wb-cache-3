40|$|AbstractThe {{principle}} aim of {{this study}} is to explore and compare the effect of chitosan and linear polyvinyl amine, as biopolymer, on the antibacterial properties of the <b>prepared</b> <b>dressing</b> based cotton. The biopolymer molecules can be covalently fixed on to the cotton by using friendly anchor chemicals like butanetetracarboxylic acid. The treated cotton are characterised through monitoring the susceptibility of the amino groups created on the surface of the fabric. The bacteriostatic effect was evaluated against Escerichia coli (E. coli) DSMZ 498. The results obtained show a synergistic bacetriostatic effect of the treated cotton samples by using chitosan/polyvinyl amine finishing system. The produced dressing based cotton could be used as a model system to treat wounds, ulcers as well as diabetic ulcers, in addition some kind of burns...|$|E
