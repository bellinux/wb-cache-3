40|$|A picture-word {{interference}} experiment {{examined the}} origin of the distractor frequency effect, the effect that pictures are named slower in the context of low-frequency than high-frequency words (Miozzo & Caramazza, Journal of Experimental Psychology, 132, 228 - 252, 2003). We compared two accounts of the effect: an early, input-related account and a late, response-related account. Participants named high and low-frequency pictures with low and high-frequency distractors in two conditions. In the immediate naming condition, picture and distractor were presented simultaneously. In the delayed naming condition, the distractor was presented 1, 000 ms after the picture; pictures had to be named upon distractor presentation. There was a distractor frequency effect in both conditions, but an effect of <b>picture</b> <b>frequency</b> only in the immediate naming condition (showing that in the delayed naming condition, lexical selection had been completed). These results support a late origin of the distractor frequency effect...|$|E
40|$|Region-based {{approach}} {{has become a}} popular research trend {{in the field of}} multimedia database retrieval. In this paper, we present the Region Frequency and Inverse <b>Picture</b> <b>Frequency</b> (RF*IPF) weighting, a measure developed to unify region-based multimedia retrieval systems with textbased information retrieval systems. The weighting measure gives the highest weight to regions that occur often in a small number of images in the database. These regions are considered discriminators. With this weighting measure, we can blend image retrieval techniques with TF*IDFbased text retrieval techniques for large-scale Web applications. The RF*IPF weighting has been implemented as a part of our experimental SIMPLIcity image retrieval system and tested on a database of about 200, 000 general-purpose images. Experiments have shown that this technique is effective in discriminating images of different semantics. Additionally, the overall similarity approach enables a simple querying interface for multimedia information retrieval systems. ...|$|E

40|$|Interactive {{selection}} of the desired viewpoint is one important feature in multiview video streaming. When receivers differ {{in the number of}} simultaneously displayed views, it is challenging to optimize the multiview coding structure {{particularly when it comes to}} the use of inter-view prediction and anchor <b>picture</b> <b>frequency.</b> This paper presents a coding and transmission scheme for streaming to clients of different display capabilities. The scheme saves transmission bandwidth by sending only those views that are displayed in a receiver. Furthermore, the scheme enables viewpoint switching through inter-view-predicted redundant pictures representing different sets of views being switched from and switched to. When switching happens at a switch point, an appropriate redundant picture is adaptively chosen based on which views were transmitted before and will be transmitted after the switch point. Experimental results show that the proposed scheme improves the rate-distortion (RD) performance compared to simple anchor picture insertion. Index Terms—Multiview video coding, streaming 1...|$|E

40|$|Frequency {{is known}} to {{modulate}} outcomes on tasks like picture naming. According to the frequency lag hypothesis {{there is a common}} mechanism for the effects of word frequency, language dominance and bilingual and monolingual differences in picture naming (Gollan, Montoya, Cera, 2 ̆ 6 Sandoval, 2008; Gollan, Slattery, Goldenberg, Van Assche, Duyck, 2 ̆ 6 Rayner, 2011). English monolinguals and English-Spanish bilinguals were tested on a picture naming task with pictures that had high and low frequency names. Response times, priming scores, and error rates were assessed. Response times indicated that monolinguals, and bilinguals were slower to respond to for low <b>frequency</b> <b>picture</b> names than high <b>frequency</b> <b>picture</b> names. Also, monolinguals were faster at the picture naming task than bilinguals and bilinguals were faster in their dominant (L 1) than non-dominant (L 2) language. Priming scores indicated that monolinguals and bilinguals showed stronger priming for low frequency than high <b>frequency</b> <b>picture</b> names. Priming was stronger for bilingual L 2 but not L 1 compared to monolinguals. The effects of frequency and language on priming did not interact for bilinguals. However, frequency effects were stronger for bilinguals in L 1 and L 2 than for monolinguals. Error rates were higher for low <b>frequency</b> <b>picture</b> names than high frequency. Also, there were more errors for bilinguals than monolinguals, and more errors in bilingual L 2 than L 1. The results are discussed in terms of the frequency lag hypothesis. These findings provide support for the frequency-lag hypothesis in terms of the interaction of frequency and language on response times, but not for the interaction of frequency and language on priming for bilinguals. ...|$|R

Analogue video signals contain a frequency content from 25 Hz up to around 5 MHz, and so variations in frequency responses will affect the picture in various ways, depending on whether it is high frequency (>1 MHz) or low frequency (<1 MHz) distortion. Low frequency distortion will cause field-rate impairment, manifesting itself as luminance variation between {{the top and bottom}} of a <b>picture.</b> High <b>frequency</b> distortion causes problems with sharpness of the picture: high frequency roll-off causes loss of definition, while high frequency peaking emphasises edges and adds noise to the picture.|$|R

In both experiments we observed faster latencies for high-frequency pictures than for low-frequency <b>pictures.</b> This <b>frequency</b> effect was stable over four repetitions of the stimuli.

On average the best learning scores were found for the 3 rd condition. In experiment 2 we investigated how best to present the static pictures, by examining the number of pictures required (low vs. high frequency) and their appearance type (static vs. dynamic).
