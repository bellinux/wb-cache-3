50|$|The parapharyngeal {{space is}} shaped like an {{inverted}} pyramid. Medial and {{inferior to the}} parapharyngeal space is the carotid sheath, containing the internal carotid artery and cranial nerves IX, X and XI. Behind both the parapharyngeal space and carotid space lies the retropharyngeal space, and deep to this a potential space known as the danger space. The danger space serves as an important pathway for complicated infections of the posterior pharynx to enter the chest and spinal column. Anterior to the parapharyngeal space is the masticator space which contains the lower dental row, muscles of mastication, the inferior alveolar nerve as well as branches of cranial nerve V. Lateral to the parapharyngeal space lies the <b>parotid</b> <b>space,</b> which contains the parotid gland, the external carotid artery and cranial nerve VII. Although initial evaluation is typically by physical exam and endoscopy, follow up with CT and MRI usually is needed if surgical intervention is planned.|$|E

40|$|Magister Scientiae Dentium - MSc(Dent) Purpose: To {{assess the}} value of {{postoperative}} CT scans {{in the management of}} severe cervicofacial infections or deep neck abscesses. Patients and Methods: Thirteen patients underwent post-operative contrast enhanced CT scans after initial incision and drainage followed by a tracheostomy. As per surgical protocol, the CT scans were taken with radiopaque surgical drains in situ from the brain down to the mediastinum and chest/lungs. Data were collected on the presence of abscesses, their location, the location of surgical drains and presence of other pathology. Results: The most common initially affected space was the submandibular space (69 %), followed by the submental space (62 %). Almost half of the cases studied had two spaces affected and slightly less than a third had three spaces affected. Slightly more than half (54 %) of the patients were in good health generally. More than a third (38. 5 %) of the patients were HIV positive, and thus immuno-compromised. The mean time lapse between the CT and surgery was 2. 61 days (SD = 1. 56). In the majority (69. 23 %) of post-operative scans a residual pus collection was found. In just over a quarter (30. 8 %) of the patients no residual pus collection was detected on the postoperative CT scan, while in seven patients (53. 8 %) affected fascial spaces were missed by the surgeon. These spaces included the submasseteric, anteriormediastinum and <b>parotid</b> <b>spaces.</b> Almost half (44. 15 %) of the patients required a repeatincision and drainage. Conclusion: This study demonstrates clinical value of post-operative CT scans in severe cervicofacial infections. This study also advances the argument for acquisition of preoperative CECT scans for all patients with severe cervicofacial infection...|$|R

30|$|The carotid {{space is}} a paired space {{defined by the}} carotid sheath, a {{connective}} tissue boundary in the neck, that is made by the superficial, middle, and deep layers of the deep cervical fascia. Extending from the jugular foramen at the skull base to the aortic arch at the thoracic inlet, the carotid space is divided craniocaudally into the supra- and infrahyoid regions. The suprahyoid carotid space is surrounded anteriorly by the masticator and parapharyngeal spaces, laterally by the <b>parotid</b> <b>space,</b> medially by the retropharyngeal space, and posteriorly by the perivertebral space. A mass centered within the carotid space will displace the parapharyngeal fat/space anteromedially [1].|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: Suprahyoid neck lesions are {{difficult}} to assess only by means of clinical inspection and therefore imaging techniques are required to precisely evaluate suprahyoid neck spaces. The {{aim of this study}} was to evaluate the distinctive role of computed tomography in the assessment of anatomical source and pathological type of masses involving the suprahyoid neck spaces. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Sixty patients presenting with suprahyoid neck masses underwent computed tomography of the neck. The CT findings were correlated with histopathological findings and a final diagnosis was made. RESULTS: Overall, male preponderance was seen except in the case of <b>parotid</b> <b>space</b> lesions where female predominance was seen. The most common aetiology was squamous cell carcinoma and the majority of cases (30 %) were seen in patients aged 41 – 50 years. The majority of lesions were found in the pharyngeal mucosal space (n= 16) with squamous cell carcinoma being the most common pathology. In the <b>parotid</b> <b>space,</b> pleomorphic adenoma and in the prestyloid parapharyngeal space, squamous cell carcinoma were the most common lesions, respectively. In the retropharyngeal space, an equal incidence of malignant and inflammatory aetiologies was seen. Abscesses were the most common lesions in the prevertebral space. The pleomorphic adenoma was the most common benign tumour and was also the second most common tumour in the suprahyoid neck spaces. CT had an excellent correlation with histopathological findings with sensitivity of 96. 4 %, specificity of 100 %, positive predictive value of 100 % and a negative predictive value of 91. 67 %. CONCLUSIONS: Computed tomography definitely has a major role to play in the evaluation of suprahyoid neck masses as it has an excellent correlation with post-operative histopathological diagnosis...|$|E
40|$|A {{review of}} 700 parotidectomies showed that 98 {{procedures}} were performed for <b>parotid</b> <b>space</b> tumors of non-salivary origin.

Of the 98 cases, 54 proved to be lymph node tumors, both neoplastic and inflammatory and 44 were tumors of various somatic origins. Among the latter group, bone and joint tumors, vascular lesions and some connective tissue tumors may be recognized preoperatively. Generally, however, the entire group of non-salivary tumors can be distinguished only intra-operatively, if at all. Correct recognition may lead to variations in operative techniques and extent of resection...|$|E
40|$|SummaryDeep lobe of {{the parotid}} gland is a rare {{localisation}} of head and neck tumors {{and most of them}} are pleomorphic adenoma. We encountered a 76 -year-old woman with deep lobe parotid gland oncocytic neoplasms (synchronous oncocytoma and multifocal nodular oncocytic hyperplasia), but without any complaints. The patient was operated for larynx carcinoma four years ago. A deep lobe parotid gland lesion was detected during radiological evaluation of her middle ear cholesteatoma. A near total parotidectomy was performed. Oncocytoma is an uncommon salivary gland tumor and generally occurs in the superficial lobe of parotid gland of older patients. Multifocal nodular oncocytic hyperplasia is an unusual parotid gland lesion that accounts for 0. 1 % of parotid tumors. Computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging, FNA and sialoscintigraphy may be helpful for evaluating parotid gland oncocytomas. Acinic cell carcinoma and clear cell carcinoma were the main differential diagnosis of oncocytoma. Surgical removal is the treatment of choice and total parotidectomy is suggested for deep lobe parotid gland oncocytomas. Recurrences are unusual for oncocytoma. Long-term follow up is necessary for multinodular cases. <b>Parotid</b> gland <b>space</b> occupying lesions may necessitate further emphasis regarding the fact that either second primary or a metastatic lesion may be found in especially a previously noted head and neck carcinoma patient...|$|R
40|$|A 7 -week old female infant was {{evaluated}} for facial asymmetry. The parents {{noted that the}} asymmetry had been noticeable at day 5 of life, with {{a significant increase in}} swelling over the preceding week. There was no ante-cedent trauma, fever, or apparent patient discomfort. The infant was born at term to a mother with a medical history significant for IgG deficiency and borderline IgM defi-ciency treated with intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG), but no history of perinatal complications. Upon physical examination, there was a mass involving the left parotid gland that included the preauricular region and the parotid over the arch of the zygoma, and minimal skin discoloration and a mild bluish hue just inferior to the zygomatic arch. The mass was spongy and compress-ible, but not edematous, and the patient was nonsyndromic. There was no evidence for lymphadenopathy or cutaneous changes. Further examination showed that the left ear canal was slightly collapsed, but that the tympanic mem-brane was intact. The right ear canal was patent with an intact tympanic membrane, and the middle ear appeared aerated. The infant had a patent nasal airway, clear oral cavity, and no evidence for tonsillar medialization or mass within the oral cavity. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with and without contrast showed a cystic mass involving the left <b>parotid,</b> left buccal <b>space,</b> and portions of the high left masticator space, including overlying subcutaneous soft tissues of the left cheek region (Figure 1). It appeared to be a diffuse lesion, extending from the periauricular region to the left malar region anteriorly.

40|$|Deep neck space {{infection}} {{may lead}} to severe and potentially life-threatening complications, such as airway obstruction, mediastinitis, septic embolization, dural sinus thrombosis, and intracranial abscess. The clinical presentation is widely variable, and often early symptoms {{do not reflect the}} disease severity. The complication risk depends on the extent and anatomical site: diseases that transgress fascial boundaries and spread along vertically oriented spaces (parapharyngeal, retropharyngeal, and paravertebral space) have a higher risk of complications and require a more aggressive treatment compared with those confined within a nonvertically oriented space (peritonsillar, sublingual, submandibular, <b>parotid,</b> and masticator <b>space).</b> Imaging has 5 crucial roles: (1) confirm the suspected clinical diagnosis, (2) define the precise extent of the disease, (3) identify complications, (4) distinguish between drainable abscesses and cellulitis, and (5) monitor deep neck space infection progression. Ultrasonography is the gold standard to differentiate abscesses from cellulitis, for the diagnosis of lymphadenitis. and to identify internal jugular thrombophlebitis in the infrahyoid neck. However, field-of-view limitation and poor anatomical information confine the use of ultrasonography to the evaluation of superficial lesions and to image-guided aspiration or drainage. Computed tomography (CT) combines fast image acquisition and precise anatomical information without field-of-view limitations. For these reasons, it is the most reliable technique for the evaluation of deep and multicompartment lesions and for the identification of mediastinal and intracranial complications. Contrast agent administration enhances the capability to differentiate fluid collections from cellulitis and allows the detection of vascular complications. Magnetic resonance imaging is more time-consuming than CT, limiting its use to selected indications. It is the technique of choice for assessing the epidural space involvement in pre- and paravertebral space infections and complements CT in the evaluation of the infections reaching the skull base...|$|R

40|$|SUMMARY: Although {{transcutaneous}} ultrasound {{combined with}} fine-needle aspiration {{is often used}} as initial modality for evaluating superficial neck masses, its role in management of deep-seated neck masses is limited. Intraoral ultrasound and guided biopsy helps in obtaining tissue from deep-seated neck masses for an accurate histologic diagnosis, providing useful information in treatment planning. This article discusses the role of intraoral ultrasound and presents 3 cases in which biopsy of deep-seated neck masses under intraoral ultrasound guidance helped in diagnosis and management. Sonography supplemented by fine-needle aspiration cytol-ogy (FNAC) is the initial imaging technique of choice for most superficial head and neck lesions. It is well accepted that deep-seated lesions such as those within retropharyngeal space, parapharyngeal space, and deep portions of <b>parotid</b> <b>space</b> cannot be fully evaluated by transcutaneous sonogra-phy. However, large portions of these lesions can be ade-quately visualized by intraoral sonography and therefore are amenable to a sonography-guided biopsy or FNAC. We present 3 cases to illustrate the role of intraoral sonography for guidance of biopsy in deep-seated head and neck lesions...|$|E

Purpose. To subclassify parapharyngeal extension in nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) and investigate its prognostic value and staging categories based on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Methods and Materials. Data from 1504 consecutive NPC patients treated with definitive-intent radiotherapy were analyzed retrospectively. Sites of parapharyngeal extension were defined by MRI. Overall survival (OS), local relapse-free survival (LRFS), and distant metastasis-free survival (DMFS) were calculated by the Kaplan-Meier method and compared with the log-rank test.

40|$|Cheek {{metastasis}} from {{colorectal cancer}} is very unusual. We {{report on a}} 79 -year-old female rectal cancer patient who underwent low anterior resection and lymph node dissec-tion. The initial stage for this patient was T 3 N 0 M 0 (by AJCC 1997). Postoperatively 49 months later, she presented with a right cheek mass that progressively enlarged within 2 weeks. Computed tomographic (CT) scan showed a well-defined 5 ¡ 5 -cm mass over the right <b>parotid</b> <b>space</b> and infratemporal fossa. The tumor was noted to be displacing the right masseter muscle laterally with obliteration of the medial border. In addition, destruction of the right mandible was also noted. Histology of this right cheek mass revealed {{it to be a}} metastatic adenocarcinoma, which was {{similar to that of the}} primary rectal adenocarcinoma. Multiple metastases including to the bone, lung, and liver were also found. The patient only underwent radiotherapy to the right cheek mass because of its rapid growth.

40|$|Introduction: A {{laryngeal}} mask airway (LMA) is an established safe tool {{to support the}} airway during surgery under general anesthetic. It is commonly used both in North America and abroad. Complications with this device are rare. Presentation of case: A 50 -year old female developed a parapharyngeal neck abscess following an uneventful septorhinoplasty during use of an LMA Classic. The patient had symptoms of pain and difficulty swallowing. CT revealed extensive soft tissue edema and swelling in the right and posterior neck involving the right parapharyngeal space, right <b>parotid</b> <b>space,</b> minimal involvement of the right submandibular space, and extending across the retropharyngeal space. The abscess was incised and drained with an open approach, combined with laryngoscopy to evaluate {{the site of the}} infection at the right pyriform fossa. The patient fully recovered following discharge. Discussion: Despite the rare incidence of LMA injuries, early recognition of parapharyngeal neck abscesses can initiate early treatment and prevention of spread to retropharyngeal space where airway obstruction and emergent complications may occur. Conclusion: Laryngeal mask airways have a high rate of success and low rate of complications. In this reported case, pressure necrosis from over-inflation of the LMA is thought to have perforated the right pyriform fossa. The perforation created a communication into the parapharyngeal space causing infection. We report this case to highlight the importance of identifying possible complications associated with a routine method of airway management during shared airway surgeries...|$|E
40|$|Objectives : The main {{objective}} {{of the study was}} a) to differentiate cellulitis and abscess in buccal space region, b) to study the ultrasonographic anatomy of cheek region and c) to investigate the use of ultrasound in the diagnosis of inflammatory swellings of cheek region. Patients and Methods : The study consisted of 25 patients with unilateral buccal space inflammatory swellings of odontogenic origin. The contra lateral side was used as control. Toshiba ultrasonographic device with a linear array transducer (5 - 8 MHz) was used. The areas of interest were scanned under both transverse and longitudinal sections and were interpreted by a single observer. The clinical diagnosis of cellulitis or abscess was confirmed by the absence or presence of pus respectively both sonographically and by aspiration. Also various anatomical structures present in buccal space were studied. Results : Clinically 23 (92 &#x 0025;) were diagnosed as buccal space abscess and 2 (8 &#x 0025;) were cellulitis. Ultrasonographically and therapeutically 24 (96 &#x 0025;) were buccal space abscess and 1 (4 &#x 0025;) was cellulits. The sensitivity of clinical criteria over ultrasonographic diagnosis was 96 &#x 0025; with a specificity of 100 &#x 0025;. Also the cheek thickness in males and females varied from 8. 2 to 17. 1 mm with a mean of 11. 6 mm&# 177; 2. 1 (SD) and 8. 2 mm to 14. 2 mm with a mean of 11 &# 177; 1. 8 (SD). The subcutaneous tissue appeared moderately echogenic, buccinator - highly echogenic, deep adipose tissue - less echogenic and parotid duct was appreciated as a thin hyperechogenic band crossing the buccinator muscle. Buccal space, masticator space and <b>parotid</b> <b>space</b> were appreciated. Conclusion : This study supports the ultrasonographic method of imaging of orofacial inflammatory swellings with high sensitivity and specificity. This imaging modality can also help in aspiration of pus in different spaces. We have described the ultrasonographic anatomy of the above mentioned spaces which can help a beginner in this field...|$|E
40|$|Malignant parotid tumours are {{generally}} rare but {{become more common}} in the last decades of life; this increased incidence concerns mainly secondary <b>parotid</b> <b>space</b> involvement from metastasis or direct invasion. During the past five years, we observed and operated upon 84 patients for parotid diseases, performing 86 parotidectomies (2 bilateral operations). The patients included 30 (35. 7 %) over 75 years old (2 subjects over 90), mean age 80. 5 years, object of the present study. In these 30 patients 2 chronic infections were observed, 6 benign tumours and 22 malignant tumours with only 6 primary neoplastic lesions. Overall, 14 extended radical parotidectomies were performed, 13 conservative total parotidectomies, 2 superficial parotidectomies and 1 radical parotidectomy, a few associated with neck dissection and/or radiotherapy. Three patients died in the post-operative period from heart attack. Five patients died from disease (3 from melanomas – 2 after 3 years and 1 after 2 years – and 2 from primary carcinomas – 1 after 2 years and 1 after 1 year). Six patients died without disease from various causes (2 after 4 years, the others after 3, 2, 1 year and 8 months). Nine patients are alive, 8 NED and 1 with disease in the ethmoid after 2 years, the latter well under control with radiotherapy. This experience implies that surgical treatment of these secondary tumours, which are performed more frequently in old age, exposes the patient to the risk of serious complications (3 patients died in the immediate post-operative period) and stresses the importance of careful evaluation of general conditions. However, surgery seems to have been the treatment indicated also in the patients who subsequently died from the disease, but in whom at least two-year survival was achieved in almost all cases. Unfortunately, because of the advanced age of the patients, the final results are penalized by deaths from natural causes. It is, nevertheless, encouraging that over one third of the patients operated upon are free of disease...|$|E
