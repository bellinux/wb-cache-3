5000|$|A <b>presumption</b> <b>of</b> <b>survivorship</b> has {{referred}} {{to a number of}} different presumptions. The term is sometimes used to refer to presumptions that one or another of two persons lived the longer when they died together in the same accident. [...] The presumption that two or more people who establish a joint account intend for the survivors to have the assets put into the fund upon the death of one of the joint account holders has also been called the [...] "presumption of survivorship".|$|E
40|$|The Article {{addresses}} the frequently litigated {{issue of the}} ownership of joint bank accounts that elderly people may have opened to protect against incapacity or to avoid FDIC insurance limits on single accounts. Despite the strong possibility of these non-donative motives, most states—by statute or court decision—award the accounts to the surviving co-tenants instead of the depositors’ heirs or will beneficiaries. This occurs even when the account contract did not contain language <b>of</b> <b>survivorship</b> and even {{when there is no}} evidence that the depositor was offered a contract that would have allowed him or her to choose an agency arrangement. The author argues that these <b>presumptions</b> in favor <b>of</b> <b>survivorship</b> rights exist because of a faulty analogy to other will substitutes such as life insurance, where donative intent is clear. The author also examines the few statutory account forms that purport to allow depositors to express various intents. These forms are hopelessly complex for a depositor without legal training and propose a simpler deposit account agreement that would allow a depositor to clearly indicate whether donative intent exists...|$|R

The article also considers whether severance automatically leads to unequal shares without triggering s. 53 (1) (c) of the Law of Property Act 1925...|$|R

40|$|Preliminary draft) Fighting {{tax evasion}} is costly {{for the tax}} {{authorities}} as individual actions are hid-den. Without monitoring, sel 8 ̆ 5 sh agents will underreport their true income. Thus, when auditing is costly partial, random audits are implemented to deter evaders from cheating. In this paper we investigate two alternative mechanisms based on: random auditing: <b>presumption</b> <b>of</b> innocence or <b>presumption</b> <b>of</b> guilt schemes. Theses sym-metric schemes are based: on aggregate disclosure of tax evasion existence, collective nes and random audits. We experimentally test their e ¢ ciency to lessens tax eva-sion and conclude the <b>presumption</b> <b>of</b> guilt scheme shows even better results than the <b>presumption</b> <b>of</b> guilt scheme...|$|R

50|$|In many states, tenancy by the {{entireties}} {{is recognized}} as a valid form of ownership for bank accounts and financial assets. One must be careful to ensure that the {{tenancy by the entireties}} designation is chosen as opposed to other forms of joint ownership such as joint tenancy with rights <b>of</b> <b>survivorship,</b> so that the benefits of tenancy by the entireties status is not lost. For example, under Florida law, if a bank account titling document allows for tenancy by the entireties and joint tenancy with rights <b>of</b> <b>survivorship,</b> if the account is opened as a joint tenancy with rights <b>of</b> <b>survivorship</b> account, the benefits of tenancy by entireties will not attach.|$|R

40|$|There has {{recently}} been a proliferation of case law dealing with potential inroads into the <b>presumption</b> <b>of</b> innocence in the criminal law of England and Wales, {{in the light of}} article 6 (2) of the European Convention on Human Rights. This article is concerned with the nature <b>of</b> the <b>presumption</b> <b>of</b> innocence. It considers two central issues. The first is how the courts should address the question <b>of</b> when the <b>presumption</b> <b>of</b> innocence is interfered with. The second {{is the extent to which}} interference with the <b>presumption</b> <b>of</b> innocence may be justified on the grounds of proportionality.

40|$|This article’s primary {{aim is to}} {{highlight}} the essentially critical potential <b>of</b> the <b>presumption</b> <b>of</b> innocence, {{as well as the}} need for this critical potential to be duly recognized. It is argued that the essential meaning <b>of</b> the <b>presumption</b> <b>of</b> innocence is best understood when approached from what is referred to as its counterfactual status. As a first step, the different values and functions that are attributed to the <b>presumption</b> <b>of</b> innocence in contemporary legal literature are discussed, in order to provide an outline of the central ideas it contains or is supposed to contain. Subsequently, the concept of ‘counterfactuality’ is introduced and it is argued that a counterfactual perspective can further clarify the nature <b>of</b> the <b>presumption</b> <b>of</b> innocence. Next, a number of fundamental shifts in society and criminal justice are discussed that affect the <b>presumption</b> <b>of</b> innocence and that lend a large measure of urgency to disclosing its essence and critical potential. The conclusion argues that today’s threats to the <b>presumption</b> <b>of</b> innocence are of a fundamental nature, and that attempts to preserve the principle’s efficacy should focus on the value attached to its counterfactual and critical nature...|$|R
