5|$|In the Prose Edda book Skáldskaparmál (chapter 57), the god Bragi {{explains}} {{the origin of}} poetry. Bragi says that it originated in the Æsir–Vanir War, when during the peace conference the Æsir and the Vanir formed a truce by all spitting into a vat. When they left, the gods decided {{that it should not}} be <b>poured</b> <b>out,</b> but rather kept as a symbol of their peace, and so from the contents made a man, Kvasir. Kvasir is later murdered, and from his blood is made the Mead of Poetry.|$|E
5|$|Somewhat later, andesitic lavas <b>poured</b> <b>out</b> {{from what}} is now Reading Peak and mainly flowed {{to the south and}} east, {{reaching}} the head of Warner Valley. By this time, the park's eastern portion had been transformed into a relatively flat plain. The activity was followed by an eruption of the Eastern basalts from volcanoes east of the park. These thick flows have subsequently eroded to produce rugged hills that limit the park on the east. Taken together, these various flows built the lava plateau that the Lassen volcanic area is located on.|$|E
5|$|Edziza's shield volcanoes {{are built}} {{almost entirely of}} fluid lava flows. They formed {{as a result of}} lava flowing out in all {{directions}} from central summit vents and from groups of vents, building a broad, gently sloping cone of flat, domical shape. They are built up slowly by the accretion of thousands of lava flows of highly fluid basaltic lava, which spread widely over great distances, and then cool as thin, gently dipping sheets. In some shield volcano eruptions, basaltic lava has <b>poured</b> <b>out</b> quietly from fissure vents instead of central vents, flooding the surrounding countryside with lava flow upon lava flow, forming Edziza's broad lava plateau.|$|E

5|$|Minnesota {{has some}} of the Earth's oldest rocks, gneisses that are about 3.6 billion years old (80 percent as old as the planet). About 2.7 billion years ago, basaltic lava <b>poured</b> <b>out</b> of cracks in the floor of the {{primordial}} ocean; the remains of this volcanic rock formed the Canadian Shield in northeast Minnesota. The roots of these volcanic mountains and the action of Precambrian seas formed the Iron Range of northern Minnesota. Following a period of volcanism 1.1 billion years ago, Minnesota's geological activity has been more subdued, with no volcanism or mountain formation, but with repeated incursions of the sea, which left behind multiple strata of sedimentary rock.|$|E
5|$|While Adams {{tried to}} reassert {{control of the}} meeting, people <b>poured</b> <b>out</b> of the Old South Meeting House and headed to Boston Harbor. That evening, a group of 30 to 130 men boarded the three vessels, some of them thinly {{disguised}} as Mohawk Indians, and dumped all 342 chests of tea into the water {{over the course of}} three hours. Adams never revealed whether he went to the wharf to witness the destruction of the tea. Whether or not he helped plan the event is unknown, but Adams immediately worked to publicize and defend it. He argued that the Tea Party was not the act of a lawless mob, but was instead a principled protest and the only remaining option that the people had to defend their constitutional rights.|$|E
5|$|In {{the myth}} called the Destruction of Mankind, related in the Book of the Heavenly Cow from the New Kingdom (c. 1550–1070 BC), Ra uses the Eye {{as a weapon}} against humans who have rebelled against his authority. He sends the Eye—Hathor, in her {{aggressive}} manifestation as the lioness goddess Sekhmet—to massacre them. She does so, but after {{the first day of}} her rampage, Ra decides to prevent her from killing all humanity. He orders that beer be dyed red and <b>poured</b> <b>out</b> over the land. The Eye goddess drinks the beer, mistaking it for blood, and in her inebriated state returns to Ra without noticing her intended victims. Through her drunkenness she has been returned to a harmless form. Nadine Guilhou suggests that the Eye's rampage alludes to the heat and widespread disease of the Egyptian summer, and in particular to the epagomenal days before the new year, which were regarded as unlucky. The red beer might then refer to the red silt that accompanied the subsequent Nile flood, which was believed to end the period of misfortune.|$|E

5|$|With {{the loss}} of Bucher and his aircraft, the C-130 Hercules had not {{completed}} a successful evacuation, and {{there were more than}} 600 people still on the ground. Next in line was Lieutenant Colonel William Boyd; he was flying an airlift mission into Chu Lai, until he was diverted into Khâm Đức to extract forces and civilians there. Just before Boyd touched down, an artillery shell exploded about 100 feet in front of his aircraft, so he was forced to pull the throttle forward. Boyd then pulled up and went around for a second approach, because he could see the desperation {{of the people on the}} ground. As he landed, hundreds of civilians and soldiers <b>poured</b> <b>out</b> of the ditches and rushed onto the aircraft. Because he had witnessed the destruction of Bucher's C-130 while taking off in the north direction, Boyd decided to fly out from the southwest. After Boyd's aircraft was airborne, he banked the aircraft so it would be masked by the rolling terrain. The aircraft sustained damages to the left wing, the fuselage, and the leading edge of both wings, but it landed safely in Chu Lai with all the passengers.|$|E
25|$|Orton revelled in his {{achievement}} and <b>poured</b> <b>out</b> new works. He had completed Entertaining Mr Sloane {{by the time}} Ruffian was broadcast. He sent a copy to theatre agent Peggy Ramsay in December 1963. It premiered at the New Arts Theatre on 6 May 1964, produced by Michael Codron. Reviews ranged from praise to outrage.|$|E

For Aquinas the Passion of Christ <b>poured</b> <b>out</b> the grace of salvation and all its virtues unto humanity.|$|E

50|$|The video {{opens up}} with all band members playing their {{instruments}} in a warehouse. At {{the beginning of the}} chorus, the keyboardist, Sarah Gardiner, and the lead singer, Amandah Wilkinson, begin to fight. As Wilkinson hits Gardiner in the mouth, yellow paint <b>pours</b> <b>out</b> of her mouth. The bassist, Ashley McConnell, begins to fight Wilkinson as well during the chorus. Wilkinson wins while green paint <b>pours</b> <b>out</b> of her mouth. For the second chorus the violinist, Taylor Henderson, begins to fight Wilkinson and Henderson punches Wilkinson in the mouth and pink paint <b>pours</b> <b>out</b> of her mouth. Wilkinson then punches Henderson in the mouth and orange blood <b>pours</b> <b>out.</b> During the bridge, it shows various shots of all members getting punched except for Tim Commandeur. Commandeur then uses his crash cymbal from his drum set and uses them as Frisbees and cuts off Henderson's hand and McConnell's foot. He then chucks his drum sticks at Gardiner and they go through her eyes. Wilkinson then rips off Commandeur's arm as blue blood <b>pours</b> <b>out.</b> Henderson then uses her remaining arm to make her violin as a bow and arrow which then stabs Wilkinson in the stomach. For the conclusion of the video, it shows all members dead on the floor.|$|R
25|$|A thorough-going {{clean-up}} was put underway. The liquor {{traffic was}} broken up, many stills being seized and destroyed, and several thousand gallons of whiskey being captured and <b>poured</b> <b>out.</b> Two hundred and three gambling slot machines were seized and destroyed, {{and in a}} period of twenty four hours, no less than twelve hundred prostitutes left the town of Borger.|$|E
25|$|In Greek mythology, this {{constellation}} {{is known}} as the Great Fish and it is portrayed as swallowing the water being <b>poured</b> <b>out</b> by Aquarius, the water-bearer constellation. The two fish of the constellation Pisces are said to be the offspring of the Great Fish. In Egyptian mythology, this fish saved the life of the Egyptian goddess Isis, so she placed this fish and its descendants into the heavens as constellations of stars.|$|E
25|$|The prophet asked Who came in crimson {{garments}} from Edom, mighty to save, and why God’s apparel was red {{like one}} who trod {{in the wine}} vat. God said that God had trodden the winepress in anger alone, and trampled in fury, for the day of vengeance was in God’s heart, and God’s year of redemption had come. God looked and found none to help to uphold God’s will, so God trod down the peoples in anger, and <b>poured</b> <b>out</b> their blood.|$|E

25|$|A Purananuru poem (poem 30) {{says that}} big ships entered {{the port of}} Puhar without slacking sail, and <b>poured</b> <b>out</b> onto the beach {{precious}} merchandise brought from overseas. In the extensive markets of Puhar there were many tall mansions surrounded by platforms reached by high ladders. These mansions had many apartments and were provided with doorways, great and small, and with wide hallways and corridors (Pattinappaalai – II –142-158). In {{all parts of the}} town there were flags flying of various kinds and shapes.|$|E

25|$|On the right, Beauregard's men left Solre-le-Château at 7:00 am. Near Obrechies, four squadrons of Austrian cavalry charged {{them and}} drove them off, {{with the loss}} of three field guns. Duquesnoy's {{division}} departed Flaumont at 6:00 am and marched through Beugnies, Dimont and Dimechaux. Supported by a plentiful artillery, the French infantry drove two Austrian battalions out of Wattignies, but as the French <b>poured</b> <b>out</b> of {{the other side of the}} village they were met by an infantry-cavalry counterattack. Duquesnoy's soldiers abandoned Wattignies and retreated to Dimechaux and Dimont.|$|E

25|$|The Bay of Fundy {{lies in a}} {{rift valley}} called the Fundy Basin; as the rift began to {{separate}} from mainland North America, volcanic activity occurred, forming volcanoes and flood basalts. These flood basalts <b>poured</b> <b>out</b> over the landscape, covering much of southern Nova Scotia. Sections of the flood basalts have been eroded away, but still form a basaltic mountain range known as North Mountain. As a result, much of the basin floor is made of tholeiitic basalts giving its brown color. The rift valley eventually failed (see aulacogen) as the Mid-Atlantic Ridge continued to separate North America, Europe, and Africa.|$|E
25|$|At {{the date}} of my visit, the volcano had <b>poured</b> <b>out,</b> for five months continuously, a stream of lava on the Legaspi side from the very summit. The viscid mass bubbled quietly but grandly, and overran {{the border of the}} crater, {{descending}} several hundred feet in a glowing wave, like red-hot iron. Gradually, fading as the upper surface cooled, it changed to a thousand sparkling rills among the crevices, and, as it passed beyond the line of complete vision behind the woods near the base, the fires twinkled like stars, or the scintillions of a dying conflagration. More than half of the mountain height was thus illuminated.|$|E
25|$|Mills remarked after Deshler's death:I may pause {{here and}} pay a passing tribute {{to the memory of}} our fallen chief. He was brave, generous and kind, even to a fault. Ever watchful and careful for the safety of any member of his command, he was ever ready to peril his own...He <b>poured</b> <b>out</b> his own blood upon the spot watered by the best blood of the brigade. Amongst the host of brave hearts that were offered the altar of {{sacrifice}} for their country on that beautiful Sabath, there perished not one, noble, braver, or better than his. He lived beloved, and fell lamented and mourned by every officer and man of his command.|$|E
