25|$|There is a large, {{full service}} {{aircraft}} modification and maintenance facility {{on the south}} side of the airport. It was originally built during World War II, but was subsequently expanded. While little work is now performed at the complex, the facility sits on approximately 180 acres of land and has 1.7 million square feet under its roof. It has 10 aircraft <b>pull-through</b> bays with space under the roof for 54 737 sized narrow-body aircraft.|$|E
25|$|Good {{practices}} in modern, earthquake-resistant structures dictate {{that there be}} good vertical connections throughout every component of the building, from undisturbed or engineered earth to foundation to sill plate to vertical studs to plate cap through each floor and continuing to the roof structure. Above the foundation and sill plate the connections are typically made using steel strap or sheet stampings, nailed to wood members using special hardened high-shear strength nails, and heavy angle stampings secured with through bolts, using large washers to prevent <b>pull-through.</b> Where inadequate bolts are provided between the sill plates and a foundation in existing construction (or are not trusted due to possible corrosion), special clamp plates may be added, {{each of which is}} secured to the foundation using expansion bolts inserted into holes drilled in an exposed face of concrete. Other members must then be secured to the sill plates with additional fittings.|$|E
40|$|Quantifications of {{gastro-oesophageal}} anatomy in cadavers {{have led}} some {{to identify the}} lower oesophageal sphincter (LOS) with the anatomical gastric sling-clasp fibres at the oesophago-cardiac junction (OCJ). However, in vivo studies have led others to argue for two overlapping components proximally displaced from the OCJ: an extrinsic crural sphincter of skeletal muscle and an intrinsic physiological sphincter of circular smooth-muscle fibres within the abdominal oesophagus. Our aims were to separate and quantify in vivo the skeletal and smooth muscle sphincteric components pharmacologically and clarify {{the description of the}} LOS. In two protocols an endoluminal ultrasound-manometry assembly was drawn through the human gastro-oesophageal segment to correlate sphincteric pressure with the anatomic crus.

40|$|Postprandial {{gastroesophageal}} reflux (PGER) in {{the distal}} esophagus (DE) {{is associated with}} a gastric juice 'acid pocket' (AP). Baclofen reduces AP extension into the DE in healthy volunteers, in part through increased lower esophageal sphincter (LES) pressure. We aimed to verify whether baclofen also affects postprandial AP location and extent in gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) patients. Thirteen treatment-naive heartburn-prevalent GERD patients underwent two AP studies, after pretreatment with baclofen 40 [*]mg or placebo 30 [*]minutes preprandially. We performed pH-probe stepwise <b>pull-throughs</b> (PT) (1 [*]cm/min, LES - 10 to + 5 [*]cm) before and every 30 minutes from 30 [*]minutes before up to 150 [*]minutes after a test meal. After the meal, both after placebo and baclofen, gastric pH significantly dropped at 30, 60, 90 [*]minutes postprandially (P: nadir pHs of 3. 9 ± 0. 6, 2. 3 ± 0. 6, 2. 1 ± 0. 4; B: nadir pHs of 2. 5 ± 0. 4, 2. 8 ± 0. 4, 2. 5 ± 0. 3; all P < 0. 05). After placebo, LES pressure decreased at 60, 90 and 120 minutes postprandially (32. 7 ± 6. 1 vs. 24. 5 ± 3. 1, 27. 3 ± 5. 9, 27. 3 ± 6. 0 [*]mmHg; analysis of variance [ANOVA], P = 0. 037), but this was prevented by baclofen (25. 4 ± 3. 4 vs. 29. 4 ± 2, 32. 2 ± 1. 4, 35. 5 ± 1. 7 [*]mmHg, ANOVA, P = not significant (NS)). Baclofen did not significantly decrease the postprandial AP extent above the LES but prevented the postprandial increase in transient lower esophageal sphincter relaxations (TLESRs) (preprandial vs. postprandial, placebo: 1. 1 ± 0. 3 vs. 3. 7 ± 0. 7, P < 0. 05; baclofen: 1. 4 ± 0. 4 vs. 2 ± 0. 5, P = NS).

25|$|Unlike Washington, California {{does not}} sign the long east–west section of US101 between Gaviota and its {{junction}} with SR134 and SR170 in North Hollywood as west and east. Instead, the California Department of Transportation (Caltrans) observes the overall {{direction of the}} highway and marks these portions as north and south. Local references to {{this portion of the}} freeway, including traffic reports, usually refer to the directions on this section as east for southbound lanes and west for northbound lanes. In the late 1990s, Caltrans began placing guide signs on local streets in the San Fernando Valley adjacent to US101 which identified eastbound and westbound entrances to the freeway. Other than replacing older guide signs which previously referenced the official northbound and southbound designations of the freeway, Caltrans made no other changes to mainline or street signing, and as such, <b>pull-through</b> signs, overhead signs, and freeway entrance signs all still reference north and south instead of east and west.|$|E

The cholinergic component was reconstructed by subtracting the atropine-resistant pressures from the full pressures, referenced to the anatomic crus. To evaluate {{the extent to which the}} cholinergic contribution approximated the full smooth-muscle sphincter, in protocol II seven patients undergoing general anaesthesia for non-oesophageal pathology were administered cisatracurium to paralyse the crus. The smooth-muscle sphincter pressures were measured after lung inflation to approximate FI. The cholinergic smooth-muscle pressure profile in protocol I (FI) matched closely the post-cisatracurium smooth-muscle pressure profile in protocol II, and the atropine-resistant pressure profiles correlated spatially with the crural sling during diaphragmatic displacement. Thus, the atropine-resistant and cholinergic pressure contributions in protocol I approximated the skeletal and smooth muscle sphincteric components. The smooth-muscle pressures had well-defined upper and lower peaks. The upper peak overlapped and displaced rigidly with the crural sling, while the distal peak separated from the crus/upper-peak by 1. 1 cm between FI and FE. These results suggest the existence of separate upper and lower intrinsic smooth-muscle components. The ‘upper LOS’ overlaps and displaces with the crural sling consistent with a physiological LOS. The distal smooth-muscle pressure peak defines a ‘lower LOS’ that likely reflects the gastric sling/clasp muscle fibres at the OCJ. The distinct physiology of these three components may underlie aspects of normal sphincteric function, and complexity of sphincter dysfunction...|$|R
40|$|We {{studied the}} opossum {{sphincter}} of Oddi (SO) {{because in this}} species the SO is approximately 3 cm in length and its extraduodenal location permits recording of motor activity with negligible interference from duodenal motor activity.

SO <b>pull-throughs</b> using an infused catheter of 0. 6 -mm o. d. invariably showed a high pressure zone (HPZ) of 18 +/- 3 SE mm Hg in the terminal 4 - 5 mm of the SO segment. This HPZ had a narrow lumen, 0. 5 - 0. 7 mm in diam, and prominent circular muscle. The HPZ in the terminal SO had both active and passive components. HPZ with minimal amplitude and a paucity of underlying smooth muscle were present inconstantly at the junction of the SO segment with the CBD and pancreatic duct, respectively. The dominant feature of the SO segment was rhythmic peristaltic contractions that originated in the proximal SO and propagated toward the duodenum. These contractions occurred spontaneously at a rate of 2 - 8 /min, ranged up to 200 mm Hg in magnitude, had a duration of approximately 5 s and were not abolished by tetrodotoxin. Concurrent myoelectric and manometric recordings showed that each phasic contraction was immediately preceded by an electrical spike burst. Simultaneous recordings of cineradiography, CBD inflow of contrast medium, SO manometry, and SO electromyography indicated that rhythmic peristaltic contractions stripped contrast medium from the SO into the duodenum. During SO systole, CBD emptying was transiently interrupted, whereas SO filling occurred during the diastolic interval between SO peristaltic contractions. SO distention increased the frequency of SO peristalsis. We conclude that (a) the dominant feature of the opossum SO is rhythmic peristaltic contractions that originate in the proximal SO and propagate toward the duodenum; (b) these forceful SO peristaltic contractions are myogenic in origin and serve as a peristaltic pump that actively empties the SO segment; (c) CBD outflow occurs passively during SO diastole, but is interrupted transiently during each SO peristaltic contraction; and (d) a short HPZ with active as well as passive components exists in the distal SO segment and acts as a variable resistor to SO outflow...|$|R
