50|$|The Wisconsin General Test Apparatus is a {{piece of}} {{laboratory}} equipment designed to allow both the subject and the researcher to interact in a controlled environment, while conducting an assortment of memory and learning tests. The apparatus is constructed of two independent square compartments. One of which is a flexible cage to contain the primate subject and the other is the <b>presentation</b> <b>board</b> which houses the stimulus tray. The stimulus tray contains several food wells which can be covered with three-dimensional objects such as stars, squares, pyramids, or circles, with differing sizes and colors. There is a one way screen separating the two compartments which allows the researcher to control whether the subject can see them place the stimulus objects and food rewards in the stimulus tray or not. On the outside of the stimulus compartment, opposite the cage, there is a second one way screen which allows the researcher to observe the subject at each stage of the trial without interfering with the subject’s behavior. Both compartments are completely enclosed {{to ensure the safety of}} both the subject and the researcher.|$|E

30|$|In this paper, {{we discuss}} the {{development}} of a shared virtual <b>presentation</b> <b>board</b> (VPB) for e-Meeting system on the Web-based e-Learning System (WebELS) platform. VPB is a master copy of the presenter’s presentation panel environment, stored onto the server and used to achieve slide presentation synchronization between the presenter and the listeners. Synchronization in our context refers to real-time mirroring of slide presentation events that include slide controls for slide changing, vertical and horizontal scrolling, panning, zooming, cursor positioning, annotation, and playback control for video embedded on the slide. The system has a video conferencing function that provides an audio-video communication among the meeting participants. An effective e-Meeting is made possible by combining the online slide presentation and video conference system to create a so-called virtual room, where meeting participants convene via the Internet.|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} the current study was to {{investigate}} the contribution of upper and lower arm torsion to grasp orientation during a reaching and grasping movement. In particular, we examined how the visuomotor system deals with the conflicting demands of coordinating upper and lower arm torsion and maintaining Donders' Law of the upper arm (a behavioral restriction of the axes of arm rotation to a two-dimensional "surface"). In experiment 1, subjects reached out and grasped a target block that was presented in one of 19 orientations (5 degrees clockwise increments from horizontal to vertical) at one position in a vertical <b>presentation</b> <b>board.</b> In experiment 2, target blocks were presented in one of three orientations (horizontal, three-quarter, and vertical) at nine different positions in the <b>presentation</b> <b>board.</b> If reach and grasp commands control the proximal and distal arms separately, then one would only expect the lower arm to contribute to grasp orientations and that Donders' Law would hold for the upper arm-independent of grasp orientations. Instead, as the required grasp orientation increased from horizontal to vertical, there was a significant clockwise torsional rotation in the upper arm, which accounted for 9 % of the final vertical grasp orientation, and the lower arm, which accounted for 42 %. A linear relationship existed between the torsional rotations of the upper and lower arm, which indicates that the components of the arm rotate in coordination with one another. The location-dependent aspects of upper and lower arm torsion remained invariant, however, yielding consistently shaped Donders' "surfaces" (with different torsional offsets) for different grasp orientations. These observations suggest that the entire arm-hand system contributes to grasp orientation, and therefore, the reach/grasp distinction is not directly reflected in proximal-distal kinematics but is better reflected in the distinction between these coordinated orienting rules and the location-dependent kinematic rules for the upper arm that result in Donders' Law for one given grasp orientation...|$|E

30|$|In this paper, the {{development}} of a shared virtual <b>presentation</b> <b>board</b> (VPB) for real-time e-Meeting on the Web-based e-Learning System (WebELS) platform is introduced. WebELS is a general-purpose e-Learning system to support flexibility and globalization of higher education in science and technology. In WebELS, the Meeting module consists of online presentation and video conference system, and the combination of both allows the creation of a so-called virtual room for e-Meeting applications where participants convene via the Internet. Online presentation features synchronized slide control between the presenter and the listeners for slide changing, scrolling, zooming, cursor positioning, and playback control for video embedded on the slide. It also features online annotation that allows the presenter to write using a pen function on the slide display panel. The system has video conferencing function that provides an audio-video communication among the meeting participants. This paper discusses briefly the video conference system, and focuses on online presentation based on slide-based synchronization and {{the development}} of VPB. VPB is a shared object that resides on the server that is updated every time the presenter client makes mouse events and is periodically accessed by client system in order that listener’s presentation viewer synchronized with that of the presenter.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a video summarization method to visualizing video sequences in a static image {{for the purposes}} of efficient representation and quick overview. It can assist viewers to understand important video contents by revealing essential information of video story units and their relations. We have designed a new method called Video <b>Presentation</b> <b>Board</b> to extract, organize, and synthesize important video information in a succinct and meaningful visual format, which also preserves the elegance of original videos. Specifically, we propose a new video shot clustering method using both visual and audio data for analyzing video contents and collecting important shot information. To represent these important video information properly, we design a multi-level video summarization method to represent the contents and relations of video shots through abstracting both locations and interested objects and characters. Suitable amount of selected video information, with the assistants of special visual languages, is then organized and synthesized according to the relations between video events and temporal structure of the video sequence. We have designed and performed a preliminary user study to evaluate our approach and collected very encouraging results. We believe that this approach seamlessly integrates video analysis and visualization methods to provide visually appealing results. Our approach can be used to assist viewers grasp video contents efficiently, and are especially suitable for documentations and reports.

40|$|In {{this paper}} {{we present a}} novel {{architecture}} for the task of meeting event recognition in meetings that {{was inspired by the}} neural field theory. These group actions provide a basis that enables effective browsing and querying in a meeting archive. For our research we used the public available meeting corpus that is described in [3]. This corpus consists in special scripted meetings that were recorded in the IDIAP Smart Meeting Room. Each recorded meeting consists of a set of predefined group actions in a specific order that was defined in an agenda. The appearing group actions are: Monologue (one participant speaks continuously without interruption), Discussion (all participants engage in a discussion), Note-taking (all participants write notes), White-board (one participant at front of room talks and makes notes on the white board), and Presentation (one participant at front of room makes a presentation using the projector screen). A total of 53 scripted meetings with two disjoint sets of meeting participants were recorded. 30 of them were used for the training, the remaining 23 videos were used for the evaluation of the system. In each meeting there were four participants at six possible positions: four seats plus whiteboard and <b>presentation</b> <b>board.</b> For the task of segmenting the meetings into group actions we propose a new approach that is based on the theory of the neural fields, first analyzed by Amari [1]. The idea is to present the features of a whole meeting to the neural field simultaneously and get a segmentation and classification as output. In this way elements from the end of a meeting can have influence on elements at the beginning- and the other way round- which should increase the robustness of the classification task. The typical equation for a neural field is denoted in eq. 1. ∂u(x, t) τ = −u(x, t) ...|$|E

40|$|The eleven {{art works}} made during my masters program share similar themes and were created using a similar process. The {{concepts}} for my art begin with searching nature, {{looking at the}} natural environment that surrounds me to find something of interest. I start with nature because of the infinite range of intimate subjects it possesses; there is always something that grasps me at that moment among the trees, flowers, and birds in every season. When I find that interesting element {{it reminds me of}} a certain song, poem, or myth from Korean culture emerging from accumulated knowledge and memories, from conscious and unconscious education, and from customs. `My own unique element 2 ̆ 7 is born by projecting my emotional feelings as an artist, a mother, and a woman into the artwork. This is the first step of building my concepts. These observations, memories, feelings, and ideas lead to a series of rough sketches to develop the concept. While drawing, I recite the poem, sing the song, or remember the story hundreds of times. The sketches become progressively more specific and descriptive of the concept. Based on the rough sketches, I start to make a model to test the concept and anticipate problems that could happen while making the piece. Finally, all of the images and information for the artwork are gathered and organized on a final <b>presentation</b> <b>board</b> which generally includes a concept statement, rough sketch, final design drawing, and the materials to be used. The presentation boards help me keep the way more clearly in focus until the artwork is completed. These eleven artworks were all completed through this common process. These steps are sometimes switched a little, but I always start looking at the natural environment. The scope of the elements and the concepts that I find in the grandeur of nature lead gradually to elements from Korean culture and my subjective view as an artist, mother, and woman. I hope that people might feel and meet nature, Korean culture, and my personal artistic view through these artworks...|$|E
