The Lodge meets regularly to conduct the usual formal business of any small organisation (<b>pay</b> <b>bills,</b> organise social and charitable events, elect new members, etc.). In addition to business, the meeting may perform a ceremony to confer a Masonic degree or receive a lecture, which is usually on some aspect of Masonic history or ritual. At {{the conclusion of the}} meeting, the Lodge might adjourn for a formal dinner, or festive board, sometimes involving toasting and song.|$|E

25|$|In Austria, {{credit scoring}} is {{done as a}} blacklist. Consumers who did not <b>pay</b> <b>bills</b> {{end up on the}} blacklists that are held by {{different}} credit bureaus. Having an entry on the black list may result in the denial of contracts. Certain enterprises including telecom carriers use the list on a regular basis. Banks also use these lists, but rather inquire about security and income when considering loans. Beside these lists several agencies and credit bureaus provide credit scoring of consumers.|$|E

Men logged on more often, spent more time online, and {{were more likely to be}} broadband users, whereas women tended to make more use of opportunities to communicate (such as email). Men were more likely to use the Internet to <b>pay</b> <b>bills,</b> participate in auctions, and for recreation such as downloading music and videos. Men and women were equally likely to use the Internet for shopping and banking.|$|E
25|$|Sweden has {{a system}} for credit scoring that aims to find people {{with a history of}} neglect to <b>pay</b> <b>bills</b> or, most commonly, taxes. Anyone who does not pay their debts on time, and fails to make {{payments}} after a reminder, will have their case forwarded to the Swedish Enforcement Authority which is a national authority for collecting debts. The mere appearance of a company, or government office, as a debtor to this authority will result in a record among private credit bureaus; however, this does not apply to individuals as debtors. This record is called a Betalningsanmärkning (non-payment record) and by law can be stored for three years for an individual and five years for a company. This kind of nonpayment record will make it very difficult to get a loan, rent an apartment, get telephone subscriptions, rent a car or get a job where you handle cash. The banks, also use income and asset figures in connection with loan assessments.|$|E

25|$|By {{the timing}} of collection, VAT (as well as {{accounting}} in general) can be either accrual or cash based. Cash basis accounting is a very simple form of accounting. When a payment is received {{for the sale of}} goods or services, a deposit is made, and the revenue is recorded as of the date of the receipt of funds—no matter when the sale had been made. Cheques are written when funds are available to <b>pay</b> <b>bills,</b> and the expense is recorded as of the cheque date—regardless of when the expense had been incurred. The primary focus is on the amount of cash in the bank, and the secondary focus is on making sure all bills are paid. Little effort is made to match revenues to the time period in which they are earned, or to match expenses to the time period in which they are incurred. Accrual basis accounting matches revenues to the time period in which they are earned and matches expenses to the time period in which they are incurred. While it is more complex than cash basis accounting, it provides much more information about your business. The accrual basis allows you to track receivables (amounts due from customers on credit sales) and payables (amounts due to vendors on credit purchases). The accrual basis allows you to match revenues to the expenses incurred in earning them, giving you more meaningful financial reports.|$|E
500|$|The revised season {{schedule}} with 16 fewer {{regular-season games}} and a reduced pre-season caused an estimated loss of $400 million {{for both the}} team owners and the players [...] According to CNBC, the average player lost $220,000 after the first missed paycheck on November 15. However, each player did receive $100,000 from the NBA to compensate for salaries falling below the 57% BRI level in 2010–11. As of October 25, an estimated 400 NBA jobs were lost due to layoffs and attrition since the lockout—around 200 in the league office and another 200 among the 30 teams. As the lockout dragged on toward the holiday season, many NBA arenas workers felt the effect. Many of them worked part-time in order to supplement their income or to simply <b>pay</b> <b>bills</b> and {{they were unable to}} recover lost wages that resulted from cancelled games.|$|E
500|$|Selena gave Saldívar her American Express {{card for}} the purpose of {{conducting}} company business. Saldívar, however, instead used it to rent Lincoln Town Cars, entertain associates in upmarket restaurants, and buy two cellular telephones which she carried. Staff at Selena Etc. complained that Saldívar was always [...] "nice" [...] when Selena was around; when she was not Saldívar treated everyone terribly. In December 1994, the boutiques began to suffer. The company's bank accounts lacked sufficient funds to <b>pay</b> <b>bills.</b> Staff levels at both stores had been reduced from thirty-eight to fourteen employees, mainly because Saldívar fired those she did not like. The remaining employees began complaining to Selena about Saldívar, but Selena did not believe her friend would hurt her or her business. The employees then began to take their concerns to Quintanilla, Jr. who warned Selena that Saldívar might be a dangerous person. Selena did not believe Saldívar would turn on her; her father had a habit of distrusting people.|$|E

500|$|When Tillman {{spoke at}} Bennettsville, {{he was not}} widely known except as the brother of Congressman George Tillman. Ben Tillman called for the state {{government}} to do more for farmers, and blamed politicians and lawyers in the pay of financial interests for agricultural problems, including the crop lien system that left many farmers struggling to <b>pay</b> <b>bills.</b> He assailed his listeners for letting themselves be duped by hostile interests, and told of the farmer who {{was elected to the}} legislature, only to be dazzled and seduced by the elite. According to an account the next day in the Columbia Daily Register, Tillman's speech [...] "electrified the assembly and was the sensation of the meeting". Lindsey Perkins, in his journal article on Tillman's oratory, wrote that [...] "Tillman's losses in the agricultural depression of 1883–1898 forced him to begin thinking and planning economic reforms. The result was Bennettsville." [...] Tillman later stated that he began his advocacy after a few bad years in the early 1880s forced him to sell some of his land. The speech was printed in several newspapers, and Tillman began to receive more invitations to speak. According to Zach McGhee in his 1906 article on Tillman, [...] "from that day to this he has been the most conspicuous figure in South Carolina".|$|E
500|$|During {{the writing}} process, Price and Seaman were unsure of whom to include as the villain in the plot. They wrote scripts that had either Jessica Rabbit or Baby Herman as the villain, {{but they made}} their final {{decision}} with newly created character Judge Doom. Doom {{was supposed to have}} an animated vulture sit on his shoulder, but this was deleted due to the technical challenges this posed. Doom would also have a suitcase of 12 small animated kangaroos that act as a jury, by having their joeys pop out of their pouches, each with letters, when put together would spell YOU ARE GUILTY. This was also cut for budget and technical reasons. Doom's five-man [...] "Weasel Gang" [...] (Stupid, Smart Ass, Greasy, Wheezy and Psycho) satirizes the Seven Dwarfs (Doc, Grumpy, Happy, Sleepy, Bashful, Sneezy and Dopey) who appeared in Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937). There were originally seven weasels to mimic the dwarf's complement, but eventually two of them, Slimey and Slezey, were written out of the script. Further references included The [...] "Ink and Paint Club" [...] resembling the Harlem Cotton Club, while Zemeckis compared Judge Doom's invention of [...] "The Dip" [...] to eliminate all the Toons as Hitler's Final Solution. Doom was originally the hunter who [...] killed Bambi's Mother, but Disney objected to the idea. Benny the Cab was first conceived to be a Volkswagen Beetle before being changed to a Taxicab. Ideas originally conceived for the story also included a sequence set at Marvin Acme's funeral, whose attendees included Eddie, Foghorn Leghorn, Mickey Mouse, Minnie Mouse, Tom and Jerry, Heckle and Jeckle, Chip n' Dale, Mighty Mouse, Superman, Popeye, Olive Oyl, Bluto, Clarabelle Cow, and The Seven Dwarfs in cameo appearances. However, the scene was cut for pacing reasons and never made it past the storyboard stage. Before finally agreeing on Who Framed Roger Rabbit as the film's title, working titles included Murder in Toontown, Toons, Dead Toons Don't <b>Pay</b> <b>Bills,</b> The Toontown Trial, Trouble in Toontown, and Eddie Goes to Toontown.|$|E
