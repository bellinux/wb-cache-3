The 0. 2 % <b>proof</b> <b>stress</b> and elongation were discussed based on the theory of dislocation mechanism and the observation of microstructures.

40|$|Magnesium and its alloys exhibit {{not only}} elastic and plastic {{behaviour}} but also anelastic behaviour upon loading. The presence of anelastic strain poses {{a challenge to}} the measurement of <b>proof</b> <b>stress</b> using conventional methods. As such, the <b>proof</b> <b>stress</b> measurement methods specified by American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) and International Standards Organization (ISO) are reviewed and applied to three common die-cast magnesium alloys including AE 44, AM 60 and AZ 91. The methods in the standards give inconsistent results due largely to the inherent anelastic behaviour of these alloys.

Both thermal cycling and isothermal exposure reduced 0. 2 % <b>proof</b> <b>stress,</b> tensile strength and micro Vickers hardness to one third through a half of those of the original SiCp/Al 6061 composites and mainly due to the softening of the matrix. In addition, the thermal cycling caused interfacial debonding between coarse particles and matrix in the SiCp/Al, which was confirmed from the observation of fracture morphology. The reduction in 0. 2 % <b>proof</b> <b>stress</b> and tensile strength increased with increasing SiC particle volume fraction.

40|$|A resume {{is given}} of an {{investigation}} of the influence of plastic deformation and of annealing temperature on the tensile and shear elastic properties of high strength nonferrous metals and stainless steels in the form of rods and tubes. The data were obtained from earlier technical reports and notes, and from unpublished work in this investigation. There are also included data obtained from published and unpublished work performed on an independent investigation. The rod materials, namely, nickel, monel, inconel, copper, 13 : 2 Cr-Ni steel, and 18 : 8 Cr-Ni steel, were tested in tension; 18 : 8 Cr-Ni steel tubes were tested in shear, and nickel, monel, aluminum-monel, and Inconel tubes were tested in both tension and shear. There are first described experiments on the relationship between hysteresis and creep, as obtained with repeated cyclic stressing of annealed stainless steel specimens over a constant load range. These tests, which preceded the measurements of elastic properties, assisted in devising the loading time schedule used in such measurements. From corrected stress-set curves are derived the five <b>proof</b> <b>stresses</b> used as indices of elastic or yield strength. From corrected stress-strain curves are derived the secant modulus and its variation with stress. The relationship between the forms of the stress-set and stress-strain curves and the values of the properties derived is discussed. Curves of variation of <b>proof</b> <b>stress</b> and modulus with prior extension, as obtained with single rod specimens, consist in wavelike basic curves with superposed oscillations due to differences of rest interval and extension spacing; the effects of these differences are studied. Oscillations of <b>proof</b> <b>stress</b> and modulus are generally opposite in manner. The use of a series of tubular specimens corresponding to different amounts of prior extension of cold reduction gave curves almost devoid of oscillation since the effects of variation of rest interval and extension spacing were removed. Comparison is also obtained between the variation of the several properties, as measured in tension and in shear. The rise of <b>proof</b> <b>stress</b> with extension is studied, and the work-hardening rates of the various metals evaluated. The ratio between the tensile and shear <b>proof</b> <b>stresses</b> for the various annealed and cold-worked tubular metals is likewise calculated. The influence of annealing or tempering temperature on the <b>proof</b> <b>stresses</b> and moduli for the cold-worked metals and for air-hardened 13 : 2 Cr-Ni steel is investigated. An improvement of elastic strength generally is obtained, without important loss of yield strength, by annealing at suitable temperature. The variation of the <b>proof</b> <b>stress</b> and modulus of elasticity with plastic deformation or annealing temperature is explained in terms of the relative dominance of three important factors: namely, (a) internal stress, (b) lattice-expansion or work-hardening, and (c) crystal reorientation.

40|$|In {{the present}} work, a {{comparative}} study of the shape memory and thermo mechanical behavior of four alloys containing different amount of samarium {{have been carried out}} at a strain rate of 0. 08 x 10 - 6 s- 1. After hot rolling, annealing and solution treatment, the alloy samples were tensile deformed at room temperature from 1 % to 5 % and were then recovered at 600 °C for 20 minutes repeatedly for six times to complete six training cycles. It has been found that the addition of samarium strengthens the austenitic matrix, increases the c/a ratio and reduces the grain size. It has been noticed that the addition of samarium (0. 64 wt. %) improves the shape memory effect when the alloys were strained from 1 % to 5 %. This improvement in shape memory effect presumably can be regarded as the increase in strength, increase in c/a ratio and absence of ά (martensite). It has been further noticed that when samarium contents are gradually reduced from 0. 64 % to 0. 21 % the shape memory effect decreases. The decrease in shape memory effect by the decrease in samarium contents can be attributed to decrease in strength, decrease in c/a ratio and formation of ά (martensite). It has been further noticed that the shape memory effect decreases with the increase in amount of strain. It is found that thermo mechanical treatment (training) results in improvement of shape memory effect and has a significant influence on mechanical parameters like <b>proof</b> <b>stress</b> (σ 0. 002), critical stress (σ 0. 0008) and strain hardening exponent.

40|$|The {{quantitative}} {{correlation between}} strength, ductility and precipitate microstructures {{in the vicinity}} of grain boundaries with precipitate free zones (PFZ) was evaluated for Al-Zn-Mg(-Ag, Cu) alloys using transmission electron microscopy (TEM), three-dimensional atom probe (3 DAP) and tensile test. In the Al-Zn-Mg ternary and Cu-added alloys aged at 433 K, larger widths of PFZ were observed by TEM and resulted in lower elongations to fracture, independent of the size of grain boundary precipitates. On the other hand, the elongation of the Ag-added alloy was higher, if compared at the same levels of <b>proof</b> <b>stress,</b> due to the much smaller width of PFZ. This strongly suggests that PFZ is harmful to fracture of the investigated alloys. From a 3 DAP analysis, furthermore, it was revealed that Ag and Cu atoms are incorporated in the nanoclusters from the initial stage of aging. In this work, the elongation was well correlated to the width of PFZ, size of grain boundary precipitates and the level of <b>proof</b> <b>stress,</b> enabling to predict ductility of the alloys from known microstructural factors...|$|R
30|$|High tensile {{strength}} steel {{was used for}} the reinforcing bars in the control beams and the core of the other groups. Tests showed that the <b>proof</b> <b>stress</b> and {{tensile strength}} for this type of steel are 640 and 720  MPa respectively. Mild steel {{was used for the}} stirrups of the control beams. This mild steel had nominal yield stress of 240  MPa. Tensile test was not performed on this type of steel.|$|R
