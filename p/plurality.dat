5|$|Compounding in Khmer is {{a common}} derivational process that takes two forms, {{coordinate}} compounds and repetitive compounds. Coordinate compounds join two unbound morphemes (independent words) of similar meaning to form a compound signifying a concept more general than either word alone. Coordinate compounds join either two nouns or two verbs. Repetitive compounds, {{one of the most}} productive derivational features of Khmer, use reduplication of an entire word to derive words whose meaning will depend on the class of the reduplicated word. A repetitive compound of a noun indicates <b>plurality</b> or generality while that of an adjectival verb could mean either an intensification or <b>plurality.</b>|$|E

5|$|Roughly speaking, Mongolian {{has eight}} cases: {{nominative}} (unmarked), genitive, dative, accusative, ablative, instrumental, comitative and directional. If a direct object is definite, it {{must take the}} accusative, while it must take the nominative if it is unspecific. In addition to case, a number of postpositions exist that usually govern genitive, ablative, or comitative case or a form of the nominative that has sometimes -Vn either for lexical historical reasons or analogy (thus maybe becoming an attributive case suffix). Nouns can take reflexive-possessive clitics indicating that the marked noun is possessed by {{the subject of the}} sentence: bi najz(-)aa avarsan I friend- save- 'I saved my friend'. However, there are also somewhat noun-like adjectives to which case suffixes seemingly cannot be attached directly unless there is ellipsis. <b>Plurality</b> may be left unmarked, but there are overt <b>plurality</b> markers, some of which are restricted to humans. A noun that is modified by a numeral usually does not take any plural affix.|$|E

5|$|The Upanishadic age was {{characterized}} by a pluralism of worldviews. While some Upanishads have been deemed 'monistic', others, including the Katha Upanishad, are dualistic. The Maitri {{is one of the}} Upanishads that inclines more toward dualism, thus grounding classical Samkhya and Yoga schools of Hinduism, in contrast to the non-dualistic Upanishads at the foundation of its Vedanta school. They contain a <b>plurality</b> of ideas.|$|E

5|$|The act {{has also}} faced {{challenges}} and opposition. In 2009, Senator Ted Kennedy died, {{and the resultant}} special election cost the Democrats their 60-seat filibuster-proof Senate majority before the ACA had been fully passed by Congress. The Supreme Court ruled 5 to 4 in 2012 that states could choose {{not to participate in}} the ACA's Medicaid expansion, although it upheld the law as a whole. The federal health exchange, HealthCare.gov, initially faced major technical problems during its rollout in 2013. In 2017, a unified Republican government failed to pass several different partial repeals of the ACA. The law spent several years opposed by a slim <b>plurality</b> of Americans polled, although its provisions were generally more popular than the law as a whole, and the law gained <b>plurality</b> support by 2017.|$|E

This was the only rematch of the 2012-13 college bowl season.|$|E

With the remaining seats won by other parties, the PC party only had a <b>plurality</b> in the House of Commons, but the margin was sufficient to make John Diefenbaker Canada's first Tory Prime Minister since 1935.|$|E
