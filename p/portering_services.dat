50|$|The lack {{of desire}} for a common room (it was very rarely used) {{and the need for}} a bar led to the {{construction}} of a new building housing the <b>portering</b> <b>service</b> and the shop and the complete refurbishment of the Halifax Court Centre Building into JJ's.

50|$|The {{campaign}} for full status was delayed {{primarily because of}} the insistence of the Dean of Halifax Court, Mark Evans and the JCRC that Halifax Court should have all the facilities of a campus college. At that time, the Halifax Court Centre Building (now JJ's) consisted of a central common room (unlicensed though clearly built with the concept of housing a bar), the only part-time <b>portering</b> <b>service</b> (Geoff the <b>porter)</b> at the university (every other college had 24hr portering at that time), an adjacent laundry room accessed from the outside (now the lounge area of JJ's), and a small convenience store accessed from the outside (now the pizzeria).

40|$|Applications like robots {{which are}} {{employed}} for shopping, <b>porter</b> <b>services,</b> assistive robotics, etc., require a robot to continuously follow a human or another robot. This paper presents a mobile robot following another tele-operated mobile robot {{based on a}} PID (Proportional–Integral-Differential) controller. Here, we use two differential wheel drive robots; one is a master robot {{and the other is}} a follower robot. The master robot is manually controlled and the follower robot is programmed to follow the master robot. For the master robot, a Bluetooth module receives the user’s command from an android application which is processed by the master robot’s controller, which is used to move the robot. The follower robot receives the image from the Kinect sensor mounted on it and recognizes the master robot. The follower robot identifies the x, y positions by employing the camera and the depth by using the Kinect depth sensor. By identifying the x, y, and z locations of the master robot, the follower robot finds the angle and distance between the master and follower robot, which is given as the error term of a PID controller. Using this, the follower robot follows the master robot. A PID controller is based on feedback and tries to minimize the error. Experiments are conducted for two indigenously developed robots; one depicting a humanoid and the other a small mobile robot. It was observed that the follower robot was easily able to follow the master robot using well-tuned PID parameters...|$|R
