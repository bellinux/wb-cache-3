2500|$|Protons {{may also}} be used in {{radiosurgery}} in a procedure called <b>Proton</b> <b>Beam</b> <b>Therapy</b> (PBT) or proton therapy. Protons are extracted from proton donor materials by a medical synchrotron or cyclotron, and accelerated in successive transits through a circular, evacuated conduit or cavity, using powerful magnets to shape their path, until they reach the energy required to just traverse a human body, usually about 200MeV. They are then released toward the region to be treated in the patient's body, the irradiation target. In some machines, which deliver protons of only a specific energy, a custom mask made of plastic is interposed between the beam source and the patient to adjust the beam energy to provide the appropriate degree of penetration. The phenomenon of the Bragg peak of ejected protons gives proton therapy advantages over other forms of radiation, {{since most of the}} proton's energy is deposited within a limited distance, so tissue beyond this range (and to some extent also tissue inside this range) is spared from the effects of radiation. This property of protons, which has been called the [...] "depth charge effect" [...] by analogy to the explosive weapons used in anti-submarine warfare, allows for conformal dose distributions to be created around even very irregularly shaped targets, and for higher doses to targets surrounded or backstopped by radiation-sensitive structures such as the optic chiasm or brainstem. The development of [...] "intensity modulated" [...] techniques allowed similar conformities to be attained using linear accelerator radiosurgery.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Background. The {{relative}} importance of surgery within multimodality regimens commonly used to treat advanced sinonasal malignancies remains unknown. Methods. One hundred two patients with locally advanced sinonasal cancers treated with <b>proton</b> <b>beam</b> radiation <b>therapy</b> with or without surgery were retrospectively reviewed. Extent of surgery and outcome variables of local control, disease-free sur-vival, and overall survival were evaluated. Patterns of failure were also assessed. Results. Extent of surgery correlated with disease-free survival and overall survival rates. Local control rate, however, was inde-pendent {{of the degree of}} surgical resection achieved. Overall, treatment failure most commonly resulted from distant metastases, which occurred in 30 % of patients and also correlated with extent of surgical resection. Tumor type-specific outcomes reveal differ-ences associated with the extent of surgery achieved. Conclusion. High-dose radiotherapy with <b>proton</b> <b>beam</b> resulted in excellent local control rates in patients with locally advanced sinonasal cancer, irrespective of the extent of sur-gery.

50|$|Physicians base the {{decision}} to use surgery or proton therapy (or any radiation therapy) on the tumor type, stage, and location. In some instances, surgery is superior (e.g. cutaneous melanoma), in some instances radiation is superior (e.g., skull base chondrosarcoma), and in some instances they are comparable (e.g., prostate cancer). In some instances, they are used together (e.g., rectal cancer or early stage breast cancer). The benefit of external beam proton radiation lies in the dosimetric difference from external beam X-ray radiation and brachytherapy in cases where the use of radiation therapy is already indicated, rather than as a direct competition with surgery. However, in the case of prostate cancer, the most common indication for <b>proton</b> <b>beam</b> <b>therapy,</b> no clinical study directly comparing proton therapy to surgery, brachytherapy, or other treatments has shown any clinical benefit for <b>proton</b> <b>beam</b> <b>therapy.</b> Indeed, the largest study to date showed that IMRT compared with proton therapy was associated with less gastrointestinal morbidity.|$|E

40|$|In the {{treatment}} of tumors near critical structures, {{it is necessary to}} confine as much of the dose as possible to {{the treatment}} region, thus protecting nearby sensitive organs. <b>Proton</b> <b>beams</b> have beam used for this type of treatment because they can be confined well in the lateral direction.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} is to {{evaluate}} the reliability of the ultrasonographic and angiographic follow-up of primary choroidal malignant melanoma (PCMM) after <b>proton</b> <b>beam</b> irradiation <b>therapy</b> in a series of 14 patients. All patients underwent standardized A and B scan ultrasonography, fluorescein and indocyanine green videoangiography (FV, ICGV) before and after treatment with <b>proton</b> <b>beam</b> irradiation. The follow-up was carried out at 1, 3, 5, 8 months and then every 6 months. The mean follow-up was 26 months (range 6 - 46 months). The thickness of the tumors was demonstrated to be decreased and the internal reflectivity to be enhanced in 12 out of 14 cases from 8 months after treatment till the end of the follow-up period. In 2 eyes which were enucleated 5 months after treatment, histopathology confirmed that medium-low internal reflectivity corresponded to several areas of high cellularity and cellular mitosis. FV and ICGV were impossible because of opacities of dioptric media in 2 cases. From 8 months after treatment till the end of the follow-up period, in all the examined patients, FV demonstrated large hypofluorescent zones of the lesions which represented the destruction of the vascular tree of the tumor. From 8 months after treatment till the end of the follow-up period, ICGV demonstrated hypofluorescence of the lesions in 8 cases; mild hyperfluorescence and zones of colorant staining were present in late angiograms in 2 cases.

Methods: Children with retinoblastoma who were treated with chemotherapy and focal treatment such as brachytherapy and thermotherapy but showed no response or developed recurrences later received PBRT. The PBRT strategy was designed to concentrate the radiation energy to the retinoblastoma and spare the surrounding healthy tissue or organs. Results: There were three patients who received PBRT. The first patient received PBRT because of an initial lack of tumor regression with chemotherapy and brachytherapy. This patient showed regression after PBRT. The second patient who developed recurrence of retinoblastoma as diffuse infiltrating subretinal seeding was taken PBRT. After complete regression, there was recurrence of tumor and the eye was enucleated. The third patient had unilateral extensively advanced retinoblastoma. Initial chemotherapy failed and tumor recurred. The tumor responded to PBRT and regressed significantly. However, the eye developed sudden multiple recurrences, {{so we had to}} perform enucleation.
