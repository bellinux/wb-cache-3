50|$|A {{stuffing}} box of a sailboat {{will have a}} stern tube that's slightly bigger than the prop shaft. It will also have <b>packing</b> <b>nut</b> threads or a gland nut. The packing is inside the gland nut and creates the seal. The shaft is wrapped by the packing {{and put in the}} gland nut. Through tightening it onto the stern tube, the packing is compressed, creating a seal against the shaft. Creating a proper plunger alignment is critical for correct flow and a long wear life. Stuffing box components are of stainless steel, brass or other application-specific materials.|$|E
50|$|The stem {{serves as}} a {{connector}} from the actuator {{to the inside of}} the valve and transmits this actuation force. Stems are either smooth for actuator controlled valves or threaded for manual valves. The smooth stems are surrounded by packing material to prevent leaking material from the valve. This packing is a wearable material and will have to be replaced during maintenance. With a smooth stem the ends are threaded to allow connection to the plug and the actuator. The stem must not only withstand a large amount of compression force during valve closure, but also have high tensile strength during valve opening. In addition, the stem must be very straight, or have low run out, in order to ensure good valve closure. This minimum run out also minimizes wear of the packing contained in the bonnet, which provides the seal against leakage. The stem may be provided with a shroud over the <b>packing</b> <b>nut</b> to prevent foreign bodies entering the packing material, which would accelerate wear.|$|E

40|$|Butterfly valves {{are mostly}} used in various {{industries}} such as oil and gas plant. This valve operates with rotating motion using pneumatic system. Rotating actuator turns the disc either parallel or perpendicular to the flow. When the valve is fully open, the disc is rotated a quarter turn so that it allows free passage of the fluid and when fully closed, the disc rotated a quarter turns to block the fluid. The primary failure modes for valves are the valve leaks to environment through flanges, seals on the valve body, valve stem packing not properly protected, over tightened <b>packing</b> <b>nuts,</b> the valve cracks and leaks over the seat. To identify the failure of valve Failure Mode and Effects Analysis has been chosen. FMEA is the one of technique to perform failure analysis. It involves reviewing as many components to identify failure modes, and their causes and effects. For each component, the failure modes and their resulting effects {{on the rest of}} the system are recorded in a specific FMEA form. Risk priority number, severity, detection, occurrence are the factor determined in this studies. Risk priority number helps to find out the highest hazardous activities which need more attention than the other activity. The highest score of risk priority number in this research is seat. Action plan was proposed to reduce the risk priority number and so that potential failures also will be reduced...|$|R

40|$|Performance of air {{operated}} valves {{is a major}} maintenance concern in process industries. Anecdotal information indicates that reliability of some high maintenance valves has been improved by using an ion deposition process to achieve engineered surfaces on selected components. This project compared friction for various surface treatments of selected valve components. Results indicate valve performance may be slightly more consistent when an engineered surface is applied in the valve packing area; however surface treatment in this area {{does not appear to}} have a dominant affect on reducing valve friction. Results indicate a linear relation between stem friction and torque applied to <b>packing</b> flange <b>nuts,</b> and even after a valve is in service, controlled packing adjustments can be made without significantly changing valve stroke time...|$|R
40|$|A {{literature}} review {{was conducted to}} determine the type, extent and severity of corrosion found in the 10 - and 14 -ton mild steel depleted UF{sub 6 } storage cylinders. Also discussed in this review is corrosion found in the valves and plugs used in the cylinders. Corrosion of the cylinders is a gradual process which occurs slowly over time. Understanding corrosion of the cylinders is an important concern for long term storage of the UF{sub 6 } in the cylinder yards, {{as well as the}} final disposition of the depleted UF{sub 6 } tails inventory in the future. The following conclusions are made from the {{literature review}}: (1) The general external corrosion rate of the cylinders is about 1 to 2 mils per year (1 mil = 0. 001 {double_prime}). The highest general external corrosion rate was over 5 mpy on the 48 G type cylinders. (2) General internal corrosion from the depleted UF{sub 6 } is negligible under normal storage conditions. Crevice corrosion can occur at the cylinder/saddle interface from the retention of water in this area. Crevice corrosion can occur at the cylinder/skirt interface on the older skirted cylinders {{due to the lack of}} water drainage in this area. Crevice corrosion can occur on cylinders that have been in ground contact. Crevice corrosion and galvanic corrosion can occur where the stainless steel I. D. nameplates are attached to the cylinder. The <b>packing</b> <b>nuts</b> on the bronze one-inch valves used in the cylinders are susceptible to stress corrosion cracking (SCC). Mechanical damage from routine handling can lead to a breach in a cylinder with subsequent accelerated corrosion of the mild steel due to attack from HF and other UF{sub 6 } hydrolysis by-products...|$|R

40|$|What role does {{side-chain}} packing play {{in protein}} stability and structure? To address this question, we compare a lattice model with side chains (SCM) to a linear lattice model without side chains (LCM). Self-avoiding configurations are enumerated in 2 and 3 dimensions exhaustively for short chains and by Monte Carlo sampling for chains up to 50 main-chain monomers long. This comparison shows that (1) side-chain {{degrees of freedom}} increase the entropy of open conformations, but side-chain steric exclusion decreases the entropy of compact conformations, thus producing a substantial entropy that opposes folding; (2) there is side-chain "freezing" or ordering, i. e., a sharp decrease in entropy, near maximum compactness; and (3) {{the different types of}} contacts among side chains (s) and main-chain elements (m) have different frequencies, and the frequencies have different dependencies on compactness. mm contacts contribute significantly only at high densities, suggesting that main-chain hydrogen bonding in proteins may be promoted by compactness. The distributions of mm, ms, and ss contacts in compact SCM configurations are similar to the distributions in protein structures in the Brookhaven Protein Data Bank. We propose that packing in proteins is more like the <b>packing</b> of <b>nuts</b> and bolts in a jar than like the pairwise matching of jigsaw puzzle pieces...|$|R
40|$|High {{moisture}} content, relative humidity, {{temperature and}} environment rich in oxygen (O₂) {{are the main}} factors for tree nuts to get infected by fungi and so aflatoxins (AFLs) contaminated. During storage and commercialization dry Brazil <b>nuts</b> <b>packs</b> need to maintain their safety and quality. Modified atmospheres in storage (macro-environment) and packaging (micro-environment) {{have been used to}} prolong food shelf life by reducing O₂ concentration with inhibitory gases or, more recently, by adding O₂ absorber pads. This work reports the application of O₂ atmosphere reducing methods on stored shelled Brazil <b>nut</b> <b>packs</b> aiming fungi and AFL degradation as well as hygienic conditions improvements. The methods applied were: (a) ozone - O₃, (b) carbon dioxide - CO₂ and (c) O₂ absorber pads with and without vacuum. Nuts were submitted to microbiological tests (fungi, aflatoxigenic strains, yeast and bacteria), moisture content and AFLs analysis. From all O₂ reducing atmosphere evaluated, the best performance was obtained with O₃. A reduction on fungi growth (1. 8 x 104 cfu. g- 1 to 2. 6 x 10 cfu. g- 1) and yeast destruction after the first month of storage were registered. Also O₃ was the only nut treatment that was able to degrade AFLs. None of the spiked (AFLs: 15 ppb) nut samples O₃ treated had AFLs detected up to the LOQ of the method (0. 36 μg. kg- 1 for AFB 1 +AFB 2 +AFG 1 +AFG 2) i. e., much lower than the allowed by the European Union regulation (MRL: 4 and 2 ppb for total and AFB 1, respectively), thus producing safer nuts. All other treatments stabilized and/or inhibited microorganisms growth. Add CO₂ and O₂ pads played an important role on nut quality. Further study will be carried out in order to adjust O₃ concentration and application conditions for longer period of storage...|$|R
25|$|A second {{explosion}} at the Park Kultury station followed at approximately 8:38am, caused by another female, {{who at the}} time of the first explosion was riding another train from Yugo-Zapadnaya towards Ulitsa Podbelskogo station in the same direction as the first train. At the time of first explosion, the second train had stopped in the tunnel between Frunzenskaya and Park Kultury stations. It was announced over the speakers that due to technical problems, the train would have to unload the passengers at the next stop. About 40 minutes later, the train reached the station, and once its doors opened, the second female suspect detonated the second explosion, killing fourteen commuters. Panic included stampedes at both stations, as commuters attempted to escape. The second attack was carried out by a dark-haired woman with the equivalent of 2kg of TNT strapped to her waist. Both bombs were <b>packed</b> with metal <b>nuts,</b> bolts and screws, to increase the destructive impact of the blasts.|$|R
40|$|Survival of Salmonella senftenberg 775 W, S. anatum, and S. typhimurium during {{exposure}} to currently practiced, {{as well as}} abusive, pecan processing and storage conditions was studied. Thermal treatments normally carried out during the processing of pecans are inadequate to consistently destory salmonellae in highly contaminated inshell <b>nuts.</b> Pecan <b>nut</b> <b>packing</b> tissue was toxic to salmonellae, thus affording some protection against high initial contamination and subsequent survival of the organisms. Examinations of inoculated inshell pecans stored at - 18, - 7, 5, and 21 C for up to 32 weeks revealed that the extent of survival was inversely correlated to the storage temperature. S. senftenberg 775 W and S. anatum were not detectable on inshell nuts after 16 weeks of storage at 21 C. Little decrease in viable population of the three species was noted on inoculated pecan halves stored at - 18, - 7, and 5 C for 32 weeks. Due to organoleptic quality deterioration in pecan nutmeats at elevated temperatures, sterilization methods other than thermal treatment appear to be required {{for the elimination of}} viable salmonellae from pecan nuts...|$|R
40|$|This work {{reports the}} {{application}} of oxygen-(O 2 -) reducing atmosphere methods on stored shelled Brazil nut (Bertholletia excelsa H. B.

The methods applied were (a) ozone: O 3, (b) carbon dioxide: CO 2, and (c) O 2 absorber pads with and without vacuum. From all modified atmospheres evaluated, the best performance was obtained with O 3, either with or without vacuum. It was the only nut treatment that was able to degrade aflatoxins. None of the spiked (AFLs: 15 [*]μg·kg− 1) nut samples O 3 - treated had aflatoxins detected up to the LC-MS/MS method LOQ (0. 36 [*]μg·kg− 1 for total AFLs), thus producing safer nuts. Also it kept the fatty acid oxidation indicator—malondialdehyde stable and improved the sensory attributes for consumer acceptance. In addition, the destruction of fungi and yeast was observed since the O 3 application (from 1. 8 × 104 [*]cfu/g to NG = no growth).
