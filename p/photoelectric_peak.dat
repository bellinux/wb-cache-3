40|$|Nuclear {{radiation}} detectors with {{volumes of}} approximately 1 cu cm was fabricated from single crystals of germanium-silicon alloy containing {{as much as}} 20 weight percent germanium. The properties of these detectors were investigated and will be discussed. Tests reveal that the gamma ray <b>photoelectric</b> <b>peak</b> efficiency of an alloy detector with only 12 weight percent germanium is approximately 4 times that of a silicon detector of equal volume. The room temperature roomure {{appears to be a}} good possibility. Storage for long periods at room temperature does not seem to adversely affect these devices. The results of preliminary radiation damage experiments suggest that the alloy detectors possess a radiation damage resistance far greater than that of silicon...|$|E
40|$|The galloaluminophosphate oxynitrides 'AlGaPON' are {{phosphates}} {{in which}} oxygen is substituted by nitrogen, by temperature-programmed activation under ammonia. By varying {{the time of}} nitridation at 750 degrees C, Sour oxynitrides with variable nitrogen contents were obtained. They were studied by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and compared to the oxide precursor. Care was taken to demonstrate that with the Mg anode Ga Auger and <b>photoelectric</b> <b>peak</b> superposition did not prevent a quantitative approach of the 'AlGaPON' surface composition. This study shows that the oxygen/nitrogen substitution occurs preferentially around phosphorous and gallium atoms rather than around aluminium atoms. The good con elation between surface and bulk nitrogen content suggests a homogeneous nitridation. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science Limited. All rights reserved...|$|E
40|$|The {{dissertation}} {{is focused}} on composite scintillating materials for gamma-ray and fast neutron spectroscopy. The inorganic-organic composite scintillators have been successfully fabricated and investigated. By leveraging the virtues of inorganics' high stopping power and plastics' ease of fabrication, the low cost composites are potentially serving {{as a candidate for}} the next generation high energy radiation detection materials. New polymer matrix and coupled fluors are developed to obtain plastic scintillating materials, where efficient Foster Resonance Energy Transfer (FRET) is fulfilled. This material possesses fast response time and good processibility, and the best light yield is over 5 times than that of commercial available plastic scintillators. Gamma-ray and neutron sensitizers are synthesized and investigated, including metal oxide nanocrystals and organometallics. These sensitizers are soluble in organic solvent, satisfying photophysical requirements for efficient scintillation, and are readily being incorporated into composites. Subsequently, a surface-catalyzed polymerization approach is proposed to fabricate bulk composites via UV curing. The composites are highly transparent at high loading of nanocrystals. Composites scintillators are prepared loaded with different sensitizers and different fluors. <b>Photoelectric</b> <b>peak</b> for Cs- 137 gamma was obtained from these samples with an energy resolution of 10 %, suggesting potential use of these composites for high energy radiation detection...|$|E
30|$|The {{apparent}} magnitude scale, which we apply {{in the previous}} simulations, is adapted to {{the sensitivity of the}} human visual system. For these experiments, we have used V-filtered raw images, because the formal <b>photoelectric</b> V <b>peak</b> (around 540 nm) is closest to the peak of the human eye’s (dark-adapted) detection efficiency. The images have not been preprocessed in order to show the robustness of the proposed algorithm.|$|R
40|$|The {{field of}} bone {{densitometry}} has grown rapidly, {{particularly in the}} past 15 years. Many techniques are now available from which the physician may choose. The focus {{of this research is}} on Dual-Energy X-Ray Absorptiometry (DXA) and Quantitative Computed Tomography (QCT). The basic principle involving DXA is the ability to quantify the degree of attenuation of an energy beam after passage through bone and soft tissue. The X-ray tubes used with DXA narrow the energy beam to produce two distinct <b>photoelectric</b> <b>peaks</b> necessary to separate bone from soft tissue. Although QCT is a photon absorptiometric technique like DXA, it is unique in that it provides a three-dimensional image, which makes possible a direct measurement of density, and a spatial separation of trabecular from cortical bone. In this paper, a rabbit and pig femur were scanned using a DXA and QCT scanner. The purpose was to achieve matching results in g/cm 2 from each scanner. Similar sections of interest were taken during each scan for calculation. The QCT grayscale values were then put into a series of formulas to replicate DXA results...|$|R
40|$|The {{gamma ray}} {{spectrum}} resolution from a 241 Am-Be source-based prompt gamma ray activation analysis set-up {{has been observed}} to increase in the energy region of interest with enclosing the NaI detector in a proper neutron and gamma ray shield. We have investigated the tact that the peak resolution of prompt gamma rays {{in the region of}} interest from the set-up depends on the source activity to the great extent, size and kind of the detector and the geometry of the detector shield. In order to see the role of a detector shield, five kinds of the detector shield were used and finally the proper kind was introduced. Since the detector shield has an important contribution in the reduction of the undesirable and high rate gamma rays coming to the gamma ray detector, a good design of a proper shield enables the elimination of the unwanted events, such as a pulse pile-up. By improving the shielding design, discrete and distinguishable <b>photoelectric</b> <b>peaks</b> in the energy region of interest have been observed in the spectrum of prompt gamma rays...|$|R
40|$|Oriented {{films of}} purple {{membrane}} patches were assembled on solid supports by the biotin/streptavidin molecular recognition technique. The degree of biotin labeling was 0. 58 /bacteriorhodopsin. According to the kinetics of absorption change after flash illumination, the photochemical {{activity of the}} purple membrane was hardly affected by the biotinylation. The three steps of the oriented assembly were visualized by electron microscopy. According to surface plasmon resonance, about 0. 46 ng/mm 2 of streptavidin and 1. 16 ng/mm 2 of biotinylated purple membrane were in the assembled films. The amount of the nonspecifically adsorbed purple membrane, without label, was 0. 44 ng/mm 2. To test the properties of this oriented purple membrane film, a similar assembly procedure was carried out with the bilayer lipid membrane system. The <b>photoelectric</b> voltage <b>peak</b> of the oriented purple membrane was 157. 2 mV, whereas that of nonspecific adsorbed purple membrane was 7. 8 mV. The degree of orientation was calculated to be 81 % theoretically. Further washing experiments suggested that the nonspecific adsorption {{may be attributed to}} both the electrostatic attraction and the hydrophobic interaction...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Peak velocity, {{duration}} {{and accuracy of}} eye movements (saccade, vergence and combined saccade– vergence eye movements) were investigated in fourteen normal children (4. 5 to 12 years of age) and ten normal adults (22 to 44 years of age). Horizontal movements from both eyes were recorded simultaneously by the ocul-ometer, a <b>photoelectric</b> device. <b>Peak</b> velocity of all eye movements, saccades, and vergence (convergence and divergence), attains adult levels {{by the age of}} 4. 5 years and there is no significant change over the age range studied (4. 5 to 44 years). Vergence duration is longer only in young children (below 8 years of age). The reciprocal interaction between saccade and vergence during com-bined movements known in adults, i. e. acceleration of the vergence by the saccade (increase of velocity and decrease of duration) and deceleration of the saccade by the vergence (decrease of velocity and increase of duration) was found to be similar in children. The accuracy of eye movements is good on average for both saccades and vergence by the age of 4. 5 years, and does not change with age; an exception is the variability of saccade amplitude, which is higher in children less than 8 years old. Taken together, the results indicate early maturation of brainstem structures controlling spatio-temporal aspects of saccades, vergence and their interaction...|$|R
40|$|A. cepa peels are {{obtained}} from mature onion bulbs. Because of the continuous need for energy, alternative avenues for producing energy are gaining importance. The motivation {{for this work}} {{is based on an}} urgent need to source energy from readily available waste materials like domestic onion peels. Dye sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) fabricated via doctor blade method and high temperature sintering from waste (onion peels) are investigated for their ability to convert solar to electrical energy. The charge carriers were revealed under phytochemical screening. Functional groups of compounds present in A. cepa peel were analyzed with Fourier transform in infrared (FTIR). The influence of different electrolyte sensitizer is observed on the DSSCs under standard air mass conditions of 1. 5 AM. The microstructure properties of these A. cepa DSSCs were explored using scanning electron microscope with energy dispersive spectroscopy (SEM/EDS), x-ray diffraction and Fluorecence spectroscopy (XRF). The interfacial boundary between A. cepa dye, TiO 2 framework of TiO 2 and indium doped tin oxide (ITO) reveals several prominent anatase and rutile <b>peaks.</b> <b>Photoelectric</b> results, revealed dye-sensitized solar cells with a maximum power output of 126 W and incident photon to conversion energy (IPCE) of 0. 13 %.
