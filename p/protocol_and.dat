5|$|Carpentier was {{an admirer}} of the elegance and wit {{in the work of}} satirical French writers and artists of the eighteenth century, and often {{employed}} grotesques in his descriptions to ridicule the ostentation of colonial aristocracy. Examples include Ti Noel's comparison of wax heads at a barber's shop to white men's heads being served at a banquet, or the portrayal of the decadence of Mademoiselle Floridor, a fourth-rate actress who performs for slaves as an outlet for her desire to act. Carpentier further satirizes the pomp of those in power through a series of details of <b>protocol</b> <b>and</b> ceremony whose cumulative effects ridicule the object of description, {{as is the case with}} Henri Christophe's chambers.|$|E

The delay in declaring the death of Brezhnev was seen by some First World commentators as proof of the ongoing power struggle in the Soviet leadership over who would succeed him.

5|$|Now that Vietnam was unified, {{the center}} of gravity of the country moved further south, {{following}} centuries of southerly migration and conquest, so Gia Long moved the seat of government from Hanoi to Huế. Gia Long rebuilt the old citadel of Phú Xuân into a fortress stronghold. The structure was a square shape of 2.5km per side. A 9m rampart was encased with masonry and protected by protruding bastions, each defended by 36 guns. The exterior and interior were flanked and reinforced by a series of moats. The citadel's defenders included an 800-strong elephant troop. The new palace structure, <b>protocol</b> <b>and</b> court dress were all taken directly from Qing Dynasty styles, and his palace and fortress was intended to be a smaller copy of the Chinese Forbidden City in the 1800s.|$|E
5|$|The Global Climate Coalition (GCC) (1989–2001) was an {{international}} lobbyist group of businesses that opposed action to reduce {{greenhouse gas emissions}} and challenged the science behind global warming.

The GCC was involved {{in opposition to the}} Kyoto <b>Protocol,</b> <b>and</b> played a role in blocking ratification by the United States. The coalition promoted the views of climate skeptics. The GCC dissolved in 2001 after membership declined in the face of improved understanding of the role of greenhouse gases in climate change and of public criticism.|$|E
