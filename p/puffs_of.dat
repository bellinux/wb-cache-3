5|$|Many of {{the special}} effects in A Trip to the Moon, as in {{numerous}} other Méliès films, were created using the substitution splice technique, in which the camera operator stopped filming long enough for something onscreen to be altered, added, or taken away. Méliès carefully spliced the resulting shots together to create apparently magical effects, such as {{the transformation of the}} astronomers' telescopes into stools or the disappearance of the exploding Selenites in <b>puffs</b> <b>of</b> smoke. Other effects were created using theatrical means, such as stage machinery and pyrotechnics. The film also features transitional dissolves.|$|E

25|$|Suddenly, all is dark. The transport's {{headlights}} flicker back on, illuminating walls swarming {{with thousands}} of beetles. Hissing sounds are heard, and riders are blasted with <b>puffs</b> <b>of</b> air. The transport heads {{out of the darkness}} and onto the bridge which spans the pit. The transport stalls for a moment as another oncoming transport can be seen about to cross the bridge, which turns away just before reaching it. The transport then accelerates across the bridge which sways and jostles under its weight. The massive stone face of Mara shoots beams from its eye, attempting to destroy the bridge. The transport makes it safely across then turns sharply to the right.|$|E
25|$|The initial attack {{focused on}} {{extinguishing}} {{the fire in}} the loading dock area, with a secondary effort to search for and evacuate people inside, and prevent the fire from spreading to the showroom and warehouse. Crews entering the showroom reportedly initially encountered clear visibility with only very light <b>puffs</b> <b>of</b> smoke visible near the ceiling {{at the back of the}} showroom. Shortly thereafter, an exterior door was opened near where the fire was raging. Efforts to close the door failed, allowing the fire to enter the showroom. Firefighters were ordered to stretch two hose lines into the showroom to attack the spreading fire; however, the pre-connected hose line from one of the units was too short. This required some firefighters to again exit the building to add additional sections of hose, and left only one small handline to hold back the growing fire. At about this time, fire dispatchers advised the crews on-scene that they had received a 9-1-1 call from an employee who was trapped in the warehouse, which required some firefighters to direct their attention to the rescue. The trapped employee was eventually rescued by firefighters who breached an exterior wall to reach him.|$|E
500|$|Borscht {{is often}} {{associated}} with its role in religious traditions of various denominations (Eastern Orthodox, Greek and Roman Catholic, and Jewish) that are common in Eastern Europe. In East Slavic countries, [...] "memorial borscht" [...] is served as the first course at a post-funeral wake. According to a traditional belief, the soul of the departed either feeds on or is carried up to heaven by <b>puffs</b> <b>of</b> steam rising from bowls of borscht and other hot dishes, such as blini, porridge, boiled potatoes or freshly baked bread. In the region of Polesye, straddling the Belarusian-Ukrainian border, the same steaming-hot dishes, including borscht, are given as an offering to the souls of deceased ancestors during the annual semi-pagan remembrance ceremony known as [...] or Forefathers' Night.|$|E

500|$|The fruit body, {{initially}} {{shaped like}} a puffball, is encased within an outer covering that splits open from the top to form rays. These rays curve down to expose an inner papery spore case, which contains the fertile spore-bearing tissue, the gleba. The fungus is unique among the earthstars in having a spore case that is supported by multiple stalks, and is perforated by several small holes suggestive of its common names salt-shaker earthstar and pepperpot. It is {{the largest of the}} earthstar fungi, and reaches diameters of up to [...] Its spherical spores have elongated warts that create a ridge-like pattern on their surface. The spores are dispersed when falling water hits the outer wall of the spore sac, creating <b>puffs</b> <b>of</b> air that force the spores through the holes.|$|E

2500|$|Brig. Gen. Donald Harvel, board {{president}} of the first investigation into the crash, fingered the [...] "unidentified contrails" [...] during the last 17 seconds of flight as indications of engine troubles. [...] Harvel has become {{a critic of the}} aircraft since his retirement and states that his retirement was placed on hold for two years in order to silence him from speaking publicly about his concerns about the aircraft's safety. [...] The actual causes of the crash may never be known because US military aircraft destroyed the wreckage and black box recorder. [...] Former USAF chief V-22 systems engineer Eric Braganca stated that the V-22's engines normally emit <b>puffs</b> <b>of</b> smoke and the data recorders showed that the engines were operating normally at that time.|$|E

2500|$|Hudson did, however, {{note that}} there were some {{challenges}} during development. One of the difficulties was in deciding how much graphical detail to provide. [...] "Since our games generally have a lot of AI and scripting, numerous character models, and huge environments, we stress the hardware in a very different way than most games," [...] Hudson said. This made it difficult to predict how well the game would run. The game uses the Odyssey Engine, based on the Aurora Engine (previously developed by BioWare for use in Neverwinter Nights) but completely rewritten for Knights of the Old Republic. It was highly detailed for its time: grass waves in the wind, dust blows across Tatooine and <b>puffs</b> <b>of</b> sand rise as the player walks across the seabed.|$|E
2500|$|This method held a {{pre-eminent}} {{position in}} glassforming ever since its introduction {{in the middle}} of the 1st century BC until the late 19th century, and is still widely used nowadays as a glassforming technique, especially for artistic purposes. The process of free-blowing involves the blowing of short <b>puffs</b> <b>of</b> air into a molten portion of glass called a '"gather" [...] which has been spooled at one end of the blowpipe. This has the effect of forming an elastic skin on the interior of the glass blob that matches the exterior skin caused by the removal of heat from the furnace. The glassworker can then quickly inflate the molten glass to a coherent blob and work it into a desired shape.|$|E
2500|$|... 467 performers, each {{wearing one}} of the 5 Olympic colours, created a 20 meter tall ski jumper formation, after the playing of the Italian {{national}} anthem. The choreography showed an animated ski jumper gliding down the take-off slope, flying through the night air and eventually landing safely in perfect form on the ground. <b>Puffs</b> <b>of</b> air {{could be seen as}} the jumper prepared his jump. Performers carrying a blue banner then entered to show the skier gliding down the slope. In flight the figure was lit up by headlamp flashlights in a formation of a ski jumper in peak flight. The ski jumper eventually made a graceful landing on the ground as performers released confetti (to represent a snowplow stop) and cheered as the segment came to a close.|$|E

2500|$|The larynx {{is a major}} (but not the only) {{source of}} sound in speech, {{generating}} sound through the rhythmic opening and closing of the vocal folds. [...] To oscillate, the vocal folds are brought near enough together such that air pressure builds up beneath the larynx. [...] The folds are pushed apart by this increased subglottal pressure, with the inferior part of each fold leading the superior part. Such a wave-like motion causes a transfer of energy from the airflow to the fold tissues. Under the correct conditions, the energy transferred to the tissues {{is large enough to}} overcome losses by dissipation and the oscillation pattern will sustain itself. [...] In essence, sound is generated in the larynx by chopping up a steady flow of air into little <b>puffs</b> <b>of</b> sound waves.|$|E
2500|$|On {{the evening}} of the 23rd, around 18:25, {{steaming}} eastward toward a night anchorage, Chepachets destroyer escort observed anti-aircraft fire over the northern transport area. Underway again off Homonhon Island early the next morning, the destroyer escort received a report of enemy aircraft orbiting over the northern transport area. As she steamed along the convoy's flank, the escort commenced making black smoke at 08:44 to lay a protective screen in anticipation of the enemy's arrival. While the radio crackled with reports of ships under attack, no enemy planes were spotted nearby, only many <b>puffs</b> <b>of</b> [...] "flak" [...] splattering the skies to the westward of the refueling group. With the receipt of a [...] "flash white" [...] at 13:43, the oilers resumed refueling TG 77.2. Willmarth shifted to Samar Island shortly before 17:00 before going to general quarters at 17:06 upon receipt of a [...] "flash red." [...] After waiting for well over an hour for the enemy to make an appearance, the convoy stopped and prepared to anchor for the night.|$|E
2500|$|Originally, the Heartless {{exist within}} an all-encompassing variety, the [...] "Pureblood", who are usually ink-black in color. When defeated, they simply {{disappear}} in <b>puffs</b> <b>of</b> smoke. Before {{the events of}} the first Kingdom Hearts, these Purebloods are typically only encountered in the realm of darkness, although people with a strong will may summon them to the realm of light. While studying the Pureblood Heartless, as a side effect of their research to control the mind through the heart, Xehanort and Ansem's other apprentices devise the means to create artificial [...] "Emblem" [...] Heartless via the corruption of living hearts. They can be easily differentiated from the Purebloods with their more rich coloring and the Heartless insignia on their bodies. Unlike Purebloods, Emblem Heartless release hearts once defeated. However, unless the Keyblade is used to defeat the Heartless, the stolen hearts go to the realm of darkness where they turn into Heartless again. This combined with Maleficent's quest to gather the seven Princesses of Heart by using the forces of darkness have made the Heartless a common sight within the realm of light by {{the events of the}} first Kingdom Hearts.|$|E
