40|$|The aim of {{this study}} is to isolate denitrifying {{bacteria}} utilizing epsilon-caprolactam as the substrate, from a <b>polyacrylonitrile</b> <b>fibre</b> manufactured wastewater treatment system. The aim is also to compare the performance of PAN (polyacrylonitrile) mixed bacteria cultures acclimated to epsilon-caprolactam and isolated pure strain for treating different initial epsilon-caprolactam concentrations from synthetic wastewater under anoxic conditions. The result showed that the PAN mixed bacteria cultures acclimated to epsilon-caprolactam could utilize 1538. 5 mg/l of epsilon-caprolactam as a substrate for denitrification. Sufficient time and about 2200 mg/l of nitrate were necessary for the complete epsilon-caprolactam removal. Paracoccus thiophilus was isolated from the <b>polyacrylonitrile</b> <b>fibre</b> manufactured wastewater treatment system and it could utilize 1722. 5 mg/l of epsilon-caprolactam as a substrate for denitrification. About 3500 mg/l of nitrate was necessary for the complete removal of F-caprolactam. When the initial epsilon-caprolactam concentration was below 784. 3 mg/l, the removal efficiency of epsilon-caprolactam by Paracoccus thiophilus was better than that for the PAN mixed bacteria cultures. The growth of Paracoccus thiophilus was better. However, when the initial epsilon-caprolactam concentration was as high as 1445. 8 mg/l, both the epsilon-caprolactam removal efficiency by Paracoccus thiophilus and Paracoccus thiophilus specific growth rate were similar to the PAN mixed bacteria cultures...|$|E

40|$|Magister Scientiae - MScTo {{improve the}} {{adsorption}} capacity of polyacrylonitrile (PAN) fibres, hydrophilic amidoxime fibres were prepared by subsequent {{conversion of the}} cyano groups to an amidoxime group by reacting with hydroxylamine at 80 °C at an optimum amidoximation time of 2 hrs. The amidoxime fibre was hydrolyzed/alkali treated in a solution of sodium hydroxide to enhance or improve the adsorption properties. This was followed by characterization of the amidoxime and hydrolyzed fibres using Scanning electron microscopy (SEM); Fourier transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR) and exchange capacity (cationic and anionic). SEM showed that the hydrolysis process made the surface of Amidoxime fibre rougher than that of <b>Polyacrylonitrile</b> <b>fibre.</b> FTIR revealed that the hydrolyzed Amidoxime fibres contained conjugated imine (-C=N-) sequences. Functionalization enhanced the sorption of amidoxime fibres by an increase of 20 % in the cationic exchange capacity. This was achieved by the part conversion of the cyano groups into the carboxylic acid groups. The fibres showed faster kinetics largely due the available exchange sites {{on the surface of}} the fibres hence the equilibration was achieved much quicker. South Afric...|$|E

Commercial granular and fibrous activated carbons have been studied {{for the removal of}} heavy metals from aqueous solutions. A wood based activated carbon (AUG WHK) and an activated carbon cloth (KoTHmex TC- 66 C) based on <b>polyacrylonitrile</b> <b>fibre</b> as a precursor, were oxidised for different periods of time using nitric acid, ozone and electrochemical methods to introduce various acidic groups at the surface, thereby, enhancing metal binding capacity. Modified samples were subsequently studied for the specific removal of cadmium and mercury ions in solution and compared with the performance of a commercially available weak acid fibrous exchange material (Ecofil-Deco Ltd. K- 4). Carbonaceous adsorbents were physically characterised by scanning electron microscopy, surface area and porosimetry (using N 2 adsorption at 77 K). There was a decrease in BET surface area betweenu ntreateda nd oxidised samples. Acid and electrochemically oxidised samples were completely stable although there was clear evidence of physical damage to ozone-oxidised carbons. Samples were also chemically characterised by pH titration, direct titration, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and elemental analysis. A significant increase in oxygen content was obtained after oxidation, which increased the total ion exchange capacity by a factor of approximately 3. 3 compared to commercial as-received carbonaceous adsorbents. As the degree of oxidation increased, the point of zero charge was shifted to lower pH values, i. e. from 4. 5 to 3. 6. (Continues [...] .) ...|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe {{adsorption}} {{properties of}} untreated, electrochemically treated and ultra-violet/ozone treated <b>polyacrylonitrile</b> based carbon <b>fibres</b> were investigated using temperature programmed desorption (TPD) {{on a series}} of linear alcohols as probes in order to understand its surface properties. Surface uptake was found to be sensitive to both the surface treatment {{and the nature of the}} adsorbates. Surface coverage increased with increasing alcohol chain due to the increase in their polarizability. It also increased with the level of surface oxygen of the fibres most likely because it facilitates the OH bond dissociation of the alcohol functional group. In addition, the desorption temperature (during TPD) tracked the surface oxygen levels (as determined from XPS O 1 s signal) suggesting increasing in the adsorption energy. The reactions of C 1 –C 4 linear alcohols were also investigated on the surface of the fibre carbon. The main reaction was dehydrogenation to the corresponding aldehydes; the dehydration reaction to olefins was not observed. The dehydrogenation reaction was sensitive to the length of the alky chain. It was highest for methanol (to formaldehyde) and decreased with increasing the carbon number. Overall TPD of linear alcohols was shown to be a promising method for quantifying the level and strength of bonding occurring on carbon fibre surfaces...|$|R

40|$|It {{has been}} {{established}} {{that the most important}} step in the production of carbon <b>fibres</b> from <b>polyacrylonitrile</b> (PAN) precursor <b>fibres</b> is the oxidative thermal treatment applied. During this treatment, physical phenomena and chemical reactions take place accompanied by the shrinkage of the fibres, which has a physical or chemical origin, depending on the nitrile cyclization reactions. The aim of the present study is to establish a correlation between the chemical shrinkage of PAN fibres and the kinetics of cyclization reactions. Based on the isothermal treatment of PAN fibres, we developed a method in order to distinguish between physical and chemical shrinkages. The onset time for the chemical shrinkage follows a relationship with temperature. Chemical shrinkage versus cyclization time data were fitted with the exponential rise to the maximum of the curves. Furthermore, the cyclization kinetics was studied using differential scanning calorimetry and the kinetic parameters determined were identical to those calculated from the chemical shrinkage, demonstrating that the latter {{is directly related to the}} kinetics of the cyclization reactions. It was therefore concluded that according to the method developed to distinguish the physical from the chemical shrinkages: (1) there exists a certain onset time for a given treatment temperature to trigger the chemical shrinkage; (2) cyclization reactions do not start below a limiting temperature of 168 degrees C; (3) at 340 degrees C, the temperature where the cyclization reactions are completed, the maximum shrinkage is 24 %; and (4) the oxidized PAN fibres contain mainly ladder polymer structures with approximately symmetrical sequences connected in angled positions.

40|$|This thesis {{concerns}} the tensile strengths and Young's moduli of carbon fibres {{as they are}} affected by the conditions used to spin the <b>polyacrylonitrile</b> (PAN) precursor <b>fibres.</b> Particular attention has been given to factors affecting the strengths of the fibres since higher strengths would lead to increased impact resistance in carbon fibre reinforced plastics. Impurity particles in the PAN fibres were the main source of flaws in carbon fibres, with samples derived from PAF fibres spun under clean-room conditions having significantly higher strengths. For example clean PAN fibres stretched x 14 in steam gave carbon fibres with average strengths of 3. 0 GN/m 2 after heat-treatments to both 1400 +/-C and 2500 +/-C. When the PAN fibres were spun under normal laboratory conditions however the strength of the fibres after heat-treatment to 1400 +/-C was only 2, 1 GN/m 2 and this decreased to 1. 7 GN/m 2 after treatment to 2500 +/-G. Thus it was found that fls. ws due to impurities caused the average strengths of carbon fibres to decrease after heat-treatments to 2500 +/-C and also to vary with the length of fibre tested. Following the analysis of samples of airborne dust, and experiments involving the deliberate contamination of PAN fibres before conversion to carbon fibres, it was concluded that the flaws were mainly caused by inorganic impurities such as silica, silicates and iron oxide. The flaws were thought to form in two stages (1) by reactions with the fibres leading to the reduction of the oxides and (2) because the impurities promoted the formation of localized randomly-oriented three-dimensional graphite in the fibres. The mechanical properties of the-carbon fibres were also found to be influenced by the amount of hot-stretch applied during the spinning of the PAN fibres and the hot-stretching temperature used...|$|R
