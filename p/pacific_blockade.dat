50|$|<b>Pacific</b> <b>blockade</b> was a term {{invented by}} Hautefeuille, the French writer on {{international}} maritime law, {{to describe a}} blockade exercised by a great power {{for the purpose of}} bringing pressure to bear on a weaker state without actual war.|$|E
50|$|Until 1827, blockades, {{as part of}} {{economic}} warfare, were always {{a part of a}} war. This changed when France, Russia and Britain came to the aid of the Greek rebels against Turkey. They blockaded the Turkish-occupied coast, which led to the battle of Navarino. War was never declared, however, so it is considered the first pacific — i.e. peaceful — blockade. The first truly <b>pacific</b> <b>blockade,</b> involving no shooting at all, was the British blockade of the Republic of New Granada in 1837, established to compel New Granada to release an imprisoned British consul.|$|E
5000|$|The word {{is used in}} {{diplomacy}} {{to signify}} the final terms submitted {{by one of the}} parties in negotiation for settlement of any subject of disagreement. It is accompanied by an intimation as to how refusal will be regarded. English diplomacy has devised the adroit reservation that refusal will be regarded as an [...] "unfriendly act", a phrase which serves as a warning that the consequences of the rupture of negotiations will be considered {{from the point of view}} of forcing a settlement. This opens up a variety of possibilities, such as good offices, mediation, the appointment of a commission of inquiry, arbitration, reprisals, <b>pacific</b> <b>blockade</b> and war.|$|E
50|$|It is usual {{to refer}} to the {{intervention}} of France, England and Russia in Turkish affairs in 1827 as the first occasion on which the coercive value of <b>pacific</b> <b>blockades</b> was put to the test. Neutral vessels were not affected by it. This was followed by a number of other coercive measures described in the textbooks as <b>pacific</b> <b>blockades.</b>|$|R
50|$|Since the {{adoption}} of the Hague Convention of 1907 respecting the limitation of the employment of force for the recovery of contract debts, the contracting powers are under agreement not to have recourse to armed force for the recovery of contract debts claimed from the government of one country by the government of another country as being due to its nationals, unless the debtor state refuses or neglects to reply to an offer of arbitration, or after accepting the offer-prevents any compromis from being agreed on, or after the arbitration fails to submit to the award (Art. I). Though this does not affect <b>pacific</b> <b>blockades</b> in principle, it supersedes them in practice by a new procedure for some of the cases in which they have hitherto been employed.|$|R
50|$|The {{blockade}} {{which first}} {{gave rise to}} serious theoretical discussion on the subject was that instituted by France in 1884 in Chinese waters. On the 20th of October 1884 Admiral Courbet declared a blockade of all the ports and roadsteads between certain specified points of the island of Formosa. The British government protestmi that Admiral Coubert had not enough ships to render the blockade effective, {{and that it was}} therefore a violation of one of the articles of the Declaration of Paris of 1856; moreover, that the French government could only interfere with neutral vessels violating the blockade if there was a state of war. If a state of war existed, England as a neutral was bound to close her coaling stations to belligerents. The British government held that in the circumstances France was waging war and not entitled to combine the rights of peace and warfare for her own benefit. Since then <b>pacific</b> <b>blockades</b> have only been exercised by the great powers as a joint measure in their common interest, which has also been that of peace; and in this respect the term is taking a new signification in accordance with the ordinary sense of the word pacific.|$|R
5000|$|On 7 December 1902 both Britain and Germany issued ultimatums to Venezuela, {{even though}} there was still {{disagreement}} about whether to impose a <b>pacific</b> <b>blockade</b> (as the Germans wanted) or a war blockade (as the British wanted). Germany ultimately agreed to a war blockade, and after receiving no reply to their ultimatums, an unofficial naval blockade was imposed on 9 December with SMS Panther, SMS Falke, SMS Gazelle and SMS Vineta as major Kaiserliche Marine warships in Caribbean sea. On 11 December Italy offered its own ultimatum, which Venezuela also rejected. Venezuela maintained that its national laws were final, and said that [...] "the so-called foreign debt ought not to be and never had been a matter of discussion beyond the legal guaranties found in the law of Venezuela on the public debt." ...|$|E
50|$|That {{it is an}} act of violence, and {{therefore}} in the nature of war, is undeniable, seeing that it can only be employed as a measure of coercion by maritime powers able to bring into action such vastly superior forces to those the resisting state can dispose of that resistance is out of the question. In this respect it {{is an act of}} war, and any attempt to exercise it against a power strong enough to resist would be a commencement of hostilities, and at once bring into play the rights and duties affecting neutrals. On the other hand, the object and justification of a <b>pacific</b> <b>blockade</b> being to avoid war, that is general hostilities and disturbance of international traffic with the state against which the operation is carried on, rights of war cannot consistently be exercised against ships belonging to other states than those concerned. And yet, if neutrals were not to be affected by it, the coercive effect of such a blockade might be completely lost. Recent practice has been to limit interference with them to the extent barely necessary to carry out the purpose of the blockading powers.|$|E
50|$|The first case, however, {{in which}} the {{operation}} was really a blockade, unaccompanied by hostilities, and which therefore can be properly called a <b>pacific</b> <b>blockade,</b> was that which in 1837 Great Britain exercised against New Granada. A British subject and consul {{of the name of}} Russell was accused of stabbing a native of the country in a street brawl. He was arrested, and after being kept in detention for some months he was tried for the unlawful carrying of arms and sentenced to six years imprisonment. The British government resented this treatment as not only cruel and unjust towards Mr Russell, but disrespectful towards the British nation, and demanded the dismissal of the officials implicated and 1000 damages as some compensation for the cruel injuries which had been inificted upon Mr Russell (State Papers, 1837-1838, p. 183). The New Granada government refused to comply with these demands, and the British representative, acting upon his instructions, called in the assistance of the West Indian fleet, but observed in his communication to the British naval officer in command that it was desirable to avoid hostilities, and to endeavour to bring about the desired result by a strict blockade only. This seems to be the first occasion on which it had occurred to anybody that a blockade without war might serve the purpose of war.|$|E
50|$|A {{few days}} later, in early October, it was falsely {{reported}} that President Sánchez de Lozada {{had decided to}} export Bolivia's gas to Mexico and the United States through a Chilean port, notwithstanding strong public opposition. Rancor continues to be high against Chile since Bolivia lost its coastal territory {{to them in the}} late 19th century War of the <b>Pacific.</b> Protesters <b>blockaded</b> the main highway from the city of El Alto, Bolivia down to neighboring La Paz. A massive demonstration and virtual siege of La Paz ensued.|$|R
50|$|Due to the {{military}} budget cuts, the U.S. Army is poorly trained and equipped, thus is easily overrun. German saboteurs cut vital railroad links and telegraph lines, severing most communication between the southwestern states {{and the rest of}} the country. San Diego and Los Angeles fall into German hands, while the Mexicans burn Laredo and Brownsville. The Imperial German Navy's <b>Pacific</b> Fleet <b>blockades</b> West Coast ports, bombards coastal towns and traps the U.S. Navy's fleet in San Francisco Bay and Puget Sound. Forced to retreat north, the Americans destroy the refineries of the Los Angeles City Oil Field to deny fuel to the enemy's mechanized Army units and the blockade fleet, slowing the invasion. Meanwhile, the Texas Rangers and the National Guard fight a brutal defensive trench war that significantly impedes the Mexicans.|$|R
500|$|On 7 December 1902, {{both the}} United Kingdom and Germany issued ultimatums to Venezuela, {{even though there}} was still {{disagreement}} about whether to impose a <b>Pacific</b> Oceanic <b>blockade</b> (as the Germans wanted) or a war blockade (as the British wanted). Germany ultimately agreed to a war blockade, and after receiving no reply to their ultimatums, an unofficial naval blockade was imposed on 9 December with SMS Panther, SMS Falke, SMS Gazelle and SMS Vineta as major Kaiserliche Marine warships in Caribbean sea. On 11 December, Italy offered its own ultimatum, which Venezuela also rejected. Venezuela maintained that its national laws were final, and said that [...] "the so-named foreign debt ought not to be and never had been a matter of discussion beyond the legal guaranties found in the law of Venezuela on the public debt".|$|R
5000|$|At {{the start}} of the Russo-Japanese War, the bulk of the Russian <b>Pacific</b> Fleet was <b>blockaded</b> within the {{confines}} of Port Arthur by the Imperial Japanese Navy. However, the Russian subsidiary naval base at Vladivostok, although shelled by a Japanese squadron under the command of Vice Admiral Dewa Shigetō in March 1904, remained largely undamaged and unblockaded. Located at Vladivostok was a garrison force consisting of the protected cruiser [...] and auxiliary cruiser [...] and a stronger Vladivostok Independent Cruiser Squadron consisting of the armored cruisers Russian cruiser Rossia, , and , under the command of Rear Admiral Karl Jessen.|$|R

2500|$|The PBY Catalina {{was also}} {{employed}} by the RAAF as a long range bomber and mine-layer. The Catalinas excelled in the latter role, for while their low speed made them vulnerable to fighters, it also allowed them to accurately lay mines while flying. Four squadrons laid mines from April 1943 to July 1945 in the southwest <b>Pacific.</b> These operations <b>blockaded</b> ports and shipping routes. They also forced Japanese shipping into waters where American submarines were present. RAAF mining missions were often conducted at night {{to minimize the risk}} of interception and were hazardous, with some aircraft flying as low as [...] above the surface to perform an accurate drop. These operations could last over 20 hours. In 1944 RAAF Catalinas laid naval mines in Manila bay to interdict the Japanese navy and prevent their intervention in the Battle of Mindoro. The motto of the crews who conducted these operations was [...] "The First and the Furthest." ...|$|R
50|$|The Battle of Leyte Gulf {{was arguably}} the largest naval battle {{in history and}} was the largest naval battle of World War II. It {{was a series of}} four {{distinct}} engagements fought off the Philippine island of Leyte from 23 to 26 October 1944. Leyte Gulf featured the largest battleships ever built, was the last time in history that battleships engaged each other, and was also notable as the first time that kamikaze aircraft were used. Allied victory in the Philippine Sea established Allied air and sea superiority in the western <b>Pacific.</b> Nimitz favored <b>blockading</b> the Philippines and landing on Formosa. This would give the Allies control of the sea routes to Japan from southern Asia, cutting off substantial Japanese garrisons. MacArthur favored an invasion of the Philippines, which also lay across the supply lines to Japan. Roosevelt adjudicated in favor of the Philippines. Meanwhile, Japanese Combined Fleet Chief Toyoda Soemu prepared four plans to cover all Allied offensive scenarios. On 12 October Nimitz launched a carrier raid against Formosa to make sure that planes based there could not intervene in the landings on Leyte. Toyoda put Plan Sho-2 into effect, launching a series of air attacks against the U.S. carriers. However the Japanese lost 600 planes in three days, leaving them without air cover.|$|R
