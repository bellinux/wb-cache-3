Items fell from store shelves at grocery markets, streets were cracked, and wells had {{changes in the}} flow of water. The damage to the mobile homes in Chalfant was also consistent with intensity VI shaking, with some of the homes moving laterally as much as 18 inches. Also in this classification was damage to <b>pipe</b> <b>supports</b> along a portion of the Los Angeles Aqueduct between the Upper, Middle, and Control Gorge Power Plants southeast of Crowley Lake. Intensity V (Moderate) effects (including cracked windows and broken underground pipes) were present in the Central Valley, Death Valley, and Carson City, Nevada.|$|E

Some methods for corrosion protection include: painting, zinc coatings, hot dip galvanizing or a combination of these. In the case of FRP composite <b>pipe</b> <b>supports,</b> the elements required to form a corrosion cell aren't present, so no additional coatings or protections are necessary.|$|E

5000|$|Pipes {{are usually}} either {{supported}} from below or hung from above (but {{may also be}} supported from the side), using devices called <b>pipe</b> <b>supports.</b> Supports may {{be as simple as}} a pipe [...] "shoe" [...] which is akin to a half of an I-beam welded {{to the bottom of the}} pipe; they may be [...] "hung" [...] using a clevis, or with trapeze type of devices called pipe hangers. <b>Pipe</b> <b>supports</b> of any kind may incorporate springs, snubbers, dampers, or combinations of these devices to compensate for thermal expansion, or to provide vibration isolation, shock control, or reduced vibration excitation of the pipe due to earthquake motion. Some dampers are simply fluid dashpots, but other dampers may be active hydraulic devices that have sophisticated systems that act to dampen peak displacements due to externally imposed vibrations or mechanical shocks. The undesired motions may be process derived (such as in a fluidized bed reactor) or from a natural phenomenon such as an earthquake (design basis event or DBE).|$|E

50|$|Slip joints are {{sometimes}} found in tubular {{structures such as}} piping, but are generally avoided for this application due to requirements for sealing against leakage, instead using either a large loop that is allowed to flex or a semi-rigid bellows. Slip joints are used when the main problem is a large axial movement. <b>Pipe</b> <b>supports</b> often are slip joints {{to allow for the}} thermal expansion or contraction of the pipe relative to the support.|$|E
50|$|The {{universal}} {{expansion joint}} can absorb not only axial movements but angular and lateral movements as well. It {{consists of two}} metal bellows with an intermediate pipe and connectors on both sides. As a special form of the axial expansion joint, the universal expansion joint has only a limited pressure resistance for stability reasons and, moreover, loads the adjacent <b>pipe</b> <b>supports</b> with the axial compressive force resulting from the internal pressure. It is usually used to compensate large axial and lateral movements at low pressure.|$|E
50|$|A {{pipe support}} or pipe hanger is a {{designed}} element that transfer the load from a pipe to the supporting structures. The load includes {{the weight of}} the pipe proper, the content that the pipe carries, all the pipe fittings attached to pipe, and the pipe covering such as insulation. The four main functions of a pipe support are to anchor, guide, absorb shock, and support a specified load. <b>Pipe</b> <b>supports</b> used in high or low temperature applications may contain insulation materials. The overall design configuration of a pipe support assembly is dependent on the loading and operating conditions.|$|E

5000|$|Insulated pipes (called also preinsulated pipes or bonded pipe [...] ) {{are widely}} used for {{district}} heating and hot water supply in Europe. They consist of a steel pipe, an insulating layer, and an outer casing. The main purpose of such pipes is to maintain {{the temperature of the}} fluid in the pipes. A common application is the hot water from district heating plants. Most commonly used are single insulated pipes, but more recently in Europe it is becoming popular to use two pipes insulated within the same casing. By using insulated <b>pipe</b> <b>supports,</b> direct heat transfer between pipes and their supports are prevented.|$|E

In 1974, some 50 tons of steel pipe were removed from the ditch and scrapped. Today, the Bureau of Land Management preserves the remains of the ditch as a portion of the White Mountains National Recreation Area. The portion of Davidson Ditch that parallels the Steese Highway can be seen at milepost 57.3 of the highway, where a small display about the ditch has been constructed.|$|E

40|$|Inspection of {{corrosion}} at <b>pipe</b> <b>support</b> locations {{is difficult}} because of accessibility limitations. Recently a screening technique has been developed called Multi-Skip ultrasonics. The method utilizes a pitch-catch set-up. Shear waves are transmitted that reflect multiple times in the pipe wall, from which integral wall thickness information is obtained. The method {{turns out to be}} very sensitive in detecting the presence of wall loss, but {{it turns out to be}} difficult to determine the extent of the wall loss. If the extent is not known, only a conservative estimate of depth can be derived from the Multi-Skip signals, because of the accumulative nature of the change in arrival time due to wall loss. Multi-Skip tomography appears to be a promising method in addition to Multi-Skip screening as a follow-up inspection technique. It uses full wave field inversion to determine a wall thickness profile at a particular location of the <b>pipe</b> on the <b>support.</b> As with the Multi-Skip screening method, Multi-Skip tomography is applied with the transmitter and receiver on both sides of the <b>pipe</b> <b>support</b> location and waves traveling in the axial pipe direction.
