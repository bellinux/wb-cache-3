5|$|The poem is a {{detailed}} description of several objects, including a photo album and the camera that took the pictures in it, and is essentially about the nostalgia that the speaker, presumably Gibson himself, feels towards the details of his family's history: the <b>painstaking</b> descriptions of the houses they lived in, the cars they drove, and even their pets.|$|E
5|$|As {{with all}} of his Brushstrokes works, it is in part a satirical {{response}} to the gestural painting of Abstract Expressionism. Like most of Lichtenstein's Ben-Day dots works it is a depiction of mechanical reproduction via painterly technique. In this case, the satire comes from the depiction of the graphical depiction of the spontaneous painting motion in <b>painstaking</b> painterly detail.|$|E
5|$|Building a full spliced blank {{from scratch}} was an {{expensive}} and <b>painstaking</b> process, {{and the large}} manufacturing facilities of Brunswick turned out good quality blanks, with beautiful points, veneers and sound construction. In Balabushka's case, his entire workshop consisted of a single lathe and other woodworking equipment {{in the confines of}} his modest garage, and building his own full-splice butts would have been prohibitively difficult and expensive for him.|$|E
5|$|Many {{children}} with AS are initially misdiagnosed with {{attention deficit hyperactivity}} disorder (ADHD). Diagnosing adults is more challenging, as standard diagnostic criteria are designed for children and the expression of AS changes with age. Adult diagnosis requires <b>painstaking</b> clinical examination and thorough medical history gained from both the individual and other people who know the person, focusing on childhood behavior.|$|E
5|$|The {{betatron}} would influence {{all subsequent}} accelerators. Its success {{was due to}} {{a thorough understanding of}} the physics involved, and <b>painstaking</b> design of the magnets, vacuum pumps and power supply. In 1941, he teamed up with Robert Serber to provide the first theoretical analysis of the oscillations that occur in a betatron. The original 1940 machine was donated to the Smithsonian Institution in 1960.|$|E
5|$|Memories of {{more than}} a score of years of devoted service enhance the sense of {{personal}} loss which Miss LeHand's passing brings. Faithful and <b>painstaking,</b> with charm of manner inspired by tact and kindness of heart, she was utterly selfless in her devotion to duty. Hers was a quiet efficiency, which made her a real genius in getting things done. Her memory will ever be held in affectionate remembrance and appreciation, not only by all the members of our family but by the wide circle of those whose duties brought them into contact with her.|$|E
5|$|By {{the latter}} part of the 1900s Ravel had {{established}} a pattern of writing works for piano and subsequently arranging them for full orchestra. He was in general a slow and <b>painstaking</b> worker, and reworking his earlier piano compositions enabled him to increase the number of pieces published and performed. There appears to have been no mercenary motive for this; Ravel was known for his indifference to financial matters. The pieces that began as piano compositions and were then given orchestral dress were Pavane pour une infante défunte (orchestrated 1910), Une barque sur l'océan (1906, from the 1905 piano suite Miroirs), the Habanera section of Rapsodie espagnole (1907–08), Ma mère l'Oye (1908–10, orchestrated 1911), Valses nobles et sentimentales (1911, orchestrated 1912), Alborada del gracioso (from Miroirs, orchestrated 1918) and Le tombeau de Couperin (1914–17, orchestrated 1919).|$|E
5|$|The book {{describes}} how the relationship between insects and plants resulted in the beautiful and complex forms which natural theology attributed to a grand designer. By showing how practical adaptations develop from cumulative minor variations of parts of the flowers to suit new purposes, Darwin countered the prevailing view that beautiful organisms were the handiwork of a Creator. Darwin's <b>painstaking</b> observations, experiments, and detailed dissection of the flowers explained previously unknown features such as the puzzle of Catasetum, which had been thought to have three completely different species of flowers on the same plant. In addition, they produced testable predictions including his then-controversial proposal that the long nectary of Angraecum sesquipedale meant {{that there must be}} a moth with an equally long proboscis. This was confirmed in 1903 when Xanthopan morganii praedicta was found in Madagascar.|$|E
5|$|The {{removal of}} the sword from the coinage hub, which had already been {{produced}} by reduction from the plaster models, was accomplished by <b>painstaking</b> work by Mint Chief Engraver Morgan, using extremely fine engraving tools under magnification. Morgan did the work on December 23 {{in the presence of}} de Francisci, who had been summoned to the Philadelphia Mint to ensure the work met with his approval. It was insufficient merely to remove the sword, {{as the rest of the}} design had to be adjusted. Morgan had to hide the excision; he did so by extending the olive branch, previously half-hidden by the sword, but had to remove a small length of stem that showed to the left of the eagle's talons. Morgan also strengthened the rays, and sharpened the appearance of the eagle's leg. The chief engraver did his work with such skill that the work on the dollar was not known for over 85years.|$|E
5|$|Vagrant Story was {{conceived}} {{during a time}} when most games had made the transition into three-dimensional graphics. Games with real-time polygons were the mainstream, and it was decided for Vagrant Story to follow this trend. Murata, the main programmer, expressed his concerns in working towards a large-scale three-dimensional game for the first time. To avoid discrepancies in the frame rate caused by the large number of polygon models, the modeling team had to select an aspect of each character to focus their attention. Art director Minagawa mentioned that <b>painstaking</b> detail were given to each individual model, even to characters that only appear for a few seconds in the game. The same character models were used throughout the game to create a seamless transition between event cutscenes and actual gameplay. The sound effects of Vagrant Story are credited to Minoru Akao, the game's sound programmer; and Tomohiro Yajima, the sound editor and engineer.|$|E
5|$|A major {{report was}} {{published}} in January 1998 by The New York Times detailing Zardari's vast corruption and misuse of public funds. The report discussed $200 million in kickbacks to Zardari and a Pakistani partner for a $4 billion contract with French military contractor Dassault Aviation, in a deal that fell apart only when the Bhutto government was dismissed. It contained details of two payments of $5 million each by a gold bullion dealer {{in return for a}} monopoly on gold imports. It had information from Pakistani investigators that the Bhutto family had allegedly accrued more than $1.5 billion in illicit profits through kickbacks in virtually every sphere of government activity. It also reported Zardari's mid-1990s spending spree, which included {{hundreds of thousands of dollars}} spent on jewellery. The arrangements made by the Bhutto family for their wealth relied on Western property companies, Western lawyers, and a network of Western friends. The report described how Zardari had arranged secret contracts, <b>painstaking</b> negotiations, and the dismissal of anyone who objected to his dealings.|$|E
5|$|Carr also theorizes {{that the}} {{capacity}} to contemplate may diminish as computer algorithms unburden an Internet user's brain {{of much of the}} <b>painstaking</b> knowledge work — the manipulation of abstract information and knowledge — that was previously done manually. In comparing the Internet with Frederick Winslow Taylor's management system for industrial efficiency, Carr makes the point that back then some workers complained that they felt they were becoming mere automatons due to the systemic application of Taylorism — a theory of management that analyzes and synthesizes workflow processes, improving labor productivity. Carr selects Google as a prime example of a company in which computer engineers and software designers have applied Taylorism to the knowledge industry, delivering increasingly robust information that may have the effect of minimizing opportunities to ponder ambiguities. Additionally, he argues that the Internet's dominant business model is one that thrives as companies either collect information on users or deliver them advertisements, therefore companies capitalize on users who move from link to link rather than those who engage in sustained thought.|$|E
5|$|In 2002, Eckard Wimmer's {{group at}} SUNY Stony Brook succeeded in synthesizing {{poliovirus}} from its chemical code, producing the world's first synthetic virus. Scientists first converted poliovirus's published RNA sequence, 7741 bases long, into a DNA sequence, as DNA {{was easier to}} synthesize. Short fragments of this DNA sequence were obtained by mail-order, and assembled. The complete viral genome was then assembled by a gene synthesis company. This whole <b>painstaking</b> process took two years. Nineteen markers were incorporated into the synthesized DNA, {{so that it could}} be distinguished from natural poliovirus. Enzymes were used to convert the DNA back into RNA, its natural state. Other enzymes were then used to translate the RNA into a polypeptide, producing functional viral particle. The newly minted synthetic virus was injected into PVR transgenic mice, to determine if the synthetic version was able to cause disease. The synthetic virus was able to replicate, infect, and cause paralysis or death in mice. However, the synthetic version was between 1/1,000th and 1/10,000th as lethal as the original virus.|$|E
5|$|The {{captain had}} to record his survey in <b>painstaking</b> paperwork, and Darwin too kept a daily log {{as well as}} {{detailed}} notebooks of his finds and speculations, and a diary which became his journal. Darwin's notebooks show a complete professionalism that he had probably learnt at the University of Edinburgh when making natural history notes while exploring {{the shores of the}} Firth of Forth with his brother Erasmus in 1826 and studying marine invertebrates with Robert Edmund Grant for a few months in 1827. Darwin had also collected beetles at Cambridge, but he was a novice in all other areas of natural history. During the voyage Darwin investigated small invertebrates, while collecting specimens of other creatures for experts to examine and describe once the Beagle had returned to England. More than half of his carefully organised zoology notes deal with marine invertebrates, and the notes record closely reasoned interpretations of what he found about their complex internal anatomy while dissecting specimens under his microscope, and of little experiments on their response to stimulation. His onshore observations included intense, analytical comments on possible reasons for the behaviour, distribution, and relation to their environment of the creatures he saw. He made good use of the ship's excellent library of books on natural history, but continually questioned their correctness.|$|E
5|$|The {{unsuccessful}} assault against FSB Coral on {{the night}} of 12/13 May had demonstrated that the North Vietnamese would react violently to Australian attempts to control AO Surfers, and with 1 ATF deployed astride a key route to Saigon and threatening a number of communist bases and staging areas located nearby, further heavy fighting was expected over the following days. In response, the Australians were forced to refine their tactics and Hughes decided to establish strong defensive positions in order to destroy the North Vietnamese by fire, rather than by the <b>painstaking</b> patrolling more familiar to the Australians. The FSBs would be heavily defended by night, while the battalions would conduct defensive patrols by day. Later, fighting patrols up to company-size with armoured support would then be used to locate and destroy the Viet Cong main force bases. As such the Australian concept of operations subsequently evolved from one of searching and clearing in order to locate and cut infiltration and withdrawal routes, into a series of reconnaissance-in-force operations from heavily defended bases. Meanwhile, in AO Manly, 3 RAR continued patrolling for the next seven days, successfully ambushing staging areas and infiltration routes between 13–19 May for the loss of one soldier killed.|$|E
5|$|Other {{ichthyosaur}} remains {{had been}} discovered in years past at Lyme and elsewhere, but the specimen found by the Annings {{was the first to}} come to the attention of scientific circles in London. It was purchased by the lord of a local manor, who passed it to William Bullock for public display in London where it created a sensation. At a time when most people in Britain still believed in a literal interpretation of Genesis, that the Earth was only a few thousand years old and that species did not evolve or become extinct, the find raised questions in scientific and religious circles about what the new science of geology was revealing about ancient life and the history of the Earth. Its notoriety increased when Sir Everard Home wrote a series of six papers, starting in 1814, describing it for the Royal Society. The papers never mentioned who had collected the fossil, and in the first one he even mistakenly credited the <b>painstaking</b> cleaning and preparation of the fossil performed by Anning to the staff at Bullock's museum. Perplexed by the creature, Home kept changing his mind about its classification, first thinking {{it was a kind of}} fish, then thinking it might have some kind of affinity with the duck-billed platypus (only recently known to science); finally in 1819 he reasoned it might be a kind of intermediate form between salamanders and lizards, which led him to propose naming it Proteo-Saurus. By then Charles Konig, an assistant curator of the British Museum, had already suggested the name Ichthyosaurus (fish lizard) for the specimen and that name stuck. Konig purchased the skeleton for the museum in 1819. The skull of the specimen is still in the possession of the Natural History Museum in London (to which the fossil collections of the British Museum were transferred later in the century), but at some point, it became separated from the rest of the skeleton, the location of which is not known.|$|E
25|$|Between 1953 and 1964 Dr Robert Hope-Simpson, a GP, {{carried out}} <b>painstaking</b> {{research}} establishing that shingles is the reactivation of previously acquired chickenpox (varicella) virus.|$|E
25|$|Ras {{occupies}} a {{rightful place in}} the Leiden tradition of Indonesian studies. The qualities for which his publications stand out most are <b>painstaking</b> factual research, mostly of manuscripts, combined with wide scholarly reading, critical acumen and keen intellect.|$|E
25|$|In 1922, the U.S. Coast and Geodetic Survey began {{two years}} of <b>painstaking</b> {{measurement}} of the baseline using the recently available invar tapes. With the baseline length established in 1924, measurements were carried {{out over the next}} two years to obtain the published value of 299,796±4km/s.|$|E
25|$|In {{preparation}} for composing Pharaoh, Prus made a <b>painstaking</b> study of Egyptological sources, including works by John William Draper, Ignacy Żagiell, Georg Ebers and Gaston Maspero. Prus actually incorporated ancient texts into his novel like tesserae into a mosaic; drawn from one such text {{was a major}} character, Ennana.|$|E
25|$|The {{plant was}} searched {{a second time}} by a British patrol. As the {{soldiers}} pushed open the doors, an Irgun guard inside heard them and escaped through a back window. The soldiers heard him and conducted a <b>painstaking</b> search of the plant, but failed to find the hatch.|$|E
25|$|Dr. Kober {{also showed}} that the two symbol word for 'total' {{at the end of}} {{livestock}} and personnel lists, had a different symbol for gender. This gender change with one letter, usually a vowel, is most frequent in Indo-European languages. Kober had rejected any speculation on the language represented, preferring <b>painstaking</b> cataloguing and analysis of the actual symbols.|$|E
25|$|The <b>painstaking</b> {{restoration}} of the building to its original form and decoration was intended to prepare it for its new role as the new home of the Museum of the City of New York. However, the Bloomberg administration chose to house the New York City Department of Education with offices and classrooms also occupied by Innovate Manhattan Charter School.|$|E
25|$|However, {{one study}} {{published}} in 1959 suggested {{that many of the}} comparisons between diesel and steam locomotives were made unfairly mostly because diesels were newer. After <b>painstaking</b> analysis of financial records and technological progress, the author found that if research had continued on steam technology instead of diesel, there would be negligible financial benefit in converting to diesel locomotion.|$|E
25|$|The prospectors C. M. Weld, Dorabji Tata and Shapurji Saklatvala {{took nearly}} {{three years in a}} <b>painstaking</b> search across vast {{stretches}} of inhospitable terrain to find a location. One day they came across a village called Sakchi, on the densely forested stretches of the Chota Nagpur plateau, near the confluence of the Subarnarekha and Kharkai rivers. It seemed to be the ideal choice and the place was selected.|$|E
25|$|On {{the third}} day Kent lost their last four wickets in 40 minutes, {{finishing}} on 359. Gloucestershire, however, lost wickets steadily, and would have lost more had Kent not dropped four chances. Chris Taylor, the Gloucester captain, was the mainstay of the innings with a <b>painstaking</b> 66 from 173 balls. They finished the day on 208 for 7, 2 away from saving the follow-on, and most probably the match as well.|$|E
25|$|He {{made his}} Test {{debut in the}} 2nd match against India at his home ground of Wellington, on 26 December 1998, taking the catch of Sachin Tendulkar in India's first innings before scoring 4 and 0. Despite his failure {{at the top of}} the order, New Zealand won by four wickets. He was {{retained}} for the third Test, scoring a two-ball duck in the first innings and a <b>painstaking</b> 25 in the second innings as he struggled against an experienced Indian bowling attack.|$|E
25|$|The {{human genome}} {{consists}} of three billion base pairs, which code for approximately 20,000–25,000 genes. However the genome alone is of little use, unless the locations and relationships of individual genes can be identified. One option is manual annotation, whereby {{a team of scientists}} tries to locate genes using experimental data from scientific journals and public databases. However this is a slow, <b>painstaking</b> task. The alternative, known as automated annotation, is to use the power of computers to do the complex pattern-matching of protein to DNA.|$|E
25|$|One of {{the most}} {{important}} LGBT events of the decade took place in 1996 when People Like Us submitted their first application for registration as a society, after taking a year of <b>painstaking</b> effort to solicit 10 signatories. The application was lodged with the Registrar of Societies on 7 November 1996. However, it was rejected on 9 April 1997 with no reason given. PLU's appeals {{all the way to the}} Prime Minister's Office met with no success. This rejection was reported by news agencies around the world.|$|E
25|$|Lathwell {{made his}} England debut on 1 July 1993 against Australia at Trent Bridge, scoring 20 {{in his first}} innings and 33 in the second. After this fairly {{promising}} start, he was picked for the second Test at Headingley. Lathwell was dismissed third ball in the first innings, and made a <b>painstaking</b> 25 in the second innings, whilst batting to save the game. He never played for the national team again, despite this early promise, and retired from cricket in 2001, citing it as a strain.|$|E
25|$|In general, {{the range}} of {{possibilities}} is first narrowed down (often by entering the desired character's pronunciation). Then, if there remains more than one possibility, the desired ideogram is selected, either by typing the number before the character, or using a graphical menu to select it. The computer assists the typist by using heuristics to guess which character is most likely desired. Although this may seem <b>painstaking,</b> East Asian input methods are today sufficient in that, even for beginners, typing in these languages is only slightly slower than typing English.|$|E
25|$|After gaining some {{knowledge}} of the language, Dyer faced the challenge of producing movable metallic types {{for the thousands of}} Chinese characters. He started with a systematic analysis of characters and strokes. At first, using wood reliefs to create the clay moulds from which type could be cast, he soon moved to steel punches and copper matrixes. Dyer's linguistic abilities, meticulous planning, and <b>painstaking</b> attention to detail resulted in Chinese fonts of high quality. They were later passed on to the American Presbyterian Mission Press in China and played a significant part in its development.|$|E
25|$|Pulaiyattam {{is an old}} {{folk art}} dance of Tamilnadu state of India. A highly exuberant and {{cultural}} festival, this dance form usually comprises a troupe of 6 performers aping {{the movements of the}} majestic, predatory tigers. Their bodies are painted by the <b>painstaking</b> efforts of local artists in vibrant yellow and black to resemble an exact replica of a tiger. The paintings include the ferocious looking fangs and convincing headgear replete with ears paws with claws and long tail that conjures an accurate picture of the savage beast’s graceful movements.|$|E
25|$|Firstly, the {{underlying}} idea of Bruns has not proved viable (there were needs for refraction observations near the astronomical horizon, which—as Julius Bauschinger could {{show a little}} later—in principle can not be obtained with the required accuracy). On the other hand, the progress in the direct measurement of atmospheric data (weather balloon ascents) has since made the <b>painstaking</b> accuracy of this data from refraction observations unnecessary. In the time between PhD and habilitation Hausdorff completed the yearlong-volunteer military requirement and worked for two years as a human computer at the observatory in Leipzig.|$|E
25|$|True Stories of CSI: The Real Crimes Behind the Best Episodes of the Popular TV Show (published August 2009) – Katherine Ramsland {{follows the}} {{evidence}} and revisits {{some of the most}} absorbing episodes of the phenomenally popular C.S.I. television franchise, and explores the real-life crimes that inspired them. She also looks into the authenticity of the forensic investigations recreated for the dramatizations, and the <b>painstaking</b> real-life forensic process employed in every one of the actual cases—from notorious mass-murderer Richard Speck, through the massacre of Buddhist monks in an Arizona Temple, to a baffling case of apparent spontaneous combustion.|$|E
25|$|The fashion {{house had}} begun with 50 staff, but swelled {{over time to}} over 1,200 staff. This was work that {{required}} <b>painstaking</b> attention to detail, finesse and craftsmanship – a Worth bodice might have up to 17 pieces of material to ensure the perfect fit to its wearer. Seamstresses would be assigned to different workshops where they specialized in, for instance, making sleeves, stitching hems or skirt making. Most of the sewing of Worth garments was by hand, although {{the advent of the}} early sewing machine meant some main seams could be stitched by mechanical means.|$|E
