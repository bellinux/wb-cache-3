40|$|In this dissertation, I present work {{addressing}} three systems {{which are}} traditionally {{considered to be}} unrelated: turbulence, evolution, and social organization. The com-monality between these systems is that in each case, microscopic interaction rules give rise to an emergent behavior {{that in some way}} makes contact with the macroscopic scale of the problem. The open-ended evolution of complexity in evolving systems is analogous to the scale-free structure established in turbulent ows through local transportation of energy. In both cases, an invariance is required for the cascading behavior to occur, and in both cases the scale-free structure is built up from some initial scale from which the behavior is fed. In turbulence, I examine the case of two-dimensional turbulence in order to sup-port the hypothesis that the friction factor and velocity prole of turbulent pipe ows depend on the turbulent energy spectrum in a way unpredicted by the classic <b>Prandtl</b> <b>theory.</b> By simulating two-dimensional flows in controlled geometries, either an in-verse energy cascade or forward enstrophy cascade can be produced.

40|$|The present paper {{discusses}} {{the principles and}} applications of an iteration method for solving certain problems involving rotational motion of an ideal fluid, such as occur {{in the presence of}} heat transfer, combustion, mechanical work processes, and non-uniform shock waves. The iteration process linearizes the essentially non-linear equations for rotational fluid motion by assuming a process for the vorticity transport, namely: the nth approximation is linearized by assuming the vorticity to be transported by the n- 1 th velocity field. In some important cases, the first order solutions seem to offer considerable accuracy. Two applications of the procedure are discussed in some detail, namely: 1) The process of straightening a non-uniform flow in a two-dimensional parallel-wall channel by means of a screen and 2) The three-dimensional flow in a multistage axial turbomachine having an infinite number of blades in each blade row. The second of these, the three-dimensional flow through a turbomachine, is given detailed analysis bearing some analogy to the <b>Prandtl</b> <b>theory</b> of finite wings. The results for the first order solution of velocity and enthalpy distributions are given explicitly and are shown to be defined by four relatively simple integrals. The cases of rotating and stationary single blade rows are evaluated completely. The general iteration process for obtaining higher approximations, utilizing the method of Green's functions, is given in some detail. The calculations of the flow field generated by a blade row of given geometry is illustrated by the problem of a "vortex" turbomachine operating off the design condition. The problem is found to be essentially non-linear in some respects, especially as to the approach to periodic solutions for a succession of similar stages...|$|E

40|$|A general {{method for}} calculating the {{performance}} {{of all types of}} wind driven vessels has been developed. The method is of such a nature that it may be used, without specific experimental assistance, as a qualitative guide in preliminary design. To this same procedure, data from a few simple tests of the model in question may be applied to obtain good quantitative performance information. As a result, existing yacht model testing procedure Reference (4) can be considerably simplified {{while at the same time}} obtaining information of much broader applicability. The use of the principles of this method, if not the letter, should tend to rationalize the arbitrary and extremely restrictive handicapping rules for ocean racing now in existence. Further, the owner, in possession of a performance analysis of his vessel, can be guided in his choice of course and sail setting as these are fundamental parameters of the general performance equation. The optimum sail setting for any wind speed and boat direction is of a necessity obtained in the process of the solution of this equation. The method provides several rather surprising general conclusions. It is indicated that angle of heel, contrary to Reference (4) is not a fundamental variable, and therefore stability only enters the picture in so far as the designer has a "gentlemen's agreement" not to provide more sail than will heel the vessel to a certain angle in a given wind. It is found that only draft is a monotonic parameter in performance; all other form and sail variables exhibit optimums, some perhaps outside of the practical range. Also, it is found from the experimental data of Reference (5) that yacht underbodies, despite their extremely low aspect ratio, exhibit a polar of lateral force and induced resistance with a character in agreement with the simple <b>Prandtl</b> <b>theory.</b> The interference effect of the surface, however, is found to be at variance with the result obtained from a lifting line vortex arranged to satisfy the water boundary condition. It is found that the usual triangular yacht sail does not have as bad a downwash distribution as one might first suspect on considering the plan form and twist. The presence of the water surface has the effect of providing a corrective upwash distribution. It is found that simple static stability calculations with the water surface assumed undisturbed, at the boat, lead to surprisingly good agreement with the righting moments obtained experimentally under dynamic conditions. ...|$|E

The portion of a wing located in the slip stream of the propeller, the blades of propellers and fans, wind-tunnel models in nonuniform airstreams are some of the examples. Prandtl's three dimensional wing theory assumes a uniform undisturbed flow and thus it is not valid in these cases.

40|$|Graduation date: 1973 A {{theoretical}} {{study of}} the heat and momentum transfer resulting from a flow of power plant condenser effluent discharged vertically to shallow, quiescent coastal receiving water is presented. The complete partial differential equations governing steady, incompressible, turbulent flow driven by both initial momentum and buoyancy are solved using finite-difference techniques to obtain temperature and velocity distributions in the near field of the thermal discharge. The method of steady-flow vorticity transport was deemed the most attractive approach for this numerical study. A partial differential equation for buoyancy transport {{was used as a}} direct couple to the vorticity transport equation, and related the effluent temperature and salinity to buoyancy through an equation of state for sea water. Three-dimensional formulations along with two-dimensional translent methods were investigated at the outset of this research. However, in view of excessive computation requirements, two-dimensional steady flow techniques were found to be satisfactory and computationally more attractive to meet objectives of this study. Turbulent quantities were treated through the use of Reynolds stresses with further simplification utilizing the concept of eddy diffusivities computed by <b>Prandtl's</b> mixing length <b>theory.</b> A Richardson number correlation was used to account for the effects of density gradients on the computed diffusivities. Results were obtained for over 100 cases, 66 of which are reported, using the computer program presented in this manuscript. These results ranged from cases of pure buoyancy to pure momentum and for receiving water depths from 1 to 80 discharge diameters deep. Various computed gross aspects of the flow were compared to published data and found to be in excellent agreement. Data for shallow water plumes and the ensuing lateral spread are not readily available; however, one computed surface temperature distribution was compared to proprietary data and found also to be in excellent agreement.

It seems that the main obstruction to the verification of the spectral constraint condition is the possible separation of boundary layers.
