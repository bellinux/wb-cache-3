40|$|Abstract There {{has been}} {{substantial}} {{interest in the}} advancement and production of biodegradable polymer to solve the current problem of pollution triggered by the continuous use of synthetic polymer of petroleum origin. The likelihood of producing these bio- polymers commercially and at comparable cost has been the key focus in this area. The most promising way of making plastics from other abundant renewable sources like corn, soy beans, sugarcane etc. is the avenue of Bio plastics. This paper is a comparative study that confers {{the likelihood of the}} conventional petro-plastics being substituted by the new-age degradable and renewable bio-derived polymers. It presents the keynote issues that support findings of the benefits these materials have in relation to conventional, petrochemical based counterparts. It is the view of the authors that biodegradable plastic materials are most apt for single-use disposable applications where the <b>post-consumption</b> <b>waste</b> can be locally composted...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: There {{is growing}} social {{pressure}} for organizations {{to reduce their}} rates of consumption of nonrenewable natural resources and in parallel, to also reduce the release of post-production and <b>post-consumption</b> <b>waste</b> to landfills, water bodies and air, thereby causing damage to the environment. To respond to the pressure {{it is necessary that}} organizations ’ operations prioritize the “ 3 R ” goals: Reduce, Reuse and Recycle. In this context, the so called reverse logistics flows have grown in importance in the study of supply chains. Examples are the components and materials that are collected after they are consumed or used. Instead of being sent to the landfill companies use reverse logistics to transport them back in supply chains to be reused or, recycled and reincorporated as secondary input material for new production. This article aims, through the review of related legislation in Brazil, relevant literature and a number of Brazilian and international case studies to develop a basic framework {{to be used in the}} development and implementation of reverse logistics systems (RLS) ...|$|E
40|$|Purpose of this paper: In most industries, {{the bulk}} of the supply chain <b>wastes</b> occur <b>post-consumption.</b> Consumers {{participating}} in retailer-sponsored product recycling or renewal programs {{play a significant role in}} reducing supply chain wastes. Extant literature on green supply chain collaboration tends to focus on the business-to-business relationships between supply chain partners, paying little attention to the role of the individual consumers. This study examines factors influencing consumer intention to collaborate in retailer-sponsored recycling programs and green initiatives aimed at reducing <b>post-consumption</b> <b>wastes...</b>|$|R
40|$|The paper {{deals with}} a didactics and {{research}} experience, in which actors from cultural (international no-profit Association enhancing food value), academic (University), commercial (packaging production Firm) and social fields (Foundation recovering and re-distributing food excess) converged on the exploration of post- consumption food waste in public spaces. The aim was to develop products for leftovers pack and transport, the so-called "doggy-bags", increasing meaningfulness and value perception of food resources, raising public awareness on the food waste reduction importance in an environmental, ethical, social, cultural and economical context. The activity involved about 200 students, generated around 50 projects and proceeded with the realization and commercialization of one selected product. A campaign promoting this action and raising awareness about the global urgent phenomenon of <b>post-consumption</b> food <b>waste</b> was launched: the new food bags represent a smart and friendly tool enabling everyone to play their part in assuring food waste minimization and leftovers recover...|$|R
40|$|The paper {{describes}} the {{studies on the}} sand-lime (silicate) masonry units modified with recycled plastics in various forms: regranulate, regrind and powder. The following materials were examined: high impact polystyrene (HIPS) and acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS). The results of the functional properties tests, such as compressive strength, softening behavior, bulk density and water absorption are presented in the article. The microstructure of the products was analyzed using SEM and XRD methods. Obtained {{results show that the}} properties of modified product largely depend on the type, form and amount of used polymer. The highest compressive strength was achieved with 15 % of HIPS regranulate in the product (by weight). ABS does not improve the strength of the sample, however, it does block the capillary action in the sand-lime product. The lowest softening coefficient was obtained in the sample modified with HIPS regranulate. The examined polymers contributed to decrease in bulk density of the samples as well as lowered their water absorption. The samples with pulverized polymer have the worst properties. All the results are compared with those of the traditional sand-lime bricks and sand-lime product modified with other additives. The analysis indicate that silicate masonry units with post-production and <b>post-consumption</b> plastic <b>waste</b> can possess interesting functional properties what brings a new potential possibility to dispose of still growing number of plastic waste...|$|R
