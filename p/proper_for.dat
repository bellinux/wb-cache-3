5|$|As we {{understand}} the situation here, the Australian Constitution firmly places the prerogative powers of the Crown {{in the hands of}} the Governor-General as the representative of the Queen of Australia.

5|$|The French cavalry {{had been}} {{hindered}} in its movements by the broken terrain and thus far unable to really bother Zieten's infantry squares.
