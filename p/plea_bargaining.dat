5|$|Federal DUI law {{differs from}} New Jersey law {{in that there}} are no {{mandatory}} minimum jail sentences, irrespective of the number of previous DUI convictions, and <b>plea</b> <b>bargaining</b> is allowed. A federal DUI conviction will result in unexpungeable criminal record. Federal courts cannot suspend a driver's license, but may notify the New Jersey Motor Vehicle Commission of a DUI conviction. In federal enclaves that are under the jurisdiction of other federal departments (e.g. Fish and Wildlife Service), it is unclear if drunk driving could be prosecuted since the Assimilative Crimes Act is inapplicable, and there is no federal law defining DUI on those properties.|$|E
5|$|Law {{enforcement}} in the United States is primarily {{the responsibility of}} local police and sheriff's departments, with state police providing broader services. The New York City Police Department (NYPD) is {{the largest in the}} country. Federal agencies such as the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) and the U.S. Marshals Service have specialized duties, including protecting civil rights, national security and enforcing U.S. federal courts' rulings and federal laws. At the federal level and in almost every state, a legal system operates on a common law. State courts conduct most criminal trials; federal courts handle certain designated crimes as well as certain appeals from the state criminal courts. <b>Plea</b> <b>bargaining</b> in the United States is very common; the vast majority of criminal cases in the country are settled by plea bargain rather than jury trial.|$|E
5000|$|Controversy arose {{during the}} {{campaign}} over Ritter's use of <b>plea</b> <b>bargains</b> while in office. As DA, Ritter <b>plea</b> <b>bargained</b> 97% of cases which were brought to his office (near the national average). However, controversy surfaced regarding <b>plea</b> <b>bargains</b> that prevented the deportation of both legal and illegal immigrants charged with drug, assault, and other crimes. Both illegal immigration and drug use were hot topics {{in the race for}} governor, raising further controversy. Ritter has defended the <b>plea</b> <b>bargains,</b> stating that [...] "Our priority was to try the most serious cases." ...|$|R
50|$|A {{criminal}} case may in some jurisdictions be settled before a trial through a <b>plea</b> <b>bargain.</b> Typically, in a <b>plea</b> <b>bargain,</b> the defendant agrees {{to plead guilty}} to a lesser charge than that which was originally brought by the grand jury or prosecuter. A defendant who goes to trial risks greater penalties than would normally be imposed through a <b>plea</b> <b>bargain.</b>|$|R

5|$|New Jersey prohibits <b>plea</b> <b>bargaining</b> in DUI cases {{unless the}} {{prosecutor}} {{believes there is}} insufficient evidence to prove the case, and New Jersey does not offer hardship (work) licenses for people convicted of DUI. Because DUI is not a criminal offense in New Jersey, defendants are ineligible for pretrial intervention (PTI) and other diversion programs. A previous DUI conviction, in New Jersey or another state, cannot be used to disqualify a person from such programs, and those charged with an indictable offense stemming from drunk driving (e.g. cases involving serious injuries or eluding arrest) are eligible for PTI. A person convicted of DUI is barred from recovering accident-related damages from other drivers, but {{may be able to}} sue the business or person who served them alcoholic beverages.|$|E
5|$|Upon her {{arrest on}} November 22, 1995, Green {{was charged with}} two counts of first-degree murder, two counts of {{attempted}} first-degree murder, and one count of aggravated arson. She was held on $3,000,000 bail—the highest ever required {{at that point in}} time by Johnson County, Kansas—and maintained her innocence throughout pre-trial motions and a show cause hearing. However, when the defense's own investigators verified the strength of forensic evidence against Green, she agreed to an Alford plea to all charges. On May 30, 1996, she was sentenced to two concurrent forty-year prison sentences. Green has petitioned for a new trial twice since her conviction. Her first request, which she eventually withdrew, was based on a claim of having been rendered incompetent for <b>plea</b> <b>bargaining</b> by the psychiatric medications she was taking at the time of her hearings; her second, which was denied by a judge, claimed that the evidence used to convict her of arson had been rendered obsolete by scientific advances.|$|E
25|$|<b>Plea</b> <b>bargaining</b> in the United States is very common; {{the vast}} {{majority}} of criminal cases in the United States are settled by plea bargain rather than by a jury trial. They have also been increasing in frequency—they rose from 84% of federal cases in 1984 to 94% by 2001. Plea bargains are subject to the approval of the court, and different States and jurisdictions have different rules. Game theory has been used to analyze the <b>plea</b> <b>bargaining</b> decision.|$|E

50|$|In a <b>plea</b> <b>bargain</b> (a 12-year {{sentence}} for manslaughter), Homolka testified against Bernardo in his murder trial. The <b>plea</b> <b>bargain</b> was criticized by many Canadians, since Bernardo's first defence lawyer (Ken Murray) withheld videotapes for 17 months. They were considered crucial evidence, and prosecutors {{said that they}} would never have agreed to the <b>plea</b> <b>bargain</b> if they had seen the tapes. Murray was later acquitted of obstruction of justice and faced a disciplinary hearing by the Law Society of Upper Canada.|$|R
50|$|The {{attorney}} for Titlow {{explained that the}} prosecution had the evidence to convict her for {{murder in the first}} degree.

25|$|A {{person must}} be 21 {{years of age}} to gamble at a casino in New Jersey. It is legal for a minor {{to go to a}} casino, insofar as they do not gamble, consume {{alcoholic}} beverage, or remain on the gambling floor. Underage gambling at a casino is a disorderly persons offense (misdemeanor), punishible by a $500–$1000 fine and a mandatory six-month driver's license suspension, and <b>plea</b> <b>bargaining</b> of underage gambling charges is prohibited. The legal age for other forms of licensed gambling (e.g., lottery, horse race) is 18, but a person under 18 may take part in amusement games where the prize is an item (e.g., a stuffed animal), and not cash. There is no minimum age for social gambling.|$|E
25|$|According to GlobalSecurity, police {{impunity}} {{and corruption}} are serious problems. In 2008 President Assad issued {{a law that}} mandates that only the General Command of the Army and Armed Forces may issue an arrest warrant {{in the case of}} a crime committed by a military officer, member of the internal security forces, or customs police officer in the pursuit of his normal duties, and that such cases must be tried in military courts. Arbitrary and false arrests are also problems, and detainees had no legal redress. According to the accusations, the authorities use the Emergency Law to detain persons critical of the government and charge them with a wide range of political crimes, including treason. Incommunicado detention was a severe problem. Many persons who disappeared were believed to be either in long-term detention without charge or possibly to have died while detained. Many detainees brought to trial were held incommunicado for years, and their trials were often marked by irregularities and lack of due process. A shortage of available courts and lack of legal provisions for a speedy trial or <b>plea</b> <b>bargaining</b> led to lengthy pretrial detentions.|$|E

In late March 2014, prosecutors signed a <b>plea</b> <b>bargain</b> with Zaken, under which she would plead guilty, and prosecutors would not request a prison term longer than 11 months.

50|$|Homolka's <b>plea</b> <b>bargain</b> {{had been}} offered before the {{contents}} of the videotapes were available for review. Anne McGillivray, Associate Professor of Law at the University of Manitoba, explained the continuing public antagonism against Homolka: There was widespread belief that she had known where the videotapes were hidden, that she wilfully concealed the Jane Doe incidents and, most centrally, that her claims of being under Bernardo's control - a central tenet of the <b>plea</b> <b>bargain</b> - were dubious. Speculation was fed by a publicity ban on the <b>plea</b> <b>bargain</b> which stood until Bernardo's trial.|$|R
2500|$|Advocates of {{the death}} penalty say that it deters crime, is a good tool for {{prosecutors}} in <b>plea</b> <b>bargaining,</b> improves the community by eliminating recidivism by executed criminals, provides [...] "closure" [...] to surviving victims or loved ones, and is a just penalty.|$|E
2500|$|Some {{cases can}} be {{disposed}} of {{without the need for}} a trial. [...] In fact, the vast majority are. [...] If the accused confesses his or her guilt, a shorter process may be employed and a judgment may be rendered more quickly. Some nations, such as America, allow <b>plea</b> <b>bargaining</b> in which the accused pleads guilty, nolo contendere or not guilty, and may accept a diversion program or reduced punishment, where the prosecution's case is weak or in exchange for the cooperation of the accused against other people. This reduced sentence is sometimes a reward for sparing the state the expense of a formal trial. Many nations do not permit the use of <b>plea</b> <b>bargaining,</b> believing that it coerces innocent people to plead guilty in an attempt to avoid a harsh punishment.|$|E
