Early and accurate diagnosis of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection is essential for timely identification of patients needing antiretroviral therapy and for instituting HIV prevention strategies. The primary methodology for HIV testing has shifted from enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) to rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) in recent years, especially in resource limited settings. However, the diagnostic performance of RDTs {{is a matter of}} concern. In the present study the performance of an RDT being used as the initial test in serial testing based algorithm for HIV diagnosis was compared with ELISA. Seven hundred and eighty-seven sera, tested at the voluntary counselling and testing facility employing a serial testing algorithm (based on SD Bioline HIV- 1 / 2 3. 0 as the first test), were subsequently tested with Microlisa-HIV for anti-HIV antibodies. The first test missed 9 HIV reactive samples and also registered 5 false positives. The sensitivity, specificity, and negative and positive predictive values of the first test were 77. 5 %, 99. 3 %, and 98. 8 % and 86. 1 %, respectively, taking ELISA as the standard test. Our study highlights that RDTs fare poorly compared to ELISA as screening assays and that reactive results by RDTs need to be confirmed by western blot for a <b>positive</b> <b>serodiagnosis</b> of HIV infection. 1...|$|E
40|$|AbstractToxocariasis is a {{helminth}} zoonosis {{caused by}} infection with the larvae of Toxocara spp. ascarid worms. Only two species, Toxocara canis and Toxocara cati, are recognised as causative agents of human disease. The {{best choice for}} serodiagnosis of the generalised forms of toxocariasis, visceral larva migrans (VLM) or covert toxocariasis, relies upon the initial use of TES-ELISA, after which any positive result should subsequently be tested by Western blotting (WB). Covert toxocariasis is mostly a benign infection, so {{a large majority of}} infected subjects are asymptomatic or have very few symptoms and therefore go undiagnosed. In this form, this helminthosis is often self-limiting, leaving residual specific antibodies. A <b>positive</b> <b>serodiagnosis</b> caused by residual antibodies that do not have any diagnostic significance can be associated with any infectious or non-infectious disease. If separated from the ongoing clinical and laboratory context, such a positive result has no diagnostic value and should be only taken into account after the possible etiologies of any observed syndromes have been ruled out. Unlike the methods used for the immunodiagnosis of bacterial, viral or protozoal (toxoplasmosis) infections, it is not possible with toxocariasis to assess the age of the presence of specific IgG using the levels of specific IgM because IgM antibodies can be found throughout the course of helminthiasis. The detection of other classes of immunoglobulins, namely IgE and IgA, the subclasses, namely IgG 4 or circulating Ag was proven to be unable to discriminate between active and self-cured generalised toxocaral infections. Currently, the diagnosis of an active covert toxocariasis relies upon indirect arguments, e. g., the presence of otherwise unexplained symptoms along with blood eosinophilia and/or elevated levels of eosinophil cationic protein (ECP). This situation is far from ideal and more research should be carried out to solve this difficult problem...|$|E
40|$|In {{order to}} improve the {{procedures}} in the IgM-capture ELISA which has recently been introduced to the dengue <b>serodiagnosis,</b> <b>positive</b> case detection rate in the assay on dengue patients' sera was compared using monovalent and tetravalent antigens prepared as infected C 6 / 36 cell culture fluid. The {{results showed that the}} serotype of antigen which gave the highest positive case detection rate depended on the geographical area where the test sera were collected, and also that there were some sera which were scored as positive by monovalent antigen but were negative by the tetravalent antigen, and vice versa. Therefore, it is recommended that the test sera should first be examined by the tetravalent antigen, and the negative specimens should be re-examined with monovalent antigens in order to obtain highest positive case detection...|$|R
40|$|Tuberculosis has re-emerged as {{a global}} health threat today. Current {{tuberculosis}} diagnosis is too slow in general and unsensitive in HIV burdened populations. Exposure to mycobacterial antigens {{in a country with}} a high prevalence of tuberculosis leads to false <b>positive</b> test results. <b>Serodiagnosis</b> would have been ideal, but was hitherto not successful. Mycolic acid (MA) is the major lipid cell wall constituent of Mycobacterium tuberculosis, the etiological agent of this disease. In this study an antibody response to the MA molecules are investigated as a possible surrogate marker for tuberculosis. In previous studies, IgG antibodies to MA in TB infected, HIV seronegative patients were detected in human sera, with promising results. In this study the ELISA results detecting anti-IgG antibodies to MA in TB and HIV co-infected patients showed a low sensitivity and specificity. The study, however, showed that antibodies to MA are prevalent in HIV seropositive patients. The presentation of MA on the CD 1 molecule to T cells might explain why anti-MA antibodies are detected in HIV seropositive patients. The properties of anti-mycolic acid antibodies were investigated to explain the low sensitivities and specificities of the ELISA test. An ELISA was done comparing signals to MA and cholesterol as coating antigen. A degree of cross-reactivity of anti-MA antibodies to cholesterol was obtained. In using the IAsys biosensor it was shown that anti-MA antibodies were inhibited with MA and cholesterol as antigens in liposomes with cholesterol as the weaker antigen. An antibody response to MA might prove to be a good surrogate marker for tuberculosis when measured in an IAsys biosensor based serodiagnostic test, where the serodiagnosis does not depend on the detection of high affinity anti-MA antibodies only.

40|$|Abstract Background Plasmodium vivax {{is divided}} into two subtypes, a {{dominant}} form, VK 210 and a variant form, VK 247. This division is dependent on the amino acid composition of the circumsporozoite (CS) protein. In this study, the prevalence of the VK 247 variant form of P. vivax was investigated in Myanmar. Methods The existence of malaria parasites in blood samples was determined by microscopic examination, polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and DNA hybridization assays. To test for antibodies against P. vivax and Plasmodium falciparum in blood samples, an indirect immunofluorescence antibody test (IFAT) was performed using asexual blood antigens. An enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay with synthetic VK 210 and VK 247 antigens was carried out to discriminate between the P. vivax subtypes. Results By thick smear examination, 73 (n = 100) patients were single infected with P. vivax, one with P. falciparum and 13 with both species. By thin smear, 53 patients were single infected with P. vivax, eight with only P. falciparum and 16 with both. Most of the collected blood samples were shown to be P. vivax positive (n = 95) by PCR. All cases that were positive for P. falciparum by PCR (n = 43) were also positive for P. vivax. However, 52 cases were single infected with P. vivax. IFAT showed antibody titres from 1 : 32 to 1 : 4, 096. Additionally, using specific antibodies for VK 210 and VK 247, ELISA showed that 12 patients had antibodies for only the VK 210 subtype, 4 patients had only VK 247 subtype antibodies and 21 patients had antibodies for both subtypes. Using a DNA hybridization test, 47 patients were infected with the VK 210 type, one patient was infected with VK 247 and 23 patients were infected with both subtypes. Conclusions The proportion of the VK 247 subtype in Myanmar was 43. 1 % (n = 25) among 58 <b>positive</b> cases by <b>serodiagnosis</b> and 25. 6 % (n = 24) among 94 positive cases by genetic diagnosis. In both diagnostic methods, the infection status of malaria patients is highly diverse with respect to malaria species, and multiple clonal infections are prevalent in Myanmar. Therefore, the complexity of the infection should be considered carefully when diagnosing malaria in Myanmar. </p...|$|R
