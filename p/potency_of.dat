5|$|By definition, antagonists display no {{efficacy}} {{to activate}} the receptors they bind. Antagonists do not maintain the ability to activate a receptor. Once bound, however, antagonists inhibit the function of agonists, inverse agonists, and partial agonists. In functional antagonist assays, a dose-response curve measures {{the effect of the}} ability of a range of concentrations of antagonists to reverse the activity of an agonist. The <b>potency</b> <b>of</b> an antagonist is usually defined by its half maximal inhibitory concentration (i.e., IC50 value). This can be calculated for a given antagonist by determining the concentration of antagonist needed to elicit half inhibition of the maximum biological response of an agonist. Elucidating an IC50 value is useful for comparing the <b>potency</b> <b>of</b> drugs with similar efficacies, however the dose-response curves produced by both drug antagonists must be similar. The lower the IC50 the greater the <b>potency</b> <b>of</b> the antagonist, and the lower the concentration of drug that is required to inhibit the maximum biological response. Lower concentrations of drugs may be associated with fewer side-effects.|$|E

40|$|Results of all vitamin C bioassays by the {{odontoblast}} method completed {{to date in}} this laboratory {{were reviewed}} and discussed. The odontoblast method of bioassay was compared with two chemical methods of assay, the indophenol method of Hochberg, Melnick and Oser and the phenylhydrazine method of Roe and Gesterling. The ascorbic acid <b>potencies</b> <b>of</b> nine vitamin C carriers, assayed biologically in this laboratory and chemically in the Department of Chemistry, served {{as a basis for}} this comparison. These assay materials included six fortified juices, freshly opened, and opened and stored apple juices, tomato juice, and three canned orange juices fortified in varying proportions; and three unfortified juices, high and low potency tomato juices and canned orange juice. Statistical analysis of the chemical and biological <b>potencies</b> <b>of</b> fortified and unfortified juices indicated that chemical methods underestimated the biological <b>potencies</b> <b>of</b> the fortified juices. The two chemical methods agreed closely in the estimation <b>of</b> vitamin C <b>potencies</b> <b>of</b> all juices, and satisfactorily estimated the biological <b>potencies</b> <b>of</b> unfortified juices...|$|R

5|$|Bupropion is {{also known}} {{to act as a}} non-competitive {{antagonist}} of the α3β2, α3β4, α4β2, and, very weakly, α7 nACh receptors, and these actions appear to be importantly involved in its beneficial properties not only in smoking cessation, but in depression as well. The metabolites of bupropion also act as non-competitive antagonists of these nACh receptors, and hydroxybupropion is even more potent in comparison. At therapeutically-relevant concentrations bupropion and hydroxybupropion act as negative allosteric modulators of the serotonin 5-HT3A receptor. Pharmacological data on bupropion and its metabolites are shown in the table. Bupropion is known to weakly inhibit the α1 adrenergic receptor, with a 14% <b>potency</b> <b>of</b> its dopamine uptake inhibition, and the H1 receptor, with a 9% potency.|$|E
5|$|Jains cite inequalities, sufferings, {{and pain}} as {{evidence}} {{for the existence of}} karma. Various types of karma are classified according to their effects on the <b>potency</b> <b>of</b> the soul. The Jain theory seeks to explain the karmic process by specifying the various causes of karmic influx (āsrava) and bondage (bandha), placing equal emphasis on deeds themselves, and the intentions behind those deeds. The Jain karmic theory attaches great responsibility to individual actions, and eliminates any reliance on some supposed existence of divine grace or retribution. The Jain doctrine also holds that it is possible for us to both modify our karma, and to obtain release from it, through the austerities and purity of conduct.|$|E

5|$|Mups {{are members}} of a large family of low-molecular weight (~19kDa) {{proteins}} known as lipocalins. They have a characteristic structure of eight beta sheets arranged in an anti-parallel beta barrel open on one face, with alpha helices at both ends. Consequently, they form a characteristic glove shape, encompassing a cup-like pocket that binds small organic chemicals with high affinity. A number of these ligands bind to mouse Mups, including 2-sec-butyl-4,5-dihydrothiazole (abbreviated as SBT or DHT), 6-hydroxy-6-methyl-3-heptanone (HMH) and 2,3 dihydro-exo-brevicomin (DHB). These are all urine-specific chemicals that have been shown to act as pheromones—molecular signals excreted by one individual that trigger an innate behavioural response in another member of the same species. Mouse Mups have also been shown to function as pheromone stabilizers, providing a slow release mechanism that extends the <b>potency</b> <b>of</b> volatile pheromones in male urine scent marks. Given the diversity of Mups in rodents, it was originally thought that different Mups may have differently shaped binding pockets and therefore bind different pheromones. However, detailed studies found that most variable sites are located {{on the surface of the}} proteins, and appear to have little effect on ligand binding.|$|E

No correlation was found between the anticholinesterase <b>potencies</b> <b>of</b> the drugs and their potentiations of the maximal twitch in response to electrical stimulation, or their antagonisms of tubocurarine.

40|$|Recent {{studies have}} {{indicated}} that lipopolysaccharides (LPS) isolated from particular bacterial strains can bias innate immune responses toward different signal transduction pathways thereby eliciting unique patterns of cytokines. Heterogeneity in the structure of lipid A (the active component of LPS) and possible contaminations with other inflammatory components have made it difficult to confirm these observations and dissect molecular motifs that may be responsible for modulatory properties. To address these issues, we have examined, for the first time, the ability of a range of well defined synthetic lipid As and isolated LPS and lipid A preparations to induce the production {{of a wide range of}} cytokines in three different mouse cell types. It was found that, for a given compound, the <b>potencies</b> <b>of</b> production of the various cytokines differed significantly. An additive model, in which a chemical change in the structure of a compound effects the <b>potencies</b> <b>of</b> all cytokines in the same manner, could describe the <b>potencies</b> <b>of</b> the cytokines for all compounds. Thus, no evidence was found that the structure of lipid A can modulate the pattern of cytokine production. In addition, the statistical analysis showed that the relative ordering <b>of</b> the <b>potencies</b> <b>of</b> the compounds was identical in the different cell types and that structural features such as the presence of a 3 -deoxy-d-manno-octulosonic acid moiety, anomeric phosphate, lipid length, and acylation pattern were important for pro-inflammatory activity. Finally, it was found that transcriptional and post-transcription control mechanisms determine <b>potencies</b> and efficacies <b>of</b> cytokine production in cell-specific manners...|$|R

40|$|Somatomedin <b>potencies</b> <b>of</b> sera were assayed by {{following}} sulfation of mucopolysaccharides in chick embryo sterna in vitro. Apparent <b>potencies</b> <b>of</b> sera from hypophysectomized rats, maintained on a low-iodine diet, were restored to levels above normal by {{addition to the}} incubation medium of L-triiodothyronine at 10 - 7 mol/liter <b>of</b> serum. The <b>potencies</b> <b>of</b> normal rat, human, and fetal calf sera were raised 1. 3 - to 3 -fold by addition of triiodothyronine at 10 - 9 - 10 - 7 mol/liter of serum. L-Thyroxine was about 10 times less effective than triiodothyronine. Triiodothyronine alone did not stimulate sulfation to nearly the same extent as triiodothyronine plus serum, even at higher concentrations. Serum could not be substituted in this system by any of six purified hormones, nor by trace metals or amino acids {{not included in the}} incubation mixture. It is concluded that triiodothyronine, in combination with a factor in serum, causes a rapid stimulation of sulfation in chick embryo cartilage, and that thyroid hormones may be involved in the action of normal serum on this tissue...|$|R

40|$|Anti{{histamine}}s inhibit histamine signaling {{by blocking}} histamine H 1 receptor (H 1 R) or suppressing H 1 R signaling as inverse agonists.

Here, we show that antihistamine suppressed upregulation of histidine decarboxylase (HDC) mRNA expression in patients with pollinosis, and its expression level was correlated with that of H 1 R mRNA. Certain antihistamines, including mepyramine and diphenhydramine, suppress toluene- 2, 4 -diisocyanate (TDI) -induced upregulation of HDC gene expression and increase HDC activity in TDI-sensitized rats. However, d-chlorpheniramine did not demonstrate any effect.
