50|$|Plastic pallets {{are often}} made of new HDPE or {{recycled}} PET (drink bottles). They are usually extremely durable, lasting {{for a hundred}} trips or more, and resist weathering, rot, chemicals and corrosion. The benefits of plastic pallets over wood pallets include {{the ability to be}} easily sanitized, resistance to odor, fire retardancy, longer service life span, durability and better product protection, non-splintering, and lighter weight, thus saving on transportation and labor costs and making them safer and more environmentally friendly.They often stack. Plastic pallets are exempt by inspection for biosafety concerns, and easily sanitize for international shipping. HDPE is impervious to most acids and toxic chemicals clean from them more easily. Some plastic pallets can collapse from <b>plastic</b> <b>creep</b> if used to store heavy loads for long periods. Plastic pallets cannot easily be repaired, and can be ten times as expensive as hardwood, so they are often used by logistics service providers who can profit from their durability and stackability. The large supply chains have increased the use of plastic pallets as many organisations seek to reduce costs through waste, transport and health & safety. Pallets and dolly combined for example the Pally eliminate pallet instability and the need for additional lifting equipment, but also create valuable space in busy operating environments and deliver significant time and cost savings by reducing supply chain handling. Plastics' reusability has contributed to an increase in usage of plastic pallets.|$|E

The anelastic and the <b>plastic</b> <b>creep</b> responses are similar qualitatively but different quantitatively between the type-H and type-L specimens. The anelastic strain ɛan,GB, associated with the grain boundary (GB) regions, increases linearly with (T-Tan 1) (σap-σan 1), when the temperature T is higher than a threshold temperature Tan 1 of 200 K and the applied stress σap is higher than a threshold stress, σan 1, of a few MPa. The ratio of ɛan,GB to the elastic strain is as large as 1. 1 for the type-H specimens and 0. 2 for the type-L specimens at 320 K for σap≫σan 1. The activation energy for the GB anelastic process is 0. 2 eV. We surmise that cooperative motions of many atoms in the GB regions are responsible for ɛan,GB, and both Tan 1 and σan 1 show a distribution depending on the number of atoms associated. The <b>plastic</b> <b>creep</b> rate ɛ′ vs σap data show a letter S-like curve. We classified the creep response into three categories, region I for the linear creep rate region for σap between σpc 1 and σpc 2, region II for the transient creep rate region for σap between σpc 2 and σpc 3, and region III for the saturation creep rate region for σap between σpc 3 and σy.
