5|$|Helicoverpa zea, {{commonly}} known as the corn earworm, is a species (formerly in the genus Heliothis) in the family Noctuidae. The larva of the moth Helicoverpa zea is a major agricultural pest. Since it is <b>polyphagous</b> (feeds on many different plants) during the larval stage, the species has been given many different common names, including the cotton bollworm and the tomato fruitworm. It also consumes a wide variety of other crops.|$|E
5|$|Most {{grasshoppers}} are <b>polyphagous,</b> eating vegetation {{from multiple}} plant sources, {{but some are}} omnivorous and also eat animal tissue and animal faeces. In general their preference is for grasses, including many cereals grown as crops. The digestive system is typical of insects, with Malpighian tubules discharging into the midgut. Carbohydrates are digested mainly in the crop, while proteins are digested in the ceca of the midgut. Saliva is abundant but largely free of enzymes, helping to move food and Malpighian secretions along the gut. Some grasshoppers possess cellulase, which by softening plant cell walls makes plant cell contents accessible to other digestive enzymes.|$|E
5|$|The {{corn earworm}} {{is a major}} {{agricultural}} pest, with a large host range encompassing corn and many other crop plants. H. zea is the second-most important economic pest species in North America, next to the codling moth. The estimated annual cost of the damage is more than US$100 million, though expenditure on insecticide application has reached up to $250 million. The mothâ€™s high fecundity, ability to lay between 500 and 3,000 eggs, <b>polyphagous</b> larval feeding habits, high mobility during migration, and a facultative pupal diapause {{have led to the}} success of this pest.|$|E
25|$|Many {{species are}} <b>polyphagous</b> in larva stage. Monophagous species, like the Cinnabar moth (Tyria jacobaeae) are scarce.|$|E
25|$|Although abundant, few {{species in}} this {{subfamily}} are of economic importance. Even the fall webworm, an abundant and highly <b>polyphagous</b> tree-feeding species that has spread from North America to Asia and Europe, {{does not do}} lasting damage to healthy hosts.|$|E
25|$|This snail {{lives in}} wetlands, springs, and seeps, {{and only two}} of its natural {{habitats}} are known to exist: Three Lakes, a meadow near Kanab, Utah, and Vasey's Paradise, a spring along the Colorado River within Grand Canyon National Park. In its natural habitat it is rather <b>polyphagous,</b> feeding mainly on bacteria, plants and fungi, and reproduces during the summer.|$|E
25|$|Most {{caterpillars}} are solely herbivorous. Many {{are restricted}} to feeding on one species of plant, while others are <b>polyphagous.</b> Some, including the clothes moth, feed on detritus. Some are predatory, and may prey on other species of caterpillars (e.g. Hawaiian Eupithecia). Others feed on eggs of other insects, aphids, scale insects, or ant larvae. A few are parasitic on cicadas or leaf hoppers (Epipyropidae). Some Hawaiian caterpillars (Hyposmocoma molluscivora) use silk traps to capture snails.|$|E
25|$|Links in food webs map {{the feeding}} {{connections}} (who eats whom) in an ecological community. Food cycle is an obsolete term that {{is synonymous with}} food web. Ecologists can broadly group all life forms into one of two trophic layers, the autotrophs and the heterotrophs. Autotrophs produce more biomass energy, either chemically without the sun's energy or by capturing the sun's energy in photosynthesis, than they use during metabolic respiration. Heterotrophs consume rather than produce biomass energy as they metabolize, grow, and add to levels of secondary production. A food web depicts a collection of <b>polyphagous</b> heterotrophic consumers that network and cycle the flow of energy and nutrients from a productive base of self-feeding autotrophs.|$|E
25|$|V. maculifrons is a <b>polyphagous</b> species, {{meaning that}} they feed {{on a variety of}} foods. The number of trips a worker makes to forage depends on the age of the worker, as well as the size of the nest, since more food is {{necessary}} to feed a larger nest. Workers dedicated to foraging are capable of olfactory learning, allowing them to distinguish odors specific to food. Workers use this ability to scavenge for dead insects such as earwigs and fall webworm larvae, as well as live arthropods. They are also frugivores, obtaining carbohydrates from fruits, nectar, and honeydew. Workers go to flowers in an attempt to catch insects, but often end up feeding on nectar and pollinating the flower while doing so. They feed on honeydew, which is a sweet, sticky liquid. However, honeydew is susceptible to fermentation, causing individuals that feed on it to become inebriated and unable to fly or walk. Since this species is attracted to sugar sources, they may be attracted to soft drinks or other foods consumed by humans. Adults feed larvae with a chewed paste made from other insects and carrion.|$|E

2500|$|It is {{estimated}} that desert locusts consume the equivalent of their body weight (...) each day in green vegetation. They are <b>polyphagous</b> and feed on leaves, shoots, flowers, fruit, seeds, stems and bark. Nearly all crops, and noncrop plants, are eaten including pearl millet, maize, sorghum, barley, rice, pasture grasses, sugarcane, cotton, fruit trees, date palms, banana plants, vegetables and weeds.|$|E
2500|$|Plant defense may explain, in part, why herbivores employ {{different}} life history strategies. [...] Monophagous species (animals that eat plants {{from a single}} genus) must produce specialized enzymes to detoxify their food, or develop specialized structures to deal with sequestered chemicals. [...] <b>Polyphagous</b> species (animals that eat plants from many different families), on the other hand, produce more detoxyfying enzymes (specifically MFO) {{to deal with a}} range of plant chemical defenses. Polyphagy often develops when a herbivore's host plants are rare as a necessity to gain enough food. [...] Monophagy is favored when there is interspecific competition for food, where specialization often increases an animals' competitive ability to use a resource.|$|E
