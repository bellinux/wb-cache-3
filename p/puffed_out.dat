5|$|Potbelly sculptures are {{generally}} rough sculptures that show considerable variation {{in size and}} {{the position of the}} limbs. They depict obese human figures, usually sat cross-legged with their arms upon their stomach. They have <b>puffed</b> <b>out</b> or hanging cheeks, closed eyes and are of indeterminate gender.|$|E
5|$|One {{theory is}} that the sculptures {{represent}} deceased individuals with bloated bodies, closed eyes, distended bellies and <b>puffed</b> <b>out</b> faces. The position of the limbs on some monuments, although following the natural contours of the boulder, give an impression of the position of corpses found in later Maya burial bundles. It is possible that Pasaco Monument 2 and the potbelly from San Juan Sacatepéquez portray the placement of a jade bead in the mouth of the sculpture. Although {{it has been suggested that}} the monuments themselves are burial markers, only three sculptures have been found directly associated with human remains. One of these is a ceramic potbelly from Colha in Belize, the others are from Chalchuapa and Kaminaljuyu. However, since most potbelly monuments were not found in their original locations it is impossible to know whether they originally served as burial markers.|$|E
25|$|Hair {{was dressed}} simply, middle parted {{and in a}} bun or wound braid at the back, with the sides <b>puffed</b> <b>out</b> over the ears or with {{clusters}} of curls to either side in imitation of early 17th century fashions.|$|E
60|$|Around {{the first}} corner Stuffy turned, and stood for one minute. Then {{he seemed to}} <b>puff</b> <b>out</b> his rags as an owl <b>puffs</b> <b>out</b> his feathers, {{and fell to the}} {{sidewalk}} like a sunstricken horse.|$|R
5000|$|Some critics {{believe the}} <b>puffing</b> <b>out</b> of Connally's cheeks is simply physics at work, as the bullet collapses {{one of his}} lungs, forcing air into his mouth. Other critics believe that the puffing of Connally's cheeks result from him shouting, [...] "Oh, no, no, no", which his wife, Nellie, said he shouted after the first shot but before the second shot. The premise that a {{collapsed}} lung would cause Connally's cheeks to <b>puff</b> <b>out</b> is dismissed by Michael Baden, chief forensic pathologist for the HSCA. [...] "When the lung is punctured, as Connally's was, {{the air in the}} lung goes out into the chest cavity, not out of the mouth, so Connally's cheeks <b>puffing</b> <b>out</b> would have not been caused by air trying to escape." ...|$|R
5000|$|The term {{originates}} {{from the}} old Italian [...] "buffare", meaning to <b>puff</b> <b>out</b> one's cheeks that also applies to bouffon.|$|R
25|$|Like most birds the pittas are monogamous breeders, {{and defend}} {{breeding}} territories. Most species are seasonal breeders, timing their breeding to {{occur at the}} onset of the rainy season. An exception to this is the superb pitta, which breeds almost year-round, as the island of Manus which it breeds on remains wet all year. The courtship behaviours of the family are poorly known, but the elaborate dance of the African pitta includes jumping into the air with a <b>puffed</b> <b>out</b> breast and parachuting down back down to the perch.|$|E
25|$|In the puffballs, {{which include}} the genera Lycoperdon, Bovista, and Calvatia, spores are formed within spherical to pestle-shaped fruit bodies and are {{released}} either by wind (as the fruit body wears away, exposing the spore mass inside) or by raindrops. In the latter case, the fruit bodies develop an ostiole (apical hole) through which spores are <b>puffed</b> <b>out</b> by the pressure of raindrops falling on the fruit body surface. The same ingenious mechanism has evolved separately in the earthstars (Geastrum species), which have a hard outer layer to the fruitbody that splits open in a star-like manner to reveal the puffball-like spore sack.|$|E
500|$|Kevin Steinberger, {{reviewer}} for Magpies, found Lat's layout made Kampung Boy an [...] "easy, inviting read." [...] He {{said that}} Lat's pen-and-ink drawings {{relied on the}} [...] "strong contrast {{between black and white}} to create space and suggest substance." [...] Lat drew the children of Kampung Boy as [...] "mostly mop-topped, toothy, bare-bottomed or sarong-draped" [...] kids, who are often [...] "exaggeratedly dwarfed" [...] by items of the adult world. [...] He explained that the way the boys were drawn was partly due to the influence of comics he read in the 1950s; [...] "naughty ones with... bushy hair" [...] were prominent male protagonists in those books. [...] The adult characters are easily distinguished by their exaggerated clothing and accessories such as <b>puffed</b> <b>out</b> pants and butterfly glasses. [...] "Short and round" [...] shapes make the design of the characters distinctive. [...] These characters display exaggerated expressions, particularly when they are drawn to face the readers.|$|E
50|$|Some bushshrikes have {{flamboyant}} displays. The male puffbacks <b>puff</b> <b>out</b> {{the loose}} feathers on their rump and lower back, to look almost ball-like.|$|R
6000|$|It was jolly {{to watch}} his eyes twinkle and his thin cheeks <b>puff</b> <b>out.</b> He {{shook his head and}} muttered through that straggly moustache: ...|$|R

500|$|Röhm {{was held}} briefly at Stadelheim Prison in Munich, while Hitler {{considered}} his future. In the end, Hitler decided that Röhm had to die. On July 1, at Hitler's behest, Theodor Eicke, Commandant of the Dachau concentration camp, and his SS adjutant Michel Lippert visited Röhm. Once inside Röhm's cell, they {{handed him a}} Browning pistol loaded with a single bullet {{and told him he}} had ten minutes to kill himself or they would do it for him. Röhm demurred, telling them, [...] "If I am to be killed, let Adolf do it himself." [...] Having heard nothing in the allotted time, they returned to Röhm's cell at 14:50 to find him standing, with his bare chest <b>puffed</b> <b>out</b> in a gesture of defiance. Eicke and Lippert then shot Röhm, killing him. In 1957, the German authorities tried Lippert in Munich for Röhm's murder. Until then, Lippert {{had been one of the}} few executioners of the purge to evade trial. Lippert was convicted and sentenced to 18 months in prison.|$|E
2500|$|The {{business}} {{began in}} 1940, with a restaurant opened by brothers Richard and Maurice McDonald at 1398 North E Street at West 14th Street in San Bernardino, California (at [...] ). Their {{introduction of the}} [...] "Speedee Service System" [...] in 1948 furthered {{the principles of the}} modern fast-food restaurant that the White Castle hamburger chain had already put into practice more than two decades earlier. The first McDonald's with the arches opened in Phoenix, Arizona in March 1953. The original mascot of McDonald's was a man with a chef's hat on top of a hamburger-shaped head whose name was [...] "Speedee". In 1962, the Golden Arches replaced Speedee as the company symbol. A new mascot, Ronald McDonald, was introduced in 1965. The clown-like man having <b>puffed</b> <b>out</b> costume legs appeared in advertising aimed at children.|$|E
2500|$|Channing {{made her}} {{television}} debut on Sesame Street {{in the role}} of The Number Painter's female victim. She landed her first leading role in the 1973 television movie The Girl Most Likely to..., a black comedy written by Joan Rivers about an ugly duckling woman made newly beautiful by plastic surgery after an auto accident vows murderous revenge on all who had scorned her. For the role, Channing went through considerable transformation, with the syndicated column [...] "TV Scout" [...] reporting months later, [...] "It was a great make-up job — at least the part that made very pretty Stockard look so ugly. She had her cheeks <b>puffed</b> <b>out</b> with cotton and her nose was wadded, too, to make it thick and off-center. Very thick eyebrows were drawn on her face and she wore padded clothes to make her look fat. Making her look beautiful was easy." [...] The TV movie has gone on to enjoy cult status, becoming available on DVD in 2005.|$|E
60|$|And Senor Fuentes, <b>puffing</b> <b>out</b> his {{leathery}} cheeks, had inclined {{his head}} slightly to the left, letting a thin, bluish jet of smoke escape through his pursed lips. He had understood.|$|R

50|$|Some more {{aggressive}} cockerels will drop and extend both wings and <b>puff</b> <b>out</b> all their body feathers {{to give the}} hens or other cocks {{the impression of a}} larger size, and charge through the hen yard.|$|R
6000|$|... "Do {{you call}} that a little repast?" [...] said Madden, who was lying {{back in his chair}} with a cigar in his mouth, of which he hardly had {{strength}} enough left to <b>puff</b> <b>out</b> the smoke.|$|R
60|$|Mr Verloc, <b>puffing</b> <b>out</b> his cheeks, let the {{air escape}} violently, {{and that was}} all. He had armed himself with patience. It {{was not to be}} tried much longer. The First Secretary became {{suddenly}} very curt, detached, final.|$|R
60|$|His pipe was started, and he <b>puffed</b> <b>out</b> dense {{volumes of}} smoke {{with an air}} of keen enjoyment.|$|E
60|$|But Mr. Goshawk said nothing, just {{winked at}} Bobby Coon, <b>puffed</b> <b>out</b> his feathers, and settled {{himself for a}} {{comfortable}} nap.|$|E

50|$|Voluntary facial movements, such as {{wrinkling}} the brow, showing teeth, frowning, {{closing the}} eyes tightly (inability {{to do so}} is called lagophthalmos), pursing the lips and <b>puffing</b> <b>out</b> the cheeks, all test the facial nerve. There should be no noticeable asymmetry.|$|R
60|$|René {{produced}} a pipe, filled and lighted it, then placed a chair {{so that he}} could sit across it and lean upon the back. He sat for upwards of {{a quarter of an hour}} <b>puffing</b> <b>out</b> clouds of tobacco-smoke without speaking.|$|R
6000|$|But Stalky <b>puffed</b> <b>out</b> {{his cheeks}} and squinted down his nose {{in the style of}} Panurge, and all he said was, [...] "Oh, you abject burblers!" ...|$|E
