40|$|Abstract — One key {{challenge}} {{for increasing the}} throughput of future wireless local area networks at higher layers is matching {{the capabilities of the}} physical (PHY) layer with the need of exchanging small control messages at these higher layers. The bottleneck in this regard lies at the medium access control (MAC) layer that may waste considerable channel resources in the transmission of these small packets. In this contribution we introduce superposed signaling, a PHY layer extension that opens up a new way to map small packets to the channel while reducing inefficient use of the medium. This scheme provides a low-rate <b>signaling</b> <b>sublayer</b> at the PHY level in addition to a high-rate data sublayer. These sublayers share the channel by a variant of multi-carrier code-division multiple access (MC-CDMA). We investigate the design of receivers that are capable of detecting the <b>signals</b> of both <b>sublayers,</b> and focus on a structure employing successive interference cancellation (SIC). Our main interest is in identifying the operation modes in terms of per-user powers in which it is possible to use these receivers. Furthermore, it will be shown that the scheme is appropriate for sublayer-synchronous as well as asynchronous scenarios...|$|R

In the system, we can simultaneously measure <b>physical</b> <b>signals</b> derived from the circulatory system, such as ECG, photoplethysmography and pulse waves, which were all built-up by students. The system consists of 10 personal computers（PCs）controlled by one server computer. Each PC is operated with Windows 2000 and XP（Microsoft）. A laboratory virtual instrument engineering workbench（LabVIEW）developed by nationalinstruments（NI）is installed in each PC. LabVIEW is a graphic program development system which enabled acquition, analysis and recording of actual data with the use of virtual instruments（VI）. <b>Physical</b> <b>signals</b> from several measuring instruments are input into a data acquisition board（DAQ, PCI-MIO- 16 E- 1, NI) via a BNC terminal box （BNC- 2090, NI）.

40|$|Abstract The {{wireless}} {{sensor network}} (WSN), {{is a type of}} self-organized distribution system without complex infrastructure requirement. However, WSN’s independence and un-attended usage limit its power supply and life expectancy. These become a critical issue for any WSN implementation. The in-network processing which, intends to minify data volume locally can greatly reduce the energy consumption of data delivery over a long distance to the sink. However, open problems are still remain with in-network processing, such as how to carry out in-network processing, and how to combine routing scheme to the sink (e. g. the long distance delivery). For any WSN application, the following pre-assumption is vital. There exists a <b>physical</b> <b>signal</b> field which bridges physical events to the sensors of WSN, otherwise WSN does not work. In fact, the <b>physical</b> <b>signal</b> field can be depicted by sensory data of all the nodes, and can even be used for local data convergence (e. g. in-network processing). An immediate solution which we propose is that, sensory data of the nodes can be converged to local extremes of the <b>physical</b> <b>signal</b> field along its gradient direction. Furthermore, the <b>physical</b> <b>signal</b> field is integrated with the cost field routing scheme. The cost field routing is in charge of delivering data to the sink. During the in-network processing, the delivery direction is derived by combining linearly the gradient directions of the cost field and <b>physical</b> <b>signal</b> field. Also simulation results show that the proposed schemes are robust, adaptable, and reliable to the variation of physical events...|$|R

40|$|A {{computer}} implemented <b>physical</b> <b>signal</b> analysis method includes four basic steps {{and the associated}} presentation techniques of the results. The first step is a {{computer implemented}} Empirical Mode Decomposition that extracts a collection of Intrinsic Mode Functions (IMF) from nonlinear, nonstationary <b>physical</b> <b>signals.</b> The decomposition {{is based on the}} direct extraction of the energy associated with various intrinsic time scales in the <b>physical</b> <b>signal.</b> Expressed in the IMF's, they have well-behaved Hilbert Transforms from which instantaneous frequencies can be calculated. The second step is the Hilbert Transform which produces a Hilbert Spectrum. Thus, the invention can localize any event on the time as well as the frequency axis. The decomposition can also be viewed as an expansion of the data in terms of the IMF's. Then, these IMF's, based on and derived from the data, can serve as the basis of that expansion. The local energy and the instantaneous frequency derived from the IMF's through the Hilbert transform give a full energy-frequency-time distribution of the data which is designated as the Hilbert Spectrum. The third step filters the <b>physical</b> <b>signal</b> by combining a subset of the IMFs. In the fourth step, a curve may be fitted to the filtered signal which may not have been possible with the original, unfiltered signal...|$|R

40|$|The {{signals that}} {{initiate}} cell invasion {{are not well}} understood, but there is increasing evidence that extracellular <b>physical</b> <b>signals</b> play an important role. Here we show that epithelial cell invasion in the intestine of zebrafish meltdown (mlt) mutants arises in response to unregulated contractile tone in the surrounding smooth muscle cell layer. <b>Physical</b> <b>signaling</b> in mlt drives formation of membrane protrusions within the epithelium that resemble invadopodia, matrix-degrading protrusions present in invasive cancer cells. Knockdown of Tks 5, a Src substrate that is required for invadopodia formation in mammalian cells blocked formation of the protrusions and rescued invasion in mlt. Activation of Src-signaling induced invadopodia-like protrusions in wild type epithelial cells, however the cells did not migrate into the tissue stroma, thus indicating that the protrusions were required but not sufficient for invasion in this in vivo model. Transcriptional profiling experiments showed that genes responsive to reactive oxygen species (ROS) were upregulated in mlt larvae. ROS generators induced invadopodia-like protrusions and invasion in heterozygous mlt larvae but had no effect in wild type larvae. Co-activation of oncogenic Ras and Wnt signaling enhanced the responsiveness of mlt heterozygotes to the ROS generators. These findings present the first direct evidence that invadopodia {{play a role in}} tissue cell invasion in vivo. In addition, they identify an inducible <b>physical</b> <b>signaling</b> pathway sensitive to redox and oncogenic signaling that can driv...|$|R
