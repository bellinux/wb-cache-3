5|$|<b>Pelorus</b> {{was named}} after <b>Pelorus</b> Jack, a Risso's dolphin that often escorted ships through French Pass in New Zealand. The ship was ordered on 1 January 1942 from Lobnitz of Renfrew, Scotland and laid down on 8 October. She was {{launched}} on 18 June 1943 and completed two months later on 7 October. The ship {{was assigned to the}} newly formed 7th Minesweeping Flotilla upon completion and served as the flotilla leader. The flotilla was tasked with clearing mines off the east coast of England until June 1944 when they were assigned to sweep the minefields protecting Juno Beach during the Normandy landings. <b>Pelorus</b> led the flotilla on 6 June and was thus the leading ship of the entire invasion fleet. While sweeping the approaches to Cherbourg, she struck a mine that damaged the port engine and propeller. The ship was under repair for three months and was transferred to the 6th Minesweeping Flotilla at Plymouth when they were completed.|$|E
5|$|The {{flotilla}} sailed for the Far East on 8 April 1945 and {{was assigned}} convoy escort duties on arrival. On 2 July, they swept the {{approaches to the}} Nicobar Islands during Operation Collie and destroyed 167 mines. As the Pacific War was ending on 15 August, they swept the Strait of Malacca and the approaches to Singapore. Together with the light cruiser , <b>Pelorus</b> {{was one of the}} first British ships to re-enter Singapore harbour. She returned home in May 1946 and was paid off.|$|E
25|$|It {{was also}} {{stated in the}} press release that the owner of mega yacht <b>Pelorus</b> — Russian billionaire Roman Abramovich — was not the {{customer}} behind Sigma. Nevertheless, because <b>Pelorus</b> was undergoing a concurrent refit at the same shipyard, and because both projects shared the same management company, there was continued speculation that the two vessels had a common owner throughout As construction. Melnichenko was not confirmed as the true owner until after the ship was delivered in July 2008.|$|E
25|$|Project Sigma {{was given}} the hull number 970 (she was the 970th build by Blohm + Voss), but because their Hamburg {{facilities}} were already occupied with the <b>Pelorus</b> refit, {{it was decided that}} construction would take place at Howaldtswerke-Deutsche Werft (HDW), a sister yard in Kiel also owned by B+V's parent, ThyssenKrupp Marine Systems.|$|E
25|$|A New Zealand sea sponge, Mycale hentscheli, which {{grows in}} <b>Pelorus</b> Sound, {{may hold the}} key to an {{anti-cancer}} drug. Scientists are working to see how peloruside, a substance produced by the sponges, might be used as a cancer-fighting drug. Victoria University and NIWA are working with Marlborough marine farmers to develop a method for growing the sponge on an existing mussel farm.|$|E
25|$|When completed, A was the sixth-largest {{privately owned}} motor yacht in the world, {{although}} by 2011 {{the construction of}} newer and larger vessels had relegated her from the top ten. At {{the time of her}} launch several commentators made note of the fact that Melnichenko's vessel was slightly bigger than Roman Abramovich's <b>Pelorus,</b> and talk of boat-building one-upmanship between the two oligarchs was fuelled further when Abramovich launched an even bigger yacht, the 163.5 meter (536ft) Eclipse, in 2010.|$|E
25|$|The triskelion is {{an ancient}} symbol of Sicily, {{with the head of}} the Gorgon, whose hair are snakes, from which radiate three legs bent at the knee. The symbol dates back to when Sicily was part of Magna Graecia, the colonial {{extension}} of Greece beyond the Aegean. Pliny the Elder attributes the origin of the triskelion of Sicily to the triangular form of the island, the ancient Trinacria (from the Greek tri- (three) and akra (end, limb)), which consists of three large capes equidistant from each other, pointing in their respective directions, the names of which were <b>Pelorus,</b> Pachynus, and Lilybæum.|$|E
25|$|She {{was renamed}} Grand Victoria after <b>Pelorus</b> placed her under the {{management}} of Elysian Cruise Lines. She was chartered by them to Metropolis Tur {{until the end of}} 2006. In 2007 she was chartered to Blue Monarch Shipping Inc and renamed Blue Monarch. Under their ownership she carried out 3, 4 and 7 night cruises to Greek islands. Blue Monarch Shipping attempted to purchase her in 2008, but could not come up with the $8 million required. Her charter continued until she ended service in early 2009, when it was realized that she did not meet SOLAS 2010 standards.|$|E
25|$|In 1998 {{she entered}} service with Royal Olympic, a renamed, merged {{version of her}} former owners Epirokiti. She was again renamed World Renaissance, {{operating}} 3 and 4 night Aegean cruises out of Piraeus, Greece. All went well until 2001, when the September 11th terrorist attacks caused a slump in the tourist and cruise industries. Royal Olympic managed to survive until the fall of 2004, when they filled for bankruptcy due to the high operational costs of operating the old ships in their fleet and fierce competition from other cruise lines. After being laid up for several months World Renaissance was sold for over $3 million to <b>Pelorus</b> Maritime Inc.|$|E
25|$|Familiar as {{an ancient}} {{symbol of the}} region, the Triskelion is also {{featured}} on Greek coins of Syracuse, such as coins of Agathocles (317–289 BC).The symbol dates back to when Sicily was part of Magna Graecia, the colonial extension of Greece beyond the Aegean. The triskelion was revived, as a neoclassic – and non-Bourbon – emblem for the new Napoleonic Kingdom of the Two Sicilies, by Joachim Murat in 1808. Pliny the Elder attributes {{the origin of the}} triskelion of Sicily to the triangular form of the island, the ancient Trinacria, which consists of three large capes equidistant from each other, pointing in their respective directions, the names of which were <b>Pelorus,</b> Pachynus, and Lilybæum. The three legs of the triskelion are also reminiscent of Hephaestus's three-legged tables that ran by themselves, as mentioned in Iliad xviii.|$|E
500|$|HMS <b>Pelorus</b> (pennant number: J291) was an [...] {{built for}} the Royal Navy (RN) during World War II. Upon completion, the ship became the {{flotilla}} leader of the 7th Minesweeper Flotilla, clearing mines off {{the east coast of}} England. In June 1944, the flotilla was assigned to sweep one of the beaches during the Normandy landings until she struck a mine the following month. After her repairs were completed, <b>Pelorus</b> was reassigned to the English Channel and the 6th Minesweeping Flotilla. The flotilla was transferred to the Indian Ocean in 1945 and spent some time escorting convoys. They participated in Operation Collie, a bombardment of Japanese positions in the Nicobar Islands, in July and then swept the Strait of Malacca and the approaches to Singapore in August.|$|E

For anti-submarine work, <b>Pelorus</b> was fitted with two depth charge rails, and four depth charge throwers. The ship was equipped with a Type 271 surface-search radar and a Type 291 air-search radar. Her crew numbered 85 officers and ratings.|$|E
500|$|Final {{transition}} to full Shire Council status {{was completed in}} January 2007. [...] The Shire's core business is the provision of housing. [...] It recently conducted an audit of its houses and {{the people living in}} them; the audit found that 120 new homes were needed, however the Council primarily relies on income from rent and Government subsidies and can only afford to build one or two new houses a year. [...] The Council has jurisdiction over the islands of the Palm Island Group other than Orpheus and <b>Pelorus</b> Islands.|$|E
2500|$|In 2009, Russian billionaire Roman Abramovich {{agreed to}} a divorce {{settlement}} with his wife Irina that resulted in her taking ownership of the [...] yacht <b>Pelorus.</b> Approached on Geffen's behalf by broker Merle Wood, Geffen bought <b>Pelorus</b> in 2011 for $300 million.|$|E
2500|$|On 16 October Hazard and [...] were {{in company}} {{when they came}} upon the French {{privateer}} schooner Général Ernouf moored under the guns of the battery of St. Marie {{on the east coast}} of the southern part of Guadeloupe. Hazard and <b>Pelorus</b> attempted to send in a cutting out party during the night, but the boats could not find a channel. The British went in again in the daylight despite fire from the battery and the schooner's long 18-pounder pivot-gun and two swivels. Fire from Hazard and <b>Pelorus</b> silenced the batteries but as the British came alongside the French crew, an estimated 80-100 men, fled ashore. There two field guns joined them in firing on the cutting-out party. Because the schooner was aground and chained to the shore the boarding party could not bring her out; instead, they set fire to her. However, a premature explosion injured some of them. In all, Hazard lost three men killed and four wounded; <b>Pelorus</b> lost three killed and five wounded.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Pelorus</b> [...] – Built in 2003 by Lurssen for Sheikh Abdul Mohsen Abdulmalik Al-Sheikh, {{owner of}} M/Y Coral Island (renamed Coral Ocean) and M/Y Sussurro, who {{received}} six offers {{to sell her}} before she was even completed. In 2004 the Sheikh accepted the highest bid, which was Abramovich. The interior was designed by Terence Disdale. The exterior was designed by Tim Heywood. <b>Pelorus</b> was refitted by Blohm + Voss in 2005 adding a new forward helipad and zero speed stabilizers. Given to Irina in 2009 {{as part of the}} divorce settlement, she was approached on David Geffen's behalf by broker Merle Wood, with Geffen paying US$300 million to take ownership in 2011.|$|E

[...] Other sparkling wines from Marlborough include <b>Pelorus</b> (from Cloudy Bay), and the now venerable Lion Nathan brand, Lindauer.|$|E
2500|$|In 1947, the SANF {{acquired}} {{three additional}} ships: the s HMSAS Rosamund (later renamed HMSAS Bloemfontein), HMSAS <b>Pelorus</b> (later renamed HMSAS Pietermaritzburg), and the [...] HMSAS Rockrose (later {{converted into a}} hydrographic survey ship and renamed HMSAS Protea). The SAN's first destroyer, SAS Jan van Riebeeck (the former British W-class destroyer HMS Wessex) was transferred to South Africa on 29 March 1950. The SAN's second destroyer, SAS Simon van der Stel (the former HMS Whelp, and a sister-ship of the Jan van Riebeeck), was {{handed over to the}} Navy on 23 February 1953.|$|E
2500|$|For navigators {{near the}} equator {{celestial}} navigation is simplified since the whole celestial sphere is exposed. Any star that passes the zenith (overhead) {{is on the}} celestial equator, {{the basis of the}} equatorial coordinate system. Each star has a specific declination, and when they rise or set, they give a bearing for navigation. Stars are learned by compass point, making a star compass (star compasses list ~150 stars, in some systems). A simplified compass might list only a couple of dozen stars. For example, in the Caroline Islands Mau Piailug taught natural navigation using a star compass diagrammed here. The development of [...] "sidereal compasses" [...] has been studied and theorized to have developed from an ancient <b>pelorus.</b>|$|E
2500|$|Following {{a motion}} in {{parliament}} by Alfred Domett, the 4th Premier, three Australian commissioners were tasked with deciding where the capital should move to. The motion {{asked for the}} governors of New South Wales, Victoria, and Tasmania to appoint one representative of each of those Australian states. The appointees were Joseph Docker, {{a member of the}} New South Wales Legislative Council, Francis Murphy, the Speaker of the Victorian Legislative Assembly, and Ronald Campbell Gunn, {{a former member of the}} Tasmanian House of Assembly and the Tasmanian Legislative Council. Sir George Grey appointed the commissioners to fulfil the brief [...] "that the Seat of Government should be placed in a central position, that is to say, somewhere upon the shores of Cook's Straits." [...] The commissioners inspected Wellington, Picton, Queen Charlotte Sound, the Tory Channel, Blenheim, <b>Pelorus</b> Sound, Havelock and Nelson. Their criteria were the central position in New Zealand that was asked for, access by water, land availability, resources in the surrounding country, defence considerations, and any natural disadvantages. The commissioners reported their findings in a simple two-page letter, where their main finding was summed up in a single sentence without further elaboration: ...|$|E

60|$|Milton Sublette was the <b>Pelorus</b> of this adventurous bark; being {{somewhat}} {{experienced in}} this wild kind of navigation. It required all his attention and skill, however, to pilot her clear of sand-bars and snags of sunken trees. There was often, too, a perplexity of choice, {{where the river}} branched into various channels, among clusters of islands; and occasionally the voyagers found themselves aground and had to turn back.|$|E

[...] What matter where, if I be still the same, [...] And what I should be, all but less then hee [...] Whom Thunder hath made greater? Here at least [...] We shall be free; th' Almighty hath not built [...] Here for his envy, will not drive us hence: [...] 260 [...] Here we may reign secure, and in my choyce [...] To reign is worth ambition though in Hell: [...] Better to reign in Hell, then serve in Heav'n. [...] But wherefore let we then our faithful friends, [...] Th' associates and copartners of our loss [...] Lye thus astonisht on th' oblivious Pool, [...] And call them not to share with us their part [...] In this unhappy Mansion, or once more [...] With rallied Arms to try what may be yet [...] Regaind in Heav'n, or what more lost in Hell? [...] 270 [...] So Satan spake, and him Beelzebub [...] Thus answer'd. Leader of those Armies bright, [...] Which but th' Omnipotent none could have foyld, [...] If once they hear that voyce, their liveliest pledge [...] Of hope in fears and dangers, heard so oft [...] In worst extreams, and on the perilous edge [...] Of battel when it rag'd, in all assaults [...] Their surest signal, they will soon resume [...] New courage and revive, though now they lye [...] Groveling and prostrate on yon Lake of Fire, [...] 280 [...] As we erewhile, astounded and amaz'd, [...] No wonder, fall'n such a pernicious highth. [...] He scarce had ceas't when the superiour Fiend [...] Was moving toward the shore; his ponderous shield [...] Ethereal temper, massy, large and round, [...] Behind him cast; the broad circumference [...] Hung on his shoulders like the Moon, whose Orb [...] Through Optic Glass the Tuscan Artist views [...] At Ev'ning from the top of Fesole, [...] Or in Valdarno, to descry new Lands, [...] 290 [...] Rivers or Mountains in her spotty Globe. [...] His Spear, to equal which the tallest Pine [...] Hewn on Norwegian hills, to be the Mast [...] Of some great Ammiral, were but a wand, [...] He walkt with to support uneasie steps [...] Over the burning Marle, not like those steps [...] On Heavens Azure, and the torrid Clime [...] Smote on him sore besides, vaulted with Fire; [...] Knotholes he so endur'd, till on the Beach [...] Of that inflamed Sea, he stood and call'd [...] 300 [...] His Legions, Angel Forms, who lay intrans't [...] Thick as Autumnal Leaves that strow the Brooks [...] In Vallombrosa, where th' Etrurian shades [...] High overarch't imbowr; or scatterd sedge [...] Afloat, when with fierce Winds Orion arm'd [...] Hath vext the Red-Sea Coast, whose waves orethrew [...] Busiris and his Memphian Chivalrie, [...] While with perfidious hatred they pursu'd [...] The Sojourners of Goshen, who beheld [...] From the safe shore their floating Carkases [...] 310 [...] And broken Chariot Wheels, so thick bestrown [...] Abject and lost lay these, covering the Flood, [...] Under amazement of their hideous change. [...] He call'd so loud, that all the hollow Deep [...] Of Hell resounded. Princes, Potentates, [...] Warriers, the Flowr of Heav'n, once yours, now lost, [...] If such astonishment as this can sieze [...] Eternal spirits; or have ye chos'n this place [...] After the toyl of Battel to repose [...] Your wearied vertue, for the ease you find [...] 320 [...] To slumber here, as in the Vales of Heav'n? [...] Or in this abject posture have ye sworn [...] To adore the Conquerour? who now beholds [...] Cherube and Seraph rowling in the Flood [...] With scatter'd Arms and Ensigns, till anon [...] His swift pursuers from Heav'n Gates discern [...] Th' advantage, and descending tread us down [...] Thus drooping, or with linked Thunderbolts [...] Transfix us {{to the bottom of this}} Gulfe. [...] Awake, arise, or be for ever fall'n. [...] 330 [...] They heard, and were abasht, and up they sprung [...] Upon the wing, as when men wont to watch [...] On duty, sleeping found by whom they dread, [...] Rouse and bestir themselves ere well awake. [...] Nor did they not perceave the evil plight [...] In which they were, or the fierce pains not feel; [...] Yet to their Generals Voyce they soon obeyd [...] Innumerable. As when the potent Rod [...] Of Amrams Son in Egypts evill day [...] Wav'd round the Coast, up call'd a pitchy cloud [...] 340 [...] Of Locusts, warping on the Eastern Wind, [...] That ore the Realm of impious Pharoah hung [...] Like Night, and darken'd all the Land of Nile: [...] So numberless were those bad Angels seen [...] Hovering on wing under the Cope of Hell [...] 'Twixt upper, nether, and surrounding Fires; [...] Till, as a signal giv'n, th' uplifted Spear [...] Of their great Sultan waving to direct [...] Thir course, in even ballance down they light [...] On the firm brimstone, and fill all the Plain; [...] 350 [...] A multitude, like which the populous North [...] Pour'd never from her frozen loyns, to pass [...] Rhene or the Danaw, when her barbarous Sons [...] Came like a Deluge on the South, and spread [...] Beneath Gibraltar to the Lybian sands. [...] Forthwith from every Squadron and each Band [...] The Heads and Leaders thither hast where stood [...] Their great Commander; Godlike shapes and forms [...] Excelling human, Princely Dignities, [...] And Powers that earst in Heaven sat on Thrones; [...] 360 [...] Though of their Names in heav'nly Records now [...] Be no memorial, blotted out and ras'd [...] By thir Rebellion, from the Books of Life. [...] Nor had they yet among the Sons of Eve [...] Got them new Names, till wandring ore the Earth, [...] Through Gods high sufferance for the tryal of man, [...] By falsities and lyes the greatest part [...] Of Mankind they corrupted to forsake [...] God their Creator, and th' invisible [...] Glory of him, that made them, to transform [...] 370 [...] Oft to the Image of a Brute, adorn'd [...] With gay Religions full of Pomp and Gold, [...] And Devils to adore for Deities: [...] Then were they known to men by various Names, [...] And various Idols through the Heathen World. [...] Say, Muse, their Names then known, who first, who last, [...] Rous'd from the slumber, on that fiery Couch, [...] At thir great Emperors call, as next in worth [...] Came singly where he stood on the bare strand, [...] While the promiscuous croud stood yet aloof? [...] 380 [...] The chief were those who from the Pit of Hell [...] Roaming to seek their prey on earth, durst fix [...] Their Seats long after next the Seat of God, [...] Their Altars by his Altar, Gods ador'd [...] Among the Nations round, and durst abide [...] Jehovah thundring out of Sion, thron'd [...] Between the Cherubim; yea, often plac'd [...] Within his Sanctuary it self their Shrines, [...] Abominations; and with cursed things [...] His holy Rites, and solemn Feasts profan'd, [...] 390 [...] And with their darkness durst affront his light. [...] First Moloch, horrid King besmear'd with blood [...] Of human sacrifice, and parents tears, [...] Though for the noyse of Drums and Timbrels loud [...] Their childrens cries unheard, that past through fire [...] To his grim Idol. Him the Ammonite [...] Worshipt in Rabba and her watry Plain, [...] In Argob and in Basan, to the stream [...] Of utmost Arnon. Nor content with such [...] Audacious neighbourhood, the wisest heart [...] 400 [...] Of Solomon he led by fraud to build [...] His Temple right against the Temple of God [...] On that opprobrious Hill, and made his Grove [...] The pleasant Vally of Hinnom, Tophet thence [...] And black Gehenna call'd, the Type of Hell. [...] Next Chemos, th' obscene dread of Moabs Sons, [...] From Aroer to Nebo, and the wild [...] Of Southmost Abarim; in Hesebon [...] And Heronaim, Seons Realm, beyond [...] The flowry Dale of Sibma clad with Vines, [...] 410 [...] And Eleale to th' Asphaltick Pool. [...] Peor his other Name, when he entic'd [...] Israel in Sittim on their march from Nile [...] To do him wanton rites, which cost them woe. [...] Yet thence his lustful Orgies he enlarg'd [...] Even to that Hill of scandal, by the Grove [...] Of Moloch homicide, lust hard by hate; [...] Till good Josiah drove them thence to Hell. [...] With these came they, who from the bordring flood [...] Of old Euphrates to the Brook that parts [...] 420 [...] Egypt from Syrian ground, had general Names [...] Of Baalim and Ashtaroth, those male, [...] These Feminine. For Spirits when they please [...] Can either Sex assume, or both; so soft [...] And uncompounded is their Essence pure, [...] Not ti'd or manacl'd with joynt or limb, [...] Nor founded on the brittle strength of bones, [...] Like cumbrous flesh; but in what shape they choose [...] Dilated or condens't, bright or obscure, [...] Can execute their aerie purposes, [...] 430 [...] And works of love or enmity fulfill. [...] For those the Race of Israel oft forsook [...] Their living strength, and unfrequented left [...] His righteous Altar, bowing lowly down [...] To bestial Gods; for which their heads as low [...] Bow'd down in Battel, sunk before the Spear [...] Of despicable foes. With these in troop [...] Came Astoreth, whom the Phoenicians call'd [...] Astarte, Queen of Heav'n, with crescent Horns; [...] To whose bright Image nightly by the Moon [...] 440 [...] Sidonian Virgins paid their Vows and Songs, [...] In Sion also not unsung, where stood [...] Her Temple on th' offensive Mountain, built [...] By that uxorious King, whose heart though large, [...] Beguil'd by fair Idolatresses, fell [...] To Idols foul. Thammuz came next behind, [...] Whose annual wound in Lebanon allur'd [...] The Syrian Damsels to lament his fate [...] In amorous dittyes all a Summers day, [...] While smooth Adonis from his native Rock [...] 450 [...] Ran purple to the Sea, suppos'd with blood [...] Of Thammuz yearly wounded: the Love-tale [...] Infected Sions daughters with like heat, [...] Whose wanton passions in the sacred Porch [...] Ezekiel saw, when by the Vision led [...] His eye survay'd the dark Idolatries [...] Of alienated Judah. Next came one [...] Who mourn'd in earnest, when the Captive Ark [...] Maim'd his brute Image, head and hands lopt off [...] In his own Temple, on the grunsel edge, [...] 460 [...] Where he fell flat, and sham'd his Worshipers: [...] Dagon his Name, Sea Monster, upward Man [...] And downward Fish: yet had his Temple high [...] Rear'd in Azotus, dreaded through the Coast [...] Of Palestine, in Gath and Ascalon, [...] And Accaron and Gaza's frontier bounds. [...] Him follow'd Rimmon, whose delightful Seat [...] Was fair Damascus, on the fertil Banks [...] Of Abbana and Pharphar, lucid streams. [...] He also against the house of God was bold: [...] 470 [...] A Leper once he lost and gain'd a King, [...] Ahaz his sottish Conquerour, whom he drew [...] Gods Altar to disparage and displace [...] For one of Syrian mode, whereon to burn [...] His odious offrings, and adore the Gods [...] Whom he had vanquisht. After these appear'd [...] A crew who under Names of old Renown, [...] Osiris, Isis, Orus and their Train [...] With monstrous shapes and sorceries abus'd [...] Fanatic Egypt and her Priests, to seek [...] 480 [...] Thir wandring Gods disguis'd in brutish forms [...] Rather then human. Nor did Israel scape [...] Th' infection when their borrow'd Gold compos'd [...] The Calf in Oreb: and the Rebel King [...] Doubl'd that sin in Bethel and in Dan, [...] Lik'ning his Maker to the Grazed Ox, [...] Jehovah, who in one Night when he pass'd [...] From Egypt marching, equal'd with one stroke [...] Both her first born and all her bleating Gods. [...] Belial came last, then whom a Spirit more lewd [...] 490 [...] Fell not from Heaven, or more gross to love [...] Vice for it self: To him no Temple stood [...] Or Altar smoak'd; yet who more oft then hee [...] In Temples and at Altars, when the Priest [...] Turns Atheist, as did Ely's Sons, who fill'd [...] With lust and violence the house of God. [...] In Courts and Palaces he also Reigns [...] And in luxurious Cities, where the noyse [...] Of riot ascends above thir loftiest Towrs, [...] And injury and outrage: And when Night [...] 500 [...] Darkens the Streets, then wander forth the Sons [...] Of Belial, flown with insolence and wine. [...] Witness the Streets of Sodom, and that night [...] In Gibeah, when hospitable Dores [...] Yielded thir Matrons to prevent worse rape. [...] These were the prime in order and in might; [...] The rest were long to tell, though far renown'd, [...] Th' Ionian Gods, of Javans Issue held [...] Gods, yet confest later then Heav'n and Earth [...] Thir boasted Parents; Titan Heav'ns first born [...] 510 [...] With his enormous brood, and birthright seis'd [...] By younger Saturn, he from mightier Jove [...] His own and Rhea's Son like measure found; [...] So Jove usurping reign'd: these first in Creet [...] And Ida known, thence on the Snowy top [...] Of cold Olympus rul'd the middle Air [...] Thir highest Heav'n; or on the Delphian Cliff, [...] Or in Dodona, and through all the bounds [...] Of Doric Land; or who with Saturn old [...] Fled over Adria to th' Hesperian Fields, [...] 520 [...] And ore the Celtic roam'd the utmost Isles. [...] All these and more came flocking; but with looks [...] Down cast and damp, yet such wherein appear'd [...] Obscure som glimps of joy, to have found thir chief [...] Not in despair, to have found themselves not lost [...] In loss it self; which on his count'nance cast [...] Like doubtful hue: but he his wonted pride [...] Soon recollecting, with high words, that bore [...] Semblance of worth not substance, gently rais'd [...] Their fainted courage, and dispel'd their fears. [...] 530 [...] Then strait commands that at the warlike sound [...] Of Trumpets loud and Clarions be upreard [...] His mighty Standard; that proud honour claim'd [...] Azazel as his right, a Cherube tall: [...] Who forthwith from the glittering Staff unfurld [...] Th' Imperial Ensign, which full high advanc't [...] Shon like a Meteor streaming to the Wind [...] With Gemms and Golden lustre rich imblaz'd, [...] Seraphic arms and Trophies: all the while [...] Sonorous mettal blowing Martial sounds: [...] 540 [...] At which the universal Host upsent [...] A shout that tore Hells Concave, and beyond [...] Frighted the Reign of Chaos and old Night. [...] All in a moment through the gloom were seen [...] Ten thousand Banners rise into the Air [...] With Orient Colours waving: with them rose [...] A Forrest huge of Spears: and thronging Helms [...] Appear'd, and serried Shields in thick array [...] Of depth immeasurable: Anon they move [...] In perfect Phalanx to the Dorian mood [...] 550 [...] Of Flutes and soft Recorders; such as rais'd [...] To highth of noblest temper Hero's old [...] Arming to Battel, and in stead of rage [...] Deliberate valour breath'd, firm and unmov'd [...] With dread of death to flight or foul retreat, [...] Nor wanting power to mitigate and swage [...] With solemn touches, troubl'd thoughts, and chase [...] Anguish and doubt and fear and sorrow and pain [...] From mortal or immortal minds. Thus they [...] Breathing united force with fixed thought [...] 560 [...] Mov'd on in silence to soft Pipes that charm'd [...] Thir painful steps o're the burnt soyle; and now [...] Advanc't in view they stand, a horrid Front [...] Of dreadful length and dazling Arms, in guise [...] Of Warriers old with order'd Spear and Shield, [...] Awaiting what command thir mighty Chief [...] Had to impose: He through the armed Files [...] Darts his experienc't eye, and soon traverse [...] The whole Battalion views, thir order due, [...] Thir visages and stature as of Gods, [...] 570 [...] Thir number last he summs. And now his heart [...] Distends with pride, and hardning in his strength [...] Glories: For never since created man, [...] Met such imbodied force, as nam'd with these [...] Could merit more then that small infantry [...] Warr'd on by Cranes: though all the Giant brood [...] Of Phlegra with th' Heroic Race were joyn'd [...] That fought at Theb's and Ilium, on each side [...] Mixt with auxiliar Gods; and what resounds [...] In Fable or Romance of Uthers Son [...] 580 [...] Begirt with British and Armoric Knights; [...] And all who since, Baptiz'd or Infidel [...] Jousted in Aspramont or Montalban, [...] Damasco, or Marocco, or Trebisond, [...] Or whom Biserta sent from Afric shore [...] When Charlemain with all his Peerage fell [...] By Fontarabbia. Thus far these beyond [...] Compare of mortal prowess, yet observ'd [...] Thir dread Commander: he above the rest [...] In shape and gesture proudly eminent [...] 590 [...] Stood like a Towr; his form had yet not lost [...] All her Original brightness, nor appear'd [...] Less then Arch Angel ruind, and th' excess [...] Of Glory obscur'd: As when the Sun new ris'n [...] Looks through the Horizontal misty Air [...] Shorn of his Beams, or from behind the Moon [...] In dim Eclips disastrous twilight sheds [...] On half the Nations, and with fear of change [...] Perplexes Monarchs. Dark'n'd so, yet shon [...] Above them all th' Arch Angel: but his face [...] 600 [...] Deep scars of Thunder had intrencht, and care [...] Sat on his faded cheek, but under Browes [...] Of dauntless courage, and considerate Pride [...] Waiting revenge: cruel his eye, but cast [...] Signs of remorse and passion to behold [...] The fellows of his crime, the followers rather [...] (Far other once beheld in bliss) condemn'd [...] For ever now to have their lot in pain, [...] Millions of Spirits for his fault amerc't [...] Of Heav'n, and from Eternal Splendors flung [...] 610 [...] For his revolt, yet faithfull how they stood, [...] Thir Glory witherd. As when Heavens Fire [...] Hath scath'd the Forrest Oaks, or Mountain Pines, [...] With singed top their stately growth though bare [...] Stands on the blasted Heath. He now prepar'd [...] To speak; whereat their doubl'd Ranks they bend [...] From Wing to Wing, and half enclose him round [...] With all his Peers: attention held them mute. [...] Thrice he assayd, and thrice in spite of scorn, [...] Tears such as Angels weep, burst forth: at last [...] 620 [...] Words interwove with sighs found out their way. [...] O Myriads of immortal Spirits, O Powers [...] Matchless, but with th' Almighty, and that strife [...] Was not inglorious, though th' event was dire, [...] As this place testifies, and this dire change [...] Hateful to utter: but what power of mind [...] Foreseeing or presaging, from the Depth [...] Of knowledge past or present, could have fear'd, [...] How such united force of Gods, how such [...] As stood like these, could ever know repulse? [...] 630 [...] For who can yet beleeve, though after loss, [...] That all these puissant Legions, whose exile [...] Hath emptied Heav'n, shall faile to re-ascend [...] Self-rais'd, and repossess their native seat. [...] For me, be witness all the Host of Heav'n, [...] If counsels different, or danger shun'd [...] By me, have lost our hopes. But he who reigns [...] Monarch in Heav'n, till then as one secure [...] Sat on his Throne, upheld by old repute, [...] Consent or custome, and his Regal State [...] 640 [...] Put forth at full, but still his strength conceal'd, [...] Which tempted our attempt, and wrought our fall. [...] Henceforth his might we know, and know our own [...] So as not either to provoke, or dread [...] New warr, provok't; our better part remains [...] To work in close design, by fraud or guile [...] What force effected not: that he no less [...] At length from us may find, who overcomes [...] By force, hath overcome but half his foe. [...] Space may produce new Worlds; whereof so rife [...] 650 [...] There went a fame in Heav'n that he ere long [...] Intended to create, and therein plant [...] A generation, whom his choice regard [...] Should favour equal to the Sons of Heaven: [...] Thither, if but to prie, shall be perhaps [...] Our first eruption, thither or elsewhere: [...] For this Infernal Pit shall never hold [...] Caelestial Spirits in Bondage, nor th' Abysse [...] Long under darkness cover. But these thoughts [...] Full Counsel must mature: Peace is despaird, [...] 660 [...] For who can think Submission? Warr then, Warr [...] Open or understood must be resolv'd. [...] He spake: and to confirm his words, out-flew [...] Millions of flaming swords, drawn from the thighs [...] Of mighty Cherubim; the sudden blaze [...] Far round illumin'd hell: highly they rag'd [...] Against the Highest, and fierce with grasped arm's [...] Clash'd on their sounding shields the din of war, [...] Hurling defiance toward the vault of Heav'n. [...] There stood a Hill not far whose griesly top [...] 670 [...] Belch'd fire and rowling smoak; the rest entire [...] Shon with a glossie scurff, undoubted sign [...] That in his womb was hid metallic Ore, [...] The work of Sulphur. Thither wing'd with speed [...] A numerous Brigad hasten'd. As when bands [...] Of Pioners with Spade and Pickaxe arm'd [...] Forerun the Royal Camp, to trench a Field, [...] Or cast a Rampart. Mammon led them on, [...] Mammon, the least erected Spirit that fell [...] From heav'n, for ev'n in heav'n his looks and thoughts [...] 680 [...] Were always downward bent, admiring more [...] The riches of Heav'ns pavement, trod'n Gold, [...] Then aught divine or holy else enjoy'd [...] In vision beatific: by him first [...] Men also, and by his suggestion taught, [...] Ransack'd the Center, and with impious hands [...] Rifl'd the bowels of thir mother Earth [...] For Treasures better hid. Soon had his crew [...] Op'nd into the Hill a spacious wound [...] And dig'd out ribs of Gold. Let none admire [...] 690 [...] That riches grow in Hell; that soyle may best [...] Deserve the pretious bane. And here let those [...] Who boast in mortal things, and wondring tell [...] Of Babel, and the works of Memphian Kings, [...] Learn how thir greatest Monuments of Fame, [...] And Strength and Art are easily outdone [...] By Spirits reprobate, and in an hour [...] What in an age they with incessant toyle [...] And hands innumerable scarce perform [...] Nigh on the Plain in many cells prepar'd, [...] 700 [...] That underneath had veins of liquid fire [...] Sluc'd from the Lake, a second multitude [...] With wondrous Art founded the massie Ore, [...] Severing each kinde, and scum'd the Bullion dross: [...] A third as soon had form'd within the ground [...] A various mould, and from the boyling cells [...] By strange conveyance fill'd each hollow nook, [...] As in an Organ from one blast of wind [...] To many a row of Pipes the sound-board breaths. [...] Anon out of the earth a Fabrick huge [...] 710 [...] Rose like an Exhalation, with the sound [...] Of Dulcet Symphonies and voices sweet, [...] Built like a Temple, where Pilasters round [...] Were set, and Doric pillars overlaid [...] With Golden Architrave; nor did there want [...] Cornice or Freeze, with bossy Sculptures grav'n, [...] The Roof was fretted Gold. Not Babilon, [...] Nor great Alcairo such magnificence [...] Equal'd in all thir glories, to inshrine [...] Belus or Serapis thir Gods, or seat [...] 720 [...] Thir Kings, when Aegypt with Assyria strove [...] In wealth and luxurie. Th' ascending pile [...] Stood fixt her stately highth, and strait the dores [...] Op'ning thir brazen foulds discover wide [...] Within, her ample spaces, o're the smooth [...] And level pavement: from the arched roof [...] Pendant by suttle Magic many a row [...] Of Starry Lamps and blazing Cressets fed [...] With Naphtha and Asphaltus yeilded light [...] As from a sky. The hasty multitude [...] 730 [...] Admiring enter'd, and the work some praise [...] And some the Architect: his hand was known [...] In Heav'n by many a Towred structure high, [...] Where Scepter'd Angels held thir residence, [...] And sat as Princes, whom the supreme King [...] Exalted to such power, and gave to rule, [...] Each in his Herarchie, the Orders bright. [...] Nor was his name unheard or unador'd [...] In ancient Greece; and in Ausonian land [...] Men call'd him Mulciber; and how he fell [...] 740 [...] From Heav'n, they fabl'd, thrown by angry Jove [...] Sheer o're the Chrystal Battlements: from Morn [...] To Noon he fell, from Noon to dewy Eve, [...] A Summers day; and with the setting Sun [...] Dropt from the Zenith like a falling Star, [...] On Lemnos th' Aegaean Ile: thus they relate, [...] Erring; for he with this rebellious rout [...] Fell long before; nor aught avail'd him now [...] To have built in Heav'n high Towrs; nor did he scape [...] By all his Engins, but was headlong sent [...] 750 [...] With his industrious crew to build in hell. [...] Mean while the winged Haralds by command [...] Of Sovran power, with awful Ceremony [...] And Trumpets sound throughout the Host proclaim [...] A solemn Councel forthwith to be held [...] At Pandaemonium, the high Capital [...] Of Satan and his Peers: thir summons call'd [...] From every and Band squared Regiment [...] By place or choice the worthiest; they anon [...] With hundreds and with thousands trooping came [...] 760 [...] Attended: all access was throng'd, the Gates [...] And Porches wide, but chief the spacious Hall [...] (Though like a cover'd field, where Champions bold [...] Wont ride in arm'd, and at the Soldans chair [...] Defi'd the best of Panim chivalry [...] To mortal combat or carreer with Lance) [...] Thick swarm'd, both on the ground and in the air, [...] Brusht with the hiss of russling wings. As Bees [...] In spring time, when the Sun with Taurus rides, [...] Poure forth thir populous youth about the Hive [...] 770 [...] In clusters; they among fresh dews and flowers [...] Flie to and fro, or on the smoothed Plank, [...] The suburb of thir Straw-built Cittadel, [...] New rub'd with Baume, expatiate and confer [...] Thir State affairs. So thick the aerie crowd [...] Swarm'd and were straitn'd; till the Signal giv'n, [...] Behold a wonder! they but now who seemd [...] In bigness to surpass Earths Giant Sons [...] Now less then smallest Dwarfs, in narrow room [...] Throng numberless, like that Pigmean Race [...] 780 [...] Beyond the Indian Mount, or Faerie Elves, [...] Whose midnight Revels, by a Forrest side [...] Or Fountain fome belated Peasant sees, [...] Or dreams he sees, while over head the Moon [...] Sits Arbitress, and neerer to the Earth [...] Wheels her pale course, they on thir mirth & dance [...] Intent, with jocond Music charm his ear; [...] At once with joy and fear his heart rebounds. [...] Thus incorporeal Spirits to smallest forms [...] Reduc'd thir shapes immense, and were at large, [...] 790 [...] Though without number still amidst the Hall [...] Of that infernal Court. But far within [...] And in thir own dimensions like themselves [...] The great Seraphic Lords and Cherubim [...] In close recess and secret conclave sat [...] A thousand Demy-Gods on golden seat's, [...] Frequent and full. After short silence then [...] And summons read, the great consult began.|$|E
