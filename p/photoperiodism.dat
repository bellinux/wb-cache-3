25|$|Fundamental {{processes}} such as photosynthesis, respiration, plant nutrition, {{plant hormone}} functions, tropisms, nastic movements, <b>photoperiodism,</b> photomorphogenesis, circadian rhythms, environmental stress physiology, seed germination, dormancy and stomata function and transpiration, both parts of plant water relations, are studied by plant physiologists.|$|E
500|$|In 1903 Chlorophylls a and b were {{separated}} by thin layer chromatography then, through the 1920s and 1930s, biochemists, notably Hans Krebs (1900–1981) and Carl (1896–1984) and Gerty Cori (1896–1957) began tracing out the central metabolic pathways of life. Between the 1930s and 1950s {{it was determined that}} ATP, located in mitochondria, was the source of cellular chemical energy and the constituent reactions of photosynthesis were progressively revealed. Then, in 1944 DNA was extracted for the first time. Along with these revelations there was the discovery of plant hormones or [...] "growth substances", notably auxins, (1934) gibberellins (1934) and cytokinins (1964) and the effects of <b>photoperiodism,</b> the control of plant processes, especially flowering, by the relative lengths of day and night.|$|E
500|$|House sparrows express strong {{circadian}} {{rhythms of}} activity in the laboratory. They {{were among the first}} bird species to be seriously studied in terms of their circadian activity and <b>photoperiodism,</b> in part because of their availability and adaptability in captivity, but also because they can [...] "find their way" [...] and remain rhythmic in constant darkness. Such studies have found that the pineal gland is a central part of the house sparrow's circadian system: removal of the pineal eliminates the circadian rhythm of activity, and transplant of the pineal into another individual confers to this individual the rhythm phase of the donor bird. The suprachiasmatic nuclei of the hypothalamus have also been shown to be {{an important component of the}} circadian system of house sparrows. The photoreceptors involved in the synchronisation of the circadian clock to the external light-dark cycle are located in the brain and can be stimulated by light reaching them directly though the skull, as revealed by experiments in which blind sparrows, which normally can still synchronise to the light-dark cycle, failed to do so once India ink was injected as a screen under the skin on top of their skulls.|$|E
2500|$|Many {{flowering}} plants use the pigment phytochrome to sense seasonal changes in day length, which they take as signals to flower. This sensitivity to day length is termed <b>photoperiodism.</b> Broadly speaking, {{flowering plants}} {{can be classified}} as long day plants, short day plants, or day neutral plants, depending on their particular response to changes in day length. [...] Long day plants require a certain minimum length of daylight to starts flowering, so these plants flower in the spring or summer. Conversely, short day plants flower when the length of daylight falls below a certain critical level. Day neutral plants do not initiate flowering based on <b>photoperiodism,</b> though some may use temperature sensitivity (vernalization) instead.|$|E
2500|$|The most studied of the photoreceptors {{in plants}} is phytochrome. [...] It is {{sensitive}} to light in the red and far-red region of the visible spectrum. Many flowering plants use it to regulate the time of flowering based {{on the length of}} day and night (<b>photoperiodism)</b> and to set circadian rhythms. It also regulates other responses including the germination of seeds, elongation of seedlings, the size, shape and number of leaves, the synthesis of chlorophyll, and the straightening of the epicotyl or hypocotyl hook of dicot seedlings.|$|E
2500|$|Fourthly, plant physiologists {{study the}} ways that plants control or {{regulate}} internal functions. [...] Like animals, plants produce chemicals called hormones which are produced {{in one part of}} the plant to signal cells in another part of the plant to respond. [...] Many flowering plants bloom at the appropriate time because of light-sensitive compounds that respond to the length of the night, a phenomenon known as <b>photoperiodism.</b> [...] The ripening of fruit and loss of leaves in the winter are controlled in part by the production of the gas ethylene by the plant.|$|E
2500|$|As an {{unexpected}} {{benefit of the}} double wheat season, the new breeds did not have problems with <b>photoperiodism.</b> Normally, wheat varieties cannot adapt to new environments, due to the changing periods of sunlight. Borlaug later recalled, [...] "As it worked out, in the north, we were planting when the days were getting shorter, at low elevation and high temperature. Then we'd take the seed from the best plants south and plant it at high elevation, when days were getting longer and {{there was lots of}} rain. Soon we had varieties that fit the whole range of conditions. That wasn't supposed to happen by the books". This meant that the project would not need to start separate breeding programs for each geographic region of the planet.|$|E
50|$|<b>Photoperiodism</b> {{also has}} an effect on {{vegetative}} growth, including on bud dormancy in perennial plants, though this is not as well-documented as the effect of <b>photoperiodism</b> on the switch to the flowering stage.|$|E
50|$|<b>Photoperiodism</b> is the {{physiological}} reaction of organisms {{to the length}} of day or night. It occurs in plants and animals. <b>Photoperiodism</b> can also be defined as the developmental responses of plants to the relative lengths of light and dark periods.|$|E

50|$|Central to {{the hunt}} for florigen is an {{understanding}} of how plants use seasonal changes in day length to mediate flowering—a mechanism known as <b>photoperiodism.</b> Plants which exhibit <b>photoperiodism</b> may be either 'short day' or 'long day' plants, which in order to flower require short days or long days respectively, although plants in fact distinguish day length from night length.|$|E

50|$|Phototropism is {{the effect}} of light on plant growth that causes the plant to grow toward or away from the light. <b>Photoperiodism</b> is a plant’s {{response}} or capacity to respond to photoperiod, a recurring cycle of light and dark periods of constant length.|$|E
50|$|During World War II, Velasco {{conducted}} {{research on the}} <b>photoperiodism</b> of the rice plant. Among his findings, which were published only {{after the end of}} the war, was that the Elon-elon variety flowered during short days when there was less than 12 hours of light.|$|E
50|$|Day-neutral plants, such as cucumbers, roses, and tomatoes, do not {{initiate}} flowering {{based on}} <b>photoperiodism.</b> Instead, they may initiate flowering after attaining a certain overall developmental stage or age, or {{in response to}} alternative environmental stimuli, such as vernalisation (a period of low temperature).|$|E
50|$|The {{duration}} of light exposure {{is as important}} as the intensity. Quality exposure of 8 to 16 hours is ideal for most plants. <b>Photoperiodism</b> must also be considered, since some plants such as Poinsettia and Schlumbergera are influenced by either decreasing or increasing daylight hours.|$|E
50|$|The photomorphogenesis {{of plants}} is often studied by using tightly frequency-controlled light sources {{to grow the}} plants. There {{are at least three}} stages of plant {{development}} where photomorphogenesis occurs: seed germination, seedling development, and the switch from the vegetative to the flowering stage (<b>photoperiodism).</b>|$|E
5000|$|Erwin Bünning (23 January 1906 [...] - [...] 4 October 1990) was a German biologist. His {{most famous}} {{contributions}} {{were to the}} field of chronobiology, where he proposed a model for the endogenous circadian rhythms governing plant <b>photoperiodism.</b> From these contributions, Bünning is considered a co-founder of chronobiology along with Jürgen Aschoff and Colin Pittendrigh.|$|E
50|$|The Journal of Circadian Rhythms is a peer-reviewed {{open access}} {{scientific}} journal covering circadian and nycthemeral (daily) rhythms in living organisms, including processes associated with <b>photoperiodism</b> and daily torpor. It {{was established in}} 2003 and originally published by BioMed Central. Since 2015 it is published by Ubiquity Press. The editor-in-chief is Roberto Refinetti (Boise State University).|$|E
50|$|Cryptochromes {{are another}} type of {{photoreceptor}} that is important in <b>photoperiodism.</b> Cryptochromes absorb blue light and UV-A. Cryptochromes entrain the circadian clock to light. It {{has been found that}} both cryptochrome and phytochrome abundance relies on light and the amount of cryptochrome can change depending on day-length. This shows how important both of the photoreceptors are in regards to determining day-length.|$|E
5000|$|In addition, {{many plants}} also require both {{dark and light}} periods, an effect known as <b>photoperiodism,</b> to trigger flowering. Therefore, lights may be turned on or off at set times. The optimum photo/dark period ratio depends on the species and variety of plant, as some prefer long days and short nights and others prefer the {{opposite}} or intermediate [...] "day lengths".|$|E
50|$|Garden {{lighting}} can be {{an important}} aspect of garden design. In most cases, various types of lighting techniques may be classified and defined by heights: safety lighting, uplighting, and downlighting. Safety lighting is the most practical application. However, {{it is more important to}} determine the type of lamps and fittings needed to create the desired effects. Light regulates three major plant processes: photosynthesis, phototropism, and <b>photoperiodism.</b>|$|E
50|$|Greenhouse growers {{commonly}} exploit <b>photoperiodism</b> {{in plants}} to control whether {{the plants are}} in a vegetative or reproductive stage. As part of this control, growers will have the lights on past sunset and before sunrise or periodically throughout the night. Single story greenhouses are already a nuisance to neighbours because of light pollution, a 30-story vertical farm in a densely populated area will surely face problems because of its light pollution.|$|E
50|$|Modern {{biologists}} {{believe that}} it is the coincidence of the active forms of phytochrome or cryptochrome, created by light during the daytime, with the rhythms of the circadian clock that allows plants to measure the length of the night. Other than flowering, <b>photoperiodism</b> in plants includes the growth of stems or roots during certain seasons and the loss of leaves. Artificial lighting can be used to induce extra-long days.|$|E
50|$|The parrots wake up {{and sleep}} as per <b>Photoperiodism.</b> The Municipal Corporation of U.T., Chandigarh {{installed}} high post lights affecting the sleep pattern of the parrots.

The Wildlife Department, Chandigarh was apprised {{of the problem and}} the high post lights were switched off.|$|E
50|$|In 1930, Bünning took an {{assistantship}} under Otto Renner at the University of Jena, {{then one}} of Germany's largest botanical institutes. During {{the rise of the}} Nazi Party in Germany in the early 1930s, Renner stood in open opposition to the Nazis, publicly defending Jewish scientists. Similarly, Bünning was considered a communist sympathizer, a stance likely influenced by Bünning's father, a Social Democrat opposed to the Nazis. Bünning's political beliefs created tension between him and some of his students. In response to this tension, Bünning left Jena for a lectureship at the East Prussian University of Königsberg. In 1936, Bünning published his model for plant <b>photoperiodism,</b> wherein he proposed that endogenous (internal) circadian rhythms enable plants to measure day length. Bünning's model of <b>photoperiodism</b> would go largely unnoticed by the scientific community until 1960 when he chaired the 1960 Cold Spring Harbor Symposium on Biological Clocks. There, Colin Pittendrigh drew attention to Bünning's work and named his 1936 model on plant <b>photoperiodism</b> the Bünning hypothesis.In 1938, Bünning spent a year traveling through Java and Sumatra. His observations on the islands resulted in the book Tropische Regenwalder (Tropical Rainforests). Upon his return to Germany in 1939, Bünning was conscripted in the German military (World War II). Military authorities appointed Bünning as an associate professor at the University of Strasbourg. After the war, Bünning became a full professor at the University of Cologne in 1945 before moving to the University of Tübingen the next year (1946), where he stayed until his retirement in 1971. At Tübingen, Bünning entered into the workspace of his role model Wilhelm Pfeffer, the man who postulated in 1875 that the orientation of plants in space changes with the time of day. Bünning would later publish a biography on Pfeffer.|$|E
