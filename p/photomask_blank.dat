40|$|Variable {{angle of}} {{incidence}} spectroscopic ellipsometry (VASE) is commonly used for multilayer optical analysis, {{but in some cases}} this experiment (performed in reflection) does not provide sufficient information for the unique determination of the thicknesses and optical constants of the films in the given multilayer. We have found that augmenting the VASE data with data from other optical experiments greatly increases the amount of information which can be obtained for multilayers, particularly when they are deposited on transparent substrates. In this work, we describe a formalism which allows us to quantitatively characterize complex multilayer structures by using combined reflection and transmission ellipsometry, reflection ellipsometry with the sample flipped over, and intensity transmission measurements. To demonstrate the usefulness of this capability, the analysis of a complex graded, absorbing thin film structure (a Cr-based phase-shifting <b>photomask</b> <b>blank),</b> is presented. 1...|$|E
40|$|Design and {{fabrication}} of microfluidic devices on polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) substrates for analytical chemistry and biomedical-related applications using novel microfabrication methods are described. The image of microstructures {{is transferred from}} quartz master templates possessing the inverse image of the devices to plastic plates by using hot embossing methods. The micro channels on quartz master templates are formed by the combination of metal etch mask and wet chemical etching of a <b>photomask</b> <b>blank.</b> The micromachined quartz templates can be used repeatedly to replicate cheap and disposable plastic devices. The reproducibility of the hot embossing method is evaluated using 10 channels on different PMMA plastics (Fig. 1). The relative standard deviation of the channel profile on the plastic chips is less than 1 %. In this study, the PMMA microfluidic chips have been demonstrated as a micro capillary electrophoresis (μ-CE) device for DNA separation and detection. The capability of the fabricated chip for electrophoretic injection and separation is characterized via the analysis of DNA fragments FX- 174 -RF Hae III digest. Experimental results indicate {{that all of the}} 11 DNA fragments of the size marker could be identified in less than 2 minutes with relative standard deviations less than 0. 4 % and 8 % for migration time and peak area, respectively. Moreover, {{with the use of a}} near IR dye, fluorescence signals of the higher molecular weight fragments (> 603 b...|$|E

40|$|Increasingly, {{improvements}} in surface roughness and planarity are being sought {{in a variety}} of technologically advanced polishing applications related to the electronics industry. From the production of <b>photomask</b> <b>blanks</b> to the fabrication of microelectronic memory and process devices, {{improvements in}} global surface planarity and roughness, coupled with reduced incidents of defectivity, are critical to achieving the specifications of future technology nodes. Nanophase Technologies Corporation (NTC) uses a patented plasma arc synthesis technique to produce nano-sized cerium oxide (ceria) and aluminum oxide (alumina) particles in commercial quantities and quality. The small particle size, controlled particle size distribution, and unique crystal morphology of these materials are allowing new performance benchmarks to be realized in the planarization of silicon wafers and the polishing of <b>photomask</b> <b>blanks,</b> lithography optics and rigid memory substrates. However, {{the success or failure of}} a nanocrystalline material in a particular polishing application depends not only on the characteristics of the particle but also on the ability to form and maintain a stable dispersion of those particles with controlled rheology. Thus, both the attributes of the particles which provide utility in the above mentioned polishing applications as well as observations relevant to the production of stable dispersions are discussed...|$|R
40|$|The {{inorganic}} {{antireflection coating}} (AR 3 -chromium oxide) commonly used on <b>photomask</b> <b>blanks</b> {{was designed to}} minimize flare in h-line (405 nm) lithography steppers. The reflection of light (flare) off this coating (air-photomask) increases with shorter exposure wavelengths. High levels of flare occur in 248 nm and 193 nm IC steppers due to reflections off of the photomask surface. The reflections (standing waves) in photomask resists also increase during exposure using lower wavelengths of light. Lithography simulations and photomask manufacturing trials have led to resist processes that can generate sub- 0. 30 micron resist features on photomasks with I-line optical pattern generators (ALTA 3500). Lower developer concentration, higher exposure doses and the minimization of standing waves by incorporating a post-exposure bake and / or organic antireflection coatings (ARC) maximizes resolution. High resolution photoresists show standing waves on photomasks fabricated with optical pattern generators. Low contrast resist processes show only small standing waves or in certain cases resist “footing. ” The use of organic antireflection coatings can minimize standing waves and allow the use of high contrast resist processes. ARCs reduce the swing ratio, which improves linewidth uniformity. ARCs also improve the adhesion of the resist to the photomask surface. Simulations reveal that the optimal ARC coating thickness is around 46 nm for typical I-line systems and around 50 nm for 257 nm non-chemically amplified photomask resists. Preliminary I-line photomask manufacturing trials have been done with bottom antireflection coatings at the DPI Reticle Technology Center. The first process trials reveal tha...|$|R
