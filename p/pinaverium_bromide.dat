40|$|Background: Nonanesthetic {{colonoscopy}} {{is popular}} in clinical practice in China. However, intestinal spasms often {{result in a}} prolonged examination time, increased operating difficulties, decreased polyp detection rate, and failure to complete the procedure clinically. Therefore, exploring alternative approaches that can reduce the pain in patients during colonoscopy is of utmost importance, and finding the optimal preoperative administration {{to improve the quality}} of nonanesthetic colonoscopy is also necessary. This study aimed to investigate the effects of the prophylactic administration of <b>pinaverium</b> <b>bromide</b> before colonoscopy and the effects of <b>pinaverium</b> <b>bromide</b> alone at different time points or combined with scopolamine butylbromide. Methods: A randomized controlled trial was performed on a cohort of 1000 patients who underwent colonoscopy in outpatient clinic of Wuhan Union Hospital. The patients were randomly assigned to the following groups: Group A, given oral <b>pinaverium</b> <b>bromide</b> (100 mg, three times a day) one day before examination combined with intramuscular injection of scopolamine butylbromide (20 mg) 10 min before colonoscopy; Group B 0, given <b>pinaverium</b> <b>bromide</b> alone on the day of colonoscopy (100 mg, three times a day); Group B 1, given <b>pinaverium</b> <b>bromide</b> alone (100 mg, three times a day) one day before colonoscopy; Group B 2, given <b>pinaverium</b> <b>bromide</b> alone (100 mg, three times a day) two days before colonoscopy; and Group C, given scopolamine butylbromide alone (20 mg) before colonoscopy. The successful rate of colonoscopy, procedure time, degree of abdominal pain, and polyp detection rate were recorded and compared among all groups. Results: The successful rate of colonoscopy in Group B 1 (82. 0 %) and Group B 2 (83. 0 %) was significantly higher than that in Group B 0 (62. 0 %, all P 0. 05). Furthermore, there were no significant differences in the various parameters examined between Group B 1 and Group B 2 (P > 0. 05). The successful rate of colonoscopy in Group A (92. 0 %) was significantly higher than that in Group B 1 (82. 0 %) and Group C (80. 0 %; both P < 0. 05). Moreover, the time for the colonoscope to reach the ileocecal region in Group A were markedly shorter as compared to those in Group B 1 and Group C (P < 0. 05). The polyp detection rate in Group A was 32. 0 %, significantly higher than that in Group B 1 (24. 0 %, P < 0. 05) and Group C (24. 2 %, P < 0. 05). Conclusion: Administration of <b>pinaverium</b> <b>bromide</b> alone one day before examination was beneficial to relieve symptoms of abdominal pain during nonanesthetic colonoscopy. In addition, therapeutic effects were improved when <b>pinaverium</b> <b>bromide</b> administration was combined with intramuscular injection of scopolamine butylbromide. Therefore, the combined use of <b>pinaverium</b> <b>bromide</b> with scopolamine butylbromide might have great application value {{to improve the quality of}} nonanesthetic colonoscopy in the preoperative preparation...|$|E

Methods: 75 newborn SD rats were randomly divided into groups A, B, C, D and E. Except group A, the rats in other groups were treated with senna and strained stress to establish IBS models due to liver depression and spleen deficiency. Groups A and B were fed with intra-gastric normal saline, group C <b>pinaverium</b> <b>bromide,</b> groups D and E TXYF. After treatment, animals were sacrificed to excise colons, and modified toluidine blue staining was applied to observe the changes of colonic mucosal mast cell (MC) count and de-granulation conditions in rats. Then the levels of 5 -hydroxytryptamine (5 -HT), P substance (SP), calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) in blood samples were detected. Results: The counts of colonic mucosal MC and de-granulation increased significantly in model control group. The levels of 5 -HT, SP significantly decreased while CGRP increased in C, D and group Es. Conclusion: TXYF can play its role of improving gastrointestinal mobility and reduce visceral sensitivity so as to treat IBS through reducing the counts of colonic mucosal MC and degranulation {{as well as the}} levels of serum 5 -HT and plasma SP, and increasing the level of CGRP in IBS model rats...|$|E

40|$|An 18 -year-old man, {{working on}} a farm, {{presented}} with a five-year history of bloating and abdominal cramps. He denied hav-ing any diarrhea, constipation or rectal bleeding. His medical history was remarkable for a diagnosis of autism spectrum disor-der in early childhood, for which he received very little inter-vention due to the paucity of services in his rural community. There was no family history of gastrointestinal diseases. On examination, the patient was noted to be tall and thin, with a body mass index of 20 kg/m 2. There were no oral mucosal lesions, cervical adenopathy or palpable abdominal masses or tenderness. At the onset of his symptoms, the patient had undergone a gastroscopy and colonoscopy which were normal. A gastroscopy repeated one year previously, however, showed a ‘mild nonspecific gastritis’, {{in the absence of}} Helicobacter pylori infection or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory use. The patient’s symptoms actually worsened on a trial of proton pump inhib-itor; consequently, the medication was discontinued. A subse-quent small-bowel follow-through was unremarkable. The patient was then given a trial of an antispasmodic drug <b>pinaverium</b> <b>bromide</b> (Dicetel, Solvay Pharma Inc, Canada) which also did not improve his symptoms. Finally, a colonoscopy was repeated, revealing small, round centrally clearing lesions in the rectum and ascending colon consistent with focal active colitis (Figure 1), as well as lymphoid hyperplasia of the terminal ileum. Because there were no true signs of chronic gland damage or granulomata, a diagnosis of Crohn’s disease could not be made.

40|$|Emerging {{evidence}} suggests that gut microbiota contribute {{to the treatment of}} post-inflammatory irritable bowel syndrome (PI-IBS). Our previous studies have demonstrated that a Chinese formula, Wuji Wan, has the ability to mitigate abdominal pain and diarrhea in PI-IBS rats. However, {{little is known about the}} underlying mechanism and whether the gut microbiota mediate the effect of Wuji Wan on PI-IBS. Thus, the aim of this study was to determine whether Wuji Wan mitigated PI-IBS by modifying the gut microbiota. PI-IBS was induced in Sprague-Dawley rats by enema using 4 % acetic acid and restraint stress. Rats were fed water, Wuji Wan extract (630 mg/kg) or <b>pinaverium</b> <b>bromide</b> (13. 5 mg/kg). Our data showed that Wuji Wan effectively ameliorated abdominal pain, colonic motility abnormality and visceral hypersensitivity. Analysis of the fecal microbiota showed that Wuji Wan could reverse the reduction in richness of the gut microbiota and significantly increase the relative abundances of Akkermansia, Bacteroides, and Parasutterella; however, Lactobacillus and Prevotella were markedly decreased in the PI-IBS rats. Moreover, Wuji Wan promoted goblet cell proliferation in the colonic mucosa by increasing the release of mucin, up-regulating the distribution of tight junction proteins Occludin and ZO- 1 and down-regulating the expression of MLCK in colonic epithelial cells. These findings suggest that Wuji Wan may remit IBS by modulating the gut microbiota and stabilizing the gut mucosal barrier, indicating that the use of a classical formula of Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) that exhibits a prebiotic effect may be a promising strategy for PI-IBS treatment...|$|E
40|$|Although it {{is unclear}} to what extent {{irritable}} bowel syndrome (IBS) symptoms represent a normal perception of abnormal function or an abnormal perception of normal function, many believe that IBS constitutes the clinical expression of an underlying motility disorder, affecting primarily the mid- and lower gut. Indeed, transit and contractile abnormalities have been demonstrated with sophisticated techniques in a subset of patients with IBS. As a consequence, drugs affecting gastrointestinal (GI) motility have been widely employed {{with the aim of}} correcting the major IBS manifestations, ie, pain and altered bowel function. Unfortunately, no single drug has proven to be effective in treating IBS symptom complex. In addition, the use of some medications has often been associated with unpleasant side effects. Therefore, the search for a truly effective and safe drug to control motility disturbances in IBS continues. Several classes of drugs look promising and are under evaluation. Among the motor- inhibiting drugs, gut selective muscarinic antagonists (such as zamifenacin and darifenacin), neurokinin 2 antagonists (such as MEN- 10627 and MEN- 11420), beta 3 -adrenoreceptor agonists (eg, SR- 58611 A) and GI-selective calcium channel blockers (eg, <b>pinaverium</b> <b>bromide</b> and octylonium) are able to decrease painful contractile activity in the gut (antispasmodic effect), without significantly affecting other body functions. Novel mechanisms to stimulate GI motility and transit include blockade of cholecystokinin (CCK) A receptors and stimulation of motilin receptors. Loxiglumide (and its dextroisomer, dexloxiglumide) is the only CCKA receptor antagonist that is being evaluated clinically. This drug accelerates gastric emptying and colonic transit, thereby increasing the number of bowel movements in patients with chronic constipation. It is also able to reduce visceral perception. Erythromycin and related 14 -member macrolide compounds inhibit the binding of motilin to its receptors on GI smooth muscle and, therefore, act as motilin agonists. This antibiotic accelerates gastric emptying and shortens orocecal transit time. In the large bowel a significant decrease in transit is observed only in the right colon, which suggests a shift in fecal distribution. Several ‘motilinomimetics’ have been synthesized. Their development depends on the lack of antimicrobial activity and the absence of fading of the prokinetic effect during prolonged administration. 5 -hydroxytryptamine (5 -HT) 4 agonists with significant pharmacological effects on the mid- and distal gut (such as prucalopride and tegaserod) are available for human use. These ‘enterokinetic’ compounds are useful for treating constipation- predominant IBS patients. 5 -HT 3 receptor antagonists also possess a number of interesting pharmacological properties that may make them suitable for treatment of IBS. Besides decreasing colonic sensitivity to distension, these drugs prolong intestinal transit and may be particularly useful in diarrhea-predominant IBS. Finally, when administered in small pulsed doses, octreotide, besides reducing the perception of rectal distension, accelerates intestinal transit, although other evidence disputes such an effect...|$|E
40|$|Irritable bowel {{syndrome}} (IBS) is a common, costly, {{and difficult}} to treat disorder that impairs health-related {{quality of life and}} work productivity. Evidence-based treatment guidelines have been unable to provide guidance on the effects of acupuncture for IBS because the only previous systematic review included only small, heterogeneous and methodologically unsound trials. The primary objectives were to assess the efficacy and safety of acupuncture for treating IBS. MEDLINE, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, EMBASE, the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health, and the Chinese databases Sino-Med, CNKI, and VIP were searched through November 2011. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that compared acupuncture with sham acupuncture, other active treatments, or no (specific) treatment, and RCTs that evaluated acupuncture as an adjuvant to another treatment, in adults with IBS were included. Two authors independently assessed the risk of bias and extracted data. We extracted data for the outcomes overall IBS symptom severity and health-related quality of life. For dichotomous data (e. g. the IBS Adequate Relief Question), we calculated a pooled relative risk (RR) and 95 % confidence interval (CI) for substantial improvement in symptom severity after treatment. For continuous data (e. g. the IBS Severity Scoring System), we calculated the standardized mean difference (SMD) and 95 % CI in post-treatment scores between groups. Seventeen RCTs (1806 participants) were included. Five RCTs compared acupuncture versus sham acupuncture. The risk of bias in these studies was low. We found no evidence of an improvement with acupuncture relative to sham (placebo) acupuncture for symptom severity (SMD - 0. 11, 95 % CI - 0. 35 to 0. 13; 4 RCTs; 281 patients) or quality of life (SMD = - 0. 03, 95 % CI - 0. 27 to 0. 22; 3 RCTs; 253 patients). Sensitivity analyses based on study quality did not change the results. A GRADE analysis indicated that the overall quality of the evidence for the primary outcomes in the sham controlled trials was moderate due to sparse data. The risk of bias in the four Chinese language comparative effectiveness trials that compared acupuncture with drug treatment was high due to lack of blinding. The risk of bias in the other studies that did not use a sham control was high due to lack of blinding or inadequate methods used for randomization and allocation concealment or both. Acupuncture was significantly more effective than pharmacological therapy and no specific treatment. Eighty-four per cent of patients in the acupuncture group had improvement in symptom severity compared to 63 % of patients in the pharmacological treatment group (RR 1. 28, 95 % CI 1. 12 to 1. 45; 5 studies, 449 patients). A GRADE analysis indicated that the overall quality of the evidence for this outcome was low due to a high risk of bias (no blinding) and sparse data. Sixty-three per cent of patients in the acupuncture group had improvement in symptom severity compared to 34 % of patients in the no specific therapy group (RR 2. 11, 95 % CI 1. 18 to 3. 79; 2 studies, 181 patients). There was no statistically significant difference between acupuncture and Bifidobacterium (RR 1. 07, 95 % CI 0. 90 to 1. 27; 2 studies; 181 patients) or between acupuncture and psychotherapy (RR 1. 05, 95 % CI 0. 87 to 1. 26; 1 study; 100 patients). Acupuncture as an adjuvant to another Chinese medicine treatment was significantly better than the other treatment alone. Ninety-three per cent of patients in the adjuvant acupuncture group improved compared to 79 % of patients who received Chinese medicine alone (RR 1. 17, 95 % CI 1. 02 to 1. 33; 4 studies; 466 patients). There was one adverse event (i. e. acupuncture syncope) associated with acupuncture in the 9 trials that reported this outcome, although relatively small sample sizes limit the usefulness of these safety data. Sham-controlled RCTs have found no benefits of acupuncture relative to a credible sham acupuncture control for IBS symptom severity or IBS-related quality of life. In comparative effectiveness Chinese trials, patients reported greater benefits from acupuncture than from two antispasmodic drugs (<b>pinaverium</b> <b>bromide</b> and trimebutine maleate), both of which have been shown to provide a modest benefit for IBS. Future trials may help clarify whether or not these reportedly greater benefits of acupuncture relative to pharmacological therapies are due entirely to patients' preferences for acupuncture or greater expectations of improvement on acupuncture relative to drug therapy. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E
