5|$|Embryos {{produced}} {{using in}} vitro fertilization may be genetically tested for HD using <b>preimplantation</b> <b>genetic</b> <b>diagnosis</b> (PGD). This technique, where one or two cells are extracted from a typically 4- to 8-cell embryo and then tested for the genetic abnormality, can then be used to ensure embryos affected with HD genes are not implanted, and therefore any offspring will not inherit the disease. Some forms of preimplantation genetic diagnosis—non-disclosure or exclusion testing—allow at-risk people to have HD-free offspring without revealing their own parental genotype, giving no information about whether they themselves are destined to develop HD. In exclusion testing, the embryos' DNA is {{compared with that of}} the parents and grandparents to avoid inheritance of the chromosomal region containing the HD gene from the affected grandparent. In non-disclosure testing, only disease-free embryos are replaced in the uterus while the parental genotype and hence parental risk for HD are never disclosed.|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: Pregnancy {{rates in}} women of {{advanced}} maternal age undergoing {{in vitro fertilization}} (IVF) are disappointingly low. It {{has been suggested that}} the use of <b>preimplantation</b> <b>genetic</b> screening of cleavage-stage embryos for aneuploidies may improve the effectiveness of IVF in these women. METHODS: We conducted a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, controlled trial comparing three cycles of IVF with and without <b>preimplantation</b> <b>genetic</b> screening in women 35 through 41 years of age. The primary outcome measure was ongoing pregnancy at 12 weeks of gestation. The secondary outcome measures were biochemical pregnancy, clinical pregnancy, miscarriage, and live birth. RESULTS: Four hundred eight women (206 assigned to <b>preimplantation</b> <b>genetic</b> screening and 202 assigned to the control group) underwent 836 cycles of IVF (434 cycles with and 402 cycles without <b>preimplantation</b> <b>genetic</b> screening). The ongoing-pregnancy rate was significantly lower in the women assigned to <b>preimplantation</b> <b>genetic</b> screening (52 of 206 women [25 %]) than in those not assigned to <b>preimplantation</b> <b>genetic</b> screening (74 of 202 women [37 %]; rate ratio, 0. 69; 95 % confidence interval [CI], 0. 51 to 0. 93). The women assigned to <b>preimplantation</b> <b>genetic</b> screening also had a significantly lower live-birth rate (49 of 206 women [24 %] vs. 71 of 202 women [35 %]; rate ratio, 0. 68; 95 % CI, 0. 50 to 0. 92). CONCLUSIONS: <b>Preimplantation</b> <b>genetic</b> screening did not increase but instead significantly reduced the rates of ongoing pregnancies and live births after IVF in women of advanced maternal age.

Study and control children were well matched across relevant socio-demographic variables. Growth parameters at mean age 18 months were normal. The mean Griffiths quotient was 102. 7 (+/- 13. 1) (PGD) and 103. 3 (+/- 12. 8) (NC), {{both of which were}} within the normal range, and did not differ significantly.

Objective: The aim of this lab trial study was to evaluate the incidence of aneuploidies in five chromosomes in the morphologically high-quality embryos from young patients undergoing ART for sex selection. Materials and Methods: A total of 97 high quality embryos from 23 women at the age of 37 or younger years that had previously undergone <b>preimplantation</b> <b>genetic</b> screening for sex selection were included in this study.

40|$|AbstractPreimplantation <b>genetic</b> <b>diagnosis</b> is a {{procedure}} that involves the removal {{of one or more}} nuclei from oocytes (a polar body) or embryos (blastomeres or trophectoderm cells) in order to test for problems in genome sequence or chromosomes of the embryo prior to implantation. It provides new hope of having unaffected children, as well as avoiding the necessity of terminating an affected pregnancy for genetic parents who carry an affected gene or have balanced chromosomal status. Polymerase chain reaction-based molecular techniques are the methods used to detect gene defects with a known sequence and X-linked diseases. The indication for using this approach has expanded for couples who are prevented from having babies because they carry a serious genetic disorder to couples with conditions that are not immediately life threatening, such as cancer predisposition genes and Huntington disease. In addition, fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) has been widely applied for the detection of chromosome abnormalities. FISH allows the evaluation of many chromosomes at the same time, up to 15 chromosome pairs in a single cell. <b>Preimplantation</b> <b>genetic</b> screening, defined as a test that screens for aneuploidy, has been most commonly used in situations of advanced maternal age, a history of recurrent miscarriage, a history of repeated implantation failure, or a severe male factor. Unfortunately, randomized controlled trials have as yet shown no benefit with respect to <b>preimplantation</b> <b>genetic</b> screening using cleavage stage biopsy, which is probably attributable to the high levels of mosaicism at early cleavage stages and the limitations of FISH. Recently, two main types of array-based technology combined with whole genome amplification have been developed for use in <b>preimplantation</b> <b>genetic</b> diagnosis; these are comparative genomic hybridization and single nucleotide polymorphism-based arrays. Both allow the analysis of all chromosomes, and the latter also allows the haplotype of the sample to be determined. The promising results of these two approaches will inspire further validation of these array platforms, even at the single-cell level. It remains to be decided which embryo stage is the best for biopsy. Moreover, if randomized controlled trials are confirmed {{to play a role in}} increasing delivery rates, this will be a major step forward for assisted reproductive technology patients around the world...|$|R

On the contrary, for women of advanced maternal age, PGS with cleavage-stage biopsy significantly lowers the live birth rate. Technical drawbacks, such as the invasiveness of the biopsy, and non-representative samples because of mosaicism are the major underlying factors for inefficacy of PGS.|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background In routine Assisted Reproductive Technology (ART) {{men with}} severe oligozoospermia or {{azoospermia}} should be {{informed about the}} risk of de novo congenital or chromosomal abnormalities in ICSI program. Also the benefits of <b>preimplantation</b> or prenatal <b>genetic</b> <b>diagnosis</b> practice need to be explained to the couple. Methods From a routine ICSI attempt, using ejaculated sperm from male with severe oligozoospermia and having normal karyotype, a 30 years old pregnant woman was referred to prenatal diagnosis in the 17 th week for bichorionic biamniotic twin gestation. Amniocentesis was performed because of the detection of an increased foetal nuchal translucency for one of the fetus by the sonographic examination during the 12 th week of gestation (WG). Chromosome and DNA studies of the fetus were realized on cultured amniocytes Results Conventional, molecular cytogenetic and microarray CGH experiments allowed us to conclude that the fetus had a de novo pericentromeric inversion associated with a duplication of the 9 p 22. 1 -p 24 chromosomal region, 46,XY,invdup(9) (p 22. 1 p 24) [arrCGH 9 p 22. 1 p 24 (RP 11 - 130 C 19 → RP 11 - 87 O 1) x 3]. As containing the critical 9 p 22 region, our case is in coincidence with the general phenotype features of the partial trisomy 9 p syndrome with major growth retardation, microcephaly and microretrognathia.
