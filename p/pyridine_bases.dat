2500|$|Following the {{invention}} of coal gas early in the 19th century, {{it was discovered that}} numerous organic and inorganic chemicals could be obtained when purifying the gas. Processes began to be developed to recover these, and a major branch of the British chemical industry – the coal tar and ammonia by-products industry – came into existence. By 1876 a nearby company, Burt, Boulton and Haywood of Silvertown, was distilling each year [...] of coal tar to manufacture ingredients for disinfectants, insecticides and dyes. Sulphur from the gas works was the raw material for local manufacturers of sulphuric acid needed by other nearby companies producing products such as fertilizers. Subsequently the GLCC decided that it would carry out the processing of by-products itself, rather than sell them to independent chemical companies. A purpose-built chemical works, Beckton Products Works, was constructed in 1879. It was the largest tar and ammonia by-products works in the UK, possibly in the world. Besides millions of gallons of road tar, products included phenol, the cresols and xylenols, naphthalene, <b>pyridine</b> <b>bases,</b> creosote, benzene, toluene, xylene, solvent naphtha, ammonium sulphate and ammonia solution, sulphuric acid, picolines, quinoline, quinaldine, acenaphthene, anthracene and dicyclopentadiene. Since the Products works was dependent on by-products of gas manufacture it could not long survive the introduction of natural gas. The last train carrying chemical products, a load of pitch, left the works on 1 June 1970.|$|E

40|$|A {{kinetic study}} {{was made of}} the {{reaction}} between phenols and carboxylic acid anhydrides in the presence of <b>pyridine</b> <b>bases</b> in carbon tetrachloride. Linear free energy relationships were applied and results are consistent with a general base catalysis, i. e. reaction via a pyridine/phenol hydro gen-bonded complex. Values were found for the Hammett reaction constant, the Bronoted reaction constant and the Taft (storic effects) reaction constant. The energy of activation was found for the reaction between p-chloro phenol and acetic anhydride with pyridine. The catalytic ability of bases, other than <b>pyridine</b> <b>bases,</b> was deteimined. The mechanism of the pyridine catalysis is discussed and a transition state proposed. Phenols do not react with carboxylic acid anhydrides in carbon tetrachloride {{in the absence of a}} base. Although 2 -picoline and 2, 6 -lutidine have high pKa values, they do not catalyse this reaction because of steric effects and for this reason also, 2, 6 -lutidine inhibits aeylation in the presence of a catalytic pyridine base. At higher base concentrations, a fast reaction was observed between phenols and anhydrides in the presence of 2, 6 -lutidine, but this did not go to completion. At the low base concentrations used in the work above, this fast acylation accounts for only a small percentage of the reaction and no further esterification occurs. Results are consistent with a highly reactive phenol/ 2, 6 -lutidine dimer hydrogen-bonded complex or ion pair. Acetic acid inhibits this initial rapid reaction and the solvent does not significantly affect results. Acetylation of alcohols by acetic anhydride was studied in carbon tetrachloride. Alcohols containing intramolecular hydrogen bonds reacted slower than non-chelated alcohols. Reasons for this reduced reactivity are proposed.

Variation on the donor atoms has allowed an investigation of donor property influences on C-H activation, by giving peri-activated palladium pincer complexes for the ketimine-, aldimine-, amine- and biyridine-armed ligands and generating ortho-activated ONC palladium pincer complexes {{in the case of the}} alcohol-armed pro-ligand. Use of different palladium salts also led to different regioselective C-H activations. With the ketimine-armed naphthyl ligand (HL 1 ket-nap) as the example, the interconversion chemistry between the ortho- and peri-C-H activated products is also explored.

40|$|The {{investigation}} of strongly hydrogen bonded solid state {{materials and the}} hydrogen transfer processes therein {{are the subject of}} the present work. Strong hydrogen bonds are found whenever the hydrogen bonded species compete for the hydrogen atom, and are thereby on the verge of showing hydrogen transfer. Consequently, the strongly hydrogen bonded solid state materials investigated in this work are synthesised by co-crystallising chemical compounds which have a similar affinity for the proton. The molecular complexes of isonicotinamide with oxalic acid crystallise in two hydrogenous polymorphs and, upon substituting the acidic hydrogen for deuterium, in two deuterated polymorphs, neither being isostructural to the hydrogenous forms. This phenomenon is known as isotopomeric polymorphism and is rarely observed in molecular materials. The four polymorphic forms are found to exhibit different degrees of hydron transfer. The hydrogenous forms show strong hydrogen bonding between the acid and the pyridine base. The nature of these strong hydrogen bonds is characterised by combined X ray charge density and single crystal neutron diffraction studies and found to be covalent in nature. The covalent hydroxyl bonds are considerably elongated, to an extent that in one polymorph the hydrogen atom occupies a near central position in the strong hydrogen bond. The structural work has been complemented by ab-initio computational studies, using the plane wave and localised atomic orbital methods, to evaluate the nature and the dynamics of the strong hydrogen bonds, and to establish an energy scale for polymorphism. It is found that the atomic orbital calculations yield results in good agreement with the experiment, while the plane wave calculations fail to reproduce the experimental hydrogen bond geometries. A strong electronic delocalisation is observed in the difference electron densities of strong acid – pyridine base hydrogen bonds. The major contribution to the delocalisation is found to originate from the nitrogen lone pair density which in this type of strong hydrogen bond is found to be observed to low experimental resolutions in standard X-ray diffraction experiments. As a consequence, such hydrogen bonds are susceptible to misinterpretation, and can be misinterpreted as hydrogen bonds with a disordered hydrogen, altering the descriptive character of materials significantly from being neutral to being ionic. It is shown that a careful examination of the difference electron densities, with the knowledge of the presence of the nitrogen lone pair density, allows a reasonably accurate determination of nuclear hydrogen positions from X-ray diffraction experiments alone. The hydrogen transfer behaviour in a series of strongly hydrogen bonded materials has been studied. For the molecular complexes of pentachlorophenol with the series of dimethylpyridines, a correlation is established between the dissociation constants determined in solution and the degree of hydrogen transfer from phenol to the <b>pyridine</b> <b>bases</b> in the solid state. The influence of additional strong and weak hydrogen bonding interactions {{in the vicinity of the}} strong hydrogen bonds on the hydrogen transfer behaviour is rationalised. Similar studies have been carried out on the molecular complexes of oxalic acid and fumaric acid with the dimethylpyridines, and on the molecular complexes of pentachlorophenol with 1, 4 -diazabicyclo[2. 2. 2]octane.

The most common isozymes of malate dehydrogenase use NAD+ or NADP+ as a cofactor to accept electrons and protons.However, the main difference of malate oxidase is that it normally employs FAD as redox partner as alternative. Contrary to <b>pyridine</b> <b>based</b> NAD+/NADP+, FAD comprises a quinone moiety, which is reduced by the forward reaction. FAD is thereby converted to FADH2. In this case, malate oxidase is qualified as malate dehydrogenase (quinone).|$|R
40|$|The {{nucleophilic}} substitution {{reactions of}} Y-aryl ethyl chlorothiophosphates with X-pyridines are studied kinetically in acetonitrile at 55. 0 ºC. The Hammett and Brönsted plots for substituent X {{variations in the}} nucleophiles exhibit biphasic concave upwards with a break point at X = 3 -Me. The substituents of X = 4 -CN and 4 -Ac show great positive deviations from both the Hammett and Brönsted plots. The Hammett plots for substituent Y variations in the substrates exhibit biphasic concave upwards with a minimum point at Y = H. The obtained values of the cross-interaction constants (ρXY) are all null {{in spite of the}} biphasic free energy correlations for both substituent X and Y variations, since the ρX values with both the strongly and weakly basic pyridines are almost constant. A stepwise mechanism with a rate-limiting leaving group departure from the intermediate is proposed where the distance between X and Y does not vary from the intermediate to the second transition state. A frontside attack is proposed with the strongly basic <b>pyridines</b> <b>based</b> on the considerably great magnitudes of ρX and βX values and a backside attack is proposed with the weakly basic <b>pyridines</b> <b>based</b> on the relatively small magnitudes of ρX and βX. The positive deviations of the two strong π-acceptor para-substituents, X = 4 -Ac and 4 -CN, from both the Hammett and Brönsted plots are rationalized by the great extents of bond formation and breaking...|$|R
40|$|A novel {{methodology}} for {{the synthesis of}} highly substituted <b>pyridines</b> <b>based</b> on the palladium-catalyzed enolate α-alkenylation of ketones is presented; the formation of aromatic compounds is a new direction for this catalytic C-C bond forming reaction. In the key step, a protected β-haloalkenylaldehyde participates in α-alkenylation with a ketone to afford a 1, 5 -dicarbonyl surrogate, which then undergoes cyclization/double elimination to the corresponding pyridine product, all in one pot. The β-haloalkenylaldehyde starting materials {{can be obtained from}} the corresponding methylene ketone via Vilsmeier haloformylation. Using this concise route, a variety of highly substituted pyridines were synthesized in three steps from commercially available compounds...|$|R
40|$|The deuterated {{molecular}} complexes of isonicotinamide with {{oxalic acid}} crystallise in two polymorphs, which {{are found to}} be distinct from the two polymorphs of the hydrogenous complexes previously reported. This phenomenon is known as isotopomeric polymorphism, is rarely observed in molecular materials and in particular the presence of multiple polymorphic forms of each isotopic material observed here appears to be unprecedented. The four polymorphic forms are found to exhibit different degrees of hydron transfer. Unlike the hydrogenous forms, the deuterated polymorphs do not show short, strong hydrogen bonding between the acid and the <b>pyridine</b> <b>base.</b> Periodic electronic structure calculations establish an energy scale for the polymorphism in these isotopomeric polymorphs...|$|R
50|$|Besides {{assembling}} NAD de novo {{from simple}} amino acid precursors, cells also salvage preformed compounds containing a <b>pyridine</b> <b>base.</b> The three vitamin precursors {{used in these}} salvage metabolic pathways are nicotinic acid (NA), nicotinamide (Nam) and nicotinamide riboside (NR). These compounds can be taken up from the diet and are termed vitamin B or niacin. However, these compounds are also produced within cells and by digestion of cellular NAD. Some of the enzymes involved in these salvage pathways appear to be concentrated in the cell nucleus, which may compensate for {{the high level of}} reactions that consume NAD in this organelle. There are some reports that mammalian cells can take up extracellular NAD from their surroundings.|$|R

Using a small volume of <b>pyridine</b> <b>based</b> nanoparticle suspensions with varying concentrations, these were completely drained of nanoparticles during deposition. Our proposed approach {{is well suited}} to a practical realization of engineering materials with different band gaps for various promising applications such as fabrication of nanodevices. The formation of a charge selective contact across the CdTe np CdSe np heterojunction was investigated by surface photovoltage methods and evidence {{of the separation of}} charge carriers at a CdTe CdSe np heterojunction in amp; 8208;between was demonstrate...|$|R
