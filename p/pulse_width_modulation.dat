This includes adaptive signal conditioning and pro-grammability on-the-fly, higher flexibility, parallel computation capability, and easy implementation. In practical applications, the power quality compensator may suffer from poor compensation performance, particularly during light loading. The adaptive sig-nal gain and programmable on-the-fly functions of the mixed signal controller are intended to improve the system compensation per-formance, which cannot be achieved by using conventional digital controllers alone. In this study, an approximate total harmonic dis-tortion (ATHD) is proposed to determine the total harmonic distor-tion value more quickly, reducing the evaluation time of the power quality compensation system performance.
