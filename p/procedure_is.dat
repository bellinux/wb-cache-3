5|$|Two main {{surgical}} procedures {{exist in the}} treatment of IIH: optic nerve sheath decompression and fenestration and shunting. Surgery would normally only be offered if medical therapy is either unsuccessful or not tolerated. The choice between these two procedures depends on the predominant problem in IIH. Neither <b>procedure</b> <b>is</b> perfect: both may cause significant complications, and both may eventually fail in controlling the symptoms. There are no randomized controlled trials to guide the decision as to which <b>procedure</b> <b>is</b> best.|$|E
5|$|Almost all jumping spiders are predators, mostly {{preying on}} insects, on other spiders, {{and on other}} arthropods. The most common <b>procedure</b> <b>is</b> {{sighting}} the prey, stalking, fastening a silk safety line to the surface, using the two pairs of back legs {{to jump on the}} victim, and finally biting the prey. Most jumping spiders walk throughout the day, so that they maximize their chances of a catch.|$|E

5|$|Decompression {{software}} {{can be used}} to generate tables or schedules matched to a diver's planned dive profile and breathing gas mixtures. The usual <b>procedure</b> <b>is</b> to generate schedules for the intended profile and for the most likely contingency profiles, such as slightly greater depth, delayed ascent and early ascent. Sometimes an emergency minimum decompression schedule and a more conservative schedule will be generated to allow the diver further options.|$|E
5|$|Mendelevium {{can finally}} be {{separated}} from the other trivalent actinides using selective elution from a cation-exchange resin column, the eluant being ammonia α-HIB. Using the gas-jet method often renders the first two steps unnecessary. The above <b>procedure</b> <b>is</b> the most commonly used one for the separation of transeinsteinium elements.|$|E
5|$|No {{contraindications}} {{are known}} for this examination. Ultrasonography does not involve the use of ionizing radiation, and the <b>procedure</b> <b>is</b> harmless and can be safely used on anybody of any age. A World Health Organization report published in 1998 supports this.|$|E

5|$|One {{industrial}} application for helium is leak detection. Because helium diffuses through solids three {{times faster than}} air, it {{is used as a}} tracer gas to detect leaks in high-vacuum equipment (such as cryogenic tanks) and high-pressure containers. The tested object is placed in a chamber, which is then evacuated and filled with helium. The helium that escapes through the leaks is detected by a sensitive device (helium mass spectrometer), even at the leak rates as small as 10−9 mbar·L/s (10−10 Pa·m3/s). The measurement <b>procedure</b> <b>is</b> normally automatic and is called helium integral test. A simpler <b>procedure</b> <b>is</b> to fill the tested object with helium and to manually search for leaks with a hand-held device.|$|E
5|$|Tracing in English {{law is a}} {{procedure}} to identify property (such as money) that has been taken from the claimant involuntarily. It is not in itself a way to recover the property, but rather to identify {{it so that the}} courts can decide what remedy to apply. The <b>procedure</b> <b>is</b> used in several situations, broadly demarcated by whether the property has been transferred because of theft, breach of trust, or mistake.|$|E
5|$|A {{number of}} methods to perform {{sterilization}} via the cervix are being studied. One involves putting quinacrine in the uterus which causes scarring and infertility. While the <b>procedure</b> <b>is</b> inexpensive {{and does not}} require surgical skills, there are concerns regarding long-term side effects. Another substance, polidocanol, which functions {{in the same manner}} is being looked at. A device called Essure, which expands when placed in the fallopian tubes and blocks them, was approved in the United States in 2002.|$|E

5|$|In {{extreme cases}} of {{intractable}} CSF leak, a surgical lumbar drain has been used. This <b>procedure</b> <b>is</b> believed to decrease spinal CSF volume while increasing intracranial CSF pressure and volume. This procedure restores normal intracranial CSF volume and pressure while promoting {{the healing of}} dural tears by lowering the pressure and volume in the dura. This procedure has led to positive results leading to relief of symptoms for up to one year.|$|E
5|$|RSI {{may also}} be used in prehospital {{emergency}} situations when a patient is conscious but respiratory failure is imminent (such as in extreme trauma). This <b>procedure</b> <b>is</b> commonly performed by flight paramedics.

25|$|Cosmetic {{surgery is}} an {{optional}} or elective surgery that is performed on normal {{parts of the}} body with the only purpose of improving a person’s appearance and/or removing signs of aging. In 2014, nearly 16 million cosmetic <b>procedures</b> <b>were</b> performed in the United States alone. The number of cosmetic procedures performed in the United States has almost doubled {{since the start of the}} century. 92% of cosmetic <b>procedures</b> <b>were</b> performed on women in 2014, up from 88% in 2001. Nearly 12 million cosmetic <b>procedures</b> <b>were</b> performed in 2007, with the five most common surgeries being breast augmentation, liposuction, breast reduction, eyelid surgery and abdominoplasty. The American Society for Aesthetic Plastic Surgery looks at the statistics for 34 different cosmetic procedures. Nineteen of the <b>procedures</b> <b>are</b> surgical, such as rhinoplasty or facelift. The nonsurgical procedures include Botox and laser hair removal. In 2010, their survey revealed that there <b>were</b> 9,336,814 total <b>procedures</b> in the United States. Of those, 1,622,290 <b>procedures</b> <b>were</b> surgical (p.5).

5|$|The {{positions}} of the world's major medical organizations range from considering elective circumcision of babies and children as having no benefit and significant risks to having a modest health benefit that outweighs small risks. No major medical organization recommends either universal circumcision of all males or banning the procedure. Ethical and legal questions regarding informed consent and human rights have been raised over the circumcision of babies and children for non-medical reasons; for these reasons the <b>procedure</b> <b>is</b> controversial.|$|E
5|$|The <b>procedure</b> <b>is</b> {{high risk}} as a diver {{suffering}} from DCS may become paralysed, unconscious or stop breathing whilst under water. Any {{one of these}} events may result in the diver drowning or further injury to the diver during a subsequent rescue to the surface. These risks can be mitigated to some extent by using a helmet or full-face mask with voice communications on the diver, and suspending the diver from the surface so that depth is positively controlled, and by having an in-water standby diver attend the diver undergoing the treatment at all times.|$|E
5|$|The {{procedure}} {{should not}} be used without a medical indication, such as with a reason to expect that a person is at heightened risk of having deep vein thrombosis. This screening is not effective at diagnosing DVT in the absence of other indications that the patient may have this condition.
