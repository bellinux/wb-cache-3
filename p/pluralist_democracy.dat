40|$|The paper {{focuses on}} the concept of {{technical}} rules (according to an Aristotelian interpretation, that is to say as propositions that express a necessity: if you want x, you must do y). The thesis argued is that this concept is helpful in coping with some of the problems of both teleological and deontological planning theories. In particular the concept is useful in emphasizing the role of technical knowledge in planning and in ‘solving the relationship’ between planning and politics in a way consistent with the characteristics of liberal and <b>pluralist</b> <b>democracies...</b>|$|R
40|$|Parties in <b>pluralist</b> <b>democracies</b> face {{numerous}} contentious issues, {{but most}} models of electoral competition assume a simple, often one-dimensional structure. We develop a new, inherently multidimensional model of party strategy in which parties compete by emphasizing policy issues. Issue emphasis {{is informed by}} two distinct goals: mobilizing the party’s core voters and broadening the support base. Accommodating these goals dissolves the position-valence dichotomy through a focus on policies that unite the party internally while also attracting support from the electorate at large. We define issue yield as the capacity of an issue to reconcile these criteria, and then operationalize it as a simple index. Results of multilevel regressions combining population survey data and party manifesto scores from the 2009 European Election Study demonstrate that issue yield governs party strategy across different political contexts...|$|R

Although the Constitution provides for independent judiciary, it explicitly subordinates it to the National Assembly and to the Council of State.

40|$|THESIS 10670 This thesis evaluates two {{opposing}} accounts {{of justice and}} international justice that both claim Kantian foundations: firstly, the international account offered by the political philosopher John Rawls, and, secondly, the cosmopolitan account argued for by the moral philosopher Onora O?Neill. The primary focus of the research is the adequacy of their contrasting strategies of justification for principles of justice. The primary conclusion is that Rawls 2 ̆ 7 s justificatory strategy lacks the impartial perspective it claims and is fundamentally insufficient and unsuited to the actual global context with which modern liberal <b>pluralist</b> <b>democracies</b> find themselves. This conclusion {{is based on an}} analysis of Rawls 2 ̆ 7 s methodological starting points, which it is argued lead him away from universal-moral justification toward a context- dependent and partisan form of justification...|$|R

Nonetheless, the legitimacy of democratic regimes is not challenged: European citizens do not conceive realistically of an alternative system of government.

2500|$|The {{day after}} rising to power on December 2, 1990, Idriss Déby {{suspended}} the 1989 constitution. This was replaced on March 1, 1991, by a transitional national charter, {{after having been}} adopted on February 28 by the National Salvation Council, that it was announced would be replaced in 30 months by a new constitution drawn up by a Sovereign National Conference. The Charter, while if it gave vast if not exorbitant powers to the presidency, assured fundamental freedoms and rights, including the freedom of opinion and of association, {{the freedom of the}} press, the free movement of persons and property, the right to own property and the individual and collective freedoms in the frame of a <b>pluralist</b> <b>democracy.</b> The Charter also prohibited magistrates, men of the military and security services from being members of any party. The Charter also attempted to avoid a return of warlordism and sectarian politics, that had long plagued Chad: article 5 demanded parties [...] "to shun intolerance, tribalism, regionalism, religious discrimination and xenophobia and incitement to hatred, and the resource [...] violence in all its forms", while article 6 forbade parties [...] "to set up military or paramilitary organizations; to reconstitute into political parties any erstwhile politico-military bodies". To weaken tribalism, it was also added that to register, parties would need at least three members taken from each of ten prefectures. Despite this, the charter was widely seen of an attempt by a government only reluctantly committed to democracy to strictly remain in control of every part of the democratisation process.|$|E

This broad definition encapsulates all forms of campaigns from those of neighborhood organizations seeking to influence local politicians to the campaigns of political parties and candidates who seek election to office in order to shape policy themselves. In <b>pluralist</b> <b>democracies,</b> campaigns are crucial for representation. Campaigns are {{a means by which}} groups of individuals with a common cause can communicate their stance and enable others with similar concerns to join their campaign; thus, campaigns give voice to those individuals and the supporters of their cause. The majority of academic research has focused on the campaigns orchestrated by those seeking election, in particular political parties or candidates seeking to be elected as national president. Due to the levels of resources, the campaigns run by candidates for the U. S. presidency are the most sophisticated and gain most attention. The campaign environment is more complex, however.

40|$|Purpose: Preparing {{citizens}} {{for participation in}} <b>pluralist</b> <b>democracies</b> also requires a type of citizenship education that fosters critical democratic citizenship (CDC). This study inquires into an educational activity {{with a long history}} in many EU-countries: mock elections. It explores the extent to which elements of CDC-literacy, competences and identity are commonly fostered in education related to mock elections in the Netherlands, and teacher rationales in this regard. Methodology: A qualitative study was conducted. Data from semi-structured interviews with teachers from eight schools were analysed using thematic analysis. Findings and implications: Data analysis revealed an emphasis on offering a participatory experience. Five elements of critical democratic citizenship were commonly advanced in mock election related education in these schools. Teacher narratives also revealed how teachers had different understandings about political identity and their role in advancing identity development. Findings suggest that there is ample opportunity to intensify attention to CDC-development in education related to mock elections in Dutch schools. Further research into students’ political identity development processes during political simulations in different political and educational contexts is required to further academic debate about desirable support by teachers and governments in high-quality political education project...|$|R
40|$|This article {{attempts}} to marry direct democratic deliberation with {{the enforcement of}} important constitutional norms {{in the context of}} a real-life policy question. The question is the secession of Quebec from Canada. The article argues that a referendum is neither the most legitimate nor the most effective way to address the issue. The debate over Quebec 2 ̆ 7 s future must be reoriented by reference to the broad normative framework set out by the Supreme Court of Canada in the Reference Re Secession of Quebec, [1998] 2 S. C. R. 217, combined with a new democratic process. This article introduces an innovative constitutional model called democratic experimentalism, which seeks to ensure legitimacy, participation, and accountability within heterogenous, complex democratic systems, as a fresh perspective on Canada 2 ̆ 7 s troubled federalism debate. The article concludes that democratic experimentalism is compatible with Canada 2 ̆ 7 s constitutional values and traditions, and with the standard of the clear qualitative majority vote set down by the Supreme Court of Canada. Equally, the Secession Reference approach contains within it an important new understanding of how <b>pluralist</b> <b>democracies</b> globally should approach fundamental constitutional questions...|$|R

40|$|The {{theory of}} {{securitization}} postulates the remit of post-political, military action to quell an existential threat in International Relations. <b>Pluralist</b> <b>democracies</b> like India have used {{armed forces to}} tackle inter-nal situations of ethnic conflict and legitimized it by deeming the conflict {{as a threat to}} national security. But ongoing domestic turmoil proves that armed confrontation between the state and its aggrieved commu-nities has only succeeded in prolonging the dynamics of the conflict, rather than their comprehensive resolution. The present article takes a cue from this reality of insecurity. It seeks to theoretically link internal ethnic conflicts (which are perceived to threaten state survival) and their securitization, in the light of an actual conflict situation. The crisis in Punjab that embroiled India for a decade and met with a heavy mili-tary response of the state forms the case study. Analyzing the state response to the Punjab ethnic crisis from the securitization prism is a hitherto unexplored theoretical enterprise. The article undertakes this task. Also, securitization lends us the theoretical props to identify cer-tain junctures and movements in the state-factional group/ethnic com-munity interactions {{in the course of the}} crisis. The case study provides the empirical evidence which can inform securitization theory, and test its dynamics and efficacy...|$|R

I will focus on their vision for western democratic societies and international dimension of their theories. I will focus on methodology as well. The question I would like to answer is: to which extend could be these theories of democracy considered as the theories of liberal democracy? First I will deal with John Rawls's approach. In A Theory of Justice he introduced interesting idea of the social contract restoration and the establishment of two principles of justice in the original position. This work can be read as defence of human rights. Next I will focus on Political Liberalism. In Political liberalism Rawls is interested in securing human and civic rights for members of modern <b>pluralist</b> <b>democracies.</b> He is introducing here the idea of an overlapping consensus. This idea should maintain the stability of a system. The Law of Peoples is the attempt to bring his theory to international level. Next I will move to Jürgen Habermas.

40|$|Purpose: Existing {{literature}} on state socialist and communist heritage as form of tourist consumption predominately focuses on destination contexts, {{such as the}} former Soviet countries and the few remaining state communist countries (i. e. China, North Korea, Cuba). As a result, the visitation to places linked {{to the history of}} socialism and communism in the so-called Western <b>pluralist</b> <b>democracies</b> has often been overlooked and, at most, unacknowledged, especially as most research on ‘socialist’ heritage focuses on sites connected to statist heritage rather than sites connected to socialist movements. Design/methodology/approach: This paper aims to fill the gap in terms of research focusing on these types of sites, with evidence from a range of countries in Europe and the Americas. It does so by illustrating the presence and engagement with official and non-official communist/socialist heritage at varying levels of commodification. Findings: The paper concludes that not only is there a need to broaden the concept of socialist heritage but that its framing needs to continue to be understood from present day ideological discourses and struggles with respect to the marking of urban heritage tourist locations. Originality/value: This contribution advocates the broadening of the concept of socialist heritage by acknowledging the relevance of ‘hidden’ urban sites related to key socialist thinkers, socialist opposition to fascism, and civil wars in which the socialist movement was involved while also drawing parallels between the levels of socialist/heritage recognition and use as a commodity in relation to the historical narrative within the studied countries...|$|R

Bibliography: leaves 338 - 353. Introduction [...] Methodology [...] The Palestinians of Sydney: ethnic invisibility and {{political}} marginalisation [...] Palestinian diaspora attitudes to the homeland: the socio-demographic dimension [...] The Middle East experience {{and its effect on}} Palestinian attitudes [...] Conclusion. This study investigates the effect of the homeland experience on political attitudes held by a group of displaced stateless people. Empirical data was obtained by means of an attitude survey carried out within the Palestinian community of Sydney, Australia in 1990 - 91. The "snowball" method of sampling was used, in order to obtain access to a cross-section of groups within the community by means of activating personal networks. Attitudes towards both the host country - Australia - and towards the Palestinian homeland were surveyed. The findings suggest that homeland factors are more likely to affect the attitudes of Palestinian groups than are standard socio-demographic factors. The findings also challenge some of the conventional justifications for the discrimination and stereotyping encountered by Palestinians in both the homeland and in the Western Diaspora. The results of the survey have implications both for current moves towards an independent Palestinian entity in the Middle East, and for the successful integration of Palestinians and other stateless groups into <b>pluralist</b> <b>democracies.</b> Mode of access: World Wide Web. xiii, 353...|$|R
