5|$|<b>Parallel</b> <b>investigations</b> {{were carried}} out by Namdal Police District and the Accident Investigation Board for Civil Aviation (HSL). A {{conflict}} arose between the two as the latter {{in cooperation with the}} Norwegian Airline Pilots Association did not want a police investigation until after their report was finished. This caused the police to use two years to gain court permission to access the evidence. The report found no technical problems with the aircraft. However, it found several pilot errors and laid a large responsibility on the airline for lack of proper organization and routines. No-one was charged after the accident, but lead to a major restructure of operations and procedures in Widerøe.|$|E
5|$|Two <b>parallel</b> <b>investigations</b> were undertaken, one by HSL {{and one by}} Namdal Police District. The latter {{criticized the}} former because there were not given access to the cockpit voice {{recorder}} (CVR). Since 1989 both {{the police and the}} prosecuting authority had not been represented in the accident investigations. HSL emphasized that they had no legal obligation to submit the tapes to the police, that the police had not asked for the tapes after Widerøe Flight 839 in 1990 and that the Ministry of Transport and Communications supported this line. The reason for the rules was that the Norwegian Airline Pilots Association did not want the records from the CVR to be used in criminal cases against pilots. The investigation board stated that they would forward any information which supported criminal violations, while Namdal Police District stated that it was necessary for an independent police investigation to identify any criminal violations. The Norwegian Data Inspectorate's director Georg Apenes supported the police in their request for the tapes.|$|E

2500|$|Șăineanu's <b>parallel</b> <b>investigations</b> {{into the}} history of French {{included}} his 1905-1907 La Création métaphorique en français et en roman: images tirées du monde des animaux domestiques ("The Metaphoric Creation in French and Romance Languages: Images from the World of Domestic Animals"), which was structured into several tomes, respectively dedicated to the principal household companions. He also began work on major syntheses on French vocabulary, L'Argot ancien ("Ancient Argot") and its companion Les Sources de l'argot ancien ("The Sources of Ancient Argot", 1907). The former earned him the Volney Prize for 1908. Writing in 1999, historian Joan Leopold argued that this was a significant achievement, since the Volney Commission [...] "seemed to fear direct competition by foreigners"—other exceptions to this rule being Liu Bannong, Wilhelm Schmidt and Marie-Louise Sjoestedt. According to Leopold, Șăineanu was among the Volney prizewinners, [...] "particularly foreigners", who [...] "were never elected to an affiliation with the French Académies." [...] However, she also notes that [...] "there were no titles honored [...] which are now remembered as significant in the history of linguistics". She places the fact that Șăineanu [...] "did not achieve major university positions in France" [...] in connection with a tendency of awarding the prize to scholars who mainly did field work (Schmidt, Adolphe de Calassanti-Motylinski, George Abraham Grierson, Leo Reinisch and others). Literary critic Laszlo Alexandru passed a similar judgment: [...] "Lazăr Șăineanu's disappearance from the Romanian cultural space was received with an almost unanimous silence; but the emergence of Lazare Sainéan in Parisian scientific research would not itself result, {{for the rest of his}} days, in the much coveted and entirely deserved university chair." ...|$|E
