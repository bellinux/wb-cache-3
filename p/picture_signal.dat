50|$|Ampex's {{quadruplex}} {{magnetic tape}} video recording system has certain limitations, {{such as the}} lack of clean pause, or still-frame, capability, because the <b>picture</b> <b>signal</b> was segmented, or broken down into discrete segments to be recorded on the tape individually (only 16 lines of the picture in each segment).

The publications presented arc divided into those constituting the core of the submission and those which are considered to be of secondary material. In Section 2 a commentary on the core research publications identifies two closely related themes.

50|$|For older analog {{cathode ray}} tube (CRT) technology, display lag is {{extremely}} low, {{due to the nature}} of the technology, which does not have the ability to store image data before display. The <b>picture</b> <b>signal</b> is minimally processed internally, simply for demodulation from a radio-frequency (RF) carrier wave (for televisions), and then splitting into separate signals for the red, green, and blue electron guns, and for timing of the vertical and horizontal sync. Image adjustments typically involved reshaping the signal waveform but without storage, so the image is written to the screen as fast as it is received, with only nanoseconds of delay for the signal to traverse the wiring inside the device from input to the screen.|$|E
50|$|Video line {{selectors}} are circuits or {{units of}} other devices, fitted to the demand {{of the unit}} or a separate device for use in workshops, production and laboratories. They contain analog and digital circuits and an internal or external DC power supply. There's a video signal input, sometimes an output to prevent reflexions of the video signal {{and the cause of}} shadows of the video picture, also a trigger output. There is also an input or adjust for the line number(s) to be picked out and as an option an automatic or manual setting to fit other video standards and non-interlaced video. Video line selectors do not need all the <b>picture</b> <b>signal,</b> just the synchronisation signals are needed. Sometimes inputs for H- and V-sync were installed, only.|$|E
50|$|Nominal analog {{blanking}} or nominal analogue blanking is {{the outermost}} {{part of the}} overscan of a standard definition digital television image. It consists of a variable and arbitrary gap of black (or nearly black) pixels at {{the left and right}} sides, which correspond to the end and start of the horizontal blanking interval: the front porch at the right side (the end of a line, before the sync pulse), and the back porch at the left side (the start of a line, after the sync pulse and before drawing the next line). Digital television ordinarily contains 720 pixels per line, but only about 702 (PAL) to 704 (NTSC) of them contain <b>picture</b> <b>signal.</b> The edge may not be clean — some blurring can occur — and the location is arbitrary, since analogue equipment may typically shift the picture sideways in an unexpected amount or direction. Really old analogue equipment can cause the total width of 'active picture' to vary, usually down, perhaps to as few as 680 pixels.|$|E

5000|$|The {{earliest}} {{video cameras}} were mechanical flying-spot scanners {{which were in}} use in the 1920s and 1930s {{during the period of}} mechanical television. Improvements in video camera tubes in the 1930s ushered in the era of electronic television. Earlier, cameras were very large devices, almost always in two sections. The camera section held the lens and tube pre-amplifiers and other necessary electronics, and was connected to a large diameter multicore cable to the remainder of the camera electronics, usually mounted in a separate room in the studio, or a remote truck. The camera head could not generate a video <b>picture</b> <b>signal</b> on its own. The video signal was output to the studio for switching and transmission. By the fifties, electronic miniaturization had progressed to the point where some monochrome cameras could operate stand alone and even be handheld. But the studio configuration remained, with the large cable bundle transmitting the signals back to the camera control unit (CCU). The CCU in turn was used to align and operate the camera's functions, such as exposure, system timing, video and black levels.The first color cameras (1950s in the US, early 1960s in Europe), notably the RCA TK-40/41 series, were much more complex with their three (and in some models four) pickup tubes, and their size and weight drastically increased. Handheld color cameras did not come into general use until the early 1970s - the first generation of cameras were split into a camera head unit (the body of the camera, containing the lens and pickup tubes, and held on the shoulder or a body brace in front of the operator) connected via a cable bundle to a backpack CCU. The Ikegami HL-33, the RCA TK45 and the Thomson Microcam were portable two piece color cameras introduced in the early 1970s. For field work a separate VTR was still required to record the camera's video output. Typically this was either a portable 1" [...] reel to reel VTR, or a portable 3/4" [...] U-matic VCR. Typically, the two camera units would be carried by the camera operator, while a tape operator would carry the portable recorder. With the introduction of the RCA TK76 in 1976, camera operators were finally able to carry on their shoulders a one piece camera containing all the electronics to output a broadcast quality composite video signal. A separate videotape recording unit was still required.|$|E

40|$|The optimal {{analysis}}/synthesis filters {{giving the}} maximum coding gain are derived in subband schemes. The optimal analysis filters consist of {{the emphasis of}} the <b>picture</b> <b>signal</b> and ideal band-splitting. The characteristic of the emphasis {{is determined by the}} spectrum of the <b>picture</b> <b>signal.</b> A large improvement of coding gain is achieved by the subband scheme with the optimal subband filters obtained here. Approximated emphasis characteristic determined from a spectrum model of picture signals can be used and the ideal hand-splitting filters can be replaced by conventional subband filters since the degradation of coding gain due to these approximations is small. Computer simulation of super HD image coding by the proposed scheme is performed. SN ratio of the reconstructed image is increased and edges are reconstructed very well compared to the conventional subband scheme. The proposed scheme is very suited to super HD image coding since the improvement of SN ratio is large for images with high correlation between the neighboring pixels. 1...|$|E
