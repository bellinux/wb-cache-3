25|$|A {{legally binding}} {{contract}} occurs when one party makes an offer and receives an acceptance {{from the other}} party. A contract must consist of an offer and acceptance, the intention to create legal relations and consideration all must be present to make the contract legally enforceable. In contract law consideration {{is concerned with the}} bargain of the contract, each party to a contract must be both a promisor and a <b>promisee.</b> They must each receive a benefit and each suffers a detriment. The classic definition of consideration was given by the court in the case of Currie v Misa (1875) LR 10 Ex 153, referred to consideration as consisting of a detriment to the <b>promisee</b> or a benefit to the promisor, Lush J: “A valuable consideration, {{in the sense of the}} law, may consist either in some right, interest, profit or benefit accruing to one party, or some forbearance, detriment, loss or responsibility given, suffered or undertaken by the other".|$|E
25|$|The {{proof of}} {{possible}} detriment or prejudice, which will appear if the promisor {{is allowed to}} revert to his original promise, is required. In Ajayi V. Briscoe (1964) 1 WLR 1326 or where he alters his position {{as a result of}} relying on that promise when though he suffers no detriment. In Alan Co. Ltd V El Nasr & Import Co. (1972) 2 QB 18, Denning detained that detriment is not an essential element of promissory estoppel. Therefore, for a plea of promissory estoppel to succeed, there must be a change in circumstances of the <b>promisee.</b> This elementary composition of promissory estoppel has been the core and central topic of discussion {{in the evolution of the}} doctrine.|$|E
25|$|Given {{that the}} 1999 Act {{preserves}} the promisee's right {{to enforce the}} contract as it stood at common law, an outstanding issue is to what extent a <b>promisee</b> can claim damages for a benefit {{on behalf of a}} third party, if he has suffered no personal loss. In Jackson v Horizon Holidays Ltd, Lord Denning MR held that a father could claim damages for disappointment (beyond the financial cost) of a terrible holiday experience on behalf of his family. However, a majority of the House of Lords in Woodar Investment Development Ltd v Wimpey Construction UK Ltd disapproved any broad ability of a party to a contract to claim damages on behalf of a third party, except perhaps in a limited set of consumer contracts. There is disagreement about whether this will remain the case. Difficulties also remain in cases involving houses built with defects, which are sold to a buyer, who subsequently sells to a third party. It appears that neither the initial buyer can claim on behalf of the third party, and nor will the third party be able to claim under the 1999 Act, as they will typically not be identified by the original contract (or known) in advance. Apart from this instance relating to tort, in practice the doctrine of privity is entirely ignored in numerous situations, throughout the law of trusts and agency.|$|E
50|$|Joint promisees: Consideration {{given in}} return for a promise must move from the promisee; where there are joint <b>promisees</b> in a contract, {{consideration}} may be provided by one on behalf of both of them, or consideration may be provided by both <b>promisees.</b>|$|R
50|$|The offeree {{must provide}} consideration, {{although}} the consideration {{does not have}} to flow to the offeror. For example, it is good consideration for person A to pay person C in return for services rendered by person B. If there are joint <b>promisees,</b> then consideration need only to move from one of the <b>promisees.</b>|$|R
40|$|We {{investigate}} {{why people}} keep their promises {{in the absence}} of external enforce-ment mechanisms and reputational e¤ects. In a controlled laboratory experiment we show that exogenous variation of second-order expectations (promisorsexpectations about <b>promisees</b> expectations that the promise will be kept) leads to a signi 8 ̆ 5 cant change in promisor behavior. We provide clean evidence that a promisors aversion to disappoint a <b>promisees</b> expectation leads her to keep her promise. We propose a simple theory of lexicographic promise keeping that is supported by our results an...|$|R
500|$|It {{has been}} argued, however, that privity {{is not even}} a {{distinct}} doctrine, but rather simply part of consideration. Consideration is a rule that there must be a [...] "benefit or detriment" [...] involved in any contract, and that this must initially come from the <b>promisee.</b> It is argued that this rule and the doctrine of privity are two ways of saying the same thing - that to say someone is not a party to the contract is the same as saying that they gave no consideration in the initial agreement. This attitude is found in decisions by the Judiciary of England and Wales - in, Tweddle v Atkinson, Crompton and Blackburn JJ made the decision that they did because the claimant had not provided consideration, and the majority in Dunlop Pneumatic Tyre Co Ltd v Selfridge & Co Ltd based their judgment on a similar point. It is worth noting, however, that [...] Lord Haldane maintained in his judgement in Dunlop that, independent of consideration, it was a rule in English law that [...] "only a person who is party to a contract can sue on it".|$|E
2500|$|Hamer is {{very common}} reading in first-year {{contracts}} courses at [...] American [...] law schools. The view of contracts operative in Hamer was grounded in a particular theory of consideration, the [...] "benefit-detriment theory" [...] (as exemplified in the Exchequer Chamber's 1875 definition). [...] However, since the early 20th century (especially as embodied in the First and Second Restatements of Contracts), a dominant view has been the [...] "bargain theory." [...] According to the [...] "bargain theory," [...] a typical contract must consist of a bargained-for exchange where the consideration offered by one party (<b>promisee)</b> induces {{the making of a}} promise by another party (promisor), and the <b>promisee,</b> having been induced by the promise, gives this consideration. [...] Thus Hamer was decided {{on the basis of a}} legal theory that has largely been replaced or supplemented by newer theory, meaning that similar cases may be viewed differently by contemporary courts.|$|E
2500|$|Promissory {{estoppel}} requires (1) an unequivocal promise by {{words or}} conduct, (2) {{a change in}} position of the <b>promisee</b> {{as a result of}} the promise (not necessarily to their detriment), (3) inequity if the promisor were to go back on the promise. Estoppel is [...] "a shield not a sword" [...] – it cannot be used as the basis of an action on its own. It also does not extinguish rights. In High Trees the plaintiff company was able to restore payment of full rent (although estopped back rent was lost) from early 1945, but would have been able to restore full rent at any time after the initial promise provided a suitable period of notice had been given.|$|E
40|$|Gathering pattern {{contract}} jury {{instructions from}} every state, we examine jurisdictions’ treatment of noneconomic damages. While the conventional account holds {{that there is}} a uniform preference against awards of noneconomic damages, we find four different approaches in pattern instructions, with only one state explicitly prohibiting juries from considering noneconomic losses. Lay juries have considerably more freedom to award the <b>promisee’s</b> noneconomic damages than the hornbooks would have us believe. We substantiate this claim with an online survey experiment asking respondents about a simple contract case and instructing them using the differing pattern forms. We found that subjects routinely awarded more than the <b>promisee’s</b> baseline economic losses. In one of the categories of instruction—in which contract juries are instructed to award a tort-like form of remedy—subjects returned almost two times more in damages than the <b>promisee’s</b> mere expectation. The resulting picture of contract remedies is considerably more complex than the conventional wisdom portrays, but significantly more realistic...|$|R
50|$|The {{benefit of}} an {{equitable}} servitude runs with the land, {{and thus is}} enforceable by the <b>promisee's</b> successors if the original parties so intended, and the servitude touches and concerns the benefited property.|$|R
5000|$|Furthermore, where a {{contract}} exists between two parties and one party, subsequent to formation, promises to confer an additional benefit {{on the other}} party to the contract, that promise is not binding because the <b>promisee's</b> consideration, which is his entry into the original contract, had already been completed (or [...] "used") {{at the time the}} next promise is made.|$|R
2500|$|The Court of Appeals {{reversed}} {{and directed}} that {{the judgment of}} the trial court be affirmed, with costs payable out of the estate. Judge Alton Parker (later Chief Judge of the Court of Appeals), writing for a unanimous court, wrote that the forbearance of legal rights by Story II, namely the consensual abstinence from [...] "drinking liquor, using tobacco, swearing, and playing cards or billiards for money until he should become 21 years of age" [...] constituted consideration in exchange for the promise given by Story I. Because the forbearance was valid consideration given by a party (Story II) in exchange for a promise to perform by another party (Story I), the <b>promisee</b> was contractually obligated to fulfil the promise.|$|E
2500|$|The {{full force}} {{application}} of the equitable maxim estoppel only allows a litigant to “use it as a shield {{and not as a}} sword” restricts the application of this doctrine to as far as only to provide a defence to a party and not {{to be used as a}} cause of action against another. In Combe v Combe [...] 2 KB 215, CA a husband promised to make maintenance payments to his separated wife but failed to do so. The wife brought an action to enforce the promise invoking promissory estoppel. The court held that promissory estoppel does not create a cause of action and as such the requirement of consideration in formation of contract is still relevant. Promissory estoppel is a rule of evidence that prevents the promisor from denying the truth of statement which the <b>promisee</b> had relied. Denning LJ said: [...] "The principle does not create new causes of action where none existed before. It only prevents a party from insisting on his strict legal rights when it would be unjust to allow him to enforce them". However, this requirement seemed changed in light of the decisions in Evenden v Guildford City AFC [...] QB 917, here the courts held [...] "that promissory estoppel can be a cause of action." ...|$|E
50|$|The <b>promisee</b> {{can also}} sue the {{promisor}} {{for failing to}} pay the third party beneficiary. Under the common law, such suits were barred, but courts have since determined that the <b>promisee</b> can sue for specific performance of the contract, provided that the beneficiary has not already sued the promisor. Furthermore, if the <b>promisee</b> was in debt to a creditor beneficiary, {{and the failure of}} the promisor to perform caused the <b>promisee</b> to be held liable for that debt, the <b>promisee</b> can sue to recover the amount of the debt.|$|E

This contribution provides the readers with several case studies of agent deployment both in manufacturing and defence. Based on our experience the generalization of agents' applicability in these industry sectors is provided.

40|$|Promises lie at {{the center}} of persons 2 ̆ 7 moral {{experience}} of one another, and contracts {{lie at the}} center of their legal experience of one another. Many of the most important relationships in our moral and legal culture characteristically arise in connection with promises and contracts of some form or other: Persons 2 ̆ 7 families are connected to marriage promises, their work is connected to employment contracts, and even their citizenship is connected (albeit metaphorically) to the social contract. In all these cases, and in myriad others, promises and contracts establish relations among the persons who engage them. But in spite of the obviously communal character of promise and contract, the most prominent accounts of these practices remain firmly individualistic, seeking to explain the obligations they involve in terms of one or another service that these practices render to the several parties who engage them. Some theories emphasize that promissory and contractual obligations increase the freedom of promisors, by enabling them to project their intentions into the future and rendering plans of action that require such precommitments available to them. Other theories emphasize that promissory and contractual obligations reflect concern for the reasonable expectations of <b>promisees</b> and the harms that <b>promisees</b> suffer when these expectations are disappointed. And, most prominently, yet other theories emphasize that promissory and contractual obligations promote the well-being of both <b>promisees</b> and promisors, by increasing the reliability of social coordination and promoting the efficient allocation of resources. These theories differ from one another in many ways, to be sure, and they often cast themselves as competitors. But they are of a piece insofar as they all seek the roots of the morality of promise and contract in properties of the several individual participants in such agreements...|$|R
5000|$|An {{offer is}} {{a display of}} {{willingness}} by a promissor to be legally bound by terms they specify, made {{in a way that}} would lead a reasonable person in the <b>promisee's</b> position to understand that an acceptance is being sought and, if made, results in an enforceable contract. Ordinarily, an offeror is permitted to revoke their offer at any time prior to a valid acceptance. This is partially due to the maxim that an offeror is the [...] "master of his offer." ...|$|R
5000|$|An option {{contract}} can provide some {{security to the}} <b>promisee</b> in the above scenario. [...] Essentially, once a <b>promisee</b> begins performance, an {{option contract}} is implicitly created between the promisor and the <b>promisee.</b> The promisor impliedly promises not to revoke the offer and the <b>promisee</b> impliedly promises to furnish complete performance, but as the name suggests, the <b>promisee</b> still retains the [...] "option" [...] of not completing performance. The consideration for this option contract is discussed in comment d of the above cited section. Basically, the consideration {{is provided by the}} promisee's beginning of performance.|$|E
50|$|If {{the third}} party brings an action, and the <b>promisee</b> does so {{afterwards}} then the <b>promisee</b> cannot claim any damages. This {{is because the}} Law Commission felt that if the third party claimed compensation for the breach, the <b>promisee</b> would {{have no interest in}} the dispute any more. This fails to take into account situations where the <b>promisee</b> has suffered personal loss from the breach of contract. If the <b>promisee</b> brings an action first then the third party is prohibited from doing so, unless the promisee's action fails, in which case the third party is free to pursue his own claim.|$|E
5000|$|Consideration {{may move}} from the <b>promisee</b> or any other person. Under Indian law, {{consideration}} may be from the <b>promisee</b> of any other person i.e., even a stranger. This means {{that as long as}} there is consideration for the <b>promisee,</b> it is immaterial, who has furnished it.|$|E
5000|$|If a {{third party}} chooses to enforce {{the terms of a}} contract, he can do so against the {{promisor}} and has the right to any remedy that would be available if he was party to the contract, such as specific performance. An exception to this is the ability to terminate the contract and have it rendered void, since the Law Commission believed that [...] "the third party should not be entitled to terminate the contract for breach as this may be contrary to the <b>promisee's</b> wishes or interests".|$|R
40|$|Insincere Promises {{advances}} {{an economic}} theory of promissory fraud. Ayres and Klass {{argue that the}} doctrine of promissory fraud helps to induce efficient reliance from <b>promisees</b> by penalizing promisors who misrepresent the objective probability of their performance. The authors propose a revised doctrine aimed at inducing optimal reliance with minimal transaction costs. I show that Ayres and Klass have all but abandoned the role of intent in the common law of misrepresented intent. Ayres and Klass are concerned only with making available to <b>promisees</b> accurate information about the probability of performance by promisors. I suggest that whatever the merits of their approach, it is inconsonant with the everyday practice of promising, which as a moral practice attaches great significance to subjective intent. Contrasting the common law of promissory fraud with securities regulation of expressions of corporate intent, I argue that the “errors” which Ayres and Klass identify in the case law reflect {{the origins of the}} common law doctrine in the moral practice of promising. The relevance of subject intent to that practice explains why even Ayres and Klass would make subjective intent essential to the crime of false promise, and also explains why they couch their theory of the tort of promissory fraud in intentional terms. I conclude that, though their proposed reforms are consistent with economic theories of contract law, if given effect they would result in a radical overhaul of existing doctrine...|$|R
5000|$|Judges {{will often}} infer terms into the {{contract}} {{that the parties}} did not explicitly cite. For instance, in the [...] "satisfaction clause" [...] case, judges might infer that the parties intended a [...] "reasonableness test" [...] - that the clause could be satisfied if a reasonable person would be satisfied by the <b>promisee's</b> performance, {{regardless of whether the}} promisor himself asserts he is satisfied. (This interpretation is often used in cases in which a performance can be objectively evaluated, such as with the construction of a warehouse; the implied-in-law interpretation above is preferred where satisfaction is more subjective, as with the painting of a portrait.) ...|$|R

50|$|Section 4 {{preserves}} {{the right of}} the <b>promisee</b> to enforce any term of the contract. This allows the <b>promisee</b> to sue for any losses to themselves, but not for losses of the third party.|$|E
50|$|A problem arises with {{unilateral}} contracts {{because of}} the late formation of the contract. With classical unilateral contracts, a promisor can revoke his offer for the contract at any point prior to the promisee's complete performance. So, if a <b>promisee</b> provides 99% of the performance sought, the promisor could then revoke without any remedy for the <b>promisee.</b> The promisor has maximum protection and the <b>promisee</b> has maximum risk in this scenario.|$|E
40|$|Contract rules may be {{dissolving}} into tort-type {{notions of}} unfairness and injustice. Traditionally, promissory estoppel {{was viewed as}} a substitute for consideration in situations where promisors made promises knowing that <b>promisees</b> would act in reliance on them, the <b>promisees</b> did act on the promises, and the promisors refused to do what they promised to do, to the promisees detriment. The purpose of promissory estoppel was clearly one of fairness and preventing injustice by enforcing a promise not supported by consideration in very limited circumstances. In recent cases, however, courts have been approving the use of promissory estoppel as an independent cause of action to provide remedies for alleged contracts that otherwise would be unenforceable. If contract rules are frequently displaced by ad hoc decisions about unfairness, the predictability and reliability of business transactions will diminish to the detriment of all who engage in them. This Article will review the development of the doctrine of promissory estoppel and the variations in its acceptance among the states. It will consider the classification of promissory estoppel as an action at law or in equity and the doctrines weakening of traditional contract rules, particularly the statute of frauds. This Article concludes that it is not in the interest of businesspeople for their contractual obligations to be governed by the communitys shared sense of fairness rather than their specific bargained-for exchanges of promises, as governed by classic contract rules. The former provides no reliability or predictability, just confusion and more opportunity for litigation...|$|R
40|$|A casebook {{favorite}} {{for exploring the}} liquidated damage-penalty clause distinction is Lake River v. Carborundum in which a minimum quantity clause {{was found to be}} a penalty clause. In this paper I argue that the case was framed improperly. The contract was for the provision of a service—setting aside capacity—which was valuable to the buyer and costly to provide for the seller. The primary purpose of the minimum quantity clause was the pricing of that service. The case raises a significant damages issue: if there is an anticipatory repudiation of a contract that is take-or-pay or has a stipulated damage clause, should the <b>promisee's</b> ability to mitigate be taken into account when reckoning damages...|$|R
40|$|According to some ethical theorists, {{specific}} performance reinforces the moral obligation that promises should be kept. Economists sometimes argue that {{specific performance}} promotes efficient contract bargaining. This Article challenges this conventional wisdom, showing that moral evaluations {{and the willingness}} to bargain are themselves strongly affected by whether specific performance is available as a default remedy or not. Our insight {{is based on a}} novel experiment that measures the decisions and motivations involving the performance, breach, and enforcement of valid legal contracts. Our findings suggest that a specific performance default triggers conflicting moral intuitions about contract breach among contracting parties: it makes the ethical norm to adhere to the contract more salient to <b>promisees,</b> while promisors focus on the efficiency of the breach...|$|R
50|$|Once the beneficiary's {{rights have}} vested, the {{original}} {{parties to the}} contract are both bound to perform the contract. Any efforts by the promisor or the <b>promisee</b> to rescind or modify the contract at that point are void. Indeed, if the <b>promisee</b> {{changed his mind and}} offered to pay the promisor money not to perform, the third party could sue the <b>promisee</b> for tortious interference with the third party's contract rights.|$|E
50|$|Section 5 helps {{protect the}} {{promisor}} from double liability (having to pay {{two sets of}} damages for the same breach, one to the third party and one to the <b>promisee)</b> if the promisor breaches the contract. It does so in a very limited way, though - the promisor is only protected if he has first paid damages to the <b>promisee,</b> and the third party's claim comes after that. In addition the Act only limits damages paid in this situation, it does not eliminate them. If the <b>promisee</b> brings an action against the promisor and wins, any damages paid to the third party in a subsequent action must take the previous damages paid to the <b>promisee</b> into account.|$|E
50|$|The option {{contract}} provides {{an important role}} in unilateral contracts. In unilateral contracts, the promisor seeks acceptance by performance from the <b>promisee.</b> In this scenario, the classical contract view was that a contract is not formed until the performance that the promisor seeks is completely performed. This is because the consideration for the contract was the performance of the <b>promisee.</b> Once the <b>promisee</b> performed completely, consideration is satisfied and a contract is formed and only the promisor is bound to his promise.|$|E
40|$|In {{line with}} Veblen's {{contributions}} on the "dark side" {{of commercial and}} political relationships, we show how promises {{can be used to}} manipulate the "common man. " By imposing excessive access costs on potential <b>promisees</b> (e. g., citizens or consumers), a promiser (e. g., a politician or a firm) can benefit from making a promise without having to wholly fulfill it. These strategically manipulated access costs can be legitimized by the need to prevent abuse and fraud that exempts the promiser from being accused of cheating. Here, two case studies on promises offered to eligible households - the Food Stamp/Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program and rebates - are developed. Some policy implications are drawn and extensions are suggested. access costs, households, promises,...|$|R
50|$|There is {{an ongoing}} debate in the legal {{literature}} regarding the desirability of specific performance. Economists, generally, take the view that specific performance should be reserved to exceptional settings, because it is costly to administer and may deter promisors from engaging in efficient breach. Professor Steven Shavell, for example, famously argued that specific performance should only be reserved to contracts to convey property and that in all other cases, money damages would be superior. In contrast, many lawyers from other philosophical traditions take the view that specific performance should be preferred as it is closest to what was promised in the contract. There is also uncertainty arising from empirical research whether specific performance provides greater value to <b>promisees</b> than money damages, given the difficulties of enforcement.|$|R
40|$|This chapter defends an {{instrumental}} justification of contract law. The {{reason to have}} contract law is to make possible socially beneficial transactions that otherwise would not occur. The chapter thus rejects corrective justice accounts of contract (whether grounded in promisees’ expectation or reliance interests) {{and the idea that}} the point of contract law is to enforce the moral obligations of promisors. A strong connection between contract and promise is nonetheless defended. The basic role of contract law is to support the practice of the making and keeping of promises and agreements, and encourage its use. This makes performance or something just as good the natural remedy. The chapter argues that much economic analysis of contract remedies is myopic in that it either assumes what has to be justified (that <b>promisees</b> are entitled to the value of performance) or unjustifiably focuses on individuals transactions, rather than the practice as a whole...|$|R
