We measured the signal <b>pulse</b> <b>height</b> {{dependence on the}} particle flux. The detectors were tested over a range of particle fluxes from 2 kHz/cm(2) to 20 MHz/cm(2). The <b>pulse</b> <b>height</b> of the sensors was measured with pad and pixel readout electronics. The <b>pulse</b> <b>height</b> of the non-irradiated single-crystal CVD diamond pad sensors was stable with respect to flux, while the <b>pulse</b> <b>height</b> of irradiated single-crystal CVD diamond pad sensors decreased with increasing particle flux. The <b>pulse</b> <b>height</b> of the non-irradiated single-crystal CVD diamond pixel detectors decreased slightly with increasing particle flux while the <b>pulse</b> <b>height</b> of the irradiated single-crystal CVD diamond pixel detectors decreased significantly with increasing particle flux. The observed sensitivity to flux is similar in both the diamond pad sensors constructed using diamonds from the Pixel Luminosity Telescope (PLT) irradiated during its pilot run in the Compact Muon Solenoid (CMS) detector and in neutron irradiated diamond pad sensors from the same manufacturer irradiated to the same fluence of neutrons.

40|$|The {{counting}} efficiency for a liquid scintillation sample varies with its composition. Impurities from solubilizers {{as well as}} the specimen itself typically quench the available energy, reducing both the <b>pulse</b> <b>heights</b> and the total number of detectable events. Counting efficiency as measured in a <b>pulse</b> <b>height</b> channel is therefore uncertain, particularly when assaying low-energy radionuclides or dual labeled samples. An external source of gamma radiation is frequently utilized to quantitate the degree of quenching. This is done by analyzing the additional <b>pulse</b> <b>height</b> spectrum created from Corn pton electrons, which are produced in the sample by the radiation from the gamma source. The resulting data may then be used to correct for losses in <b>pulse</b> <b>height</b> and {{counting efficiency}}. The counts induced by the gamma source are usually measured in two <b>pulse</b> <b>height</b> channels and the ratio of the counts in these channels is used to quantitate quenching. This is called the external standard ratio (ESR). The fixed windows in these channels, however, limit the useful dynamic range of quench determination or may produce unacceptable statistical uncertainty in the estimated counting efficiencies of quenched samples. A new method of quench determination based upon relative <b>pulse</b> <b>height</b> (RPI-!) is described. Applying this technique to the external standard Compton spectrum provides a means for quantitating quench in tenils of RPH over a 30 to 1 change with less than 1 %standard deviation. By recognizing the quantum characteristic of weak scintillations, accurate <b>pulse</b> <b>height</b> restoration can be extended to quenched samples containing low energy radionuclides such as SI-i and l 4 C. Isotope energy, window settings, and true disintegration rate can be computed from the RPH quench value of unknown samples without empirical curves...|$|R

40|$|Systems that adopt organic {{scintillation}} detector arrays often require a calibration process {{prior to the}} intended measurement campaign to correct for significant performance variances between detectors within the array. These differences exist because of low tolerances associated with photo-multiplier tube technology and environmental influences. Differences in detector response can be corrected for by adjusting the supplied photo-multiplier tube voltage to control its gain and the effect that this has on the <b>pulse</b> <b>height</b> spectra from a gamma-only calibration source with a defined photo-peak. Automated methods that analyze these spectra and adjust the photo-multiplier tube bias accordingly are emerging for hardware that integrate acquisition electronics and high voltage control.
