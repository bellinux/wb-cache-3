40|$|When {{speakers}} name multiple semantically <b>related</b> <b>items,</b> opposing {{effects can}} be found. Semantic facilitation is found when naming 2 semantically <b>related</b> <b>items</b> in a row. In contrast, semantic interference is found when speakers name semantically <b>related</b> <b>items</b> separated by 1 or more intervening unrelated items. This latter form of interference is cumulative, as it increases {{as a function of}} the number of <b>related</b> <b>items</b> that have been named beforehand. Semantic facilitation has therefore been envisaged as a product of transient and fast-decaying activation of related representations, whereas semantic interference has been linked to longer-lasting changes in the connections between semantic and lexical representations. In this work we attempted to explore and compare the 2 phenomena jointly, by means of contrasting naming sequences with noncontiguous semantically <b>related</b> <b>items</b> and sequences with contiguous semantically <b>related</b> <b>items.</b> Results provide evidence that mechanisms responsible for semantic facilitation and interference may jointly occur in parallel, producing opposing influences on behavior. Importantly, semantic facilitation may exhibit cumulative features too, though these are immediately disrupted when unrelated items intervene...|$|R
