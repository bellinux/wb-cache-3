40|$|Abstract. The {{behavior}} of stoichiometric and near-stoichiometric NiAl at plasma spray deposition, without {{and with a}} bond coat, for coating layers realization on a low alloyed steel substrate has been investigated and is presented. In all variants, NiAl particle melting and their welding at the impact with substrate were observed. Furthermore, a relatively compact and adherent coating layer was formed and the NiAl was found to maintain its stability. These are all important factors for assuring the coating layer oxidation and corrosion resistance. Good results from the coating structure and adherence to the substrate points of view were obtained for the 45 : 55 Ni:Al composition, without a bond coat but adopting an Ar <b>protective</b> <b>surrounding</b> of plasma jet. The high resistance to corrosion of 45 : 55 NiAl composition was further validated through corrosion tests...|$|R

40|$|The recent (apparent) {{passage of}} the Voyager 1 {{spacecraft}} into interstellar space provides us with front-row seats to the complex interplay between the solar wind and the <b>protective</b> <b>surrounding</b> bubble known as heliosphere. The heliosphere extends radially out to ∼ 100 AU from the sun, and within this sphere of influence, the solar wind modulates the incoming flux of galactic cosmic rays (CRs), especially those at low energies. Newly formed stars, which support both strong magnetic fields and winds, are expected to produce analogous regions of CR exclusion, perhaps at elevated levels. Such young stars are encircled by molecular gas-rich disks, and the net removal of CRs from the circumstellar environment significantly reduces the expected CR ionization rate in the disk gas, most likely by many orders-of-magnitude. The loss of ionization reduces disk turbulence, and thereby affects both planet-formation and active chemical processes in the disk. We present models of CR exclusion and explore the implications for turbulence and for predicted chemical abundances. We also discuss means by which ALMA {{can be used to}} search for extrasolar heliosphere-analogs around young stars.

50|$|The outermost, <b>protective</b> sheath <b>{{surrounding}}</b> {{the spinal}} cord is called the dura mater.

The line carrying the drug may be threaded under the skin to emerge {{at the front of}} the patient, a process called tunneling.

50|$|Perineurial repair {{involves}} the individual fascicles and placing sutures through the perineurium, the <b>protective</b> sheath <b>surrounding</b> fascicles, the nerve fibers enclosed by the perineurium. Trauma to the nerve by cutting out each fascicle and fibrosis, a build up of tissue as a reaction, that develops {{due to the}} dissections and number of sutures is a problem. Group fasicular repair involves suturing group fascicles in the intraneural epineurium to line up the groups of fascicles. This is only applicable when fascicles are grouped. Intraneural scarring due {{to the amount of}} dissection and manipulation of the repair is a potential result that may counteract the advantage of alignment of the fascicles.|$|R
