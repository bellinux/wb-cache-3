25|$|Piaget {{administered}} a test in 15 boys with ages ranging from 10 to 14 {{years in which}} he asked participants to describe {{the relationship between a}} mixed bouquet of flowers and a bouquet with flowers of the same color. The <b>purpose</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>study</b> <b>was</b> to analyze the thinking process the boys had and to draw conclusions about the logic processes they had used, which was a psychometric technique of research. Piaget also used the psychoanalytic method initially developed by Sigmund Freud. The purpose of using such method was to examine the unconscious mind, as well as to continue parallel studies using different research methods. Psychoanalysis was later rejected by Piaget, as he thought it was insufficiently empirical (Mayer, 2005).|$|E
