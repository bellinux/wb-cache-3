The bat feeds during short activity <b>periods</b> <b>in</b> the evening and dawn, foraging around nearby forest areas for insects. Females give birth annually to a single offspring.|$|E

It produced the only unequivocal laterally directed blast known from Mount St. Helens before the 1980 eruptions. During Sugar Bowl time, the volcano first erupted quietly to produce a dome, then erupted violently at least twice producing a small volume of tephra, directed-blast deposits, pyroclastic flows, and lahars.|$|E

5|$|And Still I Rise {{is author}} Maya Angelou's third volume of poetry, {{published}} by Random House in 1978. It was published {{during one of}} the most productive <b>periods</b> <b>in</b> Angelou's career; she had written three autobiographies and published two other volumes of poetry up to that point. Angelou considered herself a poet and a playwright, but was best known for her seven autobiographies, especially her first, I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings, although her poetry has also been successful. She began, early in her writing career, alternating the publication of an autobiography and a volume of poetry. Although her poetry collections have been best-sellers, they have not received serious critical attention.|$|E

5|$|Around {{the first}} century AD, the Coptic {{alphabet}} started to be used alongside the Demotic script. Coptic is a modified Greek alphabet {{with the addition of}} some Demotic signs. Although formal hieroglyphs were used in a ceremonial role until the fourth century, towards the end only a small handful of priests could still read them. As the traditional religious establishments were disbanded, knowledge of hieroglyphic writing was mostly lost. Attempts to decipher them date to the Byzantine and Islamic <b>periods</b> <b>in</b> Egypt, but only in 1822, after the discovery of the Rosetta stone and years of research by Thomas Young and Jean-FranÃ§ois Champollion, were hieroglyphs almost fully deciphered.|$|E

Only when European botanists like Matthias de l'Obel, Andrea Cesalpino and Augustus Quirinus Rivinus (Bachmann) had done their best to match plants they knew to those listed in Dioscorides did they go further and create new classification systems based on similarity of parts, whether leaves, fruits, or flowers.|$|E
