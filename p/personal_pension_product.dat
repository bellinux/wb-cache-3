40|$|The European Insurance and Occupational Pensions Authority (EIOPA) {{considers}} retirement contractual formulas {{very significant}} {{in terms of}} the socio-economic context as well as for evaluating existing critical issues in the public pension systems. Besides, the technical committees involved in the matter are tackling the fragmentation of the private pension world in relation to both product design and schemes, and also consumer protection. For these reasons, in 2015 the European Monitoring Commissions came up with a public consultation for the creation of individual membership pension funds sharing standardized rules in all EU countries. Further, in 2016 EIOPA brought a technical report containing a proposal for Pan-European <b>Personal</b> <b>Pension</b> <b>Products</b> (PEPPP) {{to the attention of the}} European Commission, where Collective Profit Sharing Products were carefully considered, with the aim of protecting the members of insured pools from the volatility of long-term returns. Within an environment of low interest rates and continuous demographic changes, non-traditional life insurance products sharing the profit of the invested funds between the insurer and the insured parties may incentivize the underwriting of new contracts, if properly designed, audited and managed. In such a context, the paper develops a variable annuity pension scheme in which the insureds are entitled to participate in the annual financial results of the invested funds, with an embedded option to withdraw such results during the whole contract duration, that is, during both the deferment and the annuitization periods. The product performance evaluation is also carried out, with some addresses concerning the consumers’ perception of the contract profitability...|$|R
40|$|Theorists {{within the}} {{modularity}} tradition have hinted at {{the potential benefits}} of a “mirror” between the structure of a product development firm and the technical product it designs. At its heart, the so-called mirroring hypothesis seeks to examine two important and pervasive relationships: (1) the extent of an architectural mapping between firms’ strategic choices of product architecture and firm architecture – within-firm mirroring - and (2) between firms’ architectural choices and industry structures – across-firm mirroring. In supporting the theoretical logic for the strong test of the mirroring hypothesis (ie that the mirroring extends to the knowledge boundaries), advocates of modularity argue that its design principles permit an easier partitioning of knowledge and hence productive capabilities. However, despite the intuition that knowledge boundaries can be successfully partitioned, its enactment appears less prevalent in practice, causing a ‘misting of the mirror’ in respect to the strong form of the mirroring hypothesis. This paper investigates whether the strong test of mirroring in respect of the UK pension industry between 2000 and 2015 holds. We add to the existing contingent variables of complexity and rate of change in terms of misting the mirror the notion of value and how it would seem to determine whether knowledge boundaries are partitioned or integrated and, hence, whether mirroring is present or absent. The paper is structured as follows: (1) the extant literature is examined, focusing on recent contingent perspectives to the mirroring hypotheses, (2) the research method is explored, (3) findings from a retrospective study of the UK <b>personal</b> <b>pensions</b> <b>product</b> market between 2000 and 2015 are presented, (4) the findings are discussed and further contingencies are highlighted that may ‘mist the mirror’, and (5) some concluding remarks and directions for future research are identified...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{analyses}} and compares the performance, performance persistence and fund flows for UK equity unit trusts/OEICs and UK equity unit-linked <b>personal</b> <b>pensions</b> over the sample period January 1980 to December 2007. Unit-linked <b>personal</b> <b>pension</b> funds are an illiquid investment from the investorâ 8 ̆ 09 ̆ 9 s perspective since any invested capital is inaccessible until retirement whereas for unit trusts/OEICs capital invested can be withdrawn at any time. Since decreasing {{returns to scale}} from fund flows are the equilibrating mechanism in Berk and Green (2004) that results in no persistence in performance the illiquid nature of unit-linked <b>personal</b> <b>pension</b> funds should ensure more evidence of performance persistence in comparison to unit trusts/OEICs. I find significant evidence using performance ranked portfolio strategies that underlying portfolios that are only composed of unit-linked <b>personal</b> <b>pension</b> funds have greater performance persistence than unit-linked <b>personal</b> <b>pension</b> funds that have underlying portfolios that also include at least a unit trust/OEIC. This evidence is consistent with Berk and Green (2004) since the illiquid nature of <b>personal</b> <b>pension</b> funds results in an attenuated performance fund flow relationship restricting the equilibrating mechanism. However, there are anomalies in the performance persistence results in relation to Berk and Green (2004) {{but it could be}} due to the differential between the number of non-surviving unit trusts/OEICs and non-surviving unit-linked <b>personal</b> <b>pension</b> funds. I also find that the performance fund flow relationship based on abnormal returns from a Carhart four factor model for both UK equity unit trusts/OEICs and UK unit-linked <b>personal</b> <b>pensions</b> is convex but the performance fund flow relationship is more attenuated for the unit-linked <b>personal</b> <b>pension</b> funds. For the worst performing unit trusts/OEICs there are outflows on average whereas for unit-linked <b>personal</b> <b>pensions</b> there are fund inflows on average. For performance persistence tests conditional on underlying portfolio fund flows unit trusts/OEICs that have the worst performance but the lowest net fund flows in the ranking period have significantly greater subsequent performance in comparison to the unit trusts/OEICs that have the worst performance but the highest net fund flows in the ranking period. This empirical evidence provides support for Berk and Green (2004) but for the unit-linked <b>personal</b> <b>pension</b> funds the evidence is less convincing. There is very little evidence that UK equity unit-trusts/OEICs or UK equity unit-linked <b>personal</b> <b>pensions</b> produce abnormal returns. These results are robust across the single index (CAPM) model, the Fama and French three factor model and the Carhart four factor model for both conditional and unconditional models. There is also no evidence that unit trusts/OEICs or unit-linked <b>personal</b> <b>pension</b> funds can time the market. There is a significantly negative timing effect across unconditional factor models which becomes insignificant for the conditional models. There is also no evidence that unit trusts/OEICs have significantly different performance than unit-linked <b>personal</b> <b>pension</b> funds...|$|R

40|$|This article {{seeks to}} augment our {{understanding}} of consumers' attitudes and motivations when purchasing financial products. Using insights gleaned from focus discussion groups and a quantitative survey of consumers it focuses upon understanding {{the extent to which}} consumers' attitudes and behaviour differs for a range of financial products. Within the traditional structure and operation of the financial services industry consumers appear to express little choice. The rigid structure of the industry, coupled with the operation of cartels, meant that consumers had to accept the form and price of financial products and delivery channels. However the critical impact of deregulation and the emergence of new forms of technology have altered this situation by producing a highly competitive market for financial services. Consumers thus appear more disposed to change their attitudes when purchasing financial services. The outcome of these changes is that financial providers are now less certain of retaining their profitable customers or of cross selling high value <b>products</b> (such as <b>personal</b> <b>pensions</b> and investment <b>products).</b> It is, therefore, imperative that financial service providers better understand their customers' attitudes in an attempt to influence consumer decision making styles when purchasing financial products. This article accordingly seeks to analyse and understand more fully consumers' decision making styles for a range of financial products, including current accounts, insurance products, credit products and investment products. In the conclusion an assessment is made of the findings and the broad strategic implications for financial providers are examined...|$|R

The paper then assesses the performance of these pension funds relative to various asset pricing benchmarks, including a four factor benchmark that allows for momentum in stock returns, and allowing for market timing and conditioning on macroeconomic variables, and finds that average performance is not significantly different from zero. The paper goes on to examine persistence in performance of these pension schemes and identifies negative persistence at short horizons, but at time-intervals of six months to one year finds significant positive persistence, though this positive persistence weakens at longer time intervals. ...|$|R
