5|$|In December, 2,000–3,000 people {{gathered}} at the Mall of America in Bloomington, Minnesota, to protest the killings of unarmed black men by police. At least twenty members of a <b>protest</b> <b>that</b> had been using the slogan were arrested. In Milwaukee, Wisconsin, BLM protested the police shooting of Dontre Hamilton, who died in April. Black Lives Matter protested the shooting of John Crawford III. The shooting of Renisha McBride was protested by Black Lives Matter.|$|E
5|$|For a {{short time}} during his playing days with the Giants, Bonds {{temporarily}} changed his demeanor {{at the behest of}} a group of teammates, resulting in him smiling much more frequently and engaging more with others with a pleasant demeanor. Shortly thereafter, {{in the midst of a}} slump, the same group of teammates pleaded that he revert, having seemingly lost his competitive edge, and causing the team lose more. In spite of his <b>protest</b> <b>that</b> they would not appreciate the results, his teammates insisted, and Bonds complied, maintaining that familiar standoffish edge the rest of his playing career.|$|E
5|$|On November 8, 1864, the {{regiment}} left their Front Royal, Virginia, camp for Martinsburg, West Virginia. They stopped near Winchester, Virginia, and {{voted in the}} presidential election. After a short period, 240 officers and enlisted men departed for Wheeling, West Virginia. These were {{the men who had}} completed their 3-year enlistment, and did not re-enlist. These men were discharged on November 28, 1864. Among those discharged was Lieutenant Colonel John J. Hoffman, commander of {{the regiment}}. General William H. Powell did not remain with the army much longer, as he resigned to attend to family issues. His resignation was reluctantly approved after a <b>protest</b> <b>that</b> the army could not afford to lose an officer of his quality, and he gave his farewell speech on January 10, 1865.|$|E

5|$|One of {{the more}} {{significant}} impacts of containment was {{the outbreak of the}} Korean War. In June 1950, Kim Il-sung's North Korean People's Army invaded South Korea. Stalin approved and sent advisers to plan the North Korean invasion. To Stalin's surprise, the UN Security Council backed the defense of South Korea, though the Soviets were then boycotting meetings in <b>protest</b> <b>that</b> Taiwan and not Communist China held a permanent seat on the Council. A UN force of personnel from South Korea, the United States, the United Kingdom, Turkey, Canada, Colombia, Australia, France, South Africa, the Philippines, the Netherlands, Belgium, New Zealand and other countries joined to stop the invasion.|$|E
5|$|Scholars debate {{when the}} third Lombard–Gepid War started; {{it is agreed}} that it took place {{two years after the}} second war. The {{possible}} dates are either 551 or 552. The 551 date is upheld by those who argue that since in 552 Audoin had already dispatched 5,500 of his warriors to Narses' Italian campaign, the third Lombard–Gepid War must have already ended by then; against this scholars such as Walter Pohl <b>protest</b> <b>that</b> this is in contradiction with Audoin's reproaches to Justinian on the few troops sent against the Gepids, despite his massive support to Narses.|$|E
5|$|Throughout the Troubles, UK {{broadcasters}} {{were regularly}} required to stop or postpone the broadcast of documentaries and other programmes relating to Ireland. One {{of the most}} prominent instances of this was the 1985 Real Lives documentary for the BBC, At the Edge of the Union. The programme featured extensive footage of Sinn Féin's Martin McGuinness and the Democratic Unionist Party's Gregory Campbell discussing the Troubles, and following direct intervention by the government it was temporarily blocked from being aired. The incident led to a one-day strike by members of the National Union of Journalists, who walked out in <b>protest</b> <b>that</b> the BBC's independence was being undermined.|$|E

5|$|After enjoying life as {{a billionaire}} for a few days, Homer decides to throw a party before Burns returns. He heads to Moe's Tavern to buy some beer and invite his friends to the party. However, Moe informs Homer {{that he can not}} sell him alcohol on account of it being Sunday before 2:00 PM. After Homer is told {{the only way he could}} buy alcohol would be to sail out to {{international}} waters where there are no laws, he and his friends (including his son Bart) set sail in Burns' private yacht to throw the party there. Back at the Mayo Clinic, Burns discovers that he not only has all previously discovered diseases, but numerous new diseases the doctors have just discovered in him. However, the sheer number of diseases prevents any one disease from actually doing harm to him. This leads Burns to (incorrectly) conclude that he is indestructible, even though the doctors <b>protest</b> <b>that</b> even a slight breeze could disrupt the balance in his body.|$|E
5|$|In January 1858, Stone {{staged a}} highly publicized <b>protest</b> <b>that</b> took the issue of {{taxation}} without representation across the nation. The previous summer she and Blackwell had purchased a house in Orange, New Jersey, and when the first tax bill came, Stone returned it unpaid with the explanation that taxing women while denying {{them the right to}} vote was a violation of America’s founding principles. On January 22, 1858, the city auctioned some of her household goods to pay the tax and attendant court costs. The following month, Stone and Blackwell spoke on taxation without representation before two large meetings in Orange, and circulated petitions asking the New Jersey legislature for woman suffrage. Stone’s protest inspired other tax-paying women to action: some followed her example and refused to pay taxes, with one case reaching the Massachusetts Supreme Court in 1863, while others went to the polls to demand their right as tax-payers to vote.|$|E
5|$|Lieutenant General Kenney {{also became}} embroiled in the affair, having been {{informed}} by Bostock, {{and insisted on}} speaking directly to the pilots himself over Jones' <b>protest</b> <b>that</b> this was an internal RAAF disciplinary matter. During a visit to Morotai from his Manila headquarters, Kenney tried to persuade the officers to reconsider their positions, but again they refused. He agreed with Bostock that Cobby should be replaced by Scherger, and declared that if the pilots were court-martialled he would appear in their defence. The commander of the Australian Army's ICorps, Lieutenant General Leslie Morshead, who was at Morotai preparing for the Borneo campaign, also supported Cobby's removal. Morshead and other senior army officers were concerned that the dispute could disrupt preparations for the Australian landings in Borneo and consulted with Kenney on the matter. Jones resolved to dismiss not only Cobby but also his staff officers, Group Captains Gibson and Simms. Scherger took over as Air Officer Commanding No.1 TAF on 10May.|$|E

25|$|Parliament {{announced}} in April 1764 when the Sugar Act was passed {{that they would}} also consider a stamp tax in the colonies.

25|$|When Gore {{was running}} for the vice-presidential {{nomination}} in 1992, The New Republic {{picked up on the}} contrast between the references to Revelle in Gore's book, Earth in the Balance, and the views in the Cosmos article that could now be attributed to Revelle. This was followed up by Newsweek and elsewhere in the media. Patrick Michaels boasted that the Cosmos article had been read into the Congressional Record. The issue was even raised by Admiral James Stockdale in the televised vice-presidential debate. Gore's response was to <b>protest</b> <b>that</b> Revelle's views in the article had been taken out of context.|$|E
25|$|While {{in prison}} Allan used her privileged {{position}} {{to improve the}} levels of comfort for her inmates, including distributing confectionery and fruit to fellow suffragettes. Two months into her sentence, she barricaded {{the door to her}} cell, and it reportedly took three men with tools around three quarters of an hour to break into the room. Following this action, Allan started a hunger strike, a form of <b>protest</b> <b>that</b> had been pioneered amongst the suffragette movement by Marion Dunlop in 1909. However, following Dunlop having thus successfully forced the authorities to release her on health grounds, the British government introduced a policy of forced-feeding of imprisoned suffragette activists who refused food.|$|E
