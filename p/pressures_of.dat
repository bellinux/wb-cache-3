5|$|Bronchopulmonary {{dysplasia}} is reversible in {{the early}} stages by use of break periods on lower <b>pressures</b> <b>of</b> oxygen, but it may eventually result in irreversible lung injury if allowed to progress to severe damage. One or two days of exposure without oxygen breaks are needed to cause such damage.|$|E
5|$|If after 2–4days {{there is}} still {{evidence}} of an air leak, various options are available. Negative pressure suction (at low <b>pressures</b> <b>of</b> –10 to –20cmH2O) at a high flow rate may be attempted, particularly in PSP; {{it is thought that}} this may accelerate the healing of the leak. Failing this, surgery may be required, especially in SSP.|$|E

The {{relationship}} between inlet air <b>pressure</b> <b>of</b> (r +  1)th stage and outlet air <b>pressure</b> <b>of</b> r th stage {{is given by}} (9).

5|$|Shoe polish can be {{manufactured}} using large vats, reasonably powerful heaters and air conditioners. There is no set method of manufacture, although most methods use <b>pressures</b> <b>of</b> two atmospheres {{to ensure the}} naphtha does not boil off, and temperatures of up to 85°C.|$|E
5|$|The {{result of}} {{breathing}} increased partial <b>pressures</b> <b>of</b> oxygen is hyperoxia, {{an excess of}} oxygen in body tissues. The body is affected in different ways {{depending on the type}} of exposure. Central nervous system toxicity is caused by short exposure to high partial <b>pressures</b> <b>of</b> oxygen at greater than atmospheric pressure. Pulmonary and ocular toxicity result from longer exposure to increased oxygen levels at normal pressure. Symptoms may include disorientation, breathing problems, and vision changes such as myopia. Prolonged exposure to above-normal oxygen partial pressures, or shorter exposures to very high partial pressures, can cause oxidative damage to cell membranes, collapse of the alveoli in the lungs, retinal detachment, and seizures. Oxygen toxicity is managed by reducing the exposure to increased oxygen levels. Studies show that, in the long term, a robust recovery from most types of oxygen toxicity is possible.|$|E
5|$|Bats possess highly adapted lung {{systems to}} cope with the <b>pressures</b> <b>of</b> powered-flight. Flight is an energetically taxing aerobic {{activity}} and requires large amounts of oxygen to be sustained. In bats, the relative alveolar surface area and pulmonary capillary blood volume are significantly larger than most other small quadrupedal mammals. Due to the restraints of the mammalian lungs, bats cannot maintain high-altitude flight.|$|E

5000|$|Cluttering is {{a speech}} {{disorder}} that {{is related to}} <b>pressure</b> <b>of</b> speech in that the speech of a clutterer sounds improperly verbalized. However, cluttering is a distinct language disorder, whereas <b>pressure</b> <b>of</b> speech {{is a symptom of}} mania, anxiety, or schizophrenia. Even though cluttering sounds almost identical to <b>pressure</b> <b>of</b> speech, it differs in that <b>pressure</b> <b>of</b> speech is rooted in anxiety, where cluttering is not.|$|R
5|$|Galland himself flew on {{unauthorised}} interception {{flights to}} experience the combat <b>pressures</b> <b>of</b> the pilots, and witnessed USAAF bombers being escorted by large numbers of P-51 Mustangs. Nevertheless, on occasions the Sturmbock tactics worked. For example, on 7 July 1944 Eighth Air Force bombers belonging to the 492nd Bomb Group were intercepted unescorted. The entire squadron of 12 B-24s were shot down. The USAAF 2nd Air Division lost 28 Liberators that day, the majority to a Sturmbock attack.|$|E
5|$|In Japan, the two battleships of the 1903-4 Programme {{were the}} first to be laid down as all-big-gun designs, with eight 12-inch guns. However, the design had armor which was {{considered}} too thin, demanding a substantial redesign. The financial <b>pressures</b> <b>of</b> the Russo-Japanese War and the short supply of 12-inch guns which had to be imported from Britain meant these ships were completed with a mixed 10- and 12-inch armament. The 1903-4 design also retained traditional triple-expansion steam engines.|$|E
5|$|In {{the decade}} {{following}} World War II, Lambertsen et al. made further discoveries {{on the effects}} of breathing oxygen under pressure and methods of prevention. Their work on intermittent exposures for extension of oxygen tolerance and on a model for prediction of pulmonary oxygen toxicity based on pulmonary function are key documents in the development of standard operating procedures when breathing increased <b>pressures</b> <b>of</b> oxygen. Lambertsen's work showing the effect of carbon dioxide in decreasing time to onset of central nervous system symptoms has influenced work from current exposure guidelines to future breathing apparatus design.|$|E

5|$|Information {{from the}} {{peripheral}} chemoreceptors is relayed {{to a series}} of interconnected nuclei which comprise the respiratory centres in the medulla oblongata and the pons of the brainstem. This information determines the average rate of ventilation of the alveoli of the lungs, to keep the partial <b>pressures</b> <b>of</b> oxygen and carbon dioxide in the arterial blood constant. The respiratory centre does so via motor neurons which activate the muscles of respiration (in particular the diaphragm).|$|E

5|$|Nickel is a silvery-white metal with {{a slight}} golden tinge that takes a high polish. It {{is one of only}} four {{elements}} that are magnetic at or near room temperature, the others being iron, cobalt and gadolinium. Its Curie temperature is , meaning that bulk nickel is non-magnetic above this temperature. The unit cell of nickel is a face-centered cube with the lattice parameter of 0.352nm, giving an atomic radius of 0.124nm. This crystal structure is stable to <b>pressures</b> <b>of</b> at least 70GPa. Nickel belongs to the transition metals and is hard and ductile.|$|E

5|$|Plymouth Colony {{was founded}} {{by a group of}} English Puritans who later {{came to be known as}} the Pilgrims. The core group (roughly 40% of the adults and 56% of the family groupings) were part of a {{congregation}} led by William Bradford. They began to feel the <b>pressures</b> <b>of</b> religious persecution while still in the English village of Scrooby, near East Retford, Nottinghamshire. In 1607, Archbishop Tobias Matthew raided homes and imprisoned several members of the congregation. The congregation left England in 1609 and emigrated to the Netherlands, settling first in Amsterdam and then in Leiden.|$|E

A rise in the arterial partial pressure of carbon dioxide, and, to a lesser extent, a fall in the arterial partial pressure of oxygen, will reflexly cause deeper and faster breathing till the blood gas tensions return to normal. The converse happens when the carbon dioxide tension falls, or, again to a lesser extent, the oxygen tension rises: the rate and depth of breathing are reduced till blood gas normality is restored.|$|E
