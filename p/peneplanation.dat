50|$|After the {{beginning}} of the Miocene, the uplifted orogen underwent severe erosion, expressed by enormous molasses being shed into the foreland basins such as for example the Aquitaine Basin. In the Pliocene, a renewed uplift started, leading to the formation of huge alluvial fans at the mountain front, a notable example being the Lannemezan alluvial fan. Another important consequence of the uplifting was <b>peneplanation.</b> Several <b>peneplanation</b> levels have been found on very different heights (3000 to 2000 m in the Axial Zone, close to a 1000 m in the Pays de Sault, near 400 m in the Agly massif and at 100 m in the Corbières). They generally become lower in the east, with several uplifts {{towards the end of the}} Oligocene, towards the end of the Miocene (Pontian <b>peneplanation),</b> and towards the end of the Pliocene (Villafranchian <b>peneplanation).</b>|$|E

50|$|The Superior Upland is the {{province}} of the Laurentian Upland which projects into the United States west and south of Lake Superior. This upland, part of the Canadian Shield along with the Adirondacks, is a greatly deformed structure and is composed primarily of igneous and metamorphic crystalline rocks commonly associated with a rugged landscape. At some prehistoric period, this had a strong relief, but today the upland as a whole is gently rolling with the inter-streams surfaces being plateau-like in their evenness. Here they have altitudes of 1,400 to 2,300 ft in their higher areas, such as the Misquah Hills and Huron Mountains. In this province, we find a part of those ancient mountains regions that were initiated by crustal deformation and then reduced by a long continued erosion to a peneplain of modern relief. A peneplain with the occasional moderately high monadnocks left behind during the <b>peneplanation</b> {{of the rest of the}} surface. The erosion of the region must have been far advanced in prehistoric times, even practically completed, because the even peneplain surface is overlapped by fossiliferous marine strata from an early geological date, Cambrian. This shows that the depression of the region beneath an ancient sea took place after a long existence as dry land.|$|E

Part of the reason Wegener's ideas were not initially accepted was the misapprehension that he was suggesting the continents had fit along the current coastline. Charles Schuchert commented: During this vast time the split of Pangea the sea waves have been continuously pounding against Africa and Brazil and in many places rivers have been bringing into the ocean great amounts of eroded material, yet everywhere the geographic shore lines are said to have remained practically unchanged! It apparently makes no difference to Wegener how hard or how soft are the rocks of these shore lines, what are their geological structures that might aid or retard land or marine erosion, how often the strand lines have been elevated or depressed, and how far <b>peneplanation</b> has gone on during each period of continental stability. Furthermore, sea-level in itself has not been constant, especially during the Pleistocene, when the lands were covered by millions of square miles of ice made from water subtracted out of the oceans. In the equatorial regions, this level fluctuated three times during the Pleistocene, and during each period of ice accumulation the sea-level sank about 250 feet. [...] Wegener was in the audience for this lecture, but made no attempt to defend his work, possibly because of an inadequate command of the English language.|$|E
40|$|This {{thesis is}} an {{investigation}} of the question of <b>peneplanation</b> following the Rangitata Orogeny. Two opposed views had been put forward:- A. 	That the Rangitata Orogeny was followed by <b>peneplanation</b> and that both were of New Zealand-wide extent, B. 	That the Rangitata Orogeny was not of New Zealand-wide extent and that on the contrary, in the East Cape and Marlborough, the sequence was continuous and hence there was no <b>peneplanation.</b> The investigation thus necessitated the examination of Cretaceous sequences and their relationship to older rocks in certain key areas viz. East Cape, Marlborough, North Westland and Northwest Nelson. It is shown that:- A. 	Physiographic evidence of <b>peneplanation</b> in the form of exhumed fossil peneplain surfaces, and stratigraphic evidence in the form of deep weathering (=leaching) on an old landscape, exist in most places throughout New Zealand and the outlying Chatham and Campbell Islands. The apparent absence of exhumed fossil plain remnants in areas of thick Cretaceous marine sediments is considered to be due to the high dip of the cover beds and not that <b>peneplanation</b> did not take place. The dip is appreciably greater than the natural declivity of hill slopes and any fossil plain surface below would thus tend to be truncated rather than exhumed by erosion processes. The absence of stratigraphic evidence of <b>peneplanation</b> (i. e. leaching and quartzose coal-measures) in these areas is considered to be due to an increased tempo of diastrophism resulting in rapid marine transgression that eroded-off the leached zone completely in most places and was too rapid to allow the formation of coal-measures. B. 	The stratigraphic position of the peneplain is below the Paparoa and Pakawau beds of the Greymouth and Northwest Nelson areas respectively and not immediately below the quartzose coal-measures (Brunner-type beds). C. 	In all the areas examined major metamorphic unconformities are present either between Cretaceous sequences. The terms “covering strata” and “undermass” are valid and all the beds recognised as cover are everywhere younger than the youngest undermass rocks. D. 	The Korangan Stage is not valid and the Urutawan Stage is redefined to include the fossils formerly considered to be diagnostic of the Korangan. E. 	The lithological correlation of the Korangan Stage (= Koranga Sandstone in part) with the Taitai Sandstone at Mt Taitai is wrong and the Taitai Series is thus restricted to apply to only the Taitai Sandstone and the Mokoiwi Mudstone and their age correlatives when proved by fossils. F. 	The oldest known cover beds are ?Aptian and the youngest undermass ?Hauterivian. The amount of time missing is of the order of 20 million years which is considered to be sufficient for <b>peneplanation</b> to have taken place. It is thus concluded that both the Rangitata Orogeny and subsequent <b>peneplanation</b> were New Zealand-wide in extent and that at the time New Zealand was part of a much larger landmass that included the Chatham and Campbell Islands...|$|E

40|$|International audienceThe {{history of}} the {{peneplain}} in East Sayan was studied using apatite fission-track analysis (AFTA). This method is suitable for determining the formation time of the erosional surface and estimating its denudation rate. The largest known relic of the <b>peneplanation</b> surface {{in this area is}} the Oka Plateau, separated from the Kropotkin Ridge by the Oka-Jombolok fault. The AFTA shows that the peneplain on the Oka Plateau formed in the Late Jurassic-Early Cretaceous. This peneplain is much younger than the erosional surfaces that persist today in the Tien Shan, Gobi Altai, and Mongolian Altai (Early Jurassic). However, it is older than the peneplain on the Chulyshman Plateau, Altai (Late Cretaceous), suggesting asynchronous formation of the ancient peneplain in Central Asia. The similar exhumation histories of samples from the Oka Plateau and Kropotkin Ridge indicate that these morphotectonic structures developed from Jurassic to late Miocene as a single block, which underwent continuous slow denudation at an average rate of 0. 0175 mm/yr. Active tectonic processes in the Late Miocene caused the destruction of the <b>peneplanation</b> surface and its partial uplifting to different altitudes. The rate of Pliocene-Quaternary vertical movements along the Oka-Jombolok fault is roughly estimated at 0. 046 - 0. 080 mm/yr, which is several times higher than the denudation rate in this area. During the Pliocene-Quaternary, the Oka Plateau has not undergone any significant morphologic changes owing to its intermediate position between the summit plain and datum surface of East Sayan and to its partial shielding by basaltic lavas...|$|E

The {{transverse}} {{profile of the}} South Velebit, range is characteristic for its stepslike delineation. This property also substantiates a theory of a very complex evolution of the South Velebit during the orogeny development stage, marked by the alternate uplifts and relative endogenic passivness, favourable for denudation and pediplanation processes. Such a development resulted {{in the formation of}} the two clearly defined steps; one, the older and higher and the other one, younger and lower. Despite of their regional distribution, their discontinuity and different altitudes are very significant. Namely, while both of the pediments are very well developed on the seaside slope, the another Lika-slope is characterized only by the higher pediment, resulting undoubtedly from the specific morphotectonic evolution of the mountain range. Distribution, genesis and properties of the Jelar deposits are indicators of the pedimentation and pediplanation processes, during Upper Eocene until Lower Neogene. Their morphologic activity is connected with a formation of the higher and older fold-pediment. Due to the pediplanation processes, the extreeme south-east and north-west parts of the present day mountain range have been modified into one denudation level of <b>peneplanation.</b> Intensive tectonic, prevailingly fault-movements during neotectonic development stage, from the Mid Miocene onwards, lifted the mountain range to its present altitudes. The older pediment and a pediplane level have been disarranged.

40|$|<b>Peneplanation</b> of {{mountain}} ranges {{is generally considered}} the result of long-term erosional processes that smooth relief and lower elevation near sea level. Therefore peneplain remnants at high elevation in mountain ranges are used to infer posttectonic surface uplift. Such an interpretation has been proposed for the Pyrenees where high-elevation, low-relief erosional surfaces rose {{up to more than}} 2000 m. Because the Pyrenean foreland basins are filled with very thick continental deposits, which have buried the early jagged landscape, we challenge this hypothesis by pointing out that relief applanation does not necessarily require elevation lowering. We propose an alternative interpretation in which piedmont aggradation of detrital sediment that comes from erosion of the high chain induces the rise of the base level of the range, therefore reducing strongly the erosive efficiency of the drainage system and resulting in the progressive smoothing of the relief. Such a process allows a high-elevation, low-relief erosional surface to develop at the scale of the range. In the Pyrenees, occurrence of high-elevation, low-relief erosional surface remnants does not imply a posttectonic uplift, but is instead due to the dissection of the initial Miocene high-elevation, low-relief surface by the recent drainage system, the erosive activity of which has been enhanced by global climate change from the late Pliocene onward...|$|E

30|$|Denudational landforms {{are formed}} {{as a result of}} active {{processes}} of weathering, mass wasting and erosion due to the action of exogenic agents upon the exposed rocks. During these processes, the rocks on the land surface are worn away and the result is an overall lowering of the land surface. Cuesta, simple slope, residual hill and linear ridges are the different landforms of denudational origin. Cuestas are landforms with gentle dip slope on one side and an escarpment on other. Most of the hills of the Borivali National Park, Cumbala Hill and Malabar Hill are good examples of cuestas. Landforms with simple slope are produced by the wasting action of streams. This feature is seen in the north of the study area and in the Trombay region. Residual Hills are the end products of the process of <b>peneplanation</b> that reduces original mountain masses into a series of scattered knolls standing on the peneplain (Thornbury 1990).

In the central {{western part of}} the State of Goias, this trust, which is being dismantled by recent weathering, occurs parti-ally above metasedimentary rocks with copper sulfide mineralization. Some mineralogical and geochemical evidences show a close lithodependence with the immediately underlying rock. Isovolumetric and isoaluminium analyses show that during the weathering there was a depletion of elements. This depletion is slight for iron and aluminium but total for the alkaline elements. Silica shows an intermediate behaviour. However, we observe in the trust an absolute accumulation of iron. Where the topography presents gentle slopes a secondary trust has been formed, with the rock structure preserved. In this case the absolute accumulation of iron is more abundant than in the primary trust. This seems to indicate a vertical but also a lateral mobility of iron. Varions analyses show a clear relationship between iron oxides and hydroxides and coPPer in the top part of the weathered mantle. However, in the studied profiles, this relationship seems to be closer in the deeper portions than in the superficial horizon. The results obtained SO far suggest that for geochemical prospection, analysis of the iron-oxide-rich phases, for example, nodules formed by trust destruction, may give a better geochemical picture than other classical procedures...|$|E

In scope, this investigation does not include the Grenville Sub-province because of its indecisive geological relationship to the remainder of the Shield. Archean rocks are classed as such because; 1. they consist largely of vo 1 canics and illsorted sediments and when in contact with the less deformed (Algonkian Type) rocks are bound to underlie them unconformably. 2. the sediments approximate lithologically the younger Algonkian group, but are more strongly deformed. The purpose of this research is to render a summary of what is now known about the kinds and relative quantity of sediments comprising this ancient enigmatic rock assemblage. Time did not permit a more exhaustive examination of all reports published on these rocks; however, the writer believes the list of references of Appendix “A” (page 49) to be representative of that literature containing the better type of descriptive information. Thus, they are the basis of this thesis. It is hoped that paths of research as suggested subsequently will be of contributory value to our knowledge of the Archean.

The context of geological phenomena from the older to the younger in this region is as follows: 1) formation of an extensive sedimentary basin by downwarping, 2) deposition of the Sinda Beds, 3) long-term denudation and <b>peneplanation,</b> 4) intense activity of the northern boundary faults and formation of the Higher Terrace Deposits, 5) activity of the southeastern boundary fault, 6) formation of the present Semliki Plain as {{the floor of the}} rift valley, 7) completion of the present drainage system, and 8) formation of the Middle and Lower Terrace Deposits within the deep valleys...|$|E
40|$|The {{evolution}} of the Cenozoic deformation of the Cordillera Oriental and of the contact zone with the Altiplano in southern Bolivia is well documented in the Tupiza, Nazareno and Estarca basins. The tectonic evolution started at about 29 Ma. The period between 29 and about 22 - 21 Ma is marked by developement of a pull-apart basin related to N-S trending left-lateral strike-slip faulting. During this period, initial deposition consisted of andesitic lavas and detrital sediments (breccias; matrix-supported red conglomerats; sands and silts [...] .) of the Catati and Tupiza Formation, deposited in alluvial fan and flood plain environments. From 21 to 20 Ma, the tectonic setting evolved to N-S oriented thrusts, which had a dextral component. This event caused the Tupiza basin to evolve into a full-ramp basin, and triggered the developement of two piggy-back basins : Nazareno and Estarca. Both basins record detrital deposition (Nazareno Formation) in an alluvial fan environment. At 10 - 9 Ma, deformation in this area stopped allowing <b>peneplanation</b> during which time the San Juan de Oro erosional surface was formed and the fluvial conglomerates of the Oploca Formation were deposited. This segment of the Andes was then tectonically transported to the east, while uplift due to thrusting continued in the eastern Andean front and in the Subandean zone. (Résumé d'auteur...|$|E
40|$|International audienceIt is {{a common}} {{assumption}} that elevated passive continental margins have remained high since rifting and breakup. Here, we show that the Atlantic margin of NE Brazil has under gone a more complex history. Our synthesis of geological data, landscape analysis, and paleothermal and paleoburial data reveals a four-stage history: (1) After Early Cretaceous breakup, the margin under went burial beneath a thick sedimentary cover; (2) uplift episodes in the Campanian and Eocene led to almost complete removal of these deposits; (3) the resulting large-scale, low-relief erosion surface (peneplain) was deeply weathered and fi nally reburied at the Oligocene-Miocene transition; and (4) Miocene uplift and erosion produced a new, lowerlevel peneplain by incision of the uplifted and re-exposed Paleogene peneplain. Previous studies have identifi ed aspects of this interpretation, but we have defi ned the absolute timing and magnitude of discrete events of burial and exhumation that followed Early Cretaceous rifting and Eocene-Oligocene <b>peneplanation.</b> We suggest that a late sedimentary cover protected Paleogene weathering profi les until the present day. The uplift phases in Brazil are synchronous with uplift phases in Africa and the Andes. The Andean phases coincided with rapid convergence on the western margin of South America, and the Campanian uplift coincided with a decline in spreading rate at the Mid-Atlantic Ridge. Consequently, we suggest that both vertical movements and lateral changes in {{the motion of the}} plates have a common cause, which is lateral resistance to plate motion...|$|E
40|$|Seismic {{data from}} Petrobras (Brazilian {{state-owned}} petroleum company) show wide deformation and many reverse faults throughout the Solimões and Acre basins of northern Brazil. This deformation was observed {{for the first}} time in the Juruá River in 1976 in the Solimões Basin, and it increases toward Acre and Subandean basins from Argentine and Chile to Colombia and Venezuela. Structural inversions, block uplifts, and asymmetrical folds are attributed to compression and shearing stresses along this wide area. The severe diastrophism seen in the Juruá River area is of Late Jurassic (Kimmeridgian) age. It probably coincided with the final separation between Laurasia and Gondwana continents and the initial opening of the Central Atlantic Ocean. In Peru and neighboring countries, the same Late Jurassic orogeny is also present. It occurs in the form of widespread regional uplifts, structural inversions, tilting, faults and asymmetrical folds beneath a pronounced regional parallel or angular unconformity of latest Jurassic age, marking a first-order sequence boundary above the Upper Jurassic Sarayaquillo Formation and equivalent formations, as well as above older formations. The depositional hiatus at the upper part of the Jurassic System is attributed to reorganization of stress fields that resulted in basin inversions, followed by widespread <b>peneplanation.</b> The uppermost Jurassic or lower Cretaceous beds, deposited above this regional unconformity, were not affected by this tectonism in Brazilian and Subandean basins. The stratigraphy of Peruvian Subandean sedimentary basins is similar to that of the Acre Basin...|$|E
