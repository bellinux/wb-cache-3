25|$|People {{with the}} 47,XYY {{karyotype}} {{have an increased}} growth velocity from early childhood, with an average final height approximately 7cm (3") above expected final height. In Edinburgh, Scotland, eight 47,XYY boys born 1967–1972 and identified in a newborn screening programme had an average height of 188.1cm (6'2") at age 18—their fathers' average height was 174.1cm (5'8½"), their mothers' average height was 162.8cm (5'4"). The increased gene dosage of three X/Y chromosome <b>pseudoautosomal</b> <b>region</b> (PAR1) SHOX genes has been postulated {{as a cause of}} the increased stature seen in all three sex chromosome trisomies: 47,XXX, 47,XXY, and 47,XYY.|$|E
25|$|Many of {{the genes}} which escape {{inactivation}} are present along regions of the X chromosome which, unlike {{the majority of the}} X chromosome, contain genes also present on the Y chromosome. These regions are termed pseudoautosomal regions, as individuals of either sex will receive two copies of every gene in these regions (like an autosome), unlike the majority of genes along the sex chromosomes. Since individuals of either sex will receive two copies of every gene in a <b>pseudoautosomal</b> <b>region,</b> no dosage compensation is needed for females, so it is postulated that these regions of DNA have evolved mechanisms to escape X-inactivation. The genes of pseudoautosomal regions of the Xi do not have the typical modifications of the Xi and have little Xist RNA bound.|$|E
2500|$|Recombination {{between the}} X and Y {{chromosomes}} proved harmful—it resulted in males without necessary genes formerly {{found on the}} Y chromosome, and females with unnecessary or even harmful genes previously only found on the Y chromosome. [...] As a result, genes beneficial to males accumulated near the sex-determining genes, and recombination in this region was suppressed {{in order to preserve}} this male specific region. Over time, the Y chromosome changed {{in such a way as}} to inhibit the areas around the sex determining genes from recombining at all with the X chromosome. As a result of this process, 95% of the human Y chromosome is unable to recombine. Only the tips of the Y and X chromosomes recombine. The tips of the Y chromosome that could recombine with the X chromosome are referred to as the <b>pseudoautosomal</b> <b>region.</b> [...] The rest of the Y chromosome is passed on to the next generation intact. It is because of this disregard for the rules that the Y chromosome is such a superb tool for investigating recent human evolution.|$|E
50|$|The <b>pseudoautosomal</b> <b>regions,</b> PAR1, PAR2, are {{homologous}} {{sequences of}} nucleotides on the X and Y chromosomes.

5000|$|Pairing (synapsis) of the X and Y {{chromosomes}} {{and crossing}} over (recombination) between their <b>pseudoautosomal</b> <b>regions</b> {{appear to be}} necessary for the normal progression of male meiosis. [...] Thus, those cells in which X-Y recombination does not occur will fail to complete meiosis. Structural and/or genetic dissimilarity (due to hybridization or mutation) between the <b>pseudoautosomal</b> <b>regions</b> of the X and Y chromosomes can disrupt pairing and recombination, and consequently cause male infertility.|$|R
50|$|Normal male mammals {{have two}} copies of these genes: one in the <b>pseudoautosomal</b> <b>region</b> of their Y chromosome, {{the other in the}} {{corresponding}} portion of their X chromosome. Normal females also possess {{two copies of}} pseudoautosomal genes, as each of their two X chromosomes contains a <b>pseudoautosomal</b> <b>region.</b> Crossing over between the X and Y chromosomes is normally restricted to the pseudoautosomal regions; thus, pseudoautosomal genes exhibit an autosomal, rather than sex-linked, pattern of inheritance. So, females can inherit an allele originally present on the Y chromosome of their father.|$|E

50|$|The SHOX gene is a {{homeobox}} gene, {{meaning that}} it helps regulate development. The SHOX gene is composed of 6 different exons and {{is located in the}} <b>pseudoautosomal</b> <b>region</b> (PAR1) of the X chromosome and Y chromosome. Experiments have found similar genes in a variety of animals and insects.|$|E
50|$|The {{function}} of these <b>pseudoautosomal</b> <b>regions</b> {{is that they}} allow the X and Y chromosomes to pair and properly segregate during meiosis in males.|$|R

50|$|In May 1997, Nature Genetics {{published}} the discovery by Ercole Rao and colleagues of the X/Y chromosome <b>pseudoautosomal</b> <b>region</b> (PAR1) SHOX gene, haploinsufficiency of {{which leads to}} short stature in Turner syndrome (45,X). It was subsequently postulated that the increased gene dosage of three SHOX genes leads to tall stature in the sex chromosome trisomies 47,XXX, 47,XXY, and 47,XYY.|$|E
50|$|This gene encodes a multi-pass {{membrane}} protein containing two RING-type and one IBR-type zinc finger motifs. The encoded protin is an E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase that {{plays a role}} in the cytotoxic effects of natural killer (NK) cells. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants. There are pseudogenes for this gene on chromosomes X and Y in a possible <b>pseudoautosomal</b> <b>region.</b>|$|E

50|$|The golden path is an {{alternative}} measure of length that omits redundant regions such as haplotypes and <b>pseudoautosomal</b> <b>regions.</b> It is usually constructed by layering sequencing information over a physical map to combine scaffold information. It is a 'best estimate' of what the genome will look like and typically includes gaps, making it longer than the typical base pair assembly.|$|R
40|$|Outside the <b>pseudoautosomal</b> <b>regions,</b> the {{mammalian}} sex chromosomes {{are thought}} to have been genetically isolated for up to 350  million years. However, in humans pathogenic XY translocations occur in XY-homologous (gametologous) regions, causing sex-reversal and infertility. Gene conversion might accompany recombination intermediates that resolve without translocation and persist in the population. We resequenced X and Y copies of a translocation hotspot adjacent to the PRKX and PRKY genes and found evidence of historical exchange between the male-specific region of the human Y and the X in patchy flanking gene-conversion tracts on both chromosomes. The rate of X-to-Y conversion (per base per generation) is four to five orders of magnitude more rapid than the rate of Y-chromosomal base-substitution mutation, and given assumptions about the recombination history of the X locus, tract lengths have an overall average length of ∼ 100 bp. Sequence exchange outside the <b>pseudoautosomal</b> <b>regions</b> could play a role in protecting the Y-linked copies of gametologous genes from degeneration...|$|R
50|$|In mammals {{with more}} than one X {{chromosome}}, the genes on all but one X chromosome are not expressed; this is known as X inactivation. This happens in XXY males as well as normal XX females. However, in XXY males, a few genes located in the <b>pseudoautosomal</b> <b>regions</b> of their X chromosomes, have corresponding genes on their Y chromosome and are capable of being expressed.|$|R
50|$|Leri-Weill dyschondrosteosis is a pseudoautosomal {{dominant}} disorder {{which occurs}} {{more frequently in}} females and {{is due to a}} mutation, deletion or duplication of the SHOX gene. The SHOX gene plays a particularly important role in the growth and maturation of bones in the arms and legs. The SHOX gene is located within band Xp22.3 of the <b>pseudoautosomal</b> <b>region</b> of the X chromosome, which escapes X-inactivation. Homozygous SHOX gene mutations result in Langer mesomelic dysplasia.|$|E
50|$|The protein encoded by {{this gene}} is an {{interleukin}} 3 specific subunit of a heterodimeric cytokine receptor. The receptor {{is composed of}} a ligand specific alpha subunit and a signal transducing beta subunit shared by the receptors for interleukin 3 (IL3), colony stimulating factor 2 (CSF2/GM-CSF), and interleukin 5 (IL5). The binding of this protein to IL3 depends on the beta subunit. The beta subunit is activated by the ligand binding, and {{is required for the}} biological activities of IL3. This gene and the gene encoding the colony stimulating factor 2 receptor alpha chain (CSF2RA) form a cytokine receptor gene cluster in a X-Y <b>pseudoautosomal</b> <b>region</b> on chromosomes X or Y.|$|E

50|$|The <b>pseudoautosomal</b> <b>regions</b> {{get their}} name because any genes within them (so far at least 29 have been found) are {{inherited}} {{just like any}} autosomal genes. PAR1 comprises 2.6 Mbp of the short-arm tips of both X and Y chromosomes in humans and great apes (X and Y are 155 Mbp and 59 Mbp in total). PAR2 is at {{the tips of the}} long arms, spanning 320 kbp.|$|R
40|$|CSIRO 2009 Monotremes are phylogenetically and phenotypically unique {{animals with}} an unusually complex sex {{chromosome}} {{system that is}} composed of ten chromosomes in platypus and nine in echidna. These chromosomes are alternately linked (X 1 Y 1, X 2 Y 2, [...] .) at meiosis via <b>pseudoautosomal</b> <b>regions</b> and segregate to form spermatozoa containing either X or Y chromosomes. The physical and epigenetic mechanisms involved in pairing and assembly of the complex sex chromosome chain in early meiotic prophase I are completely unknown. We have analysed the pairing dynamics of specific sex chromosome <b>pseudoautosomal</b> <b>regions</b> in platypus spermatocytes during prophase of meiosis I. Our data show a highly coordinated pairing process that begins at the terminal Y 5 chromosome and completes with the union of sex chromosomes X 1 Y 1. The consistency of this ordered assembly of the chain is remarkable and {{raises questions about the}} mechanisms and factors that regulate the differential pairing of sex chromosomes and how this relates to potential meiotic silencing mechanisms and alternate segregation.

5000|$|... 48,XXYY {{syndrome}} {{is a condition}} related to the X and Y chromosomes (the sex chromosomes). People normally have 46 chromosomes in each cell. Two of the 46 chromosomes, known as X and Y, are called sex chromosomes because they help determine whether a person will develop male or female sex characteristics. Females typically have two X chromosomes (46,XX), and males have one X chromosome and one Y chromosome (46,XY). 48,XXYY syndrome results from {{the presence of an}} extra copy of both sex chromosomes in each of a male's cells (48,XXYY). Extra copies of genes on the X chromosome interfere with male sexual development, preventing the testes from functioning normally and reducing the levels of testosterone. Many genes are found only on the X or Y chromosome, but genes in areas known as the <b>pseudoautosomal</b> <b>regions</b> are present on both sex chromosomes. Extra copies of genes from the <b>pseudoautosomal</b> <b>regions</b> of the extra X and Y chromosome contribute to the signs and symptoms of 48,XXYY syndrome; however, the specific genes have not been identified.|$|R

50|$|The {{accepted}} {{hypothesis of}} XY and ZW sex chromosome evolution {{is that they}} evolved at the same time, in two different branches. However, {{there is some evidence}} to suggest that there could have been transitions between ZW and XY, such as in Xiphophorus maculatus, which have both ZW and XY systems in the same population, despite the fact that ZW and XY have different gene locations. A recent theoretical model raises the possibility of both transitions between the XY/XX and ZZ/ZW system and environmental sex determination The platypus' genes also back up the possible evolutionary link between XY and ZW, because they have the DMRT1 gene possessed by birds on their X chromosomes. Regardless, XY and ZW follow a similar route. All sex chromosomes started out as an original autosome of an original amniote that relied upon temperature to determine the sex of offspring. After the mammals separated, the branch further split into Lepidosauria and Archosauromorpha. These two groups both evolved the ZW system separately, as evidenced by the existence of different sex chromosomal locations. In mammals, one of the autosome pair, now Y, mutated its SOX3 gene into the SRY gene, causing that chromosome to designate sex. After this mutation, the SRY-containing chromosome inverted and was no longer completely homologous with its partner. The regions of the X and Y chromosomes that are still homologous to one another are known as the <b>pseudoautosomal</b> <b>region.</b> Once it inverted, the Y chromosome became unable to remedy deleterious mutations, and thus degenerated. There is some concern that the Y chromosome will shrink further and stop functioning in ten million years: but the Y chromosome has been strictly conserved after its initial rapid gene loss.|$|E
50|$|Methods of {{estimating}} {{the age of}} the Y-MRCA for a population of human males whose Y-chromosomes have been sequenced are based on applying the theories of molecular evolution to the Y chromosome. Unlike the autosomes, the human Y-chromosome does not recombine often with the X chromosome during meiosis, but is usually transferred intact from father to son; however, it can recombine with the X chromosome in the <b>pseudoautosomal</b> <b>regions</b> at the ends of the Y chromosome. Mutations occur periodically within the Y chromosome, and these mutations are passed on to males in subsequent generations.|$|R
5000|$|In humans, {{each cell}} nucleus {{contains}} 23 pairs of chromosomes, {{a total of}} 46 chromosomes. The first 22 pairs are called autosomes. Autosomes are homologous chromosomes i.e. chromosomes which contain the same genes (regions of DNA) {{in the same order}} along their chromosomal arms. The chromosomes of the 23rd pair are called allosomes consisting of two X chromosomes in women, and an X chromosome and a Y chromosome in men. Women therefore have 23 homologous chromosome pairs, while men have 22. The X and Y chromosomes do have small regions of homology called <b>pseudoautosomal</b> <b>regions.</b>|$|R
5000|$|The human Y {{chromosome}} {{is normally}} unable to recombine with the X chromosome, except for {{small pieces of}} <b>pseudoautosomal</b> <b>regions</b> at the telomeres (which comprise about 5% of the chromosome's length). These regions are relics of ancient homology between the X and Y chromosomes. The bulk of the Y chromosome, which does not recombine, is called the [...] "NRY", or non-recombining region of the Y chromosome. The single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in this region are used to trace direct paternal ancestral lines. For details, see human Y-chromosome DNA haplogroup.|$|R
