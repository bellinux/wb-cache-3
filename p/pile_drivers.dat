25|$|In October 2017, it was {{reported}} that underwater noise pollution can affect oysters as they close their shells when exposed to low frequencies of sounds in experimental conditions. Oysters rely on hearing waves and currents to regulate their circadian rhythms, and perception of weather events—such as rain—may induce spawning. Cargo ships, <b>pile</b> <b>drivers,</b> and explosions conducted underwater produce low frequencies that may be detected by oysters.|$|E
25|$|Timber coffer dams were constructed; {{they were}} 76ft 6in by 29ft with two skins, {{the space between}} being filled with puddle clay. James Nasmyth had a novel design of steam pile driver; it had first been used in Devonport Docks in 1845; it could deliver 60 to 70 blows a minute; the cycle time with the hand {{operated}} <b>pile</b> <b>drivers</b> formerly in use was four minutes. The drop weight was 1½ tons and its stroke was 2ft 9in; one was purchased from Nasmyth.|$|E
40|$|This {{demonstration}} {{illustrates the}} concept of impulse. A <b>pile</b> <b>driver</b> is dropped onto a piece of plastic, causing it to break. If a piece of foam rubber is placed {{on top of the}} plastic and the <b>pile</b> <b>driver</b> dropped onto the foam rubber, the foam rubber softens the blow, and the plastic sheet will not break. The impulse exerted by the stopping <b>pile</b> <b>driver</b> has been spread out over a greater time, and the force exerted on the plastic is thus decreased...|$|R

5000|$|There are {{a number}} of claims to the {{invention}} of the <b>pile</b> <b>driver.</b> A mechanically sound drawing of a <b>pile</b> <b>driver</b> appeared as early as 1475 in Francesco di Giorgio Martini's treatise Trattato di Architectura. Also, several other prominent inventors [...] - [...] James Nasmyth (son of Alexander Nasmyth), who invented a steam-powered <b>pile</b> <b>driver</b> in 1845, watchmaker James Valoué, Count Giovan Battista Gazzola, and Leonardo da Vinci [...] - [...] have all been credited with inventing the device. However, there is evidence that a comparable device was used in the construction of Crannogs at Oakbank and Loch Tay in Scotland as early as 5000 years ago. In 1801 John Rennie came up with a steam piledriver in Britain. Otis Tufts is credited with inventing the steam <b>pile</b> <b>driver</b> in the United States.|$|R
25|$|At this time, Allied {{forces were}} working {{to push the}} Ottoman Troops back from the Canal and deep into the desert. To get their {{supplies}} in, {{it was decided that}} a railway would be built by the engineers. There was however a slight problem. There was no way to get the locomotives needed onto these rails. The Bridging Train was therefore tasked with building new wharves to unload the locomotives that would be needed for the desert trains, which they did by converting two small vessels into floating <b>pile</b> <b>drivers.</b>|$|E
500|$|In 1970, tugboat workers went on strike, halting the {{transport}} of material to the construction site. [...] The Port Authority attempted other means of transporting material, including via helicopter. [...] When this method was tried, the helicopter lost its load of steel into the Kill Van Kull. [...] Some other mishaps occurred during the construction process, including disruption of telephone service in Lower Manhattan when telephone cables were crushed by <b>pile</b> <b>drivers.</b> [...] On March 16, 1970, an explosion injured six workers when a truck hit a propane tank. [...] In all, 60 workers were killed in construction accidents while the World Trade Center was being built.|$|E
2500|$|The Platte River was too {{shallow and}} {{meandering}} to provide river transport, but the Platte river valley headed west and sloped up gradually at about [...] per , often allowing {{to lay a}} mile (1.6km) of track a day or more in 1866 as the Union Pacific finally started moving rapidly west. Building bridges to cross creeks and rivers was {{the main source of}} delays. Near where the Platte River splits into the North Platte River and South Platte River, the railroad bridged the North Platte River over a [...] bridge (nicknamed ½ mile bridge). It was built across the shallow but wide North Platte resting on piles driven by steam <b>pile</b> <b>drivers.</b> Here they built the [...] "railroad" [...] town of North Platte, Nebraska in December 1866 after completing about [...] of track that year. In late 1866, former Major General Grenville M.

He could not bring himself {{to go back to the}} stockyards, there was danger of his becoming a murderer if he did; and as he approached the various bosses of the gangs of men in the street, he found himself again and again without the resolution to touch his hat and ask for a job. Once or twice he saw others quite as brutally rebuffed as he had been, and it was only by turning away that he kept himself from taking a hand in an encounter. Once or twice, when the overseer happened to be a decent and sociable fellow, Harold, edging near, caught his eye and was able to address him on terms of equality; but in each case the talk which followed brought out the fact that men were swarming for every place; indeed Harold could see this for himself. Ultimately he fell into the ranks of poor, shivering, hollow-cheeked fellows who stood around wistfully watching the excavation of cellars or hanging with pathetic intentness above the handling of great iron beams or <b>pile</b> <b>drivers.</b>|$|E
