Suetonius records the rumours of lurid tales of sexual perversity, {{including}} graphic depictions of child molestation, and cruelty, {{and most of all}} his paranoia. While heavily sensationalized, Suetonius' stories at least <b>paint</b> <b>a</b> <b>picture</b> of how Tiberius was perceived by the Roman senatorial class, and what his impact on the Principate was during his 23 years of rule.|$|E
5|$|For Lord Charlemont, Hogarth {{chose to}} paint the satirical Piquet, or Virtue in Danger (also known as The Lady's Last Stake, after a 1708 play by Colley Cibber), which, with echoes of Marriage à-la-Mode, shows an army officer {{offering}} an aristocratic lady a chance to recover the fortune she has just lost by gambling (with the implication that if she loses again, {{she will have to}} take him as her lover). After Grosvenor saw this painting in Hogarth's studio in 1758, he asked Hogarth to <b>paint</b> <b>a</b> <b>picture</b> for him as well, under the same terms.|$|E

At this time Delacroix was not famous, and had yet to paint a canvas that was to be hung for public display. In the event, he decided to paint his Dante and Virgil in Hell, but even as this painting was revealed to the public in April 1822, the atrocities at Chios were being meted out in full force. In May 1823, Delacroix committed to <b>paint</b> <b>a</b> <b>picture</b> about the massacre.|$|E

25|$|The film {{features}} two {{allusions to}} Alfred Hitchcock's film Vertigo. Like that film, it features recurring images of spirals, {{such as the}} 'Spirale' Cafe behind Manni's phone box and the spiral staircase down which Lola runs. In addition, the painting on {{the back wall of}} the casino of a woman's head seen from behind is based on a shot in Vertigo: Tykwer disliked the empty space on the wall behind the roulette table and commissioned production designer Alexander Manasse to <b>paint</b> <b>a</b> <b>picture</b> of Kim Novak as she appeared in Vertigo. Manasse could not remember what she looked like in the film; therefore, he decided to paint the famous shot of the back of her head. The painting took fifteen minutes to complete. The bed sheets in the red scenes also feature spiral designs which add to the allusion.|$|E
25|$|But {{this time}} on the {{frontier}} was after Martin had bought a large plot of land in Henry County with his earnings working for three years as an overseer for an uncle. Martin also gained 20,000 acres of land from Patrick Henry in a surveying contest at Powell Valley. Martin's youthful adventures on the frontier were grist for later stories... {{some of which were}} written by Martin's political foes and were slanted to <b>paint</b> <b>a</b> <b>picture</b> of him in an unkind light. One writer, a fan of Martin's political enemy, called him lazy and refused to describe him by his military ranking. General Joseph Martin may have been many things in his lifetime, but a quick study of his history and his accomplishments show that he was far from lazy. Eventually the soldiering, trapping and Indian fighting transformed the young Martin into a fearsome explorer.|$|E

Even the Billy Mitchell Boys and Girls Club with its playground and open spaces serves as a reminder of fields and woods where the children of Stifft Station Historic District played as their neighborhood grew from a sprinkling of scattered houses {{in the first years of}} the twentieth century to the fully realized and largely stable neighborhood it remains today. Stifft Station Historic District is a credit to its humble but handsome housing stock, reasonable real estate prices, minimal intrusive or unsightly infill and, significantly, its residents willingness to acknowledge the importance of an active neighborhood association.|$|E

25|$|Luis Hernando de Larramendi gained no {{dedicated}} scholarly work; {{the closest}} thing to a monograph are chapters dedicated to his father by Ignacio Hernando de Larramendi in his book, Así se hizo MAPFRE (2000). Though highly hagiographic, they provide the most detailed information available so far. Apart from well-known facts from his political career, the chapters offer also lots of private observations and recollections; they <b>paint</b> <b>a</b> <b>picture</b> of a Catholic taking communion almost every day, a profoundly idealist person, extremely sensitive to any sort of injustice and unrepentant in his political creed, but incapable of violence. Though humble and unpretentious, he is also portrayed as intolerant versus foolishness; this trait is considered moral defect, though also an obstacle in Larramendi’s professional and political career. Tending to solitude, he ran his law office on his own and was getting outpaced by modern legal companies; in terms of politics he built no personal following, relying entirely on his loyalty to the dynasty and trust in Traditionalist doctrine.|$|E
25|$|Edmonds later (to Liddell Hart in 1937 {{and in his}} own {{unpublished}} memoirs) told {{an exaggerated}} version of these events, that Wilson had stitched up the job for himself whilst acting as Director of Staff Duties, by recommending May ("a really stupid Irishman") for the job and placing himself as the second recommendation. Tim Travers (in The Killing Ground, 1987) used this story to help <b>paint</b> <b>a</b> <b>picture</b> of a prewar Army highly dependent on patronage for senior appointments. John Hussey, in his research into the matter, described Wilson’s appointment as “a collegiate decision about a difficult but suitable man” and dismisses Edmonds’ story as “worthless as evidence to prove anything about the structural defects of the old Army”. Keith Jeffrey argues that Travers’ argument is not entirely without substance – {{even if he is}} misinformed about this particular incident – and that Wilson’s career took place at “a transitional period” in which the Army was becoming more professionalised, so that Lyttelton was not able to use patronage to appoint May, his preferred candidate.|$|E

500|$|The army which invaded England in January and February 1138 {{shocked the}} English chroniclers.

500|$|Author Patrick Croskery {{described}} Animals as {{a unique}} blend of the [...] "powerful sounds and suggestive themes" [...] of Dark Side with The Wall portrayal of artistic alienation. He drew a parallel between the album's political themes and that of Orwell's Animal Farm. Animals begins with a thought experiment, which asks: [...] "If you didn't care what happened to me. And I didn't care for you", then develops a beast fable based on anthropomorphised characters using music to reflect the individual states of mind of each. The lyrics ultimately <b>paint</b> <b>a</b> <b>picture</b> of dystopia, the inevitable result of a world devoid of empathy and compassion, answering the question posed in the opening lines.|$|E

500|$|The main {{theme of}} obZen is [...] "human evil", {{according}} to Haake. The title is {{a play on}} the words [...] "obscene" [...] and [...] "Zen"; in addition, [...] "ob" [...] means [...] "anti" [...] in Latin. Therefore, the title suggests that the human species has found harmony and balance in warfare and bloodshed. Revolver Magazine finds the lyrics of the title track from obZen representative of the entire album: [...] "Salvation found in vomit and blood/Where depravation, lies, corruption/War and pain is god." [...] However, Haake claims, [...] "We don't dwell on hate and bad feelings as people. But with these songs, I think {{we really wanted to}} <b>paint</b> <b>a</b> <b>picture</b> lyrically that might be seen as a cautionary tale. We're going, 'Heads up. Here's what some of the parts of being human are about, {{and this is what we}} can be at our worst.' So it's more about being aware of negative feelings than actually living them all the time." ...|$|E

Sayo and Sota resolve to find the pond together. However, the route to the pond is dangerous, and involves passing through a train tunnel. In the tunnel Sayo trips and is nearly run over by a train. Sota manages to pull her out just in time, but is scolded by Mr. Arima, Sayo's father, for taking her to such a dangerous place. He tells his wife not to let them meet again. Later, Sota returns to the pond with the circus clown. Sota offers to <b>paint</b> <b>a</b> <b>picture</b> of him, but the clown refuses and advises Sota to paint whatever his heart desires. He decides to paint Sayo playing the piano after he watches Sayo play the [...] "Clair de lune". To save money for the painting paper, Sota goes hungry and eats just a few grains of rice each day.

500|$|Foliot {{was well}} known as a letter writer, and his letters were later {{collected}} as a book. The main manuscript for this collection, now held at the Bodleian Library, {{is supposed to have}} originated in Foliot's own writing office. About 250 to 300examples of Foliot's letters have survived, which together with his surviving charters gives a total of almost 500items. The collection was printed in a modern edition edited by Adrian Morey and Christopher N. L. Brooke and published by the Cambridge University Press in 1967, under the title of The Letters and Charters of Gilbert Foliot. Some of the letters have appeared in volumes five through eight of Materials for the History of Thomas Becket, from the Rolls Series, published from 1875–1885. Older editions appeared in the Patres ecclesiae Anglicanae series from the 1840s, and in Migne's Patrologica from 1854. The letters cover most of the period of Foliot's public life, and are one of the main sources for the history of that period. The historian David Knowles said of the collection that [...] "owing to its wealth of personal and local detail [...] is of the greatest value for the church historian". According to Knowles, Foliot's letters <b>paint</b> <b>a</b> <b>picture</b> of an active bishop and ecclesiastical leader who supported the Gregorian church reforms but did not meddle in politics beyond those of the church. His letters are typical of the educated letter writer of his time, refined and polished to an art form.|$|E

500|$|At the 2011 San Diego Comic-Con, Marvel {{announced}} that The Consultant would appear {{exclusively on the}} Thor Blu-ray release on September 13, 2011. It was directed by Leythum and written by Eric Pearson, with music by Paul Oakenfold. The short was filmed over 2-3 days. Clark Gregg and Maximiliano Hernández return to portray Agent Phil Coulson and Agent Jasper Sitwell, respectively, from the films. They are joined via archive footage by Robert Downey, Jr. as Tony Stark / The Consultant, William Hurt as General Thaddeus [...] "Thunderbolt" [...] Ross and Tim Roth as Emil Blonsky in his Abomination form. Co-producer Brian Winderbaum said the producers [...] "wanted to <b>paint</b> <b>a</b> <b>picture</b> of S.H.I.E.L.D. pulling the strings and being responsible {{for some of the}} events seen in the films. What better character to represent this idea than Agent Coulson, the first S.H.I.E.L.D. agent we were introduced to in the first Iron Man film?" [...] Gregg said he was told about the short film program in the same phone call that warned him Coulson would die in The Avengers. The actor noticed that the One-Shots could then provide more information on Coulson, to [...] "build the audience's relationship [...] him" [...] before his impactful death. The Consultant was written after A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to Thor's Hammer, due to the latter taking up 80% of the budget Marvel reserved for the two shorts, leaving a remaining budget [...] "for two guys talking". To help with this, Pearson included Sitwell in the short, who had a minor role in Thor, and had him and Coulson [...] "brainstorming {{a way to deal with}} this red tape bureaucratic politics of the Avengers Initiative".|$|E
