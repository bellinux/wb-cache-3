40|$|AbstractThe <b>pedestrian</b> mode is an {{important}} component of urban networks, and greatly affects the performance of the sidewalks and crosswalks, as well as the entire network traffic operations by interacting with other traffic modes (automobile, bicycle, transit). There have been many studies concerning different aspects of <b>pedestrian</b> behaviors, such as <b>pedestrian</b> walking speed, <b>pedestrian</b> delay, gap acceptance, signal compliance, route choice, etc. The Highway Capacity Manual (HCM) included the <b>pedestrian</b> mode in the HCM 1994 (update to the HCM 1985) and the HCM, 2010 provided several basic technical methodologies for evaluating the <b>pedestrian</b> level of service (LOS) of different urban street facilities. However, it does not fully cover the <b>pedestrian</b> operation in a great detail and it is missing some important findings in recent studies. The objective {{of this paper is to}} provide an overview of <b>pedestrian</b> operations in urban networks, to identify the important aspects of <b>pedestrian</b> operation analysis and to provide recommendations for <b>pedestrian</b> facilities in the HCM on the basis of a summary of available U. S. and international literature. The following topics will be discussed: <b>pedestrian</b> movement models, <b>pedestrian</b> delay estimation, pedestrian-vehicle interactions, and <b>pedestrian</b> travel time estimation. The major features of <b>pedestrian</b> movement along urban segments are the walking speed and available space, which were well examined in past studies. <b>Pedestrian</b> delay is one important measure of <b>pedestrian</b> operation, and its estimation models at signalized/unsignalized intersections are presented with respect to different scenarios. Modifications to the delay model in the HCM, 2010 are highlighted. Pedestrian-vehicle interactions highly affect traffic operations. Both driver and <b>pedestrian</b> behaviors in such an interaction were observed in the field and were examined quantitatively. <b>Pedestrian</b> jaywalking behavior was also observed and its impact on traffic is discussed. <b>Pedestrian</b> route choice at the strategic level and crossing location selection at the operational level jointly determine the <b>pedestrian</b> moving path and further affect the travel time at path-level. A model for estimating <b>pedestrian</b> travel time in an urban network is developed and presented. Such a model can be used to evaluate the facility performance as well as serve for <b>pedestrian</b> route selection.

A <b>pedestrian</b> hybrid beacon was {{proven to be}} effective in decreasing this unnecessary delay to the drivers at midblock <b>pedestrian</b> crossings when compared to standard signalized midblock crossings. Two <b>pedestrian</b> hybrid beacons were installed at midblock <b>pedestrian</b> crossings in Lawrence, Kansas. A study was conducted at these two locations to determine the effectiveness of the <b>pedestrian</b> hybrid beacon in decreasing the unnecessary delay to drivers by comparing them with a signalized midblock on Massachusetts Street, Lawrence, Kansas. In addition to the delay measurements for drivers at <b>pedestrian</b> hybrid beacon and signalized treatment at midblock <b>pedestrian</b> crossings, other parameters such as driver compliance rate, <b>pedestrian</b> compliance rate, and other driver and <b>pedestrian</b> characteristics were also studied.

A more than 90 % reduction in delays was observed for the drivers at the <b>pedestrian</b> hybrid beacon at midblock crossings compared to the signalized crossing.

Best practices for <b>pedestrian</b> planning suggest that jurisdictions prioritize <b>pedestrian</b> projects based on a variety of concerns, such as high <b>pedestrian</b> activity, <b>pedestrian</b> safety, accessibility to transit and mobility for persons with disabilities, children and older adults.
