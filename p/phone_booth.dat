5|$|Principal {{photography}} for {{the pilot}} took place in Los Angeles, though subsequent episodes of the series are filmed in Vancouver, British Columbia to save money. The bridge sequences were shot at Lake Piru, near a War of the Worlds filming location, and the library and <b>phone</b> <b>booth</b> scenes were filmed at an elementary school. Triplet babies portrayed Sam in the episode's teaser, and production {{found it difficult to}} get them to cry on cue. Though a real house served as the first-story level in the teaser, the upstairs was constructed on a sound stage because of the special effects required for Mary's fiery death. Script rewrites for the opening sequence—a better introduction for Sam was needed—required reshoots on the set of The O.C. two months after principal photography.|$|E

Its owner struggles to chase the ball but then manages to catch it for a second. Unfortunately, the ball escapes and is run over by a truck driven by The Chemical Brothers.

5|$|The {{music video}} begins as police {{officers}} and Reddick discuss the criminal duo and ways to catch them.

25|$|When a {{practical}} effect cannot be accomplished, the crew turns to Entity FX to create digital imagery {{for a given}} scene. Sometimes this imagery is to substitute action sequences that they cannot do on-site, and other times {{it is used to}} create subtle foreground or background effects. For instance, a matte painting is used to establish the Metropolis background, which is composed of buildings from several modern-day cities in addition to Vancouver; they include Singapore and Hong Kong among others. For the scene where Clark rips his shirt open in the <b>phone</b> <b>booth,</b> revealing the tattoo, visual effects were added to the tattoo illuminating it. But in order to add the effects, the middle pane of glass was removed from the <b>phone</b> <b>booth</b> so that the special effects team had a clear line to Welling’s chest; they re-added the middle pane digitally, adding reflections so that it looked natural.|$|E
