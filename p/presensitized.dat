5000|$|Screenless {{lithography}} is a reprographic {{technique for}} halftoning dating to 1855, when the French chemist and civil engineer Alphonse Poitevin discovered the light-sensitive properties of bichromated gelatin and invented both the photolithography and collotype processes. After {{the invention of}} the halftone screen in the 1880s, screenless lithography was abandoned. Until the end of World War II, two kinds of photomechanically made plates were used in lithography: albumin plates and deep-etch plates. <b>Presensitized</b> plates appeared in the 1950s, and wipe-on plates appeared in the 1960s.|$|E
40|$|The role of presensitizing murine {{recipients}} with donor spleen cells {{prior to}} T cell-depleted or -repleted H- 2 compatible allogeneic {{bone marrow transplantation}} (BMT) was investigated at two different doses of total body irradiation (TBI). Recipients that were <b>presensitized</b> with 2 x 10 (7) irradiated donor spleen cells at 1 week before a sublethal dose of 6 Gy TBI and BMT showed no evidence of donor blood chimerism while unsensitized recipients showed about 80 % donor engraftment as determined by blood Gpi phenotyping. After raising the TBI dose to 9. 5 Gy an increase in mortality from marrow failure was observed in <b>presensitized</b> animals. No significant engraftment-promoting effect of up to 2 x 10 (6) T cells (20 % of total marrow dose) was seen either in <b>presensitized</b> or unsensitized mice. It can be concluded that <b>presensitized</b> recipients {{are more susceptible to}} acute marrow rejection and that T cells added to the bone marrow did not influence the level of donor engraftment in these recipients...|$|E
40|$|Staphylococcal {{pyrogenic}} exotoxin (PE) types A and B {{were tested}} for {{their role in}} production of a scarlatiniform rash. The PEs elicited minimal skin reactions after intracutaneous injection into animals not <b>presensitized</b> to the toxins. In contrast, erythematous injection into animals not <b>presensitized</b> to the toxins. In contrast, erythematous and edematous rashes were produced after administration of either PE to animals <b>presensitized</b> to homologous toxin. After 3 to 4 days, the erythematous areas showed membranous desquamation. Staphylococcal PEs also enhanced delayed and Arthus hypersensitivity skin reactions developed against unrelated proteins; the reactions subsequently desquamated. In addition, animals previously sensitized to either staphylococcal PE type developed scarlatiniform rashes after challenged with heterologous staphylococcal or any group A streptococcal PE. The data suggest that staphylococcal PEs produce scarlet fever-like rashes comparable to group A streptococcal PEs and that all PE types contain a common core moiety against which delayed hypersensitivity may be developed...|$|E
40|$|Changes in the {{formation}} of antibodies to sheep red blood cells (sRBC) in the presence of Brucella extracts was studied in mice whose spleen cells were assayed by the Jerne procedure. Two strains of female mice were employed. Brucella extracts were prepared: (i) by trichloroacetic acid extraction (LPSN), (ii) by phenol extraction (LPS), and (iii) by hot acetic acid hydrolysis (Ps). B. abortus LPSN and B. melitensis LPSN or LPS, administered with sRBC, stimulated the specific response to sRBC, but only at high doses of endotoxins. B. abortus LPSN and B. melitensis LPSN suppressed nonspecific responses against horse red blood cells (hRBC), in contrast to the typical events following administration of Serratia marcescens endotoxin (or endotoxins from other ubiquitous organisms). In CD- 1 mice, B. abortus Ps depressed the specific anti-sRBC response. Attempts to <b>presensitize</b> mice with abortus LPSN resulted in a stimulation of the response to sRBC, but pretreatment with B. melitensis LPSN had an inhibitory effect. When injected alone, Brucella endotoxins activated anti-sRBC antibody-forming cells but not anti-hRBC cells. B. abortus Ps was unable to modify the background number of anti-sRBC cells and inhibited the hRBC response. These data suggest (i) that there exists a “common antigen” between Brucella cells and sRBC and (ii) that the so-called primary response to endotoxins from ubiquitous organisms represents a secondary response to already naturally sensitized animals...|$|R
40|$|Since new {{technologies}} based on solid phase assays (SPA) have been routinely {{incorporated in the}} transplant immunology laboratory, the presence of pretransplantation donor-specific antibodies (DSA) against human leukocyte antigen (HLA) molecules has generally been considered as {{a risk factor for}} acute rejection (AR) and, in particular, for acute humoral rejection (AHR). We retrospectively studied 113 kidney transplant recipients who had negative prospective T-cell and B-cell complement-dependent cytotoxicity (CDC) crossmatches at the time of transplant. Pretransplantation sera were screened for the presence of circulating anti-HLA antibody and DSA by using highly sensitive and HLA-specific Luminex assay, and the results were correlated with AR and AHR posttransplantation. We found that approximately half of our patient population (55 / 113, 48. 7 %) had circulating anti-HLA antibody pretransplantation. Of 113 patients, 11 (9. 7 %) had HLA-DSA. Of 11 rejection episodes post-transplant, only two patients had pretransplantation DSA, of whom one had a severe AHR (C 4 d positive). One-year allograft survival was similar between the pretransplantation DSA-positive and -negative groups. Number, class, and intensity of pretransplantation DSA, as well as <b>presensitizing</b> events, could not predict AR. We conclude that, based on the presence of pretransplantation DSA, post-transplantation acute rejections episodes could not have been predicted. The only AHR episode occurred in a recipient with pretransplantation DSA. More work should be performed to better delineate the precise clinical significance of detecting low titers of DSA before transplantation...|$|R
40|$|Recent work {{suggests}} a participation of mitochondria in apoptotic cell death. This role includes {{the release of}} apoptogenic molecules into the cytosol preceding or after a loss of mitochondrial membrane potential ΔΨm. The two uncouplers of oxidative phosphorylation carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenylhydrazone (CCCP) and 2, 4 -dinitrophenol (DNP) reduce ΔΨm by direct attack of the proton gradient across the inner mitochondrial membrane. Here we show that both compounds enhance the apoptosis-inducing capacity of Fas/APO- 1 /CD 95 signaling in Jurkat and CEM cells without causing apoptotic changes on their own account. This amplification occurred upstream or {{at the level of}} caspases and was not inhibited by Bcl- 2. The effect could be blocked by the cowpox protein CrmA and is thus likely to require caspase 8 activity. Apoptosis induction by staurosporine in Jurkat cells as well as by Fas in SKW 6 cells was unaffected by CCCP and DNP. The role of cytochrome c during Fas-DNP signaling was investigated. No early cytochrome c release from mitochondria was detected by Western blotting. Functional assays with cytoplasmic preparations from Fas-DNP-treated cells also indicated that there was no major contribution by cytochrome c or caspase 9 to the activation of effector caspases. Furthermore, an increase of rhodamine- 123 uptake into intact cells, which has been explained by mitochondrial swelling, occurred considerably later than the caspase activation and was blocked by Z-VAD-fmk. These data show that uncouplers of oxidative phosphorylation can <b>presensitize</b> some but not all cells for a Fas death signal and provide information about the existence of separate pathways in the induction of apoptosis...|$|R
40|$|Normal and isoimmune C 3 H and C 57 BL spleen {{cells were}} {{transferred}} intravenously into normal and irradiated allogeneic recipients and {{the fate of}} the donor cells determined by differential cytotoxicity and radioautographic techniques. It was found that spleen cells sensitized against their prospective recipients could be identified in the host's spleen for 1 day, whereas normal donor cells survived 2 to 3 days. Spleen cells <b>presensitized</b> with an indifferent antigen had survival times similar to normal donor cells. Irradiation of the recipients prior to cell transfer eliminated any difference in survival times between normal and <b>presensitized</b> donor cells in allogeneic hosts. It is concluded that the host {{plays an important role in}} the rapid destruction of spleen cells <b>presensitized</b> against host antigens. Experiments in which sensitized and normal C 57 BL spleen cells were mixed and transferred into normal C 3 H mice indicated that as little as 5 to 10 per cent of the donor cell population need be sensitized for the entire mixture to behave as if it were obtained from a sensitized animal, as shown by its elimination in the 1 -day interval...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT-The role of {{hypoglycemia}} in tumor necrosis factor (TNF) {{production was}} examined. TNF was produced from sera of animals <b>presensitized</b> with reticuloendothelial system stimulants after lipopolysaccharide (LPS) challenge. Blood glucose was strongly reduced during TNF production. Glucose administration to <b>presensitized</b> mice (before LPS challenge) caused inhibition of TNF production. Exogenous insulin injection inhibited TNF produc-tion in a dose-related manner. Peritoneal exudate cells (PEC) from Propionibacterium acnes-primed mice revealed increased glucose consumption during in vitro TNF production but showed {{no relationship between}} the degree of glucose consumption {{and the ability to}} produce TNF. Insulin addition to the culture medium caused inhibition of TNF production from PEC, which indicated that insulin may block TNF production from macrophages.

40|$|A {{multifaceted}} immunotherapeutic {{strategy that}} includes {{hematopoietic stem cell}} (HSC) transplantation, T-cell adoptive transfer, and tumor vaccination can effectively eliminate established neuroblastoma tumors in mice. In vivo depletion of CD 4 + T cells in HSC transplantation recipients results in increased antitumor immunity when adoptively transferred T cells are <b>presensitized,</b> but development of T-cell memory is severely compromised. Because increased percentages of regulatory T (Treg) cells are seen in HSC transplantation recipients, here we hypothesized that the inhibitory effect of CD 4 + T cells is {{primarily because of the}} presence of expanded Treg cells. Remarkably, adoptive transfer of <b>presensitized</b> CD 25 -depleted T cells increased tumor vaccine efficacy. The enhanced antitumor effect achieved by ex vivo depletion of CD 25 + Treg cells was similar to that achieved by in vivo depletion of all CD 4 + T cells. Depletion of CD 25 + Treg cells resulted in elevated frequencies of tumor-reactive CD 8 and CD 4 + T cells and increased CD 8 -to-Treg cell ratios inside tumor masses. All mice given <b>presensitized</b> CD 25 -depleted T cells survived a tumor rechallenge, indicating the development of long-term CD 8 + T-cell memory to tumor antigens. These observations should aid in the future design of immunotherapeutic approaches that promote the generation of both acute and long-term antitumor immunity...|$|E
40|$|The streptococcal group A and E {{cell wall}} {{polysaccharide}} (PS) antigens were esterified under identical conditions with four fatty acid chlorides (lauroyl, myristoyl, palmitoyl, and stearoyl), varying from 12 to 18 carbon atoms. With group A PS, {{it was shown}} that the four resulting esters varied {{in their ability to}} sensitize red blood cells (RBC) to agglutination in the presence of specific antiserum. The most active was palmitoyl (16 C) followed by myristoyl (14 C). The least active was the lauroyl ester (12 C). One-tenth as much palmitoyl ester was required as stearoyl group A PS ester. Such variation in the ability to sensitize RBC was not demonstrated with the group E esters, {{with the exception of the}} lauroyl ester which was the least active. Removal of N-acetylglucosamine from the esterified and the nonesterified group A PS by enzyme action resulted in a significant loss of serological activity of both antigens. No appreciable difference in the rate or total loss of activity was found in either case. It was demonstrated that both tritium-labeled stearic and palmitic acids and their respective PS esters were adsorbed in significant amounts to RBC. The results indicate that the esterified antigens were adsorbed to the RBC because of the presence of the fatty acid in the PS ester. Attempts to block the receptor sites on the red cell by <b>presensitizing</b> the cells with fatty acid were negative. Likewise, the adsorbed ester did not prevent the uptake of fatty acid at the levels tested. Tritium-labeled esterified group A PS and group E PS were used to show that the amount of antigen required to produce maximal agglutination was the same when cells from the same individual were used, whereas this was not the case when cells from different individuals were used. The amount of antigen required to produce maximal agglutination varied from one batch of sheep RBC to another. Once the optimal concentration of antigen was reached, any additional adsorption did not increase the titer of agglutination...|$|R

40|$|Antigenic {{competition}} between bovine gamma globulin (BGG) and endotoxin from a smooth strain (S-ET) and a rough (R-ET) heptoseless mutant strain of Salmonella minnesota was studied in mice. Both endotoxins acted as adjuvants for enhancing the antibody response to BGG. However, other work {{showed that the}} R-ET had minimal antigenicity, and it {{was used as a}} control for the competition studies. Antigenic {{competition between}} BGG and endotoxin as expressed by a suppression of the antibody response to BGG could not be demonstrated when varying adjuvant doses of S-ET or R-ET were injected simultaneously with a small constant dose of BGG into normal mice. However, mice <b>presensitized</b> with S-ET several weeks before immunization with the S-ET and BGG combination produced anti-BGG levels which were four to eightfold lower than in normal mice. Nearly complete suppression of the anti-BGG response could be obtained in <b>presensitized</b> mice by reducing the BGG dose 10 -fold or by increasing the adjuvant dose of endotoxin. Mice pretreated with R-ET and challenged with BGG plus S-ET or R-ET showed no depression of the anti-BGG response.

40|$|Group A streptococcal {{pyrogenic}} exotoxin (SPE) types A, B, and C induced lymphocyte proliferation both specifically and nonspecifically, and {{the responses}} showed characteristics associated with {{both types of}} stimulation. Guinea pig lymphocytes from animals <b>presensitized</b> to SPE A displayed immunologically specific proliferation in response to SPE A; control lymphocytes showed little activity {{in the presence of}} SPE A. Lymphocytes from guinea pigs not <b>presensitized</b> to SPE responded nonspecifically to SPE types B and C. Guinea pig lymphocytes from SPE A-presensitized animals showed enhanced proliferation over controls when treated with SPE B, suggesting that a degree of cross-reactivity between SPE types may exist, though they are serologically distinct. Mouse splenic lymphocytes exhibited low-level responsiveness to all SPE types, as would be expected for an antigen-specific proliferative response. Unlike mouse splenic lymphocytes, rabbit spleen cells and human cord blood, lymphocytes responded nonspecifically to all SPE types. Although rabbit spleen cells and human cord blood lymphocytes responded nonspecifically, the maximum response occurred at day 4 or 5, comparable to an antigen-specific system rather than a day 2 or 3 such as that with the nonspecific thymus-derived cell mitogen, concanavalin A...|$|E
40|$|To {{evaluate}} a long peptide-based allergy vaccine in a murine model, CBA/J mice were sensitized with low dose alum-adsorbed phospholipase A 2 (PLA 2), a major bee venom allergen. <b>Presensitized</b> mice were treated by daily i. p. injections of {{a mixture of}} three long overlapping peptides (44 - to 60 -mer) spanning the entire PLA 2 molecule (100 microg/peptide) for 6 consecutive days. This therapeutic approach induced {{a sharp drop in}} PLA 2 -specific IgE, an increase in specific IgG 2 a, and a marked T cell hyporesponsiveness. T cell cytokine secretion was characterized by a shift from a Th 2 to a Th 1 profile. Prophylactic treatment of naive mice with long peptides prior to sensitization with PLA 2 induced a comparable modulation of B and T cell responses. Upon i. p. challenge with native PLA 2, <b>presensitized</b> mice treated with the long peptide mixture were fully protected from anaphylaxis.

We investigated the changes in morphology, cell populations, and major histocompatibility complex antigen distribution in the rat aortic valve allograft. Methods. Fresh heart valves from Lewis rats were transplanted into the abdominal aorta of DA rats. Valves from allografted, isografted, and <b>presensitized</b> recipient rats were examined serially with standard morphologic and immunohistochemical techniques. Results. In comparison with isografts, the allografts were infiltrated and thickened by increased numbers of CD 4 (+) and CD 8 (+) lymphocytes, macrophages, and fibroblasts. Thickening of the valve wall and leaflet and the density of the cellular infiltrate was particularly evident after presensitization. Endothelial cells were frequently absent in <b>presensitized</b> allografts whereas isografts had intact endothelium. Cellular major histocompatibility complex class I and II antigens in the allograft were substantially increased. A long-term allograft showed dense fibrosis and disruption of the media with scattered persisting donor cells. Conclusions. The changes in these aortic valve allograft experiments are consistent with an allograft immune response and confirm that the response can damage aortic valve allograft tissue.

40|$|As part of {{the effort}} by the Nevada Nuclear Waste Storage Investigations (NNWSI) Project to {{evaluate}} the volcanic tuff beds of Yucca Mountain, Nevada, as a repository for the permanent storage of high-level nuclear waste, the interaction of actinide-doped Savannah River Laboratory (SRL) 165 type glass with the unsaturated repository environment has been studied. The NNWSI Unsaturated Test method has been used, and the results from batch and continuous tests completed through 18 months demonstrate that several interactions are important for controlling both the reaction of the glass and the release of radionuclides. These interactions include (1) the reaction between the glass and moist air with interludes of liquid water contact, which results in the release of alkali metals from the glass; and (2) the reaction between standing water, glass, and <b>presensitized</b> 304 L type stainless steel which results in breakdown of the glass matrix and the release of radionuclides from the glass-metal assemblage.

40|$|Because of the {{association}} of the group A streptococcal pyrogenic exotoxins (SPEs) with erythrogenic toxin used in the classical Dick test, the involvement of the SPEs in production of erythematous skin reactions was assessed. Unless they had been <b>presensitized,</b> young adult rabbits failed to show skin reactions after intracutaneous challenged with SPEs. Rabbits <b>presensitized</b> to purified protein derivative exhibited enhanced skin reactivity when given purified protein derivative plus SPE C; the enhancement was neutralized by antiserum to SPE C. Rabbits sensitized to bovine serum albumin showed extensive red rash development resembling scarlet fever rashes when given bovine serum albumin containing SPE C. Desquamation occurred 5 to 10 days after injection. Animals sensitized to one SPE type showed enhanced skin reactivity to challenge with homologous or heterologous SPE types, indicating the presence of a cross-reactive determinant within the SPE molecules. Repeated challenge of SPE-sensitized animals with homologous toxin resulted in concomitant antitoxin production with reduction of the enhanced skin reactivities, until typical delayed-hypersensitivity skin reactions remained. The data indicate that, in addition to the toxic reaction previously described, SPEs enhance Arthus and delayed-hypersensitivity skin reactions. It follows that erythrogenic toxin represents the enhancement of acquired skin reactivity to streptococcal antigens by one or more SPE types. Therefore, the Dick test measures SPE-enhanced hypersensitivity to streptococcal products...|$|E

40|$|Acute {{antibody-mediated}} rejection is an unsolved {{issue in}} transplantation, {{especially in the}} context of pretransplant immunization. The deleterious effect of preformed cytotoxic anti-HLA antibodies through complement activation is well proven, but very little is known concerning complement blockade to prevent/cure this rejection. Here, we used a baboon model of preimmunization to explore the prevention of acute antibody-mediated rejection by an early inhibition of the classical complement pathway using human recombinant C 1 -inhibitor. Baboons were immunized against peripheral blood mononuclear cells from allogeneic donors and, once a specific and stable immunization had been established, they received a kidney from the same donor. Rejection occurred at day 2 posttransplant in untreated <b>presensitized</b> recipients, with characteristic histological lesions and complement deposition. As recombinant human C 1 -inhibitor blocks in vitro cytotoxicity induced by donor-specific antibodies, other alloimmunized baboons received the drug thrice daily intravenously during the first 5 days after transplant. Rejection was prevented during this treatment but occurred after discontinuation of treatment. We show here that early blockade of complement activation by recombinant human C 1 -inhibitor can prevent acute antibody-mediated rejection in <b>presensitized</b> recipients.

40|$|Abstract Background Approaches {{that enhance}} {{radiation}} effect {{may lead to}} improved clinical outcome and decrease toxicity. Here we investigated whether activated CD 4 + T cells (aCD 4) can serve as an effective radiosensitizer. Methods CD 4 + T cells were activated with anti-CD 3 and anti-CD 28 mAbs. Hela cells were <b>presensitized</b> with aCD 4 or conditioned supernatant (aCD 4 S) or recombinant cytokines for 2 days, followed γ-irradiation. The treated cells were cultured for an additional 2 to 5 days for cell proliferation, cell cycle, and western blot assays. For confirmation, other cancer cell lines were also used. Results Presensitization of tumor cells with aCD 4 greatly increased tumor cell growth inhibition. Soluble factors secreted from activated CD 4 + T cells were primarily responsible for the observed effect. IFN-γ seemed {{to play a major}} role. TNF-α, though inactive by itself, significantly augmented the radiosensitizing activity of IFN-γ. aCD 4 S, but not IFN-γ or IFN-γ/TNF-α combination, was found to enhance the γ-irradiation-induced G 2 /M phase arrest. Bax expression was highly upregulated in Hela cells <b>presensitized</b> with aCD 4 S followed by γ-irradiation. The radio-sensitizing activity of aCD 4 is not uniquely observed with Hela cell line, but also seen with other cancer cell lines of various histology.

At 20 hr after DNFB application, some blast cells [...] on morphological grounds belonging to the veiled cell series [...] could be observed in the lymph of <b>presensitized</b> animals. But the most predominant finding in these pigs was that, approximately 30 hr after painting, the total cell output began to increase, reaching 10 times the normal level at 70 hr.

Here the most striking alterations were seen in the veiled cells. Some of these cells were moving ponderously about, apparently in pursuit of other lymph-borne cells, and this activity resulted in the formation of large cellular aggregates. Since it is known that veiled cells are involved in antigen handling, this behaviour probably facilitates the induction of the T-cell immune response. By contrast, the veiled cells from <b>presensitized</b> animals behaved in a more normal manner and the proportion found in aggregates was only briefly increased. In these animals lymphocytes were seen to interact with veiled cells in a manner reminiscent of peripolesis, apparently recognizing antigenic signals {{on the surface of the}} veiled cells.

(2) Allografts transplanted into nonsensitized hosts initially appeared similar as isografts, but activated T lymphocytes at the transplantation site preceded loss of active bone cells within the graft and development of fibrosis within the marrow cavity. (3) In allografts transplanted into <b>presensitized</b> recipients, severe deterioration of the graft was observed with very few active bone cells, accompanied by an invasion of T lymphocytes and fibrosis in the marrow cavity already in early stages.

MC were <b>presensitized</b> with IgE anti-dinitrophenyl-human serum albumin (anti-DNP-HSA), activated with the relevant antigen (DNP-HSA) (69. 4 % histamine release) and incubated for 7 days in medium alone or medium containing the antigen with or without Ca 2 + ions. During the prolonged incubation MC released only small amounts of histamine (20 - 26 ng/plate/day) under all the different culture conditions. Moreover, these MC were not activated after each medium replacement with fresh antigen. When activated MC cultured in medium containing antigen and Ca 2 + were <b>presensitized</b> prior to a second challenge performed on days 1, 2, 5 and 7, they released 35 - 45 % histamine but were still partially desensitized compared to initially challenged MC. Immunofluorescence studies demonstrated that the MC unresponsiveness to a second challenge could be partially attributed to lack of membrane-associated IgE antibodies. Repetitive activation (four times) of MC at daily intervals did not abrogate their releasing capacity although the intracellular histamine content was diminished. When repetitive activation was performed 2 and 4 hr after the first challenge, a more intense MC refractoriness was observed (release of 17. 3 % and 21. 1 % histamine respectively versus 67. 7 %). It is suggested that MC activation occurs even after continuous exposure to antigen and that MC can respond to repetitive immunological stimulation...|$|E
40|$|Mycobacterial {{ribonucleic acid}} (RNA) and cell wall {{skeleton}} fraction isolated from H 37 Ra caused P- 815 mastocytoma regression in DBA/ 2 mice provided {{the animals were}} <b>presensitized</b> with freshly harvested living H 37 Ra cells. In the absence of presensitization, only the RNA fraction inhibited. Cell wall skeleton fraction, under these conditions, stimulated tumor growth. Cell wall lipids (from H 37 Ra) added to H 37 Ra cell wall skeleton fraction did not increase the inhibitory activity of cell wall skeleton fraction alone. Mycobacterial RNA {{appeared to be an}} effective inhibitor of P- 815 mastocytoma metastases as shown by (i) the inhibition of a second footpad lesion distant from the one treated and (ii) increase in survival time...|$|E
40|$|The role of Propionibacterium acnes (P. acnes) {{isolated}} {{from a high}} percentage of patients with sarcoidosis by Dr. Honnma, as a cause of sarcoidosis was examined. Interleukin- 2 (IL- 2) production and the responsiveness to IL- 2 of alveolar lymphocytes stimulated by P. acnes were examined in vitro in a guinea pig model. The animals were divided into 4 groups, normal guinea pigs (group 1), guinea pigs intracutaneously <b>presensitized</b> with P. acnes and intratracheally challenged by saline (group 2), guinea pigs <b>presensitized</b> as above and intratracheally challenged with P. acnes (group 3), and guinea pigs <b>presensitized</b> as above and intratracheally challenged by P. acnes-pyridine extract residue (P. acnes-PER) (group 4). The production of IL- 2 by alveolar lymphocytes stimulated by P. acnes-PER for 48 hours was determined using the method described by Gillis et al. The responsiveness of alveoloar lymphocytes to IL- 2 was evaluated by 3 H-TdR uptake in the presence and absence of P. acnes-PER. The amount of IL- 2 produced by alveolar lymphocytes was 0. 6 ± 1. 1, 0. 7 ± 1. 1, 21. 2 ± 27. 9 and 329. 4 ± 294. 1 u/ml (M±SD), respectively, in groups 1, 2, 3 and 4. The value of IL- 2 production in groups 3 and 4, the intratracheally challenged groups, was significantly higher htna that in groups 1 and 2, the control groups (p< 0. 02, p< 0. 01). By contrast, the IL- 2 production of peripheral lymphocytes in groups 1, 2, 3 and 4 was 0, 7. 4 ± 10. 3, 8. 6 ± 15. 7 and 9. 3 ± 8. 9 u/ml, respectively. The amount of IL- 2 produced was about one-tenth thar of alveolar lymphocytes. In the intratracheally challenged groups, the responsiveness to IL- 2 of alveolar lymphocytes in the presence and absence of P. acnes-PER was 12, 514 ± 12, 766 and 6, 611 ± 7, 066 for group 3, and 12, 362 ± 9, 414 and 5, 818 ± 5, 494 dpm, respectively, for group 4. The responsiveness to IL- 2 of alveolar lymphoctyes in group 4 was signifincantly increased by stimulation with P. acnes-PER (p< 0. 05), but that in groups 1 and 2, control groups, was not different. Our findings indicate that P. acnes-PER stimulated IL- 2 production from alveolar lymphocytes and induced a functionally active state of alveolar lymphocytes to IL- 2 in this guinea pig model. In conclusion, the role of alveolar lymphocytes in an animal model stimulated by P. acnes appears to be consistent with that obtained on the sarcoidosis patients we previously reported...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: We have {{previously}} demonstrated {{that in a}} concordant hamster-to-nude rat cardiac transplant model, T-independent specific B-lymphocyte and natural killer (NK) -cell tolerance could be induced, leading to long-term xenograft (Xg) survival. Here, we investigated whether {{the same could be}} achieved in a clinically more relevant semi-discordant model involving hamster hearts transplanted into pre-sensitized, nude rats. METHODS: Sensitized, nude rats with high titers of anti-hamster immunoglobulin (Ig) M xenoantibodies (XAbs) were prepared by transplanting a first hamster heart without treatment. One week after rejection, a complete tolerizing regimen was given, including the following: a) an i. v. injection of hamster heart antigens; b) a 4 -week administration of malononitriloamide; and c) a single injection of an anti-NK antiserum. Two weeks later, a second hamster heart was grafted. The isotype and level of XAb were examined by fluorescence-activated cell sorting. NK cytotoxicity was evaluated by a standard 4 -hr 51 Cr release assay. Hamster heart Xgs were examined by conventional histologic and immunohistochemical analysis. RESULTS: Untreated, <b>presensitized,</b> nude rats developing high titers of IgM XAb underwent hyperacute rejection within 4 hr (n= 4) after transplantation of the second hamster heart. Immunohistochemical analysis showed intensive staining for IgM and C 3 along the vascular endothelia in the rejected Xgs. In contrast, <b>presensitized,</b> nude rats receiving the complete tolerizing regimen had a rapid decrease in anti-hamster IgM XAb. The second hamster hearts were not rejected and showed long-term survival even after withdrawal of malononitriloamide (n= 6). Moreover, tolerant rats showed specific B-lymphocyte tolerance and a specific continuous absence of anti-hamster NK-cell reactivity. CONCLUSION: T-independent B-lymphocyte and NK-cell xenotolerance can also be achieved in recipients with pre-existing IgM XAb. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|AbstractLong-term {{display of}} {{exogenous}} proteins {{on the cell}} surface may have important research and therapeutic implications. We report a novel method for the cell-surface display of proteins that involves generation of a chimeric protein with core streptavidin, biotinylation of cells, and “decoration” with the protein. A chimeric protein with the extracellular portions of FasL (SA-FasL) was efficiently displayed on the cell surface within 2 hr without detectable cellular toxicity. Biotin and SA-FasL persisted on the cell surface for weeks in vitro and in vivo. Immunomodulation with SA-FasL-decorated splenocytes effectively blocked alloreactive responses in naive and <b>presensitized</b> rodents and prevented the rejection of allogeneic pancreatic islets. This approach may serve {{as an alternative to}} gene transfer-based expression with broad research and therapeutic applications...|$|E
