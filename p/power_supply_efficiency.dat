40|$|A bipolar <b>power</b> <b>supply,</b> which {{meets the}} {{internal}} specifications of originally correction <b>power</b> <b>supplies,</b> {{is designed to}} increase its efficiency. The power source of this <b>power</b> <b>supply</b> is designed that the working voltage mode on a dc bus is adjustable. Such voltage adjustment is conducted {{according to the state}} of current output and load. A new power switching device, which utilizes power MOSFET, giving much higher working frequency than former 60 Hz, is used as an energy converting mode system of the switching <b>power</b> <b>supply.</b> This allows an increase of the correction <b>power</b> <b>supply’s</b> <b>efficiency,</b> and significant decrease of its weight. This new designed switching <b>power</b> <b>supply</b> provides a set of bipolar current sources, and following the working voltage, it can be automatically regulated with feedback by programmable setting.

50|$|For a given <b>power</b> <b>supply,</b> <b>efficiency</b> varies {{depending}} on how much power is being delivered. Supplies are typically most efficient at between half and three quarters load, much less efficient at low load, and somewhat less efficient at maximum load. Older ATX power supplies were typically 60% to 75% efficient. To qualify for 80 Plus, a power supply must achieve at least 80% efficiency at three specified loads (20%, 50% and 100% of maximum rated power). However, 80 Plus supplies may still be less than 80% efficient at lower loads. For instance, an 80 Plus, 520 watt supply could still be 70% or less efficient at 60 watts (a typical idle power for a desktop computer). Thus it is still important to select a supply with capacity appropriate to the device being powered.|$|E

50|$|The {{efficiency}} {{of a computer}} <b>power</b> <b>supply</b> is its output power divided by its input power; the remaining input power is converted into heat. For instance, a 600-watt <b>power</b> <b>supply</b> with 60% <b>efficiency</b> running at full load would draw 1000 W from the mains and would therefore waste 400 W as heat. On the other hand, a 600-watt <b>power</b> <b>supply</b> with 80% <b>efficiency</b> running at full load would draw 750 W from the mains and would therefore waste only 150 W as heat.|$|R

40|$|Overhead {{high voltage}} power line (HVPL) online {{monitoring}} equipment is playing an increasingly important role in smart grids, but the power supply is an obstacle to such systems’ stable and safe operation, so in this work a hybrid wireless power supply system, integrated with inductive energy harvesting and wireless power transmitting, is proposed. The energy harvesting device extracts energy from the HVPL and transfers that from the power line to monitoring equipment on transmission towers by transmitting and receiving coils, which are in a magnetically coupled resonant configuration. In this paper, the optimization design of online energy harvesting devices is analyzed emphatically by taking both HVPL insulation distance and wireless <b>power</b> <b>supply</b> <b>efficiency</b> into account.

40|$|Hybrid {{propulsion}} systems {{allow for a}} reduction of fuel consumption and pollutant emissions of future off-highway applications. A challenging aspect of a hybridization is the larger number of system components that further increases both the complexity and the diversification of such systems. Hence, beside a standardization on the hardware side for off-highway systems, a high flexibility and modularity of the control schemes is required to employ them in as many different applications as possible. In this paper, a causal optimization-based power management algorithm is introduced to control the power split between engine and electric machine in a hybrid powertrain.

30|$|When {{large amount}} of {{renewable}} energy is connected to a traditional power grid, it becomes increasingly difficult for the grid to handle problems such as grid stability. Therefore, {{it is necessary to}} upgrade the traditional technologies. DC power systems have recently attracted significant attentions owing to their advantages such as high flexibility, controllability of power and improving power angle stability [1]. In city distribution networks, DC loads such as electric cars and lighting systems are developing and expanding rapidly. In view of this, the construction of DC distribution networks can not only reduce the number of power conversion links but also improve the <b>power</b> <b>supply</b> <b>efficiency.</b> In general, voltage-source converters (VSC) can have the two-level, three-level, or modular multilevel converter (MMC) topologies. The modulation principles of the two-level and three-level converters are the same, whereas two-level converters with the advantages of mature technology, simple control, and a low cost, have greater application prospects than MMC in distribution networks. Faults occurred in a DC line within a VSC based multi-terminal DC distribution network will have wider influences on the whole system than in a two-terminal DC transmission system. Therefore, to maintain safe operation, it is of great importance to study the fault-selection and fault-type recognition methods for DC lines to detect and remove the fault quickly.|$|E
