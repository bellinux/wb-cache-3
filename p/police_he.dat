5|$|The {{events in}} Winnipeg {{highlighted}} the chaotic and ill-coordinated management of security issues across Canada, the artificial division between policing organisations {{in the west}} and east of the country, and the absence of a single senior leader for security work.

5|$|Don't Look Now is {{particularly}} indebted to Alfred Hitchcock, exhibiting several {{characteristics of the}} director's work. The aural match cut following Christine's death from Laura's scream to the screech of a drill references a cut in The 39 Steps, when a woman's scream cuts to the whistle of a steam train. When John reports Laura's disappearance to the Italian <b>police</b> <b>he</b> inadvertently becomes {{a suspect in the}} murder case they are investigating—an innocent man being wrongly accused and pursued by the authorities is a common Hitchcock trait. The film also takes a Hitchcockian approach to its mise en scène, by manifesting its protagonist's psychology in plot developments: in taking their trip to Venice the Baxters have run away from personal tragedy, and are often physically depicted as running to and from things during their stay in Venice; the labyrinthine geography of Venice causes John to lose his bearings, and he often becomes separated from Laura and is repeatedly shown to be looking for her—both physical realisations {{of what is going on}} in his head.|$|E

5|$|Meanwhile, a mysteriously ill Jordan {{continues}} {{to ask about}} Helen's whereabouts, and her remarks about Helen's conditions lead Black to believe she is starting to experience the seemingly-psychic visions {{he is capable of}} seeing, which allow him to see the evil people are capable of. Elsewhere, Green is arrested. His property is searched but Helen is nowhere to be found—although another corpse is dug up in the garden, evidently killed nine years before. Black deduces that Green could not have killed Helen at the cabin as his house was already being watched by the <b>police.</b> <b>He</b> sees a set of tools in Green's home which he realizes were not used for murder or torture, but to immure Helen in the basement. Black and the police dismantle a newly finished plaster wall, finding Helen injured but alive; it is at this point that Black realizes Green was simply a pawn, used by his father to lure victims to the house.|$|E
