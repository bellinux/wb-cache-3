5|$|A recent test of {{this model}} {{involved}} a reciprocal transplants of seedlings of 20 species of trees between clay soils (nutrient rich) and white sand (nutrient <b>poor)</b> <b>to</b> determine whether trade-offs between growth rate and defenses restrict species to one habitat. When planted in white sand and protected from herbivores, seedlings originating from clay outgrew those originating from the nutrient-poor sand, but {{in the presence of}} herbivores the seedlings originating from white sand performed better, likely due to their higher levels of constitutive carbon-based defenses. These finding suggest that defensive strategies limit the habitats of some plants.|$|E

5|$|After Cimon's ostracism, Pericles {{continued}} {{to promote a}} populist social policy. He first proposed a decree that permitted the <b>poor</b> <b>to</b> watch theatrical plays without paying, with the state covering {{the cost of their}} admission. With other decrees he lowered the property requirement for the archonship in 458–457 BC and bestowed generous wages on all citizens who served as jurymen in the Heliaia (the supreme court of Athens) some time just after 454BC. His most controversial measure, however, was a law of 451 BC limiting Athenian citizenship to those of Athenian parentage on both sides.|$|E

Using her weekly radio show, she delivered powerful speeches with heavy populist rhetoric urging the <b>poor</b> <b>to</b> align themselves with Perón's movement. Though she had become wealthy from her radio and modeling success, she highlighted her own humble upbringing as a way of showing solidarity with the impoverished classes.|$|E

5|$|Before the Revolution, New Englanders {{consumed}} {{large quantities}} of rum and beer as maritime trade provided relatively {{easy access to the}} goods needed to produce these items. Rum was the distilled spirit of choice as molasses, the main ingredient, was readily available from trade with the West Indies. In the continent's interior, colonists drank whiskey, as they had ready access to corn and rye but did not have good access to sugar cane. However, up until the Revolution, many colonists considered whiskey to be a coarse beverage unfit for human consumption, believing that it caused the <b>poor</b> <b>to</b> become raucous and disorderly.|$|E
5|$|By 1849, {{many of the}} Latter-day Saints who {{remained}} in Iowa or Missouri were poor and unable to afford {{the costs of the}} wagon, teams of oxen, and supplies that would be required for the trip. Therefore, the LDS Church established a revolving fund, known as the Perpetual Emigration Fund, to enable the <b>poor</b> <b>to</b> emigrate. By 1852, most of the Latter-day Saints from Nauvoo who wished to emigrate had done so, and the church abandoned its settlements in Iowa. However, many church members from the eastern states and from Europe continued to emigrate to Utah, often assisted by the Perpetual Emigration Fund.|$|E
5|$|During the 2nd centuryBC, Roman {{territory}} saw {{an overall}} decline in population, partially {{due to the}} huge losses incurred during various wars. This was accompanied by severe social stresses and the greater collapse of the middle classes into lower classes of the census and the proletarii. As a result, both the Roman society and its military became increasingly proletarianised. The Roman state was forced to arm its soldiers {{at the expense of}} the state, since many of the soldiers who made up its lower classes were now impoverished proletarii in all but name, and were too <b>poor</b> <b>to</b> afford their own equipment.|$|E

5|$|Gandhi {{expanded}} his nonviolent non-co-operation platform {{to include the}} swadeshi policy—the boycott of foreign-made goods, especially British goods. Linked to this was his advocacy that khadi (homespun cloth) be worn by all Indians instead of British-made textiles. Gandhi exhorted Indian men and women, rich or <b>poor,</b> <b>to</b> spend time each day spinning khadi {{in support of the}} independence movement. In addition to boycotting British products, Gandhi urged the people to boycott British institutions and law courts, to resign from government employment, and to forsake British titles and honours. Gandhi thus began his journey aimed at crippling the British India government economically, politically and administratively.|$|E

He stressed that he has observed that Grameen's borrowers attain a sense of confidence and self-sufficiency when they pay back their loans from Grameen bank. While being careful not to criticise charity's rightful place, he added that the recipient of a charitable gift does not experience these long-term emotional benefits in the same way.|$|E

After overcoming the momentary strangeness of being back in his old post after nearly thirty years he preached with vigour until cataracts made his eyesight too <b>poor</b> <b>to</b> continue. He retired from the Abbey in 1941.|$|E
5|$|After a {{rejection}} of his poems by an eastern periodical, Riley began to formulate a plot to prove his work was of good quality {{and that it was}} being rejected only because his name was unknown in the east. Riley authored a poem imitating the style of Edgar Allan Poe and submitted it to the Kokomo Dispatch under a fictitious name claiming it was a long lost Poe poem. The Dispatch published the poem and reported it as such. Riley and two other men who were part of the plot waited two weeks for the poem to be published by major newspapers in Chicago, Boston, and New York to gauge their reaction; they were disappointed. While a few newspapers believed the poem to be authentic, the majority did not, claiming the quality was too <b>poor</b> <b>to</b> be authored by Poe. An employee of the Dispatch learned the truth of the incident and reported it to the Kokomo Tribune, which published an expose that outed Riley as a conspirator behind the hoax. The revelation damaged the credibility of the Dispatch and harmed Riley's reputation.|$|E
