30|$|It is {{striking}} that graduates from narrow education programmes have a significantly smaller chance of obtaining a job within the programme’s occupational domain and a (weakly) significant smaller chance of obtaining {{a job at}} the <b>programme’s</b> <b>level.</b> Both findings appear to be related. Taking into account whether respondents work within their domain this appears to {{have a positive effect on}} the chance of obtaining {{a job at the}} <b>programme’s</b> <b>level.</b> Since the chances of working in one’s occupational domain are lower for graduates from narrow education programmes, a negative effect on their chances of obtaining a job at the <b>level</b> of the <b>programme</b> results. This conclusion holds despite the insignificant negative direct effect of a narrow education on the job level in this case.|$|R

50|$|In {{the late}} 1930s PPMs were {{considered}} {{for use in}} the US, but rejected in favour of a 'Standard Volume Indicator' (VU meter) on grounds of cost. Joint research by CBS, NBC and Bell Labs found that using an experimental design of PPM (with a relatively long integration time of 25 ms) in the control of <b>programme</b> <b>levels</b> gave only a 1 dB advantage over the VU meter, in terms of average output level for a given amount of distortion. It was felt that this was too small to justify the much greater expense. It was also found that VU meters gave more consistent readings than PPMs when comparing <b>programme</b> <b>levels</b> at the sending and receiving end of long lines subject to group delay, which altered the waveform. This finding has been disputed by others.|$|R

50|$|Post Exposure Prophylaxis At the {{individual}} patient level, post exposure prophylaxis (PEP) consists of i) local {{treatment of the}} wound, ii) vaccination, and iii) administration of immunoglobulin (if indicated) 3. At the <b>programme</b> <b>level,</b> several components are critical to this capacity: i) adequate and prompt recognition of the need of PEP by the public, if exposed, and by health officials, ii) prompt and sufficient availability of PEP of quality, and iii) adequate follow-up of PEP use. Awareness by health officials of the need of PEP after a dog bite can only be achieved via timely and spatially relevant communication efforts about the epidemiological situation of rabies.|$|E
30|$|In {{addition}} to the dummy variable that indicates whether an education programme is narrow or broad, a number of control variables {{are used in the}} estimated regression analyses. To suppress a potential selectivity problem, we include all relevant controls available in the data set, including variables that proxy for the ability and motivation of the respondents. These proxy variables are the final grade, completion of a beta programme (technology, agriculture, health care), successful completion of further education, and the discontinuation of further education. Further controls are gender, age, age squared, non-Western and Western immigrant status, the year of the survey, working part-time, working in the programme’s occupational domain, and working at the <b>programme’s</b> <b>level.</b> Working in the programme’s domain and working at the <b>programme’s</b> <b>level</b> are included as controls in specified cases only. The other control variables recur in every analysis. For obvious reasons, the controls that characterize jobs do not {{play a role in the}} unemployment and duration of search analyses.|$|R

50|$|The noise {{introduced}} by quantization error, including rounding errors {{and loss of}} precision introduced during audio processing, can be mitigated by adding {{a small amount of}} random noise, called dither, to the signal before quantizing. Dithering eliminates the granularity of quantization error, giving very low distortion, but at the expense of a slightly raised noise floor. Measured using ITU-R 468 noise weighting, this is about 66 dB below alignment level, or 84 dB below digital full scale, which is somewhat lower than the microphone noise level on most recordings, and hence of no consequence in 16-bit audio (see <b>programme</b> <b>level</b> for more on this).|$|E

The UAE government has implemented {{a wide range of}} services to Emirati nationals in the US, often in the form of financial support and funding. It is estimated that there is a very small diaspora, mainly because the UAE provides them with more than adequate welfare benefits, removing the need to live and work in other developed countries. Some long-settled Emiratis in the US have acquired American citizenship over the years.|$|E
5000|$|In 1919, the Coalition {{government}} of David Lloyd George {{appeared to be}} in a position of overwhelming strength and public support. Lloyd George’s personal reputation was known to be as the [...] "man who won the war". Yet the government faced serious problems notably in the economy and with industrial unrest. More problematic was the stability of the Coalition as a governing platform. Lloyd George was aware that a purely personal ascendancy was unlikely to be enough for turning the Coalition into a long term political force. The only ways in which the wartime spirit of national unity could be perpetuated was by appealing to the ‘higher unity’ of coalition, with the creation of a single ‘fused’ party to reflect the ‘fusion’ taking place at parliamentary and <b>programme</b> <b>level.</b> Between July 1919 and March 1920 Lloyd George and his associates worked hard to bring the fusion project to fruition. Winston Churchill set the tone on 15 July with a speech to the New Members’ Group at the Criterion Restaurant in London.|$|E
50|$|The EBU PPM is {{a variant}} of the British PPM {{designed}} for the control of <b>programme</b> <b>levels</b> in international <b>programme</b> exchange. It is formalised as the Type IIb PPM in IEC 60268-10. It is identical to the British PPM except for the scale plate, which is calibrated in dB relative to Alignment Level, which is marked 'TEST'. There are also ticks at 2 dB intervals and at +9 dB, corresponding to Permitted Maximum Level.|$|R
30|$|Our main {{findings}} indicate that graduates from narrow education programmes have a less favourable labour market position than graduates from broad programmes. They have a greater chance of being unemployed and are more often forced to resort to jobs outside their programme’s occupational domain and below the education <b>programme’s</b> <b>level.</b> They also earn less, particularly if their job is outside their domain and below their level. They consequently experience worse career opportunities {{and many of them}} are more dissatisfied with their jobs.|$|R
30|$|We {{conclude}} {{from these}} results that graduates from narrow education programmes have an unfavourable labour market position. There is insufficient demand for these graduates, {{which makes it}} more difficult to find a job in their specific occupational domain and at the <b>programme’s</b> <b>level.</b> Because of the limited options of resorting to other occupational domains, it takes longer for them to find a job and they lose jobs more easily. This weaker labour market position results in lower wages than those of graduates from broad programmes.|$|R
50|$|Distortion {{measurements}} on loudspeakers {{can only go}} as low as the distortion of the measurement microphone itself of course, at the level tested. The microphone should ideally have a clipping level of 120 to 140 dB SPL if high-level distortion is to be measured. A typical top-end speaker, driven by a typical 100watt power amplifier, cannot produce peak levels much above 105 dB SPL at 1 m (which translates roughly to 105 dB at listening position {{from a pair of}} speakers in a typical listening room). Achieving truly realistic reproduction requires speakers capable of much higher levels than this, ideally around 130 dB SPL. Even though the level of live music measured on a (slow responding and rms reading) sound level meter might be in the region of 100 dB SPL, <b>programme</b> <b>level</b> peaks on percussion will far exceed this. Most speakers give around 3% distortion measured 468-weighted 'distortion residue' reducing slightly at low levels. Electrostatic speakers can have lower harmonic distortion, but suffer higher intermodulation distortion. 3% distortion residue corresponds to 1 or 2% Total harmonic distortion. Professional monitors may maintain modest distortion up to around 110 dB SPL at 1 m, but almost all domestic speaker systems distort badly above 100 dB SPL.|$|E

50|$|In {{audio quality}} measurement, {{quasi-peak}} rectifiers are specified in several standards. For example ITU-R 468 noise weighting uses a special rectifier incorporating two cascaded charging time constants. The PPM or peak programme meter {{used to measure}} <b>programme</b> <b>levels</b> is actually a quasi-peak reading meter, again with precisely defined dynamics. Flutter measurement also involves a standardised quasi-peak reading meter. In every case the dynamics are chosen to reflect the sensitivity of human hearing to brief sounds, ignoring those so brief {{that we do not}} perceive them, and weighting those of intermediate duration according to audibility.|$|R
40|$|There are {{a number}} of impulses towards public {{participation}} in health care decision making including instrumentalist, communitarian, educative and expressive impulses and the desire for increased accountability. There has, however, been little research looking systematically at the public’s preferences for being involved in particular types of rationing decisions, nor indeed, has there been a critical examination of the degree of involvement desired by the public. The research reported here uses findings from focus groups and in-depth interviews to explore these questions. Eight focus groups were conducted with a total of 57 informants, four amongst randomly selected members of the public and four with informants from health and non-health related organisations. Nineteen interviews were conducted to allow the elaboration of focus group comments, to probe views more deeply and to pursue emerging themes. The findings show variations in the willingness of members of the public to be involved in health care decisions and consistency across the different forms of the public as represented by the focus groups with randomly selected citizens and pre-existing organisations. There was a strong desire in all the groups for the public to be involved both at the system and <b>programme</b> <b>levels,</b> with much less willingness to be involved at the individual level. At the system and <b>programme</b> <b>levels</b> informants generally favoured consultation, without responsibility for decisions, but with th...|$|R
