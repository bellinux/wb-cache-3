25|$|Borges imagines a Tlönite {{working his}} way out of the problem of solipsism by {{reasoning}} that if all <b>people</b> <b>are</b> <b>actually</b> aspects of one being, then perhaps the universe is consistent because that one being is consistent in his imagining. This is, effectively, a near-reconstruction of the Berkeleyan God: perhaps not omnipresent, but bringing together all perceptions that do, indeed, occur.|$|E
25|$|Attention {{should be}} made to two {{important}} points in these definitions. First, in due care, steps are taken to show - this means that the steps can be verified, measured, or even produce tangible artifacts. Second, in due diligence, there are continual activities - this means that <b>people</b> <b>are</b> <b>actually</b> doing things to monitor and maintain the protection mechanisms, and these activities are ongoing.|$|E
50|$|This legend is {{particularly}} interesting because <b>people</b> <b>were</b> <b>actually</b> told {{how to protect}} themselves against a vjesci.|$|R
25|$|In 2008, {{there were}} over 14 million people arrested for violent and non-violent crime. In 2016, under 1.5 million <b>people</b> <b>were</b> <b>actually</b> incarcerated {{in state and federal}} prisons.|$|R
50|$|The Gévaudan Beast is {{an animal}} at {{the origin of}} many attacks against women and {{children}} between 1764 and 1767. It looked like a wolf or a werewolf. The beast is a legend but many <b>people</b> <b>were</b> <b>actually</b> killed.|$|R
25|$|As of 2008, {{blogging}} {{had become}} such a mania that a new blog was created every second of every minute of every hour of every day. Researchers have actively analyzed the dynamics of how blogs become popular. There are essentially two measures of this: popularity through citations, as well as popularity through affiliation (i.e., blogroll). The basic conclusion from studies {{of the structure of}} blogs is that while it takes time for a blog to become popular through blogrolls, permalinks can boost popularity more quickly, and are perhaps more indicative of popularity and authority than blogrolls, since they denote that <b>people</b> <b>are</b> <b>actually</b> reading the blog's content and deem it valuable or noteworthy in specific cases.|$|E
25|$|Studies {{show that}} there is a direct {{correlation}} between poverty and mental illness. The lower the socioeconomic status of an individual the higher the risk of mental illness. Impoverished <b>people</b> <b>are</b> <b>actually</b> two to {{three times more likely to}} develop mental illness than those of a higher economic class. This increased risk for psychiatric complications remains consistent for all individuals among the impoverished population, regardless of any in-group demographic differences that they may possess. These families must deal with economic stressors like unemployment and lack of affordable housing, which can lead to mental health disorders. A person's socioeconomic class outlines the psychosocial, environmental, behavioral, and biomedical risk factors that are associated with mental health.|$|E
500|$|The episode {{received}} mostly positive {{reviews from}} television critics. Noel Murray of The A.V. Club graded the episode with a B-, explaining that [...] "after four solid weeks of good-to-great episodes, Fringe delivered its first semi-dud of season three" [...] because the case-of-the-week was [...] "dull" [...] and [...] "twistless", and the dialogue was [...] "too flat and too earnest". Despite this, Murray thought the episode was [...] "essential viewing" [...] for Fringe fans due to certain revelations, {{such as how}} <b>people</b> <b>are</b> <b>actually</b> alive in the amber, and also because it moved the plot closer to an Olivia-Altlivia confrontation. Conversely, the Los Angeles Times Andrew Hanson {{thought it was a}} good episode, writing [...] "This is what I love about Fringe. Not only do they have the cool science, they also have the moral questions that go along". Ken Tucker from Entertainment Weekly thought the episode was [...] "enthralling," [...] and he enjoyed the brothers' [...] "nice emotional story," [...] and praised Anna Torv's acting. TV Squad reviewer Jason Hughes enjoyed the parallel universe, and in particular the character of Lincoln Lee, believing he was [...] "too rich a character to just abandon" [...] once the series stopped alternating between universes.|$|E

500|$|Those with fitting names give differing {{accounts}} {{of the effect of}} their name on their career choices. Igor Judge, former Lord Chief Justice of England and Wales, said he has no recollection of anyone commenting on his destined profession when he was a child, adding [...] "I'm absolutely convinced in my case it is entirely coincidental and I can't think of any evidence in my life that suggests otherwise." [...] James Counsell on the other hand, having chosen a career in law just like his father, his sibling, and two distant relatives, reported having been spurred on to join the bar from an early age and he cannot remember ever wanting to do anything else. Sue Yoo, an American lawyer, said that when she was younger people urged her to become a lawyer because of her name, which she thinks may have helped her decision. Weather reporter Storm Field was not sure about the influence of his name; his father, also a weather reporter, was his driving force. Psychology professor Lewis Lipsitt, a lifelong collector of aptronyms, was lecturing about nominative determinism in class when a student pointed out that Lipsitt himself was subject to the effect since he studied babies' sucking behaviour. Lipsitt said [...] "That had never occurred to me." [...] Church of England vicar Reverend Michael Vickers, who denied being a Vickers {{had anything to do with}} him becoming a vicar, suggesting instead that in some cases [...] "perhaps <b>people</b> <b>are</b> <b>actually</b> escaping from their name, rather than moving towards their job".|$|E
2500|$|David Crystal {{notes that}} use of LOL is not {{necessarily}} genuine, just {{as the use of}} smiley faces or grins is not necessarily genuine, posing the rhetorical question [...] "How many <b>people</b> <b>are</b> <b>actually</b> 'laughing out loud' when they send LOL?". Franzini concurs, stating that there is as yet no research that has determined the percentage of people who are actually laughing out loud when they write LOL.|$|E
2500|$|In October 2013, Bush {{called for}} passage of {{immigration}} reform. [...] In April 2014, Bush said of illegal immigration: [...] "It's {{an act of}} love.

There should be a price paid, but it shouldn't rile people up that <b>people</b> <b>are</b> <b>actually</b> coming to this country to provide for their families." ...|$|E

40|$|The article, basing on the {{materials}} of Siberian archives, examines {{the problem of}} everyday life of the disabled person in houses for invalids (1920 – 1930 s).

2500|$|It {{has been}} theorized {{that people who}} {{regularly}} exercise by running, bicycling, and other forward-moving activities may be more susceptible to developing piriformis syndrome {{if they do not}} engage in lateral stretching and strengthening exercises. When not balanced by lateral movement of the legs, repeated forward movements can lead to disproportionately weak hip abductors and tight adductors. Thus, disproportionately weak hip abductors/gluteus medius muscles, combined with very tight adductor muscles, can cause the piriformis muscle to shorten and severely contract. This means the abductors on the outside cannot work properly and strain is put on the piriformis. [...] However, {{it is also possible that}} such <b>people</b> <b>are</b> <b>actually</b> experiencing small herniations in a spinal disc which then impinge on the sciatic nerve and cause the piriformis to spasm secondarily. [...] Evidence for a specific relationship between the strength or weakness of certain hip muscles and sciatic nerve pain centered around the piriformis muscle remains scant. [...] Also, this sports-related explanation is useless for understanding piriformis syndrome in those who are not unusually physically active (which is often the case).|$|E
60|$|The {{very same}} remarks apply to 'Crystal-Gazing'. Folklore welcomes it in legend or in {{classical}} or savage divination. When it is asserted that {{a percentage of}} living and educated and honourable <b>people</b> <b>are</b> <b>actually</b> hallucinated by gazing into crystals, the President of the Folklore Society (Mr. Clodd) has attributed the fact to a deranged liver. {0d} This is a theory like another, and, like another, can be tested. But, if it holds water, then we have discovered {{the origin of the}} world-wide practice of crystal-gazing. It arises from an equally world-wide form of hepatic malady.|$|E
60|$|Individualism is {{the death}} of individuality. It is so, if only {{because it is an}} 'ism.' Many Americans become almost impersonal in their worship of personality. Where their natural selves might differ, their ideal selves tend to be the same. Anybody can see what I mean in those strong {{self-conscious}} photographs of American business men that can be seen in any American magazine. Each may conceive himself to be a solitary Napoleon brooding at St. Helena; but the result is a multitude of Napoleons brooding all over the place. Each of them must have the eyes of a mesmerist; but the most weak-minded person cannot be mesmerised by more than one millionaire at a time. Each of the millionaires must thrust forward his jaw, offering (if I may say so) to fight the world with the same weapon as Samson. Each of them must accentuate the length of his chin, especially, of course, by always being completely clean-shaven. It would be obviously inconsistent with Personality to prefer to wear a beard. These are of course fantastic examples on the fringe of American life; but they do stand for a certain assimilation, not through brute gregariousness, but rather through isolated dreaming. And though it is not always carried so far as this, I do think it is carried too far. There is not quite enough unconsciousness to produce real individuality. There is a sort of worship of will-power in the abstract, so that <b>people</b> <b>are</b> <b>actually</b> thinking about how they can will, more than about what they want. To this I do think a certain corrective could be found in the nature of English eccentricity. Every man in his humour is most interesting when he is unconscious of his humour; or at least when he is in an intermediate stage between humour in the old sense of oddity and in the new sense of irony. Much is said in these days against negative morality; and certainly most Americans would show a positive preference for positive morality. The virtues they venerate collectively are very active virtues; cheerfulness and courage and vim, otherwise zip, also pep and similar things. But it is sometimes forgotten that negative morality is freer than positive morality. Negative morality is a net of a larger and more open pattern, of which the lines or cords constrict at longer intervals. A man like Dr. Johnson could grow in his own way to his own stature in the net of the Ten Commandments; precisely because he was convinced there were only ten of them. He was not compressed into the mould of positive beauty, like that of the Apollo Belvedere or the American citizen.|$|E
50|$|Rock {{types are}} basalt and andesite. The only rocks {{reported}} to have been dated are 0.53 and 0.65 million-year-old basalts.

50|$|Statistical overviews {{suggest that}} the use of sedative-spiked drinks for robbing <b>people</b> <b>is</b> <b>actually</b> much more common than their use for rape. Cases of criminals taking rohypnol {{themselves}} before they commit crimes have also been reported, as the loss of inhibitions from the drug may increase their confidence to commit the offence, and the amnesia produced by the drug makes it difficult for police to interrogate them if they are caught.|$|R

50|$|The {{invitation}} {{process was}} also poorly handled. Nebraska only agreed to play 11 {{days before the}} game was to be played. Even then, the game almost didn't happen.

50|$|In April 1994 {{reports of}} {{systematic}} mass murder within Rwanda began {{to filter out}} of Rwanda and circulate throughout the world. Sadly, little was done to halt the mass killing. To outsiders the genocide was represented as tribal-based ethnic violence, with the Tutsis the victims and the Hutus as the perpetrators. Precisely how many <b>people</b> <b>were</b> <b>actually</b> murdered may never be known; estimates vary between 500,000 and over a million. The number of <b>people</b> killed <b>is</b> widely accepted as being somewhere close to 800,000.|$|R
50|$|Many early {{rock and}} roll songs dealt with issues of cars, school, dating, and clothing. The lyrics of {{rock and roll}} songs {{described}} events and conflicts that most listeners could relate to through personal experience. Topics such as sex that had generally been considered taboo began to appear in rock and roll lyrics. This new music tried to break boundaries and express emotions that <b>people</b> <b>were</b> <b>actually</b> feeling but had not talked about.
