25|$|In Simple Electromagnetic Analysis (SEMA) attacks, the {{attacker}} deduces the key directly by observing the trace. It is very effective against asymmetric cryptography implementations. Typically, {{only a few}} traces are needed, though {{the attacker}} {{needs to have a}} strong understanding of the cryptographic device and of the implementation of the cryptographic algorithm. An implementation vulnerable to SEMA attacks will perform a different operation depending on whether the bit of the key is 0 or 1, which will use different amounts of power and/or different chip components. This method is prevalent in many different types of side-channel attacks, in particular, <b>power</b> <b>analysis</b> attacks. Thus, the attacker can observe the entire computation of encryption and can deduce the key.|$|E

500|$|Throughout his life, Wrigley was an [...] "inveterate note-taker" [...] who {{compiled}} extensive documentation {{concerning the}} {{theory and practice of}} air power, on which he lectured among colleagues in the RAAF during the 1920s. The concepts that he propagated included air superiority, the need for an air force to be separate from the other branches of the armed services, control of the air as a means of carrying out offensive strikes, and the substitution of aerial forces for ground troops. While arguing for the independence of the air arm, Wrigley was quick to dispel any notion that it would simply [...] "arrive from God knows where, drop [...] bombs God knows where, and go off again God knows where"; rather it should act in concert with the army and navy in furtherance of government policy. He is thus credited with laying the foundations for the RAAF's modern air power doctrine, which would eventually be codified as the Air Power Manual in 1990. Wrigley's widow bequeathed twenty volumes of his writings, maps and photographs to the RAAF Museum at Point Cook after his death; they were edited and published by Air Commodore Brendan O'Loghlin and Wing Commander Alan Stephens in 1990 as The Decisive Factor: Air Power Doctrine by Air Vice-Marshal H.N. Wrigley. In 1996, Wrigley's former residence as commanding officer of RAAF Station Laverton prior to World WarII was christened Wrigley House in his honour. His name is also borne by Henry Wrigley Drive, approaching Darwin International Airport. In March 2010 the Chief of Air Force, Air Marshal Mark Binskin, established the AVM H.N. Wrigley Prize for air <b>power</b> <b>analysis,</b> as part of the annual Chief of Air Force Essay Competition.|$|E

A priori <b>power</b> <b>analysis</b> is conducted prior to the research study, and is typically used in estimating sufficient sample sizes to achieve adequate power. Post-hoc analysis of [...] "observed power" [...] is conducted after a study has been completed, and uses the obtained sample size and effect size to determine what the power was in the study, assuming the effect size in the sample {{is equal to the}} effect size in the population. Whereas the utility of prospective <b>power</b> <b>analysis</b> in experimental design is universally accepted, post hoc <b>power</b> <b>analysis</b> is fundamentally flawed. Falling for the temptation to use the statistical analysis of the collected data to estimate the power will result in uninformative and misleading values.

This has been extended to show that all post-hoc power analyses suffer from what is called the [...] "power approach paradox" [...] (PAP), in which a study with a null result is thought to show more evidence that the null hypothesis is actually true when the p-value is smaller, since the apparent power to detect an actual effect would be higher. In fact, a smaller p-value is properly understood to make the null hypothesis relatively less likely to be true.|$|E
