5|$|The kitchen, oratory {{and great}} chamber rose two floors, {{therefore}} only the minstrels' gallery was accessed via the main staircase {{on the second}} floor.

5000|$|In the United States, <b>pantries</b> {{evolved from}} early Colonial American [...] "butteries", {{built in a}} cold north corner of a Colonial home (more {{commonly}} referred to and spelled as [...] "butt'ry"), {{into a variety of}} <b>pantries</b> in self-sufficient farmsteads. Butler's <b>pantries,</b> or china <b>pantries,</b> were built between the dining room and kitchen of a middle class English or American home, especially {{in the latter part of}} the 19th into the early 20th centuries. Great estates, such as the Biltmore Estate in Asheville, North Carolina or Stan Hywet Hall in Akron, Ohio, had large warrens of <b>pantries</b> and other domestic [...] "offices", echoing their British [...] "Great House" [...] counterparts.|$|R
40|$|Background: Poor {{diet and}} {{physical}} inactivity {{are among the}} leading preventable causes of deaths in the United States which disproportionately affect people with low income. A healthy diet rich in fruits and vegetables may prevent the most common diet-related chronic conditions. Objective: This study explores factors that affect the ability of low income American families to consume a healthy diet. It also addresses the role of food <b>pantries</b> in providing nutritious food to families at risk of food insecurity. Methods: An online survey was emailed to 50 food <b>pantries</b> that are members of The Foodbank Inc., Dayton Ohio. Thirty three food <b>pantries</b> completed the survey. Results/Discussion: A majority of food <b>pantries</b> in the Dayton area are run by faith-based organizations. Contradictory to existing literature, most food <b>pantries</b> offer healthy foods like fresh fruits and vegetables. <b>Pantries</b> {{were less likely to}} offer dairy products, consistent with previous findings. Seventy percent of food <b>pantries</b> reported encouraging clients to eat healthier meals but only 41 % encouraged donation of healthier food items. A significant relationship between pantries’ role in encouraging clients to eat healthy foods and providing nutritional information about eating a healthy diet was found. There was no relationship between operational practices and how food <b>pantries</b> offer food or policies that encourage donation of healthy food and source of food. Conclusion: Findings suggest that nearly all <b>pantries</b> encourage clients to eat healthier diets but few encourage donation of healthy food. <b>Pantries</b> can device creative ways to acquire healthier food to meet increasing demand...|$|R

5|$|Although {{the east}} wing is well-preserved, it has {{undergone}} many changes and its initial appearance is unknown. The wing has two levels overlooking the courtyard retaining their arcades (now glassed-in), {{which are the}} same shape {{as those in the}} south wing.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this project was to {{determine}} if there are viable nutritional options available to the patrons of suburban food <b>pantries</b> located in Norton, Easton and Bridgewater, Massachusetts. The goal was to establish the existing practices of the <b>pantries,</b> how the food received is utilized, the needs of the patrons, and how corporate establishments work in conjunction with the food <b>pantries.</b> Providing nutritional options in a down economy is a difficult task if there is not a strong system currently in place or if the facility is unable to store and distribute fresh fruits, vegetables and dairy to the patrons. Mixed-methods data was collected through surveys, observations, interviews, and evaluations of each <b>pantry’s</b> operating system. Upon examining these areas, it has become clear that there are viable nutritional options available, but only if the <b>pantries</b> are willing and able to work with the corporate and local establishments. According to the Greater Boston Food Bank (GBFB), 47 % of people in eastern Massachusetts have food insecurity, {{and there has been a}} 23 % increase in the requests for assistance. Public awareness, volunteers, and new procedures within the existing food <b>pantries</b> are essential if <b>pantries</b> are to restructure toward healthier options for a service that is at risk...|$|R

5|$|The west wing's {{design is}} known only from archival records, {{since it was}} almost totally {{destroyed}} between the seventeenth and nineteenth centuries. The {{first part of the}} wing consisted of stables, a spiral staircase leading to the exterior façade, a corridor linking the courtyard to the street and a large <b>pantry.</b> During the seventeenth century, the second part held an indoor jeu de paume court and a chapel; its first floor had three large bedrooms.|$|E
5|$|When the {{building}} was finished, it had two classrooms, a kitchen, a laundry room, a <b>pantry,</b> and a main entrance on the first floor.

40|$|Indiana University-Purdue University Indianapolis (IUPUI) The thesis {{highlights}} {{the effectiveness of}} using location allocation model to find the optimum location of food <b>pantries</b> such that it serves maximum food insecure households. Since most households do not have personal means of transportation, the model makes sure that the food <b>pantries</b> are accessible at a walkable distance from the households. To reduce the shortage of food that the food <b>pantries</b> often face, the <b>pantries</b> are located near the food rescue sites like grocery stores, restaurants and institutional canteens. In this way, extra edible food with myriad choices can be diverted to the food insecure population at a walkable distance.

5|$|In the 13th {{century the}} Lower Ward was rebuilt in stone by Reynold Mohun; this {{was paid for}} in part by Reynold {{commuting}} his tenants' ongoing duty to repair the castle walls into a single, one-off financial payment to their lord, and partially through his marriage to a rich local heiress. A survey of the castle in 1266 described the Upper Ward {{on the top of}} the motte as containing a hall with a buttery, a <b>pantry,</b> a kitchen, a bakehouse, the chapel of Saint Stephen and a knight's hall, guarded by three towers. The Lower Ward included a granary, two towers and a gatehouse; one of the towers, called the Fleming Tower, was used as a prison. The castle stables lay outside the defences, further down the slope. By the end of the 13th century some of the castle's roofing had been covered in lead, while other parts still used wooden shingles.|$|E
5|$|Inside {{the inner}} ward was the castle's Great Hall and accommodation. Caerphilly was built with fashionable, high-status accommodation, {{similar to that}} built {{around the same time}} in Chepstow Castle. In the medieval period the Great Hall would have been {{subdivided}} with wooden screens, colourful decorations, with rich, detailed carving and warmed by a large, central fireplace. Some carved medieval corbels in the shape of male and female heads survive in the hall today, possibly depicting the royal court in the 1320s, including Edward II, Isabella of France, Hugh Despenser and Eleanor de Clare. To the east of the Great Hall was the castle chapel, positioned above the buttery and <b>pantry.</b> On {{the west side of the}} hall were the castle's private apartments, two solar blocks with luxurious fittings.|$|E

5|$|The Lion Tower was the {{entrance}} to {{the north end of the}} great hall. Above the archway through the tower were displayed heraldic items, symbolic of the Percy earls' power. The lion at the bottom was the emblem of the earls. Though now much damaged, above the lion were the ancient arms of the family and the arms of the Lucy family, whose property the Percys had inherited in the 1380s. As the tower was entered from the bailey, on the right was a doorway leading to the incomplete collegiate church. To the left was the great hall, and beyond that, withdrawing chambers; to the right were the buttery, <b>pantry,</b> larder, and kitchen. Immediately north of the kitchen was a postern tower. Built around 1200, its upper floors were later reused for accommodation. An entrance of lesser status than the main gatehouse, the gate's position next to the kitchen suggests it was a tradesmen's entrance, used for conveying supplies to the castle.|$|E
5|$|The Rudd Center for Professional Wine Studies, {{a two-story}} {{distillery}} building dating to around 1889, {{is used for}} the Professional Wine Studies program and was named after the Rudd family of Rudd Farms.

5|$|The bailey was {{designed}} to include a number of spacious domestic buildings. These include a great hall, a solarium, kitchen, buttery and <b>pantry,</b> with a luxuriously large number of gardrobes and fireplaces. The large towers provided additional accommodation. The design of the domestic buildings was skilfully interlocked to support the defensive arrangements of the bailey. The great hall for example, , {{was placed in the}} strongest position overlooking the river Wye, allowing it to benefit from multiple large windows and a huge fireplace without sacrificing defensive strength. Water for the castle was originally raised from the courtyard well, but was later piped in from a spring across the valley; the castle kitchens had acquired running water {{by the beginning of the}} 17th century. The design of the buildings ensured that the servants and nobility were able to live separately from one another in the confined space of the castle, revolutionary at the time.|$|E
