5|$|A {{number of}} governments linked the award of the Nobel Peace Prize to UN Peacekeepers in 1988 to the UNTAG operation, but the award {{was shared by}} peacekeepers and {{peacekeeping}} operations worldwide. Secretary-General Javier <b>Pérez</b> <b>de</b> <b>Cuéllar</b> mentioned a number of UN peacekeeping operations (including Namibia) in his Nobel lecture in Oslo on 9 January 1989. Senator Graham Richardson also made similar comments in the Australian Senate.|$|E

25|$|The UN Secretary General Kurt Waldheim visited Khao-I-Dang Hospital on August 6, 1980, and <b>Perez</b> <b>de</b> <b>Cuellar</b> {{visited on}} January 27, 1985. Former President Jimmy Carter and First Lady Rosalynn Carter visited on June 6, 1985.|$|E
25|$|In August 1991, he {{appeared}} before the Commission {{on behalf of the}} WUPJ to urge the release of Lebanese Jews held as hostages in Lebanon. In December 1991, he wrote a letter on behalf of the WUPJ appealing to UN Secretary-General Javier <b>Perez</b> <b>de</b> <b>Cuellar,</b> asking him to discover the fate of the 11 Lebanese Jews who had been kidnapped in the mid-1980s.|$|E
25|$|In 1981, Waldheim ran for an {{unprecedented}} third term as Secretary-General. He had been vetoed by China in 1971 and 1976, but {{was selected as}} Secretary-General after China changed its vetoes to abstentions. However, in 1981 China was determined to unseat Waldheim and vetoed him a record 16 times, forcing him to withdraw. He was succeeded by Javier <b>Pérez</b> <b>de</b> <b>Cuéllar</b> of Peru.|$|E
50|$|As <b>Pérez</b> <b>de</b> <b>Cuéllar's</b> {{second term}} {{drew to a}} close in 1991, the {{campaign}} for an African Secretary-General got underway. The Organization of African Unity promised that its member states would vote against any non-African candidates in the General Assembly. The Non-Aligned Movement also endorsed the six official candidates from Africa. Since the Non-Aligned Movement included a majority of the votes in the UN General Assembly, it could block any candidate recommended by the Security Council. China again declared its support for a Secretary-General from Africa. However, the other four permanent members of the Security Council rejected the principle of regional rotation.|$|R
5000|$|As Javier <b>Pérez</b> <b>de</b> <b>Cuéllar's</b> {{first term}} {{came to a}} close in 1986, the United Nations faced {{mounting}} financial difficulties. After the United States Congress cut the U.S. contribution to the U.N., Pérez said that he would only serve another term if the Reagan administration would agree to pay the U.S. dues. Pérez, who had undergone quadruple-bypass surgery in August 1986, said, [...] "I don't have to make a sacrifice and die with my ship." [...] If he could live his life over again, he said he would have become a concert pianist instead of Secretary-General, [...] "but in my country, that was only for girls." ...|$|R

25|$|Ambassador Javier <b>Pérez</b> <b>de</b> <b>Cuéllar,</b> {{the former}} Peruvian Secretary-General of the United Nations {{and founder of}} UPP, told the press on December 5, 2005 {{that he did not}} support the {{election}} of Humala as the party's presidential candidate. He said that after being the UPP presidential candidate in 1995, he had not had any further contact with UPP and therefore did not take part in choosing Humala as the party's presidential candidate for the 2006 elections.|$|E
25|$|The 1993 Constitution allowed Fujimori {{to run for}} {{a second}} term, and in April 1995, {{at the height of}} his popularity, Fujimori easily won reelection with almost two-thirds of the vote. His major opponent, former Secretary-General of the United Nations Javier <b>Pérez</b> <b>de</b> <b>Cuéllar,</b> won only 22 percent of the vote. Fujimori's {{supporters}} won comfortable majorities in the legislature. One of the first acts of the new congress was to declare an amnesty for all members of the Peruvian military or police accused or convicted of human rights abuses between 1980 and 1995.|$|E
25|$|In 1989, Goldsmith {{helped to}} organise an {{international}} campaign {{calling for an}} immediate end {{to the destruction of}} the world's remaining forests with its detrimental effects on indigenous cultures, biodiversity and global climate. The campaign raised over 3 million signatures, which were taken in wheelbarrows to the UN's headquarters in New York City. Goldsmith and a party of activists subsequently occupied the main lobby, refusing to move until the Secretary General, <b>Perez</b> <b>de</b> <b>Cuellar,</b> agreed to see them. The group demanded for him to call an extraordinary general meeting of the Security Council to tackle the global crisis of deforestation. Although failing, the campaign managed to organise a meeting in the US Senate with a group of senators, headed by Al Gore, whom the activists called upon to end their support of the World Bank.|$|E

25|$|She did, however, greet {{a number}} of Canadian Royal Family members, {{including}} the Queen and her husband, Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh; Queen Elizabeth, the Queen Mother; and the Duke and Duchess of York. Prince Edward met with Sauvé at Rideau Hall on June 4, 1988, to present the Governor General with royal Letters Patent permitting the federal viceroy to exercise the Queen's powers in respect of the granting of heraldic arms in Canada, leading to the eventual creation of the Canadian Heraldic Authority, of which Sauvé was the first head. Among foreign visitors welcomed by Sauvé were King Carl XVI Gustav of Sweden, Queen Beatrix of the Netherlands, King Hussein of Jordan, Pope John Paul II, Secretary-General of the United Nations Javier <b>Pérez</b> <b>de</b> <b>Cuéllar,</b> President François Mitterrand of France, Chinese President Li Xiannian, Romanian President Nicolae Ceauşescu, Mother Teresa, and, eventually, President Reagan. A number of these state visits were reciprocated when Sauvé travelled to represent the Queen in Italy, the Vatican, the People's Republic of China, Thailand, France, Uruguay, and Brazil.|$|E
500|$|The Australian {{mission was}} widely {{reported}} as successful. Colonel John Crocker, {{commander of the}} second Australian contingent (2ASC), wrote that the November 1989 election was UNTAG's raison d'être and observed that [...] "the Australian contingent's complete and wide-ranging support was {{critical to the success}} of that election and hence the mission – a fact that has been acknowledged at the highest level in UNTAG". Javier <b>Pérez</b> <b>de</b> <b>Cuéllar,</b> Secretary-General of the United Nations, wrote to Gareth Evans (Australia's Foreign Minister) about the [...] "remarkable contribution made by the Australian military and electoral personnel", saying that their [...] "dedication and professionalism had been widely and deservedly praised". Although a total of 19 UN personnel lost their lives in Namibia, the two Australian contingents achieved their mission without sustaining any fatalities – one of the few military units in UNTAG to do so.|$|E
500|$|Mikhail Gorbachev, then General Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, said, [...] "The {{main reason}} {{that there has}} been no {{national}} consolidation so far is that Comrade Karmal is hoping to continue sitting in Kabul with our help." [...] Karmal's position became less secure when the Soviet leadership began blaming him for the failures in Afghanistan. Gorbachev, worried over the situation, told the Soviet Politburo [...] "If we don't change approaches , we will be fighting there for another 20 or 30 years." [...] It is not clear when the Soviet leadership began to campaign for Karmal's dismissal, but Andrei Gromyko discussed the possibility of Karmal's resignation with Javier <b>Pérez</b> <b>de</b> <b>Cuéllar,</b> the Secretary-General of the United Nations in 1982. While it was Gorbachev who would dismiss Karmal, {{there may have been a}} consensus within the Soviet leadership in 1983 that Karmal should resign. Gorbachev's own plan was to replace Karmal with Mohammad Najibullah, who had joined the PDPA at its creation. Najibullah was thought highly of by Yuri Andropov, Boris Ponomarev and Dmitriy Ustinov, and negotiations for his succession may have started in 1983. Najibullah was not the Soviet leadership's only choice for Karmal's succession; a GRU report noted that the majority of the PDPA leadership would support Assadullah Sarwari's ascension to leadership. According to the GRU, Sarwari was a better candidate as he could balance between the Pashtuns, Tajiks and Uzbeks; Najibullah was a Pashtun nationalist. Another viable candidate was Abdul Qadir, who had been a participant in the Saur Revolution.|$|E

2500|$|Relations with France became {{strained}} when French {{agents of}} the DGSE bombed and sank the Greenpeace ship the Rainbow Warrior on 10 July 1985 while it lay moored in Auckland Harbour, killing photographer Fernando Pereira. In June 1986 Lange obtained a political deal with France over the Rainbow Warrior affair, presided over by United Nations Secretary-General Javier <b>Pérez</b> <b>de</b> <b>Cuéllar.</b> [...] France agreed to pay compensation of NZ$13million (US$6.5million) to New Zealand and also to apologise. In return, Lange agreed that French authorities could detain the convicted French agents Alain Mafart and Dominique Prieur at the French military base on Hao Atoll for three years. However, both spies were freed by May 1988, {{less than two years}} later.|$|E

2500|$|President of the United States George H. W. Bush and {{chancellor}} of West Germany Helmut Kohl urged peaceful reforms and criticised the Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact. On 31 August, the Baltic activists issued a joint declaration to Javier <b>Pérez</b> <b>de</b> <b>Cuéllar,</b> Secretary-General of the United Nations. They {{claimed to be}} under threat of aggression and asked for an international commission {{to be sent to}} monitor the situation. Almost immediately after the broadcast the tone in Moscow began to soften [...] and the Soviet authorities failed to follow up on any of their threats. Eventually, according to historian Alfred Erich Senn, the pronouncement became a source of embarrassment. On 19-20 September, the Central Committee of the Communist Party convened to discuss the nationality question – something Mikhail Gorbachev had been postponing since early 1988. The plenum did not specifically address the situation in the Baltic states and reaffirmed old principles regarding the centralised Soviet Union and the dominant role of the Russian language. It did promise some increase in autonomy, but was contradictory and failed to address the underlying reasons for the conflict.|$|E
2500|$|President George H. W. Bush resumed the {{tradition}} of lighting the National Christmas Tree from a platform on The Ellipse in 1989. In 1991, President Bush presided over the tree-lighting ceremony with five Americans who had recently been released by their kidnappers in Lebanon: journalist Terry A. Anderson, university employee Joseph Cicippio, professor Alann Steen, professor Thomas Sutherland, and professor Jesse Turner. Also in attendance was Secretary-General of the United Nations Javier <b>Pérez</b> <b>de</b> <b>Cuéllar,</b> who had helped negotiate {{the release of the}} hostages. Anderson attempted to light the tree twice, but failed. Bush tried to the light the tree, and after several seconds the lights finally came on. In 1992, the National Park Service permitted the first National Christmas Tree ornament to be produced. [...] The designer was Peggy Henkel, president of Georgetown Marketing Company (formerly American Marketing), and to avoid rules against commercialization the ornament was distributed without charge. 1992 was also the year that the National Christmas Tree and Pageant of Peace was featured on the official White House House Christmas card. The card was created by artist Kamil Kubik and printed by Hallmark Cards.|$|E
2500|$|The United Nations {{became more}} {{involved}} with the conflict in 1976. In 1979, the Organisation of African Unity (OAU) also {{became involved in the}} Settlement Plan. The UN and the OAU introduced a plan in the late 1980s and negotiated with parties for about five years. On July 20, King Hassan of Morocco agreed to a referendum [...] "for the self-determination" [...] of the Western Saharan people. Once eligible voters were identified for the referendum, the people of Western Sahara would vote on whether they would be independent or become part of Morocco. The plan [...] "was accepted in principle by Morocco and Polisario at the end of August 1988." [...] The referendum was written up in Security Council Resolution 658. The United Nations Security Council became involved in 1991. The agreement resulted in a cease-fire between Morocco and Polisario, which went into effect on September 6, 1991. The cease-fire was treated as a separate issue {{from the rest of the}} Settlement Plan, which included voter registration for the referendum, by <b>Pérez</b> <b>de</b> <b>Cuéllar,</b> the current United Nations Secretary General. The referendum was written up as Security Council Resolution 690 on April 29, 1991. Resolution 690 also created the United Nations Mission for the Referendum in Western Sahara (MINURSO).|$|E
