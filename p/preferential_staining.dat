Solute movement through soil is governed by various hydraulic and physical properties that determine water flow. To study such relationships, a pedotransfer function of groundwater pollution was developed in two alluvial irrigated soils under long-term pig slurry applications. Two basins of central Chile, San Pedro (Typic Xerochrepts) and Pichidegua (Mollic Xerofluvents) were selected, where maize (Zea mays L.) was grown in spring-summer, while during autumn-winter period a ryegrass-barleyoat mixed crop was established in San Pedro and a fallow management applied in Pichidegua. Soils in cultivated and control sites were characterized in physical and hydraulic terms. Nitrogen and water budgets were determined measuring periodically (biweekly) N concentration (N-NO 3 - and N-NH 4 +) and monitoring water contents in soil profiles, respectively. Dye tracer tests were performed with brilliant blue (BB) dye and the staining patterns analyzed. To contrast the effect of slurry additions over soil physical properties and over NL, t-Student tests were performed. Some accurate pollution groundwater NL pedotransfer functions were obtained calculated through least square fit models and artificial neural networks.

A pilot study on ApcMin mice has been performed to preliminarily test this new cancer screening approach. As a cancer-targeting agent, poly(epsilon-caprolactone) microparticles (PCLMPs), labeled with a NIR dye and functionalized with an RGD (argenine-glycine-aspartic acid) peptide, were used.

Four patterns of nuclear staining have been described, namely, homogeneous, peripheralt, speck-led, and nucleolar. The homogeneous and peri-pheral patterns, reflecting antibodies to nucleopro-tein and desoxyribonucleic acid respectively, have been correlated primarily with the clinical diagnosis of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) (Friou, 1958; Casals and others, 1963).

Among the different water flow and mass transfer determination methods, staining tracers have the best spatial resolution allowing visualization and quantification of fluid flow including <b>preferential</b> flow paths. <b>Staining</b> techniques have been used successfully for several decades; however, the hydrological community is still searching for an "ideal" vadose zone tracer regarding flow path visualization. To date, most research using staining dyes is carried out with Brilliant Blue FCF. Fluorescent dyes such as Uranine, however, have significant advantages over nonfluorescents which makes them a promising alternative. This paper presents the first analysis of key properties any fluorescent substance must possess to qualify as a staining fluorescent tracer in vadose zone hydrological applications. First, we summarize the main physico-chemical properties of Uranine and evaluate its staining tracer potential with conventional suitability indicators and visibility testing in a soil profile. Based on numerical analysis using the theory of fluorescence, we show that a low molar absorption coefficient is a crucial parameter to quantify concentration accurately. In addition, excitation of a tracer on wavelengths different from the maximum excitation wavelength can extend the linear range of the concentration-fluorescence relationship significantly. Finally, we develop criteria for evaluating the suitability of any potential fluorescent soil staining compound for soil hydrological applications: 1) high quantum yield, 2) low molar absorption coefficient, 3) fluorescence independent of temperature, 4) low photodecomposition rates, and 5) fluorescence stable across {{a wide range of}} pH values...|$|R

Similarities and differences in infiltration, percolation and preferential flow paths between both hillslopes could be identified by sprinkling experiments with Brilliant Blue and Fluorescein sodium.

The results show that biomat flow, shallow subsurface flow in the organic topsoil layer, occurred at both hillslopes; however, at the peat bog hillslope it was significantly more prominent. The dye solutions infiltrated into the soil and continued either as lateral subsurface pipe flow in the case of the peat bog, or percolated vertically towards the bedrock in the case of the Podzol.

Cardiac muscle frozen sections show no pronounced I-band staining, except in local areas where brevin may have penetrated from adjacent blood vessels. Spreading platelets show endogenous gelsolin localized at the cell periphery, in the central cytoplasmic mass and on thin fibers that radiate from the central cytoplasm. Addition of 3 - 30 micrograms/ml of brevin to the antibodies restores intense stress fiber and I-band staining. We see no evidence for large-scale severing and removal of filaments in stress fibers in formaldehyde-fixed, acetone-permeabilized cells even at brevin concentrations of 30 micrograms/ml. The added brevin or brevin antibody complex binds to actin filaments and is detected by the fluorescently tagged secondary antibody. Brevin binding occurs in either Ca 2 + or EGTA, but is slightly more intense in EGTA suggesting some severing and filament removal may occur in Ca 2 +. The I-band staining is limited to the region where actin and myosin do not overlap. In addition, brevin does not appear to bind at the Z-line. A comparison of cells double- labeled with fluorescein-phallotoxin, exogenous brevin, and a monoclonal antibody, detected with a rhodamine-labeled secondary antibody, shows almost complete co-localization of F-actin with the brevin-gelsolin-binding sites. A major exception is {{in the area of the}} adhesion plaque. A quantitative comparison of the fluorescein-rhodamine fluorescence intensities along a stress fiber and into the adhesion plaque shows that the fluorescein signal, associated with F-actin, increases while the rhodamine signal decreases.

Investigation of chromosome dynamics in prophase of trisomy 18 oocytes show that these events follow the major patterns seen earlier in euploid oocytes.

40|$|Unsaturated solute {{transport}} is highly variable and therefore difficult to predict. In semi-arid areas, where water resources are limited, {{the presence of}} macropores is of great importance for crop production. The bromide ion (Br-) and dye tracers are useful for studies of water movement. One approach to describe the heterogeneous {{solute transport}} is to apply the concept of fractals to a dataset. <b>Preferential</b> paths <b>stained</b> with dye often exhibit geometries reminiscent of fractals allowing fractal analyses and modeling. This thesis concentrates {{on the case of}} semiarid clay soils in Tunisia. The objectives of this study were: (1) to test whether dye tracing experiments using Vitasyn Blau AE 85 can be employed to visualize solute transport in the unsaturated zone, (2) to characterize the spatial variability of solute transport at the catchment and plot scales in the semi-arid soils, (3) to determine whether solute transport patterns displays scaling behavior, and (4) to apply fractal models to simulate the heterogeneity of solute transport. To test whether tracing can indeed be used to detect the wetting front, a field experiment was conducted in Sweden with simultaneous application of bromide and the dye Vitasyn-Blau AE 85 to a single plot. To investigate spatial variability of a semi-arid soil with preferential pathways, three sites in the catchment M?Richet el Anze, Tunisia, were selected. On each site, two framed plots were established and irrigated with water mixed with the dye tracer Vitasyn-Blau AE 85. The plots were excavated and the dye patterns were photographed. For the semiarid soils, dye penetration data was stored as both 1 D series with a resolution of 0. 14 cm/pixel, and as 2 D fields, with a resolution of 2. 5 cm/pixel. The results from the pilot study in Sweden showed that the two tracers are transported in soils in a similar way and are therefore comparable. The dye as compared to bromide was retarded with a factor of 1. 5, which is within the range of previous published results for sandy soils. For the semiarid soils, {{it was found that the}} spatial variability of the dye patterns increased with scale. The soils from the different physiographic areas (nose, slope, and hollow) of the catchment displayed significantly different responses to the infiltrating dye. Nose and hollow areas exhibited larger susceptibility to preferential flow while the slope soils had less deep cracks and fissures. At the plot-scale, cross-correlations and power spectrum analyses indicated that the preferential pathways were randomly distributed. The power-law behavior of the dye patterns spectral density suggested scale invariance and self-similarity. For probability density functions (pdf) of the 2 D fields, plots P 1 (hollow) and P 3 (slope) displayed clear hyperbolic behavior. The pdfs of the breakdown coefficients (bdcs) for the first three scales (0. 14 to 0. 56 cm) for P 1 and P 3 were well related to each other, indicating scale-invariance. For the 2 D analysis, raw statistical moments and K(q) functions showed that the fields were multiscaling. For the 1 D field with higher resolutions, a scale break was indicated in the moment functions for all plots except P 4 at a flow path width of 4. 4 cm. The K(q) -functions were linear for P 3, P 4 and P 5 and for low scales (4. 4 cm) at P 1, the functions were non-linear, implying multifractal behavior. The Diffusion Limited Aggregation (DLA) model was tested on the 1 D data fields. The model was calibrated against one plot (P 3) and was able to accurately simulate both the depth distribution of dye coverage and its variability for a second plot (P 4). The Universal Multifractal (UM) random cascade model was tested on the 2 D data fields to model preferential flow. There was good agreement between observations and simulations which implies that the model is able to describe the data. The results collected within the appended papers indicate scaling behavior of dye stained solute pathways in unsaturated semiarid clay soils. The high resolution and quality of the datasets used in this work should be emphasized. Such data are important because they can be used to test new models and theoretical approaches. It would be interesting to investigate large-scale variability (m-km) and small-scale (cm-mm) variability.

A number of Golgi apparatuses in the cortical ooplasm are also positively stained with lead precipitates. With the proceeding of the ovarian development it becomes progressively more difficult to demonstrate cytochemically the enzyme over the yolk platelets.

Experiments on the mechanisms of micronutrient uptake and their accumulation in the plant body and the seeds showed a correlation between zinc and protein amount in the seed, which suggested some proteins, mostly abundant in the embryo and the aleurone layer, might be sinks for zinc. There {{is a lack of}} knowledge on zinc binding proteins of wheat seed. In this project, we aimed to determine the effect of environmental conditions on the protein and micronutrient {{content of the}} durum wheat seed and to screen the proteome of the wheat seed to identify the proteins with metalin particular Zn-binding propensity. Protein analyses were carried out on seeds with extreme N and Zn content. Extraction methods available in the literature were modified to obtain reproducible profiles of the total protein content and to separate seed proteins into fractions of different storage protein classes. Extracts were analyzed using polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and a procedure for detection of Zn-binding proteins was developed. Results showed Zn-binding by Cys rich proteins in the molecular mass range 30 to 50 kDa. The method was extensively tested to confirm the association of Zn with specific proteins, however, if those proteins bind metal in vivo remains to be shown. Microscopic analysis of in situ staining for protein and Zn localization showed <b>preferential</b> <b>staining</b> in the embryo and aleurone layers of the seed and led to determination of the protein profiles from embryo and endosperm tissues, separately. The methods developed during this and further studies, shall be used to do the same screening for different wild-type and cultivated genotypes of wheat...|$|E
40|$|Integrins are {{a family}} of heterodimeric cell surface {{molecules}} that function as adhesion receptors in cell–cell and cell–extracellular matrix contact. Integrins of the β 1 family are found on keratinocytes clustered at sites of cell–cell junctions both in culture and in normal skin. The possibility that these integrins function in cell–cell adhesion has been both supported and refuted in recent conflicting publications. Rather than testing further for {{the presence or absence}} of an interaction, we present evidence to show that β 1 integrins in keratinocyte cell–cell junctions are in the non-ligand–occupied conformation. We transfected keratinocytes with a construct that expresses a chimeric cell surface molecule containing the integrin β 1 cytoplasmic tail. This chimera is thought to mimic the ligand-occupied receptor and has previously been shown to be actively localized to focal adhesions in fibroblasts. We find that keratinocytes are also able to localize this chimera in focal adhesions but do not localize it to areas of cell–cell junctions. A monoclonal anti-β 1 antibody that has been previously shown to preferentially recognize ligand-occupied β 1 receptors was used to stain keratinocytes. This antibody showed staining of focal adhesions, with little or no staining of cell–cell junctions. In contrast, four other anti-β 1 antibodies showed strong, <b>preferential</b> <b>staining</b> at cell–cell junctions. Double staining confirmed that both the conformation-specific monoclonal antibody and a pan-β 1 antibody were capable of recognizing the same focal adhesions. Taken together, these data indicate that integrins in cell–cell junctions of keratinocytes are in the non-ligand–occupied conformation. Although we do not directly prove the absence of an integrin-integrin interaction at this site, we show that any such interaction does nor induce the ligand-occupied conformation and, therefore, is less likely to play a major role in cytoskeletal re-organization or signal transduction...|$|E
