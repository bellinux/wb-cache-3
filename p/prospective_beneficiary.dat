50|$|A trust {{can be set}} up {{either to}} benefit {{particular}} persons, or for any charitable purposes (but not generally for non-charitable purposes): typical examples are a will trust for the testator's children and family, a pension trust (to confer benefits on employees and their families) and a charitable trust.

50|$|Further, {{and perhaps}} most strikingly, it has been held that a {{solicitor}} advising a client about a proposed dealing with his property in his lifetime owes no duty of care to a <b>prospective</b> <b>beneficiary</b> under the client's then will who may be prejudicially affected. In Clarke v Bruce Lance & Co. (1988) 1 WLR 881, it was recognised that solicitors may sometimes give advice which directly prejudices the interests of others who {{have a relationship with}} the client. But, so long as this advice is consistent with the duty owed to the client, there will be no liability to that third party. Exceptionally, solicitors have been held to have assumed a responsibility towards the claimant, i.e. in situations analogous to a holding a fund on behalf of both sides of a dispute pending its resolution.|$|E

40|$|In the {{literature}} on directly unproductive profit seeking or rent seeking, intervention-seeking by labor and industry groups is generally restricted to direct lobbying activity. However, import-competing producers may have an additional instrument to influence the decision to grant protection. Under well-established injury criteria for protection import-competing producers have an incentive, either collectively or individually, to feign injury. To {{the extent that the}} free-rider problem can be overcome, orchestrating the appearance of injury is an intervention-seeking activity that may be complementary to DUP lobbying. When the established indicators of industry well-being include variables controlled by the <b>prospective</b> <b>beneficiaries,</b> therefore, free trade under the prospect of protection is potentially accompanied by a concomitant spurious-injury distortion. Some of the positive and welfare implications of the theory of spurious injury are investigated in both a partial equilibrium framework and in the Heckscher-Ohlin model.

40|$|Policies and {{programs}} designed to challenge the effects of racial discrimination (such as affirmative action) are hotly contested. Factors which have been proposed to explain opposition to these policies include racial prejudice, group threat and self-interest,and perceptions of intergroup justice. We report the results of two random national telephone surveys which tested a theoretically based model of the predictors of policy support in post-apartheid South Africa. The results provided limited support for Blumer’s group position model. Compensatory and preferential treatment policies had different underlying predictors: Violated entitlement featured in the models ofcompensatory policy attitudes, but not preferential treatment policy attitudes, where threat was the strongest predictor. In addition to threat and violated entitlement, policy attitudes among the black sample were related to ingroup identification but those of the white sample were related to prejudice. The effects of these variables were in the opposite directions for the two samples: Policy support was associated with strong ingroup identification {{and high levels of}} threat among the black sample (i. e. <b>prospective</b> <b>beneficiaries</b> of the transformation policies), but with low levels of prejudice and threat among the white sample. We conclude by considering the implications that these findings have for social change programs...|$|R

40|$|Purpose – This {{research}} aims {{to explore}} the theoretical nature of salam contract in depth, the extent of its use in the banking arena of Malaysia and to test the theoretical feasibility of its future application by the Islamic banks in Malaysia by suggesting an Islamic banking product structure based on salam contract. Design/methodology/approach – This is a legal exploratory study primarily focused on library research. Findings – Salam contract is more susceptible to risks {{than the rest of}} the Islamic commercial contracts used by the Islamic banks in Malaysia and none of the Islamic banks in the country utilize this type of contract as a mode of financing. However, the research indicates that a feasible banking product based on salam contract could be formulated to help poor farmers in the country. To prove this a new model product based on salam contract to help farmers is created by the authors and the pros and cons of the product with the risk mitigating ways are explored. It is found that theoretically, this product is workable. Originality/value – This research will complement the knowledge based on practical applicability of salam and is targeted to the Islamic financial Institutions in Malaysia, who are the <b>prospective</b> <b>beneficiaries.</b> Banking, Financial risk, Financing, Islam, Malaysia...|$|R
40|$|This study {{investigates the}} {{contribution}} of the Girinka Programme, a pro-poor growth programme in Rwanda, to poverty reduction. Recent studies have placed increasing emphasis on {{the contribution of}} pro-poor growth to poverty reduction and have argued that pro-poor growth has the potential to reduce poverty more effectively than economic growth. Poverty, for this study, is measured based on the following indicators of poverty derived from the United Nations (1998) definition of poverty: nutrition, access to health care services, access to water, education, and access to credit. Income or the lack thereof, is not the sole determinant of poverty, and is not “the sum total of human life” (United Nations Development Programme, 1990), therefore relying solely on quantitative measurements of poverty that are based on income can paint an incomplete picture of the reality on the ground. Therefore, since poverty is multidimensional, this study uses a multidimensional approach to its analysis and goes beyond the quantitative aspects of poverty. Qualitative research methods were used for this study, and fieldwork was conducted in Kayonza District, located in the Eastern Province of Rwanda. In-depth interviews were held with <b>beneficiaries</b> and <b>prospective</b> <b>beneficiaries</b> of the Girinka Programme {{in order to determine the}} programme’s contribution to a meaningful reduction in poverty. In addition, interviews were held with Girinka local and national programme officials. Secondary data in the form of programme documents was also collected, reviewed and analysed...|$|R
40|$|Testimony {{issued by}} the Government Accountability Office with an {{abstract}} that begins "In the 21 st century our nation faces a growing fiscal imbalance. A demographic shift will begin to affect the federal budget in 2008 as the first baby boomers become eligible for Social Security benefits. This shift will increase as spending for federal health and retirement programs swells. Long-term commitments for these and other federal programs will drive a massive imbalance between spending and revenues that cannot be eliminated without tough choices and significant policy changes. Continued economic growth is critical and will help to ease the burden, but the projected fiscal gap {{is so great that}} it is unrealistic to expect that we will grow our way out of the problem. Early action to change existing programs and policies would yield the highest fiscal dividends and provide a longer period for <b>prospective</b> <b>beneficiaries</b> to make adjustments in their own planning. One of the potential policy changes is assisting older workers who want to stay in the workforce past retirement age. The Chairman and Ranking Member of the Senate Special Committee on Aging asked GAO to discuss demographic and labor force trends and the economic and fiscal need to increase labor force participation among older workers. This testimony will address those factors making it important to encourage those who want to work to continue doing so, as well as factors affecting older Americans' employment decisions. ...|$|R

40|$|One of {{the best}} ways to {{understand}} the organization’s degree of performance and delivery is through assessing and analyzing its capacity both at functional and organizational level. When this was done during needs assessment which involved the Kibaha People Living with HIV/AIDS (KIPELIHA) in 2010 / 2011, it was found that (KIPELIHA) lacks focus and cannot deliver to the intended level. Therefore, the <b>prospective</b> <b>beneficiaries,</b> even its members and staff, did not really benefit from its existence. The findings of the said assessment further revealed that, KIPELIHA, which hosted this project had lots of managerial weaknesses especially on matters relating to governance such as lack of clear accountability lines; lack of guiding documents such as strategic plan; and weak constitution. As such, it lacked strategic focus. There was no vision, mission or good organizational structure. Therefore the transparency and accountability patterns were not there. These gaps endangered its existence and therefore, its sustainability was at stake to the detriment of the needy people of its services. At that critical juncture, this project came to a rescue. It focused on capacity strengthening. One of the objectives was to enhance its intervention and deliverance. Different ways and processes or rather steps made this possible including development of the organization strategic plan. The report is divided into six Chapters, chapter one is for situational analysis or needs assessment. Chapter two is for problem identification. Chapter three covers literature reviews. Chapter four presents implementation processes while chapter five gives an account of monitoring, evaluation and sustainability plans. The last chapter makes recommendation for further improvements. ...|$|R

40|$|A common {{narrative}} {{in the late}} twentieth–early twenty-first centuries is that historic rural landscapes and cultural practices {{are in danger of}} disappearing in the face of modern development pressures. However, efforts to preserve rural landscapes have dichotomized natural and cultural resources and tended to “freeze” these resources in time. They have essentialized the character of both “rural” and “developed” and ignored the dynamic natural and cultural processes that produce them. In this dissertation I outline an agenda for critical and applied heritage research that reframes heritage as a transformative social practice in order to move beyond the hegemonic treatment of heritage as the objects of cultural property. I propose an anthropological theory of shared heritage: a culturally mediated ethical practice that references the past in order to intervene in alienating processes of the present to secure a recognizable future for practitioners and <b>prospective</b> <b>beneficiaries.</b> More specifically, I develop (1) an ethical framework for shared heritage practice that values social tolerance and future security, (2) a model for the critical assessment of a heritage protection strategy’s potential for supporting a shared heritage ethic, and (3) a methodology for scholars, heritage advocates, and community leaders to realistically enact shared heritage. I document two case studies of rural residents implementing heritage protection strategies in the face of suburban and tourism development in Hadley, Massachusetts, and Eleuthera, Bahamas, respectively. I engage with these case studies at three distinct levels: (1) locating and critiquing the potential for a shared heritage ethics in the attempts to preserve private agricultural land in Hadley; (2) developing and applying a community-based heritage inventory assessment in Hadley; and (3) modeling an internet-based communications system for supporting shared heritage development in Eleuthera. Taken together, this dissertation offers an anthropological model for documenting and analyzing the discursive and material productions of cultural identities and landscapes inherent in heritage resource protection and a set of methods that heritage professionals and practitioners can apply to cultivate shared heritage ethics...|$|R
40|$|Poverty is {{an issue}} that is {{important}} and fundamental to always be solved by every country in the world. Poverty causes a one not to meet his own basic needs and their families that encompasses physical, mental and social needs. To solve this problem the government is attempting to find solutions in various ways, one of which is through a social assistance (Bansos), a surgical program, managed by the Local Government. The aims of this study were 1) to analyze the perceptions of beneficiaries of house surgeon about the existence of this program, 2) to know whether there is an increase in the quality of the house of the poor community before and after receiving assistance of surgical program, 3) to determine what constraints faced by the Government in the implementation of surgical programs, 4) to determine the efforts made to overcome the shortcomings encountered in the surgical program in Buleleng. The data used were primary data and secondary data. Data collection methods used were observation, questionnaires, and in-depth interviews. The tool analysis used was descriptive and nonparametric statistical analysis using average paired difference test (Wilcoxon test). The results obtained were 1) the perception of poor beneficiaries of the existence of the house most of the surgical program provides a positive statement (Agree and Strongly Agree), the rest gave a statement neutral, and negative statements (Strongly Disagree and Disagree). 2) The Ho is rejected. This means that there is an increase in the quality of the house of the poor community after receiving surgical assistance. 3) The constraints faced in the implementation of the surgical program are verification, exploration, socialization, and development. 4) Efforts being made to overcome the disadvantages faced by the government in the implementation of the program are to prepare a consultant surgical assistant, handing the main actors in the home surgery program to the village community, and {{there is a need to}} develop standard conditions of <b>prospective</b> <b>beneficiaries...</b>|$|R
40|$|This {{response}} to Professor Motomura considers what is lost through {{the elaboration of}} formally defined boundaries around prosecutorial discretion. Professor Motomura and others in this Issue rightly extol the many benefits of the President 2 ̆ 7 s November 2014 executive actions. While I share the view that those benefits are considerable, I believe a full accounting requires us to consider what gets lost in this process, including identification of the immigrants in the limbo space between the actions 2 ̆ 7 <b>prospective</b> <b>beneficiaries</b> at the one end {{and those who are}} priorities for removal on the other. This Essay focuses on the cost that comes from the loss of a different kind of discretion in immigration law, where discretionary authority can act as a corrective measure at the edges of rules, where defined edges bump up against immigrants in limbo. Discretion is always an elusive concept: 2 ̆ 2 interstitial, 2 ̆ 2 and like the hole in a doughnut, as Professor Dan Kanstroom has written-defined more by what is around it than by the space itself. The less defined the edges of that space are, the more that space is full of possibility. The malleability of this space generally cuts against the values of transparency and accountability that are rightly lauded by many of the scholars in this symposium Issue. Individualized discretion, guided generally by policy interests and preferences, and not subject to carefully drawn limits and clearly defined edges, is indeed anathema to those values-and yet it serves an important purpose. The discretion available at the law 2 ̆ 7 s margins constitutes a vital means to correct the errors that inevitably happen at the law 2 ̆ 7 s edges, where even the best rules do an imperfect job of capturing the world 2 ̆ 7 s complexity. This kind of remedial, equitable discretion is a kind of discretion that has been steadily whittled down over the past twenty-five years in immigration law...|$|R
40|$|This {{document}} {{represents the}} final report from the Applied Physics Laboratory (APL) of The Johns Hopkins University on its {{efforts on behalf of}} the Division of Geothermal Energy (DGE) of the Department of Energy (DOE). For the past four years, the Laboratory has been fostering development of geothermal energy in the Eastern United States. While the definition of ''Eastern'' has changed somewhat from time to time, basically it means the area of the continental United States east of the Rocky Mountains, plus Puerto Rico but excluding the geopressured regions of Texas and Louisiana. During these years, the Laboratory developed a background in geology, hydrology, and reservoir analysis to aid it in establishing the marketability of geothermal energy in the east. Contrary to the situation in the western states, the geothermal resource in the east was clearly understood to be inferior in accessible temperature. On the other hand, there were known to be copious quantities of water in various aquifers to carry the heat energy to the surface. More important still, the east possesses a relatively dense population and numerous commercial and industrial enterprises, so that thermal energy, almost wherever found, would have a market. Thus, very early on {{it was clear that the}} primary use for geothermal energy in the east would be for process heat and space conditioning [...] heating and cool electrical production was out of the question. The task then shifted to finding users colocated with resources. This task met with modest success on the Atlantic Coastal Plain. A great deal of economic and demographic analysis pinpointed the <b>prospective</b> <b>beneficiaries,</b> and an intensive ''outreach'' campaign was mounted to persuade the potential users to invest in geothermal energy. The major handicaps were: (1) The lack of demonstrated hydrothermal resources with known temperatures and expected longevity; and (2) The lack of a ''bellwether'' installation for entrepreneurs to see, touch, and emulate. It is only at the present time that these two issues appear to be on the way to resolution by DGE user-coupled programs in the east...|$|R
40|$|Legal {{scholars}} have extensively debated {{the merits of}} the monopolistic nature of patent rights in contrast to the public interest objectives of competition law. Recently, the discussion has turned to standard essential patents and patent holders’ right to seek and enforce injunctions ex-post making a commitment to license essential patents under FRAND (fair, reasonable, and non- discriminatory) terms and conditions. Although lacking a common definition thereof, FRAND commitments significantly impact the remedies available to standard essential patent (SEP) holders, particularly their right to seek and enforce injunctions and the amount of damages potentially awarded. In fact, based on a risk of patent hold-up, which largely lacks empirical support, recourse to injunctive relief after making a FRAND commitment has alternatively been characterized as a breach of contract as well as abuse of dominance. Nonetheless, some scholars continue to posit that patent law norms are alone sufficient to police the anticompetitive impacts potentially associated with seeking and enforcing injunctions in the standard essential patent context. Seeking and enforcing injunctions after making a FRAND commitment has recently been characterized as abuse of dominance under Article 102 TFEU by the European Commission in two landmark cases regarding the exclusionary behavior of Samsung and Motorola. Extending arguments introduced in the so-called “refusal to license” case law and delineating the standard setting process and the existence of a FRAND commitment as exceptional circumstances, the Commission stated that SEP-holders may not seek injunctive relief if the prospective licensee is willing to enter into a licensing agreement on FRAND terms. The Commission’s test is, however, highly subjective and thus likely to generate more legal uncertainty than it is to resolve the FRAND debate. Seeking and enforcing injunctions in the SEP context has also been characterized as a breach of contract law, although the application of contract law norms is problematic {{due to a lack of}} common understanding of either the meaning or contractual nature of FRAND commitments. Specifically, FRAND commitments have alternatively been described as binding contracts on behalf of third-party beneficiaries, promises to license, and mere agreements to negotiate. Focusing on FRAND commitments made to ETSI, this research indicates strong support for considering FRAND commitments binding contracts with all <b>prospective</b> standards-implementers third-party <b>beneficiaries</b> thereof. Even though recent EU-level decisions regarding seeking and enforcing injunctions ex-post making a FRAND commitment have provided some clarity to the legal framework surrounding standard essential patents and FRAND licensing, the determination of a FRAND royalty rate in itself remains highly debated and uncertain. Failure to adequately reflect the value of a patent when courts set FRAND royalties may discourage either essential patent holders or prospective licensees from participating in standards- setting. Accordingly, distinguishing appropriate measures for determining FRAND royalties should represent a core focus area for both academia and courts alike. Although the excessive pricing test established in United Brands represents an upper boundary for FRAND royalties, the test alone is insufficient and overtly strict. Absent EU-level case law regarding FRAND royalty setting, this study reviews recent United States case law in order to determine the key issues that distinguish rate determinations for FRAND- encumbered standard essential patents from non-essential patents. Matters of particular concern relate to distinguishing patent value from value created by a standard, the risk of royalty stacking, and the identification of an appropriate royalty base. Although some, albeit limited, progress has recently been made with regard to addressing the availability of injunctive relief in the standard essential patent context, the FRAND debate remains far from resolved. Until the CJEU renders a decision in the matter, the use of the competition law defense against essential patent holders’ recourse to injunctive relief will remain somewhat uncertain in the European Union. Nevertheless, establishing guidelines for determining FRAND royalties should be a key priority, wherein practices already applied in the United States can be leveraged. In fact, in order to ensure a fair balance between the interests of standard essential patent holders and prospective standards-implementers and accordingly safeguard standards- setting in its current form, the main future questions pertain to the judicial determination of FRAND royalties and the empirical assessment of the risks of patent hold-up and reverse hold-up...|$|R
