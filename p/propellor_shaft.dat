25|$|In February 1946, Empire Abbey, {{en route}} to Europe laden with food, {{was hit by a}} storm off Newfoundland which lasted for over three weeks. On the 16th day of the storm, her <b>propellor</b> <b>shaft</b> broke off, leaving Empire Abbey {{drifting}} without propulsion. On the 24th day, the tug Foundation Franklin managed to take Empire Abbey in tow. A message was sent from Empire Abbey that the captain had died after thirteen days without sleep. In May 1946 she was sold to Royal Mail Line and renamed Teviot, the third Royal Mail Line ship to bear that name. In 1959, Teviot was laid up.|$|E
25|$|In December 1855 Lyons went to Marseilles {{to attend}} the peace conference for the Crimea, leaving his ship to sail to Malta. While in the Aegean Sea the gland {{surrounding}} the <b>propellor</b> <b>shaft</b> failed, allowing water to flood into the ship. The bilge pumps could not cope with the flow, but the ship was kept afloat by connecting the cooling water pumps used to condense steam in the engine to the bilge instead of open sea. After use the water was pumped overboard and provided the engine remained running the ship could be kept clear of water. The ship was near the island of Zea, so Captain Mends circled the island through the night until with daylight {{he was able to}} beach the ship on a sandy bay. The engines then had to be kept working for four days while a dam was built around the ship to keep out the water and allow repairs to be made. Mends chose Tryon to go to Piraeus to summon help rather than a more senior officer because of his 'marked intelligence'.|$|E

50|$|This old-established {{business}} was bought in 1934. Laycock's made railway carriage and steamship fittings, underframes for locomotives and railway coaches and in 1934 also makes automobile axles, gearboxes, <b>propellor</b> <b>shafts</b> and Laycock's own Layrub flexible drive joints. Two years later Laycock Engineering {{was sold to}} some investors.|$|R
5000|$|Novokramatorsky Mashynobudivny Zavod (Новокраматорський машинобудівний завод) {{is a large}} heavy {{equipment}} manufacturer in Ukraine. Its abbreviation is NKMZ. The company produces mining equipment; metallurgy equipment; rolling mills, forges, blast furnaces, ore crushers, presses, and other industrial process equipment. The company manufactures <b>propellor</b> <b>shafts</b> for icebreakers and components for submarines According to its website, the company has designed and constructed over 18 mining complexes.http://www.nkmz.com/English/index.html ...|$|R
50|$|Mahamiru class ships vary {{in design}} from the Lerici class. Most {{significant}} {{of these is}} that Mahamirus are equipped with two diesel engines with dedicated <b>propellor</b> <b>shafts</b> instead of a single engine and propellor, giving them a maximum speed of 16 kn and a minehunting speed of 7 kn. The Malaysian ships are also equipped with Thomson Sintra TSM 2022 sonar, Thomson-CSF radar, and two PAP-104 remote-operated submersibles, and are 1 m longer than the Italian vessels they were based on. Instead of the 20 mm Oerlikon, the ships are armed with a single Bofors 40 mm L/70 gun. The standard crew complement is 42, 5 of whom are officers.|$|R
2500|$|The {{remains of}} Hilda lie at [...] in [...] {{of water at}} high tide. The engines, boilers, <b>propellor</b> <b>shaft</b> and some {{ironwork}} remain. The propellor was removed in 1997 and is on display in Dinard. In November 2005, an exhibition was held in St Malo commemorating the 100th anniversary of the shipwreck. On 19 November, flowers were cast upon the water at the wreck site {{in memory of the}} victims, and some divers placed a string of onions on the wreck in memory of the Onion Johnnies. A memorial service was held in St Malo Cathedral on 20 November.|$|E
5000|$|... a {{torque tube}} {{encasing}} the <b>propellor</b> <b>shaft</b> so articulated {{that it can}} move freely with lateral movement of the back axle.|$|E
50|$|The clutch and {{flywheel}} {{are mounted}} {{on the back of}} the engine block This part of the clutch is of aluminium and carries a friction surface of leather To make for a more gradual engagement a steel spring is set between the leather and the metal face. It is formed into a ring with projecting tongues which ac t as springs. The large spiral spring to hold the clutch in engagement is stationary. It acts on the fork imparting a sliding motion to the <b>propellor</b> <b>shaft.</b> A ball bearing takes the thrust between fork and the shaft. A long <b>propellor</b> <b>shaft</b> runs from the clutch to the gearbox's first motion shaft. This <b>propellor</b> <b>shaft</b> carries a flexible coupling and is splined to allow longitudinal movement together with the clutch. The gearbox is mounted between the back axle and the sprocket shaft for the chain drive.|$|E
50|$|Fittleton {{was caught}} in a low {{pressure}} area that exists near to the hull of a ship under way and was drawn close to the frigate HMS Mermaid by hydrodynamic forces. A minor collision ensued and the Fittleton moved forward to try and exit the situation but instead was hit amidships by the bow of the much the Mermaid and turned over within a minute. Thirty-two survivors were picked from the sea and the upturned hull by the accompanying ships, and German and Dutch vessels joined Royal Navy ships in searching for survivors, with divers entering the floating upturned hull. Attempts to keep Fittleton afloat by passing minesweeping cables underneath her <b>propellor</b> <b>shafts</b> failed when the lines parted. The ship sank several hours later, between 9 and 10 pm, in 160 ft of water.|$|R
40|$|Dr. Beth Tonoany is a {{tropical}} population ecologist {{who has been}} studying an unusual tree, Guaiacum sanctum, which once grew throughout the dry tropical forests of Central America {{as well as on}} some of the Caribbean islands. Guaiacum sanctum produces a wood called lignum vitae, and is known in Costa Rica and other Spanish-speaking countries as guayacan reál. The wood is extremely heavy because it contains extensive deposits of resin (Howes, 1949) and it will sink if placed in water (Wilson and Eisner, 1968). During World War I and II it was extensively harvested for use in the ship-building industry because the wood, which does not split easily, is selflubricating due to its high resin content. The wood is very durable, and was in high demand for constructing bearing sleeves to support ship <b>propellor</b> <b>shafts</b> (Scurlock, 1987). It has also been used for making railroad tie...|$|R
50|$|While Whitney {{bought and}} sold {{a wide range of}} {{different}} model engines, they increasingly developed their own line of model steam engines, particularly for model marine use, and also small steam powered water pumps, and steam boilers. These fairly distinctive models are invariably maroon in colour and comprise a large amount of brass or bronze castings in preference to cast iron. They all bore a small oval badge stating Whitney City Road London, and it seems likely they were sold as complete items rather than as sets of castings. There were at least two steam engines designed to drive two contra-rotating <b>propellor</b> <b>shafts,</b> using two crankshafts geared together. One used two vertical slide valve cylinders arranged as a twin cylinder compound engine, and another was a twin cylinder single acting unit with a layout similar to the Stuart Turner No.2 MTB engine, though all in brass/bronze.|$|R
50|$|The {{transmission}} {{consists of}} the Daimler fluid flywheel and its Wilson self-changing pre-selective, four-speed gearbox. An open <b>propellor</b> <b>shaft</b> takes the power to an underslung, worm-driven back axle.|$|E
5000|$|The Restigouches were by {{powered by}} two English Electric geared steam turbines, each driving a <b>propellor</b> <b>shaft,</b> using steam {{provided}} by two Babcock & Wilcox boilers. They generated [...] giving the vessels a maximum speed of 28 kn.|$|E
50|$|Laycock's initial {{business}} was {{the manufacture of}} railway carriage and steamship fittings and underframe gear for railway coaches and locomotives. The range was extended to include axles, gearboxes, and motor chassis components, motorcar propellor shafts and the Layrub rubber bushed <b>propellor</b> <b>shaft.</b>|$|E
50|$|A {{range of}} three speed {{gearboxes}} and worm-driven back axles with <b>propellor</b> <b>shaft</b> and torque mechanism and transmission brakes and front axles with steering gear.In 1906 Wrigley's showed a complete car gearbox at that year's Olympia Show and were manufacturing front and live-rear axles.|$|E
50|$|Steering {{which was}} by cam and lever now by worm and nut. The <b>propellor</b> <b>shaft</b> is now {{provided}} with needle-roller bearings. There is a stabilising front bumper. Four-wheel brakes are now mechanical by Girling. Maximum speed was reported as having {{moved up to}} 65 mph.|$|E
50|$|Bombs had {{damaged the}} Antonios rudder and the {{stanchions}} supporting her <b>propellor</b> <b>shaft.</b> She had {{to reduce speed}} and did not reach anchorage in Portland Harbour until about 2300 hrs. The continuing air raid prevented her from landing the survivors she had rescued until mid-day on 5 July.|$|E
50|$|From the 1950s, {{manufacturers}} of outboard motors had {{settled on the}} use of the basic inline engine design, cylinders stacked on top of each other with the crankshaft driving the <b>propellor</b> <b>shaft.</b> An experimental engine used two inline engine blocks joined in order to make a square-four engine.|$|E
50|$|Austin further {{modified}} the chassis in 1933 adding syncromesh between third and top gears (these cars are called TT or Twin Top) and replacing the joints {{at the front}} of the <b>propellor</b> <b>shaft</b> with Hardy Spicer couplings. In addition the transmission brake was removed—the parking brake now operated on the back wheels.|$|E
5000|$|... {{the brake}} drum {{is on the}} <b>propellor</b> <b>shaft</b> behind the {{universal}} joint, the drums and operating mechanism mounted on the forward end of the torque tube. The advantage is that the gear shaft and the front universal joint do not take the braking stresses. (By this time most manufacturers regarded transmission brakes obsolete) ...|$|E
50|$|The new cab {{was once}} again {{designed}} by William Overton of Mann & Overton Limited in collaboration with Austin. Austin had redesigned the back axle relocating the <b>propellor</b> <b>shaft</b> and together with height saved by the new dropped cross-braced frame something like 7 inches {{was able to be}} removed from the car's overall height.|$|E
50|$|The first vehicle {{proved to}} be a success, and in ealy 1935, they {{introduced}} the MW model, for a 15 cwt payload. The centrally-mounted GEC traction motor drove the rear wheels through a <b>propellor</b> <b>shaft</b> and a Moss overhead-worm type axle. The 60 volt, 192 Amp-hour Exide Ironclad batteries provided a range of 35 to 40 mi.|$|E
50|$|The right pedal applies iron-lined {{external}} bands on {{the rear}} brake drums through levers and horizontal shafts. The left pedal first releases the clutch then when moved further the same pedal to ease the gear change applies the brake on the <b>propellor</b> <b>shaft</b> drum behind the gearbox. Steering is by rack and pinion. Wheels are of steel wire with tangent spokes.|$|E
50|$|For 1923 {{with the}} OE engine the {{straight}} cut back axle gear {{was replaced by}} a spiral bevel with a higher 3.3:1 reduction ratio. The chassis and wheelbase were lengthened four inches and the chassis was also strengthened by widening the cross-section of the side rails. The body was widened three inches. Rear axle torque was now taken through a banjo-shaped torque arm alongside the <b>propellor</b> <b>shaft.</b>|$|E
50|$|Clutch and gearbox are bolted {{firmly to}} the engine block, gears are changed by a lever beside the driver's right hand {{operating}} in a gate. The clutch is not fully enclosed. Drive is carried to the rear axle by an enclosed <b>propellor</b> <b>shaft.</b> Spherical and universal joints are automatically oiled, there is a central bearing in the torque tube. Final drive is by spiral bevel and the axle is of the half-floating design.|$|E
50|$|By 1943, Partridge Wilson were {{producing}} {{vehicles with}} payloads of 7/10 cwt, 15 cwt, 18/25 cwt, and 40 cwt. The first three {{were aimed at}} the retail delivery market, and so were mainly supplied as bread vans and milk floats, while the 40 cwt model {{was designed as a}} lorry. All models were fitted with series traction motors and Bendix brakes. The 7/10 cwt model included a drum-type controller, with a constant delay between the stages. The larger vehicles used a fluid foot controller to regulate the speed of the vehicle. By this time they were using starting resistances, which were switched out of circuit as a camshaft on the controller rotated. Power was transmitted to the rear axle through a <b>propellor</b> <b>shaft</b> with Hardy-Spicer flexible couplings and a spiral bevel gear. On the larger models, the <b>propellor</b> <b>shaft</b> had Hardy-Spicer needle-roller joints, and was connected to an overslung worm drive on the rear axle. There was also a 30 cwt lorry with a tipping body available, although Hills in his summary of electric vehicles gives no further details, and the Wilson-Scammell electric horse was still in production.|$|E
50|$|The chassis {{was entirely}} new. The metal to metal multi-plate clutch {{requires}} no lubrication. Two plates are phosphor bronze, {{the others are}} steel. There is a double universal joint (a sliding block allows for withdrawal of the clutch) between the clutch and the gearbox. The gearbox is mounted on a separate underframe, all its shafts run on ball bearings. There are three forward speeds. The <b>propellor</b> <b>shaft</b> is fully enclosed and has a ball and fork joint at its forward end. Final drive is by overhead worm.|$|E
50|$|The {{single plate}} dry clutch has a central {{external}} spring and roller spigot bearing. The gears are changed by a central lever {{working in an}} invisible gate. There is a brake lever just {{to the left of}} the gear lever operating a band transmission brake mounted directly behind the gearbox. The band may be adjusted by a threaded rod. Drive is taken by an open <b>propellor</b> <b>shaft</b> coupled by triple Hardy disc joints to the half-floating spiral-bevel driven rear axle which has a banjo case.|$|E
50|$|In {{rear-wheel drive}} cars and trucks, the engine turns a {{driveshaft}} (also called a <b>propellor</b> <b>shaft</b> or tailshaft) which transmits rotational force to a drive axle {{at the rear}} of the vehicle. The drive axle may be a live axle, but modern rear wheel drive automobiles generally use a split axle with a differential. In this case, one half-axle or half-shaft connects the differential with the left rear wheel, a second half-shaft does the same with the right rear wheel; thus the two half-axles and the differential constitute the rear axle.|$|E
50|$|Belgic was a steel hulled ship {{divided by}} {{watertight}} bulkheads into 8 separate compartments. In {{addition to her}} engines she had four masts with the first pair being square rigged. Her main propulsion was provided by two double cylindered engines of 400 NHP, also built by Messrs. Harland and Wolff, the steam for which was supplied from three coal-fired elliptical boilers, working at a pressure of 90 psi. In the event of one engine failing it could be disconnected from the <b>propellor</b> <b>shaft</b> enabling the vessel to continue at reduced power. She carried eight lifeboats {{as well as two}} life rafts.|$|E
50|$|The car was {{supplied}} with an {{adjustable steering column}} and body insulation. It comfortably carried four passengers with room for a small fifth passenger in {{the centre of the}} back seat. Even the quarter-lights were {{supplied with}} blinds, there were flush fitting footrests {{in the back of the}} large, adjustable, front seats with pull straps above. The back floor was flat except for the somewhat pronounced <b>propellor</b> <b>shaft</b> tunnel. The boot was provided with a fitted suitcase, the spare wheel sitting horizontally in the space below. The door could be let down and used as a luggage platform.|$|E
5000|$|The {{remains of}} Hilda lie at [...] in 25 m {{of water at}} high tide. The engines, boilers, <b>propellor</b> <b>shaft</b> and some {{ironwork}} remain. The propellor was removed in 1997 and is on display in Dinard. In November 2005, an exhibition was held in St Malo commemorating the 100th anniversary of the shipwreck. On 19 November, flowers were cast upon the water at the wreck site {{in memory of the}} victims, and some divers placed a string of onions on the wreck in memory of the Onion Johnnies.

50|$|In February 1946, Empire Abbey, {{en route}} to Europe laden with food, {{was hit by a}} storm off Newfoundland which lasted for over three weeks. On the 16th day of the storm, her <b>propellor</b> <b>shaft</b> broke off, leaving Empire Abbey {{drifting}} without propulsion. On the 24th day, the tug Foundation Franklin managed to take Empire Abbey in tow. A message was sent from Empire Abbey that the captain had died after thirteen days without sleep. In May 1946 she was sold to Royal Mail Line and renamed Teviot, the third Royal Mail Line ship to bear that name. In 1959, Teviot was laid up.|$|E
50|$|During 1928 the Rootes {{brothers}} obtained {{control of}} Hillman.A new deeper radiator appeared in early September 1928 with larger headlamps on a cross-bar between the wings. The wider bodies had been lowered three inches without reducing ground clearance or head clearance. The body range was rationalised {{to a standard}} saloon, fabric saloon, Segrave coupé, tourer and Huski (sic) fabric-bodied sports tourer. There were major changes to a strengthened chassis {{and an increase in}} the track of the home market cars from 52 in to 56 in. Other upgrades included a stronger Hardy-Spicer <b>propellor</b> <b>shaft</b> with metal joints, more powerful brakes and shock absorbers all round. An oil pressure gauge was added to the dashboard.|$|E
50|$|Ark Royal {{participated in}} many {{exercises}} {{as part of}} the British fleet and NATO (North Atlantic Treaty Organization) squadrons, but saw no combat duty. She was not involved in the Suez Crisis in Egypt of 1956, about a year after her commissioning, because {{she was on her way}} there when she ran a main <b>propellor</b> <b>shaft</b> bearing and had to return to Devonport for a major refit. Eagle replaced her at Suez. In 1963, she carried out trials for a new type of Vertical/Short Take Off and Landing (V/STOL) aircraft, the Hawker P.1127, which later developed into the Hawker Siddeley Harrier. The same aircraft, now having been redesigned and developed as the British Aerospace Sea Harrier, was later accepted as the primary strike capability of the future third and last Ark Royal from 1980 onwards.|$|E
