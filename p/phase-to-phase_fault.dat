50|$|As {{an example}} of the energy {{released}} in an arc flash incident, in a single <b>phase-to-phase</b> <b>fault</b> on a 480 V system with 20,000 amps of fault current, the resulting power is 9.6 MW. If the fault lasts for 10 cycles at 60 Hz, the resulting energy would be 1.6 megajoules. For comparison, TNT releases 2175 J/g or more when detonated (a conventional value of 4,184 J/g is used for TNT equivalent). Thus, this fault energy is equivalent to 380 grams (approximately 0.8 pounds) of TNT. The character of an arc flash blast is quite different from a chemical explosion (more heat and light, less mechanical shock), but the resulting devastation is comparable. The rapidly expanding superheated vapor produced by the arc can cause serious injury or damage, and the intense UV, visible, and IR light produced by the arc can temporarily and sometimes even permanently blind or cause eye damage to people.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—The paper {{presents}} a procedure for fault location in distribution networks, {{based on the}} use of the integrated time-frequency wavelet decompositions of the voltage transients associated with the fault-originated travelling waves. The proposed analysis of time-frequency wavelet decompositions has been found to improve the identification accuracy of the frequencies associated to the characteristic patterns of a fault location with respect to a sole frequency-domain wavelet analysis. Several laboratory fault tests, carried out by means of a reduced-scale model of a distribution feeder, are used to illustrate the characteristics and assess the performances of the proposed improved procedure.

When some single phase-to-ground fault occurs, the parameter identification formula of zero-mode component is built; when some <b>phase-to-phase</b> <b>fault</b> occurs, the parameter identification formula of line-mode component is built. The current of the shunt reactor is given and the inductance of the shunt reactor is taken as the unknown parameter to evaluate the difference between the calculated inductance and the actual one so as to distinguish permanent fault from transient fault. The inductance difference of the temporary fault is minute because the actual fault model is consistent with the prototype. But the inductance difference of the permanent fault is distinct because the actual fault model is inconsistent with the prototype.

To create SPT condition a-g fault is created at certain distance in line- 1 and 2. Fault is initiated at 0.3 s and cleared at 0.4 s by opening breaker B 3 and B 4 simultaneously. With single-pole operation further fault in the line causes transient at the secondary side of CCVT. To test the performance of proposed method for transient period during single-pole tripping, different fault cases are simulated using EMTDC/PSCAD.

Its safe, steady, economical and reliable operating plays a very important part in guaranteeing socioeconomic development, and even in safeguarding social stability. The complexity of electric power system is determined by its characteristics about constitution, configuration, operation, organization, etc. No matter if, we adopt new analytical methods or technical means, we must have a distinct recognition of electric power system itself and its complexity, and increase analysis continuously, operation and control level. In this paper, utilizing real-time measurements of phasor measurement unit, based on graph theory and multivariate statistical analysis theory, we are using mainly Breadth-first search, Depth-first search and cluster analysis. Then, we seek for the uniform laws of marked changes of electrical quantities. Then we can carry out fast and exact analysis of fault component. Finally, we can accomplish fault isolation. According to line fault and bus-bar fault (single-phase fault, <b>phase-to-phase</b> <b>fault</b> and three-phase fault) in complex electric power systems, we have carried out a great deal of simulation experiments and obtained ideal results.

Two different one-ended fault location algorithms are also implemented for handling two-phase faults and three-phase faults on the laterals of the faulty section respectively.

40|$|A motor {{is said to}} be {{reliable}} if it can run at its rated operating condition for a specified period of time. With the widespread use of electric motors in newer applications, reliability is a major concern in terms of safety as well as revenue. About 30 - 40 % of reported failures in induction motors are due to stator faults. It is well known that a stator fault starts as an inter-turn fault within a phase and then propagates into phase-to-phase and phase-to-ground faults that can then lead to complete shutdown of the motor. Two approaches have been taken in this dissertation to make an induction motor drive system more tolerant to stator faults; integration of an inter-turn fault detection method into a five-phase induction motor drive and design of fault-tolerant induction motors. The phase redundancy of five-phase motors makes it possible to achieve continued operation of the motor with an open phase. However, for true fault tolerance the drive must be able to detect an incipient fault and then transition to post fault operation. A low-cost diagnostic method based on DC voltage injection has been developed for detection of inter-turn faults in five-phase induction motor drive systems. It has been shown that difference in DC current response to an injected voltage before and after an inter-turn fault serves as a reliable fault indicator. The diagnostic is non-intrusive, requires no additional hardware and effectively integrates both fault detection and fault-tolerant control into the motor controller. The method has been successfully implemented and tested on low-cost microcontroller. The propagation of a stator inter-turn fault into a <b>phase-to-phase</b> <b>fault</b> is worsened in distributed winding induction motors where the different phase windings overlap each other at the end connections. Tooth wound or fractional slot concentrated winding (FSCW) stators have non-overlapping end connections and hence more physical and thermal isolation between the phases as compared to distributed winding stators. While FSCW configurations have been widely used for permanent magnet motors, their adoption for induction motors is a challenge. An FSCW configuration has been designed for outer rotor induction motors by using a dual slot layer stator structure and multilayer windings. Comparison with a conventional induction motor shows an 11 % reduction in the copper usage in addition to having non-overlapping phase windings...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{describes}} {{an investigation into}} the influences of arcing and conductor deflection due to magnetic forces on the accuracy of fault locator algorithms in electrical distribution networks. The work also explores the possibilities of using the properties of an arc to identify two specific types of faults that may occur on an overhead distribution line. A new technique using the convolution operator is introduced for deriving differential equation algorithms. The first algorithm was derived by estimating the voltage as an array of impulse functions while the second algorithm was derived using a piecewise linear voltage signal. These algorithms were tested on a simulated single-phase circuit using a PI-model line. It was shown that the second algorithm gave identical results as the existing dynamic integration operator type algorithm. The first algorithm used a transformation to a three-phase circuit that did not require any matrix calculations as an equivalent sequence component circuit is utilised for a single-phase to ground fault. A simulated arc was used to test the influence of the non-linearity of an arc on the accuracy of this algorithm. The simulations showed that the variation in the resistance due to arcing causes large oscillations of the algorithm output and a 40 th order mean filter was used to increase the accuracy and stability of the algorithm. The same tests were performed on a previously developed fault locator algorithm that includes a square-wave power frequency proximation of the fault arc. This algorithm gave more accurate and stable results even with large arc length variations. During <b>phase-to-phase</b> <b>fault</b> conditions, two opposing magnetic fields force the conductors outwards away from each other and this movement causes a change in the total inductance of the line. A three dimensional finite element line model based on standard wave equations but incorporating magnetic forces was used to evaluate this phenomenon. The results show that appreciable errors in the distance estimations can be expected especially on poorly tensioned di stribution lines. New techniques were also explored that are based on identification of the fault arc. Two methods were successfully tested on simulated networks to identify a breakingconductor. The methods are based on the rate of increase in arc length during the breaking of the conductor. The first method uses arc voltage increase as the basis of the detection while the second method make use of the increase in the non-linearity of the network resistance to identify a breaking conductor. An unsuccessful attempt was made to identifying conductor clashing caused by high winds: it was found that too many parameters influence the separation speed of the two conductors. No unique characteristic could be found to identify the conductor clashing using the speed of conductor separation. The existing algorithm was also used to estimate the voltage in a distribution network during a fault for power quality monitoring purposes...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this thesis was to {{investigate}} what type of faults in the connecting grid should be dimensioning for future wind farms. An investigation of over and under voltages at the main transformer and the turbines inside Lillgrund wind farm was the main goal. The results {{will be used in}} the planning stage of future wind farms when performing insulation coordination and determining the protection settings. A model of the Lillgrund wind farm and a part of the connecting 130 kV grid were built in PSCAD/EMTDC. The farm consists of 48 Siemens SWT- 2. 3 - 93 2. 3 MW wind turbines with full power converters. The turbines were modeled as controllable current sources providing a constant active power output up to the current limit of 1. 4 pu. The transmission lines and cables were modeled as frequency dependent (phase) models. The load flows and bus voltages were verified towards a PSS/E model and the transient response was verifed towards measuring data from two faults, a line to line fault in the vicinity of Barsebäck (BBK) and a single line-to-ground fault close to Bunkeflo(BFO) substation. For the simulation, three phase to ground, single line to ground and line to line faults were applied at different locations in the connecting grid and the phase to ground voltages at different buses in the connecting grid and at turbines were studied. These faults were applied for different cofigurations of the farm. For single line to ground faults, the highest over voltage on a turbine was 1. 22 pu (32. 87 kV) due to clearing of a fault at BFO (the PCC). For line to line faults, the highest over voltage on a turbine was 1. 59 pu (42. 83 kV) {{at the beginning of a}} fault at KGE one bus away from BFO. Both these cases were when all radials were connected and the turbines ran at full power. The highest over voltage observed at Lillgrund was 1. 65 pu (44. 45 kV). This over voltage was caused by a three phase to ground fault applied at KGE and occurred at the beginning of the fault and when all radials were connected and the turbines ran in idle operation. For all simulated configurations, the highest over voltage occurred at the turbine located at the end of the longest radial. The highest over voltages on the main transformer were 1. 56 pu (42. 03 kV) on the low voltage side and caused by a three-phase fault at KGE and 1. 17 pu (131. 9 kV) on the high voltage side from a <b>phase-to-phase</b> <b>fault</b> at BFO. The most severe voltage dip occurred on turbine E- 02 with 0. 014 pu (0. 38 kV) remaining voltage and was caused by a three phase to ground fault at BFO. This occurred when only that radial was connected. The amount of power generated and radials connected affected the maximum over and under voltage levels. Lower power generation resulted in higher over voltages and more severe voltage dips at the turbines. Fewer radials resulted in lower over voltages and less severe voltage dips...|$|E

40|$|The {{significance}} of load modeling for voltage stability studies has been emphasized by several disturbances, which {{have taken place}} in the past years. They have shown that the loads in combination with other dynamics are among the main contributors of prolonged low voltage conditions, voltage instability and collapse in the power system. As a result of these disturbances new investigations have come up to better understand the nature of the load. However, power system loads keep being very difficult to model; the load generally aggregates a large number of individual components of different nature, different load dynamics are excited depending on the time frame of actuation and the type of disturbance affecting the system, and the load is highly dependent on external factors such as weather conditions. This thesis investigates the load-voltage characteristic during two different time scales, long-term over several minutes, and short-term covering ms to several seconds, for different sized disturbances, {{and its impact on the}} calculation of transfer limits and security margins in voltage stability studies. The accurate determination of transfer limits will be an increasingly important task to maintain the operational security and economic dispatch of the power system. The location of the stability limits and the determination of transfer limits depend on the load-voltage characteristic since load relief due to the load-voltage dependency results in larger transfer limits. Moreover, the importance of using dynamic load models instead of static ones in stability studies is highlighted in this thesis. Due to the large amount of electrical heating loads in Sweden and its effect on voltage stability, a dynamic load model with exponential recovery, previously proposed by Hill and Karlsson, [Karlsson and Hill, 1994], has been the starting point for the investigations. Field measurements from continuous normal operation at the 20 kV-level from a substation in Sweden have provided a large amount of data covering all seasons during the time period July 2001 -June 2002, and have resulted in extensive, unique and interesting recordings of active and reactive load characteristic and its dependency with small voltage variations. The data have revealed the variation of the load parameters and their dependency with weather and season of the year. The work has also contributed to a better approach for the normalization of traditional reactive load models. Furthermore the load-voltage characteristic during large disturbances has been investigated based on field measurements of <b>phase-to-phase</b> <b>faults</b> in a non-effectively earthed 50 kV system in Sweden. Three-phase currents and voltages have been used to estimate the active and reactive power. The recordings exhibited voltage dips up to 30 % in the positive sequence voltage. The severity of the disturbances accentuates the nonlinear behavior of the load; the active and reactive power rapidly increase after fault clearing to levels even above the pre-disturbance value due to the re-acceleration of motors. The full recovery of the voltage is delayed due to the re-connection of tripped load. Moreover, it is shown that traditional load models do not accurately reflect the load behavior during these disturbances, for voltage dips around 12 % or larger due to the nonlinearities. An alternative load model, which represents the nonlinearities, has been tested. The superior behavior is demonstrated with the field measurements. Finally, some guidelines for industry to better account for the load in future stability studies have been included as a corollary of this thesis...|$|R

This paper aims to demonstrate the effects of static synchronous series compensator (SSSC) and series capacitive compensation (SCC), as two important series compensators, on the distance protection using theoretical and computational methods. The results of the investigation are used to develop a feasible and adequate method for eliminating the negative effects of these devices on the distance relays. The developed method measures the voltages at terminals of the SSSC and SCC by phasor measurement units (PMUs) which are then transmitted to the relay location by communication channels. The transmitted signals are used to modify the voltage measured by the relay. Different operation types and conditions of SSSC and SCC, and different <b>faults</b> such as <b>phase-to-phase</b> and phase-to-ground <b>faults</b> are investigated in simulations.
