2500|$|The double Wheel of Steel {{was invented}} by Wallenda and Nock. The two had grown up {{together}} in Sarasota and had talked about teaming up for years before {{coming up with the}} double Wheel concept, drawing up the initial plans on a tablecloth during dinner in 2005. They then spent nine months building the device in Nock's backyard workshop, and a further four months testing it and designing a performance. The greatest challenge was {{to find a way to}} split the wheels while they were still spinning. [...] "There were a lot of back-to-the-drawing-board moments", Wallenda later recalled. Ultimately, the problem was solved via a system of piston-like <b>pneumatic</b> <b>cylinders.</b> Wallenda's uncle, Timothy Stephenson, who is an engineer for the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), suggested that an axle be built of custom-blended, hardened steel alloy to keep it from breaking. In the end, the device cost more than $100,000 to produce.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. The {{purpose of}} the study is to measure the maximum static {{friction}} and dynamic friction in the actuation process of <b>pneumatic</b> <b>cylinder</b> after TiO 2 nanoparticles are added to grease. The study makes an innovative design of a new measuring equipment of friction force, which can measure the friction force between the piston seal in <b>pneumatic</b> <b>cylinder</b> and the cylinder bore. The friction force of <b>pneumatic</b> <b>cylinder</b> bore directly affects the output dynamic property of <b>pneumatic</b> <b>cylinder</b> motion. Friction force measuring system can measure the change of friction force of <b>pneumatic</b> <b>cylinder</b> bore under the condition with different operating speeds, and can analyze the relationship between friction force of <b>pneumatic</b> <b>cylinder</b> and output dynamic property of <b>pneumatic</b> <b>cylinder.</b> Such a friction force measuring equipment takes <b>pneumatic</b> <b>cylinder</b> as an output of motive force to drive the measurement of <b>pneumatic</b> <b>cylinder,</b> and uses load cell and draw-line encoder to measure the friction force of <b>pneumatic</b> <b>cylinder</b> bore and the motion speed. In the experiment, the friction forces of <b>pneumatic</b> <b>cylinder</b> given with oil and without oil are measured respectively, achieving the friction force property of <b>pneumatic</b> <b>cylinder</b> bore when being lubricated by nanogrease added with nanoparticles of different weight percentages (wt. %). The experimental results show that adding TiO 2 nanoparticles to grease can effectively decrease the friction force produced in the actuation process of <b>pneumatic</b> <b>cylinder...</b>|$|R

40|$|<b>Pneumatic</b> <b>cylinder</b> is a {{well-known}} device because of its high power to weight ratio, easy use, and environmental safety. <b>Pneumatic</b> <b>cylinder</b> uses air as its power source and converts it to a possible movement such as linear and rotary movement.

40|$|Abstract: Two {{types of}} rescue {{inspectors}} {{are presented in}} order to enhance accessibility of disastrous sites.

40|$|A {{compressibility}} of the actuating fluid of a {{pneumatic drive}} (compressed air) leads to significant landing of the <b>pneumatic</b> <b>cylinder</b> piston {{at the time}} of stop and hold of the load, a constant component of which can fluctuate significantly for the holding period. There are a lot of factors, which {{have a significant impact on}} the landing value of piston. Those are: an initial position of the piston at its stop, which determines the volume of the an active area of the piston, a value of the constant load component {{at the time of}} stop and its variation for the holding period, a transfer coefficient of the position component of the load, an active area of the <b>pneumatic</b> <b>cylinder</b> piston, as well as reduction in atmospheric pressure, which can significantly affect the operation of the control systems of small aircrafts flying at high altitudes. To reduce the landing value of piston due to changing value of the constant load component for its holding period, it is proposed to use a hydraulic positioner, which comprises a hydraulic cylinder the rod of which is rigidly connected to the rod of the <b>pneumatic</b> <b>cylinder</b> through the traverse, a cross-feed valve of the hydro-cylinder cavities with discrete electro-magnetic control, and adjustable chokes. A programmable logic controller provides the hydraulic positioner control. At the moment the piston stops and the load is held the cross-feed valve overlaps the hydro-cylinder cavities thereby locking the <b>pneumatic</b> <b>cylinder</b> piston and preventing its landing. With available pneumatic cylinder-controlled signal the cross-feed valve connects the piston and rod cavities of the positioner hydro-cylinder, the <b>pneumatic</b> <b>cylinder</b> piston is released and becomes capable of moving. A numerical estimate of landing of the <b>pneumatic</b> <b>cylinder</b> piston and its positioning quality is of essential interest. For this purpose, a technique to calculate the landing of piston has been developed taking into consideration that different factors, which determine operation conditions of the <b>pneumatic</b> <b>cylinder,</b> have the impact on it. Experimental investigation of piston landing was conducted using the <b>pneumatic</b> <b>cylinder</b> with piston and rod diameters of 32 and 16 mm, respectively, at operating pressure of 0. 8 MPa. With a vertical arrangement of the <b>pneumatic</b> <b>cylinder</b> axis, the control weights of a dead-weight pressure-gauge tester created a constant component of the load and its variation, and an indicator with resolution of 0. 05 mm estimated a landing value. The article shows the calculated data of piston landing, which are in good compliance with the experimental results. To substantially reduce the piston landing for the holding period of the load varying in value and sign was designed a hydraulic positioner of <b>pneumatic</b> <b>cylinder</b> piston, and its operation quality is studied on the physical layout of electro-pneumatic control system operating in the discrete and tracking modes. For control system service, work programs of the programmable logic controller integrated in the control circuit of the hydraulic positioner in discrete mode, and, as a digital discriminator, in tracking mode are developed. In conclusion as a result of the research activities the article estimates the impact of factors on the quality of the load position at the time of its hold and notes a high efficiency of the hydraulic positioner of <b>pneumatic</b> <b>cylinder</b> piston both in discrete mode and in tracking one. </p...|$|R
