Fabric formwork allows elegant designs to be realised but its use also presents some unique challenges, including the practical provision of transverse reinforcement in slender, non-prismatic beam elements. This paper details how these challenges have been overcome with the use of ultra-high performance fibre reinforced concrete. Methods for the design, optimisation and construction of such elements cast using fabric formwork are illustrated and structural tests data are presented...|$|E

The simple concept is {{exemplified}} to improve a 2 -node iso-beam (isoparametric beam) finite element of varying section. We first study the behavior of a standard 2 -node iso-beam finite element of <b>prismatic</b> <b>section,</b> which has been widely used with reduced integration (or the equivalent MITC method) in order to avoid shear locking. Based on analytical studies on cantilever beams of varying section, we propose the axial strain correction (ASC) scheme and the geometry-dependent tying (GDT) scheme for the 2 -node iso-beam element. We numerically analyze varying section beam problems and present the improved performance by using both ASC and GDT schemes...|$|E

40|$|One way to construct, from filled polygons, {{a hollow}} beam with {{polygonal}} cross section {{is to make}} <b>prismatic</b> <b>sections</b> from squares or rectangles and attach these back-to-back. In this paper, we explore an alternative way, based on folding a single strip of rhombuses into a discrete helix. By taking rhombuses with an appropriate aspect ratio, you can control the {{cross section of the}} resulting beam. Using a rhombus with an aspect ratio of v 2 : 1 yields a triangular beam. This rhombus {{turns out to be a}} particularly fruitful construction element (alas, discontinued by Polydron). Triangular beams of this kind can be connected at an angle, in various ways, without cutting rhombuses. The resulting joints are regular miter joints, or false miter joints. We provide a mathematical analysis and show some elegant shapes constructed from such triangular rhombus-based beams. One of these shapes is a doubly-linked octagon. Another shape is a trefoil knot, which can be linked into an interesting space-spanning structure known as triamond, and that led to the Bamboozle...|$|R

The paper proposes exact, general solutions to two novel classes of VG under practical loading conditions, a-VG of uniform section, where the chords and the verticals may be composed of two different <b>prismatic</b> <b>sections,</b> and b-VG of uniform strength, where the constituent elements are selected {{in such a way as}} to induce a state of equal stress for all members of the structure. It has been shown that the total weight of both classes of VG can be minimized by the proper selection of the relative strengths of the members of each system. The essence of the paper is based on a novel failure mechanism presented for the first time in this article.

40|$|Apatite fission-track thermochronology {{has been}} based upon {{measurements}} in prismatic sections. Until now, all annealing data sets referred {{to this kind of}} measurement. However, prismatic sections are not always available, e. g. for detrital apatite grains, making the work impossible. An alternative would be to use grains in any orientation. This requires that a suitable annealing model be employed, i. e. one obtained from measurements in grains without preferential orientation. in this work, the angular distribution of confined fission tracks parallel to the surfaces of grains randomly oriented relative to the crystallographic c-axis is obtained. This distribution shows that track at higher angles relative to c-axis, when compared with the <b>prismatic</b> <b>section</b> distribution, are found. the procedure measurements in randomly oriented sections is presented along with empirical model equations. Model parameters have been obtained for the most common empirical equations and the partial annealing zone has been calculated for these equations. Results are compared with geological benchmarks; the fanning linear Arrhenius model yields the best agreement. This empirical model and those most used in literature have been applied to samples from the Sao Francisco Craton, Brazil, to show an instance in which the effects of grain orientation is important. Thermal histories of geological samples have been obtained through these equations. the samples tested presented moderate annealing and experienced a relatively simple thermal history. Under these conditions, taking into account the uncertainties in the model equations and confined track measurements, and using compatible systems, the presented model equations and the most used prismatic face ones constrained the same thermal history feature.

40|$|For rarified {{gas flow}} in ducts or {{channels}} of <b>prismatic</b> cross <b>section</b> {{a minimum of}} the flow resistance, which is known since 1909, is observed for Knudsen-number ranging from 1 to 10. In the present study a closed relation for the flow resistance is proposed and physically justified. This relation should not be interpreted as an interpolation formula. The relation is applicable to any Knudsen-number and channels of arbitrary length. However, potential accommodation effects are not considered yet. Employing recent experimental data from the literature the model is verified {{for a wide range}} of parameters and new physical insight is gained with respect to the flow resistance of short channels and orifice plates when Knudsen-flow is approached. The present study allows for improved computations of channel flow in all vacuum technology applications.

40|$|In marine {{environments and}} where {{de-icing}} salts are applied, {{the degradation of}} reinforced concrete structures due to chloride induced corrosion of the reinforcement is a major problem. The expansive nature of the corrosion process results in cracking of the concrete and eventually spalling. In order to select suitable remedial measures {{it is necessary to}} make an assessment of the residual strength and the residual life. In order to investigate the effect of corrosion on bond strength of the reinforcement, specimens comprising square <b>prismatic</b> <b>sections</b> containing steel reinforcement in the four corners have been subjected to a wet-dry cycle and corrosion has been accelerated by polarising the bars. The research has studied the change of bond strength with level of corrosion for 12 mm and 16 mm bars with concrete cover of 1 and 3 times the bar size. The bond strength is assessed by means of pull out tests and the corresponding extent of corrosion has been assessed in terms of the mass loss. Observations and measurements of the form of the corrosion (pit dimensions and loss of bar diameter) are also presented. The relationship between bond strength and surface crack width has been investigated. Results show that the surface crack width may be a good indicator of residual bond strength. In addition, the influence on bond strength of concrete compressive strength, reinforcement cover, bar position and bar size on the change of bond strength has been explored. It should be noted that all conclusions drawn in this project are based on tests on specimens without shear reinforcement (unconfined) and that accelerated corrosion (by impressed current) has been adopted. Consequently, care should be exercised in applying these results directly to structures in the field. Additional research is needed to assess the influence of impressed current on crack patterns and the effect of shear reinforcement...|$|R
40|$|External Detector Method is {{a widely}} used {{technique}} in Fission Track Thermochronology, FTT, in which two different minerals are concomitantly employed: spontaneous tracks are observed in apatite and the induced ones in the external detector muscovite. They show intrinsic differences in detection and etching properties that {{should be taken into}} account. In this work, new geometry factor values, g, in apatite were obtained by ρED/ρIS ratio and GQR values through the measurement of projected lengths. Five mounts, two of which were large area <b>prismatic</b> <b>sections</b> (Mn- 1 and Mn- 2, Durango apatite) and three samples composed of random orientation pieces (D- 2 and D- 3, Durango apatite and TF- 42, from crystalline rock) have been used to determine the g-values. A side effect of applying EDM is that the value of the initial confined induced fission track, L 0, is not measured in routine analyses. The L 0 -value is an important parameter to quantify with good confidence the degree of annealing of the fossil fission tracks in the unknown age sample, being essential for accurate thermal history modeling. The impact of using arbitrary L 0 - values on the inference sample thermal history was investigated and discussed. The L 0 - value can be measured for each sample {{as an extension of the}} ρED/ρIS ratio method for measuring g, which consists in simultaneously irradiating pre-annealed apatite grains and the EDM mount of the same sample. The ratio between densities of induced tracks in the muscovite and in the extra apatite mount gives the value of g. L 0 is the mean length of the confined fission tracks measured in the extra apatite mount. Eight apatite samples from crystalline basement, with grains at random orientation, were used to determine the gvalues.

40|$|AbstractThe {{problem of}} {{determining}} the elastoplastic properties of a prismatic bar from the given experimental relation between the torsional moment M and the angle of twist per unit length of the rod’s length θ is investigated as an inverse problem. The proposed method to solve the inverse problem {{is based on the}} solution of some sequences of the direct problem by applying the Levenberg-Marquardt iteration method. In the direct problem, these properties are known, and the torsional moment is calculated {{as a function of the}} angle of twist from the solution of a non-linear boundary value problem. This non-linear problem results from the Saint-Venant displacement assumption, the Ramberg–Osgood constitutive equation, and the deformation theory of plasticity for the stress–strain relation. To solve the direct problem in each iteration step, the Kansa method is used for the circular cross section of the rod, or the method of fundamental solutions (MFS) and the method of particular solutions (MPS) are used for the <b>prismatic</b> cross <b>section</b> of the rod. The non-linear torsion problem in the plastic region is solved using the Picard iteration...|$|R

40|$|The shear {{strength}} of {{laminated veneer lumber}} (LVL) has traditionally been determined {{based on the results}} of small block shear tests conducted in accordance with ASTM D 143 [1]. In recent years, there has been a significant interest in determining the {{shear strength}} of engineered wood products using full-scale bending test methods [2, 3, 4, 5, 6] in lieu of small block shear tests. However, due primarily to different shear-to-bending strength ratios among a variety of engineered wood products, the use of a <b>prismatic</b> cross <b>section</b> and test setup similar to those adopted for full-scale shear tests of glulam [6] does not normally produce an acceptable shear failure rate in the edgewise or joist orientation (loads are applied parallel to gluelines), as required for LVL. Therefore, special considerations should be given to the test setup and specimen configuration for LVL edgewise shear tests. This paper describes the development of shear test methods for both LVL edgewise full-scale and small-scale tests. The full-scale test method can be used for product qualification of the LVL shear strength and the small-scale test method can be used as an in-plant quality assurance tool to monitor the LVL shear strength on an on-going basis. A noticeable size effect is discussed. The moisture effect on the full-scale LVL edgewise shear specimens is also presented. 1...|$|R
40|$|The main {{objective}} of this research analyses is to study the flow behavior of both prismatic and non-prismatic compound channels having converging floodplains of width ratio varies from 1. 8 to 1. 0 and main channel aspect ratio of more than 5. Experiments were conducted for these channels in the Fluid Mechanics and Hydraulics laboratory of National Institute of Technology, Rourkela, India by making smooth, rigid, straight and converging within a concrete flume. Micro-ADV, Preston tube, notch, pointer gauge, manometers and other hydraulic equipment {{have been used to}} measure 3 -d velocity, boundary shear stress, and water surface profile at different sections of the channels. The research investigates the modeling of water surface profile, distribution of longitudinal velocity, depth-averaged velocity, boundary shear stress and energy loss for overbank flow cases in both <b>prismatic</b> and non-prismatic <b>sections</b> of converging compound channels. As a complementary study to the experimental research, numerical hydrodynamic tools viz. ANSYS is applied to simulate the flow for both <b>prismatic</b> and non-prismatic <b>sections</b> of converging compound channels. All the important flow parameters are extracted numerically from the simulation results to study them vis a vis their observed values. As a prediction of flow variables in a non-prismatic converging compound channel is a much complex phenomenon, so an ANN has also been employed for prediction of depth-averaged velocity, boundary shear, and energy loss for different flow conditions. From the experimental study, new expressions for the water surface, energy loss and stage-discharge relationship for converging compound channels have been developed and validated with the present data and data sets from previous research projects. The distribution of boundary shear stress over different zones of a compound <b>section</b> of <b>prismatic</b> and non-prismatic compound channels are analyzed with several data sets of other researchers, new models for predicting subsection shear force are also suggested. Using the proposed shear models, the stage–discharge relations in case of both prismatic compound channels having different width ratio and non-prismatic compound channel of different converging angles are then evaluated. These developed models are well validated with new experimental data as well as with datasets of another researcher. The efficiency of the model has also been verified by applying natural river data sets and comparing well with other existing models. ...|$|R

From the mathematical expression of this curve and the theory of reflected caustics, {{it is possible to}} evaluate accurately the warping function of the cross section. Using this idea, it was possible to study the torsion problem in <b>prismatic</b> bars with <b>sections</b> which were equilateral triangles and squares. It was observed that the shape of the caustic is an hypocycloid curve with three or four cusps respectively. By evaluating the warping function by using elements from the respective caustics it was possible to find out that, for the triangular cross section, the expression for the warping function coincided exactly with the expression given by the exact solution of the problem. For the square cross section, a closed-form solution for its warping function was readily derived, to which the series approximation solution differed only by a few percent at maximum for the shear stresses. Since the method can be readily extended to any canonical polygonic cross section, it constitutes a general solution for the torsion of prismatic bars, which approximates their exact deformations better than the solutions based on the Saint-Vénant assumptions. © 1989 Society for Experimental Mechanics, Inc...|$|R
