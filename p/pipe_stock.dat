40|$|Friction stir welding (FSW) is {{a fairly}} recent {{technique}} that utilizes a nonconsumable rotating welding tool to generate frictional heat and plastic deformation at the welding location, thereby affecting {{the formation of a}} joint while the material is in the solid state. The principal advantages of FSW, being a solid-state process, are low distortion, absence of melt-related defects and high joint strength, even in those alloys that are considered nonweldable by conventional techniques. Furthermore, friction stir (FS) welded joints are characterized by the absence of filler-induced problems / defects, since the technique requires no filler, and by the low hydrogen contents in the joints, an important consideration in welding steels and other alloys susceptible to hydrogen damage. FSW can be used to produce butt, corner, lap, T, spot, fillet and hem joints, as well as to weld hollow objects, such as tanks and tubes / <b>pipes,</b> <b>stock</b> with different thicknesses, tapered sections and parts with 3 -dimensional contours. The technique can produce joints utilizing equipment based on traditional machine tool technologies, and it has been used to weld a variety of similar and dissimilar alloys as well as for welding metal matrix composites and the for the repair of existing joints. Replacement of fastened joints with FS welded joints can lead to significant weight and cost savings, attractive propositions for many industries...|$|R

40|$|Mineral {{deposits}} and {{prospects of the}} Pan-African Saldania orogenic belt in the Western Cape Province, South Africa, are reviewed. The polyphase, deformed, low-grade metamorphosed, volcano-sedimentary Malmesbury Group constitutes a complex, poorly understood supracrustal sequence that has been loosely subdivided into the Tygerberg, Swartland and Boland tectono-stratigraphic terranes {{on the basis of}} NW-trending fault zones. Syn- and post-tectonic granitoids of the Cape Granite Suite selectively intruded these terranes. Early S-types preferred the Tygerberg terrane, whereas the later I-types dominate the remaining areas. Anorogenic A-type granites, however, occur in all three terranes. Despite the absence of operating base or precious metal mines in the area, this study has established at least four metal associations directly or indirectly related to the intrusions: 1. i) Cassiterite-wolframite (±Au, Cu, Mo, Zn, As, Fe-sulphides) in quartz and quartz/aplite veins hosted by tour-malinized and locally greissenized S-type granite. Similar exo-granitic veins occur in proximal metamorphites; 2. ii) Juxtaposed, disseminated, stockwork breccia and vein style CuMoFe(Au) -sulphide mineralization hosted by mafic- to intermediate-intrusions of high-K calc-alkaline, I-type affinity; 3. iii) CuMoAu-sulphides hosted by hydraulic breccia <b>pipes,</b> <b>stocks</b> and veins occurring in anorogenic A-type alkali feldspar granites and amphibole quartz syenites; 4. iv) Scheelite with minor CuMoAu-sulphides associated with endo- and exo-skams spatially related to I-type monzogranite, granite and alkali feldspar granite. The first three associations occur along the Yzerfontein-Helderberg-zone, a 180 km lineament in the Tygerberg terrane, exploited by syn-, late- and post-tectonic intrusions and their related mineralization. The fourth association is typical of the Boland terrane. The spatial and temporal relationships among the various metal associations are interpreted as the result of sequential intrusion of the granitoid suite. Relatively early, high level S-type, followed by intermediate level I-type and finally anorogenic A-type granitoids intruded during the evolution of a contracting continental margin arc and its inner arc. The spatial configuration of the various terranes at the present erosional levels is the result of rifting and significant differential vertical displacement following the cessation of subduction. This terminal tectonic event was synchronous with the intrusion of the A-type granitoids. © 1995. Articl...|$|R

However nearly 36 tmcft dead storage water {{available in the}} reservoir {{could not be used}} for the dire needs. With minor external modifications to the exiting reversible hydro turbine unit, all the dead storage water can be put to use during the drought years by using the hydro power plant for pumping water into the nearby left canal.

5000|$|Horizontal {{bandsaws}} {{hold the}} workpiece stationary while the blade swings {{down through the}} cut. This configuration is used to cut long materials such as <b>pipe</b> or bar <b>stock</b> to length. Thus {{it is an important}} part of the facilities in most machine shops. The horizontal design is not useful for cutting curves or complicated shapes. Small horizontal bandsaws typically employ a gravity feed alone, retarded to an adjustable degree by a coil spring; on industrial models, the rate of descent is usually controlled by a hydraulic cylinder that bleeds through an adjustable valve. When the saw is set up for a cut, the operator raises the saw, positions the material to be cut underneath the blade, and then turns on the saw. The blade slowly descends into the material, cutting it as the band blade moves. When the cut is complete, a switch is tripped and the saw automatically turns off. More sophisticated versions of this type of saw are partially or entirely automated (via PLC or CNC) for high-volume cutting of machining blanks. Such machines provide a stream of cutting fluid recirculated from a sump, in the same manner that a CNC machining center does.|$|R

40|$|A reverse merger {{allows a}} private company to assume the current {{reporting}} status of another company that is public. This can be done quickly, without fundraising, road show, underwriter, substantial ownership dilution, or great expense. Private firms that go public via reverse merger are often motivated {{by the need to}} quickly secure financing through privately placed <b>stock</b> (<b>PIPEs)</b> and the desire to make acquisitions using stock as payment. In each of the last eight years reverse mergers have outnumbered traditional IPOs as a mechanism for going public, and reporting shell companies are providing fuel for much of this growth. We study 585 trading shell companies over the period 2006 - 2008. The purpose of most of these shell firms is to find a suitor for a reverse merger agreement. These companies have no systematic risk, operations, or assets, and their share price tends to decline over time. Yet, these firms have investors. When a takeover agreement is consummated, shell company three-month abnormal returns are 48. 1 %. We argue that this exceptional return is compensation to investors for shell stock illiquidity and the uncertainty of finding a reverse merger suitor. We show that shell company returns are much greater at the consummation of a merger than those of a similar entity that in dollar terms is more popular among investors [...] Special Purpose Acquisition Companies (SPACs).

40|$|Twenty-one alkalic {{porphyry}} {{deposits of}} Late Ordovician to Early Silurian age occur in two mineral districts in New South Wales. The Cadia and Northparkes districts formed in shoshonitic volcanic centres where a major basement structure (the Lachlan Transverse Zone) cut the Ordovician Macquarie Arc obliquely. Processes of mineralisation in both districts were centred {{in and around}} quartz monzonite porphyry complexes that intruded the volcanic centres. These composite intrusive complexes comprise <b>pipes,</b> dykes and <b>stocks.</b> Hydrothermal alteration {{in and around the}} intrusions produced a complex sequence of potassic, calc-potassic, sodic, propylitic and late stage, typically fault- and fracturecontrolled phyllic assemblages. Hematite dusting was a common alteration product giving the intrusions and the altered volcano-sedimentary host sequences a distinctive pink-orange coloration. Several of the deposits have bornite-rich cores, chalcopyrite-dominant annuli and pyritic outer haloes. Gold is well correlated with bornite in most of the deposits, and with chalcopyrite at Cadia Hill. The mineralising intrusions have Sr and Nd isotopic compositions consistent with derivation from a depleted mantle source regime, although the Nd data are permissive of limited crustal contamination. Epidote peripheral to the porphyry deposits has Sr isotopic compositions indistinguishable from the host intrusions, precluding the involvement of external seawater in the mineralising processes. In contrast, slightly elevated initial Sr values have been detected in epidote from nearby skarn deposits, indicative of incorporation of a minor component of Sr from limestone dissolution or seawater mixing. The alkalic porphyry deposits are difficult exploration targets because intensely developed hydrothermal alteration zones are restricted to within a few hundred metres of the monzonite complexes...|$|R

In January 2007, the quagga mussel (Dreissena rostriformis bugensis), was found in Lake Mead. This became the first known Dreissenid species in the southwest and the only time a large water system was first infested by the quagga mussel and not the zebra mussel (Dreissena polymorpha). This invasive species has quickly spread to Lake Mohave and further down the lower Colorado River drainage. The microscopic size (70 µm or larger) of the veliger life stage makes it impossible to see with the unaided eye and difficult to remove from water delivery <b>pipes</b> and fish <b>stocking</b> trucks. This invasive mussel has affected the stocking abilities of the United States Bureau of Reclamation Lower Colorado River Multi-Species Conservation Program Fish Augmentation Plan. One {{purpose of this study is}} to determine if quagga veligers can be completely removed from lake water by a combination of sand, zeolite, and paper filtration. Results for the filtration experiment show that the relative risk of transferring quagga mussels to Willow Beach National Fish Hatchery during a night of larval collections is low. Filtered lake water provides a significant reduction of veligers present in the water compared to the unfiltered lake water (p=. 009). The other purpose of this study is to determine if exposure to different doses of ultraviolet radiation can damage or kill veligers. The UV exposure doses were 1, 3, 6, and 12 times through the SafeGUARD UV system. After exposure, 50 veligers were observed at time 0, 24, 48, 72, and 96 hours.
