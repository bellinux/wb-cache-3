The following hypotheses were stated: 1) multiculturalism is not an issue of necessity for children 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>book</b> authors in the United States; 2) an etic, or universal, cultural perspective is a prominent aspect of the conversation on multiculturalism; 3) multicultural issues in children 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>books</b> happen along a continuum of inclusion; and 4) a link is prominent between the content and process of the storie...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to explore how Aboriginal peoples and knowledges have been and {{continue}} to be portrayed through visual texts in children 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> picture <b>books.</b> This study examines children 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>books</b> that were published from 1960 through to 2010. This exploration is important as students and educators interact with these texts in their daily lives both inside and outside of school. Drawing from a critical literacy framework, a critical text analysis is used to gain insight into representations of Aboriginal and First Nations people in children 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>books.</b> While critical literacy practice is a key component in education today, there appears to be a lack of critical inquiry and discussion concerning visual texts found in children 2 ̆ 7 s texts. A critical inquiry into representations of Aboriginal peoples in children 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>books</b> is essential, especially in a time when a significant number of Aboriginal students still struggle with academic achievement and finding cultural relevance in the education system. Ultimately, the study may help address these issues by beginning the process whereby students will be able to develop critical visual literacy dispositions in order to address issues of equity...|$|R
40|$|This year {{marks the}} eightieth {{anniversary of the}} first edition of Francis Cornford 2 ̆ 7 s The Origin of Attic Comedy, a book that sought the origins and essence of Old Comedy in 2 ̆ 2 {{primitive}} 2 ̆ 2 ritual, cult, and myth.

40|$|Few, if any, American Indian {{individuals}} are more widely {{known in the}} United States than the Lakota holy man, Black Elk (1863 - 1950). His story, particularly as presented by John Neihardt in Black Elk Speaks, has been required reading for legions of students taking classes in literature, religion, anthropology, and American Indian Studies. Scholars in those fields have generated a body of critical literature which {{has taken on a}} life of its own as Neihardt 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>book,</b> originally published in 1931, has been reprinted in paperback editions many times since 1960.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to investigate, given this legacy of 500 years of {{colonization}} and miseducation of Indigenous peoples, how can Nahua/Mexica/Aztec children 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>books</b> be decolonized and made appropriate to the twenty-first century? The study involved three methodologies: (1) quantitative research consisting of a survey; (2) qualitative research consisting of four focus groups with Indigenous and non-Indigenous participants who reviewed, analyzed, and discussed ten books, three books per group; and (3) using critical race theory and tribal critical race theory to analyze thirty-five Nahua/Mexica/Aztec K- 8 th grade children 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>books</b> published both in the United States and Mexico for stereotypical and racist, or constructive and positive content. 76 surveys were returned, focus groups were conducted in Queens, New York; Houston, Texas; Oakland, California; and Mexico City, Mexico; a total of eighteen participants, and eight out of the forty-five books studied are identified as decolonized Nahua children 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>books.</b> ^ The participants of this study included parents, college students, professors, teachers, activists, a home schooling parent, librarian, counselor, and a children 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>book</b> editor. The participants involved are knowledgeable or concerned about children 2 ̆ 7 s literature, the Nahua/Mexica way of life, or the work of decolonization. Also, some of the participants are members of the Native American Church (NAC) and Danza Anahuak (Mexica dance). The major findings of this study involved: (1) the characteristics of colonized Nahua/Mexica/Aztec children 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>books</b> to consist of incorrect information, reinforced stereotypes, and racist characterizations such as the Nahuas being extinct or violent 2 ̆ 2 savages, 2 ̆ 2 having practiced human sacrifices, and the application of Western concepts such as 2 ̆ 2 God, 2 ̆ 2 2 ̆ 2 King, 2 ̆ 2 and 2 ̆ 2 Lord, 2 ̆ 2 to describe the Nahua culture; and (2) the characteristics of decolonized Nahua children‘s books to consist of books written in the Nahuatl language, with literal translations, and based on the oral tradition. Other findings were: prior to even thinking of decolonizing Nahua/Mexica/Aztec children‘s books, one has to understand how 500 years of colonization has affected the Nahuas, critique Western teachings about the Nahua culture, value the importance of the oral tradition, incorporate the Nahua epistemology, and begin to re-write the incorrect, stereotypical, and racist misrepresentations of Western civilization about the Mexica culture. ...|$|R

Today we understand that addiction {{is less of a}} disease and more of a choice, however, it continues to be a perplexing disease. The focus of this thesis project is to condense the theories presented in Dr. Ronald Ruden 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>book</b> The Craving Brain into a 7 minute animated film. The film illustrates three major topics outlined in the book: 2 ̆ 2 Landscaping the Brain 2 ̆ 2, stress, and neurotransmitters.

This is a 2 - dimensional animated film with accompanying voice over and sound track. There is no dialogue, only narration explaining the animated visuals on screen.
