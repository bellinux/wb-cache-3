5|$|Meyer is a driven, arrogant surgeon, {{with high}} {{expectations}} of his colleagues. His major storylines see him operate {{on his own}} sister, fear {{that he may have}} Motor Neurone Disease, lose his spleen after being shot in a road rage incident, and ultimately depart from Holby for Michigan when the hospital Board make impositions on his autonomy. Irving made the decision to leave the series as he struggled to set the character aside outside of work, which had a negative impact on his personal life. He ruled out the <b>possibility</b> <b>of</b> <b>returning</b> to Holby City in future, preferring his memory of Meyer to remain untarnished.|$|E
5|$|Even Born was {{surprised}} to discover that Paul Dirac had been thinking along the same lines as Heisenberg. Soon Wolfgang Pauli used the matrix method to calculate the energy values of the hydrogen atom, and found that they agreed with the Bohr model. Another important contribution was made by Erwin Schrödinger, who looked at the problem using wave mechanics. This {{had a great deal of}} appeal to many at the time, as it offered the <b>possibility</b> <b>of</b> <b>returning</b> to deterministic classical physics. Born would have none of this, as it ran counter to facts determined by experiment. He formulated the now-standard interpretation of the probability density function for ψ*ψ in the Schrödinger equation, which he published in July 1926.|$|E
5|$|By 1968, {{the wild}} herd were {{concentrated}} mostly on BLM lands owing to previous roundups {{and construction of}} boundary fences. That year, the BLM again stated its intention to remove the herds, {{this time with the}} <b>possibility</b> <b>of</b> <b>returning</b> a small number (either 15 or 35) to the range. In response to the new announcement, the Pryor Mountain Wild Horse Association (PMWHA) was formed with the goal of preventing the roundup, and began working in concert with larger organizations such as the International Society for the Protection of Animals. The BLM argued that the horses were being removed because they were likely to starve, as they had overgrazed their environment, while the PMWHA argued the degradation of the range was not due to the horses and that in fact they were in no danger of starving. The organization further charged that the BLM was acting at the behest of other state and federal organizations who wished to see the horses removed, rather than acting in line with public opinion. The PMWHA was also concerned with the effect that the penning would have on the feral horses.|$|E

The loss of guards Marco Rivera and Mike Wahle to free agency along with key injuries to Javon Walker, Ahman Green, Bubba Franks, among others, hampered Favre and the team. His passer rating was 70.9, 31st in the NFL and the worst single season rating of his career. After the disappointing season, many speculated that Favre would retire. However, on April 26, 2006, Favre {{announced that he would}} remain with the team for the 2006 season.

40|$|This {{bachelor}} thesis aims on {{determination of}} contemporary and potential future <b>possibilities</b> <b>of</b> <b>return</b> <b>of</b> target group - homeless people on labour market {{as the way}} of their social integration to the society with the focus on Prague, and own formulation of measures for further dealing with this issue. Data obtained from available literature, academic articles, public policy documents, web sites and expert interviews are used for analyses. Outputs of conducted analyses show that contemporary <b>possibilities</b> <b>of</b> <b>returning</b> to labour market for target group of homeless people are very limited, {{especially in terms of}} number of employment offers suited for this target group. It was revealed, that this way of integration is not treated with adequate attention, which is needed for improvement of current situation. Recommendations for dealing with this issue were formed based on performed analysis, between which I count emphasis on individual approach to homeless people as a specific target group and creation of direct measures for the development of their employment by supporting social entrepreneurship, creation of better starting conditions for new projects and implementation of reliefs for employers from private sector...|$|R
