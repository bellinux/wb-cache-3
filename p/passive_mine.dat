50|$|Calcium silicate, {{also known}} as slag, is {{produced}} when molten iron is made from iron ore, silicon dioxide and calcium carbonate in a blast furnace. When this material is processed into a highly refined, re-purposed calcium silicate aggregate, it {{is used in the}} remediation of acid mine drainage (AMD) on active and <b>passive</b> <b>mine</b> sites. Calcium silicate neutralizes active acidity in AMD systems by removing free hydrogen ions from the bulk solution, thereby increasing pH. As its silicate anion captures H+ ions (raising the pH), it forms monosilicic acid (H4SiO4), a neutral solute. Monosilicic acid remains in the bulk solution to play other important roles in correcting the adverse effects of acidic conditions. As opposed to limestone (a popular remediation material), calcium silicate effectively precipitates heavy metals and does not armor over, prolonging its effectiveness in AMD systems.|$|E

The main armoured steel body of the vehicle is raised high above the ground, so when a mine is detonated, the explosion is less likely to damage the crew compartment and kill the occupants. The cross-section of the hull is V-shaped, directing the force of the explosion outwards, further protecting the occupants. The vehicle also offers crew protection from small arms fire. The capabilities of the Casspir were the basis of the outline capabilities required by the U.S. Marines' for their Mine Resistant Ambush Protected or MRAP vehicle project.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. We {{present a}} new active {{learning}} approach to incorporate human feedback for on-line unusual event detection. In contrast to most existing unsupervised methods that perform <b>passive</b> <b>mining</b> for unusual events, our approach automatically requests supervision for critical points to resolve ambiguities of interest, leading to more robust and accurate detection on subtle unusual events. The active learning strategy is formulated as a stream-based solution, i. e. it makes decision on-the-fly {{on whether to}} query for labels. It adaptively combines multiple active learning criteria to achieve (i) quick discovery of unknown event classes and (ii) refinement of classification boundary. Experimental results on busy public space videos show that with minimal human supervision, our approach outperforms existing supervised and unsupervised learning strategies in identifying unusual events. In addition, better performance is achieved by using adaptive multi-criteria approach compared to existing single criterion and multi-criteria active learning strategies. ...|$|R

One of these mechanisms is dependant on the positive surface charge that exists on Fe(III) oxyhydroxide surfaces at pH values below the Iso-Electric Point (IEP). However, this mechanism can be disputed as, in the presence of bicarbonate alkalinity typical of many UK mine waters, catalysis is still observed at pH 6. 5 despite an IEP shift from pH 8 to 4.

40|$|Conventionally, limestones {{have been}} used in <b>passive</b> <b>mine</b> water {{treatment}} systems. Limestones with the highest proportion of calcite are recommended since they have the greatest long-term alkalinity generating potential. Manganese is present in mine waters and needs to be removed in order to comply with environmental quality standards. This paper compares seven different Permian carbonate rocks, both limestone and dolomite, in their ability to promote manganese oxidation in real mine waters over an 8 -h period. The substrates are characterised using thermogravimetric analysis, X-Ray diffraction and scanning electron microscopy. Fluorescence spectrophotometry is used to monitor any changes in the dissolved organic matter concentration in the water as manganese is removed. We determine that there is no statistically significant correlation between manganese removal and the proportion of calcite or between manganese removal and substrate surface roughness. Fluorescence spectrophotometry demonstrates that there is a distinct change in the observed spectra in the water during manganese removal. There is a positive and statistically significant correlation between manganese removal and the production of a tyrosine-like substance (up to 150 ppb in 8 h), which fluoresces at 270 &# 8211; 280 nm excitation wavelength and 300 &# 8211; 310 nm emission wavelength, suggesting that microbial activity {{is an important factor in}} promoting manganese removal within dolomite passive treatment systems.

Various measures of system hydraulic efficiency are presented in conjunction with influent and effluent iron chemistry to give a snapshot of system performance. The effectiveness of both settlement lagoons and wetlands are discussed with respect to rates of iron removal and the relative importance of different iron removal mechanisms. It is suggested that where significant accumulations of ochre sludge occur in settlement lagoons reductive dissolution of Fe(III) may lead to remobilisation of iron as Fe(II) into the surrounding water. The role of aeration cascade design in increasing dissolved oxygen and increasing pH via CO 2 degassing is also considered for a number of the sites investigated. The sites studied include four systems comprising settling lagoons and wetlands. Influent iron concentration, pH and alkalinity varied considerably between sites with 5. 67 - 48. 2 mg/L Fe, pH 2. 20 - 7. 22 and 120 - 251 mg/L as CaCO 3 alkalinity. Settling lagoons were found to work more efficiently at higher influent iron concentrations though all of the systems met their targets for effluent water quality.

Preservation of the historical sites in mining areas {{does not allow for}} remediation technologies that result in significant alteration of the historical landscape. Therefore, alternative remediation techniques such as <b>passive</b> <b>mine</b> water treatment have been tested. The climate in Norway varies from mild coastal climates to artic climates, and one of the challenges with passive treatment systems is the cold winter conditions. Anaerobic treatment systems have been built at Kongens Mine near Røros, at Folldal mines, and at Titania’s tailings impoundment near Storgangen Mine. These systems utilize sulfate-reducing bacteria that result in the precipitation of metal sulfides. A full-and pilot-scale system at Kongens Mine and Folldal were built in 2006 to remove copper and zinc from typical ARD in an alpine climate. Previous testing with pilot scale systems at Kongens Mine showed that up to 85 % copper and 48 % zinc could be removed. At Titania A/S the anaerobic system is designed to remove nickel from neutral waters. At this system over 90 % nickel is removed when water flow is regulated at a constant flow. Testing shows that the system can function in cold winter conditions, however, optimal metal removal is achieved under warmer temperatures. Temperatures changes by global climatic warming will not adversely affect these anaerobic systems. However, extreme precipitation events and the resulting rapid fluctuations of ARD runoff will provide a challenge for the effectiveness of these systems...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Settling lagoons are {{a common}} feature of <b>passive</b> <b>mine</b> water {{treatment}} schemes but tend to require large surface areas, this makes them unfeasible in the numerous locations where space is limited. A novel pilot-scale vertical flow reactor has been built at the Taff Merthyr former colliery site. The vertical flow system is designed to replace conventional settling lagoons and decrease the surface-area requirements. To achieve this, the system is designed {{to take advantage of}} the surface-catalysed oxidation of Fe(II) on ochre surfaces and the (self) filtration of an ochre bed. This paper presents results from the first four months of operation and details iron and manganese removal. The system receives net-alkaline water from the abandoned colliery, the water quality is typically pH 6. 9, with Fe TOT of 9 mg/l. The results show that the vertical flow reactor achieves higher iron removal rates (typically between 10 and 20 g/m 2 /d) compared to the settling lagoon (typically < 5 g/m 2 /d). The vertical flow reactor achieves these removal rates with a smaller residence time, often half that of the settling lagoon. Manganese is present in the influent in low concentrations (~ 0. 8 mg/l). Operating data show that about 50 % of Mn can be removed in the vertical flow reactor in 24 hrs compared to just 5 % in 24 hours in the settling lagoon. Longevity of the reactor will depend on maintaining an acceptable permeability in the bed. Although the permeability fell rapidly at first, the indications are that it is stabilising near to 10 - 4 m/s. Additional Key Words: Surface catalysed iron oxidatio...|$|E

40|$|The Bowden Close <b>passive</b> <b>mine</b> water {{treatment}} system (PTS), {{in the north}} east of England, was commissioned in 2003 to treat net-acidic coal mine drainage. The monitoring data for iron, aluminium and acidity in its influents and effluent {{for the first four}} years of the treatment are presented here. The PTS consists of two Reducing and Alkalinity Producing Systems (RAPS) operating in parallel, followed by a single polishing aerobic wetland. The main purpose of the treatment system is to raise pH and alkalinity of the mine water and to lower iron and aluminium concentrations. The two influent waters derive from an abandoned underground coal mine (influent 1, discharged into RAPS 1) and from a waste rock pile located on the former colliery site (influent 2, discharged into RAPS 2). The influents are moderate to strongly acidic, and iron- and aluminium-rich (pHmean = 4. 9 - 5. 6, alkalinitymean = 10 - 24 mg L- 1 CaCO 3 eq, acidity = 12 - 863 mg L- 1 CaCO 3 eq, Femean = 16 - 68 mg L- 1, and Almean = 5 - 32 mg L- 1. Average flow rates are 36 L min- 1 (influent 1) and 99 L min- 1 (influent 2). The pH of the final effluent is raised to 7. 0 (median) and always exceeds 5. 7.

40|$|A {{study was}} {{undertaken}} on the Bowden Close (BCl) <b>Passive</b> <b>mine</b> water Treatment System (PTS). BCl {{consists of two}} parallel working Reducing and Alkalinity Producing Systems (RAPS, reactive substrate = limestone, compost, manure) that are followed by a polishing wetland. Thereafter, the water is discharged into a local burn. The main purpose of the PTS is to decrease metal concentrations (Fe (≤ 177 mgL- 1), Al (≤ 85 mgL- 1), Zn (≤ 2. 8 mgL- 1), Mn (≤ 20. 5 mgL- 1)) and increase alkalinity (≥ 0 mg L- 1 CaCO 3 eq) and pH (≥ 3. 2) in two coal mine drainages. The {{aim of this study}} was to assess the treatment performance and the dominant (bio) geochemical processes promoting metal removal and alkalinity generation, particularly in the RAPS. Over nearly six years of operation, BCl performed well with regards to the removal of iron (- 84 %) and aluminium (- 87 %) and the generation of alkalinity (+ 74 %). Zinc (- 51 %), manganese (- 23 %) and sulfate (- 29 %) were partially removed. The effluent pH was raised to ~ 6. 9. However, a long-term decrease in alkalinity generation has been observed, which could threaten the treatment performance over the short term and might eventually lead to metal remobilization. Against expectations, Bacterial Sulfate Reduction (BSR) is not a driving process in the removal of the main contaminant, iron. Only ~ 5 % of iron was removed as di-sulfide mineral (i. e. pyrite). Rather, removal processes such as observed in aerobic treatment systems predominate (i. e. retention in (hydr) oxides). It is suggested, that the reoxidation of hydrogen sulfide by Fe(III) hydroxides is limiting the generation of mineral sulfides. Carbon isotope ratios of total dissolved inorganic carbon indicate that anaerobic microbial respiration, including BSR, has considerable influence on the generation of alkalinity. Two mass balances suggest, that more than 52 % of bicarbonate generated by the RAPS derives from the oxidation of organic matter, thereby safeguarding the limestone in the reactive substrate and increasing the overall lifetime of the RAPS. Analyses of sulfur and oxygen isotope ratios of dissolved sulfate and sulfide, together with solid phase sulfur and water isotopes suggested: i) mine waters are of meteoric origin, ii) and have one single sulfate sulfur source (potentially oxidation of coal derived iron sulfide), iii) sulfide oxidation in the mine waters is dominated by anaerobic oxidation, iv) in both RAPS, BSR is occurring year round, v) sulfate concentrations might be limiting BSR in RAPS 1 during the summer months and vi) pyrite seemed to form via the hydrogen sulfide pathway without solid phase iron mono-sulfide intermediate. Overall, sulfur and oxygen isotope fractionation suggest that BSR kinetics are slow and bi-directional. Detailed studies, including the microbial ecology in the RAPS are proposed to enhance understanding about the functioning of the system.

40|$|Acid mine {{drainage}} is a {{well known}} environmental pollutant, not only in South Africa, but throughout the world, {{and the use of}} microbial processes in the treatment of these wastes {{has been the subject of}} investigation over past decades. Lignocellulose packed-bed reactors have been used in passive treatment systems, and, although effective initially, they show early decline in performance while the packing material remains largely un-utilized. Little is known about this phenomenon which remains a severe constraint in the development of efficient <b>passive</b> <b>mine</b> water treatment systems. It has been proposed that the degradation pathways of the complex lignocellulose substrate may be limited in some way in these systems during the manifestation of this effect. This study has addressed the problem using a molecular microbial ecology methodology in an attempt to relate trophic functions of the microbial population to the physico-chemical data of the system. A field-scale lignocellulose packed-bed reactor located at Vryheid Coronation Colliery (Northern Kwa-Zulu Natal province, South Africa) was monitored for six years and the results showed the classic profile of performance decline related to a slowdown in sulphate reduction and alkalinity production. The reactor was decommissioned, comprehensive samples were collected along the depth profile and the microbial populations investigated by means of 16 S rRNA gene methodology. The population was found to include cellulolytic Clostridia spp., CytophagaIFlavobacterlBacteroidetes, Sphingomonadaceae and as yet uncultured microorganisms related to microbiota identified in the rumen and termite gut. These are all known to be involved as primary fermenters of cellulose. Oesulphosporosinus was present as sulphate reducer. A comparison of substrata sampling and population distribution suggested that spatial and temporal gradients within the system may become established over the course of its operation. Based on these findings, a laboratory-scale reactor was constructed to simulate the performance of the packed-bed reactor under controlled experimental conditions. The laboratory-scale reactor was operated for 273 days and showed comparable performance to that in the field in both biomolecular and physicochemical data. Clearly defined trophic niches were observed. These results suggested that a sequence of events does occur in lignocellulose degradation over time. Based on the spatial and temporal column studies, a descriptive model was proposed to account for these events. It was found that fermentative organisms predominate in the inlet zone of the system using easily extractable compounds from the wood, thus providing feedstock for sulphate reduction occurring in the succeeding compartments. Production of sulphide and alkalinity appears to be involved in the enhancement of lignin degradation and this, in turn, appears to enhance access to the cellulose fraction. However, once the readily extractables are exhausted, the decline in sulphide and alkalinity production leads inexorably to a decline in the overall performance of the system as a sulphate reducing unit operation. These observations led to the proposal that with the addition of a limited amount of a readily available carbon source, such as molasses, in the initial zone of the the reactor, the ongoing generation of sulphide would be sustained and this in turn would sustain the microbial attack on the lignocellulose complex. This proposal was tested in scale-up studies and positive results indicate that the descriptive model may, to some extent, provide an account of events occurring in these systems. The work on sustaining lignocellulose degradation through the maintenance of sulphate reduction in the initial stages of the reactor flow path has led to the development of the Degrading Packed-bed Reactor concept and that, has subsequently been successfully evaluated in the field...|$|E

This thesis proposes solutions for resolving ambiguous visual observations and overcoming unreliability of conventional activity analysis methods by exploiting multi-camera visual context and human feedback. The thesis first demonstrates the importance of learning visual context for establishing reliable reasoning on observed activity in a camera network. In the proposed approach, a new Cross Canonical Correlation Analysis (xCCA) is formulated to discover and quantify time delayed pairwise correlations of regional activities observed within and across multiple camera views. This thesis shows that learning time delayed pairwise activity correlations offers valuable contextual information for (1) spatial and temporal topology inference of a camera network, (2) robust person re-identification, and (3) accurate activity-based video temporal segmentation. Crucially, in contrast to conventional methods, the proposed approach does not rely on either intra-camera or inter-camera object tracking; it can thus be applied to low-quality surveillance videos featuring severe inter-object occlusions. Second, to detect global unusual event across multiple disjoint cameras, this thesis extends visual context learning from pairwise relationship to global time delayed dependency between regional activities. Specifically, a Time Delayed Probabilistic Graphical Model (TD-PGM) is proposed to model the multi-camera activities and their dependencies. Subtle global unusual events are detected and localised using the model as context-incoherent patterns across multiple camera views. In the model, different nodes represent activities in different decomposed re 3 gions from different camera views, and the directed links between nodes encoding time delayed dependencies between activities observed within and across camera views. In order to learn optimised time delayed dependencies in a TD-PGM, a novel two-stage structure learning approach is formulated by combining both constraint-based and scored-searching based structure learning methods. Third, to cope with visual context changes over time, this two-stage structure learning approach is extended to permit tractable incremental update of both TD-PGM parameters and its structure. As opposed to most existing studies that assume static model once learned, the proposed incremental learning allows a model to adapt itself to reflect {{the changes in the}} current visual context, such as subtle behaviour drift over time or removal/addition of cameras.

Innovative developments were the use of passive reflectors and two-way signal boosters for extending signals into intersecting crosscuts, development of lightweight signal margin measuring equipment, modifications of mobile digital encoders to automatically send status information from mine vehicles such as numbers of loads of ore delivered, hot engine, etc., and the use of CATV technology for multiplexing audio, digital and video signals onto coaxial cables from the surface to the mine...|$|R
40|$|<b>Passive</b> {{treatment}} of <b>mine</b> water uses {{chemical and biological}} processes to decrease metal concentrations and neutralize acidity. Compared to conventional chemical treatment, passive methods generally require more land area, but use less costly reagents, and require less operational attention and maintenance. Currently, the three most common types of passive technologies are aerobic ponds and wetlands, anoxic limestone drains (ALDs), and reducing and alkalinity-producing systems (RAPS). Aerobic wetlands promote mixed oxidation and hydrolysis reactions, and are effective when the raw mine water is net alkaline. Anoxic limestone drains generate bicarbonate alkalinity {{and can be used}} to convert water that is net acidic into netalkaline water for treatment in aerobic ponds and wetlands. RAPS promote reducing conditions and limestone dissolution. They extend the concept of ALDs by pre-treating the water before it contacts the limestone, to eliminate dissolved oxygen and reduce dissolved ferric iron to ferrous iron. These systems can generally be used to treat more acidic water than ALDs, and can better treat water with significant aluminum concentrations. In passive treatment systems, rates of metal and acidity removal and alkalinity generation have been developed empirically. Aerobic wetlands remove iron from alkaline water at rates of 10 to 20 g m & 2 d & 1. Anoxic limestone drains add 150 to 300 mg/L of alkalinity in about 15 hours of contact, imparting 5 to 20 mg/L of alkalinity per hour of contact. Reducing and alkalinityproducing systems add 15 to 60 g m & 2 d & 1 of alkalinity, depending on influent water quality and contact time. Selection and sizing criteria for the design of passive treatment systems are presented in this report...|$|R
40|$|Much of the {{literature}} relating {{to the history of}} miners has been written from a union orientated perspective. In this study a broader understanding of the lives of miners and their families is sought. Notions of community and communal belonging are central throughout the investigation. The extent of migration is considered. Clear evidence of residential clustering of migrants is uncovered. This had a significant impact upon community development within the settlements. The study acknowledges the centrality of the workplace in mining communities. Primary evidence suggests, though, that the mining workplace was not a cohesive social unit. Divisions within the workplace were as significant as those bet ween capital and labour. Longstanding, rigid divisions between grades of mining employees were uncovered which impacted upon their lives outside work. An examination of women's lives within the settlements questions the general assertion that they played an economically <b>passive</b> role within <b>mining</b> settlements. Women participated actively in the public life of the settlements through their involvement in mining disputes and other communal expressions of approbation, such as rough music. Religious and leisure activities revealed much about how individuals sought to construct their own identities and those of their settlements. Both boundaries of belonging and the triumph of custom over capitalist relations were affirmed through events such as celebrations. The study reveals the composite belonging. Individuals engaged in the annual feast nature of community a multiplicity of communities ranging from the micro-community of the family to the macro-community of the nation. The nature of individuals' communal participation was determined by factors such as their: age; gender; workplace position; and marital status. Communal belonging was fluid. Particular aspects of communal identity fluctuated in significance depending upon circumstance...|$|R
40|$|Since {{closure of}} the Woodsreef Asbestos Mine, located in the Great Serpentinite Belt (GSB), New South Wales, Australia, {{extensive}} carbonate-rich crusts have formed by recessive weathering of fine-grained material {{on the surface of}} the tailings pile. A relationship exists between the mode of carbonate occurrence, the mineralogy and the isotopic fingerprint of carbonates from the tailings pile. Vertical carbonate crusts, covering most of the tailings, predominantly consist of the hydrated Mg-carbonate hydromagnesite (Mg 5 (CO 3) 4 (OH) 2 · 4 H 2 O), which has precipitated from evaporating meteoric waters incorporating atmospheric CO 2, as reflected in high δ 18 O, δ 13 C and F 14 C signatures, respectively. Low and variable concentrations of magnesite, dolomite and calcite represent bedrock carbonate, which has formed during alteration of the serpentinite bedrock before mining and is characterised by moderately high δ 18 O, low δ 13 C and F 14 C, a signature typical for ‘weathering-derived’ magnesite deposits in the GSB. The carbonate fraction of deep cement samples, collected from 70 to 120 cm below the surface, representing the bulk tailings material at depth, predominantly consists of pyroaurite (Mg 6 Fe 2 (CO 3) (OH) 16 · 4 H 2 O) and, despite stable isotope signatures similar to bedrock, contains significant radiocarbon. This indicates that pyroaurite, forming under different conditions as hydromagnesite, may represent an additional trap for atmospheric CO 2 in the Woodsreef mine tailings. The distribution of carbonates and quartz, together with the absence of isotopic mixing trends between bedrock carbonate and atmospheric-derived carbonate, strongly indicates that dissolution and re-precipitation of bedrock carbonate is not a dominant process in the Woodsreef tailings. The cations for carbonate formation are instead derived from the dissolution of serpentine minerals (lizardite and chrysotile) and brucite. The internal standard method and the reference intensity method have been used with X-ray diffraction data to estimate the abundance of the two major carbonate minerals hydromagnesite and pyroaurite, respectively. Considering the formation of hydromagnesite on the outer surface of the tailings pile alone or together with formation of pyroaurite within the tailings pile we conclude that, between 1400 and 70, 000 t of atmospheric CO 2 have been sequestered in the mine tailings since {{closure of the}} mine 29 a ago. Carbonation rates of 27 g C m− 2 y− 1 and 1330 g C m− 2 y− 1 are significantly higher than background rates of CO 2 uptake by chemical weathering and demonstrate the potential of <b>passive</b> carbonation of <b>mine</b> tailings as a cost and energy effective alternative for storage of CO 2 in carbonate minerals...|$|R
40|$|This thesis explores a {{new design}} for a {{portable}} "permanent" superconducting magnet system. The design is an alternative to permanent low-temperature superconducting (LTS) magnet systems where the magnet is cooled by a bath of liquid helium. The new design involves a high-temperature superconducting (HTS) magnet that is cooled by a solid heat capacitor. An apparatus was constructed to demonstrate stable operation of a permanent magnet wound with Bi 2223 /Ag conductor while in thermal communication with a mass of solid nitrogen. The system includes a room-temperature bore and can func tion while it stands alone, detached from its cooling source, power supply, and vacuum pump. The magnet is operated in the 20 - 40 K temperature range. This apparatus {{is the first to}} demonstrate the operation of a superconducting magnet with a permis sible temperature variation exceeding a few degrees kelvin while a magnetic field is maintained for a useful duration. Models are developed to predict the experimental system's warming trend and magnetic field decay. The models are validated with a good agreement between simulations based on these models and experimental results. Potential performance advantages of a solid nitrogen cooled permanent HTS (SN 2 /HTS) magnet system over a liquid helium cooled LTS (LHe/LTS) system are explored for various applications. The SN 2 /HTS system design includes a second solid heat capacitor that cools a radiation shield. Recooling of the heat capacitors is performed with a detachable cryocooler. The SN 2 /HTS system offers both improved stability and improved portabilit over an LHe/LTS system design. (cont.) Design codes are constructed to comiiie the SN 2 /HTS system design with a LHe/LTS design for two different applicatiohs. The first application is a general permanent superconducting magnet employing a room temperature bore. The second application is a superconducting mine countermeasures system (SCMCM) that is used to sweep <b>passive</b> magnetic influence <b>mines.</b> The codes predict the important system attributes, namely minimum volume and minimum weight, that should be expected fora given set of design requirements (i. e. field magnitude and bore size, or magnetic dipole moment) and a given set of conductor properties. Their results indicate that present HTS conductor critical current and index are not yet sufficient for producing SN 2 /HTS systems of a size that is comparable to that expected for a LHe/LTS system. However, the conductor properties of Bi 2223 /Ag have been consistently improving over the last decade, and new HTS conductors are expected to be developed in the near future. Therefore, the codes are used to determine the minimum HTS properties that are necessary for constructing a cryocooled SN 2 /HTS system with a size comparable to that expected for a LHe/LTS system. by Benjamin J.
