40|$|A {{value of}} the {{enthalpy}} of formation of the phenoxy radical in the gas phase, ΔH°, 298 K (ϕO·, g) = 11. 4 ± 2. 0 kcal/mol, has been obtained from the kinetic study of the unimolecular decompositions of <b>phenyl</b> <b>ethyl</b> <b>ether,</b> phenyl allyl ether, and benzyl methyl ether at very low pressures. Bond fission, producing phenoxy or benzyl radicals, respectively, is the only mode of decomposition in each case. The present value leads to a bond dissociation energy BDE(ϕO—H) = 86. 5 ± 2 kcal/mol, in good agreement with recent estimates {{made on the basis}} of competitive oxidation steps in the liquid phase. A comparison with bond dissociation energies of aliphatic alcohols, BDE(RO—H) = 104 kcal/mol, reveals that the stabilization energy of the phenoxy radical (17. 5 kcal/mol) is considerably greater than the one observed for the isoelectronic benzyl radical (13. 2 kcal/mol). Decomposition of phenoxy radicals into cyclopentadienyl radicals and CO has been observed at temperatures above 1000 °K, and a mechanism for this reaction is proposed...|$|E
40|$|The {{pyrolysis}} of 2 -phenethyl {{phenyl ether}} (PPE, C_ 6 H_ 5 C_ 2 H_ 4 OC_ 6 H_ 5) in a hyperthermal nozzle (300 - 1350 °C) was studied {{to determine the}} importance of concerted and homolytic unimolecular decomposition pathways. Short residence times (< 100 μs) and low concentrations in this reactor allowed the direct detection of the initial reaction products from thermolysis. Reactants, radicals, and most products were detected with photoionization (10. 5 eV) time-of-flight mass spectrometry (PIMS). Detection of phenoxy radical, cyclopentadienyl radical, benzyl radical, and benzene suggest the formation of product by the homolytic scission of the C_ 6 H_ 5 C_ 2 H_ 4 -OC_ 6 H_ 5 and C_ 6 H_ 5 CH_ 2 -CH_ 2 OC_ 6 H_ 5 bonds. The detection of phenol and styrene suggests decomposition by a concerted reaction mechanism. <b>Phenyl</b> <b>ethyl</b> <b>ether</b> (PEE, C_ 6 H_ 5 OC_ 2 H_ 5) pyrolysis was also studied using PIMS and using cryogenic matrix-isolated infrared spectroscopy (matrix-IR). The results for PEE also indicate the presence of both homolytic bond breaking and concerted decomposition reactions. Quantum mechanical calculations using CBS-QB 3 were conducted, {{and the results were}} used with transition state theory (TST) to estimate the rate constants for the different reaction pathways. The results are consistent with the experimental measurements and suggest that the concerted retro-ene and Maccoll reactions are dominant at low temperatures (below 1000 °C), whereas the contribution of the C_ 6 H_ 5 C_ 2 H_ 4 -OC_ 6 H_ 5 homolytic bond scission reaction increases at higher temperatures (above 1000 °C) ...|$|E

A study of the reaction mechanism indicates that furfuryl <b>ethyl</b> <b>ether</b> is most likely formed by protonation of furfuryl alcohol or furfuryl acetate followed by S(N) 2 -substitution of the leaving group by the nucleophilic ethanol.

The interfacial properties of sterols are tested at the air-water interface. The cholesteryl ethers show a reduced interfacial stability with increasing hydrophobicity of the ether-linked moiety.
