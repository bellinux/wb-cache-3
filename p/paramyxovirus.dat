5|$|In 1966, a <b>paramyxovirus</b> {{with some}} {{antigenic}} similarity to Newcastle disease was {{isolated from the}} brain of a turquoise parrot in the Netherlands. That year, many aviary species including several species of Australian parrot {{and members of the}} genus Neophema had exhibited neurological symptoms reminiscent of Newcastle disease. Like other members of the genus, the turquoise parrot is highly sensitive to avian <b>paramyxovirus</b> infection. It is one of many species of parrot that can host the nematode Ascaridia platyceri.|$|E

5|$|In 1997 an {{outbreak}} of respiratory disease occurred in Malaysian farmers and their pigs. More than 265 cases of encephalitis, of which 105 were fatal, were recorded. A new <b>paramyxovirus</b> was discovered in a victim's brain; it was named Nipah virus, after the village where he had lived.

25|$|Evidence for {{a single}} {{promoter}} model was verified when viruses were exposed to UV light. UV radiation can cause dimerization of RNA, which prevents transcription by RNA polymerase.

However, the genome was best described by a single promoter model. When <b>paramyxovirus</b> genome was exposed to UV light, the level of inhibition of transcription was proportional to the distance from the leader sequence. That is, the further the gene is from the leader sequence, the greater the chance of RNA dimerization inhibiting RNA polymerase.|$|E

5000|$|The genus Avulavirus is one {{of seven}} genera in the family Paramyxoviridae and {{contains}} viruses {{that used to be}} classified in the genus Rubulavirus. In contrast to rubulaviruses, avulaviruses infect birds (hence the name [...] "avulaviruses", a contraction of [...] "avian rubulavirus") and translate protein V from an edited RNA transcript. Avulaviruses have a hemagglutinin-neuraminidase attachment protein and do not produce a non-structural protein C. The most important and best characterized avulavirus is Newcastle disease virus, a variant of avian <b>paramyxovirus</b> 1 (species Avian avulavirus 1). Avulaviruses can be separated into distinct serotypes using hemagglutination assay and neuraminidase assay. All avulaviruses hemagglutinate chicken RBCs except for avian <b>paramyxovirus</b> 5 which does not hemagglutinate RBCs from any species.

40|$|Nipah {{belongs to}} the family of <b>paramyxoviruses</b> that cause {{numerous}} fatal diseases in humans and farm animals. There are no FDA approved drugs for Nipah or any of the <b>paramyxoviruses.</b> Designing antiviral therapies that are more resistant to viral mutations require understanding of molecular details underlying infection. This dissertation focuses on obtaining molecular insights into the very first step of infection by Nipah. Such details, in fact, remain unknown for all <b>paramyxoviruses.</b> Infection begins with the allosteric stimulation of Nipah virus host binding protein by host cell receptors. Understanding molecular details of this stimulation process have been challenging mainly because, just as in many eukaryotic proteins, including GPCRs, PDZ domains and T-cell receptors, host receptors induce only minor structural changes (3 Ì†c 2 Ã…) and, consequently, thermal fluctuations or dynamics play a key role. This work utilizes a powerful molecular dynamics based approach, which yields information on both structure and dynamics, laying the foundation for its future applications to other <b>paramyxoviruses.</b> It proposes a new model for the initial phase of stimulation of Nipahâ€™s host binding protein, and in general, highlights that (a) interfacial waters can {{play a crucial role in}} the inception and propagation of allosteric signals; (b) extensive inter-domain rearrangements can be triggered by minor changes in the structures of individual domains; and (c) mutations in dynamically stimulated proteins can induce non-local changes that spread across entire domains...|$|R
