6000|$|LADIES AND GENTLEMEN,--I {{am not a}} bit {{ashamed of}} my part in the {{following}} transaction. I have done what little in me lay to further British commerce. British commerce is not now what it was. It is becoming open and free like everything else that is British;--open to the poor man {{as well as to}} the rich. That bugbear Capital is a crumbling old tower, and is pretty nigh brought to its last ruin. Credit is the <b>polished</b> <b>shaft</b> of the temple on which the new world of trade will be content to lean. That, I take it, is the one great doctrine of modern commerce. Credit,--credit,--credit. Get credit, and capital will follow. Doesn't the word speak for itself? Must not credit be respectable?

But, oh! Reuben Butler, the kirk, of whilk, though unworthy, I have yet been thought a <b>polished</b> <b>shaft,</b> and meet to be a pillar, holding, from my youth upward, the place of ruling elder--what will the lightsome and profane think of the guide that cannot keep his own family from stumbling? How will they take up their song and their reproach, when they see that the children of professors are liable to as foul backsliding as the offspring of Belial! But I will bear my cross with the comfort, that whatever showed like goodness in me or mine, was but like the light that shines frae creeping insects, on the brae-side, in a dark night--it kythes bright to the ee, because all is dark around it; but when the morn comes on the mountains, it is, but a puir crawling kail-worm after a'.

40|$|Mechanical systems often {{produce a}} {{considerable}} amount of vibration and noise. To be able to obtain a complete picture of the dynamic behaviour of these systems, vibration and sound measurements are of significant importance. Optical metrology is well-suited for non-intrusive measurements on complex objects. The development and the use of remote non-contact vibration measurement methods for spindles are described and vibration measurements on thin- walled structures and sound field measurements are made. It was shown that by making the surface of the spindle optically smooth, both harmonic speckle noise and crosstalk between vibration components could be avoided in laser vibrometry measurements. The radial misalignment and the out-of-roundness of the spindle could also be determined from the signal. Furthermore the technique was also used for measuring the vibrations of a tool during milling of an aluminium workpiece. The cutting vibrations were determined from the laser vibrometry signal and were compared to the measured cutting force and to the spindle head vibration. Measurement of radial vibrations along a line on a rotating <b>polished</b> <b>shaft</b> was made using digital holographic interferometry. This technique enables full field vibration measurements in two or more directions simultaneously. This method also provides mode shapes directly and may be helpful in vibration testing. Modal analysis of a thin-walled workpiece fixed in the milling machine table has been carried out for different stages of machining using scanning laser vibrometry. The result has been used for obtaining the correct boundary conditions of a finite element model of the workpiece. The finite element model together with the measured tool response obtained by laser vibrometry has been used as input parameters for predicting machining stability. Laser vibrometry measurements on a violin excited by a rotating disc were performed. The chain of interacting parts of the played violin was studied: the string, the bridge and the plates as well as the generated sound field. The measurements on the string showed stick-slip behaviour and the bridge measurements showed that the string vibrations were transmitted to the bridge both in the horizontal and the vertical direction. Measurements on the plates showed complex operational deflection shapes. The sound fields were measured and visualized for different harmonic partials of the played tone. However, the measured sound field is a two-dimensional projection of a three-dimensional sound field. This projection effect is illustrated by measurements of a sound field emitted from several ultrasound transducers from different projection angles. It was shown that by making a sufficient number of laser vibrometry measurements, the three-dimensional sound field could be reconstructed using a tomography algorithm. The idea is to apply the measurement method in rotating machines, where near-field acoustic measurements may provide additional information about a rotating machine part. The measurement methods that are developed and used provide increased understanding of the dynamics of complex structures such as thin-walled or rotating spindles. This may be utilized in the optimization of the machines currently available and in the development of machine parts. Godkänd; 2008; 20080429 (ysko...|$|E

50|$|The ten-story Fine Arts Building, {{also known}} as the Studebaker Building, is located at 410 S Michigan Avenue across from Grant Park in Chicago in the Chicago Landmark Historic Michigan Boulevard District. It was built for the Studebaker company in 1884-5 by Solon Spencer Beman, and {{extensively}} remodeled in 1898, when Beman removed the building's eighth (then the top) story and added three new stories, extending the building to its current height. Studebaker constructed the building as a carriage sales and service operation with manufacturing on upper floors. The two granite columns at the main entrance, 3 ft in diameter and 12 ft high, were said to be the largest <b>polished</b> monolithic <b>shafts</b> in the country.

2500|$|The Glacial St. Croix River {{carved a}} series of {{terraces}} along its banks. [...] Sand and gravel were occasionally caught in eddies or whirlpools and were swirled around {{with such force that}} they drilled holes straight down into the rock.

[...] The Glacial Gardens area on the Minnesota shore contains more than 80 of these glacial potholes, the greatest concentration in the world. [...] The volume of the St. Croix River eventually lessened, exposing many of the potholes to the air. [...] Dirt, vegetation, and rainwater have collected in them, disguising their true depths. [...] Some have been excavated; one, the Bottomless Pit, is [...] wide and [...] deep, the deepest explored pothole in the world. [...] Other unexcavated potholes in the park are even wider, suggesting that they may be deeper as well.|$|R

5000|$|After Hyles' {{death in}} 2001, Jack Schaap, Hyles' son-in-law, succeeded as pastor.

[...] On July 31, 2012 Schaap was fired [...] "due to a sin that has caused him to forfeit his right to be our pastor". Schaap reportedly admitted to deacons of the church {{that he had an}} adulterous affair with the young woman, who was 16 years old at the time. Since 16 is the age of consent in Indiana, sex with the girl would not have constituted statutory rape. The case was turned over to the Lake County Sheriff's Department (Indiana) for investigation.|$|R
60|$|The {{structure}} {{of each individual}} feather generally causes any change in its colouring to be symmetrical; we see this in the various laced, spangled, and pencilled breeds of the fowl; and {{on the principle of}} correlation the feathers over the whole body are often coloured in the same manner. We are thus enabled without much trouble to rear breeds with their plumage marked almost as symmetrically as in natural species. In laced and spangled fowls the coloured margins of the feathers are abruptly defined; but in a mongrel raised by me from a black Spanish cock glossed with green, and a white game-hen, all the feathers were greenish-black, excepting towards their extremities, which were yellowish-white; but between the white extremities and the black bases, there was on each feather a symmetrical, curved zone of dark-brown. In some instances the shaft of the feather determines the distribution of the tints; thus with the body-feathers of a mongrel from the same black Spanish cock and a silver-spangled <b>Polish</b> hen, the <b>shaft,</b> together with a narrow space on each side, was greenish-black, and this was surrounded by a regular zone of dark-brown, edged with brownish-white. In these cases we have feathers symmetrically shaded, like those which give so much elegance to the plumage of many natural species. I have also noticed a variety of the common pigeon with the wing-bars symmetrically zoned with three bright shades, instead of being simply black on a slaty-blue ground, as in the parent-species.|$|R
50|$|According to Cousens, the doorpost {{mouldings}} on {{the southern}} and eastern doorway are worthy of mention. On {{both sides of the}} southern doorway are four inner bands of scrolls which run up the sides and around {{the lower part of the}} entablature above. Next to these bands, on either side, in the centre, are tall columns or pilasters supporting the lower cornice above. Beyond these columns, on either side, are four more bands of decorative mouldings. On the lintel of the doorway is a dedicatory block containing an image of Gaja-Lakshmi with an elephant on either side. In fact, in the Kannada spoken regions, it is common to find the image of Lakshmi in the dedicatory block on the lintel irrespective of the temple's original dedication; whether the principal deity was Shiva, Vishnu or Jaina. Above the lower cornice, the entablature consists of small figures, now numbering only three (must have been eleven originally) standing under cusped arches. Above these figures is a valance of beads hanging in festoons. According to art historian Cousens, the decoration on the eastern doorway, though not a fine as {{on the southern}} doorway, is worthy of praise for its filigree work. The doorway to the shrine (sanctum) rivals the exterior ones in finish. The dedicatory block on the lintel has an image of Gaja-Lakshmi and her elephants. Above the cornice is a procession of men and animals. These images, which are barely six inches tall, include horsemen and musicians. Above these images are the trinity of Hindu gods: Brahma, Vishnu and Shiva.The ornamentation on the outer wall of the shrine consists of prominent central niches above which is a miniature tower (shikhara or aedicule) which is purely nagara (north Indian) in style and cuts through the principal cornice. The decorative arch above the miniature tower is a conspicuous ornamental feature of the superstructure. The miniature tower - arch combination is repeated up the superstructure of the shrine. The finial (kalasha) and the capping structure of the tower is missing. In the temple hall, the pillars, their capital, and brackets figures above the capital (which include little lions, kirtimukhas and scrolls) are evidence of expert workmanship, the kind found on ivory or silver. The artisans fully availed the workable properties of finely grained stone (soapstone) to produce <b>polished</b> pillars whose <b>shafts</b> have a rounded appearance obtained by using a lathe.|$|R
