40|$|D. Phil. South Africa’s SMMEs are characterised by, {{among other}} challenges, poor <b>management,</b> poor {{entrepreneurial}} <b>performance</b> and low global competitiveness. The Global Entrepreneurial Monitor (GEM) reported that South Africa ranks low {{in terms of}} global competitiveness. This study evaluated the <b>management</b> <b>performance</b> of small, micro- and medium-sized enterprises (SMMEs) in the South African building construction industry, the third largest employer in South Africa. The main research aim was to find {{the reasons for the}} poor <b>management</b> <b>performance</b> of the building construction industry SMMEs and to make recommendations to improve the <b>management</b> <b>performance</b> of these SMMEs. International <b>management</b> <b>performance</b> models were analysed to select an appropriate model to evaluate the respondents’ <b>management</b> <b>performance.</b> The South African Excellence Model (SAEM) was deemed the most appropriate and was selected and used as research instrument. The researcher selected an evaluative, comparative design for the study. A two-part questionnaire was used for data collection. “Part 1 ” questionnaire profiled the sampled SMMEs to identify independent variables that influenced their <b>management</b> <b>performance.</b> The self-assessment performance measurement questionnaire (“Part 2 ” questionnaire) evaluated their <b>management</b> <b>performance.</b> The results of the study were twofold. Firstly, the mean-ranking results that ranked the eleven <b>management</b> <b>performance</b> criteria were tested for equality. <b>Management</b> <b>performance</b> criteria that showed low mean ranks were reasons for the respondents’ poor <b>management</b> <b>performance.</b> Secondly, independence tests identified the factors that influenced the SMMEs’ <b>management</b> <b>performance.</b> The greatest deficiency in terms of <b>management</b> <b>performance</b> was lack of social responsibility amongst SMMEs. The second largest deficiency occurred at business processes, followed by the planning and strategy, people management, and people satisfaction criteria. The most sufficient criterion was customer satisfaction, followed by leadership, customer and market focus, resources and information management and lastly supplier and partnership performance criteria. Hypothesised reasons for the respondents’ poor <b>management</b> <b>performance</b> were tested statistically. Of the five independent variables tested to determine whether they significantly improved the respondents’ <b>management</b> <b>performance,</b> education and technical skills training significantly improved the <b>management</b> <b>performance.</b> Age, gender and race of owner-managers, however, did not. The study recommends strengthening the SACEM by introducing financial management criteria and benchmarking SMMEs’ <b>management</b> <b>performance</b> with industry and world-class best practice. The study found that <b>management</b> <b>performance</b> criteria that showed low scores (social responsibility, business processes, and planning and strategy) require urgent intervention...|$|R
