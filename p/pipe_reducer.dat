5000|$|A {{concentric}} reducer {{is used to}} join pipe sections or tube {{sections on}} the same axis. The concentric reducer is cone-shaped, and is used {{when there is a}} shift in diameter between pipes. For example, when a 1" [...] pipe transitions into a 3/4" [...] pipe and the top or bottom of the pipe doesn't need to remain level. This <b>pipe</b> <b>reducer</b> may be used when there is a single diameter change or multiple diameter changes.Unlike eccentric reducers, concentric reducers have a common center line. Concentric reducers are useful when cavitation is present. Eccentricity occurs when the centerline is offset.|$|E
40|$|Code Case N- 513 {{provides}} evaluation {{rules and}} criteria for temporary acceptance of flaws, including through-wall flaws, in moderate energy piping. The {{application of the}} Code Case is restricted to moderate energy, Class 2 and 3 systems, so that safety issues regarding short-term, degraded system operation are minimized. The first version of the Code Case was published in 1997. Since then, {{there have been three}} revisions to augment and clarify the evaluation requirements and acceptance criteria of the Code Case that have been published by ASME. The technical bases for the original version of the Code Case and the three revisions have been previously published. There is currently work underway to incorporate additional changes to the Code Case and this paper provides the technical basis for the changes proposed in a fourth revision. These changes include addressing the current condition on the Code Case acceptance by the US Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC), clarification of the Code Case applicability limits and expansion of Code Case scope to additional piping components. New flaw evaluation procedures are given for through-wall flaws in elbows, bent <b>pipe,</b> <b>reducers,</b> expanders and branch tees. These procedures evaluate flaws in the piping components as if in straight pipe by adjusting hoop and axial stresses to account for the geometry differences. These changes and their technical bases are described in this paper...|$|R
40|$|AbstractStandard reducer bends has {{structure}} {{function of}} both bend and <b>reducer</b> <b>pipe</b> {{at the same}} time, but there's only few engineering application and relevant report on it. Although lacking in relevant strength design standard, it still has obvious advantage in some individual case. By comparison of analytic formulas of circumferential or longitudinal thin membrane with that of similar structure pipe specified in ASME B 31. 1 - 2012 Power Piping and ASME B 31. 3 - 2011 Process Piping separately under internal stress, we know that these two have almost the same structure form and affected factors. In order to carry out internal pressure strength design of reducer bends, by comparison and analysis of analytic formulas of circumferential and longitudinal thin membrane under internal pressure and test stress measurement under internal pressure, the result shows that analytic formulas value is apparently larger {{so that it is}} conservative to be applied in engineering. This error arises from the difference between ideal model and actual <b>pipe.</b> Actually, <b>reducer</b> bend is belonging to neither the thin wall structure nor the rotated shell of axial symmetry, but a kind of hyperboloidal shell with 2 main curvatures changed gradually complicated. Therefore, it is not appropriate to analyze such kind of reducer bends with the thin membrane theory in thin wall and axial symmetry structure. The reducer bends strength formula derived directly from circumferential stress formula of reducer bends under internal pressure is also conservative. The reducer bends fabricated with the new technology combined with half seamless and half seam has sound quality, and the internal pressure strength is sufficient to meet requirements of fittings used in engineering...|$|R
40|$|Scale {{growth in}} alumina {{refineries}} occurs where supersaturated solutions {{come in contact}} with solid surfaces. Whilst some scale formations may prove beneficial in protecting equipment and pipe surfaces from chemical attack or abrasion, more commonly its deposition results in reduced equipment performance and plant productivity. It is estimated that the direct cost of scale removal may contribute as much as one quarter of the operational costs of an alumina refinery. The rate of scale growth in pipe work, consisting of straight <b>pipes</b> connected by <b>reducers</b> (contractions) located in the precipitation area of an alumina refinery, is approximately 60 % higher in the reducers {{than it is in the}} straight pipes...|$|R
40|$|For {{studies of}} root growth and morphology, an ideal {{containerized}} plant culture system should provide: 1) adequate nutrients, water and oxygen; 2) appropriate mechanical impedance to root elongation; 3) adequate depth to prevent root binding; and 4) easy separation of roots from the root-zone substrate. Columnar containers are preferable to pots {{because they can}} support deep root growth while taking up less bench space. Many columns can be arranged within a small area, such as a gas-exchange chamber, thereby maximizing the number of treatments and replications in a given space. Standard potting substrates typically contain sphagnum peat mixed with perlite or vermiculite. These well-drained, organic-rich mixtures support an appropriate balance of water and oxygen while also providing exchange surfaces for plant nutrients. Separation of plant roots from the potting substrate, however, is impossible. We have developed a columnar plant culture system that supports healthy plant growth while also enabling complete separation of the roots from the growth substrate. Our substrate of choice is Turface®, a porous ceramic produced by baking clay at high temperatures (Figure 1). Turface® drains well, resists compaction, and retains nutrients well with a cation exchange capacity (CEC) of 33 meq/ 100 g. Our columns are constructed of 2 ” diameter PVC <b>pipe.</b> A bell-shaped <b>reducer</b> fitting secured {{to the bottom of}} the pipe stabilizes the column, and also holds in place a mesh screen. The mesh supports the Turface® substrate while also allowing water to drain by gravity. An automated watering system delivers a dilute nutrient solution to each column. The watering system is programmed to add small amounts of nutrient solution at the substrate surface 20 times per day. This high frequency keeps the tops of the columns moist and ensures delivery of nutrients throughout the column...|$|R
