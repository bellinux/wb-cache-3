40|$|Laboratory {{tests on}} {{microscale}} {{are reported in}} which amorphous silica grains were compressed in a liquid environment, namely in solutions with different silica ion concentrations for up to four weeks. Such an arrangement represents an idealized representation of two sand grains. The grain surfaces and asperities were examined in Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) and Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM) for fractures, silica polymer growth, and polymer strength. Single chains of silica polymers are {{found to have a}} failure pulling force of 330 - 450 nN. A chain of observations are reported for the first time, using <b>Pneumatic</b> <b>Grain</b> Indenter and Grain Indenter-Puller apparatuses, confirming a long-existing hypothesis that a stressed contact with microcracks generates dissolved silica in the contact (asperity) vicinity, which eventually polymerizes, forming a structure between the grains on a timescale in the order of weeks. Such structure exhibits intergranular tensile force of 1 - 1. 5 mN when aged in solutions containing silica ion concentrations of 200 - to 500 ppm. Stress appears to accelerate the generation of silica polymers around stressed contact regions, so does mica-silica contacts. The magnitude of intergranular tensile force is 2 to 3 times greater than that of water capillary effect between grains. Dissertatio...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Experimental {{measurements}} during transporting and manipulating with grains {{were carried}} out at post-harvesting line under operational conditions. Measurements {{were carried out}} in Agro Division Selice and POD Abrahám. Effect of the transportation and manipulation on the external quality of grains was evaluated. Grain volume weight, foreign matters, impurities and grain damage were assessed. Obtained results: Manipulation with grain is a big source of grain mechanical damage. Bucket elevators are intended for vertical transportation of grain, they cause crushing the grain leading to breaking kernels rather than to small damages of transported <b>grain.</b> Chain <b>conveyors</b> (redlers) are intended for horizontal transportation of grain. The mechanical damage of grain is particularly observed at the capacity lower than the nominal capacity. Screw conveyors with closed channel are rarely used in post-harvesting lines. They cause large damage of transported grain and therefore absolutely improper for malting barley (sprouts are broken by them) ...|$|R
40|$|Grain and soybean dust {{explosion}} {{was investigated in}} order to determine the conditions that can cause an explosion to take place in a closed space such as in side a <b>grain</b> elevator, <b>conveyor,</b> miller and silo. The main parameters, which were investigated, were minimum ignition temperature, minimum explosible dust concentration, explosion pressure, dust particle size and moisture content. In all the materials and at all moisture contents, a concentration of about 1, 000 g/m^ 3 was observed to give the maximum explosion pressure and maximum rate of pressure rise. The delayed time at this concentration was minimum. At any given dust particle size the ignition temperature was highest in rice husks followed by wheat, corn, milled rice and soybean in ascending order. However, in terms of maximum pressure and maximum rate of pressure rise, the order was from wheat, rice husks, soybean, corn to milled rice in descending order. It was observed that dust particle size played a major role on the explosibility of any dust material. Moisture content affected the ignition temperature and the maximum rate of pressure rise, but did not affect the maximum explosion pressure and delayed time of explosion...|$|R

50|$|Peel {{gave the}} ergot {{business}} the name Universal Laboratories. Production initially began with ergotic rye bought from local farmers. Universal Laboratories staff would then bring the rye through small mills that would {{break up the}} rye kernels. They would then pick the <b>grain</b> from the <b>conveyor</b> belt and let the ergot fall into a receptacle for bagging. The company also hired people to work from their homes in Dassel picking and bagging ergot. Later, the process was improved by new machines that automated the process of separating the ergot from the rye. The grain was passed through mills that would flow into gravity separators, which had spiraling chutes that would separate the light ergot kernels from the heavier rye kernels.|$|R
40|$|The tests {{reported}} in this research were conducted {{to determine the effects}} of those parameters believed to have the greatest influence upon horizontal screw conveyors throughput capacity and power requirement when handling paddy <b>grains.</b> Two screw <b>conveyors</b> with diameters of 20 and 25 cm were evaluated at four screw clearances (6, 9, 12 and 15 mm) and five screw rotational speeds (200, 300, 400, 500 and 600 rpm). The results revealed that for both the conveyors tested, with increasing the screw rotational speed, the conveyor capacity increased and reached to a maximum point and after the point, the volumetric capacity decreased. Increasing the screw speed caused the volumetric efficiency and power requirements of the conveyors to be decreased and increased, respectively. The throughput capacity and power requirement of the conveyors increased (P the auger dimensions. As the screw clearance increased, the throughput capacity and power requirement of the conveyors decreased (P< 0. 01). </p...|$|R
40|$|Summary. The paper {{presents}} an infl uence of air stream fl ow rates in a modifi ed separator with vertical air stream on purifi cation and separation of selected grain mixture. An {{analysis of the}} obtained data on vertical air stream fl ow intensity revealed great variability of grain separation and purifi cation effi ciency. It was found that both air stream intensity and the way and rate of mixture supply into the working area of the separator had the largest infl uence on the course and effi ciency of particular mixture components separation (particularly of light substances). It was observed that precise regulation of air stream fl ow and its wide variability range allowed for an achievement of very good results of purifi cation and separation of the studied grain mixture. The obtained effects resulted in a positive evaluation of the proposed construction of laboratory separator with vertical air stream for effi cient separation of particular components of grain mixture.

5000|$|There {{are many}} options for moving grain from one {{location}} to another. Some of these options include conveyors such as belt conveyors, drag conveyors, screw conveyors, and pneumatic conveyors. Belt conveyors cause the least damage to grain {{due to the}} lack of contact forces, however, they cannot be used for steep inclines. Another commonly used conveyor is screw conveyors. Screw conveyors, also known as augers, are conveyors made from a helical blade with rotational motion to move grain. They are on many types of farm equipment, including combines and grain carts for example. Augers generally have a high power requirements, but are portable and low cost. In addition, augers tend to cause high levels of mechanical damage to the grain. Much research has been completed to quantify the amount of grain damage caused by various screw conveyors. The percentage of grain damage is decreased when the auger is operated at capacity because the grain cannot bounce around and strike surfaces as easily. In addition, grain damage increases with increased rotational speed. For this research with screw conveyors, the angle of the incline was found to have no significant effect on the <b>grain</b> damage.Pneumatic <b>conveyors</b> use a moving air-stream to propel grain, and are used in situations when the path of the grain is complex. Grain damage can occur especially at any changes in the tube path, but can be minimized when air speeds are kept below 25 meters per second. [...] It is shown that grain damage increases exponentially above air velociities of 20 meters per second. [...] In research by Baker et al. breakage levels of maize in pneumatic conveyors were found to be similar to those of bucket or drag conveyors.|$|R
40|$|Selection of {{the optimum}} {{dimensions}} for cross flow <b>pneumatic</b> classifier for <b>grains</b> is very essential. The study reveals {{the use of}} predicted particle trajectory in selecting the dimensions of such classifiers in the x and y planes. Drag and gravitational forces were resolved in 2 D and the acceleration components integrated twice. The resulting displacement equations were solved numerically with MATLAB 3. 1 software using FORTRAN 77. The plot of particle trajectory were also obtained and used as guide for selecting the length and breadth of a separation chamber. The separation chamber was fabricated based on the particle trajectory obtained and tested with threshed cowpea discharged from a thresher unit. It was found that maximum displacement of grains under {{the condition of the}} experiment does not go beyond the boundaries of the separator unit fabricated. Also, in all the experimental cases, almost all the light materials were blown outside the separator chamber. These indicate that the theoretical particle trajectory produced from the MATLAB could be an appropriate parameter for selecting the length and breadth of a separator unit. Particle trajectory is therefore proposed as a tool for selecting the dimensions of cross flow pneumatic classifiers...|$|R
40|$|Introduction and {{objectives}} Although exposure to audible noise has been examined in many publications, {{the sources of}} infrasound in agriculture have not been fully examined and presented. The study presents the assessment of exposure to infrasound from many sources at workplaces in agriculture with examples of possible ergonomic and health consequences caused by such exposure. Material and Methods Workers’-perceived infrasonic noise levels were examined for 118 examples of moving and stationary agricultural machines (modern and old cab-type tractors, old tractors without cabins, small tractors, grinders, chargers, forage mixers, <b>grain</b> cleaners, <b>conveyors,</b> bark sorters and combine-harvesters). Measurements of infrasound were taken {{with the use of}} class 1 instruments (digital sound analyzer DSA- 50 digital and acoustic calibrator). Noise level measurements were performed in accordance with PN-Z- 01338 : 2010, PN-EN ISO 9612 : 2011 and ISO 9612 : 2009. Results and conclusions The most intense sources of infrasound in the study were modern and old large size types agricultural machinery (tractors, chargers and combined-harvesters, and stationary forage mixers with ventilation). The G-weighted infrasound levels were significant and at many analyzed workplaces stayed within or exceeded the occupational exposure limit (L G eq, 8 h = 102 dB) when the duration of exposure is longer than 22 min. / 8 -hours working day (most noisy – modern cab-type tractors), 46 min. / 8 hours working day (most noisy – old type cab-tractors), 73 min. / 8 hours working day (most noisy – old tractors without cabins), 86 min. / 8 -hours working day (most noisy – combine-harvesters) and 156 min. / 8 hours working day (most noisy – stationary forage mixers with ventilation). All measured machines generated infrasonic noise exceeded the value L G eq, Te = 86 dB (occupational exposure limit for workplaces requiring maintained mental concentration). A very important harmful factor is infrasound exposure for pregnant women and adolescents at workplaces in agriculture. Very valuable work can be technical limiting exposure to infrasound from new and used agricultural machinery. The technical limitation of infrasound caused by both old and new agricultural machinery can be invaluable from the work point of view...|$|R
40|$|Previous static bed {{ozonation}} scale-up {{and demonstration}} trials have proven {{the use of}} ozone as an effective technology for grain protection without affecting its end-use quality. Due {{to the lack of}} current availability of high capacity ozone producing generators, grain treatment through static bed ozonation systems are limited to be used in metal silos of capacities smaller than 644 -t. Also, the trials have shown that treatment time has to be of no less than 4 d during application in order to be effective for pest control. Therefore, more efficient ozonation treatment systems are needed for proper ozone usage for stored product protection. The primary objective of these research studies was to design and test a semicontinuous counter-flow ozonation and a continuous ozonation flow treatment systems in order to ozonate grain at faster rates based on the concentration-time product (CTP) of ozone required to achieve 100 % insect mortality and effective mold reduction in grain. The procedure of the counter-flow semicontinuous ozonation system consisted of removing each grain layer inside a metal silo with a tapered unloading auger after each layer reached the desired ozone CTP. The treated grain is subsequently transported to a storage or shipping silo. The continuous ozonation flow system involves applying high ozone concentrations through a modified <b>grain</b> loading screw <b>conveyor</b> where ozone and grain are moving continuously in the same flow direction. The counter-flow semi-continuous ozonation system was successfully tested and proved to be a technically feasible tool for pest control and mold reduction.
