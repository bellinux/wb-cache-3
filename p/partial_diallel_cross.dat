40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{objective}} was to identify phenotypic and genotypic associations, and cause-and-effect relations of secondary components on primary components to establish criteria in the indirect selection process for maize. <b>Partial</b> <b>diallel</b> <b>crosses</b> were conducted in Clevelândia. F 1 's were evaluated in five environments. For the purpose of increasing the yield of corn grain, breeders should seek to reduce the characters distance from the last node to the first branch of the tassel, tassel length and number of branches. The indirect selection for distance from the last node to the first branch of the tassel would be effective to increase the grain yield. The selection for smaller leaf angle, larger stem diameter and thousand grain weight are favorable for increasing grain yield in maize...|$|R

The results showed that crossing affected significantly (P 0. 05). Lingnan chicken was the highest in general combining ability of egg fertility (- 4. 28), while Arab chicken was the highest in hatchability (- 1. 86) and hatching weight (- 2, 12). Crossing of male K x female L was the highest in specific combining ability of fertility (15. 03) and hatchability (15. 70).

40|$|Most of the {{available}} results on optimal block designs for diallel crosses are based on stan-dard linear model assumptions where the general combining ability effects are taken as fixed. In many practical situations, this assumption may not be tenable since often one studies only a sample of inbred lines from a possibly large (hypothetical) population. Recently Ghosh and Das (2003) proposed a random effects model and then estimated the variance components and the variances of these estimates. While comparing the yielding capacities of the cross (i, j), Kempthorne and Curnow (1961) have proposed the estimation of the yielding capacity of any cross based on the least square estimators of the general combining ability effects and/or the mean yield of the cross (i, j). In this paper, the problem of predicting the yielding capacity of the cross (i, j) from the sample of inbred lines has been considered.

The additive variance in viability appears to be too large to be accounted for by recurrent harmful mutants or by overdominant loci at equilibrium with various genetic parameters estimated independently.

Seven agronomic traits were evaluated in three environments while four leaf diseases and incidence of corn stunt were evaluated in one.

Among the heterosis components, in diallel analysis, significance for average heterosis in grain yield, number of days to female flowering and to all evaluated diseases was detected. Specific heterosis was significant for days to female flowering and resistance to Puccinia polysora. Results concerned to grain yield trait indicate that populations with superior performance in dent group, no matter what flint population group is used in crosses, tend to generate superior intervarietal hybrids.

From the experiments using these chromosomes, the following findings were obtained: (1) The frequencies of lethal-carrying chromosomes were 0. 37 {{in the second}} and 0. 55 in the third chromosomes. (2) The size of the population was estimated to be effectively infinite, {{on the basis of the}} allelism rate of lethal-carrying chromosomes. (3) The detrimental and lethal loads for viability were, respectively, 0. 40 and 0. 45 for the second and 0. 52 and 0. 78 for the third chromosomes. Consequently, the detrimental to lethal load ratio is 0. 90 for the second and 0. 67 for the third chromosomes. (4) Lethal genes were shown to be deleterious when heterozygous. (5) The average degree of dominance for mildly deleterious genes (viability polygenes) was estimated to be nearly 0. 5, although the confidence interval is large.

We test our approach with simulated and real data. We show that although the models slightly overestimate genetic variances, main effects are assessed accurately and precisely.

Mutations were accumulated only through males heterozygous for the Pm-carrying chromosomes [In(2 LR) bwV 1] and the extracted second chromosomes, and the genetic variance components were estimated by using a <b>partial</b> <b>diallel</b> <b>cross</b> method. —Further investigations clarified that chromosome abberations occurred at a frequency of 0. 0114 per second chromosome per generation (inversions: 0. 0098; transpositions: 0. 0011; translocations: 0. 0004), and recessive lethal mutations occurred at an average rate of 0. 031 per second chromosome per generation. —From these results and from the amount of change in the homozygous load, it was speculated that about 60 – 70 % of the second chromosomes used had a kind of mutator which induced chromosome and/or chromatid breaks at a minimum rate of 0. 18 per second chromosome per generation. These breaks resulted in recessive lethal mutations at a rate more than ten times higher than the normal rate. Also these breaks were most probably the cause of male recombination. —The above unusual increase in dominance variance can be explained by assuming that chromosome segments, introduced into the extracted "wild" chromosomes by male recombinations (double cross-over) from the marker chromosomes [In(2 LR) bwV 1], showed heterosis and linkage disequilibria with deleterious mutations and possibly with other introduced segments. —Finally, the nature and possible significance of mutator factors are discussed...|$|E

Considering a random sample of n lines from base population I, and that each line is crossed with s lines from opposite population II, there will be ns sampled crosses that are evaluated experimentally. The means of the ns sampled crosses and the remaining n(n - s) crosses can be predicted by the reduced model where Yij is the mean of the cross between line i (i = 1, 2, [...] .,n) of population I and line j (j = 1 ', 2 ', [...] .,n') of population II; µ is the general mean, and gi and gj refer to general combining ability effects of lines from populations I and II, respectively. Specific combining ability (Sij) is estimated by the difference. The sequence of crosses for each line (i) is [i x j], [i x (j + 1) ], [i x (j + 2) ], [...] ., [i x (j + s - 1) ], starting with i = j = 1 for convenience. Any j + s - 1 > n is reduced by subtracting n.

40|$|URL] clover (Trifolium repens L.) is {{a member}} of the Leguminosae {{flowering}} plant family and is used as a high quality forage crop capable of fixing atmospheric nitrogen. It is an amphidiploid (2 n = 4 x = 32) species constructed of two ancestral genomes, T. palescens and T. occidentale. T. repens possesses a self-incompatibility mechanism which prevents self-seed setting. The self-incompatibility reaction is contolled by a single poly-allelic locus expressed gametophytically in the male, where common allele specificity in pollen and stylar expressed genes results in late-acting, pre-fertilisation arrest of pollentube growth (Atwood, 1940). Based on the assumption that both parents were heterozygous for unique S-alleles, ninety four individuals of a bi-parental mapping family were classified into four intra-incompatible groupings from <b>partial</b> <b>diallel</b> <b>crosses</b> and pod-filling assessments six to nine days post-pollination of emasculated florets. Initial analysis of the two parental maps based on AFLP and SSR markers has identified marker associations with the S-locus attributing it to linkage group E 2 as classified by Barrett et al (2004). To date, 12, 8, 6 and 16 plants have been assigned the S genotypes S 13, S 14, S 23 and S 24 respectively.

40|$|Fusarium wilt of strawberry, incited by Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. fragariae (Fof), {{is a major}} {{disease of}} the {{cultivated}} strawberry (Fragaria xananassa) worldwide. An increase in disease outbreaks of the pathogen in Western Australia and Queensland plus the search for alternative disease management strategies place emphasis {{on the development of}} resistant cultivars. In response, a <b>partial</b> incomplete <b>diallel</b> <b>cross</b> involving four parents was performed for use in glasshouse resistance screenings. The resulting progeny were evaluated for their susceptibility to Fof. Best-performing progeny and suitability of progenies as parents were determined using data from disease severity ratings and analyzed using a linear mixed model incorporating a pedigree to produce best linear unbiased predictions of breeding values. Variation in disease response, ranging from highly susceptible to resistant, indicates a quantitative effect. The estimate of the narrow-sense heritability was 0. 49 +/- 0. 04 (SE), suggesting the population should be responsive to phenotypic recurrent selection. Several progeny genotypes have predicted breeding values higher than any of the parents. Knowledge of Fof resistance derived from this study can help select best parents for future crosses for the development of new strawberry cultivars with Fof resistance...|$|R

Foram avaliados 13 parentais e 40 populações provenientes de um dialelo parcial, nas gerações F 1 e F 2 em condições de campo, em Lavras e Patos de Minas, MG, com as semeaduras feitas no verão (fevereiro) e no inverno (maio). Houve diferença de tolerância ao calor entre os parentais e entre as populações híbridas quanto ao caráter produção de grãos, e ambos os efeitos aditivos e não-aditivos foram importantes no controle genético deste caráter na presença ou ausência de calor. Apesar da ocorrência de interações populações x épocas de semeadura, a alta repetibilidade dos efeitos da capacidade geral de combinação permite inferir a possibilidade de acelerar os programas de melhoramento na região, efetuando-se a seleção tanto na época de verão quanto no inverno. The {{objective}} of this work was to get information about the genetic control of the grain yield under heat stress conditions, the tolerance of cultivar and the identification of promising segregation populations for selections of lines adapted to {{the conditions of the}} central region of Brazil. Thirteen parents and 40 populations in F 1 and F 2 generations derived by <b>partial</b> <b>diallel</b> <b>crosses</b> were evaluated. The experiments were conducted under field conditions in Lavras and Patos de Minas, MG, Brazil, sowing the seeds in the summertime (February) and in the winter (May). There was difference of heat tolerance among parents and hybrid populations for grain yield character, and both additive and non-additive effects were important in the genetic control of grain yield character in {{the presence or absence of}} heat. In spite of the occurrence of populations x sowing time interactions, the high repeatability of the effects of the general combining ability suggests the possibility of the selection in the summertime and winter facilitating to advance the breeding programs in the region...|$|R

Foram usadas três cultivares (M-Soy 8400, CD 201, CD 206) de alta e três (CD 215, CD 202, Savana) de baixa qualidade fisiológica, para se obterem sementes híbridas F 1 e F 2, {{inclusive}} os recíprocos, pelo sistema de cruzamento dialelo parcial e as linhagens parentais. Os parâmetros primeira contagem de germinação, contagem final de germinação e velocidade de germinação, utilizados para avaliação da qualidade fisiológica, podem ser correlacionados com o teor de lignina. Foram observadas correlações positivas entre o teor de lignina e a percentagem de plântulas normais no teste de envelhecimento ao 5 º e 11 º dias após a semeadura, com valores maiores de correlação no 5 º dia. A correlação entre velocidade de germinação e teor de lignina foi negativa. A análise do dialelo apontou significância do efeito recíproco, o que indica que a espessura das camadas da testa e a espessura de lignina nessas camadas podem ser explicadas pelo efeito materno. The {{objective of}} this work was to evaluate the additive and non-additive genetic effects for thickness of the seed coat layers and of the lignin present in them, and to verify if the characters {{used to evaluate the}} physiological quality of the seeds is correlated with the lignin content. Three cultivars (M-Soy 8400, CD 201, CD 206) with high and three (CD 215, CD 202, Savana) with low physiological quality were used to obtain F 1 and F 2 hybrid seeds, including the reciprocals, using <b>partial</b> <b>diallel</b> <b>crosses</b> and the parental lines. First germination count, final germination count and germination rate, used to evaluate the physiological quality, can be correlated with lignin content. Positive correlations were observed between lignin content and the percentage of normal seedlings in the aging test at the 5 th and 11 th days after sowing, with the highest correlation values at the 5 th day. The correlation between germination rate and lignin content was negative. The diallel analysis showed reciprocal effect, showing that the thickness of the seed coat layers and of the lignin contained in these layers can be explained by maternal effect...|$|R
40|$|Given {{the growing}} {{importance}} of the saladette fresh tomato market in Brazil, {{the objective of this}} paper was to assess the combining abilities of lines potentially useful as parents of hybridsin this class. The experiment consisted of 28 genotypes, 18 hybrids from a <b>partial</b> <b>diallel</b> crossobtained from <b>crossing</b> two groups of tomato lines (Group I, with 9 parents, and Group II, with 2 parents), 8 F 1 experimental hybrids, and 2 commercial checks. Traits evaluated were total yield, mean fruit mass, fruit shelf life, shape and percentsoluble solids. Additive genetic effects were generally more important than non-additive effects for all traits evaluated. The TOM- 542 and TOM- 734 lines, from group I, and the TOM- 720 line, from group II, presented high general combining ability (GCA) estimates for most of the traits of importance for saladette tomatoes, and were therefore considered suitable parents of hybrids of this class. Higher fruit shelf life of TOM- 723 as a parental line compared with TOM- 720 (Group II), was mainly attributed to the presence in the former of the norA allele, which controls longer fruit shelf life. F 1 hybrids (TOM- 542 x TOM- 720), (TOM- 580 x TOM- 720), (TOM- 734 x TOM- 720), and (TOM- 727 x TOM- 720) showed good performance and fruit quality and thus constitute possible commercial varieties.
