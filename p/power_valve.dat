5000|$|<b>Power</b> <b>valves</b> (tubes) can be overdriven in {{the same}} way that {{pre-amplifier}} valves can, but because these valves are designed to output more power, the distortion and character they add to the guitar's tone is unique. During the 1960s to early 1970s, distortion was primarily created by overdriving the <b>power</b> <b>valves.</b> Because they have become accustomed to this sound , many guitar players [...] favour this type of distortion, and thus set their amps to maximum levels in order to drive the power section hard. Many valve-based amplifiers in common use have a push-pull output configuration in their power section, with matched pairs of tubes driving the output transformer. Power amplifier distortion is normally entirely symmetric, generating predominantly odd-order harmonics.|$|R

30|$|There is {{no common}} {{accepted}} way for calculating the <b>valve</b> <b>power</b> loss of modular multilevel converter (MMC). <b>Valve</b> <b>power</b> loss estimation based on analytical calculation is inaccurate {{to address the}} switching <b>power</b> loss and <b>valve</b> <b>power</b> loss estimation based on detailed electro-magnetic simulation is of low speed. To solve this problem, a method of <b>valve</b> <b>power</b> loss estimation based on the detailed equivalent simulation model of MMC is proposed. Results of <b>valve</b> <b>power</b> loss analysis of 201 -level 500 MW MMC operating at 50 Hz~ 1000 Hz are presented. It is seen that the <b>valve</b> <b>power</b> loss of a MMC increased by 12, 40 and 93 % under 200 Hz, 500 Hz and 1000 Hz operating frequency. The article concludes that in a device with isolated inner AC system, MMC operating at higher frequency will be more competitive than typical 50 Hz/ 60 Hz MMC with moderate increase of operating power loss and significant reduction {{of the size of}} the AC components.|$|R

25|$|Marshall {{currently}} manufactures a professional, all-valve bass rig {{called the}} VBA400. It houses eight 6550 <b>power</b> <b>valves</b> plus three ECC83 and one ECC82 preamp valves.

30|$|Currently, {{there are}} no {{commonly}} accepted standards for determining the power loss for MMC. The IEC has a draft standard (IEC 62751) in preparation [5]. An intuitive way of obtaining the <b>valve</b> <b>power</b> loss <b>valve</b> <b>power</b> losses of a converter station is comparing the measured power at the AC side and the DC side. However, {{the difference between these}} two measured values is small, and a good accuracy will be very difficult to reach [5]. Also, such method is not able to observe the distribution of value power loss and the factors that impact <b>valve</b> <b>power</b> losses. For most cases, therefore, the losses have to be estimated from component characteristics, using suitable mathematical models of the converters [6]. From traditional PWM modulated two-level and three-level voltage source converter (VSC), the <b>valve</b> <b>power</b> loss can be obtained analytically [7, 8]. <b>valve</b> <b>power</b> lossvalve power losses The analytical method requires variables such as power factor, dc voltage, valve current and switching occasion of the semiconductors.|$|R
5000|$|Subsequent {{amplifiers}} {{from the}} company all used the same circuit topology as the TL/12, but took advantage of newer more efficient <b>power</b> <b>valves</b> and the so-called [...] "ultra-linear" [...] connection of the output stage to obtain higher power output with triode-like characteristics. These amplifiers included the TL/10, TL/25, TL/12-Plus, TL/25-Plus, TL/50-Plus, and the Stereo 20, Stereo 50 and Stereo 60.|$|R
50|$|The unique {{feature that}} gave the 1989 and onward models their Exup name (for Exhaust Ultimate <b>Power</b> <b>Valve)</b> was Yamaha's {{four-stroke}} <b>power</b> <b>valve</b> system, a servo motor-driven exhaust valve. This allowed large bore exhaust header pipes (for excellent gas flow at high engine speeds) coupled with the valve restricting flow at lower revs, to speed the gas through. It gave pulling power from low revs, seamlessly, up to the red line at 11,500 rpm. It also allowed extremely radical high lift cams that gave a very lumpy idle when unplugged {{in the open position}} or when using a full aftermarket exhaust. Yamaha used this valve system on the YZF models which followed (Thunderace) and the R1 models from 1998.|$|E
50|$|<b>Power</b> <b>valve</b> {{actuation}} can be by mechanical (RPM dependent) {{or electric}} (servo motor) means increasingly with electronic control. Electronic control offers {{a greater degree}} of accuracy as well as being able to vary the opening of the valve and be tuned to conditions.|$|E
5000|$|All <b>power</b> <b>valve</b> systems {{vary the}} {{duration}} of the exhaust port open time, which gives the engine usable low end power combined with excellent top end power. Manufacturers have also included sub exhaust chambers that extend the 'tuned length' of the expansion chamber.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Power</b> <b>valves</b> {{typically}} {{operate at}} higher voltages and lower currents than transistors - although solid state operating voltages have steadily increased with modern device technologies. High RF power radio transmitters {{in use today}} operate in the kilovolt range, where {{there is still no}} other comparable technology available. (= volts * amps, so high power requires: high volts, high amps, or both) ...|$|R
50|$|Although the {{frequency}} ranges for audio amplifiers and RF amplifiers overlap, {{the class of}} operation, method of output coupling and percent operational bandwidth will differ. <b>Power</b> <b>valves</b> are capable of high frequency response, up to at least 30 MHz. Indeed, many of the Directly Heated Single Ended Triode (DH-SET) audio amplifiers use radio transmitting valves originally designed to operate as RF amplifiers in the high frequency range.|$|R
50|$|Control {{methods for}} a three-level {{inverter}} only allow two switches {{of the four}} switches in each leg to simultaneously change conduction states. This allows smooth commutation and avoids shoot through by only selecting valid states. It may {{also be noted that}} since the DC bus voltage is shared by at least two <b>power</b> <b>valves,</b> their voltage ratings can be less than a two-level counterpart.|$|R
50|$|Only class A {{can be used}} in {{single-ended}} mode, as part of {{the signal}} would otherwise be cut off. The driver stage for class AB2 and B valve amplifiers must be capable of supplying some signal current to the <b>power</b> <b>valve</b> grids ("driving power").|$|E
50|$|Because {{driving the}} power valves this hard also means maximum volume, {{which can be}} {{difficult}} to manage in a small recording or rehearsal space, many solutions have emerged that in some way divert some of this <b>power</b> <b>valve</b> output from the speakers, and allow the player to generate <b>power</b> <b>valve</b> distortion without excessive volume. These include built-in or separate power attenuators and power-supply-based power attenuation, such as a VVR, or Variable Voltage Regulator to drop the voltage on the valves' plates, to increase distortion whilst lowering volume. Guitarists such as Edward Van Halen have been known to use variacs before VVR technology was invented. Lower-power valve amps (such as a quarter-watt or less), speaker isolation cabinets, and low-efficiency guitar speakers are also used to tame the volume.|$|E

30|$|The {{method of}} [12] is accurate, {{except that it}} is based on {{detailed}} switching model of MMC and therefore the <b>valve</b> <b>power</b> loss estimation requires significant of simulation time. It may take one week to simulate 5 -seconds dynamics of a 401 -level MMC [13]. Therefore, the <b>valve</b> <b>power</b> loss evaluation based on detailed switching model is time consuming and inconvenient to analyze the impacts affecting <b>valve</b> <b>power</b> loss of MMC, which typically involves repeatedly simulation. To solve such challenges, a <b>valve</b> <b>power</b> loss evaluation method based on fast MMC simulation model is proposed in this paper.|$|R
50|$|When first developed, ECP brakes {{needed a}} number of wires along the train to control {{solenoids}} on each wagon to release the brakes, and were not considered economic for freight. This has changed {{with the introduction of}} electronic controls, allowing data to be transmitted by two-conductor wire or radio from the locomotive to a microprocessor on each car, where locally <b>powered</b> <b>valves</b> hold the desired pressure in each brake cylinder.|$|R
50|$|From the 1970s {{the silicon}} {{transistor}} became increasingly pervasive. Valve production was sharply decreased, with {{the notable exception}} of cathode ray tubes (CRTs), and a reduced range of valves for amplifier applications. Popular low power tubes were dual triodes (ECCnn, 12Ax7 series) plus the EF86 pentode, and <b>power</b> <b>valves</b> were mostly being beam tetrode and pentodes (EL84, EL34, KT88 / 6550, 6L6), in both cases with indirect heating. This reduced set of types remains the core of valve production today.|$|R
