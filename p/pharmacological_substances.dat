50|$|A core {{premise of}} {{evolutionary}} {{theory is that}} a trait cannot evolve unless it contributes to an individual’s reproductive fitness. Proponents of the pharmacophagy hypothesis/medicinal model of drug use suggest that that pharmacophagy, the consumption of <b>pharmacological</b> <b>substances</b> for medicinal purposes, evolved in the backdrop of human-plant coevolution {{as a means of}} self-medication. Theorists propose that the reason humans learned to ignore the cues of plant toxicity (e.g. bitter taste) and consumed potentially lethal substances with little to no energetic content because ingesting the bioactive compounds of plants in small amounts was therapeutic.|$|E
50|$|In pharmacokinetics, {{effective}} half-life is {{the rate}} of accumulation or elimination of a biochemical or pharmacological substance in an organism, the biological half-life, when the kinetics are governed by multiple independent mechanisms. This is seen when there are multiple mechanisms of elimination, or when the drug occupies multiple pharmacological compartments. It reflects {{the cumulative effect of}} the individual half-lives, as observed by the changes in the actual serum concentration of a drug under a given dosing regimen. The complexity of biological systems means that most <b>pharmacological</b> <b>substances</b> do not have a single mechanisms of elimination, and hence the observed or effective half-life does not reflect that of a single process, but rather the summation of multiple independent processes.|$|E

[...] Chemical {{stimulation of the}} spinal cord is administered through the microfluidic channel of the e-dura. The e-dura implants, unlike previous surface implants, closely mimic the physical properties of living tissue and can deliver electric impulses and <b>pharmacological</b> <b>substances</b> simultaneously. Artificial dura mater was constructed through the utilization of PDMS and gelatin hydrogel. The hydrogel simulates spinal tissue and a silicone membrane simulates the dura mater. These properties allow the e-dura implants to sustain long-term application to the spinal cord and brain without leading to inflammation, scar tissue buildup, and rejection normally caused by surface implants rubbing against nerve tissue.|$|E
50|$|Cys-loop receptors have {{structural}} {{elements that are}} well conserved, with a large extracellular domain (ECD) harboring an alpha-helix and 10 beta-strands. Following the ECD, four transmembrane segments (TMSs) are connected by intracellular and extracellular loop structures. Except the TMS 3-4 loop, their lengths are only 7-14 residues. The TMS 3-4 loop forms the largest part of the intracellular domain (ICD) and exhibits the most variable region between all of these homologous receptors. The ICD {{is defined by the}} TMS 3-4 loop together with the TMS 1-2 loop preceding the ion channel pore. Crystallization has revealed structures for some members of the family, but to allow crystallization, the intracellular loop was usually replaced by a short linker present in prokaryotic cys-loop receptors, so their structures as not known. Nevertheless, this intracellular loop appears to function in desensitization, modulation of channel physiology by <b>pharmacological</b> <b>substances,</b> and posttranslational modifications. Motifs important for trafficking are therein, and the ICD interacts with scaffold proteins enabling inhibitory synapse formation.|$|E
50|$|There {{are three}} main {{techniques}} currently used to disrupt retinal waves: intraocular injection of <b>pharmacological</b> <b>substances</b> that alter wave patterns, use of immunotoxins that eliminate certain classes of amacrine cells, {{or use of}} knockout mouse lines that have altered spontaneous firing patterns. There are several pharmacological agents {{that can be used}} to disrupt retinal activity. Tetrodotoxin (TTX) can be injected near the optic tract to block incoming retinal activity in addition to the outgoing activity of lateral geniculate neurons. Intraocular injections of epibatidine, a cholinergic agonist, can be used to block spontaneous firing in half of all retinal ganglion cells and cause uncorrelated firing in the remaining half. Effects of the pharmacological agents on retinal ganglion cell activity are observed using either MEA or calcium imaging.Immunotoxins can be used to target starburst amacrine cells. Starburst amacrine cells are retinal interneurons responsible for cholinergic retinal waves. The third method is to use knockout mice with altered spontaneous firing patterns. The most common line of mouse for this method is the neuronal nicotinic acetylcholine receptor beta-2 subunit knockout (β2-nAChR-KO). β2-nAChR-KO mice have been observed to have reduced eye-specific retinotopic refinement similar to epitbatidine injection as well as no correlated waves, as observed with calcium imaging and MEA recording.|$|E

40|$|We {{describe}} a near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) method for fast-screening Viagra tablets, counterfeit Viagra tablets, and imitations of Viagra. The method can (1) check the homogeneity of a batch; (2) distinguish counterfeits and imitations from authentic Viagra; (3) screen {{for the presence}} of sildenafil citrate, the pharmacologically active substance in Viagra, irrespectively of the excipients present; (4) and detect whether similar samples have been previously analysed. We applied the method to 103 samples with a diversity of appearance, chemical composition, and origin.

40|$|AbstractThe {{management}} of drug–drug interactions (DDIs) {{is a critical}} issue resulting from the overwhelming amount of information available on them. Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques can provide an interesting {{way to reduce the}} time spent by healthcare professionals on reviewing biomedical literature. However, NLP techniques rely mostly on the availability of the annotated corpora. While there are several annotated corpora with biological entities and their relationships, {{there is a lack of}} corpora annotated with <b>pharmacological</b> <b>substances</b> and DDIs. Moreover, other works in this field have focused in pharmacokinetic (PK) DDIs only, but not in pharmacodynamic (PD) DDIs. To address this problem, we have created a manually annotated corpus consisting of 792 texts selected from the DrugBank database and other 233 Medline abstracts. This fined-grained corpus has been annotated with a total of 18, 502 <b>pharmacological</b> <b>substances</b> and 5028 DDIs, including both PK as well as PD interactions. The quality and consistency of the annotation process has been ensured through the creation of annotation guidelines and has been evaluated by the measurement of the inter-annotator agreement between two annotators. The agreement was almost perfect (Kappa up to 0. 96 and generally over 0. 80), except for the DDIs in the MedLine database (0. 55 – 0. 72). The DDI corpus has been used in the SemEval 2013 DDIExtraction challenge as a gold standard for the evaluation of information extraction techniques applied to the recognition of <b>pharmacological</b> <b>substances</b> and the detection of DDIs from biomedical texts. DDIExtraction 2013 has attracted wide attention with a total of 14 teams from 7 different countries. For the task of recognition and classification of pharmacological names, the best system achieved an F 1 of 71. 5 %, while, for the detection and classification of DDIs, the best result was F 1 of 65. 1 %. These results show that the corpus has enough quality to be used for training and testing NLP techniques applied to the field of Pharmacovigilance.
