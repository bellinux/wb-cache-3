5000|$|They were {{designed}} by Marc de Caso, an engineer working in the company's engineering design office. They were equipped with the same boiler as the Nord's [...] "Superpacifics" [...] (3.1251 to 3.1290) They also had [...] "Cossart" [...] type rotary cam <b>actuated</b> <b>valve</b> <b>gear.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{locomotives}} had 1+1/4 {{in thick}} plate frames and piston <b>valves,</b> <b>actuated</b> by Walschaerts <b>valve</b> <b>gear.</b>|$|R
5000|$|The {{cylinders}} {{were arranged}} horizontally outside the plate frames, while the flat [...] "D" [...] type slide valves were arranged above the cylinders and <b>actuated</b> by Walschaerts <b>valve</b> <b>gear.</b>|$|R
50|$|The engine's {{cylinders}} {{were arranged}} outside the plate frames and the piston valves, arranged above the cylinders, were <b>actuated</b> by Walschaerts <b>valve</b> <b>gear.</b> The coach was fitted throughout with Stone system electric lights.|$|R
50|$|Their {{cylinders}} were inclined {{and arranged}} outside the 7/8 in plate frames. The steam chests were arranged between the frames and the unbalanced slide <b>valves</b> were <b>actuated</b> by Stephenson <b>valve</b> <b>gear</b> through rocker shafts.|$|R
50|$|The {{locomotives}} {{were the}} first in South Africa to be equipped with Belpaire fireboxes. The cylinders were arranged outside the plate frames, while the valves were arranged above the cylinders and <b>actuated</b> by Walschaerts <b>valve</b> <b>gear.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{cylinders}} {{were arranged}} outside the 1+3/8 in thick plate frames, {{with the flat}} D type balanced slide valves arranged above the cylinders and <b>actuated</b> by Walschaerts <b>valve</b> <b>gear,</b> {{the first time that}} this type of motion was used in Natal.|$|R
50|$|The {{locomotive}} used Murdoch's D unbalanced slide valves, arranged horizontally {{above the}} cylinders outside the plate frames and <b>actuated</b> by Heusinger <b>valve</b> <b>gear.</b> These <b>valves</b> caused considerable wear on motion pins and were later replaced by Trick ported balanced slide valves.|$|R
50|$|The {{cylinders}} {{were arranged}} outside the plate frames and the 6 in diameter trick-ported piston valves, designed for inside admission, were <b>actuated</b> by Walschaerts <b>valve</b> <b>gear.</b> Each engine unit {{was equipped with}} an independent Wakefield mechanical lubricator to supply oil to the valves and pistons.|$|R
50|$|The locomotive's slide valves were {{arranged}} above the inclined cylinders and were <b>actuated</b> by Joy <b>valve</b> <b>gear,</b> {{which had been}} invented in 1879 by David Joy, the Locomotive Superintendent of the Oxford, Dorchester and Wolverhampton Railway. Joy <b>valve</b> <b>gear</b> did not make use of eccentrics like the Stephenson Link <b>valve</b> <b>gear</b> which had hitherto been used and which, at times, proved to be troublesome.|$|R
50|$|The {{cylinders}} {{were arranged}} outside the bar frame, with balanced slide <b>valves</b> above, <b>actuated</b> by Stephenson <b>valve</b> <b>gear</b> through rocker shafts. The locomotives were delivered with type XF tenders, which rode on 2-axle bogies {{and had a}} capacity of 10 lt t coal and 3000 imp gal water.|$|R
5000|$|The engines had bar frames, {{with the}} {{cylinders}} arranged outside the frames and <b>actuated</b> by Stephenson <b>valve</b> <b>gear.</b> Their saddle-tanks had a 200 imp gal water capacity. Their operating boiler pressure {{was set at}} [...] {{and they had a}} 1950 lbf kN tractive effort at 75% of boiler pressure.|$|R
50|$|Of {{the mixed}} amalgam of {{locomotives}} which were inherited from these railways, the best {{was probably the}} 8th Class 4-8-0, designed by H.M. Beatty of the Cape Government Railways (CGR). These locomotives were brand new, having been acquired by the IMR shortly {{before the end of}} the war, and featured a bar frame, narrow firebox and cylinders with overhead slide <b>valves</b> <b>actuated</b> by Stephenson <b>valve</b> <b>gear.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{locomotives}} had bar {{frames and}} used saturated steam. They had balanced slide valves, arranged above the cylinders and <b>actuated</b> by Stephenson <b>valve</b> <b>gear</b> through rocker shafts. The firebox was fitted with Stroudley's flexible stays {{and the back}} casing plate was flanged outwards to facilitate {{the removal of the}} internal firebox for renewals.|$|R
5000|$|The {{engine was}} built on 5/8 in thick plate frames, {{arranged}} outside the coupled wheels. It had a boiler with an inside diameter of 2 ft, set at an operating pressure of [...] Its inclined cylinders were arranged outside the plate frames and had a bore of 6 in and a 10 in stroke. It used Murdoch's D type slide <b>valves,</b> <b>actuated</b> by Stephenson <b>valve</b> <b>gear</b> through rocker arms.|$|R
50|$|The {{cylinders}} {{were arranged}} outside the plate frames, with the piston valves above the cylinders and <b>actuated</b> by Walschaerts <b>valve</b> <b>gear.</b> The boilers were equipped with superheaters and had Belpaire fireboxes. The engines were delivered new with Type MP1 tenders with a 10 lt t coal capacity and a 4250 imp gal water capacity.|$|R
50|$|The {{locomotives}} had inside cylinders, arranged at an incline, with slide <b>valves</b> {{which were}} <b>actuated</b> by Stephenson <b>valve</b> <b>gear</b> through rocker shafts. The cylinders and <b>valve</b> <b>gear</b> were placed between the plate frames and {{hidden from view}} by the wheels, which were coupled with external connecting rods. Together with the Cape Town Railway & Dockâ€™s Blackie of 1859, these were the only two-cylinder locomotives with an inside cylinder and <b>valve</b> <b>gear</b> arrangement to see service in South Africa.|$|R
5000|$|The {{locomotive}} had flat [...] "D" [...] type sliding <b>valves</b> {{which were}} <b>actuated</b> by Heusinger <b>valve</b> <b>gear,</b> with Laird type crossheads with single slide bars. To protect the motion from wind-blown {{sand in the}} Namib Desert, it had plate shields arranged along {{the full length of}} the engine, hinged on the running board to allow access to the motion.|$|R
50|$|The {{cylinders}} {{were arranged}} outside the bar frames, with balanced Richardson type D slide valves arranged above the cylinders and <b>actuated</b> by Stephenson <b>valve</b> <b>gear</b> through rocker shafts. The hind {{frame of the}} engine was of the plate type and was widened out to receive the Belpaire firebox, which itself was a notable departure from the usual practice of the CGR to use round-topped fireboxes.|$|R
50|$|The {{superheated}} Class FC had 7 {{in diameter}} piston <b>valves</b> <b>actuated</b> by Walschaerts <b>valve</b> <b>gear,</b> and a 7/8 in thick plate frame. The aim with the experimental locomotive {{was to compare}} the performance and maintenance requirements of the Modified Fairlie {{to that of a}} Garratt, in particular to the Class GC 2-6-2+2-6-2 Double Prairie type Garratt which was similar in both size and mechanical respects. Hence, also, the experimental Modified Fairlie's Class FC designation, skipping the FA and FB classifications which were never used by the SAR.|$|R
50|$|The compact little {{locomotive}} {{was completely}} enclosed and the chimney extended through the roof. The inclined cylinders were arranged between the plate frames, while the slide valves above the cylinders were arranged horizontally and <b>actuated</b> by Joy <b>valve</b> <b>gear.</b> The regulator handle was fitted {{to the side}} of the steam dome and controlled from that position, while the firebox door was also arranged on the side of the firebox.|$|R
5000|$|The locomotive's {{cylinders}} {{were arranged}} outside the frame, while the slide valves were arranged between the frames and <b>actuated</b> by Stephenson <b>valve</b> <b>gear</b> link motion through rocker shafts. The boiler dome was arranged above the firebox, with two Salter safety valves which were adjusted {{to blow off}} at [...] The locomotive was equipped with a No. 40 combination ejector and two vacuum brake cylinders, each 15 in in diameter.|$|R
40|$|The {{method of}} {{mathematical}} modeling of valve spring {{with the help}} of hull girder is presented. The technique of solution of equation of engine valve spring coil oscillations using numerical integration is generally considered. The analysis of theoretical and experimental research of VAZ valve spring coil oscillations by the example of rigid <b>valve</b> <b>actuating</b> <b>gear</b> is also given...|$|R
50|$|The {{builders}} {{chose not}} {{to adhere to the}} original designs and specifications. The cylinder stroke was reduced to 20 in and two inner cylinders of the same dimensions were added to drive the rack mechanism independently. A plate frame was used instead of the specified bar frame. The main plate frames were 1+1/4 in thick and were arranged outside the coupled wheels. The balanced flat slide <b>valves</b> were <b>actuated</b> by Joy <b>valve</b> <b>gear.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{cylinders}} {{were arranged}} outside the 4 in thick bar frames, while the piston valves, arranged above the cylinders, were <b>actuated</b> by Walschaerts <b>valve</b> <b>gear.</b> Reversing was effected {{by means of}} a screw gear. The locomotive had a Belpaire firebox and, instead of the usual deep bridle casting, was built with a shallow casting and frame under the firebox. This permitted all firebox stays to be removed without lifting the boiler from the frame.|$|R
50|$|The locomotives, {{numbered}} in {{the range}} from 1366 to 1369, were in essence a lighter branch line development of the earlier Classes 15CB and 15CA heavy 4-8-2 mainline locomotives and proved to be extremely successful. They were approximately 50% more powerful than the Class 8 family and also had better speed with their larger diameter coupled wheels. They were superheated, built on bar frames and their piston <b>valves</b> were <b>actuated</b> by Walschaerts <b>valve</b> <b>gear.</b>|$|R
50|$|The piston <b>valves</b> were <b>actuated</b> by Walschaerts <b>valve</b> <b>gear</b> and the {{standard}} SAR type steam reversing gear was arranged on the right-hand side. The engine and tender were both equipped with vacuum brakes and the engine's two 21 in diameter vacuum cylinders were arranged outside the engine's frame and under the running boards, one on either side. The <b>valve</b> <b>gear,</b> brake gear and coupled wheel hubs were soft grease lubricated, while the bronze axle boxes had hard grease lubrication. The leading and trailing bogies were fitted with roller bearing axle boxes while the tender's bogies used plain bearings.|$|R
50|$|In 1885, Baldwin Locomotive Works built New Zealand's fourth {{batch of}} Prairie locomotives. These {{were to become}} the NZR N class. Six were {{delivered}} in 1885 and were of an almost identical design to the previous, but altered to utilise off-the-shelf components supplied by Baldwin. In 1901, four more were built for the NZR, but these were fitted with piston <b>valves</b> <b>actuated</b> by Walschaerts <b>valve</b> <b>gear.</b> In 1891, two of these locomotives had also been built to the same design for the WMR. In 1908, with {{the purchase of the}} WMR by NZR, all of these engines were classified as N class.|$|R
50|$|The {{locomotives}} had inclined cylinders, arranged {{outside the}} plate frames. The piston <b>valves</b> were <b>actuated</b> by Walschaerts <b>valve</b> <b>gear,</b> while the reversing gear {{was controlled by}} a combination of hand and steam mechanism. The locomotives were superheated and their smokeboxes were equipped with Stone's Patent louvre spark arrestors. Their coupled wheel axleboxes were provided with mechanical force-feed lubrication. They were the first locomotives in South Africa to be equipped with exhaust steam injectors, which were of the Davies and Metcalfe pattern.|$|R
50|$|When introduced, these engines {{were up to}} {{date with}} {{contemporary}} locomotive practice. They were superheated, with Belpaire fireboxes. The cylinders were arranged outside the plate frames, with the 10 in diameter outside admission piston valves arranged above the cylinders and <b>actuated</b> by Walschaerts <b>valve</b> <b>gear.</b> The drivers and intermediate coupled wheels were flangeless. The motion, axleboxes and several other details were identical or similar to equivalent parts of the Class 10, which was built {{at the same time}} by the same manufacturer, and their Type XM2 two-axle bogie tenders were identical.|$|R
5000|$|By 1920 {{the success}} of the Sentinel undertypes was evident, and Garretts decided to {{re-enter}} the undertype wagon market. Their first prototype was produced in 1921, driven by a two-cylinder engine with piston <b>valves</b> <b>actuated</b> by Joy <b>valve</b> <b>gear.</b> Unusually for the time, the wagon was fitted with Timken roller bearings on the crankshaft, countershaft and axles. This design was built under licence as the [...] "Adamov-Garrett" [...] by Adamov of Czechoslovakia from 1925. In 1926 a prototype rigid six-wheeled wagon was produced. In 1927 a poppet valve engine replaced the earlier design, this being used until the end of production in 1932. 310 wagons were produced in this second phase of undertype construction.|$|R
50|$|The Class NG G14 {{locomotive}} had a 2-6-2+2-6-2 Double Prairie {{type wheel}} arrangement {{like all the}} previous and subsequent narrow gauge SAR Garratts except the first, the 2-6-0+0-6-2 Double Mogul type Class NG G11. It was very similar in dimensions to the earlier Class NG G12, but it had cylinders with a 1/2 in larger bore which not only resulted in more power, but also an increase in axle loading. Like the Class NG G12, it also had an outside plate frame, a round-topped firebox and was superheated. Its piston <b>valves</b> were <b>actuated</b> by Walschaerts <b>valve</b> <b>gear.</b>|$|R
50|$|The Zwillinge could {{negotiate}} {{curves of}} 66 ft and could haul loads of 32 lt t up a 1 in 25 (4%) gradient. They had balloon-type spark arresters in their chimneys and were coal-fired, the coal being imported from Germany. The steam regulator was arranged outside the high steam dome and, on some, two sandboxes were arranged {{on top of}} the boiler, fore and aft of the dome, while others had two small cylindrical sandboxes attached to the smokebox. They had flat Murdoch's D slide <b>valves</b> which were <b>actuated</b> by Stephenson <b>valve</b> <b>gear,</b> arranged outside the 5/8 in plate frames.|$|R
50|$|The {{superheated}} Class GA had a commodious cab and had plate frames, with {{a copper}} Belpaire firebox and combustion chamber. The piston <b>valves</b> were <b>actuated</b> by Walschaerts <b>valve</b> <b>gear,</b> driven from the coupled wheels furthest from the respective cylinders {{and controlled by}} steam reversing gear which was fitted under the boiler barrel between the cradle frame plates. The bissel trucks at the extremities of the locomotive were fitted with Cartazzi axle box control to allow the axles sideways play since the truck itself did not pivot, but was compensated with the adjacent pair of coupled wheels.|$|R
5000|$|They had plate frames, steel Belpaire fireboxes {{and were}} superheated, with four safety valves set at [...] Their piston <b>valves</b> were <b>actuated</b> by Walschaerts <b>valve</b> <b>gear,</b> {{controlled}} by steam reversing gear. As delivered, they had 45+1/2 in diameter coupled wheels which were later retyred to 46 in diameter. The two water tanks had a combined capacity of 4600 imp gal. They had a water-filling tube {{hole on the}} front tank only since {{the front and rear}} tanks were connected by leveling pipes in accordance with the usual Garratt practice. The locomotives were delivered with mechanical lubricators, but these were later removed.|$|R
50|$|The Class 25NC was {{superheated}} {{and used}} piston <b>valves</b> <b>actuated</b> by Walschaerts <b>valve</b> <b>gear.</b> Timken roller bearings were used throughout, including on the three-axle tender bogies, the coupling and connecting rods {{as well as}} the crosshead gudgeon pins, while the locomotive's leading bogies and coupled wheels had Cannon-type axle boxes. Compared to earlier SAR practice, a novelty was the adoption of mechanical lubrication. A sixteen-feed lubricator was driven off the reversing link trunnion. The cylinders and frames were cast in one piece by Commonwealth Steel Castings Corporation in the United States of America. The steel cylinders and steam chests were fitted with cast iron liners. Being entirely mounted on roller bearings, very little effort was required to move these locomotives.|$|R
