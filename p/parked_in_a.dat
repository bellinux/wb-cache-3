5|$|The band's road manager, Brian Maguire {{stated that}} when he drove away from Banbridge in the lead, a few minutes ahead of the band's minibus, he passed through {{security}} barriers manned by the RUC. As Maguire continued ahead, up the by-pass towards Newry, he noticed a blue Triumph 2000 pulling-out from {{where it had been}} <b>parked</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> lay-by. Maguire recalled that the car first slowed down, then it accelerated, flashing its lights. Two men had been observed acting suspiciously inside the Castle Ballroom during the band's performance that night, suggesting that the Miami Showband's movements were being carefully monitored.|$|E
5|$|Wartime Mikkeli is {{identified}} with Marshal Mannerheim, {{the commander of}} the Finnish army and later President of Finland. His personal railway carriage, which he used as a command post during the war, is <b>parked</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> siding at Mikkeli station. It is possible to look inside the carriage through its windows at any time. But public entry to the carriage is only permitted once a year, on Mannerheim's birthday (June 4). The carriage was the venue of Mannerheim's famous 1942 meeting (near Immola) with Hitler, on which occasion a private conversation between the two men was secretly recorded. Photographs of this meeting are on display in the carriage. Mannerheim was a regular diner at the Mikkelin Klubi, where his favourite drink was schnapps.|$|E

25|$|In 2011, Kienholz's {{work was}} visited with renewed {{attention}} in Los Angeles {{partly as a}} result of the Pacific Standard Time series of exhibitions, which saw his powerful 1972 installation Five Car Stud reinstalled at LACMA. The oversized installation is framed by five vehicles <b>parked</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> circle, their headlights illuminating a stark racial hatred castration scene. It was exhibited in Los Angeles and Germany in 1972, then purchased by a Japanese collector and kept in storage for almost 40 years, known only through documentary photos from those exhibitions. In September 2011, it was re-installed at LACMA. At Art Basel 2012, it was purchased by the Prada Foundation.|$|E
25|$|After {{nine days}} of surveillance, on June 11, police {{observed}} Bonin driving in a seemingly random manner throughout Hollywood, unsuccessfully attempting to lure five separate teenage boys into his van, before succeeding in luring a youth into his vehicle. The police followed Bonin until his van <b>parked</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> desolate parking lot {{close to the}} Hollywood Freeway, then discreetly approached the vehicle. Upon hearing muffled screams and banging sounds emanating from inside the van, these plainclothes officers forced {{their way into the}} vehicle; discovering Bonin in the act of raping and strangling a 17-year-old Orange County runaway named Harold Tate, whom he had handcuffed and bound.|$|E

25|$|For many years, {{teams were}} unable to park their {{transporters}} inside the infield, nor did the track have any significant garage area. Team transporters were <b>parked</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> lot outside of the track. During racing periods, crews and participants were landlocked by the track, and thus, unable {{to return to the}} transporters for spare parts, repairs, or rest. In the early 1990s, the infield was reconfigured and completely paved. Teams began parking the transporters in an orchestrated, extremely tight arrangement that takes several hours, and highly skilled drivers, to accomplish. Teams are now able to work out of their transporters in the same fashion as other facilities.|$|E
25|$|When {{the column}} of {{vehicles}} stopped suddenly during this exchange, T1 Patrol's Breda-carrying truck {{collided with the}} back of the wireless truck, wrecking its radiator; the truck had to be stripped and abandoned and the crew joined other trucks. While the wireless truck was able to continue the loss of the Breda's firepower was a setback to the unit. In addition a G1 Patrol vehicle wrecked its sump after hitting a rock and this too was stripped and abandoned. T1 Patrol's wireless truck separated from the column and <b>parked</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> field at Sidi Selim (about 12km south-east of Barce) to act as a rendezvous point after the attack; this truck was also to keep a constant radio watch for messages from Lt Col David Stirling's SAS unit operating that night against Benghazi ("Operation Bigamy").|$|E

25|$|Jackson {{was also}} alleged by Kevin Dowling, Joe Tiernan, and the Pat Finucane Centre to {{have led the}} UVF gang that carried out the Miami Showband {{massacre}} at Buskhill, outside Newry on 31 July 1975, which left band members Brian McCoy, Fran O'Toole and Tony Geraghty dead. Two others, Stephen Travers and Des McAlea, were wounded. Harris Boyle and Wesley Somerville, both suspects in the Dublin bombings, and members of both the UDR and Mid-Ulster UVF, were accidentally blown up after they had loaded a bomb {{into the back of}} the band's minibus which had been <b>parked</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> lay-by. The minibus, driven by trumpeter Brian McCoy (a Protestant from Caledon, County Tyrone), had been flagged-down by UVF men wearing British Army uniforms at a bogus roadside military checkpoint on the main A1 road as the band was returning home to Dublin after a performance in Banbridge. Following the premature detonation, which ripped the vehicle in half, the band members were then gunned down by the surviving UVF men.|$|E

He also commissioned the construction of large inflatable puppets representing characters from the storyline including the [...] "Mother", the [...] "Ex-wife" [...] and the [...] "Schoolmaster".

500|$|Between 1950 and 1958—for {{the first}} two years under the control of No.90 (Composite) Wing—the Lincolns of No.1 Squadron were {{deployed}} for service in the Malayan Emergency, tasked with the prime responsibility for the Commonwealth's bombing campaign against Communist insurgents. This arrangement meant that No.82 Wing's flying units were reduced to Nos.2 and 6 Squadrons. From 1952 to 1957, the wing flew observation flights in connection with British atomic tests in Australia. No protective clothing was issued to air or ground crews during these flights and, following the second such operation in October 1953, nine of the twelve Lincolns involved were found to be contaminated, four so heavily that they were <b>parked</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> remote corner of the Amberley air base and never flown again. On 9April 1953, the wing wrote off three Lincolns—without loss of life—in two separate incidents that collectively became known as [...] "Black Thursday"; one of the Lincolns crashed on landing at Amberley during the day, and that night another Lincoln collided with one of its brethren at Cloncurry Aerodrome, Queensland.|$|E
