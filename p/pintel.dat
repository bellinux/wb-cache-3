25|$|Simple copper {{objects were}} already in use in the 4th {{millennium}} BC, including a copper pin from Lattrigen from 3170 BC and a knife blade from Twann. Shortly before 2000 BC bronze production entered the area and brought about a surge in development. Settlements began to spread into the pre-Alpine and Alpine areas. The area between Lake Thun and the Niedersimmental were densely settled. Archeological finds include scattered items along mountain passes, a fortified hilltop settlements at Spiezberg, Cholis Grind by Saanen and at <b>Pintel</b> by Wimmis, along with cemeteries at Thun-Allmendingen, Einigen and Hilterfingen. Late Bronze Age (ca. 1000–800 BC) settlements along Lake Biel (Mörigen, Vinelz) have yielded up a wealth of items.|$|E
500|$|In June 2009, Bruckheimer {{indicated}} Disney {{would prefer}} the fourth installment of Pirates [...] {{to be released}} before The Lone Ranger film, which he, Johnny Depp, Ted Elliott, and Terry Rossio {{had been working on}} for release on May 20, 2011. He hoped Gore Verbinski would return to direct the fourth film, as his BioShock film adaptation had been put on hold. As Verbinski was unavailable due to his commitment with Rango the same year, Bruckheimer suggested Rob Marshall, who he considered a [...] "premiere filmmaker", stating that [...] "Every film [...] made I thought was unique and different." [...] On July 21, 2009, Marshall accepted the job, because of the [...] "whole new story line and set of characters. It felt new, and that was important to me." [...] Marshall said the film provided him a long-awaited opportunity to work with Depp, and that his directing was helped by his experience as a choreographer—"the action sequences felt like big production numbers." [...] On September 11, 2009, at Disney's D23 convention during a Disney event, Cook and Johnny Depp, in full Captain Jack Sparrow costume, announced that a fourth Pirates film was in development. The title was announced as Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides. Marshall visited the Pirates of the Caribbean ride in Disneyland for inspiration, eventually paying homage with a skeleton holding a magnifying glass in Ponce de León's ship. An appearance of [...] "Old Bill", the pirate who tries to share his rum with a cat, was also filmed but cut. <b>Pintel</b> and Ragetti were originally supposed to make an appearance, but director Rob Marshall opted out of the idea as he feared their roles would be cut.|$|E

2500|$|Alpha Epsilon Pi {{was founded}} in 1913 under the Washington Square Arch at New York University (NYU) by Charles C. Moskowitz and 10 other Jewish men: David K. Schafer, Isador M. Glazer, Herman L. Kraus, Arthur E. Leopold, Benjamin M. Meyer, Arthur M. Lipkint, Charles J. <b>Pintel,</b> Maurice Plager, Hyman Shulman, and Emil J. Lustgarten. These men are known as the [...] "Immortal 11." [...] Their first pledge was Samuel L. Epstein.|$|E
5000|$|In {{the first}} movie, when Ragetti and <b>Pintel</b> find Elizabeth, <b>Pintel</b> says [...] "ello, Poppet". This scene is {{repeated}} in the second movie; when both turn on Elizabeth for the treasure, <b>Pintel</b> repeats that line. Towards the end of At Worlds End, <b>Pintel</b> says [...] "Goodbye, Poppet" [...] to Elizabeth as she leaves the ship.|$|E
50|$|<b>Pintel</b> and Ragetti are {{recurring}} {{characters in}} the Pirates of the Caribbean film series, primarily providing comic relief throughout each film. <b>Pintel</b> is portrayed by Lee Arenberg and Mackenzie Crook portrays Ragetti.|$|E
5000|$|Later, when Jack {{is searching}} for Davy Joness heart and a fight breaks out between himself, Norrington, and Will Turner, <b>Pintel</b> and Ragetti once again have an {{opportunity}} to steal something valuable; to convince his partner, <b>Pintel</b> tells Ragetti they will be [...] "removing temptation from their paths" [...] by stealing the Dead Mans Chest. They take it, but do not get far before Elizabeth catches up to them. <b>Pintel</b> greets Elizabeth much as he greeted her when they first met by saying, in an eerie tone, [...] "ello, poppet". Before they can do anything to her, however, Davy Joness crew attacks and they drop the chest. When the Flying Dutchmans crew overtakes them, they fight alongside Elizabeth, with whom they share the two swords that Ragetti and <b>Pintel</b> had.|$|E
50|$|<b>Pintel</b> and Ragetti are {{not seen}} or {{mentioned}} in Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales, however since Murtogg, Mullroy, and Marty {{returned to the}} series, despite previously implied to have been trapped in Blackbeard's bottle, leads {{to the possibility that}} <b>Pintel</b> and Ragetti could return in a future installment.|$|E
50|$|Little {{is known}} about the {{background}} of either <b>Pintel</b> or Ragetti. According to Pirates of the Caribbean: The Visual Guide, prior to serving as cannoneers aboard the Black Pearl, Ragetti and <b>Pintel</b> spent a year as naval sailors, press-ganged into service for the Royal Navy before deserting to escape the bad food and abusive treatment. As part of a backstory worked out by both Arenberg and Crook, their characters' full names are Terry Ragetti and Abner <b>Pintel,</b> and that Ragetti was the son of Pintel's sister, and they shared half a brain. Arenberg also claims Ragetti is the son of a prostitute.|$|E

5000|$|<b>Pintel</b> and Ragetti {{appear as}} cameos in Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End for the Nintendo DS. With <b>Pintel</b> the player {{practices}} sword skills taught by Barbossa. Ragetti gives {{some information about}} the port the player is currently in. They also appear in the Xbox 360 and PS3 versions of the game as playable characters.|$|E
50|$|In {{the first}} movie, during {{a scene where}} Ragetti and <b>Pintel</b> are manning a cannon, Ragettis {{removable}} eye {{was hit by a}} fork (which is being used as a replacement for a cannonball by the hijacked Interceptors crew), Ragetti and <b>Pintel</b> look at the fork and then slowly look through the cannon gunport at the Interceptor. This scene is repeated in the second movie (with exactly the same camera angles) when Ragetti and <b>Pintel</b> look out at the Krakens tentacle, which is pressed against the Pearl. The shot is repeated a third time in the final movie, wherein they have loaded the cannon with Jack the Monkey.|$|E
5000|$|A running gag {{throughout}} {{the first movie}} involves characters surrendering themselves to Ragetti and <b>Pintel</b> while invoking the right of [...] "parley". At first they are pleased with invoking parley {{but according to the}} storys premise parley guarantees a prisoner will be escorted unharmed to the captain in order to conduct negotiations. Then they become irritated when all their captures invoke parley especially when Jack Sparrow invokes parley after he was discovered alive. At one point, <b>Pintel</b> snarls at his captives, [...] "If any of you so much as thinks of the word parley, Ill have your guts for garters!". Ironically, after they are captured, <b>Pintel</b> attempts unsuccessfully to invoke parley himself.|$|E

5000|$|Ragetti and <b>Pintel</b> {{appear as}} playable [...] "Chamber Card" [...] {{characters}} in the Pirates of the Caribbean Trading Card Game, acting together as one composite character.|$|E
5000|$|In Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End, Ragetti and <b>Pintel</b> {{play a more}} {{significant}} part in the plot while still supplying comic relief. In this installment, they serve under Hector Barbossa in the journey to rescue Jack, and then serve in the joint effort by Barbossa and Sparrow to defeat the East India Trading Company. Barbossa uses Ragetti's wooden eye as his [...] "Piece of Eight" [...] (one {{of a group of}} nine sacrificial Pieces of Eight used to free Calypso), so <b>Pintel</b> covers his empty eye socket with an eye patch.|$|E
5000|$|Arenberg and Crook {{appear as}} <b>Pintel</b> and Ragetti in purpose-filmed [...] "pop-up" [...] video vignettes in the Pirate's Lair on Tom Sawyer Island {{attraction}} at Disneyland and other Disney parks.|$|E
5000|$|Ragetti and <b>Pintel</b> {{appear as}} boss {{characters}} in Pirates of the Caribbean: The Legend of Jack Sparrow for the PlayStation 2 and PC platforms; both are voiced by Greg Ellis.|$|E
50|$|Like most pirates, <b>Pintel</b> and Ragetti wear old, threadbare clothes. According to Pirates of the Caribbean: The Visual Guide, Ragetti's green {{jacket was}} stolen from a French nobleman, Pintel's {{trousers}} are washed with urine in an attempt to remove bloodstains, and Ragetti's trousers are covered with tar to make them waterproof - both of which were real methods used in the days of piracy. It also was mentioned in The Visual Guide that <b>Pintel</b> spends hours {{in front of a mirror}} in order to practice his famous gloomy face expression. Their coats are similar to that of Jack Sparrow.|$|E
5000|$|In {{the third}} installment, Ragetti again {{shows that he}} is more educated than he appears when he says [...] "Actually, it's a cephalopod" [...] after <b>Pintel</b> calls the dead Kraken a [...] "stupid fish".|$|E
5000|$|<b>Pintel</b> and Ragetti are {{not seen}} or {{mentioned}} in Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides, as the [...] "Black Pearl" [...] is attacked and taken by Blackbeard. Barbossa {{was able to}} survive the attack. Their further fate is currently unknown.|$|E
5000|$|Wheel of Fortune: The {{three-way}} duel between Jack, Norrington, and Will for the Dead Man's Chest key on the Isla Cruces. This lengthy action cue also covers Elizabeth, <b>Pintel,</b> and Ragetti's {{battle against}} the Dutchman crew for the Dead Man's Chest itself. Does not include {{the beginning of the}} duel, and actually begins when <b>Pintel</b> and Ragetti confront Elizabeth. [...] "Wheel of Fortune" [...] uses several of the action themes introduced in the [...] "Jack Sparrow" [...] suite, plus the first theme in the Kraken track, and many other action themes from earlier in the movie and in the first movie. The name likely refers to the giant water wheel on which much of the battle takes place.|$|E
5000|$|Additional {{features}} in the cave include [...] "pop-up" [...] gags featuring <b>Pintel</b> and Ragetti from the Pirates of the Caribbean films who are guarding cursed treasure {{as well as other}} effects featuring disappearing treasure and a genie in a bottle guarding treasure.|$|E
5000|$|The comic duo (especially Ragetti) can {{unexpectedly}} {{engage in}} erudite and intelligent discussions. In these discussions, Ragetti often proves {{that he is}} more educated than he appears, {{even though he is}} illiterate, though Ragetti argues the point. When Tia Dalma says that something vexed Davy Jones so much that he abandoned land for an eternal life at sea, Ragetti asks whether this was [...] "the dichotomy of good and evil", causing <b>Pintel</b> and Gibbs to give him astonished looks. The two also engage in a debate over the proper pronunciation of [...] "Kraken", with <b>Pintel</b> saying he believes the correct pronunciation is [...] "kray-ken" [...] while most say [...] "krack-en". Ragetti explains that the derivation of the word is from original Scandinavian, and thus should be pronounced [...] "krah-ken". <b>Pintel</b> points out they are not [...] "Original Scandinavians", to which Ragetti retorts, [...] "Its a mythological creature, I can calls it what I wants!". Ragetti also displays a knack for knowing things he should not, such as the reasons for which Jack, Will, and Norrington each want the heart of Davy Jones (Jack to control Jones and protect himself, Will to free his father from the less-than-friendly bond between the Flying Dutchman and her crew, and Norrington to restore his honor). This tendency had earlier appeared in The Curse of the Black Pearl, wherein Ragetti compares a ruse used by himself and <b>Pintel</b> to the ruse of the Trojan Horse while they were distracting the Royal Navy by pretending to be women: [...] "Its just like what the Greeks done at Troy... cept they was in a horse, not dresses. Wooden horse".|$|E
5000|$|At the film's end, the two serve {{aboard the}} Black Pearl, which Barbossa has again commandeered from Jack. <b>Pintel</b> {{says about the}} matter: [...] "Some of the men don't feel entirely settled about leaving Captain Jack behind again". When Barbossa asked if that was so, <b>Pintel</b> says [...] "It would make us feel a whole lot better, {{regarding}} our fortunes, if we could see that item you told us about.", the item meaning the Fountain of Youth (This mirrors Barbossa asking for the coordinates of the Chest of Cortes while planning a mutiny.) When Barbossa shows them the charts, a big hole appears where the map's crucial component was removed by Sparrow. Ragetti is also seen making a new wooden eye for himself.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Pintel</b> and Ragetti {{appear and}} act nearly always together; {{therefore}} {{their roles in}} the film series have been {{compared with those of}} Mr. Wint and Mr. Kidd in Diamonds Are Forever.Several scenes that feature them became recurring jokes/motifs in the series with the release of the sequel. For example: ...|$|E
5000|$|Both Lee Arenberg and Mackenzie Crook {{commented on}} the {{possibility}} of returning as <b>Pintel</b> and Ragetti. Arenberg confirmed in several interviews that, despite wanting to return to the fourth film, he hoped to reprise his role as <b>Pintel.</b> In an interview on November 7, 2014, Crook confirmed that he had received a call of availability from Disney for the film, although stated that he was uncertain about whether he wanted to reprise his role. Crook declined to reprise his role ultimately, in order to focus on his television series Detectorists. He said he felt [...] "pangs of nostalgia," [...] when the cast and crew filmed the film without him. Furthermore, shortly before filming started, Arenberg announced on Twitter that he would not reprise his role as well, despite having been interested in doing so.|$|E
50|$|The Broadway {{production}} was staged by J. H. Benrimo, choreographed by Leon Leonidoff and Florence Rogge, with chorus direction by Jacques <b>Pintel.</b> It {{was produced by}} G. W. McGregor. The Well of Romance opened on November 7, 1930 at the Craig Theatre, and ran for just 8 performances, closing on November 12.|$|E
50|$|Their first {{appearance}} occurred in Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl, when they served under Hector Barbossa upon the Black Pearl. <b>Pintel</b> and Ragetti, along with Barbossa {{and the crew}} of the Black Pearl, share in the Aztec curse and are immortal {{for the majority of the}} film.|$|E
5000|$|During {{the meeting}} of the Fourth Brethren Court, <b>Pintel</b> notices that the Nine Pieces of Eight are in fact [...] "just pieces of junk." [...] Gibbs {{provides}} the backstory for the pieces of eight and their role in imprisoning Calypso. Later, he fights against the Dutchman during the battle in Calypso's maelstrom.|$|E
