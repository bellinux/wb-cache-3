5|$|The concept {{behind a}} Qualifying Industrial Zone is {{credited}} to Omar Salah, a Jordanian businessman. In 1993, {{in anticipation of}} the Israel–Jordan peace treaty, Salah traveled to Israel with the intention of doing business with Israeli businessmen. He was also interested in business ventures that could take advantage of the eight-year-old free trade agreement between the United States and Israel that allowed Israeli goods to enter the US markets duty-free. After the treaty was signed in 1994, a business venture was struck between Salah and Delta Galil, where labor was transferred to Irbid in northern Jordan, to take advantage of low labor costs that were forty to seventy <b>percent</b> <b>lower</b> <b>than</b> in Israel. Salah had envisioned that by exploiting Israeli resources such as labor, finances, and contacts, and then leveraging it to produce value-added goods, the economy of Jordan would be benefited. In addition, he surmised that economic cooperation between the two nations would help foster peace in the region.|$|E
30|$|Focusing now on {{the wage}} penalty {{immigrants}} face at arrival (relative to similar natives), we observe that the initial penalty that migrants face increases with skill level. Estimates from column 3 reveal that while low-skilled migrants arriving in the 1991 – 1995 earn 35 <b>percent</b> <b>lower</b> wages <b>than</b> similar natives at arrival, medium- and high-skilled migrants earn 39 and 41 <b>percent</b> <b>lower</b> wages <b>than</b> their native counterparts, respectively. Similar findings emerge for the cohort of migrants arriving in the 2001 – 2005 period. At arrival, low-skilled migrants earn 27 <b>percent</b> <b>lower</b> wages <b>than</b> similar natives, while medium- and high-skilled migrants earn 36 and 47 <b>percent</b> <b>lower</b> wages <b>than</b> their native counterparts. Moreover, estimates from Table  1 also reveal that the immigrant wage penalty only decreases over time for low-skilled migrants. In contrast, it increases with time in Spain for medium- and high-skilled migrants. For instance among high-skilled migrants arriving in the 1991 – 1995 period see their median wage penalty increased from 41 percent in 1991 to 50 percent ten year later.|$|R

25|$|The NP's {{desire to}} burn low grade {{semi-bituminous}} coal from company-owned mines at Rosebud, Montana, {{played a part}} {{in the development of the}} 4-8-4 wheel arrangement for steam locomotives.

25|$|One {{approach}} {{to address the}} problem of waste PVC is also through the process called Vinyloop. It is a mechanical recycling process using a solvent to separate PVC from other materials. This solvent turns in a closed loop process in which the solvent is recycled.

This recycled PVC's primary energy demand is 46 <b>percent</b> <b>lower</b> <b>than</b> conventional produced PVC. So the use of recycled material leads to a significant better ecological footprint.

25|$|An {{early success}} in the {{recycling}} of plastics is Vinyloop, an industrial process to separate PVC from other materials through dissolution, filtration and separation of contaminants. A solvent is used in a closed loop to elute PVC from the waste. This {{makes it possible to}} recycle composite PVC waste, which is normally incinerated or put in a landfill. Vinyloop-based recycled PVC's primary energy demand is 46 <b>percent</b> <b>lower</b> <b>than</b> conventionally produced PVC. The global warming potential is 39 percent lower. This is why the use of recycled material leads to a significantly better ecological outcome. This process was used after the Olympic Games in London 2012. Parts of temporary Buildings like the Water Polo Arena and the Royal Artillery Barracks were recycled. In this way, the PVC Policy could be fulfilled, which says that no PVC waste should be left after the games had ended.|$|E
25|$|Another {{measure of}} the {{performance}} of the Dutch economy during the 18th century is the estimate that De Vries and Van der Woude have made of the per capita GDP of the Dutch economy in 1742 (for which year tax records provide a basis for estimation and extrapolation). They arrive at an estimated GNP of between 265 and 280 million guilders, or 135–142 guilders per capita. This {{was at the end of}} a long period of secular decline after the economic zenith of 1650. The next decades saw some economic resurgence. In the decade 1800–1810 (again a period of economic decline) the national income of the (slightly contracted) population can be estimated at 307 million guilders, or 162 guilders per capita. To put all of this in perspective: in 1740 the GNP of Great Britain was about £80 million, or 120 guilders per capita (and therefore about 20 <b>percent</b> <b>lower</b> <b>than</b> the Dutch per capita income). After this the British per capita income started on a rapid increase, due to the Industrial Revolution. It therefore eventually overtook the Dutch per capita income, but probably only around 1800.|$|E
