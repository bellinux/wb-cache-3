5000|$|<b>Pseudo-operations</b> {{are those}} in which forces of one power {{disguise}} themselves as enemy forces. For example, a state power may disguise teams of operatives as insurgents and, {{with the aid of}} defectors, infiltrate insurgent areas. The aim of such <b>pseudo-operations</b> may be to gather short or long-term intelligence or to engage in active operations, in particular assassinations of important enemies. However, they usually involve both, as the risks of exposure rapidly increase with time and intelligence gathering eventually leads to violent confrontation. <b>Pseudo-operations</b> may be directed by military or police forces, or both. Police forces are usually best suited to intelligence tasks; however, military provide the structure needed to back up such pseudo-ops with military response forces.

Cerebral ischemia-reperfusion injury was induced through middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO). 10 minutes before the operation, the rats in the G group were injected with gastrodin (50 mg/kg) intraperitoneally once. The rats in the CIRI and NC group were injected with the same volume of 10 % propylene glycol normal saline intraperitoneally once. The levels of glutamic acid (Glu), aspartic acid (Asp), γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA), taurine (Tau) in striatum in the rats of the 3 groups were measured with the method of microdialysis-HPLC techniques. The ratio of Glu to GABA was calculated. The volume of cerebral infarction was quantified. This study showed that gastrodin can decrease the volume of cerebral infarction, ameliorate the cerebral injury in the rats of cerebral ischemia-reperfusion. The mechanisms might be that gastrodin can improve the level of amino acids in striatum.

40|$|We {{consider}} integer {{random access}} machines (RAMs) that receive {{one of two}} types of special integers as extra inputs: arbitrary numbers and random numbers. Arbitrary numbers are numbers that have no special property, other than being large-valued. Informally, one can consider them as adversarially-chosen numbers. Intuitively, it would not seem that arbitrary numbers offer any value. However, previous studies have shown for specific problems that such numbers contribute to the computational power of a RAM. The present work gives, for the first time, a broad characterisation of the scenarios in which arbitrary numbers do and those in which they do not increase computational power, rather than considering specific problems. The second type of extra inputs, random numbers, is conceptually an intermediate ground between Oracle-given certificates and adversarially-chosen arbitrary numbers. The contribution of random inputs to Turing machines is the famous P=RP problem. In the context of RAMs, it was posed as an open question by Simon (1981). The present study closes this problem, by showing that for certain RAMs randomness does provide an advantage, whereas for others it does not. In order to achieve the results presented, this work also reviews classical results regarding certificates {{and the use of}} indirect addressing (which is a <b>pseudo-operation</b> available to RAMs, but which can be conceptually disabled so as to have its contribution modelled). In both cases, our results sharpen the state-of-the-art. In the case of certificates, we show how results by Simon (1981) on RAMs with certificates continue to hold also with a slightly reduced operation set (as well as with new operation sets). In the case of indirect addressing, we show how, for specific RAMs, this <b>pseudo-operation</b> can be simulated with no loss of complexity, whereas previously {{the state of the art}} was for a loss of complexity by a factor of the inverse Ackermann function. The following are some of our main results. We define a new complexity class, PEL, which formalises the idea of describing the power of a RAM in terms of its capacity to generate large numbers, and show that for a wide class of RAMs (specifically those that support addition, Boolean operations, left-shift by a variable amount and division) computational power is, indeed, directly related to this capacity. In particular, the addition of an arbitrary large number to any RAM belonging to this class gives it the ability to recognise any recursively enumerable set in O(1) time. Indeed, functions computable in this model are on the second level of the arithmetical hierarchy. When adding to this the ability to generate additional arbitrary large numbers at will, we show that an O(1) -time computation has the same power as the entire arithmetical hierarchy, and an omega(1) -time computation extends even beyond that. For certain other RAMs, we are able to show that the addition of arbitrary large numbers does not increase their computational power at all. For RAMs that have access to random numbers, we close an open problem raised by Simon (1981), who asked for a characterisation of the power of certain RAMs working in polynomial time on random numbers. Intriguingly, the power of these RAMs is PEL, too. However, it remains an open question whether they, too, enjoy the power-boost afforded by arbitrary large numbers.

As with all Special Forces in Rhodesia, by 1977 they were controlled by COMOPS (Commander, Combined Operations) Commander Lieutenant General Peter Walls. The Selous Scouts were originally composed of 120 members, with all officers being white and the highest rank initially available for black soldiers being colour sergeant. They succeeded in turning approximately 800 insurgents who were then paid by Special Branch, ultimately reaching the number of 1,500 members. Engaging mainly in long-range reconnaissance and surveillance missions, they increasingly turned to offensive actions, including the attempted assassination of Zimbabwe People's Revolutionary Army leader Joshua Nkomo in Zambia. This mission was finally aborted by the Selous Scouts, and attempted again, unsuccessfully, by the Rhodesian Special Air Service.|$|R
