This policy change has potential harmful affects on public access to recall information. Only Ford continues to issue public announcements for every recall. We find that Ford recalls since 1981 receive more newspaper coverage, while {{there is some evidence}} that recalls by non-Ford manufacturers are now less likely to appear in <b>print.</b> <b>Key</b> factors that influence the likelihood of newspaper coverage include the number of vehicles recalled, defect severity, and cost of repair...|$|E
40|$|In this talk, one of {{the most}} efficient, and {{reliable}} integrated tools for CD/DVD production workflow, called Medical Archive Recording System (MARS) by ETIAM Company, France, which is a leader in multimedia connectivity for healthcare in Europe, is going to be introduced. "nThis tool is used to record all patient studies, route the studies to printers and PACS automatically, <b>print</b> <b>key</b> images and associated reports and log all study production for automated post processing/archiving. Its benefits vary from multi-departmental system to highly customizability, IHE compliancy, high productivity, inclusion of workflow manager and web interface. "nAn automated user-friendly DICOM viewer is in-cluded in this tool, which is used to display reports and key image. It also allows comparing several stu-dies on several discs. "nThe viewer supports all DICOM objects including compressed images such as JPEG, JPEG 2000, RLE etc. and video added-value non-image DICOM ob-jects. "nThe ETIAM MARS is offered in two versions: MARS 15 d for medium productions and MARS 20 d for medium to large productions. Some of the new features that are added are supports for Windows Vista, support of new DICOM objects (enhanced CT, MR, XA, Encapsulated PDF [...] .) IHE PDI update, creation of object keys for key images; importing non-standard reports form files and many other features. "nThe tool enables users to create, verify and index CDs and DVDs by simply sending studies from any DICOM node...|$|E
40|$|In packaging, spot colours {{are used}} to <b>print</b> <b>key</b> {{information}} like brand logos and elements for which the colour accuracy is critical. The present study investigates methods to aid the accurate reproduction of these spot colours with the n-colour printing process. Typical n-colour printing systems consist of supplementary inks {{in addition to the}} usual CMYK inks. Adding these inks to the traditional CMYK set increases the attainable colour gamut, but the added complexity creates several challenges in generating suitable colour separations for rendering colour images. In this project, the n-colour separation is achieved by the use of additional sectors for intermediate inks. Each sector contains four inks with the achromatic ink (black) common to all sectors. This allows the extension of the principles of the CMYK printing process to these additional sectors. The methods developed in this study can be generalised to any number of inks. The project explores various aspects of the n-colour printing process including the forward characterisation methods, gamut prediction of the n-colour process and the inverse characterisation to calculate the n-colour separation for target spot colours. The scope of the study covers different printing technologies including lithographic offset, flexographic, thermal sublimation and inkjet printing. A new method is proposed to characterise the printing devices. This method, the spot colour overprint (SCOP) model, was evaluated for the n-colour printing process with different printing technologies. In addition, a set of real-world spot colours were converted to n-colour separations and printed with the 7 -colour printing process to evaluate against the original spot colours. The results show that the proposed methods can be effectively used to replace the spot coloured inks with the n-colour printing process. This can save significant material, time and costs in the packaging industry...|$|E

The thick vertical lines correspond to the pitches of the chromatic keys, while the thin vertical lines correspond to the diatonic keys. Note that a dynamic intonation correction algorithm is available. This option can help less experienced users or for virtuoso passages [21].|$|R

5000|$|Older {{mechanical}} encryption systems, such as rotor machines, were keyed {{by setting}} {{the positions of}} wheels and plugs from a <b>printed</b> <b>keying</b> list.

Later NSA encryption systems incorporated a serial port fill connector and developed several common fill devices (CFDs) {{that could be used}} with multiple systems. A CFD was plugged in when new keys were to be loaded. Newer NSA systems allow [...] "over the air rekeying" [...] (OTAR), but a master key often must still be loaded using a fill device.|$|R
