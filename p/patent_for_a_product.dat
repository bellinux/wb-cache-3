[...] If a monopoly could be so expanded, the owner of a <b>patent</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>product</b> might conceivably monopolize the commerce in a large part of unpatented materials used in its manufacture. The owner of a patent for a machine might thereby secure a partial monopoly on the unpatented supplies consumed in its operation.

50|$|BD {{was founded}} in 1897 by Maxwell W. Becton and Fairleigh S. Dickinson, two American {{businessmen}} who met on a sales trip. The same year the company made its first sale, a Luer-all-glass syringe that sold for $2.50. In 1898, BD acquired its first <b>patent</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> medical <b>product.</b> In 1899 the company introduced its first logo which was meant to symbolize guaranteed superior quality of the products provided by BD. In 1904, BD acquired the Philadelphia Surgical Company. This very first acquisition and other early acquisitions significantly expanded the company’s manufacturing ability and product offering. Two years later, BD incorporated in the State of New Jersey and built a manufacturing facility in East Rutherford, {{the first in the}} U.S. created specifically for the production of thermometers, hypodermic needles, and syringes. In 1924, BD manufactured its first syringe designed specifically for insulin injection. One year later, BD introduced the BD Yale Luer-Lok Syringe, designed and patented by Fairleigh S. Dickinson, Sr. It provided a simple and secure method of attaching and removing the needle to and from the syringe. Today, luer lock connectors are the standard for syringes in the U.S. In 1947 Joseph Kleiner developed the Evacutainer—a device used to draw blood by vacuum through a needle into a test tube. This product eventually evolved to become the BD Vacutainer Blood Collection system.|$|R

[...] "Good generals make their luck by shaping the odds in their favor" [...] (MacMillan). Making good decisions and acting upon them can help a firm, but in the end there are other factors that {{must be taken into account}} before making a final decision. One issue is that a firm must find a way to at least limit, if not prevent, imitation, by, for example, applying <b>for</b> <b>patent(s),</b> creating <b>a</b> <b>product</b> that is too complicated to reverse engineer, or taking control of resources that are important to the production of its product and any imitation. The firm must also remember that first-mover advantages are not everlasting; eventually the competition will manage to take at least some piece of the market. Finally, a company must do its best to prevent incumbent inertia caused by self-righteousness, or possible changes in the market environment. One way to overcome such inertia is by expanding the product line. The advantages of having <b>a</b> wider <b>product</b> line are much easier to maintain compared to those of being a pioneer (Robinson).|$|R
40|$|Prices for {{pharmaceutical}} products {{over the last}} 10 years have skyrocketed, increasing far more rapidly than the general cost of living. This article argues there should be greater competition {{for the production of}} follow-on drugs through the strengthening of the double patenting prohibition: preventing extending exclusive rights beyond the original patent term by dressing up part of that invention as a new one. This prohibition against the same party holding two patents covering the same composition announced by the Supreme Court in the 1800 ’s has been weakened by lower federal courts to (1) only considering the claims and not the rest of the specification in determining if the same invention is being claimed by the inventor in two patents and (2) only applying the prohibition when the earlier patent did not satisfy the technical meaning of “prior art” within § 102 of the Patent Act. The rulings weakening the double patenting doctrine have disregarded that the “invention” of a genus patent is not determined only by the claims, but also by the embodiments disclosed in the specification, and under Supreme Court and Federal Circuit precedent it must be presumed that the party with a genus patent has invented the full scope of the genus. These weakening rulings have also disregarded that the double patenting doctrine arises from § 101 of the patent statutes, rather than §§ 102 and 103, which the Federal Circuit models it double patenting test on, often incorrectly concluding there is no double patenting. §§ 102 and 103 serve different purposes than § 101. This article argues that when the same inventor holds <b>a</b> genus <b>patent</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> pharmaceutical <b>product,</b> it should be estopped from obtaining a patent on a species within the scope of the genus, whether or not the genus patent constitutes prior art. Applying this strengthened double patenting doctrine would increase competition for the development of follow-on {{pharmaceutical products}}...|$|R
40|$|The loss of <b>patent</b> {{protection}} <b>for</b> <b>a</b> pharmaceutical <b>product</b> is <b>a</b> significant event <b>for</b> manufacturers. Although {{this phenomenon}} has been {{occurring in the}} industry for decades, it has been of increased interest {{during the past few}} years due to the much publicised “patent cliff” experienced by a number of major pharmaceutical manufacturers. Recent developments in emerging economies such as India and South Africa have brought the concept of intellectual property rights under review. The traditional approach to extend market exclusivity through the use of secondary patents is no longer valid. New product strategies are now required to transition from a patent protected market to an open market. This study adds to the current literature by investigating post-patent strategies pursued in the South African private pharmaceutical market. The primary focus was to determine the rationale behind choosing a particular strategy. This study, exploratory in nature and structured around five propositions, investigated strategies to manage the patent expiry and potential entry from generic competitors. These included manipulating price, increasing promotion, developing value adding product extensions or launching a clone. Information was gathered through 14 interviews with product managers responsible for implementing the chosen strategy. The interviews were conducted using a structured questionnaire as well as open-ended questions. Five companies were selected for the study using purposive sampling and each company then self-selected which products would be discussed. The most pursued strategy for the sample was to launch a clone. This allowed the manufacturer to compete with lower priced generics using the clone as well as continue to profit from the remaining brand loyal, price insensitive consumers with the original product. The price of the original product was not used to deter entry or compete with generic products. Profit-maximising behaviour was exhibited by the reduction in advertising and promotional spend after patent expiry. When available, the use of product extensions to extend market exclusivity continued to be a preferred strategy.

40|$|The {{requirement}} that an invention have utility {{is one of}} the most fundamental of the patent laws. In the United States, for example, the concept of utility is rooted in the Constitution: Article 1, Section 8, gives Congress the power to grant exclusive rights to inventors in order “[t]o promote the progress of Science and useful Arts. ” Other jurisdictions recognize utility in the form of inventions that have “industrial applicability” or are “capable of exploitation in industry,” with all of these terms and phrases generally viewed as being synonymous. Historically, nearly every jurisdiction has excluded some type of invention from patentability as lacking utility. A common and enduring utility-based exclusion is the perpetual motion machine, with the justification being scientific: because perpetual motion is not physically possible, an invention which claims such a feature cannot in fact work and therefore fundamentally lacks utility. Jurisdictions also make exclusions on policy grounds. In Europe, for example, methods of treating human and animal bodies are not patentable, but the justification for doing so, which previously was based on lack of industrial applicability, is now expressly linked to public health policy. In an ever-more global economy, inventions are at the heart of commercial transactions that know no geographic boundaries and are increasingly valued for their job and wealth creation. Obtaining patent protection in multiple jurisdictions therefore is increasingly common. At least to reduce costs and increase efficiency, patent owners, policymakers and practitioners alike have sought increased inter jurisdictional cooperation and patent law harmonization in the patent examination and granting process. Recent publications, however, have identified a developing trend in Canada in which Canadian courts and the Canadian Intellectual Property Office are interpreting and applying the historically well-settled and generally harmonized utility requirement in a new and different way, in particular with respect to <b>patents</b> <b>for</b> pharmaceutical <b>products.</b> <b>As</b> <b>a</b> result, applicants <b>for</b> Canadian <b>patents</b> must meet conditions and overcome hurdles not required by other major patent offices. This article will compare Canada’s implementation and treatment of the utility requirement with the implementation and treatment practiced in the United States and Europe—two jurisdictions that represent prevailing approaches to utility and also constitute a major share of the world’s patenting activity. The article will first examine the statutory and judicial situation in each of the jurisdictions, including a review of the major international treaties and agreements to which each is subject. It will then present a case study that looks at the judicial challenges brought against various members of a single patent family in the United States, Europe, and Canada, and compare the results of those challenges. This analysis, we believe, reveals that the recent shift in Canada’s approach to the utility requirement conflicts with international norms and thus presents implications <b>for</b> patentees, <b>patent</b> law harmonization, and international treaty obligations...|$|R
