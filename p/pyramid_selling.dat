2500|$|The {{modern era}} of {{retailing}} {{is defined as}} the period from the industrial revolution to the 21st century. In major cities, the department store emerged in the mid to late 19th century, and permanently reshaped shopping habits, and redefined concepts of service and luxury. The term, [...] "department store" [...] originated in America. In 19th century England, these stores were known as emporia or warehouse shops. A number of major department stores opened across the USA, Britain and Europe from the mid nineteenth century including; Harrod's of London in 1834; Kendall's in Manchester in 1836; Selfridges of London in 1909; Macy's of New York in 1858; Bloomingdale's in 1861; Sak's in 1867; J.C. Penney in 1902; Le Bon Marché of France in 1852 and Galeries Lafayette of France in 1905. Other twentieth century innovations in retailing included chain stores, mail-order, multi-level marketing (<b>pyramid</b> <b>selling</b> or network marketing, [...] 1920s), party plans ( [...] 1930s) and B2C e-commerce (cyber-peddling).|$|E

50|$|In April 2016, a {{class action}} suit was filed against ViSalus, Robert Goergen, Sr., Todd Goergen, Nick Sarnicola, Blake Mallen and Ryan Blair in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan alleging {{racketeering}} and fraudulent <b>pyramid</b> scheme <b>selling</b> of distribution rights.|$|R
50|$|In May 2013, Salma Sabahi, {{daughter}} of politician and Egyptian Presidential candidate Hamdeen Sabahi turned herself to authorities after {{being accused of}} fraud for her involvement with a network marketing scam Global Ad Mart.During {{the past two years}} she was doubling the size of her <b>pyramid</b> network, <b>selling</b> overpriced counterfeit watches and energy bracelets on behalf of a shady Hong Kong based company Qnet which was operating in Egypt despite being banned in eight countries.|$|R
50|$|At {{the base}} of the {{hierarchy}} pyramid are shopping centres, newsagents etc. which sell low order goods. These centres are small. At the top of the <b>pyramid</b> are centres <b>selling</b> high order goods. These centres are large. Examples for low order goods and services are: newspaper stalls, groceries, bakeries and post offices. Examples for high order goods and services include jewelry, large shopping malls and arcades. They are supported by a much larger threshold population and demand.|$|R

5000|$|In China, Tupperware {{products}} are sold through franchised [...] "entrepreneurial shopfronts", {{of which there}} were 1,900 in 2005, due to <b>pyramid</b> <b>selling</b> laws enacted in 1998. The Chinese characters 特百惠 are used as the brand name, and translate as [...] "hundred benefit".|$|E
50|$|The Le Groupement team {{fell apart}} {{after a short}} time, when the {{sponsoring}} company was involved in scandal, with accusations that it {{was nothing but a}} <b>pyramid</b> <b>selling</b> scheme. Some of the team members claimed that they were owed money, and their wages had not been paid.|$|E
5000|$|Within the household, Peggy {{provides}} {{a voice of}} reason to and a buffer between Hank and Bobby, who have difficulty relating to each other. Peggy has taken Hank to task about their relationship, or the lack thereof. Peggy's devotion to family extends to her niece Luanne, whom she thinks of as a daughter. Peggy freely encourages Bobby and Luanne; sometimes to Hank's distress. Peggy's high opinion of herself is often quite an annoyance to her family and friends. She usually considers herself smarter than everyone she meets and knows; more attractive than Luanne, Nancy and many other more conventionally attractive women; and constantly takes credit for things she has never done. Hank finally confronts her about her confidence issues in [...] "Peggy's Fan Fair". Despite boasting of her intelligence, {{she has been a}} victim of manipulation multiple times, such as being conned out of $2,500 for a phony degree in the episode [...] "The Substitute Spanish Prisoner". She was easily indoctrinated into a homogenous cult in [...] "Fun with Jane and Jane". She has been conned into participating in two separate <b>pyramid</b> schemes, one <b>selling</b> Herbalife-inspired health food products, the other selling kitchen utensils.|$|R
50|$|A {{range of}} selling methods that intend to mislead the {{consumer}} are illegal under the Fair Trading Act: The Act {{also applies to}} certain activities {{whether or not the}} parties are 'in trade' - such as employment advertising, <b>pyramid</b> <b>selling,</b> and the supply of products covered by product safety and consumer information standards.|$|E
5000|$|Multi-level marketing, {{abbreviated}} as MLM, {{also called}} <b>pyramid</b> <b>selling,</b> network marketing, and referral marketing, is a controversial marketing {{strategy for the}} sale of products and/or services where the revenue of the MLM company is derived from a non-salaried workforce (also called participants, and variously known as [...] "salespeople", [...] "distributors", [...] "consultants", [...] "promoters", [...] "independent business owners", etc) selling the company's products/services, while the earnings of the participants is derived from a pyramid-shaped commission system.|$|E
5000|$|The Church of Scientology and {{its many}} related {{organizations}} have amassed considerable real estate holdings worldwide, {{likely in the}} hundreds of millions of dollars. Scientology encourages existing members to [...] "sell" [...] Scientology to others by paying a commission to those who recruit new members. Scientology franchises, or missions, must pay the Church of Scientology roughly 10% of their gross income. On that basis, it is likened to a <b>pyramid</b> <b>selling</b> scheme. While introductory courses do not cost much, courses at the higher levels may cost several thousand dollars each. As a rule, the great majority of members proceeds up the bridge in a steady rate commensurate with their income. Most recently the Italian Supreme Court agreed with the American IRS that the church's financial system is analogous to the practices of other groups and not out of line with its religious purposes.|$|E
50|$|In Australia, The Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC), after researching Lyoness for a while, instituted {{proceedings}} against Lyoness International AG, Lyoness Asia Limited, Lyoness UK Limited and Lyoness Australia Pty Limited (together ‘Lyoness’) {{for operating}} a <b>pyramid</b> <b>selling</b> scheme {{and engaging in}} referral selling. The ACCC alleges that Lyoness has operated the scheme in Australia from mid-2011 and that it continues to operate the scheme. The scheme offers ‘cash back’ rebates to members who shop through a Lyoness portal, use Lyoness vouchers or present their Lyoness card at certain retailers. Whilst cash back offers themselves are not prohibited by the Australian Consumer Law, the ACCC alleges that the Lyoness scheme also offers commissions to members who recruit new members who make {{a down payment on}} future shopping. The ACCC is seeking declarations, pecuniary penalties, injunctions, an order requiring the Lyoness website to link to the case report and costs. As Lyoness International AG, Lyoness Asia Limited and Lyoness UK Limited are located overseas, the ACCC will be making arrangements for service on those entities. The case is before Justice Flick of the Federal Court in Sydney. Lyoness have submitted their defence in October 2014, and the next hearing will be in February 2015. Australian victims claim to have lost thousands of dollars each to Lyoness. The trial has ended and the judgment was reserved. In Greece, an arrest warrant was issued in August 2015 against the Austrian directors of Lyoness Greece. On the 10th of August 2015 the Prosecutor of Thessaloniki Court of First Instance issued an arrest warrant against Herbert Teissel and his wife Anna Teissel, alleged directors of Lyoness Greece, for attempted fraud. Lyoness vehemently denies all allegations.|$|E
