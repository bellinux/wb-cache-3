40|$|This paper {{present a}} {{constructive}} solution {{proposed by the}} authors {{in order to achieve}} of a cutting and extracting device for the decommissioning of the horizontal fuel channels in the CANDU 6 nuclear reactor. One of {{the most important part of}} the decommissioning device is the Cutting and Extraction Device (CED) which perform the dismantling, cutting and extraction of the fuel channel components. This flexible and modular device is designed to work inside the fuel channel. The main operations performed by the Cutting and Extraction Device (CED) are dismantling and extraction of the channel closure plug and shield <b>plug,</b> <b>cutting</b> and extraction of the pressure tube. The Cutting and Extraction Device (CED) consists of following modules: guiding-fixing module, traction modules, cutting module, guiding-extracting module and articulated elements for modules connecting. The guiding-fixing module is equipped with elastic guiding rollers and fixing claws in working position, the traction modules are provided with variable pitch rollers for allowing travel speed change through the fuel channel. The cutting module is positioned in the middle of the device and it is equipped with three roll knives for pressure tube cutting, having a system for cutting place video surveillance and pyrometers for cutting place monitoring temperature. The operations performed by the Cutting and Extraction Device (CED) of fuel channel are as follows: unblock and extract the channel closure plug, unblock and extract the channel shield plug, block and cut the middle of the pressure tube, block and cut the end of the pressure tube, block and extract the half of pressure tube. The Cutting and Extraction Device (CED) is fully automated, connected by wires to a Programmable Logic Controller (PLC) and controlled from a Human Machine Interface (HMI). The design of the Cutting and Extraction Device (CED) shall be achieved according to the particular features of the fuel channel components to be dismantled and to ensure radiation protection of workers...|$|E
50|$|Compaction {{of ceramic}} powders is a {{specific}} forming technique for ceramics. It is {{a process in which}} ceramic granular materials are made cohesive through mechanical densification, involving (hot pressing) or not (cold forming) temperature exposition.The process permits an efficient production of parts ranging widely in size and shape to close tolerances with low drying shrinkage. Traditional (for instance: ceramic tiles, porcelain products) and structural (for instance: chip carriers, spark <b>plugs,</b> <b>cutting</b> tools) ceramics are produced.Cold compaction of ceramic powders ends up with the realization of the so-called green piece, which is later subject to sintering.|$|R

50|$|Talking to Wilson, House has an idea. Teddy has an Arnold-Chiari malformation, a {{narrowing}} in {{the base}} of his skull. Teddy's therapy caused his brain to swell just enough to <b>plug</b> the opening, <b>cutting</b> off his CSF. His brain pressing against his pituitary caused the other symptoms. He declares that he has chosen the life he wants to lead, that he loves his fiancee and wants to get married. She says she must make her choice and cannot marry him.|$|R

[...] "Before I Go Out" [...] {{is more of}} a roots rocker, complete with background harmonica. [...] "No Promises" [...] is a piano ballad that is heartfelt without veering into cheesy territory. It's a balanced and robust and shows off White's skills as a musician and songwriter.|$|R
5000|$|The {{most common}} type of power driven tap is the [...] "spiral point" [...] <b>plug</b> tap, whose <b>cutting</b> edges are {{angularly}} displaced relative to the tap centerline. This feature causes the tap to continuously break the chip and eject it forward into the hole, preventing crowding. Spiral point taps are usually used in holes that go {{all the way through the}} material, so that the chips can escape. Another version of the spiral point plug tap is the spiral flute tap, whose flutes resemble those of a twist drill. Spiral flute taps are widely used in high speed, automatic tapping operations due to their ability to work well in blind holes.|$|R
5000|$|In 1999, Italian {{stone cutting}} equipment, {{originally}} {{designed for use}} in Tuscany's marble quarries was imported by Albion Stone and applied to the extraction of Portland stone. This new technology eliminated the need for blasting, significantly improved the quarries' environmental performance and removed the potential for any possible damage to the stone being quarried through shock. Full account of the local jointing pattern is made when deciding the position and orientation of cuts. Once the quarry faces have been cut, the stone is gently displaced hydraulically. This is done using [...] "hydro-bags", which are thin, flat, steel bags or envelopes that when inflated with water under moderate pressure, are capable of producing the forces necessary to loosen the stone {{to the point where}} it can be easily removed using large wheeled loaders. Splitting stone, using pneumatic drills is arduous work and so wire-saws have been introduced into the quarries, replacing much of the <b>plug</b> and feather <b>cutting.</b>|$|R
40|$|To better {{understand}} Tibetan orogenesis, which involves complex tectonic processes, here we report the first integrated analysis of Hf isotopes of zircon separates and their host rocks from the Transhimalayan batholiths. The rocks studied include 19 granitoids from {{different parts of}} the Gangdese batholith, the largest Transhimalayan intrusive complex, and five postcollisional adakites that occurred as <b>plugs</b> or dikes <b>cutting</b> the Gangdese batholith, in the southern Lhasa terrane, southern Tibet. Published zircon Hf isotope data from other Transhimalayan granitoids and the Linzizong volcanic rocks are also synthesized. The magmatic zircons, crystallizing between ca. 200 and 15. Ma, show depleted mantle-type Hf isotopic characteristics throughout the Mesozoic but shift markedly in the Paleogene. The Hf isotopic shift is interpreted as tracking the evolving progress of Himalayan sediment subduction driven by the approaching Indian continent, and thus signals the initiation of the India-Asia collision that we infer to have occurred by 55. Ma. Our data furthermore indicate that southern Tibet underwent significant crustal thickening during ca. 45 and 30. Ma, before emplacement of the postcollisional adakites that exhibit Hf-Nd isotopic systematics suggesting binary mixing of melts from the juvenile Gangdese mafic crust and incorporated Himalayan sediments in the petrogenesis. 8 page(s...|$|R
40|$|Unconventional {{shale gas}} exploration, production, and {{utilization}} in North America {{over the last}} 15 years has had {{a major impact on}} the hydrocarbon industry. Despite this, these unconventional plays are amongst the least understood of all hydrocarbon exploration targets and shale gas exploration and development remain largely untapped outside of North America. The Cooper Basin is considered {{to be one of the}} most highly prospective basins for shale gas in Australia. Within the Cooper Basin, the lacustrine shales of the Permian Murteree and Roseneath formations represent two of the best targets for exploration and form the focus of this thesis. Core <b>plugs</b> and well <b>cuttings</b> from 40 wells in the Cooper Basin, along with associated wireline logs and seismic data were investigated in this study. Lithofacies identification, organic petrology thermal maturity analysis, and geochemistry, as well as rock properties and biomarker study, were compiled and used as input parameters in petrophysical, depositional, mineralogical, and thermal maturity modelling of the Cooper Basin. Using these models, prospective shale horizons for exploration targets were identified and evaluated. The results from this study indicate that the Murteree Shale has the potential to produce commercial quantities of hydrocarbon economically because of a significant volume of kerogen (for adsorbed gas), good thermal maturity, good porosity, and because it has significant amounts of brittle minerals and producible hydrocarbon. Specifically, the Murteree Shale exhibits excellent shale gas potential in and around Nappameri, Patchawarra and Tenappera troughs, but has poor potential in Allunga Trough. In contrast, the Roseneath Shale shows moderate potential in each of these areas, and is overall, less prospective unit for commercial shale gas production. The combination of different techniques provides a holistic approach for evaluating shale gas potential throughout the basin, and these approaches offer considerable advantages for further exploration in the Cooper Basin...|$|R
