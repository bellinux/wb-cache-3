40|$|Aim of {{this study}} was to assess {{relationships}} between response to bronchodilation with tiotropium plus salbutamol and computed-tomography-based emphysema severity measures in patients with COPD of the emphysematous phenotype. Forty-four consecutive patients (38 males and 6 females) who met inclusion criteria for lung volume reduction, were included in a prospective nonrandomized study. Following in-hospital 48 h-washout from all bronchodilators, spirometry and plethysmography were performed before and after administration of tiotropium (18 µg) and salbutamol (200 µg). Morphology of emphysema measures including degrees of severity (ES) (possible scores: 12 - 48) and heterogeneity (HT) (possible scores: 0 - 3) were graded on thin section high-resolution computed tomography slices by a previously validated visual scoring system. Mean age was 63  8. 4 years. Scores in ES and HT were 31  5 and 1. 25  0. 6, respectively.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: In a {{prospective}} non-randomized study, we compared results {{and costs of}} non-resectional lung volume reduction surgery (LVRS) performed through awake or non-awake anesthesia that was freely chosen by recruited patients. METHOD: Non-resectional LVRS was performed by epidural anesthesia in 41 patients (awake group) and by general anesthesia in 19 patients (non-awake group). Perioperative outcome included analysis of oxygenation (PaO(2) /FiO(2)) at fixed time points and global {{time spent in the}} operating room (anesthesia plus surgery plus weaning plus recovery times). Costs were evaluated at discharge. Forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV(1)), <b>plethysmographic</b> <b>residual</b> <b>volume</b> (RV(plet)) and maximal incremental treadmill test (MITT) score were assessed preoperatively and every 6 months, postoperatively. RESULTS: Perioperative outcome was better in the awake group with better oxygenation 1 h after the operation (P= 0. 004) and shorter global in-operating room stay (P< 0. 0001). There was no operative mortality. In the awake group, median hospital stay was shorter (6 days vs 7 days, P= 0. 006), whereas median hospital charges were lower than in the non-awake group (7800 euros vs 8600 euros, P= 0. 006). At 6 months, there was no difference (awake vs non-awake) in median ΔFEV (0. 33 l vs 0. 28 l, P= 0. 09), ΔRV (- 0. 99 l vs - 0. 98 l, P= 0. 95), and ΔMITT score (1. 0 vs 0. 75, P= 0. 31). CONCLUSION: In our study, awake non-resectional LVRS was preferred by the majority of patients. It resulted in better perioperative outcome, shorter hospital stay, and lower costs than equivalent procedures performed by non-awake anesthesia. Six months' clinical results were comparable, showing that the awake approach had no impact on late clinical benefit...|$|E
40|$|SummaryRationaleCombination {{therapy with}} {{corticosteroid}} and long-acting β 2 -agonists (LABA) {{in a single}} inhaler is associated with superior effects on airway function and exercise performance in COPD compared with LABA monotherapy. The physiological effects of adding inhaled corticosteroid monotherapy to maintenance bronchodilator therapy (long-acting anticholinergics and LABA singly or in combination) in COPD are unknown. MethodsThis was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover study (NCT 00387036) to compare the effects of inhaled fluticasone propionate 500  μg (FP 500) twice-daily and placebo (PLA) on airway function during rest and exercise, measured during constant work rate cycle exercise at 75 % of maximum incremental cycle work rate, in 17 patients with COPD (FEV 1  ≤  70 % predicted). ResultsAfter treatment with FP 500 compared to PLA, there were significant increases in post-dose measurements of FEV 1 (+ 115  mL, P =  0. 006) and the FEV 1 /FVC ratio (+ 2. 5 %, P =  0. 017), along with decreases in <b>plethysmographic</b> <b>residual</b> <b>volume</b> (− 0. 32 L; P =  0. 031), functional residual capacity (− 0. 30 L, P =  0. 033), and total lung capacity (− 0. 30 L, P =  0. 027) but no changes in vital capacity or inspiratory capacity (IC). Post-treatment comparisons demonstrated a significant improvement in endurance time by 188  ±  362  s with FP 500 (P =  0. 047) with no concomitant increase in dyspnea intensity. End-inspiratory and end-expiratory lung volumes were reduced at rest and throughout exercise with FP 500 compared with PLA (P <  0. 05). ConclusionInhaled FP 500 monotherapy was associated with consistent and clinically important improvements in FEV 1, static lung volumes, dynamic operating lung volumes, and exercise endurance when added to established maintenance long-acting bronchodilator therapy in patients with moderate to severe COPD...|$|E

METHOD This is an experiment involving samples from vials of antibiotics {{used in a}} pediatric hospital. <b>Residual</b> <b>volume</b> was identified by calculating the difference in weight measurement {{before and after the}} vials were washed. Evaluation of the <b>residual</b> <b>volume</b> difference in the vials was determined by the Wilcoxon non-parametric test for a sample and established at a significance level of 5 %. RESULTS 105 samples of antibiotics were selected. The correct use of the antibiotics oxacillin (88. 57 %) and ceftriaxone (94. 28 %) predominated with low residual values. The same did not occur for procaine benzylpenicillin + potassium benzylpenicillin, since a greater <b>residual</b> <b>volume</b> was discarded in 74. 28 % of the vials. CONCLUSION We highlight the need for improvements in managing antibiotics in the institution under study, so that the excess volume of the antibiotics in the vials is used within the acceptable stable time.

40|$|In multiple-inlet coastal {{systems like}} the western Dutch Wadden Sea, the tides (and their {{interaction}} with the bathymetry), the fresh water discharge, and the wind drive a residual flow through the system. In the current paper, we study {{the effect of the}} wind on the <b>residual</b> <b>volume</b> transport through the inlets and the system as a whole on both the short (one tidal period) and long (seasonal or yearly) time scales. The results are based on realistic three-dimensional baroclinic numerical simulations for the years 2009 - 2011. The length of the simulations (over 2000 tidal periods) allowed us to analyze a large variety of conditions and quantify the effect of wind on the <b>residual</b> <b>volume</b> transport. We found that each inlet has an anisotropic response to wind; i. e. the <b>residual</b> <b>volume</b> transport is much more sensitive to the wind from two inherent preferential directions than from any other directions. We quantify the effects of wind on the <b>residual</b> <b>volume</b> transport through the system and introduce the concept of the system's conductance for such wind driven residual transport. For the western Dutch Wadden Sea, the dominant wind direction in the region is close to the direction with the highest conductance and opposes the tidally driven <b>residual</b> <b>volume</b> transport. This translates a large variability of the <b>residual</b> <b>volume</b> transport and a dominance of the wind in its long-term characteristics in spite of the episodic nature of storms...|$|R
40|$|Objectives: Optimal {{results in}} bullectomy depend {{on both the}} size of the resected bulla volume and the reexpansion of the {{adjacent}} collapsed healthy pulmonary parenchyma. We hypothesized that the bigger the bulla is compared with <b>residual</b> <b>volume,</b> the greater are the possible benefits. We suggested a new prognostic classification according to bulla volume and its relationship with <b>residual</b> <b>volume.</b> Methods: We retrospectively reviewed 121 patients with emphysematous bulla (> 200 mL) who, from 1996 to 2006, underwent unilateral single (n = 64), unilateral multiple (n = 16), bilateral 1 -stage (n = 9), and bilateral 2 -stage (n = 32) bullectomies. Bulla <b>volume</b> and <b>residual</b> <b>volume</b> were measured by computed tomography and body plethysmography, respectively. Six-month postoperative decrement of <b>residual</b> <b>volume</b> values and their persistence below the baseline for 5 years were considered primary outcomes. Logistic regression was used to select significant variables. The receiver operating characteristic curve was used to identify the cutoff point for a possible classification system. Results: There was no postoperative mortality. Significant postoperative improvements in respiratory function were found and correlated with bulla size. <b>Residual</b> <b>volume</b> improved in 75 patients (62 %) and persisted in 20 patients (35 % of the patients followed for > 5 years). Logistic regression selected bulla/residual volume ratio as the most predictive variable for both outcomes (P <. 0001). The best cutoff individuated by the receiver operating characteristic curve analysis was 20 % to achieve a high probability of <b>residual</b> <b>volume</b> improvement and 30 % to minimize <b>residual</b> <b>volume</b> recurrence. Conclusions: Bullectomy provides good results, but more significant and long-lasting improvements are achievable with a greater ratio bulla/residual volume: scant for less than 20 %, good but temporaneous for 20 % to 30 %, and good and long-lasting results for more than 30 %...|$|R

40|$|Tight coil packing with {{density of}} at least 20 %- 25 % {{is known to be}} {{important}} for preventing recanalization after embolization of cerebral aneurysms. However, large aneurysms sometimes recanalize regardless of the packing density, suggesting that the absolute <b>residual</b> <b>volume</b> which is determined by aneurysm volume and packing density may be more important risk factor for recanalization. To validate this hypothesis, we analyzed the factors affecting the outcomes of treated aneurysms at our institute. We included 355 small and large aneurysms. The following six factors were obtained from every case: aneurysm volume (mL), neck size (mm), packing density (%), <b>residual</b> <b>volume</b> (mL), rupture status at presentation, and stent assistance (with or without stent). The data were then subjected to multivariate logistic regression analysis to identify significant risk factors for recanalization. Recanalization occurred in 61 aneurysms (17. 2 %). Significant predictors for recanalization were aneurysm volume (odds ratio, 15. 3; P < 0. 001) and <b>residual</b> <b>volume</b> (odds ratio, 30. 9; P < 0. 001), but not packing density (odds ratio, 0. 98; P = 0. 341).

The most influential risk factor for recanalization after coil embolization was <b>residual</b> <b>volume,</b> not packing density. The larger the aneurysm volume, the greater the packing density has to be to minimize the <b>residual</b> <b>volume</b> and risk of recanalization. Since tight coil packing has already been aimed, further innovation of coil property or embolization technique may be needed.

OBJECTIVE: To assess the associations between airflow limitation, pulmonary volume and X-ray findings in patients with cystic fibrosis. METHOD: A cross-sectional retrospective study. Review of spirometric, plethysmographic, and chest X-ray findings of outpatients (age ³ 16 years). The airflow findings were classified as within normal limits or as airflow obstruction: mild, moderate or severe obstructive alteration. RESULTS: A total of 23 patients (15 male and eight female; mean age, 21 ± 5. 9 years) were studied. Six of them were within normal limits, four had a mild, five had a moderate, and eight had a severe obstructive alteration. There was an association between airflow limitation and the increase of <b>residual</b> <b>volume</b> (p = 0. 006) and also with the Brasfield score (p = 0. 001), {{but not with the}} total lung capacity (p = 0. 33).

40|$|This {{thesis is}} focused on the {{development}} of a software program which is able to control adaptively the feed speed level during a finishing operation of milling of free-formed surfaces. Final machining speeds depend on <b>residual</b> <b>volumes</b> that are left on the surface after the roughing operation. The theoretical part of the thesis deals with problems based on <b>residual</b> <b>volumes.</b> There are descriptions of up-to-date solutions of this problem by CAD/CAM systems and research teams. The main part of the work is the development of a regulation algorithm. This algorithm is able to regulate the feed speed at every single moment of machining in dependence of the <b>residual</b> <b>volumes.</b> An example of a free-formed surface machining with and without optimizing of the feed speed, force records and comment are described in the experimental part of the thesis. The presentation of time saving by using the optimizing software is described in the conclusion. Available from STL Prague, CZ / NTK - National Technical LibrarySIGLECZCzech Republi...|$|R
