Following a series of pilot studies in which the methodology was tested, sets of adverts provided by the sponsor were assessed in 3 separate conditions, each with a different group of 50 subjects. Participants were female, aged between 25 and 50, and mainly responsible for their household shopping, representing the 'housewife'demographic Lever Faberge targets with FMCG advertising. In condition 1 the subjects were exposed to a set of 32 Poster adverts, in condition Z 32 Magazine adverts and in condition 3, 14 Direct Marketing (DM) adverts. A combination of eyetracking and questionnaire methods were used. Three sets of questionnaires aimed to assess purchase behaviour, measure consumer attitudes towards the adverts and capture the brand associations that were being formed. Fixations for each advert from the intermediate eyetracking session were analysed across each group of participants, in terms of attention in specific areas of interest (AOls) defined earfier. These represented the major advertising components e. g. brand name, <b>pack</b> <b>shot,</b> slogan. AOI fixations were evaluated in terms of the overall % of fixations, overall % of fixation time, % of initial fixations (within 1000 msec) and average fixation duration. Results showed specific types of advert elicited the most positive attitudes, having some influence on how the brand was perceived. These adverts were generally simple with a straightforward message, and best liked with high impact. Brand recall was not always negatively affected by negative ad attitudes. Attention patterns across adverts with fewer A Ols were easier to predict, and there appeared to be optimum positions for specific AOls to increase the proportion of first fixations. The non-uniforin stimuli meant overall eye-movement observations could be presented but strict predictive models could not be applied.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{deals with}} the problem of video advertising avoidance by TV and Internet viewers. It focuses on the counterintuitive but systematic detrimental impact that brands (logos, trademarks <b>pack</b> <b>shots)</b> as well as emotional evoking scenes (joyous and surprising) may have on commercials avoidance (zapping). Theoretical and empirical support is provided for each phenomenon as well as rigorously tested methods to counteract the negative aspects of branding and emotional scenes without loosing their clear benefits. In Chapter 1, I develop a conceptual framework for understanding the impact that branding activity (the audio-visual representation of brands) and consumers’ dispersion of attention have on their moment-to-moment avoidance decisions during television advertising. I formalize this in a Dynamic Probit Model and estimate it with MCMC methods. New, simple metrics of attention dispersion are shown to strongly predict avoidance. I optimize the branding activity under marketing control for ads in the sample to reduce commercial avoidance. This reveals that pulsing the brand presence [...] while keeping total brand exposure constant [...] decreases commercial avoidance significantly. In Chapter 2, I study the concomitant effect of two positive emotions, joy and surprise, moment-to-moment on both the viewer’s visual attention and on their avoidance decisions (zapping) of Internet commercials. To do so, I propose a novel non-obtrusive means to automatically capture and classify emotions via images from their facial expressions while, at the same time, tracking their eye-movements. Using a simultaneous version of the model in Chapter 1, I find that Joy reduces zapping momentarily with little persistent effect and that this is largely a direct effect, with minimal influence on attention distraction. I also find that Surprise works mainly indirectly by momentarily reducing zapping but at the expense of causing major attentional distraction. The implication for advertisers is that Joyous ads should improve over time, ending strong. As for using Surprise, the risk in showing the unexpected is to loose the viewer’s engagement with the story line...|$|R

60|$|Seeing him now determinately coming, with {{pitchfork}} valiantly presented, Israel, {{as a last}} {{means of}} practising on the fellow's fears of the supernatural, suddenly doubled up both fists, presenting them savagely towards him {{at a distance of}} about twenty paces, at the same time showing his teeth like a skull's, and demoniacally rolling his eyes. The man paused bewildered, looked all round him, looked at the springing grain, then across at some trees, then up at the sky, and satisfied at last by those observations that the world at large had not undergone a miracle in the last fifteen minutes, resolutely resumed his advance; the pitchfork, like a boarding-pike, now aimed full at the breast of the object. Seeing all his stratagems vain, Israel now threw himself into the original attitude of the scarecrow, and once again stood immovable. Abating his pace by degrees almost to a mere creep, the man at last came within three feet of him, and, pausing, gazed amazed into Israel's eyes. With a stern and terrible expression Israel resolutely returned the glance, but otherwise remained like a statue, hoping thus to stare his pursuer out of countenance. At last the man slowly presented one prong of his fork towards Israel's left eye. Nearer and nearer the sharp point came, till no longer capable of enduring such a test, Israel took to his heels with all speed, his tattered coat-tails streaming behind him. With inveterate purpose the man pursued. Darting blindly on, Israel, leaping a gate, suddenly found himself in a field where some dozen laborers were at work, who recognizing the scarecrow--an old acquaintance of theirs, as it would seem--lifted all their hands as the astounding apparition swept by, followed by the man with the pitchfork.

Eight minutes later, Archerfish turned east and submerged in preparation to attack. Enright ordered his torpedoes set for a depth of 10 ft in case they ran deeper than set; he also intended to increase the chances of capsizing the ship by punching holes higher up in the hull. A few minutes later, Shinano turned south, exposing her entire side to Archerfish—a nearly ideal firing situation for a submarine. The escorting destroyer on that side passed right over Archerfish without detecting her. At 03:15 Archerfish fired six torpedoes before diving to 400 ft to escape a depth charge attack from the escorts.|$|R
40|$|Concrete {{structure}} {{are designed}} to be able for providing an optimum service towards influences or forces both from the outside and also from inside of the structure. These influences and forces are the caused, which the structure will result in a failure such as cracking, concrete degradation, and reinforcement corrosion. Concrete cracking are consist of hair cracks and structural cracks. Hair cracks are most likely caused from concrete drying process, while structure cracks are mostly caused by errors on planning and also because of poor implementation. Concrete degradation is the process of reduction in concrete strength, which is increasingly lower than its concrete capacity. Reinforcement corrosion is caused from the process of concrete weathering around the reinforcement, which directly influence the dimension of the reinforcement. To implement concrete structure refinement technology, detection, observation, evaluation, and analysis are required to be done. Wherein the first indication is emphasized on concrete cracking, whether it was a new or old cracks and the type of the cracks. Aside from that concrete weathering also needs to be checked. The instruments used are sound test, rebound hammer, and ultrasonic pulse velocity test. To determine crack width, crack compactor, brittle liquid coating and linear variable differential transformer are used. Here strength of the concrete also needs to be determining by hammer test and core drill system. Concrete structure refinement technology, aside from considering the mean of its improvement, is also highly dependent on the damage. The aims of this technology are to increase the capacity and improve the performance of the structure. Aimed at concrete weathering refinement, the damage part is removed for then replaced with new concrete mixture. The substitute concrete can be from dry <b>packing,</b> mortar, grouting, <b>shot</b> crating, and pre packed concrete. For the active cracks type, the technologies to be used are painting and concrete injection. Similarly if the analysis result is require replacing the reinforcement, replacement should be performed including the possibility of adding concrete reinforcement. ...|$|R
