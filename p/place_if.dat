5|$|Approval for the mission, codenamed Operation Chariot, {{was given}} on 3 March 1942. Using a French ship would involve using the Free French forces and {{increase}} the number of people aware of the raid. Consequently, it was decided the navy would have to provide a ship of their own. The RAF complained that the raid would draw heavily on their resources; the number of aircraft assigned by RAF Bomber Command was reduced time and time again before the day of the raid. British Prime Minister Winston Churchill further complicated matters when he ordered that bombing should only take <b>place</b> <b>if</b> targets were clearly identified.|$|E
5|$|As {{both teams}} {{were in the}} highest tier of English football, the Premier League, Arsenal and Manchester United entered the {{competition}} in the third round.

5|$|In September 2006, Thompson brought another $600 million {{lawsuit against}} Cody Posey, Rockstar Games, Take-Two Interactive, and Sony Computer Entertainment. The lawsuit claimed that 14-year-old Posey {{played the game}} obsessively before murdering his father, stepmother, and stepsister on a ranch in Hondo, New Mexico. Posey's defense team argued that he was abused by his father and was taking Zoloft {{at the time of}} the killings. The suit alleged that the murders would not have taken <b>place</b> <b>if</b> Posey had not obsessively played Vice City. The case was {{dismissed}} in December 2007, as New Mexico held no jurisdiction over Sony or Take-Two.|$|E

5|$|All of {{the final}} venues, apart from four, have been in London with most being played at the {{original}} Wembley Stadium, which was used from 1923 until the stadium closed in 2000. The other venues that {{were used for the}} final prior to 1923 were Kennington Oval, Crystal Palace, Stamford Bridge and Lillie Bridge, all in London, Goodison Park in Liverpool and Fallowfield Stadium and Old Trafford in Manchester. The Millennium Stadium in Cardiff hosted the final for six years (2001–2006), while the new Wembley Stadium was under construction. Other grounds have been used for replays, which until 1999 took <b>place</b> <b>if</b> the initial match ended in a draw. The new Wembley Stadium has been the permanent venue {{of the final}} since 2007.|$|E
5|$|Heading {{into the}} final race of the season, Ferrari driver Michael Schumacher had already won the season's Drivers' Championship, having {{clinched}} the title at the previous race, the Japanese Grand Prix. Schumacher led the championship with 98 points; McLaren driver Mika Häkkinen was second on 86 points. A maximum of 10 points were available for the remaining race, which meant Häkkinen could not catch Schumacher. Behind Michael Schumacher and Häkkinen in the Drivers' Championship, David Coulthard was third on 67 points, ahead of Rubens Barrichello in fourth on 58 points. Barrichello {{was still able to}} clinch third <b>place</b> <b>if</b> he took victory in the race and Coulthard finished outside of the top six. Although the Drivers' Championship was decided, the Constructors' Championship was not. Ferrari were leading on 156 points, and McLaren were second on 143 points, with a maximum of 16 points available.|$|E
5|$|The {{province}} has a unicameral Westminster-style parliamentary government, {{in which}} the Premier {{is the leader of}} the party that controls the most seats in the House of Assembly. The Premier is Newfoundland and Labrador's head of government, and the Queen of Canada is its head of state and is represented by the Lieutenant Governor of Newfoundland and Labrador. The Premier picks a cabinet from the elected members to form the Executive Council of Newfoundland and Labrador, and presides over that body. Members are first elected to the House during general elections. General elections must be conducted every four years from the date of the last election. An election may also take <b>place</b> <b>if</b> the governing party loses the confidence of the legislature by the defeat of a supply bill or tabling of a confidence motion.|$|E

5|$|After {{the ruler}} of the other {{dimensional}} realm Outworld, Shao Kahn, conquered the realm of Edenia and merged it with his own, he decided he would keep the former king's daughter Kitana alive and raise her as his own. Though she grew up knowing nothing of her origin, the emperor nonetheless feared that one day Kitana would discover her true parentage and turn against him, and so he ordered Shang Tsung to bring to life a more vicious and loyal version of Kitana that could take her <b>place</b> <b>if</b> necessary. This was done by fusing her essence with a Tarkatan warrior from Baraka's race. The process was not a complete success, however, as the hybrid clone was disfigured with the hideous mouth of the Tarkata. Instead of replacing Kitana, as originally planned, Mileena {{would be used to}} spy on her and to ensure her allegiance to him, and so Shao Kahn introduced Mileena to Kitana as her supposedly lost twin sister. The two thus grew up together as his daughters and elite personal assassins, although Mileena grew to harbor a great bitterness and jealousy towards Kitana, whom Kahn favored over her.|$|E
5|$|In these {{conflict}} of laws cases, Apple met with conflicting international judicial opinions: an Australian court decision conflicted with a Canadian court decision on the copyrightability of object code. In IBM v. Computer Imports, the High Court of New Zealand then considered these prior decisions and sided with the Canadian decision in ruling that, although object code is not an original literary work in its own right, it is a reproduction of source code in material form and therefore an infringement of copyright takes <b>place</b> <b>if</b> it is copied without the authorization of the copyright owner. Such legal conflicts affected not only Apple, but all other software companies as well, and the conflicts remained unresolved until {{the creation of an}} international legal regime embodied in further changes to national copyright laws, which ultimately made object code subject to copyright law. These revisions of law in favor of making object code subject to copyright law are still controversial. The revisions also form the technical underpinnings (via the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA) and the Electronic Communications Privacy Act) for the legal notions of electronic privacy violation and computer trespass, as well as the further development of anti-hacking law-making such as the Patriot Act and the Convention on Cybercrime.|$|E
5|$|Plans {{called for}} Hubble to be {{serviced}} in February 2005, but the Columbia disaster in 2003, {{in which the}} orbiter disintegrated on re-entry into the atmosphere, had wide-ranging effects on the Hubble program. NASA Administrator Sean O'Keefe decided that all future shuttle missions {{had to be able}} to reach the safe haven of the International Space Station should in-flight problems develop. As no shuttles were capable of reaching both HST and the ISS during the same mission, future crewed service missions were canceled. This decision was assailed by numerous astronomers, who felt that Hubble was valuable enough to merit the human risk. HST's planned successor, the James Webb Telescope (JWST), was not expected to launch until at least 2018. A gap in space-observing capabilities between a decommissioning of Hubble and the commissioning of a successor was of major concern to many astronomers, given the significant scientific impact of HST. The consideration that JWST will not be located in low Earth orbit, and therefore cannot be easily upgraded or repaired in the event of an early failure, only makes these concerns more acute. On the other hand, many astronomers felt strongly that the servicing of Hubble should not take <b>place</b> <b>if</b> the expense were to come from the JWST budget.|$|E
