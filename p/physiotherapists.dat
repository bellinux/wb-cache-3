25|$|In 2004 the Pharmacy Council of Pakistan (PCP) {{approved}} {{the awarding of}} a Doctor of Pharmacy (PharmD), a five-year professional degree. This {{was followed by the}} Doctor of Physical Therapy (DPT), approved by the Pakistan Physical Therapy Association (PPTA) in 2010. The use of the title of Doctor by pharmacists and <b>physiotherapists</b> holding these degrees is disputed. In March 2015, the PCP affirmed its use by holders of the PharmD, following a similar affirmation in November 2014 by the Punjab Pharmacy Council.
