40|$|Abstract The {{effects of}} iron {{limitation}} on photoacclimation to a dynamic light regime were studied in Phaeocystis antarctica. Batch cultures were grown under a sinusoidal light regime, mimicking vertical mixing, under both iron-suffi-cient and-limiting conditions. Iron-replete cells responded {{to changes in}} light intensity by rapid xanthophyll cycling. Maximum irradiance coin-cided with maximum ratios of diatoxanthin/dia-dinoxanthin (dt/dd). The maximum quantum yield of photosynthesis (Fv/Fm) was negatively related to both irradiance and dt/dd. Full recovery of Fv/Fm {{by the end of}} the light period suggested successful photoacclimation. Iron-limited cells displayed characteristics of high light acclimation. The ratio of xanthophyll pigments to chlorophyll a was three times higher compared to iron-replete cells. Down-regulation of photosynthetic activity was moderated. It is argued that under iron limitation cells maintain a permanent state of high energy quenching to avoid photoinhibition during exposure to high irradiance. Iron-limited cells could maintain a high growth potential due to an increased absorption capacity as recorded by in vivo absorption, which balanced a decrease in Fv/Fm. The increase in the chlorophyll a-specific absorption cross section was related to an increase in carotenoid pigments and a reduc-tion in the <b>package</b> <b>effect.</b> These experiments show that P. antarctica can acclimate successfully to conditions as they prevail in the Antarctic ocean, which may explain the success of this species...|$|E

The absorption coefficient of phytoplankton at 443 urn ranged from 0. 006 m(- 1) to 0. 484 m(- 1), with an average value of 0. 067 m(- 1). The chlorophyll-specific absorption coefficient of phytoplankton is also a bio-optical variable, with a spectrally averaged value of 0. 025 m(2) (.) mg(- 1).

The corrections required for absorption coefficients include determining increased optical pathlength while corrections for fluorescence include determining system spectral variability, mean light level and reabsorption. The empirical technique is consistent with and validated by theoretical relationships for light transmission and fluorescence of absorbing particulate material embedded in a medium with intense scattering. These methods were applied to a study of photoadaptation in several phytoplankton species and revealed variations in the blue for chlorophyll α specific absorption [αph*(λ) ] and fluorescence excitation [F*(λ) ] of greater than 3 − and 10 -fold, respectively. Variations in the spectral shapes and the magnitude of αph*(λ) and F*(λ) with photoadaptation are determined largely by the effect of pigment absorption in discrete particles, {{sometimes referred to as}} the sieve or <b>package</b> <b>effect.</b> A model is presented expressing F*(λ) in terms of α*(λ) which predicts large variability in F*(λ) due to cell size and cellular pigmentation and which may help reconcile the previously reported, but unexplained variations in F*(λ).
