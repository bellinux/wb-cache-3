In this method, the use of toxic reagents, such as mercury thiocyanate, commonly employed in most spectrophotometric techniques for chloride determination, is avoided.

This characteristic allows the determination of chloride in ground, surface and wastewaters using the same manifold. In addition, a considerable saving of <b>precipitating</b> <b>reagent</b> is achieved due to noncontinuous consumption.

To analyse EV-encapsulated circulating miRNA, we searched for a quick, easy and economic method to enrich frozen human serum samples for EV. We compared the efficiency of several protocols and commercial kits to isolate EVs. Different methods based on precipitation, columns or filter systems were tested and compared with ultracentrifugation, {{which is the most}} classical protocol to isolate EVs. EV samples were assessed for purity and quantity by nanoparticle tracking analysis and western blot or cytometry against major EV protein markers. For biomarker validation, levels of a set of miRNAs were determined in EV fractions and compared with their levels in total serum. EVs isolated with precipitation-based methods were enriched for a subgroup of miRNAs that corresponded to miRNAs described to be encapsulated into EVs (miR- 126, miR- 30 c and miR- 143), while the detection of miR- 21, miR- 16 - 5 p and miR- 19 a was very low compared with total serum.

This falsely increases values for HDL cholesterol, and, to avoid it, dilution of the specimen is usually recommended. There are two approaches to this dilution (1). One is to dilute the original specimen with an equal volume of isotonic saline before adding the precipitating reagents (pre-precipitation dilution). The second is to dilute the turbid supernate with an equal volume of isotonic saline that contains the same concentration of pre-cipitating reagent as does the superna-tant fluid (post-precipitation dilution). In our laboratory with a phospho-tungstate/MgC 12 <b>precipitating</b> <b>reagent</b> and enzymatic quantitation, the pro-precipitation dilution produced HDL cholesterol results that averaged 10 % lower than the post-precipitation dilu-tion. This discrepancy was greatest when HDL cholesterol values exceeded 400 mg/L.

The method involved indirect antibody capture (AbCap) of intact viruses followed by release of virion genomic RNA and reverse transcriptase PCR for amplification and oligoprobe hybridization for detection. The procedure involved concentrating enteric viruses from large volumes of water by standard filtration-elution techniques with IMDS filters and 1 liter of 1 % beef extract- 0. 05 M glycine (BE/G) as an eluate.

Three measurements of Ouchterlony precipitates were made; d 1 and d 2 indicate diffusion from sample or reagent wells, ? indicates arc length. Mean values for ?, estimating quantity, were IgAA (11. 3 mm) and IgAB (11. 6 mm) and IgAJ (8. 3 mm). The crescent shape IgAJ arc and its slower diffusion (d 1) suggested its molecular weight is greater than either IgAA or IgAB. Arc lengths of individual samples were not significantly correlated suggesting that these are independent components of bile. Oral Salmonella enteritidis challenge resulted in a highly significant difference in bile IgA profiles. The IgAJ arc lengths (?) in R¿ hens increased by 20 % over those in nonchallenged R¿ hens.

The IgG quantity was unaffected by either efficiency type or S. enteritidis challenge. The IgM was detected in only 2 of 59 (3. 4 %) specimens.

30|$|The {{synthesis}} of nanoparticles by reverse microemulsions is viable and attractive {{because it does}} not only produce nanoparticles that have a narrow size distribution, but also the particle size can be controlled by varying the microemulsion composition [15]. The reaction in a microemulsion may be conducted in two modes: (1) a multiple microemulsion method, where two or more microemulsions, each containing one reactant, are mixed together [16]. Upon mixing, the droplets collide with one another {{as a result of the}} Brownian motion. These collisions lead to the formation of product monomers [7, 17, 18]. Nucleation takes place in a given droplet when the number of product monomers exceeds the critical nucleation number [19 – 21]. Further collisions between a droplet carrying a nucleus and another one carrying the product monomers cause the growth of the nucleus [19, 22]; (2) in the simple addition type, the reducing or <b>precipitating</b> <b>reagent</b> is directly added to the microemulsion containing the other reactant [23, 24], i.e., this mode promotes intramicellar nucleation and growth [22, 25]. When particles are formed in single microemulsions, their size and polydispersity are controlled by one or more of the following mechanisms: reaction kinetics, intramicellar nucleation and growth, intermicellar nucleation and growth, and particle aggregation [26, 27]. A variation of this synthetic path could proceed by replacing the counterion of the surfactant, and only then the addition of a salt to this reverse microemulsion media. This last method has been successfully used to synthesize nanoparticles using the anionic surfactant AOT [28], for instance, for the case of cobalt ferrocyanide salt nanoparticles [29]. However, to the best of our knowledge, there is no report on the modification of cationic surfactants with ionic coordination compounds such as the cetyltrimethylammonium ferrocyanide [CTAFeII].|$|E

40|$|Experiments were {{conducted}} in which three selected metals-contaminated mine drainage water samples were treated by chemical precipitation followed by flotation using colloidal gas aphrons (CGAs) to concentrate the precipitates. Drainage water samples used in the experiments were collected from an abandoned turn-of-the-century copper mine in south-central Wyoming, an inactive gold mine in Colorado's historic Clear Creek mining district, and a relatively modern gold mine near Rapid City, South Dakota. The copper mine drainage sample was nearly neutral (pH 6. 5) while the two gold mine samples were quite acidic (pH {approx} 2. 5). Metals concentrations ranged from a few mg/L for the copper mine drainage to several thousand mg/L for the sample from South Dakota. CGAs are emulsions of micrometer-sized soap bubbles generated in a surfactant solution. In flotation processes the CGA microbubbles provide a huge interfacial surface area and cause minimal turbulence as they rise through the liquid. CGA flotation can provide an inexpensive alternative to dissolved air flotation (DAF). The CGA bubbles are similar in size to the bubbles typical of DAF. However, CGAs are generated at ambient pressure, {{eliminating the need for}} compressors and thus reducing energy, capital, and maintenance costs associated with DAF systems. The experiments involved precipitation of dissolved metals as either hydroxides or sulfides followed by flotation. The CGAs were prepared using a number of different surfactants. Chemical precipitation followed by CGA flotation reduced contaminant metals concentrations by more than 90 % for the copper mine drainage and the Colorado gold mine drainage. Contaminant metals were concentrated into a filterable sludge, representing less than 10 % of the original volume. CGA flotation of the highly contaminated drainage sample from South Dakota was ineffective. All of the various surfactants used in this study generated a large sludge volume and none provided a significant concentration factor with this sample. For the two samples where CGA flotation was effective, the separation was very rapid and the concentrate volume was reduced when compared to gravity separation under similar conditions. Effective separations were achieved with very low chemical dosages and low residence times, suggesting the possibility of economic viability for processes based on this concept.

The seminal plasma contains some 50 % of its total solids as organic material, part {{of which may be}} readily precipitated by 5 % trichloroacetic acid; it is well known, however, that many seminal proteins, peptones, and proteoses are not <b>precipitated</b> by this <b>reagent</b> (Mann, 1954). The function of the organic material in invertebrate seminal plasma is little understood; {{it is well known that}} in some invertebrates, at least, it is of little importance as a respiratory substrate, since the latter is derived from endogenous phospholipid material (Rothschild & Mann, 1950; Rothschild & Cleland, 1952; Mori, 1959 a, b). The present analyses were made in order to determine in more detail the nature of the organic material present in the plasma, so that its contribution to the physical and biological properties might be more accurately assessed. MATERIAL AND METHODS The plasma was obtained as previously described (Barnes, 1962 a), although th...|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} {{we examine the}} role of the {{classical}} pathway in the complement-mediated solubilization of immune <b>precipitates</b> (CRA). Serum <b>reagents</b> were depleted of the alternative pathway components properdin and factor D. Both depleted reagents lack CRA although they have almost intact hemolytic activity. Also, immune complexes were not solubilized when incubated with high concentrations of the classical pathway components (C 1, C 4, C 2, and C 3. We conclude that CRA is not mediated by the classical pathway alone. Activation of the classical pathway by the immune aggregates greatly enhances CRA. The effect of the classical pathway is to deposit C 3 b on the antigen-antibody lattice and promote the assembly of a lattice-associated, properdin-dependent C 3 -convertase. Although C 3, C 4, and properdin were detected on complexes solubilized by serum in the presence of Ca++ and Mg++, only C 3 and properdin were found on the complexes when Ca++ had been chelated by ethylene glycol-bis-(beta-aminoethyl ether), N,N'-tetraacetic acid. In both situations the aggregates were capable of converting C 5 in the fluid phase. However, no C 5 was found on the solubilized complexes. These findings suggest that in contrast to nascent C 3 b and C 4 b, nascent C 5 - 9 lacks binding affinity for immune aggregates...|$|R
