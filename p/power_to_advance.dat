Those in favor of regional planning found some success, however, in the 1965 creation of the East-West Gateway Coordinating Council, a regional council given the <b>power</b> <b>to</b> <b>advance</b> applications for federal aid from cities in the region. Among the more controversial proposals {{to come from the}} East-West Council was the proposal to build a second regional airport, located somewhere on the Illinois side of the region. In spite of initial approval for the plan in the 1976, Secretary of the Interior Brock Adams canceled the airport project in 1977 under political pressure from Missourians, who feared a loss of business at Lambert International Airport.|$|E

2500|$|The [...] "political model" [...] – termed so by Meyer and Gupta {{because it}} [...] "operates most openly in government, where {{a change in}} regime is {{followed}} swiftly by changes in policy and criteria used to assess policy outcomes" [...] (1994, p.354) – has organizations seeking to maximize {{a specific set of}} performance measures. Under this model, though, metrics are defined by the top-level managers' preferences. Performance criteria and the measurement thereof are generally consistent within regimes; however, as the regimes themselves change over from one to the other, so do these measures. So while this model incorporates changing performance measures like performance paradox, because change is associated with some level of disruption and instability, agents view change in performance measures negatively and seek to avoid it. Furthermore, maximizing on performance measures is unlikely to bring about entirely positive outcomes because executive agents generally set goals while engaging in rent-seeking, using <b>power</b> <b>to</b> <b>advance</b> their own interests (whether they be acquiring more power, money etc.).|$|E

Porter used his appointment <b>powers</b> <b>to</b> <b>advance</b> the women's cause, appointing women to a variety of positions in state agencies, but primarily to board positions overseeing the state's benevolent institutions, like hospitals and orphanages.

40|$|This article {{gives an}} {{overview}} of small power problem focusing on the behav­iour of small power states within coalitions and their proneness to free riding. To pursue an independent agenda and increase their significance within large associa­tions, the authors argue, small <b>powers</b> tend <b>to</b> create ‘coalitions within coalitions’, essentially acting as free riders and transferring costs and political responsibility for decision-making to larger players. Such an asymmetric strategy makes it possi­ble for small <b>powers</b> <b>to</b> <b>advance</b> their interests within alliances and save resources. The authors test this hypothesis on the behaviour of the Baltics in the European Union. It is demonstrated that Lithuania, Latvia, and Estonia have created a stable small coalition within the EU and actively form ad hoc alliances with the leading states to push union-level decisions, {{as it was the}} case with settling the migrant issue. In other areas, these states tend to benefit from the free rider behaviour. ...|$|R

6000|$|I cannot {{agree with}} Mr. Churton Collins ("Jonathan Swift," [...] pp. 59-61) in suspecting Swift {{of a special}} policy of self-interest in writing the [...] "Project." [...] Swift was too honest a man to use the {{religious}} sentiment {{for the purpose of}} counteracting any bad impression his previous writings had made on those who had the <b>power</b> <b>to</b> <b>advance</b> him. However much he might delight in the possession of high worldly station, he would never so prostitute himself to obtain it. Nor did he care to let the world into the secret of his heart. Indeed, all his life Swift seemed to hide, almost jealously, the genuine piety of his nature. Whatever suspicion of policy has surrounded the tract must be ascribed to the well-intentioned letter of the Earl of Berkeley above quoted; and the Earl would not have written thus had he felt Swift's motive to be any other than a purely impersonal one.|$|E

Finding that all endeavours to seduce them into drunkenness were now vain, these wretches first tried to raise the country against Brainerd, by reporting {{that he was a}} Roman Catholic in disguise; and when this failed, they laid claim to the lands of Crossweeksung, in discharge of debts that they declared to have been previously contracted. Fortunately, Brainerd had it in his <b>power</b> <b>to</b> <b>advance</b> 82l. from his private means, so as to save his people from this extortion; but he afterwards thought it best to remove them from these dangerous neighbours to a new settlement, fifteen miles off, called Cranberry. He remained himself in his little hut at Crossweeksung, after they had proceeded to raise wigwams and prepare the ground for maize; but, whenever he rode over to visit them, his approach was notified by the sound of a conch shell, and they all gathered round for his prayers and instruction.|$|E
40|$|Sub-national island jurisdictions (SNIJs) {{manifest}} diverse {{expressions of}} govern- ance within typically asymmetrical relationships {{with a much}} larger state. Dubbed ‘federacies’ {{in the literature on}} federalism, these bilateral systems of self- and shared-rule arise almost exclusively on islands. The jurisdictional powers that island federacies enjoy are principally a result of bilateral negotiations between island political elites and a (usually benign) metropole. This bargain is struck against the backdrop of a particular colonial inheritance, a local ‘sub- nationalist’ culture, and the varying ambitions of local elites <b>to</b> win jurisdictional <b>powers</b> <b>to</b> <b>advance</b> ‘sub-national’ territorial interests. At other times, however, island autonomies arise as crafted, deliberate devolutions of central governments eager to exploit islands as ‘managed’ zones for economic or security-related activity in a globalised economy. In either case sub-national autonomies often show more success and resilience as non-sovereign island jurisdictions than their sovereign island-state counterparts. peer-reviewe...|$|R

6000|$|In {{considering}} {{the question of}} the development of man by known natural laws, we must ever bear in mind the first principle of [...] "natural selection," [...] no less than of the general theory of evolution, that all changes of form or structure, all increase in the size of an organ or in its complexity, all greater specialization or physiological division of labour, can only be brought about, in {{as much as it is}} for the good of the being so modified. Mr. Darwin himself has taken care to impress upon us, that [...] "natural selection" [...] has no power to produce absolute perfection but only relative perfection, no <b>power</b> <b>to</b> <b>advance</b> any being much beyond his follow beings, but only just so much beyond them as to enable it to survive them in the struggle for existence. Still less has it any power to produce modifications which are in any degree injurious to its possessor, and Mr. Darwin frequently uses the strong expression, that a single case of this kind would be fatal to his theory. If, therefore, we find in man any characters, which all the evidence we can obtain goes to show would have been actually injurious to him on their first appearance, they could not possibly have been produced by natural selection. Neither could any specially developed organ have been so produced if it had been merely useless to him, or if its use were not proportionate to its degree of development. Such cases as these would prove, that some other law, or some other power, than [...] "natural selection" [...] had been at work. But if, further, we could see that these very modifications, though hurtful or useless at the time when they first appeared, became in the highest degree useful at a much later period, and are now essential to the full moral and intellectual development of human nature, we should then infer the action of mind, foreseeing the future and preparing for it, just as surely as we do, when we see the breeder set himself to work with the determination to produce a definite improvement in some cultivated plant or domestic animal. I would further remark that this enquiry is as thoroughly scientific and legitimate as that into the origin of species itself. It is an attempt to solve the inverse problem, to deduce the existence of a new power of a definite character, in order to account for facts which according to the theory of natural selection ought not to happen. Such problems are well known to science, and the search after their solution has often led to the most brilliant results. In the case of man, there are facts of the nature above alluded to, and in calling attention to them, and in inferring a cause for them, I believe that I am as strictly within the bounds of scientific investigation as I have been in any other portion of my work.|$|E
