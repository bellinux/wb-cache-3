Cataloged from PDF version of thesis report. Includes bibliographical references (page 47). On {{the basis of a}} number of arguments by procurement experts and from findings of some international organizations on International Open Tendering Method (IOTM) procurement procedures, this study has sought to investigate the extent of its practices and major challenges at the procurement for projects implemented in Bangladesh by the Local Government Engineering Department (LGED). This study has started with reviewing different aspects of IOTM through literature review. It has found that there exist differences in IOTM procurement procedures followed by different donor agencies like World Bank, ADB, IDB, DFID, USAID etc. It has found that IOTM as an essential system in implementing major and complicated public works in Bangladesh particularly by the LGED. Openness and transparency in IOTM is a must. There is no scope of corruption in decision making process of tender evaluation stage. This study also finds that procurement guideline of World Bank and ADB is very strong and play dominant roles in the procurement policy process. It works in a well structured framework. There exist strong internal control and accountability mechanisms making decision making process unique. In-depth investigation depicts that procurement official have the willingness and proper attitude to serve the people. This study also reveals structural, managerial as well as efficiency problems in the IOTM procurement. World Bank and ADB’s procurement guideline is still flexible and decentralized. Official jobs for procurement, authority and responsibilities are clearly specified. Both the World Bank and the ADB emphasized in favor of delegating financial power to the procurement officials. They felt that there is scope for improving the information disclosure system. Concepts like responsibility, transparency and good governance exist in <b>procurement</b> <b>guidelines</b> of the World Bank and the ADB. If structural deficiencies can be eliminated, level of ensuring efficiency of using IOTM procurement will be enhanced. This study concludes that the total time required for invitation of tender, evaluation and contracting is less than that of PPR 2008 of Bangladesh in the International Procurement of works. According to the ADB <b>Procurement</b> <b>guidelines</b> 6 to 8 weeks are needed from advertising to Evaluation and Contracting for the procurement of works internationally and according to the WB <b>Procurement</b> <b>guidelines,</b> 6 to 13 weeks are needed from advertising to Evaluation and Contracting for the procurement of works internationally. On the other hand, according to PPR 2008 <b>Procurement</b> <b>guidelines,</b> 6 to 12 months are needed from advertising to evaluation and contracting for the procurement of works internationally which is too much. But the time required from invitation of tender to evaluation and contracting depends on donors. The World Bank, ADB and JICA (Japan) takes less time compared to others. SFD and IDB take more time for concurrence and approval. So, for smooth implementation of projects having major and complicated works in public sector of Bangladesh in general and for LGED in particular the existing time frame in the PPR 2008 for procurement through IOTM procedure should be reviewed.

40|$|December 2006. "Thesis (M. S.) [...] Wichita State University, College of Engineering, Dept. of Mechanical Engineering. Today transit buses are an {{integral}} part of the national transportation system. According to National Transportation Statistics from 1990 to 2002, the number of transit motor buses in the U. S. has increased 30 percent. Although buses are one of the safest means of transportation, occupant injuries and fatalities in bus crashes do occur. Rollover strength has become an important issue for bus and coach manufacturers. Today European regulation “ECE-R 66 ” is in force to prevent catastrophic rollover accidents. The Standard Bus <b>Procurement</b> <b>Guidelines</b> (SBPG) of the American Public Transit Association (APTA) also mentions the roof crush test for the assessment of bus superstructure and roof. This thesis discusses the development of a finite element (FE) model of a bus, and the analysis of its roof crush and rollover in LS-DYNA. The FE model was validated for the roof crush test carried according to the standard bus <b>procurement</b> <b>guidelines</b> (SBPG). ADAMS-View software was used to simulate the rollover of the bus. Bus accelerations, velocities, and its angle with the ground just before impact were measured in ADAMS and then used as input for the LSDYNA analysis. According to the ECE-R 66 regulation, a passenger’s survival space is defined in the bus model to check whether there is any intrusion into the survival space during or after the rollover. This ensures that the bus structure has sufficient strength to avoid intrusions into the survival space. The effect of passengers’ weight on energy absorbed by the bus structures during rollover is also discussed. Development of the MADYMO bus model and its rollover simulations were also included in this research. Dummy kinematics and injuries sustained during rollover for various seated and standing positions were studied as well...|$|E

40|$|Problem statement: This study {{examined}} the public procurement system as prevalent in the Malaysian government system of administration. Various aspects of public procurement are outlined including types and the processes that entail public procurement. This study also highlighted the weaknesses in the manual public procurement processes that are opened to potential abuse and mismanagement resulting in corruption. This study places the Malaysian Government public procurement system under the spotlight zeroing on allegations of abuse, tampering and corrupt practices. The study concluded that {{the large amount of}} funds allocated to public procurement coupled with excessive human intervention opportunities opened avenues that increase the risk of system abuse, profiteering and corruption. Case studies on the abuse and corruption of the public procurement system highlight the need for the Malaysian Government to eliminate the loopholes in the system, arrest the rot and implement a transparent, efficient and accountable public procurement system. Approach: Documents from the Ministry of Finance on public procurement including, among others, the <b>Procurement</b> <b>Guideline</b> Book, The Financial Procedures Act 1957, the Treasury Instructions (TI) and the Treasury Circular Letter (TCL) were scrutinized in studying the Malaysian Government public procurement system, its various attributes, types and processes that reflect a diversified approach to public procurement. Three case studies were cited to illustrate the susceptibility of the system to abuse and corruption. Results: Despite claims of openness and transparency of the public procurement system, it was found the current system is replete with the risk of abuse, unethical manipulations and corrupt practices. This research is limited to the analysis of data and processes related to the Malaysian Government public procurement system. The sensitivity of the subject may inhibit the collection of empirical data via surveys or interviews. Records of court cases involving corruption offered clues to areas in the system prone to human intervention. Conclusion: This research helps identify areas of improvement in the Malaysian Government public procurement system and thus raises the possibility of enormous cost savings and the eradication of rampant corruption and abuse. This study shows that, while the public procurement system may be available in the Malaysian Government system of administration, weaknesses in the public procurement processes may open avenues for corruption to take place. Corruption stemming from a procurement system weak on aspects of check and balance will cause a major drain on the national budget and can result in a huge loss of public funds.

40|$|Sustainable {{construction}} is about achieving {{a balance between}} the social, economic and environmental aspects of construction so that the costs and the benefits, evaluated along these three dimensions, are optimised. In the light of the huge expenditure of the UK public sector on construction, the benefits that can be gained from integrating sustainability into construction procurement can be very significant. The aim of this thesis is to develop a theoretical framework to assist UK public clients in addressing sustainability issues in construction projects' procurement strategies. The objectives include: (1) developing agreed sets of social, economic, and environmental sustainability criteria that should be addressed by UK public clients in developing a procurement strategy; (2) identifying the factors that are important to better address sustainable construction by UK public clients in developing a procurement strategy; (3) identifying potential barriers (4) identifying the parties that are most capable of removing such barriers; (5) identifying whether or not local authorities are addressing sustainability in their <b>procurement</b> strategies, policies, <b>guidelines</b> and procedures; and (6) identifying how public clients are addressing sustainability in their <b>procurement</b> strategies, policies, <b>guidelines</b> and procedures. The components of the theoretical framework were derived from a thorough analysis of information obtained {{from a variety of sources}} (e. g. public sector practitioners, academics, professionals/consultants, and contractors) and throught the utilisation of a variety of research methods and techniques within a triangulated approach. These included (1) a Delphi Exercise in which 17 experts in sustainability participated, (2) interviews with 9 key professionals and experts, (3) a questionnaire survey to which 132 local authorities in the UK responded, and (4) two case studies of local authorities demonstrating good practice in sustainable procurement. Triangulation was utilised within and across the methods and the techniques adopted. It facilitated the access to different levels of reality, through combining qualitative and quantitative methods. Validation of the parts of the framework was conducted in several ways. These included validating the findings from each Delphi round in the subsequent round, validating the findings obtained from one method or technique by utilising another; and facilitating comments by the respondents/interviewees regarding any of the items included in the questionnaires/interview guides used in this research.

40|$|Weapons {{programs}} are criticized for cost overruns, delays in delivery {{and failure to}} meet their operational requirements. Critics focus on the power and influence of the military-industrial-political complex. This chapter addresses these controversial areas involving arms industries, alternative procurement policies and industrial policy. Arms industries are defined and statistics are presented on the world's arms industries. They can be analyzed as economically strategic industries where both R&D and production quantities are important and lead to decreasing cost industries reflecting economies of scale and learning. A structure-conduct-performance approach is applied. Market conduct is assessed including defense R&D {{and the role of}} the military-industrial-political complex. Market performance is reviewed by assessing contract performance, firm productivity and profitability and exports. Governments are central to understanding arms markets and weapons procurement raises both theory and policy issues. There are principal-agent problems and issues of adverse selection, moral hazard, risk sharing and bilateral monopoly. Various types of contract are available, each with different efficiency incentives. Governments can also use their buying power to determine the size, structure and performance of a nation's defense industrial base (DIB). The benefits and costs of a national DIB are assessed and three policy issues and challenges are reviewed. These are the role of competition in arms procurement, its extension to military outsourcing and the profitability of non-competitive contracts. Alternative industrial policies are a further aspect of <b>procurement</b> policy. <b>Guidelines</b> for a defense industrial policy in a military alliance are outlined together with an assessment of European collaborative programs.

Methods and Patients: We analyzed clinical features, potential risk conditions, and problems in 129 brain dead patients during the apnea test. The diagnosis of brain death was made according to the American Academy of Neurology recommendations. Results: Clinical problems during the apnea test were detected in more than two thirds of patients, including: arterial hypotension (12 &#x 0025;), acidosis (68 &#x 0025;), and hypoxemia (23 &#x 0025;). Four patients developed major complications, including: pneumothorax, cardiac arrest, bradycardia, atrial fibrillation and myocardial infarction. Conclusion: The apnea test is not an innocuous procedure. Complications during the AT are more common than reported and limit organ <b>procurement</b> for transplantation. <b>Guidelines</b> for performing the AT should be followed in order to avoid clinical complications...|$|R
