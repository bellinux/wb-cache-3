40|$|Background Antibiotic {{prophylaxis}} is used {{to reduce}} the incidence of postoperative infection. For antibiotics to be used as prophylaxis duration should not exceed 24 hours in many of the procedures. Single preoperative dose of antibiotics is as effective as full day course therapy assuming uncomplicated procedure. It should target anticipated organism and is unnecessary if the patient is already receiving antibiotics that cover the likely pathogens. It should be given within one hour before incision commonly at the time of induction of anaesthesia and during prolonged procedures antibiotics should be readministred every 3 hours with the exception of vancomycin, aminoglycosides and fluoroquinolones. However, many studies show that these guidelines are not followed. Many studies show use of <b>prophylactic</b> <b>antibiotics</b> when there is no clear indication for antibiotic prophylaxis, inappropriate drug use or duration of prophylaxis may be prolonged leading to increasing length of hospital stay, hospital cost, morbidity and mortality. This study was conducted to evaluate <b>prophylactic</b> <b>antibiotics</b> practices in elective surgical operation at MNH. Methods: Hospital based descriptive study of <b>prophylactic</b> <b>antibiotics</b> use among elective surgical patients. A total of 1146 elective operation done from July 2012 to January 2013 were included in the study. Prospective surgical audit of these elective surgeries were done using a structured questionnaire which was used to collect information on social demographic profile, operative information of timing of <b>prophylactic</b> <b>antibiotics</b> admininistration, postoperative antibiotic time, type of operation and choice of antibiotic given was done. Study population: All elective surgeries done during July 2012 to January 2013 Data analysis: was done using an SPSS computer program. Results: The majority of the respondents had primary education 68. 8 % with higher education being the least (3. 7 %). Among elective operation done there were 743 (64. 8 %) male and 403 (35. 2 %) female. Proportionally more patients were sixty years and above at 27. 7 %. Among elective surgery done at MNH 84. 5 % received <b>prophylactic</b> <b>antibiotics.</b> xii Eighty eight point four percent (88. 4 %) of clean contaminated wound which was eligible for <b>prophylactic</b> <b>antibiotics</b> received <b>prophylactic</b> <b>antibiotics.</b> However 72. 1 % of clean wound, 25 % of contaminated and 83. 3 % of dirty wound received <b>prophylactic</b> <b>antibiotics.</b> <b>Prophylactic</b> <b>antibiotic</b> was administered to 89. 4 % of elective surgery patients in which there were external incision and 64 % in which there were no external incision. The majority (57. 3 %) received <b>prophylactic</b> <b>antibiotics</b> one hour before surgery, and few (8. 3 %) received <b>prophylactic</b> <b>antibiotics</b> intraoperatively. The majority 836 (86. 4 %) stopped <b>prophylactic</b> <b>antibiotics</b> more than five days post operatively while a few 0. 9 % stopped <b>prophylactic</b> <b>antibiotics</b> within twenty four hours post surgery. No additional prophyalactic antibiotics was given Intraoperatively. The majority of patients who underwent thyroidectomy(58. 2 %) received both metronidazole and ceftriaxone. Patients who underwent cystectomy almost half (47. 8 %) received ceftriaxone alone and half (47. 8 %) received both ceftriaxone and metronidazole. Overall combination of ceftriaxone and metronidazole were the most used <b>prophylactic</b> <b>antibiotics</b> (47. 2 %) followed by ceftriaxone alone (42. 2 %). Conclusion: Elective clean surgeries received unnecessary <b>prophylactic</b> <b>antibiotics.</b> Some clean contaminated surgeries did not receive <b>prophylactic</b> <b>antibiotics.</b> Contaminated and dirty elective surgeries received <b>prophylactic</b> <b>antibiotics.</b> <b>Prophylactic</b> <b>antibiotic</b> has been given post surgery in some of the surgeries. No additional prophyalactic antibiotics was given intraoperatively for the elective surgeries lasting more than 3 hours. <b>Prophylactic</b> <b>antibiotics</b> has been prolonged post surgeries given in more than five days in the majority of elective surgeries. Combination of ceftriaxone and metronidazole was the most used <b>prophylactic</b> <b>antibiotics</b> followed by ceftriaxone alone. Recommendations: MNH should establish <b>prophylactic</b> <b>antibiotics</b> guideline which should be open and accessible by every member of the surgical team. Medical checklist should be practiced effectively. Frequent audit of <b>prophylactic</b> <b>antibiotics</b> use is needed to improve proper practices (<b>prophylactic</b> <b>antibiotics</b> uses).

40|$|Background/PurposeTo {{evaluate}} {{the effect of}} a form recording the timing of <b>prophylactic</b> <b>antibiotic</b> administration, antibiotics used, and treatment duration on the proper use of <b>prophylactic</b> <b>antibiotics</b> in patients undergoing four types of operations. MethodsThis was a retrospective study in a 682 -bed, university-affiliated, tertiary teaching hospital. Using the form developed, nurse practitioners recorded the timing of <b>prophylactic</b> <b>antibiotic</b> administration, antibiotics used, and treatment duration for patients undergoing three types of clean operations (total hip replacement, total knee replacement, thyroidectomy) and one type of clean-contaminated operation (hemorrhoidectomy). Patient records were identified by chart review after searching the hospital database. A case was defined by a principal or secondary procedure code for the four types of operations. Patients who received therapeutic antibiotics for documented preoperative infection were excluded. ResultsA significant improvement (p < 0. 001; OR, 33. 768; 95 % CI, 4. 304 - 264. 951) in the use of <b>prophylactic</b> <b>antibiotics</b> was noted between the pre-intervention and intervention periods. Among the three criteria of antibiotic usage, the improvement in the appropriate timing of <b>prophylactic</b> <b>antibiotics</b> was significant (p < 0. 001; OR, 46. 247; 95 % CI, 5. 891 - 363). The accuracy of the <b>prophylactic</b> <b>antibiotic</b> form in recording the timing of antibiotic administration, the choice of antibiotics, and the treatment duration was 84. 2 % (16 / 19), 89. 4 % (17 / 19), and 100 % (19 / 19), respectively. ConclusionThe <b>prophylactic</b> <b>antibiotic</b> form effectively decreased the inappropriate use of <b>prophylactic</b> <b>antibiotics.</b> Due to its high degree of reliability, this infection control measure {{can be used as a}} continuous monitoring system for <b>prophylactic</b> <b>antibiotic</b> use...|$|R
40|$|Background and Objectives: Surgical site {{infection}} (SSI) is {{the most}} common nosocomial infection encountered in post operative surgical wards. The use of <b>prophylactic</b> <b>antibiotic</b> in clean elective surgical cases is still a subject of controversy to surgeons. The objective of the study is to identify the need for using <b>prophylactic</b> <b>antibiotics</b> in clean surgeries, prevalence of organisms in patients who are not given <b>prophylactic</b> <b>antibiotics</b> and to study whether the presence of risk factors increase the incidence of surgical site infection. Methodology: The comparative study consists of 100 cases admitted under two groups of 50 each: Group A was given <b>prophylactic</b> <b>antibiotic</b> and Group B didn’t receive any. All surgeries other than clean surgical cases were excluded from the study.

30|$|However, <b>prophylactic</b> <b>antibiotics</b> are {{commonly}} administered for the TVT procedure based on empirical grounds [1]. Postoperative {{infection in the}} “clean-contaminated” [6] TVT surgical field carries the ominous hazard of spreading to the neighbouring tissues and forming pelvic abscesses. Hence, as widely recommended for operations similar to the TVT that involve potential exposure to bacteriologic pathogens [7 – 16], <b>prophylactic</b> <b>antibiotics</b> are used routinely to minimise the possibility of TVT-related infections.

40|$|Background: Cesarean {{delivery}} is a surgical operation which {{is applied to}} prevent maternal and fetal complications. Cesarean {{delivery is}}n’t without complication and has some complications such as infection. Postoperative infection includes endometritis, wound infection and septic pelvic thrombophlebitis that depend to <b>prophylactic</b> <b>antibiotics</b> and surgical technique. The {{aim of this study}} was comparison of post operative infection after single dose and three doses of <b>prophylactic</b> <b>antibiotic</b> regimens.. Material and Methods: This double blind randomized clinical trial was performed on all pregnant women referd to the Vali-Asr Hospital of Zanjan University of Medical Sciences and underwent cesarean delivery during one year from starting study. Participants subsequently were randomized into two groups: A (recieved single dose of <b>prophylactic</b> <b>antibiotic)</b> and B (recieved three doses of <b>prophylactic</b> <b>antibiotic).</b> Subjects were checked up for the clinical signs of infection during hospitalization and 10 days after discharge. The results were analyzed by SPSS Software Ver 16 and Chi-Square Test. Results: During one year, 146 pregnant women with cesarean delivery entered 2 equal groups (A and B) which each group had 73 subjects. During hospitalization after cesarean delivery, 5 (6. 8 %) patients of group A and 2 (2. 7 %) patients of group B had fever. There was no significant correlation between the two groups.

40|$|AbstractThe {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} the use of antibiotic prophylaxis for plastic surgical procedures at our hospital, and to perform a systematic literature review of randomized controlled trials evaluating the use of <b>prophylactic</b> <b>antibiotics</b> in plastic surgery. The records of patients who received plastic surgical procedures with Class I surgical incisions between 2009 and 2010 were retrospectively reviewed. A systematic literature review was conducted for studies examining the use of <b>prophylactic</b> <b>antibiotics</b> for Class I surgical wounds. A total of 13, 997 cases with Class I surgical incisions were included. <b>Prophylactic</b> <b>antibiotics</b> were given in 13, 865 cases (99. 1 %). The antibiotics used were primarily cefuroxime, clindamycin, metronidazole, cefoxitin sodium, and gentamicin. The average duration of administration was 4. 84  ±  3. 07 (range, 1 – 51) days. Antibiotics were administered postoperatively in > 99 % of cases while preoperative antibiotic administration was only given in 32 cases (0. 23 %). Wound infections occurred in 21 cases for an overall infection rate of 0. 15 %. Fourteen studies met the inclusion criteria of the systematic review.
