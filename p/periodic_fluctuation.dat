50|$|When {{mitochondrial}} pyruvate uptake that blocked ROS {{increase was}} inhibited, {{there was no}} prevention of mitochondrial fragmentation in high glucose conditions. Ultimately, {{the researchers found that}} mitochondrial fragmentation mediated by the fission process is a necessary component for high glucose-induced respiration increase and ROS overproduction. Extended exposure to high glucose conditions are similar to untreated diabetic conditions, and so the effects mirror each other. In this condition, the exposure creates a periodic and prolonged increase in ROS production along with mitochondrial morphology change. If mitochondrial fission was inhibited, the <b>periodic</b> <b>fluctuation</b> of ROS production in a high glucose environment was prevented. This research shows that when cell damage to the ROS is too great, PARP-1 will initiate cell death.|$|E

50|$|Information from {{a variety}} of sense organs {{provides}} information about joint positions and movements. The most elaborate proprioceptive sense organ is the muscle spindle. It is unique because its functional state is continually controlled from the brain through the fusimotor system. Recordings from muscle spindle afferents indicate that the fusimotor system remains largely passive when the parent muscle is relaxed whereas is it regularly activated in voluntary contractions and more so the stronger the contraction. Thus microneurography suggests a parallelism between the two motor systems, i.e. the skeletomotor system controlling the ordinary muscle fibers and the fusimotor system. This seems to hold at least for weak contractions and small movements which have been explored so far. In contrast, more independent fusimotor activity has been reported in animal experiments, mainly cat hind limb, where larger movements are allowed. Thanks to fusimotor activation, the afferent signal from muscle spindles remains efficient in monitoring large changes of muscle length without turning silent during muscle shortening. On the other hand, very small intramuscular events are monitored as well, thanks to the extreme sensitivity of the sense organ.An example is the small pulsatile component of the muscle contraction which is due to a <b>periodic</b> <b>fluctuation</b> at 8-10 Hz of the motor command. These small variations are insentient but readily monitored by the population of spindle afferents. They are akin to the tremor we may experience when emotionally excited. The functional significance of the insentient spindle response to faint intramuscular events remains to be assessed. However, it seems likely that detailed information on large as well as small mechanical events in the muscles is essential for neural systems in the brain to produce appropriate commands for dexterous movements.|$|E

The regular and fractal shapes of the basin of attraction are used to validate the Melnikov predictions. In the absence of parametric damping, the results show that an increase of the tilt angle of the excitation causes the lower bound for chaotic domain to increase and produces a singularity at the vertical position of the excitation.

Coherent <b>periodic</b> <b>fluctuation</b> in origination/extinction of marine genera that survive 45 million years) do {{not participate in}} the <b>periodic</b> <b>fluctuation</b> in diversity and differ from those of "short-lived" genera. The difference between the evolutionary dynamics of these 2 genera classes indicates that the periodic pattern is not an artifact of variation in quality of the geologic record. The interplay of these two previously undifferentiated systems, together with the secular increase in abundance of "long-lived" genera, is probably the source of heretofore unexplained differences in evolutionary dynamics between the Paleozoic and post-Paleozoic as reported by others. Testing for cycles similar to the 62 Myr cycle in fossil biodiversity superimposed on the long-term trends of the Phanerozoic as described in Paper I, we find a significant (but weaker) signal in sedimentary rock packages, particularly carbonates, which suggests a connection. The presence of a periodic pattern in evolutionary dynamics of the vulnerable "short-lived" component of marine fauna demonstrates that a long-term <b>periodic</b> <b>fluctuation</b> in environmental conditions capable of affecting evolution in the marine realm characterizes our planet. Coincidence in timing is more consistent with a common cause than sampling bias. A previously identified set of mass extinctions preferentially occur during the declining phase of the 62 Myr periodicity, supporting the idea that the periodicity relates to variation in biotically important stresses. Further work should focus on finding links to physical phenomena that might reveal the causal system or systems. Comment: Paleobiology, in press. 74 pages, 13 figure...|$|E
30|$|The {{appearance}} {{and evolution of}} CO 2 bubbles can be quantitatively investigated using micro particle-image-velocimetry (µPIV) technique, as have been reported by Burgmann and coworkers [7, 8]. They found that the cell performance decay {{is closely related to}} the formation cycles of bubble slugs. An alternative method presented by Numaguchi and co-workers characterized the influence of the CO 2 bubbles in anode flow field by detecting the pressure drop along the channels [9]. Results show that the pressure drop may become unstable with a larger <b>periodic</b> <b>fluctuation</b> when current density of the cell is increased. As a result, the periodic accumulation and excretion of the CO 2 bubbles in the flow fields were observed, and the <b>periodic</b> <b>fluctuation</b> of the cell voltage will accordingly occur during this process. Buie et al. [10] and Yang et al. [11] further demonstrated the importance of capillary forces by determining the anode pressure drop in a liquid-feed DMFC.

(2007) explained that the oscillation was caused by the resonance of the acoustic waves that propagated vertically between the ground surface and the lower thermosphere. The resonance is predicted to be limited to the vicinity of the source region, because it was established by the vertical reflection of the acoustic wave.

40|$|Populations can go extinct {{when their}} environments deteriorate, but {{evolutionary}} rescue {{occurs when a}} shrinking population adapts to the new environmental conditions. The emergence of resistance from a drug sensitive bacterial population under treatment {{can be regarded as}} an instance of evolutionary rescue. Understanding evolutionary rescue in a particular context such as drug resistance requires knowledge of how the environment changes and how selection coefficients change as a result. In this study, we propose a model for evolutionary rescue under three different scenarios of environmental change: abrupt change, <b>periodic</b> <b>fluctuation</b> and gradual decay. The model makes use of the notion of reaction norms to describe fitness values that depend on both genotype and environmental state. We find that although drug sensitive bacterial populations may be large, allowing them to generate resistant mutants frequently, a harsh abrupt change due to the drug usually drives them extinct. Evolutionary rescue occurs far more frequently under the milder forms of environmental change we investigated. Rescue is favoured when the absolute fitnesses of individuals remain sufficiently high over the range of environment qualities experienced by the population. The minimum environment quality, which is inversely related to drug dose in the antibiotic context, is thus an important factor. Interestingly, in the <b>periodic</b> <b>fluctuation</b> model, the inter-dose period is less influential in promoting rescue through resistance unless the minimum environment quality is in a particular range. We also investigated fitness trade-offs across environments including the case of a resistant allele not subject to any trade-off (a "superbug"). This fitness trade-off affects the probability of rescue in decaying environments, but surprisingly has only a weak effect in the <b>periodic</b> <b>fluctuation</b> scenario. Finally, we use the model to show how niche construction, whereby organisms are the source of environmental change, produces more complex dynamics. 10 page(s...|$|E
