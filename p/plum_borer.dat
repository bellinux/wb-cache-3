50|$|Euzophera semifuneralis, the American <b>plum</b> <b>borer,</b> is a moth of {{the family}} Pyralidae. It is found {{throughout}} the United States, southern Canada and parts of Mexico.|$|E
40|$|Pheromone {{components}} of the American <b>plum</b> <b>borer,</b> Euzophera semifuneralis, were defined by use of the electroantennogram screening technique and capillary gas chromatographic retention times of sex pheromone gland constituents. Field studies showed that greatest attraction was achieved with a 1 mg load rate of a 4 -component blend in a rubber septum. This blend consisted of a 2 : 1 ratio of Z,E- 9, 12 - 14 :ALD and Z 9 - 14 :ALD and {{an equal amount of}} the corresponding alcohols in a 2 : 1 ratio, respectively. Commercial lures were used to compare the flight patterns of the American <b>plum</b> <b>borer,</b> peachtree borer (Synanthedon exitiosa), and lesser peachtree borer (Synanthedon pictipes) adults in Michigan in 1988...|$|E

From 1904 to 1907 he was {{employed}} as a field assistant for the United States Bureau of Entomology. During this time, {{he was involved in}} research on plum curculios (Conotrachelus nenuphar), Colorado potato beetles (Leptinotarsa decemlineata), and American <b>plum</b> <b>borers</b> (Euzophera semifuneralis). In 1908, he moved to Urbana, Illinois, where he worked as a laboratory assistant of the Illinois State Entomologist. From 1909 to 1911 (still in the employ of the Illinois State Entomologist), he worked as an assistant in entomology at the University of Illinois, studying bedbugs (Cimex spp.) and Colorado potato beetles.|$|R

40|$|NYS IPM Type: Fruits IPM Fact SheetThe American <b>plum</b> <b>borer</b> (APB) is a cambium-feeding moth pest {{of fruit}} and {{ornamental}} trees. It is unusual because {{it belongs to the}} pyralid, rather than the sesiid (clearwing) family, which is more commonly associated with this kind of damage. It is the major borer pest of stone fruits in Michigan, causing up to a 33 % decline in the life span of tart cherry trees there. Recent studies indicate that it is the most abundant borer in commercial tart cherry orchards in New York. Significant numbers are also found in peach trees infected by canker diseases. Widely distributed throughout most of North America and parts of South America, it has an extensive range of hosts including at least 15 families of fruit, nut, ornamental, and forest trees, and a few woody annuals. Its rise to major pest status in tart cherry can be traced to bark damaged by mechanical harvesters, which provides larvae an entryway to the cambium...|$|E
40|$|Seventy {{percent of}} dwarf and semidwarf trees have burrknots {{susceptible}} to borer infestation. Prebloom or petalfall applications of Lorsban will control both dogwood borer and American <b>plum</b> <b>borer</b> season-long. T he dogwood borer, Synanthedonscitula (Harris), was first recognizedas a pecan pest during the earl 1940 s, {{but was not}} an economic pest of apple until the introduction of clonal apple rootstocks. Such rootstocks tend to produce burrknots, which are attractive oviposition and entry sites for dogwood borer (Figure 2). Because size-controlling rootstocks have become so prevalent in modern apple culture, the con-sequential incidence of dogwood borer in-festations has also risen. Earlier work in New York (Riedl et. al. 1985) highlighted this borer as a prevalent and important pest of apple. Their examinations of apple orchards in western New York and the Hudson Val-ley revealed that 70 percent of trees on dwarfing or semi-dwarfing rootstocks had burrknots and that an average of 40 percent of the burrknots in any particular orchard were infested by dogwood borers. Dogwood borer is in the family Sesiidae, commonly known as clearwing moths. This family also contains peachtree borer, lesser peachtree borer {{and a number of}} borers that Figure 1. Dogwood borer (a.) adult (b.) larva Figure 2. Burrknots infest forest trees and shrubs. Dogwood borer larvae are creamy white with a yel-lowish-brown head capsule and the last in-star is about half an inch long (Figure 1).
