5|$|Although the {{fracturing}} <b>process</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> yet known, the altitudinal {{statistical analysis}} {{indicates that the}} caldera had formed just before the eruption. The area of the island was smaller, and the southern and eastern coastlines appeared regressed. During the eruption, the landscape was covered by the pumice sediments. In some places, the coastline vanished under thick tuff depositions. In others, recent coastlines were extended towards the sea. After the eruption, the geomorphology of the island was characterized by an intense erosional phase during which the pumice was progressively removed from the higher altitudes to the lower ones.|$|E

5|$|Telangiectasias and {{arteriovenous}} malformations in HHT {{are thought}} to arise because of changes in angiogenesis, the development of blood vessels out of existing ones. The {{development of a new}} blood vessel requires the activation and migration of various types of cells, chiefly endothelium, smooth muscle and pericytes. The exact mechanism by which the HHT mutations influence this <b>process</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> yet clear, and it is likely that they disrupt a balance between pro- and antiangiogenic signals in blood vessels. The wall of telangiectasias is unusually friable, which explains the tendency of these lesions to bleed.|$|E
5|$|The {{main problem}} {{encountered}} in deciphering {{the dynamics of}} the Jovian magnetosphere is the transport of heavy cold plasma from the Io torus at 6RJ to the outer magnetosphere at distances of more than 50RJ. The precise mechanism of this <b>process</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> known, but it is hypothesized to occur as a result of plasma diffusion due to interchange instability. The process is similar to the Rayleigh-Taylor instability in hydrodynamics. In the case of the Jovian magnetosphere, centrifugal force plays the role of gravity; the heavy liquid is the cold and dense Ionian (i.e. pertaining to Io) plasma, and the light liquid is the hot, much less dense plasma from the outer magnetosphere. The instability leads to an exchange between the outer and inner parts of the magnetosphere of flux tubes filled with plasma. The buoyant empty flux tubes move towards the planet, while pushing the heavy tubes, filled with the Ionian plasma, away from Jupiter. This interchange of flux tubes is a form of magnetospheric turbulence.|$|E
