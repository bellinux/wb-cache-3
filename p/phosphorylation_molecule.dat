Impairment of dynein–dynactin complex activity, either by overexpressing the p 50 -dynamitin component of dynactin to disrupt the complex or by knocking down dynein heavy chain expression to prevent its formation, inhibited MTOC translocation after TCR antigen priming. This resulted in a strong reduction in the <b>phosphorylation</b> of <b>molecules</b> such as ζ chain–associated protein kinase 70 (ZAP 70), linker of activated T cells (LAT), and Vav 1; prevented the supply of molecules to the IS from intracellular pools, resulting in a disorganized and dysfunctional IS architecture; and impaired interleukin- 2 production.

TSw and TSc differed in molecular weight, rhamnose content, and ratios of xylose, arabinose, galactose, and glucose. Both XGs improved keratinocytes and fibroblast proliferation, promoted the cell cycle, and stimulated migration and intracellular enzyme activity of NHDF after endosomal uptake. Only TSw significantly enhanced HaCaT migration and extracellular enzyme activity of NHDF and HaCaT.

40|$|The {{ability to}} respond to {{differential}} levels of oxygen is important to all respiring cells. The response to oxygen deficiency, or hypoxia, takes many forms and ranges from systemic adaptations to those that are cell autonomous. Perhaps the most ancient of the cell-autonomous adaptations to hypoxia is a metabolic one: the Pasteur effect, which includes decreased oxidative phosphorylation and an increase in anaerobic fermentation. Because anaerobic fermentation produces far less ATP than oxidative <b>phosphorylation</b> per <b>molecule</b> of glucose, increased activity of the glycolytic pathway is necessary to maintain free ATP levels in the hypoxic cell. Here, we present genetic and biochemical evidence that, in mammalian cells, this metabolic switch is regulated by the transcription factor HIF- 1. As a result, cells lacking HIF- 1 α exhibit decreased growth rates during hypoxia, as well as decreased levels of lactic acid production and decreased acidosis. We show that this decrease in glycolytic capacity results in dramatically lowered free ATP levels in HIF- 1 α-deficient hypoxic cells. Thus, HIF- 1 activation is an essential control element of the metabolic state during hypoxia; this requirement has important implications for the regulation of cell growth during development, angiogenesis, and vascular injury...|$|R
40|$|Signal {{transducer}} and activator of transcription (Stat) proteins are latent transcription {{factors that}} {{reside in the}} cytoplasm before activation. On cytokine-induced tyrosine <b>phosphorylation,</b> these <b>molecules</b> dimerize and accumulate transiently in the nucleus. No specific signals mediating these processes have been identified to date. In this report, we examine the nuclear export of Stat 1. We find that treatment of cells with the export inhibitor leptomycin B does not affect steady-state localization of Stat 1 but impedes nuclear export after IFNγ-induced nuclear accumulation. We identify a conserved leucine-rich helical segment in the coiled-coil domain of Stat 1, {{which is responsible for}} the efficient nuclear export of this protein. Mutation of two hallmark leucines within this segment greatly attenuate the back transport of Stat 1 in the cytoplasm. When fused to a carrier protein, the Stat 1 export sequence can mediate nuclear export after intranuclear microinjection. We show that prolonging the nuclear presence of Stat 1 by inhibiting nuclear export reduces the transcriptional response to stimulation with IFNγ. These data suggest that Stats are actively exported from the nucleus via several separate pathways and link this activity to transcriptional activation...|$|R

Syndecan- 2 is tyrosine phosphorylated and forms a complex with EphB 2 in mouse brain. Dominant-negative inhibition of endogenous EphB receptor activities blocks clustering of endogenous syndecan- 2 and normal spine formation in cultured hippocampal neurons.

The human promyelocytic leukemia cell line HL- 60 was induced to differentiate into PMNs by all-trans retinoid acid. Pretreatment with different MAPK and PI 3 K inhibitors was used to delineate signaling pathways in THP-enhanced PMN phagocytosis. <b>Phosphorylation</b> of <b>molecules</b> responsible for PMN phagocytosis induced by bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS), THP, or human recombinant epidermal growth factor (EGF) was evaluated by western blot. A p 38 MAPK inhibitor, SB 203580, effectively inhibited both spontaneous and LPS- and THP-induced PMN phagocytosis. Both THP and LPS enhanced {{the expression of the}} Rho family proteins Cdc 42 and Rac that may lead to F-actin re-arrangement. Further studies suggested that THP and EGF enhance PMN and differentiated HL- 60 cell phagocytosis in a similar pattern. Furthermore, the EGF receptor inhibitor GW 2974 significantly suppressed THP- and EGF-enhanced PMN phagocytosis and p 38 and ERK 1 / 2 phosphorylation in differentiated HL- 60 cells.

Our previous studies revealed that balanced deep-sea water (BDSW) has potential as a treatment for diabetes and obesity. In this study, we aimed to investigate the mechanism by which BDSW regulates diabetes and obesity by studying its effects on mitochondrial metabolism.

BDSW increased mitochondrial biogenesis in a time and dose-dependent manner. Quantitative real-time PCR revealed that BDSW enhances gene expression of PGC- 1 α, NRF 1, and TFAM for mitochondrial transcription; MFN 1 / 2 and DRP 1 for mitochondrial fusion; OPA 1 for mitochondrial fission; TOMM 40 and TIMM 44 for mitochondrial protein import; CPT- 1 α and MCAD for fatty acid oxidation; CYTC for oxidative phosphorylation.

We further characterized C/EBPγ, as its silencing yielded the maximal impairment (52. 2 ± 12. 5 %) of scratch wounding (SW). We found that C/EBPγ silencing inhibited both EGF- and serum-induced keratinocyte migration, whereas C/EBPγ overexpression enhanced cell migration to EGF and to serum via the EGFR. Further, C/EBPγ silencing impaired scratch-induced Y 1068 and Y 1173 EGFR phosphorylation, as well as Y 118 paxillin <b>phosphorylation,</b> key <b>molecules</b> regulating cell migration and epidermal WH.

This {{study was designed}} to investigate the effects of oxymatrine on nuclear factor–kappa B (NF-κB) and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) -dependent inflammatory responses in lipopolysaccharide (LPS) -activated microglia. In this paper, BV 2 microglia were pretreated with different concentrations of oxymatrine (1, 10 and 20 μg/mL) for 30 min as followed by stimulation with LPS (1 µg/mL) for different times (30 min, 1 h, 3 h, and 6 h). Concentrations of nitric oxide (NO), prostaglandin E 2 (PGE 2), tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α), interleukin- 1 beta (IL- 1 β) and interleukin- 6 (IL- 6) in supernatant, mRNA levels of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and cyclooxygenase- 2 (COX- 2), cytosolic inhibitor of kappa B-alpha (I-κBα) and phospho-I-κBα and nuclear p 65 protein levels, and the <b>phosphorylations</b> of MAPK <b>molecules</b> suc...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: The role of ribokinase-like {{carbohydrate}} kinases {{consists in}} ATP dependent <b>phosphorylation</b> of small <b>molecules</b> containing hydroxymethyl group. Although they differ substantially in structural terms and exhibit a broad substrate specificity, some family-wide conserved features {{can be distinguished}} suggesting the common mode of action. 4 -methyl- 5 -�-hydroxyethylthiazole kinase (Thz kinase) was chosen as a representative model and the mechanism proposed in X-ray crystal structure paper {{provided the basis for}} calculations. In particular, the possible role of several active site residues (Arg 121 and Cys 198 among others) and of the two magnesium ions was examined. Static and dynamic catalytic fields for the reaction were generated revealing the most favourable environment for the preferential transition state stabilization. An attempt to model the phosphoryl transfer reaction as well as to investigate the influence of the cysteine residue on the reaction course at the semiempirical PM 3 level of theory was undertaken...|$|R
