40|$|OBJECTIVE: The {{concept of}} disease {{activity}} in Graves' ophthalmopathy (GO) {{might explain why}} as many as one-third of patients {{do not respond to}} immunosuppressive treatment, because only patients in the active stage of disease are expected to respond. The hypothesis was adopted that a parameter used to measure disease activity should be able to predict a response to immunosuppressive treatment. The aim {{of this study was to}} develop a multivariate prediction model in which all previous tested activity parameters are integrated. DESIGN AND PATIENTS: We included 66 consecutive patients with untreated moderately severe GO who had been euthyroid for at least 2 months. All patients were treated with radiotherapy. Measurements Treatment efficacy after 6 months follow-up was used as the primary outcome measure. Disease severity and 15 different disease activity parameters were assessed before treatment. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression models were used to predict response (model 1) or no change (model 2). RESULTS: In multivariate analyses, we found that duration of GO, soft tissue involvement, elevation, soluble interleukin- 2 receptor (sIL- 2 R), soluble CD 30 (sCD 30), eye muscle reflectivity and octreotide uptake ratio were significant predictors of a response to radiotherapy. Gender, duration of GO, soft tissue involvement, eye muscle reflectivity, IL- 6 and urinary glycosaminoglycan (GAG) excretion were significant predictors of no change upon radiotherapy. <b>Prognostic</b> score <b>charts</b> were developed for use in clinical practice to calculate the probability of response (model 1) and the probability of no change (model 2) for each new patient. Finally we used a combination of both models to define a recommended treatment modality for each individual patient, based on both the predicted probabilities of response and no change. We were able to identify the correct treatment (based on a comparison with the observed response) in 89 % of the patients. CONCLUSIONS: Although we strongly recommend that our results should be confirmed in other studies, our findings are the first evidence for the idea that disease (in) activity should determine which kind of treatment should be use...|$|R
40|$|Mostly, {{patients}} with peri-pancreatic cancer (including pancreatic, ampullary and distal bile duct tumors) are diagnosed in {{a stage in}} which curative resection is not possible. The median survival rate of {{patients with}} non resectable peri-pancreatic cancer varies between 6 and 12 months. During this period palliative treatment is necessary, which should focus on major symptoms as obstructive jaundice, duodenal obstruction and pain. Controversy exists about how to provide optimal palliative treatment. Both surgical and non surgical palliative procedures relief obstructive jaundice. From early retrospective and prospective randomized studies {{it is known that}} in the early phase after treatment, more complications are found after surgical palliation, whereas in the late phase more complications are seen after endoscopic palliation. Because more recent studies clearly showed improved results after surgical palliation, current recommendations probably should be that patients with a suspected poor short-term survival (< 6 months) should be offered non surgical palliative therapy and those with a longer life expectancy may best be treated with bypass surgery. Unfortunately, valid criteria for estimating the remaining survival time are not available, except for the presence of metastases. The use of a <b>prognostic</b> score <b>chart</b> might assist in estimating the prognosis. Literature does not give sufficient information to make a well deliberated (evidence based) selection between the different types of surgical bypasses, but a choledochojejunostomy is generally preferred. After stenting, a correlation is found between survival and the development of duodenal obstruction, and between 9 % and 21 % of the patients who underwent a surgical biliary bypass without a prophylactic gastric bypass, will develop gastric outlet obstruction. Therefore, in patients with a relatively good prognosis it is recommended to perform routinely a double - biliary and gastric - bypass. Pain is a frequent symptom and is related with poor survival.

40|$|INTRODUCTION: Platelet indices, {{including}} {{mean platelet volume}} (MPV), {{are readily}} available blood tests, although their prognostic value in patients with septic shock has not been fully explored. Current evidence has found contradictory results. This study aims to explore the behavior of platelet indices in septic shock and their clinical <b>prognostic</b> value. METHODS: <b>Charts</b> of septic shock patients from January to December 2012 in a tertiary medical center in Northern China were reviewed retrospectively. Platelet indices were recorded during the first five consecutive days after admission, {{as well as the}} penultimate and the last day of hospital stay. The data were compared between surviving and non-surviving patients. RESULTS: A total of 124 septic shock patients were enrolled. Thirty-six of the patients survived and 88 of them expired. MPV in the non-survivor group was higher than that of the survivor group, especially on the last day. PDW and PLCR showed increased trends, while PCT and PLT decreased in the non-survivor group. Among the PLT indices, MPV had the highest area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (0. 81) with a precision rate of 75. 6 % at a cut-off of 10. 5.

40|$|Graduation date: 1974 In {{this study}} methods were {{developed}} for the prediction of wave conditions that are hazardous to navigation at river entrances, with emphasis on applicability to the Columbia River. There are two basic components to the prediction system: (1) a semi-automated spectral method for forecasting the significant height and average period of waves in deep water, and (2) an index of navigation hazard at river entrances {{that depends on the}} significant height and average period in deep water and on the mean current and water depth at the entrance. The computerized, deep water forecast method is a hybrid scheme that combines the spectral principles of the Pierson-Neumann-James method with the graphical input techniques of Wilson and the fetch limited spectrum of Liu. The significant heights generated by the method are well verified by winter wave measurements at Newport, Oregon. The hazard index is based on the probability of wave-breaking in water of arbitrary depth and current. The breaking probability is derived under the assumption that wave heights and squared periods are statistically independent and distributed according to a Rayleigh probability density function. The breaking-wave probability and the hazard index depend on the wave steepness in deep slack water and on the depth (relative to the wave period squared) and current (relative to the period) at the river entrance. The dependence on depth and current is achieved in two ways: (1) the limiting steepness (breaking index) k found as a function of relative depth and relative current, and (2) the wave spectrum in water of arbitrary depth and current is found by transformation of the spectrum in deep slack water. The transformation is performed by requiring that the rate of wave energy propagation remain constant. The hazard index is closely related to the probability of breaking swell. At water depths that are typical of river entrances, the hazard index depends strongly on the significant wave height, mean current and depth, but only weakly on the mean wave period (since the breaking height of swell at such depths is only weakly dependent on period). Hindcasts of deep water significant wave heights and hazard indices compared reasonably well with measured heights and Columbia River bar closure periods.
