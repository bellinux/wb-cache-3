5|$|Bishop's work {{evolved to}} include studies of drug {{resistance}} {{in both the}} parasites and the host organisms, the studies that would earn her {{a place in the}} Royal Society. Significant work from this period of Bishop's life included a study showing that the parasite itself did not develop resistance to quinine, but that host organisms could develop resistance to the drug proguanil. Her in vitro research was proven accurate when the drugs she studied were used to treat patients suffering from tertian malaria, a form of the illness in which the <b>paroxysm</b> of fever occurs every third day. She also investigated the drugs pamaquine and atebrin, along with proguanil, though proguanil was the only one shown to cause the development of drug resistance. Other studies showed that malaria parasites could develop cross-resistance to other antimalarial drugs. Bishop worked at Molteno until 1967. Her research and experimental protocols were later used in rodent and human studies, albeit with modifications.|$|E

40|$|The {{persistent}} {{normal activity}} of Stromboli is occasionally interrupted by sudden and highly energetic explosive events called Strombolian <b>paroxysms.</b> These phenomena together with landslide-generated tsunamis represent the most hazardous manifestations of present-day volcanic activity at Stromboli. The most recent <b>paroxysms,</b> on 5 April 2003 and 15 March 2007, have drawn {{attention to these}} energetic events because they significantly threatened inhabitants and tourists. Historical accounts and field evidence indicate, however, that even larger <b>paroxysms,</b> in terms of volume, dispersal of products and intensity of explosive phenomena, occurred in the recent past. During these <b>paroxysms</b> incipiently welded spatter deposits mantled {{the north and south}} rims of the Sciara del Fuoco down to low elevations, extending much farther than the similar deposits from recent observed events (5 April 2003 and 15 March 2007). In order to identify, characterize and discriminate among products of these outstanding spatter-forming eruptions, more than 50 stratigraphic sections were measured and sampled. Stratigraphic, sedimentological and radiometric (14 C) data indicate that only two <b>paroxysms</b> produced spatter that reached very low elevations and inhabited areas: the first occurred in the 16 th century and the last in AD 1930.

25|$|If two {{individuals}} desire the same thing, there {{will soon be}} a third, then a fourth. This process quickly snowballs. Since from the beginning desire is aroused by the other (and not by the object) the object is soon forgotten and the mimetic conflict transforms into a general antagonism. At {{this stage of the}} crisis the antagonists will no longer imitate each other's desires for an object, but each other's antagonism. They wanted to share the same object, but now they want to destroy the same enemy. So, a <b>paroxysm</b> of violence would tend to focus on an arbitrary victim and a unanimous antipathy would, mimetically, grow against him. The brutal elimination of the victim would reduce the appetite for violence that possessed everyone a moment before, and leaves the group suddenly appeased and calm. The victim lies before the group, appearing simultaneously as the origin of the crisis and as the one responsible for this miracle of renewed peace. He becomes sacred, that is to say the bearer of the prodigious power of defusing the crisis and bringing peace back. Girard believes this to be the genesis of archaic religion, of ritual sacrifice as the repetition of the original event, of myth as an account of this event, of the taboos that forbid access to all the objects at the origin of the rivalries that degenerated into this absolutely traumatizing crisis. This religious elaboration takes place gradually {{over the course of the}} repetition of the mimetic crises whose resolution brings only a temporary peace. The elaboration of the rites and of the taboos constitutes a kind of empirical knowledge about violence.|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: Recent reports {{suggest the}} {{presence}} of conduction delay in the posterior septal region during sinus rhythm in patients with lone paroxysmal atrial fibrillation (AF). OBJECTIVE: To explore the location of intra-atrial conduction delay associated with initiation of AF. DESIGN: In 8 lone AF patients (51 +/- 10 years), 20 AF <b>paroxysms</b> were induced during electrophysiological examination. Bipolar electrograms were acquired from a 10 -polar catheter in the coronary sinus (CS), a 4 -polar His bundle catheter, and a 20 -polar Halo catheter in the right atrium. RESULTS: Induced AF <b>paroxysms</b> showed earliest registered atrial activity in interatrial septum (IAS) or proximal CS in 17 cases (85 %). Conduction delay at the posterior IAS or proximal CS accompanied induction of 18 AF <b>paroxysms</b> (6 patients). Atrial activation sequence {{at the beginning of}} the AF <b>paroxysms</b> was stable and reproducible in six repeatedly induced AF episodes (3 patients). CONCLUSION: In lone AF patients, induction of AF is associated with conduction disturbances in the IAS and proximal CS regions...|$|R

40|$|Two {{types of}} {{childhood}} epilepsy {{have recently been}} reported: childhood epilepsy with occipital <b>paroxysms,</b> and benign nocturnal childhood occipital epilepsy. This article reports the clinical evolution, electroencephalographic (EEG) changes, and response to therapy of eight children with childhood epilepsy with occipital <b>paroxysms</b> (five boys and three girls, aged from 11 / 12 to 8 years) and eight children with benign nocturnal childhood occipital epilepsy (six boys and two girls, aged from 14 / 12 to 83 / 12 years). A careful clinical and EEG follow-up of at least 7 years was carried out for all patients. At the end of follow-up, {{all but one of}} the patients with childhood epilepsy with occipital <b>paroxysms</b> were seizure-free, and only two were still receiving anticonvulsant drugs.

40|$|AbstractA {{longitudinal}} prospective {{approach was}} used to investigate clinical correlations of interictal occipital <b>paroxysms</b> with or without fixation-off sensitivity (FOS). Occipital <b>paroxysms</b> were recorded in the electroencephalograms (EEGs) of 76 children with heterogeneous clinical conditions including seizures in 39 patients. Occipital <b>paroxysms</b> with FOS (42 patients) were only fractionally more frequent than non-FOS (34 patients) and were not specific of any clinical condition. Although present and FOS-related in all 11 children with benign childhood epilepsies with occipital <b>paroxysms</b> (CEOP), they were also frequently encountered in symptomatic occipital epilepsy. The differentiation of CEOP from other syndromes established on clinical grounds could also be aided by the analysis of background EEG activity that was frequently significantly more abnormal in symptomatic than CEOP. Clinical characteristics and ictal seizure semiology as well as follow-up clearly distinguish two type of idiopathic CEOP syndromes: (1) early onset type or Panayiotopoulos syndrome characterized by excellent prognosis and rare, prolonged nocturnal seizures with tonic deviations of the eyes and vomiting, and (2) late onset or Gastaut type showing a common ictal visual symptomatology, co-occurrence of migraine, diurnal complex partial seizures and less favourable EEG-clinical prognosis...|$|R
