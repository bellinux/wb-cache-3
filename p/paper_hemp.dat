25|$|Currently {{there is}} a small niche market for hemp pulp, for example as {{cigarette}} <b>paper.</b> <b>Hemp</b> fiber is mixed with fiber from other sources than hemp. In 1994 there was no significant production of 100% true hemp paper. World hemp pulp production was believed to be around 120,000 tons per year in 1991 which was about 0.05% of the world's annual pulp production volume. The total world production of hemp fiber had in 2003 declined to about 60,000 from 80,000 tons. This can be compared to a typical pulp mill for wood fiber, which is never smaller than 250,000 tons per annum. The cost of hemp pulp is approximately six times that of wood pulp, mostly because of the small size and outdated equipment of the few hemp processing plants in the Western world, and because hemp is harvested once a year (during August) and needs to be stored to feed the mill the whole year through. This storage requires a lot of (mostly manual) handling of the bulky stalk bundles. Another issue is that the entire hemp plant cannot be economically prepared for paper production. While the wood products industry uses nearly 100% of the fiber from harvested trees, only about 25% of the dried hemp stem—the bark, called bast—contains the long, strong fibers desirable for paper production. All this accounts for a high raw material cost. Hemp pulp is bleached with hydrogen peroxide, a process today also commonly used for wood pulp.|$|E

This study explored the surface interaction of cellulose nanocrystals (CNCs) and the effect of CNC sources on adhesion between individual CNCs and the Si tip of an AFM cantilever using a force mapping technique called FMap. The adhesion between CNCs and a Si tip from five different sources has been studied: cotton, Whatman filter <b>paper,</b> <b>hemp,</b> softwood chemical kraft pulp, and softwood-dissolving pulp (alistaple).

40|$|Hemp fibres {{belong to}} the group of natural, {{cellulose}} bast fibres. These fibres have exceptional properties such as: antimicrobial effect, absence of allergy effect, extraordinary sorption properties, good electro-physical properties (small static electricity in regard to other cellulose fibres) as well as high values of breaking strength (the natural fibre with the highest strength). However, hemp fibres have some defects: heterogeneous chemical composition, large quantity of accompanying substances (lignin pectins, waxes) and unsatisfactory fineness and eveness. It is possible to a great extent to eliminate or reduce, the defects of hemp fibres by of appropriate modification treatments. In order to determine the appropriate modification treatment of hemp fibres, the dependences between the chemical composition, fineness and electric resistance of hemp fibres were presented in this paper. In the experimental part of the paper, by the application of a procedure for the determination of the chemical composition, the accompanying supstances of hemp fibres were gradually removed. After each phase some fibrous substrates were separated. After that the fineness and electric resistance were determined. This experiment was conducted in order to define the influence of each component of hemp fibres on the fineness and electric resistance.

This lignin must be removed chemically and wood requires more use of chemicals in the process. The actual production of hemp fiber in the U.S continued to decline until 1933 to around 500 tons/year.

40|$|The {{demand for}} {{eco-friendly}} apparel and technical textiles {{has led to}} a resurgence of interests in bast fibres such as hemp. The lack of fast and objective evaluation of the quality attributes of bast fibres has been a major barrier to the advancement of the bast fibre industry. One of the most important quality attributes of a fibre is its fineness. For bast fibres, the fibre fineness measurement can also reflect the degree of fibre separation during retting or degumming. The traditional method of evaluating the fineness and residual gum content of bast fibres is a very tedious process. In this <b>paper,</b> degummed <b>hemp</b> fibres have been measured for fineness on an Optical Fibre Diameter Analyser (OFDA), and the results have been co-related with the residual gum content in the fibre samples.
