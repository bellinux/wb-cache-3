40|$|Psychologists {{commonly}} {{believe that}} categorization, i. e. grouping many subjects {{into a few}} broad categories, is elemental to thinking. This study shows that the categorization of assets into coarse groups (e. g. industries, styles) is associated with some <b>portfolio</b> <b>investors</b> exhibiting categorical thinking– thinking where investors emphasize category-wide information and ignore asset-specific information during investment decisions in assets. To discern whether such categorical thinking in portfolio decisions reflects an information-processing bias that has potentially negative economic effects, I propose the following three hypotheses. First, psychological evidence predicts that if categorical thinking is an information-processing bias, it should increase with information uncertainty and complexity. Second, if a <b>portfolio</b> <b>investor’s</b> categorical thinking is an information-processing bias, it should lead to forecasting errors about asset values and, thus, should be negatively related to portfolio performance. Third, if categorical thinking leads to biased forecasting, <b>portfolio</b> <b>investors</b> should display less (more) skill in valuing assets with more (less) coarse categorizations, i. e. for which the category-wide information is less (more) informative. Based on actively managed equity mutual funds, the empirical results strongly support these hypotheses. The findings link an information-processing bias arising from categorization {{to the quality of}} decision-making in financial markets where asset categorization is pervasive.

40|$|Finance theory {{suggests}} that markets where foreign bond <b>portfolio</b> <b>investors</b> overweight their <b>portfolio</b> relative to the prescribed theoretical benchmark should experience higher international risk sharing. Correspondingly, the cost of debt in such markets should be lower compared to markets facing a lower degree of international risk sharing. We empirically examine this prediction using a panel data set of sovereign bond yield spreads and a measure of suboptimal foreign bond portfolio allocations for 50 emerging and ten developed markets. Consistent with theory, our results show higher levels of foreign bond allocations – relative to the theoretical benchmark – are negatively related {{to the cost of}} debt.

Many changes have occurred at national and international level in order to sustain the adaptation and mitigation measures. The attitude and the activity of international financial institutions, public authorities, private companies, <b>portfolio</b> <b>investors</b> and exchanges has modified and have adapted to this new challenge. On financial field, the innovation is intense, and in some directions, this phenomenon is determined by climate change. For example, a new commodity – the carbon – is traded on exchanges through spot, futures or options contracts. In addition, the behavior of investors and corporations is determined in some extend, by the climate change: the transnational corporations run social responsible programs with an environmental component and many <b>portfolio</b> <b>investors</b> are focused on environmental, social and governance (ESG) issues {{in order to make}} social responsible investment...|$|R

I find that <b>portfolio</b> <b>investors</b> are in fact sensitive to past gov-ernment behavior and fiscal policy outcomes; <b>portfolio</b> <b>investors</b> reallocate funds as new information about government policy becomes available.

40|$|Using a novel, hand-collected dataset of Sovereign Wealth Fund (SWF) {{investments}} in public equities, private firms, and real estate, we establish what SWF portfolios look like. SWF allocations are balanced across risky asset classes, very home-region biased, and very biased toward certain industries, in particular, toward finance (owning 4. 8 % of world equity) and transportation, energy and telecommunication. SWFs invest actively (with control rights) in {{both public and}} private sectors, but mainly in these industries in their home regions. We use these allocations to understand better the objectives that drive SWF investment decisions. We find evidence for financial <b>portfolio</b> <b>investor</b> benchmarking and for hedging of income covariance risk. We introduce and test an industrial planning hypothesis as an alternative objective and find this has considerable explanatory power. We find that both measures to capture financial portfolio and industrial planning objectives together explain 14. 4 % of SWF portfolio variation. Of this, industrial planning accounts for 45 %. There is significant variation in the power of industrial planning objectives across SWFs revealing important heterogeneity in this investo...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{examines}} objectives driving Sovereign Wealth Fund (SWF) investments using a novel, handcollected dataset {{of their}} investments in public equities, private firms, and real estate. SWF public statements suggest two primary objectives: a financial <b>portfolio</b> <b>investor</b> objective, seeking to maximize risk adjusted returns through assembling diversified holdings; and a developmental objective, seeking to use SWF investments {{to influence the}} domestic development path. We test for the explanatory power of these objectives using a model of portfolio choice and ownership stakes. Long-horizon benchmarks and risk hedging variables do have explanatory power in the panel and time series of allocations across asset class, industry and geography. However, we find that sovereign ownership of SWFs matter. Nearly half of the portfolio choice explanatory power comes from variables that capture development agendas. An ownership stake model predicts that SWF investments should include sufficient stakes for the transfer of knowledge. We find results that the distribution of active-sized stakes correlate with developmental agendas, particularly in specific industries. The results of significant heterogeneity across SWFs in their objectives, {{and the power of}} development objectives provides new predictions for the potential impact of SWF investments...|$|E

40|$|The {{objectives}} {{of this paper}} are: (1) to analyze an optimal portfolio rebalancing by a fund manager {{in response to a}} "volatility shock" in one of the asset markets, under sufficiently realistic assumptions about the fund manager''s performance criteria and investment restrictions; and (2) to analyze the sensitivity of the equilibrium price of an asset to shocks originating in other fundamentally unrelated asset markets for a given mix of common investors. The analysis confirms that certain combinations of investment restrictions (notably short-sale constraints and benchmark-based performance criteria) can create additional transmission mechanisms for propagating shocks across fundamentally unrelated asset markets. The paper also discusses potential implications of recent and on-going changes in the investor base for emerging market securities for the asset price volatility.

40|$|Various {{claims have}} been made {{about the causes of}} the Asian crisis and its spread. Here, we use data on the {{behavior}} of capital flows during the crisis to test the strong forms of four such hypotheses, including the dominant role of <b>portfolio</b> <b>investors</b> and hedge funds in initiating and spreading the crisis; moral hazard; and, finally, the role of Japanese banks in spreading the trouble to countries in which they were the largest source of funds. All are falsified as monocausal explanations.

Likewise, contrary to common expectations banks were a much larger source of capital outflows during the crisis than were <b>portfolio</b> <b>investors.</b> While falsified in their strongest forms, several of these hypotheses in less strong form should play a role in a more nuanced analysis.

40|$|Taxation theory rarely takes {{entrepreneurship}} into consideration. We {{discuss how}} this omission affects conclusions derived from standard models of capital taxation {{when applied to}} entrepreneurial income. Some of the defining features of entrepreneurship often omitted by standard capital taxation theory are incorporated into the analysis. This includes {{the lack of a}} well-functioning external market for entrepreneurial effort, limited access to external capital and the complementarities between entrepreneurial effort, entrepre-neurial innovation and capital investment. Because of these constraints, the entrepreneurial project is tied to the individual owner-manager. Unlike the typical passive <b>portfolio</b> <b>investor</b> assumed in cost of capital models the entrepreneur is unable to decouple savings decisions from investment decisions, and due to the comple-mentarities in production makes a joint decision on the supply of effort and capital. The returns from success-ful entrepreneurial ventures thus cannot be readily divided into labor and capital income, in stark contrast to what is assumed in standard taxation theory. When unique attributes of entrepreneurship are taken into account, some major conclusions of capital taxation models no longer hold, including the neutrality of capital taxation in owner-managed firms. These results are particularly important for the Nordic system of dual taxation, the theoretical foundation of which relies on the ability to neatly separate capital income from the labor income of the self-employed.

40|$|Pension {{funds have}} lately {{emerged as an}} {{essential}} field of study in various disciplines within social sciences. Political economists, economic geographers and some social policy researchers have studied the role of pension funds very broadly for instance in context of labour market relations, economic development and financial systems. Yet comparative studies in social and public policy have for long studied pension funding mostly in respect to its role in pension systems and reforms, and {{to the effects of}} investment returns to the development of retirement income benefits. Whereas the comparative studies have mostly focused on the savings and ‘liability side’ (e. g. pension benefits) of pension funds, in this paper, we conduct a comparative analysis on the politics of ‘the asset side’. It is argued that the economic and social consequences of the usage of pension capital need to be understood as intrinsic parts of pension regimes that cannot be left outside classification of these regimes in social sciences. Our comparative analysis studies the historical regulative institutional development paths of pension fund investment governance in Finnish (TEL/TyEL) and Swedish (ATP/AP, PPM) first pillar, second tier pension systems. The time period of the analysis is from the establishment of these systems in late 1950 s and early 1960 s to the recent reforms of last few years. Both systems have developed so that the role of financier of national economy has decreased and the role of more global <b>portfolio</b> <b>investor</b> increased over time. We argue, however, that there have been very significant differences between the institutional development paths leading to the new investor roles. The Swedish model has included more paradigmatic qualitative changes in the whole pension regime whereas the changes in Finnish pension fund governance have been rather parametric and quantitative. The financial crisis of 2007 – 08 has also illustrated some essential differences between the current systems...|$|E
40|$|Anecdotal {{evidence}} suggests that investor protection affects the demand for equity, but existing theories emphasize only the effect of investor protection on the supply of equity. We build a model showing that the demand for equity is important in explaining financial development. If the level of investor protection is low, wealthy investors {{have an incentive to}} become controlling shareholders and pay a high price for their stocks, because they can earn additional benefits by expropriating outside shareholders. As a consequence of lower expected returns both domestic and foreign <b>portfolio</b> <b>investors</b> have a disincentive to hold stocks. The model implies that differences in stock market participation rates across countries and the pervasiveness of home equity bias depend on the degree of investor protection. Additionally, we uncover a good country bias in investment decisions as <b>portfolio</b> <b>investors</b> from countries with low level of investor protection hold relatively more foreign equity. We provide novel international evidence on stock market participation rates, and on holdings of domestic and foreign stocks consistent with the predictions of the model.
