He once told a friend to [...] "watch out for the next issue of Philosophical Magazine; it is highly radioactive!" [...] Aside from his work on understanding radioactivity, Rutherford proposed the experiments of Hans Geiger and Ernest Marsden that verified his nuclear model of the atom and led to Niels Bohr's famous paper on <b>planetary</b> <b>electrons,</b> which was published in the journal in 1913. Another classic contribution from Rutherford was entitled [...] "Collision of α Particles with Light Atoms. IV. An Anomalous Effect in Nitrogen" [...] - an article describing no less than the first artificial transmutation of an element.|$|E

X-rays at different stages during early development. A cor relation {{of the changes in}} radiosensitivity with the changes in develop ment showed that they become more sensitive during cleavage and blastulation, much more resistant at or near the beginning of gastrula tion, and more sensitive again as gastrulation gets under way. Having found that susceptibility to one type of radiation varies in a certain way, it is of interest to determine whether it varies in the same way when other types of radiation are used. Alpha particles, beta particles, and gamma rays are the three recog nized forms of radiation emitted by radioactive substances. The alpha and beta rays are corpuscular in nature while the gamma radiation is like X-rays of very short wave length. All of these forms of radiation, including X-rays, are capable of causing ionization in matter subjected to their influence. According to the Rutherford-Bohr theory {{of the structure of the}} atom, the alpha particle is identical with the helium atom stripped of its two <b>planetary</b> <b>electrons.</b> It therefore has an electric charge of two positive and a mass about 7000 times that of the beta particle or electron (Failla, 1927). Since it has atomic dimensions and has a velocity of. 15 to. 20 times that of light, it represents an enormous concentration of kinetic energy. â€œ¿Infact the alpha particle is the most potent agent known to scienceâ€ • (Lind, 1928). In addition to the 200 kv. X-rays used previously, we have had at our disposal 40 kv. X-rays, gamma rays, and alpha particles. Tests de termining susceptibility changes have been made with each of these. The responses to 40 kv. X-rays and gamma rays were essentially the same as to 200 kv. X-rays. With alpha particles, however, the effects were very different. Experiments with alpha particles will therefore be presented in detail, after which results for all will be compared...|$|E

While mechanisms yielding surface magnetic field concentrations antipodal to impact basins are not yet clear, the present results' indicated period of strong lunar magnetic fields, at between about 3. 85 and 3. 6 aeons, is consistent with lunar paleomagnetic sample data.

40|$|The paper {{describes}} {{the technique of}} <b>planetary</b> <b>electron</b> reflection magnetometry (PERM), a method for measuring the magnitude, direction, and scale size of magnetic fields near {{the surface of the}} moon and other planetary bodies with weak and small-scale-size surface fields. It is noted that the PERM technique is based on the ability of magnetic fields to reflect charged particles. A qualitative account of the implementation of the technique is presented along with some results obtained by the Apollo 15 and 16 Particles and Fields subsatellites. The quantitative aspects of PERM are treated by examining solutions to the equation of motion of a charged particle in a magnetic field, computing reflection coefficients on the basis of trajectory calculations, and determining the direction of the lunar surface magnetic field. The sensitivity of the PERM technique is calculated, and effects of lunar electric fields and spacecraft potentials on the measurements are described. Extension of the technique to Mars and Venus is discussed...|$|R

Serious discrepancies exist among excitation cross sections reported in the literature. To clarify the situation, these cross sections were measured at two impact energies using electron energy loss spectroscopy.

40|$|Fluorescent {{excitation}} of {{spectral lines}} is demonstrated {{as a function}} of temperatureluminosity and the distance of the emitting region from the central stars of <b>planetary</b> nebulae. The <b>electron</b> densities and temperatures are determined, and the method is exemplified through a detailed analysis of spectral observations of a high excitation PN, NGC 6741, observed by Hyung and Aller (1997). Fluorescence should also be important in the determination of element abundances. It is suggested that the method could be generally applied to determine or constrain the luminosity and the region of spectral emission in other intensively radiative sources such as novae, supernovae, and active galactic nuclei.

40|$|Polyamide fibre {{containing}} amber particles was fabricated. The amber particles {{were obtained}} by grinding technology using <b>planetary</b> ball-mills. Scanning <b>electron</b> microscopy and granulometry testing were used to characterise the structure {{and the size of}} prepared amber particles. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy was used to analyse the chemical structure of the amber particles. The amber particles were characterised with average size up to 3 μm. The chemical composition of amber before and after the grinding remained unchanged. The amber particles were melt-extruded using polyamide 6 as the matrix. Melt spinning processing was used to fabricate polyamide-amber filaments. Pre-oriented yarns and fully drawn yarns were obtained after hotdrawing experiments.

40|$|A {{recently}} generated {{theoretical line}} list of C II dielectronic recombination lines together with observational data {{gathered from the}} literature is used to investigate the electron temperature {{in a range of}} astronomical objects, mainly <b>planetary</b> nebulae. The <b>electron</b> temperature is obtained by a least-squares optimisation using all the reliable observed lines in each object. In addition, the subset of lines arising directly from autoionising states is used to directly determine the free-electron energy distribution which is then compared with various theoretical possibilities. The method described here can potentially determine whether there are departures from Maxwell-Boltzmann distributions in some nebulae, as has been recently proposed. Using published observations of the three planetary nebulae where the relevant lines are recorded, we find that the data are best matched by Maxwell-Boltzmann distributions but that the uncertainties are sufficiently large at present that kappa-distributions or two-component nebular models are not excluded.

40|$|This {{experimental}} study addresses the failure modes of plasma sprayed coatings in rolling contact. A high velocity plasma spraying system {{was used to}} deposit WC– 15 %Co coatings {{on the surface of}} 15 mm diameter 440 -C bearing steel cones. These coatings were Ž. deposited in two different thickness. Rolling contact fatigue RCF tests were conducted using a modified four ball machine in conventional steel ball bearing and hybrid ceramic bearing configurations. These tests were conducted under various tribological conditions of contact stress and lubrication regimes at room temperature. Failure modes were investigated on the basis of surface and subsurface observations of failed coated rolling elements. Surface observations were made using conventional scanning electron Ž. microscopy SEM and light microscopy. Subsurface observations were made using fluorescent dye penetrant technique. Observations of Ž. debris generated during the RCF tests, changes in topography of lower <b>planetary</b> balls, <b>electron</b> probe microscope analysis EPMA, microhardnessrfracture toughness investigations and, coating microstructural studies are also included to aid the discussion. Two modes of failures, i. e., surface wear and coating delamination, were observed during this investigation. Coated rolling elements failed in either one or a combination of these two modes depending upon the tribological conditions during the RCF test. Surface wear was associated with asperity contact in the presence of microsliprsliding within the contact region. The process was accelerated in the later stages of RCF tests in the presence of wear debris due to additional mechanism of three body abrasion. Coating delamination was associated with the initiationrpropagation of subsurface cracks, which resulted due to defects in the coating microstructure. These cracks propagated a...|$|R
40|$|The MErcury Surface, Space ENvironment, GEochemistry, and Ranging (MESSENGER) {{mission to}} Mercury has {{provided}} a wealth of new data about energetic particle phenomena. With observations from MESSENGER’s Energetic Particle Spectrometer, as well as data arising from energetic electrons recorded by the X‐Ray Spectrometer and Gamma‐Ray and Neutron Spectrometer (GRNS) instruments, recent work greatly extends our record of the acceleration, transport, and loss of energetic electrons at Mercury. The combined data sets include measurements from a few keV up to several hundred keV in electron kinetic energy and have permitted relatively good spatial and temporal resolution for many events. We focus here on the detailed nature of energetic electron bursts measured by the GRNS system, and we place these events {{in the context of}} solar wind and magnetospheric forcing at Mercury. Our examination of data at high temporal resolution (10 [*]ms) during the period March 2013 through October 2014 supports strongly the view that energetic electrons are accelerated in the near‐tail region of Mercury’s magnetosphere and are subsequently “injected” onto closed magnetic field lines on the <b>planetary</b> nightside. The <b>electrons</b> populate the plasma sheet and drift rapidly eastward toward the dawn and prenoon sectors, at times executing multiple complete drifts around the planet to form “quasi‐trapped” populations.

40|$|Airless {{bodies in}} space {{are exposed to}} a variety of {{charging}} environments in which a balance of currents due to plasma processes determines the surface charge. In the inner solar system, photoelectron emission is the dominant charging process on sunlit surfaces due to the intense solar UV radiation. This results in a positive surface potential with a photoelectron sheath above the surface. Conversely, the unlit side of the body will charge negatively due the collection of the fast-moving solar wind electrons. The interaction of charged dust grains with these positively and negatively charged surfaces, and with the photoelectron and plasma sheaths, may explain the occurrence of dust lofting, levitation and transport above the lunar surface and on other airless bodies. This dust has been recognized as a potentially great hazard to future exploration of dusty planetary surfaces, due to its abrasive and adhesive nature. An initial investigation explores the mechanisms that control adhesion of dust grains to insulating and conducting surfaces. Unfortunately, there is little known about the mechanisms of adhesion on widely varying surface types, but van der Waals and electrostatic forces are the dominant forces that are taken into consideration in this study, which measures the adhesive forces between ≤ 25 μm JSC- 1 lunar simulant grains and various surfaces vacuum using a centrifugal force detachment method. UV irradiation effects on surface adhesion were also examined. In order to better understand the plasma processes at work on sunlit surfaces, we have performed laboratory experiments to study the physics of photoelectron sheaths above both conducting and insulating surfaces in vacuum. The first set of experiments determines the characteristics of photoelectron sheaths generated over a conducting Zr surface that is large in comparison to the Debye length of the sheath. These characteristics are derived from cylindrical Langmuir probe measurements, and are compared with the results from a 1 D PIC-code simulation to gain a greater understanding of the sheath physics. To study the photoelectron sheath above an insulating material, a portion of this conducting surface is covered with insulating material. CeO 2 is used both in powdered and solid disk form, and un-sieved JSC- 1 is used to represent <b>planetary</b> surfaces. <b>Electron</b> densities and temperatures of the photoelectron plasma are measured with a single-sided planar Langmuir probe. The measurements taken above the CeO 2 are compared with those taken above the Zr to observe the differences in photoemission, and to determine how the insulating surface modifies the structure of the photoelectron sheath. The densities above the surfaces are only found to have a modest dependence on the surrounding surface bias, and the plasma potentials measured above the insulating surfaces are significantly different than those above the Zr, {{due to the fact that}} the insulating materials float to an equilibrium potential independent of the surrounding surface bias. These measurements indicate that plasma probes above a planetary body can accurately determine potentials and densities above the surfaces, valuable information for understanding the charging environment of spacecraft and other objects...|$|R
