5|$|Morsell {{found it}} {{challenging}} to film a scene {{near the end}} of the game, in which Adrienne is pleading with Don while getting strapped into the chair with a guillotine overhead. Several different versions of the scene had to be filmed, and Morsell said it was difficult for her to work up the genuine emotion she needed take after take. The torture devices featured in the game were scale models made by local craftsmen. During one scene, the mansion roof starts to collapse, causing beams and chunks of debris to fall around the actors. To achieve this, the crew built lightweight beams out of hollow cardboard, which had to fall in the correct sequence. In another scene, Adrienne crawls along a water pipe that breaks. To film the scene without damaging equipment, the crew built a giant plastic box with a <b>plastic</b> <b>tray</b> underneath for the shoot. Three hoses ran through the pipe so water would spray in multiple directions.|$|E

[...] "Eat-in" [...] meals are provided on a <b>plastic</b> <b>tray</b> with a paper insert {{on the floor of the}} tray. [...] "Take-out" [...] meals are usually delivered with the contents enclosed in a distinctive McDonald's-branded brown paper bag. In both cases, the individual items are wrapped or boxed as appropriate.|$|E
50|$|<b>Plastic</b> <b>trays</b> such as oyster cages can {{again be}} {{utilized}} in bottom culture techniques. They provide simple {{and easy to}} use system. <b>Plastic</b> <b>trays</b> are effective in large numbers but their size is limited by the growth rates of scallops near the centre of cages due to reduced water and food flow rates.|$|R
50|$|Growing {{scallops}} in suspended <b>plastic</b> <b>trays</b> such as oyster cages {{can serve}} {{as an alternative to}} equipment like lantern nets. However, such systems can be expensive and have a rigid structure so cannot be folded and easily stored when not in use. In general, <b>plastic</b> <b>trays</b> are mostly used for temporary storage of scallops and for transportation of spat.|$|R
50|$|As of July 2012, Sheba {{is again}} {{available}} in the United States. However, it now comes in pull-tab cans {{as opposed to the}} former <b>plastic</b> <b>trays.</b> In mid-2014, Sheba once again returned to <b>plastic</b> <b>trays</b> with its Perfect Portions line. One can of Sheba brand cat food contains two servings, but the consumer must manually separate the portions for their pet. The Perfect Portions line reintroduced the plastic packaging by splitting the contents of one can into two separate serving trays, thus eliminating the need for manual separation. The line is priced slightly higher than Sheba canned food.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Our paper {{presents}} the results of several direct ex vitro rooting and acclimation experiments in blackberry (Rubus fruticosus), thornless cultivar 'Loch Ness'. The plant material consisted of plants propagated on Murashige & Skoog (MS) medium with 0. 5 mg/l benzyladenine (BAP). The shoots excised from the plantlets were rooted directly ex vitro in various substrates: floating perlite, plastic sponge inserted in floating cell <b>trays,</b> rockwool in <b>plastic</b> <b>trays</b> covered with transparent lids, as well as potting mixes available commercially: Florasol, Sol Vit G, Florimo. These experimental variants yielded good results regarding the rooting and acclimation percentages. Rooting in Jiffy pellets placed in floating cell trays as well as the use of rockwool in non-covered <b>plastic</b> <b>trays</b> yielded negative results. The experiments regarding ex vitro rooting and acclimation in aeroponics or by suspending the shoots in air saturated with vapour also yielded negative results...|$|R

The expansion contains components for performing optical experiments, including LED blocks, optical fibres and a 555 timer IC block. As some of the experiments involve two separate circuits, a <b>plastic</b> <b>tray</b> with room for 6 x 5 standard blocks is also provided.|$|E

Pacific oysters on these racks are cultured from wild spat, most of which is gathered in the Kaipara Harbour.
