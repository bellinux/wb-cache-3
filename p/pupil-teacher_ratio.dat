Francia closed the country's only religious seminary in 1822, mainly due to the bishop's mental illness (and from his purge of the power of the Church). Nevertheless, he made state education compulsory for all males in 1828, but he neither helped nor hindered the private schools. Even after this, the <b>pupil-teacher</b> <b>ratio</b> grew and there were less illiterate, with one teacher to 36 pupils by 1825 according to Richard Alan White.

40|$|While {{calls to}} reduce class size in school have {{considerable}} popular appeal, the related {{discussion of the}} scientific evidence has been limited and highly selective. The evidence about improvements in student achievement that {{can be attributed to}} smaller classes turns out to be meager and unconvincing. In the aggregate, <b>pupil-teacher</b> <b>ratios</b> have fallen dramatically for decades, but student performance has not improved. Explanations for these aggregate trends, including more poorly prepared students and the influence of special education, are insufficient to rationalize the overall patterns. International comparisons fail to show any significant improvements for having smaller <b>pupil-teacher</b> <b>ratios.</b> Detailed econometric evidence about the determinants of student performance confirms the general lack of any achievement results from smaller classes. Finally, widely cited experimental evidence actually offers little support for general reductions in class size. In sum, while policies to reduce class size may enjoy popular political appeal, such policies are very expensive and, according to the evidence, quite ineffective. (Contains 29 references.)
