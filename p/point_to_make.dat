5|$|Before 5,000 fans at Birmingham's Lakeview Park, Alabama {{lost to the}} Agricultural & Mechanical College of Alabama (now {{known as}} Auburn University) 32–22 {{in the first of}} what was {{subsequently}} dubbed the Iron Bowl. Auburn scored first on a 20-yard Rufus Dorsey touchdown run and again on a one-yard Dorsey run and took an 8–0 lead early in the first half. Frank Savage then scored Alabama's first touchdown on a 10-yard run and William B. Bankhead converted a successful extra point to cut the Auburn lead to 8–6. After Auburn scored a third touchdown to go up 14–6, Alabama responded with a 20-yard Dan Smith touchdown run and G. H. Kyser extra <b>point</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> the halftime score 14–12 in favor of Auburn.|$|E
5|$|Bulldogs battled the Dayton Triangles in week five. The Bulldogs {{opened the}} scoring {{in the first}} quarter on a two-yard rushing {{touchdown}} by Pete Calac. But the Triangles came back in the second quarter, scoring twice: back Frank Bacon had a four-yard rushing touchdown, and end Dave Reese had a 50-yard receiving touchdown. Guyon scored a 22-yard rushing touchdown during the corner, but the extra point sailed wide. In the third quarter, the Triangles responded with a 3-yard rushing touchdown by back Lou Partlow, but Dayton missed the extra <b>point</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> the score 20–14. Thorpe then came into the game, and kicked a 45-yard field goal to bring his team within three points. In the final minutes, Thorpe kicked another 35-yard field goal to tie it. The Triangles were the first team to score on the Bulldogs since the opening game of the previous year.|$|E
5|$|Hygrometer: Prototype {{hygrometers}} were devised {{and developed}} in the hills during the Western Han dynasty in Ancient China to elucidate mechanisms of long-range meteorological fluctuations. The Chinese used a bar of charcoal and a lump of earth: its dry weight was taken and then compared with its damp weight after being exposed in the air. The differences in weight was used to tally the humidity level. Other techniques were applied using mass to measure humidity such as when the air was dry, the bar of charcoal would be light while the air was humid, the bar of charcoal would be heavy. By hanging a lump of earth and a bar of charcoal on the two ends of a staff separately and adding a fixated lifting string on the middle <b>point</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> the staff horizontal in dry air, an ancient hygrometer was made.|$|E

5|$|In {{possibly}} {{the last years}} of the 15th century, the Sanmicheli were involved in the stone decoration of the Caprioli chapel in the Church of San Giorgio, for which Cairano, almost simultaneously, prepared his Adoration, demonstrating for the first time outside of the Loggia a cooperation between the two studios. Bartolomeo Sanmicheli, {{at the beginning of the}} new century, attempted at this <b>point</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> a comeback in the local art scene with the Ark of San Tiziano of 1505, characterized by a strong decorative quality. He possibly also aspired to the commission of the ark of Sant'Apollonio, which had been up for grabs since the discovery of the relics of the holy bishop in 1503. An early involvement of Sanmicheli can be surmised in the Martinengo mausoleum, but the commission was awarded to Bernardino dei Crossi in 1503. However, based on the prevailing decorative nature of the monument, which is much more rigorously classical, it can be attributed to Cairano.|$|E
5|$|In week five, the Triangles battled the Canton Bulldogs, {{who had the}} Hall-of-Fame back Jim Thorpe.

25|$|When {{the suit}} is being used correctly, the bubble inside it is {{relatively}} small, and its movement is not important. The bubble may be large {{for a variety of}} reasons: if a diver has ascended without venting the suit; if the valve supplying gas to dry suit fails in the open position; or if the diver is over-weighted, and extra air has been added to the suit at some <b>point</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> the diver neutrally buoyant. The size of the bubble can be minimised by being correctly weighted and venting excess gas from the suit on ascent. Some divers ensure that the bubble remains {{at the top of their}} body by using the buoyancy compensator to counteract any excess weighting, keeping only the minimum gas necessary to avoid squeeze inside the drysuit.|$|E
25|$|UCLA {{opened the}} scoring when running back Greg Jones {{scored on a}} 12-yard run. Sophomore Zenon Andrusyshyn kicked the extra <b>point</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> it 7–0. After a USC punt, Beban had the Bruins on the move again at the USC 41-yard line. The next play, Beban took a one step drop, rolled to the right, and faked a {{sideline}} pass to the right, then wheeled around and blindly threw a pass in the left flat intended for running back Greg Jones. However, USC linebacker Pat Cashman was not fooled by the fake {{to the right and}} jumped in front of Jones to take an interception return 55 yards for a USC touchdown. Rikki Aldridge kicked the extra point to tie the game. While O.J. Simpson's 64-yard run became famous, this play by Cashman turned the game around.|$|E
25|$|Oklahoma {{came back}} in the second half early with a field goal, {{followed}} by a goal line touchdown run by Chris Brown. The Sooners went for a 2-point conversion after the touchdown, but Bradford's pass was incomplete, leaving the score at 20-15. The Mountaineers answered back with a 17-yard run by Noel Devine for the touchdown to put the Mountaineers up 27–15. The Mountaineers scored again to end the third quarter, this time on a 30-yard reverse run by Darius Reynaud, to put the Mountaineers up 34–15 going into the fourth quarter. The Sooners scored early again, off of a Bradford pass to Quentin Chaney, but yet again failed a 2-point conversion attempt. West Virginia continued to roll however, as White hooked up with receiver Tito Gonzales for a 79-yard touchdown pass to put the Mountaineers up 41-21. The pass is the longest offensive play in West Virginia school bowl history. Oklahoma scored again on a Bradford pass, this time to Juaquin Iglesias, but this time kicked the extra <b>point</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> the score 41-28. The Mountaineers sealed the game with six minutes left on a 65-yard touchdown run by Noel Devine, his second score of the game.|$|E

25|$|On {{the first}} play of the second quarter, Chris Brown ran into the endzone for a Sooner touchdown. Garrett Hartley punched in the extra <b>point</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> it 7–3, Oklahoma. Missouri then put {{together}} a 14play drive, but failed to score a touchdown. They had the ball, first and goal, at the Oklahoma 9. Daniel chose to keep the ball and ran it up the middle for an apparent score. However, the officials ruled that when his knee touched the ground, the ball had not broken {{the plane of the}} goal line, and the ball was spotted at the 1yard line. The Sooners' defense then kept the Tigers out of the endzone, ultimately forcing another Wolfert field goal. The score at this point was 7–6, Oklahoma. The Sooners got the ball but could not do anything with it, punting it away from the 50-yard line. Missouri promptly threw three incomplete passes and punted it back to Oklahoma, where it went out of bounds at the 50. Oklahoma passed its way into the redzone on this drive, and then rushed their way into the endzone, ending with a 2yard play by Chris Brown for the score. Hartley's extra point was good, making the score 14–6, Oklahoma. With 3:06 left in the half, Mizzou pressed down the field, aided by a pass to Martin Rucker for 13yards, to which an Oklahoma 15yard facemask penalty was added. The Tigers ended up on the Oklahoma 4yard line, where Missouri set up for the pass, spreading the Sooners' defense out. This let Chase Daniel easily jog across the goal line for a touchdown. Interestingly, the Tigers decided to go for a two-point conversion and the tie, rather than attempt the almost sure kick and trail by one at the half. The play was a double reverse; Jeremy Maclin ended up with the ball and passed it to Martin Rucker, who was wide open in the endzone. Oklahoma got the ball back with 5 seconds on the clock and took a knee, ending the first half with a score of 14–14.|$|E

During the book tour for the novel, Gibson elaborated on this theme, proposing that the ubiquity of connectivity meant that what had been called [...] "cyberspace" [...] is no longer a discrete sphere of activity separate from and secondary to normal human activity, but that those increasingly less common parts of normal life free from connectivity were the exception.

500|$|Richmond joined Hendrick Motorsports in 1986, {{where he}} {{teamed up with}} veteran crew chief Harry Hyde. It took the team {{until the middle of}} the season to gel. Richmond had {{suffered}} a 64-race winless streak that was finally broken at the Van Scoy Diamond Mine 500 at Pocono in June 1986. After two straight second-place finishes at Charlotte and Riverside, Richmond started the Pocono event in third place inside the second row. That race saw a caution for rain with five laps left before the halfway point. NASCAR wanted the cars to get to the halfway <b>point</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> the race official, so the sanctioning body had the drivers slowly circle the track. It took the drivers 26 minutes to complete the laps, and the rain was so heavy that some drivers had to look out their side windows because they could not see out their windshields. Two hours later, the track had dried and the race resumed with Richmond in third. After Richmond's car was adjusted to remove the [...] "push", the car was more to his liking. Because his radio did not work, he was unable to communicate with his crew chief, Hyde, and he made his final pit stop with 37 laps left. Hyde worried that Richmond had stopped a lap too early to ensure that he would have enough fuel {{to make it to the}} end.
