5000|$|The final major Micro Channel {{architecture}} {{improvement was}} POS, the <b>Programmable</b> <b>Option</b> <b>Select,</b> which allowed all setup {{to take place}} in software. This feature is taken for granted now, but at the time setup was a huge chore for ISA systems. POS was a simple system that included device IDs in firmware, which the drivers in the computer were supposed to interpret. (This type of software-configuration system is known as plug-and-play today.) The feature did not really live up to its promise; the automatic configuration was fine when it worked, but it frequently did not - resulting in an unbootable computer - and resolving the problem by manual intervention was much more difficult than configuring an ISA system, not least because the documentation for the MCA device would tend to assume that the automatic configuration would work and so did not provide the necessary information to set it up by hand, unlike ISA device documentation which by necessity provided full details (however having to physically remove and check all IRQ settings, then find and set the new IRQ for a new device -- if a suitable one was available -- for ISA was no fun at all, and beyond many users... it is obvious why the attempt was made to move to software arbitrated configuration, and why this was to later succeed in the form of PnP.) ...|$|E

40|$|Reduced-voltage {{differential}} signaling (RVDS) {{is a novel}} interface for TFT-LCD panels with a chip-on-glass (COG) structure, {{which has}} a point-to-point topology and a voltage mode differential signaling scheme. The voltage-driving interface scheme has advantages in high-speed operation owing to its relatively small time constant for the resistive channel condition. And reduced-voltage signaling can reduce the power consumption of a transmitter. The display source driver IC with an RVDS interface, which is fabricated by using a 0. 25 -mu m CMOS process with a 2. 5 -V logic supply voltage, offers a high data rate up to 500 Mbps, low-current consumption of 2. 2 mA, and good EMI characteristics. Also, an RVDS interface has <b>programmable</b> <b>options</b> that control the bandwidth, system power, and EMI performance. Therefore, the RVDS interface is a competitive solution for low-power, low-cost, and slim notebook applicationsopen 1...|$|R
