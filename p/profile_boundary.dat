40|$|The {{conventional}} {{methods for}} the design of the blades in the case of axial turbomachines are considered, taking into account difficulties concerning the determination of optimal blade profiles. These difficulties have been partly overcome {{as a consequence of the}} introduction of new numerical methods during the last few years. It is pointed out that, in the case of the subsonic range, a new procedure is now available for the determination of the form of blade profile on the basis of a given velocity distribution on the profile surface. The search for a profile form with favorable characteristics is consequently transformed into a search for a favorable velocity or pressure distribution on the blade. The distribution of velocities depends to a large degree on the characteristics of the <b>profile</b> <b>boundary</b> layers. The considered concept is not new. However, its practical implementation has only recently become possible.

The key features of the BIEM are its versatility {{and the ability to}} compute rapidly any portion of the sound field without the need to compute the entire field.

40|$|The {{current work}} {{presents}} {{the development of}} a numerical methodology to investigate sliding vane rotary machines by means of advanced design tools such as the Computational Fluid Dynamics ones. Although highly limited in this topic, literature shows that the major constraint for the employment of such approaches is the deformation and motion of the rotor mesh, i. e. the computational grid related to the fluid volume between stator, rotor and blades of the positive displacement vane device. To address these issues, a novel grid generation approach is herein proposed and accomplished through a series of steps: geometrical 2 D modeling of the machine cross section <b>profile,</b> <b>boundary</b> generation of the rotor mesh and, eventually, distribution of computational nodes using algebraic algorithms with transfinite interpolation, post orthogonalization and smoothing.

The authors share the opinion of Dr. Cumpsty and Dr. Dong regarding the transient behavior of the <b>profile</b> <b>boundary</b> layer. Hot-film measurements along the profile surface, taken after these papers were submitted, revealed that while the onset of transition moved upstream the completion of transition on the suction side took place farther downstream, resulting in a transitional boundary layer over a large part of the blade sur-face. This has already been mentioned at the presentation of the paper and is discussed in great detail in the most recent paper by Schulz and Gallus (1990). Indeed, to relate the increase in momentum thickness at the trailing edge in the case with rotor purely to the earlier onset of transition is some kind of oversimplification. The difference in the boundary layer growth can be attributed to several causes as there are: 8 Increase in channel diffusion, because of the reduced corner stall regions; s Increase in the free-stream turbulence level; • Earlier boundary layer transition; s Slightly earlier trailing edge separation with rotor (com...|$|E
40|$|In {{order to}} acquire {{experimental}} data on an airfoil at high angles of attack, wind tunnel tests {{were carried out}}. The wind tunnel tests were carried out at Re= 1. 25 · 106 (based on chord length) on a 2 -D model with 0. 45 m chord and 2 m span based on the FFA-W 3 - 211 airfoil geometry (21 % thick). This airfoil is typically used in wind turbine blades. The {{purpose of the study}} was to examine the flow field and study the recirculating region around the airfoil. The present study was carried at 8 ◦ and 15 ◦ angle of attack, with more focus on the latter, by using three methods; static pressure measurement, oil flow visualisation and Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV). It was of particular interest to determine the position of the separation and the resulting data could than provide appropriate data for validation of computational numerical calculations (CFD) for separated flow cases. Based on the velocity vector field obtained by the PIV data, the velocity <b>profile,</b> <b>boundary</b> layer quan-tities and the backflow coefficients were derived.

40|$|The most {{questionable}} are {{the values}} of pressures between rock and support resulting from common deformations on the contact area between rock and support. Therefore the modelling and design of the tunnel support is not reliable, if {{it is based on}} active rock pressure resulting from this common deformations. The inversion of the design procedure is proposed. Instead of the active extreme pressure of the rock on support, the influence of ultimate reaction of the support on the rock has to be analysed. This procedure can be performed using the ultimate load principle, as proposed by Eurocodc 7 (Geotechnies). Normally, the rock has the tendency to increase the common conver¬gence until the support reaches its ultimate state. So, loading of <b>profile</b> <b>boundary</b> with the ultimate possible reaction of the support is very plausible. The reactive support pressures have to be probable and itself in equilibrium. The ultimate reactive load has to be reduced by Euro-code safety factor for structural elements and applied on the rock with given properties, or alternatively (as proposed by Eurocode 7) the soil or rock properties have to be diminished and calculated with full ultimate support pressures. If the rock with given (or proposed) pro¬perties and loaded with ultimate reactive pressures resulting from supposed support, satisfy its failure criterion, then is the compound system support-rock verificatcd. By this procedure, the number of relevant material properties is reduce to the primary stress ratio and the constants defining the failure criterion.

40|$|Hollow fibre and {{spiral wound}} {{membrane}} (SWM) modules {{are the most}} common commercially available membrane modules. The latter dominate especially for RO, NF and UF and are the focus of this study. The main difficulty these types of modules face is concentration polarisation. In SWM modules, the spacer meshes that keep the membrane leaves apart also help reduce the effects of concentration polarisation. The spacer filaments act as flow obstructions, and thus encourage flow destabilisation and increase mass transfer enhancement. One of the detrimental aspects of the use of spacers is an increase of pressure losses in SWM modules. This study analyses the mechanisms that give rise to mass transfer enhancement in narrow spacer-filled channels, and investigates the relationship between flow destabilisation, energy losses and mass transfer. It shows that the regions of high mass transfer on the membrane surface correlate mainly with those regions where the fluid flow is towards the membrane. Based on the insights gained from this analysis, a series of multi-layer spacer designs are proposed and evaluated. In this thesis, a Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) model was used to simulate steady and unsteady flows with mass transfer in two- and three-dimensional narrow channels containing spacers. A solute with a Schmidt number of 600 dissolving from the wall and channel Reynolds numbers up to 1683 were considered. A fully-developed concentration <b>profile</b> <b>boundary</b> condition was utilised {{in order to reduce the}} computational costs of the simulations. Time averaging and Fourier analysis were performed to gain insight into the dynamics of the different flow regimes encountered, ranging from steady flow to vortex shedding behind the spacer filaments. The relationships between 3 D flow effects, vortical flow, pressure drop and mass transfer enhancement were explored. Greater mass transfer enhancement was found for the 3 D geometries modelled, when compared with 2 D geometries, due to wall shear perpendicular to the bulk flow and streamwise vortices. Form drag was identified as the main component of energy loss for the flow conditions analysed. Implications for the design of improved spacer meshes, such as extra layers of spacer filaments to direct the bulk flow towards the membrane walls, and filament profiles to reduce form drag are discussed...|$|E
40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] University of Washington, 2014 The {{mechanisms}} {{through which}} trapped lee waves decay, and where this decay occurs, are {{of utmost importance}} {{in order to understand}} the impact that these waves have on the larger-scale climate system. Previous studies have shown trapped waves as contributing a significant fraction of the total orographic drag, but they remain poorly understood. In this dissertation, two decay mechanisms are analyzed and compared [...] - stratospheric leakage, and boundary layer absorption. Decay of lee waves through upward leakage of wave energy towards the stable stratosphere is studied primarily using a linear Boussinesq model, forced by either a three-layer atmosphere or a more realistic four-layer atmosphere containing vertical wind shear and an elevated inversion. Weak downstream decay occurs due to the stratosphere in the highly-idealized three-layer atmosphere, albeit at too slow of a rate for the typical decay seen in nature. In the more realistic profile, rapid downstream decay occurs through stratospheric leakage [...] - leading to a removal of the wavetrain within 1. 5 wavelengths in the most extreme case of a 200 m deep elevated inversion. As the depth the elevated inversion is reduced, the potential rate of downstream decay is increased. For all profiles, the rate of leakage due to the stratosphere is shown to be maximized for values of stratospheric stability (N s) slightly larger than for the threshold for decay, with a decreasing trend in the rate of decay as the stratospheric stability is further increased. The impact of the stratosphere and boundary layer on trapped wave decay are both simulated using a full nonlinear numerical model. Decay through boundary layer absorption is seen to vary slightly with the atmospheric profile [...] - relating to the location and the structure of the resonant wave duct compared to the boundary layer. Rates of downstream decay due to the stratosphere agree well between the linear and nonlinear models. Given the highly-idealized atmospheric <b>profile,</b> <b>boundary</b> layer decay is dominant with minimal decay occurring through stratospheric leakage at any N s. With the realistic profile shown by the linear model to be suitable for strong stratospheric leakage, downstream decay is stronger due to the stratosphere than for the roughest lower boundary simulated (z 0 = 0. 5 m, where z 0 is the roughness length). A move towards understanding the decay of trapped waves in three dimensions is also discussed through use of high-resolution simulations of lee waves downwind of the Aleutian islands using WRF. In the control run, close agreement is found between the modeled wave field, and that observed by satellite. As the roughness length of the lower boundary is increased, the rate of decay is noted to increase by approximately 10 % across the range of z 0 simulated [...] - although much of this increase occurs across the change from 10 - 2 m to 10 - 1 m, rather than the more linear increase seen in our 2 D simulations. An additional subject discussed is the generation of striations in stacked lenticular clouds. High-resolution numerical simulations show that striations in excess of 150 m in width may be generated by perturbations in the relative humidity as small as ± 0. 25 %. Perturbations of this scale are small enough to be likely ubiquitous in nature, explaining why these clouds always have a layered appearance...|$|E

A cumulative Gaussian is fit to the collection of averaged voxel intensities yielding estimates of (1) extrapolated intensity values for voxels located far inside and outside of a boundary and (2) anatomical boundary location. Intrinsic measures of confidence {{have been developed}} to eliminate low-confidence parameter estimates. Thresholds placed on these measures of confidence allow for high-confidence unsupervised classification of boundaries. The validity of gradient-oriented profiles is demonstrated on artificially generated three-dimensional test data and shown to accurately parameterize and classify the boundary. Applying the measures of confidence and establishing thresholds, the accuracy of boundary location and intensities estimates improved drastically, making them a high-quality replacement for simpler methods of boundary detection. Towards shape analysis, gradient-oriented <b>boundary</b> <b>profiles</b> are applied to an existing a medial-based approach to shape analysis, known as core atoms.
