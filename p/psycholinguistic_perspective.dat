40|$|While {{research}} on third language (L 3) and multilingualism has recently shown remarkable growth, {{the fundamental question}} of what makes trilingualism special compared to bilingualism, and indeed monolingualism, continues to be evaded. In this contribution we consider whether {{there is such a}} thing as a true monolingual, and if there is a difference between dialects, styles, registers and languages. While linguistic and psycholinguistic studies suggest differences in the processing of a third, compared to the first or second language, neurolinguistic research has shown that generally the same areas of the brain are activated during language use in proficient multilinguals. It is concluded that while from traditional linguistic and <b>psycholinguistic</b> <b>perspectives</b> there are grounds to differentiate monolingual, bilingual and multilingual processing, a more dynamic perspective on language processing in which development over time is the core issue, leads to a questioning of the notion of languages as separate entities in the brain...|$|R

In a series of three experiments it was found that existing compounds such as "warehouse" appear to be represented in the mental lexicon as morphologically-complex full forms. On the other hand, novel compounds such as "winehouse" appear to be decomposed into their constituent morphemes in the process of word recognition. It was also found that the constraints of English orthography {{play a significant role in}} the interpretation of novel compounds. The locus of the orthographic effect, however, appears to be post-lexical.

40|$|This {{paper is}} to review the {{empirical}} literature in L 2 reading research in the last 20 years and to discuss both {{the advantages and disadvantages}} of the schema theory in L 2 reading research.

It is true that many researchers, following the schema theory, have reported that the interaction between the text information and the readers'relevant knowledge leads to successful comprehension. In LI reading research, however, it has been reported that the readers'prior knowledge occasionally disturbs their comprehension of the texts, and this kind of problem has never been reported in L 2 reading research.

40|$|AbstractThis article {{proposes a}} {{framework}} for reflections on professional development: the methodological underpinnings and practices of teaching English in terms of <b>psycholinguistic</b> <b>perspectives.</b> The author {{highlights the importance of}} personal beliefs and experiences which contribute to critical reflection on the psychology of teaching as the distinguishing attribute of reflective practitioners. The term self-reflection as developed here merges beliefs and values regarding {{the state of the art}} theories of learning via conscious consideration. Reflections on actual methodological practices and classroom-based experiences teaching practice, have been given with some examples of teaching practices. Assumptions about human potential and learning which challenge the psychology of language learners are briefly discussed in terms of the application of actual methodological practices. Recently social constructivism has been the dominant psychological approach to the process of learning and teaching. Based upon this approach, learners interpret realities entirely differently and there is no such a thing as an objective reality. Teachers who follow the constructivist framework always emphasize the process of interaction among individual learners. They also take into account the specific contexts in which people interact with one another to understand concepts and ideas. Learners see the world and the learning situation through their own specific idiosyncratic lens and the teachers need to be well aware of the amplitude of the ways elements of pedagogical enterprise are shaped by the learner...|$|R

The study covers the following aspects in five chapters. Chapter 1 reports and analyses the findings of the research done to identify inefficient reading problems in the Chinese EFL reading situation. Based on the analysis of the existing problems, the chapter comes to a tentative conclusion that teaching reading skills could be one possible solution to the problems. To prove the relevance of the conclusion, the second chapter turns to a critical review of literature {{about the nature of the}} reading process. The emphasis in this chapter is on the <b>psycholinguistic</b> <b>perspective</b> of the reading process and its relevance to EFL teaching in China. Related to the <b>psycholinguistic</b> <b>perspective</b> of the reading process, Chapter 3 moves to some more specific issues concerning reading efficiency. The discussion deals with various factors which can influence reading efficiency and points out implications for teaching in the Chinese EFL reading situation. Having considered reading efficiency theoretically in Chapter 2 and 3, the study turns to the practical teaching of reading skills in Chapter 4 and 5. In these two chapters, efficient reading skills are analysed and suggestions are made about practical classroom teaching. It is hoped that these analyses and suggestions will give some impetus to improving the teaching of reading in the Chinese EFL field...|$|E

40|$|Code-switching {{from one}} {{language}} {{to the next}} {{is seen as a}} hallmark of bilingualism (Meuter & Allport, 1999). Sociolinguistic approaches to code-switching have stressed the social significance of the phenomenon: bilinguals often use code-switching for identification purposes, showing their belonging to a social group (cf. Auer, 1998). Psycholinguistic accounts, on the other hand, have mainly focused on the switching costs involved, {{in the sense that it}} takes the brain time to adjust from one language system to the next (cf. Grosjean, 1995). In recent years, the behavioral ecology of the bilingual has become prominent in theorizing about code-switching (cf. Green, 2011) : bilinguals greatly differ in the extent to and contexts in which they code-switch and this in turn affects the processing costs they show. This new approach thus allows for a unification between previously distinct sociolinguistic and <b>psycholinguistic</b> <b>perspectives</b> on code-switching. In this paper, we explore the dynamic between code-switching contexts and switching costs, by presenting spontaneous code-switching data (collected as part of a semi-structured interview) from sequential Dutch-English bilinguals (L 1 Dutch speakers now living in Australia). The quantity and quality of the code-switches found in this population are related to their self-reported language use patterns, linguistic measures (such as productive and receptive vocabulary tests) and cognitive control tasks, tapping mainly inhibition (such as a Stroop Test) ...|$|R

The article {{outlines}} {{the study of}} political texts from <b>psycholinguistic</b> <b>perspectives.</b> The research generalizes and empirically verifies a psycholinguistic approach {{to the study of}} political discourse and focuses on frame analysis, {{one of the most powerful}} psycholinguistic techniques. Frame structure embraces conceptual components that allow accumulating information from different sources. The public speeches of two great Ukrainian and American political leaders Viktor Yushchenko and Barack Obama were the principal sources of the analysis. Frame analysis was applied to study cross-cultural peculiarities that depict national nature of two cultures. Data analysis shows that discourse of the Ukrainian leader is mostly focused on categories such as people, power, liberty. The discourse of the American leader contains categories such as economy, money, people, psychological constructs. The results show that people have become top-priority for V. Yushchenko. They are the people the Ukrainian politician addresses, believes and trusts. V. Yushchenko also focuses on freedom, independence and liberty of any Ukrainian citizen. B. Obama is deeply concentrated on economy and finance of his country. It has become obvious that he is ready to implement the set of reforms for the country to thrive. The category of psychological constructs shows that the American politician is full of respect and proud for his country ant population. The radical variety of two speeches is caused by different economic conditions, values and mentality of two cultures and personal purposes and objectives of the two politicians...|$|R
40|$|Despite an {{explosion}} {{of research in the}} affective sciences during the last few decades, interdisciplinary theories of human emotions are lacking. Here we present a neurobiological theory of emotions that includes emotions which are uniquely human (such as complex moral emotions), considers the role of language for emotions, advances the understanding of neural correlates of attachment-related emotions, and integrates emotion theories from different disciplines. We propose that four classes of emotions originate from four neuroanatomically distinct cerebral systems. These emotional core systems constitute a quartet of affect systems: the brainstem-, diencephalon-, hippocampus-, and orbitofrontal-centred affect systems. The affect systems were increasingly differentiated during the course of evolution, and each of these systems generates a specific class of affects (e. g., ascending activation, pain/pleasure, attachment-related affects, and moral affects). The affect systems interact with each other, and activity of the affect systems has effects on – and interacts with – biological systems denoted here as emotional effector systems. These effector systems include motor systems (which produce actions, action tendencies, and motoric expression of emotion), peripheral physiological arousal, as well as attentional and memory systems. Activity of affect systems and effector systems is synthesized into an emotion percept (pre-verbal subjective feeling), which can be transformed (or reconfigured) into a symbolic code such as language. Moreover, conscious cognitive appraisal (involving rational thought, logic, and usually language) can regulate, modulate, and partly initiate, activity of affect systems and effector systems. Our emotion theory integrates psychological, neurobiological, sociological, anthropological, and <b>psycholinguistic</b> <b>perspectives</b> on emotions in an interdisciplinary manner, aiming to advance the understanding of human emotions and their neural correlates...|$|R

Electrophysiological data provide support for this distinction and further substantiate the claim that proper names differ from definite descriptions.

40|$|About the book: This volume brings {{together}} work by scholars with backgrounds in linguistics, psycholinguistics, developmental psychology, education, and language pathology. As such, the book adds <b>psycholinguistic</b> and crosslinguistic <b>perspectives</b> to the clinical and classroom approaches that {{have dominated the}} study of “later language development”. Incorporating insights from prior language acquisition research, it goes beyond preschool age to consider both isolated utterances and extended discourse, conversational interactions and monologic text construction, and both written and spoken language use from early school-age across adolescence. Data from French, Hebrew, Spanish, and Swedish as well as English cover varied domains: morphology and lexicon, syntax and verb–argument structure, as well as peer interaction, spelling, processing of on-line writing, and reading poetry. The epilogue suggests explanations for the findings documented.

40|$|The {{study of}} code-switching {{has been carried}} out from linguistic, <b>psycholinguistic,</b> and sociolinguistic <b>perspectives,</b> largely in {{isolation}} from each other. This volume attempts to unite these three research strands by placing at the centre of the enquiry the role played by social factors in the occurrence, forms, and outcomes of code-switching. The contributions in this volume are divided into three parts: “code-switching between cognition and socio-pragmatics”, “multilingual interaction and identity”, and “code-switching and social structure”. The case studies represent contact settings on five continents and feature languages with diverse linguistic affiliations. They are predictive and descriptive in their research goals and rely on experimental or naturalistic data. But they share the common goal of seeking to explain how social structures, ideologies, and identity impact on the grammatical and conversational features of code-switching and language mixing, and on the emergence of mixed languages.
