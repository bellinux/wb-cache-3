50|$|In Europe, the Trooper/Big Horn {{was sold}} in Europe as an Opel or Vauxhall from 1992.

The Monterey name also saw use by Holden in Australia, at first (from 1994) as the top equipment level (V6 only) for what was there called the Jackaroo, but later as a standalone nameplate for the more luxurious part of the range.|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{determine}} how the length of plate appearance relates to hitter success metrics and what factors a hitter can control to impact success. In 2011, 1743 MLB plate appearances were monitored by length of plate appearance time, outcome with success or failure, extra-base hit percentage, location, inning, final pitch velocity, etc. Data was fractionated to compare plate appearance length ( 97 s), and percentages of both success and extra-base hits. One way ANOVAs were run to assess differences between plate appearance durations and each of the outcome variables. <b>Plate</b> appearances <b>lasting</b> less than 30 seconds and longer than 97 seconds had greater on-base percentages than those <b>plate</b> appearances <b>lasting</b> from 30 - 97 seconds. <b>Plate</b> Appearances <b>lasting</b> less than 30 seconds resulted in greater extra-base hit percentages than those lasting longer than 30 seconds. Batters had greater success against left-handed pitchers than right-handed pitchers (. 336 vs. 410 OBP, p<. 005). When fractionated, there was a statistically significant difference between fast pitch success or slow pitch success (p=. 0167) ...|$|R

5000|$|As an {{alternative}} to physically counting the plates present, measuring the total thickness of all the plates and their texts (excluding all other pages) gives a reasonable indication {{of whether or not}} a set is complete.

40|$|Abstract. Bipolar {{plate is}} the key {{component}} of proton exchange membrane (PEM) fuel cell and represents {{a significant part of}} the overall cost and the total weight in a fuel cell stack. Many research have been done on the manufacturing methods of bipolar plate, among which stamping is very popular. With the increasing of the channel number and complexity, its dimensional error caused by sprinkback will change a lot, even under the same forming process. And the risk of crack is also different. These all impact the quality of bipolar plate. In order to predict deformation of channels and the plate’s quality, the displacement along X-axis, the strain and stress state, and the displacement along Z-axis are measured. The results show that 1) the risk of crack increases with the increasing of channel number; 2) the springbacks increase with the increasing of channel number; 3) the most dangerous point locates on the right internal fillet of the <b>plate’s</b> <b>last</b> section...|$|R

5000|$|Another {{advantage}} of vitreograph printmaking {{is its ability}} to withstand the pressure of the printing press with no discernible breakdown of the imagery, even after numerous runs.
