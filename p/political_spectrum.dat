National Journals 2004 study of roll-call votes assigned Clinton a rating of 30 in the <b>political</b> <b>spectrum,</b> relative to the Senate at the time, with a rating of 1 being most liberal and 100 being most conservative.

5|$|Ideologically, Poedjangga Baroe {{supported}} a modern, united nation with one language, Indonesian. However, the different {{cultural and political}} views of its contributors led the publication to have undefined leanings. To maintain a neutral political position, the magazine published writings that covered numerous aspects of the <b>political</b> <b>spectrum.</b> In cultural discourse, the magazine published disagreeing polemics over the proper balance of Westernization and tradition necessary for the country's development.|$|E

25|$|The Warsaw Ghetto Uprising of January and April 1943 {{included}} {{the participation of}} both right- and left-leaning Zionist organizations. Its commander, Mordechai Anielewicz, was a Socialist-Zionist and Zionists of all <b>political</b> <b>spectra</b> {{played a leading role}} in the struggle. The uprising's left-leaning survivors eventually made their way to Palestine and founded two Kibbutzim, Lohamei HaGeta'ot and Yad Mordechai.|$|R
50|$|Media {{and digital}} {{networking}} have become important features of modern anti-corporate movements. The speed, flexibility, {{and ability to}} reach a massive potential audience has provided a technological foundation for contemporary network social movement structure. As a result, communities and interpersonal connections have transformed. The internet supports and strengthens local ties, but also facilitates new patterns for political activity. Activists have used this medium to operate between both the online and offline <b>political</b> <b>spectrums.</b>|$|R
5|$|Writers for Poedjangga Baroe did {{not share}} a united {{political}} view and the magazine ostensibly stayed politically neutral. This stance was adopted to ensure the magazine did not fall afoul of the colonial government's censors and to protect contributors employed by the government. However, writings falling under various parts the <b>political</b> <b>spectrum</b> were published, including works by cultural nationalists, a sonnet dedicated to Marxist theorist Rosa Luxemburg, and notes on fascism.|$|E
5|$|According to polls {{conducted}} by mainstream media, most Japanese people had perceived {{the flag of}} Japan as the national flag even before {{the passage of the}} Law Regarding the National Flag and National Anthem in 1999. Despite this, controversies surrounding the use of the flag in school events or media still remain. For example, liberal newspapers such as Asahi Shimbun and Mainichi Shimbun often feature articles critical of the flag of Japan, reflecting their readerships' <b>political</b> <b>spectrum.</b> To other Japanese, the flag represents the time where democracy was suppressed when Japan was an empire.|$|E

5000|$|The Trijicon biblical verses controversy, {{known by}} the sobriquet Jesus rifles, refers to the {{stamping}} of Bible verse references (e.g. Rev21:23) onto telescopic sights for rifles manufactured by Trijicon, which bear religious inscriptions. Users and purchasers of the equipment- which included the United States Army and Marine Corps and military units around the world- were unaware of the inscriptions. Upon discovery of the practice in 2010, controversy erupted across religious and <b>political</b> <b>spectra</b> regarding inappropriate and sacrilegious aspects.|$|R
50|$|According to Vittorio Messori, a {{major source}} of hostility towards Opus Dei is the {{application}} of political categories to a religious phenomenon such as Opus Dei. These groups against Opus Dei, he says, see everything happening in the world only through the prism of power-seeking, that is, of <b>political</b> <b>spectrums</b> of people in the left versus people on the right. Since Opus Dei {{is one of the major}} religious groups, the application of politically motivated campaigns against it is even stronger.|$|R
5|$|By {{the end of}} the 1770s, Johnson {{had become}} an {{established}} publisher. Writers—particularly Dissenters—sought him out, and his home started to become the centre of a radical and stimulating intellectual milieu. Because he was willing to publish multiple opinions on issues, he was respected as a publisher by writers from across the <b>political</b> <b>spectrum.</b> Johnson published many Unitarian works, but he also issued works criticizing them; although he was an abolitionist, he also published works arguing in favour of the slave trade; he supported inoculation, but he also published works critical of the practice.|$|E
5|$|Despite his mixed legacy, Sargsyan is {{now widely}} {{recognized}} as a national hero across the <b>political</b> <b>spectrum</b> and by the public. Given the honorific Sparapet, he {{made significant contributions to}} the establishment of Armenia as independent state and ensuring its security as the founder of the Armenian Army. He has also been criticized by human rights organizations for being undemocratic, especially for his role in elections. Sargsyan was awarded the highest titles of Armenia and Nagorno-Karabakh—National Hero of Armenia and Hero of Artsakh.|$|E

5|$|Thatcher {{narrowly}} escaped {{injury in}} an IRA assassination {{attempt at a}} Brighton hotel {{early in the morning}} on 12 October 1984. Five people were killed, including the wife of minister John Wakeham. Thatcher was staying at the hotel to prepare for the Conservative Party conference, which she insisted should open as scheduled the following day. She delivered her speech as planned, though rewritten from her original draft, in a move that was widely supported across the <b>political</b> <b>spectrum</b> and enhanced her popularity with the public.|$|E
5|$|Thatcher's premiership {{was also}} marked by periods of high {{unemployment}} and social unrest, and many critics {{on the left}} of the <b>political</b> <b>spectrum</b> fault her economic policies for the unemployment level; many of the areas affected by mass unemployment as well as her monetarist economic policies remained blighted for decades, by such social problems as drug abuse and family breakdown. Unemployment did not fall below its 1979 level during her tenure, although in June 1990 the recorded rate (5.4%) was lower than the rate in April 1979 (5.5%). The long-term effects of her policies on manufacturing remain contentious.|$|E

His mandates of mayor, municipal councilor and deputy were indeed the means to move forward cultural, urban planning or architecture projects.

5|$|The James Bond {{character}} and related media have triggered {{a number of}} criticisms and reactions across the <b>political</b> <b>spectrum,</b> and are still highly debated in popular culture studies. Some observers accuse Bond novels and films of misogyny and sexism. Geographers have considered the role of exotic locations in the movies in {{the dynamics of the}} Cold War, with power struggles among blocs playing out in the peripheral areas. Other critics claim that 21st century Bond movies reflect imperial nostalgia. American conservative critics, particularly in the 1960s and 1970s, saw Bond as a nihilistic, hedonistic, and amoral character that challenged family values.|$|E

5|$|A {{mathematical}} look at {{the voting}} numbers reveals that Bush {{would have had to}} win 12.55% of Perot's 18.91% of the vote, 66.36% of Perot's support base, to earn a majority of the vote, and would have needed to win nearly every state Clinton won by less than five percentage points. Furthermore, Perot was most popular in states that strongly favored either Clinton or Bush, limiting his real electoral impact for either candidate. He gained relatively little support in the Southern states and happened to have the best showing in states with few electoral votes. Perot appealed to disaffected voters all across the <b>political</b> <b>spectrum</b> who had grown weary of the two-party system. Perot's anti-NAFTA stance played a role in his support, and Perot voters were relatively moderate on hot button social issues such as abortion and gay rights.|$|E
