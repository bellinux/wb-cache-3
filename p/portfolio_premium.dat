40|$|We {{examine the}} pricing of {{information}}-quality risk with a continuous-time {{model in the}} spirit of Merton’s (1973) ICAPM, in which information on returns is continuously imprecise. Unique to our model, imprecise information influences the pricing of an asset through its impact on its ICAPM betas. We show that information-quality risk has systematic and idiosyncratic components and that only the former, which is nondiversifiable, is priced. Investors demand a higher premium for holding an asset with a higher systematic information-quality risk. The market risk <b>premium</b> and hedge <b>portfolio</b> risk <b>premium</b> are boosted by mψµ and hψµ, which are mean of spreads of true fundamental returns and observed returns on securities in the market and in the hedge portfolio respectively.

From January 2006 to October        2009 forty “Proposal for fund portfolios” were produced each containing         writing on market condition and expectations plus portfolio recommendations.        Each time four portfolios consisting of six mutual funds was recommended,                    Fund Portfolio 30, 50, 70 and 100. Fund Portfolio 30 (FP 30) contained           30 % equity fund and 70 % fixed-income funds. By same reasoning FP 50           contains 50 / 50 equity- and fixed-income funds, FP 70, 70 % equity funds and         30 % fixed-income funds and FP 100 only equity funds.   Purpose:      The aim of this work is to evaluate these SEB Investment Strategy recommended       portfolios for private SEB Retail clients from January 2006 to December 2009.    Evaluation is done by comparing the performance of recommended portfolios       with portfolios produced by applying Vasicek´s Technique and simplified   optimization technique.   Method:     To allow work with Vasicek´s Technique {{in which we are}} dependent on a market        portfolio, I have created an Index which includes SEB Mutual Funds and their         share of the Index is determined from each fund´s total assets in relation to the    sum of the total assets under management of all funds inclusive in the Index.   Index consists of 40 mutual funds 2002 - 2007 and 37 mutual funds 2008         and 2009. The total supply of funds has been reduced to the above numbers by             the following criteria:   Clients must be able to invest in funds through conventional SEB Fund Account. No initiation fees or sales charges. Minimum historical Net Asset Value prices (NAV-prices) from 2 nd January 2002. Daily trading and at least 300 million SEK in assets under management.

40|$|My dissertation, {{consisting}} of three related essays, aims {{to understand the}} role of macroeconomic risks in the stock and bond markets. In the first chapter, I build a financial intermediary sector with a leverage constraint a la Gertler and Kiyotaki (2010) into an endowment economy with an independently and identically distributed consumption growth process and recursive preferences. I use a global method to solve the model, and show that accounting for occasionally binding constraint is important for quantifying the asset pricing implications. Quantitatively, the model generates a procyclical and persistent variation of price-dividend ratio, and a high and countercyclical equity premium. As a distinct prediction from the model, in the credit crunch, high TED spread, due to a liquidity premium, coincides with low stock price and high stock market volatility, a pattern I confirm in the data. In the second chapter, which is coauthored with Hengjie Ai and Mariano Croce, we model investment options as intangible capital in a production economy in which younger vintages of assets in place have lower exposure to aggregate productivity risk. In equilibrium, physical capital requires a substantially higher expected return than intangible capital. Quantitatively, our model rationalizes a significant share of the observed difference in the average return of book-to-market-sorted <b>portfolios</b> (value <b>premium).</b> Our economy also produces (1) a high premium of the aggregate stock market over the risk-free interest rate, (2) a low and smooth risk-free interest rate, and (3) key features of the consumption and investment dynamics in the U. S. data. In the third chapter, I study the joint determinants of stock and bond returns in Bansal and Yaron (2004) long-run risks model framework with regime shifts in consumption and inflation dynamics [...] in particular, the means, volatilities, and the correlation structure between consumption growth and inflation are regime-dependent. This general equilibrium framework can (1) generate time-varying and switching signs of stock and bond correlations, as well as switching signs of bond risk premium; (2) quantitatively reproduce various other salient empirical features in stock and bond markets, including time-varying equity and bond return premia, regime shifts in real and nominal yield curve, the violation of expectations hypothesis of bond returns. The model shows that term structure of interest rates and stock-bond correlation are intimately related to business cycles, while long-run risks play a more important role to account for high equity premium than business cycle risks.

We construct a model of firms'' FDI decisions, broadly in Dunning''s "eclectic theory" framework, using "real options" to emphasize economic uncertainty and country risk. Numerical results of the model take the form of "quality statistics" that uncover the underlying dynamics hidden in the aggregate data that is responsible for the low performance of recent empirical studies. We find that increasing levels of capital controls reduce the life-span of FDI investments at each level of country risk and foreign investors'' willingness towards risk sharing increases. We reveal a significant interaction between capital control and country risk, resulting in a nonlinear relationship between these and the volatility and volume statistics. We estimate a standard cross-sectional model that provides strong support for our theoretical findings.

D. thesis {{contains}} 3 {{essays in}} international finance {{with a focus}} on foreign exchange market from the perspectives of empirical asset pricing (Chapter 2 and Chapter 3), forecasting and market microstructure (Chapter 4). In Chapter 2, I derive the position-unwinding likelihood indicator for currency carry trade portfolios in the option pricing model, and show that it represents the systematic crash risk associated with global liquidity imbalances and also is able to price the cross-section of global currency, sovereign bond, and equity portfolios; I also explore the currency option-implied sovereign default risk in Merton’s framework, and link the sovereign CDS-implied credit risk premia to currency excess returns that it prices the cross section of currency carry, momentum, and volatility risk <b>premium</b> <b>portfolios.</b> In Chapter 3, I investigate the factor structure in currency market and identify three important properties of global currencies – overvalued (undervalued) currencies with respect to equilibrium exchange rates tend to be crash sensitive (insensitive) measured by copula lower tail dependence, relatively cheap (expensive) to hedge in terms of volatility risk premium, and exposed to high (low) speculative propensity gauged by skew risk premium. I further reveal that these three characteristics have rich asset pricing and asset allocation implications, e. g. striking crash-neutral and diversification benefits for portfolio optimization and risk management purposes. In Chapter 4, I examine the term structure of exchange rate predictability by return decomposition, incorporate common latent factors across a range of investment horizons into the exchange rate dynamics with a broad set of predictors, and handle both parameter uncertainty and model uncertainty. I demonstrate the time-varying term-structural effect and model disagreement effect of exchange rate determinants and the projections of predictive information over the term structure, and utilize the time-variation in the probability weighting from dynamic model averaging to identify the scapegoat drivers of customer order flows. I further comprehensively evaluate both statistical and economic significance of the model allowing for a full spectrum of currency investment management, and find that the model generates substantial performance fees...|$|R
40|$|In sharp {{contrast}} to the basic risk-return assumption of theoretical finance, the empirical evidence shows that distressed firms underperform non-distressed firms (e. g. Dichev, 1998; Agarwal and Taffler, 2008 b). Existing literature argues that a shareholder advantage effect (Garlappi and Yan, 2011), limits of arbitrage (Shleifer and Vishny, 1997) or gambling retail investor (Kumar, 2009) could drive the underperformance. Herein, I test these potential explanations and explore the drivers of distress risk. In order to do so, I require a clean measure of distress risk. Measures of distress risk have usually been accounting-based, market-based or hybrids using both information sources. I provide the first comprehensive study that employs a variety of performance tests on different prediction models. My tests are based on all UK non-financial firms listed in the Main market segment of the London Stock Exchange (LSE) between September 1985 and October 2010. It includes 22, 217 observations with 2, 428 unique firms of which 202 went bankrupt. I find that hybrid models clearly outperform the accounting-based z-score (Taffler, 1983) and the market-based model of Bharath and Shumway (2008) (BS). Hybrid models forecast bankruptcies more accurately and they subsume the bankruptcy related information of z-score and BS. While there is little to distinguish between the hybrids in forecasting accuracy, tests of differential misclassification costs show that the highest economic value is delivered by the most parsimonious hybrid model of Shumway (2001) (Shum). The forecasting accuracy between z-score and BS depends on the sample period while both carry complementary bankruptcy related information. My study provides confirmatory evidence on the puzzling negative distress risk premium. Moreover, my tests show that the distress risk premium is independent of the distress risk proxy (Shum, z-score or BS). Remarkably, z-score –the weakest bankruptcy prediction model - subsumes the return related information of Shum and BS in cross-sectional tests suggesting that it might not be distress risk per se that is priced. My results provide no evidence that the potential explanations in the existing literature are able to account for the distress puzzle. As such, I find no confirmation for the shareholder advantage effect. Although the characteristics of firms with high limits of arbitrage and gambling features are shared by distressed firms, tests provide no evidence for their pricing relevance or their impact on the distress risk premium. This is the first study that deconstructs the distress measures into their component parts to unravel the distress risk premium and shows that the profitability components of Shum and z-score drive the premium. The composite measure without the information carried by profitability is insignificant in the pricing tests. In time-series regressions, I show that the pricing information carried by a profitability factor is able to reduce the distress risk <b>premium.</b> <b>Portfolio</b> analysis identifies low distress risk-high profitability firms as the key driver of the mispricing. The distress anomaly is not driven by distress risk but by profitability. Another major contribution is the use of the three approaches to assess distress risk. Together with the full range of major performance measures, I provide the first comprehensive test of the competing approaches. This study has important implications for the future research agenda on both, how we measure distress risk and the pricing of distress risk.
