5000|$|From the Turonian {{to the end}} of the Campanian ages of the Late Cretaceous, Appalachia was {{separated}} from the rest of North America. As the Western Interior Seaway retreated in the Maastrichtian, Laramidia and Appalachia eventually connected. Because of this, its fauna was isolated, and developed very differently from the tyrannosaur, ceratopsian, pachycephalosaur and ankylosaur dominated fauna of the western part of North America, the geologist's [...] "Laramidia". Due to numerous undiscovered fossiliferous deposits and due the fact that half of Appalachia's fossil formations being destroyed by the Pleistocene ice age, little is known about Appalachia, with exception of plant life and the insects trapped in amber from New Jersey. Many of the various fossil formations not destroyed by the Pleistocene ice age still remain elusive to the field of <b>paleontological</b> <b>study.</b> In addition, due to a lack of interest in Appalachia, many fossils that have been found in Appalachia lie unstudied and remain in the inaccurate genera to which they were assigned in the days of E.D. Cope and O.C. Marsh. However, the area has seen a bit of a resurgence of interest due to several discoveries made in the past few years. As mentioned earlier, not much is known about Appalachia, but some fossil sites, such as the Navesink Formation, Ellisdale Fossil Site, Mooreville Chalk Formation, Demopolis Chalk Formation, Black Creek Group and the Niobrara Formation have given us a glimpse into this forgotten world of paleontology.|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{summarizes}} palynological and <b>paleontological</b> <b>study</b> of {{the middle}} part of the Cracow Sandstone Series which is divided into the Łaziska (Bolsovian) and the Libiąz Beds (Asturian). Samples {{were obtained from the}} borehole G 5 Dab nearby Jaworzno from both coal and non-coal sediments. Palynological study confirmed the stratigraphical gap between these two beds by observation of dissapearance of nine miospore taxons {{at the bottom of the}} Libiąz Beds (Torispora, Converrucosisporites, Schulzospora, Gillespieisporites, Schopfites, Convolutispora, Cristatisporites, Tripartites, Cingulizonates).

The sedimentation of the Łaziska coal seams is characterized by alternation of lycospore and densospore phases which confirmes alternation of the contrasting plant assamblages with a predominance of the arborescent lycopsids Lepidodendron and Lepidophloios and sub-arborescent lycopsid Omphalophloios. Arborescent lycopsids preferred planar (rheotrophic) mires.

40|$|The <b>paleontological</b> <b>study</b> on cave bear remains {{from the}} Grotta Sopra Fontana Marella (Campo dei Fiori massif, Varese, Italy) is here presented.

Cave bears from the oldest level (FM 4) had a peculiar mandible morphology and a smaller body size than cave bears from the uppermost levels (FM 1 and FM 2). We propose that this change in body size is related to a paleoclimatic trend from FM 4 towards a colder phase (FM 1 and FM 2), the latter corresponding to the last maximum expansion of glaciers in the Italian Alps. Morphometric analysis of bones and teeth allowed to determine minimum number of individuals, class ages and sex ratio for each cave bear fossil assemblage.  </p...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: The Gurpi {{section in}} northwestern Shiraz, faulted zagros range of southwestern Iran, {{contains}} {{one of the}} most complete Early Santonian to Danian sequences. The lack of a good fundamental <b>paleontological</b> <b>study</b> is a strong motivation for investigating calcareous nannofossils in southwestern Iran. The Gurpi Formation is mainly made up of shale and marl. As a result of this study, 23 genera and 46 species of nannofossils have been identified for the first time. This confirms the existence of biozones CC 14 -CC 26 and NP 1, which suggests the age of Early Santonian to Danian. All Early Santonian to Danian calcareous nannofossils biozones from CC 14 (equivalent to the Micula decussate zone) to NP 1 (equivalent to the Markalius inversus zone) are discussed. Also, the zonal subdivision of this section based on calcareous nannofossils is show continuity in KT boundary in northwest part of Shiraz. We can also learn about the predominant conditions of the studied sedimentary basin that are in fact a part of Neotethys basin with the existence of indexed species calcareous nannofossils that indicate warm climate and high depths of the basin in low latitudes.
