5|$|Some insects use <b>parthenogenesis,</b> {{a process}} in which the female can {{reproduce}} and give birth without having the eggs fertilized by a male. Many aphids undergo a form of <b>parthenogenesis,</b> called cyclical <b>parthenogenesis,</b> in which they alternate between one or many generations of asexual and sexual reproduction. In summer, aphids are generally female and parthenogenetic; in the autumn, males may be produced for sexual reproduction. Other insects produced by <b>parthenogenesis</b> are bees, wasps and ants, in which they spawn males. However, overall, most individuals are female, which are produced by fertilization. The males are haploid and the females are diploid. More rarely, some insects display hermaphroditism, in which a given individual has both male and female reproductive organs.|$|E
5|$|In 2007, a 9-year-old female blacktip shark at the Virginia Aquarium and Marine Science Center {{was found}} to be {{pregnant}} with a single near-term female pup, despite having never mated with a male. Genetic analysis confirmed that her offspring was the product of automictic <b>parthenogenesis,</b> a form of asexual reproduction in which an ovum merges with a polar body to form a zygote without fertilization. Along with an earlier case of <b>parthenogenesis</b> in the bonnethead (Sphyrna tiburo), this event suggests that asexual reproduction may be more widespread in sharks than previously thought.|$|E
5|$|Thrips are haplodiploid with haploid males (from unfertilised eggs, as in Hymenoptera) and diploid females {{capable of}} <b>parthenogenesis</b> (reproducing without fertilisation), many species using arrhenotoky, a few using thelytoky. The sex-determining {{bacterial}} endosymbiont Wolbachia {{is a factor}} that affects the reproductive mode. Several normally bisexual species have become established in the United States with only females present.|$|E
5|$|A {{conflict}} between the sexes of a species is seen in some species of ants with these reproducers apparently competing to produce offspring that are as closely related to them as possible. The most extreme form involves the production of clonal offspring. An extreme of sexual conflict is seen in Wasmannia auropunctata, where the queens produce diploid daughters by thelytokous <b>parthenogenesis</b> and males produce clones by a process whereby a diploid egg loses its maternal contribution to produce haploid males who are clones of the father.|$|E
5|$|There {{have been}} a number of {{documented}} cases in which a female shark who has not been in contact with a male has conceived a sharklet on her own through <b>parthenogenesis.</b> The details of this process are not well understood, but genetic fingerprinting showed that the sharklets had no paternal genetic contribution, ruling out sperm storage. The extent of this behavior in the wild is unknown, as is whether other species have this capability. Mammals are now the only major vertebrate group in which asexual reproduction has not been observed.|$|E
5|$|Miss Foster accelerates her plans, {{knowing that}} the Doctor will attempt to stop her. Throughout London, the Adipose begin to spawn and soon number several thousand. The Doctor and Donna prevent total {{emergency}} <b>parthenogenesis</b> occurring, which would have killed those who had taken the pill, and {{the remainder of the}} young Adipose make their way to Adipose Industries. The Adiposian First Family arrive in a spaceship and begin collecting their young. The Doctor tries to warn Miss Foster about her safety, but she disregards him and is killed when the Adipose drop her from their transport beam to her death, to cover their unsanctioned colonization efforts. The Doctor refrains from killing the young Adipose because they are children, to which Donna remarks that his previous companion Martha Jones made him more human.|$|E
5|$|Unlike {{in higher}} animals, where <b>parthenogenesis</b> is rare, asexual {{reproduction}} may occur in plants by several different mechanisms. The formation of stem tubers in potato is one example. Particularly in arctic or alpine habitats, where opportunities for fertilisation of flowers by animals are rare, plantlets or bulbs, may develop instead of flowers, replacing sexual reproduction with asexual reproduction and {{giving rise to}} clonal populations genetically identical to the parent. This {{is one of several}} types of apomixis that occur in plants. Apomixis can also happen in a seed, producing a seed that contains an embryo genetically identical to the parent.|$|E
5|$|Many {{species of}} chaetotonid gastrotrichs {{reproduce}} entirely by <b>parthenogenesis.</b> In these species, the male {{portions of the}} reproductive system are degenerate and non-functional, or, in many cases, entirely absent. Though the eggs have a diameter of less than 50 Âµm, they are still very large {{in comparison with the}} animals' size. Some species are capable of laying eggs that remain dormant during times of desiccation or low temperatures; these species, however, are also able to produce regular eggs, which hatch in one to four days, when environmental conditions are more favourable. The eggs of all gastrotrichs undergo direct development and hatch into miniature versions of the adult. The young typically reach sexual maturity in about three days. In the laboratory, Lepidodermella squamatum has lived for up to forty days, producing four or five eggs during the first ten days of life.|$|E
5|$|Other {{developmental}} and reproductive variations include haplodiploidy, polymorphism, paedomorphosis or peramorphosis, sexual dimorphism, <b>parthenogenesis</b> and more rarely hermaphroditism. In haplodiploidy, {{which is a}} type of sex-determination system, the offspring's sex is determined by the number of sets of chromosomes an individual receives. This system is typical in bees and wasps. Polymorphism is where a species may have different morphs or forms, as in the oblong winged katydid, which has four different varieties: green, pink and yellow or tan. Some insects may retain phenotypes that are normally only seen in juveniles; this is called paedomorphosis. In peramorphosis, an opposite sort of phenomenon, insects take on previously unseen traits after they have matured into adults. Many insects display sexual dimorphism, in which males and females have notably different appearances, such as the moth Orgyia recens as an exemplar of sexual dimorphism in insects.|$|E
5|$|The {{black bean}} aphid has both sexual and asexual generations in its life cycle. It also {{alternates}} hosts {{at different times}} of year. The primary host plants are woody shrubs, and eggs are laid on these by winged females in the autumn. The adults then die and the eggs overwinter. The aphids that hatch from these eggs in the spring are wingless females known as stem mothers. These are able to reproduce asexually, giving birth to live offspring, nymphs, through <b>parthenogenesis.</b> The lifespan of a parthenogenetic female is about 50 days and during this period, each can produce as many as 30 young. The offspring are also females and able to reproduce without mating, but further generations are usually winged forms. These migrate to their secondary host plants, completely different species that are typically herbaceous plants with soft, young growth.|$|E
5|$|Three {{possible}} {{mechanisms of}} relapse were proposed by Marchoux in 1926 (i) <b>parthenogenesis</b> of macrogametocytes: (ii) persistence of schizonts in small {{numbers in the}} blood where immunity inhibits multiplication, but later disappears and/or (iii) reactivation of an encysted body in the blood. James in 1931 proposed that sporozoites are carried to internal organs, where they enter reticuloendothelial cells and undergo a cycle of development, based on quinine's lack of activity on them. Huff and Bloom in 1935 demonstrated stages of avian malaria that transpire outside blood cells (exoerythrocytic). In 1945 Fairley et al. reported that inoculation of blood from a patient with P. vivax may fail to induce malaria, although the donor may subsequently exhibit the condition. Sporozoites disappeared from the blood stream within one hour and reappeared eight days later. This suggested the presence of forms that persist in tissues. Using mosquitoes rather than blood, in 1946 Shute described a similar phenomenon and proposed {{the existence of an}} 'x-body' or resting form. The following year Sapero proposed a link between relapse and a tissue stage not yet discovered. Garnham in 1947 described exoerythrocytic schizogony in Hepatocystis (Plasmodium) kochi. In the following year Shortt and Garnham described the liver stages of P. cynomolgi in monkeys. In the same year a human volunteer consented to receive a massive dose of infected sporozoites of P. vivax and undergo a liver biopsy three months later, thus allowing Shortt et al. to demonstrate the tissue stage. The tissue form of Plasmodium ovale was described in 1954 and that of P. malariae in 1960 in experimentally infected chimpanzees.|$|E
25|$|Facultative <b>parthenogenesis</b> is {{the term}} for when a female can produce {{offspring}} either sexually or via asexual reproduction. Facultative <b>parthenogenesis</b> is extremely rare in nature, {{with only a few}} examples of animal taxa capable of facultative <b>parthenogenesis.</b> One of the best known examples of taxa exhibiting facultative <b>parthenogenesis</b> are mayflies; presumably this is the default reproductive mode of all species in this insect order. Facultative <b>parthenogenesis</b> is believed to be a response to a lack of a viable male. A female may undergo facultative <b>parthenogenesis</b> if a male is absent from the habitat or if it is unable to produce viable offspring.|$|E
25|$|<b>Parthenogenesis</b> in insects {{can cover}} {{a wide range}} of mechanisms. The {{offspring}} produced by <b>parthenogenesis</b> may be of both sexes, only female (thelytoky, e.g. aphids and some hymenopterans) or only male (arrhenotoky, e.g. most hymenopterans). Both true <b>parthenogenesis</b> and pseudogamy (gynogenesis or sperm-dependent <b>parthenogenesis)</b> are known to occur. The egg cells, depending on the species may be produced without meiosis (apomictically) or by one of the several automictic mechanisms.|$|E
25|$|In 2012, facultative <b>parthenogenesis</b> was {{reported}} in wild vertebrates {{for the first time}} by US researchers amongst captured pregnant copperhead and cottonmouth female pit-vipers. The Komodo dragon, which normally reproduces sexually, has also been found able to reproduce asexually by <b>parthenogenesis.</b> A case has been documented of a Komodo dragon reproducing via sexual reproduction after a known parthenogenetic event, highlighting that these cases of <b>parthenogenesis</b> are reproductive accidents, rather than adaptive, facultative <b>parthenogenesis.</b>|$|E
25|$|Root-knot {{nematodes}} {{exhibit a}} range of reproductive modes, including sexuality (amphimixis), facultative sexuality, meiotic <b>parthenogenesis</b> (automixis) and mitotic <b>parthenogenesis</b> (apomixis).|$|E
25|$|At {{least two}} {{species in the}} genus Dugesia, flatworms in the Turbellaria {{sub-division}} of the phylum Platyhelminthes, include polyploid individuals that reproduce by <b>parthenogenesis.</b> This type of <b>parthenogenesis</b> requires mating, but the sperm does {{not contribute to the}} genetics of the offspring (the <b>parthenogenesis</b> is pseudogamous, alternatively referred to as gynogenetic). A complex cycle of matings between diploid sexual and polyploid parthenogenetic individuals produces new parthenogenetic lines.|$|E
25|$|The {{production}} of female offspring by <b>parthenogenesis</b> {{is referred to}} as thelytoky (e.g., aphids) while the {{production of}} males by <b>parthenogenesis</b> {{is referred to as}} arrhenotoky (e.g., bees). When unfertilized eggs develop into both males and females, the phenomenon is called deuterotoky.|$|E
25|$|The {{workers in}} five ant species and the queens in some ants {{are known to}} {{reproduce}} by <b>parthenogenesis.</b> In Cataglyphis cursor, a European formicine ant, the queens and workers can produce new queens by <b>parthenogenesis.</b> The workers are produced sexually.|$|E
25|$|However, when no male anacondas are {{available}} to provide offspring facultative <b>parthenogenesis</b> is possible. In August 2014 West Midlands Safari Park announced that on 12 August 2014 a female Green anaconda, which was being kept with another female anaconda, through <b>parthenogenesis</b> {{had given birth to}} three young.|$|E
25|$|Charles Bonnet discovers <b>parthenogenesis</b> {{by observing}} that female aphids could {{reproduce}} without fertilization.|$|E
25|$|In 1936, Gregory Goodwin Pincus {{reported}} successfully inducing <b>parthenogenesis</b> in a rabbit.|$|E
25|$|<b>Parthenogenesis</b> in turkeys {{appears to}} result from a {{conversion}} of haploid cells to diploid; most embryos produced in this way die early in development. Rarely, viable birds result from this process, and {{the rate at which}} this occurs in turkeys can be increased by selective breeding, however male turkeys produced from <b>parthenogenesis</b> exhibit smaller testes and reduced fertility.|$|E
25|$|On August 2, 2007, {{after much}} {{independent}} investigation, {{it was revealed}} that discredited South Korean scientist Hwang Woo-Suk unknowingly produced the first human embryos resulting from <b>parthenogenesis.</b> Initially, Hwang claimed he and his team had extracted stem cells from cloned human embryos, a result later found to be fabricated. Further examination of the chromosomes of these cells show indicators of <b>parthenogenesis</b> in those extracted stem cells, similar to those found in the mice created by Tokyo scientists in 2004. Although Hwang deceived the world about being the first to create artificially cloned human embryos, he did contribute a major breakthrough to stem cell research by creating human embryos using <b>parthenogenesis.</b> The truth was discovered in 2007, long after the embryos were created by him and his team in February 2004. This made Hwang the first, unknowingly, to successfully perform the process of <b>parthenogenesis</b> to create a human embryon and, ultimately, a human parthenogenetic stem cell line.|$|E
25|$|<b>Parthenogenesis</b> is seen {{to occur}} {{naturally}} in aphids, Daphnia, rotifers, nematodes and some other invertebrates, {{as well as in}} many plants. Among vertebrates, strict <b>parthenogenesis</b> is only known to occur in lizards, snakes, birds and sharks, with fish, amphibians and reptiles exhibiting various forms of gynogenesis and hybridogenesis (an incomplete form of <b>parthenogenesis).</b> The first all-female (unisexual) reproduction in vertebrates was described in the fish Poecilia formosa in 1932. Since then at least 50 species of unisexual vertebrate have been described, including at least 20 fish, 25 lizards, a single snake species, frogs, and salamanders. Other, usually sexual, species may occasionally reproduce parthenogenetically and Komodo dragons; the hammerhead and blacktip sharks are recent additions to the known list of spontaneous parthenogenetic vertebrates. As with all types of asexual reproduction, there are both costs (low genetic diversity and therefore susceptibility to adverse mutations that might occur) and benefits (reproduction without the need for a male) associated with <b>parthenogenesis.</b>|$|E
25|$|Workers {{and queens}} (both female) result from fertilized eggs, so have both {{a mother and}} a father. Arrhenotokous <b>parthenogenesis,</b> a {{modified}} form of <b>parthenogenesis,</b> controls sex differentiation. The sex allele is polymorphic, and so long as two different variants are present, a female bee results. If both sex alleles are identical, diploid drones are produced. Honey bees detect and destroy diploid drones after the eggs hatch.|$|E
25|$|The {{repercussions of}} <b>parthenogenesis</b> in sharks, which fails to {{increase}} the genetic diversity of the offspring, {{is a matter of}} concern for shark experts, taking into consideration conservation management strategies for this species, particularly in areas where there may be a shortage of males due to fishing or environmental pressures. Although <b>parthenogenesis</b> may help females who cannot find mates, it does reduce genetic diversity.|$|E
25|$|<b>Parthenogenesis</b> may be {{achieved}} through an artificial process as described below under the discussion of mammals.|$|E
25|$|Procambarus clarkii {{normally}} reproduces sexually, {{but recent}} research suggests {{it may also}} reproduce by <b>parthenogenesis.</b>|$|E
25|$|Asexual {{reproduction}} {{has been}} identified in squamates in six families of lizards and one snake. In some species of squamates, a population of females is able to produce a unisexual diploid clone of the mother. This form of asexual reproduction, called <b>parthenogenesis,</b> occurs in several species of gecko, and is particularly widespread in the teiids (especially Aspidocelis) and lacertids (Lacerta). In captivity, Komodo dragons (Varanidae) have reproduced by <b>parthenogenesis.</b>|$|E
25|$|<b>Parthenogenesis</b> is {{a natural}} form of {{reproduction}} in which growth and development of embryos occur without fertilisation. Thelytoky is a particular form of <b>parthenogenesis</b> in which {{the development of a}} female individual occurs from an unfertilised egg. Automixis is a form of thelytoky, but there are different kinds of automixis. The kind of automixis relevant here is one in which two haploid products from the same meiosis combine to form a diploid zygote.|$|E
25|$|Use of an {{electrical}} or chemical stimulus can produce {{the beginning of}} the process of <b>parthenogenesis</b> in the asexual development of viable offspring.|$|E
25|$|Obligate <b>parthenogenesis</b> is {{the process}} in which organisms {{exclusively}} reproduce through asexual means. Many species {{have been shown to}} transition to obligate <b>parthenogenesis</b> over evolutionary time. Among these species, one of the most well documented transitions to obligate <b>parthenogenesis</b> was found in almost all metazoan taxa, albeit through highly diverse mechanisms. These transitions often occur as a result of inbreeding or mutation within large populations. There are a number of documented species, specifically salamanders and geckos, that rely on obligate <b>parthenogenesis</b> as their major method of reproduction. As such, there are over 80 species of unisex reptiles (mostly lizards but including a single snake species), amphibians and fishes in nature for which males are no longer a part of the reproductive process. A female will produce an ovum with a full set (two sets of genes) provided solely by the mother. Thus, a male is not needed to provide sperm to fertilize the egg. This form of asexual reproduction is thought in some cases to be a serious threat to biodiversity for the subsequent lack of gene variation and potentially decreased fitness of the offspring.|$|E
25|$|Most insects {{reproduce}} via sexual reproduction, i.e. the egg {{is produced}} by the female, fertilised by the male and oviposited by the female. Eggs are usually deposited in a precise microhabitat {{on or near the}} required food. However, some adult females can reproduce without male input. This is known as <b>parthenogenesis</b> and in {{the most common type of}} <b>parthenogenesis</b> the offspring are essentially identical to the mother. This is most often seen in aphids and scale insects.|$|E
25|$|Some {{animals are}} also capable of asexual reproduction. This may take place through <b>parthenogenesis,</b> where fertile eggs are {{produced}} without mating, budding, or fragmentation.|$|E
25|$|Initially, M. smithii {{was thought}} to only {{reproduce}} asexually because no evidence of male individuals had been found. This led to M. smithii being recognized as the first fungus-growing ant species to reproduce via thelytokous <b>parthenogenesis,</b> where females, the workers and reproductive queens, are produced asexually. The cytogenetic mechanism of thelytoky is either apomixis (mitotic <b>parthenogenesis)</b> or automixis with central fusion and low recombination rates. Automixis with central fusion is the cytogenetic mechanism that was recorded in other asexual ant species.|$|E
25|$|There are {{no known}} cases of {{naturally}} occurring mammalian <b>parthenogenesis</b> in the wild. Parthenogenetic progeny of mammals would have two X chromosomes, and would therefore be female.|$|E
