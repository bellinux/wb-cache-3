To better stimulate, enhance, and support creativity, our research has explored the middle ground between the endpoints defined by binary choices to identify “sweet spots ” based on a careful trade-off analysis of specific goals, objectives, stakeholders, and socio-technical environments. This paper illustrates some of the major trade-offs related to design and creativity that we have explored in our research over the last ten years, including prescriptive and <b>permissive</b> <b>environments,</b> individual and social creativity, communities of practice and communities of interest, and consumer and active contributor cultures.

The main goal of the experiments is to evaluate the impact of varying memory capacities on the ability of agents to adapt to given subsistence environments and resource landscapes.

Variable memory capacity, however, does lead to diversification of agent behaviour patterns in a given environment. The results also suggest that more <b>permissive</b> <b>environments</b> allow agents with greater memory to show a greater diversity of behaviour than similar agents in more restrictive environments.

5000|$|He {{returned}} to Tokyo in 1931, where the same specializations {{found at the}} Tokyo University of the Arts governed artistic practice more broadly. Artists were categorized as either Western or Japanese painters, {{with a number of}} splinter groups arising from this major divide. Yamaguchi became associated with the group Nika-kai, or Second-Section Society. Formed in 1914, it opposed the official Japanese government salon, which was organized into three sections—Japanese-style painting, Western-style painting, and sculpture. Nika-kai artists protested not because of the divisions, but because of the associations they produced: Nika-kai did not advocate all Western-influenced painting, but rather an avant-garde dedication to experimentation and abstraction, and therefore came {{to be one of the}} most innovative movements in the history of modern Japanese painting. The group appealed to Yamaguchi, who on returning to Tokyo from Paris sought a more <b>permissive</b> <b>environment</b> in which to continue painting. During World War II and the Allied occupation of Japan, however, the development of avant-garde art in Japan waned to a point of nonexistence.By the mid-1950s, the avant-garde had reemerged and Yamaguchi found his mature style. He combined the two major postwar European painting trends—Art Informel, with its thick, impasto brushstrokes, and the monochrome, with its concern for purity in painting. This combination spawned an acute sensitivity to the color, texture, and materiality of painting and moved Yamaguchi far beyond the play of depth found in Cubism. His work began to focus almost exclusively on the flatness of the canvas, which made his work attractive to Western audiences, who had become accustomed to Minimalism and Post-painterly abstraction in the 1960s. His 1969 show at the Nihonbashi Gallery, New York, for example, combined Minimalism and Conceptual art in its exhibition of 15 red monochromes simply numbered 1 through 15 along with their dimensions.Yamaguchi's work was featured in the So Paulo Biennial (1955, 1963); Japan Pavilion, Venice Biennale (1956); Guggenheim International Award exhibition, Guggenheim Museum (1958); and The New Japanese Painting and Sculpture, Museum of Modern Art, New York (1964). He had solo shows at the Minami Gallery, Tokyo (1961, 1965, 1968, 1972, 1975), and at Nihonbashi Gallery, the first Japanese gallery established in New York (1963).|$|E
5000|$|Banerji {{has argued}} against {{the view that}} {{education}} and economic development are the solution to India’s female gendercide.She states that an analysis of census data indicates that the gender ratio is most imbalanced in the top 20% {{of the population of}} India by wealth and education and that the ratio is closest to the natural norm in the bottom 20% of the same scale. She asserts that increased access to education, health care, jobs and higher earnings lead to more abortions of unborn female children, drawing a direct correlation between the number of educational degrees a woman has and the likelihood that she will eliminate unborn daughters. Banerji also claims that high-income professional women are also victims of dowry violence and murder in India. Their education and wealth is no protection, because they are unable to fight off the family and cultural pressures on them to remain in the marriage, regardless of the violence they are subjected to. Banerji contends that it is not economics or education, but rather a cultural misogyny that is the prime factor in India’s female gendercide. She says this is most evident in how culture specific crimes like dowry murders and ‘honour' killings hound expatriate Indian women too, and sex-selected abortion is so prevalent, that the Indian communities in certain western countries like the United States, the United Kingdom, Canada, and Norway too have sex ratios that are abnormally skewed against females. Banerji asserts that gendercide needs to be recognised as a gender based hate crime against women, what Diana Russell has termed as ‘Femicide,’ and be dealt with {{in the same manner as}} other hate crimes based on race, religion or ethnicity.. She explains that this lethal hatred of females is rooted in India’s history, religions and traditions, which over the centuries have created a socially <b>permissive</b> <b>environment</b> for extreme and deadly violence against females. She calls this “the acculturation of female homicide." [...] She says,“terms like sati, bride-burning, dowry death, doodh-peeti, kuri-mar, and jauhar…each a method of female homicide that was still is widely practised, widely accepted, and culturally-specific to India... When a practice acquires a name in a society, it becomes acceptable at the subconscious level of that community's collective thinking. Its premise becomes sacrosanct, and the lines between crime and culture, and what is permissible and reprehensible, become blurred. It is this deep, historically-rooted acculturation of female homicide that is sustaining female genocide in India.” ...|$|E

Poly(lactide-co-glycolide) bridges were fabricated by a gas foaming/particulate leaching process. Channels within the bridge had diameters of 150 or 250 [*]μm, and {{the main body of the}} bridge was highly porous with a controllable pore size. Upon implantation in a rat spinal cord hemisection site, cells infiltrated into the bridge pores and channels, with the pore size influencing the rate of infiltration.

The channels of the bridge were completely infiltrated with cells, which had aligned axially, and consisted primarily of fibroblasts, S- 100 β-positive cells, and endothelial cells. Reactive astrocytes were observed primarily outside of the bridge, and staining for chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans was decreased in the region surrounding the bridge relative to studies without bridges.

40|$|Program/Poster no. : 228. 23 /C 53 Until {{recently}} functional {{recovery of}} damaged CNS was an unattainable goal and nanotechnology was an invisible science. As in life {{there are no}} magic bullets, but a well planned treatment spaced over time may bring about functional return in the CNS. The Four P’s of CNS regeneration is a new framework for approaching CNS injury. The four components are: Preserve, Permit, Promote and Plasticity. The determining factor in functional recovery was {{once thought to be}} the amount of re-innervation. However, it is now known that the level of recovery is determined not only by the number of axons but also the local density of their connections as well as the rehabilitation work done to drive reinnervation and refinement through training. There are four distinct issues {{that need to be addressed}} in order for successful CNS regeneration to occur: 1. Preserve - How can neurons with damaged axons be kept alive long enough to regrow and obtain functional regeneration? 2. Permit - How can a <b>permissive</b> <b>environment</b> be created that will allow axons to grow through the site of the lesion? Using the mammalian visual system as a model, we report that a designed self-assembling peptide nanofiber scaffold in combination with ABC creates a <b>permissive</b> <b>environment</b> not only for axons to regenerate through the site of an acute injury, but also to knit the brain tissue together in both young and adult animals. 3.
