5|$|Planet Nine modifies {{the orbits}} of extreme trans-Neptunian objects via a {{combination}} of secular and resonant dynamics. The secular dynamics acts on very long timescales and causes {{the distance of the}} perihelia of anti-aligned objects to rise and fall while the directions of their perihelia oscillate. The resonant dynamics acts on shorter timescales and provides <b>phase</b> <b>protection,</b> maintaining the stability of the objects by preventing close approaches. The inclination of Planet Nine's orbit weakens this protection, resulting in a chaotic variation of semi-major axes as objects hop between resonances. The orbital poles of the objects circle that of the Solar System's Laplace plane, which is bent toward the plane of Planet Nine's orbit, causing their poles to be clustered toward one side.|$|E
5|$|The 2:3 {{resonance}} {{between the}} two bodies is highly stable, and is preserved over millions of years. This prevents their orbits from changing relative to one another, and so the two bodies can never pass near each other. Even if Pluto's orbit were not inclined, the two bodies could never collide. The long term stability of the mean-motion resonance is due to <b>phase</b> <b>protection.</b> If Pluto's period is slightly shorter than 3/2 of Neptune its orbit relative to Neptune will drift, causing it to make closer approaches behind Neptune's orbit. The strong gravitational pull {{between the two}} causes angular momentum {{to be transferred to}} Pluto, at Neptune's expense. This moves Pluto into a slightly larger orbit, where it travels slightly more slowly, according to Kepler's third law. After many such repetitions, Pluto is sufficiently slowed, and Neptune sufficiently sped up, that Pluto orbit relative to Neptune drifts in the opposite direction until the process is reversed. The whole process takes about 20,000 years to complete.|$|E
500|$|In {{a system}} where Planet Nine and the eTNOs orbit in {{the plane of the}} other planets the orbits of {{resonant}} objects are well behaved. Extreme trans-Neptunian objects that are captured in strong resonances with Planet Nine can remain in them for the lifetime of the Solar System. At large semi-major axes, beyond a 3:1 resonance with Planet Nine, most of these objects will be in anti-aligned orbits. At smaller semi-major axes <b>phase</b> <b>protection</b> can allow the perihelia of the orbits of an increasing number of objects to circulate due to their secular dynamics without being ejected, reducing the fraction of objects that are anti-aligned.|$|E
40|$|The thesis {{reports the}} results of {{comprehensive}} studies carried out to explore the impact of midpoint FACTS Controllers (STATCOM and SVC) on the generator distance <b>phase</b> backup <b>protection</b> {{in order to identify}} important issues that protection engineers need to consider when designing and setting a generator protection system. In addition, practical, feasible and simple solutions to mitigate the adverse impact of midpoint FACTS Controllers on the generator distance <b>phase</b> backup <b>protection</b> are explored. 	The results of these studies show that midpoint FACTS Controllers have an adverse effect on the generator distance <b>phase</b> backup <b>protection.</b> This adverse effect, which can be in the form of underreach, overreach or a time delay, varies according to the fault type, fault location and generator loading. Moreover, it has been found that the adverse effect of the midpoint FACTS Controllers extends to affect the coordination between the generator distance <b>phase</b> backup <b>protection</b> and the generator steady-state overexcited capability limit. 	The Support Vector Machines classification technique is proposed as a replacement for the existing generator distance <b>phase</b> backup <b>protection</b> relay in order to alleviate potential problems. It has been demonstrated that this technique is a very promising solution, as it is fast, reliable and has a high performance efficiency. This will result in enhancing the coordination between the generator <b>phase</b> backup <b>protection</b> and the generator steady-state overexcited capability limit in the presence of midpoint FACTS Controllers. 	The thesis also presents {{the results of}} investigations carried out to explore the impact of the generator distance <b>phase</b> backup <b>protection</b> relay on the generator overexcitation thermal capability. The results of these investigations reveal that with the relay settings according to the current standards, the generator is over-protected and the generator distance <b>phase</b> backup <b>protection</b> relay restricts the generator overexcitation thermal capability during system disturbances. This restriction does not allow the supply of the maximum reactive power of the generating unit during such events. The restriction on the generator overexcitation thermal capability caused by the generator distance <b>phase</b> backup <b>protection</b> relay highlights the necessity to revise the relay settings. The proposed solution in this thesis is to reduce the generator distance <b>phase</b> backup <b>protection</b> relay reach in order to provide secure performance during system disturbances...|$|R

500|$|For {{a system}} where the orbits of Planet Nine and the objects are {{inclined}} the resonant dynamics is more complex, combining extended periods of stable resonances with periods of chaotic diffusion of their semi-major axes. The distance of the closest approaches varies with the inclinations and orientations of the orbits, in some cases weakening the <b>phase</b> <b>protection</b> and allowing close encounters. The close encounters can then alter the object's orbit, producing stochastic jumps in its semi-major axis as it hops between resonances, including higher order resonances. This results in a chaotic diffusion of an object's semi-major axis until it is captured in a new stable resonance and the secular evolution of its orbit removes it from the chaotic region near its boundary.|$|E
500|$|The <b>phase</b> <b>protection</b> of Planet Nine's {{resonances}} also stabilizes {{the orbits}} of objects that interact with Neptune, either through its resonances that can affect orbits with semi-major axis as large as 350 AU, for example or by close encounters for objects with low perihelia like [...] and [...] Instead of being ejected following a series of encounters these objects can hop between resonances with Planet Nine and evolve into orbits no longer interacting with Neptune. A shift {{in the position of}} Planet Nine in simulations from the location favored by an analysis of Cassini data to a position near aphelion has been shown to increase the stability of some of the observed objects, possibly due to this shifting the phases of their orbits to a stable range.|$|E
50|$|Hervé Beust numerically {{calculated}} the Hamiltonian describing the secular dynamics of objects perturbed by Planet Nine. Plots of eccentricity vs. longitude of perihelion using these results formed closed curves, or libration islands for aligned and anti-aligned objects. These resemble the plots of Batygin and Brown's original paper {{that showed the}} evolution of the orbital elements of ETNOs in simulations under the influence of Planet Nine. Beust also produced similar plots for objects in resonance with a Planet Nine at a semi-major axis of 665 AU, for example Sedna in a 3:2 resonance, as proposed by Malhotra, Volk and Wang. The libration islands in some of these cases included locations other than alignment or anti-alignment. Beust notes that while the <b>phase</b> <b>protection</b> of resonant objects provides additional protection, bodies in the anti-aligned population need not be in resonance with Planet Nine to remain in long-term stable orbits.|$|E

40|$|The {{need for}} clean, {{renewable}} energy {{has resulted in}} new mandates to augment, {{and in some cases}} replace conventional, fossil based generation with renewable generation resources. Wind generation is among those resources that have {{been at the center of}} attention. These resources are environmentally friendly, renewable, and they do not produce green-house gases. Therefore, there has been a significant growth in the integration of wind power into power systems networks in recent years. This structural change in power systems results, however, in new concerns regarding the reliable and secure operation of the power system with high penetration of wind energy conversion systems. This thesis investigates the impact of large doubly-fed induction generator- and full- frequency converter-based wind farms on the performance of generator distance <b>phase</b> backup <b>protection</b> (Relay (21)) and the generator capability curves. In this context, comprehensive studies are conducted on a sample power system incorporating large DFIG- and FFC-based wind farms tapped to the transmission system. The results of these studies which provide an in-depth assessment of Relay (21) performance in the presence of this type of wind energy conversion systems show that a wind farm tapped to a transmission line has an adverse effect on the distance <b>phase</b> backup <b>protection</b> of a nearby generator. The severity of such an impact varies according to the fault type and its location. Moreover, the adverse effect of the wind farms on Relay (21) performance extends to affect the coordination between generator distance <b>phase</b> backup <b>protection</b> and the generator overexcited capability limits. Such an impact varies also according to the fault type, fault location and generator loading.

50|$|Upon {{running the}} simulations, Batygin and Brown {{found that their}} {{hypothetical}} planet produced a number of effects on the orbits of distant minor planets, {{some of which were}} later confirmed by observation. The simulations showed that planetesimal swarms could be sculpted into collinear groups of spatially confined orbits by Planet Nine if it is substantially more massive than Earth and on a highly eccentric orbit. The confined orbits would cluster in a configuration where the long axes of their orbits are anti-aligned with respect to Planet Nine, signalling that the dynamical mechanism at play is resonant in nature. This mechanism, known as <b>phase</b> <b>protection,</b> prevents the trans-Neptunian objects trapped in mean-motion resonance from having close encounters with Planet Nine, and keeps them aligned. The resonances include high-order resonances, for example 27:17, and are interconnected, yielding an orbital evolution that is fundamentally chaotic, causing their semi-major axes to vary unpredictably on million-year timescales. The simulations also revealed that Planet Nine raises the perihelia of large semi-major axis trans-Neptunian objects producing Sedna-like orbits. This effect is temporary, however, in half a billion years Sedna will be a more typical trans-Neptunian object while other scattered disk objects that have large semi-major axis orbits could be in Sedna-like orbits.|$|E

The number of macrophages also increased at 2 to 21 days after vaccination and reached its maximum on day 14.

40|$|Traditionally, the {{effectiveness}} of a <b>phase</b> overcurrent <b>protection</b> philosophy has been assessed by only considering a fault level versus protection operating time graph (only selectivity). In this research, an improved method was created to evaluate different <b>phase</b> overcurrent <b>protection</b> philosophies for medium-voltage feeders. A focus was placed on reliability, sensitivity, selectivity, speed of operation, performance and minimising risk. The hypothesis stated {{that it is possible to}} develop a method that allows for the evaluation of {{the effectiveness}} of <b>phase</b> overcurrent <b>protection.</b> To test this hypothesis, an application was created that allows for the analysis of an overcurrent protection philosophy. This application made provision for changes in source impedance, evaluation of protection backup contingencies, different conductor types, user-definable protection equipment, the placement of protection equipment, user-definable protection settings, primary plant equipment damage information, user-definable safety margins and source transformer protection information. The application provides graphs that allow the user to evaluate the protection philosophy in terms of the following criteria:  The protection operating time at specific positions in the network. The PU sensitivity of the feeder-installed protection equipment.  The PU sensitivity of the source transformer protection (backup function).  The let-through energy and associated equipment damage criteria.  The energy-area over the analysed path.  To classify the busbar voltage dip.  To determine the position of the fault on the analysed path for the associated busbar voltage dip.  To quantify the occurrence of a specific voltage dip category on the analysed path. The graphs that were generated by the application allowed for the analysis and optimisation of the applied protection settings. This optimisation includes determining operating time, operating curve selection and the number of auto-reclose attempts. It is possible to determine the preferred protection philosophy using the application. The application does not prescribe how settings are to be calculated, or the placement of the devices; it evaluates if the applied philosophy is protecting the feeder and how well it is protecting it.

40|$|The {{relationship}} between physical characteristics and lipid oxidation was studied in model liquid and freeze-dried emulsions. ^ A {{first part of}} the study involved the use of liquid emulsions consisting of linoleic acid, phosphate buffer, Tween- 20 and sucrose. Iron sulfate and ascorbic acid were added to accelerate oxidation. The effect of variation in the system composition on oxidative behavior was investigated. Oxidation was influenced by the relative concentration of oil and emulsifier and their partition between different phases. When an excess of surfactant was present in the water <b>phase,</b> <b>protection</b> from oxidation was observed. Tween- 20 competed with linoleic acid for catalysts and oxygen, and also, when in sufficient amount, provided a more compact coating of the interface. This prevented the contact between catalysts and oil. In the presence of sucrose, the increase in viscosity was expected to reduce oxidation. Although some protection was noticed, it did not correlated with the increase in sugar concentration. A protective action of sucrose other than viscosity, such as scavenging radicals and hydroperoxydes and/or quenching metals, was probably prevalent in this case. ^ In the freeze-dried emulsions, maltodextrin and sucrose were added in equal amounts to provide a matrix.

40|$|The {{long-term}} {{stability of}} the evolution of two-planet systems is considered by using the general three body problem (GTBP). Our study is focused on the stability of systems with adjacent orbits when {{at least one of them}} is highly eccentric. In these cases, in order for close encounters, which destabilize the planetary systems, to be avoided, <b>phase</b> <b>protection</b> mechanisms should be considered. Additionally, since the GTBP is a non-integrable system, chaos may also cause the destabilization of the system after a long time interval. By computing dynamical maps, based on Fast Lyapunov Indicator, we reveal regions in phase space with stable orbits even for very high eccentricities (e> 0. 5). Such regions are present in mean motion resonances (MMR). We can determine the position of the exact MMR through the computation of families of periodic orbits in a rotating frame. Elliptic periodic orbits are associated with the presence of apsidal corotation resonances (ACR). When such solutions are stable, they are associated with neighbouring domains of initial conditions that provide long-term stability. We apply our methodology so that the evolution of planetary systems of highly eccentric orbits is assigned to the existence of such stable domains. Particularly, we study the orbital evolution of the extrasolar systems HD 82943, HD 3651, HD 7449, HD 89744 and HD 102272 and discuss the consistency between the orbital elements provided by the observations and the dynamical stability.

40|$|Renewable energy {{technologies}} are clean {{sources of energy}} that have a lower environmental impact than conventional {{energy technologies}}. Among all the renewable energy sources, wind energy is clean and plentiful compared to nonrenewable energy sources like fossil fuels and cost-effective compared to other renewable energy sources such as nuclear. Therefore, the potential for wind energy is immense. Nowadays, wind farms are increasingly employed in power systems {{in order to meet}} the growing demand of energy as well as the growing environmental awareness. Grid integration of large capacity of wind energy requires, however, new approaches for system operation, control, dynamic enhancement and protection. This thesis reports the results of digital time-domain simulation studies that are carried out to investigate the effect of Doubly-Fed Induction Generator (DFIG) -based wind farms on the performance of generator distance <b>phase</b> backup <b>protection</b> element (Relay (21)) in order to identify important issues that protection engineers need to consider when designing and setting a generator protection system. Such investigation is achieved through incorporating a large DFIG-based wind farm in a study system that inspired from an actual power system. The incorporation takes place under different Relay (21) zone settings. In this context, comparative studies between the relay performance with and without the presence of the DFIG-based wind farm during different faults are presented. The effects of fault location, fault type, generator loading, power flows in the transmission lines in conjunction with wind farm rating and location are also investigated.

40|$|In {{previous}} studies {{to determine whether}} chronic opiate administration might negatively feedback upon endogenous opioid systems in the CNS, investigators found no changes in steady-state concentrations of opioid peptides following morphine pelleting. However, since only steady-state levels were measured, it was still not clear whether morphine treatment altered the release and/or biosynthesis of opioid-containing neurons. The goal {{of the present study}} was to assess the effects of chronic morphine pelleting on the dynamics of [beta]-endorphin ([beta]E) biosynthesis in rats. Hence, at several times during a 7 -day morphine treatment, concentrations of total [beta]E-immunoreactivity (-ir), as well as chromatographically sieved forms of [beta]E, were determined by RIA, and mRNA levels of pro-opiomelanocortin (POMC) were measured by a solution <b>phase</b> <b>protection</b> assay using a mouse or rat POMC 32 P-labelled riboprobe. Concentrations of total [beta]E-ir or different forms of [beta]E-ir peptides (i. e. [beta]-lipotropin, [beta]E 1 - 31, or [beta]E 1 - 27 /[beta]E 1 - 26) in the hypothalamus or midbrain following either 1 or 7 days of treatment were similar in morphine- and placebo-pelleted animals. However, a significant increase in total hypothalamic [beta]E-ir was observed following 3 days of morphine pelleting; chromatographic analyses indicated that this was primarily due to a selective increase in the opiate inactive forms of [beta]E, i. e. [beta]E 1 - 27 /[beta]E 1 - 26. After 7 days of pelleting, morphine-treated animals tended to have lower POMC mRNA levels than those of placebo controls (20 to 50 % decrease in different studies). The accumulation of hypothalamic [beta]E-ir at 3 days, and the apparent decline in POMC mRNA levels at 7 days, lend support to the hypothesis that morphine negatively feeds back upon POMC neurons in the brain by inhibiting [beta]E release and biosynthesis...|$|E

The vaginal proteomes of 50 Rwandan women at high HIV risk, grouped into four VMB groups (based on 16 S rDNA microarray results), were investigated by mass spectrometry using cervicovaginal lavage (CVL) samples. Only samples with positive 16 S results for L. iners and/or L. crispatus within each group were included in subsequent comparative protein analyses: Lactobacillus crispatus-dominated VMB cluster (with 16 S-proven L. iners (ni) = 0, and with 16 S-proven L. crispatus (nc) = 5), L. iners-dominated VMB cluster (ni = 11, nc = 4), moderate dysbiosis (ni = 12, nc = 2); and severe dysbiosis (ni = 8, nc = 2). The relative abundances of proteins that were considered specific for L. iners and L. crispatus were compared among VMB groups. Forty Lactobacillus proteins were identified of which 7 were specific for L. iners and 11 for L. crispatus. The relative abundances of L. iners DNA starvation/stationary <b>phase</b> <b>protection</b> protein (DPS), and the glycolysis enzymes glyceraldehyde- 3 -phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) and glucose- 6 -phosphate isomerase (GPI), were significantly decreased in women with L. iners-containing dysbiosis compared to women with a L. iners-dominated VMB, independent of vaginal pH and L. iners abundance. Furthermore, L. iners DPS, GAPDH, GPI, and fructose-bisphosphate aldolase (ALDO) were significantly negatively associated with vaginal pH. Glycolysis enzymes of L. crispatus showed a similar negative, but nonsignificant, trend related to dysbiosis. Most identified Lactobacillus proteins had conserved intracellular functions, but their high abundance in CVL supernatant might imply an additional extracellular (moonlighting) role.

40|$|BackgroundCurrent {{data suggest}} microembolization {{to the brain}} may result in {{long-term}} cognitive dysfunction {{despite the absence of}} immediate clinically obvious cerebrovascular events. We reviewed a series of patients treated electively with carotid endarterectomy (CEA), carotid artery stenting (CAS) with distal filters, and carotid stenting with flow reversal (FRS) monitored continuously with transcranial Doppler scan (TCD) during the procedure to detect microembolization rates. MethodsTCD insonation of the M 1 segment of the middle cerebral artery was conducted during 42 procedures (15 CEA, 20 CAS, and 7 FRS) in 41 patients seen at an academic center. One patient had staged bilateral CEA. Ipsilateral microembolic signals (MESs) were divided into three phases: preprotection phase (until internal carotid artery [ICA] cross-shunted or clamped if no shunt was used, filter deployed, or flow reversal established), <b>protection</b> <b>phase</b> (until clamp/shunt was removed, filter removed, or antegrade flow re-established), and postprotection phase (after clamp/shunt was removed, filter removed, or antegrade flow re-established). Descriptive statistics are reported as mean ± SE for continuous variables and N (%) for categorical variables. Differences in ipsilateral emboli counts based on cerebral protection strategy were assessed using nonparametric methods. ResultsTCD insonation and procedural success were obtained in 33 procedures (79 %; 14 CEA, 14 CAS, and 5 FRS). Highest ipsilateral MESs were observed for CAS (319. 3 ± 110. 3), followed by FRS (184. 2 ± 110. 5), and CEA (15. 3 ± 22. 0). Pairwise comparisons revealed significantly higher ipsilateral MESs with both FRS and CAS when compared to CEA (P =. 007 for FRS and P <. 001 for CAS vs CEA, respectively), whereas the difference in MESs between FRS and CAS was not significant (P =. 053). Periods of maximum embolization were postprotection <b>phase</b> for CEA, <b>protection</b> <b>phase</b> for CAS, and preprotection phase for FRS. Preprotection MESs were frequently observed during both CAS and FRS (20. 4 % and 63. 3 % of total MESs across all phases, respectively), and the primary difference between these two methods seemed to be related to lower MESs during the <b>protection</b> <b>phase</b> with FRS. ConclusionCEA is associated with lower rates of microembolization compared with carotid stenting. Flow reversal may represent a procedural modification with potential to reduce microembolization during carotid stenting; further investigation is warranted to determine the relationship between cerebral protection strategies and outcomes associated with carotid stenting...|$|R
