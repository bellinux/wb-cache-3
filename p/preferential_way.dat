40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to evaluate the effects and interactions of various factors on the simultaneous accumulation of cadmium and mercury contaminants. Two chemical forms of mercury (HgCl 2 and CH 3 HgCl) were used in conjunction with inorganic cadmium (as CdCl 2). The effects of direct and trophic modes of accumulation were investigated. Daphnids (Daphnia magna) were exposed for 5 days to cadmium (CdCl 2) and mercury (HgCl 2 or CH 3 HgCl) in different com-binations and concentrations. Exposure was provided either directly via water, or indirectly by providing contaminated algae (Chlorella vulgaris) as a food source. As it is often the case for aquatic organisms, methylmercury was found to be the form of mercury most efficiently accumulated by D. magna. The way of exposure to mercury was also a determinant, with the results depending on the chemical form used. Therefore, even though the <b>preferential</b> <b>way</b> of inorganic mercury accumulation was through the water, the <b>preferential</b> <b>way</b> for D. magna contaminated with methylmercury was through contaminated algae. However, accumulation of Cadmium was not significantly affected by the exposure way. Both cadmium and mercury were able to inhibit each other accumulation.

40|$|AbstractIt {{is known}} that grain {{boundaries}} are <b>preferential</b> <b>ways</b> to enhance diffusion during thermo-chemical treatments like nitriding. When a component is gas nitrided, its microstructure (grain boundaries’ orientation) may prevent diffusion of nitrogen in one direction, and enhance it along another one. Surface mechanical properties reflect the chemical anisotropy and components can be discarded after thermo-chemical treatments. In present work, samples of pure iron (Fe - ARMCO) and AISI 304 stainless steel have been rolled to a different thickness reduction to impart different anisotropy ratios. Rolling process has been conducted at room temperature to avoid recovery or recrystallization of the microstructure. Samples have then been gas nitrided at 520 °C. Samples have been characterised with different techniques after the thermo-chemical treatment. Microstructure and crystal orientation have been investigated by optical and scanning electron microscopy (equipped with EBSD system).

A surface energy of approximately 500 ergs/sq cm for the particles is found by analyzing the critical partial pressure vs temperature using classical nucleation theory.

However, as this paper demonstrates, this method faces increasing computational difficulty when the residual demand (i. e., original demand minus variable renewables) in a power system sinks to relatively low values. Hence, a new unit commitment method is developed to specifically solve problems with low residual demand. The algorithm is set up based on an enhanced priority list of power plants (EPL). Plants are activated according to this list, while schedules are adapted to respect technical restrictions as minimum up and down times, and minimum operating points (particularly important in a low residual demand setting). The developed EPL algorithm is compared to a MILP set up, first on a benchmark system and second on a low residual demand case. Results are compared in terms of output and computational effort. Performance of the EPL algorithm is very satisfying (both in terms of optimality and calculation speed), thereby demonstrating its usefulness for real-life simulation and policy analysis, or, e. g., {{to be used in}} combination with MILP solvers to provide a starting solution. status: publishe...|$|E

MethodsCharge diversity of serum and urinary IgG molecules in patients with various renal diseases (N = 12) and premature neonates (N = 3) were analyzed by isoelectric focusing and Immunoblotting. ResultsIn patients with glomerular diseases, urinary IgG was solely composed of neutral and anionic IgG, whereas that of the cationic part (isoelectric point > 8) was not observed. By contrast, in patients with proximal tubular diseases (Dent's disease and idiopathic Fanconi syndrome), the proportion of the cationic IgG was similar to that of serum IgG.

Although active filaments usually show a sigmoid shape and a twisted configuration before and during their eruption, it is unclear which mechanism leads to these topologies. In order to provide an observational contribution to clarify these issues, we describe a filament evolution whose characteristics seem to be directly linked to the magnetic helicity transport in corona. Methods. We applied different methods to determine the helicity sign and the chirality of the filament magnetic field. We also computed the magnetic helicity transport rate at the filament footpoints. Results. All the observational signatures provided information on the positive helicity and sinistral chirality of the flux rope containing the filament material: its forward S shape, the orientation of its barbs, the bright and dark threads at 195 Å. Moreover, the magnetic helicity transport rate at the filament footpoints showed a clear accumulation of positive helicity. Conclusions. The study of this event showed a correspondence between several signatures of the sinistral chirality of the filament and several evidences of the positive magnetic helicity of the filament magnetic field.

40|$|The Venice Lagoon {{mainland}} {{is affected}} by salt water contamination in coastal and circum-lagoonal aquifers due to the close vicinity of both the sea and lagoon. The territory, characterized lithologically by alternating layers of silt, clay and sand which have marine, continental and/or marsh origins, is characterized by several critical conditions. These include the existence of paleorivers, lagoonal paleochannels, and rivers which are artificially suspended above the surrounding land by dikes. All of these conditions contribute {{to an increase in}} groundwater salinization. Areas with high permeability seem to constitute a <b>preferential</b> <b>way</b> of movement for salt water from the sea or lagoon towards the mainland. Old fossil water seems to be able to reach the surface and contribute to an increase in the process of salt pollution. In fact, during the 1970 s, several studies had detected, throughout the territory, the existence of a deep salt water aquifer storing fossil saline water. This aquifer lies at a depth of about 300 - 450 m {{in the southern part of}} the study area and of more than 600 m in the northern part of the Venice mainland. Salt water contamination of subsoil could cause ground salinization and, consequently, desertification of the area, with great economical consequences. These include damaging the large agricultural development of the territory as well as having adverse impacts on the tourist industry. The combined use of adequately validated geophysical and geochemical tools confers a multidisciplinary character to the research and allows for the definition of the phenomenon’s superficial extension. Geophysical analysis based on Vertical Electrical Sounding (VES) and conductivity logs have been performed together with water table measurements and geochemical analysis on samples collected from selected wells. Moreover, a critical review of old geophysical data allowed for the verification of possible saline contamination changes in time. Interesting results have been obtained within the northern sector of the Venice lagoon mainland, specifically within territory of Jesolo. In this case, considering the influence of the Piave and Sile rivers and the presence of a coastal sand dune, it is possible to create a map of salt water contamination to evaluate the agricultural use of superficial water. Therefore, the aim of this research is to define the effective origin of salt water found in the aquifers of the northern lagoon mainland, its distribution, extension and its <b>preferential</b> <b>way</b> of movement within the territory.

Despite the cosmopolitan nature of body size clines {{in more than one}} Drosophila species, the actual selective mechanisms controlling the genetic basis of body size variation are not fully understood. In particular, {{it is not clear what}} the selective value of cell size and cell area variation exactly is. In the present work we determined variation in viability, developmental time and larval competitive ability in response to crowding at two temperatures after artificial selection for reduced cell area, cell number and wing area in four different natural populations of D. melanogaster. Results No correlated effect of selection on viability or developmental time was observed among all selected populations. An increase in competitive ability in one thermal environment (18 °C) under high larval crowding was observed as a correlated response to artificial selection for cell size. Conclusion Viability and developmental time are not affected by selection for the cellular component of body size, suggesting that these traits only depend on the contingent genetic makeup of a population. The higher larval competitive ability shown by populations selected for reduced cell area seems to confirm the hypothesis that cell area mediated changes have a relationship with fitness, and might be the <b>preferential</b> <b>way</b> to change body size under specific circumstances. </p...|$|E

These agents cause stalled and collapsed replication forks and create double-strand breaks effectively in the absence of repair mechanisms, resulting in arrest of the cell cycle and induction of cell death. However, recent studies have shown failure of these chemotherapeutic agents due to emerging drug resistance. In this study, we developed a stochastic model of BRCA-associated cancer progression in which there are four cancer populations: those with (i) functional BRCA, (ii) dysfunctional BRCA, (iii) functional BRCA and a growth advantage, and (iv) dysfunctional BRCA and a growth advantage. These four cancer populations expand from one cancer cell with normal repair function until the total cell number reaches a detectable amount. We derived formulas for the probability and expected numbers of each population at the time of detection. Furthermore, we extended the model to consider the tumor dynamics during treatment. Results from the model were validated and showed good agreement with clinical and experimental evidence in BRCA-associated cancers. Based on the model, we investigated conditions in which drug resistance during the treatment course originated from either a pre-existing drug-resistant population or a de novo population, due to secondary mutations. Finally, we found that platinum drugs and PARPis were effective if (i) BRCA inactivation is present, (ii) the cancer was diagnosed early, and (iii) tumor growth is rapid.

To our knowledge, {{this is the first time}} these two dyes have been compared in their ability to stain preferential flow paths in soils. Dye-stained soil profiles within and downstream of the sprinkling areas were excavated parallel (lateral profiles) and perpendicular (frontal profiles) to the slopes' gradients. That <b>way</b> <b>preferential</b> flow patterns in the soil could be clearly identified. The results show that biomat flow, shallow subsurface flow in the organic topsoil layer, occurred at both hillslopes; however, at the peat bog hillslope it was significantly more prominent. The dye solutions infiltrated into the soil and continued either as lateral subsurface pipe flow in the case of the peat bog, or percolated vertically towards the bedrock in the case of the Podzol. This study provides evidence that subsurface pipe flow, lateral preferential flow along decomposed tree roots or logs in the unsaturated zone, is a major runoff formation process at the peat bog hillslope and in the adjacent riparian zone...|$|R
5000|$|Later in {{the same}} year, Australian {{immunologist}} Frank Macfarlane Burnet published a paper titled ‘A modification of Jerne's theory of antibody production using the concept of clonal selection’ in a rather obscure Australian Journal of Science. In it Burnet expanded the ideas of Talmage and named it [...] "clonal selection theory." [...] He further formalised the theory in his 1959 book The Clonal Selection Theory of Acquired Immunity. He explained immunological memory as the cloning of two types of lymphocyte. One clone acts immediately to combat infection whilst the other is longer lasting, remaining in the immune system for a long time, which results in immunity to that antigen. According to Burnet's hypothesis among antibodies are molecules that can correspond probably {{with varying degrees of}} precision to all, or virtually all, the antigenic determinants that occur in biological material other than that characteristic of the body itself. Each type of pattern is a specific product of a clone of lymphocytes and it is the essence of the hypothesis that each cell automatically has available on its surface representative reactive sites equivalent to those of the globulin they produce. When an antigen enters the blood or tissue fluids it is assumed that it will attach to the surface of any lymphocyte carrying reactive sites which correspond to one of its antigenic determinants. Then the cell is activated and undergo proliferation to produce a variety of descendents. In this <b>way,</b> <b>preferential</b> proliferation will be initiated of all those clones whose reactive sites correspond to the antigenic determinants on the antigen used. The descendents will be capable of active liberation of soluble antibody and lymphocytes which can fulfil the same functions as the parental forms.|$|R
