25|$|Skittler's Nine (Worcestershire, North Somerset and Gloucestershire): a nine {{achieved}} where a spare has {{not been}} possible, i.e. when the front pin has punched the middle and the back <b>pin</b> <b>out.</b>|$|E
25|$|The {{most unusual}} {{feature of the}} Contender is how the barrel is {{attached}} to the frame. By removing the fore-end, a large hinge pin is exposed; by pushing this hinge <b>pin</b> <b>out,</b> the barrel can be removed. Since the sights and extractor remain attached to the barrel in the Contender design, the frame itself contains no cartridge-specific features. A barrel of another caliber or length can be installed and pinned in place, the fore-end replaced, and the pistol is ready to shoot with a different barrel and pre-aligned sights. This allowed easy changes of calibers, sights, and barrel lengths, with only a flat screwdriver being required for this change.|$|E
25|$|The Single Action Army {{action is}} a {{refinement}} of the earlier Colt percussion revolvers and the Colt 1871 cartridge revolver. The cylinder is mounted on a central axis and operated by a hand with a double finger whose more extended action allowed the cylinder-ratchet to be cut in a larger circle, giving more torsional force to the cylinder. Three notches {{on the face of}} the hammer engage the sear portion of the trigger, affording four basic hammer positions. The hammer when fully lowered rests within the frame. Drawn slightly to the rear, the hammer engages the safety notch of the sear and holds the firing <b>pin</b> <b>out</b> of direct contact with a chambered cartridge. Like the earlier percussion revolvers, the Single Action Army was designed to allow loading of all of the chambers. The safety notch replaced pins on the rear of the percussion revolver cylinders, which served the same purpose as the safety position, by preventing hammer contact with the primer/percussion cap. However, many users adopted the practice of leaving one empty chamber under the hammer, because a sharp blow could damage the mechanism and allow a fully loaded revolver to fire. This practice is now universally recommended. Drawn back about half way, the hammer engages the second notch. This cams the cylinder bolt out of engagement and allows the cylinder to rotate for loading. Fully cocked, the revolver is ready to fire. Cartridge ejection is via the spring-loaded rod housed in a tube on the right side of the barrel.|$|E
60|$|THE MAN. Like as not. It {{takes the}} lynch <b>pins</b> <b>out,</b> I tell you.|$|R
50|$|In the Huntsville, Ontario {{election}} {{there was}} Internet voting provided by Canadian company Intelivote. There was {{an error in}} sending some of the <b>PINs</b> <b>out</b> by postal mail; as a result, replacement <b>PINs</b> were mailed <b>out.</b>|$|R
60|$|And he {{carefully}} took the <b>pins</b> <b>out</b> of the knot, and {{the rush of}} hair, of uniform dark brown, slid over the humped back.|$|R
2500|$|Activation {{begins when}} the pilot-chute is thrown out. It inflates and creates drag, pulling the <b>pin</b> <b>out</b> of the closing loop and {{allowing}} the pilot-chute to pull the deployment bag from the container. The parachute lines are pulled loose from the rubber bands and extend as the canopy starts to open. A rectangular piece of fabric called the [...] "slider" [...] (which separates the parachute lines into four main groups fed through grommets in the four respective corners of the slider) slows {{the opening of the}} parachute and works its way down until the canopy is fully open and the slider is just above the head of the skydiver. The slider slows and controls the deployment of the parachute. Without a slider, the parachute would inflate fast, potentially damaging the parachute fabric and/or suspension lines, as well as causing discomfort, injury or even death of the jumper. During a normal deployment, a skydiver will generally experience a few seconds of intense deceleration, in the realm of 3 to 4 g, while the parachute slows the descent from [...] to approximately 28km/h (17mph).|$|E
6000|$|... 'Yes, I {{might take}} the <b>pin</b> <b>out</b> {{of the bottom}} of the boat,' said Merton. 'It is an idea! But she swims at least as well as I do. Besides--hardly sportsmanlike.' ...|$|E
60|$|At this {{command the}} man in front rushed in and caught hold of the man's <b>pin.</b> <b>Out</b> it came in his hand, a {{beautiful}} affair, worth at least a hundred dollars.|$|E
5000|$|... #Caption: The VCR-like loading {{mechanism}} of the NES led to problems over time. The design wore connector <b>pins</b> <b>out</b> quickly and could easily become dirty, resulting in difficulties with the NES reading game carts.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, I {{really think}} Santa Claus {{has been very}} good to us all," [...] said Jean Lawrence, pulling the <b>pins</b> <b>out</b> of her heavy coil of fair hair and letting it ripple over her shoulders.|$|R
50|$|A three-piece {{version of}} the above uses a tiny {{pivoting}} arm held under tension inside the hinge. Pulling on the handle from any direction lifts the pivoting arm's <b>pins</b> <b>out</b> of the zipper teeth so that the slider can move.|$|R
6000|$|... "Miss Burroughs," [...] I exclaimed, [...] "please {{take that}} <b>pin</b> <b>out</b> of this blanket. If I {{can get at}} his head I know I can pull him around and make him go." ...|$|E
6000|$|As {{soon as she}} {{was gone}} the lad took the <b>pin</b> <b>out</b> of his master's coat, who {{instantly}} awoke. The first word he said to the lad was, 'Have you seen her?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "The patent {{bush has}} got {{loose in the}} hub," [...] he resumed. [...] "I took the <b>pin</b> <b>out</b> and then saw I might have trouble if the wheel came off. It has been {{threatening}} to play this trick for some time." ...|$|E
50|$|Lockpick: To unlock a door, players must {{clear the}} <b>pins</b> <b>out</b> of the tumbler. Players use their gadget to shoot pins onto the lock tumbler to unlock it. When {{there are three}} or more pins of the same color aligned, they will disappear.|$|R
6000|$|But {{this did}} not satisfy Kate at all; the <b>pinning</b> <b>out</b> of the leaf was stupid work {{compared}} with the glory of making the ink fly. In vain did Adelaide represent that all the taste and skill was in the laying out the leaves, and pinning them down, and that anyone could put on the ink; in vain did Mary represent the dirtiness of the work: this was {{the beauty of it}} in her eyes; and the sight of the black dashes sputtering through the comb filled her with emulation; so that she entreated, almost piteously, to be allowed to [...] "do" [...] an ivy loaf, which she had hastily, and not very carefully, <b>pinned</b> <b>out</b> with Mary's assistance--that is, she had feebly and unsteadily stuck every pin, and Mary had steadied them.|$|R
6000|$|... "A little hot beer {{would do}} yer bloomin' temper a deal more good than ten yards o' blue ribbon at sixpence. Blue ruin's more in my line," [...] {{observed}} Thomas, epigram-matically, much comforted by his refreshment. Aid with two well-directed taps he knocked the <b>pins</b> <b>out</b> of their sockets, and let down the backboard of the cart.|$|R
6000|$|... "'Because I {{have no one}} to talk to {{and play}} with,' said Alma. Then the old black woman drew a long brass <b>pin</b> <b>out</b> of her shawl and pricked Alma's tongue with it, for she made Alma hold it out to be pricked.|$|E
60|$|Fingering {{still the}} letter in his pocket he drew the <b>pin</b> <b>out</b> of it. Common pin, eh? He threw it on the road. Out of her clothes somewhere: pinned together. Queer the number of pins they always have. No roses without thorns.|$|E
6000|$|They were {{interrupted}} by Mrs. Allen: [...] "My dear Catherine," [...] said she, [...] "do take this <b>pin</b> <b>out</b> of my sleeve; I am afraid it has torn a hole already; I shall be quite sorry if it has, {{for this is}} a favourite gown, though it cost but nine shillings a yard." ...|$|E
50|$|This split {{is similar}} to the Big five, but is made {{slightly}} harder because there is another pin in the back row, creating a split with two pins on one side and four pins on the other. The split should be made with a drastic curve on the back end of the lane, so that the ball can convert the four pins and have the frontmost pin take the two remaining <b>pins</b> <b>out.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "It has {{certainly}} been a very mixed evening, Alice," [...] she said, as she took the <b>pins</b> <b>out</b> of her back hair and let it fall; and she continued to talk as she {{went back and forth}} between their rooms. [...] "What do you think of banjo-playing for young ladies? Isn't it rather rowdy? Decidedly rowdy, I think. And Dan's Yankee story! I expected to see the old gentleman get up and perform some trick." ...|$|R
2500|$|Indeed, {{some of the}} {{assumptions}} identified above are also <b>pin</b> pointed <b>out</b> in a study written by the historian H.A. Drake, as he states: ...|$|R
6000|$|The {{moment we}} were in our own room, I could not stop to take {{so much as a}} <b>pin</b> <b>out</b> of my dress before I began. [...] "My dear," [...] said I, [...] "I never heard you tell that gambling-house {{adventure}} so well before. What an effect it had upon our friends! what an effect, indeed, it always has wherever you tell it!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Come here, {{and let me}} pin them in for you." [...] He {{arranged}} {{them two}} or three {{at a time in}} the bosom of her dress, stepping back now and then to see the effect. [...] "You know," [...] he said, taking the <b>pin</b> <b>out</b> of his mouth, [...] "a woman ought always to arrange her flowers before her glass." ...|$|E
60|$|With {{this she}} went off, {{and as soon}} as she had gone the lad took the <b>pin</b> <b>out</b> of his master's coat. He awoke instantly, and the first word he said was, 'Have you seen her?' The lad said that he had, and there was the sword she had left for him. The Irishman was ready to kill the lad out of sheer vexation, but when he gave a glance over his {{shoulder}} not a trace of the fair-haired lad was left.|$|E
50|$|The {{remaining}} thieves plan {{to break}} into the truck by knocking the <b>pins</b> <b>out</b> of the door hinges. Jake arrives when Ty successfully restores power to the truck's alarm. Baines shoots Jake. While the thieves are distracted, Ty sneaks Jake into the truck. Dobbs (Skeet Ulrich) begins to have second thoughts about the operation and agrees with Ty to get the fuse Mike removed from the engine. Dobbs is caught trying to put it back and Palmer stabs him to death.|$|R
5000|$|The slider {{can also}} have a two-piece hinge {{assembly}} attaching the handle to the slider, with {{the base of the}} hinge under spring tension and with protruding pins on the bottom that insert between the zipper teeth. To move the zipper, the handle is pulled outward against spring tension, lifting the <b>pins</b> <b>out</b> from between the teeth as the slider moves. When the handle is released the pins automatically engage between the zipper teeth again. They are called [...] "auto-lock sliders".|$|R
50|$|Clock {{requirements}} {{were met}} by connecting an 8 MHz crystal directly to two <b>pins.</b> Alternatively, <b>out</b> of phase signals from an external clock generator could be used.|$|R
60|$|By {{this the}} Irishman {{knew that she}} had sent the lad to wait on him. The lad also told him that his {{mistress}} wished him to be ready next morning at nine o'clock, when she would come for him with the carriage, as she had promised. He was greatly pleased at this, and next morning, when the time was drawing near, went out into the garden; but the little fair-haired lad took a big <b>pin</b> <b>out</b> of his pocket, and stuck it {{into the back of the}} Irishman's coat without his noticing it, whereupon he fell sound asleep.|$|E
6000|$|Joseph simpered in undisguised {{satisfaction}} with himself. [...] "It's a present, sir, from Madame Fontaine. I take her flowers {{almost every day}} from Mr. Engelman, and I have done one or two trifling errands {{for her in the}} town. She was pleased with my attention to her wishes. 'I have very little money, Mr. Joseph,' she said; 'oblige me by accepting this pin in return for the trouble I have given you.' And she took the <b>pin</b> <b>out</b> of the beautiful white lace round her neck, and made me a present of it with her own hand. A most liberal lady, isn't she, sir?" ...|$|E
60|$|Tom's bosom friend {{sat next}} him, {{suffering}} just as Tom had been, {{and now he}} was deeply and gratefully interested in this entertainment in an instant. This bosom friend was Joe Harper. The two boys were sworn friends all the week, and embattled enemies on Saturdays. Joe took a <b>pin</b> <b>out</b> of his lapel and began to assist in exercising the prisoner. The sport grew in interest momently. Soon Tom said that they were interfering with each other, and neither getting the fullest benefit of the tick. So he put Joe's slate on the desk and drew a line down the middle of it from top to bottom.|$|E
40|$|A {{labyrinth}} ring and 55 pins pertaining to an aeroengine, which completed 741 : 29 / 242 : 02 hrs in service {{were sent to}} the laboratory for analysis. Dye penetrant examination revealed crack like indications in 9 <b>pins</b> <b>out</b> of the 55 pins at about 4 - 5 mm from the pin-head. Examination of these pins under the Scanning Electron Microscope revealed a circumferential deformation/depression marks at this location. Metallographic examination showed that out of these 9 pins, one pin had a fatigue crack of length of about 450 m...|$|R
50|$|Further damage {{occurred}} during disassembly. The commissioned stonemason used percussion drills {{to get the}} iron <b>pins</b> <b>out</b> that held {{the pieces of the}} granite together. In doing so, large pieces at the respective ends of the drums were broken off. The drilling holes {{at each end of the}} drums show this clearly. The journey to Berlin was did not go smoothly either. The statue of Frederick William I from Great Stresow broke off at the legs. The head came off and was glued back by the master stonemason.|$|R
5000|$|In {{the year}} 2009, Brick and Lace {{released}} their single called [...] "Bad to di Bone" [...] {{which became a}} well-known track in European and African countries. A French collaboration was even presented hence popularity. This new single was intentionally <b>pinned</b> <b>out</b> to appear on a new upcoming album, but instead was re-based on [...] "Love is Wicked", which was re-released for a second shot at fame and success. In July 2009, the duo penned another hit track called [...] "Room Service", a summer hit released from the new Love is Wicked album.|$|R
