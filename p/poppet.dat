5|$|Meanwhile, Peattie's {{landlord}} sneaks {{into his}} apartment for pain medication and finds Lynette's body in his bed. Immediately, she contracts a flesh-eating disease. After {{hearing about the}} incident on the news, Mulder goes to Peattie's apartment and finds the body, now headless. Peattie finds the Wieder family, whom Scully is protecting, and makes a <b>poppet</b> with Scully's hair and photo inside. He places nails in the doll's eyes and Scully promptly goes blind. Peattie breaks into the house, takes Scully's gun and stabs a <b>poppet</b> of Wieder, causing the doctor to collapse in pain. Wieder gets Peattie to admit that he's taking out his own guilt {{about not being able}} to save Lynette by blaming him instead. Mulder shows up, finds Scully's doll and removes the nails from it, allowing her to regain her vision and shoot Peattie. He is placed in a coma and Lynnette's body is shipped back to her home in West Virginia.|$|E
5|$|Merlin {{reports to}} Camelot's {{physician}} Gaius (Richard Wilson) and saves the old man's {{life when he}} falls from a balcony by magically moving a mattress to cushion his fall. Though initially denying his abilities, Merlin later admits {{that he has had}} magical powers since birth, which Gaius warns him to keep secret. Reading a letter from Merlin's mother, Gaius realises that the boy was sent to Camelot for protection. Meanwhile, in the forest outside Camelot, Mary kills Lady Helen (Myles), a singer who is to perform at Uther's court, with a <b>poppet.</b> Mary assumes Helen's appearance using an enchantment, though her true hideous appearance can still be seen in her reflection (like in mirrors or water).|$|E
5|$|The {{valve gear}} that was settled upon was a {{modified}} form of Caprotti valve gear, the novel rotary cam-driven British Caprotti valve gear developed by Heenan & Froude with <b>poppet</b> valves. This {{was based on}} Italian locomotive practice and allowed precise control of steam admission to the cylinders while improving exhaust flow and boiler draughting characteristics {{when compared to the}} more conventional Walschaerts and Stephenson valve gear. On paper this created a free-steaming, hard-working locomotive capable of hauling heavy loads over long distances but, in practice, fundamental design errors and undetected deviations from the drawings made during construction combined to prevent the locomotive from achieving its expected performance during British Railways ownership.|$|E

The Orange and Mint varieties {{are made of}} a fondant centre with a dark chocolate covering, the Choc Chip Cookie, Toffee and Raisin varieties have their filling coated with milk chocolate. The Strawberry Milkshake flavour is a fondant like Orange and Mint, but with a milk chocolate coating. During 2009, ten million <b>Poppets</b> were consumed each week.|$|R

5|$|Gaius instructs Merlin {{to deliver}} elixirs to Morgana and Lady Helen; in the latter's room {{he finds the}} <b>poppet,</b> but bluffs {{his way out of}} discovery. Later, Helen kills a handmaiden who glimpses her true form in a mirror. At the feast, Mary sings an enchantment as Lady Helen, causing all the guests to fall asleep. Merlin, {{realising}} what is going on, covers his ears. Mary attempts to kill Arthur, but Merlin drops a chandelier on her with magic before she releases the dagger. As she has stopped singing, the enchantment is lifted and her true appearance is revealed. In a last effort she throws the dagger at Arthur, but Merlin slows time to pull him out of the way. Mary dies from her injuries, having failed in her attempt to avenge her son. Uther rewards Merlin by making him Arthur's servant, though neither boy is thrilled with the idea. The next day, Gaius gives Merlin a book on magic, under condition that he keep it hidden.|$|E

25|$|In {{the late}} 1920s Harry Ricardo wrote {{a paper on}} the sleeve valve design that led to the USAAC's hyper engine efforts. He claimed that the 1hp/in³ goal was {{impossible}} to achieve with <b>poppet</b> valve type engines. The USAAC engineering team at Wright Field decided to test this claim by beating it. The I-1430 was the result of an experimental effort at Wright Field to build a high-power cylinder using conventional <b>poppet</b> valves. The engineers, led by Sam Heron, used a variety of techniques to raise the allowable RPM, which was the key to increased power without requiring a larger engine.|$|E
25|$|Laurence Pomeroy joined Damler in late 1926, {{at first}} working on {{commercial}} vehicles but from 1928 {{he worked at}} the products of the main Daimler operation. Pomeroy introduced redesigned <b>poppet</b> valve engines with the Daimler Fifteen in September 1932, developed new models of Daimlers, and recommended what became the September 1932 introduction of the small BSA and Lanchester Tens with <b>poppet</b> valve engines to help Daimler survive the depression. According to Martin, these actions rescued the business from total collapse in 1932. In 1934, the Pomeroy-designed poppet-valve Straight-Eights replaced the Daimler Double-Six sleeve-valve V12s without controversy or embarrassment, thereby being a personal triumph for Pomeroy.|$|E
25|$|The Deerhound I was a triple-row, 21-cylinder, {{air-cooled}} {{radial engine}} design with the unusual feature of inline cylinder banks. Unlike earlier Armstrong Siddeley engines the Deerhound used overhead camshafts to operate its <b>poppet</b> valves, using one camshaft for each bank of three cylinders.|$|E

50|$|<b>Poppets</b> {{are best}} known for their iconic {{packaging}} in small, 40 gram, cardboard boxes. When other confectionery moved to plastic wrappers in the 1960s and 1970s, <b>Poppets</b> retained their traditional boxes. The box has a small hatch in one corner that can be torn open to dispense the sweets one at a time, this 'popping out' having given them their original name. The non-rustling packaging, {{and the ability to}} dispense single sweets in the dark, made them a popular snack in cinemas which remain one of their most popular sales outlets. The box was redesigned in 2006 with new printed designs, themed with other design icons such as the Mini and a NatWest Piggy Bank. While 150 gram sharing sized bags can now be bought, <b>Poppets</b> remain {{best known for}} their box.|$|R
50|$|The {{earliest}} haunted dolls were <b>poppets,</b> effigies and voodoo objects {{which were}} created by early peoples for either religious or ceremonial purposes. These traditional objects were later acquired by various civilizations for mystical purposes or the occult. In Rome dolls were used quite often in magical rituals to represent a connection to a god or goddess. Egyptian priests and magicians often used <b>poppets</b> for ceremonial purposes, to rid the body of evil or to place curses on those who went against {{the will of the}} Gods.|$|R
25|$|The {{triple valve}} is {{described}} as being so named as it performs three functions: Charging air into an air tank ready to be used, applying the brakes, and releasing them. In so doing, it supports certain other actions (i.e. it 'holds' or maintains the application and it permits the exhaust of brake cylinder pressure and the recharging of the reservoir during the release). In his patent application, Westinghouse refers to his 'triple-valve device' because of the three component valvular parts comprising it: the diaphragm-operated <b>poppet</b> valve feeding reservoir air to the brake cylinder, the reservoir charging valve, and the brake cylinder release valve. When he soon improved the device by removing the <b>poppet</b> valve action, these three components became the piston valve, the slide valve, and the graduating valve.|$|E
25|$|In {{internal}} combustion engines with pistons, the camshaft {{is used to}} operate <b>poppet</b> valves. It consists of a cylindrical rod running {{the length of the}} cylinder bank with a number of oblong lobes protruding from it, one for each valve. The cam lobes force the valves open by pressing on the valve, or on some intermediate mechanism, as they rotate.|$|E
25|$|Suddenly, Giles Corey and Francis Nurse {{enter the}} house and inform John and Hale that both of their wives have been arrested on charges of witchcraft; Martha Corey for reading {{suspicious}} books and Rebecca Nurse on charges of sacrificing children. A posse led by clerk Ezekiel Cheever and town marshal George Herrick arrive soon afterwards and present a warrant for Elizabeth's arrest, much to Hale's surprise. Cheever picks up the <b>poppet</b> on Elizabeth's table and finds a needle inside. He informs John that Abigail had a pain-induced fit earlier that evening and a needle was found stuck into her stomach; Abigail claimed that Elizabeth stabbed her with the needle through witchcraft, using a <b>poppet</b> as a conduit. John brings Mary into the room to tell the truth; Mary asserts that she made the doll and stuck the needle into it, and that Abigail saw her do so. Cheever is unconvinced and prepares to arrest Elizabeth.|$|E

50|$|<b>Poppets</b> Town is an {{animated}} children's television series produced by DHX Media and Neptuno Films. It {{is based on}} the characters created by Jun Ichihara. The series aired on Knowledge Network and TVOKids in Canada in 2008.|$|R
25|$|The S1 did not {{represent}} Baldwin's true desires for the type, but {{in the design of}} the T1, of which two prototypes were ordered in July 1940, Baldwin was given much more freedom. The PRR's requirements were the use of the Belpaire firebox and the Franklin oscillating-cam <b>poppet</b> valve gear. The two, #6110 and #6111, were delivered in April and May 1942. Testing again proved them to be powerful and capable but not sure-footed.|$|E
25|$|Most radial engines use {{overhead}} <b>poppet</b> valves {{driven by}} pushrods and lifters on a cam plate which is concentric with the crankshaft, {{with a few}} smaller radials, like the Kinner B-5 and Russian Shvetsov M-11, using individual camshafts within the crankcase for each cylinder. A few engines use sleeve valves such as the 14-cylinder Bristol Hercules and the 18-cylinder Bristol Centaurus, which are quieter and smoother running but require much tighter manufacturing tolerances.|$|E
25|$|The design {{featured}} a horizontally opposed, four-cylinder layout {{with a single}} camshaft operating <b>poppet</b> valves through pushrods that were hollowed to save weight. The crankshaft was supported on ball bearings which allowed a simple 'splash' lubrication system to be used. Cooling was by water with the cylinders being encased in copper jackets. Although the engine ran well, it was not placed into production. The only order was a small contract from the British Government for use in airships.|$|E

25|$|Power: Because each {{cylinder}} on a {{radial engine}} {{has its own}} head, it is impractical to use a multivalve valvetrain on a radial engine. Therefore, almost all radial engines use a two valve pushrod-type valvetrain which may result in less power for a given displacement than multi-valve inline engines. The limitations of the <b>poppet</b> valve were largely overcome {{by the development of}} the sleeve valve, but at the cost of increased complexity, maintenance costs and reduced reliability.|$|E
25|$|Free-flow: Either of {{the stages}} may {{get stuck in}} the open position, causing a {{continuous}} flow of gas from the regulator known as a free-flow. This can be triggered by a range of causes, some {{of which can be}} easily remedied, others not. Possible causes include incorrect interstage pressure setting, incorrect second stage valve spring tension, damaged or sticking valve <b>poppet,</b> damaged valve seat, valve freezing, wrong sensitivity setting at the surface and in Poseidon servo-assisted second stages, low interstage pressure.|$|E
25|$|Early {{locomotives}} used {{a simple}} valve gear that gave full power in either forward or reverse. Soon the Stephenson valve gear allowed {{the driver to}} control cut-off; this was largely superseded by Walschaerts valve gear and similar patterns. Early locomotive designs using slide valves and outside admission were relatively easy to construct, but inefficient and prone to wear. Eventually, slide valves were superseded by inside admission piston valves, though there were attempts to apply <b>poppet</b> valves (commonly used in stationary engines) in the 20th century. Stephenson valve gear was generally placed within the frame and was difficult to access for maintenance; later patterns applied outside the frame were more readily visible and maintained.|$|E
