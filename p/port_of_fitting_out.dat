5|$|In United States v. Gooding (1827), the Court {{construed}} {{the elements}} <b>of</b> the <b>fitting</b> <b>out</b> offense. First, the Court {{held that the}} offense <b>of</b> <b>fitting</b> <b>out</b> a vessel for slave trading could be committed even if {{the owner of the}} vessel did not personally fit it out. Second, the Court held that the statute could be violated by a partial <b>fitting</b> <b>out</b> (as opposed to a complete <b>fitting</b> <b>out)</b> <b>of</b> a vessel for that purpose. Third, the Court held thatsince slave trading was a misdemeanorthere was no distinction between principal and accessory. Fourth, the Court held that, for the statute to be violated, the <b>fitting</b> <b>out</b> must have occurred within the United States. Finally, the Court held that the statute's mens rea required that the owner intend to cause the vessel to be used for slave trading, as opposed to intending that the vessel be used for slave trading (by some third party).|$|R
50|$|Amphitrite {{was ordered}} on 8 January 1777 from Deptford Dockyard, and laid {{down there on}} 2 July 1777. She was built under the {{supervision}} of Master Shipwright Adam Hayes, and was launched on 28 May 1778. She was commissioned into navy service on 22 July 1778, having cost a total of £12,737.6.6d to build, including the cost <b>of</b> <b>fitting</b> <b>out</b> and coppering.|$|R
60|$|I {{selected}} General Weitzel, of the Army of the James, to go {{with the}} expedition, but gave instructions through General Butler. He commanded the department within whose geographical limits Fort Fisher was situated, as well as Beaufort and other points on that coast held by our troops; he was, therefore, entitled to the right <b>of</b> <b>fitting</b> <b>out</b> the expedition against Fort Fisher.|$|R
25|$|There then {{followed}} a period <b>of</b> <b>fitting</b> <b>out</b> and carrying out sea trials during 1796, after {{which she was}} assigned to the Spanish Mediterranean fleet at Cartagena under Admiral José de Córdoba y Ramos. Shortly afterwards Spain allied with Republican France and entered the French Revolutionary Wars against Britain and her allies. The Spanish Navy was assigned to support the planned invasion of Britain.|$|R
6000|$|So Catherine, {{who had a}} {{handsome}} way [...] <b>Of</b> <b>fitting</b> <b>out</b> her favourites, conferr'd [...] This secret charge on Juan, to display [...] At once her royal splendour, and reward [...] His services. He kiss'd hands the next day, [...] Received instructions how to play his card, [...] Was laden {{with all kinds of}} gifts and honours, [...] Which show'd what great discernment was the donor's.|$|R
6000|$|In 1497, a Castilian vessel {{arrived there}} being of 12,000 quintals burden. These arrivals, {{incidentally}} mentioned among others of similar size, as happening at one port, show that large ships were {{in use in}} those days. [329] Indeed, at the time <b>of</b> <b>fitting</b> <b>out</b> the second expedition of Columbus, there were prepared in the <b>port</b> <b>of</b> Bermeo, a Caracca of 1250 tons, and four ships, of from 150 to 450 tons burden. Their destination, however, was altered, and they were sent to convoy Muley Boabdil, the last Moorish king of Granada, from the coast of his conquered territory to Africa. [330] ...|$|R
5|$|Towards the end <b>of</b> <b>fitting</b> <b>out,</b> the ship's {{flagship}} facilities, {{including those}} on the bridge and in the admiral's cabins, were modified to satisfy Combined Fleet's desire to have the ship equipped as the primary flagship of the commander-in-chief, as her sister Yamato was too far along for such changes. These alterations, along with improvements in the secondary battery armour, pushed back completion and pre-handover testing of Musashi by two months, to August 1942.|$|R
50|$|Alongside the new Basins new {{buildings}} were erected, {{on a huge}} scale, to accommodate new manufacturing and construction processes. These included a gun-mounting workshop (1881, producing gun turrets), torpedo workshop (1886), and the very large New Factory of 1905, {{to the east of}} No 13 dock, which was soon put to the task <b>of</b> <b>fitting</b> <b>out</b> Dreadnoughts. Electrification came to the Yard with the opening of a 9,800 kW power station in 1906.|$|R
50|$|Shop fitting (shopfitting) is {{the trade}} <b>of</b> <b>fitting</b> <b>out</b> retail and service shops and stores with equipment, {{fixtures}} and fittings. The trade {{applies to all}} kinds of outlets from small corner shops to hypermarkets. A shop fitter executes planning, designs shop layout and installs equipment and services. A shop fitting firm typically incorporates professional expertise in interior design, manufacturing of bespoke furniture, signage and fittings (with own or outsourced facilities) and purchasing of retail equipment.|$|R

6000|$|Dr. Etherington soon led {{me into a}} calmer tone of mind. In {{the course}} of the day, many matters were {{discussed}} and settled. I was told that Captain Poke had been a good nurse, though in a sealing fashion; and that the least I could do was to send him back to Stunin'tun, free of cost. This was agreed to, and the worthy but dogmatical mariner was promised the means <b>of</b> <b>fitting</b> <b>out</b> a new [...] "Debby and Dolly." ...|$|R
2500|$|The plan {{met with}} opposition, as the British National Maritime Museum had prior {{claim to the}} 1907 built Reliant, as they planned to scrap the hull and {{preserve}} {{one or both of}} the Side Lever ( [...] or Grasshopper [...] ) engines and perhaps a paddle wheel. It was suggested that a deal could be done, if the SMM were to buy the Eppleton Hall and pay for the cost <b>of</b> <b>fitting</b> <b>out</b> the display for the NMM in exchange for the operable Reliant.|$|R
6000|$|Well, {{to make a}} {{long story}} short, we got a few hands on board, made a good cruise home, and the HISPANIOLA reached Bristol just as Mr. Blandly was {{beginning}} to think <b>of</b> <b>fitting</b> <b>out</b> her consort. Five men only of those who had sailed returned with her. [...] "Drink and the devil had done for the rest," [...] with a vengeance, although, to be sure, we were not quite in so bad a case as that other ship they sang about: ...|$|R
50|$|Ranger was {{commissioned}} at League Island Naval Shipyard, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, 27 November 1876, with Commander H. D. Manley in command. After completion <b>of</b> <b>fitting</b> <b>out,</b> Ranger {{was assigned to}} the Atlantic Station, but remained in the Gosport (Portsmouth) Navy Yard and Hampton Roads until 8 March 1877, when she {{was assigned to the}} Asiatic Fleet. Following a special <b>fitting</b> <b>out</b> for her new duty, Ranger left New York City 21 May 1877, arriving Hong Kong 24 August 1877, via Gibraltar, Suez Canal, and Malacca Straits. The ship served on the Asiatic Station until the fall of 1879, protecting American interests and national policy in the Far East.|$|R
25|$|In 1857 the Philosophical Institute {{formed an}} Exploration Committee {{with the aim}} of {{investigating}} the practicability <b>of</b> <b>fitting</b> <b>out</b> an exploring expedition. While interest in inland exploration was strong in the neighbouring colonies of New South Wales and South Australia, in Victoria enthusiasm was limited. Even the anonymous donation of £1,000 (later discovered to be from Ambrose Kyte) to the Fund Raising Committee of the Royal Society failed to generate much interest and it was 1860 before sufficient money was raised and the expedition was assembled.|$|R
50|$|On 25 March 1920, the Canadian {{government}} {{accepted a}} British offer of one light cruiser and two destroyers {{to replace the}} two decrepit cruisers currently owned by Canada. Originally a Bristol-class cruiser was offered, however they ran on coal and the Canadian government negotiated for an oil-burning cruiser. In 1920 Aurora was re-activated to outfit her for transfer to the Royal Canadian Navy. The cost <b>of</b> <b>fitting</b> <b>out</b> the cruiser for service in the northern Atlantic cost $10,495, exclusive of machinery and a refrigeration plant.|$|R
60|$|But these offers {{were not}} at all tempting to the Brethren of the Coast; from pirates rampant to pirates couchant was too great a change, and some of them, who found it {{impossible}} to embark on piratical cruises, on account of the increasing difficulties <b>of</b> <b>fitting</b> <b>out</b> vessels, returned to their original avocations of cattle-butchering and beef-drying, and some, it is said, chose rather to live among the wild Indians and share their independent lives, than to bind themselves to any form of honest industry.|$|R
500|$|Deutschland {{was laid}} {{down at the}} Deutsche Werke {{shipyard}} in Kiel on 5 February 1929, under the contract name Panzerschiff A, {{as a replacement for}} the old battleship [...] Work began under construction number 219. The ship was launched on 19 May 1931; at her launching, she was christened by German Chancellor Heinrich Brüning. The ship accidentally started sliding down the slipway while Brüning was giving his christening speech. After the completion <b>of</b> <b>fitting</b> <b>out</b> work, initial sea trials began in November 1932. The ship was commissioned into the Reichsmarine on 1 April 1933.|$|R
50|$|A new 80-gun ship of the line, , was {{commissioned}} in January 1756. Brett was named as her first captain, bringing with him {{his choice of}} petty officers and foretopmen from the Royal yacht fleet. Despite her commissioning Cambridge required several months <b>of</b> <b>fitting</b> <b>out</b> for sea service and was still unseaworthy when war with France was declared in May 1756. Brett was forced to wait until December for Cambridge to be declared fit to put to sea, {{and then it was}} not until February 1757 that she was equipped with her full complement of cannon.|$|R
