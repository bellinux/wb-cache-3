Recrystallization mechanisms also differ: subgrain rotation dominates in garnet clinopyroxenites, whereas in spinel websterites nucleation and growth also contribute. Elongated shapes and strong intracrystalline misorientations suggest plastic deformation of garnet, but CPOs are weak.

40|$|<b>Pyroxenites</b> are an {{essential}} component in petrological and geochemical models for melt formation at mid-ocean ridges and ocean islands.

Here, we present a detailed study of the microtextures and major, minor and trace element compositions of relatively fresh <b>pyroxenites</b> and associated harzburgites from the ultraslow-spreading Lena Trough, Arctic Ocean. Microtextural and geochemical characteristics suggest an origin by magmatic assimilation-fractional crystallization with a high ratio of mass crystallized to mass assimilated. The major element compositions of pyroxenes suggest that this process occurred at high pressures (> 0 center dot 7 GPa), although interstitial plagioclase {{in two of the}} <b>pyroxenites</b> indicates that melt-rock reaction continued at lower pressures. The parental melt to the <b>pyroxenites</b> was most probably depleted mid-ocean ridge basalt similar to basalts from the North Lena Trough and westernmost Gakkel Ridge; basalts from the Central Lena Trough cannot have functioned as parental melts. The melt was generated close to the garnet-spinel facies transition by variable degrees of partial melting and reacted with the local refractory harzburgite. <b>Pyroxenites</b> from this study provide further evidence, together with plagioclase-bearing and vein-bearing peridotites, for significant melt stagnation below the Lena Trough that occurred over a range of depths, either continuously or stepwise.

Abundant <b>pyroxenites</b> are exposed within a 600 [*]m thick section of arc-related mantle harzburgites and dunites in the Herbeira massif of the Cabo Ortegal Complex, Spain. We report a combination of field and petrographic observations with in situ and whole-rock geochemical studies of these <b>pyroxenites.</b> After constraining the effects of secondary processes (serpentinization, fluid or melt percolation and amphibolitization), we determine that the low Al content of pyroxenes, high abundance of compatible elements and the absence of plagioclase reflect melt–peridotite interaction and crystal segregation from primitive hydrous melts at relatively low pressure (< 1 · 2 [*]GPa). Olivine clinopyroxenites and olivine websterites preserving dunite lenses (type 1 and 3 <b>pyroxenites)</b> represent the products of partial replacement of peridotites at decreasing melt/rock ratio following the intrusion of picritic melts. Massive websterites (type 2) may represent the final products of this reaction at higher melt/rock ratios. They crystallized from more Si-rich (boninitic) melts, potentially generated through differentiation of the initially picritic melts or intruded as dykes and veins. Rare opx-rich websterites (type 4) were produced by interaction of these melts with dunites. Chromatographic re-equilibration accompanied late-magmatic crystallization of amphibole from migrating or trapped residual melts. This percolative fractional crystallization produced a range of rare earth element (REE) patterns from spoon-shaped in type 1 <b>pyroxenites</b> to strongly light REE (LREE) -enriched in type 2 and 3 <b>pyroxenites.</b> Particularly high CaO/Al₂O₃ ratios (2 · 2 – 11 · 3) and the selective enrichment of large ion lithophile elements (LILE) over high field strength elements (HFSE) in Cabo Ortegal <b>pyroxenites</b> suggest the generation of Ca-rich picritic–boninitic parental melts via low-degree, second-stage melting of a refractory lherzolite at < 2 [*]GPa, following percolation of slab-derived fluids and/or carbonatite melts. <b>Pyroxenites</b> and their host peridotites record high-temperature deformation followed by the development of sheath folds and mylonites. Peak metamorphism was then reached under eclogite-facies conditions (1 · 6 – 1 · 8 [*]GPa and 780 – 800 °C) as recorded by undeformed garnet coronas around spinel. We suggest that this episode corresponds to the delamination of an arc root owing to gravitational instabilities arising from the presence of abundant <b>pyroxenites</b> within mantle harzburgites. Retrograde metamorphism and hydration under amphibolite-facies conditions were recorded by abundant post-kinematic amphibole, which corresponds to the exhumation of the arc root after its intrusion into a subduction zone.

40|$|Over {{the last}} twenty years, the knowlege of MORB petrological and {{chemical}} variability has been considerably extended. The sub-oceanic mantle, engaged in the partial melting at the MORB origin, has been revealed as relatively heterogeneous, and containing a significant fraction of <b>pyroxenites</b> that may {{play an important role}} in basalt generation. In the same way, the effect of the magma/peridotite interactions has been often underestimated. Usually, the transport of magma into high permeable dunitic channels formed by focused flow is the mechanism proposed beneath mid-ocean ridges, but the chemical transformations of magmas during the process is badly constrained. In this study, experiments have been conducted in piston-cylinder apparatus between 0. 5 and 2. 5 GPa in order to characterise melting relationships and the melt compositions of three <b>pyroxenites,</b> and also to quantify the effects of magma/peridotite interactions. The microdike technique was used to separate the liquid from the solid phases and to obtain reliable glass analyses, even at low degrees of melting. The aim was to answer three questions concerning the MORB petrogenesis: What is the role of <b>pyroxenites</b> in the major element composition of MORB? What is the fate of pyroxenite-derived melts into the peridotitic mantle? What transformations are inferred by magma focusing and magma/rock interactions on the melt composition and on the chemical and mineralogical composition of the host peridotite? This study provides a large database for the melting relationships of <b>pyroxenites</b> and for the pyroxenite-derived melt compositions, especially at low degrees of melting. Partial melting experiments performed on three <b>pyroxenites,</b> representative of worldwide compositional variability, show that at 1 and 1. 5 GPa, in many instances and for most major elements, pyroxenite-derived melts are similar to peridotite-derived melts. These melts may undergo minor interactions with the overlying peridotitic mantle. On the contrary, at higher pressure the interactions between pyroxenite-derived melts and the subsolidus peridotitic mantle lead to a substantial consumption of the percolating melt and to a crystallisation of clinopyroxenes. This is likely to impede further infiltration and to increase the ultramafic rock diversity in the upper mantle. Hence, the partial melting of <b>pyroxenites</b> may have significant effects on mantle source compositions and on the physicochemical processes of basalt genesis, while the contribution of pyroxenite-derived melts may not lead to major changes of the compositions of primitive basaltic magmas. Less frequently, <b>pyroxenites</b> yield melts with very SiO 2 -poor and FeO-rich compositions that may explain the major element signature of a class of primitive MORB with FeO > 8. 5 % et SiO 2 8. 5 % et SiO 2 < 48. 7 % pds.

40|$|International audiencePyroxenites and garnet <b>pyroxenites</b> are mantle {{heterogeneities}} {{characterized by}} a lower solidus temperature than the enclosing peridotites; it follows that they are preferentially involved during magma genesis. Constraining their origin, composition, and the interactions they underwent during their subsequent evolution is therefore essential to discuss the sources of magmatism in a given area. <b>Pyroxenites</b> could represent either recycling of crustal rocks in mantle domains or mantle originated rocks (formed either by olivine consuming melt-rock reactions or by crystal fractionation). Petrological and geochemical (major and trace elements, Sr–Nd and O isotopes) features of xenoliths from various occurrences (French Massif-Central, Jordan, Morocco and Cameroon) show that these samples represent cumulates crystallized during melt percolation at mantle conditions. They formed in mantle domains at pressures of 1 – 2 GPa during post-collisional magmatism (possibly Hercynian for the French Massif-Central, and Panafrican for Morocco, Jordan and Cameroon). The thermal re-equilibration of lithospheric domains, typical of the late orogenic exhumation stages, is also recorded by the samples.

The presence of large amounts of mantle <b>pyroxenites</b> in old orogenic regions indeed imparts peculiar physical and chemical characteristics to these domains.

The occurrence of these <b>pyroxenites</b> in dykes implies that channelled percolation of melts account for their replacive character. High CaO/Al 2 O 3, low Zr and crystallisation of diopside suggest that a melt of ankaramitic/carbonatitic composition percolated in lherzolite replacing porphyroclastic olivine and forming the pyroxenes in the websterite.

Locally, these melts were group A (garnet-bearing rocks) occurring in the spinel tectonite tapped into cracks forming intrusive dykes. domain; group B (spinel websterites) along the recrystallization front; group C (Ti-rich spinel <b>pyroxenites)</b> in the granular tectonite and plagioclase tectonite domains; and group D (Cr-rich <b>pyroxenites)</b> as composite layers along the recrystallization front, dykes in the spinel tectonites, and single layers in the other domains. The spinel KEY WORDS: Ronda peridotite; mafic layers; pyroxenites; subcontinental tectonite domain and group A layers represent the vestiges of an old, lithospheric mantle veined subcontinental lithosphere. The other mafic groups were formed during a later magmatic event that originated the present petrological zoning of the massif, and, in most cases, have replaced magmatic event that led to the diversity and zoning of mafic layers Layers, irregular bodies and dykes of mafic rocks, mainly was caused by melting of the base of thinned subcontinental <b>pyroxenites,</b> commonly occur in orogenic peridotite maslithospher...|$|R
