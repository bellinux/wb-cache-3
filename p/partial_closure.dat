Filming of the video involved a <b>partial</b> <b>closure</b> of the 2nd Street Tunnel and part of downtown Los Angeles spread out over a 48-hour period. Kesha explained the idea behind the video {{as well as the}} experience during an interview with MTV News; she said that the video was different from her other videos, noting {{that it was going to}} show a sexier side of herself.|$|E
5|$|In its time, Dunston B Power Station ranked {{consistently}} in England's leading stations, both {{in terms}} of thermal efficiency and cost per unit of electricity. However, the station eventually became outdated, and notification of its <b>partial</b> <b>closure</b> was given in October 1975, with some units being closed the following October. It was then only used as a stand-by station, operating only at peak electrical demand times. Finally, after some units having been in operation for about 40years, the station ceased to generate electricity on 26 October 1981. At the time of closure, only 98MW of the station's capacity was in use.|$|E
5|$|Pulmonic {{consonant}} {{letters are}} arranged singly or in pairs of voiceless (tenuis) and voiced sounds, with these then grouped in columns from front (labial) sounds {{on the left}} to back (glottal) sounds on the right. In official publications by the IPA, two columns are omitted to save space, with the letters listed among 'other symbols', and with the remaining consonants arranged in rows from full closure (occlusives: stops and nasals), to brief closure (vibrants: trills and taps), to <b>partial</b> <b>closure</b> (fricatives) and minimal closure (approximants), again with a row left out to save space. In the table below, a slightly different arrangement is made: All pulmonic consonants {{are included in the}} pulmonic-consonant table, and the vibrants and laterals are separated out so that the rows reflect the common lenition pathway of stop → fricative → approximant, as well as the fact that several letters pull double duty as both fricative and approximant; affricates may be created by joining stops and fricatives from adjacent cells. Shaded cells are judged to be implausible.|$|E

25|$|A major, nearly {{billion dollar}} {{expansion}} and improvements were {{undertaken by the}} county and airport authority in 1987 {{at the request of}} US Airways, which operated a hub there and took on major financing of the changes. The new facilities opened in 1992 and have been ranked highly by travelers and industry journals, with some of the design becoming a model for other airports. In the early 21st century, airlines struggled with changing financial conditions, and US Airways began scaling down its local operation, shifting to Philadelphia and Charlotte. It was carrying debt and was unable to negotiate the terms for lower landing fees at the airport. Its reduction in flights {{through the end of the}} decade resulted in the <b>partial</b> <b>closure</b> of two concourses.|$|E

25|$|A {{transport}} plan {{released by}} the New South Wales Government in 1998 reported that the line carried an average of 5000 passengers on weekdays. 2.8 million journeys were made in 2009-10, increasing to 4.2 million in 2012-13. The partial integration of the line into the broader Sydney ticketing system was a major driver of the increase. In the 12 months to June 2015, the line carried 6.1 million passengers, compared to 3.9 million passengers in the prior year. The increase in the 2014-15 figure {{was influenced by the}} opening of the extension to Dulwich Hill in March 2014, while the 2013-14 figure was affected by the suspension of services for much of October 2013 and closures for maintenance works. In the period from 2015-2016, 9.7 million journeys were made, followed by 9.1 million in 2016-2017. The 2016-2017 statistic was affected by a <b>partial</b> <b>closure</b> of the line in December 2016/January 2017 for construction works on the CBD and South East Light Rail.|$|E

The D.C. Historic Preservation Review Board refused to authorize these changes, but the renovation of the interior was approved.

30|$|The {{impact of}} water-conservation traits on lentil {{productivity}} {{is likely to}} vary across growing seasons with geography, environment type, and level of expression of the trait. The positive consequence of <b>partial</b> stomatal <b>closure</b> with soil drying or under high VPD is that transpiration rate is decreased early in the growing season {{so that there is}} conservation of soil water for use later in the season to complete reproductive growth. The initiation of soil water conservation will have the double benefit of increasing transpiration water use efficiency, and conserving soil water for use later in the growing season as drought develops in comparison with those plants that delay their stomatal closure [62]. If the period of water-deficit is sufficiently long, the plant genotype with <b>partial</b> stomatal <b>closure</b> with soil drying will be better position to sustain CO 2 assimilation and to produce greater yield. However, if there is late-season rainfall or if the decrease of photosynthetic rate due to <b>partial</b> stomatal <b>closure</b> is too high, the benefit of conserved water would not be obtained, thus, lines with water-conservation traits lead to equal or lower yield than line that does not express these traits [62]. Considering the breadth of geographical area and environments in which lentil is grown, the assessment of the potential benefits of the water-saving traits on lentil yield can only be done effectively by using crop simulation modeling.|$|R

30|$|This paper {{reviews the}} current status of {{research}} on traits that can alter the pattern of crop water use resulting in the possibility of yield increase of lentil under water-deficit conditions. For decades, two main topics have received much attention in that area that are developmental plasticity, and altered rooting and shoot characteristics. This review will briefly highlight investigations on individual traits that are either related to developmental plasticity (phenology) or below ground traits. Two additional water-conservation traits considered in this review that have been missing in lentil drought studies are initiation of <b>partial</b> stomatal <b>closure</b> early in the soil drying cycle, and <b>partial</b> stomatal <b>closure</b> at elevated atmospheric vapor pressure deficit. This review considers the opportunities for lentil yield increase in water-limited environments by addressing these two traits linked to temporal dynamics of water use.|$|R
40|$|A {{comprehensive}} {{theoretical model}} was formulated {{to study the}} development of convective burning in a solid propellant crack which continually deforms due to burning and pressure loading. In the theoretical model, the effect of interrelated structural deformation and combustion processes was taken into account by considering (1) transient, one dimensional mass, momentum, and energy conservation equations in the gas phase; (2) a transient, one dimensional heat conduction equation in the solid phase; and (3) quasi-static deformation of the two dimensional, linear viscoelastic propellant crack caused by pressure loading. <b>Partial</b> <b>closures</b> may generate substantial local pressure peaks along the crack, implying a strong coupling between chamber pressurization, crack combustion, and propellant deformation, especially when the cracks are narrow and the chamber pressurization rates high. The maximum pressure in the crack cavity is generally higher than that in the chamber. The initial flame-spreading process is not affected by propellant deformation...|$|R
