5|$|The {{climate of}} Buenos Aires is {{dominated}} by the semi–permanent South Atlantic High throughout the year. This brings in moist winds from the northeast, which brings most of the precipitation to the city. During winter, it brings in frontal systems responsible for precipitation in the city. In autumn and summer, it produces storms that are generally located north of the city and produces strong winds from the south or southeast that can occasionally lead to the swelling of the Río de la Plata, flooding coastal areas. The South Pacific High is the origin of polar air masses that are responsible for the coldest temperatures and result in clear and very dry conditions. These air masses originate from the South Pacific high and move in a northeastern direction during winter towards Buenos Aires by passing. Although it is polar maritime (this is a cool, moist air mass that forms from oceans located in the subarctic and arctic regions at the southern tip of South America), it becomes modified as it passes over the South American continent, becoming drier as it arrives at Buenos Aires. This is because as the cold air masses from the South Pacific High move over the Pacific Ocean and the Andes and reach the land south of 35oS (where the Andes are shorter in height), anticyclogenesis leads to the formation of a strong high pressure system {{in the center of the}} country (at around 40oS). This high pressure system brings cold and dry, <b>polar</b> <b>continental</b> air masses to Buenos Aires. Cold fronts are more common during winter than in summer as the South Atlantic and South Pacific highs are at their southernmost positions during summer, making it difficult for cold fronts to enter.|$|E

50|$|About 18,000 years ago, {{during the}} Pleistocene Epoch of the Quaternary Period (Cenozoic Era), {{the level of}} the Pacific Ocean was {{considerably}} lower than it is now (because more water was in the <b>polar</b> ice-caps and <b>continental</b> glaciers).

40|$|Changes in the {{physical}} properties of the atmosphere are caused by geographic influences and dynamic effects. The nature of {{the surface of the}} earth over which the air passes is usually the main factor in modifying the air in the lower levels of the troposphere. The ocean area of Hudson Bay in northeastern Canada presents an extensive surface for modification of air. <b>Continental</b> <b>polar</b> air crossing Hudson Bay and continuing into eastern Canada is modified not only by the underlying surface but also by the dynamic effects occurring in the atmosphere during its trajectory over these regions. The amount of modification is of major importance in the climate of the surrounding area, and in the meteorology of North American air masses. It was the purpose of this study: 1. To compute the changes in {{the physical}} properties that occur in <b>continental</b> <b>polar</b> air over Hudson Bay, Consequently, a project was undertaken to determine the amount of ice that forms on Hudson Bay in winter.

5000|$|In reality, the {{relative}} polar movement {{can either be}} <b>polar</b> wandering or <b>continental</b> drift (or a combination of both). [...] Data {{from around the globe}} are needed in order to isolate or distinguish between the two. Nevertheless, the magnetic poles rarely stray far from the geographic poles of the planet.

50|$|After {{a period}} in radar {{research}} during the World War II, he joined the Physics Department at the University of Manchester where he did research on aspects of the Earth's magnetic field, taking his Ph.D. under Patrick Blackett in 1949. This led to his interest in palaeomagnetism, {{the study of the}} magnetism of rocks, which he pursued first at the Geophysics Department at the University of Cambridge and later at Newcastle University, where he was appointed to the chair of Physics in 1956. At Newcastle Runcorn developed a strong research group in geophysics, and made substantial contributions to various fields, including convection in the Earth and Moon, the shape and magnetic fields of the Moon and planets, magnetohydrodynamics of the Earth's core, changes in the length of the day, <b>polar</b> wandering, <b>continental</b> drift and plate tectonics.|$|R
50|$|In polar areas, {{disconnected}} settlements {{are often}} more easily reached by snowmobile or dogsled in cold weather, which can produce sea ice that blocks ports, and bad weather that prevents flying. For example, resupply aircraft are only flown to Amundsen-Scott South Pole Station October to February, and many residents of coastal Alaska have bulk cargo shipped in only during the warmer months. Permanent darkness during the winter can also make long-distance travel more dangerous in <b>polar</b> areas. <b>Continental</b> road networks do reach into these areas, such as the Dalton Highway to the North Slope of Alaska, the R21 highway to Murmansk in Russia, and many roads in Scandinavia (though due to fjords water transport is sometimes faster). Large areas of Alaska, Canada, Greenland, and Siberia are sparsely connected. For example, all 25 communities of Nunavut are disconnected {{from each other and}} the main North American road network.|$|R
50|$|He later {{worked for}} the Canadian {{government}} with its <b>polar</b> <b>continental</b> shelf project {{as director of the}} polar shelf air supply program. In May 1961, Burry, and a team of scientists were missing for two days when their Otter aircraft, bound for an Arctic research project, crashed after relaying a distress signal. The men were located later by a civilian aircraft near Ellef Ringnes Island. In March 1962, Burry's aircraft again, this time a Beechcraft, went missing on a flight from Uranium City to Cambridge, Northwest Territories, along with another male. He reported that he was forced to make an emergency landing after running out of fuel during the flight, which was also complicated by a snowstorm. The Royal Canadian Air Force and Royal Canadian Mounted Police participated in search efforts. In 1965, Burry was still in the airline industry, this time serving as vice president of NorCanAir.|$|E
50|$|In 1958, Roots {{left the}} GSC {{to become the}} {{founding}} head of the Government of Canada's new <b>Polar</b> <b>Continental</b> Shelf Program (PCSP).

During his time with PCSP, Roots was {{a key part of the}} team that outlined the need for a permanent establishment to conduct research on the icefields of the Kluane National Park of southwest Yukon, part of the largest non-polar icefield in the world. In the years that followed, the Kluane Lake Research Station also became a hub for exploration across Canada's north, and Roots himself used it as a base from which to organize expditions through the Saint Elias Mountains, Canada's highest mountain range, as part of the Canadian Centennial celebrations in 1967. Roots served as head of PCSP for 14 years, until 1971, when he left to join what was to eventually become Environment Canada.|$|E

50|$|In {{the post-war}} years the Hydrographic Survey {{continued}} its {{work with an}} expanded mandate. The entry of Newfoundland and Labrador into Confederation in 1949 saw the Survey's charting activities extended to the new coasts. As the air defence of Canada became of paramount importance in the fifties the Survey extended its research, to the Canadian Arctic, especially between 1954 and 1957 and charted routes for the ships carrying the supplies necessary to build the long range radar stations of the DEW Line. Arctic survey activity was further accelerated starting in 1959, {{the first year of}} the <b>Polar</b> <b>Continental</b> Shelf survey. The Fisheries Research Board continued its excellent work after the war and up until 1979 when it was disbanded as the result of government reorganization and its responsibilities passed to other organizations. The defence activities of the NRC during the war years, including anti-submarine warfare research were spun off and handed to the newly created Defence Research Board in 1947. That organization established research facilities in Halifax, Nova Scotia and Esquimalt, British Columbia to conduct studies in support of the ASW mission of the Royal Canadian Navy. Research activities focused on physical oceanography as it related to the transmission of sound underwater, including ocean temperature, salinity, currents, tides, surface noise and biological sound sources.|$|E

40|$|A {{fuzzy logic}} {{classification}} (FLC) methodology is proposed {{to achieve the}} two goals of this paper: 1) to discriminate between clear sky and clouds in a 32 3 32 pixel array, or sample, of 1. 1 -km Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) data, and 2) if clouds are present, to discriminate between single-layered and multilayered clouds within the sample. To achieve these goals, eight FLC modules are derived that are based broadly on airmass type and surface type (land or water) : equatorial over land, marine tropical over land, marine tropical/equatorial over water, continental tropical over land, marine polar over land, marine <b>polar</b> over water, <b>continental</b> <b>polar</b> over land, and continental polar/arctic over water.
