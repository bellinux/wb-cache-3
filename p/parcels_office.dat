5|$|The last {{remaining}} station building, the old <b>parcels</b> <b>office,</b> is threatened with demolition by Network Rail, {{which owns the}} station. Network Rail states that the building is beyond economic repair, but local rail campaigners, including Friends of Suburban Bristol Railways and MP Charlotte Leslie, have petitioned to prevent the demolition.|$|E
5|$|By the mid-1920s, {{the station}} was proving {{inadequate}} for the passenger numbers, and so work began on a comprehensive rebuild in 1926. The new buildings were made of brick; with a large, four-chimneyed building containing most of the facilities; {{as well as a}} separate <b>parcels</b> <b>office.</b> The northern platform had a wooden awning built, which is still in place today.|$|E
25|$|The first {{contract}} for the station buildings was awarded to Edward Wood and Sons of Derby on 23 January 1903, who were also awarded the {{contract for}} the buildings on platforms 1 and 2 on 16 September 1903. The {{contract for the}} buildings on platforms 4 and 5 was awarded to Kirk, Knight & Co of Sleaford on 18 June 1903, who were also responsible for building the <b>parcels</b> <b>office</b> (Forward House) on Station Street, which opened in November 1903. The structural steelwork and cast-ironwork was done by Handyside & Co. and the Phoenix Foundry, both of Derby.|$|E

50|$|This {{plan was}} never completed, {{although}} partial platforms were erected at St Peters and Erskineville in preparation. Because of this, Bankstown line trains continue {{to run on}} the same tracks as East Hills services, and the Bankstown line's junction with the Illawarra line has been merely moved from the south of Sydenham station to the north. The construction of Platform 1 included a brick <b>parcel</b> <b>office</b> on {{the northern end of}} the platform. One of the few free-standing <b>parcel</b> <b>offices</b> on the Sydney network, it was in service until the 1980s. Now closed, the building itself remains standing.|$|R
5000|$|In 1991 once {{restoration}} {{had been}} completed, the station's former <b>parcel</b> <b>office</b> {{as well as}} the carriage were let out as holiday accommodation and as a venue for parties. The station was subsequently Grade II listed.|$|R
25|$|These {{were the}} basic soldiers' camps, {{made up of}} wooden barrack huts 10m wide and 50m long, covered with tar on the outside. Each hut held around 250 prisoners. A central {{corridor}} provided access on each side to bunk beds, with straw- or sawdust-filled palliasses. Furniture was kept to a minimum, and generally limited to a table, chairs or benches and a stove. The camps also included barracks for guards, a Kantine (cafeteria) where prisoners could sometimes buy small luxuries and supplementary food, a <b>parcels</b> <b>office,</b> a guardhouse, and kitchens. Some camps had additional amenities, including sanitary facilities, or cultural facilities such as a library, a theatre/concert hall, or a space for worship.|$|E
25|$|The {{building}} was given Grade II protection as a listed building on 25 September 1972. However, in 1973 a plan by the Midlands Postal Board to demolish {{the building and}} replace it with a high rise scheme by R. Seifert and Partners was granted permission. After a seven-year campaign by the Victorian Society, joined in 1976 by the Green Ban Action Committee, led by Pete Carter, the {{building was}} saved from demolition. The Victorian Society broke new ground in conservation tactics by submitting for planning permission an alternative scheme which retained the post office. The postal board adopted this scheme as a basis for the future development of the site. The future development involved the demolition of the red brick sorting office at the rear of building. The adjacent <b>parcels</b> <b>office</b> which was connected by a link bridge over Hill Street was also demolished, and was replaced in 1985 by One Victoria Square, designed by Watkins Grey Woodgate International. The preservation of the Post Office was one of the first and most important victories for architectural conservation by the Victorian Society.|$|E
25|$|Pickering {{railway station}} {{is the current}} {{terminus}} of the railway and serves the busy market town of Pickering. The station has been restored to its 1937 condition {{with help from the}} Heritage Lottery Fund. Original fixtures and fittings have been installed in the Booking Office and <b>Parcels</b> <b>Office,</b> {{as well as in the}} Tea Room. A park-and-ride service is provided to keep traffic out of the town during busy periods. The station is home to the railway's carriage workshops, and there is also a turntable. Originally the station had an overall roof designed by the architect G.T. Andrews. This roof was removed by British Railways in 1952 due to corrosion. A replacement roof was fitted to the station between January - April 2011, as part of the NYMR's Train of Thought project. Other work includes a Learning Centre and a Visitor Centre behind the down platform. Originally, the line continued south of Pickering to join the Malton to Scarborough Line at Rillington Junction but this track has since been lifted with the last trip to Malton running on 1 July 1966, the day the freight services were withdrawn.|$|E
50|$|Railway {{facilities}} {{no longer}} needed for goods traffic disappeared. The station building at Weihmichl was demolished in September 1974 and the linesman's hut (Wartehäuschen) at Arth in February 1975. On 31 January 1982 the ticket and <b>parcels</b> <b>offices</b> at Rottenburg station were closed.|$|R
50|$|Solapur {{railway station}} has {{computerized}} reservation counters, Railtel Wifi, Public Call Office booth with {{subscriber trunk dialling}} facilities, AC & non-AC waiting room, retiring room, luggage porters, clock room, bio toilet, ATVM, QOVM, PRS, UTS, TSBE, CCTV cameras, <b>parcel</b> <b>office,</b> foot over bridges, dormitory room, vegetarian and non-vegetarian refreshment stalls and book stall.|$|R
50|$|By November 1941, Fowler {{was acting}} as a {{distributor}} of Red Cross parcels. During his time in captivity Fowler had been making a bogus German uniform out of various bits of material and a civilian suit, smuggling them into the <b>parcel</b> <b>office</b> which was situated outside the main prisoner's compound. On 5 November 1941, he dressed in his bogus German uniform from the <b>parcel</b> <b>office</b> and climbed over the lightly guarded perimeter fence. Outside the camp he changed into his civilian suit. He managed to reach Sassnitz and attempted to stow away on a Swedish ship; but whilst at the docks he was arrested by a German policeman. He was returned to Stalag Luft I and sentenced to 14 days solitary confinement, before being transferred to the 'escape proof' camp Oflag IV-C at Colditz Castle, arriving on 1 December 1941.|$|R
500|$|When the {{railways}} were nationalised in 1948, services at Avonmouth Dock {{came under the}} aegis of the Western Region of British Railways. By 1955, service levels had decreased slightly to 28 trains per day from Bristol and 29 return, but the services were at regular intervals. Passenger numbers however dropped sharply in 1961 as the result of a fare increase, and so in 1962 a new reduced timetable was enacted, which lost more passengers. A year later in 1963, the Beeching report suggested the complete withdrawal of services along the line, but ultimately only those beyond Severn Beach or via Henbury were withdrawn. Goods services from the station ended on 20 June 1966, the same day that the station was renamed [...] "Avonmouth". The bay platform was taken out of use and the land later taken for industrial buildings. From 17 July 1967 all staffing was withdrawn from stations along the line, including Avonmouth, with tickets issued by the train guard. The station buildings on the island platform survived into the 1970s, as did the footbridge, but with the exception of the <b>parcels</b> <b>office,</b> all were later demolished. The <b>parcels</b> <b>office</b> was in use in 2006 as a hairdressing salon. The signal box was closed in January 1969, and in September 1973 the wooden level crossing gates were replaced by automatic lifting barriers. By 1974, service had reduced to 19 trains per day in each direction, with no Sunday services to Severn Beach.|$|E
2500|$|Offices {{were built}} {{at the north end}} of the [...] long {{carriageway}} rooftop. A large <b>parcels</b> <b>office</b> was built to the south of the main buildings. Two footbridges connected the platforms, the one to the north for passengers, the one to the south for station staff and parcels. The tracks were covered by two overall roofs. The older and larger spanned platforms 5 and 6, and an identical structure can still be viewed today at Bath Green Park railway station; the other platforms 1 and 2. Wartime damage put the roofs beyond economic repair; hence, they were removed in the autumn of 1956 and replaced by low-level awnings.|$|E
2500|$|The 13th-century flint-stone castle keep sits upon a [...] high motte {{overlooking}} the {{town on the}} banks of the River Stour. Parts of the inner and outer baileys still exist. The castle is part of the Clare Castle Country Park which has the distinction of containing the only (now decommissioned) railway station built within a castle in the UK. The station was built by the Great Eastern Railway on the Stour Valley Railway and closed in 1967. The complex of stationmaster's house, ticket and <b>parcels</b> <b>office,</b> waiting rooms, platforms and goods shed has been listed, as the only complete set of 1865 GER buildings to survive intact. The park has [...] of landscaped parkland, interlaced with water in the old moats. [...] The Stour Valley Path crosses the park.|$|E
50|$|Yemen is not {{a natural}} {{provider}} of office supplies to organisations such as synagogues in the Chicago area. Therefore, you might fondly imagine that the staff in the <b>parcels</b> <b>offices</b> in the capital, Sana'a, might have checked the despatches more closely before allowing them anywhere near an aircraft, cargo or passengers. But they didn't.|$|R
50|$|Sefton station {{opened on}} 19 October 1924 when the Lidcombe to Regent's Park line was {{extended}} to Cabrammatta {{to become part of}} the Main South line. The station building is of a characteristic standard design from the 1920s and 1930s. The station was further expanded in the following years, with booking and <b>parcels</b> <b>offices</b> installed on the footbridge in 1928.|$|R
50|$|Early 1915 the HPD was re-organisation {{and came}} under the direct {{management}} of the RE (PS). Maj CA Wheeler RE was appointed the Officer Commanding in February. A second ALO (ALO 2) was opened in GPO Mount Pleasant and the <b>parcel</b> <b>office</b> was also moved there. As the BEF grew larger and new fronts were opened in the Middle East so the volume of mail grew.|$|R
2500|$|The station {{building}} {{is similar in}} style to that at [...] Access was had through a three-arch portico entrance {{which led to a}} passageway to the up platform, a large <b>parcels</b> <b>office</b> and the booking office. The southern end of the station comprised the stationmaster's quarters and the ladies' waiting room. Twin facing platforms were provided; a general waiting room, storeroom, stationmaster's office and porter's room were located on the up platform. The platforms were initially covered by a roof which was subsequently replaced after the Second World War. A signal box was situated on the up side next to the road crossing to the north-west of the station. Behind the up platform lay a goods yard with a loading dock, goods shed capable to taking 9 wagons which also served as a grain store and a 15-ton crane. The shed and crane were destroyed during a bombing raid in the Second World War, which led to Alford's only wartime casualty: the shunt horse driver who was on fire watch in the yard.|$|E

50|$|The station {{suffered}} bomb damage {{during the}} Manchester Blitz in World War II. On 23 December 1940, several bombs hit the station destroying the <b>parcels</b> <b>office,</b> {{and a large}} part of the roof over platforms 12 to 16. The <b>parcels</b> <b>office</b> was rebuilt, but the damaged parts of the roof were taken down and not replaced. The station came into the ownership of British Railways in 1948.|$|E
50|$|The station buffet, now privately managed and {{licensed}} serves refreshments, including teas {{and real}} ales, and is fitted out in 'steam era' style. Other {{parts of the}} building unused by the railway are now used for local interest groups - the <b>parcel</b> <b>office</b> is now an arts centre run by MIND mental health charity, {{and other parts of}} the building are used by Bridlington Model Railway Society.|$|R
50|$|The last {{member of}} staff {{to work at the}} station was {{withdrawn}} in 1988. Today the old booking <b>office</b> and <b>parcel</b> <b>office</b> is occupied by a small newsagents, and the remaining station facilities are disused; but the main access to the trains is still via the octagonal booking hall. The line was singled in 1975 and all trains now use the former up platform.|$|R
5000|$|The Home Postal Depot (HPD) {{was formed}} on 10 August 1914, {{but on a}} very ad-hoc affair, under the {{administration}} of the GPO. [...] A letter sorting office (Army Letter Office 1 - ALO1) and a <b>parcel</b> <b>office</b> were established in the GPO King Edward Building, London. It soon became apparent that the facilities were inadequate to cope with the volumes of mail being sent to the British Expeditionary Force (BEF) in France.|$|R
50|$|In July 1939, an Irish Republican Army bomb {{exploded}} at the station, wrecking the <b>parcels</b> <b>office</b> area.|$|E
5000|$|Commercial Real Estate {{develops}} {{and sells}} commercial properties, including retail properties, multifamily <b>parcels,</b> <b>office</b> parks and commerce parks.|$|E
5000|$|The station {{had four}} platforms. The main {{building}} with booking office and <b>parcels</b> <b>office</b> was {{located on the}} west side of the railway and the platforms were linked by a raised footbridge.|$|E
5000|$|Late in 1916 the HPD {{moved to}} a purpose built wooden {{building}} (200,000 sq ft) on Chester Road, Regent's Park. This new facility contained the HPD administration <b>offices,</b> a large <b>parcel</b> <b>office</b> and ALO2 both of which moved from GPO Mount Pleasant. [...] ALO2 {{was responsible for the}} processing of mails to all theatres except BEF. ALO 1 (handling the BEF mails) remained in GPO King Edward Building {{for the duration of the}} war.|$|R
50|$|Late in 1916 the Home Postal Depot, Royal Engineers {{moved to}} a purpose built wooden {{building}} (200,000 sq ft) on Chester Road, Regent’s Park. This new facility contained the Home Postal Depot administration <b>offices,</b> a large <b>parcel</b> <b>office</b> and army letter office both of which moved from GPO Mount Pleasant. HM King George V and HM Queen Mary visited Home Postal Depot at Regent’s Park on 11 December 1916. The Depot vacated the premises in early 1920.|$|R
50|$|Other {{facilities}} available are <b>Parcel</b> booking <b>office,</b> Railway Mailing service (RMS) office, State Bank of India and Canara Bank Automated teller machine (ATMs).|$|R
50|$|The Railway Printing Company {{is based}} in the old <b>parcels</b> <b>office</b> within the main building. From here they supply tickets printed on their old Edmondson railway ticket press to the WSR and many other {{heritage}} lines.|$|E
50|$|On 17 August 1956. a rake of {{carriages}} {{ran away}} and collided with another rake of carriages and a parcels van. The van was {{pushed into the}} <b>parcels</b> <b>office,</b> bringing down its roof, which crushed two cars.|$|E
50|$|Despite the cutbacks, {{the station}} was rebuilt in 1965, with the ground floor at street level and the first floor at {{platform}} level, providing a booking hall, toilets, waiting rooms, stationmaster's office, <b>parcels</b> <b>office</b> and left luggage office.|$|E
50|$|Witney {{goods station}} served the Oxfordshire town of Witney on the Oxford, Witney and Fairford Railway. It {{consisted}} of seven sidings, a goods shed, a wooden <b>parcel</b> <b>office</b> and a cattle dock. It {{also had an}} engine shed, which was demolished early in the twentieth century. Following {{the opening of the}} East Gloucestershire Railway in 1873, the station became a goods depot, with passengers using the second station situated to the south. The original station remained open to goods traffic until 1970.|$|R
50|$|By the 1930s, the Gympie Railway Station Complex {{had evolved}} {{into one of}} Queensland’s most {{substantial}} and busy railway complexes. In 1963 a new ticket and <b>parcel</b> <b>office</b> was built within the former parking area adjoining the subway entrance (where the Gympie Family History Society is now located). For over a century the station complex was intrinsically linked to the economy of Gympie and surrounding areas and {{played an important role}} in Queensland’s rail network however by the end of the 1980s it had become mostly redundant.|$|R
5|$|The {{station was}} rebuilt {{in the early}} 1930s to enable the line to be four-tracked. The ornate {{buildings}} were demolished, and were replaced by more austere buildings on two island platforms between the tracks, including two waiting rooms, ticket and <b>parcel</b> <b>offices.</b> The new station was completed on 30 April 1932 and was accessed, as now, by a subway from Fraser Street. The station employed 15 men in 1938. There was a 74 lever signal box {{to the east of}} the northern platform, and also a small siding to serve local coal merchants.|$|R
