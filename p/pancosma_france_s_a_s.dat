40|$|The early postpartal {{period is}} {{characterized}} by marked changes in hormonal, metabolic, and immune/stress-like conditions all of which may contribute to regulating dry matter intake (DMI) and the supply of nutrients to mammary gland. Peripartal cows are in negative Methionine (M) balance due to increased requirements of tissues and cells for methylated compounds and M for milk protein production. Therefore, supplementation of rumen-protected M during the peripartal period may improve yield of milk and protein, and also help coordinate immunometabolic adaptations of the cow. Twenty four multiparous Holstein cows were fed a control diet (ME, n = 8; 1. 47 Mcal/kg DM prepartum and 1. 67 Mcal/kg DM postpartum), ME plus MetaSmart (MS, n = 8; ADISSEO <b>France</b> <b>S.</b> <b>A.</b> <b>S.),</b> or ME plus Smartamine M® (SA, n = 8; ADISSEO <b>France</b> <b>S.</b> <b>A.</b> <b>S.).</b> All cows received a common diet (1. 24 Mcal/kg DM) during the far-off period [- 50 to - 21 days in milk (DIM) ]. Treatments started at - 21 DIM and continued through 30 DIM. MetaSmart (0. 19 % of DM prepartum and 0. 18 % of DM postpartum) and SA (0. 07 % of DM prepartum and postpartum) were top-dressed on the ME diet. Blood samples were collected at - 21, - 10, 7, 14, and 21 DIM for profiling of 21 markers of liver function, metabolism, oxidative stress, and inflammation. Concentration of cholesterol (CHOL) and the negative acute-phase protein albumin (ALB) decreased (time P < 0. 05) around calving but increased by 21 DIM regardless of treatment. Paraoxonase concentration followed a similar pattern (time P < 0. 01) as CHOL and ALB. Whereas glutamic-oxaloacetic transaminase (GOT) concentration increased (time P < 0. 01) from - 10 through 21 DIM regardless of treatment, bilirubin (BIL) increased between - 10 and 7 DIM and then decreased through 21 DIM. However, the increase in BIL tended (treatment × time P = 0. 09) to be lower in cows fed SA. Those responses were indicative of alterations in liver function particularly after calving. The concentration of haptoglobin, inflammation marker, did not change markedly at 7 vs. - 21 or - 10 DIM and decreased gradually by 21 DIM regardless of treatment. However, cows fed ME tended (P = 0. 09) to have greater overall ceruloplasmin concentration due to markedly greater (treatment × time P = 0. 03) concentration at - 10 DIM. That response was suggestive of a more pronounced inflammatory-like status precalving. Despite an increase (time P < 0. 01) in concentration after calving, reactive-oxygen metabolite concentration did not differ between treatments. Overall, preliminary data provide some evidence that M supplementation during the peripartal period could ameliorate inflammatory-like conditions characteristic of this period. As such, M {{may play a role}} in stimulating DMI after calving and promoting normal milk production...|$|R

In the national context this typically involves the analyses of {{the correlation between the}} returns on national stock market sectors. But internationally this task turns to be more difficult because we have to analyze the relationships between returns on different and distant international markets. Erb, Harvey and Viskant (1994) and Longin and Solnik (1995) have shown that these correlations vary over time according to phases in the economic cycles.

METHODS: Agar containing 2 mg/L tetracycline was used for the isolation of tetracycline-resistant organisms. A genomic library in Escherichia coli was used to isolate the tetracycline resistance determinant. In-frame deletions and chromosomal repair were used to confirm function. Antibiotic susceptibility was determined by agar dilution and disc diffusion assay. RESULTS: The tetracycline resistance determinant from S. australis FRStet 12 was isolated from a genomic library in E. coli and DNA sequencing showed two open reading frames predicted to encode proteins with similarity to multidrug resistance-type ABC transporters. Both genes were required for tetracycline resistance (to both the naturally occurring and semi-synthetic tetracyclines) and they were designated tetAB(46).

It has spread via ballast water and/or intentional introduction to Continental Europe, Southern <b>France,</b> U. <b>S.</b> <b>A.</b> (San Francisco Bay) and the United Kingdom. Analysis of detailed historic data from the outbreak in Europe was digitised and analysed using Geographical Information Software. This revealed {{that there were two}} separate invasions in Northern Europe and Southern France, with an average range expansion during the peak period of 562 km/year from 1928 – 1938 (Northern Europe) and 380 km/year from 1954 – 1960 in Southern France. Size class distribution data from the lower estuary of the River Elbe (Germany) (1932 – 1936) illustrate migration patterns to and from the estuary over the year. Marking experiments determined that the mean rate of downstream migration for adults was 11. 5 km/day (SD 3. 54; n= 7), up to a maximum of 18. 1 km/day. The carapace width of upstream-migrating animals increased by 3 mm/ 100 km. The peak period for upstream migration was March to July, followed by the downstream season from July to September.

With the active {{participation}} of our Scientific Advisory Board {{we were able to}} prepare a programme where leading scientists from European and non-European countries presented their latest results on drug delivery systems. Furthermore, a poster session was organised to allow researchers to present and discuss their results in this rapidly developing and exciting area. Speakers at the symposium included pharmaceutical scientists, polymer scientists, bioengineers, biochemists and pharmacologists. The topics of the symposium were selected to provide a high level multidisciplinary programme, where participants with different backgrounds had an opportunity to learn about the latest developments in the drug delivery area. These topics were: novel macromolecular and supra-molecular materials for drug delivery; novel drug delivery systems; pharmaco-economics of therapies involving controlled release dosage forms; new therapeutic approaches based on controlled drug delivery.
