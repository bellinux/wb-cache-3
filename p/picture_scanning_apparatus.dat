The apparatus consists of a four-degree-of-freedom hybrid spherical linkage capable of moving the dental mold relative to a laser scanner along a curved path in the specified orientations. Since closed form inverse kinematics solutions are not available for the multiple degree-of-freedom spatial mechanism in question, symbolic and numerical computation techniques are used extensively for kinematics analysis, dimension design, and optimization.

Radioisotope gauges have been used for this type of measurements for more than 50 years, and is still widely used. Data is normally recorded for subsequent off-line analysis. Often multiple measurements are carried out in a scan for instance by manually lowering a source down one side of a vessel and a detector down the other to build up a vertical density profile.

40|$|A {{new method}} for {{positioning}} of {{the tip of a}} scanning tunneling microscope by means of capacitance displacement sensors has been developed and tested. As a result, a three dimensional <b>scan</b> <b>apparatus</b> for SXM has been constructed, in which by direct measurement of the displacement along the three axes deviations due to the hystereses, creepage and non-linearity of the piezo actuators could be clearly reduced. Experiments conducted on this apparatus revealed the occurrence of hystereses not only at linear but also at angular displacements. Such angular displacements in x-y direction can be compensated by additional actuators.

40|$|The paper {{illustrates}} the damage evolution observed in carboresin specimens {{with a central}} hole subjected to cyclic tensile loading. Damage monitoring was conducted via a purpose-designed automatic Ultrasonic (US) <b>scanning</b> <b>apparatus,</b> whose responses were qualified by means of micrographical observations. Observed delamination onset and growth are discussed {{with reference to the}} results of three-dimensional finite element analyses. In particular, a model simulating the presence of delaminations and their partial closure through non-linear contact calculations is employed in order to evaluate the distribution of the energy release rates along the delamination boundaries. The results indicate that the observed evolution of delamination may be explained by numerical models, provided that closure effects are taken into account...|$|R

40|$|During {{the last}} ten years patents {{directed}} to luggage <b>scanning</b> <b>apparatus</b> began to appear in the patent art. Absent from the variety of approaches in the art is stereoscopic imaging that entails exposing two or more images of the same object, each taken from a slightly different perspective. If the perspectives are too different, that is. if there is too much separation of the X-ray exposures, the image will look flat. Yet with a slight separation, a stereo separation, interference occurs. Herein a system is provided for the production of stereo pairs. One perspective, a left or a right perspective angle, is first established. Next, the other perspective angle is computed. Using these left and right perspectives the X-ray sources can then be spaced away from each other...|$|R
40|$|Larger-scale {{production}} of thermoelectric materials is necessary when mass-producing thermoelectric devices at industrial level. Certain fabrication techniques can create inhomogeneity {{in the material}} through composition and doping fluctuations throughout the sample, causing local variations in thermoelectric properties. Some variations {{are in the range}} of sub-millimeter scale or larger but may be difficult to detect by traditional materials characterization techniques such as x-ray diffraction or scanning electron microscopy when the chemical variation is small but the doping variation, which strongly affects thermoelectric performance, is large. In this paper, a <b>scanning</b> <b>apparatus</b> to directly detect local variations of Seebeck coefficient on both bulk and thin-film samples is used. Results have shown that this technique can be utilized for detection of defective regions, as well as phase separation in the 100 -μm range or larger...|$|R
40|$|Lateral or transaxial {{truncation}} of cone-beam {{data can}} occur either {{due to the}} field of view limitation of the <b>scanning</b> <b>apparatus</b> or iregion-of-interest tomography. In this paper, we Suggest two new methods to handle lateral truncation in helical scan CT. It is seen that reconstruction with laterally truncated projection data, assuming it to be complete, gives severe artifacts which even penetrates in{{to the field of}} view. A row-by-row data completion approach using linear prediction is introduced for helical scan truncated data. An extension of this technique known as windowed linear prediction approach is introduced. Efficacy of the two techniques are shown using simulation with standard phantoms. A quantitative image quality measure of the resulting reconstructed images are used to evaluate the performance of the proposed methods against an extension of a standard existing technique...|$|R

40|$|Abstract To {{view and}} {{understand}} the visual world, we shift our gaze from one location to another about three times per second. These rapid changes in gaze direction result from very fast eye movements called saccades. Visual information is acquired only during fixations, stationary periods between saccades. Active visual search of pictures {{is the process of}} active scanning of the visual environment for a particular target among distracters or for the extraction of its meaning. This article discusses a cognitive model of saliency, overt attention, and natural <b>picture</b> <b>scanning</b> that unravels the neurocomputational mechanisms of how human gaze control operates during active real-world scene viewing...|$|R

Improvements in visual-motor, visual-verbal, behavioral, and spatial cognitive tasks were observed to last up to 5 weeks after a twice-daily, two-week prism adaptation program. The standard tests included visual motor tasks such as line cancellation, line bisection and drawing by copying or memory. The visual-verbal tasks included object description, object naming and word reading. The behavioral tests included <b>picture</b> <b>scanning,</b> telephone dialing, menu and article reading, address and sentence copying, telling and setting the time, coin and card sorting and map navigation tests. The spatial cognition tests included the room description test and an object reaching test.|$|R
40|$|Magnetic {{resonance}} imaging (MRI) {{is an essential}} medical tool with inherently slow data acquisition process. Slow acquisition process requires patient to be long time exposed to <b>scanning</b> <b>apparatus.</b> In recent years significant efforts are made towards the applying Compressive Sensing technique to the acquisition process of MRI and biomedical images. Compressive Sensing is an emerging theory in signal processing. It aims {{to reduce the amount}} of acquired data required for successful signal reconstruction. Reducing the amount of acquired image coefficients leads to lower acquisition time, i. e. time of exposition to the MRI apparatus. Using optimization algorithms, satisfactory image quality can be obtained from the small set of acquired samples. A number of optimization algorithms for the reconstruction of the biomedical images is proposed in the literature. In this paper, three commonly used optimization algorithms are compared and results are presented on the several MRI images...|$|R
5000|$|... 240-line versus 405-line {{television}} broadcasts. In 1936, the BBC Television Service commenced {{television broadcasting}} from Alexandra Palace in North London. They began by using two different television standards broadcasting on alternate weeks. The 240-line Baird sequential system was broadcast using a mechanically <b>scanned</b> <b>apparatus.</b> In the intervening weeks, EMI-Marconi broadcast in 405 line interlaced using fully electronic cameras. Early sets had to support both systems, adding to their complexity. It was the BBC's intention {{to run the}} two systems side by side for a six-month trial to determine which would be finally adopted. The BBC quickly discovered that the fully electronic EMI system had a superior picture quality and less flicker, and the camera equipment was much more mobile and transportable (Baird's intermediate-film cameras had to be bolted to the studio floor as they required a water supply and drainage). The trial concluded after only three months after Baird's studios lost most of their equipment in a fire.|$|R

40|$|Based on a two-component descriptor, a {{distance}} label for each point, it is shown that Euclidean distance maps {{can be generated}} by effective sequential algorithms. The map indicates, for each pixel in the objects (or the background) of the originally binary picture, the shortest distance to the nearest pixel in the background (or the objects). A map with negligible errors can be produced in two <b>picture</b> <b>scans</b> which has to include forward and backward movement for each line. Thus, for expanding/shrinking purposes it may compete very successfully with iterative parallel propagation in the binary picture itself. It is shown that skeletons can be produced by simple procedures and since these are based on Euclidean distances {{it is assumed that}} they are superior to skeletons based on d 4 -, ds-, and even octagonal metrics...|$|R

Now for the first time I would see what I had devised 45 years ago. Finally I reached the front row; a dark cloth was pushed to the side, and I saw before me a flickering image, not easy to discern."
