40|$|Background: Anxiety {{disorders}} occur commonly in schizophrenia but {{are often}} overlooked by psychiatrists. Their presence may compound the {{challenges faced by}} these patients and may contribute to poor outcome. Objectives: The {{purpose of this study}} was to determine the prevalence of anxiety disorders among the participants with schizophrenia, and the association between this co-morbidity and disability. Method: A total of 367 participants were recruited from the out-patient department of Federal neuropsychiatric hospital Enugu, Nigeria. Socio-demographic questionnaire, schedules for clinical assessment in neuropsychiatry, positive and neg-ative syndrome scale and the 12 -item version of the World Health Organization disability assessment schedule were administered. Results: A total of 189 females (51. 5 %) and 178 (48. 5 %) males were studied. A lifetime prevalence of 12. 3 % was re-ported for anxiety disorder. Anxiety disorder was more likely in females (κ= 4. 93, p< 0. 03). Specific prevalence for anxiety disorder in schizophrenia was generalized anxiety disorder 6. 3 %, obsessive compulsive disorder 3. 3 %, and <b>phobic</b> <b>anxiety</b> <b>disorder</b> 2. 7 %. Anxiety disorder was associated with increased disability (t= 3. 50, p< 0. 001) and psychopathology (t= 3. 40, p< 0. 001) among the participants studied. Phobias were associated with prescription of low doses of antipsychotics (κ= 4. 08, p< 0. 04). There was a low rate of identification of anxiety disorder in routine clinical practice (k= 0. 08, p< 0. 001) ...|$|E
40|$|Objective: Disease {{severity}} in the {{irritable bowel syndrome}} (IBS) {{is highly}} influenced by psychiatric comorbidity. The mechanism of this influence is generally unknown, even if the brain-gut axis seems to be involved. Recent {{research has indicated that}} IBS patients have aberrant perception of visceral stimuli in the CNS. We compared IBS patients with and without comorbid phobic anxiety to see if the comorbid disorder influenced brain information processing of auditory stimuli, and looked for possible consequences with respect to visceral sensitivity thresholds and disease severity. Methods: Eleven female patients with IBS with comorbid <b>phobic</b> <b>anxiety</b> <b>disorder</b> were compared with 22 age-matched female IBS patients without such comorbidity. The groups were compared with respect to event-related potentials (ERP), auditory-presented words with emotional contents, barostat-assessed visceral sensitivity thresholds, and symptom levels the last week before assessment. Results: The comorbid group had a significantly enhanced first negative ERP wave (N 1) to all stimuli, indicating increased use of brain attentional resources. It also had increased visceral threshold for the sensation of gas, and reduced gas-stool and gas-discomfort tolerances compared with the noncomorbid group. Enhanced N 1 amplitude at the frontal electrode and reduced gas-stools tolerance significantly predicted subjective gas complaints, explaining 47 % of the symptom variation. Conclusions: The study suggests an association between information processing in the frontal brain and visceral sensitivity characteristics in IBS patients, and indicates that subjective disease-related symptomatology is predicted by brain perceptual characteristics. The findings indicate that an interaction between IBS-related and anxiety-related hyperreactivity in the frontal brain may constitute a psychophysiological mechanism for the contribution of psychiatric comorbidity to severity and duration of the irritable bowel syndrome.

The theoretical part outlines the actual field of neurotic symptoms. Its introductory chapters are based on the definition of the term "neurotic," which is "related to or resulting from neurosis. Individual neurotic and stress-related disorders are described here according to the MKN [...] 10 classification, i. e. <b>phobic</b> <b>anxiety</b> <b>disorders,</b> including agoraphobia, social phobia and specific (isolated) phobias, as well as other <b>anxiety</b> <b>disorders,</b> which include panic <b>disorder,</b> generalized <b>anxiety</b> <b>disorder</b> and mixed <b>anxiety</b> and depressive <b>disorder.</b> Apart from <b>phobic</b> <b>anxiety</b> <b>disorders</b> this thesis also deals with obsessive-compulsive disorders, reactions to severe stress and adjustment disorders (acute reaction to stress and post-traumatic stress-related disorder).

Here I deal mainly with the physiology and manifestations of stress. Because neurotic disorders are examples of a connection between the physical and the mental, the last part is focused on psychosomatics. Psychosomatics is described here as a science and somatoform disorders are also described according to MKN [...] 10. The conclusion to the theoretical part of the thesis, which is aimed at particular neurotic symptoms, is divided into two parts, the first one being neurotic symptoms manifested by a mental scheme and the second one neurotic symptoms manifested by a physical scheme.

40|$|Citalopram is a chiral {{antidepressant}} drug. Its eutomer, S-citalopram (escitalopram), {{has recently}} been introduced as an antidepressant. In an open pilot study, four outpatients and two inpatients with a major depressive episode (ICD- 10), and who were nonresponders to a 4 -week pretreatment with 40 - 60 mg/day citalopram, were comedicated for another 4 -week period with carbamazepine (200 - 400 mg/day). Some of the patients suffered also from comorbidities: <b>Phobic</b> <b>anxiety</b> <b>disorder</b> with panic attacks (n= 2), generalised anxiety disorder, alcohol abuse, dependent personality disorder, hypertension (n= 1). After a 4 -week augmentation therapy with carbamazepine, a significant (P< 0. 03) decrease of the plasma concentrations of S-citalopram and R-citalopram, by 27 and 31 %, respectively, was observed. Apparently, the probable induction of CYP 3 A 4 by carbamazepine results in a nonstereoselective increase in N-demethylation of citalopram. Moreover, {{there was a significant}} (P< 0. 03) decrease of the ratio S/R-citalopram propionic acid derivative, the formation of it being partly regulated by MAO-A and MAO-B. Already, within 1 week after addition of carbamazepine, there was a slight but significant (P< 0. 03) decrease of the MADRS depression scores, from 27. 0 +/- 7. 7 (mean+/-S. D.) to 23. 3 +/- 6. 6, and the final score on day 56 was 18. 8 +/- 10. 9. The treatment was generally well tolerated. There was no evidence of occurrence of a serotonin syndrome. After augmentation with carbamazepine, treatment related adverse events were: Nausea in one case, diarrhea in one case, and rash in two cases. In conclusion, the results of this pilot study suggest that carbamazepine augmentation of a citalopram treatment in previous nonresponders to citalopram may be clinically useful, but that in addition carbamazepine can lead to a decrease of the plasma concentrations of the active enantiomer escitalopram...|$|E
40|$|An {{assessment}} in music therapy clinical practice {{is an essential}} part of the therapy process. Based on the assessment the therapist is able to recognize the needs of the client and plan the influential interventions in the therapy. A music therapy assessment evaluates a client´s individual strengths and weakness in both musical and non-musical areas. Many of the music therapy assessment tools have been created for a specific population, not as a comprehensive music therapy assessment tool. The IMTAP is one of the first comprehensive {{assessment in}}struments addressing a variety of diagnoses. It has been developed by a team of experienced music therapists in Music Therapy Wellness Clinic at California State University. In this master's thesis research the IMTAP is applied with a child diagnosed with ADHD and <b>phobic</b> <b>anxiety</b> <b>disorder.</b> Focus of the research is on emotional, social and fundamentals of musicality domains of the IMTAP. The aims are to collect the experiences and perspectives of music therapy clinicians about using the IMTAP, to research if it is possible to apply the IMTAP to assess the social emotional functioning and is the IMTAP suitable to Finnish psychodynamic music therapy customs. The study is a multi-method qualitative research and it has been conducted by observations and assessing the video recorded therapy sessions, focus group interview and questionnaires. This study offers a novel point of view on the IMTAP assessment tool, on music therapy assessment in general and also on some aspects of assessment method research. The IMTAP appears as a useful and ease to use assessment tool that helps the therapists to structure their work. In a focus group interview the clinicians bring out both benefits and needs of developing of the IMTAP, professional´s needs related to assessment and thoughts about best assessment style to assess social emotional functioning.

40|$|O transtorno do pânico (TP) é um transtorno ansioso não-fóbico que acomete de 1, 5 % a 4 % da população mundial. É caracterizado por ataques imotivados de mal-estar psíquico e sintomas somáticos, além de ansiedade antecipatória à crise, com prejuízo funcional ao indivíduo. O objetivo deste relato de caso é descrever a associação entre transtorno do pânico e doença do refluxo gastroesofágico (DRGE). MCL, 25 anos, apresentava crises de pânico frequentes, pouco responsivas ao tratamento durante 6 meses, mesmo com readequação da farmacoterapia. Iniciou-se investigação, sendo fechado o diagnóstico de DRGE, cujo tratamento culminou em remissão das crises de pânico. A dor torácica aguda da DRGE era interpretada como ameaça proximal, ocasionando dúvidas sobre passar mal e hiperventilação, servindo como gatilho da cascata cognitiva do pânico, no mesencéfalo dorsal. A inflamação da mucosa esofágica funciona como ameaça distal, estimulando a amígdala e causando ansiedade antecipatória, mantendo a elevação dos hormônios de estresse. Segundo o modelo de Deakin-Graeff, embora a 5 -HT iniba o ataque de pânico e {{facilite}} a ansiedade antecipatória, no TP esta última é estimulada por meio do núcleo dorsal da rafe. Portanto, casos que incluem a associação TP e DRGE devem ser mais bem examinados, para que haja diagnóstico e tratamento adequados. Panic disorder (PD) is a non <b>phobic</b> <b>anxiety</b> <b>disorder</b> {{that affects}} 1, 5 to 4 % worldwide. It {{is characterized by}} unmotivated acute attacks, with mental and somatic symptoms, and by an anxiety which precedes the crises, resulting in functional disturbance. The objective of this case study is to describe the association between PD and gastroesophageal reflux (GR). MCL, 25 years, presented with frequent panic crises, with low response to the therapy for 6 months, even after modification of medication doses. Investigation was carried out and diagnoses defined as GR. The treatment resulted with elimination of the panic crises. The acute thoracic pain of the GR is interpreted as a near threat, causing uncertainty regarding an unwell feeling with hyperventilation, acting as a trigger of the panic cognitive cascade, in the dorsal mesencephalon. The esophagic mucosa inflammation is interpreted as a distal threat, stimulating the amygdale and generating anticipated anxiety, increasing stress hormones. According to Deakin-Graeff model, even though 5 HT inhibits the panic attack and stimulates the anticipated anxiety, the panic disorder stimulates the latter through dorsal raphe nucleus. In conclusion, the association between PD and GR should be better identified in order that the correct diagnosis and adequate treatment is achieved...|$|E

The objective {{of this study was to}} examine the long-term stability of anxiety diagnoses starting with pre-school age children through adolescence evaluated at multiple time points. Prospective cohort study was conducted of all children and adolescents receiving psychiatric care at all pediatric psychiatric clinics belonging to two catchment areas in Madrid, Spain, between 1 January, 1992 and 30 April, 2006. Patients were selected from among 24, 163 children and adolescents who received psychiatric care. Patients had to have a diagnosis of an ICD- 10 <b>anxiety</b> <b>disorder</b> during at least one of the consultations and had to have received psychiatric care for the <b>anxiety</b> <b>disorder.</b> We grouped <b>anxiety</b> <b>disorder</b> diagnoses according to the following categories: <b>phobic</b> <b>disorders,</b> social <b>anxiety</b> <b>disorders,</b> obsessive–compulsive disorder (OCD), stress-related <b>disorders,</b> and “other” <b>anxiety</b> <b>disorders</b> which, among others, included generalized <b>anxiety</b> <b>disorder,</b> and panic disorder. Complementary indices of diagnostic stability were calculated. As much as 1, 869 subjects were included and had 27, 945 psychiatric/psychological consultations. The stability of all ICD- 10 <b>anxiety</b> <b>disorder</b> categories studied was high regardless of the measure of diagnostic stability used. <b>Phobic</b> and social <b>anxiety</b> <b>disorders</b> showed the highest diagnostic stability, whereas OCD and “other” <b>anxiety</b> <b>disorders</b> showed the lowest diagnostic stability.

40|$|Background: This study among treatment-seeking alcoholics {{examined}} the relationship between childhood abuse (sexual Abuse only [CSA], physical abuse only [CPA], or dual abuse [CDA]) and the presence of comorbid affective <b>disorders,</b> <b>anxiety</b> <b>disorders,</b> and suicide attempts, controlling for the potential confounding effects of other childhood adversities (early parental loss, witnessing domestic, violence, parental alcoholism, and/or dysfunction) and adult assault histories. Method: We assessed 155 (33 females, 122 males) treatment-seeking alcoholics using the European Addiction Se verity Index, the Structured Trauma Interview, and the Composite International Diagnostic Interview. Results: The severity of childhood abuse was associated with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and suicide attempts in females and with PTSD, social phobia, agoraphobia, and dysthymia in males. Among men, multiple logistic regression models showed that CPA and CDA were not independently associated with any of the examined comorbid disorders or with suicide attempts. However, CSA independently predicted comorbid social phobia, agoraphobia, and PTSD. For the presence of comorbid affective disorders (mainly major depression) and suicide attempts, maternal dysfunctioning was particularly important. CSA also independently contributed to the number of comorbid diagnoses. For females, small sample size precluded the use of multivariate analyses. Conclusion: Childhood abuse {{is an important factor in}} understanding clinical impairment in treated alcoholics, especially regarding comorbid <b>phobic</b> <b>anxiety</b> <b>disorders,</b> PTSD, and suicidality.

40|$|The article reviews psychosocial {{treatments}} for <b>phobic</b> and <b>anxiety</b> <b>disorders</b> in youth. Using criteria from Nathan and Gorman (2002), 32 studies are evaluated along {{a continuum of}} methodological rigor. In addition, the treatments evaluated {{in each of the}} 32 studies are classified according to Chambless et al. ’s (1996) and Chambless and Hollon’s (1998) criteria. Findings from a series of meta-analyses of the studies that used waitlists also are reported. In accordance with Nathan and Gorman, the majority of the studies were either methodologically robust or fairly rigorous. In accordance with Chambless and colleagues, although no treatment was well-established, Individual Cog-nitive Behavior Therapy, Group Cognitive Behavior Therapy (GCBT), GCBT with Par-ents, GCBT for social phobia (SOP), and Social Effectiveness Training for children with SOP each met criteria for probably efficacious. The other treatments were either possibly efficacious or experimental. Meta-analytic results revealed no significant differences between individual and group treatments on diagnostic recovery rates and anxiety symp-tom reductions, as well as other youth symptoms (i. e., fear, depression, internalizing and externalizing problems). Parental involvement was similarly efficacious as parental non-involvement in individual and group treatment formats.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{examined the}} long-term efficacy (8 -to- 13 years, M = 9. 54, SD = 1. 689) of exposure-based cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) for <b>phobic</b> and <b>anxiety</b> <b>disorders</b> in youths. Long-term efficacy was examined {{in terms of}} diagnostic recovery, symptom reductions, and clinically significant change. This dissertation also examined predictors of long-term efficacy (e. g., age, gender, and other clinical characteristics) {{as well as the}} relative long-term efficacy of CBT for Hispanic/Latino and European American youth. ^ Participants consisted of 67 youth (age range 15 – 26 years; M = 19. 43, SD = 3. 02 years at time of follow-up assessment), (47. 8 % females, 37. 3 % Hispanic/Latino) who had participated in one of two clinical trials (Silverman et al., 1999 a, b). After providing informed consent to participate in the long term follow-up, youths completed a diagnostic interview and a battery of questionnaires. Results indicated that treatment gains were maintained about 9. 5 years after treatment was completed. Maintenance of treatment gains was evident in terms of diagnostic recovery, symptom reductions, and clinically significant change. Long-term treatment gains extended to both ethnic groups and the two ethnic groups were functionally equivalent along most indices examined. Analyses of predictors of long-term outcome showed that parent self-reported pre-treatment depression, youth-reported pre-treatment depression, and youths retrospective reports of negative life events were significantly associated with less favorable long-term gains in terms of total symptoms of anxiety at long-term follow-up. In terms of long-term sequelae, youths with less successful post-treatment outcomes reported seeking-out additional treatment as well as using/abused substances and substance dependence significantly more than youths with successful post-treatment outcomes. Results are discussed in terms of the contribution of the present study to knowledge base about the long-term efficacy of exposure-based CBT procedures for <b>phobic</b> and <b>anxiety</b> <b>disorders</b> in youth. Findings also are discussed in terms of the need to modify CBT procedures to target youths with less successful post-treatment outcomes. Limitations and future directions are presented. ...|$|R
40|$|Background Exposure {{therapy is}} {{effective}} for <b>phobic</b> <b>anxiety</b> <b>disorders</b> (specific phobias, agoraphobia, social phobia) and panic disorder. Despite their high prevalence in the community, sufferers often get no treatment {{or if they}} do, it is usually after a long delay. This {{is largely due to}} the scarcity of healthcare professionals trained in exposure therapy, which is due, in part, to the high cost of training. Traditional teaching methods employed are labour intensive, being based mainly on role-play in small groups with feedback and coaching from experienced trainers. In an attempt to increase knowledge and skills in exposure therapy, there is now some interest in providing relevant teaching as part of pre-registration nurse education. Computers have been developed to teach terminology and simulate clinical scenarios for health professionals, and offer a potentially cost effective alternative to traditional teaching methods. Objective To test whether student nurses would learn about exposure therapy for phobia/panic as well by computer-aided self-instruction as by face-to-face teaching, and to compare the individual and combined effects of two educational methods, traditional face-to-face teaching comprising a presentation with discussion and questions/answers by a specialist cognitive behaviour nurse therapist, and a computer-aided self-instructional programme based on a self-help programme for patients with phobia/panic called FearFighter, on students’ knowledge, skills and satisfaction. Results The two teaching methods led to similar improvements in knowledge and skills, and to similar satisfaction, when used alone. Using them in tandem conferred no added benefit. Computer-aided self-instruction was more efficient as it saved teacher preparation and delivery time, and needed no specialist tutor. Conclusion Computer-aided self-instruction saved almost all preparation time and delivery effort for the expert teacher. When added to past results in medical students, the present results in nurses justify the use of computer-aided self-instruction for learning about exposure therapy and phobia/panic and of research into its value for other areas of health education...|$|R

MEDLINE and EMBASE were searched for cohort studies that included participants with and without anxiety, including subjects with anxiety, worry, posttraumatic stress <b>disorder,</b> <b>phobic</b> <b>anxiety,</b> and panic <b>disorder.</b> We examined the association of anxiety with cardiovascular mortality, major cardiovascular events (defined as the composite of cardiovascular death, stroke, coronary heart disease, and heart failure), stroke, coronary heart disease, heart failure, and atrial fibrillation. We identified 46 cohort studies containing 2, 017, 276 participants and 222, 253 subjects with anxiety. Anxiety was associated with a significantly elevated risk of cardiovascular mortality (relative risk [RR] 1. 41, CI 1. 13 to 1. 76), coronary heart disease (RR 1. 41, CI 1. 23 to 1. 61), stroke (RR 1. 71, CI 1. 18 to 2. 50), and heart failure (RR 1. 35, CI 1. 11 to 1. 64). Anxiety was not significantly associated with major cardiovascular events or atrial fibrillation although CIs were wide. <b>Phobic</b> <b>anxiety</b> was associated with a higher risk of coronary heart disease than other <b>anxiety</b> <b>disorders,</b> and posttraumatic stress disorder was associated with a higher risk of stroke.

40|$|CONTEXT: <b>Anxiety</b> <b>disorders</b> are common, with a {{lifetime}} prevalence of 20 % in the U. S., and {{are responsible for}} substantial burdens of disability, missed work days and health care utilization. To date, no causal genetic variants have been identified for <b>anxiety,</b> <b>anxiety</b> <b>disorders,</b> or related traits. OBJECTIVE: To investigate whether a <b>phobic</b> <b>anxiety</b> symptom score was associated with 3 alternative polygenic risk scores, derived from external genome-wide association studies of anxiety, an internally estimated agnostic polygenic score, or previously identified candidate genes. DESIGN: Longitudinal follow-up study. Using linear and logistic regression we investigated whether <b>phobic</b> <b>anxiety</b> was associated with polygenic risk scores derived from internal, leave-one out genome-wide association studies, from 31 candidate genes, and from out-of-sample genome-wide association weights previously shown to predict depression and anxiety in another cohort. SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: Study participants (n =  11, 127) were individuals from the Nurses' Health Study and Health Professionals Follow-up Study. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Anxiety symptoms were assessed via the 8 -item <b>phobic</b> <b>anxiety</b> scale of the Crown Crisp Index at two time points, from which a continuous phenotype score was derived. RESULTS: We found no genome-wide significant associations with <b>phobic</b> <b>anxiety.</b> <b>Phobic</b> <b>anxiety</b> was also not associated with a polygenic risk score derived from the genome-wide association study beta weights using liberal p-value thresholds; with a previously published genome-wide polygenic score; or with a candidate gene risk score based on 31 genes previously hypothesized to predict anxiety. CONCLUSION: There is a substantial gap between twin-study heritability estimates of <b>anxiety</b> <b>disorders</b> ranging between 20 - 40 % and heritability explained by genome-wide association results. New approaches such as improved genome imputations, application of gene expression and biological pathways information, and incorporating social or environmental modifiers of genetic risks {{may be necessary to}} identify significant genetic predictors of anxiety...|$|R
40|$|Background: Dimensional {{models of}} {{psychopathology}} demonstrate that two correlated factors {{of fear and}} distress account for the covariation among depressive and <b>anxiety</b> <b>disorders.</b> Nevertheless, these models tend to exclude variables relevant to psychopathology, such as temperament traits. This study examined the joint structure of DSM-IV-based major depression and <b>anxiety</b> <b>disorders</b> along with trait negative affect in {{a representative sample of}} adult individuals residing in the cities of S&# 227;o Paulo and Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. Methods: The sample consisted of 3, 728 individuals who were administered sections D (<b>phobic,</b> <b>anxiety</b> and panic <b>disorders)</b> and E (depressive disorders) of the Composite International Diagnostic Interview (CIDI) 2. 1 and a validated version of the Positive and Negative Affect Schedule. Data were analyzed using correlational and structural equation modeling. Results: Lifetime prevalence ranged from 2. 4 % for panic disorder to 23. 2 % for major depression. Most target variables were moderately correlated. A two-factor model specifying correlated fear and distress factors was retained and confirmed for models including only diagnostic variables and diagnostic variables along with trait negative affect. Conclusions: This study provides support for characterization of internalizing psychopathology and trait negative affect in terms of correlated dimensions of distress and fear. These results have potential implications for psychiatric taxonomy and for understanding the relationship between temperament and psychopathology...|$|R

This dissertation study compared a CBT with parent and child (i. e., PCBT) and child group CBT (i. e., GCBT). These two treatment approaches were compared due to the recognition that a child’s context has an effect on the development, course, and outcome of childhood psychopathology and functional status. The specific aims of this dissertation were to examine treatment specificity and mediation effects of parent and peer contextual variables. ^ The sample consisted of 183 youth and their mothers. Research questions were analyzed using analysis of variance for treatment outcome, and structural equation modeling, accounting for clustering effects, for treatment specificity and mediation effects. ^ Results indicated that both PCBT and GCBT produced positive treatment outcomes across all indices of change (i. e., clinically significant improvement, anxiety symptom reduction) and across all informants (i. e., youths and parents) with no significant differences between treatment conditions. Results also showed partial treatment specific effects of positive peer relationships in GCBT. PCBT also showed partial treatment specific effects of parental psychological control. Mediation effects were only observed in GCBT; positive peer interactions mediated treatment response. The results support the use CBT with parents and peers for treating childhood anxiety. The findings’ implications are further discussed in terms of the need to conduct further meditational treatment outcome designs in order to continue to advance theory and research in child and anxiety treatment. ...|$|R
40|$|Blood-Injection-Injury phobia is a {{major health}} issue {{throughout}} the life span. It usually starts in early childhood. Avoidance of health care is seen in such individuals. Children with blood injection injury phobia have uncontrollable fear of blood, injury, injections and needles. Because of the intense fear, these children will {{do everything possible to}} avoid it. Various physical symptoms including increased heart rate, chest discomfort, trembling movements, feeling of choking and syncope may occur in these children on mentioning about blood, needles or any injury. Vasovagal fainting with diphasic response pattern occurs in about twenty percent of children on exposure to the <b>phobic</b> stimulus. Other <b>anxiety</b> <b>disorders,</b> depressive disorders and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder also occur co-morbidly in children with blood-injection-injury phobia which makes the prognosis poor. Avoidance of health care due to phobia causes significant negative impact on health outcomes. Hence early diagnosis and urgent management of blood-injection-injury phobia in children is essential...|$|R

40|$|Purpose. Anxiety-related {{problems}} at work are {{a serious problem}} in the occupational context, as they come along with sick leave and problems in work participation. The {{aim of this study}} is to analyse workplace <b>phobic</b> <b>anxiety</b> in nonclinical context using the Job Demands-Resources model. Methods. The study involved a sample of 739 workers from a retail company, mostly with permanent contracts. Structural equation modelling analyses were performed using AMOS software. Results. Both the health impairment and motivational variables in the JD-R model were significantly related to workplace <b>phobic</b> <b>anxiety</b> and subsequently to absenteeism, specifically, exhaustion mediated between perceived job demands and workplace <b>phobic</b> <b>anxiety</b> and work engagement mediated between perceived job resources and workplace <b>phobic</b> <b>anxiety.</b> Moreover, workplace <b>phobic</b> <b>anxiety</b> was significantly positively related to absenteeism. Conclusions. Results suggest that workplace <b>phobic</b> <b>anxiety</b> is a specific concept and an important issue in organizations for both workers’ health and the organizational costs linked to absenteeism. Supervisors and occupational physicians should be aware of workplace <b>phobic</b> <b>anxiety,</b> especially when workers are on sick leave often or for long periods...|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVES: To {{evaluate}} whether <b>phobic</b> <b>anxiety</b> {{is associated with}} increased risk of cardiac mortality in individuals with established coronary heart disease (CHD) and to examine the role of reduced heart rate variability (HRV) in mediating this risk. Previous findings suggest that <b>phobic</b> <b>anxiety</b> may pose increased risk of cardiac mortality in medically healthy cohorts. METHODS: We performed a prospective cohort study in 947 CHD patients recruited during hospitalization for coronary angiography. At baseline, supine recordings of heart rate for HRV were collected, and participants completed the Crown-Crisp <b>phobic</b> <b>anxiety</b> scale. Fatal cardiac events were identified over an average period of 3 years. RESULTS: Female CHD patients reported significantly elevated levels of <b>phobic</b> <b>anxiety</b> when compared with male patients (p <. 001), and survival analysis showed an interaction between gender and <b>phobic</b> <b>anxiety</b> in the prediction of cardiac mortality (p =. 058) and sudden cardiac death (p =. 03). In women, <b>phobic</b> <b>anxiety</b> {{was associated with a}} 1. 6 -fold increased risk of cardiac mortality (hazard ratio, 1. 56; 95 % confidence interval, 1. 15 - 2. 11; p =. 004) and a 2. 0 -fold increased risk of sudden cardiac death (hazard ratio, 2. 02; 95 % confidence interval, 1. 16 - 3. 52; p =. 01) and was unassociated with increased mortality risk in men (p =. 56). <b>Phobic</b> <b>anxiety</b> was weakly associated with reduced high-frequency HRV in female patients (r = -. 14, p =. 02), but reduced HRV did not alter the association between <b>phobic</b> <b>anxiety</b> on mortality. CONCLUSIONS: <b>Phobic</b> <b>anxiety</b> levels are high in women with CHD and may be a risk factor for cardiac-related mortality in women diagnosed with CHD.

Psychodynamic group psychotherapy {{may not be}} an optimal treatment for anxiety and agoraphobic symptoms. We explore remission of SCL- 90 -R Global Severity Index (GSI) and target symptoms in 39 sessions of psychodynamic group therapy. Methods. SCL- 90 -R “target symptom ” profile and GSI remission according to Danish norms were identified in 239 patients and evaluated according to reliable and clinical significant change. Results. Four major groups of target symptom cases (depression, interpersonal sensitivity, <b>anxiety,</b> and <b>phobic</b> <b>anxiety)</b> covered 95. 7 % of the sample. As opposite to <b>phobic</b> <b>anxiety</b> and anxiety patients, patients with interpersonal sensitivity obtained overall themost optimal outcome. The <b>phobic</b> <b>anxiety</b> scale, social network support, and years of school education were independent predictors of GSI remission, and a low anxiety score and absence of <b>phobic</b> <b>anxiety</b> target symptoms were independent predictors of remission of target symptom pathology. Conclusions. The negative results as associated with the SCL- 90 -R <b>phobic</b> <b>anxiety</b> scale and the <b>phobic</b> <b>anxiety</b> target symptom group are largely in agreement with recent studies. In contrast, whatever the diagnoses, patients with interpersonal sensitivity target symptom may be especially suited for psychodynamic group therapy. The SCL- 90 -R subscales may allow for a more complex symptom-related differentiatio...|$|R
40|$|It {{has been}} {{suggested}} that disgust, rather than anxiety, may be important in some phobias. Correlational studies have been ambiguous, indicating either that disgust increases <b>phobic</b> <b>anxiety</b> or that <b>phobic</b> <b>anxiety</b> potentiates disgust. In the experimental study reported here, disgust and <b>phobic</b> <b>anxiety</b> were manipulated in the context of habituation to phobic stimuli. Spider fearful participants were randomly allocated to conditions in which neutral, disgusting, and <b>phobic</b> <b>anxiety</b> provoking stimuli were introduced into a video-based spider phobic habituation sequence. Exposure to the phobic stimulus resulted in a return of self-reported fear and disgust levels. However, exposure to disgusting stimulus increased disgust levels, but not anxiety levels. Results are most consistent with the hypothesis that fear enhances the disgust response in phobias, but that disgust alone does not enhance the fear response. Previously observed links between disgust and spider phobia may be a consequence of fear enhancing disgust...|$|R
40|$|Background. Somatoform {{disorders}} such as neurasthenia {{and chronic}} fatigue syndrome are characterized {{by a combination of}} prolonged mental and physical fatigue. This study aimed to investigate the heritability of somatic distress and determine whether this dimension is aetiologically distinct from measures of depression and anxiety. Method. Measures of <b>anxiety,</b> depression, <b>phobic</b> <b>anxiety,</b> somatic distress and sleep difficulty were administered in a self-report questionnaire to a community-based sample of 3469 Australian twin individuals aged 18 to 28 years. Factor analysis using a Promax rotation, produced four factors: depression, <b>phobic</b> <b>anxiety,</b> somatic distress and sleep disturbance. Multivariate and univariate genetic analyses of the raw categorical data scores for depression, <b>phobic</b> <b>anxiety</b> and depression were then analysed in Mx 1. 47. Results. Univariate genetic analysis revealed that an additive genetic and non-shared environmental (AE) model best explained individual differences in depression and <b>phobic</b> <b>anxiety</b> scores, for male and female twins alike, but could not resolve whether additive genes or shared environment were responsible for significant familial aggregation in somatic distress. However, multivariate geneti...|$|R

40|$|Abstract BACKGROUND: The authors {{investigated}} frequency, clinical correlates and onset {{temporal relationship}} of social <b>anxiety</b> <b>disorder</b> (SAD) in adult {{patients with a}} diagnosis of bipolar I disorder. METHODS: Subjects were 189 patients whose diagnoses were assessed by the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-III-R-Patient Version. RESULTS: Twenty-four patients (12. 7 %) met DSM-III-R criteria for lifetime SAD; of these, 19 (10. 1 % of entire sample) had SAD within the last month. Significantly more bipolar patients with comorbid SAD also had substance use disorders compared to those without. On the HSCL- 90, levels of interpersonal sensitivity, obsessiveness, <b>phobic</b> <b>anxiety</b> and paranoid ideation were significantly higher in bipolar patients with SAD than in those without. Bipolar patients with comorbid SAD recalled separation anxiety problems (school refusal) more frequently during childhood than those without. Lifetime SAD comorbidity was associated with an earlier age at onset of syndromal bipolar disorder. Pre-existing OCD tended to delay the onset of bipolarity. CONCLUSIONS: Social <b>anxiety</b> <b>disorder</b> comorbidity is not rare among patients with bipolar disorder {{and is likely to}} affect age of onset and phenomenology of bipolar disorder. These findings may influence treatment planning and the possibility of discovering a pathophysiological relationship between SAD and bipolarity...|$|R

They were carried out by the therapist (in vivo) measurement; <b>phobic</b> <b>anxiety</b> and <b>phobic</b> avoidance scale) by an independent observer (<b>phobic</b> <b>anxiety</b> scale and <b>phobic</b> avoidance scale) and by the client (<b>phobic</b> <b>anxiety</b> scale; <b>phobic</b> avoidance scale: FSS; social anxiety scale; SDS and I-E scale). Self-observation, flooding and flooding/self-observation resulted in significant improvement on several variables, whereas the no-treatment control group did not improve. No difference in effectiveness was found between the self-observation and flooding treatments. In addition, the results suggest that a combined flooding/self-observation treatment is more effective than each of the individual treatments...|$|R
40|$|A {{prospective}} {{study of the}} relation between scores on the six subscales of the Crown-Crisp experiential index and subsequent incidence of ischaemic heart disease was undertaken among participants in the Northwick Park heart study. Results from 1457 white men aged 40 - 64 at recruitment showed that <b>phobic</b> <b>anxiety</b> was strongly related to subsequent major ischaemic heart disease (fatal and non-fatal events combined) when other associated variables were taken into account. The <b>phobic</b> <b>anxiety</b> score alone remained significantly associated with ischaemic heart disease when scores on all the subscales were included in the analysis. <b>Phobic</b> <b>anxiety</b> seemed to be particularly associated with fatal ischaemic heart disease but was not associated with deaths from other causes and was no higher in those with a pre-existing myocardial infarction at recruitment than in those without. There was a consistent increase in risk of fatal ischaemic heart disease with score on the <b>phobic</b> <b>anxiety</b> subscale. The relative risk for those whose score was 5 and above was 3. 77 (95 % confidence interval 1. 64 to 8. 64) compared with those whose score was 0 or 1. The 49 participants with evidence of myocardial infarction at recruitment had higher scores on the subscales for free floating anxiety and functional somatic complaint. The Crown-Crisp experiential index is simple to fill out and acceptable to patients. When the results are combined with other known risk factors it may be of use in defining high risk subjects and in planning strategies for prevention...|$|R
