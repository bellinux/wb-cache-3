Research may proceed by conducting trading simulations or by establishing and studying the behavior, {{and the way that}} these people act or react, of people in artificial competitive market-like settings.|$|E
25|$|The Associated Press {{was formed}} in May 1846 by five daily {{newspapers}} in New York City to share the cost of transmitting news of the Mexican–American War. The venture was organized by Moses Yale Beach (1800–68), second publisher of The Sun, joined by the New York Herald, the New York Courier and Enquirer, The Journal of Commerce, and the New York Evening Express. Some historians believe that the Tribune joined at this time; documents show it was a member in 1849. The New York Times became a member shortly after its founding in September 1851. Initially known as the New York Associated Press (NYAP), the organization faced competition from the Western Associated Press (1862), which criticized its monopolistic news gathering and <b>price</b> <b>setting</b> practices. An investigation completed in 1892 by Victor Lawson, {{editor and publisher of}} the Chicago Daily News, revealed that several principals of the NYAP had entered into a secret agreement with United Press, a rival organization, to share NYAP news and the profits of reselling it. The revelations led to the demise of the NYAP and in December 1892, the Western Associated Press was incorporated in Illinois as The Associated Press. A 1900 Illinois Supreme Court decision (Inter Ocean Publishing Co. v. Associated Press)—that the AP was a public utility and operating in restraint of trade—resulted in AP's move from Chicago to New York City, where corporation laws were more favorable to cooperatives.|$|E

Car Talk has rated it the [...] "worst car of the century", and many car magazines and TV shows rate it as the worst car of the 1980s and also the worst car to be ever made {{in the history of the}} automotive industry. Despite the very low <b>price</b> <b>setting</b> in the US (with Yugo being the cheapest new car ever sold in the US when adjusted for inflation), it was ridiculed for the overall ugly design, poor quality, and large number of technical issues. Many American Yugos had faulty designs that were stressed in owners' manuals to be regularly serviced, but this caused even more ridicule due to owners overlooking these issues. [...] The car has become a sort of a symbol for a lemon car. The car was also featured in many TV shows and films, satirizing the car's poor design (the most famous example being a rusty, beige-colored Yugo GV featured in Die Hard with a Vengeance).|$|E
2500|$|Lowell E. Gallaway and Richard K. Vedder argue on {{the basis}} of libertarian {{theories}} that the Great Depression was caused by too high wages which they say had caused a loss of depositor confidence which caused the bank runs. They further conclude that the [...] "Great Depression was very significantly prolonged in both its duration and its magnitude by the impact of New Deal programs." [...] They suggest that without Social Security, work relief, unemployment insurance, mandatory minimum wages, and without special government-granted privileges for labor unions, business would have hired more workers and the unemployment rate during the New Deal years would have been 6.7% instead of 17.2%. Amity Shlaes wrote that [...] "from 1929 to 1940, from Hoover to Roosevelt, government intervention helped to make the Depression Great." [...] Shlaes said that the NRA was misguided because it used <b>price</b> <b>setting</b> to fix monetary problems. According to Shlaes, Roosevelt's experimentation frightened business into inaction and prevented recovery. Eric Rauchway showed that Shlaes tried to diminish the economic growth by referring to the unrepresentative Dow Jones Industrial Average. He continued that usually a historian or economist would have referred to the gross domestic product which, according to the Historical Statistics of the United States, grew impressively by 9% annually during Roosevelt's first term and by 11% annually after the short recession of 1937–38.|$|E

Wages in some industries change once per year on average, while others change per quarter and others once every two years. One might hope that a model with homogenous representative price or wage setting would be a good approximation to this more complex world, but most likely some degree of heterogeneity will be required to describe reality accurately." ...|$|E
