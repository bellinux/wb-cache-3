[URL] substrate and flow {{characteristics of a}} 100 m reach of a small, North Island, New Zealand stream were mapped and drawn to a 0. 25 m 2 grid scale. One hundred and thirty four individual fish, representing five native and one introduced species were PIT tagged and then monitored with a <b>portable</b> <b>transceiver</b> over 41 occasions during day and night in autumn to winter of 2008, then on 3 occasions in January 2009. Redfin bullies (Gobiomorphus huttoni), shortjaw kokopu (Galaxias postvectis) and koaro (Galaxias brevipinnis) were most commonly represented and redetected in the 100 m reach (75 %, 73 %, and 83 % detection rates respectively). Redfin bullies with a lower condition factor than conspecifics {{were less likely to}} be redetected and gravid fish were considered more at risk of infection or death associated with PIT tagging. Shortjaw kokopu {{were less likely to be}} redetected but more likely to retain tags in the longer term than both redfin bullies and koaro. No difference was found in tag detection rates at a range of flow levels, nor between day and night surveying, although a small decline in detection rates occurred as water temperature decreased. Four hundred and twelve locations of untagged fish were collected during 14 night samples and added to the dataset of 557 locations of PIT tagged fish. A total of 1112 (82 % of the reach) 0. 25 m 2 grid squares were inventoried for microhabitat characteristics using 16 physical variables which, together with fish locations, enabled the microhabitat characteristics of the grid squares where fish were found to be compared with those where fish were not found. Redfin bullies and shortjaw kokopu showed strong associations with large substrates and large interstitial refuge spaces and both species showed marked diel differences in microhabitat utilisation. Koaro were more dependent on velocity and surface turbulence and used similar microhabitat types regardless of diel period. No size-based or seasonal differences were found regarding microhabitat use. Potential segregation was observed between shortjaw kokopu and koaro but no other biotic influences on habitat utilisation were apparent. Three floods occurred during the 2008 sampling period which facilitated the collection of fish behavioural data in relation to high flows. A total of 31 individuals were detected during flood conditions and these were found either within 0. 5 metres of the base flow stream bed edge or inside the base flow stream bed in areas with large boulder substrates. A subset of the population was found returning to the same locations during multiple floods. Individual fish detected during high flows were significantly less familiar (see pages 68 - 69 for a detailed description of the term “familiar” in this context) in comparison to the subset of individuals that were commonly resident in the study reach during base flow conditions, showing that tagged fish made larger scale movements during flood conditions. While small changes in community composition occurred that were able to be attributed to flood-induced microhabitat changes, overall a remarkable level of persistence was observed in the tagged community, with over half of all individuals remaining in or returning to the same 100 m section of stream following each flood...|$|E

The method uses self-operating and fully integrated circuitry comprising RF power detection, switching and sequential logic, and RF envelope feedback {{in conjunction with a}} hardware gating function for triggering and activating current reduction mechanisms {{as a function of the}} transmitted RF power level. Because of the critical role that RFIC PA components occupy in modern wireless transceivers, and given the major impact that these components have on the overall RF performances and energy consumption in wireless transceivers, very significant benefits stem from the underlying innovations. The method has been validated through the successful design of a 1. 88 GHz COMA RFIC PA with automatic hardware reconfiguration capability, using an industry renowned state-of-the-art GaAs HBT semiconductor process developed and owned by Skyworks Solutions, Inc., USA. The circuit techniques that have enabled the successful and full on-chip embodiment of the technique are analyzed in details. The IC implementation is discussed, and experimental results showing significant current reduction upon automatic hardware reconfiguration, gain regulation performances, and compliance with the stringent linearity requirements for COMA transmission demonstrate that the gated envelope feedback method is a viable and promising approach to automatic hardware reconfiguration of RFIC PA's for current reduction purposes. Moreover, in regard to on-chip integration of advanced PA control functions, it is demonstrated that the method is better positioning GaAs HBT technologies, which are known to offer very competitive RF performances but inherently have limited integration capabilities.

40|$|In recent years, {{the rapid}} {{expansion}} of wireless communications and the consequent introduction of new frequency bands have increased the demand for multiband transceivers. For manufacturers, the multiband transceivers have to feature compact sizes and low fabrication costs. In addition, from the technical point of view, the RF front-end module of the receivers has to be easily integrated with embedded antennas that should be unobtrusive in appearance. To fulfil all these requirements, considerable attention is given to planar or microstrip patch antennas because they are easy to manufacture, and offer considerable flexibility with regards to the space constraints in RF front-end circuitry, which is primarily fabricated on Printed Circuit Boards (PCB). However, as the transceiver modules become more compact, this type of antenna faces a number of challenges. It has to achieve a multiband operation in the smaller volume that is available in modern compact wireless transceivers. To meet these goals, a suitable design methodology has to be used. This thesis work focuses on compact multi-band patch antennas which are designed for existing wireless services including GSM, PCS, DCS, GPS, UMTS, WLAN and WiMAX bands. The present techniques available in the open literature include the modification of the main radiator via bending, folding, meandering and wrapping. Each approach offers different advantages and disadvantages depending on the required application. The constraint for the lower band generation is the main challenge in radiator miniaturization. The quarter wavelength radiator subjected to miniaturization may suffer from limited bandwidth and low radiation efficiency. Alternative approaches using modifications of the ground plane are a promising technique, which were often previously overlooked by antenna designers. It is shown herein that the introduction of a ground slot at its quarter wavelength electrical dimension excites new resonances. Proper dimension and configuration design results in a minimal usage of ground plane area, which is traditionally dedicated for electronic circuitry in the transceiver module. The introduction of a ground slot in a finite antenna ground plane can be further extended to include reconfigurable features. With easily available electrical switches such as MEMS, varactors or PIN diodes, ground slots can be turned into a frequency-tuneable element. Thus, such antennas offering compact size with multiband capability can be promising candidates for wireless antenna design. This thesis presents a viable solution and a promising approach to address these challenging scenarios in antenna design. As compared to the previously published antennas in the literatures, the reported antennas present several multiband solutions by utilizing the ground slot, slit and cut instead of the conventional radiator modifications. In addition, the antennas are modified using several novel techniques to miniaturize the main radiator, such as a meandered-tail and folded quarter ellipse configurations. Finally, the thesis proposed a novel reconfigurable ground slot which eliminates the need to have a complicated bias network commonly faced in designing reconfigurable radiators. Five novel antenna designs are presented in the thesis. Initially, a compact 6 x 13 mm coplanar inverted-F antenna (CIFA) with ground slots is developed to produce a multiband operation for WLAN 2. 4 GHz, 5. 2 GHz and 5. 8 GHz services. The antenna is the first in the literature to utilize the coupling configuration between ground slot and microstrip feedline to introduce a new resonant frequency, and thus to achieve a multiband operation. In addition, a compact 13 x 60 x 5. 6 mm antenna based on a novel quarter-ellipse monopole design is also presented. In the design, the modification of the ground plane involves the use of a ground cut and a parasitic element. The resulting antenna has ultra-wideband coverage for all wireless services ranging from the GSM 850 MHz up to WLAN 5. 8 GHz, the first planar antenna within 5 mm height to achieve this coverage performance. The design of a 3 mm inverted-F antenna to cover GSM, DCS and PCS operation is also proposed. This 3 mm antenna height is the slimmest dual band PIFA ever proposed in the literature. This compact 40 x 10 mm antenna radiator makes use of less than 5 % of its ground plane area for the modification needed to achieve the desired operational bandwidth. In the final part, the thesis presents a reconfigurable CIFA with the first ever tunable ground slot configuration in the literature. The novel tunable ground slot utilizes PIN diodes as a switching device to produce an antenna that is compact and covers the GSM, DCS, PCS and UMTS bands. The performance of all the designed antennas has been verified through experimental investigations. The obtained radiation characteristics for all the presented antennas are close to the omni-directional pattern, a feature which is needed for <b>portable</b> <b>transceivers.</b> Also, the achieved antenna gains and efficiencies are within the feasible range of 0 to 7 dBi that is suitable for most of the portable wireless applications. The presented novel antenna design methods provide potential solutions to the compact and multiband requirement of modern portable antenna designs. With the presented antenna design methods, the solutions to the compact and multiband requirement of modern portable antenna design are addressed...|$|R
40|$|YesIn this work, {{miniaturized}} tunable two-antenna MIMO systems {{composed of}} printed F-slot shaped is developed {{to operate in}} the GPS, PCS, DCS and UMTS bands. The two-element MIMO antenna occupies a volume of 50 × 37. 5 × 1. 6 mm 3, and is printed on an FR 4 substrate. Initially, the frequency tunability of the MIMO antennas was verified by lumped capacitors with values between 0. 75 to 2. 75 pF to achieve a tuning range from 1. 55 to 2. 07 GHz while the low mutual coupling between the radiators was accomplished by adding an I-shaped branch to a cut-away ground plane. The two antennas are then loaded with varactors to simultaneously achieve miniaturization and tunability. Simulation and measurement results demonstrate the successful implementation of a tunable MIMO with coupling reduction mechanism for a <b>portable</b> handheld wireless <b>transceiver.</b> The channel capacity of the proposed antenna is investigated and found to be close to that of an un-correlated system with efficient diversity in which the mutual coupling across the full bandwidth was better than - 13 dB. Owing to the compact size and ease of manufacture, the proposed antennas can be a promising solution for adaptive MIMO systems in handheld devices.

40|$|International audienceAlthough so far not as {{successful}} as managed wireless networking, an alternative type of wireless networks has also emerged since 2000 : spontaneous wireless networks. Inspired by the Push-To-Talk concept used in walkie-talkies (<b>portable</b> half-duplex radio <b>transceivers</b> developed during the Second World War), spontaneous wireless networks depart from the traditional distinction between router and hosts, whereby each user terminal (hereafter, node) may behave as a router and a host simultaneously. In spontaneous wireless networks, user terminals are thus ''prosumers" (i. e. both producers and consumers) of networking resources instead of mere consumers. Terminals self-organize to provide multi-hop wireless communications among themselves, with or without help/control from infrastructure devices. Each node may thus simultaneously originate/receive traffic (role of a host), as well as forward traffic on behalf of other terminals (role of a router). Popular examples of spontaneous wireless networks include mobile ad hoc networks, wireless mesh networks, wireless sensor or actuator networks, wireless smart meter networks, vehicular networks, opportunistic wireless networks or delay tolerant networks. Popular link layer technologies providing device-to-device communication in spontaneous wireless networks include so far IEEE 802. 11 ad hoc mode and IEEE 802. 15. 4. However, {{in order to provide}} multi-hop communication in spontaneous wireless networks, additional techniques have to be employed on top of such link layer technologies, and {{that is the subject of}} this chapter. The focus is put on the use of standard IP protocols to enable multi-hop wireless communications in spontaneous wireless networks - in order for these networks to effectively blend in the Internet, where appropriate...|$|R
