The satellite had a mass in orbit of 671 kg, had a rotation stabilized between 50 and 55 rpm, its propellers used as a propellant 136 kg of hydrazine and was powered by solar cells that supplied 982 Watts at the beginning of its phase of operation, using two NiCd batteries as <b>power</b> <b>reserve.</b> It carried 24 C-band transmitters with 6 spare transmitters.

25|$|In March 2003, the Lynx {{formed the}} bulk of the {{deployed}} British rotary aviation battle group in the invasion of Iraq. Participating aircraft were quickly outfitted with engine sand filters, armour, heat dissipaters, modern secure radios and radar warning receivers. In the subsequent multi-national occupation force, a flight of either AAC or CHF Lynx AH.7s were based at Basra International Airport under command of the Joint Helicopter Force (Iraq) on a rotational basis. In theatre, they would escort infantry patrols, perform aerial reconnaissance, provide fire support and act as airborne communications hubs. Performance issues were encountered in the high temperature environment, often operating with no <b>power</b> <b>reserve</b> and thus no ability to overshoot during landings; these were belatedly resolved by the introduction of the Lynx AH.9A.|$|E
2500|$|A {{range of}} {{turboshaft}} powerplants {{have been used}} to power the numerous variants of the AW109, from the original Allison 250-C14 engines to the Turbomeca Arriel 1K1 and Pratt & Whitney Canada PW206 of more modern aircraft. Powerplants can be replaced or swapped for during airframe overhauls, resulting in increasing lifting capacity and other performance changes. In the case of single-engine failure, the AW109 is intended to have a generous <b>power</b> <b>reserve</b> even on a single engine. The engines drive a fully articulated four-blade rotor system. Over time, more advanced rotor blade designs have been progressively adopted for the AW109's main and tail rotors, such as composite materials being used to replace bonded metal, these improvements have typically been made with the aim of reducing operating costs and noise signature. According to Rotor, the type is well regarded for its [...] "high, hot, and heavy" [...] performance.|$|E
40|$|Abstract—In several countries, {{the wind}} power {{penetration}} increased tremendously {{in the last}} years. As the current wind turbines {{do not participate in}} frequency control nor reserve provision, this may compromise the proper functioning of the primary control and the provision of <b>power</b> <b>reserves.</b> If no actions are taken, increasing levels of wind penetration may result in serious problems concerning the stable operation of the power system. This paper focuses on the provision of <b>power</b> <b>reserves</b> by wind turbines. For this service, the constant power control strategy is chosen as control strategy, as it gives a constant power output and has the ability to provide <b>power</b> <b>reserves.</b> In this way, the wind turbine behaves more like a conventional power plant. The choice of the power reference value is crucial as it determines whether or not a stable operation of the wind turbine is possible and <b>power</b> <b>reserves</b> can be provided. In this paper, an algorithm is proposed to obtain the range of possible reference values. By means of simulations, the optimal reference value to provide <b>power</b> <b>reserves</b> with a single wind turbine is obtained. Also, reserve provision in a wind farm is investigated. It is shown that the provision of <b>power</b> <b>reserves</b> with wind turbines using the constant power strategy is possible, especially in wind farms.

40|$|Active <b>power</b> <b>reserves</b> {{are needed}} for the proper {{operation}} of an electrical system. These reserves are continuously regulated in order to match the generation and consumption {{in the system and}} thus, to maintain a constant electrical frequency. They are usually provided by synchronized conventional generating units such as hydraulic or thermal power plants. With the progressive displacement of these generating plants by non-synchronized renewable-based power plants (e. g. wind and solar) the net level of synchronous <b>power</b> <b>reserves</b> in the system becomes reduced. Therefore, wind power plants are required, according to some European Grid Codes, to also provide <b>power</b> <b>reserves</b> like conventional generating units do.
