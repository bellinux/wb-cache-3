25|$|Ultrasound (US) and {{magnetic}} resonance imaging (MRI) are the two main imaging methods used for prostate cancer detection. Urologists use transrectal ultrasound during <b>prostate</b> <b>biopsy</b> and can sometimes see a hypoechoic area (tissues or structures that reflect relatively less of the ultrasound waves directed at them). However, US has poor tissue resolution, and thus is generally not used clinically.|$|E
50|$|Another {{area where}} MRI robots could be {{extremely}} helpful is in <b>prostate</b> <b>biopsies.</b> Currently, most <b>prostate</b> <b>biopsies</b> are performed using transrectal ultrasonography (TRUS). However, approximately 20% {{of people with}} prostate cancer who have a biopsy done with TRUS will be told {{they do not have}} cancer.

Giuliani chose a combination prostate cancer treatment consisting of four months of neoadjuvant Lupron hormonal therapy, then low dose-rate prostate brachytherapy with permanent implantation of ninety TheraSeed radioactive palladium-103 seeds in his prostate in September 2000, followed two months later by five weeks of fifteen-minute, five-days-a-week external beam radiotherapy at Mount Sinai Medical Center, with five months of adjuvant Lupron hormonal therapy.|$|E
25|$|After a <b>prostate</b> <b>biopsy,</b> a {{pathologist}} {{looks at}} the samples under a microscope. If cancer is present, the pathologist reports the grade of the tumor. The grade tells how much the tumor tissue differs from normal prostate tissue and suggests how fast the tumor is likely to grow. The Gleason system is used to grade prostate tumors from 2 to 10, where a Gleason score of 10 indicates the most abnormalities. The pathologist assigns a number from 1 to 5 for the most common pattern observed under the microscope, then does {{the same for the}} second-most-common pattern. The sum of these two numbers is the Gleason score. The Whitmore-Jewett stage is another method sometimes used.|$|E

2500|$|Clinical {{practice}} {{guidelines for}} prostate cancer screening vary and are controversial due to uncertainty {{as to whether the}} benefits of screening ultimately outweigh the risks of overdiagnosis and over treatment. [...] In the United States, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved the PSA test for annual screening of prostate cancer in men of age 50 and older. The patient needs to be informed of the risks and benefits of PSA testing prior to performing the test (see below). PSA levels between 4 and 10ng/mL (nanograms per milliliter) are considered to be suspicious and consideration should be given to confirming the abnormal PSA with a repeat test. If indicated, <b>prostate</b> <b>biopsy</b> is performed to obtain tissue sample for histopathological analysis. [...] In the United Kingdom, the National Health Service (2005) does not mandate, nor advise for PSA test, but allows patients to decide based on their doctor's advice.|$|E

This study was performed among the Dutch participants of IMPACT, a large international study {{on the effectiveness of}} PSA screening among BRCA mutation carriers. Materials and methodsUrinary PCA 3 was measured in 191 BRCA 1 mutation carriers, 75 BRCA 2 mutation carriers, and 308 noncarriers. The physicians and participants were blinded for the results. Serum PSA level≥ 3. 0 ng/ml was used to indicate <b>prostate</b> <b>biopsies.</b> PCA 3 was evaluated (1) as an independent indicator for <b>prostate</b> <b>biopsies</b> and (2) as an indicator for <b>prostate</b> <b>biopsies</b> among men with an elevated PSA level. PC detected up to the 2 -year screening was used as gold standard as end-of-study biopsies were not performed. ResultsOverall, 23 PCs were diagnosed, 20 of which were in men who had an elevated PSA level in the initial screening round. (1) PCA 3, successfully determined in 552 participants, was elevated in 188 (cutoff≥ 25; 34 %) or 134 (cutoff≥ 35; 24 %) participants, including 2 of the 3 PCs missed by PSA. PCA 3 would have added 157 (≥ 25; 28 %) or 109 (≥ 35; 20 %) biopsy sessions to screening with PSA only. (2) Elevated PCA 3 as a requirement for biopsies in addition to PSA would have saved 37 (cutoff≥ 25) or 43 (cutoff≥ 35) of the 68 biopsy sessions, and 7 or 11 PCs would have been missed, respectively, including multiple high-risk PCs. So far, PCA 3 performed best among BRCA 2 mutation carriers, but the numbers are still small. Because PCA 3 was not used to indicate <b>prostate</b> <b>biopsies,</b> its true diagnostic value cannot be calculated. ConclusionsThe results do not provide evidence for PCA 3 as a useful additional indicator of <b>prostate</b> <b>biopsies</b> in BRCA mutation carriers, as many participants had an elevated PCA 3 in the absence of PC.

Methods: Thirty-two patients underwent a series of 12 <b>prostate</b> <b>biopsies</b> under local anesthesia performed by 1 operator using a TRUS probe combined with specific third-party software to verify that the biopsies were indeed conducted within the planned targets.

We report histological modifications observed in <b>prostate</b> <b>biopsies</b> of 56 patients, performed 6  months after VTP using the photosensitizer TOOKAD® Soluble (WST 11) and low-energy laser administered in the tumor area transperineally by optic fibers.

Mild chronic inflammation, hemosiderin, and coagulative necrosis were also observed. When residual cancer was present in a treated lobe (17 patients), it was always located outside the scar, most often close to the prostate capsule, and it showed no therapy-related modification.

40|$|PURPOSE: To {{improve the}} {{specificity}} in prostate cancer diagnosis {{and to prevent}} unnecessary <b>prostate</b> <b>biopsies,</b> especially in the serum prostate-specific antigen (PSA) "gray zone" between 3 and 15 ng/mL, the implementation of prostate cancer-specific markers is urgently needed. The recently discovered prostate cancer antigen 3 (PCA 3) is such a promising prostate cancer marker. In a previous single institution study, the PCA 3 urine test clearly proved to be of diagnostic value. Therefore, the diagnostic performance of the PCA 3 urine test was validated in a multicenter study. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: The first voided urine after digital rectal examination was collected from a total of 583 men with serum PSA levels between 3 and 15 ng/mL who were to undergo <b>prostate</b> <b>biopsies.</b> We determined the PCA 3 score in these samples and correlated the results {{with the results of}} the <b>prostate</b> <b>biopsies.</b> RESULTS: A total of 534 men (92 %) had an informative sample. The area under the receiver-operating characteristic curve, a measure of the diagnostic accuracy of a test, was 0. 66 for the PCA 3 urine test and 0. 57 for serum PSA. The sensitivity for the PCA 3 urine test was 65 %, the specificity was 66 % (versus 47 % for serum PSA), and the negative predictive value was 80 %. CONCLUSIONS: In this multicenter study, we validated the diagnostic performance of the PCA 3 urine test in the largest group studied thus far using a PCA 3 gene-based test. This study shows that the PCA 3 urine test, when used as a reflex test, can improve the specificity in prostate cancer diagnosis and could prevent many unnecessary <b>prostate</b> <b>biopsies...</b>|$|R
