40|$|Introduction: Appendicitis is {{a common}} urgent {{surgical}} operation. Since early {{diagnosis and treatment of}} appendicitis is necessary and also some disease mimic its clinical manifestation and rate of negative appendectomy was high (15 - 30 %), so surgeons were trying to increase the accuracy of diagnosis of appendicitis by using laboratory facilities. The main aim of this study were to investigation of Sensitivity and Specificity CRP in the diagnosis of acute appendicitis and compare it with routine laboratory tests such as leukocyte count and neutrophil count. Material and Methods: In this descriptive - analytical study, blood samples of 191 patients with diagnosis of acute appendicitis that underwent appendectomy at the Besat hospital, were used to measuring of CRP. The surgical specimens were reviewed by pathologists and pathologic findings were considered as gold standard. Then by using of the results of pathology tests, sensitivity, specificity and positive and negative predictive value of CRP, WBC and neutrophils were measured. Data were analysed by SPSS- 14 software and t test and chi square test. Results: 74 / 3 % of patients were male and 25 / 7 % female and the mean age was 26 ± 3 / 4 years. The most common symptom, sign and pathologic stage of patients were loss of appetite (95 / 2 %), local tenderness (95 / 8 %) and Acute suppurative (64 / 9 %). 08 / 13 % of patients had normal appendectomies that consist of 35 % of women and 6 % of men appendectomy. The sensitivity and specificity of CRP, WBC and neutrophils respectively were: 98 / 1 %, 61 / 5 %, 84 / 8 %, 50 %, 93 / 3 % and 19. 2 %. Conclusion: According to the results, the CRP test at diagnosis and in finding of negative appendectomy has high value. But wasn't reliable as an exclusive test. Therefore, the use of CRP as a <b>paraclinical</b> <b>criterion</b> along with other criteria of Alvarado scoring system can be very useful in diagnosis of appendicitis...|$|E
40|$|SUMMARY – Multiple {{sclerosis}} (MS) is {{a chronic}} demyelinating neurologic disorder that ma-inly affects young individuals (aged 20 to 50 years). Approximately 85 % of patients experience an initial course with relapses and remissions (relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis). Guidelines {{for the management}} of MS should be focused on three main areas: (a) the diagnosis of MS; (b) treatment of relapses; and (c) long-term preventive treatment including clinical follow up, dose adjustment, drug switch, control of therapeutic efficacy, and disease progression. Diagnosis should be established according to clinical and <b>paraclinical</b> <b>criteria.</b> Discussion on therapeutic recommendations is focu-sed on the disease-modifying agents in acute phases and drugs for long-term treatment and sympto-matic treatment. Differential diagnoses {{must be taken into account}} on making the diagnosis of MS. Therefore, diagnosis of MS should be established on clinical and radiological diagnostic criteria...|$|R
40|$|New {{criteria}} for the diagnosis of multiple sclerosis (MS) were published {{as the result of}} an internationally formed committee. To increase the specificity of diagnosis and to minimize the number of false diagnoses, the committee recommended the use of both clinical and <b>paraclinical</b> <b>criteria,</b> the latter involving information obtained from magnetic resonance imaging, evoked potentials, and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis. Although rigorous magnetic resonance imaging requirements were provided, the "new criteria paper" fell short in terms of guidelines as to how the CSF analysis should be performed and simply equated the IgG index with isoelectric focusing, without any justification. The spectrum of parameters analyzed and methods, for CSF analysis differ worldwide and often yield variable results in terms of sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, and reliability, with no decided "optimal" CSF test for the diagnosis of MS. To address this question specifically, an international panel of experts in MS and CSF diagnostic techniques was convened and the result was this article, representing a consensus of all the participants. These recommendations for establishing a standard for the evaluation of CSF in patients suspected of having MS should greatly complement the new criteria in ensuring that a correct diagnosis of MS is being made...|$|R
40|$|International audienceBACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: To produce {{up-to-date}} {{clinical practice}} guidelines on {{the prevention of}} venous thromboembolism in surgery and obstetrics. METHODS: A Steering Committee defined {{the scope of the}} topic, the questions to be answered, and the assessment criteria. Eight multidisciplinary working groups (total of 70 experts) performed a critical appraisal of the literature in the following disciplines: pharmacology of antithrombotic agents, orthopaedics; general surgery (gastrointestinal (GI) and varicose vein surgery); urology; gynaecology and obstetrics; thoracic, cardiac and vascular surgery; surgery of the head, neck and spine; and surgery of burns patients. The resultant reports and guidelines were submitted for comment and completion of the Appraisal of Guidelines Research & Evaluation questionnaire to a total of 150 peer reviewers, before producing definite guidelines. RESULTS: The report answers the following questions for each type of surgery: (i) What is the venous thromboembolism incidence according to clinical and/or <b>paraclinical</b> <b>criteria</b> in the absence of prophylaxis? (with stratification of venous thromboembolism risk into low, moderate and high categories); (ii) What is the efficacy and safety of the prophylactic measures used? (iii) When should prophylaxis be introduced and how long should it last? (iv) Does ambulatory surgery affect efficacy and safety of prophylaxis? CONCLUSIONS: Apart from answering the above questions, the guidelines provide a summary table for each discipline. This table stratifies types of surgery into the three risk categories, specifies the recommended prophylaxis for venous thromboembolism (pharmacological and/or mechanical) and grades each recommendation. In addition, whenever appropriate, the recommended prophylaxis is adjusted to low- and high-risk patients...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{assess the}} {{clinical}} relevance {{of a positive}} voltage-gated potassium channel (VGKC) test in patients lacking antibodies to LGI 1 and Caspr 2. METHODS: VGKC-positive patients were tested for LGI 1 and Caspr 2 antibodies. Patients lacking both antibodies were matched (1 : 2) to VGKC-negative patients. Clinical and <b>paraclinical</b> <b>criteria</b> were used to blindly determine evidence for autoimmune inflammation in both groups. Patients with an inconclusive VGKC titer were analyzed in the same way. RESULTS: A total of 1, 455 patients were tested by VGKC radioimmunoassay. Fifty-six patients tested positive, 50 of whom were available to be included. Twenty-five patients had antibodies to LGI 1 (n = 19) or Caspr 2 (n = 6) and 25 patients lacked both antibodies. Evidence for autoimmune inflammation was present in 7 (28 %) of the VGKC-positive patients lacking LGI 1 and Caspr 2, compared to 9 (18 %) of the VGKC-negative controls (p = 0. 38). Evidence for autoimmune inflammation was mainly found in patients with limbic encephalitis/encephalomyelitis (57 %), but not in other clinical phenotypes (5 %, p < 0. 01). VGKC titers were significantly higher in patients with antibodies to LGI 1 or Caspr 2 (p < 0. 001). However, antibodies to Caspr 2 could also be detected in patients with inconclusive low VGKC titer, while many VGKC-positive patients had no evidence for autoimmune inflammation. CONCLUSIONS: VGKC positivity {{in the absence of}} antibodies to LGI 1 and Caspr 2 is not a clear marker for autoimmune inflammation and seems not to contribute in clinical practice. No cutoff value for the VGKC titer was appropriate to discriminate between patients with and without autoimmune inflammation...|$|R
40|$|International audienceOBJECTIVE: To {{establish}} {{a set of}} clinical and <b>paraclinical</b> <b>criteria</b> potentially useful as a diagnostic screening tool for polyarteritis nodosa (PAN). METHODS: The abilities of individual descriptive items to predict a diagnosis of PAN were evaluated by screening available data from 949 patients from the French Vasculitis Study Group database, including 262 with PAN and 687 with control vasculitides. Selected items were tested in a logistic regression model to {{establish a}} minimal set of nonredundant PAN-predictive criteria. The discriminative accuracy of these items and of the American College of Rheumatology (ACR) 1990 criteria were assessed by reapplying them to the initial patient sample and a subgroup restricted to PAN and microscopic polyangiitis (MPA) patients. A computer simulation procedure was conducted on artificially generated patient data to evaluate the usefulness of these criteria in predicting a diagnosis of PAN. RESULTS: The analysis resulted in the retention of 3 positive predictive parameters (hepatitis B virus antigen and/or DNA in serum, arteriographic anomalies, and mononeuropathy or polyneuropathy) and 5 negative predictive parameters (indirect immunofluorescence detection of antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody; asthma; ear, nose, and throat signs; glomerulopathy; and cryoglobulinemia) for the criteria set. These criteria yielded 70. 6 % sensitivity for all control vasculitides and 89. 7 % for MPA controls, with 92. 3 % specificity for all controls and 83. 1 % for MPA controls. The discriminant abilities of this set of items outperformed the ACR 1990 criteria in all analytical situations, showing better robustness to variations in the prevalence of individual vasculitides. CONCLUSION: The use {{of positive and negative}} discriminant criteria could constitute a sound basis for developing a diagnostic tool for PAN to be used by clinicians. Further prospective analyses and validations in different populations are needed to confirm these items as satisfactory diagnostic criteria...|$|R
40|$|International audienceIn disease-endemic areas, {{histoplasmosis}} is {{the main}} differential diagnosis for tuberculosis among human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) -infected patients. However, no study has compared the two diseases. Thus, {{the objective of this}} study was to compare tuberculosis and histoplasmosis in HIV-infected patients. A population of 205 HIV-infected patients (99 with tuberculosis and 106 with histoplasmosis) hospitalized in Cayenne, French Guiana during January 1, 1997 -December 31, 2008 were selected retrospectively from the French Hospital Database on HIV. Multivariate analysis showed that tuberculosis was associated with cough (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] = 0. 20, 95 % confidence interval [CI] = 0. 05 - 0. 73) and a C-reactive protein level > 70 mg/L (AOR = 0. 98, 95 % CI = 0. 97 - 0. 99). Variables associated with disseminated histoplasmosis were a γ-glutamyl transferase level > 72 IU/L (AOR = 4. 99, 95 % CI = 1. 31 - 18. 99), origin from French Guiana (AOR = 5. 20, 95 % CI = 1. 30 - 20. 73), disseminated localization (AOR = 6. 40, 95 % CI = 1. 44 - 28. 45), a concomitant opportunistic infection (AOR = 6. 71, 95 % CI = 1. 50 - 29. 96), a neutrophil count < 2, 750 cells/mm(3) (AOR = 10. 54, 95 % CI = 2. 83 - 39. 24), a CD 4 cell count < 60 cells/mm(3) (AOR = 11. 62, 95 % CI = 2. 30 - 58. 63), and a platelet count < 150, 000 /mm(3) (AOR = 19. 20, 95 % CI = 3. 35 - 110. 14).

40|$|PURPOSE: Magnetic {{resonance}} imaging (MRI) {{has become a}} valuable tool for diagnosing and monitoring multiple sclerosis (MS). The high sensitivity {{for the detection of}} hyperintense lesions in T 2 -weighted scans contributes substantially to diagnosis. The initial lesion number or lesion volume stands for an increased probability of further accumulation of lesion burden, an earlier conversion to clinically definite MS and progression of disability in the next 5 - 15 years. This diagnostic and prognostic information gained from MRI early in the disease course lead in 2001 to a revision of the diagnostic criteria. MATERIALS AND METHODS: For the first time MRI criteria were defined in addition to the clinical and <b>paraclinical</b> <b>criteria</b> using the clinical terms for dissemination with respect to space and time. In particular, the defined MRI criteria are based on lesion number and location, the appearance of new lesions and lesion enhancement using contrast agent. RESULTS: Reliable detection and description of older and new lesions in the disease course by MRI represents subclinical disease activity which can substitute the clinical confirmation of a relapse leading to an earlier diagnosis. This places importance on the assessment of the subclinical disease activity in sequential MR scans requiring a standardized and reproducible approach to minimize variability despite different MR scanners. CONCLUSION: This review provides an updated proposal for the approach and management of cranial and spinal MR scans in patients with MS. We describe the influence of variables which cannot be standardized (scanner, field strength, manufacturer and software) and outline potential pitfalls of clinical MR imaging in MS resulting from a non-standardized approach. This updated proposal for slice positioning, sequences and documentation is a result of a consensus process targeting systematic and standardized use in clinical MR evaluations of MS...|$|R

40|$|History and Objectives: Thyroid {{disorders}} are variant in different regions. Considering {{the significance of}} thyroid disorders, time-consuming and costly diagnostic methods and {{the suggestion of a}} scoring for early diagnosis, this study was carried out to compare the clinical and <b>paraclinical</b> <b>criteria</b> for thyroid disorders in referrals over 15 years in health centers of Kashan from 1997 to 2000. Materials and Methods: This diagnostic strategy of this study was conducted on patients at an age range of 15 - 60 years and suspicious to have thyroid disorders. In this respect, Flipp Fling scoring was used. A net score greater than 18 was considered hyperthyroidism, between 11 and 18 was considered as suspicious and less than 11 was considered as euthyroidism. In hypothyroid scoring, net score greater than 19 was considered as hypothyroidism. For all patients, measurement of T 3, Free T 4 and TSH was requested. Patients with TSH level lower than 0. 3 microgram and T 4 greater than 12 and T 3 greater than 180 microgram were considered as hyperthyroid and patients with TSH level greater than 5 microgram and T 4 less than 4 and T 3 less than 8 microgram were considered as hypothyroid. Results: This study was carried out on 200 patients. Out of 150 suspicious cases, 31 (20. 7) were male and 119 (79. 3) were female. In addition, 100 out of them were supposed to have hyperthyroidism and 50 were supposed to have hypothyroidism. Most of the hypothyroid patients were female (80). 78 of hypothyroid patients were female. Therefore, thyroid disorder was more common in female ones. Sensitivity of scoring method for hyperthyroid state was 91 and for hypothyroid state was 76. Conclusion and Recommendations: Considering the costly paraclinical tests, Flipp Fling criteria are recommended to be used for diagnosis of thyroid disorders...|$|R
40|$|There was studied an {{expediency}} and diagnostic {{value of}} using an intensity of clinical symptoms, general blood analysis, interleikin- 6 and - 8 {{content in the}} blood serum for the early diagnostics of the acute nonstreptococcus tonsillopharyngites in children. The aim of the work was to study the diagnostic value of the general clinical and paraclinical indicators in verification of nonstreptococcus etiology of acute tonsillopharyhgites in children and for optimization of its treatment. Methods. There were examined 98 patients with acute tonsillopharyngites: 66 persons with nonstreptococcus etiology and 32 children with diagnosis “acute streptococcus tonsillopharyngitis”. The streptococcus etiology was proved by the positive result of cultural study of throat swab. As auxiliary <b>paraclinical</b> <b>criteria</b> of confirmation of nonstreptococcus etiology of ATP in patients of comparison group were analyzed the indices of general blood analysis and interleikin- 6 (IL- 6) and IL- 8 content in the blood serum. Results. The intensity of clinical symptoms that were assessed on MacIsaac scale and indices of the general blood analysis cannot be used independently for the early diagnostics of ATP of nonstreptococcus etiology because of insufficient sensitivity of these methods. The development of acute nonstreptococcus tonsillopharyngitis in children is attended with the normal indices of interleikin- 6 concentration and the lowered interleikin- 8 content in the blood serum. Conclusions. To determine the tactics of starting treatment in children with symptoms of acute tonsillopharyngitis {{it can be used}} the next clinical and paraclinical complex: the general sum of points on MacIsaac scale, interleikin- 6 level, and IL- 8 content in the blood serum.

40|$|Introduction. Significant {{polymorphism}} {{of clinical}} manifestations of infectious mononucleosis, multisystemic lesions, frequent lack of clear clinical and <b>paraclinical</b> <b>criteria</b> and delayed results of available laboratory tests, and sometimes impossibility of their execution complicate {{the diagnosis of}} the disease in prehospital stage and on admission to hospital. Objective of the study: to optimize the {{diagnosis and treatment of}} infectious mononucleosis in children by examining current features of the course and analyzing the diagnostic value of clinical and instrumental parameters in the verification of the disease. Materials and methods. On the basis of infectious boxed unit of respiratory infections of Municipal Healthcare Institution «Regional Children’s Hospital» (Chernivtsi), there were examined 65 children with infectious mononucleosis, who were hospitalized in the period of 2014 – 2015. The first clinical group (I) consisted of 42 children, the final clinical diagnosis of the disease in them was verified on the basis of comprehensive clinical and hematological criteria, the second (II) clinical group included 23 patients with serologically confirmed infectious mononucleosis. In terms of the main clinical signs, the observation groups were not significantly different. Results. It was found that for children with infectious mononucleosis, such clinical features are typical: sudden onset of the disease (in  93. 8  %) with fever higher than 37. 5  °C (80  %), the presence of exudative tonsillitis (81. 6  %), submandibular and cervical lymphadenopathy (in  90. 7  %), difficulty in nasal breathing (in  78. 4  %), and nasal voice (in  73. 8  %). In confirmation of Epstein-Barr virus infectious mononucleosis, phenomena of exudative tonsillitis and lymphadenopathy were highly sensitive (90 and 95  %, respectively), but with a high proportion of false positive results. Conclusion. Thus, given the lack of diagnostic value of clinical-anamnestic and sonographic parameters in identifying Epstein-Barr virus infectious mononucleosis in children, as evidenced by low values of the likelihood ratio and risk indicators, their use is expedient only in the combination...|$|R

40|$|IntroductionSarcoidosis is a {{systemic}} granulomatous disease of unknown etiology. Cardiac involvements {{in patients with}} sarcoidosis are rare with an estimated prevalence of 7 %. These serious involvements are hard to diagnose at early stage of disease. Patients and MethodsWe performed a retrospective study of patients’ files diagnosed with sarcoidosis in the Internal Medicine Department of Rabta University Hospital in Tunis. The diagnosis of sarcoidosis was based on clinical, <b>paraclinical</b> and histological <b>criteria.</b> Cardiac involvements were confirmed by the electrocardiogram and echocardiography. ResultsCardiac involvement (CI) was found in seven patients among 138 with sarcoidosis (5 %). They were 6 females and one male {{with a mean age}} at diagnosis of 49 years. Electrical disorders such as bundel branch block were seen in two cases. First degree atrioventricular block was noted in two cases. Ventricular hypertrophy was check out in two cases by electrocardiography and ultrasound. Mitral regurgitation with a flutter was noted in one patient and pericardial effusion with a normal ventricular function in another case. Only one patient was clinically symptomatic, he complained of palpitations. Thallium 201 scintigraphy was performed in one case and objectived reversible ischemia of the inferior and latero-inferior walls of myocardium. Other manifestations of sarcoidosis were dominantly associated to CI such as lung disease, which was found in all patients. Skin and neurological involvement were observed, each in three cases. Hepatosplenic involvements were noted in two patients and otorhinolaryngology involvements in one case. All patients received initially high dose of corticosteroids. Four of the patients had a good response to treatment and three were lost to follow up.
