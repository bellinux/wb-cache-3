40|$|The {{anisotropic}} and magic-angle {{fluorescence decay}} {{of the single}} tryptophan (Trp) residue of melittin, a bee venom peptide, was investigated by time-resolved fluorescence anisotropy using a streak camera setup. The peptide was dissolved either in distilled water or in Hepes/NaOH buffer containing low (10 mM) or high (2 M) concentrations of NaCl, the latter resulting in tetramerized melittin. For melittin in distilled water and low NaCl concentration, two anisotropy decay times {{were found in the}} order of ∼ 50 and ∼ 800 <b>picoseconds,</b> reflecting local and overall peptide dynamics, respectively, and for tetramerized melittin, two anisotropy decay times of ∼ 200 and ∼ 5500 <b>picoseconds</b> were found. Decay-associated spectra of the isotropic fluorescence decay show three time components in the range of ∼ 20 <b>picoseconds,</b> ∼ 500 <b>picoseconds,</b> and ∼ 3500 <b>picoseconds,</b> respectively. The relative amplitudes of the latter two change upon the self-association of melittin. This change {{can be explained by the}} existence of different rotamers of Trp in melittin, of which one is more favored in the melittin tetramer than in the melittin monomer...|$|R

25|$|In optics, an ultrashort {{pulse of}} light is an {{electromagnetic}} pulse whose time duration {{is of the}} order of a <b>picosecond</b> (1012 second) or less. Such pulses have a broadband optical spectrum, and can be created by mode-locked oscillators. They are commonly referred to as ultrafast events. Amplification of ultrashort pulses almost always requires the technique of chirped pulse amplification, in order to avoid damage to the gain medium of the amplifier.|$|E
25|$|Recent {{advances}} have enabled MEMS-based timing devices to offer performance levels similar, and sometimes superior, to quartz devices. MEMS oscillator signal quality {{as measured by}} phase noise is now sufficient for most applications. Phase noise of -150 dBc at 10kHz from 10MHz is now available, a level that is generally only needed for radio frequency (RF) applications. MEMS oscillators are now available with integrated jitter under 1.0 <b>picosecond,</b> measured from 12kHz to 20MHz, a level that is normally required for high speed serial data links, such as SONET and SyncE, and some instrumentation applications.|$|E

Trousers and socks have been infused with nanotechnology {{so that they will}} last longer and keep people cool in the summer. Bandages are being infused with silver nanoparticles to heal cuts faster. Video game consoles and personal computers may become cheaper, faster, and contain more memory thanks to nanotechnology. Also, to build structures for on chip computing with light, for example on chip optical quantum information processing, and <b>picosecond</b> transmission of information.|$|E

25|$|A {{number of}} {{speculative}} mechanisms have been advanced to counter this, {{the most widely}} discussed being water memory, though this is now considered erroneous since short-range order in water only persists for about 1 <b>picosecond.</b> No evidence of stable clusters of water molecules was found when homeopathic preparations were studied using nuclear magnetic resonance, and many other physical experiments in homeopathy {{have been found to}} be of low methodological quality, which precludes any meaningful conclusion. Existence of a pharmacological effect in the absence of any true active ingredient is inconsistent with the law of mass action and the observed dose-response relationships characteristic of therapeutic drugs (whereas placebo effects are non-specific and unrelated to pharmacological activity).|$|E
25|$|Nonlinear {{two-dimensional}} {{infrared spectroscopy}} is the infrared version of correlation spectroscopy. Nonlinear two-dimensional infrared spectroscopy {{is a technique}} that has become available {{with the development of}} femtosecond infrared laser pulses. In this experiment, first a set of pump pulses is applied to the sample. This is followed by a waiting time during which the system is allowed to relax. The typical waiting time lasts from zero to several picoseconds, and the duration can be controlled with a resolution of tens of femtoseconds. A probe pulse is then applied, resulting in the emission of a signal from the sample. The nonlinear two-dimensional infrared spectrum is a two-dimensional correlation plot of the frequency ω1 that was excited by the initial pump pulses and the frequency ω3 excited by the probe pulse after the waiting time. This allows the observation of coupling between different vibrational modes; because of its extremely fine time resolution, {{it can be used to}} monitor molecular dynamics on a <b>picosecond</b> timescale. It is still a largely unexplored technique and is becoming increasingly popular for fundamental research.|$|E

Here a series of mirrors reflects the beams to impinge in the center of the bay from all angles. Optical devices in some of the paths slow the beams so that they all reach the center at the same time (within about a <b>picosecond),</b> as some of the beams have longer paths to the center than others. Frequency multipliers upconvert the light to green and blue (UV) just prior to entering the [...] "target chamber". Nova is arranged so any remaining IR or green light is focused short of the center of the chamber.|$|E
40|$|We {{investigate}} in {{this paper}} the dynamics of entanglement between a QD spin qubit and a single photon qubit inside a quantum network node, {{as well as its}} robustness against various decoherence processes. First, the entanglement dynamics is considered without decoherence. In the small detuning regime (Δ= 78 [*]μeV), there are three different conditions for maximum entanglement, which occur after 71, 93, and 116 <b>picoseconds</b> of interaction time. In the large detuning regime (Δ= 1. 5 [*]meV), there is only one peak for maximum entanglement occurring at 625 <b>picoseconds.</b> Second, the entanglement dynamics is considered with decoherence by including the effects of spin-nucleus and hole-nucleus hyperfine interactions. In the small detuning regime, a decent amount of entanglement (35 % entanglement) can only be obtained within 200 <b>picoseconds</b> of interaction. Afterward, all entanglement is lost. In the large detuning regime, a smaller amount of entanglement is realized, namely, 25 %. And, it lasts only within the first 300 <b>picoseconds...</b>|$|R
