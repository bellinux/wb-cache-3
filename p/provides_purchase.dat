40|$|Objective To {{determine}} whether Dexon mesh, closely {{applied to the}} kidney, <b>provides</b> <b>purchase</b> for sutures to permit bladder/parenchymal apposition on autotransplantation and that, if this line of apposition were some distance from but surrounding renal papillae, urothelium would proliferate to cover exposed parenchyma to form a widely patent lumen; this should facilitate removal of the whole of an upper tract collecting system, retaining renal parenchyma alone. Materials and methods To test this possibility and explore the practicability of the concept. nine dogs underwent bilateral nephrectomny followed by unilateral autotransplantation; the other kidney was discarded. Because the canine renal pelvis is intrarenal, the ureter was stretched maximally before passing fine scissors into the renal hilum to transect the collecting system {{as close to the}} kidney as possible in six of the nine dogs. In the remaining three dogs, partial nephrectomy was performed with division of the calyceal necks under vision. Thinned bladder wall was sutured to Dexon mesh some distance from the collecting tubules: omentum was applied to the suture line. Results Three dogs were killed prematurely a...|$|E

Noise reduction research will lower the lawsuit costs from noise pollution, {{and the introduction of}} advanced turbofans for long, short, and medium range flights, advanced commuter planes, and advanced SSTs offering projected 50 % increases in current aircraft efficiencies are seen to be limited only by the airlines' ability to <b>provide</b> <b>purchase</b> financing, rather than by a lack of available new technology...|$|R
40|$|Purpose—Little {{is known}} about the current state of {{industry}} standards subscriptions in U. S. libraries. In this age of electronic access and tightening budgets, many libraries are re-examining whether or not to alter paper subscriptions of standards to electronic versions and/or switch to on-demand delivery. Design/Methodology—Two surveys were conducted in an attempt to gauge the extent to which other libraries are currently collecting standards in electronic format, or <b>providing</b> on-demand <b>purchasing</b> for industry standards. Findings—The number of libraries purchasing electronic standards or <b>providing</b> on-demand <b>purchasing</b> in 2003 appears to be incongruous with comments from both surveys. In the 2001 survey, librarians could not find ways to fund on-demand purchasing and in the 2003 survey, a number of libraries were purchasing some sets on an irregular basis to save money. A little over half (51 %) of the responding libraries provide electronic versions of standards and sixty percent indicated they <b>provide</b> on-demand <b>purchasing</b> of individual standards. Originality/Value—Survey responses resulted in several local changes to improve patron success rates at acquiring industry standard including: created a publicly-searchable database of locally-available standards, initiated a purchase on-demand process, worked with Interlibrary Loan (ILL) staff to determine which standards would be better to purchase versus request on ILL, and became more adept at reference interviews involving requests for standards...|$|R

40|$|An {{important}} claim {{made for}} second-generation accounts of cognition {{is that they}} help {{solve the problem of}} dualism, which arguably remains unchallenged in much literary criticism. Kafka's short story “Ein Hungerkunstler” (A Hunger Artist) is about a profoundly embodied experience of (unsuccessfully) denying embodiment: fasting to death. With this text's cognitive realism as my focal point, I use insights from second-generation cognitive science (which acknowledges the embodied, embedded, enactive, and extended nature of human cognition), including research on eating disorders and starvation, to <b>provide</b> <b>purchase</b> on two traditional literary-critical concerns: thematic interpretation and paradox. I also suggest that a first-person perspective which acknowledges the complexities of individual real-world embodiment may sometimes enrich cognitive literary studies. This combined first-person and second-generation methodology can help us recognize that for the real people who read our scholarship and learn from us, the dangers of dualism are ethically as well as interpretively profound. </p...|$|R
