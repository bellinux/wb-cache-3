5|$|Electricity is {{distributed}} by the Brihanmumbai Electric Supply and Transport (BEST) undertaking in the island city, and by Reliance Energy, Tata Power, and the Maharashtra State Electricity Distribution Co. Ltd (Mahavitaran) in the suburbs. Consumption of electricity is growing faster than production capacity. Power supply cables are underground, which reduces <b>pilferage,</b> thefts and other losses.|$|E
5|$|Caching is {{inhibited}} by {{the presence}} of Steller's jays (Cyanocitta stelleri) and grey jays from adjacent territories, which follow resident grey jays to steal cached food. Grey jays carry large food items to distant cache sites for storage more often than small food items. To prevent theft, they also tend to carry valuable food items further from the source when caching in the company of one or more grey jays. Scatterhoarding discourages <b>pilferage</b> by competitors, while increased cache density leads to increased thievery. In southern portions of the grey jay's range, food is not cached during summer because of the chance of spoilage and the reduced need for winter stores.|$|E

Worse, these are being sent to enemy rebels. A case of government’s arm used to kill a government soldier.All these incidents concretized the moral fiber of the Magdalo Group. The support of the public slowly calibrates to a high gear as days pass by. The issues brought to light, what the group had been saying all along.The unfolding drama was given more taste when in June 2005 the “Hello Garci” Scandal surfaced. It reaffirmed the theory that Gloria Macapagal Arroyo at the instance of the COMELEC cheated her closest rival Fernando Poe, Jr. to win the 2004 Presidential Election.|$|R

25|$|When packagers and {{retailers}} are willing, {{there are many}} possible solutions to allow easy access to package contents. Easy access, however, can also allow more <b>pilferage</b> and shoplifting.|$|E
25|$|Packaging {{sometimes}} {{must be made}} {{difficult to}} open. For example, regulations dictate that some over-the-counter drugs have tamper resistance to deter unauthorized opening before delivery to the intended customer and be in child-resistant packaging. Other packages are intentionally made difficult to open to reduce package <b>pilferage</b> and shoplifting.|$|E
2500|$|Security – Packaging {{can play}} an {{important}} role in reducing the security risks of shipment. [...] Packages can be made with improved tamper resistance to deter manipulation and they can also have tamper-evident features indicating that tampering has taken place. Packages can be engineered to help reduce the risks of package <b>pilferage</b> or the theft and resale of products: [...] Some package constructions are more resistant to <b>pilferage</b> than other types, and some have pilfer-indicating seals. Counterfeit consumer goods, unauthorized sales (diversion), material substitution and tampering can all be minimized or prevented with such anti-counterfeiting technologies. Packages may include authentication seals and use security printing to help indicate that the package and contents are not counterfeit. Packages also can include anti-theft devices such as dye-packs, RFID tags, or electronic article surveillance tags that can be activated or detected by devices at exit points and require specialized tools to deactivate. [...] Using packaging in this way is a means of retail loss prevention.|$|E
5000|$|While {{studying}} at Bucharest Academy of Economic Studies, Nae Lăzărescu {{performed in a}} satirical theater group, as a beginner, and after this huge start in his career, he worked at Romanian Rhapsodie, in the platform section. He has the unique chance to befriend {{with one of the}} most important singers from 1970's Romania, Aurelian Andreescu; the actor, recalls his past memories about it: [...] "From joke to joke I am what you see. I do a lot of <b>pilferages</b> along this life. After my friend, Aurelian Andreescu died, I stop this actions. Since then, 30 years or more passed. Soon I will stop the others too ...". The debut came for Nae in 1963, when he embraced a job as an actor at Constantin Tănase Theater, a fulfillment for 50 years, more precisely, for a lifetime, along with his stage partner, Vasile Muraru, their couplets have been written in the Romanian history of art, centuries from this moment, because their humor was a strong one, with a lot of connotations for the Romanian politics, and for the poor life conditions.|$|R
40|$|The network {{availability}} of the wireless network {{can be viewed as}} broader concept of network reliability. Reliability is a unique quality of wireless network and it is regarded as key parameter for business success of the telecom service providers. The network availability however is often compromised with outages caused by various factors and amongst the factors, inadequate energy at the base stations is the major outage-contributing factor. Due to unreliable electrical grid supply at many base stations, diesel generators are deployed to the stations as an alternative source of energy. The diesel generators incur high operating expenses. This paper presents a quantitative approach for measurement and estimation of diesel fuel consumption based on uptime hours of various equipments installed at the base station site. It also introduces a new parameter called energy conservation factor, which determines amount of energy transfer to the battery-bank while charging the battery with power from an external source such as grid, diesel generator. This model while presenting a new management perspective for effective utilization of the conserved energy of the battery-bank also attempts to reduce waste such as fuel losses and <b>pilferages.</b> We also describe how the method introduced in this paper can assist management in planning and preparation of fuel budget for a particular base station or the entire wireless network...|$|R
40|$|The {{increased}} use of CCTV surveillance in the Zimbabwean manufacturing sector, the declining sectorâ€™s contribution to the GDP over the past years, and the inconclusive previous studies world-wide on the impact that CCTV surveillance in manufacturing industry has on Company Performance necessitated the current study. The researcher sought to achieve specific objectives, namely: (1) To evaluate the effect of CCTV surveillance on theft (<b>pilferages)</b> in Zimbabwean manufacturing companies, (2) To establish the impact of CCTV surveillance on wastages in the countryâ€™s manufacturing companies, (3) To assess the influence that CCTV surveillance has on employee productivity in the Zimbabwean manufacturing sector, (4) To investigate the importance of CCTV surveillance on employee safety in Zimbabwean manufacturing companies, (5) To ascertain the role that CCTV surveillance plays on ensuring property safety in Zimbabwean manufacturing industry, and (6) To {{come up with a}} set of recommendations that will assist the business community in decision making and the academic community in the field of research. The research design adopted was quantitative in nature while the ontological and epistemological assumptions that were held by the researcher were those of objectivism. A questionnaire was used to gather data from randomly selected manufacturing companies in Harare and judgemental sampling was employed to deliberately select Production Managers for their knowledge and experience in the area of study. Of the 192 questionnaires that were personally distributed, 139 responses were obtained. The findings of this study were that the use of CCTV surveillance in the Zimbabwean manufacturing industry leads to a decrease in wastages and theft while it improves employee productivity, employee safety as well as property safety. The conclusion was that CCTV surveillance in the manufacturing sector improves company performance and a causal formula was suggested by the researcher. It was also concluded that the findings can be generalized to other parts of Zimbabwe and other countries. Finally, managerial, policy and general recommendations are provided...|$|R

2500|$|Since 1926, the BEST {{has been}} {{sourcing}} its power from Tata Power, {{part of the}} Tata Group conglomerate. The power cables are laid underground, which reduces <b>pilferage</b> and other losses that plague most other parts of India. The nominal rating of power supplied by BEST is 3-phase, 50 Hz, 220/110 kV. Unlike the transport company, the electricity department services only the Mumbai City area, and not the suburbs. It provides power to 5 million residential and commercial establishments and over 33,000 street lights within the city limits. As of 2000, BEST supplies a total of , with a consumption of [...] The electricity department has 6,000 employees. The city has four 110-kV, twenty-two 33-kV and 22-kV substations. BEST has a distribution loss of around 10% (2001), among the lowest in India. In 2006, the RPS (Renewable purchase specification) framework [...] came into force, which has made it mandatory for electricity providers to generate or purchase fixed percentage (6% for FY 2009–10) of their power through renewable sources. To comply with this act, BEST plans to install photovoltaic cells in each of its 25 depots. They also plan to use solar power in gardens and street lighting where the demand is low.
