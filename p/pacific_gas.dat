5|$|O'Shaughnessy Dam {{has been}} {{controversial}} since its original construction both for its environmental impact and {{violations of the}} Raker Act {{by the city of}} San Francisco. Although the Raker Act explicitly stated that power and water from the Hetch Hetchy Project could be used only for public purposes, San Francisco has sold Hetch Hetchy power to <b>Pacific</b> <b>Gas</b> & Electric (PG) since 1925. Dam removal advocates have stated that San Francisco's utilization of Yosemite National Park for water and power is unfair because of the damage to tourism and the local environment caused by the dam and reservoir. By draining the reservoir, removing the dam and restoring the valley to its original state, visitors to the park would once again be able to enjoy the natural beauty of Hetch Hetchy – once compared to that of Yosemite Valley. There are other rivers and reservoirs available for San Francisco to replace the water supply, such as the city's currently unused share of water in Lake Don Pedro, the biggest reservoir on the Tuolumne River.|$|E

5000|$|General Electric built two steam turbine-electric {{locomotives}} with a 2+C-C+2 (4-6-6-4) wheel {{arrangement for}} the Union Pacific Railroad in 1938. These locomotives essentially operated as mobile steam {{power plants and}} were correspondingly complex. They were the only condensing steam locomotives ever used in the United States. A Babcock & Wilcox boiler provided steam, which drove a pair of steam turbines which powered a generator, providing power to the electric traction motors that drove the wheels, {{as well as providing}} head-end power {{for the rest of the}} train. Boiler control was largely automatic, and the two locomotives could be connected together into a multiple unit, both controlled from a single cab. The boiler was oil-fired, and the fuel was [...] "Bunker C" [...] heavy fuel oil, the same fuel used in large vessels, and also the fuel which was later used in Union <b>Pacific's</b> <b>gas</b> turbine-electric locomotives. Union Pacific accepted the locomotives in 1939, but returned them later that year, citing unsatisfactory results. The GE turbines were used during a motive power shortage on the Great Northern Railway in 1943, and appear to have performed quite well. However, by the end of 1943, the wheels of both locomotives were worn to the point of needing replacement, and one of the locomotive's boilers developed a defect. The locomotives were returned to GE and dismantled.|$|R

40|$|This article {{describes}} a month-long {{measurement of the}} dimethylsulfide (DMS) air-sea flux and transfer coefficient over the Eastern South <b>Pacific</b> Ocean. The <b>gas</b> transfer coefficient for DMS depended linearly on wind speed. The range of wind speeds was from 1 to 9 m/s. The DMS gas transfer results are of significant interest due to a relatively high solubility of this gas. Extreme situations are useful for validation of theoretical models; the case with DMS {{does not seem to}} be an exception. A linear dependence of the air-sea transfer coefficient on wind speed for this gas appears to differ from the quadratic and cubic wind speed dependence that have been found for less soluble gases such as CO 2 or dual tracers. S 5955 According to the existing parameterizations for the bubble-mediated transport (e. g., Woolf, 1997), for more soluble gases the relative contribution of the interfacial gas transfer component is higher. In the range of wind speeds from 1 to 9 m/s, the bubble-mediated component of the DMS gas transfer is not expected to be significant com...|$|R
40|$|Ph. D. University of Hawaii at Manoa 2015. Includes bibliographical references. Marine aerosol and {{gases in}} the remote marine {{boundary}} layer (MBL) form a critical link between the ocean and atmosphere by regulating aerosol optical properties, cloud formation and properties, photochemistry, and biogeochemical cycles. The sources of marine aerosol were {{once thought to be}} relatively simple: large, primary sea salt aerosol (SSA) from wave-breaking and small, secondary non-sea-salt-SO 2 – 4 (NSS) from condensed oxidation products of the organo-sulfur gas dimethylsulfide (DMS) in the atmosphere. With the advent of faster, more sensitive measurements, contributors to the marine organic and sulfurous aerosol population are coming into sharper focus. Of course, new complications inevitably appear. This dissertation explores components of this increasingly complex chemical story using a rich dataset collected during an airborne experiment in the remote equatorial <b>Pacific.</b> Rapid sulfur <b>gas</b> measurements coupled with size-resolved aerosol chemistry enabled the construction of balanced DMS, SO 2, and NSS budgets that include entrainment and divergence. These two dynamic terms turn out to be critical mechanisms for adding oxidized sulfur to (entrainment) and removing it from (divergence) the remote MBL. Even in cleaner conditions, entrainment of continental material from 10 000 km away can match DMS as a source of NSS to the MBL. During episodes of enhanced long-range transport, distant sources such as biomass burning can eclipse the low-background marine atmosphere. In addition to some entrainment of submicrometer organic species, we were able to detect submicrometer organic aerosol concentrations that varied according to satellite chlorophyll a multiplied by wind speed. This connection strongly suggests emission from the marine biology. The natural marine signal near equatorial upwelling was up to 4 x stronger than other organic aerosol signals. Methanesulfonic acid (MSA), a natural organo-sulfur gas, is often measured but poorly understood. Through our exploration of a unique vertical gradient in highresolution MSA measurements in the MBL, we highlight large unknowns in DMS oxidation chemistry as well as the emerging importance of gas-particle partitioning. We find strong evidence for MSA vapor degassing from small particles in the mixed layer near the warmer, drier ocean surface. There remains much debate and study and concerning the sources of natural aerosol and cloud condensation nuclei...|$|R
