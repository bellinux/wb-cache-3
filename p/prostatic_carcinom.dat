40|$|Magnetic {{resonance}} (MR) imaging {{was used}} to stage prostatic carcinoma in 81 patients with a proved diagnosis. MR imaging findings were correlated with histologic findings regarding the local extent of disease (37 patieNts) {{and the presence of}} nodal metastases (51 patients). Tumor nodules were detected in the peripheral zone (PZ) in 34 of 37 patients and were of low signal intensity compared with the signal of the PZ. Hemorrhage in the PZ represented a problem in tumor detection and in tumor volume measurement. When multiple criteria for local tumor spread were combined, MR imaging had a sensitivity of 72 %, a specificity of 84 %, and an accuracy of 78 % in the differentiation of stage A or B from Stage C or D disease. Assessment of seminal vesicle invasion was more accurate than assessment of direct extracapsular spread. In five patients, microscopic invasion of the capsule (stage C) was classified as stage B with MR imaging; from a clinical standpoint, this should not affect patient treatment and prognosis. The MR imaging sensitivity in the detection of lymph node metastases was 69 %, with a specificity of 95 % and an accuracy of 88 %. In this study MR imaging proved reliable in the comprehensive evaluation and staging of <b>prostatic</b> <b>carcinom...</b>|$|E
