25|$|Successful {{therapeutic}} {{relationships between}} nurses and patients {{need to have}} positive support. Different methods of providing patients with support include many active responses. Minor activities such as shopping, reading the newspaper together, or taking lunch/dinner breaks with patients can {{improve the quality of}} support provided. Physical support may also be used and is manifested through the use of touch. Patients described feelings of connection when the psychiatric nurses hugged them or <b>put</b> <b>a</b> <b>hand</b> <b>on</b> their shoulder. Psychiatric/mental health nurses in Berg and Hallberg's study described an element of a working relationship as comforting through holding a patient's hand. Patients with depression described relief when the psychiatric nurse embraced them. Physical touch is intended to comfort and console patients who are willing to embrace these sensations and share mutual feelings with the psychiatric nurses.|$|E

6000|$|... ‘Ay!’ {{returned}} Will, <b>putting</b> <b>a</b> <b>hand</b> <b>on</b> each of Trotty’s shoulders. ‘And like {{to prove}} a’most {{as good a}} friend, if that can be, as one I found.’ ...|$|R
60|$|JAYSON--[Starting {{to follow}} SHEFFIELD, hesitates and <b>puts</b> <b>a</b> <b>hand</b> <b>on</b> his son's shoulder.] Curt. Remember I'm your father. Can't you confide in me? I'll do {{anything}} to help.|$|R
60|$|Auchincloss {{stood up}} and, shaking himself {{as if to}} ward off his testy temper, he <b>put</b> <b>a</b> <b>hand</b> <b>on</b> Dale's arm.|$|E
60|$|She {{turned from}} me, and her mood changed swiftly. For she laughed lightly, musically, and <b>put</b> <b>a</b> <b>hand</b> <b>on</b> his shoulder.|$|E
6000|$|But Tarvrille {{restrained}} his forbidding arm, {{and then}} after a second's interval <b>put</b> <b>a</b> <b>hand</b> <b>on</b> my shoulder. [...] "Come," [...] he said....|$|E
6000|$|Slone went {{close to}} the King and, <b>putting</b> <b>a</b> <b>hand</b> <b>on</b> the pommel, {{he looked up at}} Lucy. [...] "Maybe--it is--a dream--an' you won't come back," [...] he said, with {{unsteady}} voice.|$|R
6000|$|Fan {{moved to}} her side. [...] "Dear Constance," [...] she said, <b>putting</b> <b>a</b> <b>hand</b> <b>on</b> the other's shoulder, [...] "it {{is better to}} cry than to be as you have been all these days." ...|$|R
60|$|Meanwhile Toby, <b>putting</b> <b>a</b> <b>hand</b> <b>on</b> each knee, {{bent down}} his {{nose to the}} basket, {{and took a long}} {{inspiration}} at the lid; the grin upon his withered face expanding in the process, as if he were inhaling laughing gas.|$|R
60|$|With a solemnity {{that touched}} Felix, John <b>put</b> <b>a</b> <b>hand</b> <b>on</b> {{each side of}} her face, raised it, and {{kissed her on the}} forehead.|$|E
60|$|A {{moment after}} the man made a heavy {{movement}} forward, as if to recover his tool; but the doctor <b>put</b> <b>a</b> <b>hand</b> <b>on</b> his arm.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well {{up in your}} studies?" [...] he asked, cordially. Then he seated himself, <b>put</b> <b>a</b> <b>hand</b> <b>on</b> each knee, and {{deliberately}} and curiously studied Ken.|$|E
6000|$|... "Thank you. Thank you. It's {{a weight}} off my mind," [...] says the trooper with a heave {{of his chest}} as he unfolds his arms and <b>puts</b> <b>a</b> <b>hand</b> <b>on</b> each leg, [...] "though I had set my heart on being scratched, too!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I didn't say nothing, sir, for I {{could make}} neither head nor tail {{of what he}} was saying, and, I dessay, looked as {{surprised}} as might be. Then he takes a step forward, and he <b>puts</b> <b>a</b> <b>hand</b> <b>on</b> my shoulder, and says he: ...|$|R
6000|$|But it was {{significant}} that {{he lowered his}} voice; {{went over to the}} door, too, to see if it were shut. Laurence had drawn his chair forward, huddling over the fire--a thin figure, a worn, high-cheekboned face with deep-sunk blue eyes, and wavy hair all ruffled, a face that still had <b>a</b> certain beauty. <b>Putting</b> <b>a</b> <b>hand</b> <b>on</b> that lean shoulder, Keith said: ...|$|R
60|$|He <b>put</b> <b>a</b> <b>hand</b> <b>on</b> {{either side}} of his head and rocked himself to and fro, droning to himself like a child whose grief has got beyond words.|$|E
60|$|Dick {{looked from}} me to Jim, and Jim slowly straitened his tall form. For a moment neither spoke. Dick's white face caused me to look away from him. Jim <b>put</b> <b>a</b> <b>hand</b> <b>on</b> my arm.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{just never}} {{can get by}} this place," [...] {{explained}} the rancher, as he came and stood {{so that he could}} <b>put</b> <b>a</b> <b>hand</b> <b>on</b> Dorn's knee. [...] "Look, son--an' Lenore, don't you miss this." ...|$|E
60|$|Daniel obeyed, and Sir Hugo <b>put</b> <b>a</b> gentle <b>hand</b> <b>on</b> his shoulder, {{looking at}} him affectionately.|$|R
5000|$|On several occasions, AG Rodriguez, has {{announced}} that [...] "whoever <b>puts</b> <b>a</b> <b>hand</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> woman, will feel {{the full weight of}} the law; without exceptions"; And urged the mainstream media to cooperate with their efforts [...] "so that this message reaches all the women of the country" [...] so they feel safe in denouncing acts of violence that are carried out against them.|$|R
60|$|Armand, {{unconscious}} of all save of Jeanne and of {{her immediate}} need, <b>put</b> <b>an</b> eager <b>hand</b> <b>on</b> Percy's arm.|$|R
60|$|The girl sat very insecurely, {{clinging}} fast. He <b>put</b> <b>a</b> <b>hand</b> <b>on</b> her waist, {{to support}} her. And {{he held her}} closely, he clasped her as in an embrace, he was weak with desire as he strode beside her.|$|E
6000|$|... "Now, Jessie, we {{will take}} you first. The stream runs strongly, and it were best that you went over separately. All {{you have to do}} is to <b>put</b> <b>a</b> <b>hand</b> <b>on</b> a {{shoulder}} of each of us. Come along." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Down, Mischief, down!" [...] said Spini, {{with sudden}} roughness. [...] "Malediction!" [...] he added, still more gruffly, pushing the dog aside; then, {{starting}} from his seat, he stood close to Tito, and <b>put</b> <b>a</b> <b>hand</b> <b>on</b> {{his shoulder as}} he spoke.|$|E
60|$|He {{repeated}} this, and as I {{was now in}} one of my subtle moods, I {{determined to}} dispute it. Possibly I wandered a little from the point. But Cavor certainly did not attend at all properly. He stood up as well as he could, <b>putting</b> <b>a</b> <b>hand</b> <b>on</b> my head to steady himself, which was disrespectful, and stood staring about him, quite devoid now of any fear of the moon beings.|$|R
60|$|Then Lassiter <b>put</b> <b>a</b> great <b>hand</b> <b>on</b> Venters's {{shoulder}} and wheeled {{him to meet}} a smoldering fire of gray eyes.|$|R
50|$|Although she {{is portrayed}} as nervous and always with {{a good reason to}} scream at someone, she is good-hearted. Shaft seems the only person able to calm her, simply by <b>putting</b> <b>a</b> <b>hand</b> <b>on</b> her, most times without even looking at her and while doing {{something}} else. Even if their relationship seems absurd, Shaft and Salomé are very faithful (in social terms) towards each other and their alliance saves the day on several occasions.|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] he said, [...] "do it! Do it, and {{see what}} happens. By God, if you <b>put</b> <b>a</b> <b>hand</b> <b>on</b> me, I'll finish you. Do {{you think you can}} bully me? Do you think I care for your size?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Dull; {{things will}} look up toward spring, they say. I get on well enough, but I miss you fellows dreadfully;" [...] and Ed <b>put</b> <b>a</b> <b>hand</b> <b>on</b> the broad {{shoulder}} of each friend, {{as if he}} longed to be a school-boy again.|$|E
6000|$|She laughed happily. [...] "It's {{only the}} next day. Just keep {{where you are}} till the sun gets a little higher." [...] She drew near and <b>put</b> <b>a</b> <b>hand</b> <b>on</b> his brow. [...] "You don't feel feverish. Oh, I hope this trip hasn't set you back." ...|$|E
60|$|At length, as I {{was looking}} out at the iron gate of Bartholomew Close into Little Britain, I saw Mr. Jaggers coming across the road towards me. All the others who were waiting saw him at the same time, and there was quite a rush at him. Mr. Jaggers, <b>putting</b> <b>a</b> <b>hand</b> <b>on</b> my {{shoulder}} and walking me on at his side without saying anything to me, addressed himself to his followers.|$|R
60|$|Again she <b>put</b> <b>a</b> gentle <b>hand</b> <b>on</b> {{his sleeve}} {{and left it}} there for a moment. The touch thrilled all through Kurt.|$|R
60|$|Quickly she <b>put</b> <b>a</b> {{restraining}} <b>hand</b> <b>on</b> his shoulder. <b>A</b> firm step had {{echoed in}} the flagged corridor beyond the oaken door.|$|R
