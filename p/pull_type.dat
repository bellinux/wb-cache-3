40|$|Presently, the {{majority}} of podded propulsion systems are of the <b>pulling</b> <b>type,</b> because this type provides better hydrodynamic efficiency than the pushing type. There are several possible explanations for the better overall performance of a <b>puller</b> <b>type</b> podded propulsor. One {{is related to the}} difference in hub shape. Puller and pusher propellers have opposite hub taper angles, hence different hub and blade root shape. These differences cause changes in the flow condition and possibly influence the overall performance. The current study focuses on the variation in performance of pusher and puller propellers with the same blade sections, but different hub taper angles. A hyperboloidal low order sourcedoublet steady/unsteady time domain panel method code was modified and used to evaluate effects of hub taper angle on the open water propulsive performance of some fixed pitch screw propellers used in podded propulsion systems. The modified code was first validated against measurements of two model propellers in terms of average propulsive performance and good agreement was found. Major findings include significant effects of hub taper angle on propulsive performance of tapered hub propellers and noticeable effects of hub taper angle on sectional pressure distributions of tapered hub propeller blades.

Particle shear stress is obtained for both pusher and <b>puller</b> <b>types</b> of swimmers. In the limit of low shear rate and magnetic field, the rheology only depends on the swimming activity and a scaling relation is derived {{as a function of}} the rotational and magnetic Peclet numbers. In this case, shear stress is an affine function of the shear rate and displays at low shear rate an "actuated" stress induced by the magnetic field that can be positive (brake state) or negative (motor state). The possibilities offered by such an active system to control the rheological response of a fluid are finally discussed. Comment: 5 pages, 3 figure...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. The {{problem of}} {{production}} control in serial manufacturing lines that {{consist of a}} number of unreliable machines linked with intermediate buffers is addressed. We make use of Reinforcement Learning methodologies in order to derive efficient control policies. Our aim is to derive control policies that are more state-dependent and therefore more efficient than well-known <b>pull</b> <b>type</b> control policies such as Kanban. Manufacturing systems of this type are studied under average measures such as average WorkInProcess inventories etc. and thus, a learning algorithm from the currently developing field of Average Reward Reinforcement Learning was applied. The Reinforcement Learning control policy was compared to three existing efficient <b>pull</b> <b>type</b> control policies, namely Kanban, Base Stock and CONWIP on the basis of simulated data and found to outperform them. The simulation experiments involved a single-product system with two machines that allows backordering. Numerical results are presented along with a qualitative interpretation of our findings.

40|$|Propulsion {{dynamics}} of a podded propulsor unit in steering motion at fixed azimuth angles were investigated numerically. Unsteady forces, torques and bending moments were predicted for a model podded propulsor unit at various azimuth angles. Analysis was performed for averaged forces and their fluctuations as well. A timedomain unsteady multi-body panel method code, PROPELLA, was further developed for this work. Predictions {{were compared with}} a set of time averaged inhouse experimental data for a <b>puller</b> <b>type</b> podded propulsor configuration in the first quadrant operation. Unsteady fluctuations of forces were predicted numerically. Analysis was made for the bending moment on propeller blades, shaft and the propulsor unit stock shaft for azimuth angles from 0 to 45 degrees. It indicates that the magnitude and fluctuation of the forces are significant and they are essential for structural strength and design optimization. The predicted bending moment and global forces on the propulsor unit provide some useful data for ship maneuvering motion and simulation at off design conditions.

40|$|We use the {{boundary}} element method {{to study the}} low-Reynolds number locomotion of a spherical model microorganism in a circular tube. The swimmer propels itself by tangen- tial or normal surface motion in a tube whose radius is {{on the order of}} the swimmer size. Hydrodynamic interactions with the tube walls significantly affect the average swimming speed and power consumption of the model microorganism. In the case of swimming parallel to the tube axis, the locomotion speed is always reduced (resp. increased) for swimmers with tangential (resp. normal) deformation. In all cases, the rate of work nec- essary for swimming is increased by confinement. Swimmers with no force-dipoles in the far field generally follow helical trajectories, solely induced by hydrodynamic interactions with the tube walls, and in qualitative agreement with recent experimental observations for Paramecium. Swimmers of the <b>puller</b> <b>type</b> always display stable locomotion at a lo- cation which depends on the strength of their force dipoles: swimmers with weak dipoles (small α) swim in the centre of the tube while those with strong dipoles (large α) swim near the walls. In contrast, pusher swimmers and those employing normal deformation are unstable and end up crashing into the walls of the tube. Similar dynamics is observed for swimming into a curved tube. These results could be relevant for the future design of artificial microswimmers in confined geometries. Comment: 32 pages, 23 figure...|$|R
