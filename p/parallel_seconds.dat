50|$|The symphony {{opens with}} a smooth sonata-allegro {{movement}} in A minor that gives {{the effect of a}} single flowing gesture. Both main themes are in 3/4 time, the first unfolding in the violins, the second passed around the woodwinds. In the recapitulation, the return of the first theme is delayed until {{the very end of the}} movement. The second movement is a scherzo, and is unusual in Piston's output both for harmonic novelty and an adventurous approach to orchestration. The percussion section is prominent throughout the movement, and the pizzicato muted strings playing in <b>parallel</b> <b>seconds</b> add another percussive layer, woven together with pianissimo scurrying chromatic lines. The third movement, Adagio sereno, is in five-part rondo form: ABABA. The A theme is first presented by the solo cello. The second time A occurs, this theme is embellished, and the final A powerfully recapitulates it in the full orchestra. The B theme is contrasting and more delicate. Near the end of the movement the solo cello returns to play the well-known BACH motif, B-A-C-B—the four notes which, in a different order, had begun the first movement. The finale is heavily scored but gives the illusion of lightness and transparency. It is a sectional form in A major, with well-defined, extroverted themes. The first and third movements, as well as the second and fourth, are paired through the use of mode (minor in the first and third, major in the second and fourth), motives (broadly lyrical vs. brightly syncopated), form, color, and mood, and a satisfying, balanced whole is achieved in this way, along with the key scheme of the four movements: A minor, D major, F minor, and A major.|$|E

40|$|For an {{arbitrary}} n-dimensional riemannian manifold N and an integer m between 1 and n- 1 a covariant derivative on the Graßmann bundle G_m(TN) is introduced {{which has the}} property that an m-dimensional submanifold M of N has <b>parallel</b> <b>second</b> fundamental form {{if and only if}} its Gauß map (defined on M with values in G_m(TN)) is affine. (For the case that N is the euclidian space this result was already obtained by J. Vilms in 1972.) By means of this relation a generalization of E. Cartan's theorem on the total geodesy of a geodesic umbrella can be derived: Suppose, initial data (p,W,b) prescribing an m-dimensional tangent space W and a second fundamental form b at p in N are given; for these data we construct an m-dimensional ``umbrella'' M=M(p,W,b) in N, the rays of which are helical arcs of N; moreover we present tensorial conditions (not involving the covariant derivative on G_m(TN)) which guarantee that the umbrella M has <b>parallel</b> <b>second</b> fundamental form.

40|$|Chlorine is broadly {{used for}} water {{disinfection}} {{at the final}} stage of water treatment because of its high performance to inactivate pathogenic microorganisms, its lower cost compared to other well-known disinfectants and its simple operational needs. However, reaction of chlorine {{with a wide range of}} organic and inorganic substances in water causes its decay and formation of chlorinated by-products, which are in some cases carcinogenic and harmful to human health. The major challenge is balancing the risk from these with the cost of operation needed to mitigate the impact. These challenges highlights the importance of having a robust modelling approach for chlorine decay in bulk water as a pre-required step to model the chlorine decay and formation of its by-products in the whole distribution system. In this study, initially, a comprehensive literature review was conducted to investigate and evaluate all existing modelling approaches for chlorine decay prediction especially in bulk water. Among all existing modelling schemes, three models were paid more attention due to their popularity and/or fundamentally valid background. They are first order model, second order model and <b>parallel</b> <b>second</b> order model. During the literature review, comparing the effectiveness of the second order model (SOM) proposed by Clark (1998) with the <b>parallel</b> <b>second</b> order model (PSOM) offered by Kastl et al., (1999), the author found that these two models are both fundamentally sound, although the PSOM had better capability in terms of data fitting, and representing the chlorine decay behaviour is much better than SOM. However, non-existence of analytical solution for PSOM was found to be the major negative point for wide adaptation of PSOM compared to SOM. Trying to understand the basic principles of both models, it was understood that the formulation of SOM was genuine and the researchers who claimed that Clark (1998) made a mistake in deriving the analytical solution were proved wrong. This resulted in having the first publication as a comment in Water Research (Fisher et al., 2010 b; Appendix A 3). Further study was performed on how SOM was formulated and attempts were made to apply the same methodology to PSOM in order to arrive at an analytical solution. Consequently, making a reasonable assumption, an analytical solution for the <b>parallel</b> <b>second</b> order model was formulated and evaluated against the existing numerical method. As the case study of this research, initially, the previous chlorine decay data from Pilbara Water Treatment Plant was fitted to a first order reaction scheme and it was proved that the data did not comply with it. This was an expected result and the need for other model was validated. For further analysis, fresh water samples were collected from Pilbara Water Treatment Plant to perform chlorine decay tests. Temperature effect on the behaviour of chlorine decay in the bulk water was investigated by integrating Arrhenius equation with PSOM. Three methods of temperature analysis were compared and the best one was recommended for practical application. It was shown that the model was capable enough to properly display the chlorine decay profile when temperature varies. The thesis consists of eight chapters. In chapter 1, a brief description of the research background and the overall objectives of the research are given. Chapter 2 focuses on providing a comprehensive literature review about all involved aspects as well as chlorine decay modelling background. Chapter 3 discusses the methodology and analytical methods for conducting laboratory experiments. Chapter 4 gives a prove that the first order decay model does not show accurate results for chlorine decay prediction and the <b>parallel</b> <b>second</b> order model is much more accurate in predicting chlorine concentration. In Chapter 5, the main part of this research, an analytical solution for the <b>parallel</b> <b>second</b> order model is developed. Chapter 6 evaluates the effectiveness of the <b>parallel</b> <b>second</b> order model against the first and second order model. Within chapter 7, temperature effect on the chlorine decay behaviour and the selected modelling approach is evaluated and chapter 8 gives a brief conclusion and recommendation...|$|R
