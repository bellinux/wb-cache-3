Mobile Telephone Network South Africa (MTN SA) needs to launch new products and services consistently to stay on the competitive edge. Consequently, effective <b>project</b> <b>management</b> becomes the key to gaining the competitive advantage by turning new product or service concepts into reality. According to Nokes and Kelly (2007 : 153 – 156), there is a high correlation between project success and effective <b>project</b> scope <b>management.</b> The effectiveness of <b>project</b> scope <b>management</b> can drastically affect the success of projects, as changes to the project scope may severely affect the project value creation, timeline, quality and cost. Accordingly, high <b>project</b> scope <b>management</b> maturity would contribute tremendously to the effectiveness of <b>project</b> <b>management.</b> The <b>purpose</b> of this present research is to define a roadmap to guide MTN’s Business Optimisation (BO) department to <b>project</b> scope <b>management</b> excellence. To meet this aim, the researcher utilises the concept of a <b>Project</b> <b>Management</b> Maturity Model (PMMM), as a guideline {{for the creation of a}} <b>project</b> scope <b>management</b> maturity model. The created <b>project</b> scope <b>management</b> maturity model is then utilised to provide an effective means to measure MTN SA’s <b>project</b> scope <b>management</b> maturity and identify the gaps prohibiting MTN SA from project scope excellence (Kerzner, 2004 : 193).

Therefore document management will remain a crucial part of the overall <b>project</b> <b>management.</b> Based on the fact that in the frames of practical projects traditional documents will coexist together with model-based building information the existing technological separation between those different worlds of information is counterproductive and out-of-time since it may cause information losses, inconsistent information resources and hinders an adequate and project wide adoption of BIM technologies. The aim of this work is to develop a practical method that allows for the use of IFC building information models within a database-driven <b>project</b> <b>management</b> environment to make model-based building information available for <b>project</b> and document <b>management</b> <b>purposes.</b> The proposed method will establish an integrated overall project information resource constituted by a persistent linkage between elements of the building model and the associated documents...|$|R
40|$|Nowadays, due to globalization, {{business}} diversification and {{a growing}} number of different business projects, the need to support people involved in tasks related to <b>project</b> <b>management</b> is becoming increasingly important. Timely and accurate data about projects’ plans, their progress and related costs, are extremely important for project managers and consequently for assuring the success of the project. In this context, <b>Project</b> <b>Management</b> Information Systems (PMIS) are commonly viewed as an important tool for <b>project</b> <b>management.</b> However, this kind of Information Systems (IS) is relatively expensive and therefore out of reach for many small and medium enterprises (SME) that often choose not to use them.

40|$|The {{government}} of Abu Dhabi {{made a decision}} to change the focus of the government from executer of the project to manager of projects in 2008. More and more work was sub-contracted and government departments just project managed the operations. Due to this change in focus the demand for project managers increased. Most of these project managers were not specially trained or educated in <b>project</b> <b>management</b> competencies. They primarily were employees from older operations who were reassigned for <b>project</b> <b>management</b> <b>purposes.</b> What has been realised now is {{that it is important to}} have a look at the competencies of these employees and make sure they are suitable to be project managers. In addition to them being suitable for <b>project</b> <b>management</b> positions, it is also important that there is a specific progression path and well defined expectations to be promoted to the next level. Therefore, there is a need to clearly identify the career path of a project manager from the inception of their careers until they retire. The path has to have identifiable objective points which could be used to decide if the project manager is ready to move to the next level. A framework is needed that can facilitate the progression of a project manager in their career paths in the Abu Dhabi government departments; and therefore, is the main aim of this thesis. In order to accomplish the aim, a mixed methods approach was taken. The Use of initial interviews established the context for Abu Dhabi. Use of statistical techniques such as multiple regression and mathematical technique of DEMATEL helped identify the career path from an entry level project coordinator position to a programme director position through the end of the career. The major findings of this research in addition to the development of the framework are: 1) the career path of a project manager is quite linear; 2) it is not an add-on role but a career in itself; 3) At the entry level of a project an individual should have high level of behavioural competencies; 4) There is a relationship between project success criteria and programme success factors; Since project success leads to programme success, this relationship could be used to establish the transition between a project manager and a programme manager’s role. 5) The technical and contextual competencies of a project manager should be used to promote them during their time as project managers; and 7) Within the programme management there are some competencies that can be regarded as the cause group of competencies and others that could be regarded as the effect group of competencies. There are several major implications of this work. First of all, the framework developed will act as a good starting point for all the government departments to establish their own <b>project</b> <b>management</b> progression framework which could be modified with their own discipline specific information. This research also establishes the importance of behavioural competencies for <b>project</b> <b>management</b> at the outset of the career itself. The framework also provides an objective way of assessing when an individual is ready to move to the next level of responsibilities within the organisation.

40|$|Software {{engineering}} is criticized {{as not being}} engineering or 'well-developed' science at all. Software engineers seem not to know exactly how long their projects will last, what they will cost, and will the software work properly after release. Measurements {{have to be taken}} in software projects to improve this situation. It is of limited use to only collect metrics afterwards. The values of the relevant metrics have to be predicted, too. The predictions (i. e. estimates) form the basis for proper <b>project</b> <b>management.</b> One of the most painful problems in software projects is effort estimation. It has a clear and central effect on other project attributes like cost and schedule, and to product attributes like size and quality. Effort estimation can be used for several purposes. In this thesis only the effort estimation in software <b>projects</b> for <b>project</b> <b>management</b> <b>purposes</b> is discussed. There is a short introduction to the measurement issues, and some metrics relevantin estimation context are presented. Effort estimation methods are covered quite broadly. The main new contribution in this thesis is the new estimation model that has been created. It takes use of the basic concepts of Function Point Analysis, but avoids the problems and pitfalls found in the method. It is relativelyeasy to use and learn. Effort estimation accuracy has significantly improved after taking this model into use. A major innovation related to the new estimationmodel is the identified need for hierarchical software size measurement. The author of this thesis has developed a three level solution for the estimation model. All currently used size metrics are static in nature, but this new proposed metric is dynamic. It takes use of the increased {{understanding of the nature of}} the work as specification and design work proceeds. It thus 'grows up' along with software projects. The effort estimation model development is not possible without gathering and analyzing history data. However, there are many problems with data in software engineering. A major roadblock is the amount and quality of data available. This thesis shows some useful techniques that have been successful in gathering and analyzing the data needed. An estimation process is needed to ensure that methods are used in a proper way, estimates are stored, reported and analyzed properly, and they are used for <b>project</b> <b>management</b> activities. A higher mechanism called measurement framework is also introduced shortly. The purpose of the framework is to define and maintain a measurement or estimationprocess. Without a proper framework, the estimation capability of an organization declines. It requires effort even to maintain an achieved level of estimationaccuracy. Estimation results in several successive releases are analyzed. It isclearly seen that the new estimation model works and the estimation improvementactions have been successful. The calibration of the hierarchical model is a critical activity. An example is shown to shed more light on the calibration and the model itself. There are also remarks about the sensitivity of the model. Finally, an example of usage is shown...|$|R

The choice of interest rates in <b>project</b> <b>management</b> is the <b>purpose</b> of the thesis. The rate of interest should be adopted as discount rate in project evaluation. Because, the rate of interest reflects time preference and the opportunity cost of the possible alternative use of the capital invested. The interest rate {{is assumed to be}} constant during the project life in project evaluation techniques. In order to overcome this inability the constant rate should be replaced by time varying interest rates. iv Several forecast models aid <b>project</b> <b>management</b> to predict the valid interest rates in the evaluation. The thesis employs the expected-change forecast model to obtain interest rates for each year during the life cycle. An application of the model to one of the large-scale projects in the Armed Forces, namely modern self-propelled direct support artillery gun- SP 2000, is presented in the thesis. Comparison of two alternative uses of interest rates in the calculation of net present value of the project is discussed. It is concluded that the constant interest rate use overstates the costs and it is suggested that the time varying interest rates should be adopted as the optimal discount rates in <b>project</b> <b>management.</b> Topçu, Mustafa KemalM.

40|$|The aim of {{the thesis}} is to find {{efficient}} ways of using SharePoint server in the organization and to study in detail the use of workflows for <b>project</b> <b>management.</b> For this <b>purpose,</b> {{we set up a}} SharePoint server, which serves as a test environment, and design a workflow. SharePoint Server uses concept of workflow for <b>project</b> <b>management.</b> Workflows can consistently manage common business processes within an organization. Workflow can be described as a series of tasks, which gives the result. Workflow assigns tasks to the person, that participate in the project. Person has to finish the tasks to continue the project. This enable persons, who perform these tasks, to concentrate on performing the work rather than managing the workflow. The first part of the thesis presents the SharePoint server and its set up. It describes the mechanisms, that the server uses to organize content, and features to connect SharePoint server to the external databases. The second part of the thesis is dedicated to present and study the workflows. It describes the development of workflow, which is developed within the thesis. With use of concrete example, based on business process of order, we studied the usefulness of the workflows in <b>project</b> <b>management.</b> The description focuses on the different states, through which a process of order make progress, and describe effectivness of assigning tasks to the project participants. Designed workflow was presented in Uprava Republike Slovenije za javna plačila. According to this presentation, we analyzed the usefulness of the workflows in this business environment. The final chapter describes the conclusion of research about usefullness of SharePoint server in organization and efficiency of workflow in <b>project</b> <b>management...</b>|$|R
