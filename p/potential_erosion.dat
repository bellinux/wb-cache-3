The condition of road elements especially those related to factors stated in the Universal Soil Loss Equation were recorded and, based on this information, the category of specific roads in <b>erosion</b> <b>potentials</b> was decided subjectively to either one of very small, small, medium, rather large, and large. From the results, the following conclusions may be withdrawn:In general, <b>erosion</b> <b>potentials</b> of forest roads is decreased with time due to the growth of various vegetation and the process of natural soil stabilization. For continually used main roads, <b>erosion</b> <b>potentials</b> after about 2 years are still rather large to large; after 3 - 6 years are medium; and beyond 6 yers are very small to small. If main roads are totally abandoned, <b>erosion</b> <b>potentials</b> after left around one year are rather large; after 2 - 3 years are small to medium; and beyond 3 years are very small. For branch roads, <b>erosion</b> <b>potentials</b> for those abandoned up to one year are rather large to large; abandoned 2 - 3 years are medium to rather large; beyond 3 years are very small to small. For skidding roads that constructed by clearing vegetation only or vegetation, litter and top soils all together, when abandoned one year or more, they were densely couered by vegetation and for litter and, therefore, their <b>erosion</b> <b>potentials</b> are very small to small. <b>Erosion</b> <b>potential</b> tendency for skidding roads constructed by soil cutting and filling is almost the same as that in branch roads.

The purpose of this project {{was to develop a}} tool based on a simple model, limited amount of data and geographic information system (GIS) to identify areas with risk for phosphorus losses due to surface runoff. This tool can act as a decision support to decide where appropriate measures should be applied with the aim of reducing phosphorus losses and by that the eutrophication. The method that has been used is a combination of two models, one calculating the <b>potential</b> <b>erosion</b> while the other one identifies areas of erosion (net erosion) or deposition. This ability is of great importance because <b>potential</b> <b>erosion</b> should be calculated on areas with net erosion. Areas with high <b>potential</b> <b>erosion</b> have an increased risk for phosphorus losses due to surface runoff. The <b>potential</b> <b>erosion</b> was calculated based on factors which describe how topography (LS), land use (C), soil type (K) and precipitation (R) effect the erosion. All of them have been modified {{to a greater or lesser}} extent. The LS-factor was improved with a modified equation to adapt the calculation for a complex terrain. The C- and K-factor were adapted to Swedish conditions by using the same classification as a similar Swedish method. A Finnish survey was used to adapt the R-factor to the local climate.
