J’ai aperçu à côté de moi un trou par lequel je suis sorti sans savoir comment, et je suis tombé sur une flaque d’eau sablonneuse. J’ai pu alors contempler les flammes de l’avion qui consumait. Il ne s’agissait pas d’un poids exagéré. C’est une simple défaillance mécanique.This translates loosely to the following:We {{had taken}} off after taxiing for three minutes. At once, I noted that the plane started to pitch. The effort of the pilot to right the plane remained vain. At {{this point in time}} the stewardess told me to <b>put</b> <b>on</b> <b>my</b> seat belt. At that time, the plane started to fly low and it struck a palm tree and lost a wing.|$|E

So I started to write about that and it turned into the Hockey Sweater story." ...|$|E

We were both on two {{different}} keyboards, two different drum machines and once again just got behind the mic and the rest is history." [...] Lyrics include lines like, [...] "But it's the last time, I'm movin' on / I'm throwing on my Louboutins." [...] Lopez described the idea behind the song as [...] "that point in a bad relationship and you're like, 'Damn, I really have to leave. It's just not good for me,' ... It's not the girl who's like, 'I'm gonna take my stuff, and I'm gonna <b>put</b> <b>on</b> <b>my</b> sweatpants, and I'm gonna cry,'... This girl is like putting on her hottest dress and her sexiest Louboutin shoes, and leaving your ass". In the chorus Lopez singles [...] "I'm throwing on my Louboutins" [...] eight times and overall the word [...] "Louboutins" [...] is spoken thirty-two times across the song.

500|$|The {{music video}} was {{directed}} by Justin Francis, and co-directed by Nick Cannon {{on the island of}} Eleuthera in the Bahamas. The video became notable for the pair, {{due to the fact that}} it was during its conception and recording that they began dating, and eventually wed two months later. The video was shot in early April 2008, but was delayed until May, with several critics suggesting it because of the couples engagement. In an interview with Fox News, Cannon spoke of his feelings when first speaking with Carey regarding the video:"From the first time we sat down to discuss the video at the Beverly Hills Hotel, we connected. We had so much in common spiritually, and we laugh at the same things. I didn't have to <b>put</b> <b>on</b> <b>my</b> Mac Daddy suave mode. I was able to be myself with her. We are both eternally 12 years old." [...] The pair eloped in the Bahamas, at Carey's private estate in Eleuthera, and wed on April 30, 2008. The couple stayed on the island for over two weeks after the nuptials for their honeymoon, which is why the video was delayed until mid-May, so Carey would be able to promote it in time.|$|E
500|$|... "Wake Me Up" [...] was {{eventually}} released as {{the fourth and}} final single from the album on 21 February 2005. The first verse was recorded {{on the last day}} of sessions for What Will the Neighbours Say?.

2500|$|You know, {{its engine}} sound was {{different}} from other planes; that is, the president's engine's sound ...

[...] She said she reread some of her journals {{from high school to}} get [...] "into that place" [...] as a high school student again, and that Peyton being similar to how she was in high school helped. [...] "It also helped that the town where we film, Wilmington, isn’t too different from the hometown where I grew up in Virginia.

2500|$|Chase J. Nielsen, {{one of the}} U.S. airmen {{who flew}} in the Doolittle raid {{following}} the attack on Pearl Harbor, was subjected to waterboarding by his Japanese captors. At their trial for war crimes following the war, he testified [...] "Well, I was <b>put</b> <b>on</b> <b>my</b> back {{on the floor with}} my arms and legs stretched out, one guard holding each limb. The towel was wrapped around my face and put across my face and water poured on. They poured water on this towel until I was almost unconscious from strangulation, then they would let up until I'd get my breath, then they'd start over again... I felt more or less like I was drowning, just gasping between life and death." [...] In 2007, Senator John McCain claimed that the United States military hanged Japanese soldiers for waterboarding American prisoners of war during World War II. A minimal sentence for Japanese soldiers convicted of waterboarding American soldiers was 15 years.|$|E

2500|$|With {{the end of}} the Thirty Years' War, the fashions of the 1650s {{and early}} 1660s imitated the new {{peaceful}} and more relaxed feeling in Europe. The military boots gave way to shoes, and a mania for baggy breeches, short coats, and hundreds of yards of ribbon set the style. The breeches (see Petticoat breeches) became so baggy that Samuel Pepys wrote in his diary: [...] "And among other things, met with Mr. Townsend, who told of his mistake the other day to put both his legs through one of his Knees of his breeches, and so went all day." [...] (April 1661) The wide breeches that made such an error possible were soon being gathered at the knee: Pepys noted, 19 April 1663 [...] "this day <b>put</b> <b>on</b> <b>my</b> close-kneed coloured suit, which, with new stockings of the colour, with belt, and new gilt-handled sword, is very handsome." [...] This era was also one of great variation and transition.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the initial}} {{concept of the}} series, the three females' boss would be a millionaire who often aided them in their assignments; however, Jackson and Spelling {{decided it would be}} more {{interesting}} to have the boss's identity remain a secret. With this, millionaire Charlie Townsend was an unseen character on the series who only spoke to the Angels via a Western Electric Speakerphone. John Forsythe, who played the unseen Charlie Townsend, directing the 'Angels' crime-fighting operations over a speaker-phone, recorded his lines in an audio studio and was never on set. Thus, Forsythe rarely met any of his female co-stars. Some years later, he bumped into Farrah Fawcett-Majors at the tennis courts, as he recalled, [...] "I was coming off the court when she {{came up to me and}} said, 'Charlie! I finally met Charlie!'". Forsythe was offered the 'Charlie' role in a panicky late-night phone call from producer Aaron Spelling after the original choice, American film, stage and television actor, Gig Young, showed up too intoxicated to read his lines. [...] "I didn't even take my pajamas off – I just <b>put</b> <b>on</b> <b>my</b> topcoat and drove over to Fox. When it was finished, Aaron Spelling said, 'That's perfect.' And I went home and went back to bed".|$|E
2500|$|Washington {{then gave}} a short but impassioned speech, {{now known as}} the , {{counseling}} patience. [...] His message was that they should oppose anyone [...] "who wickedly attempts to open the floodgates of civil discord and deluge our rising empire in blood." [...] He then produced a letter from a member of Congress to read to the officers. [...] He gazed upon it and fumbled with it without speaking. He then took a pair of reading glasses from his pocket, which were new; few of the men had seen him wear them. He then said: [...] "Gentlemen, you will permit me to <b>put</b> <b>on</b> <b>my</b> spectacles, for I have not only grown gray but almost blind in the service of my country." [...] This caused the men to realize that Washington had sacrificed a great deal for the Revolution, just as much as any of them. These, of course, were his fellow officers, most having worked closely with him for several years. [...] Many of those present were moved to tears, and with this act, the conspiracy collapsed as he read the letter. [...] He then left the room, and General Knox and others offered resolutions reaffirming their loyalty. [...] Knox and Colonel Brooks were then appointed to a committee to draft a suitable resolution. [...] Approved by virtually the entire assembly, the resolution expressed [...] "unshaken confidence" [...] in Congress, and [...] "disdain" [...] and [...] "abhorrence" [...] for the irregular proposals published earlier in the week. Historian Richard Kohn believes the entire meeting was carefully stage-managed by Washington, Knox, and their supporters. [...] The only voice raised in opposition was that of Colonel Timothy Pickering, who criticized members of the assembly for hypocritically condemning the anonymous addresses that only days before they had been praising.|$|E
