60|$|The ladies, in {{consideration}} that I {{had never before}} intruded my performances on them, by any but the legitimate medium, through the <b>press,</b> <b>consented</b> to hear me read. I made them sit down on a moss-grown rock, close by the spot where we chose {{to believe that the}} death tree had stood. After a little hesitation on my part, caused by a dread of renewing my acquaintance with fantasies that had lost their charm in the ceaseless flux of mind, I began the tale, which opened darkly with the discovery of a murder.|$|R

60|$|Della Rovere {{was quite}} {{justified}} in finding {{it easier to}} believe that Carlotta was acting upon instructions from others, for, when hard <b>pressed</b> to <b>consent</b> to the alliance, she demanded that the Neapolitan ambassador should himself say that her father desired her to do so--a statement which, it seems, the ambassador could {{not bring himself to}} make.|$|R
50|$|When Dr. Mary Edwards Walker, a Union Army surgeon, {{heard this}} report she argued Hook {{should be made}} a {{lieutenant}} in the Union Army, but was ignored. Because Dr. Walker was thrilled about the news of a female soldier, she notified the <b>press.</b> Hook <b>consented</b> to interviews, but refused to give her real name. She promised newspaper reporters that she would go home, though many doubted her.|$|R
60|$|Presently the King appeared, and {{the parrot}} noticed with joy {{how much he}} was disliked. As soon as the King left, the Princess retired to her dressing-room, the parrot flew after her and overheard her lamentations at the {{continued}} persecutions of the King, who had <b>pressed</b> her to <b>consent</b> to their marriage. The parrot said so many clever and tender things to comfort her that she began to doubt whether this could indeed be her own parrot.|$|R

He told her how important such an alliance would be, and <b>pressed</b> her to <b>consent.</b> In fact, he pressed her so persistingly that the princess at length lost her temper and quite forgot the respect due to her father. [...] "Sire," [...] cried she angrily, [...] "do not speak further of {{this or any other}} marriage or I will plunge this dagger in my breast and so escape from all these importunities." ...|$|R

50|$|The film {{starts with}} a {{proposal}} of remaking Satyajit Ray's famous Nayak by a debutant director and storywriter Shuvobrata (Indraneil Sengupta) to famous Bengali actor Arun Chatterjee (Prosenjit). Arun approves Shuvobrata's proposal and agrees to finance the project. Shuvobrata requests his live-in girlfriend Srinandita or Shrin (Nandana Sen) to act opposite Arun. In the meantime, Arun and Shrin become close friends and Arun tells her about various incident from his past in an emotionally triggered condition. The exchange is videotaped accidentally and Shuvobrata on discovering it leaks it to the <b>press,</b> without Srinandita's <b>consent,</b> as a publicity stunt for the film. Srinandita leaves Shuvobrata on learning of this indiscretion. Arun, furious about the leak, bars the film from being released. Arun later learns that Shrin had {{no role in the}} leak and apologizes to her. The movie ends with Shrin leaving a note and a phone number for Arun at a roadside dhaba where they had met earlier.|$|R
60|$|Ten {{minutes before}} this time Ethelberta had been frankly and earnestly asked by Lord Mountclere {{to become his}} bride; not only so, but he <b>pressed</b> her to <b>consent</b> to have the {{ceremony}} performed before they returned to England. Ethelberta had unquestionably been much surprised; and, barring {{the fact that the}} viscount was somewhat ancient in comparison with herself, the temptation to close with his offer was strong, and would have been felt as such by any woman in the position of Ethelberta, now a little reckless by stress of circumstances, and tinged with a bitterness of spirit against herself and the world generally. But she was experienced enough to know what heaviness might result from a hasty marriage, entered into with a mind full of concealments and suppressions which, if told, were likely to stop the marriage altogether; and after trying to bring herself to speak of her family and situation to Lord Mountclere as he stood, a certain caution triumphed, and she concluded {{that it would be better}} to postpone her reply till she could consider which of two courses it would be advisable to adopt; to write and explain to him, or to explain nothing and refuse him. The third course, to explain nothing and hasten the wedding, she rejected without hesitation. With a pervading sense of her own obligations in forming this compact it did not occur to her to ask if Lord Mountclere might not have duties of explanation equally with herself, though bearing rather on the moral than the social aspects of the case.|$|R
50|$|Under Generals Rodolfo Graziani and Pietro Badoglio, {{the invading}} forces {{steadily}} pushed back the ill-armed and poorly trained Ethiopian army, winning {{a major victory}} near Lake Ascianghi (Ashangi) on April 9, 1936, and taking the capital, Addis Ababa, on May 5. Italian operations included the use of hundreds of tons of mustard gas, banned previously by the Geneva Convention. The nation's leader, Emperor Haile Selassie, went into exile. In Rome, Mussolini proclaimed Italy's king Victor Emmanuel III emperor of Ethiopia and appointed Badoglio to rule as viceroy. In response to Ethiopian appeals, the League of Nations had condemned the Italian invasion in 1935 and voted to impose economic sanctions on the aggressor. The sanctions remained ineffective because of general lack of support, and because they excluded key war-making material- iron, coal, steel and most critically, oil. Strangely, aluminum, a metal that Italy had in plenty, and even exported, was {{on the list of}} sanctions that supposedly punished Italy. Although Mussolini's aggression was viewed with disfavour by the British, who had a stake in East Africa, the other major powers had no real interest in opposing him. One historian notes that Britain could have starved the Italian war machine to a halt simply by closing the Suez Canal to the Duce, but while issuing public statements condemning Italy, Britain took no real action. Indeed, senior British and French officials hatched the cynical Hoare-Laval pact to carve up the country- handing three-fifths of Ethiopia to the Italians without Ethiopia's <b>consent.</b> <b>Press</b> leaks created public outrage that canceled the deal. Less than a year after the Italian invasion, the League voted to remove sanctions against Italy. The war ultimately gave substance to Italian imperialist claims, and contributed to international tensions between the fascist states and the Western democracies. It also sounded the death knell of the League of Nations as a credible institution according to some historians. These outcomes were to eventually culminate in World War II.|$|R
