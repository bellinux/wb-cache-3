The right does not pre-empt reasonable procedural rules. Thus, the right does not prevent the <b>preclusion</b> of defense witnesses as a discovery sanction.|$|E

40|$|Anhomomorphic {{logic is}} a new {{interpretation}} of Quantum Theory (due to R. Sorkin). It is a histories formulation (c. f. consistent histories, quantum measure theory).

40|$|The jurisprudential and doctrinal {{tradition}} of Italian administrative law emblematically conceives the ex officio annulment and validation as impressed by an all-encompassing {{consideration of the}} illegitimacy of the particular provision more than the public interest in deciding whether “to withdraw or to cure”.

The reflections in this article stem from his 1958 analysis on Income distribution and capital accumulation, {{in the form of}} a stylized interpretation of Andreatta’s thought as a political economist. In this light, his theoretical analyses are reinterpreted with particular attention to the effects of innovation on income distribution and prices in relation to different types of markets. In his 1958 monograph Andreatta fleshes out one of his theoretical approaches which he uses to elaborate and publish various writings, some are are discussed herein, with a focus on three main themes. The first theme regards how the choice of methods and the related intersectoral aspects of technology adopted in one sector influence the development of other sectors. The second theme, planning, is viewed especially in relation to developing countries. The third theme concerns that of the economics of research aimed at identifying new development strategies.

30|$|Playing (both playing {{instruments}} and playing more generally), {{listening to music}} and dancing are {{perhaps some of the}} activities where rhythm matters most immediately and compellingly at the bodily level. Also, these activities are intimately connected among themselves. In his late 1880 s tracts against Wagner, for instance, Nietzsche protested against Wagnerian music on the ground that the latter inhibits the natural, inborn tendency of the listener towards movement and dance. Wagner represents a perversion in the history of music in that his ‘theatrical’ approach has engendered ‘the complete degeneration of rhythmic feeling, chaos in place of rhythm’ (Nietzsche 1888, §I: 666)—arrhythmic swimming and floating in sound instead of healthy rhythmic walking and dancing. In those same years, a similar, intimate association between music and bodily movement was also established by the American child psychologist Bolton (1894). 5 If, {{in the late nineteenth century}} rhythm is saluted as natural, in the 1920 s the dancer and aesthete Rudolf Laban (renown mainly for his ‘Labanotation’, the standard notation system for recording human dancing movements) made the point that rhythm is, in fact, an attainment that requires special training: rhythms must be produced. For Laban, there are no a priori <b>preclusions</b> as to what can be made rhythmic. Indeed, there is always the possibility of capturing even dissonant events and ‘eu-rhythmise’ them. 6 Such is the mission of art and, more specifically, the mission of choreutics understood as Festkunst, celebrative art: ‘The art of celebration is meant to connect to the all-encompassing rhythm in its complete and infinite variability through dance. Essentially, the Festival knows no kakorhythmy’ (Laban 1921). Almost contemporary with Laban—and, like him, a former student from Conservatoire de Musique de Genève—Émile Jaques-Dalcroze developed the pedagogical tool of Eurythmics. He taught that rhythm is not an external measure to be followed passively, but rather something to be felt and experienced through one’s own body. In order to become eurhythmic, he contended, one needs to move until one feels the rhythm from within rather than just reproduce something imprinted from the outside (Jaques-Dalcroze 1921, especially § 4).|$|R

This work is a research about Estonian Internet users, their behaviour, attitude and skills when looking and receiving information from the Internet. While the Internet is becoming a more important information source with every day, this research {{is looking at the}} Estonians’ attitude towards the Internet. This work is important because it is the first Internet-thematic research in Estonia based on qualitative interviews. This survey was realized by 4 -membered group in composition of Marko Paloveer, Piret Reiljan, Urmas Rosenbeg and Kristiina Tagel. There were 16 interviews carried out, nine with male subjects and seven with females. Our survey is based on another research called „Mina. Maailm. Meedia“ which took place in year 2002. There were six Internet user types found {{as a result of this}} survey. They were versatile, interactive user; multiple information user; communicator; private-life-centred services user; participator; small-scale user. Present work consists of the review of theoretical and empirical bases of information theories, digital divide and digital inequality; the description on research-method; presentation of the respondents; description of the results of empirical survey and discussion of the main implications. There were some main empirical results. 1. People look for information mainly using the search engines, the most popular ones are Neti and Google. 2. Almost all respondents use the Internet at least once a day. 3. The most popular topics looked for were news, travelling and health information. The Internet is also considered helpful when looking for a job. 4. Two thirds of the respondents consider the Internet as a very important information source. 5. The main <b>preclusions</b> when aquiring information from the Internet were a scarce command of language and lack of specific materials. 6. Most of the respondents do not trust information with unknown background, for example information from newspaper comments or forums. They only trust certain web pages. For instance newspapers itself, bank pages and the home page of Departement of the Treasury. When looking at all the theoretical and empirical data, it is important to remember that they are not absolutely pertain to anybody. The purpose of this work was to go deep with Internet users’ thoughts and attitudes and the results are not meant to be carried over to all the Internet users. This work certainly gives various ideas to continue the survey. For example one possible expansion is to concentrate on only one Internet user type found as a result of the survey „Mina. Maailm.

40|$|The Grotesque Menagerie is an {{exploration}} of domestic and gender roles of the American West. The burlesque and the grotesque are used as the dissection tools throughout this manuscript to examine these roles, {{and in so doing}} pervert both the ideal and the abject. As the author, these poetic explorations and dissections leave me stuck in an odd androgyny: I am suspect of my own feminist <b>preclusions</b> and oddly obliged to interact with the established patriarchal tropes of the western poetic cannon. I do not reject the canon as a symbol of patriarchal power; I do not request the role of woman to be forefront; I am, at once, transfixed and emasculated. This androgyny is mirrored by the main character, a carnival barker or master of ceremonies, Whispering Ted. Ted is a female hysteric: at once attempting to embrace and subvert gender roles while being haunted by the perversion of the domestic ideal. Hysteric in Freudian terms, or as Mary Russo explains in her text The Female Grotesque: Risk, Excess, Modernity, Ted is “ungrounded and out of bounds, enacting her pantomime of anguish and rebellion” (Russo, 9). However, as the Burlesque degrades from the intention of woman as gender equal to woman as sexual object, as the intellectual attempts of this manuscript begin to unravel under the perceived and demanded audience gaze, so too does Ted unravel, both physically and emotionally. Ted embodies the voice of the author struggling to maintain both feminine and masculine roles, enacting the tearing discrepancies between forces. The Grotesque Menagerie is grotesque in three critical understandings of the term. The term grotesque was an exceedingly fortunate misnomer of sculptures and paintings uncovered in apertures during the excavation of Nero’s Domus Aurea. Grotto-esque, cave-like, earthy, dark, visceral: all traditional, if not Freudian, images and symbols for womanhood. Though I would not claim the Menagerie overtly feminist, the exploration of female sexuality inherent in the exploration of the domestic is unavoidable; the archetypes of cavernous female will surface because I cannot completely subvert the history of my language or poetics. However, post-Romantic grotesque is tied to the Freudian understanding of the unheimlich: the uncanny. From the German heimlich meaning the familiar, the home, we would consider the unheimlich as the opposite: the terrifying and horrifying elements of gothic or horror narratives. However, unheimlich implies heimlich and therefore the disorienting coupling of unfamiliar within the familiar. The Menagerie embraces these further implications of the uncanny, the unknown darkness implicit in home and domesticity. Simultaneously, and somehow not venturing far from the uncanny understanding, the third grotesque is tied to that which is outrageous: comedy, hilarity, and Camp. Both the uncanny (gothic) and humorous (carnival) grotesques are based in the abjection of identity and body brought to a point of spectacle, which both undermines and reinforces the existing social structure. As the poet Lara Glenum explains in her text Notes on Women 2 ̆ 6 the Grotesque, the grotesque is: “[A] hybrid body, its capacity at once monstrous and dizzyingly vertiginous, repulsive and seductive, male and female represents our appetite to endure and conceive and transform everything, despite the often hideous contours of our existence. ” (Glenum, “Notes on Women and the Grotesque”) The Menagerie embodies this hydra-like grotesque in its deliberate transmogrification of the domestic scene and the traditional female role. My poems imply or enact transcendence achieved through mutilation and body horror; marital and motherly tenderness achieved through pain and violence; and sentimental idealistic love discovered through unfaithfulness and masturbation. These poems are a deliberate and necessarily cacophony of oppositions. The Menagerie uses the structure and contrivance of a performed burlesque to embody the spectacle of the Carnival grotesque, but also to understand the multiple failures of overcoming the masculine/feminine divide the history of Burlesque embodies. What we understand as the Burlesque differs almost wholly from the Burlesque of the 1860 s, or Thompsonian Burlesque. Lydia Thompson’s burlesques, though socially outrageous, were based in sex as the striptease of our contemporary Neo-burlesque, but instead worked to parody gender and social roles. Thompsonian performers usurped gender-roles not by flaunting their genitalia but by simultaneously taking on and mocking the roles of men, as Robert Allen expounds in his seminal work on the Burlesque: “[F]emale burlesque performers were never trying to present a convincing, realistic portrayal of a man onstage. Instead, they were utilizing their masculine attire as a sort of fetish object, in fact emphasizing their feminine sexuality by contrasting it with the markers of masculinity. ” (Allen, 29) This parody questions the contrivance of genders, mocking the artificiality of both. Travesties were perpetuated by women/men who constantly broke the laws not only of social norm but of theatrical production. The characters not only acknowledge the audience, but interacted with the audience, commenting on their own unusual costume, gender swapping, and overall artifice. The characters were simultaneously observed and observers, ultimately working to implicate the observer with the production. Ted embodies this complex duality of the burlesque acknowledging gender roles, subverting them, testing them, and dragging the audience along. Therefore, the manuscript attempts the same. The Menagerie follows the same trajectory as the Burlesque historically, eventually succumbing to the projected expectation of the audience. If a woman is defined by her genitalia, what else will suffice in her exhibition? After interacting with her fellow troupe members, Ted, and Ted’s subsequent lyrics, becomes seduced by the audience and the spectacle of herself. In this surrender to the moment of dual vision, Ted loses her vision, idealistically, physically, and metaphorically. The voice is lost, as well as the equality, and what was an attempt at social subversion only serves to reassert the norm. The manuscript ends with a failure of reinvention of self outside of the gaze. Within the realm of lyric understanding, the complex nature between audience and burlesque influences my writing of, and Ted’s interaction with, the lyric...|$|R

In short it grieves me to think that the Heads of the most Apostolical Church in Christendom should have insisted on three or four trifles, the abolition of which could have given offence to none but such as from the baleful superstition that alone could attach importance to them effectually, it was charity to offend;-when all the rest of Baxter's objections might have been answered so triumphantly.|$|E
60|$|On {{some future}} occasion, more {{especially}} demanding such disquisition, I shall attempt {{to prove the}} close connection between veracity and habits of mental accuracy; the beneficial after-effects of verbal precision in the <b>preclusion</b> of fanaticism, which masters the feelings more especially by indistinct watch-words; and to display the advantages which language alone, at least which language with incomparably greater ease and certainty than any other means, presents to the instructor of impressing modes of intellectual energy so constantly, so imperceptibly, and as it were by such elements and atoms, as to secure in due time {{the formation of a}} second nature. When we reflect, that the cultivation of the judgment is a positive command of the moral law, since the reason can give the principle alone, and the conscience bears witness only to the motive, while the application and effects must depend on the judgment when we consider, that the greater part of our success and comfort in life depends on distinguishing the similar from the same, that which is peculiar in each thing from that which it has in common with others, so as still to select the most probable, instead of the merely possible or positively unfit, we shall learn to value earnestly and with a practical seriousness a mean, already prepared for us by nature and society, of teaching the young mind to think well and wisely by the same unremembered process and with the same never forgotten results, as those by which it is taught to speak and converse. Now how much warmer the interest is, how much more genial the feelings of reality and practicability, and thence how much stronger the impulses to imitation are, which a contemporary writer, and especially a contemporary poet, excites in youth and commencing manhood, has been treated of in the earlier pages of these sketches. I have only to add, that all the praise which is due to the exertion of such influence for a purpose so important, joined with that which must be claimed for the infrequency of the same excellence in the same perfection, belongs in full right to Mr. Wordsworth. I am far however from denying that we have poets whose general style possesses the same excellence, as Mr. Moore, Lord Byron, Mr. Bowles, and, in all his later and more important works, our laurel-honouring Laureate. But there are none, in whose works I do not appear to myself to find more exceptions, than in those of Wordsworth. Quotations or specimens would here be wholly out of place, and must be left for the critic who doubts and would invalidate the justice of this eulogy so applied.|$|E
60|$|The fond prefigurements of {{youthful}} piety are predestined {{more often than}} not, I think, experience interfering, to strange and violent shocks; from which no general appeal is conceivable save by the prompt <b>preclusion</b> either of faith or of knowledge, a sad choice at the best. No other such illustration recurs to me of the possible refusal of those two conditions of an acquaintance to recognise each other at a given hour as the silent crash of which I was to be conscious several years later, in Paris, when placed in presence of M. Ernest Renan, from the surpassing distinction of whose literary face, with its exquisite finish of every feature, I had from far back extracted every sort of shining gage, a presumption general and positive. Widely enough to sink all interest--that was the dreadful thing--opened there the chasm between the implied, as I had taken it, and the attested, as I had, at the first blush, to take it; so that one was in fact scarce to know {{what might have happened}} if interest hadn't by good fortune already reached such a compass as to stick half way down the descent. What interest can survive becomes thus, surely, as much one of the lessons of life as the number of ways in which it remains impossible. What comes up in face of the shocks, as I have called them, is the question of a shift of every supposition, a change of base under fire, as it were; which must take place successfully if one's advance be not abandoned altogether. I remember that I saw the Tennyson directly presented as just utterly other than the Tennyson indirectly, and if the readjustment, for acquaintance, was less difficult than it was to prove {{in the case of the}} realised Renan the obligation to accept the difference--wholly as difference and without reference to strict loss or gain--was like a rap on the knuckles of a sweet superstition. Fine, fine, fine could he only be--fine in the sense of that quality in the texture of his verse, which had appealed all along by its most inward principle to one's taste, and had by the same stroke shown with what a force of lyric energy and sincerity the kind of beauty so engaged for could be associated. Was it that I had preconceived him in that light as pale and penetrating, as emphasising in every aspect the fact that he was fastidious? was it that I had supposed him more fastidious than really could have been--at the best for that effect? was it that the grace of the man couldn't, by my measure, but march somehow with the grace of the poet, given a perfection of this grace? was it in fine that style of a particular kind, when so highly developed, seemed logically to leave no room for other quite contradictious kinds? These were considerations of which I recall the pressure, at the same time that I fear I have no account of them to give after they have fairly faced the full, the monstrous demonstration that Tennyson was not Tennysonian. The desperate sequel to that was that he thereby changed one's own state too, one's beguiled, one's æsthetic; for what could this strange apprehension do but reduce the Tennysonian amount altogether? It dried up, to a certain extent, that is, in my own vessel of sympathy--leaving me so to ask whether it was before or after that I should take myself for the bigger fool. There had been folly somewhere; yet let me add that once I recognised this, once I felt the old fond pitch drop of itself, not alone inevitably, but very soon quite conveniently and while I magnanimously granted that the error had been mine and nobody's else at all, an odd prosaic pleasantness set itself straight up, substitutionally, over the whole ground, which it swept clear of every single premeditated effect. It made one's perceptive condition purely profane, reduced it somehow to having rather the excess of awkwardness than the excess of felicity to reckon with; yet still again, as I say, enabled a compromise to work.|$|E
