A method was developed, using linear-shaped mild detonating fuse for controlled rupture of the stainless steel diaphragm. The diaphragm is ruptured at a <b>predetermined</b> <b>delay</b> time after the gas propellant has reached a given pressure. The tests show that diaphragms can be ruptured at chamber pressures up to 10, 500 psi under the ultimate rupture pressure for the diaphragm...|$|E
40|$|By {{applying}} a photonic signal to a microresonator {{that includes a}} photonic bandgap delay apparatus having a photonic band edge transmission resonance at {{the frequency of the}} photonic signal, the microresonator imparts a <b>predetermined</b> <b>delay</b> to the photonic signal. The photonic bandgap delay apparatus also preferably has a photonic band edge transmission resonance bandwidth which is at least as wide as the bandwidth of the photonic signal such that a uniform delay is imparted over the entire bandwidth of the photonic signal. The microresonator also includes a microresonator cavity, typically defined by a pair of switchable mirrors, within which the photonic bandgap delay apparatus is disposed. By requiring the photonic signal to oscillate within the microresonator cavity so as to pass through the photonic bandgap delay apparatus several times, the microresonator can controllably impart an adjustable delay to the photonic signal...|$|E

Such an array is preferably implemented as a high-speed integrated circuit. The computation of the optimum path is accomplished by, in each cell, receiving stimulus signals from neighboring cells along corresponding directions, determining and storing {{the identity of a}} direction along which the first stimulus signal is received, broadcasting a subsequent stimulus signal to the neighboring cells after a <b>predetermined</b> <b>delay</b> time, whereby stimulus signals propagate throughout the array from a starting one of the cells.

Inserting random delays at the nonregenerative fixed relays further improve the system performance. However, random delays result in limited performance gain from multipath diversity. In this paper, two promising delay optimization schemes are introduced for a multicellular OFDM system with cooperative relaying with stationary multiple users and fixed relays. Both of the schemes basically aim to take the most advantages of the potential frequency selectivity by inserting <b>predetermined</b> <b>delays</b> at the relays, in order to further improve the system performance (coverage and throughput). Evaluation results for different multipath fading environments show that the system performance with delay optimization increases tremendously compared with the case of random delay.|$|R

30|$|Chen et al. [13] {{proposed}} Admission Control {{based on}} Estimation of Service times (ACES). That is, to differentiate and admit requests {{based on the}} amount of processing time required by a request. In ACES, admission of a request is decided by comparing the available computation capacity to the <b>predetermined</b> <b>delay</b> bound of the request. The service time estimation is based on an empirical expression, which is derived from an experimental study on a real web server. Shaaban and Hillston [34] proposed Cost-Based Admission Control (CBAC), which uses a congestion control technique. Rather than rejecting user requests at high load, CBAC uses a discount-charge model to encourage users to postpone their requests to less loaded time periods. However, if a user chooses {{to go ahead with the}} request in a high load period, then an extra charge is imposed on the user request. The model is effective for e-commerce web sites when more users place orders that involve monetary transactions. A disadvantage of CBAC is that it requires CBAC-specific web pages to be included in the web application.|$|E
40|$|Recent {{research}} on eye movements during scene viewing {{has focused on}} where the eyes fixate. But eye fixations also differ in their durations. Here we investigated whether fixation durations in scene viewing are under the direct and immediate control of the current visual input. In two scene memorization and one visual search experiments, the scene was removed from view during critical fixations for a <b>predetermined</b> <b>delay,</b> and then restored following the delay. Experiment 1 compared filled (pattern mask) and unfilled (grey field) delays. Experiment 2 compared random to blocked delays. Experiment 3 extended the results to a visual search task. The results demonstrate that fixation durations in scene viewing comprise two fixation populations. One population remains relatively constant across delay, and the second population increases with scene onset delay. The {{results are consistent with}} a mixed eye movement control model that incorporates an autonomous control mechanism with process monitoring. The results suggest that a complete gaze control model will have to account for both fixation location and fixation duration...|$|E
40|$|Abundant {{evidence}} exists {{to confirm that}} fibrinolytic treatment saves lives in patients with acute myocardial infarction and that the earlier the treatment the higher the benefit obtained. ' There is also {{evidence to suggest that}} administration of fibrinolytic treatment, under certain conditions, before hospital admission may lead to further improvement in patients' prognosis with no significant additional risk. 2 - 4 John Rawles attempts to quantify the benefit of earlier fibrinolytic treatment using the data from the 311 patients included in the GREAT trial, which evaluated the feasibility, safety, and efficacy of domiciliary fibrinolysis by general practitioners. 5 Such quantification is essential if providers of health care are to make an informed decision on whether to allocate resources to domiciliary fibrinolysis. The magnitude of the benefit is controversial, and the trial that could fully resolve this will never be performed for obvious ethical reasons. This trial would require randomising patients to, say, four or five groups, each group having a <b>predetermined</b> <b>delay</b> from diagnosis of acute myocardial infarction to fibrinolytic treatment. Thus, the only available way to assess the magnitude of benefit of earlier fibrinolytic treatment compared with later treatment is to retrospectively analyse data from fibrinolytic studies, performing indirect comparisons of the randomised groups or using an epidemiological approach...|$|E

This paper presents the circuit design of 16 -channel Transmit (Tx) and Receive (Rx) beam forming ASIC (Application Specific Integrated Circuit) that can be integrated in ultrasound probe head which reduces the number of coaxial cables. The proposed modular design for programmable 16 -channel transmit beam former operates at medical frequencies in pulse-echo mode and provides user control of transmit parameters such as transmit pulse length, pulse pattern, transmit frequency, and mode of excitation. The receive beam former implements delay and coherent sum of the digitized echoes from 16 adjacent transducer elements to form scan lines required for image reconstruction. The proposed architecture of the Rx beam former design provides great flexibility for beam forming, such as receive focusing with <b>predetermined</b> <b>delay</b> profile. Each transmit channel can be programmable to give a maximum delay of 163. 85 s with 1. 25 ns delay resolution.

30|$|The {{preparation}} and measurement protocol (Figure  8 (b)) would rely upon utilizing the resonant limit of this model. To proceed, the transmon would initially be detuned in energy {{from all of}} the modes in the array and prepared in its first excited state with a microwave pi-pulse applied through a coplanar waveguide (CPW) cavity [55]. Through the application of a flux pulse, the transmon would then be brought into resonance with one of the nanoresonators and allowed to interact for one-half a Rabi cycle (t_Rabi=π/ 2 λ_j), thus transferring its excitation to the nanoresonator mode. Next, after a <b>predetermined</b> <b>delay,</b> the location of the phonon in the nanoresonator array would be measured by scanning the transmon’s transition energy ħν_a (via a flux ramp) through the range of nanoresonator energies. Upon achieving resonance with the populated nanoresonator mode, the transmon would transition through a Rabi transfer back to its first excited state, which could be measured through dispersive read-out of the transmon via the CPW cavity [55, 56]. As me mentioned the precise location of the nanoresonator could be determined from a map of frequencies using electron beam imaging and finite element simulations. Also, {{it should be noted that}} the coherent exchange of excitations through the resonant interaction between a piezoelectric disk resonator and superconducting phase qubit has been demonstrated previously [1]; thus it is expected that a similar technique could be adapted to the case considered here.|$|E
40|$|Abwucf- This paper {{considers}} {{the problem of}} routing sessions with Quality of Service (QoS) requirements in a network under Packet Gener-alized Proceqsor Sharing (PGPS) scheduling. PGPS is a non-preemptive scheduling policy that tracks GPS. The GPS policy operates by allocating a weight @F for a session n whose traffic uses link m. These weights de-termine {{the rate at which}} the traffic from session n is served at link m and the rate in turn determines the end-to-end delay of packets belonging to session n. As a deterministic and easily computable end-to-end delay bound is available for locally stable sessions, we consider the locally sta-ble regime in thk paper. Two separate problems are considered in this paper. The first problem deals with the practically important inverse pro-cedure of specifying appropriate weights for sessions at each link on their paths, that satisfy <b>predetermined</b> <b>delay</b> bounds, when the set of sessions to be routed is given. Here we show that the fixed routing case can be formulated as a Iirieur progrum (LP) and the adaptive routing case can he formulated as a mixed rrireger lrrieur ~~r(igrurn (MILP). The second problem examines the performance of PGPS scheduling policy when providing per-session QoS guarantees. We measure the performance in terms of weighred u r r r e d rrufic [...] We derive an upper hound on the weighted carried traffic for mil heuristic algorithm for admission control that operates within the locally stable domain. This upper bound can be obtained by computing a linear program (LP). By simulating a simple heuristic algorithm for ad-mission control, we show that this upper bound is reasonably tight. Hence our upper bound can be used as a metric against which the performance of different algorithms can he compared. 1...|$|E
40|$|This paper validates {{simulation}} predictions, {{which state}} that specific modes could be enhanced in quantitative ultrasonic bone testing. Tunable selection of ultrasonic guided wave excitation {{is useful in}} non-destructive testing since it permits the mediation of energy into diagnostically useful modes while reducing the energy mediated into disturbing contributions. For instance, it is often challenging to distinguish and extract the useful modes from ultrasound signals measured in bone covered by a soft tissue. We show that a laser diode array can selectively excite ultrasound in bone mimicking phantoms. A fiber-coupled diode array (4 elements) illuminated two solid tubes (2 – 3 mm wall thickness) embraced by an opaque soft-tissue mimicking elastomer coating (5 mm thick). A <b>predetermined</b> time <b>delay</b> matching the selected mode and frequency was employed between the outputs of the elements. The generated ultrasound was detected by a 215 kHz piezo receiver.

40|$|Contrary to {{counterfactual}} definiteness {{quantum theory}} teaches us that measuring instruments are not passively reading predetermined values of physical observables. Counterfactual definiteness allows proving Bell inequalities. If the contextual character of quantum measurements is correctly {{taken into account}} the proofs of these inequalities may not be done. In recent computer simulations of idealized Bell experiment predetermined successive outcomes of measurements for each setting and <b>predetermined</b> time <b>delays</b> of their registrations are calculated. Time windows and time delays are used to select various samples. Correlations, estimated using these selected samples {{are consistent with the}} predictions of quantum theory and the time window dependence is similar to the dependence observed in some real experiments. It is an important example how correlations can be explained without evoking quantum non-locality. However by using a suitable post-selection one may prove anything. Since before the post-selection generated samples may not violate Bell inequalities as significantly as finite samples generated using quantum predictions thus one may not conclude that counterfactual definiteness is not able to distinguish classical from quantum physics. Moreover we show that for each choice of a time window there exists a contextual hidden variable probabilistic model consistent with the post-selection procedure used by the authors what explains why they are able to reproduce quantum predictions.

Optimization of ablation conditions and film growth regime, resp., for various kinds of homogeneous thin films and multilayer systems has been realized by a reproducible variation of pulse energy and repetition rate {{of each of the}} two Nd:YAG-lasers. In addition the lasers can be independently controlled by a <b>predetermined</b> pulse <b>delay.</b> Thus plasma parameters of two plumes generated from locally separated origins can be influenced by the pulse delay of the Nd:YAG-lasers, too. The influence of laser parameters and pulse delay on thin film growth is investigated by the deposition of Ni/C layer stacks. Optimum irradiation conditions are zero delay and moderate pulse energies. Multilayer interface roughnesses on the order of sigma R about 0. 1 nm are deduced from high resolution electron microscopy (HREM) - micrographs. The interface roughness increases with higher pulse energy. For changing the pulse delay from tau= 0 ns to tau = 2. 5 ms a destruction of the layer stack is observed.

40|$|The {{problem that}} we are {{studying}} is how to route messages having different delay sensitivities over an ATM based fiber optic network with parallel links. The capacities of the communication links, the topology of the network and the cost structure are known and {{it is assumed that}} the messages belong to different priority classes to account for the difference in delay requirements. Decisions need to be made about how to distribute the load over the parallel links when <b>predetermined</b> <b>delay</b> guarantees for the different service classes are to be met. We also address the issue of how to decide what price to charge from the users who are requesting delivery of messages belonging to different priority classes under certain quality of service (in terms of delay) constraints. ^ We model the ATM network as a network of M/D/c queues. The parallel links are viewed as 2 ̆ 7 c 2 ̆ 7 servers and the messages as customers. The routing and pricing problem is formulated as a nonlinear mixed integer program. This problem being an NP-Hard problem, the method of Lagrangean Relaxation is used for obtaining lower bounds to the optimal solution. Subgradient optimization is used to obtain estimates of the 2 ̆ 7 best 2 ̆ 7 Lagrange multipliers and these multipliers give the 2 ̆ 7 shadow priority prices 2 ̆ 7 for the different service classes. Efficient heuristics are suggested for generating feasible solutions that provide a guarantee {{about the quality of the}} solution generated by the Lagrangean procedure. The model is run for an example network and a mechanism is devised that trades off the various costs involved in the process of network design. ^ In our research, there is fundamental contribution from queuing theory perspective. Calculation of mean waiting time for multi-server priority queues is known to be a complex problem. As part of our research we have obtained analytical expressions for mean waiting time of different priority classes with exponential arrival and fixed service time. The analytical model that we proposed is a close approximation of current backbone networks and hence the results of our research would be of great significance to network service providers, network designers and also network users. ...|$|E

This 26 study is an age-related investigation of children's ability to delay gratification in an 27 exchange task requiring them {{to wait for}} a significant reward. We gave 252 children aged 28 2 - 4 a small piece of cookie, then offered them an opportunity {{to wait for a}} <b>predetermined</b> 29 <b>delay</b> period before exchanging it for a larger one. In a first experiment, the children had to 30 exchange the initial food item for rewards two, four or eight times larger. Results showed 31 that children aged 3 - 4 years old sustained longer time lags for larger rewards than for 32 smaller rewards. This effect was not found in 2 -year-old subjects. In a second experiment, 33 a reward 40 times larger than the initial piece was offered to determine the maximum 34 waiting time that children could sustain. All age groups increased their performances. 35 Older children were more successful at waiting, but some children as young as 2 years 36 old were able to tolerate delays of up to 16 min. Older children who chose to give up wait- 37 ing earlier than their known capacity demonstrated anticipation skills which had not been 38 seen in younger children, showing that they had anticipated an increase in the time lag, 39 and that they had considered both time and reward value when making their decision. 40 Despite the age effect, we did not establish any limits for delaying gratification in children. 41 This study may have educational implications for dealing with behavioral misconduct, 42 which is known to be related to impulsivity control in young childre...|$|R

40|$|Integer {{ambiguity}} resolution at {{a single}} station {{can be achieved by}} introducing <b>predetermined</b> uncalibrated phase <b>delays</b> (UPDs) into the float ambiguity estimates of precise point positioning (PPP). This integer resolution technique has the potential of leading to a PPP-RTK (Real-Time Kinematic) model where PPP provides rapid convergence to a reliable centimeter-level positioning accuracy based on an RTK reference network. Nonetheless, implementing this model is technically subject to how rapidly we can fix wide-lane ambiguities, stabilize narrow-lane UPD estimates, and achieve the first ambiguity-fixed solution. To investigate these issues, we used seven days of 1 -Hz sampling GPS data at 91 stations across Europe. We find that at least 10 minutes of observations are required for most receiver types to reliably fix about 90 % of wide-lane ambiguities corresponding to high elevations, and over 20 minutes to fix about 90 % of those corresponding to low elevations. Moreover, several tens of minutes are usually required for a regional network before a narrow-lane UPD estimate stabilizes to an accuracy of far better than 0. 1 cycles. Finally, for hourly data, ambiguity resolution can significantly improve the accuracy of epoch-wise position estimates from 13. 7, 7. 1 and 11. 4 cm to 0. 8, 0. 9 and 2. 5 cm for the East, North and Up components, respectively, but a few tens of minutes is required to achieve the first ambiguity-fixed solution. Therefore, from the timeliness aspect, our PPP-RTK model currently cannot satisfy the critical requirement of instantaneous precise positioning where ambiguity-fixed solutions have to be achieved within at most a few seconds. However, this model can still be potentially applied to some near-real-time remote sensing applications, such as the GPS meteorology...|$|R
