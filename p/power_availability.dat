25|$|Cooling towers {{originated}} in the 19th century {{through the development of}} condensers for use with the steam engine. Condensers use relatively cool water, via various means, to condense the steam coming out of the cylinders or turbines. This reduces the back pressure, which in turn reduces the steam consumption, and thus the fuel consumption, {{while at the same time}} increasing power and recycling boiler-water. However the condensers require an ample supply of cooling water, without which they are impractical. The consumption of cooling water by inland processing and power plants is estimated to reduce <b>power</b> <b>availability</b> for the majority of thermal power plants by 2040–2069. While water usage is not an issue with marine engines, it forms a significant limitation for many land-based systems.|$|E

The RF Shower amplifies the signals transmitted by neighboring RFID readers and then transmits them again {{to expand the}} interrogation zones of the readers. However, since multiple readers may have the exactly identical interrogation zone by the Shower, collision between readers becomes severe.

2500|$|Van Halen had {{a notable}} {{effect on the}} modern rock music tour with {{their use of the}} concert {{technical}} contract rider. They were one of the first bands to use contract riders to specify a [...] "wish list," [...] a practice now used throughout the music industry. They pioneered extensive requirements including <b>power</b> <b>availability</b> and stage construction details. The band's demands were not limited to technical issues; their now-infamous rider specified that a bowl of M's, with all of the brown M's removed, was to be placed in their dressing room. According to David Lee Roth, this was listed in the technical portion of the contract not because the band wanted to make capricious demands of the venue, but rather as a test {{of whether or not the}} contract had actually been thoroughly read and honored, as it contained other requirements involving legitimate safety concerns. If the bowl was present, then the band members could safely assume the other, legitimate, items in the technical rider were being fulfilled to their satisfaction. Conversely, if the bowl was missing, or brown M's were present, then the band members would be within their rights to have the venue inspect the work, ask it be redone, etc. Their concern for safety was real: during their earlier tours, not only had equipment been damaged, but several members of their road crew were nearly electrocuted, both due to inadequate safety measures and preparation on the part of the local venue.|$|E

2500|$|The USAF {{ordered a}} total of 259 Predators, and due to retirements and crashes the number in Air Force {{operation}} was reduced to 154 as of May 2014. [...] Budget proposals planned to retire the Predator fleet between FY 2015 and 2017 {{in favor of the}} larger MQ-9 Reaper, which has greater payload and range. [...] The Predators would likely be stored at Davis-Monthan Air Force Base or be given to other organizations willing to take them. [...] The Customs and Border Patrol has shown interest, but already operate higher-performance Reapers and are having difficulty with operating costs. [...] The U.S. Coast Guard has also shown interest in land-based UAV surveillance. [...] Foreign sales are also an option, but the MQ-1 may be subject to limitations of the Missile Technology Control Regime because it can be armed. [...] Export markets are also limited by the Reaper as well. Given the Predator's phasing out and low size, weight, and <b>power</b> <b>availability,</b> the Air Force decided not to look into upgrades to make it more effective in contested environments and found its only use in defended airspace would be to be shot down while drawing fire away from other aircraft. Due to needed airborne surveillance after the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) invaded Iraq, the Predator's retirement was pushed to 2018. [...] MQ-1s will probably be placed in non-recoverable storage at the Boneyard and not sold to allies, although antenna, ground control stations, and other components may be salvaged for continued use on other airframes.|$|E

We implement our policies on CloudLab, and evaluate their performance on multiple applications. Our results demonstrate the importance of designing for green energy with variable power. For example, we show that Graph 500 requires 17 % more time and 9 % more energy to complete when power varies based on real-time electricity prices versus when power is unlimited at a fixed price. However, since real-time prices are lower than fixed prices, the total electricity cost of our best energy management policy when using real-time prices is 67 % less than when using fixed prices.
