5|$|Despite ongoing {{efforts by}} the Ministry of Domestic Security, crime has worsened in Antananarivo since 2009.

Under the mayorship of Marc Ravalomanana (1998–2001), street lights were installed or repaired throughout the city to improve night-time safety. He increased the number of police officers on the streets, leading to a drop in crime. , the city lacks a comprehensive strategy for reducing crime.

5|$|During the war, the city's {{population}} {{increased with}} the arrival of new businesses and industries that offered additional employment opportunities, spurred real estate development, and ushered {{in the beginning of the}} city's urban, industrial development. In addition, street crime was prevalent, causing the city government to increase its police force and local merchants to hire <b>private</b> <b>security.</b> The era was also a time of bitter political disputes between Indiana's Democrats and Republicans. In May 1863, in an incident sarcastically called the Battle of Pogue's Run, Union soldiers stopped and searched two departing trainloads of delegates to a statewide Democratic convention, many of whom tossed their personal weapons into a nearby creek. In July 1863 Indianapolis residents feared an attack from Confederate forces during Morgan's Raid into southern Indiana, but the Confederates turned east toward Ohio and never came to the city.|$|E

5|$|In 2006 a <b>private</b> <b>security</b> {{guard with}} a pistol pursued on foot two men whom he {{believed}} tried to steal scrap metal. The men climbed on a railway embankment and started throwing rocks down at the guard who thereafter shot ten rounds in their direction, mortally wounding {{one of them in}} the head. The guard was first convicted of murder by the Municipal Court in Prague and given a sentence of 7 years imprisonment. The decision was changed by the High Court in Prague to conviction of intentional infliction of bodily harm resulting in death (i.e. manslaughter) and a sentence of five years imprisonment. The guard was finally exonerated by the Supreme Court in Brno which considered his action legitimate self-defense, noting that defense must be clearly more intensive than attack in order to be successful, and that the stones and bricks being thrown presented grave danger to the man's life.|$|E

But tensions rose {{on both sides of}} the border, including threats of assassination, so the Texas Rangers, 4,000 U.S. and Mexican troops, U.S. Secret Service agents, FBI agents and U.S. marshals were all called in to provide security. Burnham was put in charge of a 250 <b>private</b> <b>security</b> detail hired by Hammond, who in addition to owning large investments in Mexico was a close friend of Taft from Yale and a U.S. Vice-Presidential candidate in 1908.

5|$|In late 1971, John Dean, the White House Counsel, {{pushed to}} expand the {{existing}} intelligence program ahead of the 1972 re-election campaign. Dean delegated the task to Jack Caulfield, {{a member of his}} staff who was a former New York police officer. According to Dean, Caulfield himself was interested in work outside of politics; he intended to create a <b>private</b> <b>security</b> company, and felt that if the Nixon cabinet were an early client, it would lead to lucrative future clients within the private sector. Fred Emery, a journalist for The Times and BBC, refutes this, claiming in his book Watergate: The Corruption & Fall of Richard Nixon that the idea of a private sector security firm was simply a front for a committed campaign of surveillance working Nixon and the Republican Party, with political donations to the re-election campaign able to be diverted through the company as though they were unrelated transactions.|$|E

40|$|We {{examine whether}} equity-linked <b>private</b> <b>securities</b> offerings {{are used as}} a {{mechanism}} for tunneling among firms that belong to a Korean chaebol.

We also find that chaebol issuers (member acquirers) realize an 8. 8 % (5. 8 %) higher (lower) announcement return than do other types of issuers (acquirers) if they sell <b>private</b> <b>securities</b> at a premium to other member firms, and if the controlling shareholders receive positive net gains from equity ownership in issuers and acquirers.
