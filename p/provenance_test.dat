Combining such knowledge with constantly improving global climate models and climate change scenarios can inform seed deployment decisions to produce nursery stock that is best adapted to a given planting site (Joyce and Rehfeldt 2013; Yang et al. 2015).

40|$|AbstractBackgroundThe {{diagnostic}} algorithm {{for most}} cancers includes {{the assessment of}} a tissue specimen by a surgical pathologist, but if specimen provenance is uncertain, the diagnostic and therapeutic process carries significant risk to the patient. Over the last decade, short tandem repeat (STR) analysis {{has emerged as a}} DNA-based method with clinical applicability for specimen identity testing (also known as specimen <b>provenance</b> <b>testing).</b> Although the clinical utility of identity testing using STR-based analysis has been demonstrated in many studies, its economic value has not been established. MethodsWe developed a decision-analytic model of the application of STR-based <b>provenance</b> <b>testing</b> of transrectal prostate biopsy specimens obtained as part of routine clinical care to rule out the presence of adenocarcinoma of the prostate, as compared with no STR-based testing. Using parameter values drawn from the published literature, the cost-effectiveness of STR-based testing was quantified by calculating the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio per quality-adjusted life-year gained. ResultsIn comparison to the current standard practice of no identity testing, identity testing by STR-based analysis has an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of $ 65, 570 per quality-adjusted life-year gained at a testing cost of $ 618 per person. At a cost of $ 515 per person, identity testing would meet the conservative standard of $ 50, 000 per quality-adjusted life-year. At a test cost of $ 290 per person, identity testing would be cost saving. ConclusionGiven the rapidly declining pricing of STR-based identity testing, it is likely that testing to confirm the identity of positive prostate biopsy samples will be a cost-effective method for preventing treatment errors stemming from misidentification. Studies to formally establish the frequency of specimen provenance errors in routine clinical practice would therefore seem justified...|$|R

The Istebna race proved to have a good value, however, so far only the progeny of single stands have been tested. It is thus necessary to determine the range of distribution for this race. The altitude of the location of mother stands significantly correlates with the genetic and breeding value of their progeny cultivated at different altitudes. This suggests that the altitude and exposure of plantations to be established in mountain forest belts should be specified for individual prov-enances (altitudinal zoning).

Herbaria material was used to measure the following parameters: leaf length, leaf width, petiole length, leaf base width at 1 cm (from petiole base), the number of veins -on the left, the number of veins - on the right, and distance between the 3 rd and 4 th vein - on the left. Based on research results, it can be concluded that the obtained differences between the mean values of all measured foliar characteristics of the analyzed provenances are statistically significant, and that there is significant correlation between the length and width of leaves and the Ellenberg’s quotient (EQ). The relationship between the adaptive traits of beech from different provenances and ecological parameters of their seed source stands indicates genetic differentiation of beech, {{as a consequence of the}} population adaptation to local environmental conditions.

Due to substantial genetic diversity and phenotypic plasticity, beech has successfully adapted to different environments within its natural range. <b>Provenance</b> <b>tests</b> provide a good basis for studying within- and between-provenance genetic variation, due to homogeneous within-trial environmental conditions. The aim of the present study was to determine the within- and between-provenance genetic variability of certain leaf morphological traits among eleven beech provenances, grown in a common garden experiment. Univariate analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used to test for differences among the studied beech provenances. Principal component analysis (PCA) allowed a complex assessment of the relationships among the provenances and an estimation of multivariate relations among the analyzed characters. The results of the study revealed the existence of substantial variability among provenances (p< 0. 001). Likewise, high genetic variability was observed at the intra-provenance level (p< 0. 001). The first three principal components (PC 1 -PC 3) explained approximately 81 % of the total variance among the European beech <b>provenances</b> <b>tested.</b> The highest contribution on PC 1 corresponded to variables related to leaf size: leaf area (- 0. 882) and leaf width (- 0. 876). Based on the position of provenances on a PCA scatter plot, it could be assumed that European beech is characterized by a more ecotypic pattern of genetic variation rather than by clinal variation. Also, the presence of considerable genetic diversity within provenances will be important in the light of climate change impact on beech, since it could potentially facilitate rapid adaptation.

Six populations were from relatively high rainfall sites in Portugal and southwestern France (Atlantic group), and one population was from a more arid Mediterranean site in Spain.

A population from central Portugal (Leiria, on the Atlantic coast) was the tallest and had the lowest δ 13 C. Overall, the variation in δ 13 C was better explained by the mean minimum temperatures of the coldest month than by annual precipitation at the place of origin.

A total of 89 IUFRO provenances, planted on 16 sites, were analysed. Type B correlations were {{used to examine the}} relation among geographical differences between sites and their site-to-site correlations. The site index differences between sites was the only variable that explained the Type B correlation variation, indicating that P x E interaction arises from site index differences between test sites. The lack of significant correlations between geographical differences and Type B correlations between sites, suggested that all the studied area should be considered as a unique breeding zone. Despite the relative high Type B correlation within all the studied area (r, > 0. 6), the analyses of variance indicated a high relative importance of the P x E interaction, especially at the earlier stages. This interaction must be considered for selection and provenances recommendation. It was concluded that selection should be made for stability and overall good performance within the whole area. Provenance stability over the site index variation was analysed by the joint regression analysis. Significant stability differences were found among provenances.

40|$|International audienceProblem: Should we use {{seeds from}} warmer {{locations}} to adapt forests {{to climate change}} ? We define assisted migration as the project to translocate populations to compensate for observed or future climate changes. It is justified since the pace of climate change is too rapid for most populations to track changing climates. The idea of assisted migration questions the current paradigm in forestry management, which is that local provenances are always the best first choice. The cases of Oak and Pine populations in France illustrate the timeliness but also the dangers of this idea. Method: A decision-making framework based on imprecises probabilities and multiple worldviews is used, which accounts for rationality and precaution. We represent the deep uncertainty on climate change by using worldviews on long term climate change based on simulations of 3 RCP scenarios and 3 climate models. Data: Experimental data from the British Columbia Ministry of Forests and Range's lodgepole pine <b>provenance</b> <b>test,</b> which consists of 140 populations tested at 62 sites, were used. An incomplete testing design tested 60 of the 140 populations at each site, so that each population was tested at 30 – 40 sites.

The growth response model predicts that increasing annual mean temperatures will result in accelerated growth if precipitation is sufficient, but only within the limits characteristic of the species. At the southern limits of distribution, growth and competitive ability of the species will decline, leading to successional changes...|$|R
40|$|<b>Provenance</b> <b>tests</b> {{can provide}} {{information}} about the silvicultural behavior and wood quality for the exploration of variability and conservation of genetic material for future use. This study aims to investigate the effect of provenances on some wood properties of the Cariniana legalis. Seedlings of three provenances (Porto Ferreira, Piracicaba and Campinas) were planted in Luiz Antonio-SP using randomized block design with six replicates. After 26 years of planting, eighteen trees, six of each provenance, were felled. The properties studied were basic density and the cellular dimensions. The results revealed that the basic density, fiber length, fiber wall thickness, vessel element length, vessel diameter, uniseriate ray height and width were influenced by the provenances. A good positive relationship was found among the fiber length, fiber wall thickness, vessel element length; vessel diameter and multiseriate ray height with radial position and a negative relation between vessel frequency with the radial position...|$|R
40|$|Phytophthora cambivora (Straminipila, Oomycota) causes {{root rot}} and stem canker on several {{deciduous}} tree species in Europe. However, {{very little is}} known about the variation in susceptibility to P. cambivora colonisation among provenances and families of pedunculate oak (Quercus robur L.). We studied variation in susceptibility of one French and 16 Polish provenances, representing 62 families. Samples were taken from three test plots located in the Brzesko Forest District. Oak susceptibility to P. cambivora was assessed by measuring lesion length following inoculation of excised shoots with two isolates of P. cambivora. There was significant variability in susceptibility among the 17 <b>provenances</b> <b>tested.</b> The highest susceptibility to P. cambivora was apparent in several provenances including Tronçais, Zaporowo, Runowo, Opole and Krotoszyn; while the most resistant provenances originated from Chojnów, Siedlce, Płock, Krotoszyn- 90 and Wioska. There was also significant within-provenances variation in susceptibility to P. cambivora...|$|R
