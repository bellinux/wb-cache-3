40|$|A {{technique}} for imaging the nonlinear ultrasonic parameter B/A has been developed. The nonlinear parameter describes {{the dependence of}} ultrasonic velocity on pressure and may well provide a new and powerful tool for characterizing both biological and nonbiological media. Our approach is based on observing the interaction of two ultrasonic waves with different frequencies and power levels. A low frequency pump wave, with power level suitable for medical diagnosis (1 mW/cm 2), is used to sinusoidally modulate the sound pressure over the region of interest. A much lower intensity high-frequency probe beam is propagated perpen-dicularly to the pump beam. The phase of the probe wave is modified {{in proportion to the}} integral of the product of the nonlinear parameter B/A and the pressure of the pump wave, which varies sinusoidally along the probe beam. tribution of the nonlinear parameter BfA for the spatial frequency corresponding to the inverse of the pump wavelength. frequency of the pump waves, the spatial frequency is changed and a set of spatial Fourier coefficients of the distribution of the nonlinear parameter B/A is obtained. An inverse operation then gives the one-dimensional image along the probe beam. mechanically, the entire cross-sectional image is obtained.

40|$|International Telemetering Conference Proceedings / October 17 - 20, 1994 / Town & Country Hotel and Conference Center, San Diego, CaliforniaThe Two Wire Automatic Remote Sensing and Evaluation System (TWARSES) {{automatically}} transmits and evaluates information (data) from remote sensors on {{a common}} two wire buss. In addition the system presents automatic evaluation and alarms, which provide both location data and sensor readout data of the monitored area. This system is a stand-alone modular system in which a common two wire line installed bow-to-stern and top-to-bottom, connects, integrates, evaluates, and powers a multiplicity of sensors. The United States Navy uses this system to provide safety and survivability by monitoring environmental gases, liquid levels, and power, temperature, and humidity levels on ships and in office buildings. The automatic monitoring system operates {{in a manner similar}} to an automatic, multiscriber, party-line telephone system. The system is controlled by the Scanner/Display unit which interrogates each of the 150 possible sensors according to the program stored in a microprocessor. This patented system provides a separate address for each sensor transponder, permitting all of the transponders to be simply connected in parallel across a common, twisted pair transmission line. The interrogating signal is also used to provide power (6 V - 2 mA) for the sensor transponders and their associated sensors. This further simplifies the system by eliminating the need for a separate source of power at each sensor location. Each sensor is interrogated with a 15 -bit sequence which specifies: (1) the address of the sensor which is to reply, (2) the <b>parameter</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>reported</b> (e. g. voltage, temperature, humidity, etc.) And (3) the desired precision (which sets the length of the reply). The interrogation is transmitted as frequency shift-keyed signal. Among the various types of interrogation signals which could be used (AM, FM, etc.) frequency shift-keying (FSK) was selected because...|$|E

40|$|Scan-derived {{landmarks}} {{locations and}} surface shapes {{are more and}} more used, but there is no commonly accepted protocol for evaluating the accuracy of these measurements. Therefore we propose a protocol for evaluating the accuracy of surface shape and the repeatability of scan-derived landmark locations. According to existing Japanese and German domestic standards, we propose to use an artefact (e. g. sphere with diameter of about 120 mm) calibrated very accurately for evaluating the accuracy of scanner-systems. For evaluating the repeatability of landmark locations, we propose to use an anthropomorphic dummy with landmark locations premarked. These test objects are measured by a 3 D body scanner <b>to</b> <b>be</b> evaluated. Evaluation <b>parameters</b> such as trueness, precision, and repeatability are calculated from the measured data. A round-robin test was conducted in six different institutes using 17 body/head/foot scanners produced by eight companies.

40|$|Later {{phases of}} the High Current Transport Experiment (HCX) at LBNL will employ superconducting {{magnetic}} quadrupole lenses to focus an intense, heavy-ion beam over approximately 50 lattice periods (100 quadrupoles). Here they present a characterization of a baseline quadrupole design suitable for transporting a single, low-energy ({approx} 2 MeV), high-current ({approx} 800 mA) heavy-ion (K{sup +}) beam that will be provided from an existing injector and beam matching section. For optimal performance in this application, a compact quadrupole magnet providing high focusing strength and high field quality is required. The reference parameters that they have chosen take into account magnet development work by AML, LLNL, and MIT and result in a transport lattice well matched to programmatic needs with a lattice period of approximately 50 cm. The goal of this note <b>is</b> <b>to</b> introduce a common framework where the magnetic performance of different designs can be compared. In that regard, they try to avoid the details of an earlier parameter note [1] where provisions for tweaks in magnet excitation, cryostat assembly, etc. were discussed in fairly general terms. This note <b>is</b> not intended <b>to</b> <b>be</b> a final specification for the HCX quadrupoles <b>to</b> <b>be</b> constructed or <b>to</b> <b>be</b> the sole basis on which competing magnet designs will be compared. Other aspects such as prototype test results, economic considerations, and attractiveness {{within the context of}} ultimate applications in multi-beam drivers for heavy-ion fusion (i. e, compatibility with magnet arrays, etc.) will all factor in the selection of the appropriate design option.

40|$|A simple genetic {{algorithm}} for the numerical evaluation of binodal curves in ternary systems polymer-liquid (1) -liquid (2) and polymer (1) -polymer (2) -solvent is presented. The technique exploits a specifically developed restarting technique {{based on a}} combined elitist and zooming strategy on the last population at each iteration. The objective function (fitness) {{is represented by the}} weighted sum of the squared differences of chemical potentials of the two phases of each component, obtained evaluating first derivatives of Gibbs free energy of the mixture with respect to the number of moles of the components. The method proposed (a) is numerically stable since it does not require the evaluation of first derivatives of the objective function and (b) can be applied {{in a wide range of}} cases changing the equation of state. Several comparisons with simplified iterative procedures presented in the past in the technical literature both for mixtures of two polymers with identical characteristics in a solvent and for mixtures of solvent-non solvent-polymer with solvent-polymer interaction <b>parameter</b> equal <b>to</b> zero <b>are</b> <b>reported.</b> Finally, a comparison between present results and the "alternating tangent approach" <b>is</b> <b>reported</b> for two technically meaningful binary systems, when a simplified PC-SAFT equation of state is adopted.

40|$|Oyster {{transports}} {{are among}} the leading anthropogenic vectors of coastwise introduction of non-indigenous species. Using the oyster industry of the Netherlands as a model system, we investigated the relationship between vector strength (number of invasions) and vector tempo (magnitude and frequency of transport) in analyzing and predicting invasion patterns. We reviewed literature on oyster-associated species introductions, analyzed the scale of commercial oyster imports, and collected and identified epiflora from Pacific oyster shells. A total of 35 protist, algal, and invertebrate species have <b>been</b> introduced <b>to</b> the Netherlands with oysters, and we found 41 species of macroalgae on transported oysters. However, the number of introductions and quantity of oysters imported are not necessarily positively correlated, particularly in the past 20 yr, when oyster imports decreased but the rate of introductions increased. The discrepancy between vector tempo and strength {{can be explained by}} unreported imports and vector characteristics: a single oyster may harbor a large number of species which are introduced with their substrate, thus facilitating establishment. Further, the recently developed extensive Pacific oyster reefs in Dutch waters provide a suitable substrate, enabling establishment even after low propagule pressure introduction events. Assumptions that are made about crucial <b>parameters</b> need <b>to</b> <b>be</b> reconsidered: <b>reported</b> propagule pressure <b>is</b> not the same as actual propagule pressure; per-episode diversity of potential inoculants is not at a fixed level without episodic unpredictable spikes, and the recipient environment is not static. With increasing interest in predicting invasion patterns, caution must be taken in assuming that reduced propagule pressure will lead to reduced invasions...|$|R
