500|$|One of my very {{greatest}} fears as a {{child was}} being ridiculed in public. And there it was coming true. As a television presenter, I'd been respected. <b>People</b> <b>come</b> <b>up</b> {{to you in the}} street and shake your hand and talk to you in a respectful way. And suddenly, overnight, this was transformed into [...] "Icke's a nutter." [...] I couldn't walk down any street in Britain without being laughed at. It was a nightmare. My children were devastated because their dad was a figure of ridicule.|$|E
500|$|Executive {{producer}} Frank Spotnitz {{noted that}} the episode bore stylistic similarities to [...] "Paper Hearts". However, unlike the episode, [...] "Sein und Zeit", and its second part [...] "Closure", sets out to actually {{answer the question of}} Samantha's disappearance. Spotnitz later explained, [...] "it's similar [...] in the sense that what you always thought happened to Samantha may not have actually happened. 'Paper Hearts' never ultimately answers the question. We've had <b>people</b> <b>come</b> <b>up</b> to us and say, 'Okay, so we know she's really dead, so what happened?' So we decided in this one to answer the question." [...] The episode's title, Sein und Zeit, is a reference to Martin Heidegger's best known work and means [...] "Being and Time" [...] in German.|$|E
500|$|Giving {{the film}} only the tagline [...] "A love {{story in the}} city of dreams", David Lynch has refused to comment on Mulholland Drives meaning or symbolism, leading to much {{discussion}} and multiple interpretations. The Christian Science Monitor film critic David Sterritt spoke with Lynch after the film screened at Cannes and wrote that the director [...] "insisted that Mulholland Drive does tell a coherent, comprehensible story", unlike some of Lynch's earlier films like Lost Highway. On the other hand, Justin Theroux said of Lynch's feelings on the multiple meanings people perceive in the film, [...] "I think he's genuinely happy for it to mean anything you want. He loves it when <b>people</b> <b>come</b> <b>up</b> with really bizarre interpretations. David works from his subconscious." ...|$|E

500|$|During the {{production}} of [...] "Irreplaceable", Hermansen thought that the track would not receive radio play because of the acoustic guitars, and deemed the song too pop-oriented. Hermansen did not expect [...] "Irreplaceable" [...] to conform to any genre. Despite his prediction, the song became successful on urban charts. It was played in New York and on country radio stations. Shortly {{after the release of}} [...] "Irreplaceable", Beyoncé told MTV: [...] "I love 'Irreplaceable'. I think it's important to have those songs. I've had so many <b>people</b> <b>come</b> <b>up</b> to me in tears, saying, 'I experienced my first breakup. If it wasn't for the song, I wouldn't be strong enough to not call. I wouldn't know how much I'm worth.' I'm happy {{to be a part of}} that." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Homer vs. Lisa and the 8th Commandment" [...] {{was written}} by {{freelance}} writer Steve Pepoon and directed by Rich Moore. It was originally going to be named [...] "Homer vs. the 8th Commandment", but the writers decided to include Lisa in the title because they wanted the cast {{to feel as if}} all their characters were equally represented on the show. The episode is based on the Eighth Commandment ("thou shall not steal"), {{which is one of the}} Ten Commandments. The Simpsons writer Al Jean said that [...] "whenever <b>people</b> <b>come</b> <b>up</b> to me and say that The Simpsons is just sort of this outrageous show that has no moral center, I always point them to this , where Homer gets an illegal cable hook-up (which many people have done in real life) and suffers enormous consequences." ...|$|E
500|$|In news {{coverage}} that aired in January 2005 of {{the filming of}} the rodeo scene, Bobby Rowe, producer of the Salem, Virginia rodeo depicted in the film, provided background on how he had become {{the victim of a}} hoax. He said that [...] "months" [...] prior to the appearance, he had been approached by someone from [...] "One America, a California-based film company that was reportedly doing a documentary on a Russian immigrant"; he agreed to permit the [...] "immigrant" [...] to sing the U.S. national anthem after listening to a tape. After the film's release, Rowe said [...] "Some <b>people</b> <b>come</b> <b>up</b> and say, 'Hey, you made the big time'; I've made the big time, but not in the way I want it." [...] Cindy Streit, Borat's etiquette consultant, subsequently hired high-profile attorney Gloria Allred, who demanded that the California Attorney General investigate fraud allegedly committed by Baron Cohen and the film's producers.|$|E

500|$|Film critic Roger Ebert {{gave the}} film {{four out of}} four stars and called it [...] "a {{wonderful}} film." [...] The Hollywood Reporter lauded the film as [...] "Winsome, touching and arguably the funniest Pixar effort ever, this gorgeously rendered, high-flying adventure is a tidy 90-minute distillation of all the signature touches that came before it." [...] Although the San Francisco Chronicle noted that the film [...] "contains many boring stretches of mindless freneticism and bland character interaction," [...] it also declared that there are scenes in Up of [...] "such beauty, economy and poetic wisdom that they belong in any anthology of great movie moments...to watch Up with any attention is to be moved and astonished by the economy with which specific visuals are invested with emotion throughout ..." [...] Variety enthused that [...] "Up is an exceptionally refined picture; unlike so many animated films, it's not all about sensory bombardment and volume...Unsurprisingly, no one puts a foot wrong here. Vocal performances...exude a warm enthusiasm, and tech specifications could not be better. Michel Giacchino's full-bodied, traditional score is superlative..." [...] The Globe and Mail stated that Up is [...] "the kind of movie that leaves you asking 'How do <b>people</b> <b>come</b> <b>up</b> with this stuff?'" [...] along with an overall positive review on the film, despite it being predictable.|$|E
500|$|Wall Street enjoyed renewed {{interest}} in the film in 1990 when the cover of Newsweek magazine asked, [...] "Is Greed Dead?" [...] after 1980s icons like Michael Milken and Ivan Boesky ran afoul of insider trading laws. Over the years, the film's screenwriter Stanley Weiser has been approached by numerous people who told him, [...] "The movie changed my life. Once I saw it I knew that I {{wanted to get into}} such and such business. I wanted to be like Gordon Gekko". In addition, both Charlie Sheen and Michael Douglas still have <b>people</b> <b>come</b> <b>up</b> to them and say that they became stockbrokers because of their respective characters in the film. In recent years, Stone was asked how the financial market depicted in Wall Street has changed and he replied, [...] "The problems that existed in the 1980s market grew and grew into a much larger phenomenon. Enron is a fiction, in a sense, {{in the same way that}} Gordon Gekko's buying and selling was a fiction ... Kenny Lay—he's the new Gordon Gekko". Entertainment Weekly magazine's Owen Gleiberman recently commented that the film, [...] "reveals something now which it couldn't back then: that the Gordon Gekkos of the world weren't just getting rich—they were creating an alternate reality that was going to crash down on all of us".|$|E

2500|$|Pete's catchphrase was [...] "alright treacle?" [...] {{pronounced}} [...] "awight treacle", {{often used}} when addressing female characters. Peter Dean has discussed why the catchphrase came into existence: [...] "I had this saying - treacle. There was this long scene with Den and his mistress and I {{had to ask}} her for a drink, but I completely forgot her name, so said 'Give us a drink, treacle'. And after the episode came out, the actress said her children kept calling her treacle! A couple of scriptwriters wanted to stop it - they didn't want any catchphrases. But one lovely writer put it in so I could say {{it was in the}} script! And it stuck. Poor people couldn't afford sugar so put treacle in their tea. And it just means someone sweet and nice. I always said it and my granddad said it. Even now <b>people</b> <b>come</b> <b>up</b> to me and ask if I'll say 'awight treacle' down their mobile phone to someone." ...|$|E
2500|$|Qasimov's daughter, Ferghana Qasimova, {{had been}} informally practising {{with her father}} {{since the age of}} sixteen and was an avid student of mugham. By the age of twenty she had become a {{fully-fledged}} singer in her own right and Qasimov chose to introduce his daughter into his ensemble. Ferghana first appeared on 1997's The Legendary Art of Mugham on which the two shared the vocal tasks on the song Getme Getme. Their next album included a track, Bagishlamani, dedicated to his forebear; Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan. The release marked a high point for Qasimov as it was his first widely available release to western audiences and it proved a critical success. His aim to reconnect younger generations with mugham began to pay dividends; not only was he appealing to traditional Islamic sections of the Azerbaijani population, but also to more Americanised and modern audiences. The break through amongst the younger generations spurred him on: [...] "Sometimes young <b>people</b> <b>come</b> <b>up</b> after a concert to thank me. That's like giving me wings. I feel so elated when I can awaken such feelings in people while they are still young; mugham is not an easy genre for young people to understand".|$|E

2500|$|In July 1997, Weld was {{nominated}} to become United States Ambassador to Mexico by President Bill Clinton. His nomination stalled after Senate Foreign Relations committee Chairman Jesse Helms refused {{to hold a}} hearing on the nomination, effectively blocking it. Helms was also a Republican and their party held the majority in the chamber, but Helms objected to Weld's moderate stance on social issues such as his support for gay rights, abortion rights, and the legalization of medical marijuana. This refusal to hold hearings was also rumored to be at the request of former United States Attorney General and friend of Helms, Edwin Meese. Meese reportedly had a long-standing grudge against Weld stemming from Weld's investigation of Meese during the Iran-Contra affair. Meese denied the speculation, asserting that he wished to keep his distance from Weld. Weld publicly criticized Helms, which the White House discouraged him from doing, but Weld relished the opportunity, saying: [...] "It feels like being in a campaign. I feel newly energized. I love to stir up the pot. I seem to click on more cylinders when the pot is stirred up." [...] Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott said that Weld's chances of being confirmed weren't [...] "very good, and that he hurt himself by attacking the chairman unfairly and with political rhetoric that was just uncalled for." [...] There was speculation that the White House would let his nomination [...] "die", but he refused, saying that he hoped President Clinton [...] "does not plan to give in to ideological extortion" [...] and that [...] "I wanted to send a message that I wanted to be captain of my ship [...] even if it's going to bottom." [...] Some speculated that attacking the more conservative Helms was a way to position him to pick up votes from fellow moderate Republicans in a potential run for president in 2000, but he rejected this, saying that [...] "I've had a lot of <b>people</b> <b>come</b> <b>up</b> to me on the street and say, 'Give 'em hell. That's the Bill Weld we know and love.'" ...|$|E

60|$|Well, {{here you}} have the state of mind of whole brigades of people, and {{particularly}} of young people, nowadays. The current morality hasn't gripped them; they don't really believe in it at all. They may render it lip-service, but that is quite another thing. There are scarcely any tolerable novels to justify its prohibitions; its prohibitions do, in fact, remain unjustified amongst these ugly suppressions. You may, if you choose, silence the admission of this in literature and current discussion; you will not prevent it working out in lives. <b>People</b> <b>come</b> <b>up</b> to the great moments of passion crudely unaware, astoundingly unprepared as no really civilised and intelligently planned community would let any one be unprepared. They find themselves hedged about with customs that have no organic hold upon them, and mere discretions all generous spirits are disposed to despise.|$|E
60|$|London did {{not contain}} above a {{thousand}} inhabitants; and this number was continually diminishing. Most of them were country <b>people,</b> <b>come</b> <b>up</b> {{for the sake of}} change; the Londoners had sought the country. The busy eastern part of the town was silent, or at most you saw only where, half from cupidity, half from curiosity, the warehouses had been more ransacked than pillaged: bales of rich India goods, shawls of price, jewels, and spices, unpacked, strewed the floors. In some places the possessor had to the last kept watch on his store, and died before the barred gates. The massy portals of the churches swung creaking on their hinges; and some few lay dead on the pavement. The wretched female, loveless victim of vulgar brutality, had wandered to the toilet of high-born beauty, and, arraying herself in the garb of splendour, had died before the mirror which reflected to herself alone her altered appearance. Women whose delicate feet had seldom touched the earth in their luxury, had fled in fright and horror from their homes, till, losing themselves in the squalid streets of the metropolis, they had died on the threshold of poverty. The heart sickened at the variety of misery presented; and, when I saw a specimen of this gloomy change, my soul ached with the fear of what might befall my beloved Idris and my babes. Were they, surviving Adrian and myself, to find themselves protectorless in the world? As yet the mind alone had suffered--could I for ever put off the time, when the delicate frame and shrinking nerves of my child of prosperity, the nursling of rank and wealth, who was my companion, should be invaded by famine, hardship, and disease? Better die at once--better plunge a poinard in her bosom, still untouched by drear adversity, and then again sheathe it in my own! But, no; in times of misery we must fight against our destinies, and strive not to be overcome by them. I would not yield, but to the last gasp resolutely defended my dear ones against sorrow and pain; and if I were vanquished at last, it should not be ingloriously. I stood in the gap, resisting the enemy--the impalpable, invisible foe, who had so long besieged us--as yet he had made no breach: it must be my care that he should not, secretly undermining, burst up within the very threshold of the temple of love, at whose altar I daily sacrificed. The hunger of Death was now stung more sharply by the diminution of his food: or was it that before, the survivors being many, the dead were less eagerly counted? Now each life was a gem, each human breathing form of far, O! far more worth than subtlest imagery of sculptured stone; and the daily, nay, hourly decrease visible in our numbers, visited the heart with sickening misery. This summer extinguished our hopes, the vessel of society was wrecked, and the shattered raft, which carried the few survivors over the sea of misery, was riven and tempest tost. Man existed by twos and threes; man, the individual who might sleep, and wake, and perform the animal functions; but man, in himself weak, yet more powerful in congregated numbers than wind or ocean; man, the queller of the elements, the lord of created nature, the peer of demi-gods, existed no longer.|$|E
