40|$|Rechargeable lithium sulfur (Li-S) {{batteries}} are potentially safe, environmentally friendly and economical alternative energy storage systems that can potentially {{be combined with}} renewable sources including wind solar and wave energy. Sulfur has a high theoretical specific capacity of ~ 1680 mAh/g, attainable through the reversible redox reaction denoted as S 8 + 16 Li ↔ 8 Li¬ 2 S, which yields an average cell voltage of ~ 2. 2 V. However, two detrimental factors prevent {{the achievement of the}} full potential of the Li-S batteries. First, the poor electrical/ionic conductivity of elemental sulfur and Li 2 S severely hampers the utilization of active material. Second, dissolution of intermediate long-chain polysulfides (Li 2 Sn, 2 <n< 7) into the electrolyte and their shuttle between cathode and anode lead to fast capacity degradation and low Coulombic efficiency. As a result of this shuttle process, insoluble and insulating Li 2 S/Li 2 S 2 precipitate on the surface of electrodes causing loss of active material and rendering the electrode surface electrochemically inactive. Extensive research efforts have been devoted to overcome the aforementioned problems, such as combination of sulfur with conductive polymers, and encapsulation or coating of elemental sulfur in different nanostructured carbonaceous materials. Noteworthy, sulfur-polyacrylonitrile (SPAN) composites, wherein sulfur is chemically bond to the polymer backbone and PAN acts as a conducting matrix, have shown some success in suppressing the shuttle effect. However, due to the limited electrical conductivity of polyacrylonitrile, the capacity retention and rate performance of the SPAN systems are still very modest, which shows only 67 % retention of the initial capacity after 50 cycles for the binary system. Recently, graphene has been intensively investigated for enhancing the rate and cycling performance of lithium sulfur batteries. Graphene, which has a two-dimensional, one-atom-thick nanosheet structure, offers extraordinary electronic, thermal and mechanical properties. Herein, a sulfur-polyacrylonitrile/reduced graphene oxide (SPAN/RGO) composite with unique electrochemical properties was <b>prepared.</b> <b>PAN</b> is deposited on the surface of RGO sheets followed by ball milling with sulfur and heat treatment. Infrared spectroscopy and microscopy studies indicate that the composite consists of RGO decorated with SPAN particles of 100 nm average size. The PAN/RGO composite shows good overall electrochemical performance when used in Li/S batteries. It exhibits ~ 85 % retention of the initial reversible capacity of 1467 mAh/g over 100 cycles at a constant current rate of 0. 1 C and retains 1100 mAh/g after 200 cycles. In addition, the composite displays excellent Coulombic efficiency and rate capability, delivering up to 828 mAh/g reversible capacity at 2 C. The improved performance stems from composition and structure of the composite, wherein RGO renders a robust electron transport framework and PAN acts as sulfur/polysulfide absorber...|$|E

40|$|The {{production}} of activated carbons (ACs) involves two main steps: the carbonization of the carbonaceous {{of raw materials}} at temperatures below 1073 K {{in the absence of}} oxygen and the activation had realized at the temperature up to 1173 but the most useful temperature at 1073 K. In our study we used the most common industrial and consumer solid waste, namely PET, alone or blended with other synthetic polymer PAN. By mixing the two polymers in different ratios, an improvement of the yield of the AC production was found and some textural properties were enhanced by comparison with the AC prepared using each polymer separately. When all the samples were exposed through the carbonization process with a pyrolysis the mixture of PAN-PET (1 : 1 w/w) yield around 31. 9 %, between that obtained with PET (16. 9 %) or PAN (42. 6 %) separately. The combine activation, with CO 2 at 1073 K, allow ACs with a lower burn-off degree isothermally, when compared with those attained with PET or PAN alone, but with similarly chemicals or textural properties. The resultant ACs are microporous in their nature, as the activation time increase, the PET-PAN mixture AC are characterized by a better developed porous structure, when associated with the AC <b>prepared</b> from <b>PAN.</b> The AC <b>prepared</b> from PET-PAN mixture are characterized by basic surface characteristics, with a pHpzc around 10. 5, which is an important characteristic for future applications on acidic pollutants removals from liquid or gaseous phase.

The adsorbents <b>prepared</b> from <b>PAN</b> fibres presents an IR spectrum with similar characteristics to those obtained with PET wastes, but with fewer peaks and bands with less intensity, in particular for the PAN- 8240 sample. This can be reflected by the stretching and deformation modes of NH bond in the range 3100 – 3300 cm- 1 and 1520 – 1650 cm- 1, respectively. Also, stretching mode associated to C–N, C=N, can contributed to the profile of IR spectrum around 1170 cm- 1, 1585 – 1770 cm- 1. And the TGA methods was used to study the loses of the precursors mass according to the excessive of the temperature.

PET degradation started at 650 K, but at 1073 K, it has lost 80 % of the initial mass.
