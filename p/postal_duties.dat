Scott Specialized Catalogue of United States Stamps and Covers {{establishes}} the release date with the first known use of this issue, March 24, 1856. The first issue of this stamp was in imperforate form, engraved and printed by Toppan, Carpenter, Casilear & Co. The Jefferson issue saw <b>postal</b> <b>duty</b> from the spring of 1856 to the summer of 1857. The engraving of Jefferson was modeled after {{a portrait of the}} President by Gilbert Stuart. By mid-1857 the stamps were issued with the top and bottom design projections omitted and with perforations. This printing was issued in at least six major color variations.|$|R
2500|$|The First Washington postage stamp. The 5-cent Franklin and the 10-cent Washington {{postage stamps}} issued in 1847 {{were the first}} postage stamps issued and {{authorized}} for nationwide <b>postal</b> <b>duty</b> by the U.S. Post Office. The firm of Rawdon, Wright, Hatch, and Edson of New York City were given a four-year contract to print the first U.S. postage stamps in 1847. The initials: [...] "RWH" [...] are clearly engraved {{at the bottom of}} both stamps. The engraving of Washington is identical to the one by the portrait engraver Asher Brown Durand on a Bank-Note issued by Fairfield County Bank of Connecticut, during a period when many banks issued their own forms of paper currency. Both the Washington and Franklin issues were reprinted in 1875 from re-engraved images subtly different from the originals.|$|R
6000|$|Reader, {{what more}} need we add--except that Miss Stivergill's will did {{eventually}} become law, because {{it happened to}} correspond with the wishes of all concerned. It is due, also, to Solomon Flint to record that after his long life of faithful service in the Post-Office he retired on a small but comfortable pension, and joined the [...] "Rosebud Colony," [...] as Pax styled it, taking his grandmother along with him. That remarkable piece of antiquity, when last seen by a credible witness, was basking in the sunshine under a rustic porch covered with honeysuckle, more wrinkled, more dried-up, more tough, more amiable--especially to her cat--and more stooped in the previous century than ever. Mr Bright, the energetic sorter, who visits Solomon whenever his <b>postal</b> <b>duties</b> will allow, expresses his belief that the old lady will live to see them all out, and Mr Bright's opinion carries weight with it; besides which, Phil Maylands and May Aspel with her husband are more than half inclined to agree with him.

25|$|On April 25, 1938, the Post Office {{issued a}} green 1-cent George Washington stamp. It {{was the first}} stamp of the Presidential Issue of 1938, an issue that placed all of the {{deceased}} presidents in numerical order and thus represented a break with the long-standing tradition of reserving the normal letter-rate definitive stamp for Washington. Instead, this Washington issue saw <b>postal</b> <b>duty</b> carrying postcards and letters through the late 1950s. The 1938 Presidential Issue was Franklin Roosevelt's idea. An avid stamp collector, Roosevelt suggested a set of stamps that would {{pay tribute to the}} various past American presidents. In 1937, after much debate, a new definitive series was issued using Roosevelt's ideas. A national contest was held, with over 1200 entries submitted, the entry of a young New York City art student, Elaine Rawlinson, was chosen for the Washington stamp design.|$|R
