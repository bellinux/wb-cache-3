5|$|REL intends {{ultimately}} {{to operate as}} a for-profit commercial enterprise which, upon the completion of development, shall manufacture Skylon vehicles for multiple international customers who shall operate their fleets directly, while being provided with support from REL. Skylon has been designed with the target of achieving no less than 200 flights per vehicle. According to the company, its business plan is to sell vehicles for $1 billion each, for which it has forecast a market for at least 30 Skylons, while recurring costs of just $10 million per flight are predicted to be incurred by operators. While the REL intends to manufacture some components directly, such as the engine <b>precooler,</b> other components have been designed by partner companies and a consortium of various aerospace firms is expected to handle full production of Skylon.|$|E
5|$|The SABRE engine design aims {{to avoid}} the {{historic}} weight-performance issue by {{using some of the}} liquid hydrogen fuel to cool helium within a closed-cycle <b>precooler,</b> which quickly reduces the temperature of the air at the inlet. The air is then used for combustion in a similar manner to a conventional jet engine; once the helium has left the pre-cooler, it is further heated by the products of the pre-burner, giving it enough energy to drive the turbine and the liquid hydrogen pump. As a consequence of the air being cooled at all speeds, the jet can be built of light alloys and the weight is roughly halved. Additionally, more fuel can be burnt at high speeds. Beyond Mach5.5, the air would normally become unusably hot despite the cooling; accordingly, the air inlet is closed upon attaining this speed and the engine instead is solely fed via on-board liquid oxygen and hydrogen fuel, as in a traditional rocket.|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{examine the}} effects of <b>precooling</b> skin and core {{temperature}} on a 70 second cycling power test performed in a warm and humid environment (29 degrees C, 80 % relative humidity). METHODS: Thirteen male national and international level representative cyclists (mean (SD) age 24. 1 (4. 1) years; height 181. 5 (6. 2) cm; weight 75. 5 (6. 4) kg; maximal oxygen uptake (VO 2 peak) 66. 1 (7. 0) ml/kg/min) were tested in random order after either 30 minutes of <b>precooling</b> using cold water immersion or under control conditions (no <b>precooling).</b> Tests were separated by a minimum of two days. The protocol consisted of a 10 minute warm up at 60 % of VO 2 peak followed by three minutes of stretching. This was immediately followed by the 70 second power test which was performed on a standard road bicycle equipped with 172. 5 mm powermeter cranks and mounted on a stationary ergometer. RESULTS: Mean power output for the 70 second performance test after <b>precooling</b> was significantly (p< 0. 005) increased by 3. 3 (2. 7) % from 581 (57) W to 603 (60) W. <b>Precooling</b> also significantly (p< 0. 05) decreased core, mean body, and upper and lower body skin temperature; however, by the start of the performance test, lower body skin temperature was no different from control. After <b>precooling,</b> heart rate was also significantly lower than control throughout the warm up (p< 0. 05). Ratings of perceived exertion were significantly higher than the control condition {{at the start of the}} warm up after <b>precooling,</b> but lower than the control condition by the end of the warm up (p< 0. 05). No differences in blood lactate concentration were detected between conditions.

An experiment was performed to compare thermal strain and gross efficiency following whole body or partial body cooling. Eight well-trained participants performed 40 min of 60 % V·O 2 max cycling exercise in a 30 °C, 70 % relative humidity climatic chamber after four different <b>precooling</b> sessions in a water perfused suit: N (no <b>precooling),</b> CC (45 min whole body <b>precooling),</b> WC (45 min lower body <b>precooling),</b> and CW (45 min upper body <b>precooling).</b> The uncooled body part was warmed {{in such a way that}} the core temperature did not differ from that in session N. Gross efficiency was used to compare performance between the sessions since it indicates how much oxygen is needed for a certain external load.

40|$|Background Exercise {{increases}} {{core body}} temperature (Tc), which {{is necessary to}} optimise physiological processes. However, excessive increase in Tc may impair performance and places participants at risk {{for the development of}} heat-related illnesses. Cooling is an effective strategy to attenuate the increase in Tc. This meta-analysis compares the effects of cooling before (<b>precooling)</b> and during exercise (percooling) on performance and physiological outcomes. Methods A computerised literature search, citation tracking and hand search were performed up to May 2013. 28 studies met the inclusion criteria, which were trials that examined the effects of cooling strategies on exercise performance in men, while exercise was performed in the heat (> 30 °C). 20 studies used <b>precooling,</b> while 8 studies used percooling. Results The overall effect of <b>precooling</b> and percooling interventions on exercise performance was + 6. 7 ± 0. 9 % (effect size (ES) = 0. 43). We found a comparable effect (p= 0. 82) of <b>precooling</b> (+ 5. 7 ± 1. 0 % (ES= 0. 44)) and percooling (+ 9. 9 ± 1. 9 % (ES= 0. 40)) to improve exercise performance. A lower finishing Tc was found in <b>precooling</b> (38. 9 °C) compared with control condition (39. 1 °C, p= 0. 03), while Tc was comparable between conditions in percooling studies.

50|$|At {{the front}} of the engine, a simple {{translating}} axisymmetric shock cone inlet slows the air to subsonic speeds using two shock reflections. Part of the air then passes through a <b>precooler</b> into the central core, with the remainder passing directly through a ring of bypass ramjets. The central core of SABRE behind the <b>precooler</b> uses a turbo-compressor run off the same gaseous helium loop Brayton cycle which compresses the air and feeds it into four high pressure combined cycle rocket engine combustion chambers.

50|$|The key {{design feature}} for the Scimitar engines is the <b>precooler,</b> {{which is a}} heat {{exchanger}} that transfers {{the heat from the}} incoming air into the hydrogen fuel.

40|$|As the {{worldwide}} energy consumption continues to grow, {{natural gas and}} especially LNG are expected to keep contributing significantly with this growth.

In this work, a technical comparison between different <b>precooling</b> cycles for LNG processes is carried out through computational simulations using Aspen HYSYS&# 174;. The aim is to provide future project developments with a clear idea of the technical advantages/disadvantages involved in the selection of the process for the <b>precooling</b> cycle in LNG processes. The <b>precooling</b> circuit is treated as a stand-alone cycle first and then implemented in an entire liquefaction process; the propane <b>precooled</b> mixed refrigerant (C 3 MR) and the mixed fluid cascade (MFC&# 174;) processes are used for this purpose. The parameters studied are essentially coefficient of performance (&# 946;), heat exchanger UA value, compressor power, suction volumetric flow and pressure ratio. Two cases, cold (6 &# 176;C) and warm (25 &# 176;C) climate conditions are considered for each study. A three stage propane <b>precooled</b> process was found to be the most energetically efficient among the studied cases, even better than a two stage mixed refrigerant process (C 2 /C 3) for both climate conditions; however, the performance in terms of energy consumption is not the only parameter taken into account and therefore a selection chart is provided. Under warm climate conditions a propane <b>precooling</b> circuit showed to be the most recommended process. For cold climates, however, a two stage mixed refrigerant cycle reaching ca. - 50 &# 176;C is the preferred alternative, since in this case the low ambient temperature gives the propane <b>precooled</b> process a low share in the entire process. Other cases, such as a single stage mixed refrigerant cycle and a mixed refrigerant including n-Butane are taken into account. Based on the obtained results, a new, highly efficient configuration for natural gas liquefaction has been suggested, it is to be implemented in relatively warm climate conditions. It consists of a MFC&# 174; process with modifications in the liquefaction cycle and a propane <b>precooling</b> instead of the mixed refrigerant circuit; no previous reference in the open literature was found for such arrangement. </p...|$|R

Nine amateur trained runners completed 5 km treadmill time trials in the heat (32 °C, 60 % RH) under four conditions; no intervention (CON), <b>precooling</b> (PC), short-term heat acclimation (5 days - HA) and short-term heat acclimation with <b>precooling</b> (HA+PC).

This equated to the following improvements versus CON; PC - 3. 7 %, HA - 6. 6 % and HA+PC - 7. 0 %. Statistical differences were only observed between HA and CON (p= 0. 004, d= 0. 68, 95 % CI [- 0. 27, 1. 63]) however, similar effect sizes were observed for HA+PC vs CON (d= 0. 70, 95 % CI [- 0. 25, 1. 65]), with smaller effects between PC vs CON (d= 0. 34, 95 % CI [- 0. 59, 1. 27]), HA vs PC (d= 0. 33, 95 % CI [- 0. 60, 1. 26]) and HA+PC vs PC (d= 0. 36, 95 % CI [- 0. 57, 1. 29]).

40|$|Background: <b>Precooling</b> is {{a popular}} {{strategy}} used to combat the debilitating effects of heat-stress-induced fatigue and extend {{the period in which}} an individual can tolerate a heat-gaining environment. Interest in <b>precooling</b> prior to sporting activity has increased over the past three decades, with options including the application (external) and ingestion (internal) of cold modalities including air, water and/or ice, separately or in combination, immediately prior to exercise. Although many studies have observed improvements in exercise capacity or performance following <b>precooling,</b> some strategies are more logistically challenging than others, and thus are often impractical for use in competition or field settings. Objective: The purpose of this article was to comprehensively evaluate the established <b>precooling</b> literature, which addresses the application of cooling strategies that are likely to enhance field-based sports performance, while discussing the practical and logistical issues associated with these methods. We undertook a narrative examination that focused on the practical and event-specific application of <b>precooling</b> and its effect on physiological parameters and performance. Data sources: Relevant <b>precooling</b> literature was located through the PubMed database with second- and third-order reference lists manually cross matched for relevant journal articles.

Study selection: Relevant studies were included on the basis of conforming to strict criteria, including the following: (i) cooling was conducted before exercise; (ii) cooling was conducted during the performance task in a manner that was potentially achievable during sports competition; (iii) a measure of athletic performance was assessed; (iv) subjects included were able bodied, and free of diseases or disorders that would affect thermoregulation; (v) subjects were endurance-trained humans (maximal oxygen uptake [V ˙ O 2 max] 3 ̆e 50 ml/kg/min for endurance protocols); (vi) cooling was not performed on already hyperthermic subjects that were in immediate danger of heat-related illnesses or had received passive heating treatments; (vii) drink ingestion protocols were used for the intended purpose of benefiting thermoregulation as a result of beverage temperature; and (viii) investigations employed ≥ six subjects. Initial searches yielded 161 studies, but 106 were discarded on failing to meet the established criteria. This final summary evaluated 74 <b>precooling</b> treatments, across 55 studies employing well trained subjects. Study appraisal and synthesis methods: Key physiological and performance information from each study was extracted and presented, and includes respective subject characteristics, detailed <b>precooling</b> methods, exercise protocols, environmental conditions, along with physiological and performance outcomes. Data were presented in comparison to respective control treatments. For studies that include more than one treatment intervention, the comparative results between each <b>precooling</b> treatment were also presented. The practical benefits and limitations of employing each strategy in the field and in relation to sports performance were summarized. Results: Clear evidence of the benefits for a range of <b>precooling</b> strategies undertaken in the laboratory setting exists, which suggest that these strategies could be employed by athletes who compete in hot environmental conditions to improve exercise safety, reduce their perceived thermal stress and improve sports performance. Limitations: This review did not include a systematic assessment of the study quality rating and provided a subjective assessment of the pooled outcomes of studies, which range in <b>precooling</b> methodologies and exercise outcomes. The wide range of research designs, <b>precooling</b> methods, environmental conditions and exercise protocols make it difficult to integrate all the available research into single findings. Conclusion: Most laboratory studies have shown improvements in exercise performance following <b>precooling</b> and the emergence of strategies that are practically relevant to the field setting now allow scientists to individualize relevant strategies for teams and individuals at competition locations. Future research is warranted to investigate the effectiveness of practical <b>precooling</b> strategies in competition or field setting...|$|R
