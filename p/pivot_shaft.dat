50|$|A pin is {{a device}} used for {{fastening}} objects or material together. Pins often have two components: a long body and sharp tip made of steel, or occasionally copper or brass, {{and a larger}} head often made of plastic. The sharpened body penetrates the material, while the larger head provides a driving surface. It is formed by drawing out a thin wire, sharpening the tip, and adding a head. Nails are related, but are typically larger. In machines and engineering, pins are commonly used as <b>pivots,</b> hinges, <b>shafts,</b> jigs, and fixtures to locate or hold parts.|$|R

40|$|The {{invention}} {{provides a}} propulsion {{system based on}} "thuniform" movement of a foil member to achieve desired directional movement of a vehicle such as an unmanned submarine type of vessel. A pair of foil members are mounted to the vehicle body for reciprocating oscillating movement {{towards and away from}} each other, creating forward movement due to the compression of a fluid medium between the foil members and the expulsion of the compressed fluid rearwardly of the foil members. Each foil member is mounted to a <b>pivot</b> <b>shaft</b> for limited rotational movement with respect to the vehicle body. Damping means are connected between each <b>pivot</b> <b>shaft</b> and its associated foil member so that during operation of the propulsion system damping torque will offset hydrodynamic loads imposed on the foil members by the fluid medium. The damping means will in turn control the pitch angle of the foil members during operation, meaning that a thrust is generated for rigid foil members when moving at zero forward speed. The propulsion system of the invention exhibits increased efficiency and thrust in comparison to other such propulsion systems. The foil members are mounted to the vehicle body in such a manner that the thrust vector thereof can be directed through a full 360 degrees relative to the vehicle, thereby achieving superb maneuverability when the vehicle is provided with sets of the thrusters suitable located thereon.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} work is to develop more accurate calculating method of the efficiency of a half toroidal CVT. Previous analysis does not consider the bulk deformation of the CVT components. However, the bulk deformation of the CVT components is not negligible to predict {{the efficiency of the}} unit. For example, the half-contact angle between the power roller and disks is changed due to the deformation of these components at the high contact load. Therefore, it is important to establish more accurate calculating method of efficiency considering the bulk deformation for the high performance CVT unit, that is compact, highly efficient, and provides high-torque capability. This paper describes the analytical method to calculate the efficiency of the CVT taking the deformation into consideration. Firstly, the analysis of the efficiency on the traction surface considering deformation of the trunnion is shown. Secondly, the loss of power roller considering the deformation of <b>pivot</b> <b>shaft</b> is calculated. Finally, the total efficiency of the CVT variator (CVT unit) is shown using the new method...|$|E

40|$|Furling {{automatic}} {{system is a}} system that uses a combination of gravity and wind speed. This system can avoid the wind turbine damage from high wind speeds. Furling {{automatic system}} work based on wind speed, if wind speed exceeds the maximum limit the automatic furling system will work with moving the surface of the blade against the wind direction, so the result the blade surface area (A) which deal with the direction the wind is making wind turbine moves vertical or horizontal. This system uses two methods, vertical system method is by using the hinge spring mounted in the turbine body that moves up and down, when the wind speed exceeds the maximum limit then the system will slow movement of the blade, and method of the horizontal system where using the simple hinge mounted at the tail <b>pivot</b> (<b>shaft</b> tail), when wind speed exceeds the maximum limit the turbine will move horizontally, so that will slow the blade rotation. Furling automatic system has not been widely used in wind turbine, so that its development has not been so widespread, especially in Indonesia which is currently developing wind turbine technology for alternative energy. Benefits of use this system can prevent wind turbine damage caused by excessive wind speeds. Technology used in this system is very efficient because it does not require a complicated design. This system also functions as a controller of the blade rotation rate caused wind speed and used in small-scale wind turbines horizontal axis type. One of the standard horizontal wind turbine blade from the USA is the NREL (National Renewable Energy Laboratory, USA) consists of 25 airfoil design. Selection of the blade type based on blade length and power generators that will be used. This design has been developed since 1984.

40|$|Testing and {{validation}} of flight hardware in ground-based facilities {{can result in}} significant cost savings and risk reduction. We designed a relative motion emulator for aerospace vehicles using omni-directional mobile bases which provide large 3 degree-of-freedom motion, while Stewart platforms mounted atop these bases allow superposition of limited 6 degree-of-freedom motion. This paper addresses the design {{and implementation of the}} omni-directional mobile base. Each omni-directional base uses a trio of active split offset castor drive modules to provide smooth, holonomic, precise control of its motion. Three encoders on each castor, three optical mice sensors, and a 3 -axis inertial measurement unit provide full feedback information to a kinematics based control law. We built a one-third scale prototype to demonstrate design feasibility and for use in testing and development of data fusion techniques, control laws, and a dynamics model of the full-scale platform.

50|$|The final {{development}} of the Velocette KTT, the Mk VIII KTT was introduced in 1938 at that year's Earls Court Show, {{and was the first}} motorcycle to use the now-conventional swinging-arm rear fork with a shock absorber unit (in this case, an oleo-pneumatic unit built by the Oleo Strut Co. of England). The rear suspension system was designed by Veloce development engineer Harold Willis, and was inspired by the Oleo strut landing gear on the DeHavilland Hornet he borrowed at the Midland Aero Club, while his beloved DeHavilland 'Moth' was undergoing repair. Contact with the Oleo company led to several pairs of air shocks built for Veloce in 1936, for which the factory's racing rigid-frame racers (similar to the Mark VII KTT) were adapted with a swinging-fork rear end and bolt-on subframe for the seat. The experimental first swinging-arms used an adapted steering head lug turned sideways, with the cup-and-cone bearings retained. Production Mark VIII KTTs used a more conventional bronze bush and trunnion <b>shaft</b> <b>pivot</b> for the one-piece rear fork. The first experimental swing-arm machines were raced by the factory in the 1937 season, and introduced as the Mark VIII KTT the next year, for sale to the public.|$|R
40|$|It is {{difficult}} for dirt bike riders to keep their feet in full contact with the foot pegs on their bikes at all times when riding. The foot pegs that come factory and aftermarket today are universally static and non-rotational which prevent the ability for maximum contact to be maintained. During various riding positions, a rider’s foot can partially become disconnected from the peg allowing for a potential loss of control and balance/stability. The solution devised was a set of pegs that {{have the ability to}} rotate with the rider’s foot. The rotational ability of the pegs allow for the rider’s feet to stay in full contact throughout various riding positions or conditions. The pivoting peg that allows for full contact with the pegs provides more stability and control over the bike, which improves capabilities of balance and speed/momentum. To accomplish the <b>pivoting,</b> a round <b>shaft</b> with limiting stops was created to rotate fifteen degrees forward and backwards on the bike. Based on the design concept that was created and calculations that were done on the design, such as deflection and load bearing calculations, these pegs will easily support the weight of a 185 pound rider, while still having the capability to rotate without binding. More testing of these pegs is scheduled for spring quarter 2015. From the calculations that were prepared, the pegs will pivot 15 degrees and support the minimum weight requirement of 185 pounds...|$|R
