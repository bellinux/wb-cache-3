5|$|Comparisons {{between the}} scleral rings of pterosaurs and modern birds and {{reptiles}} {{have been used}} to infer daily activity patterns of pterosaurs. The pterosaur genera Pterodactylus, Scaphognathus, and Tupuxuara have been inferred to be diurnal, Ctenochasma, Pterodaustro, and Rhamphorhynchus have been inferred to be nocturnal, and Tapejara has been inferred to be cathemeral, being active throughout the day for short intervals. As a result, the possibly fish-eating Ctenochasma and Rhamphorhynchus may have had similar activity <b>patterns</b> <b>to</b> modern nocturnal seabirds, and the filter-feeding Pterodaustro may have had similar activity <b>patterns</b> <b>to</b> modern anseriform birds that feed at night. The differences between activity patterns of the Solnhofen pterosaurs Ctenochasma, Rhamphorhynchus, Scaphognathus, and Pterodactylus may also indicate niche partitioning between these genera.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Software design {{patterns}} document the most recommended solutions to recurring design problems. Selection {{of the best}} design pattern in a given context involves analysis of available alternatives, which is a knowledge-intensive task. Pattern knowledge overload (due to {{the large number of}} {{design patterns}}) makes such analysis difficult. A knowledge base to generate available alternatives can alleviate the problem. In this paper, we propose a pattern-oriented knowledge model which considers four dimensions of the pattern knowledge space: <b>Pattern</b> <b>to</b> Tactic relationship, <b>Pattern</b> <b>to</b> <b>Pattern</b> relationship, <b>Pattern</b> <b>to</b> Quality-attribute relationship and <b>Pattern</b> <b>to</b> Application-type relationship. We perform analysis of these relationships for patterns in the two popular patter...|$|R

5|$|Additionally, {{several studies}} have also {{utilized}} oligonucleotide usage <b>patterns</b> <b>to</b> identify the differences across diverse microbial communities. Examples of such methodologies include the dinucleotide relative abundance approach by Willner et al. and the HabiSign approach of Ghosh et al. This latter study also indicated that differences in tetranucleotide usage patterns {{can be used to}} identify genes (or metagenomic reads) originating from specific habitats. Additionally some methods as TriageTools or Compareads detect similar reads between two read sets. The similarity measure they apply on reads is based on a number of identical words of length k shared by pairs of reads.|$|E

5|$|Low-energy {{electron}} diffraction (LEED) is {{a method}} of bombarding a crystalline material with a collimated beam of electrons and then observing the resulting diffraction <b>patterns</b> <b>to</b> determine {{the structure of the}} material. The required energy of the electrons is typically in the range 20–200eV. The reflection high-energy electron diffraction (RHEED) technique uses the reflection of a beam of electrons fired at various low angles to characterize the surface of crystalline materials. The beam energy is typically in the range 8–20keV and the angle of incidence is 1–4°.|$|E

The ability to vary reflectivity to different wavelengths of light could also lead to efficient optical switches that could function like transistors, enabling engineers to make fast optical computers and routers.|$|E

5|$|The first {{published}} reports of A-DNA X-ray diffraction patterns—and also B-DNA—used analyses based on Patterson transforms that provided {{only a limited}} amount of structural information for oriented fibers of DNA. An alternative analysis was then proposed by Wilkins et al., in 1953, for the in vivo B-DNA X-ray diffraction-scattering patterns of highly hydrated DNA fibers in terms of squares of Bessel functions. In the same journal, James Watson and Francis Crick presented their molecular modeling analysis of the DNA X-ray diffraction <b>patterns</b> <b>to</b> suggest that the structure was a double-helix.|$|E

5|$|Alan Turing, {{and later}} the {{mathematical}} biologist James Murray, described a mechanism that spontaneously creates spotted or striped patterns: a reaction-diffusion system. The cells of a young organism have genes that can be switched on by a chemical signal, a morphogen, resulting {{in the growth of}} a certain type of structure, say a darkly pigmented patch of skin. If the morphogen is present everywhere, the result is an even pigmentation, as in a black leopard. But if it is unevenly distributed, spots or stripes can result. Turing suggested that there could be feedback control of the production of the morphogen itself. This could cause continuous fluctuations in the amount of morphogen as it diffused around the body. A second mechanism is needed to create standing wave <b>patterns</b> (<b>to</b> result in spots or stripes): an inhibitor chemical that switches off production of the morphogen, and that itself diffuses through the body more quickly than the morphogen, resulting in an activator-inhibitor scheme. The Belousov–Zhabotinsky reaction is a non-biological example of this kind of scheme, a chemical oscillator.|$|E
5|$|As a {{side effect}} of the {{electrochemical}} processes used by neurons for signaling, brain tissue generates electric fields when it is active. When large numbers of neurons show synchronized activity, the electric fields that they generate can be large enough to detect outside the skull, using electroencephalography (EEG) or magnetoencephalography (MEG). EEG recordings, along with recordings made from electrodes implanted inside the brains of animals such as rats, show that the brain of a living animal is constantly active, even during sleep. Each part of the brain shows a mixture of rhythmic and nonrhythmic activity, which may vary according to behavioral state. In mammals, the cerebral cortex tends to show large slow delta waves during sleep, faster alpha waves when the animal is awake but inattentive, and chaotic-looking irregular activity when the animal is actively engaged in a task. During an epileptic seizure, the brain's inhibitory control mechanisms fail to function and electrical activity rises to pathological levels, producing EEG traces that show large wave and spike patterns not seen in a healthy brain. Relating these population-level <b>patterns</b> <b>to</b> the computational functions of individual neurons is a major focus of current research in neurophysiology.|$|E
5|$|Being cold-blooded, frogs have {{to adopt}} {{suitable}} behaviour <b>patterns</b> <b>to</b> regulate their temperature. To warm up, {{they can move}} into the sun or onto a warm surface; if they overheat, they can move into the shade or adopt a stance that exposes the minimum area of skin to the air. This posture {{is also used to}} prevent water loss and involves the frog squatting close to the substrate with its hands and feet tucked under its chin and body. The colour of a frog's skin is used for thermoregulation. In cool damp conditions, the colour will be darker than on a hot dry day. The grey foam-nest tree frog (Chiromantis xerampelina) is even able to turn white to minimize the chance of overheating.|$|E
