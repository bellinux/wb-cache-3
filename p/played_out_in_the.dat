5|$|Overtime, {{traditional}} Calvinism played {{less of a}} role {{in shaping}} the church's doctrines and practices—it was influenced by Arminianism and revivalism early in the 19th century, liberal theology late in the 19th century, and neo-orthodoxy by the mid-20th century. The theological tensions within the denomination were <b>played</b> <b>out</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Fundamentalist–Modernist Controversy of the 1920s and 1930s, a conflict that {{led to the development of}} Christian fundamentalism and has historical importance to modern American Evangelicalism.

5|$|The mill site in Billerica was {{not without}} some controversy. The dam, which had been {{constructed}} in the 1790s to provide water for the Middlesex Canal, was believed {{by some to be}} responsible for the flooding of fields upstream as far as Sudbury. There were calls to remove the dam, as well as legal action, which Talbot vigorously resisted. The dispute was partly <b>played</b> <b>out</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> state legislature, and brought Talbot to the attention of political leaders as a potential candidate for office. Talbot also opposed plans developed by the city of Boston to divert waters of the Sudbury River (a major tributary of the Concord River) for its water supply.|$|E

25|$|The 2nd century BC saw {{a revival}} of temple architecture, {{including}} peripteral temples. This is partially due {{to the influence of}} the architect Hermogenes of Priene, who redefined the principles of Ionic temple construction both practically and through theoretical work. At the same time, the rulers of the various Hellenistic kingdoms provided copious financial resources. Their self-aggrandisation, rivalry, desires to stabilise their spheres of influence, as well as the increasing conflict with Rome (partially <b>played</b> <b>out</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> field of culture), combined to release much energy into the revival of complex Greek temple architecture.

25|$|By 1964, in {{the face}} of the superiority of tractors, the {{breeding}} of the heavy warmblood had completely collapsed. Stallions covered 10% of the mares that they had 20 years before. This scene <b>played</b> <b>out</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 1950s and 60's throughout German horse breeding. During this time, though, increasing leisure time meant that horses soon found their modern cultural niche: recreational riding. The breeders of Ostfriesland aimed to develop their horses along this path, producing a lighter riding horse with all the economical traits that had made them popular before. Fearing that the Thoroughbred would detract from the amenable nature of their horses, the Ostfriesen breeders chose to use Arabian blood instead. Beginning in 1948, such stallions were made available to the breeders, who scarcely used them, being hard-put to change their beloved horses so drastically. However, the evidence was convincing, as the Freisen-Arabs were horses of excellent character, great capacity and riding quality. Unfortunately, they had missed the mark: the market demanded a light, elegant, but tall riding horses, and the Freisen-Arabs were smaller than their warmblood mothers. Limited in their competitiveness in dressage and jumping, the Freisen-Arabs did not sell, and the Ostfriesen horses seemed doomed to extinction.|$|E

During this time he contributed {{to the development of}} the Monte Carlo method, which allowed solutions to complicated problems to be approximated using random numbers. His algorithm for simulating a fair coin with a biased coin is used in the [...] "software whitening" [...] stage of some hardware random number generators. Because using lists of [...] "truly" [...] random numbers was extremely slow, von Neumann developed a form of making pseudorandom numbers, using the middle-square method. Though this method has been criticized as crude, von Neumann was aware of this: he justified it as being faster than any other method at his disposal, writing that [...] "Anyone who considers arithmetical methods of producing random digits is, of course, in a state of sin." [...] Von Neumann also noted that when this method went awry it did so obviously, unlike other methods which could be subtly incorrect.|$|E

500|$|Psychodrama is {{an action}} method, {{often used as}} a psychotherapy, in which clients use {{spontaneous}} dramatization, role playing, and dramatic self-presentation to investigate and gain insight into their lives. [...] Developed by Jacob L. Moreno, psychodrama includes elements of theater, often conducted on a stage, or a space {{that serves as a}} stage area, where props can be used. [...] A psychodrama therapy group, under the direction of a licensed psychodramatist, reenacts real-life, past situations (or inner mental processes), acting them out in present time. Participants then have the opportunity to evaluate their behavior, reflect on how the past incident is getting <b>played</b> <b>out</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> present and more deeply understand particular situations in their lives. [...] Psychodrama offers a creative way for an individual or group to explore and solve personal problems. It may be used in a variety of clinical and community-based settings, and is most often utilized in a group setting, in which the members of the group serve as therapeutic agents for one another in the enacted drama. [...] Psychodrama is not, however, a form of group therapy, and is instead an individual psychotherapy that is executed from within a group. There are [...] "side-benefits" [...] that the other group members may experience, as they make relevant connections and insights to their own lives from the psychodrama of another. A psychodrama is best conducted and produced by a person trained in the method, called a psychodrama director.|$|E
500|$|For feminists, a woman's {{right to}} control her own {{sexuality}} is a key issue. Feminists such as Catharine MacKinnon argue that women have very little {{control over their own}} bodies, with female sexuality being largely controlled and defined by men in patriarchal societies. Feminists argue that sexual violence committed by men is often rooted in ideologies of male sexual entitlement, and that these systems grant women very few legitimate options to refuse sexual advances. In many cultures, men do not believe that a woman has the right to reject a man's sexual advances or to make an autonomous decision about participating in sex. Feminists argue that all cultures are, in one way or another, dominated by ideologies that largely deny women the right to decide how to express their sexuality, because men under patriarchy feel entitled to define sex on their own terms. This entitlement can take different forms, depending on the culture. In many parts of the world, especially in conservative and religious cultures, marriage is regarded as an institution which requires a wife to be sexually available at all times, virtually without limit; thus, forcing or coercing sex on a wife is not considered a crime or even an abusive behaviour. In more liberal cultures, this entitlement {{takes the form of a}} general [...] sexualization of the whole culture. This is <b>played</b> <b>out</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> sexual objectification of women, with pornography and other forms of sexual entertainment creating the fantasy that all women exist solely for men's sexual pleasure, and that women are readily available and desiring to engage in sex at any time, with any man, on a man's terms.|$|E
500|$|Greg Edmonson {{composed}} the musical {{score for the}} series. He stated that he wrote for the emotion of the moment. However, one reviewer averred that he also wrote for the characters, stating: [...] "Edmonson has developed a specialized collection of musical symbolism for the series". To help illustrate the collection, the reviewer gave key leitmotifs, or [...] "signatures", various names, noting that [...] "Serenity" [...] recalls {{the theme of the}} show and is used when they return to the ship, or when they were meeting clandestinely; it was [...] "the sound of their home". The slide guitar and fiddle used in this piece are portable instruments which fit the lifestyle of the crew: [...] "the music they make calls up tunes <b>played</b> <b>out</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> open, by people who were hundreds of miles away yesterday. 'Serenity' conjures the nomadic lifestyle the crew leads and underlines the western aspect of the show." [...] Another emotional signature was [...] "Sad Violin". It was used {{at the end of the}} Battle of Serenity Valley, but also helped set up the joke for when Mal tells Simon that Kaylee is dead in the episode [...] "Serenity". The most memorable use of [...] "Sad Violin", however, is at the end of [...] "The Message", when the crew mourned the death of Tracey. This was also the last scene of the last episode the actors shot, and so this was seen by them, and Edmonson, as Firefly farewell. To denote impending danger, [...] "Peril" [...] was used, which is [...] "a low pulse, like a heartbeat, with deep chimes and low strings". The reviewer also noted character signatures. The criminal Niska has his own signature: Eastern European or Middle Eastern melodies over a low drone. Simon and River's signature was a piano played sparsely with a violin in the background. This is in contrast to the portable instruments of [...] "Serenity": the piano is an instrument that cannot be easily moved and evokes the image of [...] "the distant house and family they both long for". The various signatures were mostly established in the first pilot, [...] "Serenity", and helped enhance the narrative.|$|E
