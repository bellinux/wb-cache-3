The author describes long-term care in Czechoslovakia before 1989 in order to confirm or refute the validity of path dependence theory; she uses Sigrid Leitner's typology. Then she pinpoints the role of informal caregivers in the Czech Republic and Slovakia and afterwards she draws a comparison between them. The comparative analysis is based on given criteria, it especially focuses on informal caregivers' rights and obligations.

40|$|MSc., Faculty of Science, University of the Witwatersrand, 2011 Granitoid {{intrusions}} {{are numerous}} in southwestern Rajasthan and are useful {{because they can}} provide geochronological constraints on tectonic activity and geodynamic conditions operating {{as the time of}} intrusion, as well as information about deeper crustal sources. The particularly voluminous Neoproterozoic felsic magmatism in the Sirohi region of Rajasthan is of particular interest as it may have implications for supercontinental (Rodinia and Gondwana) geometry. The Mt. Abu granitoid pluton is located between two major felsic suites, the older (870 - 800 Ma) Erinpura granite and the younger (751 - 771 Ma) Malani Igneous Suite (MIS). The Erinpura granite is syn- to lateorogenic and formed during the Delhi orogeny, while the MIS is classified as alkaline, anorogenic and either rift- or plume-related. This tectonic setting is contentious, as recent authors have proposed formation within an Andean-type arc setting. The Mt. Abu granitoid pluton has been mapped as partly Erinpura (deformed textural variant) and partly younger MIS (undeformed massive pink granite). As the tectonic settings of the two terranes are not compatible, confusion arises as to the classification of the Mt. Abu granitoid pluton. Poorly-constrained Rb-Sr age dating place the age of formation anywhere between 735 ± 15 and 800 ± 50 Ma. The older age is taken as evidence that the Mt. Abu intrusion was either a late phase of the Erinpura granite. However, U-Pb zircon geochronology clearly indicates that the Mt. Abu felsic pluton is not related to- or contiguous with- the Erinpura granite suite. The major results from this study indicate that the all textural variants within the Mt. Abu pluton were formed coevally at 765 Ma. Samples of massive pink granite, mafic-foliated granite and augen gneiss from the pluton were dated using U-Pb zircon ID-TIMS at 766. 0 ± 4. 3 Ma, 763. 2 ± 2. 7 Ma and 767. 7 ± 2. 3 Ma, respectively. The simple Mt. Abu pluton is considered as an enriched intermediate I- to A-type intrusion. They are not anorogenic A-types, as, although these felsic rocks have high overall alkali and incompatible element enrichment, no phase in the Mt. Abu pluton contains alkali rich amphibole or pyroxene, nor do REE diagrams for the most enriched samples show the gull-wing shape typical of highly evolved alkaline phases. The alkali-enriched magma may be explained by partial melting of a crustal source such as the high-K metaigneous (andesite) one suggested by Roberts & Clemens (1993), not derivation from a mantle-derived mafic magma. The fairly restricted composition of Mt. Abu granitoids suggests that partial melting and a degree of assimilation/mixing may have been the major factors affecting the evolution of this granitoid pluton; fractional crystallization was not the major control on evolution of these granitoids. Revdar Rd. granitoids that are similar in outcrop appearance and petrography to Mt. Abu granitoids also conform to Mt. Abu granitoids geochemically and are classified as part of the Mt. Abu felsic pluton. Mt. Abu samples from this study have a maximum age range of 760. 5 - 770 Ma, placing the Mt. Abu pluton within the time limits of the Malani Igneous Suite (MIS) as well as 750 Ma granitoids from the Seychelles. Ages of the Sindreth-Punagarh Groups are also similar. These mafic-ultramafic volcanics are thought to be remnants of an ophiolitic mélange within a back-arc basin setting at 750 - 770 Ma. The three Indian terranes are spatially and temporally contiguous. The same contiguity in space and time has been demonstrated by robust paleomagnetic data for the Seychelles and MIS. These similarities imply formation within a common geological event, the proposed Andean-type arc (Ashwal et al., 2002) on the western outboard of Rodinia. The implications are that peninsular India did not become a coherent entity until after this Neoproterozoic magmatism; Rodinia was not a static supercontinent that was completely amalgamated by 750 Ma, as subduction was occurring here simultaneous with rifting elsewhere. Pageiv The Mt. Abu pluton has undergone deformation, with much of the pluton having foliated or augen gneiss textures. The timing of some of the deformation, particularly the augen gneiss and shear zone deformation, is thought to have occurred during intrusion. The Mt. Abu and Erinpura granitoids have experienced a common regional metamorphic event, as hornblende (Mt. Abu) and biotite (Erinpura) give 40 Ar/ 39 Ar ages of 508. 7 ± 4. 4 Ma and 515. 7 ± 4. 5 Ma, respectively. This event may have reactivated older deformatory trends as well. The temperature of resetting of argon in hornblende coincides with temperatures experienced during upper-greenschist to lower-amphibolite facies metamorphism. These late Pan-African ages are the first such ages reported for the Sirohi region and southern part of the Aravalli mountain range. They offer evidence for the extension of Pan-African amalgamation tectonics (evidence from southern India) into NW India. The age of formation of the Erinpura augen gneiss magma is 880. 5 ± 2. 1 Ma, thus placing the Erinpura granitoids within the age limits of the Delhi orogeny (900 - 800 Ma; Bhushan, 1995). Most deformation observed here would have been caused by compression during intrusion. The Erinpura granitoids are S-type granitoids due to their predominantly peraluminous nature, restricted SiO 2 -content, normative corundum and the presence of Al-rich muscovite and sillimanite in the mode. Weathered argillaceous metasedimentary material may also have been incorporated in this magma, while the presence of inherited cores suggests relatively lower temperatures of formation for these granitoids as compared to the Mt. Abu granitoids. The age of inheritance (1971 ± 23 Ma) in the Erinpura augen gneiss is taken as the age of the source component, which coincides with Aravalli SG formation. The Sumerpur granitoids differ from the Erinpura granitoids in terms of macroscopic and microscopic texture (undeformed, rarely megaporphyritic) but conform geochemically to the Erinpura granitoid characteristics and may thus be related to the Erinpura granitoid suite. The Revdar Rd. granitoids that are similar in macroscopic appearance to Erinpura granitoids also conform geochemically, and may similarly belong to the Erinpura granite suite. A Revdar Rd. mylonite gneiss with the Erinpura granitoids’ geochemical signature was dated at 841 Ma, which does not conform to the age of the type-locality Erinpura augen gneiss dated here, but later intrusion within the same event cannot be ruled out because of the uncertainty in the age data (21 Ma). The presence of garnet in one Revdar Rd. (Erinpura-type) sample implies generation of these granitoids at depth and/or entrainment from the source, similar to the S-type Erinpura granitoids. The Ranakpur granitoids differ significantly from both the Erinpura and Mt. Abu intrusives due to their low SiO 2 -content and steep REE profiles (garnet present in the source magma); they are thought to have been generated under higher pressures from a more primitive source. The deeper <b>pressure</b> <b>of</b> <b>generation</b> is confirmed by the absence of a negative Eu-anomaly. The Ranakpur quartz syenite dated at 848. 1 ± 7. 1 Ma is younger by 30 m. y. than the Erinpura augen gneiss. It is within the same time range as numerous other granitoids from this region as well as the Revdar Rd. granitoid dated in this study. The prevalence of 830 - 840 Ma ages may indicate that a major tectonic event occurred at this time. The Ranakpur quartz syenite may have been generated near a subduction or collision zone, where thickened crust allows for magma generation at depth. The deeply developed Nb-anomaly in the spider diagram also implies a larger subduction component to the magma. The Swarupganj Rd. monzogranite is interpreted to have formed by high degrees of partial melting from a depleted crustal source and is dissimilar to other granitoids from this study. More sampling, geochemical and geochronological work {{needs to be done in}} order to characterize this intrusion. Pagev The Kishengarh nepheline syenite gneiss is situated in the North Delhi Fold Belt and is the oldest sample dated within this study. The deformation in this sample is due to arc- or continental- collision during a Grenvillian-type orogeny related to the amalgamation of the Rodinia supercontinent (and peninsular India), dated by the highly reset zircons at 990 Ma. This is considered a DARC (deformed alkaline rock and carbonatite) and represents a suture zone (Leelanandam et al., 2006). The primary age of formation of this DARC is older than 1365 ± 99 Ma, which is the age of xenocrystic titanites from the sample. The granitoid rocks from this study area (Sirohi region) range widely in outcrop appearance, petrography and geochemistry. Granitoids from the Sirohi region dated in this study show a range of meaningful ages that represent geological events occurring at 880 Ma, 844 Ma, 817 Ma, 789 Ma, 765 Ma and 511 Ma. Granitoid magmatism (age of formation) in this region is predominantly Neoproterozoic, and the number of events associated with each granitoid intrusion as well as diverse tectonic settings implies a complexity in the South Delhi Fold Belt that is not matched by the conventional and simplified view of a progression from collision and orogeny during Grenvillian times (Rodinia formation), through late orogenic events, to anorogenic, within-plate (rift-related) alkaline magmatism during Rodinia dispersal. Instead, it is envisaged that convergence and subduction during the formation of Rodinia occurred at 1 Ga (Kishengarh nepheline syenite deformation), with a transition to continental-continental collision at 880 - 840 Ma (Erinpura and Ranakpur granitoids). This was then followed by far-field Mt. Abu and MIS magmatism, related to a renewed period of subduction at 770 Ma. The last deformatory event to affect this region was that associated with the formation of Gondwana in the late Pan-African (510 Ma) ...|$|E

METHOD: Pharyngeal pressures from 40 young, healthy individuals (mean age = 25. 8 years, gender equally distributed) were recorded at 3 locations: oropharynx, hypopharynx, and upper esophageal sphincter (UES), during normal control and tongue-hold swallows. Measures of peak amplitude, duration, and slope <b>of</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>generation</b> were subjected to statistical analysis. RESULTS: Tongue-hold swallows produced lower pharyngeal peak pressure and shorter pharyngeal pressure durations compared to control swallows. Further, tongue-hold swallows produced lower UES relaxation pressures. Between sensors, peak pressure was lower and pressure slopes were steeper in the hypopharynx compared to the oropharynx. Several gender-specific differences were found for pharyngeal peak pressure, pressure duration, and pressure slopes.

40|$|BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Under {{physiological}} loads, debonded cemented femoral stems {{have been}} shown to move within their cement mantle and generate a fluid pump that may facilitate peri-prosthetic osteolysis by pressurizing fluid and circulating wear debris. The long-term physiological loading of rough and polished tapered stems in vitro has shown differences in performance, with greater interface pressures generated by the rough stems. In this study we investigated the individual effects of stem surface finish, degree of mantle wear, and mode of loading on the stem pump mechanism. METHOD: Rough and polished stems were loaded under different regimes in artificially worn cement mantles that permitted either 2 or 5 degrees of rotational stem movement, and the interface pressures were compared. RESULTS: The pressures generated by the rough and polished stems were similar in either type of mantle. The pattern <b>of</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>generation</b> in the 2 -degree mantles was similar to the pressures generated by rough stems after long-term loading, but the high posterior wall pressures fell and the tip pressures increased in the 5 -degree mantles.

40|$|AbstractThe {{tried and}} tested multianvil {{apparatus}} has been widely used for high-pressure and high-temperature experimental studies in Earth science. As a result, many important results have been obtained for {{a better understanding of}} the components, structure and evolution of the Earth. Due to the strength limitation of materials, the attainable multianvil pressure is generally limited to about 30  GPa (corresponding to about 900  km of the depth in the Earth) when tungsten carbide cubes are adopted as second-stage anvils. Compared with tungsten carbide, the sintered diamond is a much harder material. The sintered diamond cubes were introduced as second-stage anvils in a 6 – 8 type multianvil apparatus in the 1980 s, which largely enhanced the capacity <b>of</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>generation</b> in a large volume press. With the development of material synthesis and processing techniques, a large sintered diamond cube (14  mm) is now available.

40|$|The goal of {{this study}} is to develop an {{efficient}} numerical algorithm applicable to a wide range of compressible multicomponent flows. Although many highly efficient algorithms have been proposed for simulating some particular special cases of such flows, a construction of universal solvers is known to be challenging. Extreme cases, such as incompressible and highly compressible flows, or inviscid and viscous flows, require different numerical treatments in order to maintain efficiency, stability, and accuracy of the method. Linearized block implicit (LBI) factored schemes are known to provide an efficient way of solving the compressible Navier-Stokes equations implicitly, which allows avoiding stability restrictions at low Mach number and high viscosity. However, their splitting error has been shown to grow as the Mach number goes to zero and dominate physical fluxes. In this paper, a splitting error reduction technique is proposed to solve the issue. A novel finite element shock-capturing algorithm, proposed by Guermond and Popov, is reformulated in terms of finite differences, extended to the stiffened gas equation of state (SG EOS) and combined with the LBI factored scheme to stabilize the method around flow discontinuities at high Mach numbers. A novel stabilization term is proposed for low Mach number applications. The resulting algorithm is shown to be efficient in both low and high Mach number regimes. The algorithm is further extended to the multicomponent case using an interface capturing strategy with surface tension as a continuous surface force.

We have shown that the <b>pressure</b> <b>of</b> the shock wave applied to the target is 5 to 10 greater in confined geometry than in direct ablation. We have also studied the dielectric breakdown, which is the main limit to the confinement technique. This technique <b>of</b> <b>generation</b> <b>of</b> shock waves provides peak pressure up to 10 GPa and have various applications in metallurgic surface treatment and surgery...|$|R
5000|$|General Electric built ten uprated U25Cs in 1965. Facing the {{competitive}} <b>pressure</b> <b>of</b> the second <b>generation</b> horsepower race GE built these units with increased horsepower. The Alco C628 had more horsepower and the Alco C630 was already announced that Summer. General Motors had the EMD SD40 demonstrators working on several railroads. The increase in unit horsepower was happening that year. The uprated units were built for three railroads {{that were already}} operating the U25C. The first uprated units were built for the Northern Pacific between May and July 1965. These were NP #2518-2520 and were rated at 2750 horsepower. Three more uprated U25Cs were built as Atlantic Coast Line #3011-3013 in December 1965. The ACL units were rated at 2800 horsepower. The last four uprated U25Cs were rated at 2800 horsepower and were built for the Pennsylvania Railroad in December 1965. These were PRR #6516-6519. Six additional PRR U25Cs were uprated to 2800 horsepower: 6500-6503, 6510-6511. In early 1966 General Electric began offering the 2800 horsepower U28C. A total of 28 look-a-like U28Cs were built between February 1966 and July 1966 as Chicago Burlington and Quincy #562-577 and Northern Pacific #2800-2811.|$|R

40|$|Relief ducts {{fitted to}} venting {{openings}} {{is a widespread}} configuration in the industrial practice. The presence of a duct {{has been reported to}} severely increase the violence of the vented explosion posing a problem for the proper design of the venting device. Several studies have reported the leading importance - in the whole complex explosion phenomenology - of a secondary explosion in the duct. Modern approaches in the study of simply vented explosions (without ducts) have focused on the study of the interaction between internal and external explosion as a key issue in the mechanisms <b>of</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>generation.</b> The issue is even more relevant when a duct is fitted to the vent due the confined nature of the external explosion. In this work the interaction between internal and external events is experimentally investigated for gas explosions vented through a relief duct. The work has aimed at studying mechanisms underlying the <b>pressure</b> rise <b>of</b> this venting configuration. The study has put the emphasis on the mutual nature of the interaction. A larger scale than laboratory has been investigated allowing drawing results with a greater degree of generality with respect to data so far presented in literature. © 2007 Elsevier B. V.

40|$|Manufacturing {{industry}} is under permanent pressure {{to maintain its}} economic growth and profitability as strong societal backbone. At the same time <b>pressures</b> <b>of</b> waste <b>generation</b> and resource consumption are increasing as result of manufacturing operations. Since manufacturing {{industry is}} one of the major consumers of natural resources it is therefore essential to reduce dependency on natural resources by decoupling economic growth from consumption. Resource efficiency approaches can improve the performance of production systems by reducing resource losses. However, the fundamental assumption at the basis of resource efficiency approaches is that resources are available infinitely. As a consequence, challenges of sustainability and resource scarcity remain inadequately addressed. The objective of this research is to develop analysis methods and decision support tools for manufacturing industry to facilitate its transition from linear production systems to circular manufacturing systems, which are economically viable and environmentally sustainable. The initial scope of study focuses on industrial resource efficiency assessment in production systems. Expanding the view to a manufacturing system perspective, the current research is explored with regard to circular manufacturing systems in the context of economic benefits, resource scarcity and waste generation. Systematic analysis methods and decision support tools are developed for industrial companies to facilitate the adaption of circular manufacturing systems. These developments are supported by industrial case studies. The analysis methods are to the largest extent based on agent-based simulation approaches. The tools are capable of assessing the economic and environmental impact of different business models, design strategies as well as supply chains settings. Moreover, the tools are able to determine whether introductions of new (circular) business models will be adopted by customers. One empirical market study is performed to investigate value propositions of a circular business approaches based on customer decisions. QC 20170825 </p...|$|R
40|$|In 1964 Bloembergen and Shen {{predicted}} that Raman gain could be suppressed if {{the rates of}} phonon creation and annihilation (by inelastic scattering) exactly balance. This is only possible if the momentum required for each process is identical, i. e., phonon coherence waves created by pump-to-Stokes scattering are identical to those annihilated in pump-to-anti-Stokes scattering. In bulk gas cells, this can only be achieved over limited interaction lengths at an oblique angle to the pump axis. Here we report a simple system that provides dramatic Raman gain suppression over long collinear path lengths in hydrogen. It consists of a gas-filled hollow-core photonic crystal fiber whose zero dispersion point is pressure adjusted to lie close to the pump laser wavelength. At a certain precise <b>pressure,</b> stimulated <b>generation</b> <b>of</b> Stokes light in the fundamental mode is completely suppressed, allowing other much weaker phenomena such as spontaneous Raman scattering to be explored at high pump powers...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} {{a study of}} fracture formation in low permeability rocks induced by <b>generation</b> <b>of</b> fluid or gas during chemical reaction. In nature, primary migration of hydrocarbons, i. e. <b>generation</b> <b>of</b> oil and gas from tight source rock and its expulsion to more permeable reservoirs, is driven by formation of microfractures in the heated organic-rich shale. The tomographic 3 D imaging of the rocks samples during heating showed that micro-cracks develop in the shale due to internal pore <b>pressure</b> build-up. <b>Generation</b> <b>of</b> hydrocarbons drives fracture formation until a drainage network sufficient for expulsion is developed. Experiments were also conducted on analogue material, where gelatine was fractured during fermentation of yeast and sugar. Studies of the gel confined in Hele-Shaw cell showed that CO 2 generation leads to formation of a drainage network which topology re{{presents a}} new class of networks, intermediate between hierarchical fracture pattern and river network. When CO 2 escapes via fracture network, individual cracks open and close in intermittent manner. The variation of fracture opening in time exhibits a universal frequency distribution with 1 /f and 1 /f 2 noise. These results have implication for understanding how the generated fluids escape from hydraulic fractures. The methods can be applied in studying dehydration of sediments, formation of mud volcanoes, methane hydrate exploration and assessment, geological sequestration of carbon dioxide CO 2, hydraulic fracturing of unconventional reservoirs, hydrothermal energy...|$|R
