40|$|Stereolithography (SL) is a {{three-dimensional}} (3 D) computer controlled, manufacturing process that rasters an ultraviolet (UV) laser onto a photocurable resin during the fabrication of pre-defined polymeric prototypes. Ugobe, an Idaho-based company {{located within the}} Treasure Valley, has enlisted the New Product Development (NPD) Lab at Boise State University, to fabricate polymer prototypes via SL technology. Although part tolerances within onethousandth of an inch are required for Ugobe, the SL manufacturing process is not producing parts at the specified/desired tolerances. Upon fabrication, the <b>prototyped</b> <b>parts</b> are assembled into intelligent robotic life-forms; such as PLEO the dinosaur. The objective of this project {{is to create a}} Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for the NPD Lab that will: 1) reduce manufacturing variability, and 2) increase tolerance specification during the fabrication of Ugobe <b>prototyped</b> <b>parts.</b> Thus far, experiments have been conducted to determine how primary tolerance factors such as SLA dimensional accuracy, resolution mode, and post-processing techniques, affect <b>part</b> tolerances during <b>prototype</b> production. Calipers and an optical comparator were used to gather <b>prototype</b> <b>part</b> dimensions for this project. Conclusions resulting from data analysis will identify sources of error within the current NPD Lab prototype production SOP, as well as provide suggestions on how to improve their manufacturing process vai the reduction of manufacturing variability and increased <b>prototype</b> <b>part</b> tolerance predictability...|$|R

40|$|The {{automated}} {{fabrication of}} a <b>prototype</b> three-dimensional <b>part</b> from a three-dimensional drawing {{can be regarded}} as rapid prototyping. There are two basic types of rapid prototyping: subtractive fabrication and additive fabrication. Subtractive fabrication begins with a block of material that is larger than the object to be created and “sculpts” the block into the required <b>prototype</b> three-dimensional <b>part.</b> Additive fabrication continuously adds particles to an object until the desired object is created. Often this process builds a <b>prototype</b> three-dimensional <b>part</b> layer by layer. The <b>prototype</b> three-dimensional <b>parts</b> are created by particular rapid prototyping hardware. Telemanufacturing allows for the remote submission of three-dimensional drawings via a communication medium to the site where the rapid prototyping machine resides. The communication medium {{for the purposes of this}} dissertation is the Internet. After the three-dimensional drawing is submitted to the remote site, the rapid prototyping machine proceeds to create the <b>prototype</b> three-dimensional <b>part.</b> The aim of this research is to integrate a visual feedback system into the telemanufacturing environment. The visual feedback system allows a user at a remote location to view the progress of the manufacture of the <b>prototype</b> three-dimensional <b>part</b> in real time. This research also aims to integrate a software agent into the telemanufacturing environment. An agent is loosely defined as “one that acts for another”. The software agent discussed in this dissertation will analyze visual data obtained from the rapid prototyping environment, determine if the <b>prototype</b> three-dimensional <b>part</b> being created contains errors, and take the necessary action. The ultimate goal of this dissertation is to allow the visual analysis of a part as a rapid prototyping machine is creating it. This research allows for two approaches to this “visual analysis”: human analysis, and analysis by a software agent. The “visual analysis” will detect any errors that have occurred during the manufacturing process and ultimately result in the reduction of time and resources to create <b>prototype</b> three dimensional <b>parts</b> using telemanufacturing.

40|$|Rapid prototyping, {{though a}} {{relatively}} new discipline, {{has proven to be}} a valuable tool in the reduction of the time and cost associated with developing new products. The value of rapid prototyping shows the promise of increasing even further as it matures and offers higher quality parts, in less time, and for lower costs. Improvements in these areas are all addressed in current rapid prototyping research in various ways. This paper presents a method for greatly improving the geometric accuracy, and thus the overall quality, of rapid <b>prototype</b> <b>parts</b> by making use of 5 -axis machining. An algorithm is presented to generate the contoured edge slices for the rapid <b>prototype</b> <b>parts</b> in several levels of complexity. A simple algorithm is presented to generate a single edge contour for each section of the slice, and a more complex algorithm is also presented to allow for the 5 -axis machining of "sub-layers" within a slice.
