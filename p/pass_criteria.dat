40|$|Originally {{developed}} {{as a tool for}} patient-specific quality assurance in advanced treatment delivery methods to compare between measured and calculated dose distributions, the gamma index (γ) concept was later extended to compare between any two dose distributions. It takes into effect both the dose difference (DD) and distance-to-agreement (DTA) measurements in the comparison. Its strength lies in its capability to give a quantitative value for the analysis, unlike other methods. For every point on the reference curve, if {{there is at least one}} point in the evaluated curve that satisfies the <b>pass</b> <b>criteria</b> (e. g., δDD = 1 %, δDTA = 1 mm), the point is included in the quantitative score as "pass. " Gamma analysis does not account for the gradient of the evaluated curve - it looks at only the minimum gamma value, and if it is < 1, then the point passes, no matter what the gradient of evaluated curve is. In this work, an attempt has been made to present a derivative-based method for the identification of dose gradient. A mathematically derived reference profile (RP) representing the penumbral region of 6 MV 10 cm × 10 cm field was generated from an error function. A general test profile (GTP) was created from this RP by introducing 1 mm distance error and 1 % dose error at each point. This was considered as the first of the two evaluated curves. By its nature, this curve is a smooth curve and would satisfy the <b>pass</b> <b>criteria</b> for all points in it. The second evaluated profile was generated as a sawtooth test profile (STTP) which again would satisfy the <b>pass</b> <b>criteria</b> for every point on the RP. However, being a sawtooth curve, it is not a smooth one and would be obviously poor when compared with the smooth profile. Considering the smooth GTP as an acceptable profile when it passed the gamma <b>pass</b> <b>criteria</b> (1 % DD and 1 mm DTA) against the RP, the first and second order derivatives of the DDs (δD', δD") between these two curves were derived and used as the boundary values for evaluating the STTP against the RP. Even though the STTP passed the simple gamma <b>pass</b> <b>criteria,</b> it was found failing at many locations when the derivatives were used as the boundary values. The proposed derivative-based method can identify a noisy curve and can prove to be a useful tool for improving the sensitivity of the gamma index...|$|E
40|$|The {{present study}} {{examined}} the effect of stimulus number on two <b>pass</b> <b>criteria</b> in neonatal transient evoked otoacoustic emission (TEOAE) screening. Participants were 25 normal, full-term neonates (mean age = 2. 7 days, SD = 1. 3), with normal peripheral auditory function in both ears. The Otodynamics ILO 88 (Quickscreen) program was used and the TEOAE spectrum was analysed after the presentation of 10, 50, 100 and 260 stimuli. Two <b>pass</b> <b>criteria</b> were used: Criterion 1 - whole wave reproducibility (WWR) ≥ 60 %, and Criterion 2 - SNR ≥ 3 dB for all three frequency bands centered at 2. 4, 3. 2 and 4. 0 kHz.

Although the use of an initial minimum stimulus number of 50 in neonatal TEOAE screening is justified, clinicians should continue testing if necessary until a set of predetermined stopping criteria are satisfied. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E
40|$|Background Disinfectants with claimed {{activity}} against Clostridium difficile must {{be evaluated}} to ensure efficacy against the spores that comprise an environmental source of patient infection. Unfortunately there is, at present, no generally accepted method for evaluating these disinfectants. In {{the absence of}} such a method, laboratories have to adapt protocols that were not designed for products used in medical environments and consequently may use inappropriate test organisms, exposure times, and <b>pass</b> <b>criteria.</b> Aim To develop and evaluate a method for testing the activity of disinfectants against C. difficile spores using exposure times and <b>pass</b> <b>criteria</b> which are relevant to clinical application. Methods A Joint Working Party of the Healthcare Infection Society (HIS) and the Advisory Committee on Antimicrobial Resistance and Healthcare Associated Infections (ARHAI) of the Department of Health in England was assembled. The Working Party adapted a previously described enzyme-based method for spore purification (the Clospore method) using an exposure time of 5 min and a 5 log 10 kill as a pass criterion. Findings Evaluation of the method by three laboratories demonstrated that the method is simple to follow and that the results are repeatable and reproducible. Conclusion The method described by the Working Party produces a clean suspension with a high titre of spores. It is recommended that, for a disinfectant used in the environment, the product should demonstrate a 5 log 10 reduction in 5 min under clean or dirty conditions to fulfil the requirements of the test...|$|E

40|$|The {{results of}} {{transient}} evoked otoacoustic emissions (TEOAEs) {{have been found}} to be adversely affected by noise. However, there are few investigations into the specific effect of background noise on TEOAEs. The purpose of the present study was to determine the effects of increasing levels of speech babble and the recording method on TEOAEs using the ILO 88 Otodynamics instrumentation. Subjects were 30 normal-hearing adults (15 males and 15 females), aged between 18 and 32 years. TEOAE recordings were obtained from both ears of each subject under five different levels of speech babble delivered via a loudspeaker in sound field using both the default and Quickscreen methods of data collection. The results indicated that both the whole-wave reproducibility (WWR) and mean signal-to-noise ratio (MSNR), averaged across frequencies from about 2 to 4 kHz, decreased with increasing speech babble levels. The results also showed that the Quickscreen mode was less susceptible to noise than the default mode. The pass percentage, using either WWR≥ 50 percent or an MSNR≥ 3 dB as a <b>pass</b> <b>criterion,</b> also decreased with increasing speech babble levels. Furthermore, the findings indicated that the use of the WWR <b>pass</b> <b>criterion</b> resulted in a high failure rate under high levels of speech babble. In contrast, the MSNR <b>pass</b> <b>criterion</b> was robust to speech babble levels of up to 70 dBA in the Quickscreen mode and 65 dBA in the default setting. The clinical implications of these findings, as applied to non-sound-treated environments, are discussed. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
40|$|Background: Progressing from {{undergraduate}} education to post graduate training has been punctuated by a clinical examination {{which has not}} changed significantly in decades. This study investigated the feasibility of using a validated postgraduate assessment methodology in an undergraduate setting; The Toronto Patient Assessment & Management Exam (PAME). Methods: A standardised patient-centred multifaceted healthcare pathway examination consisting of 4 separate consecutive encounters was piloted in {{the final year of}} undergraduate training. The entire final year medical class was invited to participate. The final sample of 25 was selected on a consecutive, volunteer basis. Student’s experienced 2 standardised simulated cases; 1 medical, 1 surgical. Candidates were examined by 2 independent examiners (subject experts) and were ranked on a Global Rating Scale. Passing standard was set at 3 / 5 - ‘barely adequate for Intern/PGY 1 ’ but with the addition of second <b>pass</b> <b>criteria</b> of avoidance of an egregious error. Results: 23 students completed the examination. Two arrived late and were excluded. 21 / 23 demonstrated knowledge and skills at least at minimum expected standard. 18 / 23 avoided an egregious error. Subgroup analysis identified better performance in the assessment and management of the medical case and the review encounter (encounter 4) was the lowest scoring in both cases. The format was well received by students and examiners. Conclusion: The use of an alternative certification examination ‘ACE’ based on a postgraduate format ‘PAME’ in undergraduate setting appears feasible and discriminatory. Inclusion in the <b>pass</b> <b>criteria</b> of avoidance of egregious error appears to improve the specificity of the examination.

40|$|Summary-I. A {{consideration}} of methods for assessing contrast sensitivity {{leads to the}} conclusion that, for a clinical test, letters are more suitable than gratings. 2. A letter chart is described in which letters decrease in contrast but not in size. The letters are arranged in groups of three; successive groups decrease in contrast {{by a factor of}} IfJ 2 from a very high contrast down to a contrast below the threshold of normal observers. A subject's threshold is taken to be the lowest contrast for which at least two letters in a group are correctly reported. 3. A mathematical model of the observer and the chart-testing procedure has been used to predict how the accuracy and repeatability of the test score depend on the parameters of the chart and observer. This reveals that even a low probability of misreporting supra threshold letters will seriously bias the test score if the <b>passing</b> <b>criterion</b> is strict, requiring correct report of all letters in each group, but will have little effect if the <b>passing</b> <b>criterion</b> is less strict.

40|$|There {{is a lack}} of {{consensus}} regarding the appropriate criteria for releasing patients to return to sports (RTS) after anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction (ACLR). A test battery was developed to support decision-making. Twenty-eight patients (22 males and 6 females) {{with a mean age of}} 25. 4 +/- 8. 2 years participated and were 6. 5 +/- 1. 0 months post-ACLR. All patients followed the same rehabilitation protocol. The test battery used consisted of the following: isokinetic test, 3 hop tests and the jump-landing task assessed with the LESS. The isokinetic tests and single-leg hop tests were expressed as a LSI (involved limb/uninvolved limb x 100 %). In addition, patients filled out the IKDC and ACL-Return to Sport after Injury (ACL-RSI) scale. RTS <b>criteria</b> to <b>pass</b> were defined as a LSI > 90 % on isokinetic and hop tests, LESS 56 and a IKDC within 15 th percentile of healthy subjects. Two out of 28 patients <b>passed</b> all <b>criteria</b> of the test protocol. The <b>pass</b> <b>criterion</b> for the LESS 90 % for SLH, 85. 7 % for TLH and 50 % for the SH. For the isokinetic test, 39. 3 % of patients <b>passed</b> <b>criteria</b> for LSI peak torque quadriceps at 60 A degrees/s, 46. 4 % at 180 A degrees/s and 42. 9 at 300 A degrees/s.

There was suspicion that ferrets could detect the infrared light-emitting equipment used to monitor predator and prey behaviour. A two-alternative forced-choice operant procedure {{was used to test}} whether five pigmented male ferrets could detect infrared (870 and 920 nm) light. First, the ferrets were taught to press a lever under a lit visible (white) light emitting diode (LED) for food rewards. After up to 101 40 -minute sessions, each ferret could lever press under the lit-light at or above the <b>pass</b> <b>criteria</b> of 75 % responses over four consecutive (or five out of six) sessions. The same ferrets were then tested for stimulus generalisation over different stimulus properties by changing the wavelength/colour and intensity of the lit-light. The overall mean accuracy of each ferret's response to each coloured light varied between 92 % and 84 %. When a red light was systematically dimmed to halve the intensity nine times, all five ferrets still met the set <b>pass</b> <b>criteria</b> with overall accuracies of between 88 % and 78 %. This indicated that changing the properties of the light stimuli would not disrupt the ferrets' abilities to perform the learned task. This test was a necessary prerequisite before changing the light stimuli to potentially invisible wavelengths in the infrared spectrum. The light stimulus was changed to a single infrared (870) nm LED. Two of five ferrets showed strong evidence (response accuracies of 77 % 4 and 72 % 2) and one ferret showed weak evidence (60 % 3) that they could see the light at this wavelength. Extraneous cues such as ultrasound emitted at the onset of a stimulus light or a predictable schedule of reinforcement were eliminated as potential response cues. These tests helped to prove that the ferrets were using only the light stimulus to discriminate which stimulus was lit. It may be possible that at least some feral ferrets can detect the light produced from infrared monitoring equipment that emits light wavelengths at or below 870 nm. This has significant implications for conservation because infrared equipment is used by conservation agencies in New Zealand and overseas to monitor predator and prey behaviour in the wild. If the infrared lighting is detected by the subject being observed, then it may potentially influence the behaviour of the animal, or attract a predator towards threatened native species...|$|E

40|$|Introduction: Monte Carlo {{simulation}} {{is gradually}} being introduced for clinical dose computation {{in the quest}} to improve the accuracy of predicting the dose distribution to a medium from a given beam setup. Dosimetric measurement is used to verify {{the accuracy of the}} calculated dose distribution before the beam setup can be employed for therapeutic purpose. It is thus important to investigate the accuracy and time requirement of this dose calculation algorithm currently in use in the institution under different conditions. Methods: Dose calculations were made with a Monaco® Treatment Planning System which runs a Monte Carlo dose computation algorithm. Calculation times were investigated as functions of field sizes and chosen calculation uncertainty. Film measurements were made for each calculated dose distribution and both dose distributions were compared using OmniPro I’mRT software, which employs the gamma evaluation criteria for comparing two dose distributions. Results: Calculation time increased with increase in field size and with reduction in the calculation variance. The calculated dose distribution also concords more with the measured at small field sizes than at larger field sizes. At calculation uncertainty of 2 % and gamma evaluation criteria of 3 % and 3 mm for the dose difference and distance to agreement values respectively, 67 % calculated dose distribution passed the gamma analysis (gamma index > 95 %). The values are better with decrease in the chosen calculation uncertainty or relaxing the <b>pass</b> <b>criteria.</b> Conclusion: Calculation time as a function of variance appears to increase exponentially with decreasing variance and there appears to be little gain to use variance value lower than 1 % because the required increase in the computation time is not justified by the marginal improvement in the result...|$|E
