25|$|The VEF Riga has a three-element {{flat film}} plane lens. Performance could be improved, so the {{short-lived}} Minox II (1948-1951) {{had a new}} 5 element lens (called complan) whose final element would rest against the film itself when the <b>pressure</b> <b>plate</b> pushed the film onto the lens. Customers complained of film scratches with this new design, so most of these lenses were replaced by MINOX with the later curved-field compensating lens. Consequently, original 'film lens' Minox II are exceptional.|$|E
2500|$|For Riga Minox to Minox B, {{the film}} {{advances}} {{each time the}} camera is closed, regardless of whether a picture is taken or not. Opening the camera causes the <b>pressure</b> <b>plate</b> to press the film into a concave or flat (depending on the model) surface to stiffen thin emulsions for better clarity. When the camera is closed, the <b>pressure</b> <b>plate</b> moves back from the film plane, thus allowing the film strip to move freely {{to advance to the}} next frame. From Minox BL onward, the camera is equipped with a [...] "freewheeling" [...] mechanism, such that the film advances one frame only when a picture is taken, otherwise, closing the camera does not advance a frame.|$|E
2500|$|... 12 May: a British soldier, of the Royal Pioneer Corps dog unit, and his Labrador dog {{were killed}} when they {{triggered}} an IRA anti-personnel device on the Castleblaney Road. The IRA had partly hidden a massive landmine {{at the side of}} the road so that it would be discovered by the British Army. When the bomb disposal team arrived they defused the device and a follow-up search was carried out. The IRA had placed a <b>pressure</b> <b>plate</b> bomb nearby and it exploded when the soldier stepped on it during the follow-up operation.|$|E

2500|$|Each Hurst SC/Rambler came {{equipped}} with the [...] AMC V8 engine from the AMX. There were no factory options to this package. Standard clutch was a [...] with a three finger long-style Borg and Beck <b>pressure</b> <b>plate.</b> The 390 engine was mated to a manual transmission four-speed T-10 with close gear ratios. A Hurst shifter came with a large metal [...] "T" [...] handle. The rear end was an AMC 3.54:1 [...] "Twin-Grip" [...] limited slip differential using Dana internals, with outer wheel hubs attached through a spline and keyway system. The hub attachment method was the only weak point in the rear end assembly.|$|E
2500|$|At the {{beginning}} of episode 1 of the second series, 5 SCOTS and Kemp are ambushed by the Taliban within 30 minutes of his first patrol, targeted by small arms fire and RPG rockets, as well as mortars. Kemp is extricated to safety by crawling 50 metres along a ditch. In a later contact, after coming under fire, Kemp unwittingly ran into an area Kemp described as [...] "probably" [...] featuring the <b>pressure</b> <b>plate</b> devices used to detonate IEDs and mines, necessitating 30 steps back to the cleared area. During the filming for the second series, 100 metres from the crew a 22-year-old Royal Marine was fatally wounded by the explosion of a buried booby trap.|$|E

50|$|The TMA-1 and TMA-1A are circular, plastic cased Yugoslavian minimum metal {{anti-tank}} blast mine. The mine {{consists of}} an upper plastic <b>pressure</b> <b>plate,</b> and the lower body containing the main charge. The <b>pressure</b> <b>plate</b> has eight triangular raised sectors, and a central fuze cap. The <b>pressure</b> <b>plate</b> is {{held in place by}} four plastic pins, which when suffient pressure is applied, shear allowing the <b>pressure</b> <b>plate</b> to collapse onto the mine body, triggering the UANU-1 fuze. A secondary fuze well is provided in the base of the mine, allowing the use of anti-handling devices. The mine is found in Bosnia, Croatia and Kosovo.|$|E
50|$|The T-AB-1 is a {{rectangular}} plastic cased Brazilian anti-tank blast mine. The mine uses a T-AB-1 anti-personnel mine as a fuze. The AP mine is {{inserted into the}} body of the AT mine under a large stiff ABS plastic <b>pressure</b> <b>plate.</b> The <b>pressure</b> <b>plate</b> is fastened in place by a number of shear pins, which are designed to give way under a pressure of 200 kg. The AP mine under the <b>pressure</b> <b>plate</b> is then triggered, triggering the mine's main charge.|$|E

5000|$|The Type I mine had a {{cylindrical}} {{case with}} a domed upper <b>pressure</b> <b>plate</b> that is held above the main case of the mine by the spring-loaded central fuze well. A strip of canvas around the circumference seals {{the gap between the}} <b>pressure</b> <b>plate</b> and {{the main body of the}} mine. The Type II uses a smaller <b>pressure</b> <b>plate,</b> that does not cover the entire top surface of the mine, giving the center of the mine a raised appearance. In every other detail, the mines are identical.|$|E
50|$|Spring type - When no {{electricity}} {{is applied to}} the brake, a spring pushes against a <b>pressure</b> <b>plate,</b> squeezing the friction disk between the inner <b>pressure</b> <b>plate</b> and the outer cover plate. This frictional clamping force is transferred to the hub, which is mounted to a shaft.|$|E
50|$|An Elsie mine {{has a small}} raised <b>pressure</b> <b>plate</b> on the {{top surface}} of the mine which {{is covered with a}} small pad of flock material. The {{flocking}} material is designed to act as camouflage. Sustained downward pressure on the small <b>pressure</b> <b>plate</b> (by the victim's foot) cocks a spring-loaded striker. When the <b>pressure</b> <b>plate</b> has been pressed down approximately 2.5 cm, a single retaining ball bearing flips side-ways into a recess. When the ball bearing flips side-ways, it frees the striker (held under tension by a coiled spring beneath it) which snaps upwards into the stab detonator, thereby detonating the explosive charge.|$|E

50|$|The NV-41 was a wooden-cased Soviet {{anti-tank}} blast mine {{used during}} the Second World War. The mine consists of a square wooden box with a filling plug on the bottom. The top of the box is covered by a thin pressure lid, which covers a <b>pressure</b> <b>plate</b> held up by a spring. Sufficient pressure on the lid collapses it down onto the <b>pressure</b> <b>plate.</b> Downward movement of the <b>pressure</b> <b>plate</b> moves down a pressure plunger, which in turn levers up the striker retaining lever, releasing the spring-loaded striker and allowing it to impact the stab sensitive detonator, triggering the main charge.|$|E
5000|$|The T.Mi.Z.43 {{pressure}} fuze can {{be fitted}} to Tellermine 42s. The T.Mi.Z.43 fuze is notable for featuring an integral anti-handling device as standard: when the fuze is inserted and the <b>pressure</b> <b>plate</b> screwed down into place, it shears a weak arming pin in the fuze with an audible [...] "snap". This action arms the anti-handling device. Thereafter, {{any attempt to}} disarm the mine by unscrewing the <b>pressure</b> <b>plate</b> (to remove the fuze) will automatically trigger detonation.

40|$|In recent years, about 1000 slope {{failures}} occur {{every year}} in Japan, and about 90 % of them are superficial slope failures that occur within 3 meters from the surface. Therefore this research suggests a new natural method for the slope stability. It takes environment and landscape into consideration, and can prevent superficial slope failures from occurring. Reinforcement members used in this method are rock-bolts, unit-nets, and pressure-plates. And we tried to preserve existing trees as much as possible. The purpose {{of this research is}} to establish more accurately designed method, and so the shearing test by the model of 1 / 10 scale was conducted. We made a model ground with reinforcement materials in shearing box and made it sheared by automatic load machine. Then we measured shear load with loadcells measures shear load and strain gauges attached to rock-bolt and unit-net. In the past research, we made it clear how the change of the effect of diameter of <b>pressure</b> <b>plates</b> gave to reinforcement mechanism in this method on sandy soil ground. The result was that enlarging diameters of <b>pressure</b> <b>plates</b> increases reinforcement effect comprehensively in this method. Shearing test was carried out on cohesive soil ground in addition to sandy soil ground in this research, and we examined how the difference of the grain size made the effect to the reinforcement mechanisms. As a result, it was clarified that the depression effect of transformation became bigger as the diameters of <b>pressure</b> <b>plates</b> was longer also in the mixed soil ground...|$|R
