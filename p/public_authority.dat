5|$|The broad {{heading of}} {{illegality}} may {{be divided into}} two sub-headings. In the first case, the High Court inquires into whether the <b>public</b> <b>authority</b> was empowered to take a particular course of action or make a decision, and, in the other, whether it exercised its discretion wrongly even though it was empowered to act. Where the Court finds that the <b>public</b> <b>authority</b> had exceeded its jurisdiction or had exercised its discretion wrongly, it may invalidate the act or decision.|$|E

5|$|Illegality {{is one of}} {{the three}} broad {{headings}} of judicial review of administrative action in Singapore, the others being irrationality and procedural impropriety. To avoid acting illegally, an administrative body or <b>public</b> <b>authority</b> must correctly understand the law regulating its power to act and to make decisions, and give effect to it.|$|E

40|$|Social {{expenditure}} in {{this context}} refers to the consolidated expenditure of <b>public</b> <b>authorities</b> on education, health, housing and income maintenance. <b>Public</b> <b>authorities</b> comprise the Central Government (including extra-budgetary funds) and Local <b>Authorities.</b> <b>Public</b> corporations are excluded. A major obstacle in relating this expenditure {{to the growth of}} national output is the absence of an official classification of <b>public</b> <b>authorities</b> 2 ̆ 7 expenditure according to purpose of expenditure within the national income framework...|$|R
50|$|Financing public {{projects}} through <b>public</b> <b>authorities</b> is also attractive {{because their}} independent corporate structure theoretically {{makes them more}} flexible and efficient than state agencies. Many restrictions placed on state agencies {{do not apply to}} <b>public</b> <b>authorities,</b> including, for example, general public bidding requirements (some public bidding requirements do apply under the <b>Public</b> <b>Authorities</b> Law). See Plumbing, Heating, Piping & Air Conditioning Contr. Ass'n v. N.Y.S. Thruway Auth., 5 N.Y.2d 420 (1959). Most <b>public</b> <b>authorities</b> may also make contracts, and because of public authorities' corporate status, there is generally, no remedy against the state for the breach of such contracts. John Grace & Co. v. State University Constr. Fund, 44 N.Y.2d 84 (1978). Many <b>public</b> <b>authorities,</b> such as Industrial Development Agencies and the Empire State Development Corporation, can also condemn property.|$|R

5|$|A partial ouster or {{time limit}} clause {{specifies}} a restricted period, after which no remedy will be available. Such clauses are generally effective, unless the <b>public</b> <b>authority</b> has acted in bad faith. Similarly, {{the existence of}} bad faith entitles applicants to challenge decisions of authorities despite the existence of statutory provisions declaring such decisions to be conclusive evidence of certain facts. In the absence of bad faith, the courts will enforce conclusive evidence clauses.|$|E
5|$|A prohibiting order {{operates}} {{to prevent}} illegal action by a <b>public</b> <b>authority</b> from {{occurring in the}} first place. It may be granted by the High Court {{in cases where the}} applicant is aware that the authority is about to take an unlawful course of action, or to prevent the authority from repeating an unlawful act. Like a quashing order, a prohibiting order is used to help maintain good standards of public administration.|$|E

40|$|Social {{media has}} evolved along with {{expectations}} that organizations, including <b>public</b> <b>authorities,</b> would create more dialogue with citizens. This policy brief argues for, first, the importance for <b>public</b> <b>authorities</b> to listen to, {{follow up on}} and use social media users’ responses and viewpoints to facilitate dialogue and organizational learning, and, second, the need to more systematically reflect on the causes, meaning, and consequences of the informal tone that some <b>public</b> <b>authorities</b> have come to use in social media.

50|$|New York {{state public}} benefit {{corporations}} and authorities operate like quasi-private corporations, with {{boards of directors}} appointed by elected officials, overseeing both publicly operated and privately operated systems. <b>Public</b> <b>authorities</b> share characteristics with government agencies, but they are exempt from many state and local regulations. Of particular importance, they can issue their own debt, allowing them to bypass limits on state debt contained in the New York State Constitution. This allows <b>public</b> <b>authorities</b> to make potentially risky capital and infrastructure investments without directly putting the credit of New York State or its municipalities on the line. As a result, <b>public</b> <b>authorities</b> have become widely used for financing public works, and they are now responsible for more than 90% of the state's debt. The growing influence of <b>public</b> <b>authorities</b> over state and local financing, coupled with their ability to avoid regulations applicable to government agencies, has led to calls for reform. Some reforms were passed in the <b>Public</b> <b>Authorities</b> Accountability Act of 2005.|$|R
5|$|An ouster {{clause in}} a statute {{is an attempt}} by the {{legislature}} to prevent an act or decision by a <b>public</b> <b>authority</b> from being challenged before the courts. Such clauses thus serve as a signal to decision-makers that they may operate without fear of intervention by the courts at a later stage. One common kind of ouster clause is the total ouster or finality clause, which is inserted into a statute to indicate that the decision of a particular judge or tribunal is final and cannot be challenged by any court.|$|E
5|$|Article 12 of the Constitution of the Republic of Singapore {{guarantees}} to all persons equality {{before the law}} and {{equal protection of the}} law. The Article also identifies four forbidden classifications – religion, race, descent and place of birth – upon which Singapore citizens may not be discriminated for specific reasons. For example, discrimination on those classifications is prohibited in the appointment to any office or employment under a <b>public</b> <b>authority</b> or in the administration of any law relating to the establishing or carrying on of any trade, business, profession, vocation or employment.|$|E
5|$|It {{has been}} argued, however, that {{there exists a}} problem if a {{government}} minister simply needs to state that a national security interest {{is involved in a}} matter, upon which the rules of natural justice are immediately compromised. Thio Li-ann has commented that when important constitutional rights such as the freedom to religion are curtailed by legislation, it may be advisable for the court to impose a duty on a <b>public</b> <b>authority</b> to give reasons establishing that an order imposed by the authority is objectively valid.|$|E

5|$|It {{has been}} held in the UK that when a <b>public</b> <b>authority</b> {{exercises}} a statutory power {{for a number of}} purposes, some of which are unlawful, the applicable test for deciding whether the authority acted illegally is whether the unlawful purpose is incidental to the exercise of the power or if the dominant purpose is itself unlawful. If the primary or dominant purpose is the authorized purpose, the administrative action may be held valid.|$|E
5|$|The Royal Hotel in {{the area}} of Woodhill was {{designed}} and built to serve Brunel's railway line which finished a few steps away from the Hotel. The original building survives as The Royal Inn pub. It was built in 1830 by the Corporation of Bristol (now known as Bristol City Council) in order to provide a hotel supporting the development of the seaside resort. It is thought to be the only seaside hotel to be built by a <b>public</b> <b>authority</b> during the nineteenth century. It is a Grade II listed building.|$|E
5|$|The {{doctrine}} of legitimate expectation originates from common law principles of fairness. English courts developed this doctrine largely to encourage good administration and prevent abuses by decision-makers. Generally, the courts will grant {{judicial review of}} an administrative decision based on an individual's legitimate expectation if a <b>public</b> <b>authority</b> has made a representation to the individual within its powers. The individual has {{to show that the}} representation was a clear and unambiguous promise, an established practice or a public announcement. This is largely a factual inquiry.|$|E

5|$|The {{doctrine}} of standing prevents applicants from burdening {{the court with}} frivolous or vexatious claims. This minimizes disruption in the administrative process. When an administrative decision by a <b>public</b> <b>authority</b> is challenged, implementation of {{the decision by the}} authority may be delayed. Therefore, the courts want to restrict access to applicants who have a genuine interest in challenging the decision. Furthermore, since the courts' resources are limited, restricting access to genuine claims ensures that judicial resources are appropriately allocated.|$|E
5|$|Under {{the first}} sub-heading, a <b>public</b> <b>authority</b> will be {{considered}} as having acted illegally {{if there is no}} legal basis for the action carried out or the decision made (simple ultra vires), or, more specifically, if the authority has made an error concerning a jurisdictional or precedent fact. A precedent fact error is made when an authority comes to a conclusion in the absence of facts that must objectively exist, or in the presence of facts that must not exist, before it has the power to act or decide.|$|E
5|$|Unlike a total ouster or {{finality}} clause {{which seeks}} to preclude judicial review entirely, a partial ouster or time limit clause specifies a restricted period of time after which no remedy will be available. Such clauses are generally effective, unless the <b>public</b> <b>authority</b> has acted in bad faith, {{in which case the}} decision impugned may be subject to judicial review even though the time permitted for challenging it has lapsed.|$|E
50|$|The {{widespread}} use of <b>public</b> <b>authorities</b> in the United States was pioneered in New York state by Robert Moses. New York likely has the most extensive number of public-benefit corporations in the country. The approval of the New York State <b>Public</b> <b>Authorities</b> Control Board is required in some cases when creating an authority. An authority may at times levy taxes and tolls; this means {{that they are not}} part of the usual state budgetary process, and gives them a certain independence. Their most admired ability by the New York State and local government, is to circumvent strict public debt limits in the New York State Constitution. Furthermore, they may make contracts; because of public authorities' corporate status, there is generally no remedy against the chartering State for the breach of such contracts. On the other hand, as agents of the state, <b>public</b> <b>authorities</b> are not subject to many laws governing private corporations, and are not subject to municipal regulation. Employees of <b>public</b> <b>authorities</b> usually are not state employees, but are employees of the <b>authority.</b> <b>Public</b> <b>authorities</b> can also often condemn property.|$|R
