50|$|Reproductive {{coercion}} {{can take}} the form of birth control sabotage, either as verbal sabotage, behavioral sabotage, and/or acts as an active interference with contraceptive methods.

Partners can also forbid women from using family planning or force them to have sex without protection.|$|R
50|$|The {{early history}} of Hallsands is unknown, but a chapel has existed there since at least 1506.

50|$|Nanosponges are nano sized {{particles}} {{designed to}} look like red blood cell and protect the body. Nanoparticles {{have been used for}} unknown preventative measures, such as silverware and wound care products. Silverware contains small silver nanoparticles which contain an antimicrobial agent. Antimicrobial agents are able {{to prevent the spread of}} disease. When silverware was created that was not the intention of the silver product. In more recent years, many wound care products have been made with silver and other various nanoparticles. The universal use of silver in wound care products is mainly for the antimicrobial properties, which helps treat wounds of all severity. They are very minute particles used for a vast majority of things, one including healthcare. A specific type of nanoparticle seen recently in the healthcare field is a nanosponge. Nanosponges are nano sized particles {{designed to look}} like red blood cell and protect the body. They are also able to fight and prevent the spread of disease. Nanosponges target toxins, the toxins organize themselves to <b>poke</b> <b>holes</b> inside the red blood cell (nanosponge) membrane this method of <b>poking</b> <b>holes</b> is called pore-forming. After the toxins are attached to the nanosponge, it will lead to cell damage and cell death.|$|R

50|$|Seven {{ships of}} the Royal Navy {{have been named}} Warspite. The origins of the name are unclear, {{although}} it is probably from the Elizabethan spelling of the word 'spite' -- i.e. 'spight' -- in part embodying contempt for the Navy's enemies, but which was also the common name for the green woodpecker, suggesting the 'Warspight' would <b>poke</b> <b>holes</b> in enemy ships' (wooden) hulls.

The resultant sound can be heard on his highly influential 1958 instrumental, [...] "Rumble" [...] and Rawhide.|$|R

50|$|His {{approach}} {{worked well}} in the increasingly mature business world {{of the second half}} of the twentieth century.

He assumed that his readers were intelligent, rational, hardworking people of good will. If their organizations struggled, he believed it was usually because of outdated ideas, a narrow conception of problems, or internal misunderstandings.|$|R

50|$|Slash-and-burn and <b>poking</b> <b>holes</b> for {{planting}} seeds {{are the main}} technics of the traditional rotational shifting cultivation. On a piece of sloping agricultural land villagers often practice intercropping between different local varieties such as Khao Hay (local upland rice), Mac Duoi (sorghum), Mac Nga (sesame) and Xa Ly (corn). Presently, villagers in Ban Yang also grow Mac Thua Dao (Plukenetia volubilis) as a new crop introduced from outside. These crops are rotationally planted and mixed. A specific crop variety is often never fixed in a plot of farmland but is rotated through a shifting cultivation cycle of 3-4 years or longer.|$|R
