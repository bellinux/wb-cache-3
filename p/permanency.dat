5|$|Throughout the poems, the end {{becomes the}} {{beginning}} and things constantly repeat. This use of circular time {{is similar to the}} way Dante uses time in his Divine Comedy – Little Gidding ends with a rose garden image that {{is the same as the}} garden beginning Burnt Norton. The repetition of time affects memory and how one can travel through their own past to find <b>permanency</b> and the divine. Memory within the poem is similar to how St. Augustine discussed it, in that memory allows one to understand words and life. The only way to discover eternity is through memory, understanding the past, and transcending beyond time. Likewise, in the Augustinian view that Eliot shares, timeless words are connected to Christ as the Logos and how Christ calls upon mankind to join him in salvation.|$|E

Most RNs choose to sign short-term contracts that will allow for more flexibility to work overseas. Filipino nurses feel less committed to the hospitals as they are temporary staff members. This lack of attachment and minimal responsibility worsens the health of Filipino patients.|$|E

Over 3,000 women joined the Police Reserve, serving under Captain Mary Noonan, primarily to provide eyes and ears for the police, look out for children's safety, and give first aid if necessary. Governor Alfred E. Smith signed a new state law in 1920 that established the <b>permanency</b> of a reserve force as an adjunct of the police department. By the mid-1920s, however, the Police Reserve had gradually stopped functioning as an active part of the Police Department, due to political disputes in a high-crime period.

25|$|There is no very {{definite}} {{statement as}} to the material which was in most common use {{for the purposes of}} writing {{at the start of the}} early writing systems.

In the latter case there is this peculiarity, that plaster (sic, lime or gypsum) was used along with stone, a combination of materials which is illustrated by comparison of the practice of the Egyptian engravers, who, having first carefully smoothed the stone, filled up the faulty places with gypsum or cement, in order to obtain a perfectly uniform surface on which to execute their engravings. Metals, such as stamped coins, are mentioned as a material of writing; they include lead, brass, and gold. To the engraving of gems there is reference also, such as with seals or signets.|$|E

40|$|The {{role played}} by hedgerows in the Japanese and Italian rural {{landscape}} has drastically changed: while in the past they used to define each field and to provide wood for various purposes, from {{the second half of}} twentieth century hedgerows have been considered, in most of the cases, just an obstacle. The loss of hedgerows has impoverished the landscape not only from the aesthetical point of view but also from the ecological one. The paper analyses first a historic site in order to understand hedgerows’ transformations and to identify their <b>permanencies.</b> Consequently, it explores the multifunctionality hedgerows can provide through an Italian project which experimented alternative uses. The first case represents one of the most unique Japanese landscapes characterized by hedgerows: the Isawa plain in Iwate prefecture where singular geological and climatic characteristics have originated a scatted dwelling system where each residential unit is surrounded by hedgerow protecting the settlement from the wind. The study method is based on a GIS land-use analysis referring to aerial photographs and topographic maps. Such method is applied {{in order to understand the}} landscape transformations and to quantify hedgerows <b>permanencies</b> or loss. Secondly the paper refers to the Italian context of Veneto region where the mixed crop system strongly characterized its historical landscape. As most of such historical landscape has already disappeared, the paper focuses on an environmental project, which is based on the EU Life- Environment Programme, in order to demonstrate that hedgerows can have positive effects on the environment (CO 2 absorption, biodiversity conservation or water run-off reduction) and can be also economically advantageous. Considering the growing importance of environmental issues it is possible to look at many historic hedgerows from a more eco-friendly perspective which can contribute to a protection policy for hedgerow...|$|R

500|$|In Interstellar, Nolan {{explored}} {{the laws of}} physics as represented in Einstein's theory of general relativity, identifying time as the film's antagonist. Reality is often an abstract and fragile concept in Nolan's work. Alec Price and M.

The actual (or objective) world is of less importance than {{the way in which we}} absorb and remember, and it is this created (or subjective) reality that truly matters. [...] "It is solely in the mind and the heart where any sense of <b>permanency</b> or equilibrium can ever be found." [...] According to film theorist Todd McGowan, these [...] "created realities" [...] also reveal the ethical and political importance of creating fictions and falsehoods. Nolan's films typically deceive spectators about the events that occur and the motivations of the characters, but they do not abandon the idea of truth altogether. Instead, [...] "They show us how truth must emerge out of the lie if it is not to lead us entirely astray." [...] McGowan further argues that Nolan is the first filmmaker to devote himself entirely to the illusion of the medium, calling him a Hegelian filmmaker. He has also noted that retroactive causality populates many of Nolan's films.|$|E

40|$|This is a qualitative, exploratory-interpretative study, {{with the}} purpose of {{investigating}} the social representations of health surveillance among members of the National Health Surveillance Agency - ANVISA, in Rio Grande do Sul State. It was found that health surveillance is represented by subjects as a process that, despite the contradictions, is being constructed and lived in the job routine with signs of renovation of existing representations. Thus, health protection acquires a new understanding, deviating from the prevention limits that traditionally focus on disease in order to return to promotion itself. Also, the image of health police is displaced from punishment to health education, establishing links between normative and educative performance. Moreover, professionalism is based on responsibility and knowledge, and professional devaluation is anchored in the idea of exclusion. The results allow for an analysis of the elements that can be causing <b>permanencies</b> and influencing the movements of daily practice, being able to revert into a benefit {{for the construction of a}} professional profile...|$|R

From his new hatred of the Prince of Wales, Argyll favoured the Bill, as did the others of the sixteen of the moment, because they would be among the <b>permanencies.</b> The Scottish Jacobite peers (not representatives) and the Commons of both countries opposed the Bill. The election of a Scottish representative peer at this juncture led to negotiations between Argyll and Lockhart as leader of the suffering Jacobites, but terms were not arrived at; the Government secured a large Whig majority in a general election (1722), and Walpole began his long tenure of office.|$|R

40|$|Mapping artistic {{creation}} today offers an interesting {{perspective on the}} contemporary structure of a city, its urban dynamics and its creative economy. Extending the time perspective raises new questions regarding the inclusion of creative dimension in {{the historical development of}} urban space. My research deals with residential location of visual artists in Brussels from 1830 until now, a time period of major evolutions regarding artist’s status, and in the urban and economic development of the capital. Many issues arose on a methodological perspective, the main being how to find suitable data and to locate them. The results of the cartographic work show the evolution of artistic presence, following the extension {{of the city and the}} evolving needs of creative individuals. Nevertheless, two major concentrations emerge at the end of the 19 th century that still influence the spatial distribution of today’s artists. The Brussels case illustrates how stimulating it is to take into account the time dimension in studying artists’ neighbourhoods and it calls to consider others aspects of the art world (training, selling…) the same way. In showing evidences of spatial <b>permanencies,</b> the results offer an original point of view on the development of the city; they also enlighten a lacking perspective in current debates about creative economy and urban redevelopment – the need to take into consideration the historical depth of spatial structures. info:eu-repo/semantics/nonPublishe...|$|R
