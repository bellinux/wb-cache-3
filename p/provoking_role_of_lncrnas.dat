Recently, various lncRNAs have been implicated in both normal tissue development and in human diseases such as cancers and inherited disorders.

To better understand the <b>role</b> <b>of</b> <b>lncRNAs</b> in brain cancer, we performed a global analysis to identify and characterize all annotated and novel lncRNAs in both grade II and III gliomas as well as grade IV glioblastomas (glioblastoma multiforme [GBM]). We determined the expression <b>of</b> all <b>lncRNAs</b> in over 650 brain cancer and 70 normal brain tissue RNA sequencing datasets from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and other publicly available datasets.

Overlap between the subtype-specific lncRNAs in GBMs and LGGs demonstrated similarities between mesenchymal GBMs and IDH 1 / 2 wt LGGs, with 2 -fold higher overlap than would be expected by random chance. Using a multivariate Cox regression survival model, we identified 584 and 282 lncRNAs that were associated with a poor and good prognosis, respectively, in GBM patients.

Knockdown of LncMyoD strongly inhibits terminal muscle differentiation, largely due to a failure to exit the cell cycle. LncMyoD directly binds to IGF 2 -mRNA-binding protein 2 (IMP 2) and negatively regulates IMP 2 -mediated translation of proliferation genes such as N-Ras and c-Myc.

A total <b>of</b> 19 <b>lncRNAs</b> {{were found to}} be differentially expressed in stenotic lesions. Among these, uc 001 pwg. 1 {{was one of the most}} significantly downregulated lncRNAs and enriched in both control vein segments and human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs). Further studies revealed that uc 001 pwg. 1 overexpression could increase nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) phosphorylation and nitric oxide (NO) production in endothelial cells (ECs) derived from human-induced pluripotent stem cells (HiPSCs). Mechanistically, uc 001 pwg. 1 improves endothelial function via mediating MCAM expression. This study represents the first effort of identifying a novel candidate lncRNA for modulating the function of iPSC-ECs, which may facilitate the improvement of stem cell-based therapies for AVF failure...|$|R
40|$|Background. Long noncoding RNAs were {{involved}} in the processes of diabetes. Our study was aimed to explore clinical potential <b>of</b> <b>LncRNA</b> NONRATT 021972 in diabetic neuropathic pain and investigate detailed mechanisms. Methods. 154 patients with type 2 diabetes were enrolled as experimental group paired with control. Patients without diabetes but neuropathy were enrolled to explore exclusive <b>role</b> <b>of</b> <b>LncRNA</b> NONRATT 021972 in neuropathy. Real-time PCR and ELISA were performed to examine expression <b>of</b> <b>LncRNA</b> and TNF-α in flood. Neuropathic pain scores were calculated with data from NPQ. Streptozotocin was used for SD adult male rats to establish diabetes for NONRATT 021972 siRNA or saline treatment. Neuropathic pain behaviors and expression of TNF-α were assessed. Result. Patients with type 2 diabetes had a significantly higher concentration <b>of</b> <b>LncRNA</b> NONRATT 021972 in blood and more severe symptoms <b>of</b> neuropathic pain. <b>LncRNA</b> NONRATT 021972 was positively associated with neuropathic pain scores of type 2 diabetes. TNF-α level increased in patients with type 2 diabetes. Animal experiment showed that LncRNA NONRATT 021972 siRNA attenuated inflammation via decreasing TNF-α and alleviated neuropathic pain. Conclusion. LncRNA NONRATT 021972 increased in type 2 diabetes and was positively associated with neuropathic pain scoring in type 2 diabetes. LncRNA NONRATT 021972 exacerbated neuropathic pain via TNF-α related pathways...|$|R
40|$|Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) {{represent}} {{the largest and}} most diverse class of non-coding RNAs, comprising almost 16, 000 currently annotated transcripts in human and 10, 000 in mouse. Here, we investigated the <b>role</b> <b>of</b> <b>lncRNAs</b> in mammary tumors by performing RNA-seq on tumor sections and organoids derived from MMTV-PyMT and MMTV-Neu-NDL mice. We identified several hundred lncRNAs that were overexpressed compared to normal mammary epithelium. Among these potentially oncogenic lncRNAs we prioritized a subset as Mammary Tumor Associated RNAs (MaTARs) and determined their human counterparts, hMaTARs. To functionally validate the <b>role</b> <b>of</b> MaTARs, we performed antisense knockdown and observed reduced cell proliferation, invasion, and/or organoid branching in a cancer-specific context. Assessing the expression of hMaTARs in human breast tumors revealed that 19 hMaTARs are significantly upregulated and many of these correlate with breast cancer subtype and/or hormone receptor status, indicating potential clinical relevance...|$|R
