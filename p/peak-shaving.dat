40|$|The {{intermittent}} and fluctuating {{nature of}} output power {{of renewable energy}} sources (RES) can lead to serious security concerns such as congestion in the transmission system. Incorporating storage devices with RES is technically an effective means to mitigate this concern by allowing fluctuating RES to be as stable as traditional power plants. Storage is an even more consumer-friendly solution with greater control over electricity consumption time and price compared to e. g. demand-side management which offers limited control over the price for end users. It can also contribute to lower the electricity price, <b>peak-shave</b> the demand, defer upgrade investments, provide ride-through solution for (momentary) faults, contribute to voltage/frequency control, increase the share of green energy and thus reduce overall greenhouse gas emissions, improve power quality by reducing harmonic distortions and voltage sags/surges, facilitate utilization of more efficient off-peak generation units, etc. This paper assesses the technical applicability and economical viability of different storage devices to the Belgian power network, focusing {{on the structure of}} the Belgian electricity market.

Liquid nitrogen produced in the air separation plant not only serves as an energy storage medium but also supplies the low-grade cold energy for CO 2 separation.

There are still obstacles which {{need to be addressed}} before solar power can be provided at the level of reliability that utilities require. Some of these issues can be mitigated with strategic use of energy storage. In the case of load shifting, energy storage can be used to supply solar energy during a time of day when utility customer's demand is highest, thus providing partial peak load burden relief or peak shaving. Because solar resource availability is intermittent due to clouds and other atmospheric factors, charge/discharge planning must take weather into consideration.
