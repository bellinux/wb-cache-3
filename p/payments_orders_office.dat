[...] Conditional <b>payment</b> <b>orders</b> are pre-contract instruments consisting of a documented fee agreement between the beneficiary and the payer, proof of ability for the payer to pay which is often issued by Swift MT799 to the recipient's bank, and occasionally may include bank instructions for the establishment of a <b>payment</b> <b>order</b> following contract execution. Either <b>payment</b> <b>orders</b> or conditional <b>payment</b> <b>orders</b> are assumed to be irrevocable unless otherwise stated. <b>Payment</b> <b>orders</b> with conditions may be established after signing of a contract and posting of a letter of credit or other financial instrument with the paying bank but are never put in place prior to contract execution because of the risk that the contract will not materialize.|$|R

40|$|Electronic <b>payment</b> <b>order</b> {{in civil}} {{procedure}} Abstract Electronic <b>payment</b> <b>order</b> is {{introduced into the}} Czech legal system by the amendment of the Civil Judicial Procedure Rules no. 123 / 2008 Sb. implementing a new institution within the <b>payment</b> <b>order</b> procedure. Electronic <b>payment</b> <b>order</b> is presented as an institution able to help the Czech judiciary system within the shortened civil procedure by {{the application of the}} computerization of civil procedure. I decided to begin my thesis with a chapter trying to clarify the role of electronic <b>payment</b> <b>order</b> within the frame of the computerization of justice. I provided a brief account of the development and contemporary trends related to the computerization of justice and I approached the individual institutions which I regarded as appropriate to mention {{in order to understand the}} given institution within the whole context. The third chapter deals with reasons for which the institution was implemented into the Czech legal system. I carried out a detail analysis of the explanatory report to the Act introducing the institution of electronic <b>payment</b> <b>order</b> and I made an effort to outline the main reasons for the amendment and to arrange the objectives intended to be achieved by the implementation of the new institution.

50|$|<b>Payment</b> for <b>order</b> flow was a {{practice}} pioneered by Bernard Madoff, {{and the practice}} has long been controversial. However, on February 27, 2009, after years of opposing <b>payment</b> for <b>order</b> flow, the New York Stock Exchange sought permission from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to allow <b>payment</b> for <b>order</b> flow on its electronic exchange(s).The NYSE is proposing to pay for limit orders {{in order to put}} more cash into the market. This contrasts with the traditional model of <b>payment</b> for <b>order</b> flow that pays only for market <b>orders.</b> <b>Payment</b> for <b>order</b> flow has become less lucrative on a per share basis because of the decline in the tick size and the bid/ask spread. When stocks traded on 1/8ths of a dollar, <b>payments</b> for <b>order</b> flow were much larger than they became after 2001 when the tick size in U.S. markets fell to one cent. Larry Harris reports that in 1997, 24% of E-Trade's transaction revenue came from <b>payment</b> for <b>order</b> flow, but that by the second quarter of 2001 such payments accounted for only 15% of transaction revenue.|$|R

40|$|Paying {{bills with}} the {{universal}} <b>payment</b> <b>order</b> {{is very common}} in these days. It is used to pay bills in banks, post offices or at home, {{with the use of}} web banks and mobile banks on smart phones. To use the universal <b>payment</b> <b>order</b> in <b>payment,</b> it is necessary to read the data from it and enter the data in program for work with orders. The users of web and mobile banks and bank employees mostly do the data entering manually, by typing every character with their hands, which can be quite time-consuming task. Because the main goal of every bank is to simplify things for its costumers, we decided in cooperation with Banka Koper, to develop a system which would enable simple use of <b>payment</b> <b>order.</b> The system would be able to read the universal <b>payment</b> <b>order</b> data from its image and fill in the program for work with orders, so there would be no need of manually filling the data. This system is presented in this thesis. In {{the first part of the}} thesis we present the universal <b>payment</b> <b>order</b> and look trough some of the existing similar systems and present some of them. In the second part the development of the system and used technologies and methods are presented. In this part, the preprocessing of the image, used to find the fields we are interested in is presented. The optical character recognition of the data inside these fields is also presented in this part.

40|$|The {{liability}} of banks in electronic fund transfer (EFT) transactions {{is discussed in}} this thesis under the British and the United States law. The thesis covers banks’ liability in electronic credit and debit transfers. It covers banks’ liability in Electronic Fund Transfer at the Point Of Sale (EFTPOS), Automatic Teller Machines (ATM) and home and office banking. Liability of banks in credit card transactions and cheque truncation falls {{outside the scope of}} this thesis. In the absence of British legislation in this area, an analogy is made with the traditional methods of payment. An attempt is also made to extract the applicable rules from the general principles of law and the banking practice. The discussion, under the United States law, relies on analysing the Electronic Fund Transfer Act of 1978 and Article 4 A of the Uniform Commercial Code, which concern banks’ liability in consumer and commercially based EFT transactions. The thesis starts by analysing the legal nature of <b>payment</b> <b>orders.</b> In particular, whether a <b>payment</b> <b>order</b> is a negotiable instrument, a creation of trust funds, an assignation or merely a mandate from a customer to his bank. Chapter two discusses banks’ liability for failure to make an EFT transaction. This encompasses banks’ liability for complete failure to effect an EFT transaction and for improper implementation of such a transaction. Chapter three discusses the right to stop payment, completion of payment, irrevocability and banks’ liability for failure to stop payment. Chapter four discusses banks’ liability for erroneous EFT transactions. This includes allocation of losses resulting from errors in <b>payment</b> <b>orders</b> and errors committed by banks during the execution process of such orders. Chapter five discusses banks’ liability for unauthorised EFT transactions. Issues such as authentication of <b>payment</b> <b>orders,</b> security measures adopted by banks and allocation of losses resulting from unauthorised transactions are discussed in this chapter. Chapter six discusses the recoverability of damages for banks’ failure to implement customers’ instructions properly. It discusses what measures of damages are applicable in certain situations such as banks’ complete failure to make an EFT transaction, failure to transfer funds on time etc. The thesis is completed by summary and conclusion...|$|R
