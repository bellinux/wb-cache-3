Low-dose aspirin use was also associated with a trend toward lower risk of cardiovascular events, and lower aspirin doses (75 or 81mg/day) may optimize efficacy and safety for people requiring aspirin for long-term prevention.|$|E

The first section of the paper offers a critical review of the Government's health promotion strategy, one in which, it is argued, the primary care sector will play a central role. Hence, taking the issue of <b>primary</b> care <b>prevention</b> as a case-study, the paper then proceeds to discuss the implications of these recent reforms (i. e. managerialism and market principles) for <b>primary</b> care <b>prevention</b> at a number of different levels: namely, for FHSAs, DHAs, GPs, nurses, and consumers. The final section of the paper considers the potential impact of these reforms for the professional autonomy of GPs and nurses, particularly in relation to the proletarianisation and deprofessionalisation theses. The paper concludes with a theoretical discussion and interpretation of the themes and issues raised within the course of the paper...|$|R

40|$|Full list {{of author}} {{information}} {{is available at the}} end of the articleBackground Cardiovascular (CV) disease is the leading cause of death in the world, with coronary artery disease alone resulting in over 7 million deaths annually [1]. HMG-CoA reduc-tase inhibitors, or statins, are among the most effective and widely used treatments for reducing CV morbidity and mortality. Although there are substantial differences between recommendations for when and how to use statins for <b>primary</b> CV <b>prevention,</b> virtually all multi-national clinical guidelines recommend estimating a pa-tient’s overall CV risk in clinical decision making [2, 3]. Although past guidelines for <b>primary</b> CV <b>prevention</b> in the U. S., including the ATP III NCEP III guideline, (3) have focused on specific lipid targets (i. e., a “treat to target ” approach), there is increasing evidence for and interest in basing treatment primarily on overall CV risk [4].

25|$|The National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) {{recommends}} statin {{treatment for}} adults {{with an estimated}} 10 year risk of developing cardiovascular disease that is greater than 10%. Guidelines by the American College of Cardiology and the American Heart Association recommend statin treatment for <b>primary</b> <b>prevention</b> of cardiovascular disease in adults with LDL cholesterol ≥ 190mg/dL or those with diabetes, age 40–75 with LDL-C 70–190mg/dl; or in those with a 10-year risk of developing heart attack or stroke of 7.5% or more. In this latter group, statin assignment was not automatic, but was recommended to occur only after a clinician-patient risk discussion with shared decision making where other risk factors and lifestyle are addressed, the potential for benefit from a statin is weighed against the potential for adverse effects or drug interactions and informed patient preference is elicited. Moreover, if a risk decision was uncertain, factors such as family history, coronary calcium score, ankle-brachial index, and an inflammation test (hs-CRP ≥ 2.0mg/L) were suggested to inform the risk decision. Additional factors {{that could be used}} were an LDL-C ≥ 160 or a very high lifetime risk. However, critics such as Steven E. Nissen say that the AHA/ACC guidelines were not properly validated, overestimate the risk by at least 50%, and recommend statins for patients who will not benefit, based on populations whose observed risk is lower than predicted by the guidelines. The European Society of Cardiology and the European Atherosclerosis Society recommend the use of statins for <b>primary</b> <b>prevention,</b> depending on baseline estimated cardiovascular score and LDL thresholds.|$|E

And a 2012 review found benefits in both women and men.

Among potential barriers, we discuss restrictions on public health services based on legal immigration status, limits placed on affirmative action in education, and laws limiting travel and immigration. Under potential facilitators, we discuss community and migrant health centers, language access laws, and the use of community-based groups to provide prevention and treatment outreach. We also report on the limited research evaluating the implications of these public policies and ways to organize for more responsive public policies...|$|R
