5000|$|In {{the scanner}} the narrow light beam was {{produced}} by an arc lamp shining through the holes in a spinning Nipkow disk. Each sweep of the spot across the scene produced a [...] "scan line" [...] of the picture. A single [...] "frame" [...] of the picture was typically made up of 24, 48, or 60 scan lines. The scene was typically scanned 15 or 20 times per second, producing 15 or 20 video frames per second. The varying brightness of {{the point where the}} spot fell reflected varying amounts of light, which was converted to a proportionally varying electronic signal by the photoelectric cells. To achieve adequate sensitivity, instead of a single cell, a number of photoelectric cells were used. Like mechanical television itself, flying spot technology grew out of <b>phototelegraphy</b> (facsimile). This scanning method began in the 19th century.|$|E
