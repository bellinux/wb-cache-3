40|$|The {{fragmentation}} <b>of</b> bubbly <b>magma</b> is {{a defining}} {{point in a}} volcanic eruption-before fragmentation the magma flows relatively slowly, during fragmentation the bubbles break up to release compressed gas and, afterwards, the eruption becomes a violent gas flow carrying suspended magma particles. Seemingly benign lava flows or domes can suddenly fragment into deadly pyroclastic flows(1 - 3). Several criteria have been proposed to define the point <b>of</b> <b>magma</b> fragmentation or foam stability(4 - 7). The criterion of Papale(7) is based on melt relaxation theory and equates magma strain rate with {{the rate of increase}} of flow velocity with distance. It ignores, however, the role of bubble pressure in causing fragmentation. Two empirical approaches(4, 5) consider the role of high bubble pressure in causing fragmentation but do not address the underlying <b>physics</b> <b>of</b> <b>magma</b> fragmentation. Here I develop a fragmentation criterion for bubbly magma based on brittle failure theory and apply it to the fragmentation of lava domes and flows. On the basis of this theory, a bubbly magma will fragment when the tensile stress at the inner walls of bubbles exceeds the tensile strength <b>of</b> the <b>magma.</b> The fragmentation conditions depend strongly on initial water content, with calculated vesicularity and final water levels coinciding reasonably well with those in observed pumices. This suggests that the proposed criterion captures the essence of the fragmentation process in bubbly magma...|$|R

40|$|We {{present a}} {{numerical}} approach for modelling the complex sub-surface volcanic processes and associated geophysical signals. This method {{is based on}} the one-way coupling of the dynamics of a magmatic system and the response of the host rocks. The two systems are modelled independently, by two different numerical codes, that solve the equations of motion for the magmatic fluid and the equation of elasto-dynamics for wave propagation in the surrounding medium, respectively. Synthetic geophysical signals can be obtained and compared with those recorded by monitoring networks. The final aim is to understand how the complex <b>physics</b> <b>of</b> <b>magma</b> dynamics, coupled to its hosting medium, translates into geophysical data that can be measured and interpreted in order to understand sub-surface magma dynamics and forecast the short-term volcanic hazard. We applied this method to the Campi Flegrei volcanic system (southern Italy) and investigated the convection and mixing dynamics induced by the arrival of new CO 2 -rich magma into a hypothetical shallow magma chamber. The pressure waves originated by this system are propagated in the surrounding rocks, and the associated broad-band ground displacement and gravity anomalies are evaluated at the Earth’s surface...|$|R
40|$|Quantifying the {{timescales}} {{of current}} geological processes {{is critical for}} constraining the physical mechanisms operating on the Earth today. Since the Earth’s origin 4. 55 billion years ago magmatic processes have continued to shape the Earth, producing the major reservoirs that exist today (core, mantle, crust, oceans and atmosphere) and promoting their continued evolution. But key questions remain. When did the core form and how quickly? How are magmas produced in the mantle, and how rapidly do they travel towards the surface? How long do magmas reside in the crust, differentiating and interacting with the host rocks to yield the diverse set of igneous rocks we see today? How fast are volcanic gases such as carbon dioxide released into the atmosphere? This book addresses these and other questions by reviewing the latest advances {{in a wide range}} of Earth Science disciplines: from the measurement of short-lived radionuclides to the study of element diffusion in crystals and numerical modelling <b>of</b> <b>magma</b> behaviour.

40|$|The {{impact of}} {{explosive}} volcanic plumes on climate and on air traffic strongly {{depends on the}} concentration and grain-size distribution (GSD) of pyroclastic fragments injected into the atmosphere. Accurate and robust modelling {{of the evolution of}} GSD during pyroclast transport from the vent to the ash cloud is therefore crucial for the assessment of major volcanic hazards. Analysis of field deposits from various recent Plinian eruptions shows that their total GSD is well described by a power law, as expected from the <b>physics</b> <b>of</b> <b>magma</b> fragmentation, with an exponent (D) ranging from 3. 0 to 3. 9. By incorporating these measured GSD into the initial conditions of a steady-state 1 D model of explosive eruption columns, we show that they have a first-order impact on the dynamical behaviour of explosive eruption columns. Starting from an initial value of D, the model tracks the evolution of GSD in the column and calculates the dynamical consequences of particle sedimentation. The maximum height reached by the column, one of the first-order results relevant to aircraft safety, changes by 30 % for mass fluxes of 10 7 kgs - 1 or larger, and by 45 – 85 % for mass fluxes between 10 5 and 10 7 kgs - 1, depending on exponent D. We compare our predictions to a specially assembled set of geologic field data and remote sensing observations from 10 Plinian eruptions for which maximum column height and mass flux are known independently. The incorporation of realistic power-law GSD in the model greatly improves the predictions, which opens new perspectives for estimation of ash load and GSD in volcanic clouds from near real-time measurements available from satellite payloads. Our results also contribute to the improvement of volcanic source term characterization that is required input for meteorological dispersion models...|$|R

40|$|In the {{discussion}} of lava dome formation, viscosity <b>of</b> <b>magma</b> plays an important role. Measurements <b>of</b> viscosity <b>of</b> <b>magmas</b> in field and laboratory are briefly summarized. The types of lava dome emplacements are classified into two, squeeze- and spine-type, by kinetic processes. The squeeze-type is {{the formation of a}} dome as a result <b>of</b> squeezes <b>of</b> <b>magma</b> through conduits and the latter is solidified magma forced to ascend by underlying fluid magma. An important parameter in the formation of such lava domes is their growth rates. Lava domes of squeeze-type are governed by the Hagen-Poiseuille Law which involves their viscosoties and other eruption parameters. At present, the real viscosity <b>of</b> <b>magmas</b> at the site of lava dome is still inaccessible. In order to avoid uncertainty in viscosity <b>of</b> <b>magmas,</b> a conception <b>of</b> «macroscopic viscosity» is proposed, which involves effects of chemical components, mainly SiO 2 and volatile material, crystals and temperature, and their changes with time. Lava dome formations during the 20 th century are briefly examined and their growth rates are estimated. The relationship between the growth rates and the SiO 2 content <b>of</b> the <b>magma</b> is statistically studied, and the macroscopic viscosity is empirically expressed as a function of SiO 2 content.

40|$|Many {{unresolved}} {{questions in}} geodynamics {{revolve around the}} physical behaviour of the two-phase system of a silicate melt percolating through and interacting with a tectonically deforming host rock. Well-accepted equations exist to describe the <b>physics</b> <b>of</b> such systems and several previous studies have successfully implemented various forms of these equations in numerical models. To date, most such models <b>of</b> <b>magma</b> dynamics have focused on mantle flow problems and therefore employed viscous creep rheologies suitable to describe the deformation properties of mantle rock under high temperatures and pressures. However, {{the use of such}} rheologies is not appropriate to model melt extraction above the lithosphere-asthenosphere boundary, where the mode of deformation of the host rock transitions from ductile viscous to brittle elasto-plastic. Here, we introduce a novel approach to numerically model magma dynamics, focusing on the conceptual study of melt extraction from an asthenospheric source of partial melt through the overlying lithosphere and crust. To this end, we introduce an adapted set of two-phase flow equations, coupled to a visco-elasto-plastic rheology for both shear and compaction deformation of the host rock in interaction with the melt phase. We describe in detail how to implement this physical model into a finite-element code, and then proceed to evaluate the functionality and potential of this methodology using a series of conceptual model setups, which demonstrate the modes of melt extraction occurring around the rheological transition from ductile to brittle host rocks. The models suggest that three principal regimes of melt extraction emerge: viscous diapirism, viscoplastic decompaction channels and elasto-plastic dyking. Thus, our model <b>of</b> <b>magma</b> dynamics interacting with active tectonics of the lithosphere and crust provides a novel framework to further investigate magmato-tectonic processes such as the formation and geometry <b>of</b> <b>magma</b> chambers and conduits, as well as the emplacement of plutonic rock complexe...|$|R
