5|$|Lady Macbeth is {{a leading}} {{character}} in William Shakespeare's tragedy Macbeth (c.1603–1607). The wife of the play's tragic hero, Macbeth (a Scottish nobleman), Lady Macbeth goads her husband into committing regicide, after which she becomes queen of Scotland. Later, however, she suffers <b>pangs</b> <b>of</b> guilt for her part in the crime, which drives her to sleepwalk. She dies off-stage in the last act, an apparent suicide.|$|E
5|$|I am vexed and {{surprised}} at your not thinking {{the situation of}} Maria sufficiently important, and can only account for this want of – shall I say it? delicacy of feeling, by recollecting {{that you are a}} man – For my part I cannot suppose any situation more distressing than for a woman of sensibility with an improving mind to be bound, to such a man as I have described, for life – obliged to renounce all the humanizing affections, and to avoid cultivating her taste lest her perception of grace, and refinement of sentiment should sharpen to agony the <b>pangs</b> <b>of</b> disappointment.|$|E

25|$|Solano López {{would have}} done well to heed his father's last words to avoid {{aggressive}} acts in foreign affairs, especially with Brazil. Francisco's foreign policy vastly underestimated Paraguay's neighbors and overrated Paraguay's potential as a military power. Solano López's basic failing {{was that he did}} not recognize the changes that had occurred in the region since Francia's time. Under his father's rule, the protracted, bloody, and distracting birth <b>pangs</b> <b>of</b> Argentina and Uruguay, the bellicose policies of Brazil, and Francia's noninterventionist policies had worked in conjunction with one another to preserve Paraguayan independence. Matters had settled down since then in both Argentina and Brazil, as both countries had become surer of their identities and more united internally. Argentina, for example, began reacting to foreign challenges as a nation rather than an assortment of squabbling regions, as Paraguayans had grown to expect. Solano López's attempt to leverage Paraguay's emergence as a regional power equal to Argentina and Brazil had disastrous consequences.|$|E

[...] Oberbeck commented that Bond [...] "has become a sensitive man-of-ethics who suffers <b>pangs</b> <b>of</b> doubt and remorse over the 'senseless' violence of his profession". Oberbeck {{went on to say that}} Amis [...] "never quite captures the bizzare beat of a Fleming pace"; most telling, according to Oberbeck, was that [...] "the greatest flaw in Amis' conception of Bond is that he has attempted to transform the consummate spy-hero into something he was never meant to have been: a man with a job".|$|E

500|$|In a mixed review, Jody Rosen of Rolling Stone was {{impressed}} by its music, but found Cudi's raps [...] "pedestrian". Ian Cohen of Pitchfork gave the album a negative review, finding it frustrating that the album felt like a failed opportunity rather than a [...] "non-starter". He further wrote that Cudi largely smears his verses with a [...] "flat warble" [...] that is salvaged by Auto-Tune, which he remarked would be [...] "numbing enough on its own" [...] {{had it not been}} for the frequent [...] "terrifyingly underwritten lyric to jolt you into sharp <b>pangs</b> <b>of</b> embarrassment." [...] In a largely mixed review, Jon Caramanica of The New York Times expressed his astonishment at the emotional honesty embedded into Cudi's songwriting but felt his restrained vocal performance diminished his presence on the album, writing, that the album [...] "is a colossal, and mystifying, missed opportunity, misguided if it is in fact guided at all." [...] Citing the tracks [...] "Solo Dolo" [...] and on [...] "Cudi Zone" [...] as Cudi's most [...] "appealingly creepy" [...] and intricate vocal performance, on his general view of the album, Caramanica wrote that the rest of the album lacks that liveliness and drive, reducing Cudi to a [...] "gaseous nonentity".|$|E
500|$|In May, 2012, Beyoncé {{performed}} [...] "Resentment" [...] {{as a part}} of her revue show [...] in Atlantic City, New Jersey, United States' entertainment resort, hotel, {{casino and}} spa, Revel. She announced it as her [...] "favorite song" [...] and according to Georgette Cline of The Boombox, [...] "fans could feel the <b>pangs</b> <b>of</b> her once-broken heart on 'Resentment,' as she cooed of a lying lover who deceived her". Ben Ratliff of The New York Times mentioned [...] "Resentment" [...] in the [...] "almost continuous high point" [...] of the concert. A writer of the Associated Press, noted that Beyoncé [...] "held back tears during a rousing rendition" [...] of the song. According to Chuck Darrow of The Philadelphia Inquirer, the acoustic performance of the ballad, [...] "proved a nice respite from the relentless thump-thump-thump of the many dance-pop numbers". Tris McCall from The Star-Ledger wrote that Beyoncé brought the song to life further describing the performance as a [...] "full-scale psychological portrait in three and a half minutes". The live performance of the song during the concerts at Revel was used in Beyoncé's HBO documentary film, Life Is But a Dream (2013). Only one shot was used to film it for five minutes. Aaron Parsley from People magazine commented that the rendition of [...] "Resentment" [...] was [...] "grittier and angrier" [...] than the previous performances of the song. The song was also included on the set list of Beyoncé's The Mrs. Carter Show World Tour (2013), during several opening shows of the first leg where she performed it on a B-stage.|$|E
500|$|E. H. Carr {{writes of}} Dostoevsky's {{character}} the young student Raskolnikov {{in the novel}} Crime and Punishment who decides to murder a 'vile and loathsome' old woman money lender {{on the principle of}} transcending conventional morals: [...] "the sequel reveals to us not the <b>pangs</b> <b>of</b> a stricken conscience (which a less subtle writer would have given us) but the tragic and fruitless struggle of a powerful intellect to maintain a conviction which is incompatible with the essential nature of man." [...] Hermann Hesse wrote his Siddhartha to describe how a young man in the time of the Buddha follows his conscience on a journey to discover a transcendent inner space where all things could be unified and simply understood, ending up discovering that personal truth through selfless service as a ferryman. J. R. R. Tolkien in his epic The Lord of the Rings describes how only the hobbit Frodo is pure enough in conscience to carry the ring of power through war-torn Middle-earth to destruction in the Cracks of Doom, Frodo determining at the end to journey without weapons, and being saved from failure by his earlier decision to spare the life of the creature Gollum. Conor Cruise O'Brien wrote that Albert Camus was the writer most representative of the Western consciousness and conscience in its relation to the non-Western world. Harper Lee's To Kill a Mockingbird portrays Atticus Finch (played by Gregory Peck in the classic film from the book (see To Kill a Mockingbird (film))) as a lawyer true to his conscience who sets an example to his children and community.|$|E
60|$|And {{the mere}} {{delirium}} of sickness and fever went on inside him--his brain opening and shutting like the night--then sometimes convulsions of terror from something with great eyes that stared round a tree--then the long agony of the march, {{and the sun}} decomposing his blood-then the <b>pang</b> <b>of</b> hate for the Captain, followed, by a <b>pang</b> <b>of</b> tenderness and ease. But everything was distorted born of an ache and resolving into an ache.|$|R

500|$|Moral anti-realists {{debate whether}} the moral facts {{necessary}} to activate conscience supervene on natural facts with a posteriori necessity; or arise a priori because moral facts have a primary intension and naturally identical worlds may be presumed morally identical. It {{has also been}} argued {{that there is a}} measure of moral luck in how circumstances create the obstacles which conscience must overcome to apply moral principles or human rights and that with the benefit of enforceable property rights and the rule of law, access to universal health care plus the absence of high adult and infant mortality from conditions such as malaria, tuberculosis, HIV/AIDS and famine, people in relatively prosperous developed countries have been spared <b>pangs</b> <b>of</b> conscience associated with the physical necessity to steal scraps of food, bribe tax inspectors or police officers, and commit murder in guerrilla wars against corrupt government forces or rebel armies. Scrutton has claimed that true understanding of conscience and its relationship with morality has been hampered by an [...] "impetuous" [...] belief that philosophical questions are solved through the analysis of language in an area where clarity threatens vested interests. Susan Sontag similarly argued that it was a symptom of psychological immaturity not to recognise that many morally immature people willingly experience a form of delight, in some an erotic breaking of taboo, when witnessing violence, suffering and pain being inflicted on others. Jonathan Glover wrote that most of us [...] "do not spend our lives on endless landscape gardening of our self" [...] and our conscience is likely shaped not so much by heroic struggles, as by choice of partner, friends and job, as well as where we choose to live. Garrett Hardin in a famous article called tragedy of the commons argued that any instance in which society appeals to an individual exploiting a commons to restrain himself or herself for the general good-by means of his or her conscience- merely sets up a system which, by selectively diverting societal power and physical resources to those lacking in conscience, while fostering guilt (including anxiety about his or her individual contribution to over-population) in people acting upon it, actually works toward the elimination of conscience from the race.|$|E
