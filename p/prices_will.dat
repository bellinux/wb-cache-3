5|$|When {{the price}} {{elasticity}} {{of demand for}} a good is perfectly inelastic (Ed = 0), changes in the price do not affect the quantity demanded for the good; raising <b>prices</b> <b>will</b> always cause total revenue to increase. Goods necessary to survival can be classified here; a rational person {{will be willing to}} pay anything for a good if the alternative is death. For example, a person in the desert weak and dying of thirst would easily give all the money in his wallet, no matter how much, for a bottle of water if he would otherwise die. His demand is not contingent on the price.|$|E
5|$|Addressing the mercantilist {{belief that}} {{monetary}} intervention {{could cause a}} perpetually favourable balance of trade, Cantillon developed a specie-flow mechanism foreshadowing future international monetary equilibrium theories. He suggested that in countries with a high quantity of money in circulation, <b>prices</b> <b>will</b> increase and therefore become less competitive in relation to countries {{where there is a}} relative scarcity of money. Thus, Cantillon also held that increases in the supply of money, regardless of the source, cause increases in the price level and therefore reduce the competitiveness of a particular nation's industry in relation to a nation with lower prices. However, Cantillon did not believe that international markets tended toward equilibrium, and instead suggested that government hoard specie to avoid rising prices and falling competitiveness. Furthermore, he suggested that a favourable balance of trade can be maintained by offering a better product and retaining qualitative competitiveness. Cantillon's preference towards a favourable balance of trade possibly stemmed from the mercantilist belief in exchange being a zero-sum game, in which one party gains at the expense of another.|$|E

30|$|Carbon {{price is}} {{negatively}} correlated {{with the price of}} coal price because coal is a non-clean energy source and a rise in coal <b>price</b> <b>will</b> cause the enterprises to reduce their use of coal, and furthermore, the carbon <b>price</b> <b>will</b> decrease for reducing the demand of the use of coal. Meanwhile, the enterprises transform their uses of coal to oil and gas so that the oil <b>price</b> <b>will</b> increase as the carbon price rises.|$|R
25|$|The {{principle}} {{of supply and}} demand holds that as hydrocarbon supplies diminish, <b>prices</b> <b>will</b> rise. Therefore, higher <b>prices</b> <b>will</b> lead to increased alternative, renewable energy supplies as previously uneconomic sources become sufficiently economical to exploit. Artificial gasolines and other renewable energy sources currently require more expensive production and processing technologies than conventional petroleum reserves, but may become economically viable in the near future.|$|E

50|$|In a cash merger, the {{acquirer}} {{offers to}} purchase the shares of the target for a certain price in cash. The target’s stock <b>price</b> <b>will</b> most likely increase when the acquirer makes the offer, but the stock <b>price</b> <b>will</b> remain below the offer value. In some cases, the target's stock <b>price</b> <b>will</b> increase to a level above the offer price. This would indicate that investors expect that a higher bid could be coming for the target, either from the acquirer or from a third party. To initiate a position, the arbitrageur will buy the target's stock. The arbitrageur makes a profit when the target's stock price approaches the offer <b>price,</b> which <b>will</b> occur when the likelihood of deal consummation increases. The target's stock <b>price</b> <b>will</b> be equal to the offer price upon deal completion.|$|R

25|$|In its October 2009 {{peak oil}} report, the Government-supported UK Energy Research Centre {{warned of the}} risk that 'rising oil <b>prices</b> <b>will</b> {{encourage}} the rapid development of carbon-intensive alternatives which will make it difficult or impossible to prevent dangerous climate change and stated that 'early investment in low-carbon alternatives to conventional oil is of considerable importance' in avoiding this scenario.|$|E
25|$|The first {{criticism}} is that, following Say's {{law and the}} related circle of ideas, if demand slackens, <b>prices</b> <b>will</b> fall (barring government intervention), and the resulting lower price will stimulate demand (though at lower profit or cost – possibly even lower wages). This criticism in turn has been questioned by New Keynesian economists, who reject Say's law and instead point to evidence of sticky prices as a reason why prices do not fall in recession; this remains a debated point.|$|E

25|$|As more {{pipelines}} are built, {{oil companies}} profits and investments into these companies continue to increase. A decrease in material costs outweighs the net increase in cost of construction. The increase in construction costs results largely from increased labor and permitting costs. Supporters of pipeline transport cite {{the potential for}} job creation, with the greatest being in construction. Estimates for job growth vary, and some {{are found to be}} exaggerated. Little evidence has also been found to support the idea that oil <b>prices</b> <b>will</b> either stabilize or decrease once pipelines are constructed.|$|E

As of August 2008, while new constructions have come virtually to a halt, prices have not had significant movements, neither up nor downwards. The national average price as of late 2008 is 2,095 euros/m2.|$|E
25|$|Unfortunately, most {{historians and}} economists are {{conditioned}} {{to believe that}} steadily and sharply falling prices must result in depression: hence their amazement at the obvious prosperity and economic growth during this era. For they have overlooked {{the fact that in}} the natural course of events, when government and the banking system do not increase the money supply very rapidly, freemarket capitalism will result in an increase of production and economic growth so great as to swamp the increase of money supply. <b>Prices</b> <b>will</b> fall, and the consequences will be not depression or stagnation, but prosperity (since costs are falling, too), economic growth, and the spread of the increased living standard to all the consumers.|$|E

25|$|In {{general as}} {{we see in the}} graph below, high gas prices are {{typically}} associated to low storage periods. Usually when prices are high during the early months of the refill season (April–October), many users of storage adopt a wait and see attitude. They limit their gas intake in anticipation that the <b>prices</b> <b>will</b> drop before the heating season begins (November–March). However, when that decrease does not occur, they are forced to buy natural gas at high prices. This is particularly true for Local Distribution and other operators who rely on storage to meet the seasonal demand for their customers. On the other hand, other storage users, who use storage as a marketing tool (hedging or speculating) will hold off storing a lot of gas when the prices are high.|$|E
25|$|Fixed rate {{bonds are}} subject to {{interest}} rate risk, meaning that their market <b>prices</b> <b>will</b> decrease in value when the generally prevailing interest rates rise. Since the payments are fixed, {{a decrease in the}} market price of the bond means an increase in its yield. When the market interest rate rises, the market price of bonds will fall, reflecting investors' ability to get a higher interest rate on their money elsewhere — perhaps by purchasing a newly issued bond that already features the newly higher interest rate. This does not affect the interest payments to the bondholder, so long-term investors who want a specific amount at the maturity date do not need to worry about price swings in their bonds and do not suffer from interest rate risk.|$|E
500|$|In the PPF, {{all points}} on the curve are points of maximum [...] {{productive}} efficiency (no more output of any good can be achieved from the given inputs without sacrificing output of some good); all points inside the frontier (such as A) can be produced but are productively inefficient; all points outside the curve (such as X) cannot be produced with the given, existing resources. Not all {{points on the}} curve are Pareto efficient, however; only in the case where the marginal rate of transformation is equal to all consumers' marginal rate of substitution and hence equal to the ratio of <b>prices</b> <b>will</b> it be impossible to find any trade that will make no consumer worse off.|$|E

500|$|The {{notion that}} {{transport}} costs and trade barriers hinder {{the expansion of}} the market is age-old. Nurkse emphasised that tariff duties, exchange controls, import quotas and other non-tariff barriers to trade are major obstacles to promoting international cooperation in exporting and importing. More specifically, due to high transport costs between nations, producers do not have an incentive to export their commodities. As a result, the amount of capital accumulation remains small. To address this problem, the United Nations produced a report in 1951 with solutions for underdeveloped countries. They suggested that they can expand their markets by forming customs unions with neighbouring countries. Also, they can adopt the system of preferential taxation or even abolish customs duties altogether. The logic was that once customs duties are removed, transport costs will fall. Consequently, <b>prices</b> <b>will</b> fall and thus the demand will rise. However, Nurkse, as an export pessimist, did not agree with this view. Export pessimism is a trade theory which is governed by the idea of [...] "inward looking growth" [...] as opposed to [...] "outward looking growth".

500|$|Suppose Crusoe {{decides to}} stop being a {{producer}} and consumer simultaneously. He decides he will produce one day and consume the next. His two roles of consumer and producer are being split up and studied separately to understand the elementary form of consumer theory and producer theory in microeconomics. For dividing his time between being a consumer and producer, he must set up two collectively exhaustive markets, the coconut market and the labour market. He also sets up a firm, of which he becomes the sole shareholder. The firm will want to maximise profits by deciding how much labour to hire and how many coconuts to produce according to their prices. As a worker of the firm, Crusoe will collect wages, as a shareholder, he will collect profits and as a consumer, he will decide {{how much of the}} firm's output to purchase according to his income and the prevailing market prices. Let's assume that a currency called [...] "Dollars" [...] has been created by Robinson to manage his finances. For simplicity, assume that PriceCoconuts = $1.00. This assumption is made to make the calculations in the numerical example easy because the inclusion of <b>prices</b> <b>will</b> not alter the result of the analysis.
