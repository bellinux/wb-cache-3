One minute later, Japanese lookouts sighted a warship to port. This ship was the destroyer , heavily damaged the day before and now departing Guadalcanal independently for repairs in Australia. Whether Jarvis sighted the Japanese ships is unknown, since her radios had been destroyed. Furutaka launched torpedoes at Jarvis, which all missed. The Japanese ships passed as close to Jarvis as 1,100 meters, close enough for officers on Tenryū to look down onto the destroyer's decks without seeing any of her crew moving about. If Jarvis was aware of the Japanese ships passing by, she did not respond in any noticeable way.|$|E

25|$|Winifred Banks – {{the wife}} of George Banks, and mother to Jane and Michael. In the musical and film, she is {{presented}} as a society woman. In the film, she is a suffragette and involved in social causes. In the musical, she is a former actress. Her family and maiden name are not mentioned, however in the books, she has two aunts that are mentioned, Aunt Flossie and Aunt Caroline. In the musical, Winifred is shown to be confused and overwhelmed with her family and her role in it. It is hinted that she did not grow up in the same strict manor as her husband, <b>perhaps</b> <b>she</b> did not even have a nanny as a child, and is not from this area, which makes it difficult for her to connect and make friends. In the original books, she has five children instead of two, including the twins, John and Barbara, and later a baby, Annabel.|$|E

500|$|As for Lady Grange herself, her vituperative outbursts and indulgence {{in alcohol}} were clearly {{important}} factors in her undoing. Alexander Carlyle described her [...] as [...] "stormy and outrageous", whilst noting {{that it was in}} her husband's interests to exaggerate the nature of her violent emotions. Macaulay (2009) takes the view that the ultimate cause of her troubles was her reaction to her husband's infidelity. In an attempt to end his relationship with Mrs Lindsay, (who owned a coffee house in Haymarket, Edinburgh), Rachel threatened to expose him as a Jacobite sympathiser. <b>Perhaps</b> <b>she</b> did not understand the magnitude of this accusation and the danger it posed to her husband and his friends, or how ruthless their instincts of self-preservation were likely to be.|$|E

I know Beyoncé fans won't like me saying this, but I can't help but think that in this instance it's a case of 'if you can't beat em, join em' [...] For someone as naturally brilliant as Beyoncé (and a better singer than Gaga and Rihanna put together), <b>perhaps</b> <b>she</b> should actually stop trying so hard and do what she does best - singing proper songs." [...] Chris Willman from Yahoo! compared the song to Gaga's [...] "Telephone", where Knowles appears as a featured artist, and wrote that [...] "Maybe it's because the lack of a video for Gaga's [...] "Telephone" [...] leaves more to the imagination, but if this were a contest, I'd have to say her tune trumps Beyoncé's. [...] greatest promises of unbridled exhibitionism can't quite make the genre feel fresh." [...] The New York Times Jon Caramanica commented that [...] "Video Phone" [...] and [...] "Telephone", [...] "promised a new direction, but all Beyoncé did was show up to prove she could out-Gaga Gaga, then return to her comfort zone."

It states: [...] "May Brandon is a young woman of the present day who finds that the course of true love can sometimes run too smooth. She is engaged to the man of her choice, but no one objects. In fact, {{there is not the}} slightest opposition to her marriage in any quarter. And, being a woman, she does not like it. <b>Perhaps</b> <b>she</b> would have been married in the orthodox way {{had it not been for}} a dream that she had. In her sleep she found herself a beautiful young woman, persecuted because she was loyal to the knight she had selected. Her father was obdurate, and finally practically made her a prisoner in his gloomy old castle. Her sweetheart called with a rope ladder. They escaped, and after a number of thrilling adventures were married, and presumably lived happy forever afterwards. When May awoke, she was more discontented than ever. She flouted her fiancé, and returned his ring and swore she would never marry him. But finally she told him of her dream, and he won forgiveness by promising to run away with her like the knight of her dreams. Being a man of his word, he did. But the romance all faded out of it. The adventures they passed through were not to the woman's liking, and her experience convinced her that swashbuckling knights are as much out of date as are stagecoaches." ...|$|E

She served as wife, mother, housekeeper, hostess, letter-writer, and also family packer, as Peter Taylor nomadically moved from one to another writer-in-residence post." ...|$|E
2500|$|This coolness between 1955 and 1959 is {{the only}} hint that <b>perhaps</b> <b>she</b> did mind his other lady friends, but little is known of Rudge's views of Pound's [...] "other women". She {{had no choice but}} to {{tolerate}} the existence of his wife. Marcella Spann, an English teacher, began to write to him in St. Elizabeth's, which led to visits. Following his release, Spann accompanied Ezra and Dorothy back to Italy, acting as his secretary. Pound is alleged to have proposed to her (although he was already married), but Dorothy sent Spann packing. Nevertheless, Spann and Pound jointly edited the 1964 volume Confucius to Cummings: An Anthology of Poetry.|$|E

[...] On 8 November 1989, Parliament expressed outrage at Maathai's actions, complaining of her letters to foreign organizations and calling the Green Belt Movement a bogus organization and its members [...] "a bunch of divorcees".

2500|$|Two Russian men she met {{commented on}} her general {{disdain for the}} male sex; irritated by their {{assumption}} that since she was always falling in love, she would return their affections if they flirted with her, Clairmont joked {{in a letter to}} Mary Shelley that <b>perhaps</b> <b>she</b> should fall in love with both of them at once and prove them wrong. She returned to England in 1828, but remained there only a short while before departing for Dresden, where she was employed as a companion and housekeeper. Scholar Bradford A. Booth suggested in 1938 that Clairmont, driven by a need for money, might have been the true author of most of The Pole, an 1830 short story that appeared in the magazine The Court Assembly and Belle Assemblée as by [...] "The Author of Frankenstein". Unlike Mary Shelley, Clairmont was familiar with the Polish used in the story. At one point, she thought of writing a book about the dangers that might result from [...] "erroneous opinions" [...] about the relations between men and women, using examples from the lives of Shelley and Byron. She did not make many literary attempts, as she explained to her friend Jane Williams: ...|$|E

[...] Alternatively, Rabbi Samuel bar Nahmani taught that the place is called Enaim because Tamar gave eyes ( [...] , einaim) to her words; that is, Tamar gave convincing replies to Judah's questions.

When Judah asked her if perhaps her father had accepted marriage proposals on her behalf betrothals (making her forbidden to Judah), she replied that she was an orphan.

Coincidentally, at that time, Mrs. Long had her husband committed to the John Sealy Mental Hospital in Galveston, Texas, for an alleged mental breakdown. <b>Perhaps,</b> <b>she</b> feared that Earl would have harmed her {{when he was in}} an agitated state. Dodd says that Blanche [...] "conspired" [...] with Senator Russell B. Long, Earl's nephew, and Dr. Arthur Long, a cousin, to have Earl Long committed. Television cameras showed Long being taken to the institution amid his hurling of profanities. He was quickly released because there was deemed no mental breakdown but sensational political actions {{on the part of the}} governor. Time magazine reported that to obtain his release, Earl Long promised Blanche that he [...] "would submit to psychiatric treatment in New Orleans, actually the state mental hospital in Mandeville. When Jesse Bankston, the director of the Department of Hospitals, refused to release Long from the Mandeville facility, Long had Bankston, a loyal member of the administration, dismissed. Bankston and Mrs. Long professed concern about Long's loss of weight and feared for his weak heart, for he had a major heart attack in late 1950.|$|E
