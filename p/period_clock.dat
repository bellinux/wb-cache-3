Other murine clock gene mutations are {{not associated with}} a tumor prone phenotype. Shift work and nocturnal light exposure are associated with circadian clock disruption and with increased cancer risk. The mechanisms responsible for {{the connection between the}} circadian clock and cancer are not well defined. We propose that circadian disruption per se is not uniformly tumor promoting and the mechanisms for tumor promotion by specific circadian clock disturbances will differ dependent upon the genes and pathways involved. We propose that <b>Period</b> <b>clock</b> gene mutations promote tumorigenesis by unique molecular pathways. Per 2 and Per 1 modulate β-catenin and cell proliferation in colon and non-colon cancer cells. Per 2 mutation increases intestinal β-catenin levels and colon polyp formation. Per 2 mutation also increases ApcMin/+-mediated intestinal and colonic polyp formation. Intestinal tumorigenesis per se may also alter clock function as a result of increased β-catenin destabilizing PER 2 protein. Levels and circadian rhythm of PER 2 in ApcMin/+ mouse intestine are markedly decreased, and selective abnormalities in intestinal clock gene and clock-controlled gene expression are seen.

In the SCN of wild-type mice, light exposure evokes a transient interaction between PRKCA and PERIOD 2 (PER 2) proteins that affects PER 2 stability and nucleocytoplasmic distribution.

A putative transcriptional start site for the vic operon was mapped 16 bp upstream of the ATG codon of vicR.

40|$|Type 2 {{diabetes}} mellitus is a chronic disease {{that affects the}} lives of millions. A type 2 diabetic is unable to properly produce insulin, a hormone that helps glucose enter the cells. As a result, there are high levels of glucose in the bloodstream, {{which can lead to}} heart disease, kidney and nerve damage and loss of eyesight. It is well known that some individuals are genetically prone to the disease, and studies have shown that a disrupted sleep/ wake cycle can increase an individual’s chance of developing diabetes. Insulin is secreted in a predictable daily (i. e., circadian) pattern from the pancreas, and a functional biological clock is necessary for proper insulin release. In addition, studies have shown that diabetes affects some the genes which regulate the circadian rhythm, such as <b>period,</b> <b>clock,</b> and bmal 1. Given that there is a relationship between circadian rhythms and diabetes, this study investigates the selectively bred TALLYHO/Jng (TH) mice which develop type 2 diabetes at ten weeks of age, mimicking human diabetes symptoms such as hyperglycemia, hyperinsulinemia, obesity, and enlargement of the islets of Langerhans in the pancreas. Eight male TH mice running-wheel turn activity was observed under constant darkness for the course of several weeks. Their free running rhythms were observed pre-and-post onset of diabetes.

40|$|The {{research}} of this thesis {{focused on the}} circadian RNA-binding protein CHLAMY 1 from the green alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii that consists of two subunits, C 1 and C 3. CHLAMY 1 binds specifically to (UG) ≥ 7 -repeat sequences situated in the 3 '-UTRs of several mRNAs such as nitrite reductase 1 (nii 1). The role of the C 1 subunit within the circadian system was characterized by silencing its gene by an RNAi. The expression level of C 1 was silenced down to 25 - 85 %. To show the influence of CHLAMY 1 on circadian output, NII activities were measured. In wild-type, NII activity peaks around the beginning of subjective day. In the transgenic strain arrhythmicity was observed. Circadian phototaxis was chosen as a second output rhythm. In this case, arrhythmicity was observed immediately or {{in the first three}} days under constant conditions in transgenic lines. In addition to these results, a co-regulation between C 1 and C 3 subunits was found. These data indicate a central role of the C 1 subunit in the circadian system of C. reinhardtii. It was also analyzed if the two subunits play a role in temperature integration. C 1 was found to be hyper-phosphorylated at 18 °C and hypo-phosphorylated at 28 °C. The C 3 expression level was found to be up-regulated at 18 °C, which was shown to occur at the transcriptional level. The clock-relevant CASEIN KINASE 1 (CK 1) and Ser-/Thr-PROTEIN PHOSPHATASEs (PPs) were found to mediate the temperature dependent regulation of C 1 and C 3.

40|$|A novel {{extracellular}} ligand-binding domain, termed CHASE, {{is described}} in sensory adenylyl and diguanylate cyclases, and histidine kinases, in several bacterial species, Dictyostelium and plants. The CHASE domain is predicted to sense stimuli that are specific for the developmental program of an organism. Living organisms monitor the environment and adjust their behavior, metabolism and development in response to changes in physico-chemical parameters. Even simple prokaryotic organisms possess sophisticated signal transduction networks that contain specialized receptors directly interacting with environmental cues. Three major classes of receptor proteins in prokaryotes are sensor histidine kinases of two-component regulatory systems 1, chemotaxis transducers or methyl-accepting chemotaxis proteins 2, and diguanylate cyclases 3. The receptor proteins from all three classes share several sensory domains {{that are involved in}} the recognition of intracellular and extracellular signals. Some of these domains are also found in eukaryotic signal transduction proteins. For example, intracellular sensory domains PAS (found in <b>period</b> <b>clock</b> protein, aryl hydrocarbon receptor and single-minded protein) 4 – 6 and GAF (found in cGMP-phosphodiesterases, adenylate cyclases and FhlA) 7 are ubiquitous, and are found in various signal transduction proteins {{in a wide range of}} organisms. Prosthetic groups associated with PAS and GAF domains can be responsive to oxygen, redox potential and light. Recently, an extracellular sensor domain, termed Cache (Ca 2 + channels and chemotaxis receptors) 8 or ESENS (extracellular sensing) 2, was reported in prokaryotic receptors and animal ion channels. The proposed function for the Cache domain is the binding of small ligands, such as amino acids, sugars and organic acids. We report here the identification of a novel extracellular sensor domain in histidine kinases and diguanylate- and adenylyl cyclases from prokaryotes, lower eukaryotes and plants, which is predicted to recognize short peptides and other stimuli that trigger developmental changes.

But existing methods solving this problem are still computationally expensive and can only provide the yield at a given <b>clock</b> <b>period.</b> In this {{paper we propose a}} method combining reduced iterations and graph transformations. The reduced iterations extract setup time constraints and identify a subgraph for the following graph transformations handling the constraints from nonpositive loops. The combined algorithms are very efficient, more than 10 times faster than other existing methods, and result in a parametric minimum <b>clock</b> <b>period,</b> which together with the hold time constraints can be used to compute the yield at any given <b>clock</b> <b>period</b> very easily...|$|R
