The aircraft impacted the roof of an apartment building and came to rest in a ravine. All five passengers and two crew members aboard the aircraft were killed; a person in the apartment building suffered severe burns.|$|E

In Japan, we find that <b>private</b> <b>corporations</b> have reduced investment in equipment and focused instead on financial investment, giving rise {{to the increase in}} the power index in the asset-oriented system.|$|R

5|$|The {{road was}} first {{constructed}} in the early 19th century following the path of Nine Mile Creek, which connected several early settlements in Central New York. The northern half of the route, between the villages of Marcellus and Camillus, was later improved as a plank road in 1855 by a <b>private</b> <b>corporation</b> that collected tolls from travelers on the road. The state took over {{the maintenance of the}} road {{by the beginning of the}} 20th century. The former plank road and an extension south to Otisco Lake and southwest to Skaneateles Lake was first designated as Route174 in the 1930 state highway renumbering. Since then, several minor realignments have been made in the areas of the villages of Marcellus and Camillus to accommodate newly built bypasses.|$|E
5|$|McKinsey & Company grew {{quickly in}} the 1940s and 50s, {{especially}} in Europe. It had 88 staff in 1951 and more than 200 by the 1960s, including 37 in London by 1966. In the same year, McKinsey had six offices in major US cities like San Francisco, Cleveland, Los Angeles and Washington D.C., as well as six abroad. These foreign offices were primarily in Europe, such as in London, Paris, Amsterdam, {{as well as in}} Melbourne. By this time, one third of the company's revenues originated from its European offices. Guy Crockett stepped down as managing director in 1950, and Marvin Bower was elected in his place. McKinsey's profit-sharing, executive and planning committees were formed in 1951. The organization's client base expanded especially among governments, defense contractors, bluechip companies and military organizations in the post-World War II era. After seven years of consideration, McKinsey became a <b>private</b> <b>corporation</b> with shares owned exclusively by McKinsey employees in 1956.|$|E

40|$|Selection {{of right}} sets of {{projects}} is considerably critical for organizations to successfully achieve their competitive advantages and corporate strategies. Due to limited resources and dynamic changes in business environment, {{this kind of}} selection is quite challenging for organizations. Beside one hundred selection tools and techniques, academics and practitioners have studied and recommended complex selection frameworks to facilitate the selection of right projects. However, these theoretical frameworks are not applied by <b>private</b> <b>corporations</b> in Vietnam. Therefore, this dissertation is intended {{to better understand the}} academic and practical literature about project portfolio selection; study current practices of project selection that <b>private</b> <b>corporations</b> in Vietnam are using; and propose a framework that is beneficially adaptable to these <b>private</b> <b>corporations.</b> A multiple-case study strategy accessing qualitative data through observations and semi-structure interviews is designed to investigate how <b>private</b> <b>corporations</b> select their project portfolio under the current contexts of booming economy in Vietnam to ensure successful realization of their growth and development strategy. The recommendations resulted from literature review and investigations do not only support the investigated corporations to improve {{the quantity and quality of}} their investment project portfolio(s) but also facilitate possible adaptation to project portfolio selection by other <b>private</b> <b>corporations...</b>|$|R

40|$|State-owned {{enterprises}} (SOEs) {{are often}} {{claimed to be}} less profitable and less efficient compared to <b>private</b> <b>corporations.</b> According to Grout and Stevens (2003), SOEs were associated with different types of market failure and were mostly used to attain non-economic goals such as unemployment level reduction, control over natural resources, and political stability. Shirley and Walsh (2000), who surveyed 52 studies on the difference in performance between SOEs and <b>private</b> <b>corporations,</b> discovered that there were only five studies indicating that SOEs outperformed <b>private</b> <b>corporations.</b> However, these studies only monitored the firms in the monopolistic utility sectors. Similar situations occurred {{in most of the}} previous studies that researched correlation between performance and firm ownership. Many of them either focused heavily on industries with monopoly/oligopoly characteristics or industries with output that could not be priced by competitive forces. As a result, it was difficult to distinguish the effects of market regulations and conditions on the types of firm ownership. Since there is a correlation between competition and performance, controlling for the market structure is crucial to the proper investigation of performance across different types of ownership (Goldeng, Grunfeld, 2 ̆ 6 Benito, 2008). Since my research is focusing on the difference in performance between SOEs and <b>private</b> <b>corporations</b> within a competitive environment, it contributes to the very few studies that controlled for the market structure. My main research question is whether <b>private</b> <b>corporations</b> perform better compared to SOEs in terms of profitability and efficiency in the strategic sectors in a competitive environment. My hypothesis is that due to the soft-budget constraint behavior and policy burdens imposed by the state, SOEs are less efficient and have lower profitability compared to <b>private</b> <b>corporations...</b>|$|R
