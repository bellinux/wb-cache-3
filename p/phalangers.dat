25|$|Greater glider (Petauroides volans) (gliding). The only {{species of}} the genus Petauroides of the family Pseudocheiridae. This {{marsupial}} is found in Australia, and was originally classed with the flying <b>phalangers,</b> but is now recognised as separate. Its flying membrane only extends to the elbow, {{rather than to the}} wrist as in Petaurinae.|$|E
25|$|Flying <b>phalangers</b> or wrist-winged gliders (subfamily Petaurinae) (gliding). Possums {{found in}} Australia, and New Guinea. The gliding {{membranes}} are hardly noticeable until they jump. On jumping, the animal extends all four legs and stretches the loose folds of skin. The subfamily contains seven species. Of the six {{species in the}} genus Petaurus, the sugar glider and the Biak glider {{are the most common}} species. The lone species in the genus Gymnobelideus, Leadbeater's possum has only a vestigial gliding membrane.|$|E
6000|$|The {{mammalian}} fauna of Australia consists, {{as is well}} known, wholly of {{the lowest}} forms--the Marsupials and Monotremata--except only a few species of mice. This is {{accounted for by the}} complete isolation of the country from the Asiatic continent during the whole period of the development of the higher animals. At some earlier epoch the ancestral marsupials, which abounded both in Europe and North America {{in the middle of the}} Secondary period, entered the country, and have since remained there, free from the competition of higher forms, and have undergone a special development in accordance with the peculiar conditions of a limited area. While in the large continents higher forms of mammalia have been developed, which have almost or wholly exterminated the less perfect marsupials, in Australia these latter have become modified into such varied forms as the leaping kangaroos, the burrowing wombats, the arboreal <b>phalangers,</b> the insectivorous bandicoots, and the carnivorous Dasyuridae or native cats, culminating in the Thylacinus or [...] "tiger-wolf" [...] of Tasmania--animals as unlike each other as our sheep, rabbits, squirrels, and dogs, but all retaining the characteristic features of the marsupial type.|$|E
50|$|In a {{phylogenetic tree}} {{published}} in 1987 by Tim Flannery and his colleagues, <b>Phalanger</b> lullulae {{was believed to}} share the same states with <b>Phalanger</b> intercastellanus {{also known as the}} Eastern common cuscus. A morphological consensus tree shows that the <b>Phalanger</b> lullulae is related to the Mountain cuscus (<b>Phalanger</b> carmelatie), <b>Phalanger</b> interpositus, Stein's cuscus (<b>Phalanger</b> vestitus), and the Banggai cuscus (Strigocuscus pelengensis). This phylogenetic tree was created by Tim Flannery and his colleagues in 1987 but was also reanalyzed by Ruedas and Morales in 2005. A partial 12S rRNA ML tree by Ruedas and Morales demonstrated the firstly mentioned relationship between the <b>Phalanger</b> lullulae and <b>Phalanger</b> intercastellanus. The Partial 12S rRNA ML tree by Hamilton and Springer demonstrated that the <b>Phalanger</b> lullulae is most closely related to the Northern common cuscus (<b>Phalanger</b> orientalis). An ML tree of the nuclear gene BRCA1 created by Raterman and his colleagues shows the <b>Phalanger</b> lullulae's close relationship to the <b>Phalanger</b> orientalis as well. While these aforementioned phylogenies are more certain, there is another proposed morphological phylogeny by Flannery that demonstrates the uncertainty of the <b>Phalanger</b> lullulae's relationship among the <b>Phalanger</b> orientalis and <b>Phalanger</b> vestitus.|$|R

60|$|Celebes not Strictly a Continental Island.--A {{study of}} the {{mammalian}} and of the bird-fauna of Celebes thus leads us in both cases to the same conclusion, and forbids us to rank it as a strictly continental island on the Asiatic side. But facts of a very similar character are equally opposed {{to the idea of}} a former land-connection with Australia or New Guinea, or even with the Moluccas. The numerous marsupials of those countries are all wanting in Celebes, except the <b>phalangers</b> of the genus Cuscus, and these arboreal creatures are very liable to be carried across narrow seas on trees uprooted by earthquakes or floods. The terrestrial cassowaries are equally absent; and thus we can account for the presence of all the Moluccan or Australian types actually found in Celebes without supposing any land-connection on this side during the Tertiary period. The presence of the Celebes ape in the island of Batchian, and of the babirusa in Bouru, can be sufficiently explained by a somewhat closer approximation of the respective lands, or by a few intervening islands which have since disappeared, or it may even be due to human agency.|$|E
60|$|Example, {{says the}} wisdom of our ancestors, is better than precept; so perhaps, if I take a single example to start with, I shall make the {{principle}} I wish to illustrate a trifle clearer to the European comprehension. In Australia, when Cook or Van Diemen first visited it, there were no horses, cows, or sheep; no rabbits, weasels, or cats; no indigenous quadrupeds of any sort except the pouched mammals or marsupials, familiarly typified to {{every one of us}} by the mamma kangaroo in Regent's Park, who carries the baby kangaroos about with her, neatly deposited in the sac or pouch which nature has provided for them instead of a cradle. To this rough generalisation, to be sure, two special exceptions must needs be made; namely, the noble Australian black-fellow himself, and the dingo or wild dog whose ancestors no doubt came to the country in the same ship with him, as the brown rat came to England with George I. of blessed memory. But of these two solitary representatives of the later and higher Asiatic fauna 'more anon'; for the present we may regard it as approximately true that aboriginal and unsophisticated Australia in the lump was wholly given over, on its first discovery, to kangaroos, <b>phalangers,</b> dasyures, wombats, and other quaint marsupial animals, with names as strange and clumsy as their forms.|$|E
60|$|Now, who {{and what}} are the {{marsupials}} as a family, viewed in the dry light of modern science? Well, they are simply one of the very oldest mammalian families, and therefore, I need hardly say, in the levelling and topsy-turvy view of evolutionary biology, the least entitled to consideration or respect from rational observers. For of course in the kingdom of science the last shall be first, and the first last; it is the oldest families that are accounted the worst, while the best families mean always the newest. Now, the earliest mammals to appear on earth were creatures of distinctly marsupial type. As long ago as the time when the red marl of Devonshire and the blue lias of Lyme Regis were laid down on the bed of the muddy sea that once covered the surface of Dorset and the English Channel, a little creature like the kangaroo rats of Southern Australia lived among the plains of what is now the south of England. In the ages succeeding the deposition of the red marl Europe seems to have been broken up into an archipelago of coral reefs and atolls; and the islands of this ancient oolitic ocean were tenanted by numbers of tiny ancestral marsupials, some of which approached in appearance the pouched ant-eaters of Western Australia, while others resembled rather the <b>phalangers</b> and wombats, or turned into excellent imitation carnivores, like our modern friend the Tasmanian devil. Up {{to the end of the}} time when the chalk deposits of Surrey, Kent, and Sussex were laid down, indeed, there is no evidence of the existence anywhere in the world of any mammals differing in type from those which now inhabit Australia. In other words, so far as regards mammalian life, the whole of the world had then already reached pretty nearly the same point of evolution that poor Australia still sticks at.|$|E

2500|$|Family Acrobatidae: feather-tail glider, pen-tailed <b>phalanger</b> ...|$|R
50|$|The feathertail glider (Acrobates pygmaeus), {{also known}} as the pygmy gliding possum, pygmy glider, pygmy <b>phalanger,</b> flying <b>phalanger</b> and flying mouse, is a species of {{marsupial}} native to eastern Australia. It is the world's smallest gliding mammal and is named for its long feather-shaped tail.|$|R
6000|$|The {{geological}} {{record is}} confessedly imperfect. At {{the time when}} Darwin first published the 'Origin of Species,' it had disclosed to our view comparatively few intermediate or transitional forms between the chief great classes of plants or animals; since that time, in singular confirmation of the Darwinian hypothesis, it has disclosed an immense number of such connecting types, amongst which may be more particularly noticed the 'missing links' between the birds and reptiles, the ancestors of the horses, the camels, and the pigs, and the common progenitor of the ruminants and the pachyderms, two great groups classed by Cuvier as distinct orders--all of which instances were incorporated by Darwin in later editions of his 'Origin of Species.' But, apart from these special and newly discovered cases, the whole general course of geological history 'agrees admirably with the theory of descent with modification through variation and natural selection.' The simpler animals of early times are followed by the more complex and more specialised animals of later geological periods. As each main group of animals appears upon the stage of life, it appears in a very central and 'generalised' form; as time goes on, we find its various members differing more and more widely from one another, and assuming more and more specialised adaptive forms. And in each country it is found, as a rule, that the extinct animals of the later formations bear a close general resemblance and relationship to the animals which now inhabit the same regions. For example, the fossil mammals from the Australian caves are nearly allied to the modern kangaroos, <b>phalangers,</b> and wombats; and the gigantic extinct sloths and armadillos of South America are reproduced in their smaller representatives at the present day. So, too, the moa of New Zealand was a huge apteryx; and the birds disentombed from the bone-caves of Brazil show close affinities to the toucans and jacanars that still scream and flit in countless flocks among Brazilian forests. The obvious implication is that the animals now inhabiting any given area are the modified descendants of those that formerly inhabited it. 'On the theory of descent with modification, the great law of the succession of the same types within the same areas is at once explained.' ...|$|E
60|$|After {{the deep}} belt of open sea was thus {{established}} between the bigger Australian continent and the Malayan region, however, the mammals {{of the great}} mainlands continued to develop on their own account, {{in accordance with the}} strictest Darwinian principles, among the wider plains of their own habitats. The competition there was fiercer and more general; the struggle for life was bloodier and more arduous. Hence, while the old-fashioned marsupials continued to survive and to evolve slowly along their own lines in their own restricted southern world, their collateral descendants in Europe and Asia and America or elsewhere went on progressing into far higher, stronger, and better adapted forms--the great central mammalian fauna. In place of the petty <b>phalangers</b> and pouched ant-eaters of the oolitic period, our tertiary strata in the larger continents show us a rapid and extraordinary development of the mammalian race into monstrous creatures, some of them now quite extinct, and some still holding their own undisturbed in India, Africa, and the American prairies. The palæotherium and the deinoceras, the mastodon and the mammoth, the huge giraffes and antelopes of sunnier times, succeed to the ancestral kangaroos and wombats of the secondary strata. Slowly the horses grow more horse-like, the shadowy camel begins to camelise himself, the buffaloes acquire the rudiments of horns, the deer branch out by tentative steps into still more complicated and more complicated antlers. Side by side with this wonderful outgrowth of the mammalian type, in the first plasticity of its vigorous youth, the older marsupials die away one by one in the geological record before the faces of their more successful competitors; the new carnivores devour them wholesale, the new ruminants eat up their pastures, the new rodents outwit them in the modernised forests. At last the pouched creatures all disappear utterly from all the world, save only Australia, with the solitary exception of a single advanced marsupial family, the familiar opossum of plantation melodies. And the history of the opossum himself is so very singular that it almost deserves to receive the polite attention of a separate paragraph for its own proper elucidation.|$|E
5000|$|Flying <b>phalangers</b> are {{typically}} nocturnal, most being small (sometimes around 400 mm, counting the tail), and have folds of loose skin (patagia) {{running from the}} wrists to the ankles.

40|$|Pseudochirus is a {{well-defined}} genus of <b>Phalangers,</b> which, {{up to this}} time, embraced three species: cookii, bernsteinii and albertisii. Pseudochirus viverrinus Ogilby (1837), from Van Diemen’s Land, is regarded as specifically distinct from Ps. cookii Desmarest (1817), from the Australian Continent. They are also separated by Gould (Mammals of Australia, 1863), who stated that the island examples are of a larger size and always dressed in a softer and longer fur and who said, that for the present he regarded them as distinct. Gould remarked an analogical phenomenon in Trichosurus lemurinus or vulpinus from the Australian Continent and Trichosurus fuliginosus from Van Diemen’s Land. He says „the skins of the Island and Continental Animals are both made into sleeping rugs, but the former are esteemed so much more highly, that a rug formed of them is considered worth three times {{the price of one}} of the latter. ” A conscientious comparison of the skulls however shows that there is no trace of difference between these parts of the continental and of the island forms, neither in form of skull nor in dentition. In my opinion such facts are proofs to illustrate the great variation of a certain species within certain limits; these variations depend upon external causes, as there are: locality, climate, food a. s. o.

40|$|WOS: 000074249100002 International audienceA {{population}} {{survey of}} anomalures in the Foret des Abeilles, Central Gabon, was undertaken by exploring hollow trees over 75 ha. Three species were identified: Anomalurus derbianus, A. pusillus, and Idiurus macrotis. Population estimates {{indicate that a}} total of about 500 anomalures could be present per km(2). The three species shelter in hollow trees during the day and have a strictly nocturnal activity. Den selection depends mainly on the size and configuration of the cavity; neither tree species nor tree diameter are important. Data on home ranges and nightly movements were obtained by the radio-tracking of two A. derbianus and one I. macrotis. In dens, A. derbianus (about 700 g body weight) were mostly found either alone or in pairs of one female and a young. During the nocturnal activity period, two to three individuals (always including a young) were seen together on several occasions. Communal nesting occurred in I. macrotis (about 30 g body weight) with groups ranging from two to 40 individuals. By contrast, they were always observed alone during the night activity period. Few feeding data were recorded: all involved the consumption of phloem sap after scratching the bark of a small number of tree species. Great quantities of leaves and insects (ants and termites) were found in a stomach of A. derbianus. Comparisons with results obtained from long term studies on gliders in Australasia highlight several convergence points between African flying squirrels and flying <b>phalangers</b> (Phalangeridae), in particular when comparing species with similar body weights. Our data confirm that anomalures occupy the niche of gliders on the African continent...|$|E
