25|$|Hydroxyzine is {{prescribed}} {{when the}} onset of an organic disease state manifests through anxiety, as generalized anxiety disorder, or in other more serious cases as <b>psychoneurosis,</b> and is therefore prescribed {{as a means of}} regulating normal function. Hydroxyzine has shown to be as effective as the benzodiazepine drug bromazepam in the treatment of generalised anxiety disorder. However, a systematic review concluded that compared with other anxiolytic agents (benzodiazepines and buspirone), hydroxyzine was equivalent in efficacy, acceptability and tolerability, however there is insufficient evidence to recommend it as a treatment for generalised anxiety disorder due to the high risk of bias in the reviewed studies.|$|E
2500|$|As Edvard remembered it, Christian's {{positive}} {{behavior toward}} his children was overshadowed by his morbid pietism. Munch wrote, [...] "My father was temperamentally nervous and obsessively religious—to {{the point of}} <b>psychoneurosis.</b> From him I inherited the seeds of madness. The angels of fear, sorrow, and death stood by my side since the day I was born." [...] Christian reprimanded his children by telling them that their mother was looking down from heaven and grieving over their misbehavior. The oppressive religious milieu, Edvard's poor health, and the vivid ghost stories helped inspire his macabre visions and nightmares; the boy felt that death was constantly advancing on him. One of Munch's younger sisters, Laura, was diagnosed with mental illness at an early age. Of the five siblings, only Andreas married, but he died {{a few months after}} the wedding. Munch would later write, [...] "I inherited two of mankind's most frightful enemies—the heritage of consumption and insanity." ...|$|E

40|$|There {{are many}} {{theories}} {{about the origin of}} stammering. But we can classify them into three groups. Primarily, as a deformity of peripheral phonetic organs. Socondly, as disorders of central nerve systems. Thirdly, as a problem of mental disturbance resulting from phonetic failure. Studying into the various aspects of stammering, we find that there are many resemblances between <b>Psychoneuroses</b> and it. In spite of this, there are some different phases between them, too. ⅰ. <b>Psychoneuroses</b> appear generally after the adult age of people. But, stammering presents itself from the beginning of childfood. ⅱ. Stammering is hardly to be cured by the method of psychological therapy. We can find several distorted aspects of stammerers' personalities. They exhibit more introvertive traits than non-stammering children.

40|$|There is no {{question}} about the negative effects of child sexual abuse. Freud's seduction theory asserts that <b>psychoneuroses</b> in adults are caused by reactivation of forgotten recollections of gross sexual abuse (involving the genitals) that had taken place prior to the age of 8 to 10 years. His contribution consisted in the discovery of specific events, prior to puberty, which were indispensable to the formation of <b>psychoneuroses.</b> If an adult patient recalled an infantile sexual experience, Freud assumed the interference of a pervert: a child was sexually innocent unless it had been traumatized. But Freud's technique of clinical exploration had not attained adequate reliability and was not immune to prejudices. Freud himself dropped his mechanical, static theory that presupposed a single type of accidentally occurring trauma prior to puberty, allowing him to develop his new drive and fantasy theory...|$|R
50|$|Reich's {{view of the}} {{relationship}} between actual and <b>psychoneuroses</b> has not found its way into psychoanalytic thinking.

25|$|On {{the basis}} of his early {{clinical}} work, Freud had postulated that unconscious memories of sexual molestation in early childhood were a necessary precondition for the <b>psychoneuroses</b> (hysteria and obsessional neurosis), a formulation now known as Freud's seduction theory. In the light of his self-analysis, Freud abandoned the theory that every neurosis {{can be traced back to}} the effects of infantile sexual abuse, now arguing that infantile sexual scenarios still had a causative function, but it did not matter whether they were real or imagined and that in either case they became pathogenic only when acting as repressed memories.|$|R

5000|$|Reich {{distinguished}} between complete release of accumulated sexual tensions in orgasm, {{resulting in the}} restoration of energy equilibrium, and orgastic impotence, in which the release of energy is incomplete. [...] In other words, {{he argued that the}} inability of psychoneurotics to wholly discharge sexual energy caused a damming up of energy (or sexual stasis), leaving them in a vicious circle: the actual neurosis physiologically provided the energy for the <b>psychoneurosis,</b> while the <b>psychoneurosis</b> provided a psychological mechanism to maintain the actual neurosis. Accordingly, Reich defined neurosis as the sum total of all chronic and automatic inhibitions of natural sexual excitations and which results in an outer rigidity and inner anxiety fuelling harshness, brutality, sexual sadism, restriction, mechanisation, confinement to routines and becoming filled with compulsions or phobias as well as loneliness, helplessness, craving for authority, fear of responsibility and mystical longing. Orgastic potency enables the individual to receive satisfaction in the sex act, whereas those lacking in it are forever seeking it, and are therefore likely to be more sexually needy.|$|E

5000|$|Freud {{observed}} that {{one group of}} patients suffering from neurosis had sexual disturbances - practising coitus interruptus, conflicts related to masturbation or sexual abstinence - and were cured when these disturbances were removed. Hence, Freud reasoned that sexual maladaption caused the active damming-up of [...] "sexual stuff" [...] and defined [...] "actual neurosis" [...] as anxiety based on dammed-up libido. In contrast, those with <b>psychoneuroses</b> had conflicts related to the unconscious: repressed impulses, desires and memories, and repressed unresolved conflicts and childhood traumas. Freud abandoned this view in the 1920s and postulated the never popularly accepted death instinct to explain the destructive behaviour that was earlier attributed to frustrated libido.|$|R
40|$|IN A STUDY of the {{personality}} of patientssuffering from post-traumatic syndromes (30, 31, 32), chronic disease in general (33), duo-denal ulcer (35), and thyroid conditions (34) it {{became more and more}} apparent that a common denominator existed in the majority of these psy-chosomatic conditions. Symptomatology (33), per-sonality structure (40), as well as social techniques (37) of these patients pointed to a rather primitive level of psychologic organization. Further evidence for immaturity was found in the need for modifica-tion of psychotherapeutic procedures commonly employed in the treatment of <b>psychoneuroses</b> for use in the rehabilitation of these patients (33). The common denominator then was identified as re-lated to faulty or arrested maturation, and somatic manifestations were recognized as constituting means of infantile self-expression. In the present paper an attempt is^made to discuss the immature personality as related to psychosomatic conditions, thus providing {{a better understanding of the}} psy-chotherapeutic needs of these patients. Theoretical Considerations When an individual goes through the various phases of psycho-physical development and then breaks down, terms such as fixation and regression have been introduced to denote that the individual returned to previous levels of adjustment and gratification (18, 20), and if an individual ex-presses certain repressed conflicts by means of symbolic physical symptoms, this process is called conversion (19). Most of these concepts have been derived from the study of highly organized and complex types of <b>psychoneuroses</b> (15). Then, some years ago, the attention of the psychiatrist shifted to the psychosomatic conditions. Though the con-cept of conversion was separated from the concep...|$|R

He shaped the work conducted at Northfield Military Hospital by encouraging Harold Bridger to follow up on the group therapy work that Wilfred Bion and John Rickman had initiated, and by passing information on the Northfield experiments to Karl Menninger for the Journal of the Menninger Clinic.|$|R
