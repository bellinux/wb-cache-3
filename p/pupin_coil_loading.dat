40|$|Local {{specific}} absorption rate (SAR) evaluation in ultra high field (UHF) magnetic resonance (MR) systems is a major concern. In fact, at UHF, radiofrequency (RF) field inhomogeneity generates hot-spots that could cause localized tissue heating. Unfortunately, local SAR measurements are not available in present MR systems; thus, electromagnetic simulations must be performed for RF fields and SAR analysis. In this study, we used three-dimensional full-wave numerical electromagnetic simulations to investigate the dependence of local SAR at 7. 0 T with respect to subject size in two different scenarios: surface <b>coil</b> <b>loaded</b> by adult and child calves and quadrature volume <b>coil</b> <b>loaded</b> by adult and child heads.

In fact, at UHF, the energy deposition due to the radio-frequency (RF) field increases and its distribution inside the subject becomes extremely inhomogeneous and subject dependent. Local SAR measurements are not available in present MR systems; thus, electromagnetic simulations must be performed for RF fields and SAR analysis. In this study we resort to 3 D full wave numerical electromagnetic simulations for investigating the dependence of the local SAR at 7 T with respect to the subject size in two different scenarios: i) surface <b>coil</b> <b>loaded</b> by adults and children calves; ii) volume <b>coil</b> <b>loaded</b> by adults and children heads.

This paper investigated these two issues for STRAD systems applied in a large space lecture theatre. The simulation results revealed that best satisfied thermal environment was obtained when supplied air from floor level, terrace and desk-edge mounted grilles simultaneously. A new method for the calculation of the occupied zone cooling load, which is based on CFD (computational fluid dynamics) simulation was proposed and tried. The effective cooling load factor concept was further clarified, which can be conveniently used to calculate the occupied zone cooling load and then determine the supply airflow rate.

40|$|Accurate {{conversion}} of magnetic resonance spectra to quantitative units of concentration generally requires compensation {{for differences in}} <b>coil</b> <b>loading</b> conditions, the gains of the various receiver amplifiers, and rescaling that occurs during post-processing manipulations. This can be efficiently achieved by injecting a precalibrated, artificial reference signal, or pseudo-signal into the data. We have previously demonstrated, using in vitro measurements, that robust pseudo-signal injection can be accomplished using a second coil, called the injector coil, properly designed and oriented so that it couples inductively with the receive coil used to acquire the data. In this work, we acquired nonlocalized phosphorous magnetic resonance spectroscopy measurements from resting human tibialis anterior muscles and used pseudo-signal injection to calculate the Pi, PCr, and ATP concentrations. We compared these results to parallel estimates of concentrations obtained using the more established phantom replacement method.

40|$|In this paper, using a newly defined cooling <b>coil</b> <b>load</b> {{calculation}} method for stratified air distribution (STRAD) systems, {{the effects of}} separate location of the return and exhaust grilles on thermal comfort and energy saving are experimentally investigated. The results clearly demonstrated the extra energy saving potentials for STRAD systems with separate locations of return and exhaust grilles. After using the experimental results to validate our CFD method, numerical investigation is carried out for an office setting. Decreasing the height of return grille will increase exhaust air temperature and significantly reduce the cooling <b>coil</b> <b>load.</b> However, the risk of poor thermal comfort caused by too large temperature difference between the head and foot levels also increased, when the return inlet is located close to the floor level. Locating the exhaust grilles at ceiling level and close to external wall while locating the return grilles at the upper boundary of the occupied zone are recommended in practice. It is demonstrated that the purpose to simultaneously achieve satisfied thermal comfort and prominent energy saving can be attained with a STRAD system via deliberate locations of supply outlets and return and exhaust grilles {{in relation to the}} heat source locations.
