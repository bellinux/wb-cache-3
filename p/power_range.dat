5|$|With {{the fuel}} price {{increases}} of the 2000s, the EPA and many companies {{have sought to}} increase diesel truck fuel economy. One such example is the hydraulic hybrid vehicle, which stores energy in hydraulic tanks and hydraulic motors (as opposed to the electric hybrid vehicle which uses batteries and regenerative brakes). Electric hybrid vehicles are another option, with savings of 35 to 60 percent over traditional vehicles. Drivers themselves may improve fuel efficiency by using a method called progressive shifting, in which the driver shifts through the gears (typical trucks may have between 10 and 18 gears) {{in such a manner}} as to optimize the <b>power</b> <b>range</b> of the engine.|$|E

25|$|Through this period, {{studies of}} combat over Vietnam were {{producing}} worrying results. Previous doctrine had stressed long-range combat using missiles, and optimized aircraft for this role. The result was highly loaded aircraft with large radars and excellent speed, but limited maneuverability and often lacking a gun.

40|$|In this paper, a five-level {{multilevel}}-clamped multilevel converter (5 L-MLC 2) topology is analyzed {{based on}} a typical grid integration application for renewable energy system. The loss and thermal distributions of the power devices in different switching legs are investigated and illustrated under rated condition.

It is concluded that the loss and thermal distributions of the 5 L-MLC 2 multilevel topology are unequal between the clamping switching legs and the main switching legs; it also shows a good and consistent efficiency characteristic under different output <b>power</b> <b>ranges</b> when complying with the grid codes.
