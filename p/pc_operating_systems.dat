5|$|Curse of Enchantia {{was officially}} {{revealed}} under this title at the European Computer Trade Show (ECTS) in April 1992. The game was originally {{planned to be}} released in September 1992, but got delayed two months to November 1992. It was the first adventure game by Core Design as well {{as one of the first}} CD-ROM adventure games. Virgin Games bundled it with many of the earliest PC CD-ROM drives in 1993. It was also re-released on CD as part of Encore Multipack, together with Heimdall and Thunderhawk. The game's original release was accompanied by a promotional campaign with valuable prizes (computers and money) in some magazines such as France's Joystick. Owners of computers with newer <b>PC</b> <b>operating</b> <b>systems</b> need to run it using DOSBox.|$|E
25|$|The first <b>PC</b> <b>operating</b> <b>systems</b> to {{integrate}} such technology were Compaq DOS 3.31 (via CEMM) and Windows/386 2.1, both released in 1988. Since the 80286 version of Windows 2.0 (Windows/286), Windows applications {{did not suffer}} from the 640 KB barrier. Prior to DOS extenders, if a user installed additional memory and wished to use it under DOS, they would first have to install and configure drivers to support either expanded memory specification (EMS) or extended memory specification (XMS).|$|E
5|$|The {{original}} Pocket <b>PC</b> <b>operating</b> <b>system</b> {{had similar}} appearance to Windows 98, Windows Me, and Windows 2000 <b>operating</b> <b>systems.</b> Pocket <b>PC</b> 2000 is unsupported as of September 10, 2007.|$|R

25|$|Fueled by {{the promise}} of {{increasing}} returns, competition in two-sided network industries can be fierce. Platform leaders can leverage their higher margins to invest more in R or lower their prices, driving out weaker rivals. As a result, mature two-sided network industries are usually dominated by a handful of large platforms, {{as is the case in}} the credit card industry. In extreme situations, such as <b>PC</b> <b>operating</b> <b>systems,</b> a single company emerges as the winner, taking almost all of the market.|$|E
25|$|By {{the early}} 1990s, {{conflicts}} {{developed in the}} Microsoft/IBM relationship. They cooperated {{with each other in}} developing their <b>PC</b> <b>operating</b> <b>systems,</b> and had access to each other's code. Microsoft wanted to further develop Windows, while IBM desired for future work to be based on OS/2. In an attempt to resolve this tension, IBM and Microsoft agreed that IBM would develop OS/2 2.0, to replace OS/2 1.3 and Windows 3.0, while Microsoft would develop a new operating system, OS/2 3.0, to later succeed OS/2 2.0.|$|E
25|$|A {{lock screen}} is a {{computer}} user interface element used by various operating systems. They regulate immediate access to a device by requiring that the user perform a certain action {{in order to receive}} access, such as entering a password, using a certain button combination, or performing a certain gesture using a device's touchscreen. While most lock functions on <b>PC</b> <b>operating</b> <b>systems</b> only utilize a login screen, lock screens on mobile devices often provide more functionality beyond unlocking the phone: such as notifications for emails and text messages, a date and time display, or shortcuts to certain applications.|$|E

25|$|Following {{the release}} of Intel-based Macs, {{third-party}} platform virtualization software such as Parallels Desktop, VMware Fusion, and VirtualBox began to emerge. These programs allow users to run Microsoft Windows or previously Windows-only software on Macs at near native speed. Apple also released Boot Camp and Mac-specific Windows drivers that help users to install Windows XP or Vista and natively dual boot between Mac OS X and Windows. Though not condoned by Apple, {{it is possible to}} run the Linux operating system using Boot camp or other virtualization workarounds. Unlike most PCs, however, Macs are unable to run many legacy <b>PC</b> <b>operating</b> <b>systems.</b> In particular, Intel-based Macs lack the A20 gate.|$|E
25|$|While the H11 {{was popular}} with hard-core hobbyists, Heath {{engineers}} realized that DEC's PDP microprocessors {{would not be}} able to get Heath up the road to more powerful systems. Heath/Zenith then designed a dual Intel 8085/8088 based system dubbed the H100 (or Z-100, in preassembled form, sold by ZDS). The machine featured very advanced (for the day) bit mapped video that allowed up to 640 x 512 pixels of 8 color graphics. The H100 was interesting in that it could run either the CP/M operating system, or their OEM version of MS-DOS named Z-DOS, which were the two leading business <b>PC</b> <b>operating</b> <b>systems</b> at the time. Although the machine had to be rebooted to change modes, they could read each other's disks.|$|E
25|$|Microsoft {{entered the}} {{operating}} system (OS) business in 1980 with {{its own version of}} Unix, called Xenix. However, it was MS-DOS that solidified the company's dominance. After negotiations with Digital Research failed, IBM awarded a contract to Microsoft in November 1980 to provide a version of the CP/M OS, which was set {{to be used in the}} upcoming IBM Personal Computer (IBM PC). For this deal, Microsoft purchased a CP/M clone called 86-DOS from Seattle Computer Products, which it branded as MS-DOS, though IBM rebranded it to PC DOS. Following the release of the IBM PC in August 1981, Microsoft retained ownership of MS-DOS. Since IBM had copyrighted the IBM PC BIOS, other companies had to reverse engineer it in order for non-IBM hardware to run as IBM PC compatibles, but no such restriction applied to {{the operating system}}s. Due to various factors, such as MS-DOS's available software selection, Microsoft eventually became the leading <b>PC</b> <b>operating</b> <b>systems</b> vendor. The company expanded into new markets with the release of the Microsoft Mouse in 1983, as well as with a publishing division named Microsoft Press.|$|E

5000|$|Microsoft {{included}} a clause in its contract with IBM which permitted {{the sale of}} the finished <b>PC</b> <b>operating</b> <b>system</b> (<b>PC</b> DOS) to other computer manufacturers. These IBM competitors licensed it, as MS-DOS, in order to offer PC compatibility for less cost.|$|R

2500|$|In March 2004, the European Commission fined Microsoft for â‚¬497 million (about US$603 million) {{and ordered}} the company to provide a version of Windows without Windows Media Player. The Commission {{concluded}} that Microsoft [...] "broke European Union competition law by leveraging its near monopoly {{in the market for}} <b>PC</b> <b>operating</b> <b>systems</b> onto the markets for work group server operating systems and for media players." [...] Microsoft reached an agreement with the Commission where it would release a court-compliant version, Windows XP Edition N, that does not include the company's Windows Media Player but instead encourages users to download and install their preferred media player.|$|E
2500|$|Boot process. All Intel-based Macs {{have been}} using some version of EFI as the boot firmware. At the time the {{platform}} debuted in 2006, {{it was in a}} stark contrast to PCs, which almost universally employed legacy BIOS, and Apple's implementation of EFI did not initially implement the Compatibility Support Module that would allow booting contemporary standard <b>PC</b> <b>operating</b> <b>systems.</b> Apple updated the firmware with CSM support with the release of Boot Camp in April 2006, and since the release of Windows 8 in 2012, Microsoft has required its OEM partners to use UEFI boot process on PCs, which made the differences smaller.

50|$|Early <b>PC</b> <b>operating</b> <b>systems</b> such as MS-DOS and PC DOS, did {{not support}} {{multitasking}} at all, however alternative operating systems such as MP/M-86 (1981) and Concurrent CP/M-86 did support preemptive multitasking.
