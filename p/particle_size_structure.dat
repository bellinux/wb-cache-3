However, more recent reports indicate that these benefits were mostly contributed by dispersion processes, the “A” and “B” terms. The notion that solid core support materials provide a benefit to chromatographic performance by virtue of the A term (Eddy diffusion) is well supported with experimental data (Hayes et al. 2014). This is a very logical notion considering that the A term is directly related to <b>particle</b> <b>size,</b> <b>structure,</b> and packing efficiency of support particle of the column and solid core materials, pack better than fully porous materials. The solid core material provides a rougher surface and a better packing efficiency (Tanaka and McCalley 2016; Hayes et al. 2014).

Broad tongues and narrow filaments of cold, chlorophyll-rich water that extended over 100 km offshore were present in our study area. These features were bounded by the meandering coastal jet.

40|$|In the ocean, the {{perpetual}} 'snowfall' of biogenic marine particles exports organic carbon from the well-lit surface layer {{to the deep}} sediments, promoting its sequestration. The efficiency of this 'biological carbon pump' (BCP), presents strong spatio-temporal variations that are not yet fully explained. Changes in surface plankton communities and trophic interactions appear important because they lead to modifications of sinking particle characteristics (e. g. composition, structure, sinking velocity). These controls are explored here via the characterization of sinking particles originating from varying planktonic community structures and evaluation {{of their ability to}} export carbon. During the second KErguelen Ocean and Plateau compared Study (KEOPS 2) conducted in Oct. -Nov. 2011, six sites were sampled over and downstream of the Kerguelen Plateau (Southern Ocean), where a mosaic of phytoplankton blooms of changing communities forms in response to natural iron fertilisation. Sinking particles were collected with free-drifting sediment traps at four mesopelagic depths to examine their form and composition, including optical characterization using polyacrylamide gel filled traps. Concurrently, aggregates were formed in roller tanks from surface water phytoplankton assemblages, to explore the intricate influences of <b>particle</b> <b>size,</b> <b>structure</b> and composition on the sinking velocity. At each site, carbon export efficiencies were calculated as the ratio of carbon flux to net primary productivity (e-ratio). High productivity was associated with the lowest carbon export efficiency (e-ratio 0. 02) while maximum export efficiency (e-ratio 0. 2) was found at low-productivity sites. Two explanations were identified. Firstly, at high-biomass sites, strong zooplankton grazing generated large fecal pellets sustaining high carbon fluxes at 100 - 200 m (180 mg C m⁻² d⁻¹). This export pathway represented a 'dead end' due to rapid attenuation of the fecal pellet flux at 200 - 400 m, releasing most of the carbon (48 ± 21...|$|E
40|$|Resumen del trabajo presentado a la Radiation Protection Week, celebrada en Oxford (UK) del 19 al 23 de septiembre de 2016. [...] et al. A major {{fraction}} of refractory radionuclides such as uranium (U) and plutonium (Pu) {{released to the}} environment from the nuclear weapon and fuel cycles is present as particles ranging from submicrons to fragments. Such particles can carry {{a substantial amount of}} radioactivity (e. g., fission and activation products, transuranics) and associated metals, and can act as point sources. Furthermore, U particles (progenies, metals) are ALSO present at NORM sites. Research indicates that particle characteristics such as composition, atom and element ratios depend on the emitting source, while <b>particle</b> <b>size,</b> <b>structure</b> and oxidation states are closely linked to the release scenarios. Following deposition, ecosystem transfer of particle associated radionuclides are delayed compared to mobile radionuclide species; i. e., ecosystem transfer would be delayed until particle weathering and remobilisation of associated radionuclides occur. The apparent soil-water distribution coefficient (Kd) will therefore change over time, and the thermodynamic constant concept should be replaced with rate functions. Thus, RATE project focuses on particle characteristics, weathering rates, remobilization and prediction of ecosystem transfer of radionuclides associated with U and/or Pu containing particles originating from selected key sources (nuclear weapons tests, safety tests, conventional detonation of nuclear or DU weapons, nuclear reactor accident, NORM). Utilizing advanced techniques, leaching experiments in which well characterized particles are exposed to abiotic and biotic degradation agents are being performed under different temperature conditions of relevance for the Arctic and for temperate zones. The parameterization should reduce uncertainties in model predictions on ecosystem transfer and environmental impact associated with particle contaminated areas, linking particle properties to sources, and linking particle properties to weathering rates under different environmental conditions. In this presentation, the objectives of the project will be detailed, the progress achieved until now during the 20 months of project running will be summarized and the main results will be highlighted.

40|$|Heterometallic {{catalysts}} {{are important}} in large-scale industrial production of green fuels, chemicals and industrial effluent treatment. The efficiency of a heterometallic catalyst {{is dependent on the}} molecular homogeneity, surface-morphological properties and metal compositions. These features are being enhanced with recent developments in nanotechnology. Currently, several chemical methods are available and more methods are being developed or modified to synthesize nano heterometallic catalysts. However, obtaining the required features remains a challenging task as the physical and chemical properties of nanoparticles differ significantly when used in bulk. To overcome this challenge, several researchers have developed nano-size heterometallic catalysts via Metal Organic Frameworks (MOFs) methods. In these methods, metals are attached to a suitable organic framework (ligand). However, these methods are not suitable for the synthesis {{of a wide range of}} heterometallic catalysts as each of these methods only produces a specific type of catalyst, which limits their use for industrial applications. Therefore, there is a need to develop a suitable method that can formulate a wide range of nano-size heterometallic catalysts for industrial processes. In this work, a two-step chemical process was developed and used to synthesize nano-size heterometallic catalysts. In the first step, precipitation method was effectively employed to produce monometallic and polymetallic complexes. 2, 2 '-bipyridine was used as the ligand to interlink metal atoms (Ni, Zn, Fe, Cu and Al). In the second stage, heterometallic complexes were thermally decomposed to produce nano oxide clusters. The crystalline products were characterized for <b>particle</b> <b>size,</b> <b>structure,</b> morphology, surface area and thermogravimetric property. The two-step process was found to greatly improve the size, morphology and yields of the crystalline materials. The yield of Ni, Zn and Al clusters were 81 %, 80 % and 78 % respectively, while the yield of Ni-Zn, Zn-Al and Ni-Zn-Al complexes were 85 %, 78. 5 % and 77 % respectively. The two-step process was further utilized to produce supported type catalyst where Fe-ZSM- 5, Fe-Zn-ZSM- 5, and Fe-Zn-Cu-ZSM- 5 heterogeneous catalysts were produced. Subsequently, the catalysts were used to treat wastewater containing organic recalcitrant contaminants (through Fenton oxidation process) and to produce biogasoline from palm oil. In the Fenton oxidation process, about 99 % of color removal and 77 % of total organic content (TOC) reduction were obtained. These values were significantly higher than the reported values in literature. When the same catalyst was used in the production of bio gasoline, the yield was about 56 %, which was almost more than 8 % compared to the literature values. The leaching analysis of the catalyst for the Fenton oxidation process revealed that only less than 2 ppm of the metals were leached after a single use, which was in the permissible range as a heterometallic catalyst. Therefore, the present study proved that the newly developed two-step process was efficient and economical to produce heterometallic catalysts, which have a great potential for wastewater treatments and green energy applications due to higher degree of uniformity. In addition, availability of ligand (2, 2 '-bipyridine), solvents (ethanol, 2 -proapnol and DMF) and their relevant information in the literature makes this 2 -step process an attractive process for the production of a variety of heterometallic catalysts...|$|E

The objective of this project is to develop an effective, simple and economical technical route for synthesis of nanosized iron oxide and titanium oxide particles/rods/films. The approach and the progress are outlined as follows. Based on extensive literature reading on the project related area, a novel self-assembling technical route for iron oxide nanostructure and architecture was proposed which has been confirmed to be effective. Detailed experimental investigation on the synthesis of nanoparticles/rods, and instrumental characterization of the <b>particle</b> <b>size,</b> <b>structure,</b> and crystallites, etc. via TEM, FESEM, XRD, FTIR, UV, SQUID are conducted. Uniform nanorods of hematite iron oxide and titanium oxide nanospheres, and anatase TiO 2 thin film with micropores have been successfully achieved. Some preliminary exploration for applications of the synthesized nanomaterials has also been carried out. Firstly, a novel assembled scheme of iron oxide nanostructure and architecture by selfassembling process was investigated. The sol-gel technical route was employed to synthesize nearly uniform nanorods of hematite particles. Morphologies and physicochemical properties of iron oxide nanostructure were characterized by analytical instrument. Secondly, titanium oxide nanospheres were synthesized via a hydrothermal process using titanium isopropoxide as the precursor. Titanium oxide nanospheres with inner nanospace andhighly organized crystallites in the shell structure and surface regions were synthesized. It demonstrated that the technical route developed in this work has a high versatility for structural engineering of various targeted morphological products. Thirdly, a simple process of preparing anatase TiO 2 thin film with micropores was pursued. The synthesized nano thin film with micropores was used for the material of dye-sensitive solar cell; and effective electron transfer of titanium oxide electrode was confirmed by electrochemical voltammetry. Preparation of the titanium oxide electrode and its electrochemical analysis was studied. The application of the titanium oxide of microporous thin film material as a promoter for electrochemistry voltammetry measuring system was explored in this thesis.

40|$|Mesoporous silica {{nanoparticles}} (MSNs) are {{a versatile}} {{drug delivery system}} {{that can be used}} for loading of different guest molecules such as peptides, proteins, anticancer agents, and genetic material. MSNs are considered promising drug carriers due to their tuneable <b>particle</b> <b>size,</b> pore <b>structure,</b> and surface functionalization. Thus, MSNs provide opportunities for their effective application in a wide variety of fields. In the current review, we discuss both conventional and advanced MSNs synthesis methods, including their applications for drug delivery, gatekeepers, and biosensors. In addition, the research progress in biocompatibility, cytotoxicity, and internalization mechanisms is reported...|$|R
40|$|Polypyrrole nanocomposites were preapraed {{to study}} some {{characteristics}} such as morphology and chemical structure. Polypyrrole nanocomposites have been prepared to in aqueous and aqueous/nonaqueous media by chemical oxidative polymerization using ferric chloride as an oxidant and {{in the presence of}} various surfactants such as sodium dodecylbenzenesulfonate, poly (vinyl alcohol) and hydroxypropylcellulose. The nanocomposites were characterized in terms of morphology, <b>particle</b> <b>size,</b> chemical <b>structure</b> and glass transition temperature. The morphology of products was characterized by using Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM). The results indicate that the surface morphology and <b>particle</b> <b>size</b> are dependent on the type of surfactant. Also the chemical structure and glass transition temperature of product were determined by fouriertransform infrared spectroscopy and differential scanning calorimetry respectively...|$|R
40|$|The {{synthesis}} of PbZr 0. 5 Ti 0. 5 O 3 ceramics from {{the raw materials}} was reinvestigated {{in order to find}} relations in the characterizations for the products in various stages of the preparation procedure. Techniques used were <b>particle</b> <b>size</b> measurements, X-ray powder diffractometry, density and dielectric constant measurements and scanning electron microscopy. The results show, that the <b>particle</b> <b>size</b> and <b>structure</b> of ZrO 2 determine the inhomogeneity, expressed as xt/xr, of the calcination product. An inhomogeneous calcination product sintered at relatively low temperatures results in an inhomogeneous ceramic of low density. Using high sintering temperatures and long periods of time an inhomogeneous calcination product converts into a dense (> 97 %) and homogeneous ceramic...|$|R

40|$|This study {{addresses}} the formulation effects of carbon black type and carbon black loading {{on the physical}} properties of electrospun butyl rubber nonwoven membranes. These membranes are envisioned as a potential breathable barrier layer in chemical and biological (CB) protective garments. The advantages of an electrospun crosslinked elastomer system, when compared to similarly prepared thermoplastics, are increased flexibility, durability, and chemical resistance. The porosity and surface area of these membranes {{are directly related to}} the water vapor transmission, air flow resistance, aerosol resistance, and the transport of chemical vapors. The barrier properties will be affected by the ability to control pore sizes, fiber diameter, permeability, and physical properties through formulation and process variables. Experimental results reveal that fiber diameter decreased with decreasing carbon black <b>particle</b> <b>size</b> and increasing carbon black structure. Density of the electrospun mats decreased with smaller <b>particle</b> <b>size</b> and higher <b>structure.</b> Decreasing carbon black <b>particle</b> <b>size</b> and increasing <b>structure</b> showed increased stress at break, ultimate elongation and modulus of the membranes. Good dispersion of smaller carbon black size and higher carbon black structure lead to decreased electrical resistance and increased ultimate strength...|$|R

30|$|This review {{presents}} {{an introduction to}} the synthesis of metallic nanoparticles by radiation-induced method, especially gamma irradiation. This method offers some benefits over the conventional methods because it provides fully reduced and highly pure nanoparticles free from by-products or chemical reducing agents, and is capable of controlling the <b>particle</b> <b>size</b> and <b>structure.</b> The nucleation and growth mechanism of metallic nanoparticles are also discussed. The competition between nucleation and growth process in the formation of nanoparticles can determine the size of nanoparticles which is influenced by certain parameters such as the choice of solvents and stabilizer, the precursor to stabilizer ratio, pH during synthesis, and absorbed dose.|$|R
30|$|In summary, {{nitrogen}} doped SrTiO 3 nanoparticles with controlled <b>particle</b> <b>size,</b> electronic <b>structure</b> {{and efficient}} visible light driven photocatalytic activity toward Cr(VI) were successfully prepared by a solvothermal method. XRD, BET and TEM analyses indicated that nitrogen doped SrTiO 3 nanoparticles with cube-like morphology exhibited an apparent lattice expansion, <b>particle</b> <b>size</b> reduction {{as well as}} subsequent increase of BET surface area via nitrogen doping. The visible light absorption edge and intensity can be modulated by nitrogen doping content, which absorption edge extends to about 600  nm. Moreover, nitrogen doping can not only modulate the visible light absorption feature, but also have consequence on the enhancement of charge separation efficiency, which can promote the photocatalytic activity. With well controlled <b>particle</b> <b>size,</b> BET surface area, and electronic structure via nitrogen doping, the visible light driven photocatalytic performance toward Cr(VI) reduction of nitrogen doped SrTiO 3 was optimized at initial HMT content of 2. Such a finding may help to provide hints for developing and designing new photocatalytic semiconductors.|$|R
40|$|Noble metal {{nanostructures}} {{on different}} length scales exhibit {{a variety of}} optical properties ranging from plasmon resonance 1 and Raman enhancement 2 to fluoescence, 3 providing novel opportunities for bioimaging and sensing. 4 In a regime where the <b>particle</b> <b>size</b> is on the same order of the electron Fermi wavelength (∼ 0. 5 nm for silver and gold), metal nanoparticles (NPs) often display strong single-electron excitations and emit fluorescence. 3 However, as <b>particle</b> <b>size</b> approaches electron mean free path length (∼ 50 nm for silver and gold), fluorescence usually disappears and, instead, collective excita-tions of electrons become dominant, leading to plasmon resonance. Large Raman enhancements have also been observed from nanoclus-ters 5 and NPs 6 of noble metals. It has been shown recently that electron-phonon interactions within metal NPs can be modified by the crystallinity. 7 Thus, control of the <b>particle</b> <b>size</b> and <b>structure</b> is a powerful strategy to modulate electronic structures and optical proper...|$|R
