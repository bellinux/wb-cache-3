40|$|This study {{examined}} 4 - to 5 -year-old English-speaking children’s inter-pretations of sentences containing negation, the universal quantifier, and disjunction. Disjunction is assigned two different meanings in such sentences depending on {{its position in}} surface syntax: in the subject phrase of ‘not every’ (e. g., not every <b>passenger</b> <b>who</b> ordered chicken or beef became ill), a disjunctive meaning is assigned to disjunction (e. g. at least one <b>passenger</b> <b>who</b> ordered chicken OR at least one <b>passenger</b> <b>who</b> ordered beef became ill); in the predicate phrase of ‘not every’ (e. g., not every <b>passenger</b> <b>who</b> became ill ordered chicken or beef), a conjunctive meaning is assigned (e. g., at least one <b>passenger</b> <b>who</b> became ill did not order chicken AND did not order beef). If children bring knowledge of combinatory logical principles {{to the task of}} language acquisition, then they should be sensitive to this asymmetry. We tested this prediction using a truth-value judgment task...|$|R

5|$|In 1871, eight {{main line}} {{railways}} existed in Berlin, with terminal stations at the city's edge {{or outside the}} city limits. This was very impractical for many <b>passengers,</b> <b>who</b> were forced to use hackney carriages to transfer from one train to another. Therefore, a railway line was planned to connect these terminuses with each other.|$|E

5|$|Gordon Ramsay Plane Food {{is located}} on the sixth floor of Terminal 5 within Heathrow Airport, London, next to the Wagamama {{restaurant}}.

The chef patron of the restaurant is Stuart Giles, who had previously worked at Ramsay's Boxwood Cafe. Since September 2015 Executive Chef is Andrew Winstanley.|$|E

5|$|After announcing Gotham will {{be subject}} to his rule come nightfall, the Joker rigs two {{evacuating}} ferries with explosives; one containing civilians and the other containing prisoners. He says that he will blow them both up by midnight, but will let one live if its <b>passengers</b> (<b>who</b> have been supplied the trigger to the other boat's explosives) blow up the other. Batman finds the Joker with a sonar device that spies on the entire city, with the reluctant help of Lucius Fox. Both the civilians and the prisoners refuse to kill each other, while Batman apprehends the Joker after a brief fight. Before the police arrive to take the Joker into custody, he gloats that Gotham's citizens will lose hope once Dent's rampage becomes public knowledge.|$|E
5|$|By early 2016, delays as {{a result}} of {{overcrowding}} were up to more than 20,000 every month, four times the amount in 2012. The overcrowded trains have resulted in an increase of assaults because of tense commuters. With less platform space, more passengers are forced to be {{on the edge of the}} platform resulting in the increased possibility of passengers falling on the track. One possible solution that the MTA is considering is platform screen doors, which exist on the AirTrain JFK to prevent passengers from falling onto the tracks. In order to prevent hitting <b>passengers</b> <b>who</b> could fall onto the tracks, train operators are being instructed to go into stations at lower speeds. The increased proximity of riders could result in the spread of contagious diseases.|$|E
5|$|Concorde was jointly {{developed}} and manufactured by Sud Aviation (later Aérospatiale) and the British Aircraft Corporation (BAC) under an Anglo-French treaty. Twenty aircraft were built, including six prototypes and development aircraft. Air France (AF) and British Airways (BA) {{were the only}} airlines to purchase and fly Concorde. The aircraft was used mainly by wealthy <b>passengers</b> <b>who</b> could afford to pay a high price in exchange for Concorde's speed and luxury service. For example, in 1997, the round-trip ticket price from New York to London was $7995, more than 30 times {{the cost of the}} cheapest option to fly this route.|$|E

5|$|Greyhound Express routes are {{assigned}} new or refurbished buses that {{are equipped with}} Wi-Fi, power outlets, leather seats, and extra legroom. In many stations Greyhound Express customers {{can take advantage of}} dedicated waiting areas, separate from passengers traveling on other Greyhound services or other carriers. Some stations also board passengers onto Greyhound Express buses using numbers printed on tickets. This number is assigned in the order in which the ticket was purchased, which means that <b>passengers</b> <b>who</b> bought their tickets earlier get to board the bus and choose their seats earlier.|$|E
5|$|On October 7, 1908, Edith Berg, {{the wife}} of the brothers' European {{business}} agent, became the first American woman passenger when she flew with Wilbur—one of many <b>passengers</b> <b>who</b> rode with him that autumn.

Bollée was the owner of an automobile factory where Wilbur would assemble the Flyer and where he would be provided with hired assistance. Bollée would fly that autumn with Wilbur. Madame Bollée had been in the latter stages of pregnancy when Wilbur arrived in LeMans in June 1908 to assemble the Flyer. Wilbur promised her that he would make his first European flight the day her baby was born which he did, August 8, 1908.|$|E
