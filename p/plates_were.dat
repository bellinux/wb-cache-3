5|$|The plates lie flat {{along the}} back, as a shingle-like armor. This was Marsh's initial interpretation, {{which led to}} the name 'roof lizard'. As further and {{complete}} <b>plates</b> <b>were</b> found, their form showed they stood on edge, rather than lying flat.|$|E
5|$|The <b>plates</b> <b>were</b> paired in {{a double}} row along the back. This is {{probably}} the most common arrangement in illustrations, especially earlier ones. The Stegosaurus in the 1933 film, King Kong, has this arrangement.|$|E

40|$|A rotary {{capacitor}} {{can be used}} in {{the experiment}} of Demonstration 19 to show how the capacitance changes as the overlap between the <b>plates</b> <b>is</b> changed. Using the apparatus of Figure 1, the potential across the charged plates of the rotary capacitor is observed to decrease as the <b>plates</b> <b>are</b> overlapped (or increase as the <b>plates</b> <b>are</b> separated), indicating that the capacitance increases as the <b>plates</b> <b>are</b> overlapped and decreases as the <b>plates</b> <b>are</b> separated...|$|R
5|$|The {{spandrel}} <b>plates</b> <b>were</b> {{welded to}} the columns {{to create the}} modular pieces off-site at the fabrication shop. The modular pieces were typically 52inches (1.3m) deep, and extended for two full floors and half of two more floors. Adjacent modules were bolted together, with the splices occurring at mid-span of the columns and spandrels. The spandrel <b>plates</b> <b>were</b> located at each floor, transmitting shear stress between columns, allowing them {{to work together in}} resisting lateral loads. The joints between modules were staggered vertically, so the column splices between adjacent modules were not at the same floor.|$|E
5|$|When Magnum XL-200 opened, it used pads {{similar to}} those still in use on Gemini. Shortly after its debut, however, these up-stop <b>plates</b> <b>were</b> {{replaced}} with more traditional up-stop wheels that keep the train from flying off its rails.|$|E
5|$|After its sale to the Royal Scot Locomotive and General Trust, 70000 was {{overhauled}} at Crewe {{and returned}} to the main line in 2011 (its 60th anniversary), initially in unlined black without name plates as originally outshopped in 1951 (the <b>plates</b> <b>were</b> first fitted for the Festival of Britain later that year).|$|E

5|$|Holographic {{interferometry}} {{was discovered}} by accident {{as a result of}} mistakes committed during the making of holograms. Early lasers were relatively weak and photographic <b>plates</b> <b>were</b> insensitive, necessitating long exposures during which vibrations or minute shifts might occur in the optical system. The resultant holograms, which showed the holographic subject covered with fringes, were considered ruined.|$|E
5|$|Over one {{thousand}} <b>plates</b> <b>were</b> included in The Indian Antiquary and the Epigraphia Indica {{over the first}} fifty years of publication, but having the illustrations produced abroad was not without its disadvantages. On one occasion during World War I, enemy action meant that expensive plates had to be sent from London three times before they reached Bombay safely.|$|E
5|$|She {{had enjoyed}} {{developing}} {{the book with}} Warne, and, on July 2, sent him {{the remainder of the}} book, expressing her regret that its production was over. On July 25, proofs sent to her from the publisher showed spottiness that may have been caused by the summer heat affecting the chemicals used in the engraving process; the <b>plates</b> <b>were</b> re-engraved in September.|$|E
50|$|The {{appearances}} of <b>plates</b> <b>are</b> frequently chosen to contain symbols, colors, or slogans {{associated with the}} issuing jurisdiction. The term license <b>plate</b> <b>is</b> frequently used in statutes, although in some areas tag is informally used. Registration <b>plate</b> <b>is</b> another synonym.|$|R
50|$|The Easter <b>Plate</b> <b>is</b> a small (550 km x 410 km) {{tectonic plate}} or {{microplate}} {{in the southeastern}} Pacific. The <b>plate</b> <b>is</b> bounded on the west by the Pacific Plate, and the east by the Nazca Plate. The entire <b>plate</b> <b>is</b> covered by the Pacific Ocean. Easter <b>Plate</b> <b>is</b> named after Easter Island which is {{to the east of}} it on the adjacent Nazca Plate.|$|R
30|$|The global <b>plate</b> model <b>is</b> the {{assembly}} of two plates, ω ^inf and ω ^sup respectively the lower plate and the top plate, and a rigid connector between them ω ^conn Fig.  1 (left). The <b>plates</b> <b>are</b> 20  mm thick and 280   mm long. The lower <b>plate</b> <b>is</b> 160  mm wide whereas and the top <b>plate</b> <b>is</b> 80  mm wide. In order to simplify the presentation, the <b>plates</b> <b>are</b> assumed to be made out of homogeneous isotropic linear elastic material with Young modulus E = 200 GPa and Poisson ratio ν = 0.3; the handling of orthotropic composite <b>plates</b> <b>is</b> explained in [21].|$|R
5|$|The English {{language}} {{editions of}} Potter's little books still bore the Frederick Warne imprint in 2010 {{though the company}} was bought by Penguin Books in 1983. The printing <b>plates</b> <b>were</b> remade by Penguin from new photographs of the original drawings in 1985, and all 23 volumes released in 1987 as The Original and Authorized Edition.|$|E
5|$|When {{construction}} of the shell began in June 2004, a large tent was erected around the piece to shield it from public view. Construction began with the omphalos, where <b>plates</b> <b>were</b> attached to the supporting internal steel structure, from the inside (underside) of the sculpture downward to the outermost surfaces. This sequence caused the structure to resemble a large sombrero when the bottom was complete.|$|E
5|$|After the war, the Mimoyecques site lay abandoned. Much of the {{equipment}} left by the Germans was disposed of as scrap metal. A complete set of four steel plates, weighing 60 tons, that were intended to protect the entrances to the drifts were bought by {{the manager of the}} Hidrequent-Rixent quarries to be cut up for use in rock-crushing machinery. Rediscovered by local historians in the 1990s, they remained at the quarries until 2010, when the surviving <b>plates</b> <b>were</b> returned to Mimoyecques, where they are now on display.|$|E

5000|$|EU format <b>plates</b> <b>are</b> either {{white or}} yellow, {{on a plate}} wider than it is tall. Yellow {{registration}} <b>plates</b> <b>are</b> used both front and rear in Luxembourg and the Netherlands. In Gibraltar, the United Kingdom and Cyprus, yellow <b>plates</b> <b>are</b> used at the rear and white at the front. The UK use flat plastic plates (embossed metal <b>plates</b> <b>are</b> an option in the UK), as opposed to metal plates in most other European countries. A mixture of plastic or metal <b>plates</b> <b>is</b> permitted in France and Ireland. Plastic plates have earlier also been used in Sweden and Norway ...|$|R
50|$|A minor {{difference}} between the 2007- and the 1992-standard <b>plates</b> <b>is</b> that the separator dot between the regional code and the serial on 2007-standard <b>plates</b> <b>is</b> embossed along the characters, while that on 1992-standard <b>plates</b> <b>are</b> pressed into the plate, {{in the opposite direction}} of the characters.|$|R
5|$|As {{printing}} became available, it {{was promptly}} used to publish herbals, the first printed matter being known as incunabula. In Europe, the first printed herbal with woodcut (xylograph) illustrations, the Puch der Natur of Konrad of Megenberg, appeared in 1475. Metal-engraved <b>plates</b> <b>were</b> first used in about 1580. As woodcuts and metal engravings could be reproduced indefinitely they were traded among printers: there was therefore a large {{increase in the}} number of illustrations together with an improvement in quality and detail but a tendency for repetition.|$|E
5|$|By 1891, Marsh {{published}} a more familiar view of Stegosaurus, {{with a single}} row of plates. This was dropped fairly early on (apparently because it was poorly understood how the <b>plates</b> <b>were</b> embedded in the skin and they were thought to overlap too much in this arrangement). It was revived, in somewhat modified form, in the 1980s, by Stephen Czerkas, based on the arrangement of iguana dorsal spines.|$|E
5|$|In 1963, Gascoigne {{developed}} a device, {{known as an}} optical corrector plate, which allowed wide field photography on the new 40-inch telescope at Siding Spring. Such corrector <b>plates</b> <b>were</b> subsequently used on many telescopes and became known as Gascoigne correctors. During this period he was also active in supporting {{the establishment of a}} national research organisation for astronomers, the Astronomical Society of Australia. It held its first meeting in 1966, and Gascoigne was made its first vice-president.|$|E
50|$|Industrial {{hot plates}} which {{incorporate}} a porous heated <b>plate</b> <b>are</b> {{referred to as}} heated chucks. These <b>plates</b> <b>are</b> used to heat thin films evenly by drawing the film firmly on the plate with a vacuum. These <b>plates</b> <b>are</b> widely used {{in the process of}} manufacturing semiconductors.|$|R
50|$|Spreader <b>plates</b> <b>are</b> thin steel <b>plates</b> {{with holes}} {{through which the}} arbor {{connecting}} rods pass. Spreader <b>plates</b> <b>are</b> lowered onto the counterweights in a distributed fashion as the counterweight stack is being built. Typically one spreader <b>plate</b> <b>is</b> placed on top of every two feet of counterweight in the stack. Finally, a locking <b>plate</b> <b>is</b> lowered onto the completed, interleaved stack of counterweights and spreader plates and secured in place with a thumbscrew.|$|R
50|$|The <b>plate</b> <b>is</b> {{white on}} dark green. To {{distinguish}} {{the type of}} the <b>plate,</b> there <b>is</b> the letter پ which stands for the word پلیس, meaning police in Persian put on the plate. The code in the square represents the regional codes. The letter پ on the <b>plate</b> <b>is</b> fixed for all police cars and these types of <b>plates</b> <b>are</b> issued provincially.|$|R
