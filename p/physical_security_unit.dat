Tel: 08 9370 6761. p. hosie@ecu. edu. au Rises in the incidence of global terrorism have underscored the need for high quality professional education in security risk and security technology. As a result, the demand is high for Security Science courses in the national and international contexts. Edith Cowan University delivers professional education for the protection of assets at international and national domains.

The <b>Physical</b> <b>Security</b> <b>unit</b> is used to illustrate {{the development of the}} online learning strategies and interactive activities. Learning materials developed for this course have unique attributes as they were specifically designed to provide simulations and interactivity in the learning process. Field scenarios have been developed for the activities to make the learning experiences as realistic as possible. Simulations and graphics provide these experiences, together with security site images for actual security barriers, systems and technologies. Features of units in the course include graphics, simulations, and video clips to present learning aspects of security that are not normally available to students. Education about terroris...|$|E

50|$|The {{function}} of security departments {{has traditionally been}} to secure people and buildings, and {{has been slow to}} absorb new technology, relying more on manned guards and physical barriers. As Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) evolves to address all security and legislative risks across all stakeholders, <b>physical</b> <b>security</b> departments have come under increased scrutiny. Numerous examples of <b>physical</b> <b>security</b> breaches leading to major organizational losses, both in terms of assets and brand damage have led to <b>physical</b> <b>security</b> reporting to board level. Globally, new roles have been created within large organizations where Chief Information Security Officers (CISO), have responsibility for ERM, including <b>physical</b> <b>security.</b> Subsequently, management reporting, policy compliance and KPIs have entered the <b>physical</b> <b>security</b> function, requiring more efficient working practices and monitoring tools.
