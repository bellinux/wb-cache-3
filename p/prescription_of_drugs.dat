Landy surrendered his psychological license, complying with an agreement made with the state of California, and was not allowed applications for reinstatement for the next two years. An August 1988 board meeting with the Beach Boys had Landy promising that Brian would reconnect with the group, which Love says: [...] "was a ruse to get us to write a letter in his defense against the California authorities. We never wrote the letter, and Brian's public behavior continued to unsettle."

40|$|Introduction: The need {{to manage}} {{psychological}} symptoms after disasters {{can result in}} an increase in the <b>prescription</b> <b>of</b> psychotropic <b>drugs,</b> including antidepressants and anxiolytics. Therefore, an increase in the <b>prescription</b> <b>of</b> antidepressants and anxiolytics could be an indicator of general psychological distress in the community. Purpose: The {{purpose of this study was}} to determine if there was a change in the rate <b>of</b> <b>prescription</b> <b>of</b> antidepressant and anxiolytic drugs following Cyclone Yasi. Methods: A quantitative evaluation <b>of</b> new <b>prescriptions</b> <b>of</b> antidepressants and anxiolytics was conducted. The total number <b>of</b> new <b>prescriptions</b> for these drugs was calculated for the period six months after the cyclone and compared with the same six month period in the preceding year. Two control drugs were also included to rule out changes in the general rate <b>of</b> <b>drug</b> <b>prescription</b> in the affected communities. Results: After Cyclone Yasi, there was an increase in the <b>prescription</b> <b>of</b> antidepressant <b>drugs</b> across all age and gender groups in the affected communities except for males 14 - 54 years <b>of</b> age. The <b>prescription</b> <b>of</b> anxiolytic <b>drugs</b> decreased immediately after the cyclone, but increased by the end of the six-month post-cyclone period.

50|$|In May 1986, Manhattan District Attorney Robert Morgenthau {{agreed to}} let a grand jury {{consider}} murder charges, an unusual decision for a medical malpractice case. Although the jury declined to indict for murder, in 1987 the intern and resident were charged with 38 counts of gross negligence and/or gross incompetence. The grand jury considered that a series of mistakes contributed to Zion's death, including the improper <b>prescription</b> <b>of</b> <b>drugs</b> {{and the failure to}} perform adequate diagnostic tests. Under New York law, the investigative body for these charges was the Hearing Committee of the State Board for Professional Medical Conduct. Between April 1987 and January 1989, the committee conducted 30 hearings at which 33 witnesses testified, including expert witnesses in toxicology, emergency medicine, and chairmen of internal medicine departments at six prominent medical schools, several of whom stated under oath that they had never heard of the interaction between meperidine and phenelzine prior to this case.

5000|$|In 1965, {{the legal}} <b>prescription</b> <b>of</b> <b>drugs</b> began in Stockholm, after a {{campaign}} strongly supported by Expressen, the biggest newspaper in Sweden in the 1960s. Some doctors received {{the right to}} prescribe drugs, such as amphetamine and morphine, to addicts. The idea was that doctors would {{have the right to}} prescribe the drug to chronic addicts in order to reduce their propensity to commit crimes. An inspiration for this movement was a book, The Addict and the Law, written by American sociologist Alfred R. Lindesmith. The Legal Prescription Program was controversial from the start; the users were allowed to determine the dosage and were given a few days ration with an option to refill when needed. More than 4 million normal doses were prescribed. A number of the clients were former prison inmates. Eventually, police seizures showed that the drugs had become available to persons not involved in the project. Nils Bejerot, who opposed the prescriptions and worked as consulting physician to the Stockholm Remand Prison, conducted studies of injections marks from drug abuse at the prison which indicated a strong {{increase in the number of}} intravenous drug users during the experiment.
