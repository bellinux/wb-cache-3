This kind of brace has a great tendency to out of plane buckling. So, {{due to the lack of}} formal regulations, analyzing out of <b>plane</b> effective <b>length</b> of its members is important. In this paper, buckling load of 15 one-story frames is obtained and then out of <b>plane</b> effective <b>length</b> factor of the longer member is calculated. Finally, as buckling of one of the members causes the system to lose its stability, the mentioned effective length factor is introduced as out of <b>plane</b> effective <b>length</b> factor for all OBS members...|$|R
40|$|Numerical {{algorithms}} {{are presented}} {{to estimate the}} length, width and slope of rectangular planes representing irregularly shaped overland contributing areas defined on raster Digital Elevation Models (DEM). The strength of the procedure lies in that each flow path on the raster overland area is considered in {{the determination of the}} representative value for the entire rectangular plane as opposed to relying on a lumped, single flow path approach. The flow path parameters required by the algorithms are derived from raster maps of elevation (DEM), flow direction and upstream area. Qualitative cause-effect relations between flow path and runoff characteristics are used to emphasize those flow paths that are important to runoff formation and propagation. Based upon these considerations, the <b>plane</b> <b>length</b> and slope are computed as a weighted mean flow path length and slope over all flow paths of the overland area. Several alternative weighting factors are proposed. Based on area conservation, the plane width is computed as the overland area divided by the <b>plane</b> <b>length...</b>|$|R

40|$|In this article, {{the design}} of a {{dual-band}} slim inverted-F antenna with an enhanced operational bandwidth is presented. Initially, a slim inverted-F antenna for operation in 850 and 1900 MHz bands supported by a large ground plane of 120 × 40 mm is introduced. This antenna offers dual band operation but with narrow bandwidth around each desired frequency. To reduce its ground <b>plane</b> <b>length</b> to 90 mm as well as to improve its operational bandwidth, a ground slot and a strip are introduced.

The proposed antenna was designed on a ceramic-filled bioplastic sandwich substrate with a high dielectric constant. The proposed 7 × 6 element, square-shaped, single-sided MSS significantly improved the bandwidth and gain of the proposed antenna. The proposed MSS incorporated a slotted patch antenna that effectively increased the measured operating bandwidth from 13. 3 % to 18. 8 % and from 14. 8 % to 23. 2 % in the lower and upper bands, respectively. Moreover, the average gain of the proposed MSS-based antenna was enhanced from 2. 12 dBi to 3. 02 dBi in the lower band and from 4. 10 dBi to 5. 28 dBi in the upper band compared to the patch antenna alone. In addition to the bandwidth and gain improvements, more directive radiation characteristics were also observed from the MSS antenna compared to the patch itself.

Researchers at the NASA Glenn Research Center tested lubricant lifetimes in ambient air and ultrahigh vacuum and characterized the breakdown products of the friction and wear. These carbon nanoparticles can provide adequate lubrication {{very similar to that}} of graphitic material when run in air. Soot represents one of the very first nanostructured materials, although it has rarely been considered as such. Changes in the carbon nanostructure, resulting in increased graphitic layer <b>plane</b> <b>length,</b> correlate with reactivity loss. Upon heating spherically shaped nanometer-sized carbon black in the absence of oxidant, graphene sheets form, and the initial soot particle templates the growth of a graphitic particle into what is best described as a sphere with many flat sides having a hollow interior. Because there are no edge sites, these polygonal graphitic particles, or nano-onions, are relatively resistant to oxidation. Graphite is used as a solid lubricant because of its stability at moderately high temperatures. However, the temperature at which graphite oxidizes rapidly is strongly influenced by surface area. With the size of particles typically employed in lubrication, a great amount of thermal stability is lost because of size reduction either during preparation or during lubrication of contacting parts.
