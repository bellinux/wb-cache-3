40|$|ABSTRACT: A {{variety of}} clay {{specimens}} (Kaolin, Belfast Upper Boulder Clay and Belfast Sleech) {{were subjected to}} British Standards Triaxial Permeability Tests and Accelerated Permeability Tests {{in order to examine}} how the permeability predicted (under uniform effective stresses and conditions) varied depending on the testing method adopted. The specimens were then freeze-dried to preserve their post-test state, and examined using a Scanning Electron Microscope, in order to analyse their soil structure. In all cases the Accelerated <b>Permeability</b> <b>Test</b> predicted a value of permeability lower than that predicted by the British Standards Triaxial <b>Permeability</b> <b>Test.</b> Likewise, the soil structure present in the Accelerated <b>Permeability</b> <b>Test</b> specimens showed marked differences when compared to soil structure present in the British Standards Triaxial <b>Permeability</b> <b>Test</b> specimens; however the differences were not constant throughout the specimens. It was concluded that Accelerated Permeability Tests do result in soil structure degradation; however the full extent of this is not yet known. To ascertain this, it is recommended that a series of Accelerated Permeability and British Standards Triaxial Permeability Tests are performed on a variety of clays under varying effective stresses, along with a series of British Standards Uniaxial Compression Tests on these specimens post-test. ...|$|E

Durability {{means the}} {{resistance}} to physical or chemical deterioration of concrete resulting from interaction with environment (physical deterioration) or interaction between constituents (chemical deterioration) of concrete. A durable concrete ensures corrosion resistance of embedded steel which in turn ensures a better longevity of the structure as a whole. Concrete in structures in the coastal areas are the most susceptible to chemical deterioration as sea water, with high concentration of chloride ions, has quite a detrimental effect on durability of concrete. In these cases, the lower the chloride permeability, the better the durability of concrete. As instruments for standard chloride <b>permeability</b> <b>test</b> is very expensive, an experiment has been conducted to carry out Rapid Chloride <b>Permeability</b> <b>Test</b> (RCPT) using improvised apparatus made of readily available low-cost materials.
