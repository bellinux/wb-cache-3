50|$|It is {{important}} to note that nouns in Wayana fall under three classes, in regards to possessibility: unpossessable, optionally possessable, and inherently <b>possessed.</b> Unpossessable nouns do not take possessive prefixes or suffixes. Optionally <b>possessed</b> nouns are semantically diverse, and can occur in either <b>possessed</b> or unpossessed form (most examples given use optionally <b>possessed</b> nouns). Inherently <b>possessed</b> nouns “denote entities that stand in a stable, intrinsic relationship with another entity” (Tavares, 2005, pp. 136), and must always be <b>possessed.</b> Kinship terms (such as in 5a.) and some body parts fall under this category. Inherently <b>possessed</b> nouns often, but not always, take -ø as the possessive suffix.|$|R
