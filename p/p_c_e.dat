40|$|The {{diffusion}} length (L) of photogenerated carriers in the nanoporous electrode {{is a key}} parameter that summarizes the collection efficiency behavior in dye-sensitized solar cells (DSCs). At present, there are few techniques able to spatially resolve L over the active area of the device. Most of them require contact patterning and, hence, are intrinsically destructive. Here, we present the first electron {{diffusion length}} mapping system for DSCs based on steady state incident photon to collected electron (IPCE) conversion efficiency (η I <b>P</b> <b>C</b> <b>E)</b> analysis. The measurement is conducted by acquiring complete transmittance (T DSC) and η I <b>P</b> <b>C</b> <b>E</b> spectra from the photo electrode (PE) and counter electrode (CE) for each spatial point in a raster scan manner. L (x, y) is obtained by a least square fitting of the IPCE ratio spectrum (I <b>P</b> <b>C</b> <b>E</b> R = η I <b>P</b> <b>C</b> <b>E</b> -CE η I <b>P</b> <b>C</b> <b>E</b> -PE). An advanced feature {{is the ability to}} acquire η I <b>P</b> <b>C</b> <b>E</b> spectra using low-intensity probe illumination under weakly-absorbed background light (625 nm) with the device biased close to open circuit voltage. These homogeneous conditions permit the linearization of the free electron continuity equation and, hence, to obtain the collection efficiency expressions (η COL-PE and η COL-CE). The influence of the parameter’s uncertainty has been quantified by a sensitivity study of L. The result has been validated by quantitatively comparing the average value of L map with the value estimated from electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) ...|$|E
40|$|According to {{the report}} of the Communications Committee of the Presbyterian Church of East Africa (<b>P.</b> <b>C.</b> <b>E.</b> A.) to the 15 th General Assembly, the church is aware of the immensity of information, {{education}} and revelation that can be shared and disseminated through the print media in the church. 1 However, to effectively disseminate the Gospel through the print media requires some creativity and administrative initiatives in the national office and particularly in the division of Communications and Publishing. As an initiative proposal, this dissertation examines how the <b>P.</b> <b>C.</b> <b>E.</b> A. has used print media from the missionary period (early 1900) to the mid- 1990 s, and offers proposals for maximizing print media impact in church development and social transformation. This dissertation is the final stage and result of a Doctor of Ministry project study and research conducted in Kenya and the United States between 1993 and 1997. Four parts comprised of eight chapters compose the dissertation. Part I is the ministry setting, containing chapters One and Two. Chapter One is {{a brief description of the}} nation of Kenya in terms of geography, history and politics. It is the wider context of this project. Chapter Two introduces the Presbyterian Church of East Africa as the central setting of the project. The history, the organizational structure and theological stance of this church are here discussed. Part II is the main body of the dissertation. It is the ministry issue, and it is divided into Chapters Three and Four. Chapter Three contains the history of print media in the <b>P.</b> <b>C.</b> <b>E.</b> A., with some remarks on the early beginnings of print media in Europe. Chapter Four is a brief examination of biblical and theological basis for print media use. Part III is the project, containing Chapters Five and Six. Chapter Five includes a review of six key texts which have been helpful in this research. The texts are: Keeping Your Church Informed by Austin Brodie; 2 Let the People Know: A Media Handbook for Churches by Charles Austin; 3 Communications Media in the Nigerian Church Today by Boniface Ntomchukwu; 4 How to Publicize Church Activities by William J. Barrows, Jr.; 5 Communication for Development by Karl Lundstrom; 6 and Hope for Africa by G. Kinoti. 7 This chapter also includes questionnaire responses from a cross section of participants in Kenya and America, including the <b>P.</b> <b>C.</b> <b>E.</b> A. ministers living in Atlanta at the time, and members of the International Class of First Presbyterian Church-Atlanta. Chapter Six includes interviews, briefs from some <b>P.</b> <b>C.</b> <b>E.</b> A. leaders, and workshop proceedings from the <b>P.</b> <b>C.</b> <b>E.</b> A. Nkoroi and Chuka churches and from First Presbyterian Church-Atlanta. Part IV is the project evaluation. This final part contains Chapters Seven and Eight. Chapter Seven discusses recommendations for possible implementation of the proposals or suggestions made in the dissertation. These primarily relate to finance, training and structural innovations and changes. Chapter Eight is the conclusion, restating the purpose of the project. It emphasizes questions of faith and the sense of urgency in doing whatever it takes to maximize the impact of print media in the <b>P.</b> <b>C.</b> <b>E.</b> A. for God 2 ̆ 7 s glory and the blessing of the church...|$|E

Under these conditions, {{the first signs}} of cytopathic effect (<b>c.</b> <b>p.</b> <b>e.)</b> appeared at about 30 h post-infection and cell lysis occurred after 40 h. Before the onset of cytopathic changes, the virus induced inhibition of host cell protein, DNA and RNA (primarily rRNA) synthesis.

The effect of virus on host cell macromolecular synthesis and development of <b>c.</b> <b>p.</b> <b>e,</b> were not related to the virus isolate, but to the conditions under which the virus was produced.

The virus stocks that did not induce inhibition are defined as <b>c.</b> <b>p.</b> <b>e.</b> (-). Analysis of [3 H]leucine-labelled proteins from Vero cells infected with either the <b>c.</b> <b>p.</b> <b>e.</b> (+) or the <b>c.</b> <b>p.</b> <b>e.</b> (-) virus stocks revealed synthesis of two virusspecific polypeptides migrating with mobilities corresponding to mol. wt. 68000 and 79000.

40|$|Mount Etna volcano (Sicily, Italy) is {{the place}} where {{short-lived}} radioactive disequilibrium measurements in volcanic gases were initiated more than 40 years ago. Almost two decades after the last measurements in Mount Etna plume, we carried out in 2015 a new survey of 210 Pb- 210 Bi- 210 Po radioactive disequilibria in gaseous emanations from the volcano. These new results [(e r r o r t y <b>p</b> <b>e</b> <b>c</b> <b>e</b> 210 <b>P</b> o / e r r o r t y <b>p</b> <b>e</b> <b>c</b> <b>e</b> 210 <b>P</b> b) = 42 and (e r r o r t y <b>p</b> <b>e</b> <b>c</b> <b>e</b> 210 B i / e r r o r t y <b>p</b> <b>e</b> <b>c</b> <b>e</b> 210 <b>P</b> b) = 7. 5] are in fair agreement with those previously reported. Previously published degassing models fail to explain satisfactorily measured activity ratios. We present here a new degassing model, which accounts for 222 Rn enrichment in volcanic gases and its subsequent decay into 210 Pb within gas bubbles en route to the surface. Theoretical short-lived radioactive disequilibria in volcanic gases predicted by this new model differ from those produced by the former models and better match the values we measured in the plume during the 2015 campaign. A Monte Carlo-like simulation based on variable parameters characterising the degassing process (magma residence time in the degassing reservoir, gas transfer time, Rn-Pb-Bi-Po volatilities, magma volatile content) suggests that short-lived disequilibria in volcanic gases may be of use to infer both magma dynamics and degassing kinetics beneath Mount Etna, and in general at basaltic volcanoes. However, this simulation emphasizes the need for accurately determined input parameters in order to produce unambiguous results, allowing sharp characterisation of degassing processes...|$|R

Here we present a field-dependent derivation of Mattis-Bardeen (M-B) theory of the RF surface impedance of BCS superconductors based on the shifted Density of States (DoS) resulting from coherently moving Cooper pairs [1]. The surprising reduction in resistance with increasing field is explained to be an intrinsic effect. Using this analysis coded in MathematicaTM, survey calculations have been completed which examine the sensitivities of this surface impedance to variation of the BCS material parameters and temperature. Our theoretical prediction of the effective BCS RF surface resistance (Rs) of niobium as a function of peak surface magnetic field amplitude agrees well with recently reported record low loss resonant cavity measurements from Jefferson Lab (JLab) and Fermi National Accelerator Lab (FNAL) with carefully, yet differently, prepared niobium material.

Prior to the Poote decision in this Court (No. 900132) All actions against the Board of Pardons were summarily dismissed under this Code. Trying to apply a Stutute of Limitations to something that did not exist— Prior to Poote— is a total absurdity, Plaintiff 2 ̆ 7 s Writ was filed in District Court {{in a timely manner}} following the Poote decision which makes the State 2 ̆ 7 s Contention a Moot Point. As per Utah Senate and House minuets of debate on Bill No. 245 submitted by State, it is quite obvious that the Legislation was directed at Capital Cases. Unfortunatly, a scatter-gun approach was used that encompassed an entire group— 99...|$|E

40|$|Globally {{the garment}} {{industry}} {{is one of}} the biggest employers of low-skilled women workers. Despite their large numbers in the workforce, relatively few female garment workers advance to higher-level positions as they have limited opportunities to acquire the skills that would enable their professional and personal growth. In response to this need, Gap Inc. initiated the <b>P.</b> A. <b>C.</b> <b>E.</b> (Personal Advancement & Career Enhancement) workplace education program to teach women the managerial, interpersonal, organizational and other practical skills needed to move forward in work and in life. This report summarizes findings from program evaluations conducted by ICRW from 2009 - 2013 at six factory sites where <b>P.</b> A. <b>C.</b> <b>E.</b> is implemented - two in India and one each in Cambodia, Vietnam, Bangladesh and China. Research findings from these robust, multi-country evaluations demonstrate that <b>P.</b> A. <b>C.</b> <b>E.</b> is an effective, sustainable and scalable model that yields high returns for women, their families and the businesses where they work...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to assess the impact of {{conjugated}} linoleic acids (CLAs), vitamin E, and combination of these nutrients on serum lipid profiles and blood pressure (BP) in patients with active rheumatoid arthritis (RA). In a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, 87 patients with active RA were divided into four groups receiving one of the following daily supplements for three months: Group C: CLAs 2. 5 g equivalent to 2 g mixture of cis 9 -trans 11 and trans 10 -cis 12 CLAs in a rate of 50 / 50; Group E: vitamin E: 400 mg; Group CE: CLAs and vitamin E at above doses: Group P: placebo. After supplementation, SBP levels decreased significantly in the group C in comparison with groups E and P and mean arterial pressure reduced significantly in groups C and CE. There weren’t significant differences in the levels of prostaglandin E 2 (PGE 2), triglycerides, cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), LDL/HDL, cholesterol/HDL, fasting blood sugar, C-reactive protein (CRP), arylestrase activity, platelet count and body mass index between groups. CRP dropped nonsignificantly in groups <b>P,</b> <b>C,</b> <b>E</b> and CE (19 %, 24 %, 55 %, and 39 %, respectively). Erythrocytes sedimentation rate levels decreased in groups C, E and CE (P ≤ 0. 05, P ≤ 0. 05, P ≤ 0. 001, respectively). It is concluded that supplementation of CLAs decreased BP and vitamin E decreased CRP. Therefore cosupplementation of CLAs and vitamin E might be profitable for heart disease prevention in RA patients...|$|E
40|$|Recent {{theory and}} {{experiment}} in crystals of molecular magnets suggest that fundamental {{tests of the}} decoherence mechanisms of macroscopic quantum phenomena may be feasible in these systems (which are almost ideal quantum spin glasses). We review the results, and suggest new experiments. The attempt to push quantum effects to mesoscopic or macroscopic scales has led, in magnetic systems, to various interesting discoveries. Theoretical work on domain wall tunneling 1, 2, 3 led to experiments claiming to see tunneling of single domain walls. 4 Early theory on tunneling of large spins 5, 6 stimulated experiments on resonant tunneling in crystals of magnetic macromolecules, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12 and on “macroscopic quantum coherence ” 13 in giant ferritin molecules. There is a theoretical complication- the environmental “spin bath” of nuclear and paramagnetic spins should destructively interfere with any tunneling. 14, 15, 16, 17 In fact, except in ferritin, all experiments see incoherent tunneling relaxation at low T. A detailed theory of such relaxation,, 18, 19, 20, 21 applied to ensembles of tunneling nanomagnets, makes several “universal” predictions for the relaxation characteristics, {{some of which have}} now been verified. 22, 23 Here we discuss the recent developments, and suggest future experiments designed to bring out the fundamental role of nuclear spins in quantum decoherence at low T.
