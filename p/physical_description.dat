5|$|The rest of {{the entry}} is written in {{continuous}} prose, starting with a <b>physical</b> <b>description</b> giving length, weight, and {{a detailed account of}} plumage with differences between the sexes (more than a page in the cirl bunting's case). Montagu then describes the species' distribution, nesting (nest structure, number of eggs, nesting period), differences from similar species, and other observations.|$|E
5|$|For a {{property}} {{to be eligible}} for the National Register, it must meet {{at least one of the}} four National Register main criteria. Information about architectural styles, association with various aspects of social history and commerce, and ownership are all integral parts of the nomination. Each nomination contains a narrative section that provides a detailed <b>physical</b> <b>description</b> of the property and justifies why it is significant historically with regard either to local, state, or national history. The four National Register of Historic Places criteria are the following.|$|E
5|$|The new {{location}} of the court is also introduced: Scottish actress Kate Dickie was cast as the Lady of the Eyrie, Lysa Arryn, also making her first appearance in this episode. Although Dickie does not resemble the <b>physical</b> <b>description</b> of Lysa given in the books, Martin stated that her acting in the auditions was excellent. The role of her son (renamed Robin in the series to avoid confusion with King Robert) went to Lino Facioli, and the knight of the Vale Ser Vardis Egen was played by Brendan McCormack.|$|E

5|$|In Luxerion, Lightning investigates {{a series}} of murders where all the victims match the <b>physical</b> <b>description</b> of the savior. During her journey, she is {{followed}} by Noel, who has become obsessed with a prophecy that he must kill Lightning to realize a better world and reunite with Yeul. The two briefly ally to rout the Children of Etro, responsible for the murders, then later do battle. Lightning uses Noel's rage to make him realize and accept his mistakes, lifting his burden. After this, she meets up with Vanille in the Order's cathedral. Vanille shows Lightning a place within the cathedral where {{the souls of the}} dead have gathered. Vanille is being prepared for a ritual to take place on the final day that will apparently purify the souls. She hopes to atone for past actions by doing so.|$|E
5|$|Lie {{groups are}} of {{fundamental}} importance in modern physics: Noether's theorem links continuous symmetries to conserved quantities. Rotation, {{as well as}} translations {{in space and time}} are basic symmetries of the laws of mechanics. They can, for instance, be used to construct simple models—imposing, say, axial symmetry on a situation will typically lead to significant simplification in the equations one needs to solve to provide a <b>physical</b> <b>description.</b> Another example are the Lorentz transformations, which relate measurements of time and velocity of two observers in motion relative to each other. They can be deduced in a purely group-theoretical way, by expressing the transformations as a rotational symmetry of Minkowski space. The latter serves—in the absence of significant gravitation—as a model of space time in special relativity. The full symmetry group of Minkowski space, i.e., including translations, is known as the Poincaré group. By the above, it plays a pivotal role in special relativity and, by implication, for quantum field theories. Symmetries that vary with location are central to the modern description of physical interactions with the help of gauge theory.|$|E

40|$|The {{scope of}} the project has been to assist Prof Presig with {{software}} design and overall strategy. The biggest concepts faced were {{on how to deal}} with phase change in models, what <b>physical</b> <b>descriptions</b> should be available for the graph and how these <b>physical</b> <b>descriptions</b> are best structured to prevent infeasible systems. The current version of the computer-aided modelling project is written in Python, using the graphical user interface environment PyQt 4. </p...|$|R

25|$|This {{relationship}} between {{the name of the}} symbol and the class of divine entities it represents, reflects the current belief that the symbol represents a Fravashi. However, there is no <b>physical</b> <b>description</b> of the Fravashis in the Avesta, the sacred texts of Zoroastrianism, and in Avestan the entities are grammatically feminine.|$|E
25|$|The British {{intelligence}} service established contact with its counterpart in the Soviet Union {{to evaluate the}} situation. Talaat Pasha's plans made the Russian officials as anxious as the British. The two {{intelligence service}}s collaborated and signed between them the 'death warrant' of Talaat. Information concerning his <b>physical</b> <b>description</b> and his whereabouts was forwarded to their men in Germany.|$|E

25|$|The fictional Cameron is, like Sullivan – whose <b>physical</b> <b>description</b> he matches – a great {{innovative}} skyscraper pioneer late in {{the nineteenth}} century who dies impoverished and embittered in the mid-1920s. Cameron's rapid decline is explicitly attributed to the wave of classical Greco-Roman revivalism in architecture {{in the wake of the}} 1893 World's Columbian Exposition, just as Sullivan in his autobiography attributed his own downfall to the same event.|$|E
25|$|Although {{there is}} no <b>physical</b> <b>description</b> of a fravashi in the Avesta, the faravahar, {{one of the best}} known symbols of Zoroastrianism, is {{commonly}} believed to be the depiction of one. The attribution of the name (which derives from the Middle Iranian word for fravashi) to the symbol is probably a later development. In Avestan language grammar, the fravashi are unmistakably female, while the faravahar symbol is unmistakably male.|$|E
25|$|Assuming that a {{small black}} hole has zero entropy, the {{integration}} constant is zero. Forming a black hole is {{the most efficient way}} to compress mass into a region, and this entropy is also a bound on the information content of any sphere in space time. The form of the result strongly suggests that the <b>physical</b> <b>description</b> of a gravitating theory can be somehow encoded onto a bounding surface.|$|E

25|$|Britt is {{a convicted}} sex {{offender}} {{who has been}} convicted of three separate rapes and, as of 2017, is serving time {{in prison for the}} 2008 kidnapping and attempted rape of another woman.

Clint Bobo also identified a voice sample of Britt's voice as being very similar to the voice he heard that morning.|$|E
25|$|Philippine {{passports}} {{have different}} styles of data pages. Old brown passports have both a data and <b>physical</b> <b>description</b> page, with the picture located on the description page rather than the data page; these are separated by the passport note. Green passports issued before 2004 have the data page on the inner cover followed by the passport note page. Passports issued after 2004 have the passport note and data pages reversed, with the passport note on the inner cover page.|$|E
25|$|A forged {{letter by}} Publius Lentulus, the Governor of Judea, to the Roman Senate dates to {{around the year}} 1300 and, {{according}} to most scholars, was composed {{to compensate for the}} lack of any <b>physical</b> <b>description</b> of Jesus in the Bible. Also in the 14th century Nicephorus Callistus quoted an unnamed antique source that described Jesus as tall and beautiful with fair, wavy hair, but his account was most likely without basis and was inspired by the prevailing artistic images of Jesus.|$|E
