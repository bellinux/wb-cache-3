50|$|Muffat, {{publishing}} his Florilegium with multilingual prefaces, clearly intending {{his work}} to be widely published (which it was), and as {{there would be no}} opportunity for an oral tradition to transmit the performance practices, he decided in order for the music to be played correctly, he would codify the Lullist practices - with musical examples of how to perform the ornaments, interpret the various rhythmic alterations including notes inégales, as well as tempo instructions, and bowing instructions, and when and where to apply notes inégales and all the variety of Lullist embellishment and ornamentation, especially when there is no obvious indication. His extremely detailed codification of notes inégales and the Lullist performance practices, and in practical combination with his suites, and including further explication by explicit half encoded/half written out solutions to demonstrate the correct and appropriate application of notes inégales in the Premiere suite of the Florilegium Secundum, would achieve a clarity of understanding the rhythmic alteration procedure of notes inégales to a huge musical circle beyond his <b>personal</b> <b>scope</b> and of his musical circle which included his colleague Heinrich Ignaz Franz Biber's world in 17th century Salzburg, Austria.|$|E

This autobiographical recount chronicles architecture and orchestrates the interior, giving the reader a full account of his home and “offering us the chance to follow the true routes of privacy, and to recreate the Professor’s universe, reduced to the dimensions of the human eye.” His writing provides an insight into firstly how he accesses the space in which he lives, and how he inhabits that space.

40|$|In recent years, two {{measures}} against racial discrimination {{have been taken}} in Europe: the European Union adopted a Council Directive implementing the Principle of Equal Treatment between Persons irrespective of Racial or Ethnic Origin in June 2000; and, in December 2002, the European Commission against Racism and Intolerance, a body of the Council of Europe, adopted General Policy Recommendation no 7 on National Legislation to Combat Racism and Racial Discrimination. This article reviews these two instruments, which show many similarities, but also some differences.

40|$|The article {{looks at}} {{the impact of the}} {{introduction}} of Union citizenship on the scope of application of the Treaty. In particular it considers how the citizenship provisions have affected the personal and the material scope of the Treaty. By virtue of Article 17 EC the <b>personal</b> <b>scope</b> of the Treaty is expanded so that any Union citizen, and not only the migrant citizen, now falls within the <b>personal</b> <b>scope</b> of the Treaty. The significance of this finding then depends on the definition of the material scope of the Treaty, i. e. on the identification of the rights that Union citizens can claim qua citizens. In this respect, it is clear that Union citizens have a right to move; and a right to reside in any of the Member States (subject to limitations and conditions). Union citizens have also a right to equal treatment deriving from Article 12 EC. In this respect, the article argues that such a right to equal treatment is not merely an ancillary right which is conditional upon migration; rather, Article 12 EC is a self-standing right pertaining to all those who fall within the <b>personal</b> <b>scope</b> of the Treaty. As a result, Article 12 EC is capable of being invoked by static union citizens to challenge reverse discrimination...|$|E
40|$|The essay {{focuses on}} the {{relevance}} of the labour law regulation's <b>personal</b> <b>scope,</b> what the holistic approach of employee status and its social part mean. There have been discussions in the European Union to which circle of working people shall the protection system of labour law apply, and how the security of employees can be guaranteed under the pressure of flexibility. The debates have been inspired by a changed economic and social environment in the XXth centrury. The essay presents the influence of the changing economic and social environment in the concept of employee status, and more closer in the Hungarian labour law regulation. The decision who is acknowledged to be an employee is made by the legislator. By making this decision the labour law regulation shows a tendency of withdrawal and moving forward in the last decades. The change of employment contract develops at the same time with the expansion of <b>personal</b> <b>scope</b> in Europe and shows a great variety. The legislation, judicial practice, legal practice and the collective bargaining influence the expansion of protection under labour law. The changes of <b>personal</b> <b>scope</b> in the Labour Code of 1992 and 2012 are presented, how it is extended and in which direction. The <b>personal</b> <b>scope</b> is also applied to link the public and private sector by finding a common focal point: the characteristics of employment. While coping with the employment relations on the labour market and trying to fit into the self-employed - employee-like person - employee categories, it is suggested to exceed the contractual framework by means of abstraction and using the concept of personal work relations. Employee status has social part; therefore the essay describes the social consequences of being employee and its relation to the employee status...|$|E

40|$|Publication {{based on}} {{research}} {{carried out in the}} framework of the European Union Democracy Observatory (EUDO) of the Robert Schuman Centre for Advanced Studies, European University Institute. There is a tension between a liberal ideal of free movement and democratic concerns about the integrity of citizenship. This text proposes first to break down the problem by introducing a typology of free movement regimes based on their <b>personal</b> and territorial <b>scopes.</b> Second, it argues that the tension can be partially overcome through supranational integration, toleration of multiple citizenship and international agreements on reciprocal free movement rights. Taken together, these three strategies can greatly expand free movement rights that are not in conflict with democratic 3 citizenship since they rely on an expanded conception of such citizenship. The analysis concludes, however, that even the best possible free movement regimes that can be imagined under present circumstances cannot fully overcome discriminatory features of immigrant admission policies...|$|R
40|$|In {{this chapter}} the authors discuss the <b>personal</b> <b>scope</b> of the Directive on the Posting of Workers (Dir 96 / 71 /EC) and the {{implementation}} thereof in the Member States. The comparative findings {{are based on}} two studies conducted by the authors {{on behalf of the}} European Commission in 2010 / 2011. The authors argue that the concepts of 'posting' and 'posted worker' are crucial for a proper understanding of the scope of application of the Directive and its interaction with the Rome I Regulation on the applicable law to contractual obligations (Reg 593 / 2008). A clear and enforceable demarcation of the <b>personal</b> <b>scope</b> will help the Member States to combat abuse of the freedom to provide services and to distinguish more clearly between posting and other types of labour mobility.

40|$|Although {{set against}} the {{background}} of investigations by the European Commission in proceedings for the application of the main competition rules of the EU, the discussion remains at the level of broad principles. The driving notion of this article is that the basis and ratio for judicial recognition of a privileged communications doctrine in EU law must be defined explicitly, and that this definition may have important consequences as to the scope and practical administrability of the doctrine. Part I explores the principal rationales usually claimed for the privilege: the utilitarian view and the rights-based approach. This discussion serves as useful background to understand the position of EU law regarding operation of the privilege in competition proceedings conducted by the Commission. Part II describes the state of the law since AM 2 ̆ 6 S, commenting on the <b>personal</b> and material <b>scope</b> of the current privilege rule, the possible reasons underlying its strict conditions, and the procedural arrangements for resolving privilege disputes.
