40|$|A novel {{pilot-plant}} scale sonochemical reactor (UES 4000 C <b>Pilotstation)</b> {{has been}} specifically developed for degrading {{a variety of}} water contaminants in large-scale applications. We report here the sonochemical degradation of four chemical compounds in aqueous solution: the chlorinated volatile contaminants dichloromethane (DCM) and trichloroethylene (TCE), and two non-volatile compounds, phenol and the azo dye methyl orange (MO). The flow-through reactor in the <b>Pilotstation</b> consists of four 612 kHz piezoelectric transducers which are driven by a power source operating at 3 kW. The sonochemical reaction chamber has a volume of 6 L, while the total capacity of the <b>Pilotstation,</b> including a heat-exchanger unit and a reservoir tank varies from a minimum volume of 7. 25 L to a maximum over 45 L. The observed reaction rates for the degradation of these contaminants in the <b>Pilotstation</b> were compared with values determined under similar conditions in small-scale bench reactors in order to evaluate its performance {{over a wide range}} of power densities. The pseudo-first order degradation rate for TCE in the <b>Pilotstation</b> was found to be more than 4 times higher tha...|$|E
40|$|This report {{presents}} the results of a WHO Europen Intercomparison Workshop on Air Quality Monitoring (NO, NO_ 2, SO_ 2 and O_ 3) conducted in May 2002 by the WHO Collaborating Centre for Air Quality Management and Air Pollution Control in co-operation with the national reference laboratory of UBA <b>Pilotstation</b> in Langen, Germany. The Workshop was a contribution to on-going quality assurance and control activities on air quality measurements for Member States of the WHO Europen Region. Eleven laboratories mainly from Central and Eastern Europe used the opportunity to compare their measurement methods (14 manual methods and 20 monitors) and standards. (orig.)

40|$|This report {{presents}} the results of two European Intercomparison Workshops on Air Quality Monitoring (CO, NO, NO_ 2 and BTX) conducted in May 1998 by the WHO Collaborating Centre for Air Quality Management and Air Pollution Control in co-operation with the national reference laboratory of UBA <b>Pilotstation</b> in Offenbach/Main, Germany. The Workshops were to be a contribution to continuing quality assurance and control activities on air quality monitoring in the WHO European Region. Fourteen institutes used the opportunity to compare their measurement methods (12 manual methods and 31 monitors) and standards for ambient air monitoring of carbon monoxide, oxides of nitrogen, benzene, toluene, and xylene. Summing up the laboratory measurements (automatic and manual methods) of NO, NO_ 2 and CO during both intercomparison Workshops more than 80 % of all results agrees with the target value within a tolerance of #+-# 10 %, and 60 to 80 % of all results were within a tolerance of #+-# 5 %. Best results were obtained for CO measurements (measured by monitors only) : 92 % agreed with a tolerance of #+-# 10 % and 76 % agreed within #+-# 5 %. For the comparisons of different analytical methods during the measurements of nitrogen oxides the results showed very good agreement for NO_ 2. On the other hand, the results for NO were not as good and they indicated some problems with manual methods. Summing up the BTX laboratory measurements (automatic and manual methods) of both intercomparison Workshops, 44 to 60 % of all results were within a tolerance of #+-# 10 %, and between 23 and 35 % of all results were within tolerance of #+-# 5 % from the target value. The comparisons of calibration standards showed very good agreement between the primary calibration standard of UBA <b>Pilotstation</b> and the national transfer standards of the participating laboratories. Some unsystematical differences were identified for manual methods at low NO and NO_ 2 concentrations in ambient air. Furthermore, some measurement phenomena were identified of automatic and manual methods. Thus, {{there seems to be a}} need for further intercomparisons to check and to veryify the causes. Most of the applied methods are reliable and suitable for obtaining air quality data appropriate to evaluate and estimate environmental health risks in the WHO European Region. (orig.)

40|$|This report {{presents}} the results of three European Intercomparison Workshops on Air Quality Monitoring (CO, NO, NO_ 2, and O_ 3) conducted in April 1995 and in April and September 1996 by the WHO Collaborating Centre for Air Quality Management and Air Pollution Control in co-operation with the central laboaratory of UBA <b>Pilotstation</b> in Offenbach/Main, Germany. These Workshops were a contribution to ongoing quality assurance and quality control activities in air quality monitoring within the WHO European Region. Fifteen institutes used the opportunity to compare their measurement methods (4 manual methods and 26 automatic methods) and analytical standards for ambient air monitoring of carbon monoxide, oxides of nitrogen and ozone. Calibrations were done by using certified reference materials (CRM) and by carrying through suitable independent calibrations. The results were expressed as concentrations over 30 minutes. The main result of altogether 122 intercomparison runs at the three Workshops is that agreement within +/- 10 % of the given concentration was reached by all laboratories. 93 % of the participating laboratories were even able to achieve a result within +/- 5 % of the given concentrations. Additionally, one sampling period of 24 hours was performed for NO_ 2 during the Workshop in September 1996. Except one deviation of 5. 5 % all averages of the 24 hours run were within a tolerance of +/- 5 % from the target value. All applied methods could be recommended as suitable methods for future air quality measurements in the WHO European Region. (orig.)
