Recent review papers describe in details mechanisms of photocatalytic disinfection and solar reactors for photocatalytic water treatment, solar disinfection parameters, and illustrate inherent advantages and general procedures of sol-gel method for the <b>preparation</b> <b>of</b> <b>photocatalysts.</b> The aim of present report is to review the latest literature data analyzing the influence of each sol-gel coating preparation step onto coating structure and properties...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: The {{sol-gel process}} is a wet-chemical {{technique}} (chemical solution deposition), which has been widely used {{in the fields of}} materials science, ceramic engineering, and especially in the <b>preparation</b> <b>of</b> <b>photocatalysts.</b> Volatile organic compounds (VOCs) are prevalent components of indoor air pollution. Among the approaches to remove VOCs from indoor air, photocatalytic oxidation (PCO) is regarded as a promising method. This paper is a review of the status of research on the sol-gel method for photocatalyst preparation and for the PCO purification of VOCs. The review and discussion will focus on the preparation and coating of various photocatalysts, operational parameters, and will provide an overview of general PCO models described in the literature...|$|E
40|$|The {{elimination}} of {{volatile organic compounds}} (VOCs) at low concentration is a subject of great interest because these compounds are very harmful for the environment and human health. In this work, we have developed a synthesis methodology of TiO 2 that allows obtaining meso-macroporous materials with hierarchical porosity and with high thermal stability for their application as photocatalysts in the removal of VOCs, specifically propene. The materials synthesized in this work were characterized by Scanning electron microscope (SEM), Transmission electron microscopy (TEM), powder X-ray diffraction (XRD), Thermogravimetric Analysis (TG), and nitrogen adsorption. It is observed that the samples calcined at 250 °C and 500 °C present a high photoactivity for the photooxidation of propene, {{which is similar to}} the benchmark material P 25 (commercial TiO 2). Moreover, the textural properties are better than those for P 25, indicating that the samples are interesting for the <b>preparation</b> <b>of</b> <b>photocatalysts</b> with different conformations, such as in the form of coatings and fillings in different size scales...|$|E
40|$|A {{simple and}} {{versatile}} method for the <b>preparation</b> <b>of</b> <b>photocatalyst</b> particulates modified with effective cocatalysts is presented; the method involves the sequential soaking <b>of</b> <b>photocatalyst</b> particulates in solutions containing bifunctional organic linkers and metal ions. The {{modification of the}} particulate surfaces is a universal and reproducible method because the molecular linkers utilize strong covalent bonds, which in turn result in modified monolayer with a small but controlled quantity of metals. The photocatalysis {{results indicated that the}} CdS with likely photochemically reduced Pd and Ni, which were initially immobilized via ethanedithiol (EDT) as a linker, were highly efficient for photocatalytic hydrogen evolution from Na 2 S-Na 2 SO 3 -containing aqueous solutions.

40|$|One of {{the methods}} used to produce buffer layers for thin film solar cells is the Spray ion layer gas {{reaction}} (SPRAY-ILGAR). This method has exhibited astonishing efficiencies in the fabrication of homogenous compact metal chalcogenide films. The same approach can be applied in the <b>preparation</b> <b>of</b> <b>photocatalyst</b> on a substrate, in order to acquire a homogeneous and durable layer. In this work, the Spray-ILGAR technique has been utilized in the <b>preparation</b> <b>of</b> titania <b>photocatalysts</b> on stainless steel, which was carried out at Helmholtz-Zentrum Berlin for Materials and Energy, in Berlin, Germany. The characterizations and photocatalytic testing of the synthesized materials were then done at the Institute of Catalysis, Hokkaido University. The scanning electron microscopy (SEM) analysis showed that the titania was dispersed uniformly {{on top of the}} stainless steel, with a very durable and strong attachment. It was also found that the concentration of the titania on stainless steel can be easily varied by changing the concentration of the titania-precursor solution. Higher concentrations will result in a more compact and dense layer, while lowering the concentration of the precursor solution produces a less dense layer of TiO 2. Apart from that, different temperatures did not change the distribution of the samples much. The photocatalytic activity of the synthesized materials was determined in terms of the photocatalytic decomposition of acetaldehyde under ultra violet (UV) light irradiation. The photocatalytic testing results proved that the samples can completely degrade acetaldehyde under UV irradiation. The heating temperature played a crucial role, as the sample prepared by with heating temperature of 550 °C, concentration of titania-precursor of 6. 83 mM and a spraying time of 12 min showed the best results, requiring only 35 min to fully degrade 500 ppm of acetaldehyde...|$|R

The disinfection of E. coli, a model indicator organism for the safe water supply, was investigated by using TiO 2 and Ag-TiO 2 under different light sources. The treatment efficacy for the inactivation of E. coli would be UV/Ag-TiO 2; visible/Ag-TiO 2; dark/Ag-TiO 2; UV (all 100 %) > UV/TiO 2 (99 %) > visible/TiO 2 (96 %) > dark/TiO 2 (87 %) > visible (23 %) > dark (19 %). The order of disinfection efficiency by their corresponding kinetic initial apparent rate constants, app, (min− 1) would be UV/Ag-TiO 2; visible/Ag-TiO 2 (both 6. 67) > UV (6. 6) > dark/Ag-TiO 2 (6. 56) > UV/TiO 2 (1. 62) > visible/TiO 2 (1. 08) > dark/TiO 2 (0. 7) > visible (0. 28) > dark (0. 03). The application of TiO 2 doped with silver strongly improved the ability of disinfection treatment.

30|$|The removal {{efficiency}} of amoxicillin at 30, 60, and 90  mg/L of the nanocatalyst concentrations {{was determined to}} be 59.42, 61.92, and 63.52 %, respectively. Titanium dioxide {{has the potential to be}} applied in the decomposition of many organic pollutants because of its optical and electrical properties, low cost, chemical stability, and nontoxicity. Numerous methods are available for the <b>preparation</b> <b>of</b> <b>photocatalysts.</b> Among them, sol–gel methods are interesting (Sohrabi and Akhlaghian 2016). The mechanism of photocatalytic removal is based on the production of active and reactive radicals such as ·OH. Titanium dioxide is the most commonly used semiconductor photocatalyst for removing contaminants from water or air. Despite the above-mentioned advantages, this compound also has some disadvantages; for example, it makes less effective use of photons in comparison with samples doped with other elements; there is a relatively high velocity of the recombination of electrons and pores generated by light and activity at wavelengths below 400  nm. To improve the photocatalytic efficiency of TiO 2, to develop its effective absorption of light on a visible light range, and to prevent the recombination of electrons and pores, the process has been modified using various operations. Among such modifications is TiO 2 doping with metal and nonmetal ions. Because of the semi-full electron arrangements and the close proximity of the ion radius to the ion radius of Ti 4 +, metal ions are easily replaced throughout the TiO 2 network, causing increased photocatalytic activity within the visible light range. Fe 3 + ions in the TiO 2 network develop a surface trap for electrons and pores created out of radiation. By decreasing the recombination of developed electrons and pores, it then enhances quantum efficiency and photocatalytic activity. Fe 3 + is known as an effective and remarkable enriching factor (Nasseri et al. 2011). Trivial amounts of enriching iron have a positive influence in enhancing the photocatalytic activity of Fe 3 +–TiO 2 (Sun et al. 2009). Titanium dioxide has three crystalline phases (anatase, rutile, and brukite). The combination of rutile and anatase structures has more activity (Kazuhito et al. 2005). Some researchers have studied the photocatalytic activity of TiO 2 in the visible light region. It can only make use of 3 – 5 % of the solar spectrum that reaches the earth because of its large band gap. It is essential to produce visible light-responsive TiO 2 not only to use the visible light, but also to reduce the recombination of photogenerated electrons and holes (Baghapour et al. 2016).|$|E
40|$|The work {{presented}} in this thesis focuses on the synthesis and characterisation of inorganic dyes which {{may be used as}} potential catalysts for CO 2 reduction. Chapter 1 is an introductory chapter concerned with introducing the area of CO 2 reduction and the complexes developed to date.

The chapter concludes with an introduction to the photocatalysts developed within this research. Chapters 3 and 4 of this thesis describe the synthesis and characterisation of mononuclear and dinuclear ruthenium (II) and rhenium (I) complexes using various synthetic routes and ligands. The experimental methodology (i. e. the materials, methods and instrumentation) used while conducting this research, is described in Chapter 2. The investigation into the <b>preparation</b> <b>of</b> <b>photocatalysts</b> begins in chapter 3 with the development of homonuclear and heteronuclear supramolecular complexes containing ruthenium and rhenium metal centers using the “complexes as metals / complexes as ligands” approach. A range of ‘azole’ type bridging ligands 3, 5 -bis(pyridin- 2 -yl) - 1, 2, 4 -triazole (Hbpt), 3, 5 -bis(pyridin- 2 -yl) - 1, 2, 4 -triazole (Hbpzt), 2, 5 -Bis(2 -pyridyl) - 1, 3, 4 -thiadiazole (dptd) were prepared to connect these two centres with an aim to study the effect of bridging ligands on catalytic activity. Characterisation was carried out by 1 HNMR, and CHN with a discussion of their electronic properities included. Chapter 4 continues with a description of a synthetic study to prepare [Ru(bpy) 2 (tpphz) Re(CO) 3 Cl](PF 6) 2.

40|$|A facile {{synthetic}} route for the <b>preparation</b> <b>of</b> highly active <b>photocatalysts</b> was developed. The protocol involves the <b>preparation</b> <b>of</b> a <b>photocatalyst</b> through the direct injection of metal alkoxide precursors into solutions in a photoreactor. As a proof of concept, a tantalum oxide based photocatalyst {{was chosen as}} a model system. Tantalum ethoxide [Ta(OEt) 5] was injected rapidly into a photoreactor filled with a water/methanol mixture, and a TaO x (OH) y composite formed {{and was able to}} produce hydrogen under light illumination. Compared to commercial and mesostructured Ta 2 O 5 and NaTaO 3 materials, TaO x (OH) y produced by direct injection shows superior hydrogen production activity. Notably, the samples prepared by direct injection are amorphous; however, their photocatalytic performance is much higher than those of their crystalline equivalents. If Ta(OEt) 5 was dispersed in methanol before injection, an amorphous framework with higher surface area and larger pore volume was formed, and the hydrogen production rate increased further. The addition of a sodium precursor during the injection further boosted the photocatalytic activity. Furthermore, this concept has also been applied to a titanium-based photocatalyst, and a much better hydrogen production rate has been obtained in comparison with that of commercial TiO 2 (P 25 -Degussa); therefore, the direct-injection synthesis is a flexible method that opens the door to the facile <b>preparation</b> <b>of</b> highly active nanostructured photocatalysts for hydrogen production...|$|R

40|$|In {{the past}} few years, there has been immense {{interest}} in the <b>preparation</b> <b>of</b> sustainable <b>photocatalysts</b> composed <b>of</b> semiconductor nanocrystals (NCs) {{as one of their}} components. We report here, for the first time, the effects of structural parameters of copper indium diselenide (CuInSe 2) NCs on visible light-driven photocatalytic degradation of pollutants under homogeneous conditions. Ligand exchange reactions were performed replacing insulating, oleylamine capping with poly(ethylene glycol) thiols to prepare PEG-thiolate-capped, 1. 8 – 5. 3 nm diameter CuInSe 2 NCs to enhance their solubility in water. This unique solubility property caused inner-sphere electron transfer reactions (O 2 to O 2 •−) to occur at the NC surface, allowing for sustainable photocatalytic reactions. Electrochemical characterization of our dissolved CuInSe 2 NCs showed that the thermodynamic driving force (−ΔG) for oxygen reduction, which increased with decreased NC size, was the dominant contributor to the overall process when compared to the contribution light absorption and the Coulombic interaction energies of electron–hole pair (Je/h). A 2 -fold increase in phenol degradation efficiency (from 30 to ∼ 60 %) was achieved by controlled variation of the diameter of CuInSe 2 NCs from 5. 3 to 1. 8 nm. The surface ligand dependency of photocatalytic efficiency was also investigated, and a profound effect on phenol degradation was observed.

The prepared catalysts were examined using X-ray diffraction (XRD), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and Brunnauer-Emmett-Teller surface area analysis (BET). An amount of 0. 375 g L- 1 EGZrO 2 /EGZnO/EGFe 2 O 3 /HY {{was found to be}} the optimum dosage for 10 mg L- 1 MB, which gave almost complete photodecolorization of MB (99. 5 %) after 1 h of contact time at pH 9. Next, the effect of inorganic salts such as NaCl, Na 2 CO 3, Na 2 SO 4, and KI was also studied. It was found that the presence of the Cl- and CO 3 - 2 ions obstructed the photodecolorization, but the presence of SO 42 - accelerated the reaction. The presence of I- ions did not affect much on the decolorization rate. Furthermore, the addition of H 2 O 2 significantly enhanced the photodecolorization for the 50 mg L- 1 of MB solution under similar optimum conditions. It was also found that the radical scavenging agents such as dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) and methanol (MeOH) suppressed the decolorization, with DMSO being the most effective.

30|$|The {{combination}} of Bi 2 WO 6 with other semiconductors {{has been proved}} to be an effective method for the <b>preparation</b> <b>of</b> the <b>photocatalysts</b> with enhanced photocatalytic performances. On the one hand, the coupling of Bi 2 WO 6 with other semiconductors will broaden the light-absorption range via the formation of intermediate energy levels. On the other hand, the recombination rate of photo-induced charge carriers will be decreased because of the charge transfer on the interfaces of heterostructures. As a result, a variety of heterostructures based on Bi 2 WO 6 have been successfully prepared, which exhibit enhanced photocatalytic activities under visible light. For instance, Yang and coworkers reported the <b>preparation</b> <b>of</b> a BiOCl-Bi 2 WO 6 heterojunction with a chemically bonded interface. The decomposition rate constant for rhodamine B is about 2 times faster than that for pure BiOCl (0.029  min− 1) and 1.5 times faster than that for Bi 2 WO 6 (0.041  min− 1) [20]. Zhang and coworkers have also succeeded in the <b>preparation</b> <b>of</b> a novel Bi 2 S 3 /Bi 2 WO 6 composite photocatalyst using hydrothermal method. The apparent rate constant is calculated to be 0.0062  min− 1 for the Bi 2 S 3 /Bi 2 WO 6 composite, which is 6.2 times higher than the corresponding value of bare Bi 2 WO 6 (0.001  min− 1) [8]. Other kinds of heterostructures such as Bi 2 WO 6 /α-Fe 2 O 3 [21], Bi 2 WO 6 /TiO 2 [22], Bi 2 WO 6 /BiOBr [23], Bi 2 WO 6 /BiIO 4 [24], and Bi 2 WO 6 /BiVO 4 [25] have also been successfully synthesized, all of which exhibit enhanced photocatalytic activities as compared to bare Bi 2 WO 6. However, developing new heterostructures based on Bi 2 WO 6 is still a big challenge for the chemists, especially by a simple and economic method.|$|R

The enhancement means the significant retardation of charge carriers’ recombination ratio {{and the introduction of}} visible light activity. This review focuses on two main ways of performance enhancement by copper species—i. e., originated from plasmonic properties of zero-valent copper (plasmonic photocatalysis) and heterojunctions between semiconductors (titania and copper oxides).

Design and fabrication of highly active catalysts in an efficient and cost-effective way is thus an important topic. This dissertation discusses our efforts in the engineering and applications of nanomaterials, which could be divided into three consecutive stages: (1) synthesis, (2) stabilization, and (3) application in catalysis. In the first stage, by using Ag nanoplates as a model system, we attempt to outline the key components that determine the formation of nanomaterials with desired morphology, clarify the roles of each reagent, provide highly reproducible recipes for synthesis, and therefore take a significant step towards the complete understanding of the mechanism behind the experimental phenomena. Using this understanding, Ag nanoplates with various aspect ratios and widely tunable SPR bands have been successfully obtained. One of the major challenges for the use of nanostructured materials as catalysts is their chemical and structural stability. In the second stage, by embedding nanocatalysts within a mesoporous metal oxide shell, we are able to prepare nanocatalysts with enhanced stability in both gas and aqueous phase reactions. A general strategy, called the "surface-protected etching" process, has been developed as the major synthetic tool for producing mesoporous shells for the stabilization of noble metal nanocatalysts. A sandwich-like structure was further proposed, in which multi-functional materials could be incorporated to make recyclable and highly efficient catalysts. Finally, for practical applications, TiO 2 -based nanomaterials have been used as the model system to investigate the factors that determine the <b>preparation</b> <b>of</b> efficient <b>photocatalysts.</b> Mesoporous TiO 2 photocatalysts with high surface area and high photocatalytic activity have been prepared through a self-assembly approach.

Various preparative routes such as wet chemical and hydrothermal methods for obtaining TiO 2 (both rutile and anatase forms), BaTiOs and SrTiO 3 fine particles and the chemical analysis of their constituents have been described in brief. Third chapter presents the results of materials characterization. T 1 O 2 (rutile and anatase), BaTiO 3 and SrTiO 3 have been characterized separately using various techniques. Different routes <b>of</b> obtaining the <b>photocatalyst</b> fine particles, heat treatment at various temperature ranges, experimental procedures and the results of characterization are brought out in this chapter. Fourth and fifth chapters present the details of degradation studies carried out on the photomineralization of chlorophenol, trichloroethylene and formaldehyde. Studies include photodegradation of the pollutants with different catalysts varying experimental conditions to check the effects of change in concentration of pollutants, oxidizer, pH, surface hydroxylation, etc. The most favorable conditions for the complete mineralization of the pollutants have been studied. In case of TiO 2, anatase form has shown greater photoactivity when compared to rutile and complete mineralization of chlorophenols has been achieved at low pollutant concentrations, neutral pH, with H 2 O 2 and UV illumination. Retarding effects of surface hydroxylation and the formation of peroxotitanium species during photodegradation have been presented. TCE and HCHO degradation with BaTiO 3 /SrTiO 3 has been studied. Photocatalyst heat-treated at 1100 °G- 1300 °C is found to be highly active in combination with H 2 O 2 as electron scavenger. HCHO is not getting degraded to its completeness in aqueous conditions owing to the strong competition in surface adsorption posed by H 2 O molecules. Vapour-solid phase reaction however gave good results in the detoxification of HCHO via disproportionation. Summary and conclusions are given at the end of the thesis...|$|R

40|$|One {{approach}} {{to improve the}} photocatalytic activity of TiO 2 catalyst is doping metal/metal ion on TiO 2 catalyst. Usually metal elements are doped on single phase TiO 2 catalysts {{and the content of}} dopant is usually larger than 1 %. In this study, we dope trace ions of transitional metals, Co and Cu, and lanthanide metal Ce on the nanofibers of mixed anatase and TiO 2 (B). There have been limited studies on photocatalytic activity of TiO 2 (B) phase and no study on the doping on nanostructure of the mixed anatase and TiO 2 (B). The doping on the mixed phase systems could be very different from that on a single phase. The dopants may distribute preferably on one of two phases or in the interface region. This can effect the mechanism and activity photocatalytic reactions. Sulforhodamine-B (SRB) was used as a model chemical to carry out the photocatalytic activity tests under UV light irradiation. It was observed that the trace metal ions doped TiO 2 fibers with pure crystalline phase, anatase or TiO 2 (B), all displayed less photocatalytic activity than the non-doped fibers, and only the doped mixed phase fibers showed improved photocatalytic degradation activity (Figure 1). Obviously, the phase interface between anatase and TiO 2 (B) {{play an important role in}} enhancing the activity <b>of</b> the <b>photocatalysts.</b> We believe that the trace metal ions promote the separation of photogenerated charge carriers, and thus to improve its photoactivity, only when they exist in the phase interface. This study highlights new opportunities for the design and <b>preparation</b> <b>of</b> highly efficient <b>photocatalysts.</b> No Full Tex...|$|R
40|$|A new {{completely}} inorganic method <b>of</b> <b>preparation</b> <b>of</b> silica–titania <b>photocatalyst</b> {{has been}} described. It {{has been established}} that the addition of silica promotes crystallinity of TiO 2 anatase phase. Relative crystallinity and TiO 2 crystal size in the silica–titania particles increase with the silica content until SiO 2 /TiO 2 molar ratio of 0. 9, but at higher molar ratios they start to decrease. The single-source precursor containing peroxo titanic (PTA) and silicic acids has been proved {{to be responsible for}} high crystallinity of TiO 2 encapsulated into amorphous silica. It has been proposed that peroxo groups enhance rapid formation of crystalline titania seeds, while silica controls their growth. It has been concluded from the TEM that the most morphologically uniform anatase crystallites covered with SiO 2 particles are prepared at SiO 2 /TiO 2 molar ratio of 0. 4. This sample, according to 29 Si NMR, also shows the high content of hydroxylated silica Q 3 and Q 2 groups, and it is the most photocatalytically active in UV-assisted decomposition of methylene blue among the tested materials. It has been determined that the increase in the amount of the condensed Q 4 silica in the mixed oxides leads to the decrease in photocatalytic performance of the material, despite its better crystallinity. High crystallinity, low degree of incorporation of Ti atoms in SiO 2 in the mixed oxide and adsorption of methylene blue in the vicinity of photoactive sites on the hydroxylated silica have been considered as the main factors determining the high degradation degree of methylene blue in the presence of silica–titania.

40|$|Quantum dot (QD) {{sensitization}} {{can increase}} the light absorption and electronic transmission <b>of</b> <b>photocatalysts.</b> However, limited {{studies have been conducted}} on the photocatalytic activity <b>of</b> <b>photocatalysts</b> after modification by noble metal QDs. In this study, we developed a simple method for fabricating Pd-QD-modified g-C 3 N 4. Results showed that the modification of Pd-QDs can improve the NO photocatalytic oxidation activity of g-C 3 N 4. Moreover, Pd-QD modification changed the NO oxidation mechanism from the synergistic action of h+ and O 2 − to the single action of ·OH. We found that the main reason for the mechanism change was that Pd-QD modification changed the molecular oxygen activation pathway from single-electron reduction to two-electron reduction. This study can not only develop a novel strategy for modifying Pd-QDs on the surface <b>of</b> <b>photocatalysts,</b> but also provides insight into the relationship between Pd-QD modification and the NO photocatalytic oxidation activity <b>of</b> semiconductor <b>photocatalysts...</b>|$|R

40|$|The {{development}} and utilization of solar energy in environmental remediation and water splitting is being intensively studied worldwide. During {{the past few}} decades, tremendous efforts have been devoted to developing non-toxic, low-cost, efficient and stable photocatalysts for water splitting and environmental remediation. To date, several hundreds <b>of</b> <b>photocatalysts</b> mainly based on metal oxides, sulfides and (oxy) nitrides with different structures and compositions have been reported.

40|$|Photocatalytically active {{printing}} ink changes its colour {{when exposed to}} UV light. The ink is based on photocatalyst which decomposes organic dye in presence of UV light causing the changes in colour. Such process {{can be used as}} a simple UV dosimeter as its colour change depends on duration to UV light exposure. We have prepared such an ink based on redox dye 2, 6 -dichloroindophenol (DCIP), photocatalyst titanium dioxide (nanodimensional anatase), reducing agent (glycerol) and two different water based binders – hydroxyethylcellulose (HEC) and polyvinyl alcohol (PVA). Prepared ink was applied onto a substrate, exposed to UV light and analysed by UV/Visible spectra. When the ink was exposed to UV light, the colour of the redox dye DCIP was changing from blue to colourless that belongs to the dihydro DCIP form. The colour change depends on several factors: on the amount of TiO 2 and UV exposure, as well as on the type of binder. In this work the influence of two selected binders and the amount <b>of</b> <b>photocatalyst</b> on the properties of ink was observed. The results show that the ink based on polyvinyl alcohol has a greater initial absorption and absorbs at higher wavelength. Colour changes were faster when higher amount <b>of</b> <b>photocatalyst</b> and HEC as a binder were used.

40|$|We {{report the}} {{formation}} of bromoform in TiO(2) suspensions (P 25) under simulated solar UV irradiation at different concentrations <b>of</b> <b>photocatalyst</b> (0. 5 - 1. 5 g L(- 1)) as well as initial concentrations of bromide ions (1 - 3 mg L(- 1)) and 2, 4 -dihydroxybenzoic acid (2 - 10 mg L(- 1)). The extent of bromoform formation (3 - 17 mu g L(- 1)) was most strongly affected by the amount <b>of</b> <b>photocatalyst</b> present and by the initial bromide concentration, increasing either of which leads to increased bromoform formation. Important interaction effects were observed when simultaneously increasing the concentrations of TiO(2) and bromide {{as well as of}} bromide and DHBA. The time it takes for bromoform. to appear in measurable concentrations in the irradiated TiO(2) suspensions was between 10 and 90 min and most strongly depended on the initial concentration of dissolved organic carbon present in the suspensions, along with the amount <b>of</b> <b>photocatalyst,</b> also in interaction with the initial bromide concentration...|$|R
