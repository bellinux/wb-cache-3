25|$|An {{early and}} {{influential}} {{book about the}} subject of a moon-landing conspiracy, We Never Went to the Moon: America's Thirty Billion Dollar Swindle, was self-published in 1976 by Bill Kaysing. Despite having no knowledge of rockets or technical writing, Kaysing, a former US Navy officer with a Bachelor of Arts in English, was hired as a senior technical writer in 1956 by Rocketdyne, the company that built the F-1 engines used on the Saturn V rocket. He served as head of the technical <b>publications</b> <b>unit</b> at the company's Propulsion Field Laboratory until 1963. Kaysing's book made many allegations, and effectively began discussion of the Moon landings being faked. The book claims that the chance of a successful manned landing on the Moon was calculated to be 0.0017%, and that despite close monitoring by the USSR, {{it would have been easier}} for NASA to fake the Moon landings than to really go there.|$|E

50|$|The State Historic Marker Program {{was started}} in 1926 by the New York State Education Department to {{acknowledge}} the Sesquicentennial of the American Revolution. During this time over 2,800 small blue cast iron site markers with yellow lettering were placed {{all over the state}} of New York {{during the time of the}} program (1926-1939). While the program lost public funding during this time period, the movement to locate and publicize local historic sites continues to be a vital resource for local historic preservation efforts continuing today.During the 1960s public funding was granted once again for placement at rest stops along the State's interstate highways and thruway. With new advances in automobiles during the 1960s cars could go much faster. It was now considered unsafe to erect small historic signs along the side of major highways. Funding then was only granted to larger, more detailed signs in places such as rest areas. During the 1960s this was a major advancement providing visitors with cultural information in a setting along routes with heavy traffic. These markers provide an overview of the History of New York, pointing out local history that makes that particular place unique and interesting. In 1970 a booklet was released containing all the text of the rest area markers. You can still purchase these booklets today from the State Museum <b>Publications</b> <b>Unit.</b>|$|E

40|$|The Information Bulletin on Variable Stars - a small {{astronomy}} journal {{published in}} Hungary - {{was an early}} Open Access journal. Now it offers several enhanced features to its reader community. Relying on the rather unique publishing environment existing {{in the field of}} astronomy, and on software developed locally, this journal is markedly different from other enhanced journals in certain aspects. We explore the key features of enhanced and common electronic journals: reference linking, database connections, data linking, multi-media content, feedback from the reader community, quality control. We argue that while exploring new avenues of scientific publishing, one should conservatively preserve some traditional values and features. Some aspects of article disassembly - dealing with items smaller than the usual basic <b>publication</b> <b>unit,</b> the article - are explored too. Figures, for example, are article components which might be re-used, used outside the original context...|$|R
