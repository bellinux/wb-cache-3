25|$|The <b>pome</b> <b>fruits</b> {{produced}} by plants in subtribe Pyrinae of family Rosaceae, such as apples and pears, have a structure (the core) in which tough tissue clearly separates the seeds {{from the outer}} softer pericarp.

40|$|The Erwinia amylovora {{incursion}} in the Royal Botanic Gardens, Melbourne (RBGM) {{in autumn}} 1997 cost the Australian <b>pome</b> <b>fruit</b> and nursery industries an estimated A$ 20 million in lost revenue. The {{cost of the}} national orchard and urban surveys, eradication programs, diagnostics, and media management was estimated at A$ 2. 2 million and involved some 250 people. As {{a result of the}} E. amylovora incursion in the RBGM, an imposition of interstate trade on the movement of host plants and related produce was enforced. These restrictions cost the Victorian <b>pome</b> <b>fruit</b> and nursery industries around A$ 7 million in lost sales and depressed prices. International trade was also suspended in some instances and the Tasmanian industry application for access to the Japanese apple market was delayed for two years and cost an estimated A$ 10 million in lost sales. Prior to and since the RBGM incursion a number of research projects have been commissioned, at a cost of A$ 0. 5 million, to formulate detailed contingency plans and diagnostic protocols and improve awareness and Australia’s preparedness for the next E. amylovora incident. The economic impact of a fire blight outbreak in Australia’s largest <b>pome</b> <b>fruit</b> growing district (Goulburn Valley, Victoria) was calculated using a dynamic multi-regional computable general equilibrium program of Australia called TERM (The Enormous Regional Model) (Horridge et al., 2003). Two separate scenarios were considered. In the first scenario an outbreak with 30 % yield losses is eradicated in five years and results in losses of A$ 260 million. In the second scenario an outbreak is not eradicated and <b>pome</b> <b>fruit</b> output in the Goulburn Valley declines by 50 % for pears and 20 % for apples and results in losses of A$ 870 million in net present value...|$|R

40|$|Recent {{studies of}} Erwinia amylovora in Montenegro, {{conducted}} from 2012 to 2014, {{indicated that the}} bacterium was widespread in the northern, continental part of the country, where the most important fruit-growing regions are situated. The presence of the bacterium was confirmed on quince, pear, apple, medlar and hawthorn. Pathogenic, cultural and biochemical characteristics of E. amylovora strains sampled from <b>pome</b> <b>fruit</b> species and indigenous flora in Montenegro had been studied previously. In the present study, serological tests were used for identification of E. amylovora strains originating from <b>pome</b> <b>fruit</b> trees and indigenous plants. Monitoring of E. amylovora and collection of samples with symptoms of bacterial fire blight from different hosts and locations were performed in Montenegro from 2012 to 2014. Isolation of the bacterium on nutrient medium produced {{a large number of}} isolates, whose pathogenicity was confirmed on immature pear fruits. Twenty-seven strains of the bacterium, originating from three <b>pome</b> <b>fruit</b> species (quince, pear and apple) and one indigenous species (hawthorn) were selected for serological analyses. Two applied serological methods, ELISA and IF test, enabled rapid detection of the bacterium and simultaneous examination {{of a large number of}} samples over a short period of time. Serological analyses showed high homogeneity in antigenic structure of the studied E. amylovora strains sampled from quince, pear, apple and hawthorn from nine locations in Montenegro...|$|R
