40|$|Adenoviruses (AdVs) are {{icosahedral}} viruses with double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) genomes. Genome packaging in AdV {{is thought}} to be similar to that seen in dsDNA containing icosahedral bacteriophages and herpesviruses. Specific recognition of the AdV genome is mediated by a packaging domain located close to the left end of the viral genome and is mediated by the viral packaging machinery. Our understanding of the role of various components of the viral packaging machinery in AdV genome packaging has greatly advanced in recent years. Characterization of empty capsids assembled in the absence of one or more components involved in <b>packaging,</b> <b>identification</b> of the unique vertex, and demonstration of the role of IVa 2, the putative packaging ATPase, in genome packaging have provided compelling evidence that AdVs follow a sequential assembly pathway. This review provides a detailed discussion on the functions of the various viral and cellular factors involved in AdV genome packaging. We conclude by briefly discussing the roles of the empty capsids, assembly intermediates, scaffolding proteins, portal vertex and DNA encapsidating enzymes in AdV assembly and packaging...|$|E

40|$|The paper {{presents}} {{a comprehensive review}} of the gas turbine hybrid vehicle (GTHV) under development at the University of Roma "Sapienza. " A GHTV is an electric vehicle (traction entirely electric on 1 or 2 axles) equipped with a small turbogas operating as a range extender and -when needed- as a recharger for other auxiliaries. After a brief review {{of the history of the}} GTHV technology, a few configurations proposed in the past by different Authors are described and critically analyzed. Then, a complete feasibility assessment of a prototype configuration of a GTHV is presented and discussed in detail. Two possible implementations are studied: one for a small city car (peak power 4 - 8 kW) and one for a sport GT or passenger sedan (50 - 100 kW). All issues related to the system and component design, <b>packaging,</b> <b>identification</b> of the "optimal" hybridization ratio, performance of the conversion chain (gas turbine+batteries+electrical motor), kinetic energy recovery systems (KERS), mechanical and electric storage devices (flywheels, capacitors, advanced batteries), monitoring and control logic, compliance with the European vehicular ECE emission regulations, are explicitly addressed. One of the most important results of this analysis is though that there are several "nearly optimal" solutions and the final choice for a possible future industrialization would be dictated by manufacturing, commercial or marketing considerations. It because not only the system performance, but also the absolute and relative sizes (i. e., nameplate power) of the turbines and of the battery package depend substantially on the type of driving mission the car is required to perform. In the paper, both theoretical and practical issues are addressed, and on the basis of the analysis of the existing state of the art, it is argued that the GTHV is an environmentally friendly, technically and economically feasible product based on mature components...|$|E

40|$|Linear barcodes—the {{ubiquitous}} alternating {{black and}} white stripes whose relative widths encode information—are used in shipping, tracking, and identification and come in more than 250 varieties. The most familiar is probably the UPC barcode used in supermarkets; based on their grocery-shopping experience, most readers probably consider the reading of barcodes a trivial problem. Indeed, when I presented a poster on this topic in May at the SIAM IS 04 conference in Salt Lake City, the most common initial response was: “Huh. I didn’t {{think this was a}} problem. ” Certainly, the problem as it appears in the checkout lane has been solved. The standard countertop laser scanner is equipped with mirrors that obtain signals from multiple angles. Handheld laser scanners are by necessity less powerful and less accurate—they are not capable of gathering multiple signals, and the optical devices cannot be as large and unwieldy as those of their countertop counterparts. Nevertheless, barcodes have found many applications outside the grocery store. Shipping companies like UPS and the US Postal Service have developed their own coding schemes for <b>package</b> <b>identification</b> and tracking. Many states issue driver’s licenses with two-dimensional barcodes that encode information about the driver and a rough sketch of the photograph. Some hospitals place barcodes on every drug container, syringe, and even patient. Entomologists glue tiny barcodes to the backs of flying insects and strategically place scanners around hives to track insect flight patterns and mating habits. Some libraries and warehouses are experimenting with inventory robots, placing barcodes not only on the items bu...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Protein {{identification}} using {{mass spectrometry}} {{is an important}} tool {{in many areas of}} the life sciences, and in proteomics research in particular. Increasing the number of proteins correctly identified is dependent on the ability to include new knowledge about the mass spectrometry fragmentation process, into computational algorithms designed to separate true matches of peptides to unidentified mass spectra from spurious matches. This discrimination is achieved by computing a function of the various features of the potential match between the observed and theoretical spectra to give a numerical approximation of their similarity. It is these underlying "metrics" that determine the ability of a protein <b>identification</b> <b>package</b> to maximise correct identifications while limiting false discovery rates. There is currently no software available specifically for the simple implementation and analysis of arbitrary novel metrics for peptide matching and for the exploration of fragmentation patterns for a given dataset. Results We present Harvest: an open source software tool for analysing fragmentation patterns and assessing the power of a new piece of information about the MS/MS fragmentation process to more clearly differentiate between correct and random peptide assignments. We demonstrate this functionality using data metrics derived from the properties of individual datasets in a peptide identification context. Using Harvest, we demonstrate how the development of such metrics may improve correct peptide assignment confidence in the context of a high-throughput proteomics experiment and characterise properties of peptide fragmentation. Conclusions Harvest provides a simple framework in C++ for analysing and prototyping metrics for peptide matching, the core of the protein identification problem. It is not a protein <b>identification</b> <b>package</b> and answers a different research question to packages such as Sequest, Mascot, X!Tandem, and other protein <b>identification</b> <b>packages.</b> It does not aim to maximise the number of assigned peptides from a set of unknown spectra, but instead provides a method by which researchers can explore fragmentation properties and assess the power of novel metrics for peptide matching in the context of a given experiment. Metrics developed using Harvest may then become candidates for later integration into protein <b>identification</b> <b>packages.</b> </p...|$|R
40|$|This Technical Review Report (TRR) {{documents}} the review, {{performed by the}} Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL) Staff, {{at the request of}} the U. S. Department of Energy (DOE), on the Safety Analysis Report for Packaging, Model 9975, Revision 0, dated January 2008 (S-SARP-G- 00003, the SARP). The review includes an evaluation of the SARP, with respect to the requirements specified in 10 CFR 71, and in International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) Safety Standards Series No. TS-R- 1. The Model 9975 - 96 Package is a 35 -gallon drum package design that has evolved from a family of packages designed by DOE contractors at the Savannah River Site. Earlier package designs, i. e., the Model 9965, the Model 9966, the Model 9967, and the Model 9968 Packagings, were originally designed and certified in the early 1980 s. In the 1990 s, updated package designs that incorporated design features consistent with the then newer safety requirements were proposed. The updated package designs at the time were the Model 9972, the Model 9973, the Model 9974, and the Model 9975 Packagings, respectively. The Model 9975 Package was certified by the Packaging Certification Program, under the Office of Safety Management and Operations. The safety analysis of the Model 9975 - 85 Packaging is documented in the Safety Analysis Report for Packaging, Model 9975, B(M) F- 85, Revision 0, dated December 2003.
