During {{the first decades}} of the 20th century, basketball quickly became the ideal interscholastic sport due to its modest equipment and <b>personnel</b> <b>requirements.</b> In the days before widespread television coverage of professional and college sports, the popularity of high school basketball was unrivaled in many parts of America. Perhaps the most legendary of high school teams was Indiana's Franklin Wonder Five, which took the nation by storm during the 1920s, dominating Indiana basketball and earning national recognition.|$|E

2500|$|Historically, OCS has {{provided}} {{the means by which}} the U.S. Army could generate large numbers of junior officers during periods of increasing <b>personnel</b> <b>requirements,</b> typically during wars. Prior to 1973, OCS was branch-specific, at one time there being eight separate schools; by 1964, the Army had consolidated OCS into two schools: Field Artillery OCS at Fort Sill, Oklahoma, and Infantry OCS at Fort Benning. The Vietnam war brought short-lived expansion of the OCS program. In 1973, OCS was made branch immaterial and was consolidated into two courses taught at Ft. Benning, and another at Fort McClellan, Alabama for female Officer Candidates; the course length was reduced to 14-weeks. In 1976, the OCS at Ft. Benning integrated females, and became the only OCS left in the active Army, with the closure of the WAC School. [...] The term [...] "90-day wonders", both as a pejorative and term of affection, has been intermittently applied to junior officers commissioned through OCS since World War II.|$|E

Structural Functionalism, Rational Choice and Differential Association theories were adopted as theoretical framework. Results show that several patterns in classroom teaching of FLHE are identifiable across the country. The study found that FLHE is taught at the Junior Secondary and Senior Secondary levels with variations among States on the beginning levels. The main mode of FLHE delivery is classroom instruction; other modes include assembly talk and sensitization by organizations. Despite paucity of Information, Education and Communication materials and inadequate <b>personnel</b> <b>requirement,</b> different stakeholders noted that FLHE has been beneficial to students.

40|$|The {{primary purpose}} of the study was to develop a model that would provide an {{efficient}} and standardized approach to workload reporting in a non-fee (HMO-like) dental care system. The model was also designed to predict the dental <b>personnel</b> resource <b>requirements</b> in the system as the overall dental needs of the population were already known. To accomplish this, a set of 246 task/procedures representing the broad scope of dental practice was developed. For each task/procedure, a Best Time-weighted Estimate (BTE) in terms of average expected man-minutes of work required for accomplishment was developed from over 35, 000 actual time measurements on patient visits to 29 US Army dental clinics located throughout the United States. Because of the nature of the specific task/procedure data, it was necessary to use four different mathematical models to produce statistically optimal BTEs. It was concluded that, cumulatively the BTEs developed for each task/procedure evaluated could be used as a basis for both the development of a Dental Care Composite Unit workload measure and the determination of overall dental <b>personnel</b> resource <b>requirements</b> in a non-free dental care system...|$|R
