40|$|SummaryObjectiveThis study {{attempted}} {{to determine whether}} exercise induced left ventricular (LV) diastolic dysfunction estimated by altered trans-mitral flow (TMF) velocity <b>pattern</b> <b>after</b> exercise is associated with increased risk of cardiac events including new-onset atrial fibrillation (AF) in elderly patients with impaired LV relaxation at rest. BackgroundDiastolic stress echocardiography {{has been applied to}} evaluate LV diastolic function during and post-exercise. Prognostic importance of exercise-induced diastolic dysfunction remains uncertain. Patients and methodsWe studied 126 patients (70 ± 5 years; 70 males) who underwent treadmill stress echocardiography. Doppler measurements were done before exercise and immediately after the post-stress image acquisition, and the ratio between early (E) and atrial (A) TMF velocities was measured. Patients with impaired LV relaxation (E/A< 1. 0) at rest were studied. Altered TMF velocity pattern was present when patients with E/A< 1. 0 at rest developed E/A≥ 1. 0 after exercise. Primary endpoints for follow-up were combination of major cardiac events and new-onset AF. ResultsThere were 42 patients with altered TMF velocity <b>pattern</b> <b>after</b> exercise. During the 5 -year follow-up period, there were 30 cardiac events including 13 new-onset AF. Kaplan–Meier survival plot demonstrated that altered TMF velocity <b>pattern</b> <b>after</b> exercise is associated with increased risk of cardiac events (p< 0. 0001) including development of new-onset AF (p= 0. 0003). Cox hazard ratio analysis demonstrated that altered TMF velocity <b>pattern</b> <b>after</b> exercise was the best predictor of cardiac events (hazard ratio 3. 939; 95 %confidence interval 1. 662 – 9. 337; p= 0. 0018). ConclusionsAltered TMF velocity <b>pattern</b> <b>after</b> exercise provides significant prognostic information for predicting cardiac events including new-onset AF in elderly patients with impaired left ventricular relaxation at rest...|$|R
30|$|EEG-patterns {{that are}} {{strongly}} associated with a poor outcome after cardiac arrest and considered “malignant patterns” include a generalized suppression to < 20  µV, burst-suppression pattern with generalized epileptiform activity, or generalized periodic complexes on a flat background [163]. In addition, a non-reactive EEG background <b>pattern</b> <b>after</b> rewarming from hypothermia treatment {{has been found to}} be a predictor of poor outcome [164]. A reactive EEG-pattern on the other hand, and a return of a continuous EEG background <b>pattern</b> <b>after</b> cardiac arrest are both {{strongly associated with}} recovery and a good outcome [163, 164].|$|R

In the San Francisco exhibit, Maeser chose {{to focus more on}} beliefs of the church and educational accomplishments of students in the church school systems. The church had an exhibit in the Manufacturers and Liberal Arts Building, and Maeser gave a series of lectures to bring more publicity to the church school exhibit. Utah's participation in the exhibit attempted to gain favor for its becoming a state. He and his companions helped distribute information about the history of Utah. No one was baptized into the church while Maeser was president of the mission; however, he did help create friendlier public-relations between Utah and California.|$|E
40|$|Abstract The {{relation}} between pri-mary headaches (PH) and pain related to spontaneous cervical artery dissection (SCAD) is still unclear, {{as well as}} the progress of PH after dissection. To investigate this relation, the characteristics of pain related to SCAD and changes in PH <b>patterns</b> <b>after</b> SCAD, we evaluated 54 con-secutive patients. Thirty-five (65 %) had previous PH. Painful SCAD occurred in 39 (72 %). Frontal and parietal localizations were significantly associated with internal carotid artery dissection (p= 0. 013 and p= 0. 010, respective-ly), whereas occipital and nuchal pain, with vertebral artery dissec-tion (p= 0. 047 and p< 0. 001, respec-tively). Previous PH did not influ-ence the presence of pain at SCAD onset. Twenty-six (74 %) patients with PH reported improvement in PH <b>pattern</b> <b>after</b> a mean follow-up of 32 months. These results sug-gest that mechanisms underlying PH do not modulate dissection-related pain. Disruption of perivas-cular afferents may be involved in improvement of PH <b>patterns</b> <b>after</b> SCAD...|$|R

The second half of the series was produced at Universal Studios in Orlando, Florida, with production beginning in April 1989. This version of the show recorded in larger studios with a larger set allowed for a lower level devoted to physical challenges and obstacles with a bigger size and, typically, bigger messes. Many episodes {{in this part of the}} series featured unique and offbeat themes that questions, challenges, and sometimes wardrobe would be <b>patterned</b> <b>after.</b> Themes included a Salute to Baseball, Backwards Day, Stupid Hat Day, a Salute to Breakfast, and two Super-Slop-a-Mania episodes featuring wrestlers and personalities from the World Wrestling Federation. Another special episode saw Summers and Harvey each team with a contestant to compete against each other, with Jim J. Bullock taking over hosting duties. By the end of Super Sloppy Double Dare, the program was syndicated to 154 stations. The series left syndication on September 8, 1989.|$|E
