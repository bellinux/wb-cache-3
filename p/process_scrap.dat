5000|$|Treatment Waste: Treatment waste {{consists}} of sludge, byproducts, coproducts, or metal scraps {{resulting from a}} facility or plant. Sludge is any solid, semisolid, or liquid waste generated from a municipal, commercial, or industrial wastewater treatment plant, water supply treatment plant, or air pollution control facility exclusive of the treated effluent from a wastewater treatment plant. This includes electric arc furnace dust and baghouse dusts. A byproduct is a material {{that is not a}} primary product which is not solely or separately produced in a production process whereas coproducts are intentionally produced. Byproducts need further processing to be useful whereas coproducts are highly processed and can be sold as a commodity without further processing. Examples of byproducts include slag, fly ash, heavy ends, distillation column bottoms, etc. and coproducts include metals such as lead produced during the copper refining <b>process.</b> <b>Scrap</b> metal wastes include sheet metal, wire, metal tanks and containers, scrap automobiles, and machine shop turnings that are generally nonhazardous in nature.|$|E

The aims of this project were to investigate and characterise the surface/near surface oxidation behaviour of bulk NdFeB magnets, in air, at room temperature as well as attempting to track the oxygen content throughout the re-sintering process developed at the University of Birmingham. Surface oxidation appeared to be exclusive to the Nd-rich triple junctions {{on the surface of the}} material, which is unlike higher temperature oxidation observed on sintered NdFeB magnets [Li, 2002]. Alloying additions of Dy and Co were also shown to increase the resistance to oxidation of NdFeB magnets. SIMS analysis showed that oxygen was concentrated in the grain boundary phase in the near surface. The oxygen content was shown to increase almost linearly throughout the recycling process outlined in this report with an overall increase of ~ 1100 - 1200 ppm, which is much smaller than that observed for commercial primary production of sintered NdFeB magnets...|$|E
40|$|Mercury is a {{pollutant}} {{that causes}} great concern to regulators in the nation, {{and especially to}} the states that {{are located in the}} Great Lakes Region of the United States. Mercury is considered a significant environmental problem due to its ability to bioaccumulate in the aquatic food chain, and eventually affect human health. Mercury is released into the atmosphere by natural as well as anthropogenic sources. Some of the anthropogenic sources include coal-fired utility plants and other industrial processes. In Ohio, we have taken a proactive approach to identify some of the other sources that emit mercury into the atmosphere. Routine emission testing in mid- 1999 showed that steel scrap processing facilities could be fairly large sources of mercury emissions. Following this finding, Ohio EPA sent out a survey to all facilities that melt or otherwise <b>process</b> <b>scrap</b> metal to determine the possible extent of mercury emissions caused by scrap processing/melting facilities.

40|$|Electric arc {{furnaces}} (EAFs) {{contribute to}} almost {{one third of}} the global steel production. Arc furnaces use a large amount of electrical energy to <b>process</b> <b>scrap</b> or reduced iron and are relevant to study because small improvements in their efficiency account for significant energy savings. Optimal controllers need to be designed and proposed to enhance both process performance and energy consumption. Due to the random and chaotic nature of the electric arcs, neural networks and other soft computing techniques have been used for modeling EAFs. This study proposes a methodology for modeling EAFs that considers the time varying arc length as a relevant input parameter to the arc furnace model. Based on actual voltages and current measurements taken from an arc furnace, it was possible to estimate an arc length suitable for modeling the arc furnace using neural networks. The obtained results show that the model reproduces not only the stable arc conditions but also the unstable arc conditions, which are difficult to identify in a real heat process. The presented model can be applied for the development and testing of control systems to improve furnace energy efficiency and productivity...|$|E

In the Peirce-Smith converter operation, the additions of cold solids in liquid matte {{in the form}} of fluxing agents (silica sands) for slag liquidity, <b>process</b> <b>scrap</b> and reverts for temperature control is a common practice. It is reasonable to postulate that with such practice, solid-liquid mass transfer step may {{play an important role in}} the performance and attainment of liquid bath homogeneity of the process. In this work, solid additions were simulated with sintered benzoic acid compacts spatially positioned in a 1 : 5 water model of a Peirce-Smith converter. Water and kerosene were used to simulate matte and slag respectively. Solid-liquid mass transfer was characterized by experimentally determined mass transfer coefficient, K (ms- 1) values of benzoic acid sintered compacts and calculated dimensionless turbulence characteristic, Tc values. The mass transfer coefficients and dimensionless turbulence characteristic values were highest at the bath surface and near plume region. The values decreased in identified dead zones in the regions close to the circular side walls of the model. The results revealed that the mass transfer coefficients and turbulence characteristics were different with respect to different submergence levels of the compacts. These findings lead to the conclusion that the fluid flow was stratified within the vessel...|$|E

This study focusses on the first steps in using TPC <b>process</b> <b>scrap</b> on a scale in which its maximum potential can be utilised. It entails the mechanical response viz. elastic properties and strength of the flake reinforced plates under uniaxial tension. The plates were manufactured by compression moulding of flakes made of woven glass fabric reinforced thermoplastic polyurethane (TPU), oriented randomly within the plate. The randomness in {{the orientation of the}} flakes is evident from the observed in-plane isotropic behaviour in the experiments. Failure is in most cases dominated by the matrix and changes its path to avoid the flakes. The failure surface observation revealed regions of good and also regions of poor fibre-matrix as well as flake- matrix adhesion. Different classes of flake sizes were used to produce plate samples. The relationship between the flake size and mechanical properties were not statistically significant due to the similarities observed in the size distribution between the different classes of flakes used. The measured strength and stiffness values are compared with existing values and analytical results. The analytical results for stiffness and strength were found to be close to the measurements by 8 % on average, which shows a fairly good agreement of the idealised theory where the effect of interactions between reinforcements are not included...|$|E

The investigated steel was melted in the oxygen-recovery melting technology with an application of maximum 70 % of the <b>process</b> <b>scrap.</b> In addition, after steel melting in the electric arc furnace (EAF), the secondary metallurgy was performed in the ladle furnace (LF). It was shown that {{the application of the}} secondary metallurgy by a synthetic slag in the ladle furnace and argon bubbling of a metal bath leads to obtaining in the final analysis: 0. 0043 - 0. 0046 % of sulphur (a decrease of S content during refining in LF reached 40 %). Current measurements of FeO in the slag and maintaining its content below 0. 8 %, support obtaining such low sulphur content in steel. So low level of the slag oxidizing is one of the necessary conditions for a deep desulphurisation of the metal bath. Without the secondary metallurgy the sulphur content in low-alloy cast steel was 0. 007 %, while 0. 01 % in high-alloy cast steel. Controlling of the gas (oxygen, nitrogen) content during steel melting and correcting the amount of additions (e. g. deoxidants), allowed to obtain the low oxygen content (below 45 ppm for two investigated steel grades) and nitrogen content (88 ppm for low-alloy steel and 330 ppm for high-alloy steel), which warrants a good combination of strength and plastic properties...|$|E

Design/methodology/approach: Each of these methods have a undoubted advantages but also have a numberof disadvantages. In foundry engineering practice the most essential parameters of this process are to obtain ashigh as possible degree of carbon assimilation from carburizer, in as short as possible time, with high processrepeatability. Findings: Decrease of share or elimination of the pig iron from charge materials causes significant reduction ofcast iron melt costs.

30|$|Alloying {{elements}} {{once collected}} by Japan are widely distributed across the Japanese economy {{as well as}} other countries embodying GHG emissions. Although the proportions of each country’s responsibility for GHG emissions are not large individually, demand for Japanese products from other countries has induced large imports of metal sources by Japan. However, reducing demand for Japanese products would be an unsuitable solution to reduce impacts on the metal mining and producing countries sustainably. Therefore, Japan must {{play a key role in}} the reduction in the impact of metal consumption in this supply chain. If it could maintain supply to other countries and reduce its imports of metal sources, the responsibility shared by each country would decrease. To achieve this, the utilization of urban mines in Japan (i.e., recycling) would be important. Currently, recycling alloying elements from scrap (except <b>process</b> <b>scrap</b> and stainless steel scrap) is rarely taken into account, whereas steel scrap is highly recycled (Ohno et al. 2014). In particular, although automobiles contain a large amount of alloying elements as shown in “Results,” most of alloying elements in end-of-life (EoL) vehicles tend to be losses by dissipating into steelmaking slag and/or contaminating into molten steel during the recycling of EoL vehicle-derived steel scrap (Nakajima et al. 2011 b, 2013; Ohno et al. 2014). On the contrary, EoL vehicle-derived steel scrap can be a source of alloying elements to substitute 46 – 63  kt of ferroalloy production by appropriate treatment and sorting during recycling (Ohno et al. 2015). Because this substitutable mass corresponds to a 318 – 609 -kt-CO 2 reduction in embodied GHG emissions, it has a significant effect on the reduction in the responsibility. To obtain this benefit from EoL vehicle recycling, appropriate policy and scrap prices must be established (Ohno et al. 2015). For this need, Japan should ask the top four above-mentioned countries (i.e., South Korea, China, the USA, and Taiwan) each sharing around 10 % of the responsibility to contribute.|$|E
40|$|The DC {{casting process}} {{used for the}} {{production}} of cast aluminium alloy products intended for processing by rolling, extrusion or forging is an economically important process with approximately 10 million tonnes of DC cast product being produced annually world wide [1]. Process productivity, particularly with respect to elimination of casting defects and hence <b>process</b> <b>scrap</b> is an important factor to DC cast product producers. The literature reporting the DC casting process, particularly with respect to the formation of defects on the cast surface, is reviewed and the mechanisms for the formation of such defects examined. A universally understood and accepted explanation was found for only one of the normal surface defects encountered in practice. A number of samples of commercially cast DC products were subject to detailed cast surface examination, particularly surface microstructures. The results of this examination and the literature survey identified molten metal surface tension as a possible contributing factor affecting the molten metal meniscus stability within the DC casting mould. Meniscus instability is linked with the formation of surface defects. The literature on surface tension of aluminium alloys provided only limited information hence the surface tension of a range of binary and ternary alloys, including commercial alloys was determined, producing data hitherto not available. Of the common alloying elements used in commercial aluminium alloys, iron and magnesium were found to significantly reduce the surface tension. Surface fracture also resulted in a reduction in surface tension for the majority of alloys tested. The surface tension data is combined with mould thermal and physical model calculations to propose a mechanism for the formation of the cast surface defects. The model proposes a maximum stable size for the meniscus according to the alloy and mould conditions. Conditions outside these limits result in meniscus instability and the formation of cast surface defects. The model suggests possible operating changes that may reduce the incidence of surface defect formation. The work also identifies a number of areas requiring further investigation before major practical process changes aimed at cast surface defect elimination, may be formulated...|$|E
40|$|Resourceful Energy is a startup venture set {{to engage}} in {{value-added}} applications for 900 tons of scrap tires discarded annually {{in the state of}} Arizona. Resourceful Energy will collect, sort, and <b>process</b> <b>scrap</b> tires into a Tire-Derived Fuel (TDF) compound. The processed TDF will be sold to cement factories, power plants, and industrial manufacturers in the Arizona region as an environmentally friendly substitute to coal fuels. TDF burns cleaner and more efficiently than coal and is significantly less expensive. The EPA-supported fuel is a technology that has yet to penetrate the Arizona industrial market as other companies have focused their efforts in more concentrated metropolitan areas. Resourceful Energy will turn the state’s own supply of scrap tires into one of its most valuable sources of industrial fuel. While TDF is the main product offered to our customers, our business model includes three separate revenue streams. A $ 2. 50 per-tire fee will be assessed when tires are collected from local tire retailers. This service revenue contributes nearly 70 % to our total annual revenue. The tires collected will be sorted, and those with remaining useful tread will be sold to local used tire outlets for $ 8. 00 per tire. Finally, the remaining inventory of scrap tires will be fed through a series of shredders and conveyors and packaged as TDF to be delivered to cement manufacturing plants. Additionally, we will engage in research and development projects aimed to identify additional innovative applications for recycled tire rubber. In year 1 we project an EBITDA of $ 180, 000. We expect to sell the company in year 5 with an EBITDA of $ 1, 800, 000. Based on our research of Waste Management and Allied Waste the benchmark P/E ratio for our industry is 17. 5. Using this ratio, our year 5 value will be $ 32, 000, 000.
