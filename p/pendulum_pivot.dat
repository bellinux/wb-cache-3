40|$|In {{locomotion}} {{that involves}} repetitive motion of propulsive structures (arms, legs, fins, wings) there are resonant frequencies f* {{at which the}} energy consumption is a minimum. As animals need to change their speed, they can maintain this energy minimum by tuning their body resonances. We discuss the physical principles of frequency tuning, and how it relates to forces, damping, and oscillation amplitude. The resonant frequency of pendulum-type oscillators (e. g. swinging arms and legs) may be changed by varying the mass moment of inertia, or the vertical acceleration of the <b>pendulum</b> <b>pivot.</b> The frequency of elastic vibrations (e. g. the bell of a jellyfish) can be tuned with a non-linear modulus of elasticity: soft for low deflection amplitudes (low resonant frequency), and stiff for large displacements (high resonant frequency). Tuning of elastic oscillations can also be achieved by changing the effective length or cross-sectional area of the elastic members, or by allowing springs in parallel or in series to become active. We propose that swimming and flying animals generate oscillating propulsive forces from precisely placed shed vortices and that these tuned motions can only occur when vortex shedding and the simple harmonic motion of the elastic elements of the propulsive structures are in resonance...|$|E
40|$|A new concept, extracting {{energy from}} sea waves by {{parametric}} pendulor, has been explored in this project. It {{is based on}} the conversion of vertical oscillations to rotational motion by means of a parametrically-excited pendulor, i. e. a pendulum operating in rotational mode. The main advantage of this concept lies in a direct conversion from vertical oscillations to rotations of the <b>pendulum</b> <b>pivot.</b> This thesis, firstly, reviewed a number of well established linear and nonlinear theories of sea waves and Airy’s sea wave model has been used in the modelling of the sea waves and a parametric pendulum excited by sea waves. The third or fifth order Stokes’s models can be potentially implemented in the future studies. The equation of motion obtained for a parametric pendulum excited by sea waves has the same form as for a simple parametrically-excited pendulum. Then, to deepen the fundamental understanding, an extensive theoretical analysis has been conducted on a parametrically-excited pendulum by using both numerical and analytical methods. The numerical investigations focused on the bifurcation scenarios and resonance structures, particularly, for the rotational motions. Analytical analysis of the system has been performed by applying the perturbation techniques. The approximate solutions, resonance boundary and existing boundary of rotations have been obtained with a good correspondence to numerical results. The experimental study has been carried out by exploring oscillations, rotations and chaotic motions of the pendulum. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|E
40|$|A {{variation}} of a hanging pendulum thrust stand capable of measuring {{the performance of}} an electric thruster operating in the vertical orientation is presented. The vertical orientation of the thruster dictates that the thruster must be horizontally offset from the <b>pendulum</b> <b>pivot</b> arm, necessitating {{the use of a}} counterweight system to provide a neutrally-stable system. Motion of the pendulum arm is transferred through a balance mechanism to a secondary arm on which deflection is measured. A non-contact light-based transducer is used to measure displacement of the secondary beam. The members experience very little friction, rotating on twisting torsional pivots with oscillatory motion attenuated by a passive, eddy current damper. Displacement is calibrated using an in situ thrust calibration system. Thermal management and self-leveling systems are incorporated to mitigate thermal and mechanical drifts. Gravitational restoring force and torsional spring constants associated with flexure pivots provide restoring moments. An analysis of the design indicates that the thrust measurement range spans roughly four decades, with the stand capable of measuring thrust up to 12 N for a 200 kg thruster and up to approximately 800 mN for a 10 kg thruster. Data obtained from calibration tests performed using a 26. 8 lbm simulated thruster indicated a resolution of 1 mN on 100 mN-level thrusts, while those tests conducted on 200 lbm thruster yielded a resolution of roughly 2. 5 micro at thrust levels of 0. 5 N and greater...|$|E

We examine the development of modulational instability in a driven pendulum chain and find both a critical chain length and critical frequency for the appearance of the instability. We study the breather solutions and show their connection to the single pendulum dynamics, and extend our analysis to consider multi-frequency breathers connected to the period- 3 periodic solution, showing also the possibility of stability in these breather states. Finally we examine the problem of breather generation and demonstrate a robust scheme for generation of on-site and off-site breathers. Comment: 12 pages, 23 figure...|$|R

40|$|From a biomechanical {{point of}} view quiet {{standing}} {{can be described as}} the motion of a human inverted <b>pendulum</b> <b>pivoted</b> at the ankle joints. According to this model the motion is determined by gravity, the physical properties of the pendulum (moment of inertia, mass, center of mass) and the active and passive force-contributions from muscle-tendon systems acting over the ankle joint. The muscle-tendon system of central importance for mantaining erect posture is the “shaft ” muscle gastrocnemius (GA) and its tendon. This is emphasized by measurements which show a close relationship between the GA muscle activity as measured by electromyography (EMG) and the forward-backward motion location of the center-of-pressure (COP). While GA seems {{to be in charge of}} the phasic (modulating) control mode, the soleus (SL) sets the basic tonus. Our hypothesis is that the GA-activity is linked to “dynamic stiffness control ” which is necessary in order to achieve postural stability given the compliant tendon. Thus, the characteristic swayings observed in quiet standing constitute an integral and essential part of the stabilization system and are not just some “disturbance ” or “noise”. Key words: quiet standing, stiffness, center-of-pressure (COP), electromyography (EMG), gastrocnemius, inverted pendulum model. I...|$|R
40|$|The {{behavior}} of a stationary inverted point mass <b>pendulum</b> <b>pivoted</b> at its lower end in a gravitational potential is studied {{under the influence of}} statistical fluctuations. It is shown using purely classical equations that the pendulum eventually tips over i. e evolves out of its initial position of unstable equilibrium, and, in a finite amount of time points down assuming a position of stable equilibrium. This `tipping time' is calculated by solving the appropriate Fokker- Planck equation in the overdamped limit. It is also shown that the asymptotic time solution for probability corresponds to the Boltzmann distribution, as expected for a system in stable equilibrium, and that the tipping time tends to infinity as the parameter corresponding to the strength of thermal fluctuations is tuned to zero, thereby defining the limit where one recovers the classical result that a stationary inverted point mass pendulum never tips over. The paper provides a unique perspective showing that phenomena like tipping that have been often attributed to quantum mechanics can be studied even in the domain of purely classical physics.

40|$|Seismometers for {{measuring}} horizontal vibrations respond {{not only to}} the required ground motion but also to unwanted tilts, caused by atmospheric or local effects. Because of the equivalence of inertial and gravitational accelerations, {{it is not possible to}} separate these effects in a single instrument. However, absolute rotation is detectable and an angular accelerometer has been developed, responding only to tilt and not to either horizontal or vertical ground motion. The design of the instrument is very similar to that of a modern horizontal-component seismometer, comprising a double balanced <b>pendulum</b> <b>pivoted</b> at its centre of gravity and operated in a force feedback configuration. Details of the design, testing and cabibration are presented. The instrument was operated in a seismic vault for several weeks, together with standard borehole and surface-mounted seismometers.

Recordings obtained under different conditions of wind and seismic activity are presented and attempts made to reduce the effects of tilt on the surface recordings by subtracting the signal from the angular accelerometer after suitable processing. The tilt signal proved to be rather low, except on very windy days, so that complete correction for tilt was not possible. Suggestions are made for improving the instrument to make it useful in seismic vaults. Key words: angular accelerometers, seismometers, tilt removal. ...|$|R

40|$|The {{main purpose}} of this {{investigation}} {{is to show that}} a <b>pendulum,</b> whose <b>pivot</b> oscillates vertically in a periodic fashion, has uncountably many chaotic orbits. The attribute chaotic is given according to the criterion we now describe. First, we associate to any orbit a finite or infinite sequence as follows. We write 1 or $- 1 $ every time the pendulum crosses the position of unstable equilibrium with positive (counterclockwise) or negative (clockwise) velocity, respectively. We write 0 whenever we find a pair of consecutive zero's of the velocity separated only by a crossing of the stable equilibrium, and with the understanding that different pairs cannot share a common time of zero velocity. Finally, the symbol $omega$, that is used only as the ending symbol of a finite sequence, indicates that the orbit tends asymptotically to the position of unstable equilibrium. Every infinite sequence of the three symbols ${ 1,- 1, 0 }$ represents a real number of the interval $[0, 1]$ written in base 3 when $- 1 $ is replaced with 2. An orbit is considered chaotic whenever the associated sequence of the three symbols ${ 1, 2, 0 }$ is an irrational number of $[0, 1]$.

5000|$|The {{pendulum}} rocket fallacy is {{a common}} fundamental misunderstanding of the mechanics of rocket flight and how rockets remain on a stable trajectory. The first liquid-fuel rocket, constructed by Robert Goddard in 1926, differed significantly from modern rockets in that the rocket engine {{was at the top}} and the fuel tank {{at the bottom of the}} rocket. It was believed that, in flight, the rocket would [...] "hang" [...] from the engine like a <b>pendulum</b> from a <b>pivot,</b> and the weight of the fuel tank would be all that was needed to keep the rocket flying straight up. This belief is incorrect. In actuality, the stability of such a rocket is dependent on other factors.

2500|$|Invariable pendulums: [...] Kater {{introduced}} {{the idea of}} relative gravity measurements, to supplement the absolute measurements made by a Kater's pendulum. [...] Comparing the gravity at two different points was an easier process than measuring it absolutely by the Kater method. All that was necessary was to time the period of an ordinary (single <b>pivot)</b> <b>pendulum</b> at the first point, then transport the pendulum to the other point and time its period there. Since the pendulum's length was constant, from (1) {{the ratio of the}} gravitational accelerations was equal to the inverse of the ratio of the periods squared, and no precision length measurements were necessary. So once the gravity had been measured absolutely at some central station, by the Kater or other accurate method, the gravity at other points could be found by swinging pendulums at the central station and then taking them to the other location and timing their swing there. Kater made up a set of [...] "invariable" [...] pendulums, with only one knife edge pivot, which were taken to many countries after first being swung at a central station at Kew Observatory, UK.|$|R
40|$|The {{effect of}} gravity {{modulation}} on the instability onset in an infinite horizontal layer of double-diffusive fluid is investigated in this dissertation. The spectral-Galerkin method is used to transform the linearized perturbation equations to the system of time-periodic ordinary differentiate equations. The Chebyshev expansion method (Sinha and Wu, 1991) is applied to calculate the foundamental matrix {{which is used to}} determine the stability of the system according to the Floquet theory. Fluids of Prandtl number Pr = 0. 01, 1, and 7 are investigated. The instability onsets in one of three modes, synchronous, subharmonic, and quasi periodic mode. In the synchronous mode, the instability oscillates at the same frequency as the gravity modulation O, in the subharmonic mode, the instability oscillates at O/ 2, while in the quasi-periodic mode, the oscillation frequency of the instability is different from the above two. The quasi-periodic mode onsets at the same thermal Rayleigh number, RT as that of instability onset under steady gravity. The subharmonic mode onsets with wave numbers in the neighboring region of k where the oscillation frequency of the instability onset in the steady-g case, o, equals to half of the modulation frequency, O/ 2. Similarly, the synchronous mode onsets at the neighboring of k where the o equals to O. The onset RT for quasi-periodic mode is not changed by the modulation frequency O and the relative amplitude of the modulation, h. For the synchronous and subharmonic modes, destabilization increases with increasing h. If h is large enough, the subharmonic mode will be more unstable than the synchronous and quasi periodic mode, so the instability mode will be switched by increasing h. For a given h with varying O, the resonance effect occurs in the neighborhood of O ≈ 2 o cr, i. e, twice the critical oscillation frequency of the instability in the steady-g case associated with the critical RT. The resonant phenomena is found for fluids with Pr = 0. 01, 1, and 7, and the effect diminishes as the Prandtl number increases. The {{effect of gravity}} modulation is asymptotic to zero when the modulated frequency O approaches zero and infinitely large. For the case of Prandtl number, Pr, = 0. 01, it is found that the critical thermal Rayleigh number RT is reduced from the steady-g value of 2183 by 4 %, 41 %, and 86 % as h is increased from 0. 01, 0. 1 and 0. 2. In fact when h = 0. 22737, the layer of fluid is destabilized at O = 9. 1 with RT = 0, i. e., without heating from below. This is analogous to the case in the research of Gresho and Sani (1970) that a horizontal layer being heated from above can be destabilized by the oscillation of the layer. In this dissertation the stabilization effect caused by the modulation is found at some cases of O, which is analogous to the stability of motion of the <b>pendulum</b> with <b>pivot</b> in oscillation as discussed in Gresho and Sani (1970) ...|$|R
