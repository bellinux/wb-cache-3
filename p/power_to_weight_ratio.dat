25|$|Oliver Evans began {{developing}} a high pressure steam engine {{that was more}} practical than the engine developed {{around the same time}} by Richard Trevithick in England.

Evans produced a few custom steam engines from 1801 to 1806, when he opened the Mars Works foundry and factory near Philadelphia, where he produced additional engines. In 1812 he produced his successful Colombian engine at Mars. As his business grew and orders were being shipped inland, Evans and a partner formed the Pittsburgh Steam Engine Company in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. Steam engines soon became common in public water supply, sawmills and flour milling, especially in areas with little or no water power.|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to compare the {{kinematic}} features of motorcycles with those of passenger cars in urban traffic. The hypothesis that motorcycles' capability to swerve in urban traffic contributes to their seemingly assertive behaviour is examined. Data for this study were collected in afternoon peak hours at Central London using video recorders. Detailed information on the trajectories of 2109 vehicles (including 477 motorcycles and 1293 passenger cars) was extracted from the video images and the observable kinematic features were analysed. In addition, a model describing the longitudinal following behaviour of motorcycles was employed to analyse the impacts of motorcycles' swerving behaviour. The model was calibrated using Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) numerical methods. The observable kinematic features show that in comparison to passenger cars, motorcycles have shorter safety gaps, higher speeds and severer acceleration and deceleration rates reflecting their generally much higher <b>power</b> <b>to</b> <b>weight</b> <b>ratios</b> and usage of available braking power.

50|$|Diesel engines {{produce more}} torque than petrol engines {{for a given}} {{displacement}} due to their higher compression ratio. Higher pressure in the cylinder and higher forces on the connecting rods and crankshaft require stronger, heavier components. Heavier rotating components prevent diesel engines from revving as high as petrol engines for a given displacement. Diesel engines generally have similar power and inferior <b>power</b> <b>to</b> <b>weight</b> <b>ratios</b> as compared <b>to</b> petrol engines. Petrol engines must be geared lower {{to get the same}} torque as a comparable diesel but since petrol engines rev higher both will have similar acceleration. An arbitrary amount of torque at the wheels can be gained by gearing any power source down sufficiently (including a hand crank). For example, a theoretical engine with a constant 200 ft.lbs of torque and a 3000 rpm rev limit has just as much power (a little over 114 hp) as another theoretical engine with a constant maximum 100 ft.lbs of torque and a 6000 rpm rev limit. A (lossless) 2 to 1 reduction gear on the second engine will output a constant maximum 200 ft.lbs of torque at a maximum of 3000 rpm, with no change in power. Comparing engines based on (maximum) torque is just as useful as comparing them based on (maximum) rpm.|$|R

The aerodynamics feature new and updated canards on the front, as well as a vertical stabilizer supporting the main rear wing. Beside using R Evolución's body, the Zonda Revolución also features a DRS (Drag Reduction System) on the rear wing. The system has two different operating modes, both can be activated by the driver at any time. The manual system is controlled with the DRS button on the steering wheel. The rear wing changes between maximum and minimum down-force settings, at the occurrence of a lateral acceleration of 0.8 g and a minimum speed of [...] Holding down the DRS for more than two seconds engages the DRS to work automatically according to the algorithms developed by the Pagani engineers during the development phase.

40|$|NASA is {{currently}} working on developing motors for hybrid electric propulsion applications in aviation. <b>To</b> make electric <b>power</b> more feasible in airplanes higher <b>power</b> <b>to</b> <b>weight</b> <b>ratios</b> are sought for electric motors. One facet to these efforts is to improve (increase) the conductivity and (lower) density of the magnet wire used in motors. Carbon nanotubes (CNT) and composites containing CNT are being explored as a possible way to increase wire conductivity and lower density. Presented here are measurements of the current carrying capacity (ampacity) of a composite made from CNT and copper. The ability of CNT to improve the conductivity of such composites is hindered by the presence of semiconductive CNT (s-CNT) that exist in CNT supplies naturally, and currently, unavoidably. To solve this problem, and avoid s-CNT, various preferential growth and sorting methods are being explored. A supply of sorted 95 metallic CNT (m-CNT) was acquired in the form of thick film Buckypaper (BP) as part of this work and characterized using Raman spectroscopy, resistivity, and density measurements. The ampacity (Acm 2) of the Cu- 5 volCNT composite was 3. 8 lower than the same gauge pure Cu wire similarly tested. The lower ampacity in the composite wire is believed to be due to the presence of s-CNT in the composite and the relatively low (proper) level of longitudinal cooling employed in the test method. Although Raman spectroscopy can be used to characterize CNT, a strong relation between the ratios of the primary peaks GGand the relative amounts of m-CNT and s-CNT was not observed. The average effective conductivity of the CNT in the sorted, 95 m-CNT BP was 2. 5 times higher than the CNT in the similar but un-sorted BP. This is an indication that improvements in the conductivity of CNT composites can be made by the use of sorted, highly conductive m-CNT...|$|R

40|$|This {{research}} study focuses on developing a pneumatic robot arm for industrial applications, where the discussion here is narrowed {{down to the}} application of Pneumatic Artificial Muscles (PAM) on bicep configuration. When compared with other robotic actuators Pneumatic muscles have several advantages such as lower <b>power</b> <b>to</b> <b>weight</b> <b>ratios,</b> high strength, lightweight and easiness of employment. Hence pneumatic artificial muscles have become more attractive actuators in industrial robotics applications. A pneumatic muscle analysis was carried out {{with the help of}} practical results which were obtained with a prototype experiment. It was realized that the muscle behaves in a non-linear manner which is the main disadvantage. The system equation is linearised in order to derive the state space model. With this the system would be linearised only within a small range of inputs, where it is impossible {{to use it as a}} general model with whole range of inputs. A simulation study has been carried out for the system using Matlab/Simulink environment for various categories of inputs and it is experienced that the system responded to linear input signal, as per anticipated output of the theoretical analysis. Even though the above paradigm is discussed for single pneumatic sub-systems, it is emphasized, that the same approach can effectively be extended without any major conceptual breakthrough to any number of muscles. Depending on the application the pneumatic muscle may require different contraction profiles, where the controlling task of the muscle contraction would be vital. To obtain the desired tracking of the actual performance, Inversion Based Control (IBC) concept has been employed. Simulated results showed the proposed methodology could be effectively applied. Further, investigations need to be carried out to model the complete system with other perturbations and apply the inversion based control concept for precise control of the tip of the arm...|$|R

Modern high performance turbomachinery providing increased <b>power</b> <b>to</b> <b>weight</b> <b>ratios</b> and larger efficiencies are designed to operate at higher speeds than prior designs. These machines are more sensitive to imbalance since they must traverse critical speeds. Adding damping to a rotor-bearing system reduces vibration amplitudes and provides isolation from the support structure. Squeeze film dampers (SFD), if properly employed, have been shown to effectively provide viscous damping and attenuate imbalance response. Present SFD modeling does not always provide reliable rotordynamic coefficient predictions due to omission of important phenomena or from a lack of experimental validation. The design, construction and operation of a rotordynamic SFD test rig is presented. The test rig consists of a massive rotor supported on two elastically supported SFDs. The SFDs, consistent with many current aircraft engine designs, are characterized by a slenderness ratio and a clearance to journal radius equal to 0. 243 and 0. 005, respectively. The rotor-bearing system is designed to have two rigid mode critical speeds (cylindrical and conical) below the 9, 000 rpm maximum. All significant variables are measured and controlled during construction and testing. Impedance measurements (at zero rpm) and imbalance tests are performed to characterize the damping coefficients from the SFDs. System damping coefficients are extracted from the imbalance response results at the speed of maximum amplitude of motion. Amplification factors from 1. 6 to 2. 1 are found in the synchronous response to imbalance tests. Experimental damping and system variables are used in a linear rotordynamic model to predict the experimental imbalance responses. Experimental amplitudes of vibration and damping forces are proportional to the imbalance magnitude. Measured damping coefficients are lower than those predicted by a full film SFD model. The damping levels are also verified {{to be sensitive to the}} magnitude of lubricant viscosity...|$|R
