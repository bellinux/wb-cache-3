40|$|Background. The {{goal of this}} {{investigation}} was to evaluate adequacy of the design of readily available <b>paediatric</b> cuffed tracheal <b>tubes</b> (CPTT). Methods. In 15 series of cuffed (11) and uncuffed (four) <b>paediatric</b> tracheal <b>tubes</b> (ID: 2. 5 - 7. 0 mm) from four different manufacturers the following dimensions were measured: outer diameter of the tube, position and largest diameter of the tube cuff inflated at 20 cm H 2 O and position of depth markings and compared with age‐related dimensions. Results. Outer diameters for tubes with similar IDs varied markedly between manufacturers and between cuffed and uncuffed tracheal tubes from the same manufacturer. Cuff diameters at 20 cm H 2 O cuff pressure and cross‐sectional cuff area at 20 cm H 2 O cuff pressure did not always cover maximal internal age‐related tracheal diameters and cross‐sectional areas. Placing the tube tip in the mid‐trachea, the cuffs of cuffed tubes with ID 3. 0, 4. 0, or 5. 0 mm would become positioned within the larynx. If the cuffs were placed 1 cm below the cricoid level, many of the tube tips would be dangerously deep within the trachea. Only five of the 11 cuffed tubes had a depth marking. In many of these tubes the distances from depth marking to tube tip were greater than the age‐related minimal tracheal length. Conclusion. Most cuffed <b>paediatric</b> tracheal <b>tubes</b> are poorly designed, in particular the smaller sizes. A better design of cuffed tubes with a short high‐volume, low‐pressure cuff, cuff‐free subglottic space and adequately placed depth markings are urgently needed. Br J Anaesth 2004; 92 : 78 - 8...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND: The aim of {{this study}} was to compare {{intubation}} depth using the Microcuff <b>paediatric</b> endotracheal <b>tube</b> (PET) placed with the intubation depth mark between the vocal cords with that of different published formulae/recommendations for nasotracheal intubation depth in children. METHODS: Children aged from birth to 10 yr undergoing elective surgery with nasotracheal intubation were included. Tracheal tubes were adjusted according to the intubation depth mark between the vocal cords using direct laryngoscopy. Nasal intubation depth was recorded and the distance 'tube tip to carina' was measured endoscopically. Based on the recorded nasal intubation depth and measured distance 'tube tip to carina', the position of tube tip and cuff was calculated according to six published formulae/recommendations.

40|$|Background. The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} the appropriateness of intubation depth marks on the new Microcuff <b>paediatric</b> tracheal <b>tube.</b> Methods. With local Institutional Ethics Committee approval and informed parental consent, we included patients from birth (weighing ≥ 3 kg) to 16 yr who were undergoing general anaesthesia requiring orotracheal intubation. Tracheal intubation was performed using direct laryngoscopy, the intubation depth mark was placed between the vocal cords, and the tube was taped to the lateral corner of the mouth. The distance between the tube tip and the tracheal carina was assessed by flexible bronchoscopy with the patients in supine, and their head in neutral positions. Tube sizes were selected according to the formula: internal diameter (ID; mm) =(age/ 4) + 3. 5 in children ≥ 2 yr. In full-term newborns (≥ 3 kg) to less than 1 yr ID 3. 0 mm tubes were used and in children from 1 to less than 2 yr ID 3. 5 mm tubes were used. Endoscopic examination was performed in 50 size ID 3. 0 mm tubes, and in 25 tubes of each tube size from ID 3. 5 to 7. 0 mm. Tracheal length and percentage of the trachea to which the tube tip was advanced were calculated. Results. 250 patients were studied (105 girls, 145 boys). The distance from the tube tip to the carina ranged from 1. 4 cm in a 2 -month-old infant (ID 3. 0 mm) to 7. 7 cm in a 14 -yr-old boy (ID 7. 0 mm). Mean tube insertion into the trachea was 53. 2 % (6. 3) of tracheal length with a minimum of 40 % and a maximum of 67. 6 %. Conclusions.

40|$|Currently, {{the role}} of {{ultrasound}} (US) in anaesthesia-related airway assessment and procedural interventions is encouraging, though it is still ill defined. US can visualise anatomical structures in the supraglottic, glottic and subglottic regions. The floor of the mouth can be visualised by both transcutaneous view of the neck and also by transoral or sublinguial views. However, imaging the epiglottis can be challenging as it is suspended in air. US may detect signs suggestive of difficult intubation, but the data are limited. Other possible applications in airway management include confirmation of correct endotracheal tube placement, prediction of post-extubation stridor, evaluation of soft tissue masses in the neck prior to intubation, assessment of subglottic diameter for determination of <b>paediatric</b> endotracheal <b>tube</b> size and percutaneous dilatational tracheostomy. With development of better probes, high-resolution imaging, real-time picture and clinical experience, US has become the potential first-line noninvasive airway assessment tool in anaesthesia and intensive care practice...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVELeakage of the pancreaticojejunal {{anastomosis}} is {{a serious}} complication after pancreaticoduodenectomy. External drainage of the pancreatic remnant {{is one of several}} methods for reducing pancreaticojejunal anastomotic leakage or fistula. We investigated complications after pancreaticoduodenectomy with and without external drainage of the pancreatic remnant. METHODSPatients who underwent pancreaticoduodenectomy at King Chulalongkorn Memorial Hospital, Bangkok, Thailand from November 1991 to October 2007 were enrolled. Before 2001, no external pancreatic drainage was employed during pancreaticojejunal anastomosis (non-stented group). Since 2001, external drainage of the pancreatic remnant has been routinely performed with a <b>paediatric</b> feeding <b>tube</b> (stented group). RESULTSThere were 28 patients in the non-stented group and 45 in the stented group. Stented patients had undergone significantly more previous abdominal operations, pylorus preserving pancreaticoduodenectomy, and end to end anastomosis of the pancreatic remnant and jejunal limb. Leakage of the pancreaticojejunal anastomosis or pancreatic fistula, overall complications, and re-laparotomy rate were significantly higher in the non-stented group (leakage or fistula 21. 4 % vs. 6. 7 %, overall complications 50 % vs. 33. 3 %, and re-laparotomy 18 % vs. 2. 2 %). The only death was in the non-stented group. CONCLUSIONExternal drainage of the pancreatic remnant after pancreaticoduodenectomy is an effective method for prevention of pancreaticojejunal anastomosis leakage and other related complications...|$|R
40|$|Abstract The authors {{report the}} case of a 4 -year boy who {{required}} anaesthetic and surgical care during LASER excision of laryngeal papillomatosis. He presented with hoarseness and stridor and underwent emergency tracheostomy after confirmation of laryngeal papillomas on CT scan. He required LASER treatment under general anaesthesia with a requirement of <b>paediatric</b> LASER-safe endotracheal <b>tube</b> but unfortunately, this was not available in the country. Balanced anaesthesia technique using inhalational anaesthetic, muscle relaxant and narcotic is used with modifications. After three successful surgical sessions, the airway became patent and tracheostomy was de-cannulated. The perioperative issues surrounding this process are discussed including anaesthetic induction in the patient with a compromised airway, maintenance anaesthetic techniques, methods used for ventilation during LASER surgery of the upper airway, surgical implications and hazards of LASER to the operating room personnel...|$|R
30|$|Saline {{infusion}} sonography (SIS) is {{a simple}} technique involving the instillation of sterile saline into the uterine cavity [4, 5, 6]. A bi-valve speculum is used to visualise the cervix, then a catheter is used to instil the saline through the cervical canal into the uterine cavity. We use a 5 -F <b>paediatric</b> nasogastric feeding <b>tube.</b> A number of catheters with or without balloon catheters are commercially available. The balloon helps to reduce backflow of saline and maintain uterine distension; however, in our experience they are rarely needed. The balloon devices tend to more expensive, are not readily available and distension of the balloon at the internal cervical os can cause increased discomfort, and obscure the view in the lower aspect of the cavity. The SIS facilitates the generation of clear images of the endometrial cavity and this obviates the need for hysteroscopy {{in the majority of}} women.|$|R
40|$|Background. To {{assess the}} {{adequacy}} of the position of the tracheal tube cuff and tracheal tube tip in the recently introduced preformed oral Microcuff <b>paediatric</b> endotracheal <b>tube</b> (PET) using the manufacturers recommendations for Microcuff tracheal tube size selection. Methods. With Hospital Ethics Committee approval and informed parental consent, the tracheas of children from birth to adolescence were orally intubated with the preformed oral Microcuff PET. First, the position of the tracheal tube's intubation depth mark in relation to the vocal cords was assessed. Second, the distance ‘tracheal tube tip-to-carina' was endoscopically measured with the patient supine and the head in a neutral position and the tube placed with the centre mark at the lower incisors or alveolar ridge. Results. A total of 166 children aged from 0. 1 to 16. 4 yr (median 5. 9 yr) were studied. In five patients the intubation depth mark was above (5 mm each), in 22 patients at the level of and in the remaining 139 patients below the vocal cords. No endobronchial intubation occurred. In four patients the distance ‘tracheal tube tip-to-carina' was smaller than the safety margin to prevent endobronchial intubation during head-neck flexion. Conclusion. The new oral preformed cuffed tracheal tubes allow safe placement in almost all patients when inserted according to the tube bend. The critically low tube tip and the high cuff positions in a few tubes when placed according to the tube bend requires clinical alertnes...|$|R
40|$|Background. Aims of {{this study}} were to assess the maximum {{displacement}} of tracheal tube tip during head-neck movement in children, and to evaluate the appropriateness of the intubation depth marks on the Microcuff <b>Paediatric</b> Endotracheal <b>Tube</b> regarding the risk of inadvertent extubation and endobronchial intubation. Methods. We studied children, aged from birth to adolescence, undergoing cardiac catheterization. The patients' tracheas were orally intubated and the tracheal tubes positioned with the intubation depth mark {{at the level of the}} vocal cords. The tracheal tube tip-to-carina distances were fluoroscopically assessed with the patient supine and the head-neck in 30 ° flexion, 0 ° neutral position and 30 ° extension. Results. One hundred children aged between 0. 02 and 16. 4 yr (median 5. 1 yr) were studied. Maximum tracheal tube-tip displacement after head-neck 30 ° extension and 30 ° flexion demonstrated a linear relationship to age [maximal upward tube movement (mm) = 0 0. 71 ×age (yr) + 9. 9 (R 2 = 0. 893); maximal downward tube movement (mm) = 0. 83 ×age (yr) + 9. 3 (R 2 = 0. 949) ]. Maximal tracheal tube-tip downward displacement because of head-neck flexion was more pronounced than upward displacement because of head-neck extension. Conclusions. The intubation depth marks were appropriate to avoid inadvertent tracheal extubation and endobronchial intubation during head-neck movement in all patients. However, during head-neck extension the tracheal tube cuff may become positioned in the subglottic region and should be re-adjusted when the patient remains in this position for a longer tim...|$|R
40|$|Although the {{operative}} mortality of pancreaticoduodenal resection has decreased recently, {{the operative}} morbidity {{resulting from a}} leaking pancreatic anastomosis remains high. We described our experience in 50 consecutive cases with a simple, secure end to side pancreaticojejunostomy. We used a <b>paediatric</b> nasogastric <b>tube</b> in the pancreatic remnant duct as a temporary external pancreatic drain. There were 29 men and 21 women ranging from 12 to 84 years with a median age of 61 years. Forty-two patients underwent a standard Whipple procedure and eight a pylorus preserving pancreaticoduodenectomy. Average operating time was 270 minutes {{with a range of}} 170 to 480 minutes. The pancreaticojejunostomy could be constructed in a mean of 8 minutes. Intraoperative blood loss ranged from 150 to 3500 mL with a mean of 910 mL. Twenty-five patients (50 %) received no blood transfusion. The consistency of the pancreatic remnant was hard in 12 patients (24 %) and normal in 38 patients (76 %). The pancreatic duct was dilated (> 4 mm) in 15 patients (30 %). There was no operative mortality and only three (6. 0 %) minor leaks from the pancreatic anastomosis which healed spontaneously. It was difficult to determine if the leaks were related to the consistency of the pancreatic remnant, the size of the pancreatic duct, the amount of intraoperative blood loss, operating time, sex of the patient or experience of the surgeon, as there were only three leaks. We concluded that our technique for pancreaticojejunal anastomosis following pancreaticoduodenectomy was safe and applicable to, standard Whipple or pylorus preserving pancreaticoduodenectomy, small or dilated pancreatic ducts, normal or fibrotic pancreas...|$|R
40|$|IntroductionThe failed or {{difficult}} airway is a rare, but life-threatening situation. Alternative airway devices to direct laryngoscopy are essential aids to manage these scenarios successfully. The {{aim of this}} study was to determine which alternative airway devices are currently available in public emergency centres in the Western Cape Province, South Africa. MethodsA cross sectional study was conducted in 15 emergency centres. Data regarding the availability of different classes of alternative airway devices were documented on a standardised data collection sheet by a single investigator via direct observation. Incomplete or non-functional equipment was classified as unavailable. Summary statistics were used to describe the data. ResultsTwenty-six different types of alternative airway devices were documented. Three centres (20 %) had no alternative airway device. Five centres (33. 3 %) stocked only one device, three centres (20 %) had two devices and four centres (26. 7 %) had more than two devices. Most centres (n= 12, 80 %) stocked supraglottic airways (only one centre (6. 7 %) had <b>paediatric</b> sizes). Tracheal <b>tube</b> introducers were available in five centres (33. 3 %). Four centres (26. 7 %) had video-laryngoscopes, but none had optical laryngoscopes. Retroglottic devices and needle cricothyroidotomy equipment were available in two centres (13. 3 %). Although surgical cricothyroidotomy equipment was available, the equipment was widely dispersed and only three centres (20 %) had pre-packed sets available. None of the specialised paediatric centres had needle cricothyroidotomy equipment readily available. DiscussionThe study demonstrated that Western Cape public emergency centres are currently inadequately stocked with regard to alternative airway devices. A guideline regarding the procurement and implementation of these devices is needed...|$|R
