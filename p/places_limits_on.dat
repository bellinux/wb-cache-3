5|$|Akishio {{took part}} in the Pacific Reach 2000 drills, which took place from 2 to 14 October 2000, off of Singapore. The navies of the United States, Japan, Singapore, and South Korea took part. Because of the Kursk {{submarine}} disaster which had happened earlier that year, the Pacific Reach 2000 drills involved submarine rescue exercises, which Akishio performed in. This was the first time Japanese ships had taken part in a multilateral submarine rescue drill, although they had taken part in similar exercises bilaterally, with the US Navy. Japan's constitution <b>places</b> <b>limits</b> <b>on</b> their ability to perform collective-defence drills. Because of this, Japan joined the drills from a humanitarian standpoint, rather than a military one.|$|E

2500|$|In the 1990s, {{a leader}} of the British Socialist Workers Party, Chris Harman, {{advanced}} a reading of Marx that sees economic crisis as the main effective countervailing factor to the TRPF, but which <b>places</b> <b>limits</b> <b>on</b> its effectiveness as the capitalist system ages and units of capital become larger and more interlinked. However, David Harvey mentions that in the Grundrisse, [...] "Marx lists a variety of other factors that can stabilize the rate of profit 'other than by crises'." [...] Since the 1970s, the International Socialists have staged a theoretical struggle against underconsumptionism, regarded as a reformist ideology, and reaffirmed the TRPF as the true revolutionary theory.|$|E
2500|$|Unlike modern genetic {{analyses}}, ancient DNA {{studies are}} characterised by low-quality DNA. This <b>places</b> <b>limits</b> <b>on</b> what analyses can achieve. Furthermore, due to {{degradation of the}} DNA molecules, a process which correlates loosely with factors such as time, temperature, and presence of free water, upper limits exist beyond which no DNA is deemed likely to survive. Allentoft et al. (2012) tried to calculate this limit by studying the decay of mitochondrial and nuclear DNA in Moa bones. The DNA degrades in an exponential decay process. According to their model, mitochondrial DNA is degraded to an average length of 1 base pair after 6,830,000 years at −5°C. [...] The decay kinetics have been measured by accelerated aging experiments further displaying the strong influence of storage temperature and humidity on DNA decay. Nuclear DNA degrades {{at least twice as}} fast as mtDNA. As such, early studies that reported recovery of much older DNA, for example from Cretaceous dinosaur remains, may have stemmed from contamination of the sample.|$|E
