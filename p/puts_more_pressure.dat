5000|$|As {{the name}} suggests, this rule determines {{the number of}} hands that must land on an {{offensive}} player simultaneously to stop the play/first touch situation. One-hand touch is often used with younger players, as two-hand touch demands greater dexterity.

Stretching {{out with her}} legs on the man <b>puts</b> <b>more</b> <b>pressure</b> on the woman's mons pubis and clitoris. If the man separates his legs, the woman can put her legs between his. In this position she can increase the tightness on the man's penis by pressing her thighs together, or the man may press the woman's thighs together. This increases vaginal friction but she can still control the pace and rhythm of her thrusts. As most women approach orgasm, they experience acute vaginal contractions, which also increases the man's sexual stimulation by increasing tightness on his penis.|$|E

50|$|The golf {{treatment}} finishes up {{with two}} other guests quitting. Val places a standing speed bag in each pod and has the guests get all of their aggression out, and explain {{what it is they}} are visualizing in place of the bag. They are then told to hit the bag as many times as possible in a certain amount of time. Whoever reports the highest amount will get the biggest chicken dinner, the second highest gets the second biggest meal, and so on. One guest decides that it is better to lie instead of being honest with Val, however Val punishes them by giving the a meal bar instead. In the test, the guests are navigating a maze of rooms on their TV screens. There is only one correct path to the finish room where they will see a virtual green button meaning they need to hit the real green button. Along the maze in certain rooms are number codes, where they must use four number blocks to figure out the random code, and grump rope rooms where they must do a certain amount of under overs. They are given a compass and jelly beans to help with the test. They are then given one of their personal items to use. Val then assigns each guest an instrument to play in the Solitary 4.0 air band. In the treatment, they must sit in a tall wooden chair with arms, seat, and back covered in metal pegs. They must also put on a metal crown attached {{to the top of the}} chair that <b>puts</b> <b>more</b> <b>pressure</b> on them pushing them into the pegs more.

40|$|Most {{embedded}} systems {{are bound to}} real-time constraints. Two of the critical metrics presented in these systems are determinism and latency. Due to growing in complexity of embedded applications, real time operating systems (RTOS) are needed, not only to hide the increasingly complex hardware, but also to provide services to the system’s running tasks. Unfortunately, this new layer on an embedded system <b>puts</b> <b>more</b> <b>pressure</b> on the aforementioned metrics. One {{of the ways to}} cope with this problem is to offload RTOS run-time services to the hardware layer. This paper presents a hybrid hardware/software implementation of this technique upon the well known FreeRTOS, improving system’s latency and predictability, by migrating critical runtime services to hardware. The developed hardware accelerators were synthesized on a field-programmable gate array (FPGA), exploiting the point-to-point bus Fast Simplex Link (FSL) to interconnect to the Xilinx’s Microbaze soft-core processor.

As the demand of differentiated products increases, togetherwith {{the fact that}} old products are not phased {{out at the same}} pace, the need of usingstorage space as dynamically as possible becomes vital.

By implementing the Location Model at Scania’s engine assembly, 4, 98 % of all keptparts are recommended location changes, while resulting in cost savings, for the chosen 30 -day period.

40|$|Abstract—Conventional {{front-end}} designs {{attempt to}} maximize the number of “in-flight ” instructions in the pipeline. However, branch mispredictions cause the processor to fetch useless instructions that are eventually squashed, increasing front-end energy and issue queue utilization and, thus, wasting around 30 percent of the power dissipated by a processor. Furthermore, processor design trends lead to increasing clock frequencies by lengthening the pipeline, which <b>puts</b> <b>more</b> <b>pressure</b> on the branch prediction engine since branches take longer to be resolved. As next-generation high-performance processors become deeply pipelined, the amount of wasted energy due to misspeculated instructions will go up. The aim of this work {{is to reduce the}} energy consumption of misspeculated instructions. We propose Selective Throttling, which triggers different power-aware techniques (fetch throttling, decode throttling, or disabling the selection logic) depending on the branch prediction confidence level. Results show that combining fetch-bandwidth reduction along with select-logic disabling provides the best performance in terms of overall energy reduction and energy-delay product improvement (14 percent and 10 percent, respectively, for a processor with a 22 -stage pipeline and 16 percent and 13 percent, respectively, for a processor with a 42 -stage pipeline).
