40|$|Efficient {{management}} of RDF data {{is an important}} factor in realizing the Semantic Web vision. Performance and scalability issues are becoming increasingly pressing as Semantic Web technology is applied to real-world applications. In this paper, we examine the reasons why current data management solutions for RDF data scale poorly, and explore the fundamental scalability limitations of these approaches. We review the state of the art for improving performance for RDF databases and consider a recent suggestion, “property tables. ” We then discuss practically and empirically why this solution has undesirable features. As an improvement, we propose an alternative solution: vertically partitioning the RDF data. We compare the performance of vertical partitioning with prior art on queries generated by a Web-based RDF browser over a large-scale (more than 50 million triples) catalog of library data. Our results show that a vertical partitioned schema achieves similar performance to the property table technique while being much simpler to design. Further, if a column-oriented DBMS (a database architected specially for the vertically <b>partitioned</b> <b>case)</b> is used instead of a row-oriented DBMS, another order of magnitude performance improvement is observed, with query times dropping from minutes to several seconds. 1...|$|E

Each functional units possesses its own resources with fault containment compared to multiple functions in single processing node. Integrated architectures are structured over the avionics cabinets or processing cabinets which house the hardware modules and software application partitions along with system software. These {{integrated modular avionics}} (IMA) applications supports distributed multiprocessor architecture. Both time and memory is shared among multiple avionics functionalities across the same platform with good protection mechanisms provided by ARINC 653. ARINC 653 is an additional layer of protection being embedded as part of real time operating systems supporting the partitioning protections using well defined application executive, and application programming interfaces (API). IMA uses set of partitions, which are scheduled across a major frame M consisting set of partitions Ptn and each partition having set of task/process τn/Psn. The number of partitions and number of processes in each partition is a trade-off between the real time requirements and the resource. The paper also presents in brief, the API functionalities, its components, implementation, required interfaces, restrictions based on criticality of the avionics application.

40|$|Multi-mode {{partitioning}} {{models for}} N-way N-mode data reduce {{each of the}} N modes in the data to {{a small number of}} clusters that are mutually exclusive. Given a specific N-mode data set, one may wonder which multi-mode partitioning model (i. e., with which numbers of clusters for each mode) yields the most useful description of this data set and should therefore be selected. In this paper, we address this issue by investigating four possible model selection heuristics: multi-mode extensions of Calinski and Harabasz’s (1974) and Kaufman and Rousseeuw’s (1990) indices for one-mode k-means clustering and multi-mode partitioning versions of Timmerman and Kiers’s (2000) DIFFIT and Ceulemans and Kiers’s (2006) numerical convex hull based model selection heuristic for three-mode principal component analysis.

40|$|Cluster {{analysis}} {{is concerned with}} <b>partitioning</b> <b>cases</b> into clusters such that the cases in a cluster are similar {{in terms of a}} set of variables. The K-Means Clustering Algorithm is a popular clustering method. It finds k clusters by choosing k data points as initial cluster centroids. Each data point is then assigned to the cluster with center that is closest to that point. In K-Means, the number of clusters has to be supplied in advance, which may be difficult in practice. A new method, the X-Means Clustering Algorithm, was proposed to solve this problem, which starts with an initial partition, then recursively runs a local K-Means in each cluster to split it until a lower Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) value is reached compared with the previous larger cluster. However, this method would introduce a more severe local mode problem, that is, the previous inappropriate <b>partition</b> of <b>cases</b> cannot be corrected in the following local splitting. In this work, we develop a new algorithm that is based on Bayesian Dirichlet process mixture models, called the Non-MCMC DPM clustering algorithm. In the new clustering algorithm, we run the EM algorithm with all the cases to find a tentative partition, and then decide whether to accept the new partion with a criterion called DPC. We have tested our new clustering algorithm based on several simulated data sets, and found that it performs better than X-Means.

However, elections are often held sequentially and the chair thus knows only the previously cast votes and not the future ones, yet needs to decide instantaneously which control action to take. We introduce a framework that models online voter control in sequential elections. We show that the related problems can be much harder than in the standard (non-online) case: For certain election systems, even with efficient winner problems, online control by deleting, adding, or partitioning voters is PSPACE-complete, {{even if there are}} only two candidates. In addition, we obtain (by a new characterization of coNP in terms of weight-bounded alternating Turing machines) completeness for coNP in the deleting/adding cases with a bounded deletion/addition limit, and we obtain completeness for NP in the <b>partition</b> <b>cases</b> with an additional restriction.

First, a decentralized integral control approach that does not have any communication between the lights is developed and applied to the system. Due to its failure in achieving uniform lighting when the cross-illumination effects are maximized, a new decentralized method called the illumination balancing algorithm (IBA) is developed that takes the local light levels into account in adjusting the light voltages. The stability analysis of the IBA for the full height <b>partitions</b> <b>case</b> of the testbed is shown as well as the regulation problem results where the algorithm successfully balances the illuminations and hence achieves uniform lighting.
