50|$|A {{semipermeable}} membrane {{is a type}} of biological or synthetic, <b>polymeric</b> <b>membrane</b> that will allow certain molecules or ions to pass through it by diffusion—or occasionally by more specialized processes of facilitated diffusion, passive transport or active transport.

Depending on the membrane and the solute, permeability may depend on solute size, solubility, properties, or chemistry. How the membrane is constructed to be selective in its permeability will determine the rate and the permeability. Many natural and synthetic materials thicker than a membrane are also semipermeable.

However, some natural occurring polymers such as chitosan, gelatin, sodium alginate, and albumin are used in some drug delivering nanocapsules.

Membrane materials have expanded {{into the realm of}} silica, zeolites, metal-organic frameworks, and perovskites due to their strong thermal and chemical resistance as well as high tunability (ability to be modified and functionalized), leading to increased permeability and selectivity. Membranes can be used for separating gas mixtures where they act as a permeable barrier through which different compounds move across at different rates or not move at all.

Encapsulated cells are typically achieved through the generation of controlled-size droplets from a liquid cell suspension which are then rapidly solidified or gelated to provide added stability.

It typically goes from being on a monolayer to a suspension in a polymer scaffold within a <b>polymeric</b> <b>membrane.</b> A drawback of the technique is that encapsulating a cell decreases its viability and ability to proliferate and differentiate. Further, after some time within the microcapsule, cells form clusters that inhibit the exchange of oxygen and metabolic waste, leading to apoptosis and necrosis thus limiting {{the efficacy of the}} cells and activating the host's immune system.Artificial cells have been successful for transplanting a number of cells including islets of Langerhans for diabetes treatment, parathyroid cells and adrenal cortex cells.|$|E

5000|$|Ion-exchange {{membranes}} transport dissolved ions {{across a}} conductive <b>polymeric</b> <b>membrane.</b> [...] The membranes {{are often used}} in desalination and chemical recovery applications, moving ions from one solution to another with little passage of water. Ion-exchange membranes are made of a polymeric material attached to charged ion groups. Anion-exchange membranes contain fixed cationic groups with predominantly mobile anions; because anions are the majority species, most of the conductivity is due to anion transport. Cation-exchange membranes contain fixed anionic groups with predominantly mobile cations; because cations are the majority species, most of the conductivity is due to cation transport. The selectivity of the membranes is due to Donnan equilibrium and Donnan exclusion and not due to physically blocking or electrostatically excluding specific charged species. There are two primary classes of membranes: heterogeneous and homogeneous. Heterogeneous membranes have low cost and a thicker composition with higher resistance and a rough surface that can be subject to fouling. Homogeneous membranes are more expensive, but have a thinner composition with lower resistance and a smooth surface, less susceptible to fouling. Homogeneous membrane surfaces can be modified to alter the membrane permselectivity to protons, monovalent ions, and divalent ions.|$|E

40|$|Water {{treatment}} is, collectively, the industrial-scale {{processes that}} make water more acceptable for an end-use, {{which may be}} drinking, industry, or medicine. Due to the increasingly severe water shortage problem and growing concerns on the water quality, water treatment, which is closely relative to daily life, has always been placed under the spotlight of scientific research so far. Conventionally, water has been treated primarily using physical-chemical treatment such as sand filtration and disinfection. Not only these conventional methods required large area of operations that would require high operational cost, but may also be incapable to treat several persistence pollutants. Membrane separation is a technology which selectively separates (fractionates) materials via pores and/or minute gaps in the molecular arrangement of a continuous structure. Membrane separation has many advantages such as no chemical addition, small operation area, relatively high filtration efficiency, low cost and et al. Not only that, the stringent standard required for water supply and effluent discharge also promotes the innovative development of separation membranes and membrane separation process. Based {{on the type of}} material, membranes can be classified into <b>polymeric</b> <b>membranes</b> and inorganic membranes. Despite the fact that some <b>polymeric</b> <b>membranes</b> have already been commercialized and emerged as a favourable filter media for water treatment, there are still several limitations such as relatively low flowrate, low antifouling property and low mechanical properties. Therefore, many additives have been added into <b>polymeric</b> <b>membranes</b> to synthesize polymer-based composite membranes to tackle these problems and to further enhance the efficiency of water treatment. In this thesis, three different types of materials have been chosen as additives to incorporate into microfiltration or ultrafiltration <b>polymeric</b> <b>membranes,</b> aiming to enhance the water treatment performance. The first type of materials is germanate nanowires with different lengths. We for the first time found that the lengths of nanowires {{play a key role in}} determining the morphology change and subsequent water treatment performance; thus by controlling the length, we successfully obtains nanowire-enhanced <b>polymeric</b> <b>membranes</b> with fast permeation at the maintenance of rejection. In the second part, we developed a simple, economic and practical method to coat cheap chitosan onto the top of <b>polymeric</b> <b>membranes.</b> Though such membranes show a slight decrease of flux, the rejection, antifouling property and antibacterial property were greatly improved. Theoretical calculation shows that the weakened bonding between foulant and membrane surface resulting from chitosan-grafting is responsible for the improved antifouling property. The third type of material is alumina particles. The main purpose of this part is to study how inorganic particle size and loading affect the morphology change, performance and mechanical property of <b>polymeric</b> <b>membranes</b> with hollow shape. Results show that such inorganic particle/polymeric membranes have higher tensile and compressive properties compared to the pristine <b>polymeric</b> <b>membranes</b> and both particle size and particle loading matters in determining the improvement of mechanical properties. Despite the improvement in mechanical properties, the rejection of such membranes was greatly sacrificed due to the detachment of particles from polymer during the formation of membranes, especially when high-loading micron-sized alumina was used. Therefore, CNTs were further added into high loading micron-sized alumina/polymeric membranes to hinder such detaching effect. Results show that the incorporation of CNTs not only further enhance the permeation and mechanical properties but also the rejection and antifouling property. All in all, in this thesis, we choose three different types of materials and incorporate them into <b>polymeric</b> <b>membranes</b> to enhance the water treatment performance (flux, rejection, antifouling and mechanical properties), offering some useful and practical designing knowledge or methods to the synthesis of high-performance polymer-based membranes for water treatment processes...|$|R

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{focuses on}} the use of nanofiltration membranes as a separation tool inorganic solvents. The thesis starts from the material selection for membrane manufacturing. Nanoporouspolyphenylsulfone flat sheet and hollow fiber membranes were successfully prepared usingthe phase inversion method. The performance of <b>polymeric</b> <b>membranes</b> was studied in terms of the solvent flux and thesolute rejection. Several kinds of interactions are introduced when organic solvents are usedwith <b>polymeric</b> <b>membranes</b> and thus quantification of polymer-solvent interactions is critical. Pure solvent permeation studies were conducted to understand the mechanism of solventtransport through <b>polymeric</b> <b>membranes.</b> Different membrane materials (hydrophilic andhydrophobic) as well as different solvents (polar and non-polar) were used for the study. <b>Polymeric</b> <b>membranes</b> are prone to swelling effects, which leads to a reorganisation of themembrane structure, resulting in a new pore size distribution and a change of the degree ofhydrophilicity of the membrane surface. Hydrophobic membranes show a better solventresistance than hydrophilic membranes. The solvent flux appears to depend on three parameters: transport of momentum, sterichindrance effects and the affinity between the solvent and the membrane material. Newmodels for solvent transport were developed, which can be applied on experimental data ofboth hydrophilic and hydrophobic membranes, and for a broad range of organic solvents andsolvent mixtures. Solute transport in solvent resistant nanofiltration mainly occurs by convection. As ceramicmembranes show similar results as <b>polymeric</b> <b>membranes,</b> differences in membraneperformance cannot be attributed to swelling effects. Transport of dissolved components isalso found to be determined by three parameters: the nominal pore size, the degree ofsolvation of the solute, and the degree of pore wall solvation. A new methodology,incorporating a solvent effect for both the solute and the pore size is presented. Modelparameters, characteristic for specific membrane-solvent combinations, are determined andprovide excellent results for predictive modelling. A case-study on solvent recovery from an oleochemical industry and a pharmaceuticalproduction process via process simulation indicates that solvent resistant nanofiltration is atechnically feasible alternative for traditional separation processes.
