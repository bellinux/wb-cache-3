We show that it is possible, for any of these problems, to arbitrarily approach a competitive ratio of 1 with only a constant number of bits of <b>advice</b> <b>per</b> request. For the bin packing problem, we give an online algorithm with advice that is (1 +ε) -competitive and uses O(1 εlog 1 ε) bits of <b>advice</b> <b>per</b> request. For scheduling on m identical machines, with the objective function of any of makespan, machine covering and the minimization of the ℓ p norm, p> 1, we give similar results.

We discuss how an application flow specifies its QoS requirements, either in an IEEE 802. 11 e or IEEE 802. 16 network and the mechanisms that ensure that these requirements are known to the serving network. We identify the necessary parameters, as <b>per</b> <b>advice</b> in the standards, that could stipulate the QoS requirements for an application depending upon traffic type it represents.

40|$|As {{dehorning}} or {{removal of}} horn in cattle is rather a cruel but necessary operation, it is advisable {{to prevent the}} horns from growing in young calves rather than removing them after they have grown. However, in certain cases dehorning is required {{to be done in}} adult cattle due to fracture of the horn or horn cancer etc. In adult cattle, dehorning is best performed by a veterinary surgeon. Physical methods of dehorning include the use of embryotomy wire, guillotine shears, or dehorning knives, saws, or high tension rubber bands. The incorrect use of these instruments/tools can cause serious damage and even lead to fatalities. When cattle have large horns they are sometimes "tipped", a procedure that removes the sharp end of the horn but leaves the base. Dehorning of adult cattle is associated with increased risks of sinusitis, bleeding, prolonged wound healing and infection. Therefore, proper care must be taken to prevent these problems as <b>per</b> <b>advice</b> of a vet. To prevent maggot formation apply dressing oil containing linseed oil (100 ml), turpentine oil (10 ml) & eycalpytus oil (10 ml) twice daily Text Message: Dehornig is best done in young calf.

40|$|AbstractAimsThis {{study was}} {{undertaken}} {{to identify the}} parameters of metabolic syndrome which can predict cardiovascular and peripheral vascular disease. SubjectA total of 260 subjects were selected from Ibrahim Cardiac Hospital and Research Institute (ICHRI), who reported for coronary angiogram as <b>per</b> <b>advice</b> of a cardiologist. MethodEach subject undergoing angiogram was interviewed with a preset structured questionnaire. The study subjects were screened for PVD (peripheral vascular disease) by examining peripheral pulses and ankle brachial index measured. Subjects with absent pulse or non-recordable ankle brachial index was considered as ankle brachial index < 0. 9. Positive angiographic finding was defined by presence of mild to severe degree of coronary vascular narrowing of one or multiple of three coronary arteries. ResultAmong the study subjects 64. 6 % had metabolic syndrome, 79. 2 % had positive and 20. 8 % had normal angiographic finding. Among the CAG positive subjects 38. 8 % had single vessel disease, 30. 0 % had double vessel disease and 31. 08 % had triple vessel disease. CAG positive subjects are mostly 40 – 60 years of age, 78. 6 % male, 54. 8 % smoker, 62. 1 % had waist circumference above normal, and about 90 % have dyslipidemia and dysglycemia (DM/IGT/IFG). In this study subjects 83. 9 % of diabetic and 69. 7 % of non-diabetic had positive angiographic finding. Among the CAG positive subjects 16. 6 % had low ABI (< 0. 9). ConclusionsThis study reveals that hypertriglyceridemia, waist circumference and hypertension are significantly related with angiographic positivity. Peripheral vascular disease was not significantly higher among CAG positive subjects and no association was observed between metabolic syndrome and PVD...|$|E
