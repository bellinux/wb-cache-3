Moreover, if A is abelian, the cyclic subgroup membership problem suffices, which itself is uniform-AC^ 0 -many-one-reducible to the conjugacy <b>problem</b> <b>in</b> A B. Furthermore, under certain natural conditions, we give a uniform TC^ 0 Turing reduction from the power <b>problem</b> <b>in</b> A B to the power problems of A and B.
