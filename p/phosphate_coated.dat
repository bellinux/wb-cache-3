50|$|Osseointegration is {{a dynamic}} process in which {{characteristics}} of the implant (i.e. macrogeometry, surface properties, etc.) {{play a role in}} modulating molecular and cellular behavior. While osseointegration has been observed using different materials, it is most often used to describe the reaction of bone tissues to titanium, or titanium coated with calcium phosphate derivatives. It was previously thought that titanium implants were retained in bone through the action of mechanical stabilization or interfacial bonding. Alternatively, calcium <b>phosphate</b> <b>coated</b> implants were thought to be stabilized via chemical bonding. It is now known that both calcium <b>phosphate</b> <b>coated</b> implants and titanium implants are stabilized chemically with bone, either through direct contact between calcium and titanium atoms, or by the bonding to a cement line-like layer at the implant/bone interface. While there are some differences (e.g. like the lack of chondrogenic progenitors), osseointegration occurs through the same mechanisms as bone fracture healing.|$|E

As result, the manganese <b>phosphate</b> <b>coated</b> cams were 2, 8 times less worn up than the uncoated cams.

40|$|Phosphate is a used as {{a surface}} {{treatment}} method which is used for various purposes in the industry. In this case, <b>phosphate</b> <b>coated</b> wire {{is used in the}} processes to achieve a desirable outcome. The reason to why <b>phosphate</b> <b>coated</b> wire is used in the production process is because phosphate acts as an accumulator, where it stabilizes the lubricant {{on the surface of the}} wire. Lubrication is important because it plays a major role in the roll quality and characterizes important benefits regarding the outcome. Currently, SKF has to wash away all phosphates residues after extrusion process in an operation called tumbling. The main reason for this is simply because the surface has to be completely free from lubricants and coatings till the next step of process. Tumbling is a time consuming operation which gives rise to additional costs. The main objective of this study is to understand the importance of how the phosphate is used and what abilities it has regarding the production process. This will be helpful in the future to find other options to replace phosphates with and skip the bell tumbling operation allowing more options in production as well as cutting costs. To achieve any results a sig sigma analysis were conducted. The results it generated will be {{used as a}} basis for future improvement works to find a possible replacement technology. The results of the measurements showed that the phosphate mixture properties is that it has both oil-bearing properties that are very good, and that crystal peaks of the phosphate coating seems to have the task to be fracture mechanics lubricating the crystal peaks are broken by the pressure process and helps reduce friction during the process The result shows that phosphate affects the life span of the production tools and minimizes the damage. Enhancing the time it can be used without being broken in the process. On the contrary the process of removing any phosphate residues to ensure the quality in the later on processes, preparations has to be made.

In this study, the regenerative potential of cell sheets derived {{from different parts of}} the periodontium (gingival connective tissue, alveolar bone and periodontal ligament) were investigated in an athymic rat periodontal defect model. Periodontal ligament (PDLC), alveolar bone (ABC) and gingival margin-derived cells (GMC) were obtained from human donors. The osteogenic potential of the primary cultures was demonstrated in vitro. Cell sheets supported by a calcium <b>phosphate</b> <b>coated</b> melt electrospun polycaprolactone (CaP-PCL) scaffold were transplanted to denuded root surfaces in surgically created periodontal defects, and allowed to heal for 1 and 4 weeks. The CaP-PCL scaffold alone was able to promote alveolar bone formation within the defect after 4 weeks. The addition of ABC and PDLC sheets resulted in significant periodontal attachment formation. The GMC sheets did not promote periodontal regeneration on the root surface and inhibited bone formation within the CaP-PCL scaffold. In conclusion, the combination of either PDLC or ABC sheets with a CaP-PCL scaffold could promote periodontal regeneration, but ABC sheets were not as effective as PDLC sheets in promoting new attachment formation.
