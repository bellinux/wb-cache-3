Subjective Global Assessment (SGA) is a subjective method of nutritional status. The objective {{of this study was}} to investigate the association between BIA derived <b>phase</b> <b>angle</b> and SGA in advanced colorectal cancer. Methods We evaluated a case series of 73 stages III and IV colorectal cancer patients. Patients were classified as either well-nourished or malnourished using the SGA. BIA was conducted on all patients and <b>phase</b> <b>angle</b> was calculated. The correlation between <b>phase</b> <b>angle</b> and SGA was studied using Spearman correlation coefficient. Receiver Operating Characteristic curves were estimated using the non-parametric method to determine the optimal cut-off levels of <b>phase</b> <b>angle.</b> Results Well-nourished patients had a statistically significantly higher (p = 0. 005) median <b>phase</b> <b>angle</b> score (6. 12) as compared to those who were malnourished (5. 18). The Spearman rank correlation coefficient between <b>phase</b> <b>angle</b> and SGA was found to be 0. 33 (p = 0. 004), suggesting better nutritional status with higher <b>phase</b> <b>angle</b> scores. A <b>phase</b> <b>angle</b> cut-off of 5. 2 was 51. 7 % sensitive and 79. 5 % specific whereas a cut-off of 6. 0 was 82. 8 % sensitive and 54. 5 % specific in detecting malnutrition. Interestingly, a <b>phase</b> <b>angle</b> cut-off of 5. 9 demonstrated high diagnostic accuracy in males who had failed primary treatment for advanced colorectal cancer. Conclusion Our study suggests that bioimpedance <b>phase</b> <b>angle</b> is a potential nutritional indicator in advanced colorectal cancer.

The strength of this peak differs markedly between bodies, and can only be found by making measurements at small enough <b>phase</b> <b>angles.</b> Such measurements are usually difficult due to the necessary precise placement of the observer very close to the incident light.

METHODS: A total of 160 consecutive patients chronically infected with the hepatitis C virus and who received treatment at the hepatitis C outpatient unit of our hospital from April 2010 to May 2011 were prospectively evaluated. Bioelectrical impedance analysis, anthropometric measurements, and serum lipid profile analysis were performed. RESULTS: Twenty-five patients were excluded. A total of 135 patients with a mean age of 49. 8 &# 177; 11. 4 years were studied. Among these patients, 60 % were male. The <b>phase</b> <b>angle</b> and BMI means were 6. 5 &# 177; 0. 8 &# 176; and 26. 5 &# 177; 4. 8 kg/m 2, respectively.
