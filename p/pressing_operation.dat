40|$|Abstract. The {{influence}} of strain path during equal-channel angular pressing (ECAP) has been evaluated in pure aluminum by orientation imaging microscopy (OIM) and {{transmission electron microscopy}} (TEM). The material was examined after four <b>pressing</b> <b>operations</b> by route BC in a 90 ° die, or eight <b>pressing</b> <b>operations</b> by route BC in a 135 ° die. The von Mises equivalent strains were essentially the same for these two ECAP procedures. The microtexture data indicate that the distortion during ECAP corresponds to a simple shear in a direction approximately parallel to die-channel exit and on a plane perpendicular to the flow plane. For both procedures the OIM data reveal prominent meso-scale band-like features. Lattice orientations in each band correspond to a texture orientation but the particular combinations of orientations depend upon ECAP die angle. High-angle boundaries in the structure correspond to interfaces between the bands...|$|R
50|$|Drying is {{removing}} {{the water or}} binder from the formed material. Spray drying is widely used to prepare powder for <b>pressing</b> <b>operations.</b> Other dryers are tunnel dryers and periodic dryers. Controlled heat is applied in this two-stage process. First, heat removes water. This step needs careful control, as rapid heating causes cracks and surface defects. The dried part is smaller than the green part, and is brittle, necessitating careful handling, since a small impact will cause crumbling and breaking.|$|R

50|$|After {{the papers}} are {{impregnated}} with the resins, the three layers of paper/resin are placed into a press which simultaneously applies heat (120 °C) and pressure (5 MPa). The <b>pressing</b> <b>operation</b> allows the thermoset resins to {{flow into the}} paper, then subsequently cure into a consolidated sheet with a density greater than 1,35 g/cm³. During the press cycle, the decorative surface can also be cured while in contact with a textured surface to create one of many different surface finishes.|$|E
50|$|Often {{the edges}} of shafts and holes are {{chamfered}} (beveled). The chamfer forms a guide for the pressing movement, helping to distribute the force evenly around the circumference of the hole, to allow the compression to occur gradually instead of all at once, thus helping the <b>pressing</b> <b>operation</b> to be smoother, to be more easily controlled, and to require less power (less force at any one instant of time), and to assist in aligning the shaft parallel with the hole it is being pressed into. In the case of train Wheelsets the wheels are pressed onto the axles by force.|$|E

50|$|Microprocessors {{were added}} to cycle each press based on {{temperature}} rather than the more inaccurate cycling by time, enabling greater operator control over heat and other variables that can create inconsistencies from record to record. Operators inspect each record as it comes off the press.Other technology employed helps mitigate variations in other factors that can compromise a record’s quality, such as pressure and vibration.Uneven contact between {{the surface of the}} press die, to which is attached the stamper (the mold that creates a vinyl record), results in temperature variations. These variations introduce variations in the width and depth of individual grooves on the record. Quality Record Pressings uses a vacuum system to ensure uniform die and stamper contact. As a result, the listener’s turntable needle tracks more smoothly and provides the listener with a more faithful reproduction of the music.QRP also uses an innovative double steam valve system that reduces die temperature cycle time as well as a more finely tuned level of temperature control of the heating and cooling process. Both reduce inconsistencies from record to record in the manufacturing process.And just as ambient temperature, humidity and variations in steam and water pressure affect the quality of a vinyl record, so do the minute environmental vibrations from nearby equipment. Unwanted harmonic vibration transmitted to the die during the pressing process causes distortion of the record’s grooves and other noise as well as other unwelcome changes in the physical structure of the grooves on a record. QRP uses custom-designed press isolation pads to mitigate the effect of these vibrations.As part of its record <b>pressing</b> <b>operation,</b> QRP also operates a plating department, setting it apart from other record pressing plants that don’t have that capability. The plating department headed by Gary Salstrom is where Lacquer master discs are given metal coatings to make the metal stamper that molds the records from heated vinyl.In 2010 the acquisition of Classic Records, of Los Angeles, California, by Acoustic Sounds, was announced by Kassem and Classic Records Mike Hobson. Acoustic Sounds acquisition of Classic Records included the “Quiex SV-P” vinyl formulation/process, “Clarity Vinyl”, the unique 200-gram “flat profile” tooling and all other aspects of Classic’s proprietary vinyl pressing technology.|$|E

50|$|In some <b>pressing</b> <b>operations,</b> such as hot {{isostatic}} pressing (HIP) compact formation and sintering occur simultaneously. This procedure, together with explosion-driven compressive techniques, is used extensively {{in the production of}} high-temperature and high-strength parts such as turbine blades for jet engines. In most applications of powder metallurgy the compact is hot-pressed, heated to a temperature above which the materials cannot remain work-hardened. Hot pressing lowers the pressures required to reduce porosity and speeds welding and grain deformation processes. It also permits better dimensional control of the product, lessens sensitivity to physical characteristics of starting materials, and allows powder to be compressed to higher densities than with cold pressing, resulting in higher strength. Negative aspects of hot pressing include shorter die life, slower throughput because of powder heating, and the frequent necessity for protective atmospheres during forming and cooling stages.|$|R
