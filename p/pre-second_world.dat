5|$|Mieczysław Jagielski (12 January 192427 February 1997) was a Polish {{politician}} and economist. During {{the times of}} the People's Republic of Poland {{he was the last}} leading politician from the former eastern regions of <b>pre-Second</b> <b>World</b> War Poland.|$|E
5|$|After {{one season}} in the Third Division South and {{eighteen}} in total, Edmund Goodman stepped down as manager and returned to administrative duties, and a succession of managers attempted to plot Palace's climb back up the table. However, Palace's stay in the division was to {{last as long as}} the Third Division South itself. With only the champions gaining promotion, it was a difficult division to be promoted from, although Palace came close on more than one occasion. In the fourteen Division Three South seasons <b>pre-Second</b> <b>World</b> War, Palace finished in the top seven ten times, and never lower than fourteenth. Palace finished runners-up no less than three times, and when the 1939–40 season ended, Palace were sitting fourth. Unfortunately the season was only four matches old, cancelled with the onset of the Second World War.|$|E

25|$|Elliott was {{the nephew}} of Harry Elliott, the Derbyshire and England Test wicketkeeper and played {{alongside}} his uncle in <b>pre-Second</b> <b>World</b> War games and in 1947, when Harry reappeared in four matches {{at the age of}} 55 because of a Derbyshire injury crisis.|$|E
25|$|The West Coast of Norway {{had only}} one land airport during until 1955, Stavanger Airport, Sola. Flights along the coast and to the capital were {{therefore}} limited to seaplanes. Norwegian Air Lines resumed its <b>pre–Second</b> <b>World</b> War route from Stavanger via Haugesund Airport, Storesundsskjær to Bergen Airport, Hjellestad in 1946, using Junkers Ju 52 seaplanes. From 1948 they extended the service north from Bergen, calling at Ålesund Airport, Sørneset; Kristiansund and Trondheim Airport, Hommelvik. The airline pulled out of these routes after the 1949 summer season.|$|E
25|$|Maxwell {{was born}} into a poor Yiddish-speaking Orthodox Jewish family {{in the small town of}} Slatinské Doly (now Solotvyno, Ukraine), in the easternmost {{province}} of (<b>pre-Second</b> <b>World</b> War) Czechoslovakia. His parents were Mechel Hoch and Hannah Slomowitz. He had six siblings. In 1939, the area was reclaimed by Hungary. Most members of his family died in Auschwitz after Hungary was occupied in 1944 by its former ally, Nazi Germany, but he had already escaped to France. In Marseille he joined the Czechoslovak Army in exile in May 1940.|$|E
25|$|The {{ground was}} {{immediately}} renamed Goodison Park and proudly opened on 24 August 1892, by Lord Kinnaird and Frederick Wall of the FA. But {{instead of a}} match the 12,000 crowd saw a short athletics meeting followed by a selection of music and a fireworks display. Everton's first game there was on 2 September 1892 when they beat Bolton 4–2. It now has the capacity for just under 40,000 spectators all-seated, but the last expansion took place in 1994 when a new goal-end stand gave the stadium an all-seater capacity. The Main Stand {{dates back to the}} 1970s, while the other two stands are refurbished <b>pre-Second</b> <b>World</b> War structures.|$|E
25|$|After a poor {{season in}} 1947, Hollies {{returned}} {{to form in}} 1948, and was the one bowler who looked threatening against the Australian batsmen. He famously bowled out Bradman second ball for a duck, when the latter needed just four runs to ensure a Test match average of at least 100. In addition to his performance in the Oval Test, he took eight for 107 against a strong batting side for his county. In 1949, he played in all four Tests against New Zealand but the pitches blunted his effectiveness completely (though he was always steady) and from 1951, when English bowling recovered some of its <b>pre-Second</b> <b>World</b> War strength, he was never in the running for Test honours, despite playing {{a major role in}} Warwickshire’s County Championship success in 1951.|$|E
25|$|Crouch {{remained}} {{a part of}} the England set-up under Eriksson's successor as manager, Steve McClaren, and started McClaren's first match in charge, a friendly against Greece in August 2006. He scored twice in England's 4–0 victory. Two further goals followed in England's next match, a 5–0 win over Andorra in their opening qualifying match for UEFA Euro 2008 on 2 September 2006. Contemporary reports suggested that Crouch was the first player ever to reach ten goals for England within a single calendar year. In fact, this had happened several times <b>pre-Second</b> <b>World</b> War, most recently by Dixie Dean (12 goals in 1927) and George Camsell (11 goals in 1929). An operation needed for a nose injury he sustained playing for Liverpool prevented him from playing in England's two qualifying matches in March 2007. He returned to the England squad for their matches against Brazil and Estonia in late May and early June 2007, scoring in the qualifying match against the latter. Crouch was England's top scorer in the qualifying campaign with five goals, but this did not prevent England finishing only third in their group and failing to progress to the finals of the competition.|$|E
500|$|Before the {{construction}} of Wembley Stadium in 1923, the FA Cup Final was hosted {{by a number of}} different grounds around England including Old Trafford. The first of these was the 1911 FA Cup Final replay between Bradford City and Newcastle United, after the original tie at Crystal Palace finished as a no-score draw after extra time. Bradford won 1–0, the goal scored by Jimmy Speirs, in a match watched by 58,000 people. The ground's second FA Cup Final was the 1915 final between Sheffield United and Chelsea. Sheffield United won the match 3–0 in front of nearly 50,000spectators, most of whom were in the military, leading to the final being nicknamed [...] "the Khaki Cup Final". On 27 December 1920, Old Trafford played host to its largest <b>pre-Second</b> <b>World</b> War attendance for a United league match, as 70,504 spectators watched the Red Devils lose 3–1 to Aston Villa. The ground hosted its first international football match later that decade, when England lost 1–0 to Scotland in front of 49,429spectators on 17 April 1926. Unusually, the record attendance at Old Trafford is not for a Manchester United home game. Instead, on 25 March 1939, 76,962people watched an FA Cup semi-final between Wolverhampton Wanderers and Grimsby Town.|$|E
500|$|Jean-Marc Lofficier and Randy Lofficier {{believed}} that Land of Black Gold suffered from having been [...] "rebaked", being [...] "pulled between the 'old' pre-war Tintin {{and the more}} modern one." [...] The Lofficiers opined that the story's [...] "clear concern about war and rumours of war" [...] enable it to fit well after King Ottokar's Sceptre, at {{the point at which}} Hergé had initially developed it. They felt that this <b>pre-Second</b> <b>World</b> War atmosphere also pervaded the second, coloured version of the book, but that they had nevertheless been partly removed by the creation of the third version. Despite this, they felt that the third version of the story was [...] "better" [...] because it incorporated elements from the spy thrillers that had become increasingly popular in Western Europe during the 1950s. Despite its problems, they thought that the Thom(p)sons ingestion of Formula 14 was [...] "virtually inspired", showing that Hergé [...] "had lost none of his touch when it comes to creating unforgettable images". They opined that the character of Abdullah [...] "indisputably steals the show" [...] in Land of Black Gold, commenting on his [...] "love-hate" [...] relationship with Haddock and suggesting that he is [...] "possibly the only character to have ever succeeded in driving Tintin so batty that he loses his cool." [...] They ultimately awarded the story two stars out of five, feeling that Hergé had been unable to develop its [...] "greater potential".|$|E
2500|$|William Humble MBE (14 April 1911 – 1 March 1992) was a {{well-known}} <b>pre-Second</b> <b>World</b> War aviator, {{known as an}} air racer and for his aerobatic displays. He was also {{an officer in the}} Royal Air Force Special Reserve, and the Auxiliary Air Force. [...] Although he qualified as a mining engineer the lure of flying proved too strong, and he did not enter the family mining company. [...] During the war he became an important test pilot for aircraft manufacturer Hawker Siddeley. [...] Having tested some of the early jet aircraft, he retired from test flying in 1948, becoming a sales executive for Hawker. He was the grandfather of British television presenter, Kate Humble.|$|E
2500|$|Since three leading {{roles of}} the opera (Desdemona, Iago and Otello) are among Verdi's most demanding, both vocally and dramatically, {{some of the most}} illustrious singers of the past 130 years have made Otello part of their repertoire. Famous Otellos of the past have {{included}} Tamagno, the role's trumpet-voiced creator, as well as Giovanni Battista De Negri, Albert Alvarez, Francesc Viñas, Giuseppe Borgatti, Antonio Paoli, Giovanni Zenatello, Renato Zanelli, Giovanni Martinelli, Aureliano Pertile, Francesco Merli, Giacomo Lauri-Volpi, Frank Mullings, Leo Slezak, Jose Luccioni, Ramón Vinay, Mario Del Monaco, James McCracken, Jon Vickers, [...] David Rendall and Carlo Cossutta. <b>Pre-Second</b> <b>World</b> War Wagnerian tenors such as Jacques Urlus, Heinrich Knote, Alexander Kirchner, Lauritz Melchior and Franz Völker also undertook the part (usually singing it in German). The Russian heroic tenor Ivan Yershov was a renowned pre-World War I Otello in his native country. His compatriot Arnold Azrikan achieved his greatest recognition as a dramatic tenor in Otello. For this performance he was awarded the Stalin Prize in 1946.|$|E
