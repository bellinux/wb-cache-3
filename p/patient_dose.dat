40|$|BACKGROUND: Telaprevir (TVR) is a {{hepatitis}} C virus (HCV) NS 3. 4 A {{protease inhibitor}} that has exhibited antiviral activity {{in patients with}} HCV genotype 1 infection. The viral dynamics in <b>patients</b> <b>dosed</b> with TVR were compared with those reported for patients treated with interferon (IFN). METHODS: The dynamics of wild-type HCV genotype 1 in <b>patients</b> <b>dosed</b> with TVR monotherapy (n= 36) and TVR plus pegylated interferon (PEG-IFN) -alpha 2 a (n= 8) were quantified using a biphasic viral dynamic model. RESULTS: <b>Patients</b> <b>dosed</b> with either TVR monotherapy or TVR plus PEG-IFN-alpha 2 a had median first and second phase decreases of 12 per day and 1. 1 per day, respectively. The second phase decrease was approximately 10 -fold higher than reported values for IFN-based treatments (P < 0. 0001). <b>Patients</b> <b>dosed</b> with TVR plus PEG-IFN-alpha 2 a had a median remaining viral production after blockage (1 -epsilon) of - 2. 37 log(10). In <b>patients</b> <b>dosed</b> with TVR monotherapy, increased TVR dosage of the same schedule was related to better blockage. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggested that TVR-based regimens for chronic HCV infection will lead to an early and more rapid viral decrease that could potentially result in higher sustained viral response rates as well as offer {{the potential for a}} reduced duration of treatmen...|$|R

Many studies have been published about <b>patient</b> <b>dose,</b> but those data were classified by each organ or tissue.

In this paper, we measured absorbed dose at the depth of 0 - 200 mm with the Mix-DP phantom. The phantom is made by tissue equivalent meterial and is designed to similitude abdominal part. Percentage Depth Dose (PDD) was calculated from these doses. Three single-phase generators and three three-phases generators were used in this measurement. These measurements were analyzed by each equipment, and consequently the clear difference of PDD between the exposure equipments was not found. As the result, we can estimate <b>patient</b> <b>dose</b> at a random depth by using PDD.

40|$|Abstract–Computed {{tomography}} (CT) {{technology has}} changed considerably {{in recent years}} {{with the introduction of}} increasing numbers of multiple detector arrays. There are several parameters specific to multi-detector computed tomography (MDCT) scanners that increase or decrease <b>patient</b> <b>dose</b> systematically compared to older single detector computed tomography (SDCT) scanners. This document briefly reviews the MDCT technology, radiation dose in MDCT, including differences from SDCT and factors that affect dose, radiation risks, and the responsibilities for <b>patient</b> <b>dose</b> management. The document recommends that users need to understand the relationship between <b>patient</b> <b>dose</b> and image quality and be aware that image quality in CT is often higher than that necessary for diagnostic confidence. Automatic exposure control (AEC) does not totally free the operator from selection of scan parameters, and awareness of individual systems is important.

In the initial stage of our study, we measured the entrance surface air kerma and kerma area product for chest radiography in five major health institutions in the country. A total of 214 patients were observed. We reported the mean value, minimum and third quartile values, as well as maximum values of surface air kerma and kerma area product of <b>patient</b> <b>doses.</b> In the second stage, the possibilities for dose reduction were investigated.

The max/min ratio for the entrance surface air kerma was found to be 53 for the posterior-anterior projection and 88 for the lateral projection. Comparing the results obtained in Montenegro with results from other countries, we concluded that <b>patient</b> <b>doses</b> in our medical centres are significantly higher.

Some positive expiratory pressure (PEP) devices allow concomitant administration of aerosol. I hypothesized that this practice alters the aerosol charac-teristics and <b>patient</b> <b>dose.</b> I compared the aerosol characteristics and <b>patient</b> <b>dose</b> of nebulized albuterol from 2 types of nebulizer, alone and when connected to different PEP and vibratory PEP devices. METHODS: Three units of a continuous-output nebulizer (Up-Draft II Opti-Neb) and 3 units of a breath-enhanced nebulizer (LC Plus) were tested alone and connected to PEP devices (Acapella Choice, Acapella Duet, and EzPAP for Up-Draft II Opti-Neb, and Pari PEP at 2 different settings, and Pari PEP S system with the LC Plus). Aerosol characteristics were evaluated with a cooled cascade impaction technique. The nebulizers were loaded with 2. 5 mg/ 3 mL albuterol solu-tion and operated for 4 min at 6 L/min (wall air). <b>Patient</b> <b>dose</b> was evaluated with simulated breathing patterns for a child, small adult, and large adult. Albuterol was assayed via spectropho-tometry. RESULTS: Connecting the LC Plus to the PEP devices did not change the aerosol char-acteristics or <b>patient</b> <b>dose.</b> Connecting the Up-Draft II Opti-Neb to the PEP devices significantly reduced the mass median aerodynamic diameter, from 4. 13 m to 3. 72 m with EzPAP (P. 02), 1. 24 m with Acapella Choice (P <. 001), and 1. 22 m with Acapella Duet (P <. 001). The total amount of albuterol captured by the impactor decreased when connected to either Acapella Choice (65 %) or Acapella Duet (69 %), with 17 – 25 % retained in the PEP devices. <b>Patient</b> <b>dose</b> decreased by 76 % and 84 % when connected to Acapella Choice and Acapella Duet, respectively.

The aim {{of this study was to}} evaluate radiation <b>doses</b> in adult <b>patient</b> who underwent routine CT brain examinations, and to assess how CT scanning protocols affect <b>patient</b> <b>doses</b> in practice. Material/Methods: A total of 118 patients underwent brain CT at two radiology departments equipped with 64 -slice CT scanners, Khartoum, Sudan. <b>Patient</b> <b>doses</b> regarding weighted CT dose index (CTDIw) and dose length product (DLP) values were recorded.
