40|$|Abstract Background In humans, {{there are}} four <b>alkaline</b> <b>phosphatases,</b> and each form exibits a {{characteristic}} pattern of tissue distribution. The availability of an easy method to reveal their activity has resulted in large amount of data reporting correlations between variations in activity and illnesses. For example, <b>alkaline</b> <b>phosphatase</b> from neutrophils of mothers pregnent with a trisomy 21 fetus (Down's syndrome) displays significant differences both in its biochemical and immunological properties, and in its affinity for some specific inhibitors. Results To analyse these differences, the biochemical characteristics of two isozymes (non specific and <b>placental</b> <b>alkaline</b> <b>phosphatases)</b> were expressed in baculovirus infected cells. Comparative analysis of the two proteins allowed us to estimate the kinetic constants of denaturation and sensitivity to two inhibitors (L-p-bromotetramisole and thiophosphate), allowing better discrimination between the two enzymes. These parameters were then used to estimate {{the ratio of the}} two isoenzymes in neutrophils of pregnant mothers with or without a trisomy 21 fetus. It appeared that the placental isozyme represented 13 % of the total activity of neutrophils of non pregnant women. This proportion did not significantly increase with normal pregnancy. By contrast, in pregnancies with trisomy 21 fetus, the proportion reached 60 – 80 % of activity. Conclusion Over-expression of the placental isozyme compared with the tissue-nonspecific form in neutrophils of mother with a trisomy 21 fetus may explain why the characteristics of the <b>alkaline</b> <b>phosphatase</b> in these cells is different from normal. Application of this knowledge could improve the potential of using <b>alkaline</b> <b>phosphatase</b> measurements to screen for Down's syndrome. </p...|$|R
40|$|International audienceChronic {{kidney disease}} (CKD) is {{associated}} with numerous metabolic and endocrine disturbances, including abnormalities of calcium and phosphate metabolism and an inflammatory syndrome. The latter occurs early {{in the course of}} CKD and contributes to the development and progression of vascular calcification. A few therapeutic strategies are today contemplated to target vascular calcification in patients with CKD: vitamin K 2, calcimimetics and phosphate binders. However, none has provided complete prevention of vascular calcification and there is an urgent need for alternate efficient treatments. Recent findings indicate that tissue-nonspecific <b>alkaline</b> <b>phosphatase</b> (TNAP) may represent a very promising drug target due to its participation in mineralization by vascular smooth muscle cells. We report the synthesis of four levamisole derivatives having better inhibition property on TNAP than levamisole. Their IC 50, Ki and water solubility have been determined. We found that the four inhibitors bind to TNAP in an uncompetitive manner and are selective to TNAP. Indeed, they do not inhibit intestinal and <b>placental</b> <b>alkaline</b> <b>phosphatases.</b> Survival MTT tests on human MG- 63 and Saos- 2 osteoblast-like cells have been performed in the presence of inhibitors.

40|$|Summary: The {{kinetics}} {{and efficiency}} {{of the interaction between}} <b>placental</b> <b>alkaline</b> <b>phosphatase</b> and a monoclonal antibody (laboratory number 327) were determined by immunoassay using microtitre plates or magnetic beads.

Crossreactivity of the stem cell <b>alkaline</b> <b>phosphatase</b> with antisera reacting with placental, kidney, liver, and brain <b>alkaline</b> <b>phosphatases</b> indicated that the stem cell enzyme had common antigenic determinants. Structural studies utilizing two-dimensional electrophoresis of the 32 P-labeled <b>alkaline</b> <b>phosphatase</b> subunits showed that the stem cell, <b>placental,</b> and kidney <b>alkaline</b> <b>phosphatases</b> differed only in their sialic acid content and comigrated after removal of terminal sialic acid by neuraminidase digestion.

The purified enzyme exhibited optimal activity over the pH range of 8. 9 – 10. 6. The apparent Km of the enzyme for p-nitrophenyl phosphate was 0. 15 mM.

Virus production, measured by HIV- 1 antigen release into the supernatant, and HIV- 1 DNA, identified by polymerase chain reaction, were detected for at least 12 days postinfection. Western immunoblot analysis showed Gag proteins, precursor p 55, and cleavage products p 24 and p 17 in HIV- 1 -infected tissues. Double labeling of placental villi with antibodies to CD 4 and <b>placental</b> trophoblast-specific <b>alkaline</b> <b>phosphatase</b> indicated that trophoblasts express CD 4 antigen.

When a recombinant Autographa californica nucleopolyhedrovirus (AcMNPV) was used to produce SEAP in Trichoplusia ni (Tn- 4 h) cells cultured in serum-free medium, structural analyses indicated < 1 % hybrid and no complex oligosaccharides attached to SEAP, a typical result with the baculovirus expression vector system. However, when fetal bovine serum {{was added to the}} culture medium, 48 (4 % of the oligosaccharides were hybrid or complex (but asialylated) glycans. When a recombinant T. ni nucleopolyhedrovirus (TnSNPV) was similarly used to express SEAP in Tn- 4 h cells cultured in serum-containing medium, only 24 (3 % of the glycans contained terminal N-acetylglucosamine and/or galactose residues.

The specific activities of <b>alkaline</b> <b>phosphatases</b> in first-trimester and term placental tissue remain constant throughout {{the time course of}} incubation. In the media, specific activities increase with time. Hence, <b>alkaline</b> <b>phosphatase</b> synthesis seems to be the driving force for its own secretion. The rates of synthesis de novo and of <b>alkaline</b> <b>phosphatases</b> were measured. The specific radioactivities of the secreted <b>alkaline</b> <b>phosphatases</b> were higher than the corresponding specific radioactivities in the tissue throughout the entire incubation period. The intracellular distribution of the <b>alkaline</b> <b>phosphatase</b> isoenzymes was compared...|$|R
