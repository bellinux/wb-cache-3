5|$|A {{geothermal}} heat <b>pump</b> <b>can</b> extract enough heat from shallow ground {{anywhere in the}} world to provide home heating, but industrial applications need the higher temperatures of deep resources. The thermal efficiency and profitability of electricity generation is particularly sensitive to temperature. The most demanding applications receive the greatest benefit from a high natural heat flux, ideally from using a hot spring. The next best option is to drill a well into a hot aquifer. If no adequate aquifer is available, an artificial one may be built by injecting water to hydraulically fracture the bedrock. This last approach is called hot dry rock geothermal energy in Europe, or enhanced geothermal systems in North America. Much greater potential may be available from this approach than from conventional tapping of natural aquifers.|$|E
5|$|The HPOTP turbine and HPOTP {{pumps are}} {{mounted on a}} common shaft. Mixing of the fuel-rich hot gases in the turbine section and the liquid oxygen in the main <b>pump</b> <b>can</b> create a hazard and, to prevent this, the two {{sections}} are separated by a cavity that is continuously purged by the engine's helium supply during engine operation. Two seals minimize leakage into the cavity; one seal is located between the turbine section and the cavity, while the other is between the pump section and cavity. Loss of helium pressure in this cavity results in automatic engine shutdown.|$|E
25|$|Booster pumps, {{such as the}} Haskel <b>pump,</b> <b>can</b> be used to {{scavenge}} the remnants of expensive gases in nearly empty cylinders allowing low-pressure gases to be pumped safely into cylinders already containing gas at higher pressure.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Pumps</b> <b>can</b> be broadly {{categorized}} {{according to}} three techniques: ...|$|R
50|$|Piston <b>pumps</b> <b>can</b> {{be used to}} move liquids or {{compress}} gases.|$|R
50|$|Crystal {{structures}} of Sarcoplasimc/endoplasmic reticulum ATP driven calcium <b>pumps</b> <b>can</b> {{be found in}} RCSB.|$|R
25|$|To provide heat more efficiently, an {{electrically}} driven heat <b>pump</b> <b>can</b> {{raise the}} indoor temperature by extracting {{energy from the}} ground, the outside air, or waste streams such as exhaust air. This can cut the electricity consumption to as little as 35% of that used by resistive heating.|$|E
25|$|Canister filters were {{initially}} designed to filter drinking water, under low pressure. Canister filters for aquariums use high water pressure, from a properly powered pump, to force water through the dense filter media. A <b>pump</b> <b>can</b> draw water from an under-gravel filter, {{and run it}} into a canister for double filtration.|$|E
25|$|Japan still {{struggles to}} keep {{water on the}} {{reactors}} to cool them and prevent further meltdown. Russian Antonov An-124 cargo planes fly out of Atlanta and Los Angeles, each carrying a huge concrete boom pump. The two 95-ton boom pumps, which TEPCO purchased for $2million each, can be operated from two miles away by remote control. Each boom <b>pump</b> <b>can</b> direct focused streams of water into the damaged reactors.|$|E
5000|$|Insulin <b>pumps</b> <b>can</b> {{provide an}} {{accurate}} record of insulin usage through their history menus. On many insulin <b>pumps,</b> this history <b>can</b> be uploaded {{to a computer}} and graphed for trend analysis.|$|R
50|$|There are {{two basic}} classes of pumps. Large volume <b>pumps</b> <b>can</b> <b>pump</b> {{nutrient}} solutions large enough to feed a patient. Small-volume pumps infuse hormones, such as insulin, or other medicines, such as opiates.|$|R
50|$|Dynamic <b>pumps</b> <b>can</b> {{be further}} {{subdivided}} {{according to the}} means in which the velocity gain is achieved.|$|R
25|$|Heat energy {{naturally}} transfers from warmer {{places to}} colder spaces. However, a heat <b>pump</b> <b>can</b> reverse this process, by absorbing heat from a cold space and releasing it to a warmer one. Heat is not conserved {{in this process}} and requires some amount of external energy, such as electricity. In heating, ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC) systems, the term heat pump usually refers to vapor-compression refrigeration devices optimized for high efficiency in both directions of thermal energy transfer. These heat pumps can be reversible, and work in either direction to provide heating or cooling to the internal space.|$|E
25|$|The Minimed Paradigm series' RF link also {{supports}} a continuous blood glucose sensor {{known as the}} Paradigm REAL-Time Continuous Glucose Monitor that wirelessly provides an interstitial glucose value every 5 minutes on the pump screen. The Medtronic REAL-Time System {{was the first to}} link a continuous monitor with an insulin pump system. In the Minimed 530G with Enlite (in the US) or Paradigm Veo (in other countries), the <b>pump</b> <b>can</b> enter a low glucose suspend mode stopping all insulin delivery (bolus and basal insulin) if interstitial glucose values fall below the hypoglycemia threshold. In the Minimed 640G insulin pump series, low glucose suspend mode can also be entered based on predicted hypoglycemia.|$|E
2500|$|... {{and with}} {{adaptive}} filtering techniques, the <b>pump</b> <b>can</b> [...] "learn" [...] the unique basal {{rates for the}} person {{as a function of}} the time of day.|$|E
50|$|Newer {{and lower}} power {{technology}} including reverse inverter DC heat <b>pumps</b> <b>can</b> achieve SEER ratings up to 26.|$|R
50|$|Recent {{work has}} {{suggested}} that free radicals escaping from ion <b>pumps</b> <b>can</b> influence the results of some experiments.|$|R
40|$|Bamboo treadle {{pumps are}} usually {{made of steel}} and have two barrels. The pumping {{mechanism}} is constructed of bamboo and the pump is operated by alternately depressing the bamboo pedals with ones feet. Bamboo treadle <b>pumps</b> <b>can</b> <b>pump</b> water from depths of up to 7 - 8 metres. They <b>can</b> <b>pump</b> from boreholes and open bodies of water but they cannot produce a pressurised flow and so cannot individually be used to raise water higher than {{the body of the}} <b>pump.</b> This <b>can</b> be achieved by locating pumps in vertical series. Bamboo treadle <b>pumps</b> <b>can</b> be produced by anyone with standard metalworking skills and simple metalworking tools such as welding equipment and a barrel roller. A bamboo treadle pump is a lightweight, portable means of pumping water from shallow depth...|$|R
2500|$|The {{first step}} in {{controlling}} an insulin pump based on continuous blood glucose data is to automatically control the basal rate of the insulin pump. [...] When a bolus has not recently been performed, the <b>pump</b> <b>can</b> manage the blood glucose level by adjusting the basal rate as needed: ...|$|E
2500|$|... custom alarms: The <b>pump</b> <b>can</b> monitor for {{activities}} during specific {{times of day}} and alarm the user if an expected activity did not occur. [...] Examples include a missed lunch bolus, a missed blood glucose test, a new blood glucose test 15 minutes after a low blood glucose test, etc. [...] The alarms are customized for each user.|$|E
2500|$|The {{decision}} {{to put the}} RCPs {{on the inside of}} the vessel was a fairly radical innovation. [...] With the existence of eight separate RCPs as opposed to the 2 or 4 of a typical PWR, when one pump goes out, that <b>pump</b> <b>can</b> be shut down and isolated, not be worked on until the next outage.|$|E
50|$|Ionic liquids in liquid-ring vacuum <b>pumps</b> <b>can</b> {{lower the}} vacuum {{pressure}} from about 70 mbar to below 1 mbar.|$|R
5000|$|The ion <b>pumps</b> <b>can</b> {{no longer}} {{transport}} calcium {{out of the}} cell, and intracellular calcium levels get too high.|$|R
50|$|Hydraulic <b>pumps</b> <b>can</b> {{also be used}} {{to start}} some engines through gears. The pumps are {{electrically}} controlled on the ground.|$|R
2500|$|For {{more serious}} cases of AMS, or where rapid descent is impractical, a Gamow bag, a {{portable}} plastic hyperbaric chamber inflated {{with a foot}} <b>pump,</b> <b>can</b> be used to reduce the effective altitude {{by as much as}} [...] A Gamow bag is generally used only as an aid to evacuate severe AMS patients, not to treat them at altitude.|$|E
2500|$|... touch bolus: For {{persons with}} visual impairments, this {{button on the}} <b>pump</b> <b>can</b> be used to bolus for insulin without using the display. [...] This works with a system of beeps to confirm the bolus {{parameters}} to the pump user. [...] This feature is described as 'touch', 'audio', or 'easy' bolus depending on brand. [...] The feature was first introduced in the mid- to late 1990s.|$|E
2500|$|MiniMed Paradigm is {{a series}} of insulin pumps {{manufactured}} by Medtronic for patients with diabetes mellitus. [...] The pump operates with a single AAA battery and uses a piston-plunger pump to infuse a programmed amount of insulin into the patient through a length of tubing. [...] The Paradigm uses a one-way wireless radio frequency link to receive blood sugar measurements from select glucose meters. [...] The Paradigm RT (Real Time) series adds the ability to receive data from a mated continuous blood-glucose monitor. [...] Although the <b>pump</b> <b>can</b> use these measurements to assist in calculating a dose of insulin, no actual change in insulin delivery occurs without manual user-intervention.|$|E
25|$|When a reactor is not {{producing}} electricity, its cooling <b>pumps</b> <b>can</b> be {{powered by}} other reactor units, the grid, diesel generators, or batteries.|$|R
5000|$|The large {{external}} reservoir and <b>pumps</b> <b>can</b> {{be tricky}} to position around {{the engine and}} within the engine bay due to their size.|$|R
50|$|Piston <b>pumps</b> <b>can</b> be made variable-displacement by {{inserting}} springs inline with the pistons. The displacement is not positively controlled, but decreases as back-pressure increases.|$|R
2500|$|An insulin pump {{to infuse}} a rapid-acting insulin {{is the first}} step in {{simulating}} the function of the pancreas. [...] The <b>pump</b> <b>can</b> accurately deliver small increments of insulin compared to an injection, and its electronic controls permit shaping a bolus over time to match the insulin profile required for a given situation. [...] The insulin pump is controlled by the pump user to bolus manually based on a recent blood glucose measurement and an estimate of the grams of carbohydrate consumed. [...] This predictive approach is said to be open-loop. [...] Once a bolus has been calculated and delivered, the pump continues to deliver its basal rate insulin in the manner that has been programmed into the pump controls based on the predicted insulin requirements of its user.|$|E
2500|$|The {{control unit}} {{comprises}} two controllers, {{one for the}} air heat cycle {{and one for the}} geothermal circulation, in one device. [...] All components communicate over a common bus to ensure they interact to enhance the efficiency of the hybrid heating system. [...] The German Patent and Trade Mark Office in Munich granted the air/water-brine/water heat pump a patent in 2008, under the title “Heat pump and method for controlling the source inlet temperature to the heat pump”. This hybrid heat <b>pump</b> <b>can</b> be combined with a solar thermal system or with an ice-storage. [...] It trades and is marketed under the name ThermSelect. [...] In the United Kingdom, ThermSelect won the 2013 Commercial Heating Product of the Year award of the HVR Awards for Excellence, organised by Heating and Ventilating Review, an industry magazine.|$|E
2500|$|Loosely, {{a flight}} of locks is simply a series of locks in close-enough {{proximity}} {{to be identified as}} a single group. For many reasons, {{a flight of}} locks is preferable to the same number of locks spread more widely: crews are put ashore and picked up once, rather than multiple times; transition involves a concentrated burst of effort, rather than a continually interrupted journey; a lock keeper may be stationed to help crews through the flight quickly; and where water is in short supply, a single <b>pump</b> <b>can</b> recycle water {{to the top of the}} whole flight. The need for a flight may be determined purely by the lie of the land, but it is possible to group locks purposely into flights by using cuttings or embankments to [...] "postpone" [...] the height change. Examples: Caen Hill locks, Devizes.|$|E
5000|$|Charge <b>pumps</b> <b>can</b> {{also be used}} as LCD or white-LED drivers, {{generating}} high {{bias voltages}} from a single low-voltage supply, such as a battery.|$|R
50|$|Most heat <b>pumps</b> <b>can</b> also {{operate in}} a cooling mode where the cold {{refrigerant}} is moved through the indoor coils to cool the room air.|$|R
50|$|Usually, {{piston pumps}} are used, {{because they can}} produce {{hundreds}} of atmospheres of pressure. Such piston-style <b>pumps</b> <b>can</b> push cylinders of heterogenous concrete mixes (aggregate + cement).|$|R
