5|$|A {{flexible-fuel vehicle}} (FFV) or dual-fuel vehicle (colloquially called a flex-fuel vehicle) is an {{alternative}} fuel vehicle with an internal combustion engine designed to run {{on more than one}} fuel, usually gasoline blended with either ethanol or methanol fuel, and both fuels are stored in the same common tank. Modern flex-fuel engines are capable of burning any proportion of the resulting blend in the combustion chamber as fuel injection and spark timing are adjusted automatically according to the actual blend detected by a fuel composition sensor. Flex-fuel vehicles are distinguished from bi-fuel vehicles, where two fuels are stored in separate tanks and the engine runs on one fuel at a time, for example, compressed natural gas (CNG), liquefied <b>petroleum</b> <b>gas</b> (LPG), or hydrogen.|$|E

5|$|As of October 2011, {{consumption}} of liquefied <b>petroleum</b> <b>gas,</b> gasoline, kerosene, and diesel has cut between 4 and 19%, {{despite the fact}} that more than 1 million cars have been added to Iran's fleet. Increased use of compressed natural gas (CNG) to fuel cars has also reportedly played a role in this. According to the government, if oil products consumption had not been managed, {{consumption of}} gasoline would have increased to 120 million liters per day, while by reforming consumption pattern the figure has fallen to 60 million liters per day. In November 2011, the Government reported that the subsidy reform plan has saved Iran $6 billion.|$|E

Evidence included complaints filed by victims' family members which state that police officials fired bullets and helped the mob, resulting in the killings. It was also alleged that police guided the mob of rioters to residents' hiding places. According to Human Rights Watch, the police did nothing as houses and people were burnt and, {{on the day of the}} violence, did not respond to telephone calls until the massacre ended. Numerous eyewitnesses saw police aiming tear gas shells at, and firing upon, Muslim youths who tried to defend themselves or others. There also have been allegations that police themselves burnt houses and looted. In the violence, the extensive use of liquefied <b>petroleum</b> <b>gas</b> (LPG) was reported, which was cited as evidence of the involvement of officials because of easy access to it.|$|E

5|$|Modern {{ambulances}} {{are typically}} powered by internal combustion engines, {{which can be}} powered by any conventional fuel, including diesel, gasoline or liquefied <b>petroleum</b> <b>gas,</b> depending on the preference of the operator {{and the availability of}} different options. Colder regions often use gasoline-powered engines, as diesels can be difficult to start when they are cold. Warmer regions may favor diesel engines, as they are thought to be more efficient and more durable. Diesel power is sometimes chosen due to safety concerns, after a series of fires involving gasoline-powered ambulances during the 1980s. These fires were ultimately attributed in part to gasoline's higher volatility in comparison to diesel fuel. The type of engine may be determined by the manufacturer: in the past two decades, Ford would only sell vehicles for ambulance conversion if they are diesel-powered. Beginning in 2010, Ford will sell its ambulance chassis with a gasoline engine in order to meet emissions requirements.|$|E
5|$|All pipes {{water supply}} in the state was managed by the Sabah State Water Department, an agency {{under the control of}} Sabah Ministry of Infrastructure Development. Operating with 73 water {{treatments}} plants, an average of 1.19billion litres of water are distributed daily to meet Sabahan residents demands. The coverage of water supply in major towns has reach 100% while in rural areas, the coverage still around 75% with total public pipes length up to 15,031 kilometres. The only water supply dam in the state is the Babagon Dam which holds 21,000 million litres of water. To meet the increase demands, another dam named as Kaiduan Dam was being proposed to be built although being met with protest from local villagers who living on the proposed site. Sabah has a natural gas demand of 350 mmscfd in 2013, which increase to 523 mmscfd in 2015. As Malaysia's liquefied <b>petroleum</b> <b>gas</b> (LPG) are much cheaper through the subsidy that was given by the federal government, it was found out in 2015 that around 20,000 LPG cylinders in Sabah east coast were smuggled by immigrants from neighbouring Indonesia and the southern Philippines in a monthly basis to their countries that leading to many Sabahans hard to retrieve enough supplies of LPG. As a counter-measure, the Malaysian Ministry of Domestic Trade, Co-operatives and Consumerism (MDTCAC) has temporarily cancelled all permits to sell gas cylinders into neighbouring countries with a new policy will be implemented to control such illegal activities.|$|E
