500|$|Later {{in the day}} he relaxes in a glade of tall {{pines and}} falls asleep. When he wakes, he hikes the last mile {{to the edge of}} the river where he sees the trout feeding in the evening light [...] "making circles all down the surface of the water as though it were {{starting}} to rain." [...] He pitches his tent, unpacks his supplies, cooks his dinner, fills his water bucket, heats a <b>pot</b> <b>of</b> <b>coffee,</b> and kills a mosquito before falling asleep.|$|E
2500|$|Another {{scene that}} was in {{an earlier version of}} the script had young George visiting his father at his work. After George tells off Mr. Potter and closes the door, he {{considers}} asking Uncle Billy about his drugstore dilemma. Billy is talking on the phone to the bank examiner, and lights his cigar and throws his match in the wastebasket. This scene explains that Tilly (short for Matilda) and Eustace are both his cousins (not Billy's kids though), and Tilly is on the phone with her friend Martha and says, [...] "Potter's here, the bank examiner's coming. It's a day of judgment." [...] As George is about to interrupt Tilly on the phone, Billy cries for help and Tilly runs in and puts the fire out with a <b>pot</b> <b>of</b> <b>coffee.</b> George decides he is probably better off dealing with the situation by himself.|$|E
2500|$|After {{the series}} Medical Center ended, Everett became {{frustrated}} when no movie roles were forthcoming and television roles were not working out. A long-time social drinker, he began drinking heavily. He was consuming {{a quart of}} vodka a day {{by the time he}} quit drinking in 1986. [...] "I was a functional alcoholic." [...] Shelby noted his alcohol-related mood swings and has said, [...] "finally I confronted him. I came into the bedroom with a big <b>pot</b> <b>of</b> <b>coffee</b> one morning and said 'we have a major problem to deal with here.'" [...] A month later, Everett caught sight of himself on a video and did not like what he saw. [...] " [...] 'Finally,' I said, 'I am really in trouble'. I stepped outside and I looked up and said, 'Father, you take it. I can't handle it anymore.'" [...] The next day, he told his daughters (who were living at home at the time), [...] "I am addicted to alcohol, and I am not going away to detox. I am going to do it here so that you can see what happens to someone if you let a substance take control of you." [...] He attended his first Alcoholics Anonymous meeting the next day and claimed he never drank again, attributing his discipline to his Christian faith and his self-pride.|$|E
60|$|At {{the same}} moment that this {{conversation}} was taking place, Lawrence Armstrong and Pedro--alias Conrad of the Mountains--were holding equally interesting and perhaps more earnest converse over two <b>pots</b> <b>of</b> <b>coffee</b> in a restaurant.|$|R
50|$|The London Coffee House was {{situated}} at the once busy corner of Front street and High Streets hard on the city's docks. Lots of lots of real estate were offered over <b>pots</b> and <b>pots</b> <b>of</b> <b>coffee.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, but as I warned you, {{nothing about}} the effect of out-o'-doors on the appetite. All you've got to do is to watch a city broker eat {{fourteen}} pounds <b>of</b> steak, three <b>pots</b> <b>of</b> <b>coffee,</b> and four black cigars at a Broadway restaurant to realize that the effeminate city man occasionally gets up quite some appetite, too!" ...|$|R
60|$|The pan {{was over}} the fire getting hot. Blumpo cleaned the fish and put them on. In the meantime, Jerry made a <b>pot</b> <b>of</b> <b>coffee.</b>|$|E
60|$|My {{friend and}} his wife were {{finishing}} a poor meal--rags of old mutton, the remainder cakes from breakfast eaten cold, and a starveling <b>pot</b> <b>of</b> <b>coffee.</b>|$|E
6000|$|Dominique came {{round to}} them, bearing {{appearance}} {{of one who}} has seen better days, and a <b>pot</b> <b>of</b> <b>coffee</b> brewed on a spirit lamp. Breakfast--he said--was served! ...|$|E
60|$|The {{girl had}} just {{got away with}} the ruin when Lili and her hireling behind her came bearing down upon them with their three {{substantial}} breakfasts on two well-laden trays. She forestalled Burnamy's reproaches for her delay, laughing and bridling, while she set down the dishes of ham and tongue and egg, and the little <b>pots</b> <b>of</b> <b>coffee</b> and frothed milk.|$|R
50|$|The king {{ordered the}} {{experiment}} {{to be conducted}} using two identical twins. Both of the twins had been tried for the crimes they had committed and condemned to death. Their sentences were commuted to life imprisonment {{on the condition that}} one of the twins drank three <b>pots</b> <b>of</b> <b>coffee,</b> and the other drank the same amount of tea, every day {{for the rest of their}} lives.|$|R
6000|$|... "Exactly. My {{body has}} {{remained}} in this arm-chair and has, I regret to observe, consumed in my absence two large <b>pots</b> <b>of</b> <b>coffee</b> and {{an incredible amount}} of tobacco. After you left I sent down to Stamford's for the Ordnance map of this portion of the moor, and my spirit has hovered over it all day. I flatter myself that I could find my way about." ...|$|R
60|$|Henry, {{squatting}} {{over the}} fire and settling the <b>pot</b> <b>of</b> <b>coffee</b> {{with a piece of}} ice, nodded. Nor did he speak till he had taken his seat on the coffin and begun to eat.|$|E
60|$|Of the lads, it was Randy who was {{the first}} to arise in the morning. He found Uncle Barney in the act of {{stirring}} up the fire. The old lumberman had already brought in some ice to be melted for a <b>pot</b> <b>of</b> <b>coffee.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... "Not if {{the court}} knows itself do I let a lady stake my horse for me," [...] said he. [...] "But if you'll run in, /chica/, and throw a <b>pot</b> <b>of</b> <b>coffee</b> {{together}} while I attend to the /caballo/, I'll be a good deal obliged." ...|$|E
40|$|Photograph <b>of</b> men serving <b>coffee</b> to {{refugees}} <b>of</b> the San Francisco {{earthquake and}} fire, April 18, 1906. A group of several men is at center, handling coffee in large steaming vats with ladles. Many people are standing around {{the men in}} the middle, separated from them by crude wooden barriers made from barrels. Inside, near the <b>pots</b> <b>of</b> <b>coffee,</b> several large sacks can be seen. The walls of several buildings {{can be seen in the}} background, and the cobblestone street is visible in the foreground...|$|R
6000|$|Lee {{returned}} soon with a <b>pot</b> <b>of</b> fresh <b>coffee</b> {{and some}} sandwiches, {{the sight of}} which roused young Gregg to impudent remark. [...] "Well, notice that! And we're left out!" [...] But Edwards shrank into the shadow, as if the light hurt him.|$|R
60|$|Wood was {{piled on}} the fire, and soon a <b>pot</b> <b>of</b> {{steaming}} <b>coffee</b> made all feel better. When {{the man in}} charge went out to look at the sheep in the various folds Dave went with him. The air was filled with snow, and it was very dark.|$|R
6000|$|... "Breakfast," [...] said Rupert, firmly. [...] "If {{you don't}} {{know what it}} is, I can teach you in half a minute. You play it with a <b>pot</b> <b>of</b> <b>coffee,</b> a knife and fork, and about a hundred-weight of {{scrambled}} eggs. Try it. It's a pastime that grows on you." ...|$|E
60|$|The boys {{told the}} story of the trouble up the stream, and then related how they had shot the cougar, and {{exhibited}} the body of the slain beast. In the meantime they broiled some more fish, and made an extra <b>pot</b> <b>of</b> <b>coffee</b> and some flapjacks for the newcomer.|$|E
60|$|It was {{now seen}} that both sailors were almost exhausted, and Captain Blossom {{allowed them to}} rest, while Dick {{prepared}} a <b>pot</b> <b>of</b> <b>coffee.</b> While they were drinking, Gibson told them the particulars of how the mate had made himself leader of the sailors now left on the wreck.|$|E
6000|$|Whopper had {{not been}} idle, and he soon had a <b>pot</b> <b>of</b> hot <b>coffee,</b> to which they added some {{condensed}} milk and water-soaked sugar. They also got some fish from the lake, and the entire morning was devoted to [...] "drying out" [...] and getting a substantial meal.|$|R
60|$|A long night's {{sleep and}} a <b>pot</b> <b>of</b> delicious <b>coffee</b> for breakfast {{put so much}} {{sunshine}} into my world that I set out for Franklin Square with a gambler's countenance, resolute to conceal my dismay from my friends and especially from my publisher. There {{was something in the}} very air of Broadway which generated confidence.|$|R
6000|$|As the {{conductor}} went on his affable way, huge watch-chain jingling against his blue chest, Babbitt and Ted gravely considered colleges. They arrived at Chicago late at night; they lay abed in the morning, rejoicing, [...] "Pretty nice {{not to have}} to get up and get down to breakfast, heh?" [...] They were staying at the modest Eden Hotel, because Zenith business men always stayed at the Eden, but they had dinner in the brocade and crystal Versailles Room of the Regency Hotel. Babbitt ordered Blue Point oysters with cocktail sauce, a tremendous steak with a tremendous platter of French fried potatoes, two <b>pots</b> <b>of</b> <b>coffee,</b> apple pie with ice cream for both of them and, for Ted, an extra piece of mince pie.|$|R
60|$|At noon {{they stopped}} {{in a small}} hollow, {{sheltered}} from the wind, and made themselves a hot <b>pot</b> <b>of</b> <b>coffee,</b> and ate a frugal lunch. Tom sat up {{for a few minutes}} and the others were glad to see that the journey had done him no harm, either physically or mentally.|$|E
60|$|Under the old hunter's {{directions}} {{they went}} to work, and by seven o'clock had the shelter cleaned out. This gave {{them a chance to}} get at their stores and also use the fireplace once more, and they cooked a fish breakfast and made a generous <b>pot</b> <b>of</b> <b>coffee</b> and another of chocolate.|$|E
60|$|They skated to the {{opposite}} shore and stopped near the shelter of some pines and hemlocks. All were willing to rest, and a small campfire was built, over which they made a <b>pot</b> <b>of</b> <b>coffee.</b> They had brought with them some sandwiches and some cake, and these made up the brief noonday meal.|$|E
6000|$|Bill was pasting court-plaster {{over the}} {{scratches}} and bruises on his features. There {{was a fire}} burning behind the big rock {{at the entrance of}} the cave, and the boy was watching a <b>pot</b> <b>of</b> boiling <b>coffee,</b> with two buzzard tail-feathers stuck in his red hair. He points a stick at me when I come up, and says: ...|$|R
6000|$|... "All sailors know sich things, Captain Gar'ner; {{though they}} know it with very {{different}} degrees of exper'ence. But few get {{as far south as}} I have been, to pass a winter. A good <b>pot</b> <b>of</b> hot <b>coffee</b> <b>of</b> a morning will go as far as a second pee-jacket, if a man has {{to go out into the}} open air when the weather is at the hardest." ...|$|R
5000|$|Norman Jewison got {{interested}} in a [...] "Hurricane" [...] Carter biopic in 1992. Armyan Bernstein purchased the filming rights through Beacon Pictures, {{and went on to}} write the first scripts while establishing a financing partnership with Irving Azoff. At first, Jewison felt the story was so extensive that it would fit better as a television miniseries. Once Denzel Washington signed to play the title character, he went through long boxing training, and worked closely with Rubin Carter. Washington said, [...] "He went through <b>pots</b> and <b>pots</b> <b>of</b> <b>coffee</b> and packs <b>of</b> cigarettes. I'd drink a little coffee. It's interesting and challenging when the person is there, alive and in the room." [...] Filming began in November 1998, with locations in both New Jersey - East Jersey State Prison in Trenton and the cities of Avenel and Paterson - and Toronto.|$|R
60|$|The {{afternoon}} wore away slowly {{until the}} sun began to set behind the timber west of the ranch. In the meantime, the boys, having had no dinner, grew hungry, and Ralph spent some time below in boiling a <b>pot</b> <b>of</b> <b>coffee</b> and stirring and baking some ash-cakes, serving both {{with a bit of}} broiled steak.|$|E
60|$|Harz set a <b>pot</b> <b>of</b> <b>coffee</b> on a spirit-lamp, and cut himself some bread. Through {{the window}} the {{freshness}} of the morning came; the scent of sap and blossom and young leaves; the scent of earth, and the mountains freed from winter; the new flights and songs of birds; all the odorous, enchanted, restless Spring.|$|E
6000|$|That noon, up {{in their}} cabin, Shorty placed on the table a pot of beans, a <b>pot</b> <b>of</b> <b>coffee,</b> a pan of sourdough biscuits, a tin of butter and a tin of {{condensed}} cream, a smoking platter of moose-meat and bacon, a plate of stewed dried peaches, and called: [...] "Grub's ready. Take a slant at Sally first." ...|$|E
50|$|A man {{finds himself}} {{alone on a}} dirt road, walking towards a diner. Inside he finds a jukebox playing loudly, and a <b>pot</b> <b>of</b> hot <b>coffee</b> on the stove, {{but there are no}} other people. He {{inquires}} for some breakfast, but no chef or waitress is to be found. He is dressed in an Air Force flight suit, but he does not remember who he is or how he got there.|$|R
60|$|All three {{attempted}} to spring to their feet, Glutts knocking over a <b>pot</b> <b>of</b> hot <b>coffee</b> {{as he did}} so. But the movement came too late, for the next instant the six snowballs bowled over the three boys, hurling them in all directions. One ball rolled through the lunch, carrying most of this along, imbedded in the snow. Another snowball went directly through the campfire, smashing that flat and leaving the embers hissing and blackened.|$|R
6000|$|... "Dinner is ready!" [...] called Fred at last, and {{one after}} another took a seat and ate the canned corn, tomatoes, and salmon which had been made ready. They also had a few {{crackers}} and a <b>pot</b> <b>of</b> rather weak <b>coffee,</b> but they were sincerely thankful that matters were not worse.|$|R
