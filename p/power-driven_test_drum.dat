40|$|The Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL) Nondestructive Assay (NDA) Service Center was {{contracted}} {{to develop and}} demonstrate a simple and inexpensive method of assaying 110 gallon drums at the Hanford Site’s T-Plant. The drums contained pucks of crushed old drums used for storage of transuranic (TRU) waste. The drums were to be assayed {{to determine if they}} meet the criteria for TRU or Low Level Waste (LLW). Because of the dense matrix (crushed steel drums) gamma measurement techniques were excluded and a mobile, configurable neutron system, consisting of four sequentially connected slab detectors was chosen to be used for this application. An optimum measurement configuration was determined through multiple test measurements with californium source. Based on these measurements the initial calibration of the system was performed applying the isotopic composition for aged weapon-grade plutonium. A series of background and blank puck drum measurements allowed estimating detection limits for both total (singles) and coincidence (doubles) counting techniques. It was found that even conservative estimates for minimum detection concentration using singles count rate were lower than the essential threshold of 100 nCi/g. Whereas the detection limit of coincidence counting appeared to be about as twice as high of the threshold. A series of measurements intended to verify the technique and revise the initial calibration obtained were performed at the Waste Receiving and Processing (WRAP) facility with plutonium standards. Standards with a total mass of 0. 3 g of plutonium (which is estimated to be equivalent of 100 nCi/g for net waste weight of 300 kg) loaded in the <b>test</b> puck <b>drum</b> were clearly detected. The following measurements of higher plutonium loadings verified the calibration factors obtained in the initial exercise. The revised and established calibration factors were also confirmed within established uncertainties by additional measurements of plutonium standards in various locations in the <b>test</b> <b>drum.</b> Due to necessity to dispense the blank <b>test</b> <b>drum</b> an alternative method of baseline determination was established during field measurements. Count rates of ambient background were corrected by the differences between observed background and blank <b>test</b> <b>drum</b> count rates which were previously determined over a series of measurements. Only 31 drums out of 352 counted during the intensive measurement campaign at T-Plant were determined to be Suspect TRU. 25 of these drums were re-measured at the WRAP facility using the SuperHENC.

30|$|To {{facilitate}} data {{development and}} reference matching, simplify calculation models, and ensure {{the accuracy of}} simulation models without performing a real car test, the transmission efficiency data of various components and losses of driveline measured through bench tests are used as assistant data and inputted into computer simulation software to forecast car fuel economy. In this research, a method for combining computer simulation forecast with CVT efficiency bench test is proposed based on the study results above. A driveline simulation model based on CVT efficiencies is subsequently built to forecast car fuel consumption. In Section  2, the driveline simulation model considering the fuel consumption calculation and the input interface of the CVT efficiency model is modeled. Then in Section  3, the CVT efficiency is tested through bench tests, and {{a function of the}} piecewise programming lookup is proposed, CVT efficiency model based on this function is connected with the input interface of the driveline simulation model. Driveline simulation system structure is presented in Section  4, and the optimal economic variogram assisting in improving torque converter (TC) efficiency and transmission efficiency [19] is generated to achieve ratio control. Test cycles and conditions are presented in Section  5, the simulation model and the real car <b>drum</b> <b>tests</b> in Section  6 are run to follow the conditions.

30|$|Assumptions {{and ideal}} {{simplifications}} of simulation model {{can cause the}} simulation errors. In addition, the errors between the simulation results and the real car <b>drum</b> <b>test</b> are simultaneously attributed to the CVT variogram and CVT efficiency model. The variogram used for the simulation of fuel economy should be an optimal economic variogram. In this study, such variogram is generated based on the original CVT variogram at incomplete throttle openings. However, the variograms used in the Transmission Control Unit (TCU) of the real car calibrated by the transmission factory are more complicated and consider more driving conditions, temperature conditions, and altitude conditions. The variogram used in the simulation is optimized based on the boundary conditions of vehicle performance, road conditions and the driving behavior of the driver, but numerous elements such as temperatures and altitudes are not fully considered. Consequently, the errors between the variogram generated {{in this study and}} the variogram used in the TCU are unavoidable. The contrastive results shown in Figures  16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23 indicate that the simulation ratio does not completely follow the real ratio, thereby resulting in errors in input torques and input speeds between the simulations and the real car <b>drum</b> <b>tests,</b> which can lead to fuel economy calculation errors. Similarly, the contrastive results of the ratios, input torques, and input speeds under constant velocity condition shown in Figures  25, 26 indicate that the errors are attributed to the same reason. Moreover, the ratio errors between the simulation results and <b>drum</b> <b>test</b> results affect fuel economy forecast more evidently, particularly at 90  km/h and 120  km/h in driver control mode. In addition, the CVT efficiency model is based on the efficiency bench test within an ideal oil temperature range of 80 ± 2  °C and the effects of temperatures on transmission efficiency are also not considered in the preceding assumption. The oil temperatures collected from CAN signals in the real car <b>drum</b> <b>test</b> are between 69  °C and 109  °C, which are influenced by working time and conditions. The longer the time and the higher the speed of CVT runs, the higher the oil temperature is. Therefore, the errors between the temperatures of the simulations and <b>drum</b> <b>tests</b> lead to the errors in real-time CVT efficiencies, which affect fuel economy forecast. To decrease errors, a better optimization algorithm that considers more conditions should be used to generate a better CVT variogram and a better CVT efficiency model that considers more temperature conditions should be built in future works.|$|R

The A&PCT active source requirements are highly dependent upon the attenuation properties of the waste matrix within the drum. On {{of the most highly}} attenuating waste matrices is sludge. This waste stream will consist of solidified aqueous waste consisting of IDC 001 first stage sludge and IDC 007 wet sludge. Also, the stream consists of solidified organic waste known as code IDC 003 organic setups.

40|$|Drum {{sound is}} the sound {{produced}} when an object, such as a foot, hits the flooring in the room in which the receiving ear is located. Drum sound has attracted interest in recent years, particularly due to an increased use of thin floating floor constructions, such as veneer or laminate flooring, which can produce loud and sharp walking sound. A prediction model of the subjective response, in a paired comparison <b>test,</b> to <b>drum</b> sound based on differences in objective measurements is developed. The difference in 10 -percentile loudness, N 10, between two stimuli is shown to predict the subjective perceived disturbance better than, for example, A-weighted sound pressure level. A difference of about 8 % in N 10 resulted in 50 % of the assessors noticing a difference. A comparison of different existing approaches to analysing the result from a paired comparison test is made. The main focus is set on the basic models by Thurstone-Mosteller and Bradley-Terry and extensions of these concerning ties. Procedures for testing if the responses and calculated ranking values are statistically different are presented. The {{advantages and disadvantages of}} these methods are discussed. These methods are illustrated with examples from <b>tests</b> on <b>drum</b> sound from floor coverings. A branch norm has been established for measuring drum sound on laminate floor coverings.

A round-robin study of the norm is reported along with the results of a paired comparison listening test using the same floor coverings. General aspects of evaluation measures, tapping machines, test environments, etc., that need to be considered when measuring drum sound on various floor coverings are discussed. It is concluded that loudness as measured according to ISO 532 B correlates the best with the subjective perception of the drum sound's loudness.
