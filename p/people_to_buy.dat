5|$|For {{many years}} Fonda took ballet class to keep fit, but after {{fracturing}} her foot while filming The China Syndrome, {{she was no}} longer able to participate. To compensate, she began participating in aerobics and strengthening exercises under the direction of Leni Cazden. The Leni Workout became the Jane Fonda Workout, which began a second career for her, continuing for many years. This was considered one of the influences that started the fitness craze among baby boomers, then approaching middle age. In 1982, Fonda released her first exercise video, titled Jane Fonda's Workout, inspired by her best-selling book, Jane Fonda's Workout Book. Jane Fonda's Workout became the highest selling home video of the next few years, selling over a million copies. The video's release led many <b>people</b> <b>to</b> <b>buy</b> the then-new VCR in order to watch and perform the workout at home. The exercise videos were produced and directed by Sidney Galanty, who helped to put the deal together with video distributor Stuart Karl, of Karl Home Video. Galanty produced the first video and 11 more after that. She would subsequently release 23 workout videos with the series selling a total of 17 million copies combined, more than any other exercise series. She released five workout books and thirteen audio programs, through 1995. After a fifteen-year hiatus, she released two new fitness videos on DVD in 2010, aiming at an older audience.|$|E

25|$|The federal {{government}} subsidizes the employer-based market by an estimated $250 {{billion per year}} (about $1,612 per person covered in the employer market), by excluding health insurance premiums from employee income. This subsidy encourages <b>people</b> <b>to</b> <b>buy</b> more extensive coverage (which places upward pressure on average premiums), while also encouraging more young, healthy people to enroll (which places downward pressure on premium prices). CBO estimates the net effect is to increase premiums 10-15% over an un-subsidized level.|$|E

25|$|While the United States {{with its}} soil {{untouched}} by the war was enjoying prosperity and living standards of a sort never seen before in history, life in postwar Britain was comparatively grim. Living standards and life expectancy were low, there was little for working-class <b>people</b> <b>to</b> <b>buy,</b> and infectious diseases such as tuberculosis continued to claim many lives. Automobile and home ownership were limited to the upper class of society. Birthrates were low compared to the contemporary baby boom in the US.|$|E

In 2006 the project produced a basic functional prototype and in May 2008 the machine succeeded in producing all of the plastic parts required to make a 'child' machine.|$|E
500|$|Louis Francois Menage (August 3, 1850 – March 18, 1924) was a {{real estate}} {{speculator}} and prominent figure in early Minneapolis, Minnesota history. Originally born in Rhode Island, he settled in Minneapolis in 1874. Characterized as a [...] "tycoon" [...] and [...] "robber baron," [...] Menage earned a fortune developing land on the city's borders into residential housing and financing the mortgages to enable <b>people</b> <b>to</b> <b>buy</b> his properties. During the 1870s and 1880s, he developed large areas of South Minneapolis including much of the area around Lake Calhoun and Lake Harriet. He also developed a luxury resort on Lake Calhoun and built a corporate headquarters which {{was at the time}} the city's tallest skyscraper.|$|E
500|$|Prior to {{and after}} the mandate, all Xbox One {{consoles}} initially shipped with the Kinect sensor included. On June 9, 2014, cheaper Xbox One bundles were introduced, which {{did not include the}} Kinect sensor. Microsoft stated the decision to offer Xbox One bundles without Kinect was to [...] " [...] a choice to people that would allow <b>people</b> <b>to</b> <b>buy</b> an Xbox One and then ramp up to Kinect when they can afford to", while also allowing games to use processing power that was previously reserved for Kinect. An updated Xbox Development Kit issued in June 2014 allows developers to explicitly disable motion tracking functionality in games, allowing access to additional system resources that represent about 10% of the GPU processing power. These resources were previously reserved for Kinect skeletal tracking, regardless of whether the Kinect sensor was attached or in use.|$|E

500|$|The 1993 Republican alternative, {{introduced}} by Senator John Chafee as the Health Equity and Access Reform Today Act, contained a [...] "universal coverage" [...] requirement with a penalty for noncompliance—an individual mandate—as well as subsidies {{to be used}} in state-based 'purchasing groups'. Advocates for the 1993 bill included prominent Republicans such as Senators Orrin Hatch, Chuck Grassley, Bob Bennett and Kit Bond. Of 1993's 43 Republican Senators, 20 supported the HEART Act. Another Republican proposal, introduced in 1994 by Senator Don Nickles (R-OK), the Consumer Choice Health Security Act, contained an individual mandate with a penalty provision; however, Nickles subsequently removed the mandate from the bill, stating he had decided [...] "that government should not compel <b>people</b> <b>to</b> <b>buy</b> health insurance". At the time of these proposals, Republicans did not raise constitutional issues with the mandate; Mark Pauly, who helped develop a proposal that included an individual mandate for George H. W. Bush, remarked, [...] "I don't remember that being raised at all. The way it was viewed by the Congressional Budget Office in 1994 was, effectively, as a tax." ...|$|E
500|$|In March2015, Iwata put part of Nintendo's {{focus on}} the growing mobile game market, {{creating}} a landmark partnership with mobile provider DeNA to publish titles, as traditional hardware console sales began to falter. This came {{in stark contrast to}} the company's previous business model which put focus on console exclusive titles to prompt <b>people</b> <b>to</b> <b>buy</b> their platforms. Iwata emphasized that although Nintendo IPs would be utilized in mobile games, the company would not compromise their integrity. He also stressed that the main goal would be to reach as many people as possible rather than which options would earn the most money, similar to the idea behind the Wii. After the partnership with DeNA was established, Iwata reiterated his stance that the common free-to-play type mobile games, which he referred to as [...] "free-to-start," [...] threatened the future quality of games. Although he acknowledged the practice as a viable means of promoting titles in the short-term, he considered the model outdated and not a sound direction for core development. He also emphasized that the business model for these games did not match with the core values of Nintendo and could not serve as the basis of [...] "long-lasting relationship with [...] customers".|$|E
500|$|The act forbade {{the company}} from issuing shares below £10 so, to make them easier for {{ordinary}} <b>people</b> <b>to</b> <b>buy,</b> they issued shilling coupons in books of ten {{so they could be}} paid for in instalments. [...] The construction costs and expected competition from the Port of Liverpool put off potential investors; by May 1887 only £3 million had been raised. As a temporary solution Thomas Walker, the contractor selected to construct the canal, agreed to accept £500,000 of the contract price in shares, but raising the remainder required another Act of Parliament to allow the company's share capital to be restructured as £3 million of ordinary shares and £4million of preference shares. Adamson was convinced that the money should be raised from members of the public and opposed the debt restructuring, resigning as chairman of the Ship Canal Committee on 1 February 1887. Barings and Rothschild jointly issued a prospectus for the sale of the preference shares on 15 July, and by 21 July the issue had been fully underwritten, allowing construction to begin. [...] The first sod was cut on 11 November 1887, by Lord Egerton of Tatton, who had taken over the chairmanship of the Manchester Ship Canal Company from Adamson.|$|E
