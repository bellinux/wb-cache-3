The development of techniques for enhancing and ensuring the filability of thin-wall mold cavities is most critical for thinner wall cast steel production. The purpose {{of this research was}} to develop thin-wall casting techniques {{that can be used to}} reliably produce thin-wall castings from traditional gravity poured sand casting processes. The focus of the research was to enhance the filling behavior to prevent misrunds. Experiments were conducted to investigate the influence of various foundry variables on the filling of thin section steel castings. These variables include casting design, heat transfer, gating design, and metal fluidity. Wall thickness and pouring temperature have the greatest effect on casting fill. As wall thickness increases the volume to surface area of the casting increases, which increases the solidification time, allowing the metal to flow further in thicker sect ions. <b>Pouring</b> <b>time</b> is another significant variable affecting casting fill. Increases or decreases of 20 % in the <b>pouring</b> <b>time</b> were found to have a significant effect on the filling of thin-wall production castings. Gating variables, including venting, pouring head height, and mold tilting also significantly affected thin-wall casting fill.

40|$|A new {{disposal}} unit, {{designated as}} Saltstone Disposal Unit 6 (SDU 6), is being designed for support of site accelerated closure goals and salt waste projections {{identified in the}} new Liquid Waste System Plan. The unit is a cylindrical disposal cell of 375 ft in diameter and 43 ft in height, {{and it has a}} minimum 30 million gallons of capacity. SRNL was requested to evaluate the impact of an increased grout placement height on the flow patterns radially spread on the floor and to determine whether grout quality is impacted by the height. The primary goals of the work are to develop the baseline Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) model and to perform the evaluations for the flow patterns of grout material in SDU 6 as a function of elevation of grout discharge port and grout rheology. Two transient grout models have been developed by taking a three-dimensional multiphase CFD approach to estimate the domain size of the grout materials radially spread on the facility floor and to perform the sensitivity analysis with respect to the baseline design and operating conditions such as elevation height of the discharge port and fresh grout properties. For the CFD modeling calculations, air-grout Volume of Fluid (VOF) method combined with Bingham plastic and time-dependent grout models were used for examining the impact of fluid spread performance for the initial baseline configurations and to evaluate the impact of grout pouring height on grout quality. The grout quality was estimated in terms of the air volume fraction for the grout layer formed on the SDU 6 floor, resulting in the change of grout density. The study results should be considered as preliminary scoping analyses since benchmarking analysis is not included in this task scope. Transient analyses with the Bingham plastic model were performed with the FLUENTTM code on the high performance parallel computing platform in SRNL. The analysis coupled with a transient grout aging model was performed by using ANSYS-CFX code in the parallel computing platform in Mercer University. Recommended operational guidance was developed assuming that local shear rates and flow patterns related to radial spread along the SDU floor {{can be used as a}} measure of grout performance and spatial dispersion affected by the grout height and viscosity. The 5 ft height baseline results show that when the 150 gpm grout flow with a 5 Pa yield stress and a 60 cp viscosity is poured down through a 3 inch discharge port, the grout is spread radially up to about 64 ft distance from the pouring center after 2 hours&#x 27; <b>pouring</b> <b>time.</b> The air volume fraction of the grout layer is about 29 % at 5 minutes&#x 27; transient time, and it is reduced by about 9 % in 2 hours&#x 27; <b>pouring</b> <b>time,</b> resulting in the grout density consisting of about 80 % grout and 20 % air volume fractions. The sensitivity results show that when the discharge port is located at a higher position, a larger amount of air is trapped inside the layer formed below the discharge port at the early transient time of less than 30 minutes because of the higher impinging momentum of the grout flow on the floor, resulting in the formation of less smooth layer. The results clearly indicate that the radial spread for the 43 ft discharge port is about 10 % faster than that of the 5 ft discharge port for the early transient period of 5 minutes. However, for the <b>pouring</b> <b>time</b> longer than half an hour, the discharge port height does not affect the radial distance spread on the disposal floor. When grout quality is related to grout volume fraction, the grout volume fraction for the 43 ft discharge port has lower volume fraction than the 5 ft discharge port for the transient period of the first 5 minutes. However, for the <b>pouring</b> <b>time</b> longer than half an hour, the discharge port height does not affect the grout volume fraction for the layer accumulated on the disposal floor. A modified Bingham plastic model coupled with time-dependent viscosity behavior was developed for conducting the initial scoping calculations to assess the impact of fluid residence time on radial spreading and basic flow patterns. The results for the transient viscosity model show that when grout material becomes more viscous, the thickness of the grout layer accumulated on the floor becomes higher, but the radial distance spread on the horizontal floor becomes smaller. The early transient results for the grout density with about 32 % air volume fractions are in reasonable agreement with those of the idealized Bingham plastic model. It is recommended that the current models developed here be benchmarked against the experimental results for critical applications of the modeling results...|$|E

Materials and methods: A master model was mounted on a modified articulator designed to standardize impression procedures. A total of 250 impressions were taken and grouped into 25 groups (n =  10) according to irreversible hydrocolloid material (CA 37, Tropicalgin, ColorChange, Hydrogum 5, and Hydrocolor 5) and storage time (0 hours, 1 hour, 24 hours, 72 hours, and 120 hours). Impressions were stored at 23  ±  1 °C and 100 % relative humidity and poured with gypsum at the predetermined storage time. Casts were scanned with a three-dimensional (3 D) model scanner. The digital models were measured and subtracted from the measurements obtained from the master model. The absolute values of dimensional differences were statistically analyzed using two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) and post hoc Fisher LSD test (P <  0. 05).

Repair process on the Aluminium sample using similar metal has been carried out to investigate the micro-structural effect.

The constraint to the measured temporal derivative of the PTV particle tracks improves {{the consistency of the}} reconstructed velocity field. The method is christened as <b>pouring</b> <b>time</b> into space, as it leverages temporal information to increase the spatial resolution of volumetric PTV measurements. This approach becomes relevant in cases where the spatial resolution is limited by the seeding concentration. The method solves an optimization problem to find the vorticity and velocity fields that minimize a cost function, which includes next to instantaneous velocity, also the velocity material derivative. The velocity and its material derivative are related through the vorticity transport equation, and the cost function is minimized using the limited-memory Broyden–Fletcher–Goldfarb–Shanno (L-BFGS) algorithm. The procedure is assessed numerically with a simulated PTV experiment in a turbulent boundary layer from a direct numerical simulation (DNS). The experimental validation considers a tomographic particle image velocimetry (PIV) experiment in a similar turbulent boundary layer and the additional case of a jet flow. The proposed technique (‘vortex-in-cell plus’, VIC+) is compared to tomographic PIV analysis (3 D iterative cross-correlation), PTV interpolation methods (linear and adaptive Gaussian windowing) and to vortex-in-cell (VIC) interpolation without the material derivative. A visible increase in resolved details in the turbulent structures is obtained with the VIC+ approach, both in numerical simulations and experiments. This results in a more accurate determination of the turbulent stresses distribution in turbulent boundary layer investigations. Data from a jet experiment, where the vortex topology is retrieved with a small number of tracers indicate the potential utilization of VIC+ in low-concentration experiments as for instance occurring in large-scale volumetric PTV measurements.

When not properly applied, {{the presence of these}} filters may have a significant influence on mould filling. 3 -D casting simulation has been applied to study the effects of the use of a ceramic filter on the metal flow in a gating system. Instead of using a pressure drop model to represent the behaviour of a fluid metal flow passing through a filter, a real exact filter geometry, which is created by a high resolution CT-scan and a non-destructive imaging technique, in the gating system is applied in the simulation. In this research, nodular cast iron is poured into a block casting. A depressurized gating system is used. After a choke, a filter with different orientations is placed in the system. Mould filling coupled with temperature is simulated. Geometries using different orientations of the filter, and without the filter have been researched.

Although the filter has no significant influence on the flow patterns in the block casting itself, the flow patterns in the filter zone are different. When the liquid metal passes a horizontal filter, it will be broken into many small streams and show a shower effect. After the part under the filter is full, the shower effect disappears.

As compared to using non-perforated ring trays, the percentage of dimensional changes that occurred were (-) 0. 49 ± 0. 49 on top area, (-) 8. 76 ± 3. 95 on base area and (+) 1. 19 ± 0. 71 in height, respectively. There was {{a significant difference in the}} direction of the dimensional changes on both the top areas, but not in the base areas and height...|$|E
40|$|The {{existing}} time-resolved tomographic particle image velocimetry (PIV) measurements by Jodai and Elsinga (J Fluid Mech 795 : 611 – 633; Jodai, Elsinga, J Fluid Mech 795 : 611 – 633, 2016) in {{a turbulent}} boundary layer (Re θ  =  2038) are reprocessed using tomographic particle tracking velocimetry (PTV) and vortex-in-cell-plus (VIC+). The resulting small-scale flow properties, i. e. vorticity and turbulence dissipation, are compared. The VIC+ technique was recently proposed and uses the concept of <b>pouring</b> <b>time</b> into space to increase reconstruction quality of instantaneous velocity. The tomographic PTV particle track measurements are interpolated using VIC+ to a dense grid, making use of both particle velocity and Lagrangian acceleration. Comparison of the vortical structures by visualization of isosurfaces of vorticity magnitude shows that the two methods return similar coherent vortical structures, but their strength in terms of vorticity magnitude is increased when using VIC+, which suggests an improvement in spatial resolution. Further statistical evaluation shows that the root mean square (rms) of vorticity fluctuations from tomographic PIV is approximately 40 % lower in comparison to a reference profile available from a DNS simulation, while the VIC+ technique returns rms vorticity fluctuations to within 10 % of the reference. The dissipation rate is heavily underestimated by tomographic PIV with approximately 50 % damping, whereas the VIC+ analysis yields a dissipation rate to within approximately 5 % for y + >  25. The fact that dissipation can be directly measured by a volumetric experiment is novel. It differs from existing approaches that involve 2 d measurements combined with isotropic turbulence assumptions or apply corrections based on sub-grid scale turbulence modelling. Finally, the study quantifies the spatial response of VIC+ with a sine-wave lattice analysis. The results indicate a twofold increase of spatial resolution with respect to cross-correlation interrogation. </p...|$|E
40|$|The {{present study}} is {{concerned}} with the investigation of mechanical properties of A 713 alloy castings produced by investment casting process using expandable polystyrene as the pattern material and the plaster of paris as the mould material. Experiments were conducted as per Taguchi’s L 9 orthogonal array. Castings were made under the constraint of different process parameters like mould firing temperature, <b>pouring</b> temperature, firing <b>time</b> and mixing of silica sand of different grain fineness numbers to investigate their effects on the surface hardness, impact strength and tensile strength of the final castings. The variations in the trend of the aforesaid mechanical properties were observed and it was deduced out that high mould firing temperature, higher pouring temperature, maximum firing time and high grain fineness number significantly reduce the mechanical properties of A 713 alloy castings produced by the above process...|$|R
2500|$|On 20 April 2012, a Boeing 737-200 (AP-BKC), Bhoja Air Flight 213 {{carrying}} 127 {{people on}} a flight from Karachi's Jinnah International Airport destined for Islamabad's Benazir Bhutto International Airport crashed near Chaklala killing all 127 people on board. Pakistani Defence Ministry officials believe that the plane crashed into a remote residential area. There were also bad weather conditions, with lightning and rain <b>pouring</b> at the <b>time</b> of landing. Eye-witness reports say that the aircraft was already on fire on its landing approach before it crashed. [...] Initial reports suggest that as the pilots of Bhoja Air Flight B4-213 attempted to land amidst rain and strong winds, the ill-fated aircraft might have flown into an unexpected wind shear that possibly smashed {{it on the ground}} below. The aircraft had been retired by Shaheen Air and then acquired and placed in service by Bhoja Air in March 2012.|$|R
40|$|There {{are special}} {{challenges}} in writing a Presidential Address: {{you want to}} address a very broad group of philosophers with knowledge and abilities that far exceed your own, {{and you want to}} say something that will be as engaging as possible. Philosophers have addressed a great many issues, with different methods, and I want there to be space in our discipline for all of them. I myself love arcane philosophical topics – put me in a world where I could spend my <b>time</b> <b>pouring</b> over Aristotle’s Metaphysics and I’d be happy – and I believe that philosophy yields knowledge and that is intrinsically valuable. I also love kinds of philosophy that many would not regard as philosophy at all: philosophy as it emerges in thinking about personal and family issues, philosophy in the context of political activism, and philosophy that is inextricable from empirical research...|$|R
