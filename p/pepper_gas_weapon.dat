50|$|It was {{the place}} where poison <b>gas</b> <b>weapons</b> {{were used for the}} first time, during First World War, when on 31 January 1915, during the Battle of Bolimov, the German Army shelled Russian army {{positions}} with xylyl bromide; the attack was relatively unsuccessful due to low temperature which prevented the gas from vaporising and spreading. A much larger attack with poison gas occurred in the nearby area on 31 May 1915, and Russian army suffered much higher casualties (over several thousand dead).|$|R
25|$|The British Army {{believed}} {{that the use of}} gas was needed, but did not use mustard gas until November 1917 at Cambrai, after their armies had captured a stockpile of German mustard-gas shells.

(The only option available to the British was the Despretz–Niemann–Guthrie process). This was used first in September 1918 during the breaking of the Hindenburg Line with the Hundred Days' Offensive.|$|R

25|$|The Chemical Warfare Service {{deployed}} {{and prepared}} <b>gas</b> <b>weapons</b> for use {{throughout the world}} during World War II. However, these weapons were never used in combat. Despite the lack of chemical warfare during the conflict, the CWS saw its funding and personnel increase substantially due to concerns that the Germans and Japanese had a formidable chemical weapons capability. By 1942 the CWS employed 60,000 soldiers and civilians and was appropriated $1billion. The CWS completed a variety of non-chemical warfare related tasks and missions during the war including producing incendiaries for flame throwers, flame tanks and other weapons. Chemical soldiers were also involved in smoke generation missions. Chemical mortar battalions used the 4.2 inch chemical mortar to support armor and infantry units.|$|R
50|$|Mustard gas {{was first}} used {{effectively}} in World War I by the German army against British and Canadian soldiers near Ypres, Belgium, in 1917 and later also against the French Second Army.

The Allies did not use mustard gas until November 1917 at Cambrai, France, after the armies had captured a stockpile of German mustard-gas shells. It took the British more than a year to develop their own mustard <b>gas</b> <b>weapon,</b> with production of the chemicals centred on Avonmouth Docks.

His continued improvements saw him repeatedly promoted, reaching the rank of Lt Col in the Royal Engineers. Harrison died of pneumonia at 49, one week before Armistice Day.|$|R
