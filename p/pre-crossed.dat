In dissociated cortical cultures we showed that Wnt 5 a simultaneously promotes axon outgrowth and repulsion by calcium signaling. Here to test the role of Wnt 5 a/calcium signaling in a complex in vivo environment we used sensorimotor cortical slices containing the developing corpus callosum. Plasmids encoding the cytoplasmic marker DsRed and the genetically encoded calcium indicator GCaMP 2 were electroporated into one cortical hemisphere.

40|$|Semaphorins are a {{large family}} of axon {{guidance}} molecules that are known primarily as ligands for plexins and neuropilins. Although class- 6 semaphorins are transmembrane proteins, they have been implicated as ligands in different aspects of neural development, including neural crest cell migration, axon guidance and cerebellar development. However, the specific spatial and temporal expression of semaphorin 6 B (Sema 6 B) in chick commissural neurons suggested a receptor role in axon guidance at the spinal cord midline. Indeed, {{in the absence of}} Sema 6 B, post-crossing commissural axons lacked an instructive signal directing them rostrally along the contralateral floorplate border, resulting in stalling at the exit site or even caudal turns. Truncated Sema 6 B lacking the intracellular domain was unable to rescue the loss-of-function phenotype, confirming a receptor function of Sema 6 B. In support of this, we demonstrate that Sema 6 B binds to floorplate-derived plexin A 2 (PlxnA 2) for navigation at the midline, whereas a cis-interaction between PlxnA 2 and Sema 6 B on <b>pre-crossing</b> commissural axons may regulate the responsiveness of axons to floorplate-derived cues...|$|R
40|$|AbstractCommissural interneurons (CI) of the {{vertebrate}} {{spinal cord}} are guided ventrally {{toward the floor}} plate, but subsequently cross the midline and select a longitudinal fascicle at specific dorsal–ventral (D–V) positions. We examined at high resolution the detailed behaviors of individual pathfinding CI growth cones on the ipsilateral and contralateral sides of the spinal cord of living Xenopus embryos. We find that <b>pre-crossing</b> CI growth cones exhibit distinct pathfinding behaviors compared to post-crossing axons and that the behavioral switch occurs immediately upon crossing to the contralateral side. Groups of pioneer commissural axons typically extend simultaneously toward the ventral midline following discrete paths with separation between adjacent commissurals apparently maintained through contact inhibition. In contrast, shortly after crossing the midline, commissural axons turn longitudinally and begin to fasciculate with other crossed CIs. However, growth cones of crossed commissurals often select their final D–V longitudinal track {{through a series of}} rapid step-like dorsal adjustments that may be due to differential fasciculation with longitudinal axons. Together, our results suggest that guidance of commissural axons is controlled in part through interactions among CIs that switch rapidly from avoidance to fasciculation after midline crossing...|$|R

40|$|Older {{adults have}} been shown to trip on {{obstacles}} despite taking precautions to step carefully. It has been demonstrated in dual-task walking that age-related decline in cognitive and attentional mechanisms can compromise postural management. This is yet to be substantiated during obstacle negotiation when walking. Forty-six healthy volunteers (aged 20 - 79 years) stepped over obstacles in their path whilst walking and performing a verbal fluency task. Using 3 D kinematic analysis we compared obstacle crossing during single (obstacle crossing only) and dual-task (obstacle crossing with verbal task) conditions. We grouped the participants into three age groups and examined age-related changes to cognitive interference on obstacle crossing. During dual-task trials, the 20 - 29 and 60 - 69 groups stepped closer to the obstacles prior to crossing, increased vertical toe-obstacle clearance, and had reduced gait variability. In these two groups there was a small dual-task decrease in verbal output. The 70 - 79 group applied similar dual-task stepping strategies during <b>pre-crossing.</b> However, during crossing they showed reduced vertical toe-to-obstacle clearance and increased variability of obstacle-to-heel distance. Additionally, this group did not show any significant change to verbal output across trials. These results suggest that with advanced age, increased cognitive demands {{are more likely to have}} a detrimental impact on motor performance, leading to compromised safety margins and increased variability in foot placement. We conclude that younger adults utilise a posture-preserving strategy during complex tasks but the likelihood of this strategy being used decreases with advanced age...|$|R

It is currently unclear, however, whether balance and gait capacities can be improved by training in this group of patients. Therefore, {{the aim of this}} study was to examine the effects of gait adaptability training on obstacle avoidance and dynamic stability during adaptive gait. Ten patients with degenerative cerebellar ataxia received 10 protocolized gait adaptability training sessions of 1 h each during 5 weeks. Training was performed on a treadmill with visual stepping targets and obstacles projected on the belt's surface. As the primary outcome, we used an obstacle avoidance task while walking on a treadmill. We determined avoidance success rates, as well as dynamic stability during the avoidance manoeuvre. Clinical ratings included the scale for the assessment of ataxia (SARA), 10 m walking test, timed up-and-go test, berg balance scale, and the obstacle subtask of the emory functional ambulation profile (EFAP). Following the intervention, success rates on the obstacle avoidance task had significantly improved compared to pre-intervention. For successful avoidance, participants allowed themselves smaller stability margins in the sagittal plane in the (shortened) <b>pre-crossing</b> step. However, in the subsequent steps they returned to baseline stability values more effectively than before training. SARA scores and the EFAP obstacle subtask improved significantly as well.

The {{purpose of the present study}} was to probe the effect of the separation treatments (harsh vs mild) on gluten structure, morphology, and performance in bio-based films. The harshly separated industrial WG showed aggregated and <b>pre-cross</b> linked structure in the starting material most likely due to shear forces during gluten separation from flour and heat effect during the drying procedures. Further, when the harshly separated WG was processed into films the pre-crosslinked starting material restricted new crosslinks formation and structural rearrangements at nano-scale. The mechanical integrity of the film was also affected resulting in films with low Young's modulus and strength. WG (from cultivars Diskette, Puntari, and Sleipner) recovered from mild separation showed relatively "native" non-destructed crosslinking pattern and not previously observed structural morphology at nano-scale. When processed into films the mildly separated WG showed well polymerized intimately crosslinked proteins both with disulfide and other covalent crosslinks. The nano-scale morphology showed lamellar and hexagonal arrangements, not reported so far in any study. The structural rearrangements among films from mildly separated WG resulted in materials with improved mechanical integrity as compared to films from harshly separated WG. The present study showed that the quality of WG is significantly affected by the separation procedure which also affects protein polymerization, nano-scale morphology, and tensile properties of films.

40|$|Slits, {{a family}} of {{secreted}} proteins, are crucial for axon guidance during {{the development of the}} central nervous system. In rats, Slit 1, Slit 2 and Slit 3 mRNA are expressed in midline glial populations surrounding the developing corpus callosum (Marillat et al., 2002). A previous study has shown that mice lacking the Slit 2 gene have an acallosal phenotype (Bagri et al., 2002). However, the role of Slit 1 and Slit 3 {{in the development of the}} corpus callosum is unknown. In the present study expression analysis of Slit 1, Slit 2 and Slit 3 mRNA performed on mice, showed that these molecules were expressed around the developing corpus callosum. To understand the role each Slit might play in the development of the corpus callosum, 4 Slit mutant mouse strains, Slit 1 -/-, Slit 2 -/-, Slit 1 -/-;Slit 2 -/- and Slit 3 -/- mice were analysed. This study confirmed that Slit 2 -/- mice displayed dysgenesis of the corpus callosum across its rostro-caudal extent. Mice lacking the Slit 1 gene did not exhibit an acallosal phenotype, however, Slit 1 -/-;Slit 2 -/- mice displayed a more severe phenotype compared to mice deficient in Slit 2 alone, indicating a role for Slit 1 in corpus callosum development. A subset of the Slit 3 -/- mice displayed an axon guidance defect in the corpus callosum, where the callosal axons in the dorsal region of the tract failed to cross the midline. This defect was observed in embryonic as well as postnatal ages. The callosal axon guidance defects in Slit 2 -/- and Slit 1 -/-;Slit 2 -/- mice were also observed at earlier stages during the development of the cingulate pioneering axons of the corpus callosum. Apart from axon guidance Slit 1, Slit 2 and Slit 3 were involved in the development of the glial populations at the midline of the cerebral cortex. Slit 2 -/- and Slit 1 -/-;Slit 2 -/- mice exhibited a positional defect where the indusium griseum glia was ventrally displaced. The glial-positioning defect in Slit 1 -/-;Slit 2 -/- mice was more severe compared to Slit 2 -/- mice. No positional defect was observed in Slit 3 -/- mice, however the development of the indusium griseum glia was affected. To compare the axon guidance phenotype of the Slit 2 -/- mice, and the knockout of its known receptor Robo 1 -/- mice, diffusion tensor magnetic resonance imaging and tractography was performed on Slit 2 -/-, and Robo 1 -/- mice. These experiments showed that the axon guidance defect in Slit 2 -/- mice is similar, but more severe compared to Robo 1 -/- mice. The axons of the CC are displaced rostrocaudally in both Slit 2 -/- and Robo 1 -/- mice. In Robo 1 -/- mice only the <b>pre-crossing</b> axons are affected while in Slit 2 -/- mice both the <b>pre-crossing</b> as well as post-crossing axons are affected. These results suggest a possible role for Slit in the development of the telencephalic midline, where it is first involved in the proper positioning and development of the midline glial populations and then acts as an axon guidance molecule for the crossing of callosal axons to their homotypic targets in the contralateral hemisphere...|$|R
40|$|It {{has been}} shown in vivo that Wnt 5 a {{gradients}} surround the corpus callosum and guide callosal axons after the midline (postcrossing) by Wnt 5 a-induced repulsion via Ryk receptors. In dissociated cortical cultures we showed that Wnt 5 a simultaneously promotes axon outgrowth and repulsion by calcium signaling. Here to test the role of Wnt 5 a/calcium signaling in a complex in vivo environment we used sensorimotor cortical slices containing the developing corpus callosum. Plasmids encoding the cytoplasmic marker DsRed and the genetically encoded calcium indicator GCaMP 2 were electroporated into one cortical hemisphere. Postcrossing callosal axons grew 50 % faster than <b>pre-crossing</b> axons and higher frequencies of calcium transients in axons and growth cones correlated well with outgrowth. Application of pharmacological inhibitors to the slices showed that signaling pathways involving calcium release through IP 3 receptors and calcium entry through TRP channels regulate post-crossing axon outgrowth and guidance. Co-electroporation of Ryk siRNA and DsRed revealed that knock down of the Ryk receptor reduced outgrowth rates of postcrossing but not precrossing axons by 50 % and caused axon misrouting. Guidance errors in axons with Ryk knockdown resulted from reduced calcium activity. In the corpus callosum CaMKII inhibition reduced the outgrowth rate of postcrossing (but not precrossing) axons and caused severe guidance errors which resulted from reduced CaMKII-dependent repulsion downstream of Wnt/calcium. We show {{for the first time that}} Wnt/Ryk calcium signaling mechanisms regulating axon outgrowth and repulsion in cortical cultures are also essential for the proper growth and guidance of postcrossing callosal axons which involve axon repulsion through CaMKII. © 2010 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

40|$|The midline is a {{critical}} intermediate target for the developing axons of any bilaterally symmetric nervous system and establishing appropriate midline circuitry is essential to control locomotive behaviors. Several conserved families of guidance cues and receptors regulate axon guidance at the midline, including the attractive cues-Netrins and their DCC/Fra receptors, and the repulsive cues-Slits and their Robo receptors. At the Drosophila midline, Robo repulsive signaling functions to prevent ipisilaterally projecting axons from crossing the midline, and also to prevent post-crossing commissural axons from crossing back. A major signaling output downstream of Robo is Slit mediated up-regulation of Rac activity. However, {{the link between the}} Robo receptor and Rac activation has not been established. In this thesis I demonstrate that a Rho/Ras dual GEF Son of sevenless is recruited to the Robo receptor at the plasma membrane through the adaptor protein Dock to regulate Rac-dependent cytoskeletal rearrangement upon Slit stimulation. Further the RhoGEF activity but not the RasGEF activity of Sos is required for Sos guidance function. ^ Commissureless (Comm) controls axon guidance by regulating surface levels of the Robo receptor on commissural axons, thereby preventing premature responsiveness to the Slit repellent. Comm is expressed transiently in <b>pre-crossing</b> commissural neurons where it sorts the Robo receptor to endosomes for degradation. Yet, the molecular mechanism that activates comm expression is unknown. Here I show that Frazzled (Fra) is required cell-autonomously to direct comm mRNA expression in a Netrin-independent manner and its cytoplasmic domain is required for this function. Our data suggest that to ensure proper commissural guidance, Fra signaling has dual functions: first it mediates Netrin-dependent attraction and second it leads to the Netrin-independent activation of comm transcription. ...|$|R
40|$|After stroke, {{the ability}} to make step {{adjustments}} during walking is reduced and requires more attention, which may cause problems during community walking. The C-Mill is an innovative treadmill augmented with visual context (e. g., obstacles and stepping targets), which was designed specifically to practice gait adaptability. The objective {{of this study was to}} determine whether C-Mill gait adaptability training can help to improve gait adjustments and associated attentional demands. Sixteen community-ambulating persons in the chronic stage of stroke (age: 54. 8 +/- 10. 8 years) received ten sessions of C-Mill training within 5 - 6 weeks. Prior to and after the intervention period, participants performed an obstacle-avoidance task with and without a secondary attention-demanding auditory Stroop task to assess their ability to make gait adjustments (i. e., obstacle-avoidance success rates) as well as the associated attentional demands (i. e., Stroop success rates, stratified for <b>pre-crossing,</b> crossing, and post-crossing strides). Obstacle-avoidance success rates improved after C-Mill training from 52. 4 +/- 16. 3 % at pretest to 77. 0 +/- 16. 4 % at posttest (p < 0. 001). This improvement was accompanied by greater Stroop success rates during the obstacle-crossing stride only (pretest: 62. 9 +/- 24. 9 %, posttest: 77. 5 +/- 20. 4 %, p = 0. 006). The observed improvements in obstacle-avoidance success rates and Stroop success rates were strongly correlated (r = 0. 68, p = 0. 015). The ability to make gait adjustments and the associated attentional demands can be successfully targeted in persons with stroke using C-Mill training, which suggests that its underlying assumptions regarding motor control are appropriate. This study lends support and guidance for designing a randomized controlled trial to further examine the potential of C-Mill training for improving safe community ambulation after stroke...|$|R

To investigate this, we compared the development of the corpus callosum in both Slit 2 −/− and Robo 1 −/− mice using diffusion magnetic resonance imaging. This analysis demonstrated similarities in the phenotypes of these mice, but crucially also highlighted subtle differences, particularly with regard to the guidance of post-crossing axons. Analysis of single mutations in Slit family members revealed corpus callosum defects (but not complete agenesis) in 100 % of Slit 2 −/− mice and 30 % of Slit 3 −/− mice, whereas 100 % of Slit 1 −/−; Slit 2 −/− mice displayed complete agenesis of the corpus callosum. These results revealed a role for Slit 1 in corpus callosum development, and demonstrated that Slit 2 was necessary but not sufficient for midline crossing in vivo. However, co-culture experiments utilising Robo 1 −/− tissue versus Slit 2 expressing cell blocks demonstrated that Slit 2 was sufficient for the guidance activity mediated by Robo 1 in <b>pre-crossing</b> neocortical axons.

These findings indicate that Slits regulate callosal development via both classical chemorepulsive mechanisms, and via a novel role in mediating the correct positioning of midline glial populations.

40|$|In {{the modern}} {{telecommunication}} business, {{there is a}} need to provide different Quality-of-Recovery (QoR) and Quality-of-Protection (QoP) classes in order to accommodate as many customers as possible, and to optimize the protection capacity cost. Prevalent protection methods to provide specific QoS related to protection are based on pre-defined shape protection structures (topologies), e. g., p -cycles and p -trees. Although some of these protection patterns are known to provide a good trade-off among the different protection parameters, their shapes can limit their deployment in some specific network conditions, e. g., a constrained link spare capacity budget and traffic distribution. In this thesis, we propose to re-think the design process of protection schemes in survivable WDM networks by adopting a hew design approach where the shapes of the protection structures are decided based on the targeted QoR and QoP guarantees, and not the reverse. We focus on the degree of pre-configuration of the protection topologies, and use fully and partially <b>pre-cross</b> connected p -structures, and dynamically cross connected p -structures. In QoR differentiation, we develop different approaches for pre-configuring the protection capacity in order to strike different balances between the protection cost and the availability requirements in the network; while in the QoP differentiation, we focus on the shaping of the protection structures to provide different grades of protection including single and dual-link failure protection. The new research directions proposed and developed in this thesis are intended to help network operators to effectively support different Quality-of-Recovery and Quality-of-Protection classes. All new ideas have been translated into mathematical models for which we propose practical and efficient design methods in order to optimize the inherent cost to the different designs of protection schemes. Furthermore, we establish a quantitative relation between the degree of pre-configuration of the protection structures and their costs in terms of protection capacity. Our most significant contributions are the design and development of Pre-Configured Protection Structure (p-structure) and Pre-Configured Protection Extended-Tree (p -etree) based schemes. Thanks to the column generation modeling and solution approaches, we propose a new design approach of protection schemes where we deploy just enough protection to provide different quality of recovery and protection classe...|$|R

On the other side of the current sheet the IMF is in opposite direction. The crossing of the current sheet is known as a sector boundary crossing (SBC). The solar wind and IMF properties change signiﬁcantly near the current sheet, and this aﬀects the Earth’s ionosphere. The Super Dual Auroral Radar Network (SuperDARN) high frequency (HF) radar data rates from 2001 - 2011 were examined using several techniques: a superposed epoch analysis, a fast fourier transform (FFT) analysis, and a cross–correlation analysis. Data from multiple instruments were analyzed in this study. These include the solar wind and IMF data from spacecraft, observations of charged particles precipitating into the Earth’s ionosphere, echoes from ground–based SuperDARN radars, and data from gound–based neutron monitors that detect galactic cosmic rays. Solar wind and IMF properties change signiﬁcantly across a sector boundary. An increase in the IMF magnitude of about 30 % occurs on the day of the SBC, and the IMF returns to <b>pre–crossing</b> values over the next two days. There is a decrease in the solar wind speed of about 15 % the day before and the day of the SBC, and the solar wind density doubles at the time of the SBC. The polarity of the SBC does not appear to aﬀect the solar wind and IMF. A peak in the data rate of SuperDARN echoes from both the ionosphere and ground occurs within one day of the SBC, though the variability of these data is quite large. The hemispherical power, which is an estimation of the electron energy ﬂux precipitating into the ionosphere derived from satellite observations, increases following a SBC. Satellite particle data also revealed that the equatorward auroral oval boundary moves equatorward following a SBC. The cosmic ray counts at the Earth’s surface appear to be unaﬀected by the SBC. The solar wind and ionosphere data sets exhibited strong periodicities, and these were harmonics of the synodic rotational period of the Sun (approximately 27 days). Common periodicities observed were 27 days, 13. 5 days, 9 days, 6. 75 days and 5. 4 days. There was a dominant 9 –day periodicity observed in the solar wind and ionospheric data from 2005 – 2008, but was not observed in the solar 10. 7 cm wavelength electromagnetic ﬂux. The 9 -day periodicity in the solar wind during this period has been linked to three persistent features on the Sun that produced corotating high–speed streams, or areas of fast solar wind. The parameters whose change did not depend on the polarity of the SBC had periodicities that were half that of the SBCs. From the cross–correlation analysis some relationships between the data sets became evident. For periods of high solar wind speed there were low SuperDARN data rates, and vice versa. The solar wind speed and hemispherical power were found to be well correlated, while the hemispherical power and the SuperDARN scatter occurrence were found to be anticorrelated. The solar wind changes appear to be aﬀecting the state of the ionosphere, likely through particle precipitation. The SuperDARN scatter occurrence has been shown in past studies to be most greatly aﬀected by changes in the electron density proﬁle of the ionosphere, which can be inﬂuenced by changes in particle precipitation. These results demonstrate a link between the solar wind and the state of the ionosphere...|$|R
