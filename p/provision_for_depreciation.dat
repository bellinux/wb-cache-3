Before 1993, the [...] United States Tax Code did not contain <b>provisions</b> <b>for</b> cost recovery of intangible assets; rather, the intangible assets were depreciated under the current <b>provisions</b> <b>for</b> <b>depreciation</b> of tangible assets, 26 U.S.C. §§ 167 and 168. However, the problem before 1993 was that many intangible assets did not meet the burdensome requirements of §§ 167 and 168 because intangible assets can not necessarily be subject to “wear and tear”. This led to taxpayers having the incentive to ignore any basis in the intangible asset until it was sold.|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{dissertation}} {{is to develop a}} normative capital maintenance model for depreciable assets during a time of inflation. This model is developed on a stipulated physical capital maintenance concept that accumulated depreciation {{at the end of an}} asset 2 ̆ 7 s useful life should be equal to the funds required to replace the asset with a new one of comparable capacity. The soundness of this stipulation is supported by analyses of widely publicized theoretical models and promulgations of standards setting bodies in several countries. A key innovative factor in the model is <b>provision</b> <b>for</b> backlog <b>depreciation</b> as a charge against income. Backlog depreciation is the difference between the depreciation charges that would otherwise be made over the life of the asset and its net replacement cost. The model is developed first for a simple situation where depreciable assets are purchased from a local market. This permits demonstration of the efficacy of backlog depreciation and other somewhat innovative factors. Cognizance is then taken of the following features of the international trade for depreciable assets: (a) the country that is self-sufficient in depreciable assets does not exist in contemporary economic life, (b) different countries experience different inflation rates, and (c) the exchange rates between currencies fluctuate through time. The model is, accordingly, extended to cope with depreciable assets purchased from a foreign country by adding: (1) the price increase of the asset in a foreign market, and (2) the changes in the exchange rates between currencies as two vital dimensions in the model. Each of the following situations involving foreign exchange and acquisition of depreciable assets from another country is analyzed under the extended model: (1) forward exchange rate with fixed or certain prices, (2) forward exchange rate with uncertain changing prices, and (3) current spot trade with uncertain changing prices. ...|$|R

40|$|In {{this paper}} I {{critically}} analyze {{the relationship that}} professors Dornbusch and Fischer establish among the concepts of GNP, NNP and aggregate income. In principle, aggregate income is NNP; indeed, {{the whole point of}} introducing the concept of NNP is to determine what is the income of the economy in the aggregate. The definition of NNP excludes depreciation from aggregate income. But depreciation must be made good, and it must be so out of current production. On the ground that the factors that produce the goods that make up <b>for</b> <b>depreciation</b> must be paid, Dornbusch and Fischer conclude that the value of the portion of current output that makes up <b>for</b> <b>depreciation</b> becomes income in the aggregate. Since it is indubitable that the value of the other portion of output (that which consists of the goods not required to make up <b>for</b> <b>depreciation)</b> becomes income too, then it follows that aggregate income is GNP, not NNP. Then, Dornbusch and Fischer hold contradictory views. The cause, which I attempt at diagnosing in this paper, is a miscomprehension of the nature of capitalistic production. national accounting, accounting identities, capital accounting, national income accounting...|$|R
