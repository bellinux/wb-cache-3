25|$|Many more pitams are {{preserved}} today {{due to an}} auxin discovered by Dr. Eliezer E. Goldschmidt, emeritus professor of horticulture at the Hebrew University. Working with the <b>picloram</b> hormone in a citrus orchard, he unexpectedly discovered {{that some of the}} Valencia oranges found nearby had preserved perfect pitams. Citrus fruits, other than an etrog or citron hybrid like the bergamot, usually do not preserve their pitam. On the occasions that they do, their pitams tend to be dry, sunken and very fragile. In this case the pitams were all fresh and solid just like those of the Moroccan or Greek citron varieties. Experimenting with <b>picloram</b> in a laboratory, Goldschmidt eventually found the correct “dose” to achieve the desired effect is one droplet of the chemical in three million drops of water. This invention was highly appreciated by the religious Jewish community.|$|E
25|$|A {{systemic}} herbicide, for example, glyphosate, triclopyr, or <b>picloram,</b> can {{be applied}} directly on cut stems, which is {{an effective means of}} transporting the herbicide into the kudzu's extensive root system. Herbicides can be used after other methods of control, such as mowing, grazing, or burning, which can allow for an easier application of the chemical to the weakened plants. In large-scale forestry infestations, soil-active herbicides {{have been shown to be}} highly effective.|$|E
25|$|A different, and {{sometimes}} less time consuming {{option for the}} control of kudzu is chemical treatment with herbicides. Some common herbicides used are Tordon and Triclopyr and the most effective are <b>Picloram</b> and Tebuthiuron. However, chemical treatments are expensive, and killing off the plant completely requires large amounts of herbicides (40-80 gallons per acre). Herbicides {{are found to be}} most effective when they are used during the typical growing season, June–October, and when used for successive years. One case study saw a significant decrease in the growth of kudzu after just two years, whereas another study required the use of the herbicide for up to ten years.|$|E
50|$|<b>Picloram</b> is of {{moderate}} toxicity {{to the eyes}} and only mildly toxic on the skin. There is no documented history of human intoxication by <b>picloram</b> so symptoms of acute exposure are difficult to characterize.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Picloram</b> is a {{systemic}} herbicide used for general woody plant control. It also controls {{a wide range}} of broad-leaved weeds, but most grasses are resistant. [...] A chlorinated derivative of picolinic acid, <b>picloram</b> is in the pyridine family of herbicides.|$|E
50|$|<b>Picloram</b> can be sprayed on foliage, {{injected}} into plants, applied to cut surfaces, or {{placed at the}} base of the plant where it will leach to the roots. Once absorbed by the foliage, stem, or roots, <b>picloram</b> is transported throughout the plant.|$|E
50|$|<b>Picloram</b> is {{the most}} {{persistent}} of its family of herbicides. It does not adhere to soil and so may leach to groundwater, and has in fact been detected there. It is degraded in soil and water mainly by microbes. <b>Picloram</b> has very little tendency to accumulate in aquatic life.|$|E
5000|$|Buddenhagen et al. 2004 {{analyzed}} data using {{six different}} herbicide methods from 1999-2002 {{with a different}} trial each year: <b>picloram</b> salt, triclopyr ester, triclopyr salt, glyphosate, diesel fuel, and <b>picloram</b> and metsulfuron. The herbicide was sprayed onto the trees where they were hacked with machetes. In the first trial, triclopyr ester could control C. pubescens with 77% chance of the trees dying. In the second trial, a <b>picloram</b> and metsulfuron solution was 100% successful in concentrations greater than 4% solution. In the third trial, picloram- metsulfuron solution of 10% concentrations or higher was successful in eradicating the tree.|$|E
5000|$|Agent White (Tordon 101): 21.2% (acid weight basis) triisopropanolamine salts of 2,4-D and 5.7% <b>picloram</b> used 1966-71 ...|$|E
50|$|Under {{the brand}} name Tordon 101, Dow AgroSciences has commercialized a similar product {{containing}} a mixture of 2,4-D and <b>picloram.</b>|$|E
5000|$|<b>Picloram,</b> a {{pyridine}} herbicide, {{mainly is used}} {{to control}} unwanted trees in pastures and edges of fields. It is another synthetic auxin.|$|E
50|$|Herbicides {{containing}} <b>Picloram</b> {{are sold}} under {{a variety of}} brand names. Dow Chemicals and now Dow AgroSciences sell herbicides containing it under the brand name Tordon.|$|E
50|$|Gardeners who use dung as {{fertilizer}} {{should check}} {{to make certain that}} the animal source has not grazed on <b>picloram</b> treated hay, as the dung still has broadleaf killing potency.|$|E
50|$|Agent White is a 4:1 {{mixture of}} 2,4-D and <b>picloram.</b> Agent White {{did not contain}} dioxin, which was a {{contaminant}} in some herbicide mixtures. Agent White was a proprietary product of the Dow Chemical Company.|$|E
50|$|Ranchers {{sometimes}} {{attempt to}} control this larkspur with the herbicide tebuthiuron. Glyphosate and <b>picloram</b> have been effective in research trials, but these chemicals kill nontarget plants as well, accelerating the invasion of weeds into the habitat.|$|E
50|$|Enhanced Agent Orange, Orange Plus, or Super Orange (SO), or DOW Herbicide M-3393: {{standardized}} Agent Orange {{mixture of}} 2,4-D and 2,4,5-T {{combined with an}} oil-based mixture of <b>picloram,</b> a proprietary DOW Chemical product called Tordon 101, an ingredient of Agent White.|$|E
50|$|A yellow star-thistle biotype {{resistant}} to <b>picloram</b> {{was discovered in}} a pasture near Dayton, Ohio in 1988. This biotype was determined to have cross resistance to other auxin-like herbicides, especially clopyralid. Resistance was discovered to be conveyed by a single nuclear recessive gene.|$|E
50|$|Two {{herbicides}} {{are approved}} {{for use in}} the United States to exterminate Brazilian pepper: Triclopyr, using the basal bark method; and glyphosate. <b>Picloram</b> can be used if the stump has been freshly cut, {{but this is not the}} preferred nor most effective means of eradication.|$|E
50|$|Chemical control can be {{achieved}} {{with a variety of}} products including: Clopyralid, glyphosate, Diquat, <b>Picloram,</b> and 2, 4-D ester. However, caution must be exercised when using these products, and their use is not always appropriate, especially near water surfaces and other sensitive natural habitats. Check with local, regional, and national regulations directing use.|$|E

50|$|During the Vietnam War, {{a mixture}} of <b>picloram</b> and other {{herbicides}} were combined to make Agent White (commercially available as Tordon 101) and enhanced Agent Orange which was previously conducted by the British military during the Malayan Emergency. Large quantities of these herbicides were sprayed by U.S. forces in areas where they considered its long-term persistence desirable, such as inland forests.|$|E
5000|$|Historical {{records of}} DOW {{chemical}} show that [...] "Super Agent Orange", also called DOW Herbicide M-3393, was Agent Orange that was mixed with <b>picloram.</b> Super Orange {{was known to}} have been tested by representatives from Fort Detrick and DOW chemical in Texas, Puerto Rico, and Hawaii and later in Malaysia in a cooperative project with the International Rubber Research Institute.|$|E
5000|$|Agent White {{was often}} used when Agent Orange was not available, {{including}} {{for several months}} after the use of Agent Orange was halted in April 1970. Approximately [...] of Agent White were used in Vietnam between 1966 and 1971. [...] In addition the US Military tested Agent White, Tordon 101 and <b>picloram</b> in varying concentrations at test sites in the US and Puerto Rico in the 1960s.|$|E
5000|$|Aminopyralid [...] is a {{selective}} herbicide used {{for control of}} broadleaf weeds, especially thistles and clovers. It is in the picolinic acid family of herbicides, which also includes clopyralid, <b>picloram,</b> triclopyr, and several less common herbicides. [...] It was first registered for use in 2005, in the USA under the brand name [...] "Milestone". and in the UK under the brand names Banish, Forefront, Halcyon, Pharaoh, Pro-Banish, Runway, Synero, and Upfront.|$|E

50|$|Gutierrezia microcephala {{is among}} {{one of the}} most {{widespread}} and damaging rangeland weeds, and is an indicator of overgrazed or disturbed rangelands. The herbicides <b>picloram</b> and triclopyr have been found to give satisfactory control, with control lasting at least 5 to 7 years with proper grazing management. Biological control has also been studied, with a combination of an Argentinean root-boring weevil, Heilipodus ventralis, and an Argentinean moth root-borer, Carmenta haematica, found to be an effective method of control.|$|E
50|$|Clopyralid (3,6-dichloro-2-pyridinecarboxylic acid) is a {{selective}} herbicide used {{for control of}} broadleaf weeds, especially thistles and clovers. Clopyralid is in the picolinic acid family of herbicides, which also includes aminopyralid, <b>picloram,</b> triclopyr, and several less common herbicides. For control of Creeping Thistle, Cirsium arvense, a noxious, perennial weed, clopyralid {{is one of the}} few effective herbicides available. It is particularly damaging to peas, tomatoes and sunflowers and can render potatoes, lettuce and spinach inedible. It does not affect members of the family Poaceae (grasses).|$|E
50|$|The {{herbicides}} {{used were}} sprayed {{at up to}} 50 times the concentration than for normal agricultural use. The most common herbicide used was Herbicide Orange, more {{commonly referred to as}} Agent Orange: a fifty-fifty mixture of two herbicides 2,4-D (2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid) and 2,4,5-T (2,4,5-trichlorophenoxyacetic acid) manufactured for the U.S. Department of Defense primarily by Monsanto Corporation and Dow Chemical. The other most common color-coded Ranch Hand herbicides were Agent Blue (cacodylic acid) that was primarily used against food crops, and Agent White (<b>picloram)</b> which was often used when Agent Orange was not available.|$|E
5000|$|There are {{currently}} two strategies for removal of C. pubescens. They include a physical method and a chemical method. The physical method involves manually felling adult trees and fully removing the stumps. Samplings must be {{pulled out of}} the soil. [...] The chemical method uses herbicides diluted in water and sprayed on hack marks on the bark. Buddenhagen et al. tried this at the Galapagos Island National Park using a mixture of <b>picloram</b> and metsulfuron. This technique has been recommended to be performed in Tahiti and Hawaii since it is an invasive there as well.|$|E

5000|$|Most {{herbicides}} {{used for}} controlling Yellow Star-thistle are registered for range lands, right-of-way, and other non-crop areas. Many auxin-like or growth-regulator herbicides {{are used for}} post-emergence control, including 2,4-D, aminopyralid, clopyralid, dicamba, <b>picloram</b> and triclopyr. Alternatively, glyphosate (e.g., Monsanto [...] "Roundup") may be used. Pre-emergence herbicides used for yellow star-thistle control include chlorsulfuron and sulfometuron. Pre-emergence and post-emergence herbicides may be used effectively together to kill growing plants {{as well as any}} new seedlings that may emerge from the copious soil seed bank often produced by yellow starthistle. Controlled burning may also be used in conjunction with clopyralid application as an effective integrated approach to yellow star-thistle management.|$|E
50|$|Chemical control {{involves}} the use of herbicides to control diffuse knapweed. The herbicide Tordon (<b>picloram)</b> is recognized as the most effective, but it is common to use multiple herbicides in order to reduce strain on local grasses. The herbicides 2,4-D, dicamba, and glyphosate are also effective for control. In order to be most effective, it must be applied before the knapweed plants have released their seeds, regardless of which herbicide is used. Ongoing research at the University of Colorado suggests that Tordon treatment does not contribute to long-term reductions of exotic species cover and may contribute to recruitment of other invasive species, such as redstem filaree and Japanese brome, which quickly take the place of herbicide-treated diffuse knapweed.|$|E
50|$|Although Hypericum perforatum {{is grown}} commercially {{in some regions}} of south east Europe, it is listed as a noxious weed in more than twenty {{countries}} and has introduced populations in South and North America, India, New Zealand, Australia, and South Africa. In pastures, St John's wort acts as both a toxic and invasive weed. It replaces native plant communities and forage vegetation {{to the extent of}} making productive land nonviable or becoming an invasive species in natural habitats and ecosystems. Ingestion by livestock such as horses, sheep, and cattle can cause photosensitization, central nervous system depression, spontaneous abortion or death. Effective herbicides for control of Hypericum include 2,4-D, <b>picloram,</b> and glyphosate. In western North America three beetles Chrysolina quadrigemina, Chrysolina hyperici and Agrilus hyperici have been introduced as biocontrol agents.|$|E
5000|$|Herbicide {{manufacturers}} have at times made false or misleading {{claims about the}} safety of their products. Chemical manufacturer Monsanto Company agreed to change its advertising after pressure from New York attorney general Dennis Vacco; Vacco complained about misleading claims that its spray-on glyphosate-based herbicides, including Roundup, were safer than table salt and [...] "practically non-toxic" [...] to mammals, birds, and fish (though proof that this was ever said is hard to find). Roundup is toxic and has resulted in death after being ingested in quantities ranging from 85 to 200 ml, although it has also been ingested in quantities as large as 500 ml with only mild or moderate symptoms. The manufacturer of Tordon 101 (Dow AgroSciences, owned by the Dow Chemical Company) has claimed Tordon 101 has no effects on animals and insects, in spite of evidence of strong carcinogenic activity of the active ingredient <b>Picloram</b> in studies on rats.|$|E
50|$|Because {{of their}} shorter life cycle, cotton thistle plants can be {{effectively}} treated with herbicides. All herbicide treatments {{should be applied}} at the rosette stage of the plant. Generally, herbicide applications would be in early spring or autumn. One of the primary difficulties in chemical control of cotton thistles is their ability to germinate nearly year round. From autumn to spring a range of plant sizes can be found which may result in variable success from chemical control. Herbicides are very effective on seedlings and young rosettes, but control becomes more variable with increasing plant age. Onopordum spp. seeds may persist for several years in the soil. Buried seed may persist for up to twenty years, and reinfestation is likely without yearly management. Therefore, several years of re-treatment may be necessary. <b>Picloram,</b> dicamba, 2,4-D, dicamba + 2,4,-D, and metsulfuron are effective for controlling Cotton Thistle. Clopyralid is more selective for controlling plants in the Asteraceae family, but will also injure or kill legumes.|$|E
5000|$|In {{addition}} to testing {{and using the}} herbicides in Vietnam, Laos and Cambodia, the US military also tested the [...] "Rainbow Herbicides" [...] and many other chemical defoliants and herbicides in the US, Canada, Puerto Rico, Korea, India, and Thailand from the mid-1940s to the late 1960s. Herbicide persistence studies of Agents Orange and White were conducted in the Philippines. [...] The Philippine herbicide test program which was conducted {{in cooperation with the}} University of the Philippines, College of Forestry and was also described in a 1969 issue of The Philippine Collegian, the college's newspaper. Super or enhanced Agent Orange was tested by representatives from Fort Detrick and Dow chemical in Texas, Puerto Rico, and Hawaii and later in Malaysia in a cooperative project with the International Rubber Research Institute. [...] <b>Picloram</b> in Agent White and Super-Orange was contaminated by Hexachlorobenzene (HCB) a dioxin-like carcinogen. The Canadian government also tested these herbicides and used them to clear vegetation for artillery training.|$|E
