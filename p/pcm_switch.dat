5000|$|All PowerConnect M-series ("PCM") {{switches}} are multi-layer switches thus offering both layer 2 (Ethernet) {{options as}} well as layer 3 or IP routing options.Depending on the model the switches offer internally 1Gbit/s or 10Gbit/s interfaces towards the blades in the chassis. The PowerConnect M series with [...] "-k" [...] in the model-name offer 10Gb internal connections using the 10GBASE-KR standard. The external interfaces are mainly meant {{to be used as}} uplinks or stacking-interfaces but {{can also be used to}} connect non-blade servers to the network.On the link-level <b>PCM</b> <b>switches</b> support link aggregation: bot static LAG's {{as well as}} LACP. As all PowerConnect switches the switches are running RSTP as Spanning Tree Protocol, but it is also possible to run MSTP or Multiple Spanning Tree. The internal ports towards the blades are by default set as edge or [...] "portfast" [...] ports. Another feature is to use link-dependency. You can, for example, configure the switch that all internal ports to the blades are shut down when the switch gets isolated because it loses its uplink to the rest of the network.All <b>PCM</b> <b>switches</b> can be configured as pure layer-2 switches or they can be configured to do all routing: both routing between the configured VLAN's as external routing. Besides static routes the switches also support OSPF and RIP routing. When using the switch as routing switch you need to configure vlan interfaces and assign an IP address to that vlan interface: it is not possible to assign an IP address directly to a physical interface.|$|R

40|$|Physics of {{amorphous}} chalcogenides {{sets the}} scaling potentials of PCM elements and their perspectives in multi-bit storage. Carrier transport, threshold switching, structural relaxation and crystallization processes have key importance from the application standpoint. They also represent peculiar effects which have always attracted interest and speculations by decades. The paper reviews experimental and modeling analysis of threshold voltage and resistance transients in amorphous chalcogenides. Both variables show time evolutions {{characterized by a}} fast component in the 10 ’s of ns range, called recovery, followed by a slower drift on longer time scales, with a gradual increase of the amorphous resistivity and activation energy. This latter dependence, ascribed to structural relaxations (SR) in the amorphous, proceeds until crystallization takes place. Although these processes appear rather different, the Poole Frenkel model of carrier conduction in disordered materials is remarkably able to link consistently them all, explaining the kinetics over 17 decades of time. Moreover, the Arrhenius dependence of SR shows that the exponential pre-factor of the process obeys a Meyer–Neldel rule, pointing to many-body thermal excitations as responsible for the anomalous large values of the crystallization time pre-factor observed in chalcogenide glasses.

40|$|The {{remarkable}} {{ability of}} phase change materials (<b>PCM)</b> to <b>switch</b> between amorphous and crystalline states on a nanosecond time scale could provide {{new opportunities for}} graphene engineering. We have used density functional calculations to investigate the structures and electronic properties of heterostructures of thin amorphous and crystalline films of the PCM GeTe (16 Å thick) and Ge 2 Sb 2 Te 5 (20 Å) between graphene layers. The interaction between graphene and PCM is very weak, charge transfer is negligible, and the structures of the chalcogenide films differ little from those of bulk phases. A crystalline GeTe (111) layer induces a band gap opening of 80 meV at the Dirac point. This effect is absent for the amorphous film, but the Fermi energy shifts down along the Dirac cone by − 60 meV. Ge 2 Sb 2 Te 5 shows similar features, although inherent disorder in the crystalline rocksalt structure reduces the contrast in band structure from that in the amorphous structure. These features originate in charge polarization within the crystalline films, which show electromechanical response (piezoelectricity) upon compression, and show that the electronic properties of graphene structures can be tuned by inducing ultrafast structural transitions within the chalcogenide layers. Graphene {{can also be used}} to manipulate the structural state of the PCM layer and its electronic and optical properties...|$|R

Important studies have focused on its scalability, switching speed, endurance, and new materials. Still, reliability issues and inconsistent <b>switching</b> in <b>PCM</b> devices motivate the need to further study its fundamental properties. However, many investigations treat PCM cells as black boxes; nanostructural changes inside the devices remain hidden. Here, using in situ transmission electron microscopy, we observe real-time nanostructural changes in lateral Ge 2 Sb 2 Te 5 (GST) <b>PCM</b> bridges during <b>switching.</b> We find that PCM devices with similar resistances can exhibit distinct threshold switching behaviors due to the different initial distribution of nanocrystalline and amorphous domains, explaining variability of <b>switching</b> behaviors of <b>PCM</b> cells in the literature. Our findings show a direct correlation between nanostructure and switching behavior, providing important guidelines in the design and operation of future PCM devices with improved endurance and lower variability. © 2011 American Chemical Society...|$|R
40|$|Current {{large scale}} {{implementations}} of deep learning and data mining require thousands of processors, {{massive amounts of}} off-chip memory, and consume gigajoules of energy. Emerging memory technologies such as nanoscale two-terminal resistive switching memory devices offer a compact, scalable and low power alternative that permits on-chip co-located processing and memory in fine-grain distributed parallel architecture. Here we report first use of resistive switching memory devices for implementing and training a Restricted Boltzmann Machine (RBM), a generative probabilistic graphical model as a key component for unsupervised learning in deep networks. We experimentally demonstrate a 45 -synapse RBM realized with 90 resistive switching phase change memory (PCM) elements trained with a bio-inspired variant of the Contrastive Divergence (CD) algorithm, implementing Hebbian and anti-Hebbian weight updates. The resistive PCM devices show a two-fold to ten-fold reduction in error rate in a missing pixel pattern completion task trained over 30 epochs, compared to untrained case. Measured programming energy consumption is 6. 1 nJ per epoch with the resistive <b>switching</b> <b>PCM</b> devices, a factor of ~ 150 times lower than conventional processor-memory systems. We analyze and discuss the dependence of learning performance on cycle-to-cycle variations as well as number of gradual levels in the PCM analog memory devices.

40|$|The {{nanostructure}} of micrometer sized domains (bits) {{in phase}} change materials (<b>PCM)</b> that undergo <b>switching</b> between amorphous and crystalline phases {{plays a key}} role in the performance of optical PCM based memories. Here we explore the dynamics of such phase transitions by mapping PCM nanostructures in three dimensions with nanoscale resolution by combining precision Ar-ion beam cross sectional polishing and nanomechanical Ultrasonic Force Microscopy (UFM) mapping. Surface and bulk phase changes of laser written sub-m to m sized amorphous-to-crystalline (SET) and crystalline-to- amorphous (RESET) bits in chalcogenide Ge 2 Sb 2 Te 5 PCM are observed with 10 - 20 nm lateral and 4 nm depth resolution. UFM mapping shows that the Young’s moduli of crystalline SET bits exceed the moduli of amorphous areas by 11 ± 2 %, with crystalline content extending from a few nm to 50 nm in depth depending on the energy of switching pulses. The RESET bits written with 50 ps pulses reveal shallower depth penetration, and show 30 - 50 nm lateral and few nm vertical “wave” like topography that is anti-correlated with the elastic modulus distribution. Reverse switching of amorphous RESET bits results in full recovery of subsurface nanomechanical properties, accompanied with only partial topography recovery resulting in surface corrugations attributed to quenching. This precision sectioning and nanomechanical mapping approach could be applicable to a wide range of amorphous, nanocrystalline and glass forming materials for 3 -dimensional nanomechanical mapping of amorphous-crystalline transitions...|$|R
40|$|In this thesis, the {{electrical}} transport properties of crystalline phase change materials are discussed. Phase change materials (PCM) are a special class of semiconducting and metallic thin film alloys, typically {{with a high}} amount of the group five element antimony or the group six element tellurium, such as Ge 2 Sb 2 Te 5. The unique property portfolio of this material class makes it suitable for memory applications. <b>PCMs</b> reveal fast <b>switching</b> between two stable room-temperature phases (amorphous and crystalline) realized by optical laser or electrical current pulses in memory devices. Additionally, a pronounced property contrast in form of optical reflectivity and electrical conductivity between the amorphous and cyrstalline phase is the characteristic fingerprint of PCMs. The emerging electrical solid state memory PCRAM is a very promising candidate to replace Flash memory {{in the near future}} or to even become a universal memory, which is non-volatile and shows the speed and cyclability of DRAM. One of the main technological challenges is the switching process into the amorphous state, which is the most power demanding step. In order to reduce the switching power, the crystalline resistivity needs to be increased at a given voltage. Thus understanding and tayloring of this property is mandatory. In this work, first the technological relevance, i. e. optical and electrical memory concepts based on PCMs are introduced (chapter 2. 1). Subsequently a description of the physical properties of PCMs in four categories is given. Namely, structure (section 2. 2. 1), kinetics (section 2. 2. 2), optical properties (section 2. 2. 3) and electrical properties (section 2. 2. 4) are discussed. In chapter 2. 3 important recent developments such as the identfication of resonant bonding in crystalline PCMs and a property predicting coordination scheme are briefly reviewed. Chapter 3 deals with the theoretical background of electrical transport, while chapter 4 introduces the experimental techniques: Sputtering, XRR, XRD, DSC, thermal annealing, profilometry, ellipsometry, FTIR spectroscopy, van der Pauw, Hall, and phase change optical and electrical switching techniques which are used to obtain the results in chapter 5. The latter chapter is split into two parts. In the first one the material class of doped Sb 2 Te is investigated with respect to structural, kinetic, optical and electrical properties. The second part covers the study of the systematic variation of the resistivity of pseudo-binary GeTe-Sb 2 Te 3 alloys upon thermal annealing. This variation is discussed in the framework of an insulator to metal transition with the help of results from a combined van der Pauw, XRD, Hall, STM and FTIR study...|$|R
40|$|The {{continued}} {{dominance of}} floating gate technology as the premier non-volatile memory (NVM) technology {{is expected to}} hit a roadblock due to issues associated with its inability {{to catch up with}} CMOS scaling. The uncertain future of floating gate memory has led to a host of unorthodox NVM technologies to surface as potential heirs. Among the mix is phase change memory (PCM), which is a non-volatile, resistance variable, memory technology wherein the state of the memory bit is defined by the resistance of the memory material. This research study examines novel, bilayer chalcogenide based materials composed of Ge-chalcogenide (GeTe or Ge 2 Se 3) and Sn-chalcogenide (SnTe or SnSe) for phase change memory applications and explores their integration with CMOS technology. By using a layered arrangement, it is possible to induce phase change response in materials, which normally do not exhibit such behavior, and thus form new materials which may have lower threshold voltage and programming current requirements. Also, through the incorporation of a metal containing layer, the phase transition characteristics of the memory layer can be tailored in order to obtain in-situ, a material with optimized phase change properties. Using X-ray diffraction (XRD) and time resolved XRD, it has been demonstrated that stacked phase change memory films exhibit both structural and compositional dependency with annealing temperature. The outcome of the structural transformation of the bottom layer, is an annealing temperature dependent residual stress. By the incorporation of a Sn layer, the phase transition characteristics of Ge-chalcogenide thin films can be tuned. Clear evidence of thermally induced Ge, Sn and chalcogen inter-diffusion, has been discerned via transmission electron microscopy and parallel electron energy loss spectroscopy. The presence of Al 2 O 3 as capping layer has been found to mitigate volatilization and metallic Sn phase separation at high temperatures. Two terminal PCM cells employing these bilayers have been designed, fabricated and tested. All devices exhibit threshold switching and memory switching behavior. By the application of suitable voltage programming pulses, RESET state switching can be accomplished in these devices, thus demonstrating single bit memory functionality. A process for integrating bilayer PCM technology with 2 µm CMOS has been designed and developed. The baseline RIT CMOS process has been modified to incorporate 12 levels of photolithography, 3 levels of metal and the addition of PCM as a BEOL process. On electrical testing, NMOS connected <b>PCM</b> devices exhibit <b>switching</b> behavior. The effect of the state (SET/RESET) of the series connected PCM cell on the drain current of the NMOS has also been investigated. It is determined that threshold <b>switching</b> of the <b>PCM</b> cell is essential in order to observe any change in MOS drain current with variation in drain voltage. Thus, successful integration of bilayer PCM with CMOS has been demonstrated...|$|R
40|$|Phase-change {{materials}} (PCMs) {{are one of}} {{the most}} promising candidates for emerging storage class memory (SCM) technology. SCMs aim at bridging the cost-performance gap between nowadays established memory solutions (fast, but volatile, e. g. DRAM) and data storage technologies (slow, but non-volatile, e. g. FLASH). The application potential of PCMs rests on a high endurance, high bit density (multi-level cell capability) and programming times of the order of nanoseconds. In conventional PCM technology, the binary information is encoded by two different solid states: a crystalline (SET state) and an amorphous phase (RESET state) which differ by orders of magnitude in their electrical resistance. The phase transition is induced thermally allowing for crystallization (SET operation) or melt-quenching (RESET operation) and thereby amorphization. Only recently, superior switching properties have been reported for device-integrated GeTe/Sb 2 Te 3 superlattice (SL) PCMs that outperform GeTe-Sb 2 Te 3 alloys in terms of programming time, power consumption and endurance. In difference to conventional PCM technology, the contrast between SET and RESET is argued to stem from two crystalline states that differ in their local atomic arrangement at the GeTe/Sb 2 Te 3 interface. The switching between these two atomic configurations is argued to be electric-field-driven, rather than thermally induced as in conventional <b>PCMs.</b> This novel <b>switching</b> mechanism has been ascribed for the improved device performance. At present, the superior switching behavior is confirmed in numerous publications, yet the underlying switching mechanism is under strong debate. This thesis provides insights into the structure, growth, thermal stability and thermal conductivity of GeTe/Sb 2 Te 3 superlattices (chalcogenide superlattice: CSL). Highly textured CSLs were grown by direct-current magnetron sputter deposition. Their structural quality is mirrored in prominent SL X-ray diffraction features such as SL Bragg peaks and equally spaced satellites. CSLs have been prepared with bilayer thicknesses Λ as small as Λ= 34 Å. Yet, intermixing was observed at such small values of Λ giving rise to local GeTe-Sb 2 Te 3 alloying at the interface. This tendency for intermixing was also found in case of post-deposition annealing of the CSLs. The SL stacking is unaffected by any thermal treatment at temperatures up to 300 °C. At higher temperatures, the artificial stacking dissolves into a stable GeTe-Sb 2 Te 3 compound. At the beginning of this thesis, no data on the thermal conductivity κ was available for GeTe/Sb 2 Te 3 SL. Yet, κ is a parameter that crucially determines the device performance in conventional PCM technology. Therefore, the thermal conductivity of CSLs with different values of Λ was measured. It was found that κ is significantly reduced compared to GeTe and Sb 2 Te 3, respectively. Moreover, κ develops a minimum in dependence of Λ which approaches values of amorphous PCMs. Such a minimum is a fingerprint of SL structures with high interface quality. The present switching models consider neither the local intermixing at the GeTe/Sb 2 Te 3 interface, nor the strikingly small thermal conductivity κ of CSLs. This thesis hence provides valuable results that may help to unravel the cause for the improved device performance of CSLs...|$|R
