2500|$|In November 2014, the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey {{released}} a Tier 1 Draft Environmental Impact Statement (DEIS) for its Cross Harbor Freight Program.

On September 25, 2015 the Tier 1 Final Environmental Impact Statement was released, which narrowed the alternatives to two, an enhanced railcar float operation and a basic rail tunnel, both between New Jersey and Brooklyn.

5000|$|The {{validity}} of PLO's <b>Phased</b> <b>Plan</b> nowadays is unclear. PLO's <b>Phased</b> <b>Plan</b> was never officially canceled, but in general, the Palestinian leadership has stopped referring to {{it since the}} late 1980s. Recently, however, several statements made by PLO officials on the subject indicate that the <b>Phased</b> <b>Plan</b> has not been abandoned - most notably the statement of the PLO ambassador to Lebanon which stated {{in an interview that}} the [...] "two-state solution will lead to the collapse of Israel".|$|E

5000|$|The PLO's <b>Phased</b> <b>Plan</b> did not {{stipulate}} clear {{operational measures}} and only repeated {{the principles of}} the policies which the Palestinian National Council had accepted in the past: the denial of United Nations Security Council Resolution 242 (adopted after the Six Day War), the denial of the existence of the State of Israel and the demand of the return of all Palestinian refugees to their original homes and the establishment of an Arab-Palestinian state in the entire region of Palestine within the pre-1948 borders. The innovation of PLO's <b>Phased</b> <b>Plan</b> was in the assertion that each step which would lead to the fulfillment of these goals would be a worthy step. It also states that any territory, from the region of Palestine, which would be transferred to an Arab rule should be transferred to Palestinian control, also if the takeover of other territories would be delayed as a result. Some interpret these series of decisions, as a realization of the council in the fact that it can not fulfill all its goals at once, but rather it {{would be able to do}} so in gradual small steps, and as a recognition of the council in the possibility of initiating political and diplomatic measures and not just an [...] "armed struggle" [...] (although PLO's <b>Phased</b> <b>Plan</b> does not consist of a denial of the use of an armed struggle).|$|E

50|$|Nowadays {{there is}} a debate within the Israeli public and {{leadership}} on whether the PLO's <b>Phased</b> <b>Plan</b> still represent the thinking patterns and official policy of certain factions within the Palestinian leadership and of the Palestinian people and whether the Palestinian public and leadership still aim to ultimately take control over the entire region of Palestine or do Palestinian territorial claims apply only to the West Bank (including East Jerusalem) and the Gaza Strip.|$|E
50|$|A staged plan {{agreed in}} March 2003 by the Prussia Columns Working Group envisaged the {{following}} steps: First the pedestals {{of the two}} monuments {{should be returned to}} their rightful place, then the column drums and finally the statues by 2010. Because parts of the pedestals were and are still dotted randomly around the site of the monument in Neukamp (as at January 2007). The idea behind this <b>phased</b> <b>plan</b> was and is that a beginning must be made more visible to attract sponsors and increase donations. In seeking sponsors for this project, the President of the County Council even wrote, for example, to the royal houses of Denmark and Sweden.|$|E

50|$|The United States {{missile defense}} complex in Poland, {{also called the}} European Interceptor Site (EIS), was a planned American missile defense base. It was {{intended}} to contain 10 silo-based interceptors: two-stage versions of the existing three-stage Ground Based Interceptors with Exoatmospheric Kill Vehicles that had a closing speed of about 7 km/s. The first planned complex was to be located near Redzikowo, Poland, forming a Ground-Based Midcourse Defense system {{in conjunction with a}} U.S. narrow-beam midcourse tracking and discrimination radar system located in Brdy, Czech Republic. EIS was cancelled in 2009 and subsequently replaced with a <b>phased</b> <b>plan</b> - the Aegis Ballistic Missile Defense System, which will include SM-3 Block IIA interceptors to be positioned in Poland from 2018.|$|E
5000|$|On 7 March 2007, Chávez {{presented}} a <b>phased</b> <b>plan</b> for founding the new party until November 2007.

In his opinion, those parties were near to be on the opposition and they should choose wisely, between going [...] "in silence, hugging us or throwing stones".

50|$|As {{corporations}} add {{the necessary}} functions, several issues arise. First {{is the risk}} that the functions overlap, evolve into silos, create misunderstanding internally and externally and act at cross purposes. Second is the opportunity for enhanced impact through synergy between these functions. Risk managers, compliance officers and business performance managers often need to manage change in order to achieve their objectives. Without a sponsor at top management level their efforts may fail when the magnitude of resistance to change overwhelms their limited powers of influence. Third, the serial introduction of new processes may simply require more attention, time and enthusiasm than line managers can realistically offer. A single <b>phased</b> <b>plan</b> for enabling good governance could mitigate the risks and preempt any wasteful expenditure. Last, the complexity of the interactions between the different functions compounded by the infancy of the new disciplines may require continuous conceptual interpretation for top management and the board.|$|E

The Health and Safety File must be produced by the CDM coordinator on notifiable projects. Existing Health and Safety files must be modified files for structures undergoing modifications.
