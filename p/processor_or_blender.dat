50|$|Emulsified {{sausages}} {{are cooked}} sausages {{with a very}} fine texture, using the combination of pork, beef, or poultry with fat, salt, cure, flavorings, and water. These ingredients are emulsified at high speed in a food <b>processor</b> <b>or</b> <b>blender.</b> During this process, the salt dissolves the muscle proteins, which helps to suspend the fat molecules. Temperature {{is an important part}} of the process: if the temperature rises above 60°F (16°C) for pork or 70°F (21°C) for beef, the emulsion will not hold and fat will leak from the sausage during the cooking process.|$|E
5000|$|The {{shortening}} method, {{also known}} as the biscuit method, is used for biscuits and scones. This method cuts solid fat (whether lard, butter, or vegetable shortening) into flour and other dry ingredients using a food <b>processor,</b> pastry <b>blender,</b> <b>or</b> two hand-held forks. The layering from this process gives rise and adds flakiness as the folds of fat melt during baking. This technique is said to produce [...] "shortened" [...] cakes and breads, {{regardless of whether or not}} the chosen fat is vegetable shortening.|$|R

The various ingredients can be mixed or puréed together using a food <b>processor,</b> a <b>blender,</b> <b>or</b> by hand. Bean dip is sometimes topped with shredded cheese and garnished with ingredients such as chopped cilantro, chopped green onion, chopped fresh or dried parsley and lime zest, among others.|$|R

50|$|Kue satu or kue koya {{is one of}} the {{simplest}} and easiest kue kering (traditional cookie) in Indonesian cuisine. It employed only four ingredients; mung beans, powdered sugar, vanilla essence, and water. The mung beans are being sautéed without oil until its green skin are cracked. Peeled and remove the skin, and mashed or ground the mung beans manually using mortar and pestle, or using electrical food <b>processor</b> <b>or</b> <b>blender.</b> The powdered mung beans is then mixed with powdered sugar, vanilla essence, and small amount of water to create the dough. The dough then placed into small cookie molds and then bake them in the oven of 150 degree Celsius heat. Then the baked cookies are aired and sun-dried for several hours before place them in air-tight glass or plastic cookie jar.|$|E
40|$|Die Arbeit behandelt den Einfluss der Amerikanisierung und Verwestlichung auf den Bereich des Kochens, der Küchenausstattung, des Lebensmittelkonsums und des -einkaufs in der Zeit von 1945 bis 1970. Schon bevor sie zur Weltmacht aufstiegen, waren die USA ein Pionier auf dem Gebiet der Konsum-Moderne. Vor allem während der zehnjährigen Besatzungszeit kamen die Österreicher/innen mit dem ‚American Way of Life‘ in Kontakt. Obwohl eine ambivalente Stimmung gegenüber dem Amerikanischen bestand, überwogen Assoziationen mit materiellem Wohlstand, Unabhängigkeit und neuen technischen Errungenschaften, die das Leben vereinfachten. Der Marshallplan nährte nicht nur die ohnehin schon starke anti-kommunistische Einstellung in Österreich, er festigte die ökonomische und politische Integration des Landes in den Westen, wodurch die Österreicher/innen diesem auch kulturell näher kamen. Im Ernährungsbereich stand „amerikanisch“ zunächst für andersartig und modern, zunehmend aber auch für rasch zubereitet, effizient und gesund. Auch in der Küchenausstattung erlangten rationelle Kriterien zunehmende Bedeutung, sodass der Konsum moderner Haushaltsgeräte in den 60 ern deutlich anstieg. Schließlich adaptierte man auch das Einkaufssystem an das amerikanische Modell der Selbstbedienung, da es ökonomische Vorteile gegenüber dem altbekannten Greißler bot. Der Einfluss Amerikas bzw. des Westens zeigte sich auch in der Werbung. Die Analyse von 28 ausgewählten Plakatwerbungen aus dem behandelten Zeitraum ergab, dass Anglizismen neben der Betonung von Modernität, Zeit- und Aufwandsersparnis zu den am häufigsten vorkommenden Merkmalen zählten. Als weitere Anzeichen der Amerikanisierung/Verwestlichung konnten der Ausdruck von Wohlstand, Exotik (besonders in Getränkewerbungen), technischer Fortschritt und moderne Marketingstrategien beobachtet werden, wohingegen die oft mit Amerika assoziierte Lockerheit, Freiheit und Unabhängigkeit kaum inkludiert wurden. This diploma thesis {{examines}} the western – {{in particular the}} American – influence on the area of cooking and food consumption in Austria from 1945 to 1970. The system of mass production and consumption was established in Austria a few decades later than in the US, {{which is why the}} United States were often seen as a role model in terms of efficiency, marketing and technical progress. After the crisis caused by World War 2 America represented modernity in all respects. The Austrians welcomed the American consumption style as it promised them material wealth, freedom, peace and a better life. They came in contact with the American way of life mainly through the GIs during the period of occupation from 1945 to 1955 as well as through the media. Austria’s political and economic integration into the western world has contributed significantly to the social and cultural changes that took place during the postwar period. Whereas in the forties and early fifties, American food was perceived as novel and modern, this notion was gradually extended to rapidly and easily prepared and healthy. The generally increasing importance of speed and rationality also became visible in the household through kitchen appliances and electrical devices such as refrigerator, food <b>processor</b> <b>or</b> <b>blender,</b> which made cooking and storing a lot easier. Another field that was influenced was the system of shopping. The model of self-service facilitated grocery shopping on the grounds that most products were available at the same place. Additionally, this system proved to be economically beneficial since shop assistants who served customers were no longer necessary. In the later chapters billboards from the postwar period are analyzed in order to identify signs of the American or western influence. Many of the advertisements show the linguistic influence by using Anglicisms, whereas others clearly emphasize the rapid and convenient cooking of the products. Also the aspects of modernity and technical progress are stressed in some advertisements...|$|E
