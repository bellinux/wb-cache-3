2500|$|The {{fire started}} just seconds into the band's opening song, their 1991 Billboard Mainstream Rock hit [...] "Desert Moon", when {{pyrotechnics}} {{set off by}} tour manager Daniel Biechele ignited flammable acoustic foam {{on both sides and}} the top centre of the drummer's alcove {{at the back of the}} stage. The pyrotechnics were gerbs, cylindrical devices that produce a controlled spray of sparks. Biechele used three gerbs set to spray sparks [...] for 15 seconds. Two gerbs were at 45-degree angles, with the middle one pointing straight up. The flanking gerbs became the principal cause of the fire. The foam was installed in two layers, with highly flammable urethane foam above <b>polyethylene</b> <b>foam,</b> the latter being difficult to ignite but releasing much more heat once ignited by the less dense urethane. Burning polyurethane foam instantly develops opaque, aggressive, dark smoke along with deadly carbon monoxide and hydrogen cyanide gas when burning. Inhaling this smoke only 2-3 times would cause rapid loss of consciousness and eventually, death by internal suffocation.|$|E

40|$|This {{paper is}} {{concerned}} with the energy-absorption behaviour of cellular textile composites. Three grid-domed textile composites fabricated from knitted fabrics were studied under quasi-static compression and impact condition. In both cases, the energy-absorbing capacity of the samples was measured. Comparison was made between the grid-domed composites, a composite comprising a non-woven fabric preform, polyester and <b>polyethylene</b> <b>foams.</b> The grid-domed composites exhibiting plastic collapses showed high levels of optimum specific energy-absorbing capacity at higher pressure levels than those of polyester and <b>polyethylene</b> <b>foams.</b> In addition, increases in strain rate or relative density had a positive effect on the energy-absorption capacity. The major energy-absorption mechanism of the grid-domed composite samples was identified as the plastic collapse of both the spherical cap and the truncated conical shell. Accordingly, a three-stage theoretical model is proposed; and the prediction of the energy-absorbing capacity of these cellular textile composites is in good agreement with experimental results.

40|$|AbstractA simple image {{enhancement}} technique was proposed {{to observe and}} analyze cell structure of <b>polyethylene</b> <b>foams</b> using optical microscopy. Two coating techniques were implemented in this study; one being a simple black soot coating and the other utilized a commercial Au/Pd coating that is commonly used for Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) observation. The former technique was forwarded after considering that when the sample is white in color, usually microscopic observation via optical microscopy is quite difficult. Polarized light was also applied as another supporting tool to counter the light reflectance problem occurred in the observed white sample. Good quality digital images were successfully produced using both coating techniques {{with the assistance of}} polarized light projected via the optical microscope. It was proven that the sample with the proposed black soot coating is able to give high quality image with high level of contrast. The results showed that images with clear cell boundaries were obtained and these images were comparable or much better than those obtained with the Au/Pd coating technique. Finally, images with improved contrast were inverted using an image analysis procedure which allows better determination of foam cell features in <b>polyethylene</b> <b>foams.</b> The use of the proposed technique as supplementary device for real-time microscopic observation during foam compression was also proven to be a success...|$|R

The moduli and tensile yield stresses of highly oriented polymer films were measured to provide data for modelling, {{and the amount of}} polymer in the foam cell faces found to be high. Tensile face strains are predicted to reach 40 % of the foam compressive strain. The predicted Youngs moduli are slightly low, because compressive face stresses are ignored, but Poissons ratio is correctly predicted. The compressive foam yield stress is predicted to depend on tensile yielding of the cell faces. Predicted values are close to experimental values for <b>polyethylene</b> <b>foams,</b> but half those of polystyrene extruded foams.

The tests revealed that the desired low surface resistance and required low static decay time could be achieved with all the antistatic agents under test. Moreover, the additives with amina (Atmer 7105 and 7325) as an active agent showed slightly better antistatic performance than the one with the ionic agent (Atmer 190).

40|$|In the {{production}} of <b>polyethylene</b> <b>foams</b> by extrusion with alkanes as a blowing agent, {{significant changes in the}} dimensions of extruded products are encountered. The dimensional stability of a foam with a structure of closed cells is improved by blending the polymer with small amounts of a low molecular weight additive. It is believed that the dimensional stability is related to the ratio of the blowing agent to air permeability. It is shown in this article that the additive reduces the blowing agent permeability more than it does the air permeability only if the additive has migrated {{to the surface of the}} polymer. The presence of the additive at the polymer surface has been confirmed by electron microscopy and infrared spectroscopy. The (partially) ordening of the additive at the surface, as shown with wide-angle X-ray diffraction, explains the low gas permeabilities of the additive compared to the corresponding permeabilities of polyethylene. © 1997 John Wiley & Sons, Inc...|$|R

The materials were produced using a modified compression moulding technique that allows and independent control of density and cell size. The materials had a relative density between 0. 27 and 0. 92, an homogeneous and multi-structured cellular structure with dense skin and foamed core and cell sizes in the range 30 to 100 microns. The YoungŽs modulus was reduced when density did. For relative densities higher than 0. 7, the reduced Young¿s modulus of the foams was {{higher than that of}} the solid. In addition, it has been proved that variations in the cell size at constant density did not influence the Young¿s modulus. The advantages of using these materials for the production of plastic pipes have been analysed.

40|$|The {{response}} of closed-cell <b>polyethylene</b> <b>foams</b> to blast loading was studied by systematically exposing foam sheets to blasts from explosive charges. It {{has been found}} that depending on the blast strength, foam type, and foam sample thickness, that the transmitted pressure felt beneath the foam could be either attenuated or amplified. A distinctive feature of the foams' response, when impacted by a relatively strong blast, is a pressure plateau. To compliment the experiments, a model of the foams under blast loading has been developed. This was achieved by first characterizing the stress-strain behavior of the foams over a range of strain rates, using both a hydraulic testing machine and a drop weight impact tester. The results of this testing was then used to create a rate-dependent constitutive model of the foams. In order to simulate blast loading, the model was implemented into a finite difference wave propagation code. Simulations show many of the features apparent in the experiments, including the amplification and attenuation of the transmitted pressures and the observed pressure plateau...|$|R

40|$|Low density, {{closed cell}} <b>polyethylene</b> <b>foams</b> show severe post-extrusion {{collapse}} when isobutane or carbon dioxide {{are used as}} physical blowing agents. This dimensional instability {{is caused by the}} fact that the blowing agent permeates faster out of the foam than the air permeates into the foam. Permeation experiments on polyethylene films showed that this is an intrinsic property of polyethylene: for both isobutane and carbon dioxide the permeability is 12 to 15 times larger than the air permeability. However, it was observed that the addition of small amounts (< 2 wt. %) of certain additives, such as stearyl stearamide or glycerol monostearate, could improve the dimensional stability of isobutane blown foams considerably. The working mechanism of these additives was found to be a surface effect. The additive forms a (partially) crystalline surface layer, which decreases the isobutane permeability to a larger extent than the air permeability. It reduces the isobutane to air selectivity from about 15 to 4. The presence of this layer on the polyethylene films was confirmed with electron microscopy and infrared spectroscopy.
