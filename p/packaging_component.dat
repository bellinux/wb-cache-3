Ontology is a set of relations between concepts of the specific domain and concept, and it can effectively express the general knowledge of specific field. The paper proposes development of smart sensors system based on formal concept analysis and ontology model. Smart sensor is a micro processor, sensor with information detection, information processing, information memory, logical thinking and judging function. The methods can improve the effect of the smart sensors. Copyright © 2013 IFSA...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. High power LEDs are {{currently}} being plagued by heat dissipation challenges due to its high power density thus limiting its further potential development and fulfillment. Exercising proper selection of <b>packaging</b> <b>component</b> could improve the life time of high power LED. In this work, {{the significance of the}} heat slug geometry on the heat dissipation of high power LED was addressed through simulation analysis. The heat slug geometries were varied in order to compare the heat dissipation of the high power LED. Ansys version 11 was utilized for the simulation. The heat dissipation of the high power LED was evaluated in terms of junction temperature, von Mises stress and thermal resistance. The key results of the analysis showed that a superior surface area is preferred for an enhanced heat dissipation of high power LE...|$|E
40|$|Abstract A novel silicon-based {{packaging}} {{platform with}} the electroplated-based reflector and the electrode- guided interconnections is {{developed for the}} <b>packaging</b> <b>component</b> of a high-luminosity and high-efficiency multi-chip light-emitting diode (LED) module, which is patterned on {{a new type of}} insulating layer that consists of nanoporous anodized aluminum oxide (AAO) layer and plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition (PECVD) deposited silicon dioxide (SiO 2) on a doped silicon substrate. The reflector and the electrical interconnections are successfully fabricated by using the electroplating method in the same body. In order to obtain the benefits of high efficiency LED modules, the requirements concerning thermal management and photomechanical layout have to be met. In this paper, we will discuss a novel fabrication method in LED module packaging platform, and then describe the thin layer of electroplated Cu/Ni/Au in order to reduce thermal resistance and to increase thermal diffusion efficiency. The heat generated by the LED chips is dissipated directly to the silicon body through the metal-plated platform, and truly excellent heat dissipation characteristics are observed. We demonstrate 987 lm 8 W-level cool-white light (5000 K, 16 V, 110 lm/W, CRI = 77) emission for 570 µm × 230 µm-chip LEDs at 600 mA operation...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: In Australia, {{as well as}} {{many other}} countries, post {{consumer}} recycling is used in an attempt to combat excessive waste and conserve resources. Much of the success of such recycling programs depends on the everyday consumer sorting their wastes and deciding whether to send a used packaging item to landfill, a recycling facility, or to a composting facility (when available). With the increasing complexity of common packaging systems, the task of identifying recyclable materials and determining how they should be sorted for recovery has become progressively more complicated for individuals. While there is a range of methods used to communicate necessary information to consumers, targeted labelling is a viable option that can successfully specify what action consumers need to take to ensure the <b>packaging</b> <b>component</b> ends up in the correct recovery stream. By means of surveys and face-to-face interviews with consumers from three demographically different areas, this paper examines the extent to which consumers understand recycling information on packaging labels and the actions that result from this understanding. The research shows that consumers ’ understanding of common household packaging, materials, and labelling is often very poor. Many people have the best of intentions, but their sorting behaviour is often incorrect, sending recyclable materials to be buried in landfill and unrecyclable items to recycling facilities, adding unnecessary costs to both systems. The confusion surrounding current labelling and recycling schemes can be attributed to incorrect labelling and system complexity combined with a lack of consumer understanding and care...|$|E

Thus, there is evidence that a two-step approach which helps respondents to isolate valuations for <b>package</b> <b>components</b> is perhaps a preferable bid elicitation procedure for piecewise valuation.
