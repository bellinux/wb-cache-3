40|$|Short-period {{regional}} P/S amplitude ratios hold much {{promise for}} discriminating low magnitude explosions from earthquakes in a Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty monitoring context. However, propagation effects lead to variability in regional phase amplitudes that if not accounted for can {{reduce or eliminate}} the ability of P/S ratios to discriminate the seismic source. lo this study, several representations of short-period regional P/S amplitude ratios are compared {{in order to determine}} which methodology best accounts for the effect of heterogeneous structure on P/S amplitudes. These methodologies are: I) distance corrections, including azimuthal subdivision of the data; 2) path specific crustal waveguide parameter regressions; 3) cap-averaging (running mean smoothing); and 4) kriging. The "predictability" of each method is established by cross-validation (leave-one-out) analysis. We apply these techniques to represent Pn/Lg, Pg/Lg and Pn/Sn observations in three frequency bands (0. 75 - 6. 0 Hz) at station ABKT (Alibek, Turkmenistan), site of a <b>primary</b> <b>seismic</b> <b>station</b> of the It~temational Monitoring System (IMS). Paths to ABKT sample diverse crustal stmctores (e. g. various topographic, sedimentary and geologic structures), leading to great variability in the observed P/S amplitude ratios. Subdivision of the data be back-azimuth leads to stronger distance trends than that for the entire data set. This observation alone indicates that path propagation effects due to laterally varying shucture are important for the P/S ratios recorded at ABKT. For these data to be useful for isolating source characteristics, the scatter needs to be reduced by accounting for the path effects and the resulting P/S ratio distribution needs to Gaussian for spatial interpolation and discrimination strategies to be most effective. Each method reduces the scatter of the P/S ratios with varying degrees of success, however kriging has the distinct advantages of providing the greatest variance reduction and a continuous correction surface with an estimate of the model uncertainty. The largest scatter reductions are obtained for the lowest frequency P/S ratios (< 3. 0 Hz) ...|$|E

Corrections and associated modeling errors to Pn, Pg, Sn, and Lg IASPEI 91 travel time tables are specified on 1 by 1 degree latitude and longitude “source specific ” grids within 20 degrees of each International Monitoring System (IMS) station. International Data Center (IDC) location software is configured to read and apply these grids when locating events in the Reviewed Event Bulletin (REB). In order to develop regional travel time corrections for IMS stations in North Africa, Middle East, and Western Asia, a consortium was formed of experts in IDC software integration/testing/validation, regional/global body/surface-wave tomography, tectonic regionalization, 3 D ray-tracing, and ground truth (GT) data collection with the goal to improve location accuracy and precision while maintaining honest 90 % coverage ellipses.

40|$|Abstract Assessing the {{completeness}} magnitude Mc of earthquake catalogs is {{an essential}} prerequisite for any seismicity analysis. We employ a simple model to com-puteMc in space based on the proximity to <b>seismic</b> <b>stations</b> in a network. We show that a relationship of the form Mpredc d adb c, with d {{the distance to the}} kth nearest <b>seismic</b> <b>station,</b> fits the observations well, k depending on the minimum number of stations being required to trigger an event declaration in a catalog. We then propose a newMc mapping approach, the Bayesian magnitude of completeness (BMC) method, based on a two-step procedure: (1) a spatial resolution optimization to minimize spatial heterogeneities and uncertainties in Mc estimates and (2) a Bayesian approach that merges prior information about Mc based on the proximity to <b>seismic</b> <b>stations</b> with locally observed values weighted by their respective uncertainties. Contrary to the cur-rentMc mapping procedures, the radius that defines which earthquakes to include in the local magnitude distribution is chosen according to an objective criterion, and there are no gaps in the spatial estimation of Mc. The method solely requires the coordinates of <b>seismic</b> <b>stations.</b> Here, we investigate the Taiwan Central Weather Bureau (CWB) seismic network and earthquake catalog over the period 1994 – 2010...|$|R
40|$|The {{study of}} the three {{dimensional}} structure of the earth {{is limited by the}} uneven distribution of earthquake sources and <b>seismic</b> <b>stations.</b> The distribution of the earthquakes is fixed as most earthquakes occur along the plate boundaries. The use of artificial sources can improve the distribution of seismic sources but such experiments are not popular as they require sources with the strength of a nuclear explosion in order to probe the mantle. The distribution of <b>seismic</b> <b>stations</b> is mainly concentrated in regions with a significant earthquake risk. In Europe the availability of seismic data has also been restricted by political borders. The politically changes in the 1980 's and 1990 's in Eastern Europe lead to increased scientific communication which has resulted in the NARS-DEEP (Network of Autonomously Recording Seismographs Deployed on the East European Platform) project. The NARS-DEEP project has been initiated to increase the data coverage in Eastern Europe and to investigate the geodynamic history of the region.

40|$|Introduction: The Apollo Passive Seismic Experiment (PSE) {{was carried}} out on Apollo 12, 14, 15 and 16.
