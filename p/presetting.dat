25|$|The repeating {{sequence}} of states of an LFSR {{allows it to}} be used as a clock divider or as a counter when a non-binary sequence is acceptable, as is often the case where computer index or framing locations need to be machine-readable. LFSR counters have simpler feedback logic than natural binary counters or Gray-code counters, and therefore can operate at higher clock rates. However, it is necessary to ensure that the LFSR never enters an all-zeros state, for example by <b>presetting</b> it at start-up to any other state in the sequence.|$|E
2500|$|In practice, {{the last}} two {{variations}} are invariably used together. [...] They change the transmitted CRC, so must be implemented at both the transmitter and the receiver. [...] While <b>presetting</b> the shift register to ones is straightforward to do at both ends, inverting affects receivers implementing the first variation, because the CRC of a full codeword that already includes a CRC is no longer zero. [...] Instead, it is a fixed non-zero pattern, the CRC of the inversion pattern of [...] ones.|$|E
2500|$|Glow-transfer {{counting}} tubes, {{similar in}} essential function to the trochotrons, had a glow discharge {{on one of}} a number of main cathodes, visible through the top of the glass envelope. Most used a neon-based gas mixture and counted in base-10, but faster types were based on argon, hydrogen, or other gases, and for timekeeping and similar applications a few base-12 types were available. Sets of [...] "guide" [...] cathodes (usually two sets, but some types had one or three) between the indicating cathodes moved the glow in steps to the next main cathode. Types with two or three sets of guide cathodes could count in either direction. A well-known trade name for glow-transfer counter tubes in the United Kingdom was Dekatron. Types with connections to each individual indicating cathode, which enabled <b>presetting</b> the tube's state to any value (in contrast to simpler types which could only be directly reset to zero or a small subset of their total number of states), were trade named Selectron tubes.|$|E

[...] A <b>preset's</b> title also doubles as its [...]milk save name, and usually includes the <b>preset</b> author or authors' pseudonym.

50|$|In practice, most {{standards}} specify <b>presetting</b> {{the register}} to all-ones and inverting the CRC before transmission. This {{has no effect}} on the ability of a CRC to detect changed bits, but gives it the ability to notice bits that are added to the message.|$|E

40|$|We {{study the}} {{relation}} between synchronizing sequences and <b>preset</b> distinguishing sequences which are some special sequences used in finite state machine based testing. We show that the problems related to <b>preset</b> distinguishing sequences can be converted into related problems of synchronizing sequences. Using the results existing in the literature for synchronizing sequences, we offer several reflections of these results for <b>preset</b> distinguishing sequences. Although computing a <b>preset</b> distinguishing sequence is PSPACE-hard, we do identify a class of machines for which computing a <b>preset</b> distinguishing sequence can be performed in polynomial time and argue that this class is practically relevant. We also present an experimental study to compare the performance of exponential brute-force and polynomial heuristic algorithms to compute a <b>preset</b> distinguishing sequence...|$|R
50|$|Heat-setting of {{synthetic}} fabrics eliminates the internal tensions within the fiber, generated during manufacturing, {{and the new}} state can be fixed by rapid cooling. This heat setting fixes the fabrics in the relaxed state, and thus avoids subsequent shrinkage or creasing of the fabric. <b>Presetting</b> of goods {{makes it possible to}} use higher temperature for setting without considering the sublimation properties of dyes and also has a favorable effect on dyeing behavior and the running properties of the fabric. On the other hand, post-setting can be combined with some other operations such as Thermasol dyeing or optical brightening of polyester. Post-setting as a final finish is useful to achieve high dimensional stability, along with desired handle. Heat-setting is an important part in textile finishing.|$|E
50|$|Barrage jamming is radio jamming {{accomplished}} by transmitting {{a band of}} frequencies that is large {{with respect to the}} bandwidth of a single emitter. Barrage jamming may be {{accomplished by}} <b>presetting</b> multiple jammers on adjacent frequencies, by using a single wideband transmitter, or by using a transmitter capable of frequency sweep fast enough to appear radiating simultaneously over wide band (e.g. a carcinotron). Barrage jamming makes it possible to jam emitters on different frequencies simultaneously and reduces the need for operator assistance or complex control equipment. These advantages are gained at the expense of reduced jamming power at any given frequency. Barrage jamming has to be used against frequency-agile radars, which change frequencies too quickly to follow them in a conventional way. The use of barrage jamming may also affect the communications capability of the jamming source in a negative fashion.|$|E

5|$|In {{addition}} to drawbars, many Hammond tonewheel organ models also include <b>presets,</b> which make predefined drawbar combinations {{available at the}} press of a button. Console organs have one octave of reverse colored keys (naturals are black, sharps and flats are white) {{to the left of}} each manual, with each key activating a preset; the far left key (C), also known as the cancel key, de-activates all <b>presets,</b> and results in no sound coming from that manual. The two right-most <b>preset</b> keys (B and B) activate the corresponding set of drawbars for that manual, while the other <b>preset</b> keys produce preselected drawbar settings that are internally wired into the <b>preset</b> panel.|$|R
5000|$|A more {{sophisticated}} method of <b>presetting</b> torque {{is with a}} calibrated clutch mechanism. One common form uses a ball detent and spring, with the spring preloaded by an adjustable screw thread, calibrated in torque units. The ball detent transmits force until the preset torque is reached, {{at which point the}} force exerted by the spring is overcome and the ball [...] "clicks" [...] out of its socket. The advantage of this design is greater precision and both tangible and audible feedback on reaching the desired torque. The wrench will not start slipping once the desired torque is reached, it will only click and bend slightly at the head, the operator can continue to apply torque to the wrench without any additional action or warnings from the wrench. For this reason, it is important to stop applying torque as soon as the wrench gives the click sound.|$|E

5000|$|Several {{designs were}} tried, {{including}} a small bladder of pressurized {{air in the}} propeller hub providing the necessary force to resist a spring that would drive the blades from fine pitch (take-off) to coarse pitch (level cruising). At a suitable airspeed a disk {{on the front of}} the spinner would press sufficiently on the bladder's air-release valve to relieve the pressure and allow the spring to drive the propeller to coarse pitch. These [...] "pneumatic" [...] propellers were fitted on the DH88 Comet aircraft, winner of the famed long distance 1934 Mac Robertson race and in the Caudron C.460 winner of the 1936 National Air Races, flown by Michel Detroyat. Use of these pneumatic propellers required <b>presetting</b> the propeller to fine pitch prior to take-off. This was done by pressurizing the bladder with a bicycle pump, hence the whimsical nickname Gonfleurs d'hélices (prop inflater boy) given to the aircraft ground mechanics in France up to this day.|$|E
