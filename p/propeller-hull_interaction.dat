40|$|By {{analyzing}} the optimum trim of ships in different operating conditions with Reynolds- Averaged Navier-Stokes equation computations (RANSE) the fuel consumption efficiency can be increased. Because {{the influence of}} the trim on the propulsive efficiency is usually approximated the <b>propeller-hull</b> <b>interaction</b> shall be included in the computation to improve the analysis of the optimum trim. Therefore, a setup for future computation of <b>propeller-hull</b> <b>interaction</b> has been carried out using the open source software Open- FOAM and different methods to compute rotational motion which are available in Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD). A feasibility study on the different methods was done by computing the open water characteristics of the propeller and validating the setup with given model tests. Steady methods like the Single Reference Frame method (SRF) and the Multiple Reference Frame method (MRF) have been used to analyze the performance of a propeller in an open water test. For pre-processing the mesh generator of OpenFOAM snappyHexMesh has been used and an automation process to generate the mesh has been developed. Different methods of generating the rotational and non-rotational zones, which are needed for the MRF method, have been investigated. With the introduced automation process it is possible to compute the performance of a propeller in the open water test by just using open source software. The use of the SRF and MRF method combined with the used grid generation method {{can be seen as a}} feasible approach for computing open water characteristics, but when it comes to <b>propeller-hull</b> <b>interaction</b> further investigations are required...|$|E
40|$|<b>Propeller-hull</b> <b>interaction</b> {{coefficients}} - {{the wake}} fraction and the thrust deduction factor - play {{significant role in}} design of propulsion system of a ship. In the case of inland waterway vessels the reliable method of predicting these coefficients in early design stage is missing. Based on the outcomes from model tests and from numerical computations the present authors show {{that it is difficult}} to determine uniquely the trends in change of wake fraction and thrust deduction factor resulting from the changes of hull form or operating conditions. Nowadays the resistance and propulsion model tests of inland waterway vessels are carried out rarely because of relatively high costs. On the other hand, the degree of development of computational methods enables’ to estimate the reliable values o interaction coefficients. The computations referred to in the present paper were carried out using the authors’ own software HPSDKS and the commercial software Ansys Fluent...|$|E
40|$|The Reynolds Transport theorem {{for energy}} {{is used to}} study <b>propeller-hull</b> <b>interaction</b> effects by {{analyzing}} different components of energy flux through a control volume around a self-propelled vessel. These components are the axial kinetic energy, the transversal kinetic energy, the turbulent kinetic energy, the internal energy and the pressure work. This energy balance approach is here used to study the influence of propeller diameter on the propulsive power. To this end, propellers of different diameters have been studied in behind condition. In {{order to keep the}} incoming wake into the propellers as simple as possible, an axi-symmetric hull shape is employed. The energy fluxes are calculated employing a RANS approach to solve the momentum transport and continuity equations together with the energy equation (the heat transfer equation in fluid). The latter equation is solved to compute the internal energy. The results show a minor difference on interaction effects. However, analyzing the energy flux components and their contribution to the total energy provides an extra tool for better understanding of the interaction effects...|$|E
40|$|Since {{the advent}} of laser-Doppler anemometry (L. D. A.) as a new tool in {{experimental}} fluid mechanics much effort {{has been devoted to}} developing practical instrumentation for engineering applications. A non-interfering velocity measurement technique which provides high spatial resolution, directional sensitivity and time resolved information can provide measurements in ship hydrodynamics which hitherto were unobtainable. This paper describes an L. D. A., constructed at Southampton University to take axial velocity measurements in a ship-model towing tank. The optical geometry used is versatile and is readily applicable to cavitation tunnel work. An appendix is included which describes the extension of the instrument to measure three orthogonal components of velocity simultaneously. Results from the wake of a ship model showing mean wake fraction and wake spectra are presented. Three dimensional presentation of the wake power as a function of frequency is also included. Measurements taken {{in the wake of a}} circular cylinder towed along the tank verify the periodic vortex shedding at a Strouhal number of 0. 2 and demonstrate the real-time measurement capability of the instrument. It is hoped that this paper will promote the use of L. D. A. in ship science research. If further progress in the problems of <b>propeller-hull</b> <b>interactions,</b> wake scaling, bilge vortex convection, cavitation and propeller induced vibration is to be made then time resolved velocity information provided by this instrument is required...|$|R
40|$|This work simulates <b>propeller-hull</b> <b>interaction</b> effects by a novel method namely, {{coupling}} a Vortex Lattice Method (VLM) with a RANSE solver. The VLM {{generates the}} propeller forces {{based on the}} inputs of blade geometry, wake at propeller inlet, the required thrust and the propeller revolutions. The propeller forces thus obtained are distributed in the fluid domain at the propeller disk region at specific cells. These cells lie close to the blade coordinates and the forces are assigned to the centroids of cells {{by means of a}} user-defined function (UDF). The introduction of the body forces into the fluid domain, emulates the propeller action in the field of flow with consequent influences on the flow kinematics. Therefore the interaction effect between propeller and ship hull is simulated successfully by coupling the two methods. Thereby the kinematical aspects such as effective wake conditions are obtained. The results based on the methodology have been verified by comparison with data from the KCS ship available in recent published literature. The method establishes a successful numerical tank approach in understanding the ship hull-propeller interaction problem...|$|E
40|$|The project {{described}} in this thesis was undertaken m order to gam {{a better understanding of}} hull-waterjet interaction. The study has investigated interaction effects between a waterjet featuring a flush type intake and a planing hull, 7. 4 metres in length. Full and model scale resistance and propulsion tests have been conducted to accurately measure the thrust deduction fraction and interaction forces. Various techniques for measuring the waterjet thrust are discussed. Graphs of the thrust deduction fraction for a variety of towing positions are reported. Hull static pressure measurements are also reported. A free body, vector approach was used to develop empirical, analytical models for both the towing and propulsion situations. Both models are based on the Savitsky planing performance equations. The propulsion model draws also on Hadler's work on <b>propeller-hull</b> <b>interaction.</b> The analytical towing model was validated against full scale towing tests and small correction functions added. The adjusted model was found to compare favourably with model tests. Using the correction factors developed for the towing model, an analytical propulsion model is constructed incorporating the waterjet momentum forces. A method is described whereby a vector, called the interaction vector, accounting for remaining interaction effects can be found. Two mechanisms are proposed which would account for the interaction vector. By comparing the full scale propulsion tests with the propulsion model, the interaction vector is found. Its general magnitude and position are shown to be consistent with the combined proposed mechanisms...|$|E
40|$|A complex {{interaction}} between a stern tunnel thruster and main propellers is reckoned {{to be responsible}} for a con-siderable decay of the DP system performance during ma-noeuvring operations, in terms of drop of turning moment with increasing loading on the main propellers. In the present work a RANS method is used to depict the flow field and to investigate the hydrodynamic forces acting on a modified version of an offshore vessel model with two main ducted propellers and a tunnel thruster integrated in the stern skeg. The model was previously investigated in model tests carried out in the large towing tank at the Ma-rine Technology Centre in Trondheim. In this work differ-ent loading conditions for the main propellers and for the tunnel thruster are considered in accordance with the model tests. The commercial solver Fluent is applied to study the viscous turbulent flow around the ship hull. The propellers in the ducts as well as the one in the tunnel are represented by an actuator disk approximation, and appropriate distri-butions of thrust and tangential velocity are imposed on the fan disks. Validation of the numerical results is made by comparison against the experimental data. Results are in good agreement with model tests and the thrust loss effects are well represented by CFD calculations. The final aims are to provide physical understanding of the causes of the loss of turning moment, and to investigate the use of RANS calculations as a tool for propeller-thruster and <b>propeller-hull</b> <b>interaction</b> studies, so that the propeller arrangement and DP system design can be readily optimised with re-spect to manoeuvring efficiency...|$|E
40|$|Computational fluid {{dynamics}} (CFD) codes, are recently used as efficient tools to understand flow {{characteristics such as}} wake development around propeller. This thesis presents numerical modelling of flow characteristics in the stern region for a deep drafted LNG carrier with the effect of propeller and rudder in shallow water. The modelling was conducted based on the B 5 - 75 type propeller, with a diameter (D) of 7. 7 m, which was designed at MARIN in the Netherlands. The ANSYS Fluent version 12 software was used to solve the Reynold Averaged Navier Stokes (RANS) equations, and ICEM CFD as a mesh generator. The propeller was meshed using tetra unstructured mesh in a flow field based on 3 D incompressible Navier-stokes solver. Two turbulent models were applied in the ANSYS Fluent; which are the standard k-epsilon (k-e) model for the steady simulation and transient shear stress transport (SST) k-omega (k-?) for the unsteady simulation. For the computational domain, the propeller blades were mounted on two finite long constant radius cylinders. The two types of cylinder domains, were developed; stator domain and rotor domain. For the stator domain, the inlet flow was 2 D from blade, the outlet flow at 6 D and the outer boundary was 3. 6 D. The upstream for the rotor domain was maintained at 0. 2 D but the downstream was extended between 0. 4 D and 0. 7 D, and the outer boundary at 1. 4 D. The turbulent model was simulated in the rotor domain by using the stator-rotor approaches such as the multiple reference frame (MRF) and the sliding mesh (SM) method. Comparisons with the published experiments were presented, and the dependence of the numerical solutions on the computational parameters was studied extensively. The thrust and torque of the propeller were generally predicted with a small error when it was compared with the published experiments. The difference in performance of propeller in the open water test is about 10 percent, likely due to mesh strategy as well as mesh resolution and quality. The performance of the propeller was also studied. It {{was found that the}} rudder placed in front of propeller increased the efficiency of the propeller and produced greater thrust increments when the rudder was deflected to - 70 and - 200. The presence of the rudder which acts by cancelling the trailing vortices from the tip of propeller slipstream leads to increase of thrust and torque of propeller. There was, as expected, a difference in the velocity concentration between propeller only and <b>propeller-hull</b> <b>interaction.</b> The effects of propeller and rudder on the velocity profiles in the region for the LNG carrier in shallow water are clearly identified. Especially in very shallow water, (h/T = 1. 1), the extreme velocity profile is concentrated in vicinity of top part of the stern and seabed regions...|$|E
