25|$|Coupling {{nucleic acids}} with {{proteins}} {{in such a}} model of hypercycle with translation demanded the proper model for the origin of translation code as {{a necessary condition for}} the origin of hypercycle organization. At the time of hypercycle theory formulation, two models for the origin of translation code were proposed by Crick and his collaborators. These were models stating that the first codons were constructed according to either an RRY or an RNY scheme, in which R stands for the <b>purine</b> <b>base,</b> Y for pyrimidine, and N for any base, with the latter assumed to be more reliable. Nowadays, it is assumed that the hypercycle model could be realized by utilization of ribozymes without the need for a hypercycle with translation, and there are many more theories about the origin of the genetic code.|$|E
25|$|In 1961, it {{was shown}} that the nucleic acid <b>purine</b> <b>base</b> adenine can be formed by heating aqueous {{ammonium}} cyanide solutions. Other pathways for synthesizing bases from inorganic materials were also reported. Leslie E. Orgel and colleagues have shown that freezing temperatures are advantageous for the synthesis of purines, due to the concentrating effect for key precursors such as hydrogen cyanide. Research by Stanley L. Miller and colleagues suggested that while adenine and guanine require freezing conditions for synthesis, cytosine and uracil may require boiling temperatures. Research by the Miller group notes the formation of seven different amino acids and 11 types of nucleobases in ice when ammonia and cyanide were left in a freezer from 1972 to 1997. Other work demonstrated the formation of s-triazines (alternative nucleobases), pyrimidines (including cytosine and uracil), and adenine from urea solutions subjected to freeze-thaw cycles under a reductive atmosphere (with spark discharges as an energy source). The explanation given for the unusual speed of these reactions at such a low temperature is eutectic freezing. As an ice crystal forms, it stays pure: only molecules of water join the growing crystal, while impurities like salt or cyanide are excluded. These impurities become crowded in microscopic pockets of liquid within the ice, and this crowding causes the molecules to collide more often. Mechanistic exploration using quantum chemical methods provide a more detailed understanding {{of some of the}} chemical processes involved in chemical evolution, and a partial answer to the fundamental question of molecular biogenesis.|$|E

2500|$|PAHs {{that affect}} cancer {{initiation}} are typically first chemically modified by enzymes into metabolites that react with DNA, leading to mutations. When the DNA sequence is altered in genes that regulate cell replication, cancer can result. Mutagenic PAHs, such as benzopyrene, usually have {{four or more}} aromatic rings {{as well as a}} [...] "bay region", a structural pocket that increases reactivity of the molecule to the metabolizing enzymes. Mutagenic metabolites of PAHs include diol epoxides, quinones, and radical PAH cations. These metabolites can bind to DNA at specific sites, forming bulky complexes called DNA adducts that can be stable or unstable. Stable adducts may lead to DNA replication errors, while unstable adducts react with the DNA strand, removing a <b>purine</b> <b>base</b> (either adenine or guanine). Such mutations, if they are not repaired, can transform genes encoding for normal cell signaling proteins into cancer-causing oncogenes. Quinones can also repeatedly generate reactive oxygen species that may independently damage DNA.|$|E

50|$|Multivariate {{statistical}} analysis of codon use within genomes with unequal quantities of coding sequences on the two strands has shown that codon use in the third position depends on the strand on which the gene is located. This seems {{likely to be the}} result of Szybalski's and Chargaff's rules. Because of the asymmetry in pyrimidine and purine use in coding sequences, the strand with the greater coding content will tend to have the greater number of <b>purine</b> <b>bases</b> (Szybalski's rule). Because the number of <b>purine</b> <b>bases</b> will, to a very good approximation, equal the number of their complementary pyrimidines within the same strand and, because the coding sequences occupy 80-90% of the strand, there appears to be (1) a selective pressure on the third base to minimize the number of <b>purine</b> <b>bases</b> in the strand with the greater coding content; and (2) that this pressure is proportional to the mismatch in the length of the coding sequences between the two strands.|$|R

Cyclic voltammetric studies show different charge transfer behavior among the <b>purine</b> <b>bases</b> on the NSPE*.

The analytical performance of the NSPE* was demonstrated for the simultaneous determination of Hx, X. and UA in blood plasma and urine samples. The estimation of the fish freshness by monitoring the Hx content was also established with very good reproducibility. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R

5000|$|The DNA nucleosides {{adenosine}} and guanosine {{consist of}} a <b>purine</b> <b>base</b> attached to a ribose sugar with a glycosidic bond. In the case of RNA nucleotides deoxyadenosine and deoxyguanosine, the purine bases are attached to a deoxyribose sugar with a glycosidic bond. The purine bases on DNA and RNA nucleotides are synthesized in a twelve-step reaction mechanism present in most single-celled organisms. Higher eukaryotes employ a similar reaction mechanism in ten reaction steps. Purine bases are synthesized by converting phosphoribosyl pyrophosphate (PRPP) to inosine monophosphate (IMP), {{which is the first}} key intermediate in <b>purine</b> <b>base</b> biosynthesis.

40|$|Fast-atom {{bombardment}} (FAB) mass spectrometry, {{linked with}} tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS), was employed for {{the identification of}} methylated <b>purine</b> <b>bases</b> in four urinary extracts of healthy subjects and fourteen urinary extracts of patients bearing colorectal tumors. In order to obtain an easy structural identification of the species present in urinary extracts, the MS/MS spectra of MH+ species of twenty nine diagnostically relevant <b>purine</b> <b>bases</b> were studied. Even if definitive quantitative data cannot be obtained by this approach, FAB mass spectra of urine extracts lead to a readily reproducible mapping of endogenous <b>purine</b> <b>bases,</b> allowing a distinction between healthy and sick subjects. Bases such as 9 -ethyladenine, N 6 - 2 -isopentenyladenine and N 6 -benzyladenine were detected only in urine samples of colorectal tumor bearing patients. The detection in urine of compounds such as 7 -methylguanine and 1 -methylguanine, and their increase in the urine of colorectal tumor bearing patients, has been justified either by a more rapid turnover of nucleic acids in tumor tissue or {{by an increase in}} the extent of their methylation.

The rate constants for the spontaneous and oxonium ion catalyzed heterolysis of the protonated substrates were calculated from the acidity constants and the observed rate constants. The dependence of the partial rate constants on the polar nature of the 6 -substituents are consistent with rate-limiting formation of free <b>purine</b> <b>bases</b> and glycosyl oxocarbenium ions.

We found a high-affinity common transport system for adenine, guanine, and hypoxanthine, with a Km of 40 nM. This system was inhibited noncompetitively by purine nucleosides. In addition, two transport systems for nucleosides were present: one for guanosine with a Km of 0. 8 microM and another one for inosine and adenosine with a Km of 1. 4 microM. The nucleoside transport systems exhibited both mixed and noncompetitive inhibition by different nucleosides other than those translocated; <b>purine</b> and pyrimidine <b>bases</b> had no effect. The transport of nucleosides and <b>purine</b> <b>bases</b> was inhibited by dinitrophenol or azide, thus suggesting that transport is energy dependent.
