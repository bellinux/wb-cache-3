5|$|In Europe, {{before the}} {{outbreak}} of the war, the Allies had significant advantages in both <b>population</b> <b>and</b> economics. In 1938, the Western Allies (United Kingdom, France, Poland and British Dominions) had a 30 per cent larger <b>population</b> <b>and</b> a 30 per cent higher gross domestic product than the European Axis powers (Germany and Italy); if colonies are included, it then gives the Allies more than a 5:1 advantage in <b>population</b> <b>and</b> nearly 2:1 advantage in GDP. In Asia at the same time, China had roughly six times the population of Japan, but only an 89 per cent higher GDP; this is reduced to three times the <b>population</b> <b>and</b> only a 38 per cent higher GDP if Japanese colonies are included.|$|E

40|$|The chapter {{outlines}} how {{the development}} of <b>population</b> censuses <b>and</b> their alternatives such as <b>population</b> registers <b>and</b> government administrative databases {{can be understood as}} different forms of surveillance by numbers. That is, it investigates how the gaze of these devices is fixed on surveilling whole <b>populations</b> <b>and</b> governing by numbers. Rather than being more or less surveillant or constituting better and cheaper ‘information’ about populations it argues that different numbering devices find, see <b>and</b> count different <b>populations</b> <b>and</b> have different governing consequences.

By 1850 there were seven railway termini around the urban centre of London: London Bridge and Waterloo to the south, Shoreditch and Fenchurch Street to the east, Euston and King's Cross to the north, and Paddington to the west. Only Fenchurch Street station was within the City.|$|E
