The hydroalcoholic macerates were obtained by preparing two recipes (labeled I and II) of different mixtures of plants. Recipes I A in 45 % alcohol and I B in 60 % alcohol, had characteristics of appearance, color, taste and smell, very intense, specific, prevailing the taste of anise, fennel and coriander.

In the present study, pectin was extracted using alcohol precipitation method from the <b>peels</b> <b>of</b> orange (<b>Citrus</b> sinensis), sweet lime (Citrus limetta) and lemon (Citrus limon). When the extraction conditions were varied one-at-a-time, a maximum yield of 36. 71 % was obtained from C. limon, after which the yield was further enhanced using the Box-Behnken Design of Response Surface Methodology. Optimum conditions for the extraction process were established to be pH 3. 5, temperature 65 °C and time 67. 5 min. The interaction effects of these variables were studied using 3 -D and contour plots. A 1. 5 -fold increase in pectin yield was obtained {{as a result of}} this experimental design. Analysis of variance indicated the significance of the model. The pectin obtained was then subjected to qualitative and quantitative analyses and found to contain desirable methoxyl, hyaluronic acid contents and degree of esterification. Functional groups present in the pectin were investigated using FTIR spectroscopy. The overall results point towards the amenability of the extracted pectin for industrial applications.

Because of these features, LAESI-MSI may be the method of choice for spatially-resolved food analysis. In this work, LAESI time-of-flight MSI was investigated for macroscopic and microscopic imaging of pesticides, mycotoxins, and plant metabolites on rose leaves, orange and lemon fruit, ergot bodies, cherry tomatoes, and maize kernels. Accurate mass ion-map data were acquired at sampling locations with an x–y center-to-center distance of 0. 2 – 1. 0 mm and were superimposed onto co-registered optical images. The spatially-resolved ion maps of pesticides on rose leaves suggest co-application of registered and banned pesticides. Ion maps of the fungicide imazalil reveal that this compound is only localized on the <b>peel</b> <b>of</b> <b>citrus</b> <b>fruit.</b> However, according to three-dimensional LAESI-MSI the penetration depth of imazalil into the peel has significant local variation. Ion maps of different plant alkaloids on ergot bodies from rye reveal co-localization in accordance with expectations. The feasibility of using untargeted MSI for food analysis was revealed by ion maps of plant metabolites in cherry tomatoes and maize-kernel slices. For tomatoes, traveling-wave ion mobility (TWIM) was used to discriminate between different lycoperoside glycoalkaloid isomers; for maize quadrupole time-of-flight tandem mass spectrometry (MS–MS) was successfully used to elucidate {{the structure of a}} localized unknown.

Osmotic dehydration, commonly used to remove part of the water content of fruit before further drying, could increase {{the stability of the}} colour pigment and minimize the shrinkage phenomenon. The aim of this research is to apply to orange peels the osmodehydration followed by air-drying in order to obtain a high quality food ingredient both from a nutritional and sensorial aspect. Peels from vacuum infused organic oranges, cv Tarocco and cv Navel, were cut into slices (1 x 2 cm) and then osmodehydrated at 20 °C in sucrose solution (60 % w/w) for different times (1 - 2 - 3 - 4 - 5 - 6 - 24 h), followed by air drying at 80 °C up to a constant weight. Solid gain and water loss of the osmotic process were assessed. Changes of colour and shape, due to processing, were evaluated by image analysis technique. The bitterness sensorial characteristic of powders, obtained from grinding the dried peel, was judged by a panel test. The high solid gain <b>of</b> <b>peels,</b> due to the osmotic step, was attributed to the particular structure of pith, which was able to absorb an elevated amount of sugar solution thanks to its wide intercellular spaces and not turgid cells. The solid gain allowed colour attributes of slices after air dehydration to be maintained. The air drying without pre-treatment, caused a structural collapse <b>of</b> <b>peels</b> which looked wrinkled. This effect was noticeably reduced in pre-osmodehydrated slices with a positive progressive trend in function of osmosis time. Furthermore the solid-liquid exchanges and the consequent sucrose intake had a positive effect on sensorial quality of the dried product, decreasing the characteristic bitter perception...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACTBackground: Formulated Citrus Peel Extract (GL) {{made from}} the <b>peels</b> <b>of</b> six <b>citrus</b> <b>fruits</b> {{available}} in Japan, namely navel oranges, citrus hassaku, citrus limon, citrus natsudaidai, citrus miyauchi and satsuma, was initially developed as a cosmetic product to protect skin from UV irradiation. Anecdotal evidences of anti-cancer property of GL have been reported by consumers based on the cases such as topical application for melanoma, and oral ingestion for prostate, lung and liver cancers. Those anecdotal reports stimulated us to investigate anti-tumorigenesis activity of GL. In the previous study, we reported that the topical application of GL inhibited DMBA/TPA-induced skin tumor formation by decreasing inflammatory gene parameters. Objective: In this study, we mainly investigated the effect of GL on translocation of NF-kB together with production of nitric-oxide and TNF-α induced by LPS in RAW 264. 7 cells. Results: This investigation showed that GL decreased the release of TNF-α and nitric oxide from macrophage RAW 264. 7 cells stimulated by LPS in a dose-dependent manner. In addition, GL suppressed the expression of iNOS and nuclear translocation of NF-kB in RAW 264. 7 cells, inhibited the degradation of IκB-α, and scavenged hydroxyl radicals (DMPO/OH adduct) in vitro. Conclusions: Our findings suggest that GL suppresses the inflammation in vitro, and exerts chemopreventive activity through the inhibition of production of TNF-α and iNOS proteins due to the inhibition of nuclear translocation of NF-kB and oxidative stress. GL {{appears to be a}} novel functional natural product capable of preventing inflammation and inflammation-associated tumorigenesis.

40|$|The Unshiu {{mandarin}} (Citrus unshiu Marc.) is {{the major}} Citrus crop in Croatia. Limiting factors for longer consumption of Unshiu mandarin are low storage performance {{and the appearance of}} chilling injuries during storage. Previous studies indicated that oxidative stress might be involved in cold-induced <b>peel</b> damage <b>of</b> harvested <b>Citrus</b> <b>fruit.</b> The aim <b>of</b> {{the present study was to}} investigate peroxidase distribution, isoenzyme pattern and activity in the <b>peel</b> <b>of</b> Unshiu mandarin fruit. Special goal of our study was to investigate the changes of peroxidase activity in respect to two different hot water dipping (HWD) treatments (3 min at 48 and 52 °C) and two different storage temperatures (1 and 3 °C) combined. Peroxidase activity was detected at the border of oil glands, in the peel surface and in the conducting elements positioned in the inner part <b>of</b> the <b>peel.</b> Electrophoretic analysis revealed the presence of two peroxidase isoenzymes. There were no differences in the electrophoretic pattern after the HWD treatments and cold storage. Lowering of both total and specific peroxidase activity was measured in HWD-treated samples in comparison with the control ones. However, it appeared that significant decrease in total peroxidase activity was influenced by the storage temperatures, while the increase in total soluble protein content was influenced by the HWD pretreatment...|$|R

40|$|Visible light imaging <b>of</b> <b>citrus</b> <b>fruit</b> from Mie Prefecture of Japan was {{performed}} to determine whether an algorithm could be developed to predict the sugar content. This nondestructive classification showed that the accurate segmentation of different images can be realized by a correlation analysis based on the threshold value of the coefficient of determination. There is an obvious correlation between the sugar content <b>of</b> <b>citrus</b> <b>fruit</b> and certain parameters of the color images. The selected image parameters were connected by addition algorithm. The sugar content <b>of</b> <b>citrus</b> <b>fruit</b> can be predicted by the dummy variable method. The {{results showed that the}} small but orange <b>citrus</b> <b>fruits</b> often have a high sugar content. The study shows {{that it is possible to}} predict the sugar content <b>of</b> <b>citrus</b> <b>fruit</b> and to perform a classification of the sugar content using light in the visible spectrum and without the need for an additional light source...|$|R
