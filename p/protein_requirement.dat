50|$|Endurance athletes {{differ from}} strength-building athletes in that {{endurance}} athletes do not build as much muscle mass from training as strength-building athletes do. Research suggests that individuals performing endurance activity require more protein intake than sedentary individuals so that muscles broken down during endurance workouts can be repaired. Although the <b>protein</b> <b>requirement</b> for athletes still remains controversial (for instance see Lamont, Nutrition Research Reviews, pages 142 - 149, 2012), research does show that endurance athletes {{can benefit from}} increasing protein intake because the type of exercise endurance athletes participate in still alters the protein metabolism pathway. The overall <b>protein</b> <b>requirement</b> increases because of amino acid oxidation in endurance-trained athletes. Endurance athletes who exercise {{over a long period}} (2-5 hours per training session) use protein as a source of 5-10% of their total energy expended. Therefore, a slight increase in protein intake may be beneficial to endurance athletes by replacing the protein lost in energy expenditure and protein lost in repairing muscles. Some scientists suggest that endurance athletes may increase daily protein intake to a maximum of 1.2-1.4 g per kg body weight.|$|E

5000|$|The {{beginning}} of the digestion system of cats begins with their sharp teeth. Their sharp teeth help them tear meat which is {{most if not all}} of their diet. Cats naturally do not have a diet high in carbohydrates, and therefore, their saliva doesn’t contain the enzyme amylase.Food moves from the mouth through the esophagus and into the stomach. The gastrointestinal tract of domestic cats contains a small cecum and unsacculated colon. The cecum while similar to dogs, doesn’t have a coiled cecum. The stomach of the cat can be divided into distinct regions of motor activity. The proximal end of the stomach relaxes when food is digested.While food is being digested this portion of the stomach either has rapid stationary contractions or a sustained tonic contraction of muscle. These different actions result in either the food being moved around or the food moving towards the distal portion of the stomach.The distal portion of the stomach undergoes rhythmic cycles of partial depolarization.This depolarization sensitizes muscle cells so {{they are more likely to}} contract. The stomach is not only a muscular structure, it also serves a chemical function by releasing hydrochloric acid and other digestive enzymes to break down food. Food moves from the stomach into the small intestine. The first part of the small intestine is the duodenum. As food moves through the duodenum it mixes with bile, a fluid that neutralizes stomach acid and emulsifies fat. Bile is created in the liver and stored in the gall bladder. The pancreas releases enzymes that aid in digestion so that nutrients can be broken down and pass through the intestinal mucosa into the blood and travel to the rest of the body.The pancreas doesn’t produce starch processing enzymes because cats don’t eat a diet high in carbohydrates. [...] Since the cat digests low amounts of glucose, the pancreas uses amino acids to trigger insulin release instead of glucose. Food then moves on to the jejunum. This is the most nutrient absorptive section of the small intestine. The liver regulates the level of nutrients absorbed into the blood system from the small intestine. From the jejunum, whatever food that has not been absorbed is sent to the ileum which connects to the large intestine.The first part of the large intestine is the cecum and the second portion is the colon. The large intestine reabsorbs water and forms fecal matter. There are some things that the cats are not able to digest. For example, cats clean themselves by licking their fur with their tongue, which causes them to swallow a lot of fur. This causes a build-up of fur in a cat’s stomach and creates a mass of fur. This is often thrown up and is better known as a hair ball. The short length of the digestive tract of the cat causes cats’ digestive system to weigh less than other species of animals, which allows cats to be active predators. While cats are well adapted to be predators they have a limited ability to regulate catabolic enzymes of amino acids meaning amino acids are constantly being destroyed and not absorbed.Therefore, cats have a higher <b>protein</b> <b>requirement</b> in their diet than many other species. Cats are not adapted to synthesize niacin from tryptophan and because they are carnivores can’t convert carotene to vitamin A so eating plants while not harmful does not provide them nutrients. Understanding the digestive system of a domestic cat is very important for pet owners. If a pet owner understands how the different parts work together then if a problem occurs they could potentially help the cat’s situation even before taking it to a vet.|$|E

40|$|A major {{challenge}} to improving swine feeding programs is adopting new techniques {{to improve the}} accuracy of determining <b>protein</b> <b>requirements.</b> This is important for a variety reasons: First, there are currently many different commercial populations of pigs (commonly called genotypes) and these different populations may have different <b>protein</b> <b>requirements</b> because of their different lean growth potentials. Secondly, dietary protein levels should be carefully tailored to pigs’ lean growth potential because both inadequate and excessive feeding of protein can reduce performance and increase production costs. Finally, it is too expensive and time consuming to perform traditional feeding and carcass analysis experiments for every possible population. Therefore, a simple procedure to identify <b>protein</b> <b>requirements</b> of growing-finishing pigs is needed.

40|$|IN RECENT years, {{many people}} have {{considered}} the <b>protein</b> <b>requirement</b> of high-producing laying hens to {{be as high as}} 18 or 19 % of the diet, but some re-search has shown protein levels as low as 12 % adequate. The National Research Council (NRC) (1966, Table 1) states the <b>protein</b> <b>requirement</b> as 15 % of the diet. Table 9 of the same publication states that, for 60 % production, a laying hen weighing 1, 800 g. requires 16. 5 g. of pro-tein daily. From Table 6, one can calcu-late a daily <b>protein</b> <b>requirement</b> of 15. 8 g. protein for the 1, 800 g. hen producing 200 eggs per year or 18. 5 g. daily for a 300 -egg per year rate of production. From Table 6 and Table 1, one can also calculate a daily requirement of 17. 5 and 20. 1 g. protein for the 2, 270 g. hen producing 200 and 300 eggs per year, respectively. Harms et al.

Methods: 72 -h nitrogen balance (NBAL) was determined in 10 female cyclists training 10. 8 h·w- 1 (SD: 2. 82), following two habituated protein intakes: a) a diet representing normal habitual intake (NH) (Protein: 85 g. d- 1 Energy: 9078 kJ·d- 1), b) an isolcaloric high-protein diet (HP) (Protein: 166 g·d- 1, Energy: 8909 kJ·d- 1). Total 72 -h nitrogen intake was determined from Leco total combustion analysis from samples of the ingested food items, while total loss was determined from micro-kjeldahl analysis of total 72 -h urine, urea nitrogen concentration of regional resting and exercise sweat sampling, and literature-based estimates of fecal and miscellaneous nitrogen losses. Habituated <b>protein</b> <b>requirement</b> was estimated by the mean regression of the two estimates of 72 -h nitrogen balance vs. nitrogen intake. Results: Mean (SD) 24 -h dietary protein intake during the 72 -h sampling period was NH: 85 (11 g), HP: 166 (19 g). Mean 24 -h urinary nitrogen during the NH and HP blocks were 13. 19 (2. 39 g·d- 1) and 21. 53 (3. 94 g·d- 1) respectively. Sweat urea nitrogen excretion was NH: 0. 33 (0. 08 g·d- 1) and HP: 0. 54 (0. 12 g·d- 1). Normal habitual and high-protein intakes resulted in a mean negative and positive nitrogen balance, respectively (mean ± SD) (NH: - 0. 59 ± 1. 64, HP: 2. 69 ± 3. 09).

40|$|Dietary {{protein is}} {{the only source of}} {{nitrogen}} for constructing amino acids and proteins in fish. Body protein is always in a dynamic equilibrium and fish of different feeding adaptations and ages build and repair tissues at different rates. Therefore protein requirements vary considerably with age and species. Protein is also used as an energy source for metabolism. Every gram of protein oxidized inside the fish body produces about 18. 8 kJ energy. The protein required for body protein maintenance is called the minimum <b>protein</b> <b>requirement</b> or maintenance requirement. The optimal <b>protein</b> <b>requirement</b> is the proportion of protein in the diet which produces the highest fish growth per unit of protein consumed.

Recent findings Recent studies have addressed the importance of protein feeding and/or muscle (protein) wasting in critically ill patients. Targeted feeding has been shown to improve protein balance in one study, and infection rate in one study. Low muscle mass that is already present during ICU admission {{has been shown to be}} related to higher mortality, in two studies. Four studies have related muscle wasting to (protein) feeding strategies with very diverse results: Two small studies have reported no advantage [nâ€Š=â€Š 15, computed tomography] or negative impact (nâ€Š=â€Š 62, ultrasound, 50 % sepsis patients) of protein on muscle wasting. Two studies, one small (nâ€Š=â€Š 33, computed tomography) and one very large (nâ€Š=â€Š 1372, Subjective Global Assessment), have reported a positive impact of (early) feeding on muscle wasting. Summary Fundamental to adequate protein feeding in critically ill patients, at least 1. 2 â€Šg protein/kg per day, is targeted energy feeding using indirect calorimetry. The level of <b>protein</b> <b>requirement</b> is related to fat free mass or muscle mass, which makes sex and BMI also relevant. Targeted early protein feeding is found to improve short-term outcome, reduction of muscle wasting and hospital mortality. Long-term outcome of protein feeding has not been studied.

The net energy requirements (NEm) and metabolizable energy for maintenance (MEm) were obtained while relating heat production (HP) and metabolizable energy intake (MEI); meanwhile, the net energy requirements for gain (NEg) and the net <b>protein</b> <b>requirements</b> for gain (NPg) were obtained as a function of empty body weight (EBW), empty body gain (EBG) and retained energy (RE) in EBW. The daily net and metabolizable energy requirements for maintenance were 76. 90 and 119. 36 kcal/EBW 0. 75, respectively. The net energy requirements for gain can be obtained by the following equation: NEg = 0. 0568 ± 0. 0025 × EBW 0. 75 × EBG 1. 095. The efficiencies of use of metabolizable energy for maintenance and gain are 64. 4 and 29. 68 %, respectively. The metabolizable <b>protein</b> <b>requirements</b> for maintenance are 4. 14 g/BW 0. 75. The net <b>protein</b> <b>requirements</b> for gain can be obtained through the following equation: NPg = 236. 36 ± 30. 06 × EBG - 19. 84 ± 6. 14 × RE. We recommend the use of the equations obtained in this experiment to calculate the energy and <b>protein</b> <b>requirements</b> of crossbred Holstein x Zebu steers...|$|R
