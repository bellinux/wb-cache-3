40|$|The {{focus of}} the current study was to {{determine}} the most effective way to teach tacts, or labels, to children with autism who have a language deficit. Two participants were included in the study, which compared two <b>prompting</b> procedures, the verbal <b>prompting</b> condition and the gestural <b>prompting</b> condition. The verbal <b>prompting</b> condition included presenting a target picture and the verbal <b>prompt,</b> What is it? In the gestural <b>prompting</b> condition, a picture was presented, but rather than the verbal <b>prompt,</b> a pointing <b>prompt</b> was offered. Approximately 32 sessions were conducted 2 - 3 times per week. The effects of the two interventions were evaluated using an alternating treatment design.

40|$|To {{create a}} cost {{effective}} environment during {{the management of}} building facilities, energy conservation is important among building users as it can help to conserve energy and reduce energy cost. To promote energy conservation, the behavior of user should be focused where their behavior should be improved to reduce energy wastage. <b>Prompt</b> is among the simplest and inexpensive behavioural interventions to improve energy conservation behavior. The <b>prompt</b> has been used wisely in healthcare sectors to promote healthy lifestyles, but no recent study on energy conservation behavior. The aim {{of this research was}} to investigate the effectiveness of <b>prompt</b> in <b>prompting</b> energy conservation behavior among the building users in university. An experiment was designed and carried out to examine the effectiveness of local and global types <b>prompt</b> messages for <b>prompting</b> efficiency use of energy.

5|$|Some {{parts of}} the game require timed {{responses}} from players, often leading to significant decisions that impact the game's story. Some conversation trees require players to select a response within a limited time, otherwise Reza remains silent. The game also requires action choices, wherein players must {{decide what to do}} in specific circumstances; for example, one sequences tasks players with choosing whether to take aggression during a protest, or to take photographs. Other characters will respond to the decisions accordingly, and a notification feature indicates that a character will remember the selected response. In action-based sequences, players follow on-screen <b>prompts</b> for quick time events in order to stay alive. Should players fail to follow the <b>prompts</b> in the allocated time, the game restarts from prior to the quick time event.|$|E

The results indicated that (1) children usually failed to learn the discriminations without a <b>prompt,</b> (2) children always failed to learn when the extra-stimulus <b>prompt</b> was employed but usually did learn with the within-stimulus <b>prompt,</b> and (3) these findings were independent of which modality (auditory or visual) was required for the discrimination...|$|R
