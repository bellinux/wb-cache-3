50|$|The Artistic Style of {{this piece}} seems to vary throughout, {{particularly}} {{in the use of}} brushstrokes, alternating between loose and finite. This alternation between loose and finite helps reinforce the idea of realistic classicalism that Carracci is well known for. The background is done with loose brushstrokes and a good blending of colors whereas the main figures are very classical and ideal shown through intricate details and realism. The figures all have little elements on them that are incredibly intricate. Venus’ hairpiece is made up of small beads and Adonis’ quiver, sandals, and clothing have specific details that aid to his character. Even the dogs’ collars are significant. Something peculiar is that Cupids’ wings have a little red on them, possibly the blood from Venus’ chest or just Annibale’s way of showing reflection. The pink drapery underneath Venus, possibly resemble love because it is a derivative of Red, has loose areas of color throughout it. The three primary colors are displayed in the piece: yellow, blue, and pink and are the most vibrant of the piece, all in a <b>pastel</b> <b>shade.</b> All the draperies have lose white brushes on them in order to look like reflections of the light.|$|E
