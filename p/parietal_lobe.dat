5|$|Alzheimer's {{disease is}} characterised by loss of neurons and synapses in the {{cerebral}} cortex and certain subcortical regions. This loss results in gross atrophy {{of the affected}} regions, including degeneration in the temporal lobe and <b>parietal</b> <b>lobe,</b> {{and parts of the}} frontal cortex and cingulate gyrus. Degeneration is also present in brainstem nuclei like the locus coeruleus. Studies using MRI and PET have documented reductions in the size of specific brain regions in people with AD as they progressed from mild cognitive impairment to Alzheimer's disease, and in comparison with similar images from healthy older adults.|$|E
5|$|The cortex {{is mapped}} by {{divisions}} into about fifty different functional areas known as Brodmann's areas. These areas are distinctly different when seen under a microscope. The cortex {{is divided into}} two main functional areas – a motor cortex and a sensory cortex. The primary sensory areas receive signals from the sensory nerves and tracts by way of relay nuclei in the thalamus. Primary sensory areas include the visual cortex of the occipital lobe, the auditory cortex in parts of the temporal lobe and insular cortex, and the somatosensory cortex in the <b>parietal</b> <b>lobe.</b> The primary motor cortex, which sends axons down to motor neurons in the brainstem and spinal cord, occupies the rear portion of the frontal lobe, {{directly in front of the}} somatosensory area. The remaining parts of the cortex, are called the association areas. These areas receive input from the sensory areas and lower parts of the brain and are involved in the complex cognitive processes of perception, thought, and decision-making. The main functions of the frontal lobe are to control attention, abstract thinking, behavior, problem solving tasks, and physical reactions and personality. The occipital lobe is the smallest lobe; its main functions are visual reception, visual-spatial processing, movement, and colour recognition. There is a smaller occipital lobule in the lobe known as the cuneus. The temporal lobe controls auditory and visual memories, language, and some hearing and speech.|$|E
5|$|The {{prefrontal cortex}} plays a {{significant}} role in mediating executive functions. Neuroimaging during neuropsychological tests of executive function, such as the stroop test and working memory tests, have found that cortical maturation of the prefrontal cortex correlates with executive function in children. Planning involves activation of the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), anterior cingulate cortex, angular prefrontal cortex, right prefrontal cortex, and supramarginal gyrus. Working memory manipulation involves the DLPFC, inferior frontal gyrus, and areas of the parietal cortex. Inhibitory control involves multiple areas of the prefrontal cortex as well as the caudate nucleus and subthalamic nucleus.In conditions in which prepotent responses tend to dominate behavior, such as in drug addiction, where drug cues can elicit drug seeking (Chapter 15), or in attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD; described below), significant negative consequences can result.... ADHD can be conceptualized as a disorder of executive function; specifically, ADHD is characterized by reduced ability to exert and maintain cognitive control of behavior. Compared with healthy individuals, those with ADHD have diminished ability to suppress inappropriate prepotent responses to stimuli (impaired response inhibition) and diminished ability to inhibit responses to irrelevant stimuli (impaired interference suppression).... Functional neuroimaging in humans demonstrates activation of the prefrontal cortex and caudate nucleus (part of the striatum) in tasks that demand inhibitory control of behavior.... Early results with structural MRI show thinning of the cerebral cortex in ADHD subjects compared with age-matched controls in prefrontal cortex and posterior parietal cortex, areas involved in working memory and attention.}} Task shifting doesn't involve specific regions of the brain, but instead involves multiple regions of the prefrontal cortex and <b>parietal</b> <b>lobe.</b>|$|E

25|$|For {{prospective}} memory, the <b>parietal</b> <b>lobe</b> {{is important}} for recognizing cues that trigger an intended action, especially when the cues are visual or spatial. The <b>parietal</b> <b>lobe</b> is also responsible for maintaining attention on the intended action and inhibiting other activities during performance. Studies using PET {{have shown that the}} <b>parietal</b> <b>lobe</b> is activated when participants engage in prospective memory tasks involving visual information such as remembering a series of numbers.

40|$|How do the <b>parietal</b> <b>lobes</b> {{contribute}} to simple calculation? Clinical and neuroimaging methods, {{which are based}} mainly on correlational evidence, have provided contrasting results so far. Here we used direct cortical electrostimulation during brain surgery to causally infer {{the role of the}} left and right <b>parietal</b> <b>lobes</b> in simple calculation. Stimulation provoked errors for addition and multiplication in different parietal areas on both hemispheres. Crucially, an innovative qualitative error analysis unveiled the functional contrast of the 2 <b>parietal</b> <b>lobes.</b> Right or left stimulation led to different types of substitution errors in multiplication, unveiling the function of the more active hemisphere. While inhibition of the left hemisphere led mainly to approximation errors, right hemisphere inhibition enhanced retrieval within a stored repertory. These results highlight the respective roles of each hemisphere in the network: rote retrieval of possible solutions by the left parietal areas and approximation to the correct solution by the right hemisphere. The bilateral orchestration between these functions guarantees precise calculation...|$|R

40|$|Background: The {{pathophysiology}} of psychogenic movement disorders, including psychogenic tremor (PT), is only emerging.

Discussion: Hypermetabolism of the medial aspects of posterior <b>parietal</b> <b>lobes</b> bilaterally may reflect abnormal activity of sensory integration that {{is important in the}} pathogenesis of PT. This further supports the idea that non-organic movement disorders may be associated with detectable functional brain abnormalities. </div...|$|R
