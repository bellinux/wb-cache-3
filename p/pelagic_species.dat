5|$|Most {{species of}} the Hydrophiinae are able to respire through {{the top of their}} skin. This is unusual for reptiles, because their skin is thick and scaly, but {{experiments}} with the black-and-yellow sea snake, Pelamis platura (a <b>pelagic</b> <b>species),</b> have shown this species can satisfy about 25% of its oxygen requirements in this manner, which allows for prolonged dives.|$|E
5|$|Compared {{to other}} deep-sea sharks, the Izak {{catshark}} {{has a large}} heart suggestive of a relatively active lifestyle. It is a generalist that feeds {{on a wide variety}} of bony fishes, crustaceans, and cephalopods; larger sharks consume proportionately more crustaceans and fewer fishes. At least some part of its recorded diet probably represents scavenging from fishery discards, given the presence of fast-moving, <b>pelagic</b> <b>species</b> that the shark is unlikely to have captured live. Polychaete worms, hydrozoans, gastropods, and hagfish eggs may also be occasionally ingested. This species often has nematode and flatworm parasites in its stomach.|$|E
5|$|Most Hydrophiinae are {{completely}} aquatic and {{have adapted to}} their environments in many ways, the most characteristic {{of which is a}} paddle-like tail that has improved their swimming ability. To a varying degree, the bodies of many species are laterally compressed, especially in the <b>pelagic</b> <b>species.</b> This has often caused the ventral scales to become reduced in size, even difficult to distinguish from the adjoining scales. Their lack of ventral scales means they have become virtually helpless on land, but as they live out their entire lifecycles at sea, they have no need to leave the water.|$|E

5|$|The {{outermost}} {{layer of}} the body has no cuticle but consists of a ciliated and glandular epithelium containing rhabdites, which form the mucus in which the cilia glide. Each ciliated cell has many cilia and microvilli. The outermost layer rests on a thickened basement membrane, the dermis. Next to the dermis {{are at least three}} layers of muscles, some circular and some longitudinal. The combinations of muscle types vary between the different classes, but these are not associated with differences in movement. Nemerteans also have dorso-ventral muscles, which flatten the animals, especially in the larger species. Inside the concentric tubes of these layers is mesenchyme, a kind of connective tissue. In <b>pelagic</b> <b>species</b> this tissue is gelatinous and buoyant.|$|E
5|$|Seabirds {{have made}} {{numerous}} adaptations to living on and feeding in the sea. Wing morphology {{has been shaped}} by the niche an individual species or family has evolved, so that looking at a wing's shape and loading can tell a scientist about its life feeding behaviour. Longer wings and low wing loading are typical of more <b>pelagic</b> <b>species,</b> while diving species have shorter wings. Species such as the wandering albatross, which forage over huge areas of sea, have a reduced capacity for powered flight and are dependent on a type of gliding called dynamic soaring (where the wind deflected by waves provides lift) as well as slope soaring. Seabirds also almost always have webbed feet, to aid movement on the surface as well as assisting diving in some species. The Procellariiformes are unusual among birds in having {{a strong sense of}} smell, which is used to find widely distributed food in a vast ocean, and possibly to locate their colonies.|$|E
25|$|Certain {{locations}} such as {{the local}} patch of forest, wetland and coast may be favoured according to the location and season. Seawatching {{is a type of}} birdwatching where observers based at a coastal watch point, such as a headland, watch birds flying over the sea. This is one form of pelagic birding, by which pelagic bird species are viewed. Another way birdwatchers view <b>pelagic</b> <b>species</b> is from seagoing vessels.|$|E

25|$|The {{saltwater}} crocodile {{is a large}} and opportunistic hypercarnivorous apex predator. Most prey are ambushed and then drowned or swallowed whole. It is capable of prevailing over almost any animal that enters its territory, including other apex predators such as sharks, varieties of freshwater and marine fish including <b>pelagic</b> <b>species,</b> invertebrates such as crustaceans, various reptiles, birds and mammals, including humans. Due to their size, aggression and distribution, {{saltwater crocodile}}s are regarded as the most dangerous extant crocodilian to humans, alongside the Nile crocodile.|$|E
25|$|Factors {{which have}} contributed to {{increasing}} catches of fish include {{an increasing number of}} mechanised and motorised boats, installation of fish aggregating devices which improve the efficiency of fishing activities, and improvements in infrastructure for collecting and handling the fish catch. Of the <b>pelagic</b> <b>species,</b> skipjack tuna has been almost exclusively exploited. The pelagic fisheries may have considerable expansion potential, especially further from the coast, targeting species such as yellowfin. Demersal and reef species can also be exploited at higher levels. At present, development is limited by limited local facilities for storing and transporting fish.|$|E
25|$|Species {{introductions}} {{have been}} increasing {{since at least}} the 19th century as a function of increasing trade and traffic. Introductions include numerous taxa, including copepods, shrimp, amphipods, bivalves, fish and both rooted and floating plants. Many <b>pelagic</b> <b>species</b> have been introduced most recently through ballast water releases from large ships directly into the estuary. As a result, many of these introduced species originate from estuaries around the Pacific Rim, particularly copepods such as P. forbesi and L. tetraspina. The Amur River clam originates from Asia, and has created significant and drastic changes to the ecology of the LSZ, primarily by diverting pelagic food to the benthos and into an accelerated microbial loop.|$|E

40|$|Proper handling, rapid {{chilling}} and storage of fish on boats ensure {{the quality of}} fish. In Sri Lanka, <b>pelagic</b> fatty <b>species</b> such as tuna and various small species sustain great post harvest losses as improper cooling and storage of fish on board boats. Therefore, effective cooling systems are needed {{to improve the quality}} of the fish. This study attempts to investigate the quality of a typical <b>pelagic</b> fatty <b>species,</b> herring, stored in three different cooling systems. The cooling systems were designed from ice and sea water (CSW), ice and fresh water (CFW) and pure ice. The chemical and microbiological parameters were monitored as indicators of quality changes of herring. The results of this study show rate of microbiological growth of herring in the CSW is slower than in pure ice. The fat and protein content of herring in the CSW system decreased more than in the pure ice system while the salt content increased steadily in CSW during storage. Herring in CSW system was of better quality during experiment.

25|$|According to the French Institute for Radiological Protection and Nuclear Safety, between 21March and mid-July around 27PBq of caesium-137 {{entered the}} ocean, about 82percent before 8April. This {{emission}} represents {{the most important}} individual oceanic emissions of artificial radioactivity ever observed. The Fukushima coast {{has one of the}} world's strongest currents (Kuroshio Current). It transported the contaminated waters far into the Pacific Ocean, dispersing the radioactivity. As of late 2011 measurements of both the seawater and the coastal sediments suggested that the consequences for marine life would be minor. Significant pollution along the coast near the plant might persist, because of the continuing arrival of radioactive material transported to the sea by surface water crossing contaminated soil. The possible presence of other radioactive substances, such as strontium-90 or plutonium, has not been sufficiently studied. Recent measurements show persistent contamination of some marine species (mostly fish) caught along the Fukushima coast. Migratory <b>pelagic</b> <b>species</b> are highly effective and rapid transporters of radioactivity throughout the ocean. Elevated levels of caesium-134 appeared in migratory species off the coast of California that were not seen pre-Fukushima.|$|E
25|$|Purse seiners {{are very}} {{effective}} at targeting aggregating <b>pelagic</b> <b>species</b> near the surface. The seiner circles the shoal {{with a deep}} curtain of netting, possibly using bow thrusters for better manoeuvrability. Then {{the bottom of the}} net is pursed (closed) underneath the fish shoal by hauling a wire running from the vessel through rings along the bottom of the net and then back to the vessel. The {{most important part of the}} fishing operation is searching for the fish shoals and assessing their size and direction of movement. Sophisticated electronics, such as echosounders, sonar, and track plotters, may be used are used to search for and track schools; assessing their size and movement and keeping in touch with the school while it is surrounded with the seine net. Crows nests may be built on the masts for further visual support. Large vessels can have observation towers and helicopter landing decks. Helicopters and spotter planes are used for detecting fish schools. The main types of purse seiners are the American seiners, the European seiners and the Drum seiners.|$|E

The longfin mako is a <b>pelagic</b> <b>species</b> found in moderately deep water, having been reported {{to a depth of}} [...] Growing to a maximum length of , the slimmer build and long, broad pectoral fins of this shark suggest that it is a slower and less active swimmer than the shortfin mako.|$|E
40|$|The {{sensitiveness}} {{of different}} demersal and <b>pelagic</b> fish <b>species</b> of 70 hauls in the North and Baltic Sea in water depths of 60 to 250 m and 15 to 80 m, respectively, amount of catch of 100 to 3500 kg and trawling times of 0, 5 to 6 h on {{board of the}} FRV “Walther Herwig III” was investigated. Some demersal fish species, e. g. saithe (Pollachius virens), were even still sensitive, when caught at a water depth of 250 m at a trawling time of 1, 5 h. Generally the number of sensitive fishes was reduced with increasing water depth, amount of catch, trawling time and following storage of the catch on board. Among demersal fishes the species without swimbladder and flat fishes were clearly more resistent to mechanical stress. On the contrary, <b>pelagic</b> fish <b>species</b> were generally less robust. After trawling times of 2 h no sensitive animals were observed. In some fisheries there are mixed catches of demersal and <b>pelagic</b> fish <b>species</b> with different sensitiveness. In commercial fisheries, there is therefore – under animal welfare aspects – for the time being, no prospect for an improvement of the catching and slaughtering procedure on boar...|$|R
40|$|The abundances and {{distributions}} of coastal <b>pelagic</b> fish <b>species</b> in the California Current Ecosystem from San Diego to southern Vancouver Island, were estimated from combined acoustic and trawl surveys {{conducted in the}} spring of 2006, 2008, and 2010. Pacific sardine (Sardinops sagax), jack mackerel (Trachurus symmetricus), and Pacific mackerel (Scomber japonicus) were the dominant coastal <b>pelagic</b> fish <b>species,</b> in that order. Northern anchovy (Engraulis mordax) and Pacific herring (Clupea pallasii) were sampled only sporadically and therefore estimates for these species were unreliable. The estimates of sardine biomass compared well with those of the annual assessments and confirmed a declining trajectory of the “northern stock” since 2006. During the sampling period, the biomass of jack mackerel was stable or increasing, and that of Pacific mackerel was low and variable. The uncertainties in these estimates are mostly the result of spatial patchiness which increased from sardine to mackerels to anchovy and herring. Future surveys of coastal <b>pelagic</b> fish <b>species</b> in the California Current Ecosystem should benefit from adaptive sampling based on modeled habitat; increased echosounder and trawl sampling, particularly for the most patchy and nearshore species; and directed-trawl sampling for improved species identification and estimations of their acoustic target stre...|$|R

500|$|The most <b>pelagic</b> <b>species,</b> {{mainly in}} the 'tubenose' order Procellariiformes, are great wanderers, and the {{albatrosses}} of the southern oceans may circle the globe as they ride the [...] "roaring forties" [...] outside the breeding season. The tubenoses spread widely over large areas of open ocean, but congregate when food becomes available. Many are also among the longest-distance migrants; sooty shearwaters Puffinus griseus nesting on the Falkland Islands migrate [...] between the breeding colony and the North Atlantic Ocean off Norway. Some Manx shearwaters Puffinus puffinus do this same journey in reverse.

2500|$|In exposed systems, wind {{can create}} turbulent, spiral-formed surface {{currents}} called Langmuir circulations (Fig. 3). [...] Exactly how these currents become established {{is still not}} well understood, but {{it is evident that}} it involves some interaction between horizontal surface currents and surface gravity waves. [...] The visible result of these rotations, which can be seen in any lake, are the surface foamlines that run parallel to the wind direction. [...] Positively buoyant particles and small organisms concentrate in the foamline at the surface and negatively buoyant objects are found in the upwelling current between the two rotations.
