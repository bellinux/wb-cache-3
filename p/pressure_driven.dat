This allows for improved power and torque, particularly at lower engine RPM, as well as improved fuel economy and reduced emissions.

50|$|Concentration {{polarization}} strongly {{affects the}} performance of the separation process. First, concentration changes in the solution reduce the driving force within the membrane, hence, the useful flux/rate of separation. In the case of <b>pressure</b> <b>driven</b> processes, this phenomenon causes an increase of the osmotic pressure gradient in the membrane, which reduces the net driving pressure gradient. In the case of dialysis, the driving concentration gradient in the membrane is reduced. In the case of electromembrane processes, the potential drop in the diffusion boundary layers reduces the gradient of electric potential in the membrane. Lower rate of separation under the same external driving force means increased power consumption.|$|E
50|$|An {{industrial}} {{filter press}} {{is a tool}} used in separation processes, specifically to separate solids and liquids.

50|$|The Mountain-Plain winds {{system is}} the largest scale {{phenomenon}} going across the mountain range. During daytime, incoming solar radiation heats up the mountain top faster than the plain, creating a mean low pressure zone at the top. Winds then blow towards the mountain on all sides, flow up the slope and converge at the top. A return flow occurs aloft and comes {{back down into the}} plains. The exact opposite happens during nighttime, when the top cools down faster than the plain, which creates a mean high pressure zone leading to winds coming from the mountain top down to the plain. This represents the idealized situation since many complications can arise from cross currents, forced or <b>pressure</b> <b>driven</b> channeling or even cold fronts approaching the mountain barrier.|$|E

5000|$|Avoiding {{the use of}} {{pressure}} to introduce the mobile phase into the column, results {{in a number of}} important advantages. Firstly, the <b>pressure</b> <b>driven</b> flow rate across a column depends directly on the square of the particle diameter and inversely on the length of the column. This restricts the length of the column and size of the particle, particle size is seldom less than 3 micrometer and the length of the column is restricted to 25 cm. Electrically driven flow rate is independent of length of column and size [...]A second advantage of using electroosmosis to pass the mobile phase into the column is the plug like flow velocity profile of EOF reduces the solute dispersion in the column, increasing column efficiency.|$|E

50|$|Membrane {{separation}} processes have a {{very important}} role in the separation industry. Nevertheless, they were not considered technically important until the mid-1970s. Membrane separation processes differ based on separation mechanisms and size of the separated particles. The widely used membrane processes include microfiltration, ultrafiltration, nanofiltration, reverse osmosis, electrolysis, dialysis, electrodialysis, gas separation, vapor permeation, pervaporation, membrane distillation, and membrane contactors. All processes except for pervaporation involve no phase change. All processes except (electro)dialysis are <b>pressure</b> <b>driven.</b> Microfltration and ultrafiltration is widely used in food and beverage processing (beer microfiltration, apple juice ultrafiltration), biotechnological applications and pharmaceutical industry (antibiotic production, protein purification), water purification and wastewater treatment, the microelectronics industry, and others. Nanofiltration and reverse osmosis membranes are mainly used for water purification purposes. Dense membranes are utilized for gas separations (removal of CO2 from natural gas, separating N2 from air, organic vapor removal from air or a nitrogen stream) and sometimes in membrane distillation. The later process helps in the separation of azeotropic compositions reducing the costs of distillation processes.|$|E
