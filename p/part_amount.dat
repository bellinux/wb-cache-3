6000|$|It {{remains to}} give an account of the Temporal Power, {{composed}} of the rich and the employers of labour, two classes who in M. Comte's system are reduced to one, for he allows of no idle rich. A life made up of mere amusement and self-indulgence, though not interdicted by law, is to be deemed so disgraceful, that nobody with the smallest sense of shame would choose to be guilty of it. Here, we think, M. Comte has lighted on a true principle, towards which the tone of opinion in modern Europe is more and more tending, and which is destined {{to be one of the}} constitutive principles of regenerated society. We believe, for example, with him, that in the future there will be no class of landlords living at ease on their rents, but every landlord will be a capitalist trained to agriculture, himself superintending and directing the cultivation of his estate. No one but he who guides the work, should have the control of the tools. In M. Comte's system, the rich, as a rule, consist of the [...] "captains of industry:" [...] but the rule is not entirely without exception, for M. Comte recognizes other useful modes of employing riches. In particular, one of his favourite ideas is that of an order of Chivalry, composed of the most generous and self-devoted of the rich, voluntarily dedicating themselves, like knights-errant of old, to the redressing of wrongs, and the protection of the weak and oppressed. He remarks, that oppression, in modern life, can seldom reach, or even venture to attack, the life or liberty of its victims (he forgets the case of domestic tyranny), but only their pecuniary means, and it is therefore by the purse chiefly that individuals can usefully interpose, as they formerly did by the sword. The occupation, however, of nearly all the rich, will be the direction of labour, and for this work they will be educated. Reciprocally, it is in M. Comte's opinion essential, that all directors of labour should be rich. Capital (in which he includes land) should be concentrated in a few holders, so that every capitalist may conduct the most extensive operations which one mind is capable of superintending. This is not only demanded by good economy, in order to take the utmost advantage of a rare kind of practical ability, but it necessarily follows from the principle of M. Comte's scheme, which regards a capitalist as a public functionary. M. Comte's conception of the relation of capital to society is essentially that of Socialists, but he would bring about by education and opinion, what they aim at effecting by positive institution. The owner of capital is by no means to consider himself its absolute proprietor. Legally he is not to be controlled in his dealings with it, for power should be in proportion to responsibility: but it does not belong to him for his own use; he is merely entrusted by society with a portion of the accumulations made by the past providence of mankind, to be administered for the benefit of the present generation and of posterity, under the obligation of preserving them unimpaired, and handing them down, more or less augmented, to our successors. He is not entitled to dissipate them, or divert them from the service of Humanity to his own pleasures. Nor has he a moral right to consume on himself the whole even of his profits. He is bound in conscience, if they exceed his reasonable wants, to employ the surplus in improving either the efficiency of his operations, or the physical and mental condition of his labourers. The portion of his gains which he may appropriate to his own use, must be decided by himself, under accountability to opinion; and opinion ought not to look very narrowly into the matter, nor hold him to a rigid reckoning for any moderate indulgence of luxury or ostentation; since under the great responsibilities that will be imposed on him, the position of an employer of labour will be so much less desirable, to any one in whom the instincts of pride and vanity are not strong, than the [...] "heureuse insouciance" [...] of a labourer, that those instincts must be to a certain degree indulged, or no one would undertake the office. With this limitation, every employer is a mere administrator of his possessions, for his work-people and for society at large. If he indulges himself lavishly, without reserving an ample remuneration for all who are employed under him, he is morally culpable, and will incur sacerdotal admonition. This state of things necessarily implies that capital should be in few hands, because, as M. Comte observes, without great riches, the obligations which society ought to impose, could not be fulfilled without an amount of personal abnegation that it would be hopeless to expect. If a person is conspicuously qualified for the conduct of an industrial enterprise, but destitute of the fortune necessary for undertaking it, M. Comte recommends that he should be enriched by subscription, or, in cases of sufficient importance, by the State. Small landed proprietors and capitalists, and the middle classes altogether, he regards as a parasitic growth, destined to disappear, the best of the body becoming large capitalists, and the remainder proletaires. Society will consist only of rich and poor, and it will be the business of the rich to make the best possible lot for the poor. The remuneration of the labourers will continue, as at present, to be a matter of voluntary arrangement between them and their employers, the last resort on either side being refusal of co-operation, [...] "refus de concours," [...] in other words, a strike or a lock-out; with the sacerdotal order for mediators in case of need. But though wages are to be an affair of free contract, their standard is not to be the competition of the market, but the application of the products in equitable proportion between the wants of the labourers and the wants and dignity of the employer. As it is one of M. Comte's principles that a question cannot be usefully proposed without an attempt at a solution, he gives his ideas from the beginning as to what the normal income of a labouring family should be. They are on such a scale, that until some great extension shall have taken place in the scientific resources of mankind, it is no wonder he thinks it necessary to limit as much as possible the number of those who are to be supported by what is left of the produce. In the first place the labourer's dwelling, which is to consist of seven rooms, is, with all that it contains, to be his own property: it is the only landed property he is allowed to possess, but every family should be the absolute owner of all things which are destined for its exclusive use. Lodging being thus independently provided for, and education and medical attendance being secured gratuitously by the general arrangements of society, the pay of the labourer is to consist of two portions, the one monthly, and of fixed amount, the other weekly, and proportioned to the produce of his labour. The former M. Comte fixes at 100 francs (£4) for a month of 28 days; being £52 a year: and the rate of piece-work should be such as to make the other <b>part</b> <b>amount</b> to an average of seven francs (5s. 6d.) per working day.|$|E

Estudos envolvendo os aspectos físicos da Bacia Hidrográfica do Córrego Marumbizinho são escassos. O estudo foi efetivado por meio do levantamento de dados bibliográfico-cartográficos e levantamento de campo. Para a manipulação dos dados foram empregados os softwares Spring e a planilha eletrônica Calc., sendo analisada uma série de parâmetros morfométricos da bacia hidrográfica. A área apresenta declividades acentuadas principalmente no entorno das nascentes que associados aos elevados índices pluviométricos da região e a área urbana favorecem processos de movimento de massa nas encostas e deposição de materiais tecnogênicos nos fundos do vale. A bacia é importante para a cidade haja vista ser {{a principal}} fonte de captação d”água para o abastecimento urbano. Dessa maneira o uso do solo deve ser planejado afim de não comprometer a qualidade da água e o regime fluvial da bacia hidrográfica.

40|$|Consider the {{utilization}} of a Lagrangian dual method which is convergent for consistent convex optimization problems. When {{it is used to}} solve an infeasible optimization problem, its inconsistency will then manifest itself through the divergence of the sequence of dual iterates. Will then the sequence of primal subproblem solutions still yield relevant information regarding the primal program? We answer this question in the affirmative for a convex program and an associated subgradient algorithm for its Lagrange dual. We show that the primal-dual pair of programs corresponding to an associated homogeneous dual function is in turn associated with a saddle-point problem, in which-in the inconsistent case-the primal <b>part</b> <b>amounts</b> to finding a solution in the primal space such that the Euclidean norm of the infeasibility in the relaxed constraints is minimized; the dual <b>part</b> <b>amounts</b> to identifying a feasible steepest ascent direction for the Lagrangian dual function. We present convergence results for a conditional epsilon-subgradient optimization algorithm applied to the Lagrangian dual problem, and the construction of an ergodic sequence of primal subproblem solutions; this composite algorithm yields convergence of the primal-dual sequence to the set of saddle-points of the associated homogeneous Lagrangian function; for linear programs, convergence to the subset in which the primal objective is at minimum is also achieved.

40|$|Abstract—We {{investigate}} {{the problem of}} sparse modeling for predictive coding and introduce an efficient algorithm for computing sparse stereo linear predictors for lossless audio com-pression. Sparse linear predictive coding offers both improved compression and reduction of decoding complexity compared with non-sparse linear predictive coding. The modeling <b>part</b> <b>amounts</b> to finding the optimal structure of a sparse linear predictor using a fully implementable minimum description length (MDL) ap-proach. TheMDL criterion, simplified conveniently under realistic assumptions, is approximately minimized by a greedy algorithm which solves sequentially least squares partial problems, where the factorization ensures numerically stable solutions and facilitates a quasi-optimal quantization of the parameter vector. The overall compression system built around this modeling tool is shown to achieve the main goals: improved compression and, even more importantly, faster decoding speeds than {{the state of the}} art lossless audio compression methods. The optimal MDL sparse predictors are shown to provide parametric spectra that consti-tute new alternative spectral descriptors, capturing important regularities missed by the optimal MDL non-sparse predictors.
