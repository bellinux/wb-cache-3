However, Avery's fastest 5-day march was 90 nautical miles, significantly short of the 135 claimed by Peary. Avery writes on his web site that [...] "The admiration and respect which I hold for Robert Peary, Matthew Henson and the four Inuit men who ventured North in 1909, has grown enormously since we set out from Cape Columbia. Having now seen for myself how he travelled across the pack ice, I am more convinced than ever that Peary did indeed discover the North Pole." ...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: With today's {{electric}} charging technology, {{charging time}} {{of an electric}} vehicle (EV) is much longer than that for a gasoline vehicle, and therefore the queueing effect at an EV charging station (CS) may be serious. That is, when an EV arrives at an overloaded CS, {{it is likely that}} the EV will wait for a long time before it is charged. This paper investigates the waiting problem for EV charging. We propose a Mobile CS (MCS) management system to dynamically distribute charging <b>pole</b> <b>support</b> that reduces the waiting times of EVs incurred in a fixed CS. A Mobile Charging Information Management System (MC-IMS) is presented to describe the execution flow of the MCS service. Simulation experiments are conducted to investigate the waiting time performance for the proposed mechanism. Our study indicates that the MCS-based MC-IMS provides effective EV charging with short waiting times.

A calculation model of string branch grid was founded. Static and dynamic characteristics of the structure that it was acted by different pre-stress value were analyzed. Through the analysis, the structure displacement and internal forces of rod are improved obviously depending on pre-stress value. The pre-stress value is larger, structure displacement and internal forces of rod are lower. Natural vibration characteristics of the structure are almost not changing, while pre-stress value is changing. When the structure is time history analysis, its response curve accords with general law of structural vibration. Node displacement response of up and bottom chord nodes are not occurred retardation effect...|$|E
40|$|International audienceA good {{understanding}} of the mechanics of pole vaulting is fundamental to performance because this event is quite complex, with several factors occurring in sequence and/or in parallel. These factors mainly concern the velocities of the vaulter-pole system, the kinetic and potential energy of the vaulter and the strain energy stored in the pole, the force and torque applied by the athlete, and the pole design. Although the pole vault literature is vast, encompassing several fields such as medicine, sports sciences, mechanics, mathematics, and physics, the studies agree that pole vault performance is basically influenced by the energy exchange between the vaulter and pole. Ideally, as the athlete clears the crossbar, the vaulter mechanical energy must be composed of high potential energy and low kinetic energy, guaranteeing the high vertical component of the vault. Moreover, the force and torque applied by the vaulter influences this energy exchange and these factors thus {{must be taken into}} consideration in the analysis of performance. This review presents the variables that influence pole vault performance during the run-up, take-off, <b>pole</b> <b>support,</b> and free flight phases...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{and explains}} {{the changes in}} kinetic energy, gravitational potential energy, elastic energy, and muscular work during a pole vault. Measurements of a skilled pole vaulter show that the height cleared by the athlete increases linearly with increasing run-up velocity and that this height increase is achieved {{through a combination of}} a higher grip on the pole and a greater push height above the pole. The athlete has a net energy gain during the vault. Although the energy lost during the take-off increases with increasing run-up velocity, this loss is not sufficient to negate the increase in run-up kinetic energy and the work done by the athlete during the <b>pole</b> <b>support</b> phase. 1 Pole vaulting The pole vault is a physically and technically demanding event that requires consid-erable ability in sprinting, jumping, and gymnastics (Figure 1).

40|$|This study {{examined}} the effect of run-up velocity on the peak height achieved by the athlete in the pole vault and on the corresponding changes in the athlete’s kinematics and energy exchanges. Seventeen jumps by an experienced male pole vaulter were video recorded in the sagittal plane and {{a wide range of}} run-up velocities (4. 5 – 8. 5 m/s) was obtained by setting the length of the athlete’s run-up (2 – 16 steps). A selection of performance variables, kinematic variables, energy variables, and pole variables were calculated from the digitized video data. We found that the athlete’s peak height increased linearly at a rate of 0. 54 m per 1 m/s increase in run-up velocity and this increase was achieved through a combination of a greater grip height and a greater push height. At the athlete’s competition run-up velocity (8. 4 m/s) about one third of the rate of increase in peak height arose from an increase in grip height and about two thirds arose from an increase in push height. Across the range of run-up velocities examined here the athlete always performed the basic actions of running, planting, jumping, and inverting on the pole. However, he made minor systematic changes to his jumping kinematics, vaulting kinematics, and selection of pole characteristics as the run-up velocity increased. The increase in run-up velocity and changes in the athlete’s vaulting kinematics resulted in substantial changes to the magnitudes of the energy exchanges during the vault. A faster run-up produced a greater loss of energy during the take-off, but this loss was not sufficient to negate the increase in run-up velocity and the increase in work done by the athlete during the <b>pole</b> <b>support</b> phase. The athlete therefore always had a net energy gain during the vault. However, the magnitude of this gain decreased slightly as run-up velocity increased.
