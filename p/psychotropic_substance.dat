25|$|From {{the late}} 1960s onwards, several studies {{attempted}} to establish soma as a <b>psychotropic</b> <b>substance.</b> A number of proposals were made, included {{an important one}} in 1968 by Robert Gordon Wasson, an amateur mycologist, who (on Vedic evidence) asserted that soma was an inebriant, and suggested fly-agaric mushroom, Amanita muscaria, as the likely candidate. Wasson and his co-author, Wendy Doniger O'Flaherty, drew parallels between Vedic descriptions and reports of Siberian uses of the fly-agaric in shamanic ritual. Furthermore, the mountainous origin of soma matches the habitat of fly-agaric, and when discussing soma, the Vedas do not mention any part of a flowering tree.|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} the {{negotiation}} of police officers from Riot Police Services with people {{under the influence of}} narcotic and <b>psychotropic</b> <b>substances.</b> These individuals often become perpetrators of offenses and narcotic and <b>psychotropic</b> <b>substances</b> also have an impact of this fact, because they cause changes in human personality. The work has two main parts - a theoretical part and a practical part. The theoretical section contains information about narcotic and <b>psychotropic</b> <b>substances,</b> their use in the Czech Republic, as well as Czech drug policy and prevention. A crime committed by people under the influence of narcotic and <b>psychotropic</b> <b>substances</b> is also described as well as the personality of the offending drug addict. The last chapter of this section includes information about police and police procedure when dealing with a person under the influence of narcotic and <b>psychotropic</b> <b>substances</b> as well as the peculiarities of questioning people under the influence of narcotic and <b>psychotropic</b> <b>substances.</b> The practical part consists of quantitative research carried out by the group of 51 police officers who work in the South Bohemian region in the Riot Police Services. The research covers issues related to the conduct of police officers towards people under the influence of narcotic and <b>psychotropic</b> <b>substances.</b> The method of interrogation and questioning techniques were used for the collection of data. The main objectives of the study were to determine the facts, whether or not and how often respondents work with people under the influence of narcotic and <b>psychotropic</b> <b>substances,</b> whether or not the negotiations with these people are specific and how specific are they. Another objective was {{to determine the extent of}} respondents' knowledge of drug problems.
