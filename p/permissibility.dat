5|$|The States may, if they wish, permit {{abortion}} on demand, but the Constitution {{does not require}} them to do so. The <b>permissibility</b> of abortion, and the limitations upon it, are to be resolved like most important questions in our democracy: by citizens trying to persuade one another and then voting.|$|E
5|$|A {{number of}} {{questions}} are raised within the philosophy of suicide, included what constitutes suicide, whether or not suicide can be a rational choice, and the moral <b>permissibility</b> of suicide. Arguments as to acceptability of suicide in moral or social terms range from {{the position that the}} act is inherently immoral and unacceptable under any circumstances to a regard for suicide as a sacrosanct right of anyone who believes they have rationally and conscientiously come to the decision to end their own lives, even if they are young and healthy.|$|E
5|$|The Angevin-Neapolitan {{influence}} of Celestine {{was evident in}} his first consistory, during which he created twelve cardinals, including seven Frenchmen and three (or five) Neapolitans. This {{was the first time}} in history where a single consistory had swung the College of Cardinals so decidedly in one nationalist partisan direction. The cardinals who were not French or Angevin were members of Celestine's former order. Celestine also moved to the Castel Nuovo in Naples, where he continued to live much like a hermit until he resigned, as advocated by many Roman cardinals, including Benedetto Gaetani (who, a former lawyer, suggested that Celestine first publish a decree establishing the <b>permissibility</b> of papal abdication.) Gaetani, elected Pope Boniface VIII following Celestine's abdication, proceeded to have Celestine imprisoned while the legality of his abdication remained a prominent subject, and Celestine died a prisoner in 1296.|$|E
25|$|Some {{conservative}} translations suggest Muslim husbands {{are permitted}} to use light force on their wives, and others claim <b>permissibility</b> to strike, hit, chastise, or beat. The relationship between Islam and domestic violence is disputed by some Islamic scholars.|$|E
25|$|Despite {{injunctions}} against silk for men, silk {{has retained}} its {{popularity in the}} Islamic world because of its <b>permissibility</b> for women, and due {{to the presence of}} non-Muslim communities. The Muslim Moors brought silk with them to Spain during their conquest of the Iberian Peninsula.|$|E
25|$|The Śramaṇic traditions have {{a diverse}} range of beliefs, ranging from {{accepting}} or denying the concept of soul, fatalism to free will, idealization of extreme asceticism to that of family life, wearing dress to complete nudity in daily social life, strict ahimsa (non-violence) and vegetarianism to <b>permissibility</b> of violence and meat-eating.|$|E
25|$|The rotary {{electric}} shaver {{was invented by}} a Jewish engineer named Alexandre Horowitz. Many Orthodox Jews prefer to grow beards, {{for a variety of}} religious, social, and cultural reasons, even if they believe that {{electric shaver}}s would be permitted; many Orthodox Jews, even non-Haredi Orthodox Jews, today grow beards to keep the tradition of their ancestors, regardless of the <b>permissibility</b> of their removal.|$|E
25|$|Public women's prayer services, {{as well as}} women's {{participation}} in standard public services, are both innovations over the past generation. Many rabbis have weighed in on their <b>permissibility.</b> The permitting rabbis have interpreted various earlier talmudic and halachic sources to either provide conceptual or indirect support for public women's prayer. Other rabbis have analyzed these arguments, and raised various forms of refutation.|$|E
25|$|The logician Deng Xi(died 501 BCE) {{is cited}} by Liu Xiang for {{the origin of}} the {{principle}} of Xing-Ming. Serving as a minor official in the state of Zheng, he is reported to have drawn up a code of penal laws. Associated with litigation, he is said to have argued for the <b>permissibility</b> of contradictory propositions, likely engaging in hair-splitting debates on the interpretation of laws, legal principles and definitions.|$|E
25|$|One of {{the verses}} of the Quran {{relating}} to <b>permissibility</b> {{of domestic violence}} is Surah 4:34. In deference to Surah 4:34, many nations with Shari'a law have refused to consider or prosecute cases of domestic abuse. Shari'a {{has been criticized for}} ignoring women's rights in domestic abuse cases. Musawah, CEDAW, KAFA and other organizations have proposed ways to modify Shari'a-inspired laws to improve women's rights in Islamic nations, including women's rights in domestic abuse cases.|$|E
25|$|Justice Rehnquist, in a {{separate}} dissent, sharply criticized the Court's decision. Rehnquist pointed out that, while {{the issue of whether}} corporations had the right to voice their opinions on political issues was new to the Court, the constitutional <b>permissibility</b> of restrictions on such speech had been considered and approved by Congress and over thirty states. He argued that this consensus by so many governmental institutionals should not be ignored in the Court's decision.|$|E
25|$|Previous {{studies on}} {{anaphora}} focused on coreference instead of bound anaphora, which dictated groupings of anaphora facts {{in a specific}} way. Reinhart states that previous analyses focusing primarily on coreference would determine the <b>permissibility</b> of examples (16)-(18) in three different ways. Group (16) would be classified as cases where definite NP coreference is allowed. Definite NP coreference would be deemed impossible in group (17). Finally, group (18) would require special treatment since it deals with cases of quantified NP anaphora. By following these coreference rules, Reinhart notes that examples (16)–(18) would not constitute well-formed sentences.|$|E
25|$|The <b>permissibility</b> of {{depictions of}} Muhammad in Islam {{has been a}} {{contentious}} issue. Oral and written descriptions of Muhammad are readily accepted by all traditions of Islam, but there is disagreement about visual depictions. The Quran does not explicitly forbid images of Muhammad, {{but there are a}} few hadith (supplemental teachings) which have explicitly prohibited Muslims from creating visual depictions of figures. It is agreed on all sides that there is no authentic visual tradition as to the appearance of Muhammad, although there are early legends of portraits of him, and written physical descriptions whose authenticity is often accepted.|$|E
25|$|Until 1914, the American {{judicial}} system, {{including the}} Supreme Court of the United States, largely followed the precepts of English common law {{when it came}} to matters dealing with the validity of introducing evidence in criminal trials. In most cases, the general philosophy was that the process by which the evidence was obtained had little, if {{anything to do with the}} <b>permissibility</b> of its use in court. The only limiting factor was that the police agents could not break the law to seize the evidence; however, since what is now illegal seizure was then permitted by the courts, it rarely presented a significant challenge.|$|E
25|$|In Islamic teachings, Muslim men are {{forbidden}} to wear silk. Many religious jurists believe the reasoning behind the prohibition lies in avoiding clothing for men that can be considered feminine or extravagant. There are disputes regarding the amount of silk a fabric can consist of (e.g., whether a small decorative silk piece on a cotton caftan is permissible or not) {{for it to be}} lawful for men to wear, but the dominant opinion of most Muslim scholars is that the wearing of silk by men is forbidden. Modern attire has raised a number of issues, including, for instance, the <b>permissibility</b> of wearing silk neckties, which are masculine articles of clothing.|$|E
25|$|Given the era and {{the fact}} that both Christian and Jewish {{tradition}} outlawed contraception, the attitude of Muslims towards birth control has been characterised as being remarkably pragmatic; they also possessed a sophisticated knowledge of possible birth control methods. Medieval doctors like Ibn Sina (Avicenna) regarded birth control as a normal part of medicine, and devoted chapters to contraception and abortion in their textbooks (although {{it should be noted that}} the <b>permissibility</b> of abortion within Islamic thought varies according to a number of factors; Islam views the family as sacred and children as a gift from God). According to medieval Muslims, birth control was employed to avoid a large number of dependants; to safeguard property; to guarantee the education of a child; to protect a woman from the risks of childbirth, especially if she was young or ill; or simply to preserve her health and beauty.|$|E
25|$|The {{classical}} rabbinical writers {{imply that}} milk from an animal whose meat is kosher is also kosher. As animals are considered non-kosher if after being slaughtered they are discovered {{to have been}} diseased, this could make their milk retroactively non-kosher. However, by adhering to the principle that the majority case overrules the exception, Jewish tradition continues to regard such milk as kosher, since statistically {{it is true that}} most animals producing such milk are kosher; the same principle is not applied to the possibility of consuming meat from an animal which has not been checked for disease. Rabbi Hershel Schachter, a prominent rosh yeshiva at Yeshiva University, has made the bold claim that with modern dairy farm equipment, milk from the minority of nonkosher cows is invariably mixed with that of the majority of kosher cows, thus invalidating the <b>permissibility</b> of consuming milk from a large dairy operation; the Orthodox Union, however, released a statement declaring the milk permissible based on some leniencies.|$|E
25|$|Ghulam Ahmad was a {{prolific}} author and wrote more than ninety books on various religious, theological and moral subjects between {{the publication of}} the first volume of Barahin-i-Ahmadiyya (The Proofs of Islam, his first major work) in 1880 and his death in May 1908. Many of his writings bear a polemical and apologetic tone in favour of Islam, seeking to establish its superiority as a religion through rational argumentation, often by articulating his own interpretations of Islamic teachings. He advocated a peaceful propagation of Islam and emphatically argued against the <b>permissibility</b> of military Jihad under circumstances prevailing in the present age. By the time of his death, he had gathered an estimated 400,000 followers, especially within the United Provinces, the Punjab and Sindh and had built a dynamic religious organisation with an executive body and its own printing press. After his death he was succeeded by his close companion Hakīm Noor-ud-Dīn who assumed the title of Khalīfatul Masīh (successor of the Messiah).|$|E
25|$|A {{far more}} {{comprehensive}} approbation {{was given by}} Rabbi Aaron Chorin of Arad. Chorin was a well-known maverick; Samet noted that unlike many colleagues who harbored maskilic sympathies, he did not keep his to himself. Since a rabbinic tribunal had him recant in 1806, under the pain of being declared a heretic and have his beard shaved, he clashed repeatedly with other decisors, adopting glaringly lenient positions. His only patron was Rabbi Moses Münz of Óbuda. When hearing of Liebermann's lettres, Münz warned Chorin to steer clear from the controversy, yet the latter ignored him. The rabbi of Arad composed a long, enthusiastic responsa, in which he fervently supported reform efforts, stating that he long regarded the noise and disorder in synagogues a great ill. While recommending they teach their sons the Holy Tongue, he noted that legal sources were quite clear on the <b>permissibility</b> of vernacular liturgy. He also allowed Sephardi pronunciation and separate prayer gatherings. Regarding the organ, he cited the same arguments that Samun and Recanati evoked. He also turned to two minority opinions mentioned in Orach Chayim 338:2 and 339:3, that sanctioned music on the Sabbath.|$|E
500|$|The fatwa {{also allowed}} Spain's Muslims to consume wine, pork, {{and other things}} {{normally}} forbidden by the sharia, {{as long as the}} Muslims did not intend to take advantage of them and rejected them in their hearts. The fatwa reaffirmed the <b>permissibility</b> of a Muslim man marrying a Christian woman, under the reasoning that both Muslims and Christians were People of the Book. Marriage between a Muslim woman and a Christian man was to be avoided unless under duress, and while doing so the Muslims should [...] "cleave firmly to the belief that that is forbidden".|$|E
500|$|Clifton and Ebert, too, {{focussed}} on Cochrane's {{attempt to}} find and conceptualise a middle ground between the work of Regan (who advocates animal rights) and Singer (who advocates animal welfare from a utilitarian perspective), and Meijer praised it for identifying a conceptual space between animal rights and animal liberation. Clifton suggested that Cochrane's thought is actually closer to Regan's. Boisseau, though, suggested that, given that Cochrane allows some use of animals in entertainment and genetic engineering, the arguments of Animal Rights Without Liberation may come across as [...] "radically permissive" [...] when {{compared with those of}} other animal rights positions. The <b>permissibility</b> of some forms of animal experimentation under Cochrane's account [...] "may shock" [...] supporters of approaches based upon Regan's philosophy. Ebert concluded that [...] "the great accomplishment of Cochrane's book is to show that there is a coherent, intuitively plausible, and useful notion of animal rights that is firmly rooted in the tangible and avoids the unattractive absolutism of Regan-style rights views". Meijer felt that the book is strong on the application of Cochrane's account, but she expressed concern about Cochrane's rejection of liberty rights for animals, which, she noted, most approaches to animal rights allow. Cochrane's deploys, she noted, a narrow account of animal agency; [...] "it is", she argued, [...] "problematic to view humans as autonomous agents and other animals as nonautonomous others". Cochrane's view of animals as non-autonomous, she argued, is emphasised by the absence of an account of relationships and communication between humans and animals.|$|E
