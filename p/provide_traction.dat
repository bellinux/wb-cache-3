5|$|Dark Forces {{gameplay}} expands on the FPS {{standards set}} by Doom in 1993, and features gameplay elements that are now common in the FPS genre. These include the ability to look up and down, duck, and jump. A variety of power-ups are {{made available to the}} player, including health, shields, weapons and ammunition. The game also features several non-combat items to aid the player. The head lamp illuminates the area in front of the player, but will reveal the player's position to enemies in dark rooms. Ice cleats <b>provide</b> <b>traction</b> in icy areas, and an air mask protects the player from areas with toxic atmosphere. Many inventory items are powered by batteries (separate from weapon ammunition types) which can be found around the levels.|$|E
5|$|The {{count of}} dorsal scales, from axilla (armpit) to groin, averages 32 {{with a range}} of 30 to 35. The ventral count from axilla to groin along the midventral line averages 28 scales and ranges from 26 to 29. The scales around the midbody average {{approximately}} 52 and range from 50 to 55. There are two postnasals and one to three (usually two) internasal scales. There are two to three (usually three) scales from the upper lip to the eye (upper labials). On the fourth toe of the right foot, there are eight or nine (usually eight) lamellae, or plate-like scales that <b>provide</b> <b>traction</b> for geckos. The escutcheons (scales around the genital region) are relatively small and only slightly extend onto the thighs, varying from three to five scales in length and 11 to 13 scales in width.|$|E
500|$|The Metropolitan {{initially}} ordered 18 tank locomotives, {{of which}} a key feature was condensing equipment which prevented most of the steam from escaping while trains were in tunnels; they {{have been described as}} [...] "beautiful little engines, painted green and distinguished particularly by their enormous external cylinders." [...] The design proved so successful that eventually 120 were built to <b>provide</b> <b>traction</b> on the Metropolitan, the District Railway (in 1871) and all other 'cut and cover' underground lines. This 4-4-0 tank engine can therefore be considered as the pioneer motive power on London's first underground railway; ultimately, 148 were built between 1864 and 1886 for various railways, and most kept running until electrification in 1905.|$|E
50|$|In Belgium, {{the company}} UCA {{produces}} the UCA-TRAC, rail/road vehicles {{based on the}} chassis of a JCB Load-All (UCA-TRAC B) and JCB Fastrac (UCA-TRAC F). The UCA-TRAC <b>provides</b> <b>traction</b> through its rubber wheels.|$|R

500|$|Railroads have {{traditionally}} employed {{two types of}} snow plows for clearing track, the wedge plow, which casts snow to both sides, and the rotary snowplow, which is suited for addressing heavy snowfall and casting snow far to {{one side or the}} other. Prior to the invention of the rotary snowplow ca. 1865, it required multiple locomotives to drive a wedge plow through deep snow. Subsequent to clearing the track with such plows, a [...] "flanger" [...] is used to clear snow from between the rails that are below the reach of the other types of plow. Where icing may affect the steel-to-steel contact of locomotive wheels on track, abrasives (typically sand) have been used to <b>provide</b> <b>traction</b> on steeper uphills.|$|E

2500|$|Cross-country skiers use a grip wax (also called [...] "kick wax") for classic-style waxable skis to <b>provide</b> <b>traction</b> with static {{friction}} {{on the snow}} {{that allows them to}} propel themselves forward on flats and up hills. They are applied in an area beneath the skier's foot and extending, somewhat forward, that is formed by the camber of the classic ski, called the [...] "grip zone" [...] (or [...] "kick zone"). The presence of camber allows the skis to grip the snow, when the weight is on one ski and the ski is fully flexed, but minimize drag when the skis are weighted equally and are thus less than fully flexed. [...] Grip waxes are designed for specific temperature ranges and types of snow; a correctly selected grip wax does not appreciably decrease the glide of skis that have proper camber for the skier's weight and for the snow conditions. There are two substances used for grip wax: hard wax and klister.|$|E
500|$|Because the {{traction}} {{of rubber}} tires was unknown, Haynes completed {{a series of}} tests with a bicycle on paved roads. He used a wagon built to the weight of his automobile and a horse to pull a device that would cause the wheels to turn, thereby <b>providing</b> <b>traction.</b> With this, he was able to determine the ratio of weight to gear sizes needed to enable the tires to <b>provide</b> sufficient <b>traction</b> for propulsion. Once completed, his vehicle weighed about [...]|$|R
50|$|The tread of a tire or track {{refers to}} the rubber on its {{circumference}} that makes contact with the road or the ground. As tires are used, the tread is worn off, limiting its effectiveness in <b>providing</b> <b>traction.</b> A worn tire can often be retreaded.|$|R

2500|$|However, {{a man by}} {{the name}} of Sherman Poppen, from Muskegon, MI, came up with what most {{consider}} the first [...] "snowboard" [...] in 1965 and was called the Snurfer (a blend of [...] "snow" [...] and [...] "surfer") who sold his first 4 [...] "snurfers" [...] to Randall Baldwin Lee of Muskegon, MI who worked at Outdoorsman Sports Center 605 Ottawa Street in Muskegon, MI (owned by Justin and Richard Frey or Muskegon). Randy believes that Sherman took an old water ski and made it into the snurfer for his children who were bored in the winter. [...] He added bindings to keep their boots secure. (Randy Lee, October 14, 2014) Commercially available Snurfers in the late 1960s and early 1970s had no bindings. The snowboarder held onto a looped nylon lanyard attached to the front of the Snurfer, and stood upon several rows of square U-shaped staples that were partially driven into the board but protruded about 1cm above the board's surface to <b>provide</b> <b>traction</b> even when packed with snow. Later Snurfer models replaced the staples with ridged rubber grips running longitudinally along the length of the board (originally) or, subsequently, as subrectangular pads upon which the snowboarder would stand. It is widely accepted that Jake Burton Carpenter (founder of Burton Snowboards) and/or Tom Sims (founder of Sims Snowboards) invented modern snowboarding by introducing bindings and steel edges to snowboards.|$|E
2500|$|Westinghouse {{developed}} the XD-323 rotary accelerator for motor control with 99 points; it {{was installed in}} the first PRCo car, #100, and minor modifications allowed use in the last PCCs produced in North America for San Francisco in 1952. [...] Prior streetcar control, existing from the 1890s, required a standing operator at a three foot high vertical [...] "switch stand" [...] to rotate a handle to one of six brass points mounted within the stand to <b>provide</b> <b>traction</b> motor control and acceleration. The PCC had its accelerator under the floor where the pedal activated linkage to resistance ribbons were mounted to each PCC point around the outside edge of the accelerator. [...] An arm rotating in the center had rollers on either end which cut out resistance alternately as it rotated approximately 180 degrees. [...] This same accelerator was also used for dynamic braking; when the power pedal was released the accelerator sought optimum braking for the speed, which prevented a lag when the brake pedal was depressed. [...] General Electric Developed a control system for PCC cars that mirrored the Westinghouse scheme in function, although not in simplicity or maintainability. [...] With the GE commutator motor controller operating by air pressure, {{it had to be}} redesigned {{with the advent of the}} All-Electric PCC. [...] Acceleration was variable between 1.5- and 4.75-mph per second depending upon the depression of the power pedal with the accelerator advanced automatically by a low-voltage pilot motor. [...] Service braking was also variable and the maximum dynamic application decreased speed by 4.75-mph/s; pressing the brake pedal into emergency also brought the friction and magnetic brakes into play providing a maximum deceleration of 9.0-mph/s. [...] Compared to a maximum of 14 points on old time equipment, the PCC was considerably smoother.|$|E

2500|$|Footwear such as {{a tennis}} shoe or a hiking boot is {{considered}} inappropriate for riding both because the shoe {{has little or no}} raised heel and because the heavy tread that <b>provides</b> <b>traction</b> for athletic endeavors can cause the foot to catch in the stirrup and become trapped. [...] Modern synthetic materials have allowed the design of riding boots that will slide from a stirrup but are also comfortable for walking, with a sole using varying hard and soft materials that <b>provides</b> reasonable <b>traction</b> with a minimal amount of raised tread.|$|R

50|$|Even {{though it}} was {{foreseeable}} that more of this class of locomotives could be built, in 1968 the first representatives of the Class 218 were built with a single diesel engine (of 2500 hp) <b>providing</b> <b>traction</b> and electrical heating power in one unit. Thus no more of this variant were made, since the single-engined variant presented a clear reduction in maintenance costs.|$|R
