Sampling of mysids {{has been carried}} out over a period of one year from March 2014 to February 2015 to study the seasonal availability and population structure. Monthly samples of mysids consisted of individuals in various developmental stages, from juveniles to mature mysids around the year, but their <b>percentage</b> <b>availability</b> varied. The peak availability of mysids was recorded during September (2014) (avg. 48, 731 numbers per haul) and their availability was lowest in July (2014) with an average of 2 individuals per haul. The availability of brooding or ovigerous females were observed throughout the year and highest and lowest <b>percentage</b> <b>availability</b> was during November (2014) and April (2014) respectively. Morphometric measurements of E. simulans revealed that their average size (TL) ranged from 2. 35 ± 0. 52 mm- (juvenile) to 7. 47 ± 1. 75 mm (adult). Sex could be first distinguished externally when mysid attains the total length between 4. 1 mm and 5 mm. Analysis of variance of different water quality parameters and mysid density comparing seasons revealed that there was significant variation of mysid availability between seasons (P < 0. 05).

40|$|Objectives: Continuous {{availability}} of affordable medicines in appropriate formulations {{is essential to}} reduce morbidity and mortality in children. Odisha an eastern Indian state records very high mortality of children. The study aims at documenting the availability and prices paid for purchasing essential child-specific medicines. Materials and Methods: The survey of 34 essential medicines was conducted in six randomly selected districts of Odisha. Data were collected from medicine outlets of the public, private, and other sector (Nongovernmental Organization [NGO]/mission sectors) of six randomly selected districts, using WHO/Health Action International medicine price collection methodology. For each medicine surveyed, data were collected on the highest and lowest-priced formulations available in each facility. Results: Both public sector and other sector health facilities procure only one brand of medicines, mean <b>percentage</b> <b>availability</b> of medicines being 17 % and 21. 8 %, respectively. In the private sector, the mean <b>percentage</b> <b>availability</b> of the high and lowest-priced medicines for a particular drug product was 10. 8 % and 38. 5 %, respectively. The public sector procurement price is 48 % lower than international reference prices. In the private sector, high-priced, and low-priced products are sold at 1. 83 and 1. 46 times the international reference price, respectively. Substantial price variation was observed for some medicines across individual outlets. Medicines were found to cost 2. 08 times their international reference price in NGO/mission sector facilities. Conclusions: The {{availability of}} children's medicines in public sector facilities of Odisha state is poor. Medicines for children cost relatively high in both private and NGO sectors compared to the international reference price.

40|$|A {{comprehensive}} second law {{analysis of}} combustion {{for a range}} of conditions and fuels was completed. Constant pressure, constant volume and constant temperature combustion processes were examined. The parameters studied were reactant temperature, reactant pressure, equivalence ratio and the fuels themselves. In addition, the contribution and relative significance of the various components (thermo-mechanical, reactive and diffusion) to the mixture availability was examined. Also, the effect of reactant mixture dissociation was incorporated into the combustion analysis. It was found that for similar initial conditions, constant pressure combustion and constant volume combustion exhibited similar trends. For constant temperature combustion, the trend is significantly different from the constant pressure and constant volume combustion, with almost the entire reactant availability being destroyed due to combustion at lower temperatures. Amongst the parameters examined, reactant mixture temperature had the most significant effect on the fraction of availability destroyed during combustion. The <b>percentage</b> <b>availability</b> destroyed reduced from 25 to 30 % at 300 K to about 5 % at 6000 K for constant pressure and constant volume combustion processes. The effect of the reactant mixture pressure on the fraction of availability destroyed was more modest. The values for the <b>percentage</b> <b>availability</b> destroyed for pressures ranging from 50 kPa to 5000 kPa were found to lie within a range of 5 %. The effect of equivalence ratio on the fraction of reactant mixture availability destroyed was also documented. In general, {{it was found that the}} destruction of availability decreased with increasing equivalence ratios. This value, however, accounts for the availability due to fuel like species in the product mixture. Therefore, for practical applications, combustion of the stoichiometric mixture would be preferred over the rich equivalence ratios. It was found that the fraction of reactant availability destroyed increased with increasing complexity of the fuel??s molecular structure. In addition, it was shown that the diffusion availability terms is small and may be neglected, while the reactive availability and thermo-mechanical availability are more significant...|$|E

40|$|Background: Medicines {{procurement}} {{processes in}} the public health facilities (PHFs) in Tanzania are characterized by two main procurement systems, the centralized and decentralized procurement systems. Policy for medicines procurement is in favour of the centralized procurement system, managed by the Medical Stores Department (MSD). Despite much effort of improving the access of medicines in the public health facilities, prices of medicines have remained substantially high for individuals to afford. Objective: The main objective of the survey was to assess medicines procurement price, availability and distribution of medicines in the centralized and decentralized procurement systems in the public health facilities in Dar es Salaam region. Methods: The study was an explorative cross-sectional survey that applies both quantitative and qualitative approaches to determine medicine procurement price of the centralized and decentralized systems, investigate the medicines availability in the selected public hospitals and asses the efficiency of distribution systems. Results: The result shows that median <b>percentage</b> <b>availability</b> of medicines in the hospital was 72. 5 %. Overall median <b>percentage</b> <b>availability</b> of each individual medicine in the surveyed hospitals was 71. 4 %. The average median stock-out days per year was 97. 2. The median decentralize, centralised and international reference prices were, Tshs 122. 5, 77. 7 and 63. 35 respectively. MPR of the decentralized to international reference prices, centralized to international reference prices, and the decentralized to centralize procurement prices, the ratios were, 1. 92, 1. 1, and 1. 85 respectively. Conclusion: Findings of the study revealed that, availability of medicines is fairly high in public hospitals during day of data collection but high stock out {{for the past six}} months of review. There is no statistical significant difference in median prices across all procurement systems. However, there was statistical significance difference in MPRs of medicines procurement prices across the categories. The centralized procurement prices were reasonably cheaper compared to decentralized and international reference prices. Low order fulfilment rate in the centralized procurement and high supplier procurement lead time in the decentralized procurement systems are the factor contributing to the fairly high availability and stock out of medicines in the public hospitals...|$|E

40|$|International audienceFade {{mitigation}} techniques on Earth-satellite links {{require the}} estimation of channel propagation conditions. This is generally done by using downlink measurements at a lower frequency to derive the channel uplink propagation conditions at higher frequencies. Moreover, when atmospheric conditions are changing, the ground stations have to change their own configuration (increase or decrease transmit power and/or data rates for example). These changes involve estimating the uplink propagation conditions in advance. The proposed algorithm allows the margin to be estimated a few seconds in advance from the downlink so that a given <b>percentage</b> of <b>availability</b> of the uplink is reached. For that purpose, {{we have used a}} recently developed prediction method based on an ARMA/GARCH model (de Montera et al., 2008) and scaling frequency models. From the downlink attenuation, first the attenuation is first predicted with a prediction horizon ranging between 2 and 30 seconds. The contributions of gases, clouds and rain are then estimated using a neural network (Barthes et al., 2006) and scaled using specific scaling factors. Finally, the attenuation and its variance for the uplink are estimated and the margin is derived. This algorithm allows an accurate upper-bound of the future attenuation to be estimated in real time, which minimizes the cost of fade mitigation techniques and therefore enables the communication system to reach an appropriate <b>percentage</b> of <b>availability.</b> After a presentation of the method, we describe results obtained from the Syracuse 3 EHF measurements (20 / 44 GHz). We show that the method gives good results for a prediction horizon in the range 2 - 30 seconds. We conclude the paper by showing that for a prediction horizon of 10 seconds and for attenuations greater than 5 dB the error due to frequency scaling is larger than the prediction error, so that future improvements should focus on scaling frequency models...|$|R

The aim {{was to examine the}} availability, pricing and affordability of cardiovascular medicines in developing countries using the standardized data collected according to the World Health Organization/Health Action International methodology. Methods The following medicines were included: atenolol, captopril, hydrochlorothiazide, losartan and nifedipine. Data from 36 countries were analyzed. Outcome measures were <b>percentage</b> <b>availability,</b> price ratios to international reference prices and number of day's wages needed by the lowest-paid unskilled government worker to purchase one month of chronic treatment. Patient prices were adjusted for inflation and purchasing power, procurement prices only for inflation. Data were analyzed for both generic and originator brand products and the public and private sector and summarized by World Bank Income Groups. Results For all measures, there was great variability across surveys. The overall availability of cardiovascular medicines was poor (mean 26. 3 % in public sector, 57. 3 % private sector). Procurement prices were very competitive in some countries, whereas others consistently paid high prices. Patient prices were generally substantially higher than international references prices; some countries, however, performed well. Chronic treatment with anti-hypertensive medication cost more than one day's wages in many cases. In particular when monotherapy is insufficient, treatment became unaffordable. Conclusions The results of this study emphasize the need of focusing attention and financing on making chronic disease medicines accessible, in particular in the public sector.

The database includes some measures of infrastructure quality (percentage of roads in poor condition, percentage of local phone calls that are unsuccessful, <b>percentage</b> <b>availability</b> of diesel locomotives, and percentage of electricity lost from the system), but only for recent years. the author examines correlation patterns and reports regressions relating infrastructure stocks to country population, per capita GDP, land area, and the urbanization ration. The relationship between infrastructure and economic growth is examined in a preliminary way. The author reports that: nontransportation infrastructure stocks tend to increase one-for-one with population but increase more than proportionately with per capita GDP; geographic factors (area, urbanization ration) appear to affect the provision of nontransportation infrastructure in poor countries but not in rich countries; transportation infrastructure appears to increase less than proportionately with population, and increases with income only after a middle-income threshold has been reached; and geographic factors seem to influence the length of total roads and rail lines but not of paved roads.

A riqueza de espécies, abundância de indivíduos por guildas trófica e biomassa total não apresentaram diferenças significativas entre as três bacias consideradas e sim quando considerada a ordem dos riachos. Das 18 variáveis descritoras do habitat analisadas, oito apresentaram influência sobre a estruturação da assembléia de peixes local, sendo duas qualitativas (tipo de cobertura da margem e materiais depositados na calha do riacho) e seis variáveis quantitativas (velocidade da correnteza, largura do riacho, oxigênio dissolvido, condutividade, temperatura da água e turbidez). The {{presence of}} riparian vegetation {{is an important}} factor that strongly influences such river characteristics, which consequently maintain local habitat heterogeneity and contributes to the input of allochthonous materials. Therefore, this dissertation has two objectives: 1) to compare the interaction of fish assemblages with riparian vegetation that belongs to the streamlet Santa Maria, Meia Ponte, Piracanjuba Rivers basins, rivers located in the Northern portion of the Paraná River basin, Central Brasil, identifying possible structures relating basins and rivers orders to the vegetation cover <b>percentage,</b> <b>availability</b> of allochthonous and authochthonus matters and water turbidity; 2) determine which habitat variables (geomorphology, riparian vegetation, limnological, physical-chemical and hydrological aspects) influence streamlet fish assemblages found within in the Northern Paraná River Basin. In order to do so, during April and September 2009 samples were performed in 27 streamlets of first and second orders from Meia Ponte River (seven tributaries), Piracanjuba River (14 tributaries) and Santa Maria Streamlet (six tributaries) located in the Southeastern region of the state of Goias (Northern Paraná Basin). By the end of the samples, 4879 specimens from 59 species and 19 families were collected. Species richness, individual abundances by guilds and total biomass did not presented significant differences among the three basins considered. However,when the streamlets order were considered, such difference was significant. The difference between first and second order streamlets when considering species richness was, on average, of eight species and the highest species richness was found among second order streamlets. Individual abundances found by trophic guilds presented differences among, carnivorous, herbivorous and insectivorous species, and in all cases, the species richness was higher in the second order streamlets. Total biomass presented an average increase of 131 g in the second order streamlets. From the 18 habitat descriptive variables analyzed, eight influenced the local fish assemblages: two of them were quantitative ones (margins cover type and deposited matter in the streamlet bed) and six were quantitative (stream velocity, river width, dissolved oxygen, water conductivity, water temperature and water turbidity) ...|$|E

This paper investigates an SLA Support System for CC (SLACC) which aims to estimate in a formalized methodology - based on available Cloud Computing infrastructure parameters - what CPs will be able to offer/accept as SLOs or KPIs and, as a consequence, which increasing levels of SLA specificity for their customers can be reache...|$|R

40|$|A {{study was}} carried out at an ultrabasic soil area in Felda Rokan Barat (FRB), Negeri Sembilan. Twenty plants of samples namely chili, turmeric, pandan and lemon grass were {{collected}} randomly for the determination of heavy metal contents such as Fe, Cd, Co, Cu, Mn, Ni, Pb, Cr and Zn. Heavy metals in plants were extracted by wet digestion method, whereas available and resistant heavy metals in soil were extracted by sequential extraction. Total heavy metals content in the soil were obtained by summation of resistant and available heavy metals. Heavy metals content in soil and plant extract were determined by using the Flame Atomic Absorption Spectrophotometer (FAAS). Results showed that Fe was the dominant composition in soil {{in the study area}} while Cd concentration was very low with values of < 10 mg/kg. The range of heavy metals concentration in soils were Fe (2618. 4 to 4248 mg/kg), Mn (240. 9 to 741. 9 mg/kg), Zn (81. 9 to 324. 8 mg/kg), Cr (46. 8 to 438. 7 mg/kg), Cu (15. 7 to 81. 7 mg/kg), Pb (14. 9 to 116. 8 mg/kg), Ni (10. 1 to 545. 6 mg/kg), Cd (5. 6 to 10. 6 mg/kg) dan Co (0. 8 to 126. 1 mg/kg). Available Fe recorded the highest value in all of the plant substrates followed by Mn, Zn, Pb, Ni, Cr, Cu, Co and Cd. Based on <b>percentage</b> of <b>availability</b> Mn, Pb and Zn are considered most available by plant with <b>availability</b> <b>percentage</b> of 8 to 10 %. Concentration of Fe, Mn, Ni and Zn were high in all parts of plants compared to the other metals. The value of biological absorption coefficient (BAC) in chili, turmeric, pandan and lemon grass were in the range of 0. 02 - 0. 36, 0. 03 - 0. 41, 0. 03 - 0. 63 and 0. 03 - 1. 15, respectively. It can be concluded that the uptake of heavy metals by plants were normal even though the heavy metals concentration in the ultrabasic soil was high...|$|R
40|$|O presente trabalho avaliou a disponibilidade do ferro do feijão comum e os efeitos de suas interações com ácido ascórbico e cistina em comparação a disponibilidade deste metal em carne bovina. Para a determinação do teor de ferro e diálise de ferro in vitro, foram {{realizadas}} análises químicas nas amostras de carne bovina (C), feijão comum (F), feijão comum com ácido ascórbico (FA), feijão comum com cistina (FCI) e feijão comum com ácido ascórbico e cistina (FACI). Em F foram determinados taninos, ácido fítico e ácido oxálico. Em F foi encontrado 0, 065 g de tanino/ 100 g; 8, 03 mg de ácido fítico/g e 7, 12 mg de ácido oxálico/g. A quantidade de ferro variou de 9, 64 mg/ 100 g a 10, 37 mg/ 100 g. A amostra FCI e FA apresentaram os menores teores de ferro. A quantidade de ferro encontrada na amostra C foi de 10, 37 mg/ 100 g. A porcentagem de ferro dialisável variou de 17, 33 % a 24, 31 %. As amostras de carne bovina apresentaram a maior porcentagem de ferro dialisável, seguida por FACI. A menor porcentagem de ferro dialisável foi observada nas amostras F e FCI. Portanto, pode-se concluir que a adição simultânea de ácido ascórbico e cistina, tornou o ferro presente no feijão mais biodisponível, equiparando-o ao da carne bovina. The present work evaluated iron {{availability of}} the common bean {{and the effects of}} its interactions with ascorbic acid and cystine in iron availability and compare the results with iron {{availability of the}} bovine meat. The determination of iron quantity and iron dialysis in vitro has been done by analysing the samples of bovine meat (M), common bean (B), common bean with ascorbic acid (BA), common bean with cystine (BCY) and common bean with ascorbic acid and cystine (BACY). In B, tannins, phytic acid and oxalic acid were determined. In the B sample, 0. 065 g of tannins/ 100 g; 8. 03 mg of phytic acid/g and 7. 12 mg of oxalic acid/g were found. The iron quantity varied from 9. 64 mg/ 100 g to 10. 37 mg/ 100 g. The BCY and BA samples presented the smallest iron quantity. The iron quantity found in the sample M was 10. 37 mg/ 100 g. The <b>percentage</b> of iron <b>availability</b> varied from 17. 33 % to 24. 31 %. The M sample presented the largest <b>percentage</b> of iron <b>availability,</b> followed by BACY. The smallest <b>percentage</b> of iron <b>availability</b> was observed in B and BCY samples. Therefore, in conclusion, the iron bean became more bioavailability because of the simultaneous addition of ascorbic acid and cystine compared with the iron of bovine meat...|$|R

First algorithm[1] proposes {{an approach to}} determine the shortest path between the source and the destination nodes in a faulty (or non-faulty) hypercube. Second algorithm[2] has {{a different approach to}} hypercube node structure and proposes that direct use of sharp product is not sufficent to discard only computational part (processor and memory) when only this part of a node is faulty. The procedures proposed within this algorithm, allow to obtain a set of extended fault-free subcubes which is a beginning set for further manipulation in hypercube multiprocessors and to increase the reliability of such systems. Third algorithm[3] proposes a procedure for definition of neighborhood and fault-free subcubes in a fault-free subcubes in a faulty-hypercube. We’ve implemented these algorithms in UNIX and in Intel iPSC/ 860 Simulation platforms. Simulations are done for static and dynamic routing.
