It follows that the fideicommissum may generally be extinguished by the joint act of the fiduciary and the fideicommissary. It must be noted that what is termed a “family arrangement” between the beneficiaries which purports to effect substantial deviations from the <b>provisions</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>will</b> are as <b>a</b> rule not lawful; but special considerations arise in connection with fideicommissa permitting such departures.|$|R

In other words, just because the <b>provisions</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>will</b> may seem [...] "unfair" [...] {{does not mean that the}} will is invalid. Therefore, wills cannot be challenged simply because a beneficiary believes the inheritance or lack thereof is unfair. In the United States, the decedent generally has a legal right to dispose of property in any way that is legal. The large number of will contests makes judges often wary of contests especially when they involve the willing of property to charitable organizations [...]|$|R

40|$|The {{attorney}} 2 ̆ 7 s preparation <b>of</b> <b>a</b> {{testamentary document}} (hereinafter {{sometimes referred to}} as <b>a</b> <b>will</b> or revocable trust) should clearly and accurately reflect the client 2 ̆ 7 s last wishes. Although these testamentary documents should reflect the client 2 ̆ 7 s intent, they often fall short of accomplishing that goal. There are numerous examples of will and trust construction cases that exhaust tremendous resources in an effort to ascertain the client 2 ̆ 7 s wishes or intent. Many of these cases involve the construction of patent and/or latent ambiguities which should have been resolved by appropriate drafting. This article 2 ̆ 7 s scope is limited to patent ambiguities caused by the attorney 2 ̆ 7 s negligence and their detrimental impact on third parties. In these situations, the patent ambiguity is easily identified and the claim of negligence is clear. A patent ambiguity is obvious {{from the face of the}} will and is easily discovered prior to the testator 2 ̆ 7 s death. For example, a patent ambiguity exists where two different <b>provisions</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>will</b> dispose <b>of</b> the same plot of land to different devisees. The attorney 2 ̆ 7 s close reading of the will should have discovered this error. The attorney 2 ̆ 7 s failure to correct the patent ambiguity prior to the testator 2 ̆ 7 s death has detrimental consequences for the third party harmed. Extrinsic evidence is generally not admissible to resolve a patent ambiguity, because courts are unwilling to add to or detract from the written words of the will...|$|R
60|$|If {{little has}} as yet {{been done in}} {{extending}} {{the rights of women}} by giving them <b>a</b> greater share <b>of</b> the work of the world, still less has been done toward giving them their portion of political influence. In the States there are many men of mark, and women of mark also, who think that women should have votes for public elections. Mr. Wendell Phillips, the Boston lecturer who advocates abolition, is an apostle in this cause also; and while I was at Boston I read the <b>provisions</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>will</b> lately left by a millionaire, in which he bequeathed some very large sums of money to be expended in agitation on this subject. A woman is subject to the law; why then should she not help to make the law? A child is subject to the law, and does not help to make it; but the child lacks that discretion which the woman enjoys equally with the man. That I take it is the amount of the argument in favor of the political rights of women. The logic of this is so conclusive that I am prepared to acknowledge that it admits of no answer. I will only say that the mutual good relations between men and women, which are so indispensable to our happiness, require that men and women should not take to voting {{at the same time and}} on the same result. If it be decided that women shall have political power, let them have it all to themselves for a season. If that be so resolved, I think we may safely leave it to them to name the time at which they will begin.|$|R

40|$|We {{test the}} null {{hypothesis}} that involuntary transfers for the <b>provision</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> public good <b>will</b> completely crowd out voluntary transfers against the warm-glow hypothesis that crowding-out will be incomplete because individuals care about giving. Our design differs from the related design used by Andreoni in considering two levels of the involuntary transfer and <b>a</b> wider range <b>of</b> contribution possibilities, and in mixing groups every period instead of every four periods. We analyse the data with careful attention to boundary effects. We retain {{the null hypothesis}} of complete crowding-out in two of three pairwise comparisions, but reject it in favour of incomplete crowding-out in the comparison most closely akin to Andreoni’s design. Thus we confirm the existence of incomplete crowding-out in some environments, but suggest that the warm-glow hypothesis is inadequate in explaining it. ...|$|R
5000|$|The parish {{church history}} {{is that of}} the Diocese of Armagh. The vicarage formed part of the union of Dunleer. The Protestant parishioners {{attended}} the church at Dunleer, but religious service was also performed every Sunday evening by the curate in the school room at Drumcar. The rectory was {{under the jurisdiction of the}} Lord-Primate. Advowsons were granted to Peter Pipard in 1187. Between ca.1200 and 1220, Ralph de Repenteny granted the tithes, mills, fisheries and lands of the Church of St. Fintan, Drumcar, to the Abbot and Convent of St. Mary's Church, Dublin. From 1582, the rectory, parsonage, church and chapel were granted to Lord Ormond. They passed to Sir John Bath in 1630-1. William DiUon was impropriator in 1633. The tithes were rented by Henry Usher in 1656. There was an endowment for a clergyman to be appointed by the lord <b>of</b> the town. <b>A</b> payment <b>of</b> £50 per annum to the perpetual curate <b>of</b> Moylary was <b>a</b> <b>provision</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> testator's <b>will</b> as <b>of</b> 1837. [...] The tithes amounted to £343, of which £292 was payable to the lord-primate and £51 to the vicar. The glebe comprised 11 acres. A churchyard was used as a burial-ground; it contains the featureless ruins of the previous church.|$|R

40|$|The second {{fundamental}} theorem {{of welfare}} economics states that under appropriate conditions every Pareto optimal outcome {{can be achieved}} as a competitive equilibrium by suitable lump-sum transfers of wealth. The second theorem implies that a central planner can implement whatever outcome he regards as best, simply by transferring income among individuals. Intuition suggests that the second theorem, or something like it, should also hold for public goods. <b>Of</b> course, voluntary <b>provision</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> public good <b>will</b> typically be inefficient because of the free rider problem. But if the central planner wanted {{to increase the amount}} <b>of</b> <b>a</b> public good in a competitive (voluntary) equilibrium could he not transfer income to those individuals who valued the public good most? Economists have been surprised to discover that this procedure will not work. For public goods a nearly opposite result to the second theorem holds. The neutrality theorem, first discovered by Warr (1983), states that under appropriate conditions lump-sum transfers of income from one person to another will cause no change in the amount of the public good provided. A closely related result, called the crowding out theorem, shows that the central planner cannot increase the amount of the public good via lump-sum taxes and public provision. For every unit of the public good provided by the central planner...|$|R
500|$|... 'The Pump' is a {{significant}} local landmark. Donated to the village by Charlotte Gell, this water pump stands close to the village pond {{at the intersection of}} Swakeleys Road and Long Lane. After Gell's death in 1863, under the <b>provisions</b> <b>of</b> her <b>will</b> <b>a</b> water pump was sunk for the benefit for the community in 1866. The village pond next to the pump was dug {{at the same time as}} the [...] well for the pump was sunk to accommodate waste from the construction. An older pond on the other side of the village was filled in with the excavated earth from the new one. In 1857 Gell had also donated some of her land near St Giles's Church for five almshouses to be built for longstanding servants of the Gell household or Ickenham residents who were members of the Church of England. No more than three people were allowed to live in the houses at one time. The cottages remain and are maintained by the local church. Next to the pump stands the Coach & Horses public house, first licensed for the sale of alcohol in 1759 but of 16th-century origin. The house was used for manorial courts throughout the 19th century until the last was held in 1878.|$|R
40|$|The {{object of}} the {{research}} was to discuss the taxability of the illegal diamond trade in South Africa and to identify the consequences of not declaring income obtained from the illegal diamond trade to the South African Revenue Services. The research was conducted by means <b>of</b> <b>a</b> critical analysis <b>of</b> documentary data with specific reference to the Income Tax Act, the Value-Added Tax (VAT) Act, the Tax Administration Act and relevant case law. The Income Tax Act and the Value-Added Tax Act were referred to {{in relation to the}} tax consequences of the illegal diamond trade and the Tax Administration Act was used to determine the consequences of not declaring income to the South African Revenue Services. It was established that amounts received from the sale of illegal diamonds are {{to be included in the}} taxpayer's gross income, whilst in relation to income received from diamond theft it was not as clear. The MP Finance Group case held that the nature of the receipt and the way in which the transaction occurred in each individual situation will be the deciding factor as to whether or not the stolen diamonds will be taxable in the hands of the thief. The buying and selling of "blood" or stolen diamonds can amount to a trade. As there have been no definitive case decisions in South Africa, it remains unclear whether expenses relating to an illegal trade are deductible. Assuming that expenses relating to an illegal trade are deductible, the <b>provisions</b> <b>of</b> section 11 (<b>a)</b> <b>will</b> apply to expenses incurred as <b>a</b> result <b>of</b> dealing in illegal diamonds and it was concluded that qualifying expenses <b>will</b> be deductible. <b>A</b> taxpayer buying and selling "blood" or stolen diamonds is required to register for VAT if sales exceed the threshold and would be required to account for VAT on these transactions. If the taxpayer does not declare the income for income tax purposes or register for and pay VAT to the South African Revenue Services from either the sale of illegal diamonds or the theft of diamonds, this will amount to tax evasion and the dealer will be subject to penalties and even imprisonmen...|$|R
