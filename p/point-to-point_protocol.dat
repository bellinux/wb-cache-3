40|$|The {{predominant}} use of <b>point-to-point</b> communication <b>protocols</b> on {{the global}} Internet, combined with the communication patterns imposed by the World Wide Web, make inefficient use of the Internet's increasingly scarce network bandwidth. While more network fiber helps to belay {{the impact of these}} inefficiencies, ultimately more intelligent coordination of data distribution and the use of more efficient distribution protocols will be necessary to support the user population of the Information Superhighway. To this end, we propose the notion of Information Servers. Using the publish-subscribe paradigm, Information Servers distribute information in such way to minimize network traffic. 1 Introduction The primary challenge presented by the Information Superhighway is efficient information dissemination.

40|$|The recent {{growth of}} the Internet and its {{increased}} heterogeneity have increased the complexity of network protocol design and testing. In addition, the advent of multipoint (multicast-based) applications has introduced new challenges that are qualitatively different in nature than the traditional <b>point-to-point</b> <b>protocols.</b> Multipoint applications typically involve a group of participants simultaneously, and hence are inherently more complex. As more multipoint protocols are coming to life, {{the need for a}} systematic method to study and evaluate such protocols is becoming more apparent.

40|$|Abstract. The {{multiple}} expected {{sources of}} traffic skewness in Next-Generation SensorNets (NGSN) will trigger {{the need for}} load-balanced <b>point-to-point</b> routing <b>protocols.</b> Driven by this fact, we present in this paper a load-balancing primitive, namely Traffic-Oblivious Load-Balancing (TOLB), to be used on top of any <b>point-to-point</b> routing <b>protocol.</b> TOLB obliviously load balances traffic by pushing the decision-making responsibility {{to the source of}} any packet without depending on the energy status of the network sensors or on previously taken decisions for similar packets. We present theoretical bounds on TOLB’s performance for special network types such as mesh networks. Additionally, we ran simulations to evaluate TOLB’s performance on general networks. Our experimental results show the high benefit (in terms of network lifetime and throughput) of applying TOLB on top of routing schemes to deal with various traffic skewness levels in different sensor deployment scenarios. ...|$|R
40|$|The Java^TM Reliable Multicast Service^TM (JRMS) {{is a set}} of {{libraries}} and services for building multicastaware applications. It enables building applications that distribute data from "senders" to "receivers" over "channels" with distributed control over content mix. It includes a dynamic filtering mechanism that uses Java software that is pushed into the network for interpreting the data of the receiver. JRMS supports multiple reliable multicast transport protocols via a common programming interface, which provides isolation to applications. Supported transport protocols are selectable by applications based on reliability and type of service needs. Emerging multimedia or "push" applications can use JRMS as a better platform for reliable delivery of content to very large constituencies. As compared to unicast (<b>point-to-point)</b> <b>protocols),</b> reliable multicast enables broadcasting to groups of receivers, ensuring bandwidth conservation and timely delivery.
