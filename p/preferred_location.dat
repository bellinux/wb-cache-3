5|$|Islamic {{reverence for}} the site {{is derived from the}} belief that the prophet Mohammed tied his miraculous steed Buraq nearby during his night journey to Jerusalem. Various places have been {{suggested}} for the exact spot where Buraq was tethered, but for several centuries the <b>preferred</b> <b>location</b> has been the al-Buraq mosque, which is just inside the wall {{at the south end of}} the present Western Wall plaza. The mosque is located above an ancient passageway, which once came out through the long-sealed Barclay's Gate whose huge lintel is still visible directly below the Maghrebi gate.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the money}} was duly raised and the bronze cast of the statue was finally {{completed}} in 1856, a lengthy dispute delayed its installation for several years. The original idea had been to erect the statue as a memorial to the Great Exhibition. This prompted opposition, as did proposals to place it outside Charles Barry's newly completed Palace of Westminster. Various other locations to display the statue were initially considered before agreement was reached {{that it would be}} placed in Old Palace Yard, Marochetti's <b>preferred</b> <b>location.</b> It was installed in October 1860, though it was not until March 1867 that it was finally completed with the addition of bronze bas-reliefs {{on either side of the}} pedestal.|$|E
5|$|That Ouania is Govan is now {{reasonably}} certain, but {{the location}} of Newanbirig is less so. Although there are very many Newburghs, it is Newburgh-on-Tyne near Hexham {{that has been the}} <b>preferred</b> <b>location.</b> An alternative interpretation of the events of 756 has been advanced: it identifies Newanbirig with Newborough by Lichfield in the kingdom of Mercia. A defeat here for Eadberht and Óengus by Æthelbald's Mercians would correspond with the claim in the Saint Andrews foundation legends that a king named Óengus son of Fergus founded the church there as a thanksgiving to Saint Andrew for saving him after a defeat in Mercia.|$|E

5|$|The Reformation brought Roskilde's {{development}} {{to an abrupt}} stop. While the cathedral continued to be the <b>preferred</b> <b>location</b> for the entombment of the Danish monarchs, {{most of the other}} religious institutions disappeared. For the next three centuries, the city suffered a series of disasters including the effects of the Dano-Swedish War which terminated with the Treaty of Roskilde in 1658, the plague in 1710 and 1711, and a series of fires in 1730. Conditions improved in 1835 when the city became the Assembly of the Estates of the Realm (Rådgivende Stænderforsamling) and in 1847 with the railway connecting Copenhagen and Roskilde.|$|E
5|$|The hydroid Hydractinia angusta has a mutualistic {{relationship}} with the scallop. A study showed that its larvae preferentially settled {{in the vicinity of}} other epibionts, usually on scallop shells, and that the scallop larvae were deterred from settling in the vicinity of colonies of the hydroid. It is surmised that the hydroid benefits from a solid substrate on which to live, and although the scallop benefits from the protection from predators provided by the stinging cells of the hydroid, it is disadvantaged by the failure of its larvae to establish themselves in their <b>preferred</b> <b>location,</b> on the shells of mature scallops.|$|E
5|$|The {{committee}} was reliant on public donations and realised {{that it was}} unlikely to raise a large sum of money as communities across Devon would be focusing on their own commemorations and commissioning individual war memorials. Despite this, the {{committee was}} determined to erect some sort of memorial to the county's war dead, and as a compromise sought a simple but elegant monument. They commissioned Lutyens in 1920 and opted for his War Cross design. The committee considered several potential sites, including Cawsand Beacon on Dartmoor and the Haldon Hills in south Devon, but the committee's <b>preferred</b> <b>location</b> was the cathedral close of Exeter, Devon's county town. The specific site was chosen so that the memorial would be visible from the High Street and Broadgate. With its remaining funds, the Devon County War Memorial Committee supported {{the construction of a}} battlefield memorial at La Ville-aux-Bois-lès-Pontavert in France to honour the 2nd Battalion of the Devonshire Regiment, who endured particularly heavy fighting at Bois des Buttes during the Third Battle of the Aisne.|$|E

5|$|F.C. United {{initially}} {{proposed a}} stadium at Ten Acres Lane in Newton Heath, {{on the site}} of an existing leisure centre and Astroturf outdoor football pitch. The plans indicated that these community facilities would have been maintained within the new scheme. Newton Heath is 2.8 miles (4.5km) east north east of Manchester city centre and has close links to Manchester United, who were formed in the urban area and were originally known as Newton Heath LYR Football Club between 1878 and 1902. However, on 4 March 2011 it was announced that Manchester City Council had backed out of plans to fund the new stadium with grants, {{despite the fact that the}} previously agreed £1.5 million was close to being raised by fans, and F.C. United moved to search for other sites. Despite this the Council stated that they were still committed to helping F.C. United build a ground in Manchester and on 5 April 2011 it was announced that, after considering three possible alternative sites, Ronald Johnson Playing Fields in Moston was the <b>preferred</b> <b>location</b> for the stadium to be built according to Manchester City Council.|$|E
5|$|The City of Everett {{selected}} a straightaway track segment east of downtown as the <b>preferred</b> <b>location</b> of a multimodal train/bus station, {{to replace the}} existing Amtrak station at Bond Street, in 1993. The Everett City Council chose a two-block industrial site bordered by Pacific Avenue to the north in 1995, estimating a cost of $30 million and an opening in 1998. Everett Mayor Ed Hansen proposed adding two additional stories to the station building to house classrooms and space for career counseling services, inspired by a similar project in Oakland, California. The Sound Transit Board passed a resolution in February 1999 allowing the use of $14 million to begin work on the Everett Multimodal Facility, {{which was to be}} the terminus for Sounder commuter rail and Sound Transit Express bus service. A groundbreaking ceremony was held on July 13, 2000, allowing for construction on Everett Station to begin. Sound Transit began with the construction of the Pacific Avenue overpass, replacing an earlier at-grade crossing, that opened on November 14, 2001 at a cost of $20 million. The station building was designed by the Zimmer Gunsul Frasca Partnership and built by Wilder Construction Company in 2000 and 2001.|$|E

40|$|Environmental {{monitoring}} of ambient air for radioactive material is required as stipulated in the PNNL Site radioactive air license. Sampling ambient air at identified <b>preferred</b> <b>locations</b> {{could not be}} initially accomplished because utilities were not readily available. Therefore, solar powered environmental monitoring systems were considered as a possible option. PNNL purchased two 24 -V DC solar powered environmental monitoring systems which consisted of solar panels, battery banks, and sampling units. During an approximate four month performance evaluation period, the solar stations operated satisfactorily at an on-site test location. They were subsequently relocated to their <b>preferred</b> <b>locations</b> in June 2012 where they continue to function adequately under the conditions found in Richland, Washington...|$|R

Similar main-top and fore-top platforms have been retained on steam ships and motor vessels as <b>preferred</b> <b>locations</b> for installing rotating radar antennae.|$|R
25|$|Flight {{operations}} moved 9 {{miles east}} to the College Park Air Field. Already a proven airfield for training military pilots between 1909-1911 and with active civilian flight operations in 1918, it was already a functioning field requiring minimal modification for airmail operations. In fact, College Park was the <b>preferred</b> <b>location</b> when Major Rueben Fleet scouted locations for the Army airmail. However, officials chose the Polo Grounds for its proximity to the White House and Congress.|$|E
25|$|After the {{war ended}} Møre og Romsdal County Municipality {{established}} a commission {{to look into the}} location of a central airport for the county of Møre og Romsdal. They concluded that since Gossen was nearly completed and was more centrally located within the county, it would be a <b>preferred</b> <b>location.</b> In Ålesund there was work with having Vigra chosen. They founded A/S Vigra Flyplass and in 1951 two students made calculations showing that Vigra would be cheaper than Gossen. The latter was selected by Parliament in 1952.|$|E
25|$|The locale around Princes Street is {{the main}} {{shopping}} area in the city centre, with souvenir shops, chain stores such as Boots the Chemist, H and Jenners. George Street, north of Princes Street, is the <b>preferred</b> <b>location</b> for some upmarket shops and independent stores. The St. James Centre at {{the east end of}} Princes Street is currently being redeveloped, however the John Lewis store remains open. Multrees Walk, adjacent to the St. James Centre, is a recent addition to the central shopping district, dominated by the presence of Harvey Nichols. Shops here include Louis Vuitton, Mulberry and Calvin Klein.|$|E

25|$|NEMA wall {{receptacles}} can {{be found}} installed in any orientation. Neither NEMA nor the US National Electrical Code nor the Canadian Electrical Code specify a preferred orientation, but the National Electrical Contractors Association's National Electrical Installation Standards (NECA 130-2010) specify that the <b>preferred</b> <b>location</b> of the ground is on top. When the ground blade of a receptacle is on the bottom, the neutral blade is on the upper left and the hot blade is on the upper right. All descriptions below assume this orientation (i.e. clockwise order is ground, neutral, hot for 120V receptacle versions; and counter-clockwise for plug versions).|$|E
25|$|Norwegian Air Lines {{announced}} {{the establishment of}} a seaplane route from Oslo and around the coast to Bergen ahead of the 1935 season. The city selected Breiviken as its <b>preferred</b> <b>location,</b> situated further out than the ultimate location. However, this site would require much work and a temporary location was needed. For this Kristiansholm was selected. A molo had been built there in 1920; this created difficulties for ship traffic in the area, but was a suitable location to anchor up a seaplane. The location was also suitable due to the vicinity of the city. Funding was granted from Bergen Municipality and a burned down lot at Sandvikstorget was selected.|$|E
25|$|WFAA-FM {{signed on}} October 5, 1946 as KERA-FM (no {{relation}} to the current radio and television station using those call letters). It was the first FM radio station to sign on in Texas, although its roots {{can be traced back}} to two test stations that signed on years prior: an experimental trial that dated back to 1939, and experimental FM station W5X1C, which signed on October 15, 1945. By 1947, WFAA-FM had moved from its original frequency at 94.3 FM to a <b>preferred</b> <b>location</b> at 97.9. With FM broadcasting in its infancy, the station signed on and off the air for months – and even going silent for two years – at a time, before settling on a permanent broadcast schedule by 1965.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. A {{model of}} {{topographic}} map development is presented which combines both weight plasticity {{and the formation}} and elimination of synapses as well as both activity-dependent and-independent processes. We statistically {{address the question of}} whether an activity-dependent process can refine a mapping created by an activity-independent process. A new method of evaluating the quality of topographic projections is presented which allows independent consideration of the development of a projection’s <b>preferred</b> <b>locations</b> and variance. Synapse formation and elimination embed in the network topology changes in the weight dis-tributions of synapses due to the activity-dependent learning rule used (spike-timing-dependent plasticity). In this model, variance of a projec-tion can be reduced by an activity dependent mechanism with or without spatially correlated inputs, but the accuracy of <b>preferred</b> <b>locations</b> will not necessarily improve when synapses are formed based on distributions with on-average perfect topography. ...|$|R
40|$|Carbon {{monoxide}} and unburned {{hydrocarbon emissions}} in a {{gas turbine engine}} are reduced by bleeding hot air from the engine cycle and introducing {{it back into the}} engine upstream of the bleed location and upstream of the combustor inlet. As this hot inlet air is recycled, the combustor inlet temperature rises rapidly at a constant engine thrust level. In most combustors, this will reduce carbon monoxide and unburned hydrocarbon emissions significantly. The <b>preferred</b> <b>locations</b> for hot air extraction are at the compressor discharge or from within the turbine, whereas the <b>preferred</b> reentry <b>location</b> is at the compressor inlet...|$|R
25|$|Eight weeks later, in March, {{after all}} {{passenger}} ship had arrived, settlers voted to abandon surveying at Pito-one—where the swamps, repeated flooding and poor anchorage facilities were proving {{too much of}} an obstacle—and move the town to Wakefield's <b>preferred</b> <b>location</b> of Thorndon at Lambton Bay (later Lambton Quay), which was named in honour of Lord Durham. Surveyors quickly encountered problems, however, when they discovered the land selected for the new settlement was still inhabited by Māori, who expressed astonishment and bewilderment to find Pākehā tramping through their homes, gardens and cemeteries and driving wooden survey pegs into the ground. Surveyors became involved in skirmishes with the Māori, most of whom refused to budge, and were provided with weapons to continue their work.|$|E
25|$|Aurelian {{was born}} on 9 September, most likely in 214 AD, {{although}} 215 AD is also possible. The ancient sources are not agreed on his place of birth, although he was generally accepted as being a native of Illyricum. Sirmium in Pannonia Inferior (now Sremska Mitrovica, Serbia) is the <b>preferred</b> <b>location,</b> which was created by Aurelian as Emperor when he abandoned the old trans-Danubian territory of Dacia. The academic consensus {{is that he was}} of humble birth and that his father was a peasant-farmer who took his Roman nomen from his landlord, a senator of the clan Aurelius. Saunders suggests that his family might in fact have been of Roman settler origin and of much higher social status; however, his suggestion has not been taken up by his more recent academic colleagues such as Southern and Watson.|$|E
25|$|By 1985, traffic had {{increased}} {{so much that}} it became clear that by 1988 all international traffic would have to move to Gardermoen. The areas at Hobøl had been freed up, and a government report was launched recommending that a new airport be built at Gardermoen, although an airport at Hurum had also been surveyed. However, the report did not look into the need of the Air Force that was stationed at Gardermoen, and was therefore rejected by the parliament the following year. In 1988, a majority of the government chose Hurum as their <b>preferred</b> <b>location,</b> and Minister of Transport Kjell Borgen withdrew from his position. In 1989, new weather surveys from Hurum showed unfavorable conditions. There were large protests from meteorologists and pilots who stated that the surveys were manipulated. Two government committees were appointed, and both concluded that there were no irregularities in the surveys.|$|E
