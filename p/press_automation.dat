40|$|The windows task (a hybrid executive/theory of mind task) {{requires}} {{participants to}} infer {{the utility of}} indicating a box in which a desired object is absent, adjacent to one where it is visible, {{in the presence of}} an experimenter in a completive role, and to maintain this response over a number of subsequent trials. We presented two pairs of groups (3 years vs. 4 years and autism vs. MLD) with an automated version of the task in order to find out whether the main locus of difficulty was executive or social. In two conditions the required response was to press a button beneath the chosen box, and in two conditions the deceptive or the merely competitive element was maintained. In the deceptive condition the participant had to tell the opponent which button to <b>press.</b> <b>Automation</b> removed group differences in performance on the first ‘inferential’ experimental trial, although group differences did remain in performance across all trials. We argue that it was the novel response mode used in the automated task that made it easier than the standard versions: button pressing (or indicating in the deceptive condition) rather than reference to a location. We discuss this possibility with regard to the kind of inhibitory requirements made by theory of mind tasks...|$|E
40|$|Automated {{procedural}} {{and decision}} aids may {{in some cases}} have the paradoxical effect of increasing errors rather than eliminating them. Results of recent research investigating the use of automated systems have indicated the presence automation bias, a term describing errors made when decision makers rely on automated cues as a heuristic replacement for vigilant information seeking and processing (Mosier & Skitka, in <b>press).</b> <b>Automation</b> commission errors, i. e., errors made when decision makers take inappropriate action because they over-attend to automated information or directives, and automation omission errors, i. e., errors made when decision makers do not take appropriate action {{because they are not}} informed of an imminent problem or situation by automated aids, can result from this tendency. ameliorated by imposing pre-decisional accountability, which sensitizes decision makers to the need to construct compelling justifications for their choices and how they make them. To what extent these effects generalize to performance situations has yet to be empirically established. The two studies presented represent concurrent efforts, with student and “glass cockpit ” pilot samples, {{to determine the effects of}} accountability pressures on automation bias and on verification of the accurate functioning of automated aids. Students (Experiment 1) and commercial pilots (Experiment 2) performed simulated flight tasks using automated aids. In both studies, participants who perceived themselves “accountable ” for their strategies of interaction with the automation wer...|$|E

50|$|Due to the formulaic {{nature of}} automation, it is mainly used for stories based on {{statistics}} and numerical figures. Common topics include sports recaps, weather, financial reports, real estate analysis, and earnings reviews. StatSheet, an online platform covering college basketball, runs entirely on an automated program. The Associated <b>Press</b> began using <b>automation</b> to cover 10,000 minor baseball leagues games annually, using a program from Automated Insights and statistics from MLB Advanced Media. Outside of sports, the Associated <b>Press</b> also uses <b>automation</b> to produce stories on corporate earnings. In 2006, Thomson Reuters announced their switch to automation to generate financial news stories on its online news platform. More famously, an algorithm called Quakebot published {{a story about}} a 2014 California earthquake on The Los Angeles Times website within three minutes after the shaking has stopped.|$|R

50|$|Typically, presses are {{electronically}} linked (with a {{programmable logic}} controller) to an automatic feeder which feeds metal raw material through the die. The raw material is {{fed into the}} automatic feeder {{after it has been}} unrolled from a coil and put through a straightener. A tonnage monitor may be provided to observe the amount of force used for each stroke. <b>Press</b> and <b>automation</b> controls have take a huge leap forward in 2016 with safety, security, features & functions. A good example is Connected Enterprise with I-PRESS that allows users to log in from any remote device to and individual press. This allows for new job set ups to be downloaded from engineering or trouble shooting and operator assistance to be done from mobile devices or PC's.|$|R
5000|$|Named for the {{movement}} of the transfer mechanism, tri-axis transfer mechanisms motion is defined by the three (3) axes of movement made by the part manipulators each press stroke. On the <b>press</b> downstroke the <b>automation</b> which will likely be holding the work piece will lower the work piece to the tool and retract to leave the part on the tool. At the bottom of the stroke the automation mechanism in the retracted state will cycle backward one pitch to position itself adjacent to the next workpiece. As the press cycles upward the part manipulators will index inward to pick up the next work piece, continuing upward following the press ram, then indexing forward to next station. As the press reaches the top of its stroke, the process repeats. The three axes of motion are up-down, in-out, and forward-back.|$|R
50|$|Sheet {{metal forming}} in {{medium-high}} volume production environments is often completed {{through the use}} of a Transfer Press operating a number of dies as a complete system. Each die in the system is responsible for adding more shape to the part until the metal work piece attains its final shape. What makes transfer stamping unique is that a single press operates a number of tools, the movement of the sheet metal work piece from one operation to the next is performed by automation either built into the press or onto the dies. With each closing of the press the entire system of tools will close, each performing its designed work to the sheet metal. Upon opening the built in transfer mechanism moves the workpiece from one operation to the next in the sequence. In the past these operations may have been performed using individual presses and the workpieces may have been moved from press to press, and die to die, by hand. As Automation improved hand loading was replaced by pick and place automation and by robots. The transfer press is a natural extension of this practice, simplifying the operation by having all tools in a single large <b>press</b> and using <b>automation</b> which is specifically designed for the press operations.|$|R
40|$|Computerized system {{monitors}} and decision aids are increasingly common additions to critical decision-making contexts such as intensive care units, {{nuclear power plants}} and aircraft cockpits. These aids are introduced with the ubiquitous goal of &&reducing human error''. The present study compared error rates in a simulated #ight task with and without a computer that monitored system states and made decision recommendations. Participants in non-automated settings out-performed their counterparts with a very but not perfectly reliable automated aid on a monitoring task. Participants with an aid made errors of omission (missed events when not explicitly prompted about them by the aid) and commission (did what an automated aid recommended, even when it contradicted their training and other 100 % valid and available indicators). Possible causes and consequences of automation bias are discussed (1999 Academic <b>Press</b> 1. Does <b>automation</b> bias decision-making? Computers and related automated decision aids have been introduced into many work environments with the explicit goal of reducing human error. For example, {{in response to the}} fact that many aviation accidents can be attributed to human error (e. g. Diehl, 1991), the aviation industry and federal aviation and safety industries are successfully pushing to increasingly automate #ight systems (Weiner, 1989; Billings, 1996). Flight manage-ment computers are assuming greater control of #ight tasks, such as calculating fuel-e$cient paths, navigation, detecting system malfunctions and abnormalities, in addition to #ying the plane. Other "elds as disparate as nuclear power plants and intensive care units are similarly relying more and more on automated decision aids. Because these aidsDoes automation bias decision-making?...|$|R
