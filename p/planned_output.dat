40|$|Conservation {{planning}} {{decisions are}} typically {{made on the}} basis of species distribution or occurrence data, which ideally would have complete spatial and taxonomic coverage. Agencies are constrained in the data they can collect, often pragmatically prioritising certain groups such as threatened species, or methods, such as volunteer surveys. This mismatch between goals and realities inevitably leads to bias and uncertainty in conservation <b>planning</b> <b>outputs,</b> yet few studies have assessed how data realities affect <b>planning</b> <b>outputs.</b> We conducted a sensitivity analysis on the Protection Index, a method for assessing conservation progress and priorities, using an extensive dataset on species occurrences and distributions derived from the Florida Natural Areas Inventory. Analyses revealed a high proportion of occurrence records for threatened species and certain taxonomic groups, reflecting the agencies 2 ̆ 7 priorities. We performed a sensitivity analysis on conservation <b>planning</b> <b>outputs,</b> simulating a 2 ̆ 7 data poor 2 ̆ 7 scenario typical of many real situations; we deleted increasing amounts of data in both a biased (exaggerating patterns observed) and unbiased (random) manner. We assessed the effects of data paucity and bias on the value of potential conservation sites, and planning priorities. Certain high value sites with only a few important species occurrences were more sensitive to data depletion than those with many occurrences. Data bias based on taxonomic bias was more influential to site value than threat rank. To maximise benefit from surveys from a planning perspective, it would be better to focus on poorly surveyed areas rather than adding occurrences in already well represented sites. This study demonstrates the importance of sensitivity analysis in conservation planning, and that the effects of uncertainty and data quality on planning decisions should not be ignored. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd...|$|R
50|$|At each level, {{individual}} units {{received their}} target input allocations and output quantities. Managers, engineers, and accountants compared the targets {{with their own}} projections, and if they concluded that the <b>planned</b> <b>output</b> quotas exceeded their capabilities, they consulted {{with representatives of the}} administrative body superior to them.

50|$|During {{the early}} 1960s, {{industrial}} production stagnated and {{the agricultural sector}} also registered a relatively poor performance. Agriculture had been a weak {{part of the economy}} throughout the 1950s, consistently failing to reach <b>planned</b> <b>output</b> targets, and the minimal reforms of 1958-59 had done little to alter the situation. Targets set for the national economy in the Third Five-Year Plan (1961-65) quickly proved to be overly ambitious, particularly with regard to foreign trade. The plan was dropped after a recession in 1962, and annual plans covered the remainder of the period. National income actually declined in 1963. By 1965 it was only 1.9% higher than in 1960, in comparison with a 6.9% growth rate in the 1956-60 period.|$|E

5000|$|Based on {{a system}} of state ownership, the Soviet economy was managed through Gosplan (the State Planning Commission), Gosbank (the State Bank) and the Gossnab (State Commission for Materials and Equipment Supply). Beginning in 1928, the economy was {{directed}} {{by a series of}} five-year plans, with a brief attempt at seven-year planning. For every enterprise, planning ministries (also known as the [...] "fund holders" [...] or fondoderzhateli) defined the mix of economic inputs (e.g., labor and raw materials), a schedule for completion, all wholesale prices and almost all retail prices. The planning process was based around material balances—balancing economic inputs with <b>planned</b> <b>output</b> targets for the planning period. From 1930 until the late 1950s, the range of mathematics used to assist economic decision-making was, for ideological reasons, extremely restricted.|$|E

5000|$|The {{classical}} aggregate supply curve comprises a short-run aggregate supply {{curve and}} a vertical long-run aggregate supply curve. The short-run curve visualizes the total <b>planned</b> <b>output</b> {{of goods and}} services in the economy at a particular price level. The [...] "short-run" [...] is defined as the period during which only final good prices adjust and factor, or input, costs do not. The [...] "long-run" [...] is the period after which factor prices are able to adjust accordingly. The short-run aggregate supply curve has an upward slope for the same reasons the Keynesian AS curve has one: the law of diminishing returns and the scarcity of resources. The long-run aggregate supply curve is vertical because factor prices will have adjusted. Factor prices increase if producing at a point beyond full employment output, shifting the short-run aggregate supply inwards so equilibrium occurs somewhere along full employment output. Monetarists have argued that demand-side expansionary policies favoured by Keynesian economists are solely inflationary. As the aggregate demand curve is shifted outward, the general price level increases. This increased price level causes households, or the owners of the factors of production to demand higher prices for their goods and services. The consequence of this is increased production costs for firms, causing short-run aggregate demand to shift back inwards. The theoretical ultimate result is inflation.|$|E
50|$|At the Six Party Plenum in August 1979, {{there was}} debate {{starting}} about decentralization of some {{decision making and}} provisions of more incentives for production expansion. In 1980, with Decree 40 issued, provincial governments were permitted to establish trading firms. Since foreign trading constituted {{the primacy of the}} planned economy, this was one of areas where the state launched serious reforms. The monopoly of foreign trade by the state in Vietnam was broken by this decision. In 1981, other important measures were issued. One of them was guidelines directive 100 with respect to contracts in the agricultural sector. This new contract system had four main features. First, farmland was distributed to individual working age members. Second, an individual worker or group was able {{to be in charge of}} several phases of farming under contract with cooperatives. Third, each person or group was obliged to sell part of the output grown in the assigned field. Last, farmers could retain all production beyond the quota. In addition, there was a decision issued by the state, Decree 25-CP allowing state enterprises to produce beyond <b>planned</b> <b>output</b> with the adaptation of the three plan system. According to the system, a single plan was composed of three elements, Plan A, Plan B and Plan C. Once state enterprises produce and sell to the state using inputs supplied, Plan B would allow them to dispose of their products freely. Moreover, state enterprises would be allowed to produce the minor under Plan C. This system was one of the contributors to the recovery in state industrial output of the early 1980s. Following these measures, numerous consumer products were removed from the ration list so as to increase trade at market prices and ease shortages of them within the state trade system.|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{address the problem of}} {{post-processing}} position constrained <b>plans,</b> <b>output</b> by many of the recent efficient metric temporal planners, to improve their execution flexibility. Specifically, given a position constrained plan, we consider the problem of generating a partially ordered (aka “order constrained”) plan that uses the same actions. Although variations of this “partialization ” problem have been addressed in classical planning, the metric and temporal considerations bring in significant complications. We develop a general CSP encoding for partializing positionconstrained temporal plans, that can be optimized under an objective function dealing with a variety of temporal flexibility criteria, such as makespan. We then propose several approaches (e. g. coupled CSP, MILP) of solving this encoding. ...|$|R
