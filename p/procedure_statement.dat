[...]) {{with all}} {{elements}} equal to zero {{to represent the}} additive random effects of parents who had no phenotypic values, but who needed their breeding values to be predicted by the model. The coefficients of the covariance matrix of random variables z 1 [*]−[*]zx[*]+[*]y[*]+[*]N, where y[*]=[*]number of ancestors of the parents, is given by the additive relationship matrix A. This was constructed using Proc INBREED as discussed in a previous section, followed by manipulations as described below to form a SAS dataset we named ‘Adata’. For this we first updated the A by deleting from it the corresponding rows and columns for the y number of ancestors of parents for which we {{were not interested in}} estimating breeding values. Secondly, we added in two numeric column variables named PARM and ROW before columns Col 1 -Col(x[*]+[*]N) of the updated A to form ‘Adata’. Since we were interested only in the additive variance, PARM had a value[*]=[*] 1 for all rows in ‘Adata’, which were numbered 1 to N in the ROW variable. Now, the GLIMMIX <b>procedure</b> <b>statement</b> for estimating the additive genetic variance and breeding values has the syntax: RANDOM Z 1 -Z(x[*]+[*]N)/TYPE[*]=[*]LIN(1) LDATA[*]=[*]Adata SOLUTION. Other random effects shown in the specified model were simply coded by a separate RANDOM statement. A similar application in genomic selection using SAS Proc MIXED and its LIN(1) structure is given by Piepho et al. (2012).|$|E
40|$|This {{document}} describes three performance improve-ments made to PROC SQL for Version 7 of the SAS System. These improvements are: • {{development of}} an implicit, or automatic, form of PassThrough to enable better execution of PROC SQL queries that referenced one or more data sets via SAS/ACCESS ® software, • enabling any WHERE clause specified by a <b>procedure</b> <b>statement</b> to be pushed down into a view referenced in the DATA = option of that procedure, and • making the most common use of an alias much less expensive. IMPLICIT PASSTHROUGH Implicit PassThrough (IP) {{is the result of}} a collaborative effort between the PROC SQL and SAS/ACCESS groups. The goal of this effort is to provide you with an automatic and implicit mechanism that provides many of the benefits of the PassThrough facility in PROC SQL when your PROC SQL query references one or more DBMS tables associated with a single libname engine. These benefits will occur without any need for you to use any special syntax or even be aware that DBMS tables are involved in the query — PROC SQL will simply take care of matters behind the scene, so to speak. This new mechanism is intended to complement, rather than replace, the existing PassThrough mechanism. There is still very much a need for PassThrough, e. g., you may want to ask the DBMS to do a natural join. PROC SQL won’t support natural join syntax until Version 9. In the meantime, you will need to use PassThrough in order to get the syntax past the PROC SQL parser. Before delving more into the workings of IP, let us briefly consider how, in Version 6, you would do an inner/outer join of two tables from the same DBMS. In Version 6, if a query involved tables from a DBMS such as DB 2 ®, Informix®, Oracle®, or Sybase ® there were basically three choices [Kent 1996] w. r. t. result materialization of an inner/outer join: • create one or more SAS/ACCESS descriptors of the tables to assist in bringing the data over to the SAS side and do all the work there using PROC SQL, or • use the PROC SQL PassThrough facility [Kent 1996] to pass the whole query or parts of the query to the DBMS, or • create a view of the join in the DBMS, then create...|$|E

(However, most database systems implement statement caches and other methods to avoid repetitively compiling dynamic SQL statements.) Also, while they avoid some pre-compiled SQL, statements add to the complexity of creating an optimal execution plan because not all arguments of the SQL statement are supplied at compile time. Depending on the specific database implementation and configuration, mixed performance results will be seen from stored procedures versus generic queries or user defined functions.|$|R

Usually, the investigations stated in MD literature cover lab-scale experiments to analyse the technology's potential.

Special attention is given to the influence of salinity on module performance. The salt rejection rate thr oughout all experiments is very high and almost independent from any studied operational parameters. Finally, a preliminary approach shows the feasibility of high purity distillate production with the spiral wound modules.

This problem {{can be seen as}} a mathematical programming problem with a convex objective function and equilibrium contraints. For the euclidean error, an enumerative approach is proposed, which is a polynomial method in the sample size n, for a fixed dimension m.

Some numerical results with both algorithms are included to highlight the efficiency of those <b>procedures.</b> <b>Statement</b> of scope and purpose The problem addressed here is found in applications of neural networks, nonlinear regression and data classification. Due to its nonconvex character, the application of classical nonlinear programming tools lead only to (usually suboptimal) local minima.

By achieving global optimality in reasonable time, the method compares favorably to previously proposed approaches. Key words: Least-squares problems, hinge functions, MPEC problems...|$|R

With respect to the current political situation, examples of war and terror from both Western and Arabian parties and terrorist organizations are chosen. The cases are exemplified by selected speeches and explanations from (1) the American Government justifying the military strikes in Afghanistan (2001 -) and the war in Iraq (2003 -) (2) the Red Army Faction (RAF) justifying terrorist attacks that they perpetrated in Germany between 1972 and 1984 (3) the former President of Iraq justifying the war against Iran (1980 - 1988), and (4) members of Al-Qaeda justifying terrorist acts between 2001 and 2004. In a first rating <b>procedure,</b> <b>statements</b> containing justifications of politically motivated violence will be identified based upon argumentation analysis.
