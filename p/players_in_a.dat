5|$|Games {{are played}} for entertainment—{{sometimes}} purely for entertainment, sometimes for achievement or reward as well. They {{can be played}} alone, in teams, or online; by amateurs or by professionals. The players may have an audience of non-players, such as when people are entertained by watching a chess championship. On the other hand, <b>players</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> game may constitute their own audience as they take their turn to play. Often, part of the entertainment for children playing a game is deciding who {{is part of their}} audience and who is a player.|$|E

5|$|An online version, Black & White: The Gathering, was in development, {{and would}} have enabled creatures to {{interact}} those of other <b>players</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> cut-down game environment over the internet. Lionhead planned to release Black & White: The Gathering {{two months before the}} main game's release as a free download, and it was to offer a choice of creatures. It would have linked with chat programs such as AOL instant messenger and ICQ and convert text to a speech bubble from the creature. It was intended for players to be able to upload the main game's creature into Black & White: The Gathering and its experiences to be saved into the main game. Another online program, Black & White Worlds, was in development. This would have taken place in the worlds of the main game. Molyneux explained that there was to be a server, whose worlds would have been set up with a match-making system and players {{would have been able to}} do battle, like last man standing. There was also a plan to produce Black & White Universe, in which players would have had a persistent online world.|$|E
5|$|In Kinkladze's {{first season}} at the club, Dinamo won a league and cup double. However, due to the ongoing Georgian Civil War, during 1993 the Dinamo Tbilisi {{management}} sought to put their <b>players</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> more stable environment. As part of this, Kinkladze was sent on loan to 1. FC Saarbrücken in Germany. Kinkladze made his Saarbrücken debut in a 2. Bundesliga match against Tennis Borussia Berlin, a 2–2 draw on 4 March 1994. He was unable to settle into the side at Saarbrücken, rarely playing a full 90 minutes, and was sent off in a 1–3 defeat to Hertha Berlin. At {{the end of the}} season, Kinkladze returned to Tbilisi to resume his career in Georgia, where he was named the national Player of the Year for 1993. Dinamo president Merab Jordania was still uncomfortable with Kinkladze playing in Georgia amid political instability, and offered the player to Atlético Madrid for approximately £200,000; they gave him a trial, but no contract. He then trained with Real Madrid's reserves, where he caught the eye of Boca Juniors scouts, who took him to Argentina for a month's loan. Kinkladze met his childhood hero Diego Maradona, but did not gain a permanent contract, as manager Silvio Marzolini regarded him as too similar to Boca's Argentine international playmaker Alberto Márcico.|$|E

5|$|June had offseason foot {{surgery in}} February 2008. During the opening {{game of the}} season, Brooks {{suffered}} a hamstring injury and removed himself from {{the game in the}} third quarter, which fueled speculation during the following week that he would miss the first start of his fourteen-year career and that June would start on the weakside. Brooks, however, made his 194th-consecutive start the following week. In a story not published until four weeks later, Minnesota Vikings running back Adrian Peterson claims that June attempted to injure him in a November 16 game. June made his first interception of the season and second as a Buccaneer on a Drew Brees pass that was tipped by Ronde Barber in the twelfth game of the season as Tampa earned its fourth consecutive victory to improve its record to 93 on November 30 against the New Orleans Saints. After the Buccaneers lost their final four games to miss the playoffs, the Buccaneers replaced Jon Gruden and Bruce Allen with Raheem Morris and Mark Dominik as head coach and general manager. The team subsequently released five veteran <b>players</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> move that was said to be unrelated to the salary cap. June was released by the Buccaneers on February 25, 2009 along with Derrick Brooks, Ike Hilliard, Warrick Dunn and Joey Galloway. The transaction avoided a $2million roster bonus for June.|$|E
5|$|Marvel vs. Capcom 3 {{includes}} online play using Microsoft's Xbox Live and Sony's PlayStation Network services. Online multiplayer includes ranked matches, where players {{battle to}} increase their rank and ascend the game's leaderboards; player matches, which do not bestow rank and offer options for quick rematches; and player lobbies, which allow up to eight <b>players</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> single room {{to compete in a}} king of the hill-style format. When an online match begins, both players can view their opponent's License Card.

The following season, he played only for the Indians, an affiliate of the Pittsburgh Pirates.

After the season, he was sold to the double-A Toronto Maple Leafs of the International League, where, under managers Tony Lazzeri and Jack Burns, Pezzullo won 11 games and lost 12. He went 5–16 the following year, before leaving the team for the Syracuse Chiefs and the Buffalo Bisons in his final year of professional baseball in 1941.|$|E

5|$|In 2009, England {{participated in}} both the Women's Cricket World Cup, and the inaugural Women's World Twenty20. Taylor was {{identified}} as one of England's key <b>players</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> preview of the tournament, and she set up victory for England in their opening match against Sri Lanka with her eighth ODI century, her third in successive World Cup matches against Sri Lanka. She asserted her dominance once more in the second match, against India, scoring quicker than a run a ball for her 69 not out, to help England chase down a modest total in under 40 overs. Not required to bat against Pakistan, and dismissed for 19 against New Zealand, Taylor helped secure England's place in the final with a rapid 65 runs, including 2 sixes and 6 fours, against the West Indies. In England's final match of the group stages, Taylor top-scored with 49 runs in a dead rubber loss against Australia: Australia could not qualify for the final, and England were already through. In the final, having restricted New Zealand to 166, England were ahead of the required rate early. An early loss of wicket brought Taylor to the crease, and she played an attacking innings of 21, including 4 fours, before being bowled. England won the match by four wickets, to become ODI world champions. Taylor finished the tournament as the leading run-scorer, having made 324 runs, and her batting average was the highest amongst batsmen with over 100 runs. She was one of five England players to be named in the team of the tournament.|$|E
