25|$|The {{elevated}} {{section is}} supported by steel-reinforced concrete columns. The roadway itself was constructed on top of concrete slabs supported by steel girders. The height of the elevated section is higher than required to cross city streets and <b>provide</b> <b>clearance</b> underneath. The intent of this was to reduce traffic noise at ground level. The highest point of the elevated section is the eastbound ramp from the Gardiner to the Don Valley Parkway which goes {{up and over the}} westbound lanes, then drops to ground level. The elevated sections of the Gardiner use a tall wall concrete barrier topped with green metal blades. The blades act to reduce the glare of oncoming headlights from the opposing direction of traffic. During the original construction concrete parapet walls with metal railings were used in the outer sections as well as a divider between west bound and east bound traffic. At grade sections west of Bathurst Street use steel guard rails, but originally featured a narrow grass median.|$|E
2500|$|On 23 June 1948, {{the first}} {{production}} Vampire Fighter-Bomber Mk 5 (otherwise commonly {{designated as the}} FB.5), which had been modified from a Vampire F.3, carried out its maiden flight. The FB.5 retained the Goblin III engine of the F.3, but featured armour protection around engine systems, wings clipped back by 1ft (30cm), and longer-stroke main landing gear to handle greater takeoff weights and <b>provide</b> <b>clearance</b> for stores/weapons load. An external tank or 500lb (227kg) bomb could be carried under each wing, and eight [...] "3-inch" [...] rocket projectiles ("RPs") could be stacked in pairs on four attachments inboard of the booms. Although an ejection seat was considered, it was not fitted.|$|E

2500|$|As well {{as having}} {{most of the}} {{standard}} Mk V features this version had several important changes over the earlier Mk V, {{most of which were}} first tested on the Mk III. These included the re-stressed and strengthened fuselage structure and the new windscreen design, which was also used on some Vb Spitfires. The Vc also introduced the Type C or [...] "Universal" [...] wing along with the revised main undercarriage; the tops of these wings featured large, bulged fairings to <b>provide</b> <b>clearance</b> for the ammunition feed motors of two Hispano cannon. Later, because two cannon were seldom fitted, these fairings were later reduced in size to more streamlined shapes. A deeper radiator fairing was fitted under the starboard wing and a larger oil cooler [...] with a deeper, kinked air outlet was fitted underneath the port wing. In addition more armour plating was added, protecting the bottom of the pilot's seat and the wing ammunition boxes.|$|E
2500|$|Flight {{described}} the L.71 as a flying boat on wheels because, in the 1920s, such aircraft were almost the only modern pusher biplanes. Visually, {{the most unusual}} feature was the extreme stagger, introduced to optimise the view {{for each of the}} occupants of its tandem cockpits. [...] Both wings had spruce spars, continuous from tip to tip, and spruce ribs. The larger upper wing had no dihedral but carried the ailerons; the lower wing had 1.5° of dihedral. Outward leaning, aluminium tube N-form interplane struts braced the wings but there was none of the usual flying wire bracing in the single bay; the wings were aerodynamically quite thick, allowing them to be internally braced cantilevers. The upper wing centre section was supported by a shorter pair of outward leaning N struts from the upper fuselage. Though the lower plane was set at mid-fuselage the interplane gap was large, to <b>provide</b> <b>clearance</b> for the two blade propeller.|$|E
2500|$|Cornwall was {{an attempt}} to avoid the {{damaging}} long wheelbase of the Cramptons, whilst still permitting large driving wheels. By moving the driving axle ahead of the firebox, one of the carrying axles could be moved backwards, giving a shorter overall wheelbase. The difficulty of how to fit the axles past the boiler recurred, to which Trevithick provided an [...] "extremely complicated" [...] solution. The boiler was placed entirely underneath the driving axle. Even then, it was necessary to recess a transverse channel {{across the top of the}} boiler, so as to <b>provide</b> <b>clearance</b> for the driving axle. The trailing carrying axle passed through a crosswise tube through the middle of the firebox. This made assembly difficult, but as it was only a straight carrying axle rather than a cranked driving axle, the tube diameter required was manageable. This use of a cross-firebox axle tube was part of Crampton's patent of 1842. As completed in 1847, and first numbered 173, Cornwall was a 4-2-2 with 8'6" [...] drivers, paired leading wheels of 3'6", single trailing wheels of 4' and an overall wheelbase of 16'6". This is the condition in which she was exhibited at The Great Exhibition of 1851.|$|E

5|$|The hook (α) {{angle is}} a {{parameter}} {{of the material}} being cut. For steel, it is between 15 and 20° and for cast iron it is between 6 and 8°. The back-off (γ) <b>provides</b> <b>clearance</b> for the teeth so that they don't rub on the workpiece; it is usually between 1 and 3°.|$|R
2500|$|On {{turned parts}} an {{undercut}} {{is also known}} as a neck or [...] "relief groove". They are often used {{at the end of the}} threaded portion of a shaft or screw to <b>provide</b> <b>clearance</b> for the cutting tool, and also referred to as thread relief in this context. A rule of thumb is that the undercut should be at least 1.5 threads long and the diameter should be at least [...] smaller than the minor diameter of the thread. Strictly speaking the relief simply needs to be equal or slightly smaller than the minor diameter of the thread. [...] Thread relief can also be internal on a bore, and then the relief needs to be larger than the major thread diameter. [...] They are also often used on shafts that have diameter changes so that a mating part can seat against the shoulder. If an undercut is not provided there is always a small radius left behind even if a sharp corner is intended. These types of undercuts are called out on technical drawings by stating the width and either the depth or the diameter of the bottom of the neck.|$|E
