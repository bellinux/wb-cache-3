5|$|There are varying tales {{as to the}} {{inspiration}} for Deere to create the invention he is famed for, the steel plow. In one version he recalled the way the polished steel pitchfork tines moved through hay and soil and thought that the same effect could be obtained for a plow. By early 1838, Deere completed his first steel plow and sold it to a local farmer, Lewis Crandall. Crandall spread word of his success with Deere's plow quickly, and two neighbors soon placed orders with Deere. By 1841 he was manufacturing 75 <b>plows</b> per year, and 100 <b>plows</b> per year in 1876.|$|E
5|$|In 1836, native Vermonter John Deere set {{out from}} Rutland, Vermont to Grand Detour, Illinois, founded by his friend and fellow Vermont native Leonard Andrus. The town lacked a local blacksmith, Deere's trade, and within two days Deere had a forge and new {{business}} established. In Vermont, Deere produced <b>plows</b> made from cast-iron and when he first arrived in Illinois he produced the same <b>plows.</b> Soil conditions in Illinois differ from those in Vermont. In Vermont the soil is sandy and falls easily away from the plow blade but in Illinois the soil is thicker and wetter; it stuck to the plow {{and had to be}} scraped off by the farmer as he plowed.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{the advent}} of iron {{reinforced}} <b>plows</b> and other improved methods of crop cultivation, the regional environmental conditions placed limits on the practicality and extend of land tillage, but various grains, beans and peas were grown. The dense forest coverage {{on the other hand}} facilitated gathering and was more amenable to the raising of farm animals, which involved all of the major species, including in particular the small, forest type horses. The horses constituted an important element of the Baltic tribes' culture – men of the upper socioeconomic status were often buried with their horses and even together with their fancy horsemanship gear.|$|E

The two main classes are horse <b>plowing,</b> and tractor <b>plowing.</b> Some different <b>plowing</b> classes for tractors include depend on how many furrows the <b>plow</b> has. Other tractor <b>plowing</b> classes include antique <b>plowing,</b> and 4H (youth) <b>plowing.</b> <b>Plowing</b> is [...] "judged for straightness, firmness, evenness, depth, shape and uniformity. A good <b>plowed</b> furrow must be straight with a smooth trough and clean, even sides." ...|$|R

5|$|From 1876, the South Saskatchewan river {{crossing}} at St. Louis was via ferry. In 1912, the railway built a rail {{bridge across the}} river, and in 1928, the vehicle lanes were added. After 1907, the highway was constructed south of Chamberlain and reached Buffalo Pound. At this time two horse scrapers and walking <b>plows</b> were the implements of road construction technology. This highway received an improvement in 1926 which then used an elevating grader, 16 horses and a dump wagon.|$|E
5|$|The breed was {{originally}} developed for general {{use on the}} farms of the Appalachian foothills, where it was found pulling <b>plows</b> and buggies, working cattle and being ridden by both adults and children. Today, it is still used for working cattle, as well as endurance riding and pleasure riding. The breed's gait and disposition make it sought out by elderly and disabled riders. Each September, the Kentucky Horse Park hosts the International Rocky Mountain Horse Show.|$|E
5|$|In road {{snow and}} ice control, brine is often used as an anti-icer rather than a de-icer. A vehicle carries a tank of brine, which is sprayed on the road surface before or {{at the onset of}} the storm. This keeps {{snow and ice}} from {{adhering}} to the surface and makes mechanical removal by <b>plows</b> easier. Solid salt is also wetted with brine or other liquid deicer. This speeds de-icing action and helps keep it from bouncing off the pavement into the gutter or ditch. Brine acts faster than solid salt and does not require compression by passing traffic to become effective. The brine is also more environmentally friendly, as less salt is required to treat the same length of road.|$|E
2500|$|The Mishna (Shabbat 7:2) lists <b>plowing</b> after planting, {{although}} one must <b>plow</b> a field before planting. The Gemara asks why this order occurs and answers {{that the author}} of this Mishna was a Tanna living in Israel, where the ground is hard. Since the ground is so hard in Israel, it needed to be <b>plowed</b> both before planting and after planting. The Mishna lists <b>plowing</b> second, teaching that the second <b>plowing</b> (after planting) is [...] prohibited. (The <b>plowing</b> before the planting is also prohibited, if not by the Torah, certainly Rabbinically). The Rambam lists <b>plowing</b> first, and planting second.|$|R

5000|$|Wood {{received}} {{a patent on}} an initial version of a cast-iron moldboard <b>plow</b> in 1814, and patented improvements on that <b>plow</b> in 1819. [...] The 1819 patent was the 19th patent issued for a <b>plow</b> in the United States. [...] The first patent on a cast-iron <b>plow</b> had been issued to Charles Newbold of New Jersey in 1793. During {{the development of the}} <b>plow,</b> he corresponded with Thomas Jefferson, who had been working on an improvement to the <b>plow</b> along slightly different lines.|$|R
5|$|The Przeworsk culture {{people of}} the earlier Roman period lived in small, {{unprotected}} villages, populated each by a few dozen residents at most, made up of several houses, usually set partially below the ground level (semi-sunken), each covering an area of 8–22 square meters. They knew how to dig and build wells, so the settlements didn't have to be located near bodies of water. Thirteen 2nd century wells with variously constructed timber lined walls were found at a settlement in Stanisławice, Bochnia County. Fields were being used for crop cultivation {{for a while and}} then as pastures, when animal excrement helped the soil regain fertility. Once iron share <b>plows</b> were introduced the fields were alternated between tillage and grazing.|$|E
5|$|To protect crops {{from wind}} and drought, the grain intendant Zhao Guo (趙過) created the {{alternating}} fields system (daitianfa 代田法) during Emperor Wu's reign. This system switched {{the positions of}} furrows and ridges between growing seasons. Once experiments with this system yielded successful results, the government officially sponsored it and encouraged peasants to use it. Han farmers also used the pit field system (aotian 凹田) for growing crops, which involved heavily fertilized pits that did not require <b>plows</b> or oxen and could be placed on sloping terrain. In southern and small parts of central Han-era China, paddy fields were chiefly used to grow rice, while farmers along the Huai River used transplantation methods of rice production.|$|E
5|$|An {{occluded}} front is formed {{during the process}} of cyclogenesis when a cold front overtakes a warm front. The cold and warm fronts curve naturally poleward into the point of occlusion, which is also known as the triple point in meteorology. It lies within a sharp trough, but the air mass behind the boundary can be either warm or cold. In a cold occlusion, the air mass overtaking the warm front is cooler than the cool air ahead of the warm front, and <b>plows</b> under both air masses. In a warm occlusion, the air mass overtaking the warm front is not as cool as the cold air ahead of the warm front, and rides over the colder air mass while lifting the warm air. A wide variety of weather can be found along an {{occluded front}}, with thunderstorms possible, but usually their passage is associated with a drying of the air mass. Occluded fronts are indicated on a weather map by a purple line with alternating half-circles and triangles pointing in direction of travel. Occluded fronts usually form around mature low pressure areas.|$|E

5|$|Heavy {{moldboard}} iron plow: Although use of {{the simple}} wooden ard in China must have preceded it, the earliest discovered Chinese iron <b>plows</b> date to roughly 500 BC, during the Zhou Dynasty (1122–256 BC) and were flat, V-shaped, and mounted on wooden poles and handles. By the 3rd century BC, improved iron casting techniques {{led to the development}} of the heavy moldboard plow, seen in Han Dynasty (202 BC– 220 AD) artwork such as tomb carved bricks. The moldboard allowed the Chinese to turn farm soil without clogging the plowshare with dirt, which was flung off the wheelbarrow via slanted wings on both sides. While the frame of excavated plowshares dating to the Warring States period (403–221 BC) were made mostly of perishable wood except for the iron blade, the frame of excavated plowshares dating to the Han Dynasty were made entirely of solid iron with the moldboard attached to the top to turn the soil.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} days, houses were wooden boards fronted by a four-board-high fence which was fronted with a boardwalk. Most {{of the streets}} were dirt roads. Winters were bitterly cold, and teams of horses {{dragging}} V-shaped wooden <b>plows</b> cleared the streets. In {{the center of town}} was the community pump, from which the village would draw water at stipulated hours. Water was pumped from the mine twice a day through a big open pipe. Everyone had to carry water home during pumping time. There was no shutoff valve, so buckets, tubs and barrels were used for water storage. Later, a water tower was built to hold water drawn from a deep well. St. Bernard dogs helped carry the water from the well to the homes. Running water and bathtubs came only after ditches were dug for pipes to provide water from Gilbert around 1916. Kerosene lamps provided the means of lighting until 1916, when power lines were installed. Initially, the only telephone was at the Elba mine office.|$|E
5|$|Modern {{archaeologists have}} {{unearthed}} Han iron farming tools throughout China, from Inner Mongolia {{in the north}} to Yunnan in the south. The spade, shovel, pick, and plow were used for tillage, the hoe for weeding, the rake for loosening the soil, and the sickle for harvesting crops. Depending on their size, Han <b>plows</b> were driven by either one ox or two oxen. Oxen were also used to pull the three-legged iron seed drill (invented in Han China by the 2nd century BCE), which enabled farmers to plant seeds in precise rows instead of casting them out by hand. While artwork of the Wei (220–265 CE) and Jin (265–420 CE) periods show use of the harrow for breaking up chunks of soil after plowing, it perhaps first appeared in China during the Eastern Han (25–220 CE). Irrigation works for agriculture included the use of water wells, artificial ponds and embankments, dams, canals, and sluice gates.|$|E

40|$|The {{study was}} carried out to {{increase}} the productivity of marginal soil by deep tillage method. The study was located in Mangunan, Giriredjo, Bantul, {{during the period of}} August to December 1995. Randomized Completely Block Design was employed with three replications and treatments. The treatments are : no <b>plowing</b> (A), soil <b>plowing</b> at the depth of 10 cm (B) and soil <b>plowing</b> at the depth of 50 cm (C). Result of the study revealed that the highest yield of Zea mays was found on the no <b>plowed</b> marginal soil. Those are 29, 67 kw/ha for the <b>plowed</b> soil at the depth of 50 cm and 7, 48 kw/ha for the no <b>plowed</b> marginal soil, respectively. Significant different of yield/ha was suspected due to more stable water supply from root zone (as indicated by higher water retention and total porosity), the lower soil penetration and soil bulk density of the <b>plowed</b> soil at the depth of 50 cm than at the no <b>plowed</b> soil.

5|$|The Celts practiced {{advanced}} {{agriculture and}} favored fertile lands; they {{brought with them}} and disseminated the inventions, including a variety of tools, and other achievements of La Tène culture. Celtic farmers used <b>plows</b> with iron shares and fertilized fields with animal manure. Their livestock consisted of selected breeds, especially sheep and large cattle. The rotational querns that they invented had a stationary lower stone and an upper one rotated by a lever. Iron was obtained in greater quantities from locally available turf ores; its metallurgy and processing were improved, resulting in the manufacturing of stronger and more resistant tools and weapons. The ceramic shops used the potter's wheel and produced with great precision (especially the Tyniec group) baked, thin walled, painted vessels, {{one of the best}} in Europe. Domed bilevel furnaces were used, the pots being placed on a perforated clay shelf, with the hearth underneath. Glass and enamel were produced, gold and semi-precious stones were processed for jewelry.|$|E

The Minneapolis Wi-Fi network earns $1.2 million annual profit {{and as of}} 2010 has about 20,000 customers. The city treats and distributes water and requires payment of a monthly solid waste fee for trash removal, recycling, and drop off for large items. Residents who recycle receive a credit. Hazardous waste is handled by Hennepin County drop off sites. After each significant snowfall, called a snow emergency, the Minneapolis Public Works Street Division <b>plows</b> over 1,000 miles (1,609km) of streets and 400 miles (643.7km) of alleys—counting both sides, the distance between Minneapolis and Seattle and back.

40|$|Mechanical {{stress is}} listed as a main risk factor for {{cartilage}} degradation. The {{aim of this study}} was to investigate the biological response of cartilage to dynamic loading such as <b>plowing.</b> Cartilage strips harvested from bovine nasal septum were submitted to <b>plowing</b> using a cylindrical indenter, applying a constant normal force in the vertical axis and moving at constant speed in the horizontal axis. After <b>plowing,</b> cell viability, gene expression and glycosaminoglycan (GAG) release were measured with conventional assays. The cell-viability assay and qRT-PCR showed that <b>plowing</b> induces cell death and matrix metalloproteinase 3 (MMP- 3) upregulation. The addition of actinomycin D, before or after <b>plowing,</b> confirmed that <b>plowing</b> was responsible for the observed MMP- 3 upregulation. Even if the transcriptions of the tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase (TIMP- 1), aggrecan (Agg), collagen type I (Coll 1), collagen type II (Coll 2) and fibronectin (Fn) were not significantly affected by <b>plowing,</b> actinomycin D treatment revealed that <b>plowing</b> induces a strong increase in TIMP- 1 and Coll 1 messenger RNA content and influences the gene regulation of Agg, Coll 2 and Fn. Furthermore, <b>plowed</b> cartilage explants exhibited enhanced GAG release. Application of hydroxamate MMP inhibitor after loading showed that <b>plowing</b> induces GAG release via the activation of catabolic enzymes. <b>Plowing</b> causes cell death of the chondrocytes closer to the surface as well as matrix damage, observed as GAG loss. Moreover, in healthy chondrocytes, <b>plowing</b> promotes the production and activation of catabolic enzymes like MMP- 3...|$|R
