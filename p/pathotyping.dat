40|$|Haemophilus parasuis is {{a diverse}} {{bacterial}} species {{found in the}} upper respiratory tract of pigs that can also cause Glässer's disease and pneumonia. A previous pan-genome study of H. parasuis identified 48 genes that were associated with clinical disease. Here we describe {{the development of a}} generalised linear model (termed a <b>pathotyping</b> model) to predict the potential virulence of isolates of H. parasuis, based on a subset of 10 genes from the pan-genome. A multiplex PCR (mPCR) was constructed based on these genes, the results of which were entered into the <b>pathotyping</b> model to yield a prediction of virulence. This new diagnostic mPCR was tested on 143 field isolates of H. parasuis that had previously been whole-genome sequenced and a further 84 isolates from the UK from cases of H. parasuis-related disease in pigs collected between 2013 and 2014. The combination of the mPCR and the <b>pathotyping</b> model predicted the virulence of an isolate with 78 % accuracy for the original isolate collection, and 90 % for the additional isolate collection, providing an overall accuracy of 83 % (81 % sensitivity and 93 % specificity) when compared with the 'current standard' of detailed clinical meta-data.

40|$|Aim: Newcastle {{disease is}} still one of the major threats for poultry {{industry}} allover the world. Therefore, attempt was made in this study to use the SYBR Green I real-time PCR with melting curves analysis as for detection and differentiation of NDV strains in suspected infected birds. Materials and Methods: Two sets of primers were used to amplify matrix and fusion genes in samples collected from suspectly infected birds (chickens and pigeons). Melting curve analysis in conjunction with real time PCR was conducted for identifying different pathotypes of the isolated NDVs. Clinical samples were propagated on specific pathogen free ECE and tested for MDT and ICIP. Results: The velogenic NDVs isolated from chickens and pigeons were distinguished with mean T 85. 03 &# 177; 0. 341 and m 83. 78 &# 177; 0. 237 respectively for M-gene amplification and for F-gene amplification the mean T were 84. 04 &# 177; 0. 037 and m 84. 53 &# 177; 0. 223. On the other hand the lentogenic NDV isolates including the vaccinal strains (HB 1 and LaSota) have a higher mean T (86. 99 &# 177; 0. 021 for M-gene amplification and 86. 50 &# 177; 0. 063 for F-gene amplification). The test showed no reaction with m unrelated RNA samples. In addition, the results were in good agreement with both virus isolation and biological <b>pathotyping</b> (MDT and ICIP). The assay offers an attractive alternative method for the diagnosis of NDV that can be easily applied in laboratory diagnosis as a screening test for the detection and differentiation of NDV infections. Conclusion: As was shown by the successful rapid detection and <b>pathotyping</b> of 15 NDV strains in clinical samples representing velogenic and lentogenic NDV strains, and the agreement with the results of virus isolation, biological <b>pathotyping</b> and pathogenicity indices. The results of this report suggests that the described SybrGreen I real-time RT-PCR assay in conjunction with Melting curve analysis used as a rapid, specific and simple diagnostic tools for detection and <b>pathotyping</b> of different NDVs in clinically infected birds.

Both were validated against 65 H 7 AIVs, 57 non-H 7 AIVs and 259 poultry swabs in comparison to M gene (AI generic) RRT PCR and virus isolation (VI). An additional 38 swabs and 20 tissue specimens extended validation against M gene RRT PCR. Results Both H 7 RRT PCRs amplified all 61 Eurasian lineage H 7 AIVs and none of 57 non-H 7 AIVs. A total of 297 poultry swabs {{were used to determine}} diagnostic sensitivity and specificity relative to M gene RRT PCR, sensitivity was 95 center dot 4 % and 64 center dot 6 % for the HA 2 and CS RRT PCRs respectively, and specificity 97 center dot 9 % and 99 center dot 6 % respectively. The H 7 HA 2 RRT PCR was more sensitive than VI.

PCR is advantageous due to its simplicity, lower cross-reactivity, and unlimited reagent supply. Currently, the only available hemagglutinin (HA) subtyping primer set that can subtype H 1 through H 15 is not fully evaluated and, since it only targets HA 1, is unavailable for molecular <b>pathotyping</b> of AI viruses. Our preliminary experiments found that these primer sets were cross-reactive and missed some recent AI viruses. In this study, we developed new primer sets against HA cleavage sites for subtyping H 1 to H 15 genes and for molecular <b>pathotyping.</b> Our primer sets were subtype specific and detected 99 % of previously identified HA genes (115 / 116, 1949 to March 2006), and the correct amplifications of HA genes were confirmed by sequence analyses of all 115 PCR products. The primer sets successfully subtyped most of the recent AI viruses isolated in Japan (96 % [101 / 105], October 2006 to March 2007). Taken together, our primer sets could efficiently detect HA genes (98 % [216 / 221]) of both previously and recently identified HA genes or of both American (29 / 29) and Eurasian (187 / 192) lineages. All 38 H 5 and 13 H 7 viruses were molecularly pathotyped by sequencing analyses of the HA cleavage site. In contrast, despite efficient detection of previously identified strains (98 % [114 / 116]), the published primer sets exhibited lower specificity and lower detection efficiency against recent AI viruses (80 % [84 of 105]). These results indicate that our primers are useful not only for HA subtyping but also for molecular <b>pathotyping</b> of both previous and recent AI viruses.

The array consists of one probe for the conserved matrix gene and 97 probes targeting the HA 0 cleavage-site region. Following fragment amplification by a generic PCR approach, the array enables AIV detection, hemagglutinin (HA) subtyping, and <b>pathotyping</b> within a single assay. For validation, a panel of 92 influenza A viruses which included 43 reference strains representing all 16 HA subtypes was used. All reference strains were correctly typed with respect to their HA subtypes and pathotypes, including HPAIV H 5 N 1 /Asia, which caused outbreaks in Germany in 2006 and 2007. In addition, differentiation of strains of the Eurasian and North American lineages of the H 5 and H 7 subtypes was possible.

There was {{little or no}} interisolate variability in RAPD fragment patterns within each <b>pathotype.</b> Passage of an isolate of <b>pathotype</b> 3, originally from an Australian grasshopper (Praxibulus sp.), through a North American grasshopper resulted in no differences in the resultant RAPD fragment patterns. In the second method, polymorphic RAPD fragments were used to probe the genomic DNA from the three <b>pathotypes,</b> and pathotype-specific fragments were found. In the third method, restriction fragments from genomic DNA of the three <b>pathotypes</b> were cloned and screened for <b>pathotype</b> specificity. A genomic probe specific for each <b>pathotype</b> was isolated. These probes did not hybridize to DNA from Ento- mophaga aulicae or from grasshoppers. To facilitate the use of RAPD analysis and other molecular tools to identify <b>pathotypes,</b> a method for extracting DNA from resting spores from infected grasshoppers was devel- oped. The DNA from the fractured resting spores was of sufficient integrity to be blotted and probed with the pathotype-specific DNA probes, thus validating {{the use of these}} probes for <b>pathotype</b> identification in field- collected grasshoppers...|$|R
40|$|The {{spreading}} {{of highly}} virulent isolates of Verticillium dahliae, causing Verticillium wilt of olive, {{is one of}} the most threatening concerns for olive cultivation. Using an isolate collection from infected olive trees in southern Spain, the morphology of microsclerotia (MS) produced on water agar was correlated with their molecular characteristics by a PCR-based <b>pathotyping.</b> Defoliating isolates (D) produced MS with a significantly higher length/width ratio than non-defoliating (ND) ones. These parameters were correlated using the logistic model log (y/ 1 -y) = 3. 73 L/W- 6. 95, when the pathotype was regressed on length/width ratio of the propagules. Inflection point of the logistic curve corresponded to length/width= 1. 86. This morphological differentiation of virulence groups could be a simple and useful tool at commercial laboratories for the assignation of the pathotype of V. dahliae isolates during routine microbiological-based diagnosis. © 2012 Blackwell Verlag GmbH.

30|$|Out of the 146 pooled samples tested, 44 were {{positive}} for NDV by both HA/HI and M gene real-time RT-PCR tests. Out of these, 29 isolates {{were identified as}} virulent based on the real-time RT-PCR of F gene. Among these, 14 Tracheal swab pools (TS) {{were positive}} though the corresponding Cloacal swab pools (CS) were negative. Similarly, 3 CS were positive though the corresponding TS were negative. However, the remaining 12 swab pools have shown direct correlation (12 TS and the corresponding 12 CS were positive) and were not considered as separate entity to avoid double counting of the samples (Table  2). The identification, <b>pathotyping</b> and genotyping of the 29 isolates were confirmed by genetic sequencing of the 260 bp region of fusion (F) gene and the complete F gene sequence of two isolates (KJ 958913 _ 13 VIR 3936 - 1 and KJ 958914 _ 13 VIR 3936 - 27) collected from the market sites Saris and Kotebe. Since all the viruses showed a high similarity at the 260 bp region of the F gene (Table  2), the selection {{was based on the}} sequencing quality (i.e. absence of degenerate bases).|$|E
40|$|We {{report the}} <b>pathotyping</b> of six Australian {{isolates}} of Marek&# 039;s disease virus- 1 (MDV 1) isolated between 1992 and 2004 and association of virulence with meq gene polymorphism. Unvaccinated and herpesvirus of turkeys (HVT) -vaccinated specific pathogen free chickens were challenged at day 5 with 500 plaque forming units of Marek&# 039;s disease virus. The isolates induced gross Marek&# 039;s disease lesions in 53 to 94 % of unvaccinated chickens, and HVT induced a protective index ranging from 38 to 100 % by 56 days post challenge. This experiment provides evidence that current Australian isolates of MDV 1 vary significantly in pathogenicity. However, {{there was no}} clear evidence that the most virulent recent isolates were more pathogenic than isolates from the 1980 s or {{that any of the}} isolates belong to the highest pathotype category of very virulent plus. Evidence is presented that virulence can be predicted by measurements taken as early as 13 days post challenge. The meq gene sequences of five of the isolates used in the experiment were determined. When compared with the very virulent US isolate Md 5, there was a 177 base-pair insertion and distinct point mutations in each of the five isolates...|$|E
40|$|Canadian {{isolates}} of Leptosphaeria maculans, {{the causal}} agent of blackleg of crucifers, were examined for genetic relatedness by the random amplified polymorphic DNA assay. DNA polymorphisms amplified with random decamer primers {{were used to}} distinguish three groups of isolates. Group 1 contained all isolates of the virulent <b>pathotype,</b> group 2 contained isolates of the avirulent <b>pathotype</b> from western Canada, and group 3 contained avirulent <b>pathotype</b> isolates from Ontario. These results agreed with other reports which showed many genetic differences between <b>pathotypes</b> and {{were consistent with the}} hypothesis that the virulent <b>pathotype</b> was recently introduced into Canada and has diverged relatively little. In contrast, the avirulent <b>pathotype</b> has probably been present in Canada for a longer time and has diverged with geographic isolation. In addition to establishing genetic relationships, DNA fingerprints generated by the random amplified polymorphic DNA assay have potential applications in <b>pathotype</b> identification and blackleg disease management...|$|R
40|$|Puccinia triticina reproduces asexually in France {{and thus}} {{individual}} genotype is {{the unit of}} selection. A strong link has been observed between genotype identities (as assessed by microsatellite markers) and <b>pathotypes</b> (pools of individuals with the same combination of qualitative virulence factors). Here, we tested whether differences in quantitative traits of aggressiveness could be detected within those clonal lineages by comparing isolates of identical <b>pathotype</b> and microsatellite profile. Pairs of isolates belonging to different <b>pathotypes</b> were compared for their latent period, lesion size and spore production capacity on adult plants under greenhouse conditions, with {{a high number of}} replicates. Isolates of the same <b>pathotype</b> showed remarkably similar values for the measured traits, except in three situations: differences were obtained within two <b>pathotypes</b> for latent period and within one <b>pathotype</b> for sporulation capacity. One of these differences was tested again and confirmed. This indicates that the average aggressiveness level of a leaf rust <b>pathotype</b> may increase without any change in its virulence factors or microsatellite profile...|$|R
40|$|Eight {{additional}} rice cultivars as differentials {{were selected}} to identify <b>pathotypes</b> occurring in the Tocantins State. They were BRS Jaburu, BRS Taim, BRS Biguá, BR IRGA- 417, Epagri 109, Javaé, Metica- 1 and Supremo. These differentials were used {{in addition to the}} international set to determine the pathogenic diversity of 193 Pyricularia oryzae isolates collected during 1994 - 2002 from irrigated rice cultivars. They were conserved in Pyricularia culture collection of Embrapa Rice and Bean Research center. From 193 P. oryzae isolates 38 <b>pathotypes</b> were identified based on leaf blast reactions of international set and 29 <b>pathotypes</b> based on these additional differentials. The predominant <b>pathotypes</b> (TI- 1, TG- 2, TD- 15 and TF- 2) were represented by 53 % of the tested isolates. The major international <b>pathotypes</b> (IB- 45, IB- 41, II- 1 and ID- 13) were represented by 43 % of the isolates tested. The virulence pattern of 28 isolates belonging to the <b>pathotype</b> IB- 45 was further differentiated into nine local <b>pathotypes</b> using additional set of differentials.

40|$|AbstractNewcastle Disease {{is one of}} {{the serious}} viral {{infection}} disease in poultry, especially chicken. The etiological agent of Newcastle Disease is Newcastle Disease Virus (NDV). The objective of this research was to develop a method for determining pathotype of NDV in various species of poultry from field specimens rapidly and efficiently by using RT-PCR and REA method. This study was conducted for identification, differentiation and <b>pathotyping</b> of NDV from local isolates by using amplification of RT-PCR followed by REA of F protein encoding gene of NDV. To differentiate virulent and avirulent NDV, the RT-PCR product of F gene in size of 767 basepairs (bp) was analyzed by Hin 1 l and Bam HI restriction enzymes. RT-PCR amplification for F gene NDV generated DNA fragments in size of 767 bp. RT-PCR and REA method by using Hin 1 l and Bam HI enzymes can be used to determine pathotype of NDV from field specimens, for total ten field specimen samples of NDV, three samples are avirulent NDV and seven samples are virulent NDV. RT-PCR and REA methods are appropriate with DNA sequencing method to determine the NDV...|$|E
40|$|Previous {{studies of}} European {{populations of the}} blast fungus (Magnaporthe oryzae) have shown the {{existence}} of five clonal lineages. Three of them were common to different countries, whereas one was specific to Hungary and another was specific to Spain. But these {{studies were carried out}} on a limited number of individuals and pointed out a need for more extensive studies in each European rice-growing area. In addition, temporal evolution of M. oryzae populations is also poorly documented. In this study, we focused on Guadalquivir delta region in southern Spain. A total of 186 M. oryzae isolates were collected from various farmer and experimental fields, on diverse cultivars, over the period 1999 - 2003, and characterized for their genotypic and pathotypic diversity. Five lineages were identified, one of which was detected {{for the first time in}} Europe (E 6). The E 6 lineage, which was collected over the period 2000 - 2003, became dominant in 2000. <b>Pathotyping</b> confirmed previous results of a narrow diversity for virulence spectrum in European lineages. Five dominant pathotypes were identified, each one corresponding to a single pathotype. Drastic changes in lineage relative frequencies were observed from one year to another. The origin of such changes is discussed. (Résumé d'auteur...|$|E
40|$|Genotypic {{diversity}} among 46 isolates of Sclerospora graminicola collected from seven states in India during 1992 – 2005 was determined through <b>pathotyping</b> and AFLP analysis. A {{high level of}} variation was observed among the isolates for downy mildew incidence, latent period and virulence index. Based on the reaction {{on a set of}} nine pearl millet lines, 46 isolates were classified in 21 pathotypes. Quantitative differences in virulence levels of the test isolates were assessed by calculating the virulence index (disease incidence × latent period − 1). A dendrogram generated by the average linkage cluster analysis of virulence index clustered the 46 isolates into eight groups. Region-specific grouping of five isolates from Gujarat and six from Rajasthan was observed within two distinct groups. Temporal variation was also observed among the isolates collected from the same location and same host over the years. A total of 297 bands were scored following selective amplification with three primer combinations E-TT/M-CAG, E-AT/M-CAG and E-TG/M-CAT and all of them were polymorphic. Cluster analysis of AFLP data clustered the test isolates into seven groups. Analysis of molecular variance indicated that variation in the S. graminicola populations was largely due to differences among the isolates within the state...|$|E

Salmonella enterica subsp. enterica-specific genes and Salmonella core genes were used as negative controls. The entire E. coli <b>pathotype</b> showed reactivity to only 4 of the 81 Salmonella-specific gene probes.
