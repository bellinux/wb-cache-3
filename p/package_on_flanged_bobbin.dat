"Railway" [...] means {{a system}} of {{transport}} employing parallel rails which provide support and guidance for vehicles carried <b>on</b> <b>flanged</b> wheels, and form a track which either is of a gauge of at least 350 millimetres or crosses a carriageway (whether or not on the same level).|$|R
5000|$|The first tram in Oslo {{was opened}} in 1875 {{with a short}} line between Homansbyen west of the city centre, Oslo West Railway Station and a {{sideline}} to Grønland, east of the city centre. The first [...] "trams" [...] were in fact horse-drawn vehicles <b>on</b> <b>flanged</b> steel wheels. The first expansion of the line came in 1878 with a line to Grünerløkka just north-east to the city center.|$|R
50|$|Markers {{are placed}} <b>on</b> <b>flanged</b> posts at {{approximate}} one-tenth mile intervals with a tolerance of ±0.01 mile. On two-lane roads, {{they are usually}} placed in alternate directions of travel. On four-lane roads, they are placed in both directions. If an intersection, impermeable material, or other obstruction exists, a marker may be placed nearby but {{in violation of the}} above tolerance, {{on the opposite side of}} the road on which it would otherwise be placed, or missing altogether. A missing marker is yet accounted for in the overall sequence.|$|R
5000|$|Three more railcars were {{constructed}} at Petone in 1925 and 1926. [...] The 1925 model {{did not survive}} tests on the Hutt lines, and given its ungainly design, this is hardly surprising. It caused its passengers to experience an uncomfortable pitching motion, necessitating its withdrawal. [...] The 1926 models were more like small motor busses <b>on</b> <b>flanged</b> wheels with an 11 ft long body. They first saw service on the Greytown Branch before being transferred to the Glenham Branch and Switzers Branch where they were withdrawn in 1930.|$|R

2500|$|In 1936, {{the company}} was sold to Detroit's Evans Products Company, an {{innovative}} railway and automotive industry supplier that had developed {{the first version of}} the present hy-rail system called auto-railers, small buses that can run <b>on</b> rails <b>on</b> <b>flanged</b> wheels or <b>on</b> roads with rubber. [...] In 1937, Evans replaced the trolleys with auto-railers. [...] On rail, they went to Rosslyn where they were intended to switch to tires and cross the Key Bridge into Georgetown, eliminating the change in Rosslyn, but Capital Transit prevented that service by objecting that its franchise gave it exclusive service across the bridge. [...] The auto-railers last ran in September 1939.|$|R

50|$|The Key Valley Railway {{was more}} than a logging railway as it carried mostly lumber from the mill, out to Pakesley, much of that was stored there to dry, before shipping. There was said to be almost seven miles (11 km) of siding in the lumber yard. They hauled camp {{supplies}} in from the CPR by the carload. The railway also served Cole's mill, about a mile out of Lost Channel and carried lumber produced at George Bruce's mill and others, brought to the Channel from up the lake. About 8 locomotives were used on the railway at different times and there was a truck mounted <b>on</b> <b>flanged</b> wheels, outfitted with bench seats to transport the workmen.|$|R

50|$|Modern stockThe initial {{basis of}} freight stock has been {{supplemented}} {{in recent years}} by a series of flatbed runners (both four-wheelers and longer bogie stock), a large second hand four-wheeled brake van and a tipper wagon, the latter not being used in regular operation. As part of the Steam 125 railway celebrations that took place in 1998 the railway played host to its most unusual visitor, a hand made rail bike from Dr Karl Pischl in Austria. This unusual home-made vehicle was effectively a four-wheeled bicycle <b>on</b> <b>flanged</b> wheels. To replace a variety of four-wheel wagons that were time-expired, a new bogie works van was delivered to the line in 2011 for use by permanent way crews. This features an open wagon and covered accommodation area.|$|R
