5|$|Relationships between B.cuneata and {{the other}} members of B.subg. Isostylis still remain unclear. Though Mast's studies found B.cuneata to be the most basal of the three species, a 2004 study of genetic {{divergence}} within the subgenus yielded both other possibilities: some analyses suggested B.ilicifolia as basal, while others suggested B.oligantha. Further complicating the situation is the southernmost population of B.cuneata, which has both genetic and <b>phenetic</b> affinities with B.oligantha located to the southeast. The origin of this population is unknown. It might have arisen through hybridisation, or it may be a transitional or even ancestral form. Finally, biogeographical factors suggest that B.ilicifolia would be the most basal of the three species: it occurs in the High Rainfall Zone where relictual species are most common, whereas the others are restricted to the Transitional Rainfall Zone, where more recently evolved species are most common.|$|E

25|$|As {{with most}} Carcharhinus species, the {{evolutionary}} relationships of the graceful shark are poorly resolved. Based on morphology, Jack Garrick concluded in 1982 that its closest relative was the blacktip shark (C. limbatus), {{and that the}} two were {{closely related to the}} spinner shark (C. brevipinna). Leonard Compagno, in his 1988 <b>phenetic</b> study, also grouped those species together, along with the smoothtooth blacktip shark (C. leiodon) and the finetooth shark (C. isodon). However, molecular phylogenetic techniques have since found this interpretation to be invalid for the spinner, blacktip, and finetooth sharks.|$|E

500|$|A <b>phenetic</b> {{analysis}} of the genus undertaken by Ernest Charles Nelson in 1975 yielded results in which the members of A.sect. Eurylaema occurred together, with A.obovata appearing most closely related to A.barbigera (now A.barbiger), and then A.detmoldii. A.obovata was therefore retained in A.sect. Eurylaema in Ernest Charles Nelson's 1978 revision of Adenanthos, and again in his 1995 treatment of the genus for the Flora of Australia series. By this time, the ICBN had issued a ruling that all genera ending in -anthos must be treated as having masculine gender. Hence the species {{is now known as}} Adenanthos obovatus. Its placement in Nelson's arrangement of Adenanthos may be summarised as follows: ...|$|E
500|$|In 1982, Jack Garrick {{published}} a phylogenetic analysis of Carcharhinus based on morphology, {{in which he}} placed the dusky shark and the Galapagos shark (C. galapagensis) {{at the center of}} the [...] "obscurus group". The group consisted of large, triangular-toothed sharks with a ridge between the dorsal fins, and also included the bignose shark (C. altimus), the Caribbean reef shark (C. perezi), the sandbar shark (C. plumbeus), and the oceanic whitetip shark. This interpretation was largely upheld by Leonard Compagno in his 1988 <b>phenetic</b> study, and by Gavin Naylor in his 1992 allozyme sequence study. Naylor was able to further resolve the interrelationships of the [...] "ridge-backed" [...] branch of Carcharhinus, finding that the dusky shark, Galapagos shark, oceanic whitetip shark, and blue shark (Prionace glauca) comprise its most derived clade.|$|E
500|$|A <b>phenetic</b> {{analysis}} of the genus undertaken by Nelson in 1975 yielded results in which [...] A.cuneatus was grouped with A.stictus. This pairing was then neighbour to a larger group that included A.forrestii, A.eyrei, A.cacomorphus, A.ileticos, and several hybrid and unusual forms of A.cuneatus. [...] Nelson's analysis supported Bentham's sections, {{and so they were}} retained when Nelson published a taxonomic revision of the genus in 1978. He further subdivided A.sect. Adenanthos into two subsections, with A.cuneata placed into A.subsect. Adenanthos for reasons including the length of its perianth, but Nelson discarded his own subsections in his 1995 treatment of Adenanthos, for the Flora of Australia series of monographs. By this time, the ICBN had issued a ruling that all genera ending in -anthos must be treated as having masculine gender; thus the specific epithet became cuneatus.|$|E
2500|$|The DNA barcoding debate {{resembles the}} phenetics debate of decades gone by. It {{remains to be}} seen whether what is now touted as a {{revolution}} in taxonomy will eventually go the same way as <b>phenetic</b> approaches, of which was claimed exactly the same decades ago, but which were all but rejected when they failed to live up to overblown expectations. Controversy surrounding DNA barcoding stems not so much from the method itself, but rather from extravagant claims that it will supersede or radically transform traditional taxonomy. Other critics fear a [...] "big science" [...] initiative like barcoding will make funding even more scarce for already underfunded disciplines like taxonomy, but barcoders respond that they compete for funding not with fields like taxonomy, but instead with other big science fields, such as medicine and genomics. Barcoders also maintain that they are being dragged into long-standing debates over the definition of a species and that barcoding is less controversial when viewed primarily as a method of identification, not classification.|$|E
50|$|<b>Phenetic</b> {{analyses}} are unrooted, that is, {{they do not}} distinguish between plesiomorphies, traits that are inherited from an ancestor, and apomorphies, traits that evolved anew in one or several lineages. A common problem with <b>phenetic</b> analysis is that basal evolutionary grades, which retain many plesiomorphies compared to more advanced lineages, appear to be monophyletic. <b>Phenetic</b> {{analyses are}} also liable to be misled by convergent evolution and adaptive radiation. Cladistic methods have attempted to solve those problems.|$|E

50|$|A <b>phenetic</b> {{species is}} a set of organisms which have a similar {{phenotype}} to each other, but a different phenotype from other sets of organisms.|$|E
50|$|In taxonomy, a phylotype is an {{observed}} similarity used {{to classify}} {{a group of}} organisms by their <b>phenetic</b> relationship. This <b>phenetic</b> similarity, {{particularly in the case}} of asexual organisms, may reflect the evolutionary relationships. The term is rank-neutral, so that phylotypes can be described at different levels, such as species, class, 97% genetic similarity or homology. The term is often used in microbiology, since the genomes of prokaryotes, which freely exchange genetic material, do not lend themselves to classification via Linnean taxonomy as easily as do many eukaryotes such as plant and animals.|$|E

50|$|Informally, phyla can {{be thought}} of as groupings of organisms based on general {{specialization}} of body plan. At its most basic, a phylum can be defined in two ways: as a group of organisms with a certain degree of morphological or developmental similarity (the <b>phenetic</b> definition), or a group of organisms with a certain degree of evolutionary relatedness (the phylogenetic definition). Attempting to define a level of the Linnean hierarchy without referring to (evolutionary) relatedness is unsatisfactory, but a <b>phenetic</b> definition is useful when addressing questions of a morphological nature—such as how successful different body plans were.|$|E

50|$|Phenetics {{has largely}} been {{superseded}} by cladistics for research into evolutionary relationships among species.

5000|$|The Anseriformes (waterfowl) and the Galliformes {{together}} {{make up the}} Galloanserae. They are basal {{among the}} living neognathous birds, and normally follow the Paleognathae (ratites and tinamous) in modern bird classification systems. This was first proposed in the Sibley-Ahlquist taxonomy and has been the one major change of that proposed scheme that was almost universally adopted. However, the Galliformes as they were traditionally delimited are called Gallomorphae in the Sibley-Ahlquist taxonomy, which splits the Cracidae and Megapodiidae as an order [...] "Craciformes". This is not a natural group, however, but rather an erroneous result of the now-obsolete <b>phenetic</b> methodology employed in the Sibley-Ahlquist taxonomy. <b>Phenetic</b> studies do not distinguish between plesiomorphic and apomorphic characters, which leads to basal lineages appearing as monophyletic groups.|$|E
50|$|A {{specimen}} {{was first}} collected in 1973 and {{considered to be}} part of a disjunct population of Arctostaphylos peninsularis, or alternately a hybrid between Arctostaphylos glauca and Arctostaphylos glandulosa.

50|$|In the past, the {{taxonomy}} of gastropods was {{largely based on}} <b>phenetic</b> morphological characters of the taxa.

50|$|An {{ecological}} {{species is}} a set of organisms adapted to a particular set of resources, called a niche, in the environment.

50|$|The two methodologies are not {{mutually}} exclusive. There is no reason why, e.g., species identified using phenetics cannot subsequently be subjected to cladistic analysis, to determine their evolutionary relationships. <b>Phenetic</b> methods can also be superior to cladistics when only the distinctness of related taxa is important, as the computational requirements are lower.|$|E

50|$|Zimmermann {{favored the}} {{reconstruction}} of phylogenetic lineages across species based on evolution of single phenotypic characters. He acknowledged that it is often impossible to know exactly the genealogical relationships between groups of organisms without experimentation, and basing phylogenetic relationships solely on <b>phenetic</b> similarities only {{increases the risk of}} influence of convergent evolution, parallel evolution, and atavism on analysis of evolutionary relationships.|$|E
50|$|Modern {{applications}} of phenetics {{are common in}} botany, and some examples {{can be found in}} most issues of the journal Systematic Botany. Indeed, due to the effects of horizontal gene transfer, polyploid complexes and other peculiarities of plant genomics, <b>phenetic</b> techniques in botany - though less informative altogether - may, in these special cases, be less prone to errors compared with cladistic analysis of DNA sequences.|$|E
50|$|<b>Phenetic</b> {{techniques}} include {{various forms}} of clustering and ordination. These are sophisticated ways of reducing the variation displayed by organisms to a manageable level. In practice this means measuring dozens of variables, and then presenting them as two- or three-dimensional graphs.

50|$|The {{taxonomy}} of the culpeo {{has been the}} topic of debate due to their high <b>phenetic</b> variability and the scarcity of research, among other things.

The addition of molecular data has allowed researchers to resolve clades in many lineages.|$|E
5000|$|Defining species {{groups is}} a {{convenient}} way of subdividing well-defined genera {{with a large}} number of recognized species.
