5|$|On 1 January, 98, at {{the start}} of his fourth consulship, Nerva {{suffered}} a stroke during a <b>private</b> <b>audience.</b> Shortly thereafter he was struck by a fever and died at his villa in the Gardens of Sallust, on 28 January. He was deified by the Senate, and his ashes were laid to rest in the Mausoleum of Augustus.|$|E
5|$|Buchanan {{resented the}} fact that Breckinridge had {{supported}} both Pierce and Douglas before endorsing his nomination. Relations between the two were further strained when, upon asking for a private interview with Buchanan, Breckinridge was told {{to come to the}} White House and ask for Harriet Lane, who acted as the mansion's host for the unmarried president. Feeling slighted by the response, Breckinridge refused to carry out these instructions; later, three of Buchanan's intimates informed Breckinridge that requesting to speak to Miss Lane was actually a secret instruction to White House staff to usher the requestor into a <b>private</b> <b>audience</b> with the president. They also conveyed Buchanan's apologies for the misunderstanding.|$|E
5|$|Mahendra Pratap {{was head}} of the Indian princely states of Mursan and Hathras. He had been {{involved}} with the Indian National Congress in the 1900s, attending the Congress session of 1906. He toured the world in 1907 and 1911, and in 1912 contributed substantial funds to Gandhi's South African movement. Pratap left India for Geneva {{at the beginning of the}} war, where he was met by Virendranath Chattopadhyaya of the Berlin Committee. Chattopadhyaya's efforts—along with a letter from the Kaiser—convinced Pratap to lend his support to the Indian nationalist cause, on the condition that the arrangements were made with the Kaiser himself. A <b>private</b> <b>audience</b> with the Kaiser was arranged, at which Pratap agreed to nominally head the expedition.|$|E

5|$|The kvitel {{is either}} {{sent to the}} Rebbe by {{messenger}} or mail, or given personally by the Hasid during his <b>private</b> <b>audience</b> with the Rebbe. The kvitel is usually given together with a sum of money known as a pidyon (redemption), which {{is used by the}} Rebbe for the upkeep of his court or for distribution to charity. Some Rebbes requested from the Hasid a sum of money equal to twice the numerical value of the Hebrew word Chai (life), which equals 18. Others took an amount of money equal to the numerical value of the letters of the Hebrew names of the Hasid or his wife.|$|E
5|$|Brandon {{invites the}} Dashwoods and the Middletons {{to a party}} on his estate at Delaford, but before the trip can take place, he is called away on urgent business. Willoughby {{requests}} a <b>private</b> <b>audience</b> with both Mrs. Dashwood and Marianne, leading them both to expect that he will propose. However, Willoughby reveals that his aunt is sending him on business to London, and {{he may not be}} able to return to Devonshire for at least a year. Shortly after Willoughby's departure, Edward comes to visit, and the Dashwoods notice that he appears to be unhappy and distant. Mrs. Jennings' nieces, Lucy (Anna Madeley) and Anne Steele (Daisy Haggard), come to Barton Park. When Lucy learns that the Dashwoods are acquainted with the Ferrars, Lucy confides in Elinor that she and Edward have been secretly engaged for four years, news that devastates Elinor. Mrs. Jennings invites Elinor and Marianne to spend some time with her in London, and Marianne hopes she will see Willoughby. However, he does not visit or reply to her letters.|$|E
5|$|Dances can be {{performed}} solo (1, 4); in pairs, (2, 3); in groups, (5, 6, 7); or by massed performers (10). They might be improvised (4, 8) or highly choreographed (1, 2, 5, 10); spontaneous for personal entertainment, (such as when children begin dancing for themselves); a <b>private</b> <b>audience,</b> (4); a paying audience (2); a world audience (10); or an audience interested in a particular dance genre (3, 5). They might {{be a part of}} a celebration, such as a wedding or New Year (6, 8); or a cultural ritual with a specific purpose, such as a dance by warriors like a haka (7). Some dances, such as traditional dance in 1 and ballet in 2, need a very high level of skill and training; others, such as the can-can, require a very high level of energy and physical fitness. Entertaining the audience is a normal part of dance but its physicality often also produces joy for the dancers themselves (9).|$|E

5|$|Estimates of {{the number}} of Serbs killed on 11–13 May vary. Historians Jozo Tomasevich and Ivo Goldstein put the number at 260. Historians Sabrina P. Ramet and Marko Attila Hoare {{estimate}} that about 300 Serbs were massacred while historian Davide Rodogno puts the number at 417 killed. On 14 May, the Archbishop of Zagreb, Aloysius Stepinac, sent a letter of protest to Pavelić after receiving news of the killings. He failed to condemn the atrocity publicly. The next day, Pavelić visited Rome and was granted a <b>private</b> <b>audience</b> with Pope Pius XII, who offered de facto recognition of the NDH on behalf of the Holy See. Although he was aware that Pavelić was a totalitarian dictator, {{there is no evidence that}} he had knowledge of the first Glina massacre at the time.|$|E
5|$|King Kalākaua trusted Rosenberg's {{skill as}} a fortune teller, {{perhaps because the}} way Rosenberg chanted in Hebrew {{reminded}} him of ancient Hawaiian rites. In January 1887, the king—who had become increasingly autocratic and was facing several scandals—granted Rosenberg a <b>private</b> <b>audience</b> at the palace. The king and Rosenberg became close, and routinely visited each other for several {{days at a time}} and held long conversations. During the audiences, Rosenberg told Bible stories and read from the Talmud. He began to teach the king basic Hebrew, and gave him an ornate Torah and yad that he had brought with him to Hawaii. He also claimed to have found references to Hawaii in ancient Hebrew texts, a statement that encouraged the king to restore aspects of Hawaiian religion. The king had previously sought instruction from several people he regarded as prophets and had established a society dedicated to the revival of native Hawaiian traditions. Finally, the king declared Rosenberg his kahuna-kilokilo, a royal soothsayer.|$|E
5|$|Ganga Singh was {{the best-known}} king among the Rajasthan princes. A {{favourite}} of the British Raj, he earned {{the title of}} Knight Commander of the Star of India. He served {{as a member of}} the Imperial War Cabinet, represented the country at the Imperial First World War Conferences and the British Empire at the Versailles Peace Conference and was aware of the shift of fortunes in the World War II but died in 1943, before the war was won by the allies. His contribution to the building activity in Junagarh involved separate halls for public and <b>private</b> <b>audience</b> in the Ganga Mahal and a durbar hall for formal functions. The hall where he held his Golden Jubilee as a ruler of Bikaner is now a museum. He also got a new palace - north of Junagarh fort - designed and built by Swinton, the third of the new palaces built in Bikaner and named it Lalgarh Palace in the name of his father and shifted his residence from Junagarh fort to this palace in 1902. The royal family still lives in a special suite in the Lalgarh palace, which they have converted into a heritage hotel.|$|E

50|$|Lamare {{returned}} to France in 1809, traveling through Poland and Austria.

He married into wealth in 1815, after which he mostly retired from performance, dying in Caen in 1823.|$|R
5|$|Several minor {{alterations}} {{were made}} to the Upper Ward under Victoria. Anthony Salvin rebuilt Wyatville's grand staircase, with Edward Blore constructing a new private chapel within the State Apartments. Salvin also rebuilt the State Dining Room following a serious fire in 1853. Ludwig Gruner assisted {{in the design of the}} Queen's <b>Private</b> <b>Audience</b> Chamber in the south range. Blore and Salvin also did extensive work in the Lower Ward, under the direction of Prince Albert, including the Hundred Steps leading down into Windsor town, rebuilding the Garter, Curfew and Salisbury towers, the houses of the Military Knights and creating a new Guardhouse. George Gilbert Scott rebuilt the Horseshoe Cloister in the 1870s. The Norman Gatehouse was turned into a private dwelling for Sir Henry Ponsonby. Windsor Castle did not benefit from many of the minor improvements of the era, however, as Victoria disliked gaslight, preferring candles; electric lighting was only installed in limited parts of the castle at the end of her reign. Indeed, the castle was famously cold and draughty in Victoria's reign, but it was connected to a nearby reservoir, with water reliably piped into the interior for the first time.|$|E
