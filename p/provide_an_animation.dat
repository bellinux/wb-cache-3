40|$|The coordinated {{activities}} of growth factor signaling pathways orchestrate in the gastrulating mouse embryo both {{the formation of}} the embryonic axes and the primary germ layers. Complex intracellular, but also extracellular modulation of the signaling cascades as well as synexpressions and (auto) regulatory feedback loops regulate the dynamic and concentration-dependent roles of morphogens during tissue patterning. A particular subset of morphogens that plays pivotal roles in these processes are Nodal and Bone morphogenetic proteins (Bmp), which are subgroups of ligand that belong to the Transforming Growth Factor (Tgf) type beta family. The loss-of-function of these morphogens or their downstream effectors (e. g. the Smad proteins) often leads to severe axes/gastrulation defects, which on their turn result in early embryonic lethality. Loss-of-function of one of the BMP receptor-activated Smads, Smad 5, results in the mouse in embryonic lethality around mid-gestation due to several embryonic and extraembryonic defects, attributed to reduced Bmp-Smad signaling. Furthermore, the Smad 5 -deficient amnion develops specific defects that cannot be attributed to reduced Bmp signaling whatsoever: (i) while wild type amnion is a squamous and avascular bilayered membrane that surrounds and protects the embryo, the Smad 5 mutant amnion remains cuboidal; in addition, the anterior delineation between the neural, surface and amnion ectoderm is lost; (ii) at early somite stages, the Smad 5 mutant amnion thickens anteriorly and displays ectopic haematopoiesis and vasculogenesis; furthermore, it develops de novo ectopic OCT- 4 and alkaline phosphatase positive primordial germ cell-like cells. Interestingly, these different cell types normally become specified in a region of the primitive streak, located at the posterior side of the embryo, where Bmp signaling prevails. Increased or ectopic Bmp and Bmp target gene expression in the mutant amnion suggested that lack of Smad 5 in the amnion results indeed in increased Bmp signaling. The main goal of this thesis was to determine the molecular mechanism(s) that lead to {{the formation of the}} ectopic clump of cells, including the above mentioned ectopic haematopoiesis and vasculogenesis, in the Smad 5 mutant amnion. In order to investigate this amnion defect of the Smad 5 mutant, the additional understanding of the normal development of the amnion was instrumental. Despite the depth of knowledge obtained over the last decade on the molecular regulation of gastrulation, the process of amnion development has been described and illustrated in rodents only poorly. The somewhat authoritative description involves the fusion of two amniotic folds, i. e. a big posterior and a smaller anterior fold. While revisiting the highly dynamic process of amnion formation in the mouse (amongst others by performing detailed histomorphological analyses of dissected, staged embryos), we demonstrated the existence of a single fold, which protrudes from the posterior side of the embryo. We propose an adjusted model for the process of amnion formation, which we refer to as the single amniochorionic fold model, and confirmed this model using 3 D reconstructions of historical sections. In addition, we <b>provide</b> <b>an</b> <b>animation</b> that visualizes the complex process of amnion formation. The fact that progenitors, which normally are formed in the primitive streak (i. e. at the posterior side of the mouse embryo), develop ectopically in the Smad 5 -deficient amnion prompted us to test the hypothesis whether ectopic primitive streak is induced in this mutant amnion. We first showed that early mesodermal markers are expressed in the amnion thickening. This suggested that indeed an ectopic primitive streak-like structure is induced in this extraembryonic tissue. Next, we investigated if any of the key mesoderm-inducing signals were ectopically expressed in the Smad 5 mutant amnion. We could demonstrate ectopic Nodal expression prior to any sign of amnion thickening. Furthermore, we showed that the two positive feedback loops that regulate Nodal expression, which is normally required for primitive streak induction, are also active in the Smad 5 mutant amnion. Hence, the signaling cascades that induce the primitive streak in posterior epiblast at E 6. 0 are recapitulated in the Smad 5 mutant amnion. Further investigations told us that the expression of the Nodal antagonists secreted from the anterior visceral endoderm (AVE), and of Lefty 2, is unchanged in the Smad 5 mutant, suggesting an alternative mechanism of regulation of Nodal signaling/expression in amnion. Subsequent biochemical analyses in cultured cells demonstrated that Bmp 4 -induced Smad 5 -Smad 2 heteromerization, which is an unconventional combination of receptor-regulated Smad proteins, antagonizes Nodal signaling by interfering with the Nodal-Smad 2 / 4 -FoxH 1 pathway. Taken together, our findings in Smad 5 -deficient mouse embryos indicate that antagonism of Nodal signaling by Smad 5 -mediated signaling, and thus Bmp activity, is a mechanism that prevents formation of ectopic primitive streak in the amnion of normal mouse embryos. The formation of mixed R-Smad complexes is likely {{to play a role in}} Bmp/Smad 5 -mediated antagonism of Nodal signaling in the amnion. Ectopic Nodal signaling in this extraembryonic tissue of Smad 5 -deficient mouse embryos induces two Nodal-supported positive feedback loops, leading ultimately to ectopic primitive streak formation. From this work, we also concluded that amnion is a plastic tissue and that Bmp signaling, via Smad 5, is a major regulator of amnion fate in the mouse embryo. nrpages: 126 status: publishe...|$|E
