After {{a review of the}} typical lateral modes of traditional aircraft configurations it is shown that with modern low-aspect-ratio designs at higher incidences the lateral oscillation tends to degenerate into a simple roiling oscillation about the <b>principal</b> <b>inertia</b> <b>axis,</b> whereas the roll subsidence is increasingly dominated by yawing moments.

This engineering geometric approach produces identical results when compared to methods of conventional minimization using partial derivatives with respect to linear equation coefficients. Extending the approach to the fitting of conics and quadrics achieves great computational advantage over conventional least-squares optimization of Euclidean, as opposed to algebraic distance. The results, though imperfect, provide {{a starting point for}} iterations that will converge rapidly.

40|$|Euler (1765) has deduced {{that any}} nonspherical rigid body which is {{rotating}} about some axis {{that is not}} its <b>principal</b> moment of <b>inertia</b> <b>axis</b> will experience a wobble as it rotates. The earth's wobble predicted by Euler was actually detected by Chandler (1891). The present paper is concerned with this wobble which {{is now known as}} the Chandler wobble. The Chandler wobble has now been under observation for more than 80 years. During part of this time, the amplitude of the wobble has actually been seen to grow. It follows that there must be some mechanisms operating to maintain (or excite) the Chandler wobble preventing it from decaying. Possible excitation mechanisms considered include earthquakes and meteorological variations.

40|$|The pararotor is a {{decelerator}} device {{based on the}} autorotation of a rotating wing. When it is dropped, it generates an aerodynamic force parallel to the main motion direction, acting as a decelerating force. In this paper, the rotational motion equations are shown for the vertical flight without any lateral wind component and some simplifying assumptions are introduced to obtain analytic solutions of the motion. First, the equilibrium state is obtained {{as a function of}} the main parameters. Then the equilibrium stability is analyzed. The motion stability depends on two nondimensional parameters, which contain geometric, inertia, and aerodynamic characteristics of the device. Based on these two parameters a stability diagram can be defined. Some stability regions with different types of stability trajectories (nodes, spirals, focuses) can be identified for spinning motion around axes close to the major, minor, and intermediate principal axes. It is found that the blades contribute to stability in a case of spin around the intermediate <b>principal</b> <b>inertia</b> <b>axis,</b> which is otherwise unstable. Subsequently, the equations for determining the angles of nutation and spin of the body are obtained, thus defining the orientation of the body for a stationary motion and the parameters on which that position depends...|$|E
40|$|Accretion {{of matter}} {{onto the surface}} of a freely precessing NS with a complex non-dipole {{magnetic}} field can explain the change of X-ray pulse profiles of Her X- 1 observed by RXTE with the phase of the 35 -day cycle. We demonstrate this using all available measurements of X-ray pulse profiles in the 9 - 13 keV energy range obtained with the RXTE/PCA. The measured profiles guided the elaboration of a geometrical model and the definition of locations of emitting poles, arcs, and spots on the NS surface which satisfactorily reproduce the observed pulse profiles and their dependence on free precession phase. We have found that the observed trend of the times of the 35 -day turn-ons on the O-C diagram, which can be approximated by a collection of consecutive linear segments around the mean value, can be described by our model by assuming a variable free precession period, with a fractional period change of about a few percent. We propose that the 2. 5 % changes in the free precession period that occur on time scales of several to tens of 35 -day cycles can be related to wandering of the <b>principal</b> <b>inertia</b> <b>axis</b> of the NS body due to variations in the patterns of accretion onto the NS surface. The closeness of periods of the disk precession and the NS free precession {{can be explained by the}} presence of a synchronization mechanism in the system, which modulates the dynamical interaction of the gas streams and the accretion disk with the NS free precession period.

40|$|Solvation {{dynamics}} in liquid water is addressed via nonequilibrium energy-transfer pathways activated after a neutral atomic solute acquires a unit charge, either positive or negative. It is {{shown that the}} well-known nonequilibrium frequency shift relaxation function can be expressed in a novel fashion in terms of energy fluxes, providing a clear-cut and quantitative account of the processes involved. Roughly half of the initial excess energy is transferred into hindered rotations of first hydration shell water molecules, i. e., librational motions, specifically those rotations around the lowest moment of <b>inertia</b> <b>principal</b> <b>axis.</b> After integration over all water solvent molecules, rotations account for roughly 80 % of the energy transferred, while translations have a secondary role; transfer to intramolecular water stretch and bend vibrations is negligible. This picture {{is similar to that}} for relaxation of a single vibrationally or rotationally excited water molecule in neat liquid water, although solvation relaxation is more nonlocal. In addition, we find a remarkable independence of the main relaxation channels on the newly created charge’s sign. Although the methodology is applied here to the simplest solute case, the approach is rather general, and it should be at least equally useful in more realistic and complex scenarios.

In this paper, we explore this connection within an information theoretic framework.

In particular, the <b>principal</b> <b>inertia</b> components bear an interpretation as filter coefficients in the linear transformation of p[subscript f(X) |X] into p[subscript f(X) |Y].

40|$|One of {{the most}} {{remarkable}} rotational features of Venus is the presence of a relatively large offset between spin and maximum <b>inertia</b> <b>axis.</b> According to the most recent gravity field models, this offset may amount to ∼ 0. 5 °, considerably larger than the one which characterizes the Earth's Chandler wobble (∼ 0. 3 ″). At present, {{it is not clear whether}} the offset of Venus is the result of the limited resolution of the gravity models or, alternatively, it may be regarded as an evidence in support to the existence of a wobble. Purpose of this note is to demonstrate on quantitative grounds that an offset between spin <b>axis</b> and maximum <b>inertia</b> <b>axis</b> is to be expected on the time‐scales of mantle convection, due to the peculiar rotational characteristics of Venus. We also show that the inertia perturbation associated to the rising of hot thermal plumes from the core‐mantle boundary to the surface is large enough to maintain offsets ranging between 0. 1 and 1 °. Of course, this does not preclude that other processes, such as Venusquakes or periodic atmospheric variabilities, may contribute significantly to the observed offset on shorter time‐scales...|$|R

It is noted that the amplitudes of other coefficients are similar to the predicted coefficients using Kaula's rule under equal stress assumption. Atmospheric density values as a function of altitude are obtained to help model drag perturbation. A radial acceleration map at 100 km above the Venus surface is generated, and correlation between gravity anomalies and major topographic features is observed. Spectral analysis of the harmonic model suggests that the interior density anomalies are like those on earth.

Details {{of the conference}} are {{available}} at: [URL] paper considers PD attitude control of magnetically actuated satellites where one <b>axis</b> of <b>inertia</b> is considerably {{lower than that of}} the other two. The classic ‘torque-projection’ method of implementing the control is unsuitable for this configuration as the nature of the torque projection controller places little significance on the low <b>inertia</b> <b>axis.</b> This paper proposes a modification to the PD approach by determining the dipole moments through minimisation of a performance index rather than projection onto the magnetic field orthogonal. This allows fairer consideration of the low <b>inertia</b> <b>axis</b> and leads to improved performance of the feedback control. This approach is taken further by introducing an element of feed-forward control to improve the disturbance rejection properties of the system. In a similar way the required feed-forward compensation is determined through minimisation of an appropriate performance index. Combination of the feed-forward and feedback control successfully regulates the satellite attitude when assessed using a high fidelity simulation model.

A motion capture system was used to evaluate the contribution of the potential axes of rotation (minimum <b>inertia</b> <b>axis,</b> shoulder-centre of mass axis and the shoulder-elbow axis) during the four discrete tennis serve phases (loading, cocking, acceleration and follow through). Ten ranked athletes (International Tennis Number 1 - 3) repeatedly performed a flat service aiming at a target on the other side of the net. The four serve phases are distinct and thus, each movement phase seems to be organised around specific rotation axes.

40|$|The {{dissertation}} presents dynamic {{modeling and}} analysis of single rigid bodies, gyroscopic multi-body systems, and flexible robotics {{through the use of}} the moving frame method. Before analyzing the projects at hand, a brief introduction to the moving frame method will be presented. To properly model the gyroscopic systems and flexible robots, it is first necessary to establish the kinematical description of freely rotating bodies. To demonstrate the validity and efficacy of the method, it is applied to solve the mystery of the Dzhanibekov and tennis racket phenomena. It is known that a rotation about the intermediate <b>principal</b> moment of <b>inertia</b> <b>axis</b> becomes unstable, leading many to incorrectly conclude a violation of the conservation of angular momentum. Using the moving frame method, the torque-free Euler equations are clearly obtained and a complete explanation, including a geometric, analytic, and numerical solution is presented along with 3 D animations to demonstrate that the conservation of angular momentum is truly preserved. As an application of the moving frame method to rigid-multibody systems, analysis of two offshore gyroscopic structures will be performed. First, a gyroscopic ocean wave energy converter (GOWEC) is analyzed. The GOWEC is a fully enclosed ocean wave energy device that converts the rocking or pitching motion induced by the ocean waves into electricity. In this dissertation, the mathematical model of the energy converter is derived and the ideal conditions for maximum power output are identified. Second, as a natural extension of the GOWEC, the application of gyroscopes as a means of stabilization is examined. The active gyroscopic ship stabilizer uses the gyroscopic principles to cancel the rolling motion induced by the ocean waves. Of specific interest is the application of active gyroscopic roll stabilizers in ships to further aid in the safe transport of passengers and transfer of equipment onto platforms and offshore wind farm structures. The main parameters of the gyroscopic stabilizer are characterized and their effect on the ship is analyzed. Lastly, modeling {{and analysis of}} flexible robots with internal actuation is presented. Two mechanical models for flexible or soft robots are derived: (i) a discrete multi-link model consisting of rigid links with elastic torsional springs at actuating joints. and (ii) a continuous beam model with distributed internal actuation. As an application of the continuous beam model, an inchworm with multiple actuation curvature fields is presented. With the flexible mechanical models, it is possible to know the internal actuation necessary for soft robots to reproduce desired shapes and resulting maneuvers. Furthermore, the nonlinear finite element equations along with active C^((1)) -beam elements are developed and used to create a finite element cod...|$|R

40|$|International audienceThe velocity-dependent {{change in}} {{rotational}} axes observed during {{the control of}} unconstrained 3 D arm rotations may obey the principle of minimum inertia resistance (MIR). Rotating the arm around the minimum <b>inertia</b> tensor <b>axis</b> (e 3) reduces the contribution of muscle torque to net torque by employing interaction torque. The present experiment tested whether the MIR principle still governs rotational movements when subjects were instructed to maintain the humeral long axis (SH-EL) {{as closely as possible}} to horizontal. With this view, the variability of 3 D trajectories of the minimum <b>inertia</b> <b>axis</b> (e 3), shoulder-center of mass axis (SH-CM) and shoulder-elbow axis (SH-EL) was quantified using a VICON V 8 i motion capture system. The axis for which the 3 D variability displacement is minimal is considered as the one constraining the control of arm rotation. Subjects (n= 15) rotated their arm in two elbow angular configurations (Elb 90 ° vs. Elb 140 °), two angular velocity conditions (slow S vs. fast F), and two sensory conditions (kinaesthetic K vs. visuo-kinaesthetic VK). The minimum <b>inertia</b> <b>axis</b> e 3 is angled 5. 4 ° away from SH-CM axis, and varied from 27 ° to 15 ° away from de SH-EL axis, for Elb 90 ° and Elb 140 °, respectively. We tested whether the participants would be able to maintain the instructed SH-EL rotation axis or if increasing the frequency of the arm rotations would override the initial rotation instructions and cause the limb to rotate around an axis closely aligned with e 3. We expected that VK inputs would minimize the variability of the SH-EL axis and that K should facilitate the detection and rotation around e 3 at the faster velocity. Taken together the results showed that the initial instruction, favoring rotation around the SH-EL axis, prevented the velocity-dependent change towards the minimum inertia (e 3) and/or the mass axis (SH-CM), i. e., use of the MIR principle. However, the variability of the SH-EL axis was significantly increased in the F condition, confirming that arm rotations around the SH-EL axis produces larger mechanical instabilities in comparison to when the arm is rotated around a mass/inertial axis (Isableu et al., 2009) ...|$|R

A triangular network covering {{the surface of the}} Earth was thus constructed based on the spherical Delaunay approach, and average-weighted vertical variations in the Earth surface were estimated. Calculations show that the Earth is expanding at present at a rate of 0. 24 ± 0. 04 mm/yr.
