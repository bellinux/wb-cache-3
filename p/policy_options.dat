Obama warned him to tell no one about the nascent operation, even his own wife, so Lu quietly rented a small office in D.C. and secretly met with people who had worked on previous Democratic presidential transition efforts. The planning efforts produced <b>policy</b> <b>options</b> {{on a wide range}} of topics, compiled names of and began vetting potential political appointees for top jobs, arranged over 100 security clearances, and managed the logistics for expanding the operations after Election Day.|$|E

25|$|The {{mobilization}} of multiple sectors within China occurred over a 15-year period {{when there was}} a long series of educational workshops, conferences, collaborative projects, and networking between members at a number of levels of the government and administrative structural hierarchies. At local, national, and international forums, officials from many sectors were able to meet one another, share a common knowledge base, and debate the appropriateness of different interventions. Personal relationships were formed that facilitated the consideration and examination of previously unrecognised <b>policy</b> <b>options</b> for detection, prevention, and care.

This <b>policy</b> <b>option</b> has been used to mitigate the environmental impact of mines in the United States as part of a combined command-and-control and market incentive policy response to environmental protection. One risk attached to this <b>policy</b> <b>option</b> is that if wells become economically unproductive before the period planned for in the trust agreement, the abandoned well could become a liability held by the relevant government authority.|$|R

25|$|The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) {{consists}} of 12 members, seven from the Board of Governors and 5 {{of the regional}} Federal Reserve Bank presidents. The FOMC oversees and sets policy on open market operations, the principal tool of national monetary policy. These operations affect the amount of Federal Reserve balances available to depository institutions, thereby influencing overall monetary and credit conditions. The FOMC also directs operations undertaken by the Federal Reserve in foreign exchange markets. The FOMC must reach consensus on all decisions. The president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York is a permanent member of the FOMC; {{the presidents of the}} other banks rotate membership at two- and three-year intervals. All Regional Reserve Bank presidents contribute to the committee's assessment of the economy and of <b>policy</b> <b>options,</b> but only the five presidents who are then members of the FOMC vote on policy decisions. The FOMC determines its own internal organization and, by tradition, elects the Chair of the Board of Governors as its chair {{and the president of the}} Federal Reserve Bank of New York as its vice chair. Formal meetings typically are held eight times each year in Washington, D.C. Nonvoting Reserve Bank presidents also participate in Committee deliberations and discussion. The FOMC generally meets eight times a year in telephone consultations and other meetings are held when needed.|$|E

500|$|<b>Policy</b> <b>options</b> {{raised by}} Findlay {{included}} increasing the minimum wage, reintroduction of council house building, {{reduction in the}} use of the private sector in NHS Scotland, and allowing councils to set their own taxes to help reverse job losses within local government. He described himself as [...] "no machine politician", and called for a return to the [...] "timeless Labour values of community, solidarity, fairness and justice". He said that if elected as leader, his 2016 election campaign would focus on tackling youth unemployment, the introduction of a living wage, and improvements to health and social care. He said that he wanted to make the party more [...] "autonomous" [...] by involving its members and trade unions to create a party that was [...] "more collective and co-operative in nature". He also expressed the desire to establish a public inquiry into the practice of trade union blacklisting. Among his plans for devolution was for Holyrood to have power over employment regulations to enable the creation of a Scottish Health and Safety Executive and the introduction of corporate culpable homicide legislation.|$|E
500|$|Voting {{took place}} between 17 November and 10 December using the three-tier electoral college system, which gives parliamentarians, {{individual}} members, and affiliated bodies such as trade unions an equal say in the outcome. During this time, the candidates toured Scotland {{for a number of}} hustings meetings, at which they set out their direction for the party if elected. <b>Policy</b> <b>options</b> raised were centred on issues such as health, education, employment, and the prospect of further devolution to Scotland. The three leadership candidates were from different wings of the party–Murphy from the Labour right, Boyack from the centre, and Findlay from the left. Controversy ensued when the Unite trade union issued a mock ballot paper instructing members on which candidates to elect, and when two prominent Labour figures engaged in an argument about the contest on social media. On 13 December, Murphy was elected to lead the party, while Dugdale was chosen to become his deputy. In his victory speech, Murphy said that his election was a [...] "fresh start" [...] for Scottish Labour.|$|E

3000|$|As stated above, {{distributional}} {{issues were}} rarely considered. Walker et al. [113] claim {{that one reason}} why negative environmental impacts are unequally distributed could be that distributional issues have not been properly addressed in methods for assessing and evaluating policies in the UK. Munda [114 : 307]) argues that [...] "any <b>policy</b> <b>option</b> always implies winners and losers" [...] and it is thus imperative to check if a <b>policy</b> <b>option</b> seems preferable just because some dimension (e.g. the environmental) or some social actors (e.g. the low income groups) has not been taken into account. According to Svenfelt et al. [36] there is therefore a need to consider other types of assessment for scenarios than environmental ones, such as social impact assessment, gender impact assessment or equality impact assessment.|$|R
