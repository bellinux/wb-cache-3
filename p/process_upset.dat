50|$|Upset forging {{increases}} {{the diameter of}} the workpiece by compressing its length. Based on number of pieces produced this is the most widely used forging <b>process.</b> <b>Upset</b> forging is usually done in special high speed machines; the machines are usually set up to work in the horizontal plane to facilitate the quick exchange of workpieces from one station to the next. The initial workpiece is usually wire or rod, but some machines can accept bars up to 25 cm (10 in.) in diameter. The standard upsetting machine employs split dies that contain multiple cavities. The dies open enough to allow the workpiece to move from one cavity to the next; the dies then close and the heading tool, or ram, then moves longitudinally against the bar, upsetting it into the cavity. If all of the cavities are utilizes on every cycle then a finished part will be produced with every cycle, which is why this process is ideal for mass production.|$|E

5000|$|A {{relief valve}} or {{pressure}} relief valve (PRV) {{is a type of}} safety valve used to control or limit the pressure in a system; pressure might otherwise build up and create a <b>process</b> <b>upset,</b> instrument or equipment failure, or fire. The pressure is relieved by allowing the pressurised fluid to flow from an auxiliary passage out of the system. The relief valve is designed or set to open at a predetermined set pressure to protect pressure vessels and other equipment from being subjected to pressures that exceed their design limits. When the set pressure is exceeded, the relief valve becomes the [...] "path of least resistance" [...] as the valve is forced open and a portion of the fluid is diverted through the auxiliary route. The diverted fluid (liquid, gas or liquid-gas mixture) is usually routed through a piping system known as a flare header or relief header to a central, elevated gas flare where it is usually burned and the resulting combustion gases are released to the atmosphere. As the fluid is diverted, the pressure inside the vessel will stop rising. Once it reaches the valve's reseating pressure, the valve will close. The blowdown is usually stated as a percentage of set pressure and refers to how much the pressure needs to drop before the valve reseats. The blowdown can vary from roughly 2-20%, and some valves have adjustable blowdowns.|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to compare two {{alternative}} toxicity assessment methods to determine wastewater toxicity and predict treatment plant <b>process</b> <b>upsets.</b> The toxicity of two synthetic organic compounds (triclosan and 4 -n-nonylphenol), which are commonly detected in municipal wastewater, and municipal and industrial wastewaters with different heavy metals content were evaluated by the nitrification inhibition assay and bioluminescence toxicity test.

The nitrification inhibition assay appears to predict plant <b>process</b> <b>upsets</b> more accurately.

40|$|Safety-instrumented {{systems are}} used in {{industries}} to prevent {{the development of a}} <b>process</b> <b>upset</b> into an accident. For most processes, the desired response {{in the case of a}} <b>process</b> <b>upset</b> is to shutdown the process, and most safety-instrumented systems are designed so that this state is achieved in response to also specific item failures or loss of power. The side-effect of such fail-safe design may be that the safety-instrumented system is prone to spurious activation, meaning that the normal operation of the process may be interrupted in an untimely manner. In the design of a safety-instrumented system, it is therefore important to quantify the rate of spurious activation and to check the need for additional measures to ensure a stable as well as safe operation of the process. Unfortunately, weaknesses have been identified in formulas for spurious trip rate, and the aim of this paper is to present a further development of currently available analytical formulas. The paper builds the new formulas on a thorough discussion of the concepts of spurious activation, failure classification, and failure propagation in a safety-instrumented system. The proposed formulas are compared with existing ones for selected architectures, and some conclusions are drawn...|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{determine}} the potential of biochemical parameters, such as enzyme activity and adenosine triphosphate (ATP) levels, as monitors of process performance in the Upflow Anaerobic Sludge Blanket (UASB) reactor utilizing a starch wastewater. The acid and alkaline phosphatase activity and the ATP content of the UASB sludge were measured in response to changes in flow rate and nutrient loading. Conventional parameters of process performance, such as gas production, acetic acid production, COD, phosphorus, nitrogen and suspended solids loadings and % COD removal were also monitored. The response of both biochemical and conventional parameters to changing process conditions was then compared. Alkaline phosphatase activity exhibited the highest activity over the entire study perioda A high suspended solids loading was observed to upset the system in terms of gas production, acetic acid production and % COD removala The initial rate of increase in alkaline phosphatase activity following an increase in loading was four times as great during <b>process</b> <b>upset</b> than under conditions of good performance. The change in enzyme actiVity was also more sensitive to <b>process</b> <b>upset</b> than changes in acetic acid production. The change in ATP content of the sludge with time suggested that enzyme actiVity was changing independently of the actual viable biomass present. The bacterial composition of the anaerobic sludge granules was similar to that of other sludge bed systems, at the light and scanning electron microscope level.
