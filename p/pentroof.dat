40|$|The Oxford Archaeological Unit (OAU) were {{commissioned}} by Kvaerner Construction Ltd. {{to undertake a}} programme of archaeological recording at the Grade II Listed building at 4 Boys Hall Road, Willesborough, Kent (NGR: TQ 6026 1412) in advance of demolition. The survey was carried out between 10 - 12 th May 1999. The building would appear to originate, in the early 19 th century, as a three cell, in-line single storey brick built structure. The nature of the primary building remains uncertain though the identification of a primary fireplace within the central room would appear to indicate a domestic function. This is perhaps supported by the evidence of a property survey undertaken {{in advance of the}} construction of the railway which describes the building as a 'lodge', related to No. 2 Boys Hall Road. In c. 1890, the building was extended by the addition of a first floor of timber stud construction clad externally with decorative banded tiles and providing three additional rooms. Additional heating was provided in the central, first floor room and by the construction of a second stack to {{the southern part of the}} building with fireplaces at ground and first floor levels.

50|$|The George Tromley Sr. House is {{a two-story}} {{structure}} {{that was built}} in two sections. The older section {{of the house is}} in the front, and is constructed of brick, that is now painted white, and is capped with a low pitched hipped roof. It features a three-bay front with the main entrance to the left that is sheltered by a small gable roofed porch. It is probably a later addition. The windows have lintels with nearly flat pediments. The newer section was built of frame construction {{on the back of the}} older section, and it is also capped with a hipped roof. Its windows are set in flat enframements and are topped with narrow cornices. A single-story porch with <b>pentroof</b> is located in the angle formed by the two sections.

50|$|The 16-valve, single-overhead-camshaft {{cylinder}} head features four valves per cylinder and <b>pentroof</b> combustion chambers.

Valve actuation is via rocker arms and a hollow, belt-driven single overhead camshaft. The single-over-head-camshaft design requires less under-hood space than the more conventional dual overhead camshafts normally used with 16-valve, 4-cylinder engines. The adoption of a sophisticated knock control system optimizes ignition timing and allows for a higher compression ratio (9.3:1 from 8.8:1). Unleaded regular fuel is specified.|$|E

This was Toyota's first multi-valve twincam engine {{to make it to}} the market, and won the [...] "JSME Medal for New Technology" [...] (Japan Society of Mechanical Engineers) in 1982. To minimize the downsides of a multi-valve setup, the 1G-GEU was also equipped with T-VIS (Toyota Variable Induction System), increasing low to mid-engine speed torque. Like all following twin cam Toyotas, it used a timing belt rather than chain, for less noise and lower maintenance requirements. In August 1983, the fuel injection system was changed to EFI-D, which measures the pressure in the intake manifold to determine the proper air-fuel mixture.|$|E
5000|$|Cosworth's {{involvement}} with Mercedes-Benz came with {{moves in the}} mid-1980s from the German manufacturer to re-enter motorsport after retiring from direct factory participation after the tragic 1955 Le Mans crash which killed 80 spectators. Mercedes-Benz was looking to create a Group B rally car out of its new W201 Chassis (190E Model) {{and turned to the}} expertise of Cosworth to shorten the development time for this project.The request was a huge surprise for Cosworth, and the original brief for a 320 bhp engine based on the 136 bhp Mercedes M102 2.3-litre SOHC 4-cylinder engine was duly passed to Mike Hall, who [...] "drew the famed DFV and BDA engine". Designed around the existing M102 head bolt pattern, the new twin cam, 16-valve, <b>pentroof</b> head, had its valves set at 45° included angle, rather than the 40° angle of the BDA. [...] The valves were the biggest that could be fitted into the combustion chamber. Flat top pistons delivered the 10.5:1 compression ratio. The new Cosworth WAA engine also was Cosworth's first one-piece head, i.e. the camshaft carrier was cast integral with the head itself. Again the constraints of the existing head-bolt pattern meant that Hall had to shift the camshaft bearings from outside each pair of camlobes as in the BDA to in between each cylinder's pair of cam lobes. The upside being that this configuration made for less flex at high rpm.|$|E

In this paper both LDV and PIV measurements were undertaken in an optical spark-ignition at 1500 RPM 0. 5 bar inlet plenum pressure. One of the primary PIV planes was vertical cutting through the centrally located spark plug (tumble plane) inside the <b>pentroof</b> at ignition timing. The other plane was horizontal inside the <b>pentroof</b> 1 mm below the spark plug LDV was conducted 1 mm below the spark plug on a line from inlet to exhaust but also on a lower line 14 mm below the spark plug. In-cylinder PIV data at specific crank angles in the intake and compression strokes were also analysed on the central tumble plane and on a horizontal plane 14 mm below the spark plug. The combination of both techniques allowed high spatial and temporal resolution as the two data sets complemented each other to provide details of mean flow and turbulence characteristics on different levels, aiming ultimately for quantification of integral time scales and length scales. LDV cycle-resolved analysis distinguished between the classic approach of using the time integral of the autocorrelation function to obtain the integral time scale and a high-frequency cut-off analysis to obtain high- and low-frequency fluctuations about an in-cycle mean...|$|E

The two-dimensional velocity vector fields are analyzed on a vertical plane passing through the axis of the cylinder. To quantify the tumble flows, tumble ratio (TR) and average turbulent kinetic energy (ATKE) are estimated from the ensemble average velocity vectors obtained from PIV measurements. It is found that, the TR and ATKE are higher for pentroof-offset-cavity piston than pentroof-central-cavity piston.

In this study, KIVA- 3 V has been employed to investigate the mixing process involving the fuel, air and the IEGR inside a <b>pentroof</b> engine.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to characterise barrel swirl {{behaviour}} in a production four-valve engine with <b>pentroof</b> chamber. Steady flow analysis showed that the insertion of tubes into the cylinder head's induction tracts increased the tumbling ratio of the in-cylinder flow field at intake valve closure. A comparison of LDA measurements, conducted along the spark plug axis, for tubes and no tubes inserted yielded the following conclusions. The results indicated that the barrel swirl generated was not efficiently breaking down into turbulence but forming two counter-rotating vortices in the horizontal cylinder plane. The turbulence levels and cycle-to-cycle flow variations towards the end of the compression stroke increased with tumbling ratio. The former suggested faster combustion rates if applied to a lean burn engine, however, the latter suggested greater cyclic combustion instability and may limit lean burn capability. Both the rotational sense of the vortices and their cyclic stability appeared to be sensitive to tumbling ratio...|$|E
40|$|The present {{investigation}} is centered around two motored research gasoline direct-injection engines, {{equipped with a}} pressure-swirl atomizer closely spaced with the centrally located spark plug. At first a Laser Doppler Velocimetry system was employed to characterize the in-cylinder airflow {{in one of the}} engines. A comparison was made to velocity profiles in a port-fuel-injected engine of similar design characteristics, which revealed a different decay mechanism of the large-scale flow structure and associated higher turbulence levels in the <b>pentroof</b> of the cylinder. Second, images of the hollow cone fuel spray generated by the direct injector were recorded for three different injection timings in order to discuss the temporal and spatial development of the liquid phase in the engine cylinder in terms of its interaction with the gas motion. The inclined annular gas jet entering the cylinder through the intake valves was found to affect the air entrainment in the fuel spray and its symmetry for injection during the intake stroke. For fuel injection at bottom dead center, the effect of the gas momentum was small and only noticeable late in the injection event far downstream of the injector nozzle. Images obtained for injection during compression show the effect of the elevated gas densities on the fuel spray but no visible effect of the intake generated in-cylinder gas motion...|$|E
40|$|International audienceThe {{origins of}} cyclic {{combustion}} variability (CCV) in spark-ignition engines are investigated using Large-Eddy Simulation (LES) {{of a stable}} (low CCV) and two unstable (high CCV) operating points of a specifically dedicated experimental test-rig set up around a four valve <b>pentroof</b> single cylindre spark-ignition engine fueled with a premixture of gaseous propane and air. The unstable points are obtained from the reference by reducing significantly the equivalence ratio and by an important dilution by nitrogen respectively. A LES methodology is proposed and shown {{to be able to}} reproduce the experimental findings concerning phase-averaged mean and statistical variations around it of a number of key engine combustion parameters. The CCV and factors causing it are first illustrated by comparing typical slow and fast burning cycles in combination with simple correlation plots of major engine parameters, this allows qualitatively showing how local and global sources concur to generate CCV. In a second step, single parameter and multivariate regressions build from the LES results allow quantifying the relative importance of different local and global CCV sources. Finally, the comparison of the obtained findings as to the relative importance of major parameters on CCV are compared with qualitative summary from an extensive experimental survey by Ozdor et al. The presented LES results overall confirm major findings from the survey, but also indicate that detailed causes of CCV depend on the type of engine and its operation...|$|E
40|$|AbstractResearch into novel {{internal}} combustion engines requires {{consideration of the}} diversity in future fuels {{in an attempt to}} reduce drastically CO 2 emissions from vehicles and promote energy sustainability. Hydrogen has been proposed as a possible fuel for future {{internal combustion}} engines and can be produced from renewable sources. Hydrogen’s wide flammability range allows higher engine efficiency than conventional fuels with both reduced toxic emissions and no CO 2 gases. Most previous work on hydrogen engines has focused on spark-ignition operation. The current paper presents results from an optical study of controlled autoignition (or homogeneous charge compression ignition) of hydrogen in an engine of latest spark-ignition <b>pentroof</b> combustion chamber geometry with direct injection of hydrogen (100 bar). This was achieved by a combination of inlet air preheating in the range 200 – 400 °C and residual gas recirculated internally by negative valve overlap. Hydrogen fuelling was set to various values of equivalence ratio, typically in the range ϕ= 0. 40 – 0. 63. Crank-angle resolved flame chemiluminescence images were acquired for a series of consecutive cycles at 1000 RPM in order to calculate in-cylinder rates of flame expansion and motion. Planar Laser Induced Fluorescence (LIF) of OH was also applied to record more detailed features of the autoignition pattern. Single and double (i. e. ‘split’ per cycle) hydrogen injection strategies were employed in order to identify the effect of mixture preparation on autoignition’s timing and spatial development. An attempt was also made to review relevant in-cylinder phenomena from the limited literature on hydrogen-fuelled spark-ignition optical engines and make comparisons were appropriate...|$|E
40|$|This is {{a conference}} paper. The {{shortcomings}} of traditional combustion techniques are being continually evaluated and alternate combustion modes are being sought. One such combustion mode that is receiving {{a lot of}} attention is Homogenous Charge Compression Ignition (HCCI). HCCI is a combustion process that {{has the potential to be}} highly efficient and produces low emissions. It can provide high, diesel-like efficiencies using gasoline, diesel, and most alternative fuels. The major drawback with HCCI is controlling the ignition timing over a wide range of load and speed. The local chemical and thermal conditions of the charge mixture, towards the end of the compression stroke, have significant influences on the set-off auto-ignition. In this paper, numerical study has been carried out to examine the effects of mixture quality on the occurrence of auto-ignition at the end of the compression stroke inside a <b>pentroof</b> combustion chamber. The effect of different Internal Exhaust Gas Re-circulation (IEGR) are investigated. The use of IEGR acts as an indirect control method, the rate of combustion can be slowed down; however the percentage of IEGR retained in the cylinder affects the onset of auto-ignition. The calculated results have been validated against published experimental data, so that the correlation between the two can be discussed. It is found that the inhomogeneity of the air, fuel and the IEGR mixing, presented here in terms of temperature distribution, plays an important role in initiating, and potentially further controlling the HCCI combustion. During the compression process, certain parts of the engine charge are found to reach a higher temperature which auto-ignited depending on the percentages of IEGR used...|$|E
40|$|The {{three-dimensional}} {{bulk gas}} motion in an engine cylinder with different flow scales generates a varied range of shear stresses and deformations in the fluid, {{which leads to}} the gas turbulence. These flow irregularities combined with periodic engine operation induce gas fluctuations over time and cylinder volume. This affects the thermal inhomogeneity of the in-cylinder gas mixture composition. A novel approach to the formation of in-cylinder flow that promote Homogeneous Charge Compression Ignition HCCI engine by generating various patterns of the incylinder flow has been proposed. Two types of inlet manifold diffusers were experimentally applied to a 4 -valve <b>pentroof</b> optical engine and the spatial flow inhomogeneities were carefully analysed. Additional special effects in the in-cylinder flow fields were induced by using the Negative Valve Overlap (NVO) technique. Case studies for internal nonreactive ‘COLD’ flow structures were investigated using a motored single cylinder optical engine and Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV) technique to validate a 3 -D CFD engine model. The optical diagnostics and CFD modelling of the in-cylinder HCCI ‘COLD’ flow show that two different porting strategies with fixed Negative Valve Overlap (NVO) significantly affect the in-cylinder flow structures. A comparison of in-cylinder flow effects generated by different intake deflectors indicate that a low-swirl port configuration can potentially improve the fuel and thermal homogeneity by producing higher values of Root Mean Square (RMS) of velocity fluctuation and turbulence intensity. The high-swirl port configuration generates high stratification of gas flow field at Top Dead Centre (TDC). The final part of the study investigates the stratification of gas temperatures. The 3 studies show that both of the intake shrouds generate differences in the rate of change of the large scale rotating flow affecting the gas transport and mixing process within the engine cylinder.

40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfillment}} of the requirements for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. The in-cylinder combustion dynamics of spark-ignition (SI) engines involves a complex interaction of physical and chemical processes. Despite significant progress In the numerical simulation of these phenomena with computational fluid dynamics (CFD), {{there is a need}} for generalised models to describe the emission, absorption and scattering of thermal radiation within the 'participating' combustion gases. Therefore, the present work advances the predictive capability of nurnerical methods for radiation transport in participating media for inclusion into an established finite-volume CFD code. The research focuses on three radiation methods: discrete transfer, YIX and a pathlengthbased Monte Carlo algorithm. The three-dimensional formulation and coding of each method combines the best available knowledge from heat transfer, statistical and graphics literature. In particular, the tracing and searching of complex arbitrary geometries utilises an efficient ray-triangle intersection algorithm in a novel way to handle cell face distortion and edge intersections with minimum computation. A new general weighted-sum-ofgray- gases model (WSGG) is implernented in order to first resolve the spectral (nongray) dependence of high-temperature gas radiative properties prior to solution by one of the three radiation methods. The present methods are first verified against published benchmark solutions for radiating media in the absence of other modes of heat transfer. Subsequently, the discrete transfer- WSGG model is coupled with the engine-specific CFD code KIVA- 11 for studies of the flow field, flame propagation and infrared emission in pancake and <b>pentroof</b> SI engines. Here, the Favre-averaged Navier-Stokes, energy and radiation conservation equations are solved over a nonorthogonal, curvilinear mesh of arbitrary hexahedrons, body-fitted to the combustion chamber geometry. Flexible algebraic and elliptic mesh generation tools are developed for this purpose. Additional k-F- turbulence terms for variable density flows, the EDC model for mixing-controlled combustion, the Shell model for auto-ignition and the capability to simulate ports and valves with wave action are new features added to KIVA- 11 to ensure a good description of the turbulent, chemically reacting flow field as a basis for the radiation studies. Comparisons with experimental measurements from optical engine studies are presented...|$|E
40|$|This work {{focuses on}} aspects of {{combustion}} in a spark ignition engine. A pent-roof research engine {{was used to}} generate an experimental data set which was combined with a preexisting data set from a disc-chamber research engine. The combined dataset was used to refine a thermodynamic spark ignition engine combustion code which could operate in either a three-zone entrainment and bum up, or a two-zone direct combustion, configuration. The pent-roof engine was skip-fired to ensure residual gases were purged and care was taken {{to ensure that the}} thermodynamic state and chemical composition of the intake mixture were well defined. The combustion chamber, which featured near complete optical access, was illuminated using a sheet of laser light. Mie scattered laser light from fine seed particles was recorded allowing the position of the flame front to be tracked. These images were then ensemble averaged and combined to give a three-dimensional reconstruction of the mean combustion progress variable field for three different engine speeds. As the flame approached the combustion chamber walls it was found to decelerate. A relationship between the burning velocity of an unconstrained flame and a flame approaching a wall was derived which agreed well with the experimental results. This relationship was incorporated into the engine simulation code and found to improve greatly the predictions of the two-zone combustion model. New flame acceleration and laminar burning velocity submodels reported in the literature were added to the engine simulation code. The suitability of these models for simulating spark ignition engine combustion was evaluated using the disc and pent roof experimental data sets and model constants adjusted to optimise the performance of each submodel. Although there were substantial differences between the individual submodels, over the range of operating conditions for which experimental data was available changes to the submodel used had a negligible effect on the combustion model predictions. The work concludes with an evaluation of the performance of the three-zone combustion model for simulating a pent-roof engine. The model was modified for the pent-roof engine to include suitable assumptions for turbulence and the position of the centre of the flame. Using constants which were chosen to fit data recorded in the disc chamber engine, the model predictions for the <b>pentroof</b> engine were comparable in accuracy to predictions for the disc roof engine. The model was incorporated in a commercially available manifold gas dynamics simulation software to allow the predictive simulation of complete engine cycles.
