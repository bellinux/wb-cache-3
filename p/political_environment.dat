5|$|The {{continued}} {{focus on}} the ABC hypothesis by anti-abortion groups has fostered a confrontational <b>political</b> <b>environment.</b> Anti-abortion advocates and scientists alike have responded with criticisms.

5|$|The {{domestic}} <b>political</b> <b>environment</b> {{was further}} complicated {{by the death of}} Paul Eyschen, who had been Prime Minister for 27 years.

5|$|Given {{the heated}} <b>{{political}}</b> <b>environment</b> of the Old Court-New Court controversy, allies {{of his father}} claimed that the governor's political enemies had framed his son. The governor's legislative allies passed legislation providing for a favorable change of venue for the trial, and the governor used his appointment power to ensure that sympathetic judges would hear the case. Isaac Desha was twice convicted, but both times, {{the judge in the}} case set aside the verdict on procedural grounds. While awaiting a third trial, Desha attempted suicide by slitting his throat, but doctors saved his life, reconnecting his severed windpipe with a silver tube. Shortly after the suicide attempt, Governor Desha issued a pardon for his son.|$|E
5|$|It {{appears that}} after this first wave of {{destruction}} a short-lived revival of Mycenaean culture followed. Mycenaean Greece continues to be mentioned in international affairs, particularly in Hittite records. In c. 1220 BC, the king of Ahhiyawa is again reported to {{have been involved in}} an anti-Hittite uprising in western Anatolia. Another contemporary Hittite account reports that Ahhiyawan ships should avoid Assyrian-controlled harbors, as part of a trade embargo imposed on Assyria. In general, {{in the second half of}} 13th century BC, trade was in decline in the Eastern Mediterranean, most probably due to the unstable <b>political</b> <b>environment</b> there.|$|E
5|$|Prior to the {{recession}} of the 1990s, downtown Albany was home to four Fortune 500 companies. After the death of Corning and the retirement of Congressman Sam Stratton, the <b>political</b> <b>environment</b> changes. Long-term office holders became rare in the 1980s. Local media began following the drama surrounding county politics (specifically that of the newly created county executive position); the loss of Corning (and eventually the machine) led {{to a lack of}} interest in city politics. The election of Gerald Jennings was a surprise, and he served as Mayor from 1994 until his retirement at the end of 2013. His tenure essentially ended the political machine that had been in place since the 1920s.|$|E

40|$|A {{key idea}} in {{political}} economy is that policy is often tailored to {{voters who are}} not ideologically attached - swing voters. We show, however, that in <b>political</b> <b>environments</b> where <b>political</b> parties can use repression and violence to exclude voters from elections, they may optimally target the swing voters. This is because they anticipate {{that if they had}} to compete for the support of these voters, they would end up giving them a lot of policy favors. Hence in weakly institutionalized <b>political</b> <b>environments</b> swing voters are cursed rather than blessed. We illustrate the analysis with a discussion of recent political events in Zimbabwe. ...|$|R
5|$|Stone's {{organizational}} {{activities for}} the cause of women's rights yielded tangible gains in the difficult <b>political</b> <b>environment</b> of the 19th century. Stone helped initiate the first National Women's Rights Convention in Worcester, Massachusetts and she supported and sustained it annually, along with a number of other local, state and regional activist conventions. Stone spoke in front of a number of legislative bodies to promote laws giving more rights to women. She assisted in establishing the Woman's National Loyal League to help pass the Thirteenth Amendment and thereby abolish slavery, after which she helped form the American Woman Suffrage Association (AWSA), which built support for a woman suffrage Constitutional amendment by winning woman suffrage {{at the state and local}} levels.|$|E
5|$|The wider <b>political</b> <b>environment</b> in Europe {{during the}} 15th and 16th centuries was also volatile. For centuries the {{relationship}} with the Confederation's powerful neighbour, France, determined the foreign policies of the Swiss. Nominally, the Confederation formed a part of the Holy Roman Empire. However, through a succession of wars culminating in the Swabian War in 1499, the Confederation had become de facto independent. As the two continental powers and minor regional states such as the Duchy of Milan, the Duchy of Savoy, and the Papal States competed and fought against each other, there were far-reaching political, economic, and social consequences for the Confederation. During this time the mercenary pension system became a subject of disagreement. The religious factions of Zwingli's time debated vociferously the merits of sending young Swiss men to fight in foreign wars mainly for the enrichment of the cantonal authorities.|$|E
5|$|Even as {{the growth}} of the {{technology}} sector transformed the region's economy, progressive politics continued to guide the region's <b>political</b> <b>environment.</b> By the turn of the millennium, Non-Hispanic whites, the largest ethnic group in the United States, were only half of the population in the Bay Area as immigration among minority groups accelerated. During this time, the Bay Area {{was the center of the}} LGBT rights movement: in 2004, San Francisco began issuing marriage licenses to same-sex couples, a first in the United States, and four years later, a majority of voters in the Bay Area rejected California Proposition 8, which sought to constitutionally restrict marriage to opposite-sex couples but ultimately passed statewide. The Bay Area was also the center of contentious protests concerning racial and economic inequality. In 2009, an African American man named Oscar Grant was fatally shot by Bay Area Rapid Transit police officers, precipitating widespread protests across the region and even riots in Oakland, and whose name was symbolically tied to the Occupy Oakland protests two years later that sought to fight against social and economic inequality. Following the Inauguration of Donald Trump as President of the United States in 2017, the Bay Area became a center of resistance to his administration, beginning with widespread protests in concert with the nationwide Women's March a day later, followed by frequent public feuds between Trump and various Bay Area political, cultural, and business figures over issues of race and immigration, among others.|$|E
40|$|This paper quantitatively assesses time inconsistency, {{asymmetric}} information, and polit-ical {{ideology in}} monopoly regulation of electricity distribution companies. Empirically, {{we estimate that}} (1) there is under-investment in electricity distribution capital to reduce power outages, (2) more conservative <b>political</b> <b>environments</b> have higher regulated returns, and (3) more conservative <b>political</b> <b>environments</b> have more electricity lost in distribution. We explain these empirical results with an estimated dynamic game model of utility regulation featuring investment and asymmetric information. We quantify the value of regulatory commitment in inducing more investment. Conservative regulators improve welfare losses due to time incon-sistency, but worsen losses from asymmetric information...|$|R

40|$|Why is it {{important}} to compare the experiences, successes and difficulties of Mohammad Khatami and Mikhail Gorbachev, two leaders operating in very different <b>political</b> <b>environments</b> and cultures? Both men were products {{of two of the}} 20 th century's most momentous revolutions and both sought to reform from within the contradictions and problems which these revolutions produced. Zhand Shakibi provides the first comparative analysis of Khatami and Gorbachev based on first-hand interviews and previously unpublished sources, revealing the extent of their common goals and predicaments. The importance of this study lies in its demonstration of how similar political features in completely different <b>political</b> <b>environments</b> can produce common political outcomes. This book is a fascinating resource for political scientists, international relations specialists and historians of 20 th century politics...|$|R
