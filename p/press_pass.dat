5|$|For {{activities}} {{open to the}} public, such {{as community}} gatherings, school events, or trade shows, a police- or media-issued <b>press</b> <b>pass</b> may offer little advantage. Free or reduced-price admission, or guaranteed entry, can sometimes be arranged. The benefits may be more extensive, granting access to front-row seats or to press-only rooms. For sporting events, a <b>press</b> <b>pass</b> issued by a stadium grants access to the press box. Because open events are usually funded by paying attendees, the number of press passes may depend {{on the number of}} tickets sold.|$|E

25|$|After Cooper {{graduated}} from Yale University, {{he tried to}} gain entry-level employment with ABC answering telephones, but was unsuccessful. Finding {{it hard to get}} his foot in the door of on-air reporting, Cooper decided to enlist the help of a friend in making a fake <b>press</b> <b>pass.</b> At the time, Cooper was working as a fact checker for the small news agency Channel One, which produces a youth-oriented news program that is broadcast to many junior high and high schools in the United States. Cooper then entered Myanmar on his own with his forged <b>press</b> <b>pass</b> and met with students fighting the Burmese government. He was ultimately able to sell his home-made news segments to Channel One.|$|E

500|$|<b>Press</b> <b>passes</b> not {{issued by}} a {{recognised}} publication {{can be obtained}} or made, {{with the intention of}} gaining benefits offered to holders of legitimate press cards. Joan Stewart of the Public Relations Society of America reports, “Fake <b>press</b> <b>passes</b> abound at restaurant and theater openings, sporting events, music festivals, political rallies, celebrity parties and even crime scenes. With a decent computer and color printer, almost anybody can crank out an official-looking pass within minutes.” ...|$|R
500|$|A <b>press</b> <b>pass</b> (alternatively {{referred}} to as a press card or a journalist pass) grants some type of special privilege to journalists. [...] Some cards have recognized legal status; others merely indicate that the bearer is a practicing journalist. [...] The nature of the benefits is determined by the type of issuing agency, of which there are three major categories: news organizations, law-enforcement agencies, and event organizers (usually for a specific single affair like a corporate press conference). [...] Each type of card grants different authorizations, thus it is often necessary or desirable for reporters to hold multiple press passes simultaneously.|$|E
500|$|From May 1944 to March 1945, Hemingway was in London and Europe. When Hemingway {{first arrived}} in London, he met Time {{magazine}} correspondent Mary Welsh, with whom he became infatuated. Martha {{had been forced to}} cross the Atlantic in a ship filled with explosives because Hemingway refused to help her get a <b>press</b> <b>pass</b> on a plane, and she arrived in London to find Hemingway hospitalized with a concussion from a car accident. Unsympathetic to his plight, she accused him of being a bully and told him that she was [...] "through, absolutely finished". The last time that Hemingway saw Martha was in March 1945 as he was preparing to return to Cuba, and their divorce was finalized later that same year. Meanwhile, he had asked Mary Welsh to marry him on their third meeting.|$|E
500|$|The National Union of Journalists (NUJ) has criticised FITs {{for their}} {{surveillance}} and sometimes violent harassment of working journalists. Marc Vallee, who was hospitalised by police after documenting a protest, {{has said that}} the teams limit freedom of the press and called on the Home Office to confirm that the police had no right to restrict the work of photojournalists. Bob Broadhurst, {{who is in charge of}} public order policing at the Metropolitan Police, said in a statement to the NUJ in 2008 that journalists, [...] "on the production of a valid form of accreditation will be able to continue with their work". The NUJ are to make a formal complaint to the Information Commissioner due to the Metropolitan Police failing to provide details on the surveillance of journalists under the Freedom of Information Act. Bob Broadhurst told photographers at an NUJ conference that he had no faith in the National Press Card (a form of <b>press</b> <b>pass)</b> despite journalists needing to prove that they are bona-fide newsgatherers to an independent authority before they are issued.|$|E
5000|$|Police {{departments}} at a city, county, or state/provincial level {{may issue}} <b>press</b> <b>passes</b> in some countries. [...] Such passes allow the bearer to cross police or fire lines to report breaking news, or grant access to crime scenes or other restricted areas-though admission may be denied {{if it would}} interfere with the duties of emergency personnel. Popular media of the mid-20th century often depicted reporters {{at a crime scene}} with their <b>press</b> <b>passes</b> tucked into their hat bands, which was unusual in reality.|$|R

500|$|Compounding their {{difficulties}} were Bryant's ongoing {{relationship with}} O'Neill and gynecological problems {{she was treated}} for while Reed was in the hospital. When he returned from Baltimore in mid-December, Reed and Bryant retreated full-time to Croton-on-Hudson to recuperate and to focus on writing. They made plans to travel to China in 1917 to cover events for American publications, but in January the plans fell through when U.S. entry into World War I against Germany became highly likely. (The U.S. entered the war on April 6.) To boost their finances, they sold the cottage in Truro to Margaret Sanger, and Reed pawned his father's gold watch. At the same time, his strong anti-war positions, enunciated in The Masses and elsewhere, alienated most of his employers, further reducing his income. Adding to these stresses was Reed's confession to Bryant {{that he had had}} multiple love affairs, and the subsequent unhappiness between Bryant and Reed led to a temporary separation. When she expressed a desire to go to Europe, he helped her convince John N. Wheeler, who had recently formed the Bell Syndicate, to issue her a <b>press</b> <b>pass.</b> Reed paid for her passage, and Bryant set sail in June to cover the war in France. Regrets quickly followed. According to biographer Virginia Gardner: ...|$|E
500|$|On {{the morning}} of 19 November, the ECMM became aware that {{organised}} resistance had ceased in Vukovar, {{but it did not}} receive any information on the fate of the hospital patients. Consequently, the head of the ECMM, ambassador Dirk Jan van Houten, contacted Rašeta asking him to intervene on the ECMM's behalf. That day, a JNA unit arrived at the hospital and Bosanac was taken to meet JNA Colonel Mile Mrkšić. According to Bosanac, Mrkšić told her that he was not obligated by the evacuation agreement. Even though the ICRC was not granted access to Vukovar by JNA officers at the scene, in the early evening of 19 November, ICRC representative Nicolas Borsinger managed to reach the hospital claiming he had an appointment with [...] "a general". Once there, Borsinger found a JNA captain in charge of the facility who agreed to grant the ICRC access. Borsinger then rejoined the ICRC convoy that was moving towards the hospital to evacuate it. The hospital was also toured by French reporter Agnès Vahramian that day, and there she recorded an interview with Jean-Michel Nicolier, a wounded Frenchman who fought alongside Croatian forces in Vukovar. Vahramian offered Nicolier a <b>press</b> <b>pass</b> to try {{to get him out of}} the city, but he refused.|$|E

2500|$|Journalists {{have said}} that it can take weeks {{to get the kind}} of {{clearance}} Gannon received. He was issued one-day press passes for nearly two years, avoiding the extensive background checks required for permanent passes, and sidestepping his inability to gain the necessary Congressional <b>press</b> <b>pass.</b> He applied for a Congressional <b>press</b> <b>pass</b> in April 2004 but was denied one by the Standing Committee of Correspondents, a group of congressional reporters who oversee press credential distribution on Capitol Hill, on the grounds that Talon did not qualify as a legitimate independent news service. On his resume Gannon said he is a graduate of the Leadership Institute Broadcast School of Journalism, a two-day seminar for [...] "conservatives who want a career in journalism." ...|$|E
2500|$|White House Press Secretary Scott McClellan {{later said}} {{that there had been}} no {{breakdown}} in security and no one had intervened on Gannon's behalf to ensure his access, {{despite the fact that he}} had been able to get a <b>press</b> <b>pass</b> for the White House using an assumed name. Gannon's response was that the alias Jeff Gannon was a professional name used for convenience, claiming that his [...] "real last name is hard to spell and pronounce," [...] and that the Secret Service was aware of his identity.|$|E
2500|$|Gannon {{routinely}} obtained daily {{passes to}} White House briefings, attending four Bush press conferences and appearing regularly at White House press briefings. Although {{he did not}} qualify for a Congressional <b>press</b> <b>pass,</b> Gannon was given daily passes to White House press briefings [...] "after supplying his real name, date of birth and Social Security number." [...] Gannon came under public scrutiny for his lack of a journalistic background prior to his work with Talon and his involvement with various gay escort service websites using the professional name [...] "Bulldog." ...|$|E
