(Manuscript) As a consequence of the expected population growth towards 2050, the demand for food, and in particular proteins, will increase. Due to limited resources of arable land and freshwater, this increase cannot come in the agricultural sector alone. At present, the utilization of marine environments for food production is low and should be increased. Seaweeds are fast-growing plants occurring in marine environments worldwide and some of them have proven to be rich in proteins. Living in oceans, they neither need arable land nor freshwater in order to grow and as primary producers they absorb inorganic compounds from their surroundings and convert them into macronutrients. The overall aims of this project were to examine the nutritional quality, along with effects of processing on bioaccessibility and extractability of seaweed proteins, and to evaluate their suitability as food, feed or ingredients in such. The specific goals were limited to i) document the nutritional composition in ten different seaweed species, ii) study the impact of heat treatment on the bioaccessibility of seaweed proteins, and iii) study the effect of enzymatic treatment on the bioaccessibility and extractability of seaweed proteins. The lipid contents in seaweeds were generally low, while mineral contents were high. The protein contents were generally higher in red seaweeds than in the other classes. However, the variation in protein contents within the brown and green seaweeds were large. The protein contents were generally lower than presented in many other studies, most likely due to methodological differences. However, also seasonal and geographical variations may have influenced this. The proteins in several of the analysed seaweeds were found to be complete proteins, as they contained sufficient amounts of the essential amino acids in order to cover the human requirements. Both protein content and quality of dulse (<b>Palmaria</b> <b>palmata)</b> were higher compared to that of wheat, corn and rice. In P. palmata, heat treatment increased the amount of accessible amino acids and the amount of amino acids liberated during a simulated gastrointestinal digestion model. The contents of essential amino acids were not negatively affected {{as a result of the}} process. For winged kelp (Alaria esculenta), no equivalent changes were observed. Also enzymatic treatment of P. palmata increased the amount of accessible amino acids and the amount of amino acids liberated during a simulated gastrointestinal digestion model.

Marine biotechnology is {{at an early stage}} of development, and therefore, more of the potential global market is open for development by Ireland than is the case for other sectors. A key area of growth, both in Ireland and Europe is the use of seaweeds for various applications including bioremediation of heavy metal contaminated waters. This thesis has demonstrated a method for identifying the most promising seaweeds for metal biosorption through the use of multiple analytical techniques. A comprehensive study of dead biomass of six locally derived seaweeds (Fucus vesiculosus, Fucus spiralis, Ulva lactuca, Ulva spp., <b>Palmaria</b> <b>palmata</b> and Polysiphonia lanosa) and three regionally significant metals (Cu (II), Cr (III) and Cr (VI)) was carried out. Fundamental investigations into metal binding were undertaken {{in order to determine the}} potential binding capacity of the seaweeds, the factors influencing binding and their potential mechanisms of binding. This work has adapted a number of analytical techniques previously used for seaweed analysis and modified them so that binding information supplementary to that found in the literature could be obtained. Studies indicated that seaweed is polyfunctional in nature with groups of varying affinities for metal ions. The quantity and distribution of these groups varied between species. Variations in experimental parameters were shown to influence the quantity of metal bound to the seaweeds, with optimum conditions dependent on the metal under investigation. Isotherm modelling revealed that Fucus vesiculosus and Polysiphonia lanosa were most effective in removing cations and anions respectively from solutions containing high residual metal concentrations while <b>Palmaria</b> <b>palmata</b> was superior for both cation and anion removal at low residual concentrations. Therefore, this implied that the most suitable seaweed biosorbent was ultimately dependent upon its final application. Changes in seaweed functional groups after metal binding were monitored using FTIR analysis with novel information on the timescale of Cu (II) binding presented. Ion-exchange and complexation mechanisms were shown to occur for cation binding while a surface reduction mechanism was also apparent during anion binding. The use of multiple chemical modification techniques confirmed binding mechanisms and identified a methodology for capacity enhancement of the seaweeds. Important changes in surface morphology and binding mechanism were established using surface analysis techniques such as SEM/EDX and XPS while a novel methodology for seaweed surface analysis using SFM was also demonstrated...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: Algae {{species have}} been used as an {{important}} source of food because they are highly nutritive considering their vitamin, protein, mineral, fiber, essential fatty acid and carbohydrate contents. However, a large number of seaweeds have been poorly studied, especially Brazilian species. Two red macroalgae species from the Brazilian coast (Plocamium brasiliense and Ochtodes secundiramea) were assessed with respect to their total lipid, fatty acid, total nitrogen, protein, amino acid and total carbohydrate contents. RESULTS: The total lipid contents (dry weight) were 36. 3 and 35. 4 g kg(- 1); fatty acid contents were 9. 3 and 12. 1 g kg(- 1); total nitrogen contents were 37. 4 and 24. 9 g kg(- 1); protein contents were 157. 2 and 101. 0 g kg(- 1); amino acid contents were 127. 5 and 91. 4 g kg(- 1); and total carbohydrate contents were 520. 3 and 450. 7 g kg(- 1) for P. brasiliense and O. secundiramea, respectively.

40|$|Abstract Use of {{the term}} 'umami' for the fifth basic taste and for {{describing}} the sensation of deliciousness is finding its way into Western cuisine. The unique molecular mechanism behind umami sensation is now partly understood as an allosteric action of glutamate and certain 5 '-ribonucleotides on the umami receptors. Chefs have started using this understanding to create dishes with delicious taste by adding old and new ingredients that enhance umami. In this paper, we take as our starting point the traditional Japanese soup broth dashi as the 'mother' of umami and demonstrate how dashi can be prepared from local, Nordic seaweeds, in particular the large brown seaweed sugar kelp (Saccharina latissima) and the red seaweed dulse (<b>Palmaria</b> <b>palmata),</b> possibly combined with bacon, chicken meat or dried mushrooms to provide synergy in the umami taste. Optimal conditions are determined for dashi extraction from these seaweeds, and the corresponding glutamate, aspartate and alaninate contents are determined quantitatively and compared with Japanese dashi extracted from the brown seaweed konbu (Saccharina japonica).

The increase was largest in samples boiled for 15 and 30 min. No deterioration of single amino acids was seen, and hence, the amount of available essential amino acids was increased accordingly. In A. esculenta, no equivalent changes were observed. In conclusion, a short heat treatment may be a simple way of increasing the utilization potential of seaweed proteins in food and feed. However, there are species differences, and the effects observed in the in vitro digestion model need to be confirmed in clinical studies...|$|E
40|$|Antiproliferative and {{antioxidant}} {{activities and}} mycosporine-like amino acid (MAA) profiles of methanol extracts from edible wild-harvested (Chondrus crispus, Mastocarpus stellatus, <b>Palmaria</b> <b>palmata)</b> and cultivated (C. crispus) marine red macroalgae were studied herein. Palythine, asterina- 330, shinorine, palythinol, porphyra- 334 and usujirene MAAs {{were identified in}} the macroalgal extracts by LC/MS/MS. Extract reducing activity rankings were (p cultivated C. crispus = wild M. stellatus > wild low-UV C. crispus > wild high-UV C. crispus; whereas oxygen radical absorbance capacities were (p wild P. palmata > cultivated C. crispus > wild low-UV C. crispus > wild high-UV C. crispus. Extracts were antiproliferative against HeLa and U- 937 cells (p < 0. 001) from 0. 125 – 4 mg/mL, 24 h. Wild P. palmata and cultivated C. crispus extracts increased (p < 0. 001) HeLa caspase- 3 / 7 activities {{and the proportion of}} cells arrested at Sub G 1 (apoptotic) compared to wild-harvested C. crispus and M. stellatus extracts. HeLa cells incubated with wild P. palmata and cultivated C. crispus extracts also exhibited morphological changes characteristic of apoptosis (shrinkage, rounding). Thus, extracts rich in low-polarity usujirene and polar palythine and asterina- 330 MAAs were antiproliferative as inducers of apoptosis in HeLa cells...|$|E
40|$|In this study, {{the ability}} of red alga (<b>Palmaria</b> <b>palmata)</b> and beer draff (brewery waste) for Cu(II) removal was investigated. The {{influence}} of factors, such as pH, initial copper concentrations, and contact time, were also studied. Results showed the adsorption process was strongly dependent on the pH value and initial concentration. The optimum pH value was {{in the range of}} 5 - 6. The Langmuir isotherm model performed better than other models, suggesting monolayer adsorption prevailed in the adsorption process. The theoretical adsorption capacities for Cu(II) were 12. 7 mg/g and 9. 01 mg/g for red alga and beer draff, respectively. The spectroscopy analyses and desorption studies showed that chemical bonding was the main mechanism in the adsorption process rather than ion exchange. The functional groups of amino, hydroxyl, carboxyl, phenolic hydroxyl, sulphonic group and C–O, –NH stretch might be involved in adsorption. After adsorption, both materials were successfully regenerated by nitric acid at a concentration of 10 mmol/L. Furthermore, the phenomenon that only 7 % of adsorbed Cu(II) on red alga and 11 % on beer draff were desorbed by sodium chloride solution suggested potential alternative of both materials for the treatment of road runoff containing considerable amounts of de-icing salt...|$|E
40|$|Life {{histories}} in the Florideophyceae, Rhodophyta, {{are classified}} into eleven types: I (the ancestral type), II (the isomorphic type), III (the heteromorphic type), IV (the Lemanea mamillosa type), V (the Mastocarpus papillatus type), VI (the Liagora tetrasporifera type), VII (the Rhodophysema elegans type), VIII (The Audouinella purpurea type), IX (the <b>Palmaria</b> <b>palmata</b> type), X (the Hildenbrandia proto(ypus type), and XI (the Audouinella pectinata type). The evolutionary paths from the ancestral type (type I) to type V through type II, type III and type IV (A course), to type VII through type III and type VI (B course), to type X through type III, type VI, type VIII and type IX (C course), and to type XI through type II (D course) {{in the existing}} algae are discussed. No close relationship in the life history has been found between phylogenetic orders in the class. The order Nemaliales, the most primitive order, has eight types of life history, being very variable {{in the evolution of}} life history, while the orders Rhodymeniales and Ceramiales, which have each two types, are in an evolutionally stable position. Some species in the class have two types oflife history: in addition to primitive types (type II and type III) apomictic type (V), non-carposporophyte type (IX) and sporophytic type (type X) are known...|$|E
40|$|This is the {{accepted}} manuscript version. Published version available at [URL] Bioaccessibility of plant proteins {{has been shown}} to be inferior to that of proteins of animal origin. Heat treatment {{has been shown to}} positively affect this in some plants. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of heat treatment on bioaccessibility of seaweed proteins. An in vitro gastrointestinal digestion model was used for evaluation of potential effects on the brown seaweed Alaria esculenta and the red seaweed <b>Palmaria</b> <b>palmata</b> proteins. In P. palmata, the content of accessible amino acids increased by 86 – 109 % after heat treatment.

40|$|Macroalgae (seaweeds) are a {{promising}} feedstock {{for the production}} of third generation bioethanol, since they have high carbohydrate contents, contain little or no lignin and are available in abundance. However, seaweeds typically contain a more diverse array of monomeric sugars than are commonly present in feedstocks derived from lignocellulosic material which are currently used for bioethanol production. Hence, identification of a suitable fermentative microorganism that can utilise the principal sugars released from the hydrolysis of macroalgae remains a major objective. The present study used a phenotypic microarray technique to screen 24 different yeast strains for their ability to metabolise individual monosaccharides commonly found in seaweeds, as well as hydrolysates following an acid pre-treatment of five native UK seaweed species (Laminaria digitata, Fucus serratus, Chondrus crispus, <b>Palmaria</b> <b>palmata</b> and Ulva lactuca). Five strains of yeast (three Saccharomyces spp, one Pichia sp and one Candida sp) were selected and subsequently evaluated for bioethanol production during fermentation of the hydrolysates. Four out of the five selected strains converted these monomeric sugars into bioethanol, with the highest ethanol yield (13 g L− 1) resulting from a fermentation using C. crispus hydrolysate with Saccharomyces cerevisiae YPS 128. This study demonstrated the novel application of a phenotypic microarray technique to screen for yeast capable of metabolising sugars present in seaweed hydrolysates; however, metabolic activity did not always imply fermentative production of ethanol...|$|E
