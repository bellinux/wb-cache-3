5|$|Helped by his schoolfriend Cammarotta-AdornoIn, Coandă {{started to}} build his slender {{sesquiplane}} and the unusual <b>powerplant</b> in a workshop {{in the courtyard of}} his house where he tested the thrust of the <b>powerplant</b> on a dynamometer, tests which are described in detail in the April 1910 edition of La Technique Aéronautique. He filed for several patents for the mechanism and aircraft on 30 May 1910, with later additions to the existing patents.|$|E
5|$|Each engine {{had its own}} {{intake and}} the engine {{nacelles}} were paired with a splitter plate between them to minimise adverse behaviour of one <b>powerplant</b> influencing the other. Only above Mach 1.6 was an engine surge likely to affect the adjacent engine.|$|E
5|$|Introduced a new {{six-speed}} {{automatic transmission}} and revised styling. The <b>powerplant</b> {{remained the same}} as before. Exterior changes included restyled front and rear fascias, light-emitting diode (LED) taillights, and different wheels.|$|E
40|$|Mobile nuclear <b>powerplants</b> for {{applications}} other than large ships and submarines will require compact, lightweight reactors with especially stringent impact-safety design. The technical and economic feasibility that the broadening role of civilian nuclear power, in general, (land-based nuclear electric generating plants and nuclear ships) can extend to lightweight, safe mobile nuclear <b>powerplants</b> are examined. The paper discusses technical experience, identifies {{potential sources of}} technology for advanced concepts, cites the results of economic studies of mobile nuclear <b>powerplants,</b> and surveys future technical capabilities needed by examining the current use and projected needs for vehicles, machines, and habitats that could effectively use mobile nuclear reactor <b>powerplants...</b>|$|R

5|$|A Spanish-built {{version of}} the Messerschmitt Bf 109 G-2, the 1954 Hispano Aviación HA-1112-M1L Buchon, was built in Hispano's factory in Seville with the Rolls-Royce Merlin 500/45 engine of – a fitting <b>powerplant</b> for the last-produced {{version of the}} famous Messerschmitt fighter, as the Bf 109 V1 {{prototype}} aircraft had been powered by the Rolls-Royce Kestrel V-12 engine in 1935.|$|E
5|$|Coandă and his 1910 {{aircraft}} {{were absent}} from much of aviation {{literature of the}} day. None of the annual issues of Jane's All the World's Aircraft ever mentioned the Coandă-1910 or its turbo-propulseur <b>powerplant.</b> The Soviet engineer Nikolai Rynin {{made no mention of}} Coandă in his exhaustive nine-volume encyclopaedia on jet and rocket engines, written in the late 1920s and early '30s.|$|E
5|$|Concorde {{needed to}} fly long {{distances}} to be economically viable; this required high efficiency from the <b>powerplant.</b> Turbofan engines were rejected {{due to their}} larger cross-section producing excessive drag. Olympus turbojet technology was available to be developed to meet the design requirements of the aircraft, although turbofans would be studied for any future SST.|$|E

5|$|Construction {{problems}} with her <b>powerplant</b> kept her initial service relatively brief and inactive. Assigned to duty with North Atlantic Blockading Squadron, Dictator cruised on the Atlantic coast from 15 December 1864 until placed {{out of commission}} on 5 September 1865 at the League Island Navy Yard. She remained in ordinary there until 1869.|$|E
5|$|Production of the Heinkel {{continued}} {{after the}} war as the Spanish-built CASA 2.111. Spain received a batch of He 111H-16s in 1943 along with an agreement to licence-build Spanish versions. Its airframe was produced in Spain under licence by Construcciones Aeronáuticas SA. The design differed significantly in <b>powerplant</b> only, eventually being equipped with Rolls-Royce Merlin engines. The Heinkel's descendant continued in service until 1973.|$|E
5|$|Three {{individual}} models, or grades, {{were available}} on the car's release in 2006; S, M, and G, in ascending order of price. They all shared the same five-door hatchback body style and turbocharged engine, but offered differing levels of options and standard equipment. In 2007 the base S model was given the new naturally aspirated <b>powerplant,</b> and was positioned below the two new grades, L and LX, whose engine it shared.|$|E

5|$|A {{week after}} taking command, Moosally and his {{executive}} officer, Mike Fahey, canceled a planned $1million repair package for Iowas main gun batteries, including repairs {{to the main}} gun turrets' lighting, electrical, powder hoists, and hydraulic systems—75 detailed deficiencies in all. Instead, the funds were spent on overhauling the ship's <b>powerplant.</b> In August 1988, Iowa set sail on sea trials around the Chesapeake Bay area and then began refresher training in the waters around Florida and Puerto Rico in October.|$|E
5|$|After {{launching}} the -200 with Pratt & Whitney JT9D-7 engines, on August1, 1972 Boeing {{announced that it}} had reached an agreement with General Electric to certify the 747 with CF6-50 series engines to increase the aircraft's market potential. Rolls-Royce followed 747 engine production with a launch order from British Airways for four aircraft. The option of RB211-524B engines was announced on June 17, 1975. The -200 was the first 747 to provide a choice of <b>powerplant</b> from the three major engine manufacturers.|$|E
5|$|In late 1937, the D-1 series entered production. However, the DB 600Ga engine with 781kW (1,047hp) {{planned for}} this variant was instead {{allocated}} to Messerschmitt Bf 109 and Bf 110 production lines. Heinkel then opted to use Junkers Jumo engines, and the He 111 V6 was tested with Jumo 210 G engines, but was judged underpowered. However, the improved 745kW (999hp) Jumo 211 A-1 <b>powerplant</b> prompted {{the cancellation of}} the D series altogether and concentration {{on the design of}} the E series.|$|E
50|$|V6 {{engines are}} popular <b>powerplants</b> in medium to large {{outboard}} motors.|$|R
5|$|A general problem {{existed in}} <b>powerplants.</b> The He 111 was {{equipped}} with BMW VI glycol-cooled engines. The German aviation industry lacked <b>powerplants</b> that could produce more than 600 hp. Engines of suitable quality were kept for military use, frustrating German airline Luft Hansa and forcing it {{to rely on the}} BMW VI or 132s.|$|R

5|$|In the {{meantime}} the horizontal stabilizer {{of the second}} prototype was strengthened and it resumed flying on 20 July. The pilot complained of excess torque pull to the right so the vertical stabilizer was enlarged by , but this {{was just one of}} numerous problems, and it was not ready to pass State acceptance trials without more development work on the <b>powerplant.</b> However, the second prototype continued flight testing until 12 July 1946 when an engine fire forced an emergency landing and it was damaged beyond repair.|$|E
5|$|Starting in 1929, Hiei was {{converted}} to a gunnery training ship to avoid being scrapped {{under the terms of}} the Washington Naval Treaty. She served as Emperor Hirohito's transport in the mid-1930s. Starting in 1937, she underwent a full-scale reconstruction that completely rebuilt her superstructure, upgraded her <b>powerplant,</b> and equipped her with launch catapults for floatplanes. Now fast enough to accompany Japan's growing fleet of aircraft carriers, she was reclassified as a fast battleship. On the eve of the US entry into World War II, she sailed as part of Vice-Admiral Chuichi Nagumo's Combined Fleet, escorting the six carriers that attacked Pearl Harbor on 7December 1941.|$|E
5|$|The E-1 variant with Jumo 211A-1 engines was {{developed}} in 1937, the He 111 V6 being the first production variant. The E-1 had its original <b>powerplant,</b> the DB 600 replaced with the Jumo 210 Ga engines. The more powerful Jumo 211 A-1 engines desired by the Ministry of Aviation were not yet ready for installation. Another trial aircraft, He 111 V10 (D-ALEQ) was to be fitted with two oil coolers necessary for the Jumo 211 A-1 installation.|$|E

5|$|The I-5 was {{involved}} in tests of the Zveno project where a Tupolev TB-3 heavy bomber carried three I-5s as parasite fighters. One I-5 was carried was on each wing and a third over the fuselage. Ramps were used to get the wing-mounted aircraft to their places, but the fuselage-mounted aircraft had to be lifted by hand. This was so cumbersome that they were generally used solely as an extra <b>powerplant</b> for the TB-3 later in the program. The aircraft used in these trials used the longer landing gear with smaller tires originally used in the prototypes.|$|E
5|$|There {{were several}} {{attempts}} to re-engine the aircraft {{with the engine}} it was originally designed for, the Mikulin AM-37. This was designated the MiG-7, and one MiG-3 was converted to evaluate the engine in May 1941. It proved to have poor longitudinal stability and the <b>powerplant</b> itself still {{had a number of}} problems. The German invasion the following month caused the cancellation of the development of the AM-37 as Mikulin's resources were required for the AM-35 and AM-38 engines already in production.|$|E
5|$|AMX-30 {{production}} {{occurred at}} the Atelier de Construction de Roanne {{in the town of}} Roanne. This heavy manufacturing factory was built during World War I to produce artillery shells, although by 1952 the factory had begun producing armoured fighting vehicles. Before producing the AMX-30, for example, it had made 1,900 AMX-13s and variants. The Roanne factory was responsible for final assembly, most components were made elsewhere: the <b>powerplant</b> by the Atelier de Construction de Limoges, the full armour set by the Ateliers et Forges de la Loire, the turret by the Atelier de Construction de Tarbes, the cannon by the Atelier de Construction de Bourges, the cupola and machine-gun by the Manufacture d'Armes de Saint-Étienne and the optics by the Atelier de Construction de Puteaux; all these again used many subcontractors. In a series of corporate mergers under state guidance, most of these firms would eventually be concentrated into GIAT.|$|E
50|$|In {{environmental}} impact, {{results are}} mixed. With {{the ability to}} invest profits to satisfy further energy demand, producers like TXU are proposing eleven new coal-fired <b>powerplants.</b> Coal <b>powerplants</b> are cheaper than natural gas-fired <b>powerplants,</b> but produce more pollution. When the private equity firms Kohlberg Kravis Roberts and the Texas Pacific Group announced the take-over of TXU, the company which was known for charging the highest rates {{in the state and}} were losing customers, they called off plans for eight of the coal plants. TXU had invested more heavily in the other three. A few weeks later the buyers announced plans for two cleaner IGCC coal plants.|$|R
50|$|The Alcotán project stalled, due to {{problems}} in the supply of <b>powerplants</b> and propellers. Spain's domestic engine industry was not capable of producing <b>powerplants</b> in sufficient quantity for the project, and Spain was unable to afford to import foreign engines. The production run {{had been scheduled to}} be completed before 1955, but the shortage of engines meant that by 1956, only eleven complete aircraft had been finished and delivered. In 1962, the project was finally cancelled, without the engine problem ever having been resolved. By then, CASA had 96 complete airframes in storage awaiting <b>powerplants.</b> Those were scrapped, and the Spanish government compensated the manufacturer for the debacle.|$|R
50|$|The {{company also}} {{supplies}} engines for marine use, and dual fuel engines for <b>powerplants.</b>|$|R
