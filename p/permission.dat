5|$|ScottishPower Renewables {{also have}} <b>permission</b> to build 13 wind {{turbines}} near the aluminium smelter. They were initially refused planning <b>permission,</b> which they submitted in November 2006. This was because their site is spread over two council boundaries and Wansbeck Council approved the scheme, but Castle Morpeth refused. An appeal hearing {{was given in}} April 2008, and <b>permission</b> was eventually granted in January 2009 {{for the construction of}} up to 13 turbines, producing 30MW of electricity.|$|E

5000|$|The Security <b>permissions</b> user {{interface}} is improved over Windows 2000. A new property sheet called Effective <b>Permissions</b> evaluates implicit <b>permissions</b> against explicit <b>permissions</b> and assigned <b>permissions</b> against inherited <b>permissions.</b> When setting object <b>permissions,</b> the user names, groups and security principals can be searched on the domain by specific criteria.|$|R
50|$|TeamSpeak 3 {{also has}} a 5-tier {{hierarchy}} within its <b>permissions</b> system: Server Group, Client <b>Permissions,</b> Channel <b>Permissions,</b> Channel Groups and Channel Client <b>Permissions.</b> The five are used to override another type, also known as inheriting. This allows for highly complex <b>permissions</b> for users, giving users more powers and uses in TeamSpeak without giving away complete control to the users of the server.|$|R
5000|$|With {{the release}} of later {{versions}} the TeamSpeak developers created easier ways to set up <b>permissions</b> {{in the way of}} a [...] "Standard <b>Permissions</b> Display" [...] by default in the client. This placed the original <b>permissions</b> system display behind the [...] "Standard" [...] one calling it [...] "Advanced <b>Permissions</b> Display". This allowed beginners more ease of use when setting up a TeamSpeak 3 server. Some still prefer the Advanced system because it allows more control over which <b>permissions</b> get changed, whereas the Standard changes many <b>permissions</b> at the same time.|$|R

40|$|Role mining {{from the}} {{existing}} <b>permissions</b> has been widely applied to aid the process of migrating to an RBAC system. While all <b>permissions</b> are treated evenly in previous approaches, none of the work has employed the weights of <b>permissions</b> in role mining to our knowledge, thus providing the motivation for this work. In this paper, we generalize this to the case where <b>permissions</b> are given weights to reflect their importance to the system. The weights can correspond to the property of operations, the sensitive degree of objects, and the attribute of users associated with <b>permissions.</b> To calculate the weight of <b>permissions,</b> we introduce the concept of similarity between both users and <b>permissions,</b> and use a similarity matrix to reinforce the similarity between <b>permissions.</b> Then we create {{a link between the}} reinforced similarity and the weight of <b>permissions.</b> We further propose a weighted role mining algorithm to generate roles based on weights. Experiments on performance study prove the superiority of the new algorithm...|$|R

40|$|Fractional <b>Permissions</b> are {{a popular}} {{approach}} to reasoning about programs that use shared-memory concurrency, {{because they provide}} a way of proving data race freedom while permitting concurrent read access. However, specification using fractional <b>permissions</b> typically requires the user to pick concrete mathematical values for partial <b>permissions,</b> making specifications overly low-level, tedious to write, and harder to adapt and re-use. This paper introduces abstract read <b>permissions,</b> a flexible and expressive specification methodology that supports fractional <b>permissions</b> while allowing the user {{to work at the}} abstract level of read and write <b>permissions.</b> The methodology is flexible, modular, and sound.

Additionally, the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation and United States Army Corps of Engineers (CoE) was supposed to give NYC Ferry <b>permission</b> to use of the landings, with the United States Coast Guard advising the CoE's approval of a permit as well as monitoring the design of vessels. In addition, the New York State Office of Parks, Recreation and Historic Preservation had to allow ferries to use the landing at Gantry Plaza State Park, and the Roosevelt Island Operating Corporation was consulted so they could give <b>permission</b> for the Roosevelt Island landing to be built. By September 2016, the Gantry Plaza landing had been approved.|$|E

5|$|In 1979, Swiss {{publisher}} Faksimile-Verlag Luzern requested <b>permission</b> {{to produce}} a full-colour facsimile of the book. <b>Permission</b> was initially denied, because Trinity College officials felt {{that the risk of}} damage to the book was too high. By 1986, Faksimile-Verlag had developed a process that used gentle suction to straighten a page so that it could be photographed without touching it and so won <b>permission</b> to publish a new facsimile. After each page was photographed, a single-page facsimile was prepared so the colours could be carefully compared to the original and adjustments made where necessary.

5000|$|Role based access {{controls}} (RBAC) simplify routine account management operations and facilitate security audits.
