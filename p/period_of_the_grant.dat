5000|$|Following {{the award}} in 2013 [...] and 2014 [...] of $4.5m in {{grants from the}} Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, the company {{developed}} an online tool called the Open Research Exchange (ORE) that allowed for the rapid creation, prototyping, testing, and validation of patient reported outcome measures, questionnaires that can establish the impact of symptoms and disease on patients. During the <b>period</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>grant,</b> a number of academic collaborators were invited to develop measures on the platform including measures of treatment burden, hypertension management, feelings of satiety in diabetes and treatment burden in chronic illness. The tool offers researchers the ability to rapidly get input from large numbers of patients {{in a matter of}} weeks or months [...] as opposed to much slower forms of research which can take years to complete. A number of tools such as the Treatment Burden Questionnaire [...] and the Suicide Ideation and Behavior Assessment Tool (SIBAT) have been published in the scientific literature for use by researchers and an editorial co-authored with industry leaders and a researcher at the FDA outlined ways in which PROs developed on the ORE could be used for the development of new medicines. In addition to the traditional scientist-lead instruments, one instrument was developed by a person living with MS.
