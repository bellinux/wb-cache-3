5|$|There are two {{principal}} damage mechanisms {{to the inner}} ear in industrialised society, and both injure hair cells. The first is exposure to elevated sound levels (noise trauma), {{and the second is}} exposure to drugs and other substances (ototoxicity). A large number of people are exposed to sound levels on a daily basis that are likely to lead to significant hearing loss. The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health has recently published research on the estimated numbers of persons with hearing difficulty (11%) and the <b>percentage</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> that can be attributed to occupational noise exposure (24%). Furthermore, according to the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES), approximately twenty-two million (17%) US workers reported exposure to hazardous workplace noise. Workers exposed to hazardous noise further exacerbate the potential for developing noise-induced hearing loss when they do not wear hearing protection.|$|E
5|$|A {{study with}} an intent-to-treat {{prospective}} design {{was published in}} 1998 by a team from the Johns Hopkins Hospital and followed-up by a report published in 2001. As with most studies of the ketogenic diet, there was no control group (patients who did not receive the treatment). The study enrolled 150 children. After three months, 83% of them {{were still on the}} diet, 26% had experienced a good reduction in seizures, 31% had had an excellent reduction and 3% were seizure-free. At twelve months, 55% were still on the diet, 23% had a good response, 20% had an excellent response and 7% were seizure-free. Those who had discontinued the diet by this stage did so because it was ineffective, too restrictive or due to illness, and most of those who remained were benefiting from it. The <b>percentage</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> still on the diet at two, three and four years was 39%, 20% and 12% respectively. During this period the most common reason for discontinuing the diet was because the children had become seizure-free or significantly better. At four years, 16% of the original 150 children had a good reduction in seizure frequency, 14% had an excellent reduction and 13% were seizure-free, though these figures include many who were no longer on the diet. Those remaining on the diet after this duration were typically not seizure-free but had had an excellent response.|$|E

25|$|Since {{there are}} {{more men than women}} for a limited number of jobs, more men, in {{absolute}} terms, are excluded from formal employment. Consequently, the ratio of female to male workers increases because women represent a larger <b>percentage</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> who work than they represent the entire labor force. Therefore, women would have a relatively higher ratio of female to male workers than its female labor force participation rate may suggest. The sheer size of the male component of the workforce may be sufficient to create a small ratio of female to male workers.|$|E

We pay particular attention to the <b>percentages</b> <b>of</b> the sample re-interviewed following household splits, and assess the implications of these on the suitability of the EU- SILC for longitudinal analysis of the effects of household splits. Using longitudinal data from the 2003 to 2010 UDBs, we find considerable variations in practice across the countries of the EU-SILC. Among households experiencing a split, large <b>percentages</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> remaining in the original sample household are followed, but only very low <b>percentages</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> moving to a split-off household. While this does not {{have a major impact on}} overall attrition rates, it does mean that the EU-SILC may not be suitable for longitudinal analysis of specific groups. Analysis of individuals leaving the family home following divorce or separation is particularly problematic, while analysis of young home-leavers is possible in a number of countries, though it should be undertaken with caution...|$|R
25|$|Until the mid1960s, {{fishing was}} {{perceived}} as Lowestoft's main industry, although from the 1930s the <b>percentage</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> employed directly and in trades associated with fishing was actually only about 10 per cent of the working population. Fleets of drifters and trawlers caught fish such as herring, cod and plaice. Catches have diminished since the 1960s and, although by the 1980s 100 boats remained, there are now only a few small boats operating out of Lowestoft, with no large trawlers. By 2011 just three traders remained at the town's fish market which is under threat of closure due to the redevelopment of the port.

25|$|In the 2001 census 71.6% of all {{respondents}} indicated that they were Christians, with the next largest faiths being Islam (2.8%), Hinduism (1.0%), Sikhism (0.6%), Judaism (0.5%), Buddhism (0.3%) and all other religions (0.3%). 15% of respondents stated that they had no religion, with a further 7% not stating a religious preference. A Tearfund survey in 2007 showed only one in ten Britons actually attend church weekly. Between the 2001 and 2011 census there was a decrease in the amount of people who identified as Christian by 12%, whilst the <b>percentage</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> reporting no religious affiliation doubled.

25|$|During {{certain parts}} of the Amidah said on Rosh Hashana and Yom Kippur, Ashkenazi Jews {{traditionally}} go down to the floor upon their knees and make their upper body bowed over like an arch, similar to Muslims, though not exactly in the same manner. There are some variations in Ashkenazi customs as to how long one remains in this position. Some Jews among the Dor Daim and Talmidhe haRambam understand both the Mishneh Torah and the Talmudic source texts concerning bowing in the Shemoneh Esreh to be teaching that one must always prostrate, lying flat on the ground, not only during the High Holy Days, but throughout the year during the four bows of the Amidah. It is hard to know the <b>percentage</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> who hold by the latter view, the likelihood being that most who accept such a view usually only do so in private or when praying among like-minded people.|$|E

25|$|A 2005 review {{determined}} that some, but not all, randomized controlled {{studies have found}} that AAS use correlates with hypomania and increased aggressiveness, but pointed out that attempts to determine whether AAS use triggers violent behavior have failed, primarily because of high rates of non-participation. A 2008 study on a nationally representative sample of young adult males in the United States found an association between lifetime and past-year self-reported AAS use and involvement in violent acts. Compared with individuals that did not use steroids, young adult males that used AAS reported greater involvement in violent behaviors even after controlling for the effects of key demographic variables, previous violent behavior, and polydrug use. A 1996 review examining the blind studies available at that time also found that these had demonstrated a link between aggression and steroid use, but pointed out that with estimates of over one million past or current steroid users in the United States at that time, an extremely small <b>percentage</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> using steroids appear to have experienced mental disturbance severe enough to result in clinical treatments or medical case reports.|$|E
25|$|While in the wild, dung {{constitutes}} {{a majority of}} the nutritional intake used for sexual development in both male and female adults within this species, but diets consisting of higher protein contents will better facilitate mating conditions of both sexes. Female sexual maturity requires the completion of 10 stages of follicle development in the ovaries to produce eggs that are completely mature, and ovaries in females which have been deprived of a high-protein diet will not develop fully. Although it is possible for females on a diet of only dung to reach the final stage of sexual maturity, it takes much more time than if they were to feed exclusively on beef liver; even then, a lower <b>percentage</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> feeding on dung will have fully developed. For instance, an experiment by Stoffolano showed that 100% of females feeding exclusively on beef liver were able to reach the final stage of sexual development after 13 days, while only 78% of females were able to do so when feeding exclusively on pig dung over a 20-day period. Although some dipteran species will oviposit on dung, P. regina oviposits exclusively on carrion.|$|E
25|$|Research on {{alcoholism}} within families has leaned towards exploring {{issues that}} are wrong in the community rather than potential strengths or positives. When researchers conduct research that helps communities, it can be easier for community members {{to identify with the}} positives and work towards a path of resilience. Flawed research design in adult children of alcoholics (ACOA) research showed ACOAs were psychologically damaged. Some flawed research designs include using ACOAs as part of the control group and comparing them to other ACOAs within the same study. This may have caused some limitations in the study that were not listed. When comparing ACOAs to other ACOAs, it is difficult to interpret accurate results that show certain behaviors in the group studied. Research that has been conducted more recently has used control groups with non-ACOAs to see whether the behaviors align with prior research. This research has shown that behaviors were similar between non-ACOAs and ACOAs. An 18 year-long study compared children of alcoholics (COA) to other COAs. In failing to use non-COAs as controls, we miss an opportunity to see if the negative aspects of a person are related to having an alcoholic parent, or are they just simply a fact of life. For example, in Werner’s study, he found that 30% of COAs were committing serious delinquencies. This data would have been more usable if they had viewed the <b>percentage</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> committing crimes when compared to non-ACOAs. In a study conducted in a midwestern university, researchers found that {{there was no significant difference}} between ACOA and non-ACOA students. One of the main differences was the student’s views on how they connect their past experiences with their current social-emotional functioning. Students who were ACOAs did not demonstrate issues with their perspective on their interpersonal issues any more than the non-ACA students. However, this study did show that there were other underlying problems in the family structure that may attribute to the perception of not being well adjusted in life.|$|E

The subjects comprised all 1701 individuals aged 40 years or older living in a village in Nara Prefecture. We distributed a self-administered questionnaire that included questions on oral health behavior, lifestyle (eating, drinking, smoking, exercise behaviors), current health conditions, and the TMIG index as an index of higher-level functional capacity. A total of 1543 individuals (mean age, 64. 9 years) who submitted the questionnaire were categorized into four groups: A group (good lifestyle ≧ 3 items and toothbrushing ≧ 2 times a day), B group (good lifestyle ≧ 3 items and toothbrushing < 2 times a day), C group (good lifestyle < 3 items and toothbrushing ≧ 2 times a day), and D group (good lifestyle < 3 items and toothbrushing < 2 times a day).
