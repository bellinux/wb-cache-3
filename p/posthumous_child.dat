5|$|After Charles's death, {{the former}} Austrian {{imperial}} family were soon to move again. Alfonso XIII of Spain had approached the British Foreign Office via his ambassador in London, and {{they agreed to}} allow Zita and her seven (soon to be eight) children to relocate to Spain. Alfonso duly sent the warship Infanta Isabel to Funchal and this took them to Cadiz. They were then escorted to the Pardo Palace in Madrid, where shortly after her arrival Zita {{gave birth to a}} <b>posthumous</b> <b>child,</b> Archduchess Elisabeth. Alfonso XIII offered his exiled Habsburg relatives the use of Palacio Uribarren at Lekeitio in the Bay of Biscay. This appealed to Zita, {{who did not want to}} be a heavy burden to the state that harboured her. For the next six years Zita settled in Lekeitio, where she got on with the job of raising and educating her children. They lived with straitened finances, mainly living on income from private property in Austria, income from a vineyard in Johannisberg, and voluntary collections. Other members of the exiled Habsburg dynasty, however, claimed much of this money, and there were regular petitions for help from former Imperial officials.|$|E

50|$|In the Middle Ages, it was {{traditional}} for <b>posthumous</b> <b>children</b> born in England to {{be given}} a matronymic surname instead of a patronymic one. This may in part explain why matronyms are more common in England than in other parts of Europe.|$|R
50|$|A posthumous birth {{has special}} {{significance}} {{in the case of}} hereditary monarchies following primogeniture. In this system, a monarch's own child precedes that monarch's sibling in the order of succession. In cases where the widow of a childless king is pregnant {{at the time of his}} death, the next-in-line is not permitted to assume the throne, but must yield place to the unborn child, or ascends and reigns until the child is born. In monarchies that follow male-preference cognatic primogeniture, the situation is similar where the dead monarch was not childless but left a daughter as the next-in-line, as well as a pregnant widow. A posthumous brother would supplant that daughter in the succession, whereas a posthumous sister, being younger, would not. Similarly, in monarchies that follow agnatic primogeniture, the sex of the unborn child determines the succession; a <b>posthumous</b> male <b>child</b> would himself succeed, whereas the next-in-line would succeed upon the birth of a <b>posthumous</b> female <b>child.</b>|$|R
50|$|At age 44, at the {{beginning}} of the novels, Aral meets and falls in love with the Betan Survey captain Cordelia Naismith. According to her analysis, she provides a “solution” to his bisexuality, being both a woman and a soldier (Barrayar, ch. 5, repeated in Mirror Dance, ch. 16). They marry and have a child, Miles, who is physically handicapped as a result of exposure to a teratogen. Count Piotr attempts both abortion and infanticide of this imperfect heir, and Aral becomes estranged from his father until Miles is able to walk, at about the age of 5. Aral and Cordelia are otherwise childless until, in Mirror Dance, they discover Mark, a clone of Miles created when Miles was about six years old. They acknowledge Mark as their son and, for a short time when Miles is MIA, the heir to the title of Count. By the time Aral dies, around 83 years old, he has four grandchildren, all Miles's children (Cryoburn). After Aral's death, Cordelia uses x-chromosomes from his frozen sperm, along with her own eggs and, for boys, sperm from Admiral Jole, to create as many as eight <b>posthumous</b> <b>children</b> (Gentleman Jole and the Red Queen).|$|R
25|$|Following {{the death}} of Sir Khanderao Gaekwad (1828–1870), the popular Maharaja of Baroda, in 1870, it was {{expected}} that his brother, Malharrao (1831–1882), would succeed him. However, Malharrao had already proven himself to be of the vilest character and had been imprisoned earlier for conspiring to assassinate Khanderao. As Khanderao's widow, Maharani Jamnabai (1853–1898) was already pregnant with a <b>posthumous</b> <b>child,</b> the succession was delayed until the gender of the child could be proven. The child proved to be a daughter, and so upon her birth on 5 July 1871, Malharrao ascended the throne.|$|E
25|$|Four months {{pregnant}} {{at the time}} of her husband's death, Aspasia withdrew to the Diadochos Palace at Athens. In Greece, the unexpected death of Alexander I had much more serious consequences: it raised the question of succession and even the survival of the monarchy. Because the King had married without his father's or the head of Orthodox Church's permission, it was technically illegal, the marriage void, and the couple's <b>posthumous</b> <b>child</b> illegitimate according to law. Maintaining the monarchy therefore involved finding another sovereign and, as the Venizelists still oppose Constantine I and Diadochos George, the government decided to offer the crown to another member of the Royal Family, the young Prince Paul. However, he refused to ascend the throne, which remained resolutely vacant.|$|E

Originally, Minulescu was meant to be born in Slatina, but bad weather prevented his mother from leaving the capital city. Adopted by Ion Constantinescu, a Romanian Army officer who married Alexandrina Ciucă, he lived much of his childhood in Slatina and completed his primary and most of his medium studies in Piteşti at Ion Brătianu High School. He was a colleague of Al.

He went out very cheerfully with the half-dozen men told off for the purpose, evidently {{thinking}} {{that they were going to}} be the death of somebody unknown. But observing in the procession an empty wheelbarrow and a double-barrelled gun, he became meditative, and fixed the bearer of the gun with his eyes. A stone deftly thrown across him by the village blackguard (chief mourner) caused him to look round for an instant, and he then fell dead, shot through the heart. Two <b>posthumous</b> <b>children</b> are at this moment rolling on the lawn; one will evidently inherit his ferocity, and will probably inherit the gun.

But this proposal elicited little enthusiasm from the Holland regents, who still vividly remembered his role in the recent coup.|$|E
25|$|Princess Alexandra {{was born}} in a {{difficult}} environment. Five months before her birth, her father, King Alexander, died of sepsis following a monkey bite which occurred in the gardens of Tatoi. The unexpected death of the sovereign caused a serious political crisis in Greece, at a time when public opinion was already divided by the events of the World War I and the Greco-Turkish War. The King had concluded an unequal marriage with Aspasia Manos, and, in consequence, their offspring wasn't dynastic. Due to the lack of another candidate for the throne, Prime Minister Eleftherios Venizelos was soon forced to accept the restoration of his enemy, King Constantine I, on 19 December 1920. Alexander's brief reign was officially treated as a regency, which meant that his marriage, contracted without his father's permission, was technically illegal, the marriage void, and the couple's <b>posthumous</b> <b>child</b> illegitimate.|$|E

[...] However, it is unlikely that this was intended to allow Margaret to rule alone as queen regnant, but rather jointly with her future spouse, whoever he might be. While unexceptional in the circumstances, this would appear to show that Alexander III had decided on remarriage. He did remarry, to Yolande de Dreux, but died shortly afterwards as the result of an accident on 19 March 1286 without any children by her.|$|E
40|$|U radu se razmatra, na osnovi podataka zapisanih u matičnim knjigama vjenčanih, rođenih i umrlih, demografska struktura stanovništva mjesta Zmajevac u 18. stoljeću. Analiza podataka matice vjenčanih temelji se na identifikaciji mladenaca, godišnjoj i mjesečnoj raspodjeli vjenčanja, prosječnoj dobi i starosti zaručnika. Obrađeni podaci matice rođenih obuhvaćaju ukupan broj krštenih unutar promatranoga razdoblja, njihovu spolnu strukturu, broj blizanačkih trudnoća te broj posthumno i nezakonito rođene djece. Podacima dobivenim analizom zapisa matice umrlih prikazuje se godišnja i sezonska raspodjela umrlih, dob pokojnika te uzroci njihove smrti. Baranya was, {{after the}} liberation from Ottoman rule and the {{suppression}} of Francis II Rákóczy’s uprising in the 18 th century, exposed to various demographic changes – migrations, new immigrations and planned settlements of the population {{which led to the}} creation of a multiethnic and multinational environment. This trend was evident in particular settlements, such as Zmajevac in the 18 th century, within the Baranja “triangle”. The analysis of registers of marriages confirmed that the inhabitants of Zmajevac married at a relatively early age. The registration in the registers of marriages included names, marital status (youngster/widower, maiden/widow), age and place of origin. The number of marriages in Zmajevac during the 18 th century increased gradually. Remarriages due to the death of spouses were common. The data analysis of registers of births indicates that during the 18 th century more male than female children were born in Zmajevac. The children were registered according to name, surname, father’s and mother’s name and the date of baptism. In Zmajevac during the 18 th century 25 twins were born and one set of triplets. The register contains also the names of <b>posthumous</b> <b>children</b> and of children born out of wedlock. For illegitimate children usually only the mother’s name was registered while the father mostly remained unknown. The analysis of the register of deaths indicates that in Zmajevac more men than women died during the 18 th century. This could be explained by the high birth rate of male children compared to female. Most of the inhabitants died between the age 0 and 18, and only in rare cases did they attain old age. The majority of the population died of illnesses and epidemics; nevertheless there were cases of violent death. Taking into consideration all the analysed data of all three registers, the conclusion can be drawn that the population of Zmajevac during the 18 th century showed the characteristics of pre-transitional societies characterized by high birth, mortality and marriage rates...|$|R

40|$|The {{issue on}} which I will attempt to cast some light is {{certainly}} not novel. It has been ongoing for many years but the pace of scientific progress is gathering and the retreat of ethical barriers is relentless. I will illustrate my thesis by using examples of legal decisions {{from the realm of}} assisted human procreation and the <b>posthumous</b> conception of <b>children</b> from the sperm of deceased fathers e. g., the cases of Diane Blood, Parpalaix and Nikolas Coltan Evans. I will also highlight the recent case of Ashley X, a nine year old girl whose parents authorised radical medical treatment to arrest her development. I will argue that the law is being driven to roll back the ethical standards derived from our legacy of Natural Law by the imperatives of human rights e. g., the right to found a family, and the quest for patient autonomy. These are both admirable goals but fulfilling these goals comes at a cost to cherished ethical values e. g., that children are conceived by living fathers and that indulging the personal desires of every individual cannot forever be encompassed. As our legislators and courts chip away at our core network of ethical values, are they replacing them with equivalent values or do their decisions amount to a hollowing out of the core ethical values e. g., Thou shalt not kill and that human life is sacrosanct? Yet abortion is legal in many countries as is euthanasia. Paradoxically there is legislative protection for embryos by limiting experimentation on these clusters of cells. How do you construct a rational ethical framework with such blatant legal inconsistencies in the protection of human life? The sanctity of human life constitutes one of the fundamental pillars of ethical values which, in turn, support much more of the structure of ethics. Is a society that permits freezing the development of a nine year old child not a society whose ethics are so compromised that it is doomed to defend an ever diminishing mass of ethical values? Is there a core of ethics which is sacrosanct or is every ethical frontier fair game for invasion? Are the Ethics Committees, which approve and monitor research in the field of bioethics in Universities. Hospitals and laboratories failing in their duty as gatekeepers? They are after all the first line of defence for the survival of crucial ethical values. Can we continue to indulge the whims and needs of every individual under the guise of human rights or patient autonomy? Can a civilised society endure as such with an ever diminishing mass of ethical value...|$|R

Although an Englishman, he was fifteen before he re-visited his country, and then his glimpses of England were brief, and to him scarcely satisfactory. He was hurried sometimes to vast domains, which he heard were his own; and sometimes whisked to the huge metropolis, where he was shown St. Paul's and the British-Museum.

Hannah Smith married one Thomas Barton of Brigstock, and her daughter Catherine (whose name mysteriously is found as suing for the price of property sold to Charles II. for the site of the King's house at Winchester), lived with Sir Isaac Newton, was very beautiful, and much admired by Lord Halifax for her wit and gaiety. It was even reported that she was privately married to him, but this of course was mere scandal, and she became the wife of Jonathan Conduitt, educated at Trinity College, a friend and pupil of Newton, who had for many years assisted in the harder work of Master of the Mint, and wrote an essay on the gold and silver coinage of the realm.

6000|$|... 12. The Papacy at Avignon.--Clement {{had never}} quitted France, but {{had gone through}} the ceremonies of his {{installation}} at Lyons; and Philip, fearing that in Italy he would avoid carrying out the scheme for the ruin of the Templars, had him conducted to Avignon, a city of the Empire which belonged to the Angevin King of Naples, as Count of Provence, and there for eighty years the Papal court remained. As they were thus settled close to the French frontier, the Popes became almost vassals of France; and this added greatly to the power and renown of the French kings. How real their hold on the Papacy was, was shown in the ruin of the Templars. The order was now abandoned by the Pope, and its knights were invited in large numbers to Paris, under pretence of arranging a crusade. Having been thus entrapped, they were accused of horrible and monstrous crimes, and torture elicited a few supposed confessions. They were then tried by the Inquisition, and the greater number were put to death by fire, the Grand Master last of all, while their lands were seized by the king. They seem to have been really a fierce, arrogant, and oppressive set of men, or else there must have been some endeavour to save them, belonging, as most of them did, to noble French families. The [...] "Pest of France," [...] as Dante calls Philip the Fair, was now the most formidable prince in Europe. He contrived to annex to his dominions the city of Lyons, hitherto an imperial city under its archbishop. Philip died in 1314; and his three sons--Louis X., Philip V., and Charles IV.,--were as cruel and harsh as himself, but without his talent, and brought the crown and people to disgrace and misery. Each reigned a few years and then died, leaving only daughters, and the question arose whether the inheritance should go to females.
