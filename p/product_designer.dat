5|$|A {{fiberglass}} Space Race cabinet {{was designed}} for the game by Atari's <b>product</b> <b>designer,</b> George Faraco. The tall, angular cabinet, reminiscent of the fiberglass cabinet for Computer Space, {{was the first to}} display the Atari logo. The cabinet design was distinctive enough that Bushnell considered using it for Pong as well, but the production costs proved too high and only 50 units were made before the design was dropped and Space Race switched to a more traditional rectangular cabinet. The final cabinet stands nearly 5 feet tall and weighs over 200 pounds. Bushnell later stated that the molds to make the fiberglass cabinets cost US$2000 and could only make one per day due to the complicated shape, and Atari felt the cost did not justify buying enough molds to make a full production run in a reasonable amount of time. The final Space Race cabinet was reused later that same year for Pong Doubles, a four-player version of Pong.|$|E

Based on my professional career, I presumed three skills, they are, Technical skills, Conceptual skills and Human skills.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} is to {{identify}} the organizational and communication antecedents, and evaluate the consequences on relative product and service characteristics, of the use of service-sourced information by <b>product</b> <b>designers</b> during new <b>product</b> development. An empirical study of 121 product design managers demonstrates that a firm’s market orientation is improved by a healthy working relationship between <b>product</b> <b>designers</b> and service employees. Such a relationship motivates designers to use service-sourced information disseminated to them, enhancing both product and service characteristics of the new offering. The authors discuss how communication channels and information content affect the information use of <b>product</b> <b>designers.</b> <b>Product</b> <b>designers</b> value written information most. Information use does not relate to the frequency of receiving verbal or electronic information. Information about product ergonomics positively influences product designers’ perceptions of the information, whereas information on product aesthetics negatively influences their perceptions...|$|R
40|$|This book {{provides}} {{the reader with}} a comprehensive, relevant, and visually rich insight {{into the world of}} research methods specifically aimed at <b>product</b> <b>designers.</b> It includes practical case studies and tutorials that will inform, inspire and help you to conduct product design research better. <b>Product</b> <b>designers</b> need a comprehensive understanding of research methods as their day-to-day work routinely involves them observing people, asking questions, searching for information, making and testing ideas, and ultimately generating 'solutions' to 'problems'. Manifest in the design process is the act of research. Huge technological advances in information, computing and manufacturing processes also offer enormous opportunities to <b>product</b> <b>designers</b> such as the development of 'intelligent' products and services, {{but at the same time}} raise important research questions that need to be dealt with. <b>Product</b> <b>designers</b> are, in many ways, best placed to address these challenges because of the manner in which they apply their design thinking to problems. This book demonstrates in a clear, highly visual and structured fashion how research methods can support <b>product</b> <b>designers</b> and help them address the very real issues the world currently faces in the 21 st century...|$|R

500|$|The cabinet for {{the game}} was {{designed}} by Atari's <b>product</b> <b>designer,</b> George Faraco. His designed featured a joystick for each player, which was encased in a pink dome that the player would rest their hands on to control the joysticks, meant to resemble breasts. Faraco later acknowledged that [...] "they didn't have bumps on them or anything, but {{the way they were}} the size of grapefruits next to each other, you got the impression of what they were supposed to be." [...] Atari's second engineer, Don Lange, who assisted with the game, has also stated that the design was intentional on the part of Faraco, who fellow Atari designer Regan Chang has claimed [...] "had some really far out ideas". According to rumor, Faraco got the idea from a joke that joysticks resembled phalluses, and that Atari should make a game with female controls. Like Faraco's initial design for Space Race, which was changed due to its expense after a few dozen units, the joysticks for Gotcha were changed to standard ones shortly into the production run prior to the October 1973 release. The design did inspire the advertising flyer {{for the game}}, however, which features a man chasing a woman in a nightdress with the initial design of the cabinet behind them. The final cabinet stands over 5 feet tall and weighs nearly 200 pounds. The breast-like controllers reappeared in yellow in prototype versions of the 1974 Touch Me arcade game, but were not used in production.|$|E

2500|$|With {{this level}} of attention, some special design objects from the era have become sought-after {{collectors}} items also at auction, sometimes due to their association with the commission or commissioner, or the <b>product</b> <b>designer.</b> For example, a painted glass and metal table lamp by Bradley and Hubbard, (c. 1920) sold for USD$14,950, doubling its estimate, at Christie's auction house in New York in 1999. Later, a 14-inch, International Silver Company cocktail shaker (c. 1927) sold for USD$21,600 tripling its estimate, at Christie's in New York in 2005. A Parker gun made for a Russian czar before World War I, but never delivered, {{was reported to have}} been sold for USD$287,500 in 2007. In 2008, a rare Handel lamp sold for USD$85,000. On March 5–6, 2014 at Sotheby's in London, [...] "Al Capone's cocktail shaker" [...] made by the Meriden International Sterling Company (c. 1932) achieved over 33 times its estimate with a sale price of GBP50,000 (USD$83,250 on the day). Lastly, in 2014, at Sotheby's New York, a rare Paul Lobel-designed coffee service (c. 1934–35) produced by the Wilcox Silver Plate Co. / International Silver Company sold for USD$377,000.|$|E

In October 2009, Brenda Song, Rooney Mara, Armie Hammer, Shelby Young, and Josh Pence were cast. Max Minghella and Dakota Johnson were also confirmed to star in the film. In a 2009 interview with The Baltimore Sun, Eisenberg said, [...] "Even though I've gotten to be in some wonderful movies, this character seems so much more overtly insensitive in so many ways that seem more real to me in the best way. I don't often get cast as insensitive people, so it feels very comfortable: fresh and exciting, as if you {{never have to worry about}} the audience. Not that I worry about the audience anyway – it should be just the furthest thing from your mind. The Social Network is the biggest relief I've ever had in a movie".|$|E
2500|$|Task Review: Helene and Alex's {{team went}} with a brand called DUAL, which {{evolved from a}} bottle design {{provided}} by their <b>product</b> <b>designer</b> while they had struggled for name ideas. The team struggled on the first day, with Helene constantly arguing with Alex and Kevin being left to make most of the key decisions. Their dynamic greatly improved on the second day, {{to the point that}} they pulled together in time for their presentation. While the fragrance of caramel and chocolate was loved, the bottle's design was seen as expensive to produce and therefore not fitting of its retail price, despite it being seen as innovative, especially with the feature of a detachable smaller bottle. Meanwhile, Claire and Lee's team named their fragrance R0ULETTE, playing on associations with gambling and James Bond, even using a '0' to give it a connection to a roulette wheel. While the team had no major issues and worked well together, their presentation saw the brand being criticised as likely to be unpopular with women buyers due to the gambling connotation in it, with the fragrance being described as boring in terms of experts regarding it as [...] "retro 50". However, while Sir felt that the theme of the brand was an issue, he declared them the winners of the task, as Helene and Alex's bottle design had proven to be fatally flawed.|$|E
