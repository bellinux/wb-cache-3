40|$|Reliability Based Optimization (RBO) {{is often}} {{computationally}} intensive because the coupling of reliability evaluation and cost minimization. The mean first order reliability method (MFORM) is efficient for reliability evaluation, {{but it may}} not accurate. Nevertheless, the accurate reliability index is often highly correlated with the MFORM reliability index. In this study, we suggest that one can determine the relationship between the MFORM reliability index and the accurate reliability index through a regression analysis, which is called the reliability <b>index</b> <b>mapping</b> function. Based on the reliability <b>index</b> <b>mapping</b> function, an equivalent MFORM target reliability index can be determined such thatMFORMcan be used for reliability evaluation inRBO. Since the computational work involved in MFORM is minimal, RBO based on reliability <b>index</b> <b>mapping</b> functions is efficient. The reliability <b>index</b> <b>mapping</b> function determined via a regression analysis may only reflect the approximate relationship between the accurate reliability index and the MFORM reliability index. How to consider uncertainties in reliability <b>index</b> <b>mapping</b> functions in RBO is also described in this paper. © 2010 Taylor & Francis Group, London...|$|R
40|$|A new {{lossless}} {{video compression}} scheme for coding sequences of color-indexed frames is proposed. This scheme handles the frames sequentially. It reduces both the zero-order entropy {{and the energy}} of the <b>index</b> <b>map</b> of a specific frame by turning the <b>index</b> <b>map</b> into a new <b>index</b> <b>map</b> each element of which serves as an index to a pixel-dependently reordered version of the palette. Accordingly, a matching coding scheme can be exploited to encode the new <b>index</b> <b>map</b> effectively. A technique similar to the one used in animated GIF is also used to remove the inter-frame redundancy. Simulation results show that the proposed method is superior (in terms of compression ratio) to other state-of-art lossless compression algorithms in coding color-indexed video sequences.

40|$|The diploma thesis {{presents}} {{the process of}} homogenization of positional accuracy of land cadastral <b>index</b> <b>map,</b> where the so called membrane method {{as one of the}} possible approaches to achieve the goal of homogenization has been used. In Slovenia, the cadastral <b>index</b> <b>maps</b> are characterized by considerable inhomogeneity as a result of different technologies used for land surveying and maintenance of cadastral maps during several decades. In this thesis, the software solutions of Slovenian providers are presented, which are most frequently used in the land cadastre, and the software solution from the German providers is introduced, which was used in this research for homogenization of positional accuracy of cadastral <b>index</b> <b>map.</b> The whole process is presented starting with data acquisition, data processing, adjustment computation to the analysis of results, we obtained with Systra software. The main purpose was to determine the optimal number of observations of additional land cadastral points, which determine the land plot border, to achieve improvement of positional and geometrical accuracy of the cadastral <b>index</b> <b>map</b> in the study area of cadastral community Bočna.

40|$|AbstractWe prove {{an index}} theorem for {{boundary}} value problems in Boutet de Monvel's calculus on a compact manifold X with boundary. The basic tool is the tangent semi-groupoid T−X generalizing the tangent groupoid defined by Connes in the boundaryless case, and an associated continuous field Cr∗(T−X) of C∗-algebras over [0, 1]. Its fiber in ℏ= 0, Cr∗(T−X), {{can be identified}} with the symbol algebra for Boutet de Monvel's calculus; for ℏ≠ 0 the fibers are isomorphic to the algebra K of compact operators. We therefore obtain a natural map K 0 (Cr∗(T−X)) =K 0 (C 0 (T∗X)) →K 0 (K) =Z. Using deformation theory we show {{that this is the}} analytic <b>index</b> <b>map.</b> On the other hand, using ideas from noncommutative geometry, we construct the topological <b>index</b> <b>map</b> and prove that it coincides with the analytic <b>index</b> <b>map...</b>|$|R
40|$|The diploma thesis {{presents}} one of {{the possible}} approaches to improve the positional accuracy of digitalized graphical cadastral maps based on membrane method. Graphical cadastral maps became practically useless or conditional applicable to professional use due to measurement techniques, mathematical foundations of cadastral surveying, poor maintenance through the history and consequently the heterogeneity of the cadastral <b>index</b> <b>maps.</b> Because of this, much attention {{has been focused on}} improving of the positional accuracy of these maps. This work describes the approach to the improvement of land-cadastral <b>index</b> <b>map</b> positional accuracy within the cadastral municipality of Žažar and is based on surveying principles such as measurements, adjustment (least square method, error propagation etc.). In the thesis, the entire process of determination, identification (in the field), surveying measurements of the "tie points" and their further processing together with other data from the land cadastre by the software tool Systra, based on the principles of membrane method, is described. The main purpose has been to evaluate the use of different identical (tie) points, to determine their optimal arrangement in the study area and to determine the optimal approach to measurements to determine their position for the purpose of improving the positional accuracy of land cadastral <b>index</b> <b>maps.</b> The results of the improved positional accuracy of land cadastral <b>index</b> <b>maps</b> in this study might be further used for comparative analysis with the results of other studies relating to the improvement of positional accuracy of land cadastral <b>index</b> <b>maps,</b> where {{the advantages and disadvantages of}} different approaches should be determined...|$|R
