5000|$|The {{potential}} {{ability for}} stalking users on {{social networking sites}} has been noted and shared. Popular social networking sites {{make it easy to}} build a web of friends and acquaintances and share with them your photos, whereabouts, contact information, and interests without ever getting the chance to actually meet them. With the amount of information that users post about themselves online, it is easy for users to become a victim of stalking without even being aware of the risk. 63% of Facebook profiles are visible to the public, meaning if you Google someone's name and you add [...] "+Facebook" [...] in the search bar you pretty much will see most of the <b>person</b> <b>profile.</b> A study of Facebook profiles from students at Carnegie Mellon University revealed that about 800 profiles included current resident and at least two classes being studied, theoretically allowing viewers to know the precise location of individuals at specific times. [...] AOL attracted controversy over its instant messenger AIM which permits users to add 'buddies' without their knowing, and therefore track when a user is online. [...] Concerns have also been raised over the relative ease for people to read private messages or e-mails on social networking sites. Cyberstalking is a criminal offense that comes into play under state anti-stalking laws, slander laws, and harassment laws. A cyberstalking conviction can result in a restraining order, probation, or even criminal penalties against the assailant, including jail.|$|E

By researcher profiling, we mean building a semantic profile for an academic researcher, by identifying and annotating information from the Web. Previously, <b>person</b> <b>profile</b> annotation was often undertaken separately in an ad-hoc fashion. This paper first gives a formalization of the entire problem and proposes a unified approach to perform the task using Conditional Random Fields (CRF). The paper shows that with introduction {{of a set of}} tags, most of the annotation tasks can be performed within this approach. Experiments show that significant improvements over the separated method can be obtained, because the subtasks of annotation are interdependent and should be performed together. The method has been applied to expert finding. Experimental results show that the performance of expert finding can be significantly improved by using the profiling method...|$|E

Please report any quality issues you encounter to digital@library. tamu. edu, referencing the URI of the item. Includes bibliographical references. Issued also on microfiche from Lange Micrographics. Monte Carlo modeling techniques using mean information fields (MIF), developed by Torsten Hagerstrand in the 1950 s, were integrated with a geographic information system (GIS) to simulate lost person behavior in wilderness areas. Big Bend Ranch State Natural Area, a 265, 000 acre park acquired by Texas Parks and Wildlife, was used as the study area. A comprehensive GIS data base for the park was developed, including relevant layers of contours, hydrography, vegetation, roads/trails, and other man-made features. Travel behaviors were collected from 1 18 lost person mission reports provided by the National Association of Search and Rescue (NASAR). Two models for travel rate and time mobile were developed from these data using linear regression; the first model providing probabilities for input into the MIF based on four significant variables: age, age,- 4, sex, and equipment. Only age was significant in determining the total time mobile for the second model. In a simulation program written in ARC/INFO, these initial probabilities in the MIF were modified according to attributes of the terrain underlying the MIF and according to the lost person's characteristics. Visibility was calculated for each cell in the MIF, and the probabilities of the visible cells were converted to ranges. A random number was generated, and the cell encompassing that random number became the new center of the MIF. Several Monte Carlo simulation runs were conducted, and model behavior was observed by outputting the simulation waypoints and the topographic data on 1 : 24, 000 color maps. The adult lost <b>person</b> <b>profile</b> model migrated an average of 4 kilometers in a predominantly northwest direction from the test point and chose locations which contained drainage features, roads, or gentle slopes. The northwest direction of travel appeared to be partly a result of the southeastern trend of the underlying topography. These choices reflect the lost person behavior data model well, although distance traveled was overestimated and underestimated for minimum and maximum values, respectively. Five simulations for a child profile were performed as a comparison to the adult profile. These simulation runs yielded shorter distances and a preference for gentler slopes...|$|E

Usually {{the tours}} are {{predefined}} and lack support for dynamic interactions between the different robots. This paper focuses on the distributed collaboration of multiple heterogeneous robots (receptionist, companion) guiding visitors through a building. Semantic techniques support the formal definition of tour topics, available content on a specific topic, and the robot and <b>person</b> <b>profiles</b> including interests and acquired knowledge. The robot guides select topics depending on their participants' interests and prior knowledge. Whenever in each other’s neighbourhood, the guides automatically exchange participants optimizing the amount of interesting topics. Robot collaboration is realized through the development of a software module that allows a robot to transparently include behaviours performed by other robots into its own set of behaviours. The multi-robot visitors guide application is integrated into an extended distributed heterogeneous robot team, using a receptionist robot that was not originally designed to cooperate with the guides. Evaluation of the implemented algorithms presents a 90 % content coverage of relevant topics for the participants.

40|$|There {{are three}} {{dominant}} contributing factors that distort short tandem repeat profile measurements, two of which, stutter and {{variations in the}} allelic peak heights, have been described extensively. Here we characterise the remaining component, baseline noise. A probabilistic characterisation of the non-allelic noise peaks is not only inherently useful for statistical inference but is also significant for establishing a detection threshold. We do this by analysing the data from 643 single <b>person</b> <b>profiles</b> for the Identifiler Plus kit and 303 for the PowerPlex 16 HS kit. This investigation reveals that although the dye colour is a significant factor, it {{is not sufficient to}} have a per-dye colour description of the noise. Furthermore, we show that at a per-locus basis, out of the Gaussian, log-normal, and gamma distribution classes, baseline noise is best described by log-normal distributions and provide a methodology for setting an analytical threshold based on that deduction. In the PowerPlex 16 HS kit, we observe evidence of significant stutter at two repeat units shorter than the allelic peak, which has implications for the definition of baseline noise and signal interpretation. In general, the DNA input mass has an influence on the noise distribution. Thus, it is advisable to study noise and, consequently, to infer quantities like the analytical threshold from data with a DNA input mass comparable to the DNA input mass of the samples to be analysed...|$|R
