40|$|This {{review article}} {{examines}} previous weightlifting literature {{and provides a}} rationale {{for the use of}} weightlifting <b>pulling</b> derivatives that eliminate the catch phase for athletes who are not competitive weightlifters. Practitioners should emphasize the completion of the triple extension movement during the second <b>pull</b> phase that is characteristic of weightlifting movements as this is likely to have the greatest transference to athletic performance that is dependent on hip, knee, and ankle extension. The clean <b>pull,</b> snatch <b>pull,</b> hang high <b>pull,</b> jump shrug, and mid-thigh <b>pull</b> are weightlifting <b>pulling</b> derivatives {{that can be used in}} the teaching progression of the full weightlifting movements and are thus less complex with regard to exercise technique. Previous literature suggests that the clean <b>pull,</b> snatch <b>pull,</b> hang high <b>pull,</b> jump shrug, and mid-thigh <b>pull</b> may provide a training stimulus that is as good as, if not better than, weightlifting movements that include the catch phase. Weightlifting <b>pulling</b> derivatives can be implemented throughout the training year, but an emphasis and de-emphasis should be used in order to meet the goals of particular training phases. When implementing weightlifting <b>pulling</b> derivatives, athletes must make a maximum effort, understand that <b>pulling</b> derivatives can be used for both technique work and building strength–power characteristics, and be coached with proper exercise technique. Future research should consider examining the effect of various loads on kinetic and kinematic characteristics of weightlifting <b>pulling</b> derivatives, training with full weightlifting movements as compared to training with weightlifting <b>pulling</b> derivatives, and how kinetic and kinematic variables vary between derivatives of the snatch...|$|R
