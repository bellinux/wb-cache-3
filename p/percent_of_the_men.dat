Despite his arguments {{and the end of the}} division's availability for operations against the Japanese-occupied Ramree Island, he was over-ruled by Churchill's backing of Wingate. On 6September, the division began reorganising for long-range penetration. It had been estimated that 10 <b>percent</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>men</b> would be unsuitable but this had been based on an erroneous report given in London (believed to be from Wingate) that the division was not first class, even though the standard of its infantry was high.|$|E

According to data from the 1940s, gender equality existed neither in the domain of work nor in the area of politics in the kibbutzim of the time. For instance, in 1948, in eight kibbutzim of the Ihud, a kibbutz federation with a pragmatic socialist orientation, 78.3 percent of the women worked in services (services for adults, child care, education) as compared with 16.7 <b>percent</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>men.</b> That same year, 15.2 percent of the women worked in production as distinct from 58.2 <b>percent</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>men.</b> The situation was the same in political life.|$|E
