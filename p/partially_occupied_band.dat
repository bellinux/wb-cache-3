40|$|We {{report on}} the {{simultaneous}} realization of p-type conductivity and strong ferromagnetism in heavily Co-doped ZnO thin films {{in the presence of}} a high concentration of hydrogen impurities. Through ab initio calculations, we find that the microscopic origin of hole carrier generations and ferromagnetic ordering is due to the <b>partially</b> <b>occupied</b> <b>band</b> of the percolative structures wherein the carrier-induced magnetic interactions can stabilize the strong spin-parallel state. close 0...|$|E
40|$|A {{quasiparticle}} {{band structure}} of a single layer 2 H-NbSe$_ 2 $ is reported by using first-principles $GW$ calculation. We show that a self-energy correction increases {{the width of a}} <b>partially</b> <b>occupied</b> <b>band</b> and alters its Fermi surface shape when comparing those using conventional mean-field calculation methods. Owing to a broken inversion symmetry in the trigonal prismatic single layer structure, the spin-orbit interaction is included {{and its impact on the}} Fermi surface and quasiparticle energy bands are discussed. We also calculate the doping dependent static susceptibilities from the band structures obtained by the mean-field calculation as well as $GW$ calculation with and without spin-orbit interactions. A complete tight-binding model is constructed within the three-band third nearest neighbour hoppings and is shown to reproduce our $GW$ quasiparticle energy bands and Fermi surface very well. Considering variations of the Fermi surface shapes depending on self-energy corrections and spin-orbit interactions, we discuss the formations of charge density wave (CDW) with different dielectric environments and their implications on recent controversial experimental results on CDW transition temperatures.

40|$|GaSb and its related alloys possess {{properties}} {{attractive for}} applications in optoelectronic devices. By replacing the anion with other group V elements, e. g. with N or Bi, the band gap and lattice parameter of the binary material can be tuned, thereby vastly increasing {{the range of}} uses for the materials. For a semiconductor material to be suitable for optoelectronic applications, the optical {{as well as the}} electrical properties need to be well understood. Due to their localized states in the band gap, point defects in semiconductors have a large impact on such properties. The substitutional element also affects the electrical and optical properties since it modifies the band structure. As non-equilibrium growth conditions are needed for the incorporation of the group V element, higher concentrations of point defects are typically introduced in the lattice further affecting the above-mentioned properties.   In this work, point defects in GaSb and its alloys are studied. Undoped, GaSb is p-type and the results show that the crystallization conditions affect which of the native acceptor-type defects in the material that dominates. Whereas the Ga antisite is the main cause of the p-type conductivity for bulk GaSb, the Ga vacancy plays a more significant role in the case of epitaxially grown thin films. Donor-type Sb vacancies are found to be unstable in GaSb at room temperature. The irradiation induced defect undergoes a transition at a low temperature resulting in two acceptor-type defects. By adding N or Bi to the GaSb lattice, the hole concentration is increased by a magnitude or more. The reason for the increased hole concentration is attributed to an increase in both the total amount and the fraction of negative charged defects due to growth conditions as well as the modified band structure.   Using N-rich GaNSb as a prototype material, a model for predicting the band offsets over the whole composition range is also developed in this work. Results based on the developed model and optical measurements show that the band alignment of the GaNSb alloys are promising for photoelectrochemical water splitting applications. The electrical properties of the N-rich GaNSb were studied as a function of annealing temperature. The films were found to be p-type and the hole concentration to increase while the resistivity decreases with increasing annealing temperature. The developed model indicates that the incorporated Sb produces a narrow <b>partially</b> <b>occupied</b> <b>band</b> above the valence band edge of GaN. This band is found to be responsible for the p-type conductivity...|$|E
40|$|The √ 3 ×√ 3, √ 39 ×√ 39, and 6 × 6 {{phases of}} Ag/Ge(111) {{have been studied}} by angle-resolved photoemission and {{low-energy}} electron diffraction. The √ 3 ×√ 3 surface, formed at a one-monolayer (ML) Ag coverage, shows a metallic behavior with two <b>partially</b> <b>occupied</b> surface <b>bands</b> resulting from a tiny amount of extra Ag atoms on the surface. The √ 3 ×√ 3 surface transforms into a √ 39 ×√ 39 periodicity, below ∼ 250 K, when {{a small amount of}} Ag is added to the surface. The presence of the additional Ag atoms leads to an increased filling of two <b>partially</b> <b>occupied</b> surface <b>bands.</b> By depositing ∼ 0. 2 ML of Ag on the √ 3 ×√ 3 surface, it transforms into a 6 × 6 periodicity. We observe an interesting transition from the metallic √ 3 ×√ 3 and √ 39 ×√ 39 phases to a semiconducting phase for the 6 × 6 surface, with a gap of around 0. 2 eV with respect to the Fermi level. On the 6 × 6 surface, the lower <b>band</b> of the <b>partially</b> <b>occupied</b> surface <b>bands</b> is pulled down entirely below the Fermi level while the upper band is missing in the photoemission spectra.

The Zunger-Freeman self-consistent numerical-basis-set linear combination of atomic orbitals method has been used within the Hohenberg-Kohn-Sham local-density-functional formalism. We find that hydrogen acts as an acceptor to graphite, while potassium acts as a donor.

40|$|We {{present a}} first-principles scheme {{that allows the}} orbital {{magnetization}} of a magnetic crystal to be evaluated accurately and efficiently even {{in the presence of}} complex Fermi surfaces. Starting from an initial electronic-structure calculation with a coarse ab initio k-point mesh, maximally localized Wannier functions are constructed and used to interpolate the necessary k-space quantities on a fine mesh, in parallel to a previously developed formalism for the anomalous Hall conductivity. We formulate our new approach in a manifestly gauge-invariant manner, expressing the orbital magnetization in terms of traces over matrices in Wannier space. Since only a few (e. g., of the order of 20) Wannier functions are typically needed to describe the <b>occupied</b> and <b>partially</b> <b>occupied</b> <b>bands,</b> these Wannier matrices are small, which makes the interpolation itself very efficient. The method has been used to calculate the orbital magnetization of bcc Fe, hcp Co, and fcc Ni. Unlike an approximate calculation based on integrating orbital currents inside atomic spheres, our results nicely reproduce the experimentally measured ordering of the orbital magnetization in these three materials. 2012 American Physical Society.

40|$|We have {{performed}} self-consistent calculations of the dynamical {{response of the}} (111) surface of the noble metals Cu, Ag, and Au. Our {{results indicate that the}} <b>partially</b> <b>occupied</b> surface-state <b>band</b> in these materials yields the existence of acoustic surface plasmons with linear dispersion at small wave vectors. Here we demonstrate that the sound velocity of these low-energy collective excitations, which had already been predicted to exist in the case of Be(0001), is dictated not only by the Fermi velocity of the two-dimensional surface-state band but also {{by the nature of the}} decay and penetration of the surface-state orbitals into the solid. Our linewidth calculations indicate that acoustic surface plasmons should be well defined in the energy range from zero to ∼ 400 meV. Comment: 8 pages, two columns, 7 figures, to appear in Phys.

40|$|Based upon {{ab initio}} {{electronic}} structure calculations by the Korringa-Kohn-Rostoker coherent-potential approximation (KKR-CPA) method within the local-density approximation (LDA), we propose a unified physical picture of magnetism and an accurate calculation method of Curie temperature (T-C) in dilute magnetic semiconductors (DMSs) in II-VI and III-V compound semiconductors. We also propose the unified physical picture of magnetism in the DMS, where ferromagnetic Zener's double-exchange mechanism (or Zener's p-d exchange mechanism) {{caused by the}} <b>partially</b> <b>occupied</b> impurity <b>band</b> and anti-ferromagnetic super-exchange mechanism (or ferromagnetic super-exchange mechanism) is competing to determine the magnetic states in the DMS. We propose that the three-dimensional 3 D Dairiseki-phase and one-dimensional ID Konbu-phase caused by spinodal nano-decomposition are responsible for high-T-C phase in the inhomogeneous system.

40|$|The {{electronic}} {{structures of}} the stage- 1 hydrogen-potassium-graphite ternary intercalation compounds C 4 KHx are investigated. The band {{structures of the}}se compounds are determined in a Hohenberg-Kohn-Sham local-density-functional formalism using the self-consistent numerical-basis-set linear combination of atomic-orbitals method. Our band-structure calculation is carried out for C 4 KHx with three assumed in-plane superlattice models of hydrogen structure: (a) (2 × 2) R(0 °) model (x= 0. 5); (b) (2 × √ 3) R(0 °, 30 °) model (x= 0. 5); (c) (1 × √ 3) R(0 °, 30 °) model (x= 1. 0). In these three cases, we estimate {{the amount of the}} charge transfer among the individual atoms and show that the hydrogen atom acts as an acceptor to graphite, while the potassium atom acts as a donor. The charge transfer to the hydrogen atoms is imperfect and therefore the hydrogen 1 s state forms a <b>partially</b> <b>occupied</b> metallic <b>band.</b> This hydrogen 1 s-like band coexists with the graphite π*-like bands at the Fermi level.

40|$|A √ 21 ×√ 21 {{reconstruction}} {{has been}} formed by adding either K or Cs atoms on the Ag∕Si(111) √ 3 ×√ 3 surface at 120  K. The electronic structures of these surfaces {{have been studied}} by angle-resolved valence band and core-level spectroscopy. In similarity with Ag or Au adatoms, the presence of K or Cs adatoms on Ag∕Si(111) √ 3 ×√ 3 results in a metallic √ 21 ×√ 21 surface. The formation of two surface bands near the Fermi level {{can be explained by}} band folding of a <b>partially</b> <b>occupied</b> surface <b>band</b> originating from the underlying Ag∕Si(111) √ 3 ×√ 3 surface. A detailed analysis of the Si 2 p core-level spectra of the above surfaces is presented and compared to the Ag∕Si(111) √ 3 ×√ 3 surface. In the case of Ag∕Si(111) √ 3 ×√ 3, we find that the metallic tail of the Si 2 p spectra is related to extra Ag. Both the valence band and the Si 2 p spectra of the Ag∕Si(111) √ 3 ×√ 3 surface show that the surface is semiconducting after annealing at ∼ 600 °C...|$|R
40|$|Hard x-ray {{photoelectron}} spectroscopy (HAXPES) is used {{to investigate}} the intrinsic electronic properties of single crystal epitaxial CdO(100) thin films grown by metal organic vapor phase epitaxy (MOVPE). The reduced surface sensitivity of the HAXPES technique relaxes stringent surface preparation requirements, thereby allowing the measurement of as-grown samples with intrinsically higher carrier concentration (n= 2. 4 × 1020 cm- 3). High-resolution HAXPES spectra of the valence band and core levels measured at photon energy of 6054 eV are presented. The effects of conduction band filling and band gap renormalization are discussed to explain the observed binding energy shifts. The measured bandwidth of the <b>partially</b> <b>occupied</b> conduction <b>band</b> feature indicates that a plasmon contribution may be present at higher carrier concentrations. The Cd 3 d 5 / 2 and O 1 s core-level line shapes are found to exhibit an increased asymmetry with increased carrier concentration, interpreted as evidence for final state screening effects from the carriers in the conduction band. Alternatively the core-level line shape is interpreted as arising from strong conduction electron plasmon satellites. The nature of these two competing models to describe core-level line shapes in metallic oxides is explored. © 2014 American Physical Society...|$|R
40|$|Density {{functional}} theory {{calculations of}} certain transition-metal doped semiconductors show a <b>partially</b> <b>occupied</b> relatively narrow <b>band</b> located between valence band and conduction band. These novel systems, containing the metallic band, are called intermediate-band materials.

We previously proposed III-V, chalcopyrite and sulfide derived compounds showing desirable characteristics to produce the intermediate band of interest inside the band-gap. In order to obtain further intermediate-band material proposals, this work focuses on studing other compounds constituted mainly by tetravalent elements. The first proposal is vanadium substituting Sn atoms in SnS 2, the second one is composed by type II silicon clathrate with two possibilities: vanadium substituting Si and Ag occluded in the intra-crystalline cavities.

40|$|The O(2 × 1) /Cu(110) surface {{reconstruction}} of the Cu(110) surface is induced by 0. 5 ML of oxygen adsorption and is formed by Cu-O chains running along the [001] direction. Here, we show that hybridization between surface states of the Cu(110) substrate and one-dimensional states of the Cu-O chains is crucial in understanding the electronic structure of this surface. Specifically, the interaction between one <b>occupied</b> antibonding <b>band</b> of the Cu-O chain with O(py) character (y-axis taken along the Cu-O chain direction) and the <b>partially</b> <b>occupied</b> surface state at the Y point of the clean Cu(110) surface with Cu(py) character causes {{major changes in the}} electronic structure close to the Fermi energy (EF). This surface state decays very slowly into the bulk and a thick slab is needed to properly describe it, which might explain why the importance of this hybridization has not been recognized so far. In our calculations we obtain two hybrid bands: (i) a fully <b>occupied</b> <b>band</b> that strongly hybridizes with the bulk Cu sp states nearby EF, becoming a very broad resonance, thus explaining why it is not observed in photoemission experiments; (ii) an empty band that acquires surface state character, including its dispersion close to the zone boundary at the Y point. This splitting induces a partial population of the py antibonding band that is necessary to reconcile the calculated charge transfer from the Cu(110) substrate to the Cu-O chain (∼ 0. 5 electrons/f. u.) with the apparently fully <b>occupied</b> <b>band</b> structure of the adsorbed Cu-O chain (consistent with 1 electron transferred per formula unit). © 2013 IOP Publishing Ltd.
