5|$|I think {{everyone}} who disses the Columbine RPG is gutless. Most haven't played the game, or have played it with such preconceptions that they're blinded to the genuis , the honesty, {{the beauty of}} its social commentary. Super Columbine Massacre RPG is riddled with design flaws and has mediocre graphics by 1995, the maker of the game admits this, but it regardless {{is a work of}} art. It <b>puts</b> <b>you</b> <b>in</b> the mindset of the killers and provides a very clear suggestion of why they did what they did; they were enacting an ideological demonstration through a terrorist act, and the game shines light on this as an indictment of the American dream and way of life painfully close to the main nerve.|$|E
500|$|In practice, Fellini {{shot his}} films while playing taped music because, as he {{explained}} in a 1972 interview, [...] "it <b>puts</b> <b>you</b> <b>in</b> a strange dimension in which your fantasy stimulates you". For La Strada, Fellini used a variation by Arcangelo Corelli {{that he planned to}} use on the sound track. Rota, unhappy with that plan, wrote an original motif (with echoes of the [...] "Larghetto" [...] from Dvořák's Opus 22 Serenade for Strings in E major [...] ) with rhythmic lines matched to Corelli's piece that synchronize with Gelsomina's movements with the trumpet and Il Matto's with the violin.|$|E
500|$|In November 2012, Aditya Music {{released}} Eega on Blu-ray [...] with English subtitles and DTS-HD MA 5.1 surround sound. The release {{also contained}} a two-hour DVD about {{the making of}} the film. J. Hurtado of Twitch Film reviewed the Blu-ray version, writing, [...] "The most egregious mangling of the film {{comes in the form of}} a severely fucked contrast scale, which leads to absurdly crushed black levels rendering nearly all shadow detail completely obliterated". Hurtado called the audio a [...] "thing of beauty, giving good separation and a booming low end that <b>puts</b> <b>you</b> <b>in</b> the middle of the Eega action in a way that even my theatrical experience couldn't do".|$|E

500|$|The Castle Doctrine {{was created}} by indie {{developer}} Jason Rohrer; its ideas were drawn from Rohrer's childhood anxieties about his family's house being burgled, and his adult sense of responsibility over protecting his family. [...] The game's central theme is the castle doctrine and includes the issue of gun rights; Rohrer created it partially as an [...] "artistic statement" [...] on defending one's family through violence. He summarized his goals with the game as creating something [...] "that makes you feel violated and {{makes you want to}} protect stuff that’s yours, and <b>puts</b> <b>you</b> <b>in</b> the process of securing what’s yours." [...] However, he has remarked that the consequence of making players feel hypocritical—since they are invading others' homes as well—was partially intentional and an [...] "elegant" [...] idea.|$|E
500|$|While {{speaking}} with the media during his campaign, Amondson voiced his anti-alcohol message and attempted to address concerns that prohibition increases crime. In an AP interview, he explained that during Prohibition, [...] "the budget was balanced, prisons were emptied, mental institutions emptied and cirrhosis of the liver declined." [...] He concluded, [...] "I'd rather have 100 Al Capones in every city than alcohol sold in every grocery store." [...] Amondson made an appearance on The Daily Show with comedian Jon Stewart. He spoke with correspondent Ed Helms who joked with the candidate. During the segment, Amondson remarked, [...] "alcohol cuts the supply of oxygen to the brain and <b>puts</b> <b>you</b> <b>in</b> a kind of retarded state." [...] A short clip followed that showed Amondson in his Grim Reaper attire. Earl Dodge also appeared on the show in a separate interview with Helms.|$|E
500|$|The PlayStation 3 version {{received}} critical acclaim. IGN {{gave the}} game an [...] "Editor's Choice" [...] Award, praised the enhanced resolutions, lower price point, and smoother frame rates, and stated {{it was the}} [...] "definitive way to play the game". 1up.com noted the tremendous increase in visuals but said the in-engine cut-scenes appeared blurry. GamePro stated the collection is [...] "two fantastic games on one disc for a low price; <b>puts</b> <b>you</b> <b>in</b> the right mindset for God of War 3." [...] PlayStation LifeStyle (5/5) said [...] "Those... familiar with Kratos will enjoy the extra polish the Collection brings {{to two of the}} best games from the PS2 era." [...] Due to the success of God of War Collection, Sony announced that further titles would receive similar treatment for release under its new [...] "Classics HD" [...] brand. By June 2012, God of War Collection had sold more than 2.4 million copies worldwide, making it the eighteenth best-selling PlayStation 3 game of all time.|$|E

2500|$|Many of Farrakhan's {{comments}} {{have been}} deemed antisemitic by the Anti-Defamation League. In 2012, the Simon Wiesenthal Center included some of Farrakhan's comments on {{its list of}} the Top 10 antisemitic slurs of that year. At {{a meeting of the}} Nation of Islam at Madison Square Garden in 1985, Farrakhan said of the Jews: [...] "And don't you forget, when it's God who <b>puts</b> <b>you</b> <b>in</b> the ovens, it's forever!" [...] Farrakhan made antisemitic comments during his May 16–17, 2013 visit to Detroit and in his weekly sermons titled [...] "The Time and What Must Be Done", begun during January 2013. In March 2015, Farrakhan accused Jews of involvement in the September 11 attacks.|$|E
2500|$|The seventh {{track on}} Odd Blood, [...] "Rome", {{features}} beats taken from Moroccan and Syrian dance music that Keating's wife {{had on her}} iPod, while for [...] "Strange Reunions", Yeasayer created a short song under three minutes by exploring unconventional time signatures in different parts {{in the style of}} fellow New York City band Dirty Projectors. [...] "Mondegreen" [...] follows and is an old song created by Keating using samplers plugged into a television set. Using four channels which showed programs like infomercials and soap operas, he recorded four banks of sound and structured a song by singing on top of the material. The last track, [...] "Grizelda", is, according to Tuton, [...] "a nice way to close an album. It lulls you into sitting back in your chair, <b>puts</b> <b>you</b> <b>in</b> a trance a bit, although the subject matter might be a bit dark." ...|$|E
