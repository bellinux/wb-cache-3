25|$|Pakistanis {{generally}} eat {{three meals}} a day, which are breakfast, lunch, and dinner. During the evening, many families have tea without sugar, which goes along with baked/fried snacks from a local bakery (or <b>prepared</b> <b>at</b> <b>home).</b> During the Islamic holy month of Ramadan, the eating patterns change to sehri and iftar. It is considered proper to eat only with the right hand as per Islamic tradition (also a tradition in many other Asian cultures). Many Pakistani families, particularly when guests are too many to fit at a table, eat sitting at a cloth known as Dastarkhān, which is {{spread out on the}} floor. In Pakistan, many street eateries serve food on a takht, in a style similar to what is seen in Afghanistan. A takht is a raised platform, where people eat their food sitting cross-legged, after taking their shoes off. Most Pakistanis used to eat on a takht. Pakistanis often eat with their hands, scooping up solid food along with sauce with a piece of baked bread (naan) or rice.|$|E

Commonly used in baking and mixed drinks, it is sold as [...] "superfine" [...] sugar in the United States.

2500|$|The cemita {{is a kind}} of {{sandwich}} on a roll, {{related to}} the torta, particularly popular in Mexico City and the pambazo, which is of French origin and popular in several areas in central Mexico. The sandwich has its origin with two kinds of bread which were brought over from Spain during the colonial period: one called “bizcocho de sal,” which was long and hard and a kind of hollow cracker. Both breads were developed for long storage and eventually were made in Puebla with grain from the Atlixco area. These two breads eventually fused into a unique type that became softer by the mid 19th century. The name is derived from a Jewish unleavened bread called [...] "semita", which was brought over by Sephardi Jews to New Spain. These were also produced in Puebla state. The cemitas were <b>prepared</b> <b>at</b> <b>home</b> and filled with potatoes, beans and nopal cactus and eaten by the lower classes. Later, an establishment in the Mercado Victoria market began to sell them to the public filled with meat from bull’s feet with a vinaigrette, herbs, onions and chili peppers. This new filling was a hit and eventually this and other variations became a staple in many markets and popular eateries. Today, a large number varieties exist but all are prepared using the same type of bread.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{examines}} how individuals {{make decisions on}} the allocation of time for food preparation. Based on the 2005 American Time Use Survey data, Tobit estimates show that hours of work {{have a significant effect}} on one’s allocation of time for <b>preparing</b> food <b>at</b> <b>home</b> but not for purchasing prepared food. Time spent on family care and leisure increases time spent for both <b>preparing</b> food <b>at</b> <b>home</b> and for purchasing prepared food, and that varies by gender and by socio-economic characteristics. Highly educated individuals are likely to devote more time to purchasing prepared food, but apparently not for <b>preparing</b> food <b>at</b> <b>home.</b> These findings confirm the varied effect of socio-demographic differences on one’s decision to allocate time for food preparation...|$|R

40|$|Acrylamide is {{chemical}} {{matter which}} forms spontaneously as frying or cooking heat treatment enforced in foods. Though the said chemical is widely {{found in the}} fried or oven-cooked foods, it can also exist in the grilled foods <b>prepared</b> <b>at</b> <b>homes</b> or <b>at</b> large restaurants. However, no acrylamide {{has been found in}} the raw or boiled foods. Based on the studies made on acrylamide, and its observed biological effects, that chemical is suspected to be a human carcinogen. Neural destructions have been observed on the individuals who are exposed to this chemical. As yet, there isn&# 146;t any direct evidence about carcinogenic effects of acrylamide for human. In conclusion, we can say that acrylamide creates a risk for human health only in the cases of long term exposure to it. [TAF Prev Med Bull 2009; 8 (2. 000) : 187 - 192...|$|R

40|$|Delivery of {{assistance}} to the poor has changed drastically in the past 20 years. While the availability of cash assistance has decreased, the availability of food assistance has widened. The most substantial change in assistance available to the poor {{may have been the}} emergence of food pantries as a source of free food to <b>prepare</b> <b>at</b> <b>home.</b> Large numbers of Americans rely on food pantries, but many policymakers, academics, and participants in the private food assistance network have limited understanding of the network. This paper aims to fill that gap by examining how the network evolved, how much it costs, and how it operates. We provide a detailed review of domestic food policy since the 1930 s, show how agricultural and welfare policies contributed to developing a supply of free food available to the needy, and explain how private efforts, such as the creation of Second Harvest, resulted in a rise in food pantries.
