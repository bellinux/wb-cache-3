5|$|A second {{important}} decision in which Owsley was a <b>participant</b> <b>was</b> {{the case of}} Blair, etc. v. Williams, which invalidated the Kentucky Replevin Act of 1820. This law granted debtors a two-year grace period in repaying their debts unless their creditors would accept notes from the Bank of Kentucky. Owsley and his colleagues opined that this law was {{in violation of the}} Contract Clause of the U.S. Constitution. The decision was extremely unpopular with the Commonwealth's citizens, but it was re-affirmed by the court's opinion in the related case of Lapsley v. Brashcars and Barr.|$|E
5|$|Australia has {{competed in}} either the long track or short track forms of speed skating at every Olympics that it has attended, except 1964. Australia's Winter Olympic inaugural <b>participant</b> <b>was</b> long track speed skater Kenneth Kennedy, who competed in 1936 {{and placed in the}} bottom 25% in all of his four events. Colin Hickey {{finished}} seventh in 1956 in the 500 and 1,000m long track speed skating, and placed 13th and 14th four years later. Until 1968, Hickey's four aforementioned results were the only times that an Australian finished in the top half of their event.|$|E
50|$|The tournament's 8 <b>participants</b> <b>were</b> from {{at least}} two confederations. Two <b>participants</b> <b>are</b> unknown.|$|R
30|$|The mean <b>participant</b> age <b>was</b> {{approximately}} 66.9 (SD[*]=[*] 7.74) years. Demographic {{information was}} also collected {{to know that}} all the <b>participants</b> <b>were</b> unrelated Caucasian men. Due to the characteristics of this pathology, all of the <b>participants</b> <b>were</b> men.|$|R
30|$|For {{detecting}} high size effects (d >  1), 16 <b>participants</b> <b>are</b> {{required at}} power β =  0.8 and 21 <b>participants</b> <b>are</b> {{required for a}} power β =  0.9.|$|R
5|$|Sessions for the {{proposed}} album took place at London's Abbey Road Studios, beginning on 2 February 1971. In addition to his own contribution as guitarist, Harrison enlisted some of the musicians {{with whom he had}} recorded All Things Must Pass: Gary Wright, on keyboards; Derek and the Dominos drummer Jim Gordon; Voormann and Carl Radle (the latter another member of the Dominos), alternating on bass; and Badfinger's Pete Ham on second guitar and percussion. Another <b>participant</b> <b>was</b> Leon Russell, familiar to Phil Spector as a regular member of the Wrecking Crew during the mid 1960s. Recording continued at Abbey Road on 3 February, during which Lennon joined the proceedings, allegedly on piano.|$|E
5|$|A.J. Styles {{went on to}} Destination X {{to defend}} the TNA X Division Championship in an Ultimate X Challenge match. An Ultimate X Challenge match has three stages. Stage one {{involves}} the four men being paired up into two tag teams and having a standard tag team match, with {{the person who is}} pinned being eliminated from the bout. Then it becomes a standard match involving three people, with the one being pinned in that phase being eliminated from the match. The final two then fight to climb the ropes and retrieve the championship that hangs in the middle. The participants were announced for the match on the March 11 episode of Impact!, with Elix Skipper and Ron Killings being added to face Styles. The final <b>participant</b> <b>was</b> determined in a match that pitted Christopher Daniels against Chris Sabin, which Daniels won. Styles would lose the championship to Daniels at the event.|$|E
5|$|In a Schrödinger's cat-like situation, {{immediately}} {{prior to}} the start of the Nonary Game, Dio either murdered the old woman and took her place in the game, or failed to do so but was still placed into the game by her and later planted the bombs. In the timeline leading to the game's ultimate ending, Sigma defuses the bombs, while Dio is restrained and incapacitated. The remaining participants proceed to the next set of puzzle rooms. As Sigma, Phi, and Tenmyouji complete their room, they uncover a holographic message of the old woman, Akane Kurashiki, whom Tenmyouji – revealed to be the player character Junpei from Nine Hours, Nine Persons, Nine Doors – was seeking. Akane and Zero Sr. had developed the AB project, a project that encompassed the Nonary Game and the Ambidex Game, to train Sigma and Phi to transport their consciousnesses through time. This occurs shortly thereafter, and Phi subdues Dio before he can kill Akane. Akane explains that the game's dangerous elements were necessary to speed up one's brain to transport one's consciousness through time, and each <b>participant</b> <b>was</b> infected with Radical-6 to amplify this increase. The Nonary Game was designed so Sigma and Phi could experience multiple timelines and retain what they learn in each one. Sigma and Phi's consciousnesses are then returned to the present, where they find everyone has cooperated to acquire enough points to escape.|$|E
30|$|All <b>participants</b> <b>were</b> {{provided}} with BB and Cisco ASDM monitoring tools. Two <b>participants</b> <b>were</b> randomly selected (here identified as Participant 2 and <b>Participant</b> 4) and <b>were</b> furnished with EtherApe, which represented the “enhanced visualization” condition.|$|R
50|$|During a whispered speech test, the <b>{{participant}}</b> <b>is</b> {{asked to}} cover the opening of one ear with a finger. The tester will then step back 1 to 2 feet behind the participant and say a series of words in a soft whisper. The <b>participant</b> <b>is</b> then asked to repeat what is heard. If the <b>participant</b> <b>is</b> unable to distinguish the word, the tester will speak progressively louder until the <b>participant</b> <b>is</b> able {{to understand what is}} being said. The other ear is then tested.|$|R
30|$|This {{categorization}} {{was supported}} by the way the research <b>participants</b> <b>were</b> assigned to treatment and control groups, as defined by Shadish et al. (2002). During the coding process, two main categories emerged: (a) randomized, where the <b>participants</b> <b>were</b> randomly selected and assigned to the treatment or control group, and (b) quasi-experimental, where the <b>participants</b> <b>were</b> assigned by the researchers.|$|R
25|$|At Bridgewater State University, {{the second}} 2013 Fall game was {{suspended}} and later cancelled after a <b>participant</b> <b>was</b> arrested for suspicious activity.|$|E
25|$|The next {{match was}} the Cruiserweight Open for the WWE Cruiserweight Championship. The first two {{competitors}} were the defending champion, Funaki and Paul London. London pinned Funaki {{with the help}} of Spike Dudley, who entered early. With the help of the eliminated Funaki, London pinned Dudley. The next <b>participant</b> <b>was</b> Shannon Moore, who missed a Corkscrew Moonsault, allowing London to perform a 450° splash to eliminate him. The fifth entrant was Akio, who was eliminated by countout. The final <b>participant</b> <b>was</b> Chavo Guerrero. Guerrero took control of the match, and when London tried to perform a roll-up, Guerrero pinned London using the ropes to win the title.|$|E
25|$|The last segment {{featured}} {{a party in}} the participants' hometown, where she would show off her new look to friends and family, who would comment on how impressed they were and how happy she looked. With the credits rolling, the <b>participant</b> <b>was</b> shown in additional wardrobe items and commented on what the experience did for her emotionally and how it improved her confidence.|$|E
30|$|<b>Participants</b> <b>were</b> 42 Temple University {{undergraduates}} (31 females) fulfilling {{a requirement}} for an introductory psychology course. Two <b>participants</b> <b>were</b> excluded from the analysis for not following instructions.|$|R
30|$|All <b>participants</b> <b>were</b> given full {{anonymity}} in {{this research}} project. As a result, no details, images, or videos relating to individual <b>participants</b> <b>are</b> included in the paper.|$|R
50|$|In {{the first}} {{activity}} following the preshow, <b>participants</b> <b>are</b> led into a cylindrical room (Control Freak's electronic lair), {{in which the}} walls are decked with multiple control panels, and {{the aim of this}} activity was to sprint from one control panel to another, to switch off the falling televisions. Following the activity, <b>participants</b> <b>are</b> led into a room with an arrangement of cannons (a similar setup to Toy Story Midway Mania!) and <b>participants</b> <b>were</b> to shoot down city scenes constructed from junk foods, with broccoli, carrots and blueberries for ammunition. For the third activity, <b>participants</b> <b>are</b> led into a room with a dancing grid, and <b>participants</b> <b>were</b> encouraged to partake in a physically active dance routine, and likely to get Leadbottom to dance along as well.|$|R
25|$|There is however {{a rise in}} {{violence}} among Tongans that have left Tonga. On March 7, 1987, a 15-year-old was fatally shot in the Disneyland parking lot. The incident began as an early morning confrontation between rival Samoan and Tongan gang members before escalating into a brawl. Another <b>participant</b> <b>was</b> convicted of second-degree murder, but the conviction was subsequently overturned by a state appellate court.|$|E
25|$|Simultaneously {{with the}} Domestic Partnership Act of 1999, Assemblymember Carole Migden {{introduced}} Assembly Bill 26 of 1999. As originally drafted, it covered all adult couples, like its unsuccessful senate counterpart. Before bringing {{the bill to}} the Assembly floor, however, Migden narrowed its scope. Based on objections from Governor Gray Davis, {{who did not want}} a competing alternative to marriage for opposite-sex couples, Migden eliminated coverage for opposite-sex couples where either <b>participant</b> <b>was</b> less than 62 years of age. The bill passed, and Davis approved it on October 2, 1999. It provided for a public registry, hospital visitation rights, and authorized health insurance coverage for domestic partners of public employees.|$|E
25|$|In {{studies of}} {{prepared}} learning, conditioned fear responses to images of outgroup males {{were far more}} difficult to extinguish than conditioned fear responses to outgroup females or ingroup members of either sex, as measured by conductivity tests of perspiration on the skin. These results held true whether the <b>participant</b> <b>was</b> male or female. Because the neural circuitry for fear responses are more developed towards stimuli that have posed a larger threat for most of human history (snakes and spiders, for example, which were dangers frequently encountered by foragers), {{these findings suggest that}} outgroup males may have been more of a threat to physical safety than outgroup women or ingroup members, supporting the male warrior hypothesis.|$|E
25|$|<b>Participants</b> <b>were</b> then {{divided into}} 2 groups to {{evaluate}} the computer’s performance and <b>participants</b> <b>were</b> asked to describe this performance from the choice of about 20 adjectives. Half of the <b>participants</b> <b>were</b> assigned to evaluate on computer #1, the computer that praised its own work. The other half were sent to another computer {{across the room to}} evaluate computer#1’s performance.|$|R
30|$|<b>Participants</b> <b>were</b> 160 South Korean {{respondents}} recruited {{through an}} online survey company in South Korea (48.1 % male, Mage =  22.94  ±  2.06  years; age range 20 – 29  years). The experiment was conducted using a mobile platform {{provided by the}} online survey company. Three <b>participants</b> <b>were</b> excluded due to incompleteness in their data; thus, the responses of 157 <b>participants</b> <b>were</b> analyzed.|$|R
30|$|Eligible <b>participants</b> <b>are</b> between 18 and 70  years of age {{and have}} at least one {{headache}} attack per month. <b>Participants</b> <b>are</b> diagnosed according to at least three major criteria not including occipital nerve blockage from the diagnostic criteria of the Cervicogenic Headache International Study Group (Sjaastad et al. 1998; Knackstedt et al. 2010). All <b>participants</b> <b>are</b> diagnosed by a neurologist.|$|R
25|$|Andrew Moray had plunged the {{province}} of Moray into rebellion. King Edward's principal follower in the area was Sir Reginald Cheyne, the Scots sheriff of Elgin. The active support of some Scottish lords allowed King Edward to rule Scotland without deploying a large occupying force, but their ultimate loyalty was frequently questioned by English officials and chroniclers. Cheyne was alarmed by the growth of Moray's rebellion. He wrote to the king requesting assistance, who responded by instructing him to vigorously suppress the rebels. Sir Reginald ordered his principal lieutenants to a meeting at Inverness Castle on 25 May 1297 to discuss {{how to deal with}} Andrew Moray. One <b>participant</b> <b>was</b> Sir William fitz Warin, constable of Urquhart Castle standing on the western shore of Loch Ness.|$|E
25|$|From the mid-1830s to {{his death}} in 1844, Smith {{continued}} to introduce ideas and practices which differed significantly from traditional Protestantism. First, Smith pressed Christian perfection beyond Protestant orthodoxy. He followed non-Protestant Christians in rejecting the doctrine of justification by faith alone and moved toward universalism by introducing a hierarchy of three glorious heavens, in which even the wicked had a place. In the late 1830s, Smith introduced baptism for the dead by proxy {{as a means for}} unredeemed souls to accept salvation in the afterlife, and he also taught that the ordinance of marriage was required to reach the highest level of salvation. Smith also introduced a second anointing ritual, after which a <b>participant</b> <b>was</b> guaranteed virtually unconditional salvation. This has been seen as an attempt to retain the Calvinistic ideas of assured salvation.|$|E
25|$|Another {{experiment}} {{involved an}} electronic ouija board where the device's movements were manipulated by the experimenter, while the <b>participant</b> <b>was</b> {{led to believe}} they were entirely self-conducted. The experimenter stopped the device on occasions and asked the participant how much they themselves felt like they wanted to stop. The participant also listened to words in headphones; and {{it was found that}} if experimenter stopped next to an object that came through the headphones {{they were more likely to}} say they wanted to stop there. If the participant perceived having the thought at the time of the action, then it was assigned as intentional. It was concluded that a strong illusion of perception of causality requires; priority (we assume the thought must precede the action), consistency (the thought is about the action), and exclusivity (no other apparent causes or alternative hypotheses).|$|E
50|$|The {{primary role}} of PSI <b>participants</b> <b>is</b> {{to abide by}} the Statement of Interdiction Principles, with the primary purpose of interdicting subject weapons and materials. Additionally, <b>participants</b> <b>are</b> {{recommended}} to enact legal statutes to facilitate effective interdiction and seizure of such items. Finally, <b>participants</b> <b>are</b> to take measures to ensure that their national facilities are not utilized to transfer illicit weapon cargoes.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Participants</b> <b>were</b> then {{divided into}} 2 groups to {{evaluate}} the computer’s performance and <b>participants</b> <b>were</b> asked to describe this performance from the choice of about 20 adjectives. Half of the <b>participants</b> <b>were</b> assigned to evaluate on computer #1, the computer that praised its own work. The other half were sent to another computer {{across the room to}} evaluate computer#1’s performance.|$|R
30|$|For {{each test}} {{sentence}} in the survey paper, <b>participants</b> <b>were</b> asked to complete three tasks about the {{sentence in the}} following order: (1) acceptability judgement, (2) grammaticality judgement, and (3) subject selection. In the acceptability judgement task, <b>participants</b> <b>were</b> required to rate the acceptability of a test sentence on a 7 -point Likert scale. In the grammaticality judgement task, <b>participants</b> <b>were</b> required to decide whether a test sentence was grammatical or not. In the subject selection task, <b>participants</b> <b>were</b> required to choose the subject out of the two NPs in a test sentence; a third choice ‘cannot decide’ was also allowed. To ensure that the <b>participants</b> <b>were</b> {{paying attention to the}} subject selection task, for half of the tasks, the presented order of the two NPs in the question was the reverse of their positions in the test sentences. Before completing the survey, <b>participants</b> <b>were</b> instructed that there were no standard answers to the tasks and that they should base their answers on their first impressions.|$|R
25|$|A {{statistical}} learning mechanism {{has also}} been proposed for learning the meaning of words. Specifically, Yu and Smith conducted a pair of studies in which adults were exposed to pictures of objects and heard nonsense words. Each nonsense word was paired with a particular object. There were 18 total word-referent pairs, and each <b>participant</b> <b>was</b> presented with either 2, 3, or 4 objects at a time, depending on the condition, and heard the nonsense word associated {{with one of those}} objects. Each word-referent pair was presented 6 times {{over the course of the}} training trials; after the completion of the training trials, participants completed a forced-alternative test in which they were asked to choose the correct referent that matched a nonsense word they were given. Participants were able to choose the correct item more often than would happen by chance, indicating, according to the authors, that they were using statistical learning mechanisms to track co-occurrence probabilities across training trials.|$|E
25|$|In 1989, Christopher P. Earley {{hypothesized}} that social loafing would be mitigated in collectivist cultures that {{focused more on}} achievement of the group than the individual. He conducted {{a study in the}} United States and China, two polar opposites in terms of culture (with the U.S. being individualistic and China being collectivist), in order to determine if a difference in social loafing was present between the two types of cultures. Earley formed groups from both countries similar in demographics and in time spent with each other (participants in each of the groups had known each other for three to five weeks). Each group was tasked with completing various forms of paperwork similar to work they would be required to do in their profession. The paperwork was designed to take two to five minutes for each item, and the items were turned in to an assistant when completed so that no one could judge their work compared to others. Each <b>participant</b> <b>was</b> given 60 minutes to complete as many items as possible and was separated into either the high-accountability group, where they were told they needed to achieve a group goal, or a low-accountability group, where they were told they were to achieve a goal alone. They were also separated into high and low shared responsibility groups.|$|E
