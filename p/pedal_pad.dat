50|$|Nissan {{introduced}} {{a new version of}} the SE-R to the North American market for the 2007 model year. The SE-R is available in two versions: SE-R base and SE-R Spec V. Both get four-wheel disc brakes in place of the standard Sentra's disc/drum setup, unique interior and exterior trim and 17-inch alloy wheels. Both are powered by a redesigned 2.5-liter QR25DE engine. Each model also comes standard with a sport grille, lower body side sill extensions, rear spoiler, fog lights, chrome exhaust-tip finisher, smoked headlight surround and smoked taillights. Unique interior features include black sport seat cloth with red stitching and SE-R embroidered logos, sport metallic-tone accents, aluminium <b>pedal</b> <b>pads,</b> and twin pod meters with oil pressure and G-sensor displays.|$|R

40|$|This {{thesis is}} focused on the {{information}} that can be gained from examining diprotodontid forelimb and hindlimb anatomy in a morphological, functional, palaeobiological, and phylogenetic context. This research is complemented through a study of diprotodontid fossil trackways, allowing testing of the hypotheses developed through study of skeletal anatomy, as well as providing insights into the palaeobiology of taxa that are not evident through study of skeletal anatomy. The discovery of an articulated hindlimb of Euowenia grata, from the Warburton River, allowed an investigation of the functional capabilities of this taxon (Chapter 2). It is shown that the development of the graviportal limb morphology exemplified by Diprotodon optatum was already well underway during the early Pliocene in E. grata. It is also suggested that the hindlimb morphology of E. grata is indicative of the ability to rear up against trees. In addition, the pedal digits of Pliocene diprotodontines demonstrate a similar degree of reduction to that seen later Pleistocene taxa such as D. optatum. Pliocene trackways from the Warburton River in central Australia, representing the oldest known Australian mammal trackways, are described in Chapter 3. The track-maker is identified as Euowenia grata, and the six individual trackways indicate gregarious behaviour in this species. Similarities in trackway proportions and pad morphology demonstrate an affinity with D. optatum. Australiaâ€™s most speciose and best preserved fossil mammal trackway site is described in Chapter 4. The trackways provide information about palaeoecological species associations. Individual trackways at the site demonstrate that D. optatum had the ability to vary trackway gauge without significantly varying speed. The trackways also record important new information about manual and <b>pedal</b> <b>pad</b> morphology. Functional morphological analyses of the hindlimb and forelimb anatomy of diprotodontids are presented in Chapter 5. These investigations suggested that the plesiomorphic diprotodontids Ngapakaldia and Nimbadon may have been scansorial. This is more remarkable in the latter, given that all other Miocene diprotodontid taxa studied demonstrate distinct adaptations towards a terrestrial lifestyle. It was also found that the limbs of the Plio-Pleistocene diprotodontines (Euowenia and Diprotodon) may have been restricted to a locomotory role, whereas the limbs of the Pleistocene zygomaturine, Zygomaturus, were probably adapted for a wider range of functions including: moving over soft substrates, scratch-digging, defence and sexual competition. Phylogenetic analyses, based on hindlimb and forelimb morphology (undertaken in Chapter 6), demonstrated that significant homoplasy exists in the postcrania of the Diprotodontidae. Functional groupings arising from these analyses supported the hypothesis that Ngapakaldia and Nimbadon were scansorial. It was also found that forelimb and hindlimb morphological characters fail to consistently distinguish between the two diprotodontid subfamilies, instead forcing taxa to group based on their locomotory habits. The phylogenetic signal provided here by postcranial morphology consistently placed Ngapakaldia outside the other diprotodontids studied, and little or no evidence was found for uniting this taxon with Plio-Pleistocene diprotodontines. Postcranial morphology instead indicated that the most parsimonious phylogeny involves diprotodontines arising from within the Zygomaturinae during the middle Miocene, and suggests that Ngapakaldia should occupy a position basal to both diprotodontines and zygomaturines.

40|$|Performance of a {{secondary}} task, {{such as a}} cell phone conversation, may change attention to an automobile driving task. In this study, MEG imaging was applied to an automobile driving simulation paradigm to identify the cortical regions engaged in the primary driving task. Subjects viewed a driving video and responded (foot pedal) to red light stimuli (events) presented either centrally or peripherally in the driving scene. Cortical activation was imaged from MEG data averaged on the foot pedal response. MEG temporal resolution enabled the determination of sequential cortical activations. Orbital frontal gyrus activation was observed throughout the interval. Red light onset evoked occipital cortex activity {{that was followed by}} activation in the superior frontal gyrus and anterior cingulate gyrus. Peaks of motor and pre-motor cortex activation were detected during eye fixation movements (light on), and motor activity in the precentral gyrus preceding foot and leg activation of the <b>pedal</b> response <b>pad.</b> This action turned off the light and produced a visual evoked response in the occipital cortex. Occipital activation occurred when the light was turned off with the pedal response. These were brief intervals and correlated with known locations for visual and specific motor cortex locations. Frontal activation was dominant throughout this driving task with prominent peaks associated with the red light onset and the pedal push. Our findings suggest driving tasks recruit neural systems known to be involved in visual-motor multimodal processing and integration. The use of eventrelated MEG in investigating neural processing during simulated driving tasks is quite promising...|$|R
2500|$|The drum set for Rock Band {{features}} four rubber drum {{pads and}} a bass <b>pedal.</b> The <b>pads</b> have colored rings {{around the edges}} that correspond to the colored notes on-screen. These pads generally represent a snare drum (red), hi-hat/tom tom (yellow), ride cymbal/tom (blue), and crash cymbals/floor tom (green), though some songs may use the pads for other percussion instruments. [...] The pedal represents the bass drum (orange), with on-screen notes represented as orange horizontal lines across the on-screen drum track. To use the drum controller, players must strike the pads with drum sticks and press the bass pedal to match the scrolling notes on-screen. Drummers can improvise in special [...] "freestyle drum fill" [...] sections of songs, indicated by the on-screen columns for each note turning a solid color. The four pads will commonly change functionality to represent other drums, depending on the requirements of a song. The default pad order can be reversed using the [...] "Lefty Mode" [...] option in the game. The legs of the drum peripheral can adjust in height or be detached if the player wishes to place it on a table-top. The drum controller also features standard controller buttons {{in the middle of}} the peripheral for navigating in-game menus. Overdrive for drummers can be deployed by hitting the crash cymbal (green note for right-handed configuration) that appears directly after a freestyle drum fill. The second version of the controller, distributed with Rock Band 2, introduced quieter, [...] "velocity sensitive" [...] drum pads, a reinforced bass pedal, wireless capabilities, and compatibility with separately sold cymbals. ION Audio has also produced a premium drum kit that includes cymbals and can be upgraded with a drum brain to be used as an electronic drum kit.|$|R
