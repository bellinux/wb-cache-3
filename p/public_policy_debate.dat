2500|$|Historian Greg Grandin {{described}} a disjuncture between official ideals preached by the United States and actual U.S. support for terrorism. “Nicaragua, where the United States backed not a counter insurgent state but anti-communist mercenaries, likewise represented a disjuncture between the idealism {{used to justify}} U.S. policy and its support for political terrorism...The corollary to the idealism embraced by the Republicans {{in the realm of}} diplomatic <b>public</b> <b>policy</b> <b>debate</b> was thus political terror. In the dirtiest of Latin America’s dirty wars, their faith in America’s mission justified atrocities in the name of liberty”. Grandin examined the behaviour of the U.S.-backed contras and found evidence that it was particularly inhumane and vicious: [...] "In Nicaragua, the U.S.-backed Contras decapitated, castrated, and otherwise mutilated civilians and foreign aid workers. Some earned a reputation for using spoons to gorge their victims eye’s out. In one raid, Contras cut the breasts of a civilian defender to pieces and ripped the flesh off the bones of another.” ...|$|E
