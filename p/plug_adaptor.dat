40|$|In this paper, the {{development}} and characterization of a packaged pressure sensor system suitable for jet engine health monitoring is demonstrated. The sensing system operates from 97 to 117 MHz over a pressure range from 0 to 350 psi and a temperature range from 25 to 500 deg. The sensing system consists of a Clapp-type oscillator that is fabricated on an alumina substrate and is comprised of a Cree SiC MESFET, MIM capacitors, a wire-wound inductor, chip resistors and a SiCN capacitive pressure sensor. The pressure sensor {{is located in the}} LC tank circuit of the oscillator so that a change in pressure causes a change in capacitance, thus changing the resonant frequency of the sensing system. The chip resistors, wire-wound inductors and MIM capacitors have all been characterized at temperature and operational frequency, and perform with less than 5 % variance in electrical performance. The measured capacitive pressure sensing system agrees very well with simulated results. The packaged pressure sensing system is specifically designed to measure the pressure on a jet turbofan engine. The packaged system can be installed by way of borescope <b>plug</b> <b>adaptor</b> fitted to a borescope port exposed to the gas path of a turbofan engine...|$|E

50|$|Modems {{and other}} {{equipment}} supplied in Australia are nowadays normally provided with a modular <b>plug,</b> and an <b>adaptor</b> which connects only pair one, allowing the modular plug {{to be used with}} a 610 or 611 socket in need.

[...] Adaptors which allow the use of non-BS1363 plugs, or more than two BS1363 plugs, must be fused. Appliances are designed not to draw more power than their plug is rated for; the use of such adaptors, and also multi-socketed extension leads, makes it possible for several appliances to be connected through a single outlet, with the potential to cause dangerous overloads.|$|R

40|$|Despite {{what some}} people at Forbes may think (and no, Iâ€™m not going to link to that {{particular}} article), summer time for professors is not all margaritas and six-week vacations*.

Case in point, the Drew lab (well most of us anyway) are headed to Fiji in just under a month and there is a LOT of work to get done. Preparing for an expedition has always been one of my favorite parts of the trip. I love buying equipment, packing it up, and perhaps making internal references to that scene from Commando (except you know, with less automatic weapons).

50|$|Before the {{legislation}} of the Electrical Products Regulation (a few {{years prior to}} the handover in 1997), British standard extension cables, <b>plugs</b> and <b>adaptors</b> were seldom found in the market. Electrical appliances were fitted with 2-pin plugs and quasi-UK three pin plugs (which meant they were compatible with BS 1363 or BS 546 sockets, but the plug itself did not comply with the British Standard).|$|R

2500|$|BS1363, 13A <b>plugs</b> socket-outlets <b>adaptors</b> and {{connection}} units is a British Standard which specifies {{the most common}} type of single-phase AC power plugs and sockets that are used in the United Kingdom. Distinctive characteristics of the system are shutters on the neutral and [...] (see Concepts and Terminology below) socket holes, and a fuse in the plug. It has been adopted in many former British overseas territories. [...] BS1363 was introduced in 1947 as one of the new standards for electrical wiring in the United Kingdom used for post-war reconstruction. The plug and socket replaced the BS546 plug and socket, which are still found in old installations or in special applications. [...] BS1363 plugs have been designated as TypeG.|$|R
50|$|The main {{advantage}} of AppleTalk {{was that it}} was completely maintenance-free. To join a device to a network, you simply <b>plugged</b> the <b>adaptor</b> into the machine, then connected a cable from it to any free port on any other adaptor. AppleTalk's internal protocols negotiated a working network address number, automatically gave the computer a human-readable name, and collected up a list of the names and types of other machines on the network so the user could browse the devices through the GUI-based Chooser. AppleTalk was so easy to use that ad-hoc networks tended to appear whenever multiple Macs were in the same room. Apple would later use this in an advertisement showing a network being created between two seats in an airplane.|$|R
2500|$|Some {{appliances}} {{sold in the}} Soviet Union had a flat unearthed plug with {{an additional}} pass-through socket on the top, allowing a stacked arrangement of plugs. This design was very useful, because the usual Soviet apartment of the 1960s had very few sockets, but somewhat unsafe; [...] the brass cylinders of the secondary socket were uncovered at the ends (to {{allow them to be}} unscrewed easily), recessed by only 3mm, and provided bad contact because they relied on the secondary plug's bisected expanding pins. The pins of the secondary plug (which lacked insulation sleeves) could not be inserted into the cylindrical sockets completely, leaving a 5mm gap between the primary and secondary <b>plugs.</b> The <b>adaptors</b> were mostly used for low power appliances (for example, connecting both a table lamp and a radio to a socket).|$|R
5000|$|Ethernet {{had become}} almost {{universal}} by 1990, {{and it was}} time to build Ethernet into Macs direct from the factory. However, the physical wiring used by these networks was not yet completely standardized. Apple solved this problem using a single port on the back of the computer into which the user could <b>plug</b> an <b>adaptor</b> for any given cabling system. This FriendlyNet system was based on the industry-standard Attachment Unit Interface or AUI, but deliberately chose a non-standard connector that was smaller and easier to use, which they called [...] "Apple AUI", or AAUI. FriendlyNet was first introduced on the Quadra 700 and Quadra 900 computers, and used across much of the Mac line for some time. As with LocalTalk, a number of 3rd party FriendlyNet adaptors quickly appeared.|$|R

25|$|Older Japanese sockets and {{multi-plug}} adaptors are unpolarizedâ€”the {{slots in}} the sockets {{are the same}} sizeâ€”and will accept only unpolarized plugs. Japanese plugs generally fit into most North American sockets without modification, but polarized North American <b>plugs</b> may require <b>adaptors</b> or replacement non-polarized plugs to connect to older Japanese sockets. In Japan the voltage is 100 V, and the frequency is either 50Hz (East Japan) or 60Hz (West Japan) {{depending on whether the}} customer is located on the Osaka or Tokyo grid. Therefore, some North American devices which can be physically plugged into Japanese sockets may not function properly.|$|R
2500|$|Several early American {{electrical}} {{plug and socket}} arrangements were invented by Harvey Hubbell. On 26 February 1903 he filed two patent applications featuring 2-pin <b>plugs</b> and <b>adaptors</b> for using his plugs with existing designs of lamp sockets and wall receptacles. Hubbell's first plug design had two round pins which differed from those already in use in Europe in that {{the tips of the}} pins had annular detents similar to those of present-day jack plugs to positively retain a plug in its socket. [...] In one patent, US 774,250 a plug was used with a socket which screwed into a lampholder (like the early lampholder plugs). In the other patent US 776,326 [...] the same type of plug was used with various three-way adaptors that could be connected to lampholders or [...] "a receptacle of any ordinary type". Figures 2 and 4 of this patent show an <b>adaptor</b> <b>plugged</b> into {{what appears to be a}} [...] "Chapman" [...] receptacle. Hubbell evidently soon found the round pin design unsatisfactory as a subsequent patent US 774,251 filed on May 27, 1904 shows lampholder adaptors similar to those of his first patent for use with plugs having coplanar (tandem) flat pins. Hubbell's catalogue of 1906 includes various three-way adaptors similar to those shown in the US 776,326 patent, but modified for use with the coplanar flat pin plugs. The Chapman receptacle must have been in general use at the time, as it was the only type of non-lampholder receptacle for which adaptors were supplied. The 1906 catalogue says of the Chapman adaptor: [...] "The device avoids fastening the cords together as is necessary with the ordinary Chapman plug when used for more than one purpose." [...] This suggests that Hubbell's original invention was prompted by his observation of the problem that arose with the use of this sort of receptacle and plug. Gradually wall sockets were developed to supplement those that screwed into lampholders.|$|R
