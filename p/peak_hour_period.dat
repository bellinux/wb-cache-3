This project was focusing on time based program which is consists of Time of Use (ToU) and Real Time Pricing (RTP). Time of Use (ToU) utilize in providing customer with different unit prices for uses in different block of times in 24 hour period while Real Time Pricing (RTP) work in offering the price that fluctuates hourly based on changes in market price. In order to implement time based program in Malaysia, a proper scheme pricing have been proposed. Generally, Malaysia is a monopolized electricity market in which wholesale market price does not existed. Referring on the current scenario, this project was developed to investigate a different pricing schemes demand response model and thus proposing a new pricing scheme to accommodate monopolized market. A comparison of pricing scheme utilize between three different industrial consumers will be discussed and stipulated as the outcome in this research...|$|E
40|$|Stasiun Brambanan and Taman Wisata Candi {{intersection}} are {{two short}} separate intersections around Prambanan Temple. The distance of these intersections is only 436 m, while the traffic volume {{is too high}} and because of no signal coordination between these intersections, they lead to traffic congestion during peak hour. Therefore, the need for improvement by using traffic signal coordination between them is significant. The traffic micro simulation software of VISSIM was used to simulate the existing delay and to design traffic signal coordination. To obtain existing traffic volume during peak hour and off <b>peak</b> <b>hour</b> <b>period,</b> and to design a new cycle time for signal coordination, primary data were compiled according to direct observation. Result showed that the existing traffic route generates travel time of 57. 24 seconds and average traveling speed of 27. 42 kilometer/hour with the service level of “E” in <b>peak</b> <b>hour</b> <b>period.</b> The best alternative of cycle time for peak hours was 117 seconds, with average delay of 17. 65 seconds, travel time between intersection was 50. 99 seconds, average travel speed of 30. 78 kilometer/hour and the service level of “E”. Travel time from East leg at 1 st intersection onto East leg at 2 nd intersection (Yogya-Solo Routes) was 31. 73 seconds, delay of 15. 57 seconds, average travel speed of 49. 47 kilometer/hour with the service level of “E”. On off <b>peak</b> <b>hour</b> <b>period,</b> the existing average delay was 19. 59 seconds, average travel time of 39, 6 seconds and average speed of 39. 64 kilometer/hour with the service level of “E”.

Travel time from East leg at 1 st intersection onto 2 nd intersection was 27. 25 seconds, delay of 14. 83 seconds, average travel speed of 57. 60 kilometer/hour with the service level of “D”.

As demand is increasing day by day, the generation cannot be increased with matching of demands because fossil fuel is restricted and cost factors are there. The load area are far away from generation side so only one possibility to give the power to load area by minimizing the losses of transmission lines by proper analyzing of transient stability. The voltage stability is not match standard values for all period of times when the line is heavily loaded severe transient oscillations will occurs. In <b>peak</b> <b>hour</b> <b>period,</b> at that period if fault is also occurred due to unbalance current flow through the transmission network as a result a severe voltage oscillation occurred in transmission lines.

40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} {{generalized}} model {{to estimate the}} <b>peak</b> <b>hour</b> origin-destination (OD) traffic demand variation from day-to-day hourly traffic counts throughout the whole year. Different from the conventional OD estimation methods, the proposed modeling approach aims to estimate not only the mean but also the variation (in terms of covariance matrix) of the OD demands during the same <b>peak</b> <b>hour</b> <b>periods</b> due to day-to-day fluctuation over the whole year. For this purpose, this paper fully considers the first- and second-order statistical properties of the day-to-day hourly traffic count data so as to capture the stochastic characteristics of the OD demands. The proposed model is formulated as a bi-level optimization problem. In the upper-level problem, a weighted least squares method is used to estimate the mean and covariance matrix of the OD demands. In the lower-level problem, a reliability-based traffic assignment model is adopted {{to take account of}} travelers' risk-taking path choice behaviors under OD demand variation. A heuristic iterative estimation-assignment algorithm is proposed for solving the bi-level optimization problem.

In this study, a carbon monoxide wireless sensor network (CO-WSN) was developed to measure carbon monoxide concentrations at a major traffic intersection near the University of Cincinnati main campus.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} was to address the shortcomings of the daily activity schedule model and introduce changes in the model system in order to more fully utilize the potential benefits of such a system. The major problem with the previously developed model was its full reliance on the sequential procedure to estimate the system of nested logit models. Such a procedure can cause the coefficient estimates of the models not to be asymptotically efficient. In addition, the estimation procedure overestimates the t-statistics of these coefficients, thereby giving the illusion that some of these variables might be significant and important, when in reality they are not. The model also encounters other problems when data used in the estimation process is not collected in a purely random manner. ^ This research has also used the improved model system in order to investigate what might happen in the event there are changes in the transportation system.

Traffic growth in Cimahi is caused by industrialisation and urbanisation which represent the main factor of increasing population and travel demand in Cimahi. The Local Government of Cimahi has started to avoid congestion by improving infrastructure facilities or other traffic management. Traffic assignment in four-step modelling is carried out as a basic to simulate the traffic management system. Traffic congestion generally happens especially in peak periods caused by the increasing number of private cars.
