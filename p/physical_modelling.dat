25|$|The {{synthesis}} of urea by Friedrich Wöhler {{opened a new}} research field, organic chemistry, {{and by the end}} of the 19th century, scientists were able to synthesize hundreds of organic compounds. The later part of the 19th century saw the exploitation of the Earth's petrochemicals, after the exhaustion of the oil supply from whaling. By the 20th century, systematic production of refined materials provided a ready supply of products which provided not only energy, but also synthetic materials for clothing, medicine, and everyday disposable resources. Application of the techniques of organic chemistry to living organisms resulted in physiological chemistry, the precursor to biochemistry. The 20th century also saw the integration of physics and chemistry, with chemical properties explained as the result of the electronic structure of the atom. Linus Pauling's book on The Nature of the Chemical Bond used the principles of quantum mechanics to deduce bond angles in ever-more complicated molecules. Pauling's work culminated in the <b>physical</b> <b>modelling</b> of DNA, the secret of life (in the words of Francis Crick, 1953). In the same year, the Miller–Urey experiment demonstrated in a simulation of primordial processes, that basic constituents of proteins, simple amino acids, could themselves be built up from simpler molecules.|$|E

The 3D engine was described as [...] "impressive", {{but the lack of}} a link-up multiplayer mode was criticised. Ed Lomag of Computer and Video Games lauded the improved car mechanics and track design and also liked that the UK PAL version runs in full screen at a full frame rate, thus proving British developers could make decent British PlayStation games. Despite these compliments, he criticised the game's limited re-playability. The Electric Playground complimented the scenery and damage effects. Game Revolution described the Stock Car Racing as [...] "almost perfect", and the tracks as [...] "extremely cool", but criticised the steering sensitivity. Absolute PlayStation described the game as a [...] "vast improvement" [...] over the original, but said the gameplay is identical and [...] "rather shallow". IGN believed that the game compensates too much for the lack of difficulty of the first game through an overly aggressive artificial intelligence and by making it [...] "impossible" [...] {{to catch up with the}} other cars. Despite this, they praised the car physics and graphics. Jeuxvideo.com praised the playability of the game and the soundtrack, but criticised the commentary as [...] "repetitive". Gamezilla's Mark Skorupa described the graphics as [...] "top notch", but also said that it breaks what was good in the original game. Andrew Collins of the Official UK PlayStation Magazine believed the features are [...] "massively improved" [...] over the original, and said its [...] "superbly polished" [...] gameplay made it one of the best PlayStation racing games. His main criticism was that he thought the Destruction Derby Practice mode can make players complacent.|$|E

40|$|The reuse of {{mathematical}} <b>models</b> of <b>physical</b> phenomena, here called <b>physical</b> <b>models,</b> within simulations is attractive {{because it has}} the potential of improving simulation results while reducing implementation and testing work. In practice, however, it can be complicated to reuse a model that was originally developed for other studies and applications. It becomes even more difficult when multiple stakeholders have different ideas on how to use and extend the <b>physical</b> <b>model.</b> An attractive approach to deal with this problem is to develop and maintain a multi-resolution <b>physical</b> <b>model</b> that can be reused for different purposes. A multi-resolution model is a model that represents a system or phenomenon at different levels of fidelity simultaneously. On the process side, such an approach requires a policy for managing the use, the support and the development of the multi-resolution <b>physical</b> <b>model.</b> On the more technical side, a multi-resolution <b>physical</b> <b>model</b> requires a model specification that maintains all internal and external relationships while providing interoperability. Focusing on the reusability of <b>physical</b> <b>models,</b> this paper presents and analyzes two examples of multi-resolution <b>physical</b> <b>models</b> from different domains and discusses how they are used in different simulations. The examples concern the modeling and use of (1) a missile model, including its different components, and (2) a signal propagation model in an underwater environment. The examples show the global approach of how multi-resolution <b>physical</b> <b>models</b> can be used. Based on the experiences of modeling and simulation experts and <b>physical</b> <b>modeling</b> experts, this paper presents our guidelines and recommendations on how to facilitate the use of multi resolution <b>physical</b> <b>models</b> in simulations. These guidelines are structured according to the different software development phases, and help to improve the reusability and utility of <b>physical</b> <b>models...</b>|$|R

40|$|The {{study of}} the dynamic {{behaviour}} of concrete dams {{by means of the}} <b>physical</b> <b>model</b> method is very useful to understand the failure mechanism of these structures to action of the strong earthquakes. <b>Physical</b> <b>model</b> method consists in two main processes. Firstly, a study model must be designed by a <b>physical</b> <b>modeling</b> process using the dynamic modeling theory. The result is a equations system of dimensioning the <b>physical</b> <b>model.</b> After the construction and instrumentation of the scale <b>physical</b> <b>model</b> a structural analysis based on experimental means is performed.

40|$|Designers use various {{representations}} to externalize their ideas, <b>physical</b> <b>models</b> {{being an}} important one. <b>Physical</b> <b>models</b> {{are widely used}} by designers and their use is promoted as an effective design tool by industry and government agencies. However, very {{little is known about}} the cognitive effects of <b>physical</b> <b>models</b> in the design process; the available guidelines are conflicting. Some researchers argue for the frequent implementation of <b>physical</b> <b>models,</b> while others observe that the use of <b>physical</b> <b>models</b> fixates designers. In light of these conflicts, the research discussed in this dissertation focuses on understanding the cognitive effects of <b>physical</b> <b>models</b> and developing guidelines for aiding designers in their implementation. A combination of controlled lab studies and qualitative studies is adopted to achieve said goal. The results from the controlled studies show that <b>physical</b> <b>models</b> supplement designers? erroneous mental models and help them to come up with more ideas satisfying the problem requirements. These studies also demonstrate that design fixation is not inherent in <b>physical</b> <b>modeling,</b> but it is caused by the Sunk Cost Effect. According to Sunk Cost Effect, as designers spend more time building <b>physical</b> <b>models</b> of their initial ideas, they tend to fixate more to the variations of those ideas. A qualitative study on industry-sponsored projects and development cases of award-winning products further supports these results in more realistic situations. Further, the studies reported in this dissertation show that <b>physical</b> <b>models</b> can be effective tools for the mitigation of fixation to undesirable design features in a flawed example; however, these results can also depend upon the experience level of a designer in solving open-ended design problems. With these insights from the series of studies, a set of guidelines and a Model Error Reeducation Method (MERM) are formulated and tested with novice designers. MERM helps designers in identifying critical loads and interface designs they miss in their original designs, before prototyping. The results from the testing of this method show that this method is very useful in avoiding said errors in <b>physical</b> <b>modeling...</b>|$|R
