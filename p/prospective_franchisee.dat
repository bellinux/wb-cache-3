40|$|Purpose - The {{divergent}} {{interests of}} franchisor and franchisee {{give rise to}} significant ex-post conflict following {{the purchase of a}} franchise. Australian regulators have sought to assist transparency in franchising decision making by legislating for disclosure documents that expose key variables that theoretically determine choice on the part of prospective franchisees. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to explore the value proposition of the disclosure document and tests its normative effectiveness using a signal-theoretic perspective. Design/methodology/approach - Potential investors were asked to consider selected attributes through a choice-based survey, consistent with consumer theory, and focussing on an attribute-based determination of value. However, complex decision making in general and choice modeling can place severe cognitive burdens on respondents and induce satisficing rather than maximizing behavioral patterns. Best-worst scaling (BWS) provided a means for potential purchasers to respond coherently. Findings - Findings indicate limited capacity for potential investors to rationalize the simplistic choices presented, suggesting that franchise choice is determined to a large degree by non-rational factors. Research limitations/implications - This research is embryonic (exploratory) in nature with the findings providing an imperative for further investigation into workable attributes of franchise systems. Analysis is limited to prospective franchisees' perceptions and needs to be triangulated with franchisor and policy-makers perspectives. Practical implications - Both franchisors and policy makers can utilize this research to improve transparency in the disclosure document. Prospective franchisees should then be able to make more effective decisions about the franchise systems of choice. Social implications - A reduction in conflict within the franchising sector (no matter how trivial) will improve the business operations, franchisee and employee welfare throughout the sector. Progress on this topic will improve the sustainability and overall attractiveness of the sector. Originality/value - Conjoint analysis has not been used previously in franchising research. The use of BWS on <b>prospective</b> <b>franchisee</b> perceptions is innovative providing a basis for much research to be done in this field of research.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{consists of}} three essays, of which two are related. In the first essay I model the interaction between a franchisor and its franchisees. I examine how a franchisor uses the investment requirements she asks franchisees {{as a tool to}} reduce franchisees' underprovision of sales effort. Theoretically, I show that if the franchisor's reputation is highly important the franchisor asks for higher investment requirements when penalizing a misbehaving franchise is more difficult (weaker law enforcement) and when directly monitoring franchisees is more costly. In the second essay, I empirically test the theoretical predictions of the first essay using two datasets at the franchisor level. I measure weak law enforcement using the passing of state level good-cause termination/nonrenewal laws for franchise contracts and I measure monitoring costs using the number of states in which a franchisor operates. Using a database that contains information for 278 franchisors, before and after the laws were passed in some states, I find that the passing of the laws implied an incremental 4. 7 % increase in investment requirements for franchisors located in states where the laws were passed. Using a large database (10, 047 franchisor-year observations), posterior to the passing of the laws, I find that franchisors located in states where good-cause termination/nonrenewal laws were passed ask for investment requirements 4. 5 % higher than franchisors located in states without such laws. Using both datasets I find evidence that franchisors that expand their operations to an additional state increase the average investment requirements they ask a <b>prospective</b> <b>franchisee</b> between 0. 6 - 1 %. The third essay, which is in conjunction with Gordon Phillips, empirically studies how financial distress and bankruptcy affects firms' choices of product quality and prices using data from the airline industry. We find that an airline's quality and pricing decisions are differentially affected by financial distress and bankruptcy. Product quality decreases when airlines are in financial distress, consistent with financial distress reducing a firm's incentive to invest in quality. In addition, firms price more aggressively when in financial distress consistent with them trying to increase short-term market share and revenues. In contrast, in bankruptcy product quality increases relative to financial distress periods...|$|E

The Finnish franchisee training program is an answer to this need. It is a unique training given to <b>prospective</b> <b>franchisees</b> by a third party. The program aims to find people interested in franchising and to give them the essential skills and knowledge a franchisee needs. Additional goal is to help the trainees to choose a franchise. The organizing parties behind the programs are the government owned Employment and Economic Development Centres and a private consultation company specialised in franchising. The training program enables franchisors to concentrate on system specific training, while it strives for providing the participants with a realistic view of the time, financial and skills demands of franchise ownership and self-employment. Therefore, the program serves both franchisors and <b>prospective</b> <b>franchisees.</b> The first program was organised in 1999 in Helsinki.
