40|$|This study {{treated the}} {{high-tech}} industry as the subjects and probes into the correlation among organizational cultures, information technology involvement, degrees of knowledge management activities {{and performance of}} new <b>product</b> <b>developments.</b> The subjects of this research were Taiwan’s high-tech firms in the Hsinchu Science-Based Industrial Park and Southern Taiwan Science-Based Industrial Park. The respondents were the project members or senior managers involved, currently or previously, in the <b>development</b> of new <b>products.</b> The design of the questionnaire items was based on literature review. The results reveal that the higher the degrees of information technology involvement and organizational cultures, the more significant the influence on the implementation of knowledge management activities and performances of new <b>product</b> <b>developments.</b> The better the implementation of knowledge management activities, the stronger the positive influence {{on the performance of}} new <b>product</b> <b>developments.</b> Different organization cultural types (i. e., rational cultures, hierarchical cultures, group cultures and developmental cultures) do not report any significantly different levels of influence on the implementation of knowledge management activities or performance of new <b>product</b> <b>developments.</b> This study suggested that to enhance the performance of new <b>product</b> <b>developments,</b> it is necessary to strengthen information technology involvement and the implementation of knowledge management activities, as well as to integrate the characteristics of the four cultural types in the competing values framework and to enhance the implementation under these four cultural types...|$|R

5|$|A {{simplified}} {{version of}} the model was popularized by Paul Krugman in the 1990s in his book Peddling Prosperity. In this set up there are two firms, one foreign and one domestic which are considering entering a new export market in a third country (or possibly the whole world). The demand in the export market is such that if only one firm enters, {{it will make a}} profit, but if they both enter each will make a loss, perhaps because of initial set up, infrastructure, <b>product</b> <b>development,</b> marketing or other fixed costs of entry. The matrix below presents a stylized example of the game that the two firms are engaged in.|$|E
5|$|Financial data of Lexus {{operations}} are not disclosed publicly. However, automotive analysts {{estimate that the}} Lexus division contributes {{a disproportionate share of}} Toyota's profits, relative to its limited production and sales volume. Interviews with retired division officials indicate that depending on sales volume, vehicle <b>product</b> <b>development</b> cycles, and exchange rates, Lexus sales have accounted for as much as half of Toyota's annual U.S. profit in certain years. Division executives have employed pricing strategies aimed at sustaining profit margins rather than sales volume, with historically fewer price incentives than rival brands. In 2006, Lexus entered Interbrand's list of the Top 100 Global Brands for the first time, with an estimated brand value of approximately $3 billion annually. In 2009, Interbrand ranked Lexus as Japan's seventh largest brand, between Panasonic and Nissan, based on revenue, earnings, and market value.|$|E
5|$|In January 1990, Gassée {{resigned}} and his authority over <b>product</b> <b>development</b> was divided among several successors. Many Apple engineers {{had long been}} pressing for lower-cost options {{in order to build}} market share and increase demand across the entire price spectrum. With Gassée out, a rush started to quickly introduce a series of low-cost machines. Three market points were identified, a very low-cost machine aimed at costing $1,000, a low-cost machine with color graphics, and a more upscale color machine for small business use. In time, these would develop as the Classic, Macintosh LC, and Macintosh IIsi. Unlike the '020 and '030 based models, the Macintosh Classic has the original Macintosh startup sound.|$|E

5|$|Market {{and brand}} focused {{organizations}} {{are concerned with}} the expression and perception of the corporate brand. Corporate design management implements, develops, and maintains the corporate identity, or brand. This type of brand management is strongly anchored in the organization to control and influence corporate design activities. The design program plays the role of a quality program within many fields of the organization to achieve uniform internal branding. It is strongly linked to strategy, corporate culture, <b>product</b> <b>development,</b> marketing, organizational structure, and technological development. Achieving a consistent corporate brand requires the involvement of designers and a widespread design awareness among employees. A creative culture, knowledge sharing processes, determination, design leadership, and good work relations support the work of corporate brand management.|$|E

Nokian Tyres PLC shares were floated on the Helsinki Stock Exchange (OMX Helsinki) in 1995. Nokia, which became the largest mobile telephone manufacturer in 1998, ended its ownership interest in Nokian Tyres in 2003, selling its holding of 2 million shares to Bridgestone Europe NV/SA, {{a subsidiary of the}} Japanese tyre manufacturer Bridgestone, for U.S. $73.2 million. This made Bridgestone the largest shareholder, with an 18.9% stake, later diluted to 16.8%. Bridgestone announced that Nokian Tyres would be operated independently, but it would consider complementing the company's <b>product</b> <b>development,</b> testing, and distribution.|$|E
5|$|The {{game with}} no {{government}} subsidy {{to the domestic}} firm is shown in Figure 1 on the left. If both firms enter, they each suffer a loss of 10 million dollars and if they both {{stay out of the}} market neither firm makes a profit or a loss. If only one firm enters however, that firm will realize a profit of 50 million dollars while the other firm will make nothing. The two Nash equilibria of this game (marked in purple) are the situations in which only one firm enters – but which firm, domestic or foreign, is indeterminate. In such a situation if the foreign firm has a slight initial advantage over the domestic firm (perhaps because it began <b>product</b> <b>development</b> earlier) the domestic firm will stay out and the foreign firm will enter.|$|E
