5|$|His {{introduction}} to films was unusual. When visiting an aunt {{who lived in}} Brooklyn opposite Vitagraph Studios, Cagney would climb over the fence to watch the filming of John Bunny movies. He became involved in amateur dramatics, starting as a scenery boy for a Chinese pantomime at Lenox Hill Neighborhood House, {{one of the first}} settlement houses in the nation, where his brother Harry performed and his soon-to-be friend, Florence James, directed. He was initially content working behind the scenes and had no interest in performing. One night, however, Harry became ill, and although Cagney was not an understudy, his photographic memory of rehearsals enabled him to stand in for his brother without making a single mistake. Therefore, Florence James has the unique distinction of being the first director to <b>put</b> <b>him</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> stage. Afterward, he joined a number of companies as a performer in a variety of roles.|$|E
25|$|Another boy, Alexander Petrovich Zhelobkovich (1930–1994), who was 12 {{years old}} at the time, also survived. When the Nazi {{soldiers}} almost surrounded the village, his mother woke him up and <b>put</b> <b>him</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> horse, on which he escaped to a nearby village. After the war, he served in the armed forces and later became a reserve lieutenant colonel.|$|E
25|$|Ahatallah made {{a strong}} {{impression}} on the native clergy, but the Portuguese quickly decided he was an impostor, and <b>put</b> <b>him</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> ship bound for Europe by way of Goa. Archdeacon Thomas, desperate for a new ecclesiastical leader to free his people from the Padroado, travelled to Cochin and demanded to meet Ahatallah and examine his credentials. The Portuguese refused, stating the ship had already left for Goa. Ahatallah was never heard from in India again, inspiring rumours that the Portuguese had murdered him and inflaming anti-Portuguese sentiments even more.|$|E

5000|$|In {{the light}} of his growing {{influence}} within al-Qaeda, the United States classified Hamza Bin Laden as Specially Designated Global Terrorist in January 2017. This effectively <b>puts</b> <b>him</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> blacklist aimed at restricting his movement and economic abilities.|$|R
25|$|In {{the final}} {{season of the}} WHA, Gordie had the {{opportunity}} to play with Wayne Gretzky in the 1979 WHA All-Star Game. The format of the game was a three-game series between the WHA All-Stars against HC Dynamo Moscow. The WHA All-Stars were coached by Jacques Demers, and Demers asked Howe if it was okay to <b>put</b> <b>him</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> line with Gretzky and his son Mark. In Game One, the line scored seven points, as the WHA All-Stars won by a score of 4–2. In Game Two, Gretzky and Mark Howe each scored a goal and Gordie Howe picked up an assist as the WHA won 4–2. WHA also won Game Three to ensure a clean sweep.|$|E
25|$|Once in Rome, Vanunu and Bentov took {{a taxi to}} an {{apartment}} in the old quarter of the city, where three waiting Mossad operatives overpowered Vanunu and injected him with a paralyzing drug. Later that night, a white van hired by the Israeli embassy arrived, and Vanunu was carried to it on a stretcher. The van drove to La Spezia, where the agents took Vanunu to a dock, bound him to a stretcher, and <b>put</b> <b>him</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> waiting speedboat, which then rendezvoused with the waiting Noga anchored off the coast. The crew of the Noga were told to assemble in the ship's common room and lock the door as Vanunu and the Mossad agents were taken aboard. The ship then departed for Israel.|$|E
25|$|The {{imperial}} {{factor was}} a double-edged sword: Rhodes {{did not want}} the bureaucrats of the Colonial Office in London to interfere in the Empire in Africa. He wanted British settlers and local politicians and governors to run it. This <b>put</b> <b>him</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> collision course with many in Britain, as well as with British missionaries, who favoured what they saw as the more ethical direct rule from London. Rhodes prevailed because he would pay the cost of administering the territories to the north of South Africa against his future mining profits. The Colonial Office did not have enough funding for this. Rhodes promoted his business interests as in the strategic interest of Britain: preventing the Portuguese, the Germans or the Boers from moving into south-central Africa. Rhodes' companies and agents cemented these advantages by obtaining many mining concessions, as exemplified by the Rudd and Lochner Concessions.|$|E
5000|$|In 1854, {{the village}} was struck by an {{epidemic}} of smallpox, which killed 257 residents.

50|$|He {{moved to}} Toronto {{to return to}} his roots and was chosen {{to play the role of}} Trevor Lemonde in a short running CBC show called MVP. The show {{garnered}} attention for the actor, <b>putting</b> <b>him</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> giant billboard in his underwear in Times Square.|$|R
5000|$|In August 2015, The Sun <b>on</b> Sunday {{published}} <b>a</b> {{video of}} Vardy at a casino the previous month, calling {{a man of}} East Asian origin a [...] "Jap".

25|$|NBC {{chose to}} {{continue}} the Late Night franchise, and {{at the suggestion of}} Saturday Night Live producer Lorne Michaels, hired Conan O'Brien, a relatively unknown writer for The Simpsons, to take over the time slot beginning in late 1993. Late Night with Conan O'Brien was constantly at risk for cancellation in its early years; at one low point in 1994, NBC threatened to <b>put</b> <b>him</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> week-to-week contract. Executives were anxious to replace him with Greg Kinnear, who followed O'Brien with Later at 1:30am., but Kinnear left to pursue a career in acting later on. Interns filled empty seats in the audience while affiliates began to inquire about replacement hosts. Things improved for the show slowly (mostly revolving around O'Brien's performance) and by 1996, O'Brien's audience, largely young and male (a coveted demographic), grew steadily and the show began to best competitors in the ratings, which it would continue to do for 15 years.|$|E
500|$|From 1909 to 1912, Kilmer was {{employed}} by Funk and Wagnalls, which was preparing an edition of The Standard Dictionary {{that would be}} published in 1912. According to Hillis, Kilmer's job [...] "was to define ordinary words assigned to him at five cents for each word defined. This was a job at which one would ordinarily earn ten to twelve dollars a week, but Kilmer attacked the task with such vigor and speed that it was soon thought wisest to <b>put</b> <b>him</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> regular salary." ...|$|E
500|$|Butcher {{abandoned}} {{the history of}} Buffalo and Dawson counties after spending {{more than a thousand}} dollars on the project. [...] Discontented with his profession as photographer, which had failed to make him a fortune or even to <b>put</b> <b>him</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> sound financial footing, he turned his efforts elsewhere. [...] In 1911, he turned the Kearney studio over to his son and began work as an agent for the Standard Land Company. [...] He gave stereopticon lectures throughout Buffalo and Dawson counties promoting the company's irrigated lands in south Texas, and made plans to move there himself.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Put</b> <b>him</b> <b>on</b> <b>an</b> {{unauthorized}} list {{of people}} to be detained without judicial warrant {{in the event of}} a national emergency, and designated him as a [...] "Key Activist" [...] whose political activities should be [...] "disrupted" [...] and [...] "neutralized" [...] under the bureau's illegal counterintelligence program known as COINTELPRO.|$|R
5000|$|The latter {{category}} {{also included}} the [...] "personal prisoners of the Führer" [...] - {{opponents of the}} regime too prominent to be killed outright, {{as well as people}} like Hitler's failed assassin Georg Elser, who was initially kept alive with the intention of <b>putting</b> <b>him</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> show trial after the war.|$|R
50|$|Sawyer was {{dismissed}} as {{a suspect in the}} case when officials learned that he could prove he had been in Osceola, Iowa, {{on the night of the}} murders.

500|$|Once {{his junior}} season at Cornell ended, Nieuwendyk joined the {{national}} team for five games before turning professional with the Flames. [...] He made his NHL debut on March 10, 1987, against the Washington Capitals and scored his first NHL goal against goaltender Pete Peeters. He appeared in nine regular season games in the 1986–87 NHL season, scoring five goals and one assist, and appeared in six playoff games. Playing his first full season in 1987–88, Nieuwendyk {{captured the attention of}} the sports media by scoring 32 goals in his first 42 games to <b>put</b> <b>him</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> pace to surpass Mike Bossy's rookie record of 53 goals. [...] Nieuwendyk finished two goals short of Bossy's record, but led the team with 51 goals and was the second first-year player to score at least 50 goals in one season. [...] He played in his first NHL All-Star Game, was named to the All-Rookie Team and was voted the winner of the Calder Memorial Trophy as the NHL's top rookie.|$|E
500|$|A {{major concern}} with the second act was the {{effectiveness}} of the characters He and She (later called by Rodgers [...] "Mr. and Mrs. God"), before whom Billy appeared after his death. Mr. and Mrs. God were depicted as a New England minister and his wife, seen in their parlor. The couple was still part of the show at the Boston opening. Rodgers said to Hammerstein, [...] "We've got to get God out of that parlor". When Hammerstein inquired where he should put the deity, Rodgers replied, [...] "I don't care where you put Him. <b>Put</b> <b>Him</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> ladder for all I care, only get Him out of that parlor!" [...] Hammerstein duly put Mr. God (renamed the Starkeeper) atop a ladder, and Mrs. God was removed from the show. Rodgers biographer Meryle Secrest terms this change a mistake, leading to a more fantastic afterlife, which was later criticized by The New Republic as [...] "a Rotarian atmosphere congenial to audiences who seek not reality but escape from reality, not truth but escape from truth".|$|E
500|$|By late August 1943, Hartmann had 90 aerial victories. On 19 August, {{in combat}} with Il-2s, his {{aircraft}} was damaged by debris, {{and he was}} forced to land behind Soviet lines. Hartmann's Geschwaderkommodore, Dietrich Hrabak, had given orders to Hartmann's unit to support the dive bombers of Sturzkampfgeschwader 2, led by the famous Stuka pilot Hans-Ulrich Rudel in a counter-attack. The situation had changed, and the flight of eight German fighters engaged a mass of Soviet Yakovlev Yak-9 and Lavochkin La-5 fighter aircraft that were protecting Il-2 Sturmoviks on a ground-attack mission. Hartmann shot down two enemy aircraft before his fighter was hit by debris and {{he was forced to}} make an emergency landing. He then, in accordance with Luftwaffe regulations, attempted to recover the precision board clock. As he was doing so, Soviet ground troops approached. Realising that capture was unavoidable, he faked internal injuries. Hartmann's acting so convinced the Soviets that they <b>put</b> <b>him</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> stretcher and placed him on a truck. When Hartmann's Crew Chief, Heinz [...] "Bimmel" [...] Mertens, heard what had happened, he took a rifle and went to search for Hartmann.|$|E
5000|$|Hodge {{was raised}} in Harlem and the Bronx.

500|$|Mota {{never played}} a game with the Red Sox, as on January 27, 2006, he {{was traded to the}} Cleveland Indians with Andy Marte, Kelly Shoppach, a player to be named later (eventually Randy Newsom), and cash {{considerations}} for Coco Crisp, David Riske, and Josh Bard. The trade was postponed slightly because Mota failed to pass a physical, so the Indians <b>put</b> <b>him</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> conditioning program before spring training. However, he was still expected to be the setup man for closer Bob Wickman. He started the season well, as he did not allow an earned run in his first seven games. However, he struggled after that, and he lost the setup role to Rafael Betancourt in May. Over his next 27 games, Mota had a 7.89 ERA, and opponents batted [...]314 against him. On August 11, he was designated for assignment after he had a 1–3 record with a 6.21 ERA in 34 games. On August 20, he was traded to the New York Mets with cash for a player to be named later. To date, his time with the Indians was his only stint in the American League.|$|E
2500|$|Actors {{who were}} {{considered}} for the part of [...] "Withnail" [...] included Daniel Day-Lewis, Bill Nighy and Kenneth Branagh. Robinson claims that he told Richard E.

2500|$|On the whole, antiquity looked favourably on Sallust as a historian.
