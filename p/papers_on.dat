5|$|After the war {{he became}} a {{champion}} of nuclear nonproliferation. He wrote for the Bulletin of Atomic Scientists, and helped found the Federation of American Scientists and the Institute for Defense and Disarmament Studies. He {{was one of the}} few ex-communists to remain employed and academically active throughout the 1950s, but his research turned away from nuclear physics towards astrophysics. He published <b>papers</b> <b>on</b> cosmic rays, and a 1958 paper of his is considered to mark the birth of gamma ray astronomy. He was also known for writing popular science books and articles, and appearing in television programs.|$|E
5|$|After this, Lemoine {{published}} another {{series of}} papers, including {{a series on}} what he called transformation continue (continuous transformation), which related mathematical equations to geometrical objects. This meaning stood separately from the modern definition of transformation. His <b>papers</b> <b>on</b> this subject included, Sur les transformations systématiques des formules relatives au triangle (1891), Étude sur une nouvelle transformation continue (1891), Une règle d'analogies dans le triangle et la spécification de certaines analogies à une transformation dite transformation continue (1893), and Applications au tétraèdre de la transformation continue (1894).|$|E
5|$|Bethe {{entered the}} University of Munich in April 1926, where Sommerfeld took him on {{as a student}} on Meissner's recommendation. Sommerfeld taught an {{advanced}} course on differential equations in physics, which Bethe enjoyed. Because {{he was such a}} renowned scholar, Sommerfeld frequently received advance copies of scientific papers, which he put up for discussion at weekly evening seminars. When Bethe arrived, Sommerfeld had just received Erwin Schrödinger's <b>papers</b> <b>on</b> wave mechanics.|$|E

These papers documented studies of field strength and noise {{over a wide}} range of frequencies and stressed the importance of the signal to noise ratio (SNR) in receivers rather than simple field strength.|$|R

5|$|During {{his tenure}} as a civil engineer, Lemoine wrote a {{treatise}} concerning compass and straightedge constructions entitled, La Géométrographie ou l'art des constructions géométriques, which he considered his greatest work, {{despite the fact that}} it was not well-received critically. The original title was De la mesure de la simplicité dans les sciences mathématiques, and the original idea for the text would have discussed the concepts Lemoine devised as concerning the entirety of mathematics. Time constraints, however, limited the scope of the paper. Instead of the original idea, Lemoine proposed a simplification of the construction process to a number of basic operations with the compass and straightedge. He presented this paper at a meeting of the Association Française in Oran, Algeria in 1888. The paper, however, did not garner much enthusiasm or interest among the mathematicians gathered there. Lemoine published several other <b>papers</b> <b>on</b> his construction system that same year, including Sur la mesure de la simplicité dans les constructions géométriques in the Comptes rendus of the Académie française. He published additional <b>papers</b> <b>on</b> the subject in Mathesis (1888), Journal des mathématiques élémentaires (1889), Nouvelles annales de mathématiques (1892), and the self-published La Géométrographie ou l'art des constructions géométriques, which was presented at the meeting of the Association Française in Pau (1892), and again at Besançon (1893) and Caen (1894).|$|E
5|$|For {{most of his}} life, Lemoine was a {{professor}} of mathematics at the École Polytechnique. In later years, {{he worked as a}} civil engineer in Paris, and he also took an amateur's interest in music. During his tenure at the École Polytechnique and as a civil engineer, Lemoine published several <b>papers</b> <b>on</b> mathematics, most of which are included in a fourteen-page section in Nathan Altshiller Court's College Geometry. Additionally, he founded a mathematical journal titled, L'Intermédiaire des Mathématiciens.|$|E
5|$|Gorbachev began {{a period}} of {{internal}} economic restructuring, known as perestroika, and agreed {{to a series of}} summits with the American president. Matlock was instrumental in preparing Reagan for his first summit with Gorbachev, arranging for specialists within the government to write a “Soviet Union 101” course of 21 <b>papers</b> <b>on</b> Russia for Reagan to study. Matlock also participated in a mock summit, playing the role of Gorbachev, allowing Reagan to practice the encounter in advance.|$|E

5000|$|In 1928 he {{published}} a monograph on the chemistry and physics of sea water, and in 1933 a classic <b>paper</b> <b>on</b> {{the rate of}} diatom growth. With three colleagues he wrote a seminal <b>paper</b> <b>on</b> plankton and its control.|$|R
50|$|Clark's key {{contributions}} {{have been}} in the field of logic programming. His 1978 <b>paper</b> <b>on</b> negation as failure was arguably the first formalisation of a non-monotonic logic. His 1981 <b>paper</b> <b>on</b> a relational language for parallel programming introduced concurrent logic programming.|$|R
5|$|He {{is remembered}} {{in the plant}} genera Candollea and Candolleodendron, several plant species like Eugenia candolleana or Diospyros candolleana and the {{mushroom}} Psathyrella candolleana. Candollea, a scientific journal that publishes <b>papers</b> <b>on</b> systematic botany and phylotaxonomy, was named after de Candolle and his descendants in honor of their contribution {{to the field of}} botany. He was a mentor to the French-Mexican botanist Jean-Louis Berlandier.|$|E
5|$|His {{antiquarian}} studies led Planché to take {{an interest}} in heraldry. He had published several <b>papers</b> <b>on</b> heraldic topics in the Journal of the British Archaeological Association before publishing in 1852 The Pursuivant of Arms, or, Heraldry founded upon facts. As indicated by the subtitle, Planché was concerned with verifiable facts, as opposed to the unfounded theories perpetuated by many earlier heraldic writers. In the view of eminent herald Sir Anthony Wagner, Planché rewrote the early history of heraldry.|$|E
5|$|His {{research}} on plant evolution also progressed during this period; {{he worked on}} the genetics of forage grasses, looking at polyploidy and the evolution of the Poaceae and publishing numerous <b>papers</b> <b>on</b> the subject though the 1940s. He produced an artificial autotetraploid grass from the diploid species Ehrharta erecta through treatment with the chromosome doubling agent colchicine. He was able to establish the plant in the field, and after 39 years of field trials was able to show that the autopolyploid was not as successful as its diploid parent in an unchanging environment.|$|E

5|$|In 1888, after {{spending}} sixteen years cataloging Newton's papers, Cambridge University kept {{a small number}} and returned the rest to the Earl of Portsmouth. In 1936, a descendant offered the papers for sale at Sotheby's. The collection was broken up and sold {{for a total of}} about £9,000. John Maynard Keynes was one of about three dozen bidders who obtained part of the collection at auction. Keynes went on to reassemble an estimated half of Newton's collection of <b>papers</b> <b>on</b> alchemy before donating his collection to Cambridge University in 1946.|$|E
5|$|In 1942 Walter Simon {{introduced}} GR to English-speaking sinologists in {{a special}} pamphlet, The New Official Chinese Latin Script.

5|$|In 1964, {{archaeologist}} John Coles {{from the}} University of Cambridge began {{a research project}} {{that resulted in the}} publication of an important series of <b>papers</b> <b>on</b> many aspects of the Levels. A range of archaeological projects, such as the exploration of various trackways from the 3rd and 1st millennia BC and the establishment of their economic and geographic significance, was funded by various donors including English Heritage. Possibly the project's most significant excavation was of the Sweet Track in 1970, during which a Jadeite axe was discovered. Eight radiocarbon determinations of the date of the axe place it at around 3200 BC.|$|E
