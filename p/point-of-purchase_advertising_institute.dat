40|$|BACKGROUND—There is some {{evidence}} that tobacco companies marketing efforts undermine the effects of comprehensive tobacco control programmes.  OBJECTIVE—To determine whether <b>point-of-purchase</b> <b>advertising</b> and promotions are more pervasive in states where comprehensive tobacco control programmes are underway.  DESIGN—Cross sectional survey using 1996  data, with merged records of the existence of local tobacco advertising restrictions.  PARTICIPANTS AND SETTING— 581 tobacco retail stores located in close proximity to high schools in mainland USA.  MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES—Existence of gift-with-purchase, number of interior advertisements, and exterior store advertisements for Marlboro cigarettes.  RESULTS—After controlling for store type and existence of advertising restrictions, offer of a gift-with-purchase for Marlboro cigarettes was significantly more likely in states with comprehensive tobacco control programmes than those without programmes (odds ratio 2. 59,  95 % confidence interval 1. 57  to 4. 26). Although not significant, results show {{an increase in the number}} of interior and exterior store advertisements for stores located in states with a comprehensive tobacco control programme than those in other states.  CONCLUSION—Results suggest some point-of-purchase tobacco promotions and advertising are more pervasive in states with comprehensive tobacco control programmes. These efforts are likely to act against the objectives of programmes and need to be accounted for in programme evaluations.    Keywords: advertising; public policy; value added promotion...|$|R

40|$|This {{dissertation}} examines consumer behavior using hypothetical and non-hypothetical approaches. Across the study, {{emphasis is}} made on brand awareness and Willingness-to-Pay (WTP) measures of consumer preferences and {{the measurement of}} unobserved individual heterogeneity in the econometric analysis of consumer valuations. The methodologies used to elicit valuations and gather consumer preferences are hypothetical and non-hypothetical. The statistical tools used to analyze these data include econometric models for categorical and limited dependent variables, linear and non-linear random parameters models, and Latent Class Analysis (LCA). The first essay evaluates {{the effectiveness of a}} <b>point-of-purchase</b> <b>advertising</b> program conducted for two local horticultural brands. Results based on electronic surveys gathered before and after the program was launched suggest that the campaign size was not sufficient to significantly increase brand awareness and overall demand, yet it increased WTP by 5. 5 % for those consumers aware of one of the brands. A major factor found to influence preferences was purchase frequency, which suggests that other advertising methods aimed to increase buying frequency might affect demand more effectively. The second essay involved the econometric analysis of data collected using experimental auctions, which are often multidimensional. Panel data models commonly used consider bid-censoring and random effects that capture heterogeneity in the intercepts, but overlook heterogeneity in the coefficients. This essay compares different models, and provides evidence that a Random Parameters Tobit model extends the measurement of heterogeneity, accounts for bid-censoring, and provides the most efficient and consistent estimates. When the model is applied to data collected in a non-hypothetical Vickrey auction to elicit WTP for government (Food Safety Modernization Act, FSMA) and industry-issued (Global GAP) food safety standards in specialty melons, findings indicate that valuations are censored and heterogeneous. Finally, heterogeneity in valuations is assumed to occur discretely. Using a LCA approach, an examination was done to segment consumers based on their unobserved motivation to participate in experimental auctions. Moreover, Random Effects Tobit models are estimated to investigate differences in WTP among latent classes. The three latent classes found were characterized as: ?Fee-Chasers?, ?Certification Conscious?, and ?Taste Conscious?. Results reveal that the classes differed significantly in terms of their WTP estimates...|$|R
