The environment, called TANGO (Tag Added learNinG Objects) system, detects the objects around the learner using RFID (Radio Frequency Identification) tags, {{and provides the}} learner the right information for language learning.

5000|$|The initial {{implementation}} of DAS was on <b>PDAs</b> (<b>Personal</b> <b>digital</b> <b>assistant).</b> Recently {{with the release}} of Windows 8, Microsoft included the option of switching to a [...] "picture password". This is essentially an {{implementation of}} BDAS (as it requires the choice of a picture in the background) but is only limited to a three gesture sequence to set a password reducing the actual security that BDAS provides over conventional alphanumerical passwords.|$|R
50|$|Microsoft first {{presented}} the at Work concept at a release party on 9 June 1993. They described five classes of devices as being {{targets for the}} at Work system; fax machines, photocopiers, telephones, printers, and, oddly, hand-held <b>PDAs</b> (<b>personal</b> <b>digital</b> <b>assistants).</b> The idea of at Work was to design a standard set of communications protocols, status codes and commands to allow the devices to be remotely operated {{in the same fashion}} as network printers under PostScript.|$|R
50|$|Bluesnarfing is the {{unauthorized}} access {{of information from}} a wireless device through a Bluetooth connection, often between phones, desktops, laptops, and <b>PDAs</b> (<b>personal</b> <b>digital</b> <b>assistant).</b> This allows access to calendars, contact lists, emails and text messages, and on some phones, users can copy pictures and private videos. Both Bluesnarfing and Bluejacking exploit others' Bluetooth connections without their knowledge. While Bluejacking is essentially harmless as it only transmits data to the target device, Bluesnarfing is the theft of information from the target device.|$|R

40|$|It is very {{difficult}} for overseas students to learn Japanese polite expressions because the expressions change in complicated way according to the context, e. g. hyponymy, social distance, and the formality of conversation scenes. Moreover, the feeling of social distance in Japan often varies from that in a learner's country. This difference may result in misunderstanding for the overseas students. Therefore, it is very important for the learners to learn the social situation in Japan, and to use polite expressions properly accordingly. We have implemented a <b>PDA</b> (<b>Personal</b> <b>digital</b> <b>Assistant)</b> based languagelearning support system for Japanese polite expressions learning, which is called JAPELAS (Japanese polite expressions learning assisting system) ...|$|E
40|$|The UABMS (Universitat Autònoma de Barcelona Medical School) {{has set up}} a new project: {{to create}} a {{platform}} to help final-year students in clinical placements.

We consider the <b>PDA</b> (<b>Personal</b> <b>Digital</b> <b>Assistant)</b> to be a good solution; as it would enable easy access library to documentation, such as catalogues, data bases, digital journal, eBooks, etc in the field.

Therefore, we propose WinyDB, a relational query processing system on Windows-CE based <b>PDAs</b> (<b>Personal</b> <b>Digital</b> <b>Assistants)</b> for sensor networks. One of the main features of WinyDB is that multiple PDAs running WinyDB can answer queries collaboratively. This feature is useful in that it improves both the energy efficiency and the data quality.

After the laboratory class has finished, {{students are able to}} check their marks online through a web page. The students now regularly track their progress through the laboratory and can query potential recording errors as they arise. The system enhances the idea of continuous assessment, by giving up-to-date feedback to over 800 students who pass through the laboratory each week...|$|E
