5|$|Eriophorum angustifolium is a hardy, herbaceous, rhizomatous, {{perennial}} sedge, able {{to endure}} {{in a variety}} of environments in the temperate, subarctic and arctic regions of Earth. Unlike Gossypium, the genus from which cotton is derived, the bristles which grow on E.angustifolium are unsuited to textile manufacturing. Nevertheless, in Northern Europe, they were used as a substitute in the production of paper, <b>pillows,</b> candle-wicks, and wound-dressings. The indigenous peoples of North America use the plant in cooking and in the treatment of digestive problems. Following a vote in 2002, Plantlife International designated E.angustifolium the County Flower of Greater Manchester, as part of its British County Flowers campaign.|$|E
5000|$|An {{ordinary}} <b>Pillow</b> Pet is {{made with}} chenille fabric. Underneath it is a velcro strap. Given that it starts in <b>pillow</b> position, its strap fastens {{to the other side}} in order to transform it into a stuffed toy. If the strap is unfastened again, the <b>Pillow</b> Pet can again be used as a pillow.The original release of <b>Pillow</b> Pets included merely six varieties. Now, more than one hundred varieties of <b>Pillow</b> Pets have been sold by CJ Products.

5|$|Opening with a {{night time}} {{view of a}} high rise {{apartment}} block, the music video sees the group singing and dancing from the block's rooftop. A couple are shown arguing {{in one of the}} apartments while the group appear invisible beside them. The couple throw clothes and <b>pillows</b> at each other, among other things. Their aggressive behaviour is frozen each time while the group serenade them. The girlfriend later sits in a corner and cries before the video ends with frozen shots of the group in a now-empty apartment.|$|E
5|$|Pliny the Elder and {{his party}} saw flames coming from several parts of the crater. After staying overnight, the party was driven from the {{building}} by an accumulation of material, presumably tephra, which threatened to block all egress. They woke Pliny, who had been napping and emitting loud snoring. They elected {{to take to the}} fields with <b>pillows</b> tied to their heads to protect them from the raining debris. They approached the beach again but the wind prevented the ships from leaving. Pliny sat down on a sail that had been spread for him and could not rise even with assistance when his friends departed. Though Pliny the Elder died, his friends ultimately escaped by land.|$|E
5|$|The Little Ice Age {{may have}} reduced the {{population}} of the great auk by exposing more of their breeding islands to predation by polar bears, but massive exploitation by humans for their down drastically reduced the population. By the mid-sixteenth century, the nesting colonies along the European side of the Atlantic were nearly all eliminated by humans killing this bird for its down, which was used to make <b>pillows.</b> In 1553, the great auk received its first official protection, and in 1794 Great Britain banned the killing of this species for its feathers. In St. John's, those violating a 1775 law banning hunting the great auk for its feathers or eggs were publicly flogged, though hunting for use as fishing bait was still permitted. On the North American side, eider down initially was preferred, but once the eiders were nearly driven to extinction in the 1770s, down collectors switched to the great auk {{at the same time that}} hunting for food, fishing bait, and oil decreased.|$|E
50|$|The {{cheapest}} modern <b>pillow</b> is domed {{and made}} of polystyrene (styrofoam). It is often called a cookie <b>pillow,</b> because of its shape.

5|$|The {{video was}} quickly pulled after its release because it {{contained}} some technical errors. The clips {{of the people}} on Carey's television had their struggles captioned in dark text on a dark background, making it difficult to read. There were also continuity errors during the rainy balcony scene, as Carey's shirt would alternate between being soaking wet and dry. Consequently, a new music video was completed, which retained the clips of Carey's fans at the beginning but fixed the captions and replaced most of the interior shots of Carey with new footage. Carey, now in a new and more furnished apartment, does not go out into the rain but instead stays in her living room. She walks over to a large pair of windows aside a mural of large throw <b>pillows</b> and candles, singing and flailing her arms as she completes the song. As with the previous filming of the video, Carey's pain and sadness is resolved with a rainbow, shown {{at the end of the}} video.|$|E
5|$|Domestic geese {{are much}} larger than their wild {{counterparts}} and tend to have thick necks, an upright posture, and large bodies with broad rear ends. The greylag-derived birds are large and fleshy and used for meat, while the Chinese geese have smaller frames and are mainly used for egg production. The fine down of both is valued for use in <b>pillows</b> and padded garments. They forage on grass and weeds, supplementing this with small invertebrates, {{and one of the}} attractions of rearing geese is their ability to grow and thrive on a grass-based system. They are very gregarious and have good memories and can be allowed to roam widely in the knowledge that they will return home by dusk. The Chinese goose is more aggressive and noisy than other geese and {{can be used as a}} guard animal to warn of intruders. The flesh of meat geese is dark-coloured and high in protein, but they deposit fat subcutaneously, although this fat contains mostly monounsaturated fatty acids. The birds are killed either around 10 or about 24 weeks. Between these ages, problems with dressing the carcase occur because of the presence of developing pin feathers.|$|E
5|$|In {{order to}} compete with rival {{shipping}} company Cunard, the White Star Line offered their steerage passengers modest luxuries, {{in the hopes that}} emigrants would write to relatives back home and encourage them to travel on White Star Line ships. Third class passengers had their own dining facilities, with chairs instead of benches, and meals prepared by the third class kitchen staff. On other liners, the steerage passengers would have been expected to bring their own food. Rather than dormitory-style sleeping areas, third class passengers had their own cabins. The single men and women were separated, women in the stern in two to six berth cabins, men in the bow in up to ten berth cabins, often shared with strangers. Each stateroom was fitted with wood panelling and beds with mattresses, blankets, <b>pillows,</b> electric lights, heat and a washbasin with running water, except for the bow cabins which did not have a private washbasin. Two public bathtubs were also provided, one for the men, the other for women.|$|E

50|$|An early type of <b>pillow</b> {{can be seen}} in The Lace-Maker by Caspar Netscher. The <b>pillow</b> has {{a wooden}} frame, and is {{slightly}} sloping. The lace-maker rests it on her lap. The bolster or cylindrical <b>pillow</b> was much cheaper to make as it is just a fabric bag stuffed with straw. It was used in Bedfordshire lace. It needs a stand as it does not have a flat bottom. Usually the bolster had the pattern pinned round the cylinder, so by turning the <b>pillow,</b> the lace could be as long as was needed. However, Maltese lacemakers used the <b>pillow</b> the other way. They had a long thin <b>pillow,</b> which they rested against something. Then they worked the lace {{down the length of the}} <b>pillow.</b>|$|R
