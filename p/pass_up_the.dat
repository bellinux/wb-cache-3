5|$|Queen Mary 2 is a post-Panamax ship. As a result, Queen Mary 2 must {{circumnavigate}} South America {{to cross}} between the Atlantic and Pacific oceans. The {{decision not to}} constrain her size to transit the Panama Canal was taken as Queen Elizabeth 2 only transited once a year, during the world cruise. Cunard decided to <b>pass</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> convenience of the occasional passage in favour of a greater passenger capacity.|$|E
5|$|A {{collaboration}} between the Welland Rivers Trust, the Wild Trout Trust and the Environment Agency {{has resulted in the}} construction of a rock ramp, to allow migrating sea trout to <b>pass</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> river beyond the weir on the Maxey Cut, which was acting as a barrier. Some 300 tons of rock, with 50 tons of finer material forming a top layer, were used to create the ramp. The finer material ensures that water mainly flows over the ramp, rather than through it. The ramp also enables young eels or elvers to move up the river, and provides habitat for stone loach and bullheads.|$|E
5|$|The end {{came first}} for Virginia. Because the {{blockade}} was unbroken, Norfolk was of little strategic {{use to the}} Confederacy, and preliminary plans were laid to move the ship up the James River to the vicinity of Richmond. Before adequate preparations could be made, the Confederate Army under Major General Benjamin Huger abandoned the city on May 9, without consulting anyone from the Navy. Virginias draft was too great to permit her to <b>pass</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> river, which had a depth of only , and then only under favorable circumstances. She was trapped and could only be captured or sunk by the Union Navy. Rather than allow either, Tatnall decided to destroy his own ship. He had her towed down to Craney Island in Portsmouth, where the gang were taken ashore, {{and then she was}} set afire. She burned {{through the rest of the}} day and most of the following night; shortly before dawn, the flames reached her magazine, and she blew up.|$|E

On that occasion he climbed from the <b>pass</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> Klein Matterhorn (3,883 m), while in 1792 he spent three days making observations on the same pass without descending to Zermatt and then visited the Theodulhorn (3,472 m).|$|E
25|$|Manchester Ship Canal at Latchford, Stockton Heath and Lower Walton in Warrington, {{and also}} {{slightly}} further west at Moore. Near {{the eastern end}} of the canal in Salford, the Barton Road Swing Bridge is adjacent to the Barton Swing Aqueduct - a 234-foot, 800-ton trough holding some 800 tons of water (retained by gates at either end) swings so that it is at right angles to the Bridgewater Canal to allow ships to <b>pass</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> Ship Canal.|$|E
25|$|Infection occurs {{by eating}} food or drink {{contaminated}} with Ascaris eggs from feces. The eggs hatch in the intestines, burrow through the gut wall, and {{migrate to the}} lungs via the blood. There they break into the alveoli and <b>pass</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> trachea, where they are coughed up and swallowed. The larvae then pass through the stomach {{for a second time}} into the intestine, where they become adult worms. It is a type of soil-transmitted helminthiasis and {{part of a group of}} diseases called helminthiases.|$|E

25|$|According to the {{historian}} Sima Qian, Yu {{did not want}} his son to become king and intended to give the throne to Gao Yao, his Minister of Justice, but when Gao died Yu designated as his heir Yi (also known as Boyi), his former companion for thirteen years fighting the flood and his current Minister of Animal Husbandry. But due to Yu's great influence, all {{the leaders of the}} Xia states came to admire Qi instead of Yi, so Yi {{had no choice but to}} <b>pass</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> throne to Qi at the end of three years of mourning for Yu.|$|E
25|$|The {{original}} {{bridge was}} owned by the Teignmouth and Shaldon Bridge Company and opened on 8 June 1827. It had 34 wooden arches and was 1,671 feet long, which made it the longest wooden bridge in England when built. It had abutment walls of a considerable length at either end, and a swing bridge at the Teignmouth end to allow sailing ships to <b>pass</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> estuary. It cost around £19,000 to build, but the overall expenditure was about £26,000 due to {{the costs of the}} necessary Act of Parliament and the purchase of the old ferry-rights. Toll houses were built {{at each end of the}} bridge, and the one on the Teignmouth side survives.|$|E
25|$|In September 1847, Manuel de la Peña y Peña {{replaced}} Santa Anna as President of Mexico, and Pena and his Moderado allies {{showed a}} willingness to negotiate based on the terms Polk had relayed to Trist. In November 1847, Trist received Polk's order to return to Washington. After a period of indecision, and {{with the backing of}} Scott and the Mexican government (which was aware of Trist's recall), Trist decided to enter into negotiations with the Mexican government. As Polk had made no plans to send an envoy to replace him, Trist thought that he could not <b>pass</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> opportunity to end the war on favorable terms. Though Polk was outraged by Trist's decision, he decided to allow Trist some time to negotiate a treaty.|$|E

500|$|In The Bling Ring (2013), Watson {{stars as}} Nicki. The film {{is based on}} the real-life Bling Ring robberies, with Watson playing a fictionalised version of Alexis Neiers, a {{television}} personality who was one of seven teenagers involved in the robberies. While the film mostly received mixed reviews, critics gave almost unanimous praise for Watson's portrayal. Watson also had a supporting role in the apocalyptic comedy This Is the End (2013), in which she, Seth Rogen, James Franco and many others played [...] "exaggerated versions of themselves" [...] and Watson memorably dropped the [...] "f-bomb". She said she could not <b>pass</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> opportunity to make her first comedy and [...] "work with some of the best comedians ... in the world right now".|$|E
500|$|In June 1993, {{partly in}} {{response}} to pressure from the United States, the Security Council passed Resolution 836 which authorized NATO forces to provide close air support for UNPROFOR forces upon request. The procedure to request air support was quite difficult, as it involved the [...] "dual key" [...] of both UN and NATO approval. UN approval required contact with the United Nations headquarters in New York City, making effective coordination nearly impossible given the difference in time zones. The UN approval process was later somewhat streamlined when UN Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali delegated the authority to authorize air strikes to his special representative in Bosnia, Yasushi Akashi. [...] Even after this simplification, however, [...] "dual key" [...] remained a problem as all requests first had to be processed through the UN Air Operations Center in Kiseljak then <b>pass</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> entire [...] UNPROFOR chain of command to Akashi. After Akashi approved the request, {{he would make a}} request to NATO commanders who then had to pass orders back down their chain of command and coordinate with forces on the ground.|$|E
500|$|In the {{following}} years, Timberlake went partially idle {{in the music}} industry. His being [...] "burnt out" [...] partly caused him to try acting in films. In October 2003, he hosted and was the guest musician on the late-night variety show Saturday Night Live, where he showcased his acting potentials. He also paired with American actor Jimmy Fallon on The Barry Gibb Talk Show. After the show, Timberlake was reportedly [...] "inundated" [...] with acting offers, which he readily accepted partly because he needed inspiration {{and did not want}} to <b>pass</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> opportunities. Before returning to music, Timberlake shot four films; including Edison Force (2005) and Alpha Dog (2006). Timberlake opted not to pursue the reunion with *NSYNC, which he considered after Justified. According to him, he was concerned with how they would reinvent their music. In late 2004, Timberlake then contacted record producers Rich Harrison and Rodney Jerkins, who had produced songs for *NSYNC. Both producers were [...] "impressed" [...] by the live band-driven late-night shows Timberlake had participated in and wanted to incorporate this in his music.|$|E

500|$|After not {{receiving}} serious interest from any NHL teams, Brashear opted {{to return to}} the LNAH and signed with Sorel-Tracy GCI. He noted that his decision was based on his desire to continue playing hockey, his love for playing in the province of Quebec and a chance to reunite with some former teammates. He was later traded during the season to Rivière-du-Loup 3L to add talent and toughness to the team. Rivière-du-Loup considered the acquisition of Brashear a [...] "coup," [...] noting that they could not <b>pass</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> chance to add him to the team. Late in the season, Brashear was given a suspension following his actions in a brawl against Trois-Rivières. During the melee, Brashear [...] "attacked" [...] goaltender Julien Ellis after he slashed one of Brashear's teammates who was engaged in a different fight. Brashear hit Ellis with several gloved punches before one of Ellis' teammates attempted to restrain Brashear. Brashear fought with the intervening player and after falling to the ice, Brashear continued to punch the [...] "defenceless" [...] player. He went back after the goaltender before a linesman tackled him. The suspension was originally set at eight games, but after the League met with Brashear and Rivière-du-Loup's general manager, it was reduced to five games.|$|E
500|$|... "The Master Plan" [...] {{marked the}} first {{appearance}} of Adam Scott, who also appeared in the subsequent season finale [...] "Freddy Spaghetti" [...] and became a regular cast member during the third season. Scott left the Starz comedy Party Down to join the Parks and Recreation cast, a decision he made {{in part because it}} was unclear whether Starz would renew the series: [...] "It was a matter of me asking Starz {{if it was going to}} continue, and them saying they weren't ready to make that decision. I couldn't <b>pass</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> opportunity on Parks and Rec for a show that could possibly not exist anymore." [...] Schur said when the Ben Wyatt character was written, Scott was envisioned as the [...] "dream scenario" [...] for casting. Schur described Scott as [...] "brilliant and funny" [...] and praised his comedic range: [...] "There just aren't that many people with a comedic range that spans Step Brothers to Party Down.". Several commentators said Ben Wyatt closely resembles the character Scott played on Party Down, Henry Pollard. While Ben was a politician who found great success at a young age then suffered a downfall, Henry was an actor who became a caterer after his acting career declined. Scott, however, said he feels they are [...] "vastly different characters and circumstances". The idea of a character trying to rebuild a government career following a humiliating public failure was one of the original ideas for the series of Parks and Recreation in general, but one that was ultimately not used until the Ben Wyatt character was introduced. During the scene when Ben explains his failed mayoral tenure, shots of a newspaper clip with images of the character's prom pictures are shown. Those pictures are the actual high school prom photos of actor Adam Scott.|$|E

2500|$|In 1954, Laredo faced {{a devastating}} Rio Grande flood, {{when the water}} reached , more than [...] {{higher than in the}} {{previous}} 1932 flood, which had also caused great damage. According to Laredo historian Jerry D. Thompson of Texas A International University, the 1954 flood was [...] "the largest in ninety-one years and the second largest according to archeological records in the last three hundred years." [...] Many were left homeless for a time because of the calamity. Former Webb County administrative Judge Mercurio Martinez, Jr., recalls that his father surveyed the depth of the water and advised residents to evacuate. Several downtown businesses had to remove their merchandise inventory or risk losing it to the rising waters. The flood caused the relocation of the Holding Institute. The international bridge was destroyed when it was struck by the floating railroad bridge, which had been hit by the debris of another bridge in Eagle <b>Pass</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> river.
