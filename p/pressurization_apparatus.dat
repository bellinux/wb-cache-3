40|$|The {{posterior}} sclera likely {{plays an}} important role in the development of glaucoma, and accurate characterization of its mechanical properties is needed to understand its impact on the more delicate optic nerve headâ€”the primary site of damage in the disease. The posterior scleral shells from both eyes of one rhesus monkey were individually mounted on a custom-built <b>pressurization</b> <b>apparatus.</b> Intraocular pressure was incrementally in-creased from 5 mm Hg to 45 mm Hg, and the 3 D displacements were measured using electronic speckle pattern interferometry. Finite element meshes of each posterior scleral shell were reconstructed from data generated by a 3 D digitizer arm (shape) and a 20 MHz ultrasound transducer (thickness). An anisotropic hyperelastic constitutive mode...|$|E
