5|$|The mantapa is {{the hall}} where {{groups of people}} gather during prayers. The {{entrance}} to the mantapa normally has a highly ornate overhead lintel called a makaratorana (makara is an imaginary beast and torana is an overhead decoration). The open mantapa which serves the purpose of an outer hall (outer mantapa) is a regular feature in larger Hoysala temples leading to an inner small closed mantapa and the shrine(s). The open mantapas which are often spacious have seating areas (asana) made of stone with the mantapa's <b>parapet</b> <b>wall</b> acting as a back rest. The seats may follow the same staggered square shape of the <b>parapet</b> <b>wall.</b> The ceiling here is supported by numerous pillars that create many bays. The shape of the open mantapa is best described as staggered-square and is the style used in most Hoysala temples. Even the smallest open mantapa has 13 bays. The walls have parapets that have half pillars supporting the outer ends of the roof which allow plenty of light making all the sculptural details visible. The mantapa ceiling is generally ornate with sculptures, both mythological and floral. The ceiling consists of deep and domical surfaces and contains sculptural depictions of banana bud motifs and other such decorations.|$|E
5|$|The Archaeological Survey of India (ASI), Aurangabad Circle {{maintains}} {{and manages}} the Elephanta Caves. It {{is responsible for}} monitoring and stabilisation of the rock face, construction of supports to the cave structures where pillars have collapsed, and consolidation of cave floors and construction of a <b>parapet</b> <b>wall</b> surrounding the site. In addition, it maintains the visitor facilities and an on-site museum. The site receives approximately 1,000 visitors a day, more on Shiva ratri, dance festivals, the World Heritage Day (18 April) and World Heritage Week between 19 and 25 November for special events.|$|E
5|$|The prison's {{workshops}} provided {{activities and}} training for the prisoners. They also reduced the cost of maintenance, repairs, and construction by providing an in-house service. The original workshop was a blacksmith's shop, {{one of the first}} buildings to be constructed on the prison site. Later known as the East Workshops, other workshops included carpenter's, plumber's and painter's, a printing office, and from the 1850s, a metal shop. The West Workshops were built {{at the start of the}} twentieth century, providing more work for prisoners through a paint shop, mat maker, shoe maker, book binder and tailor shop. The five western workshops are a single storey squared limestone rubble building with openings dressed in brick, with an open saw-tooth roof with southern skylights, concealed behind a <b>parapet</b> <b>wall.</b> In 1993 the western workshops were adapted for use as TAFE art workshops.|$|E
50|$|Low-pitched {{corrugated}} iron roofs are {{hidden from view}} behind brick <b>parapet</b> <b>walls.</b> Rainwater, collected in concealed box gutters, is discharged through the <b>parapet</b> <b>walls</b> into painted metal rainwater heads and downpipes. Metal ladders bolted to external walls provide access to the roofs.|$|R
25|$|The road is paved and <b>parapet</b> <b>walls</b> protectively confine {{traffic to}} the bridge.|$|R

25|$|The {{third stage}} {{comprises}} the porch, including the west gable <b>parapet</b> <b>wall</b> surmounted by a Latin cross at its apex, the gable <b>parapet</b> <b>wall</b> to the nave {{also with a}} Latin cross, and the tiled roofs of the nave, apse and porch. The porch is {{to the west of}} the nave, its walls also constructed of random rubble with uncoloured concrete block quoins. The western porch facade has a rectangular window with three lights, the outer casements of which open outwards while the central light is fixed. There is a narrow, upright slit in the stone wall above the window. The western facade of the nave has a circular window in-filled with fixed louvers and topped by a stone drip moulding. Both gable parapets have moulded block-work coping. The northern elevation of the porch features a doorway now accessed by a ramp with a bell mounted to the right-hand side of the doorway that is framed in bevelled concrete.|$|E
25|$|The tracks from Glasgow {{enter at}} {{the east end of}} the wide {{concourse}} which is flanked to the north and south by high stone walls, each capped {{at the east}} end by a castellated turret. A glazed roof between these walls sheltered the concourse until recently, but it has been removed and small shelters introduced. The northernmost line stops as a bay platform and is not in use, and platform 1 serving eastbound trains opens directly to the top of Station Avenue which slopes down to Cathcart Street through stone archways marking the station entrance. The two tracks in use continue westwards through a tunnel which is capped by the <b>parapet</b> <b>wall</b> to Terrace Road, which leaves Cathcart Street further to the west and rises steeply towards the station before turning south over the tunnel entrance and continuing to {{rise to the level of}} the Well Park. Doorways in the <b>parapet</b> <b>wall</b> lead to staircases down to each platform, and to a steel ramp down to Platform 2 serving westbound trains. Originally, there was only one doorway, which led to a sloping passageway which in turn connected with the (now removed) station's internal steel lattice footbridge.|$|E
25|$|In 2004 {{the city}} of Rockford {{purchased}} two-thirds of the Chick House {{with the intention of}} redeveloping the historic property. In October the city shut off gas and water, in part because of an old boiler which would not survive another winter; the electricity remained on during this time. The city set about to make immediate repairs to prevent the building from deteriorating structurally. The work included the installation of Plexiglas windows to keep further moisture out, the installation of a green awning on the east facade which wraps around to the south slightly, and repairs to the <b>parapet</b> <b>wall.</b>|$|E
50|$|The {{southern}} elevation {{has similar}} details {{to the front}} including concrete-formed <b>parapet</b> <b>walls,</b> arched steel-framed windows, decorative brackets and the Maltese cross detail.|$|R
50|$|The {{external}} {{walls of the}} temple are 39 ft in height. They are adorned with fortified <b>parapet</b> <b>walls.</b> Each corner has a ringed pagoda.|$|R
50|$|The western {{elevation}} {{has similar}} details with concrete <b>parapet</b> <b>walls</b> arched openings with diamond-shaped infills to the verandah. Metal window awnings {{have been added}} above the window openings.|$|R
25|$|The {{main house}} has a balloon-frame {{structure}} on a concrete foundation. The roof is flat with a <b>parapet</b> <b>wall</b> running along the roof edge to conceal the asphalt roof. There is a large overhanging eave on the northeast front and north sides of the building. The exterior is covered with spatter-dashed stucco. The living room picture windows are casement style, set at a 110 degree angle. The remaining windows are a two-over-two double-hung type with horizontal muntins. The original doors were replaced in the 1970s. Unfortunately, there are no photographs of the originals doors so an appropriate Streamline Moderne style door with a round port window was installed during the 1996 renovation. The street front façade has three wide horizontal bands set out from the main wall surface that emphasize the design’s horizontal orientation.|$|E
25|$|The rows of shining lathe turned pillars {{that support}} {{the ceiling of the}} mantapa is a Hoysala-Chalukya {{decorative}} idiom. The mantapa has many deeply domed inner ceiling structures adorned with floral designs. The outer <b>parapet</b> <b>wall</b> of the open mantapa has a total of hundred and forty panel sculptures with depictions from the Hindu epics. Unlike many Hoysala temples where the panels are small and carvings in miniature, these panels are comparatively larger. The Ramayana is sculpted on the south side wall on seventy panels, with the story proceeding quite unusually, in anti-clockwise direction. On the north side wall, all depictions are clockwise, a norm in Hoysala architectural articulation. Twenty five panels depict the life of the Hindu god Krishna and the remaining forty five panels depict scenes from the epic Mahabharata.|$|E
25|$|The battery was {{initially}} armed with {{four or five}} heavy rifled muzzle loaders for use against large warships. These were replaced in 1895 by more powerful 6-inch rifled breech loaders. In 1905 it was renamed from Grain Battery to Dummy Battery and underwent substantial alterations to its fabric to accommodate {{a new set of}} guns. Two 4.7-inch quick-firing guns were installed {{on the roof of the}} fort to counter smaller and faster adversaries such as torpedo boats and destroyers. They were mounted in a pair of concrete emplacements of a typical low-profile design, with ready-use ammunition recesses adjacent to each gun. The emplacements were linked by a covered way protected by a high <b>parapet</b> <b>wall.</b> A new magazine was also built within the battery's core, with separate storage rooms for shells and cartridges, and a fire control position was added. These alterations resulted in major changes to the form of the terreplein which obliterated many of its original features. A troop shelter also existed behind the main trace of the earthworks.|$|E
50|$|The {{northern}} elevation {{has similar}} details {{to the front}} elevation including concrete-formed <b>parapet</b> <b>walls,</b> arched verandah openings, timber slat balustrades and decorative brackets. A recent timber deck joins the Maternity Wing in this area to the 1991 extension.|$|R
5000|$|It is {{a two-part}} three-story {{fireproof}} brick Western Commercial 90x130 ft building with [...] "colorful detailed terra cotta tile work, raised brick arches, and coped, shaped <b>parapet</b> <b>walls</b> reminiscent of Spanish Mission Revival architecture." [...] It originally had a billiards {{room and a}} bowling alley.|$|R
5000|$|The Temple is a two-hall structure, with {{an unusual}} jagged roof, {{elaborate}} [...] "fire" [...] type <b>parapet</b> <b>walls,</b> clay sculptural figures, relieves and paintings {{inside and outside the}} Temple.

500|$|The {{building}} is constructed in a rectangular shape, symmetrical on the exterior, and measures [...] by [...] The approximate height measurements are not {{provided by the}} Register. Large, six over six paned windows {{are located in the}} front and the back of the building on both floors. Similar windows are also located {{on the south side of}} the building, but only on the top floor. There are no windows located on the north side. The entire exterior of the {{building is}} constructed from brick. The roof is flat and constructed of roofing cement, with a parapet located around it, with a section of a chimney that sticks out of the south end of the roof. The most prominent feature of the exterior of the building is the large, central pavilion, with a stepped gable <b>parapet</b> <b>wall.</b>|$|E
500|$|The {{source is}} disputed, {{tradition}} holds that it rises at an artesian well, the Fuente de Cella, {{at the base}} of the Sierra Albarracín in Teruel province. [...] The well is surrounded by an elliptical <b>parapet</b> <b>wall</b> built by the Italian engineer Domingo Ferrari. It is now thought that the stretch of river between Cella and Monreal del Campo is the remains of an 18th-century canal which was cut to drain the Laguna Cañizar at Villarquemado. It is currently accepted that the Jiloca raises at the Ojos (Eyes) of Monreal, [...] from the town. [...] These are a series of ponds linked by channels. From Monreal the river flows northwards and near Luco de Jiloca (Calamocha), the Jiloca is joined by its only tributary, the Pancrudo, which rises [...] away in the Sierra de la Costera. [...] From this point there is an irrigation channel which waters a small valley near Daroca.|$|E
5000|$|Roofing felts {{are usually}} a 'paper' or fiber {{material}} impregnated in bitumen. As gravel cannot protect tarpaper surfaces where they rise vertically {{from the roof}} such as on <b>parapet</b> <b>walls</b> or upstands, the felts are usually coated with bitumen and protected by sheet metal flashings.|$|R
50|$|Apart {{from the}} Kasturi Rangappa Nayaka Fort, the Juma Masjid {{close to the}} tomb was built in 1696. The masjid is {{decorated}} with five arches in the facade. Ornamented <b>parapet</b> <b>walls</b> are built above the arches. The roof of the masjid {{is made up of}} three domes.|$|R
25|$|Constructed in 1913 of {{concrete}} block and steel, the Assembly Hall is wrapped by an arcaded verandah which helps {{to keep the}} interior cool. Its hipped roof of cedar shingles is partially concealed by <b>parapet</b> <b>walls.</b> It was originally used as an assembly hall, and it now houses classrooms.|$|R
2500|$|The Ziegler Building (9 Market Square) is {{a three-story}} Neoclassical {{building}} constructed around 1880. [...] The building has a pressed metal cornice, decorative pilasters, and a raised <b>parapet</b> <b>wall.</b> [...] Sausage-maker Adolph Ziegler and his associates, Ignaz Fanz and Anton Metler, sold sausage and pork {{out of the}} building in the 1880s and 1890s.|$|E
2500|$|About [...] east-northeast of the sanctuary, {{there was}} a series of massive cisterns, reached by a rock-cut {{stairway}} extending about [...] down into the bedrock. The opening of the stairway is [...] northwest of the openings of the cisterns. The descent is steep and the steps are not all well-preserved. There are cuttings for a <b>parapet</b> <b>wall</b> around the vertiginous upper openings of the cisterns to prevent falls. It has been proposed that the water was raised from the cisterns to the water channel by the use of large human-powered waterwheels.|$|E
2500|$|Upon completion, the Penobscot Building was the eighth-tallest {{building}} in the world, the fourth-tallest in America and the tallest outside of New York and Chicago. Rising , the 47-story Penobscot was the tallest {{building in}} Michigan from its completion in 1928 until construction of the Renaissance Center hotel tower in 1977. One Detroit Center surpassed the Penobscot as the tallest office building in Detroit upon its completion in 1993. The framing elevation drawing of this building shows a height of [...] to the highest roof, approximately [...] to the <b>parapet</b> <b>wall</b> around the roof, and [...] {{to the top of}} the warning beacon atop the antenna.|$|E
50|$|The brick north {{elevation}} contains {{what appear}} to be historic, one-over-one wood sash with historic steel shutters. The west elevation consists of a plain brick wall. The roof contains brick <b>parapet</b> <b>walls,</b> bulkheads, and chimney, non-historic wood and metal fences, and a wood water tank on a steel-framed base.|$|R
50|$|Middletown Bridge, {{also known}} as Shelby County Bridge #149, is a {{historic}} stone arch bridge located in Liberty Township, Shelby County, Indiana. It was built in 1903, and is a four-arch bridge constructed of Indiana limestone. It measures 140.8 feet long and 20 feet wide, including the <b>parapet</b> <b>walls.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Occupying a {{position}} symmetrical {{to that of}} Joel, at the meeting point of the <b>parapet</b> <b>walls</b> that form the ingress {{to the left side}} of the forecourt, is the statue of Jonah. For this best-known of the minor prophets, Aleijadinho reserved pride of place, positioning it next to Daniel.|$|R
2500|$|... "Tribute", [...] "memorial", or [...] "commemorative" [...] hacks {{note the}} arrival, passing, or anniversary of some {{noteworthy}} person, tradition, institution, or idea (e.g. the 10th anniversary of Wikipedia). [...] Another broad category of hacks contains strong elements of social commentary or street protest (e.g. [...] "Nth Annual Spontaneous Tuition Riot") about events on campus {{or in the}} world at large. [...] But the strongest element of many hacks is the sheer joy of conceptualizing something new, and then reifying it with effective engineering, both technical and social (e.g. installing a full-sized mockup solar-powered subway car on the <b>parapet</b> <b>wall</b> {{around the base of the}} Great Dome, and then driving it back and forth under remote wireless control from Killian Court, some five stories below, after sundown).|$|E
2500|$|The Portuguese fort of Santa Cruz de Gale was {{situated}} on a promontory {{at the western}} edge of the Bay of Galle. Although considerably elevated at its southern tip, it gradually sloped down towards the isthmus where it connected with the mainland. At this isthmus, a wall extended from sea side to the bay side enclosing Galle city. There were three bastions defending the wall from sea to bay called [...] "Santo António", [...] "Conception" [...] and [...] "Santiago". Santiago was small and had a low open terrace making it vulnerable to grenade attacks. From the Santiago, a <b>parapet</b> <b>wall</b> ran along the bay up to the Retreat, a fortification that contained the captain’s keep and an esplanade, which had space to mount 20 guns.|$|E
2500|$|One {{eastbound}} lane {{was closed}} near Cherry Street due to deterioration. The concrete <b>parapet</b> <b>wall</b> {{could no longer}} support the light standard in that location. The light standard was instead relocated into the rightmost lane, and the lane was closed. Two locations, at Fort York Boulevard and near Cherry Street were reinforced to prevent [...] "punch-throughs" [...] (holes) from happening on the road surface, potentially knocking {{a large piece of}} concrete to the ground below and causing a dangerous incident for the vehicles above. It was estimated in December 2012 by the City of Toronto Infrastructure Department that the Expressway has a backlog of $626 million in repairs. Starting in 2013, the City intends to carry out $505 million worth of repairs over nine years. Temporary wood bracing and decking are being added to the underside of the road deck to prevent punch-throughs, but only provide a short term fix and will require a long term solution to prevent future deck collapse.|$|E
50|$|The court, {{built in}} 1926, {{consists}} of eight Spanish Colonial Revival style bungalows arranged around a central courtyard. While the houses have similar styles and floor plans, they also all have key differences, {{such as the}} shape of their <b>parapet</b> <b>walls</b> and the color and style of their stucco exteriors.|$|R
