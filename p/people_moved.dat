5|$|During World War II, {{the defense}} buildup in Mobile shipyards {{resulted}} in a considerable increase in the city's white middle-class and working-class population, {{largely due to the}} massive influx of workers coming to work in the shipyards and at the Brookley Army Air Field. Between 1940 and 1943, more than 89,000 <b>people</b> <b>moved</b> into Mobile to work for war effort industries.|$|E
5|$|In August 2012, the Scottish {{population}} {{reached an}} all-time high of 5.25 million people. The reasons given were that, in Scotland, births were outnumbering the number of deaths, and immigrants were moving to Scotland from overseas. In 2011, 43,700 <b>people</b> <b>moved</b> from Wales, Northern Ireland or England to live in Scotland.|$|E
40|$|One of the {{recurring}} {{themes in the}} discussion of globalisation is mobility. Money <b>moves,</b> products <b>move,</b> <b>people</b> <b>move.</b> Signs, symbols and representations also move. With new communications technologies, images can be flashed around the globe instantaneously, but with diverse forms of local reception. It could be argued that practices <b>move,</b> too. As <b>people</b> <b>move,</b> they take with them their learned ways of doing things: their work habits, their manners, their deportment, their gestures. In new places, they also learn new ways of doing things. When <b>people</b> <b>move,</b> bodies move. Mobility is an embodied experience...|$|R

5|$|The Hittite {{archives}} of circa 1400 BCE, {{during the reign}} of Arnuwanda I, describe the military campaign of Attarsiya in southwest Anatolia, probably in the region of Lycia. The Achaean expedition in Anatolia is associated with increased Mycenaean findings in Milet during this period (early 14th century BCE), indicating that a number of Greek <b>people</b> <b>moved</b> from mainland Greece to this region.|$|E

5|$|According to Maple's account, in {{the last}} few weeks of Pickingill's life, when he had become very ill, the local <b>people</b> <b>moved</b> him to the {{infirmary}} against his will, where he declared that at his funeral there would be one more demonstration of his magical powers. Many locals interpreted this as coming true when as the hearse carrying his coffin drew up to the churchyard, the horses stepped out of their harness shafts. His body was subsequently buried in the church's graveyard, whilst his abandoned house gradually became dilapidated before falling down.|$|E
5|$|Between 1994 and 2009, {{the city}} had a declining and aging {{population}} compared to Tel Aviv and Jerusalem, as young <b>people</b> <b>moved</b> {{to the center of}} the country for education and jobs, while young families migrated to bedroom communities in the suburbs. However, as a result of new projects and improving infrastructure, the city managed to reverse its population decline, reducing emigration while attracting more internal migration into the city. In 2009, positive net immigration into the city was shown for the first time in 15 years.|$|E
5|$|During the 1950s and 1960s the South Florida {{metropolitan}} area grew {{four times as}} fast {{as the rest of the}} nation. Between 1940 and 1965, 6million <b>people</b> <b>moved</b> to south Florida: 1,000people moved to Miami every week. Urban development between the mid-1950s and the late 1960s quadrupled. Much of the water reclaimed from the Everglades was sent to newly developed areas. With metropolitan growth came urban problems associated with rapid expansion: traffic jams; school overcrowding; crime; overloaded sewage treatment plants; and, for the first time in south Florida's urban history, water shortages in times of drought.|$|E

5|$|During the 1950s and 1960s, a {{time when}} federal aid for urban renewal was plentiful, Albany did not have growth in its economy or infrastructure.

While cities across the country grappled with similar issues, the problems were magnified in Albany: interference from the Democratic political machine hindered progress considerably.|$|E

A reconnaissance task force was sent out from Belize City the day after Carmen made landfall to assist any residents stranded by the storm. One person was killed {{off the coast of}} Belize after being washed off his boat by large swells produced by Carmen. Three other fishermen were listed as missing following similar incidents. Thousands of <b>people</b> <b>moved</b> from coastal areas inland to escape the storm. Crop damage in the country was reportedly severe.|$|E
5|$|Like most of South Korea's smaller cities, Gyeongju {{has seen}} a steady drop in {{population}} in recent years. From 2002 to 2008, the city lost 16,557 people. This is primarily due to the migration of workers seeking employment in the major South Korean cities. In 2007, about 1,975 more <b>people</b> <b>moved</b> {{away from the city}} each year than moved in. During the same period, births exceeded deaths by roughly 450 per year, a significant number but not enough to offset the losses due to migration.|$|E

5|$|Race {{relations}} were tense during the Reconstruction era, as whites resisted freedmen {{being allowed to}} choose their labor, vote, and have freedom of movement. Following a fire that damaged many businesses, the riot of 1871 erupted, with whites attacking blacks in the community.

5|$|The {{precursor}} disturbance brought {{light to}} moderate rainfall to El Salvador. Many homes were damaged, roads were flooded, and several trees were downed. A 44-year-old woman died when a tree fell on her. Strong winds and high waves damaged four homes in Barrio Playa, in the municipality of Acajutla. As a result, shelters were opened, though only seven people sought refuge in them. This same disturbance brought landslides to Guatemala; consequently, 30 <b>people</b> <b>moved</b> to shelters.|$|E
5|$|Despite the {{discontinuation}} of ferry {{service to}} New Jersey, <b>people</b> <b>moved</b> to locations along the Hudson River waterfront there. In 1986, waterfront settlements like Bayonne, Highlands, Keyport, Port Liberte, and Weehawken saw a reinstatement of their ferry service to Manhattan, under {{the operation of}} NY Waterway. By 1989, around 3,000 of the settlements' combined 10,500 residents paid a $5.00 fare in each direction to board the NY Waterway ferries, despite competition from cheaper alternatives like the PATH train system. Around this time, there were plans to create ferry routes between Inwood and Atlantic City; South Amboy and Wall Street; and from the city proper to New Jersey, Connecticut, and Westchester.|$|E

5|$|During the 1950s and 1960s, <b>people</b> <b>moved</b> {{out of the}} {{surrounding}} Manhattan Valley neighborhood. Consequently, the Master Apartments' museum and cultural center closed by 1971, their holdings dispersed elsewhere, although the building's auditorium was still used for cultural events. After Louis's death in 1979, the building was bought by real estate investor Sol Goldman, who converted it to a housing co-operative over the next decade. Further renovations, which were completed in 2005, resulted {{in many of the}} one-bedroom studios being combined into two- and three-bedroom units. These renovations attracted more families and made the building more luxurious by both quality-of-life and purchase-price measures. The Master Apartments was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2016.|$|E
5|$|East Germany's {{communities}} had a {{much harder}} time, because the country was poorer and their government imposed severe restrictions on them. The border region was progressively depopulated through the clearance of numerous villages and the forced relocation of their inhabitants. Border towns suffered draconian building restrictions: inhabitants were forbidden from building new houses and even repairing existing buildings, causing infrastructure to fall into severe decay. The state did little but to provide a 15% income supplement to those living in the Sperrzone and Schutzstreifen; but this did not halt the shrinkage of the border population, as younger <b>people</b> <b>moved</b> elsewhere to find employment and better living conditions.|$|E
5|$|Four Native American {{cultures}} {{are known to}} have lived in the area during the last 10,000years. The first known group, the Nevares Spring People, were hunters and gatherers who arrived in the area perhaps 9,000years ago (7000BC) when there were still small lakes in Death Valley and neighboring Panamint Valley. A much milder climate persisted at that time, and large game animals were still plentiful. By 5,000years ago (3000BC) the Mesquite Flat People displaced the Nevares Spring People. Around 2,000years ago the Saratoga Spring <b>People</b> <b>moved</b> into the area, which by then was probably already a hot, dry desert. This culture was more advanced at hunting and gathering and was skillful at handcrafts. They also left mysterious stone patterns in the valley.|$|E
