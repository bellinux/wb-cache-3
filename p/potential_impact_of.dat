5|$|Nothing {{is known}} of the {{conditions}} that affect its distribution, as its biogeography is as yet unstudied.

5|$|Fermi {{was among}} the first to warn {{military}} leaders about the <b>potential</b> <b>impact</b> <b>of</b> nuclear energy, giving a lecture on the subject at the Navy Department on 18March 1939. The response fell short of what he had hoped for, although the Navy agreed to provide $1,500 towards further research at Columbia. Later that year, Szilárd, Eugene Wigner, and Edward Teller sent the famous letter signed by Einstein to U.S. President Roosevelt, warning that Nazi Germany was likely to build an atomic bomb. In response, Roosevelt formed the Advisory Committee on Uranium to investigate the matter.|$|E

5|$|Banksia prionotes is {{susceptible}} {{to a number of}} threatening processes. It is highly {{susceptible to}} Phytophthora cinnamomi dieback; wild populations are harvested commercially by the cut flower industry; and some of its range is subject to land clearing for urban or agricultural purposes. An assessment of the <b>potential</b> <b>impact</b> <b>of</b> climate change on this species found that severe change is likely to lead to a reduction in its range of around 50% by 2080; and even mild change is projected to cause a reduction of 30%; but under mid-severity scenarios the distribution may actually grow, depending on how effectively it can migrate into newly habitable areas. However, this study does not address the potential of climate change to alter fire regimes; these have already been impacted by the arrival of humans, and this change is thought to have led to a decline in the abundance and range of B.prionotes.|$|E
5|$|In 1995, GCC {{assembled}} {{an advisory}} committee of scientific and technical experts to compile an internal-only, 17-page report on climate science entitled Predicting Future Climate Change: A Primer, which said: “The scientific basis for the Greenhouse Effect and the <b>potential</b> <b>impact</b> <b>of</b> human {{emissions of greenhouse gases}} such as CO2 on climate is well established and cannot be denied.” In early 1996, GCC's operating committee asked the advisory committee to redact the sections that rebutted contrarian arguments, and accepted the report and distributed it to members. The draft document was disclosed in a 2007 lawsuit filed by the auto industry against California’s efforts to regulate automotive greenhouse gas emissions.|$|E

5|$|The <b>potential</b> <b>impact</b> <b>of</b> {{thiomersal}} on autism {{has been}} investigated extensively. Multiple lines of scientific evidence have shown that thiomersal does not cause autism. For example, the clinical symptoms of mercury poisoning differ significantly from those of autism. In addition, multiple population studies have found no association between thiomersal and autism, and rates of autism have continued to increase despite removal of thiomersal from vaccines. Thus, major scientific and medical bodies such as the Institute of Medicine and World Health Organization (WHO) as well as governmental {{agencies such as the}} Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the CDC reject any role for thiomersal in autism or other neurodevelopmental disorders. In spite of the consensus of the scientific community, some parents and advocacy groups continue to contend that thiomersal is linked to autism.|$|E
5|$|The {{survival}} {{of this species}} is tied closely to rainfall because of the susceptibility of seedlings to drought. It is thus especially vulnerable {{to the effects of}} climate change. This was recognised as early as 1992, when it was noted that winter rainfall in the Quairading region had been falling by about 4% per decade, and that a continuation of this trend may reduce the species' distribution. Recently, a more thorough assessment of the <b>potential</b> <b>impact</b> <b>of</b> climate change on this species found that severe change is likely to lead to extinction, and mild change to a reduction of its range by 80% by 2080. However, there may not be any range reduction at all under mid-severity climate change, depending on how effectively this species can migrate into newly habitable areas.|$|E
5|$|Timby et al. (2014) also {{assessed}} the <b>potential</b> <b>impact</b> <b>of</b> MFGM supplementation on cognitive development in term infants. In this double-blind RCT, term infants (<2 months old) were fed until 6 {{months of age}} either a control formula (n=64) or an MFGM-supplemented formula (n=71). A breastfed reference group (n=70) was also included. Cognitive assessment done using the BSID-III at 12 months of age showed that the MFGM-fed infants exhibited significantly higher mean cognitive scores {{than the control group}} (105.8 vs 101.8; P<0.008), and not significantly different from the breastfed reference group. In contrast, {{there were no significant differences}} in motor domain scores between the three groups, and both experimental and control formula groups scored lower than the reference group in the verbal domain.|$|E

5|$|The region between Geraldton and Gingin {{is a rich}} one for Abietinae banksias, {{and nine}} species occur there. Despite this, there is little overlap in range and habitat; Banksia scabrella is unusual in its co-occurrence with B. leptophylla. It is also {{associated}} with the endangered heath shrub Leucopogon marginatus. Burma Road Nature Reserve {{is one of the}} few protected conservation areas in its range; there, Banksia scabrella is found most commonly in (and forms a prominent part of) a mallee sedgeland, which is dominated by the cord rush Ecdeiocolea monostachya as a ground cover, and the mallee Eucalyptus eudesmoides as an emergent species. It is found occasionally in acacia scrub-heath, and rarely in acacia thickets and banksia woodland.
