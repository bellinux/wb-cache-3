50|$|<b>Purpleheart</b> {{is mainly}} used for woodworking. It is prized for fine inlay work, woodturning, cabinetry, flooring, and furniture. <b>Purpleheart</b> is also notably used for guitar or musical {{instrument}} inlays and design. Exposure to the dust, generated by cutting and sanding <b>purpleheart,</b> can cause irritation and nausea, possibly {{due to the}} presence of dalbergione (neoflavonoid) compounds in the wood. This also makes <b>purpleheart</b> wood unsuitable to most people for use in jewelry. <b>Purpleheart</b> is also a fairly expensive wood, which is why it is usually used in smaller-scale projects. <b>Purpleheart</b> is difficult to work with. If it is cut using dull blades or bits, a resin is emitted from the wood that can cause damage to the machinery. Power tools, if used improperly, can cause burn marks on the wood. In the case of purple heart being burned, the charring is quite difficult to remove due to the density and hardness of the wood.|$|E

5000|$|<b>Purpleheart</b> is an {{extremely}} dense and water-resistant wood. It is ranked {{one of the hardest}} and stiffest of the woods in the world. It is so durable that it can be used in applications that require toughness, such as truck decking. The trees are prized for their beautiful heartwood which, when cut, quickly turns from a light brown to a rich purple color. Exposure to ultraviolet (UV) light darkens the wood to a brown color with a slight hue of the original purple. The longer the wood is exposed to UV lights (e.g. sunlight), the colour of purple slowly changes from a light purple to a substantially chocolate-purple colour. This effect can be minimized with a finish containing a UV inhibitor. The dry wood is very hard and dense with a specific gravity of 0.86 (...) [...] Carbide blades are recommended when working with <b>purpleheart</b> wood. The wood is also known as amaranth and violet wood. Overharvesting has caused several species to become endangered in areas where they were once abundant.|$|E
50|$|The {{leaves are}} alternate, pinnate and {{composed}} of {{a single pair of}} leaflets that are 5-7 cm long and 2-3 cm broad. Peltogyne purpurea reproduces between August and December, depending on geographic location.

50|$|Modern {{commercial}} producers use primarily Hickory, a {{hard and}} resilient wood, {{in the construction}} of their wasters. Some producers allow individuals to accent the waster with wood of other types including Jatobá and <b>Purpleheart.</b> Manufacturers usually apply a coating of linseed oil or other protective liquid and instruct users to regularly apply it. This prevents splintering and works to create a stronger, more enduring tool. Different specimens of wood, even of the same variety, are not necessarily identical in performance, and may display different characteristics during use.|$|E

5000|$|The {{shafts of}} the woods were made of {{different}} types of wood before being replaced by hickory {{in the middle of the}} 19th century [...] The varieties of woods included ash, <b>purpleheart,</b> orangewood, and blue-mahoo. Despite the strength of hickory, the long-nose club of the mid nineteenth century was still prone to breaking at the top of the back swing. The club heads were often made from woods including apple, pear, dogwood, and beech in the early times until persimmon became the main material. Golf clubs have been improved and the shafts are now made of steel, titanium, other types of metals or carbon fiber. The shaft is a tapered steel tube or a series of stepped steel tubes in telescopic fashion. This has improved the accuracy of golfers. The grips of the clubs are made from leather or rubber.|$|E
5000|$|Teak {{has been}} used as a boatbuilding {{material}} for over 2000 years (it was found in an archaeological dig in Berenike, a port on the Indian Roman trade [...] ). In addition to relatively high strength, teak is also highly resistant to rot, fungi and mildew. In addition, teak has a relatively low shrinkage ratio, which makes it excellent for applications where it undergoes periodic changes in moisture. Teak has the unusual properties of being both an excellent structural timber for framing, planking, etc., while at the same time being easily worked, unlike some other similar woods such as <b>purpleheart,</b> and finished to a high degree. For this reason, it is also prized for the trim work on boat interiors. Due to the oily nature of the wood, care must be taken to properly prepare the wood before gluing.|$|E
50|$|Bass {{bodies are}} {{typically}} made of wood, although other {{materials such as}} graphite (for example, some of the Steinberger designs) and other lightweight composite materials have also been used.

While these traditional standards are most common, for tonal or aesthetic reasons luthiers more commonly experiment with different tonewoods on basses than with electric guitars (though this is changing), and rarer woods like walnut and figured maple, as well as exotic woods like bubinga, wenge, koa, and <b>purpleheart,</b> are often used as accent woods in the neck or on the face of mid- to high-priced production basses and on custom-made and boutique instruments.|$|E
50|$|V G Siddhartha {{has taken}} 1.85 million {{hectares}} of Amazonian forestland on a 30-year lease from the Republic of Guyana in South America {{to start a}} furniture business in India. The idea is to transport cut logs on chartered ships from the Guyanese capital Georgetown to the Mangalore Port and then carry them via road to the Coffee Day Group’s furniture plant in Chikmagalur. The Amazonian hard wood varieties coming to Indian shores through this route will include Greenheart, <b>Purpleheart,</b> Wallaba and Bullet Wood. The royalty that Siddhartha will pay the Guyanese government is not clear. Siddhartha {{declined to comment on}} the matter. A couple of years ago, the Coffee Day Group had started a furniture unit to capitalize on the huge depository of full-grown silver oak, teak wood, rose wood and mahogany trees grown in its 15,000-acres of coffee gardens in Chikmagalur. The unit designs multi-purpose furniture for home, kitchen, office, hotels and retail outlets. It also manufactures all kinds of plywood, wood boards, panel sheets and beadings, making use of the wood waste and saw powder. But it has so far remained mostly as a captive unit, serving the requirements of the Group’s coffee outlets and the resorts under the brand name Serai.|$|E
5000|$|On December 13, 1984 Gil {{wrote about}} how he earned the Purple Heart.… 40 years ago today I was a 19 year old combat infantryman in C. F, 309th Inf.Regt., 78th Inf. Division, {{participating}} in {{an attack on the}} German Wehrmacht in theHürtgen Forest in the Ardennes. Freezing cold -- snow covering everything -- in thepre-dawn darkness a flare fired from the German lines suddenly lit up the area andrevealed my company moving down a road - mortar shells and 88 shells began to fallin our midst almost immediately. My friends started dropping all around me - severalkilled instantly, others fatally wounded. I felt a blow on my left leg like someonehad hit me with a baseball bat. I hit the ground and crawled off the road into a lowspot. I realized I had dropped the spare barrel for my machine gun and crawled backout on the road and retrieved it. The company commander (Captain Brey - later killedinstantly) came up and told us to go with him and he would deploy us in the woods. We went in and established our line and came under machine gun fire and mortar fireand more of our company were killed. The captain told us to dig in and I started todig a foxhole in the frozen ground but by this time my leg really hurt and Icouldn’t stand on it and my boot was full of blood. I crawled over to Captain Breyand told him I had been hit in the leg and he told me {{to go back to the}} battalionaid station, which was several hundred yards back near the area where I was woundedin the first place. I had to crawl on my stomach the whole way as the area was underheavy fire but I made it. The medic at the battalion cut off my boot and bandaged myleg and gave me some sulfa pills. Then they put me in a jeep with some other woundedguys - a couple of stretchers and the jeep tore off at high speed for the regimentalaid station under artillery fire most of the way. We finally made it to the aidstation set up in a house and there were a couple of surgeons there working on themost severely wounded. There were quite a few bodies there and numerous guys withsevere head or chest wounds and obviously dying. I was put in an ambulance withseveral others and taken to a railhead where hospital trains were taking the woundedback into France. I don’t remember too much about that except a nurse came aroundevery few hours and gave me a shot of penicillin (pretty new stuff then) and wefinally arrived at Paris where we were taken to a large hospital. A chaplain camearound one day with a copy of general orders awarding a bunch of us the <b>PurpleHeart.</b> I still have my copy. After a week some of us were flown over to England inDC-3’s. I remember all the air force crew had parachutes but none of us wounded hadone. I asked one of the crew what we did if the Luftwaffe shot us down. He said“tough shit buddy.” Fortunately, we made it and when I arrived at the hospital inEngland I was pretty sure that I had probably survived the war. When I look back andrealize how close I came to death at the age of 19 it doesn’t seem possible that Iactually went through that experience and am alive and well today.On Friday October 25, 1985, he again remembered the war when he wrote about a tripto Europe when he worked at Kew and went sightseeing in London. “On the way toTrafalgar Square we and Pat stopped at the site of the War Room in the CabinetBuilding along St. James Park and toured the restored War Museum -very fascinatingto me since I was there at that time and lived through a lot of the history myself.”He remarked that his bad feet, perhaps never recovered from the war, suffered fromthe long walks of sightseeing. On his 72nd birthday (15 January 1997), Gilreflected, “I’m glad to be here when I look back to when I was 19 in the HürtgenForest in December 1944 and didn’t know if I would even get to be 20.” ...|$|E
