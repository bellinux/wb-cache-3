Moth density significantly affected {{the performance of the}} different traps, with P traps being more effective at low than high density. However, <b>P</b> <b>trap</b> catches decreased just prior to the onset of female captures, probably as a result of competition between traps and virgin calling females. Nearly all females caught in L and LP traps were already mated and even the first females caught had laid at least half of their egg complement. In Quebec under warm nights, the pattern of male activity occurred at different times, with peak P catches being later in the scotophase than those of L traps, but overall similar numbers of males were caught in both traps. In contrast, under cool nights, males were caught early in the night in both P and L traps, suggesting a strong competition effect between traps, although more males were caught in P than L traps overall. In Newfoundland, the pattern of male captures in L and P traps was similar at both high and low temperatures, so competition between trap types would always be high. Under these conditions P traps were more effective than L traps. Irrespective of the region, year or temperature, significantly more males were captured in LP, with the effect of L and P being additive. In both regions, females responded similarly to L and LP traps with peak activity occurring early in the night. Captures of females were lower than those of males under cool temperatures, suggesting that the temperature threshold for flight is higher for females. The use of L and P traps simultaneously and/or in combination is discussed in relation to integrated pest management programs and ecological considerations...|$|E

30|$|The <b>Ps</b> <b>trapping</b> {{formalism}} concerns positrons annihilating in porous substances as free particles or {{picking up}} an electron {{from the environment}} by forming a bound positron-electron state [1, 2]. In the ground state, the Ps atom exists as a singlet para-positronium (p-Ps) decaying intrinsically with two γ-quanta and a character lifetime in a vacuum of 0.125  ns, and triplet ortho-positronium (o-Ps) decaying with three γ-quanta and a lifetime of 142  ns. In matter, since the positron wave function is overlapping with the electrons outside, the annihilation with such electrons having an antiparallel spin decreases lifetime to 0.5 – 10  ns resulting in two γ-rays (“pick-off” annihilation) [2]. Two conditions should be satisfied to stabilize Ps, the first being sufficient size of free-volume void captured Ps and second being low electron density preventing direct positron-electron annihilation (that is why metals and semiconductors are excluded as potential Ps-forming media) [1, 2].|$|R
30|$|To {{investigate}} the detailed structural {{properties of the}} oceanic crust of subducting oceanic plate, we analyzed high-frequency (1 to 16  Hz) <b>trapped</b> <b>P</b> waves during earthquakes that occurred near the oceanic crust of the Philippine Sea plate. The distinct <b>trapped</b> <b>P</b> waves observed by the dense seismic network of the Kanto-Tokai region, Japan, did not show any apparent peak delay and frequency-dependent dispersion. These observations suggested that the oceanic crust around the source depths was characterized by a homogeneous velocity structure, rather than an inhomogeneous multiple-layered structure. This interpretation was examined by finite difference method simulations of seismic wave propagation using possible velocity structure models. The simulations demonstrated that a uniform velocity oceanic crust of the subducting Philippine Sea plate, which may result from the velocity increase in this layer at 30 to 40  km depth due to metamorphic-dehydration reactions, effectively trapped seismic energy as a short-distance waveguide and developed distinct pulse-like <b>trapped</b> <b>P</b> waves.|$|R
