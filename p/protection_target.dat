40|$|In {{this paper}} we discuss the role of concentrating solar power (CSP) and {{photovoltaics}} (PV) for reaching cost-optimal energy related greenhouse gas abatement under the constraint of a 2 °C climate <b>protection</b> <b>target.</b> We use the hybrid energy-economy-climate model ReMIND to analyze the use of solar electricity to understand which parameters determine the deployment of one or both solar technologies. We first carry out a literature review of recent studies on costs and potentials of CSP and PV. After consolidating the data into one set of parameters, we implement the two technologies in ReMIND. The results show that solar power technologies supply a significant share of electricity in the optimal abatement scenario. Sensitivity analyses of the investment costs of CSP and the learning rate of PV demonstrate that while both investment costs and learning rate have {{a major influence on}} technology deployment, CSP is used over a wide range of values. Furthermore we calculate option values for the solar technologies by running different climate stabilization scenarios in which either PV, CSP, or both, are excluded. These option values serve as an indicator for the strategic relevance of individual technologies to achieve the climate <b>protection</b> <b>target.</b> Our results suggest that excluding solar electricity from the generation mix increases the total mitigation costs as measured by GDP differences by about 80 %. To put this number into perspective, we then compare the options values for solar technologies with option values for other technologies like nuclear, carbon capture & storage (CCS) or biomass, finding that excluding solar technologies leads to higher GDP-losses than excluding either wind or nuclear, but to lower GDP-losses than excluding either CCS, all renewable technologies or biomass...|$|E
40|$|Current global marine <b>protection</b> <b>targets</b> aim {{to protect}} 10 - 30 % of marine {{habitats}} {{within the next}} 3 to 5 years. However, these targets were adopted without prior assessment of their achievability. Moreover, our ability to monitor progress towards such targets has been constrained {{by a lack of}} robust data on marine protected areas (MPAs). Here we present the results of the first explicitly marine-focused, global assessment of MPAs in relation to three global marine <b>protection</b> <b>targets.</b> We show that approximately 2. 2 million km 2, equivalent to 0. 6 % of the world’s oceans and 1. 5 % of the total marine area under national jurisdiction, are currently protected. Only 0. 08 % of the world’s oceans, and 0. 2 % of the total marine area under national jurisdiction is ‘notake’. The global distribution of MPAs is both uneven and unrepresentative at multiple scales, and only half of the world’s MPAs may be viewed as part of a coherent ‘network’. Over the last two decades, the spatial extent of marine area protected globally has grown at an annual growth rate of 5. 2 %. At this rate, even the most modest target is unlikely to be met for at least several decades, rather than within the comin...|$|R
40|$|The article {{illustrates}} the Italian pilot {{action in the}} IEE-EPISCOPE project, focussing on the analysis of energy refurbishment trends of the Piedmont region residential building stock. The methodology follows three steps: (1) definition of a knowledge-base on {{the current state of}} the building stock, (2) investigation of refurbishment scenarios considering energy efficiency measures and retrofit rates, and (3) comparison of the achievable CO 2 reductions with the climate <b>protection</b> <b>targets</b> in short and middle term. The results are addressed to local authorities to enable them to set up corrective actions to achieve the targets. Three realistic scenarios are investigated. The first one considers the annual current refurbishment trend and the most common energy Efficiency measures. The second scenario applies the measures resulting from a costo-ptimal analysis. The third scenario considers the mean annual refurbished floor area necessary to meet the climate <b>protection</b> <b>targets.</b> The results of the scenario analyses emphasise the need of implementing major refurbishments, rather than fixing stricter requirements. The building stock energy performance is assessed through the building typology approach defined in the IEE-TABULA project.

Within this land- and sea-scape, northern Australia represents a global population stronghold for four species of the world’s most threatened marine fish family, the sawfishes (family Pristidae). The distribution of sawfishes across northern Australia has previously only been coarsely estimated, and the adequacy of their representation in protected areas has not been evaluated. The calculated range of each species was intersected with Australia’s marine and terrestrial protected area datasets, and targets of 10 % marine and 17 % inland range protection were used to determine adequacy of sawfish range <b>protection.</b> Marine <b>targets</b> have been achieved for all species, but the inland range <b>protection</b> <b>targets</b> have not been met for any species.

Site-specific data were used to define a representative food web. The experimental data set for model validation and application included PCB and PCDD/F congener concentrations in sediments, in water, and in five organisms (both invertebrates and fish). The spatial distribution of risk was evaluated by dividing the lagoon into six homogeneous areas, and for each area, sediment, water, and organism dioxins concentrations were calculated. The bioaccumulation model was calibrated for both nonmetabolizing and metabolizing congeners, the metabolic elimination rates of which were estimated. The model validation showed an acceptable bioaccumulation estimation, evaluated using the model bias parameter. The calibrated model {{was applied to the}} six areas of the lagoon to estimate the fish predicted exposure concentration as 2, 3, 7, 8 -tetrachlorodibenzo-pdioxin toxicity equivalents from sediment concentration. Internal no-effect concentrations were calculated for each fish species from literature data. Risk was estimated by applying the hazard quotient (HQ) approach, obtaining the ecological risk for each fish species on the basis of 90 and 99 % protection levels, in each of the six lagoon areas. The sediment dioxins concentration does not pose a significant risk to the selected fish species at the 90 % <b>protection</b> <b>target</b> (HQ 1), whereas risk is significant (HQ 1) at the 99 % <b>protection</b> <b>target.</b> Risk results were higher near the Porto Marghera industrial district, Italy, and in lagoon zones characterized by a low water-exchange rate and freshwater basin inputs...|$|E
