50|$|For inelastic goods, {{because of}} the inverse nature of the {{relationship}} between price and quantity demanded (i.e., the law of demand), the two effects affect total revenue in opposite directions. But in determining whether to increase or decrease prices, a firm needs to know what the net effect will be. Elasticity provides the answer: The <b>percentage</b> change <b>in</b> total revenue is approximately equal to the <b>percentage</b> change <b>in</b> quantity demanded plus the <b>percentage</b> change <b>in</b> price. (One change will be positive, the other negative.) The <b>percentage</b> change <b>in</b> quantity is related to the <b>percentage</b> change <b>in</b> price by elasticity: hence the <b>percentage</b> change <b>in</b> revenue can be calculated by knowing the elasticity and the <b>percentage</b> change <b>in</b> price alone.|$|R

5|$|Based on Kinsey's scale where 0 {{represents}} {{a person with}} an exclusively heterosexual response and 6 {{represents a}} person with an exclusively homosexual one, and numbers in between represent a gradient of responses with both sexes, 6% of those interviewed ranked as a 6: exclusively homosexual.

However, the Kinsey Report remarked that the ranking described a period in a person's life, and that a person's orientation may change. Among the criticisms the Kinsey Report received, a particular one addressed the Institute for Sex Research's tendency to use statistical sampling, which facilitated an over-representation of same-sex relationships by other researchers who did not adhere to Kinsey's qualifications of data.|$|E
