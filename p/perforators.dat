5|$|Perforator veins play a {{very special}} role in the venous system, {{carrying}} blood from superficial to deep veins. During the muscular systole their valves close and stop any blood flow coming from the deep to the superficial veins. When their valves become insufficient, {{they are responsible for}} a rapid deterioration in existing varicose disease and for the development of venous ulcers. Detection of insufficient <b>perforators</b> is important because they need to be ligatured. However, the detection of competent ones is as important because they may be used strategically in new techniques of conservative surgery, for example a minimally invasive CHIVA. The ultrasonography report will include insufficient and continent <b>perforators,</b> which will also be shown on venous mapping. To test these veins properly, the examiner will need to use some techniques like the Paraná maneuver, toe and foot flexion, and hyper-extension on tip toes.|$|E
5|$|Attention will {{be focused}} on the {{direction}} of the blood flow in both of the venous systems, and in the perforator veins, as well as being focused on shunt detection. A shunting of blood from the thigh veins back into the lower leg veins will give a reflux situation. The veins most often found to be incompetent are the saphenous veins and the <b>perforators</b> communicating with the deep veins of the thigh.|$|E
40|$|Local <b>perforator</b> flaps {{have evolved}} over the time to provide {{complete}} and stable coverage of soft tissue defects. Technical advances and experience with the <b>perforator</b> flaps have allowed the harvest of local <b>perforator</b> flaps in a free style manner by of-fering greater freedom in flap selection. We have proposed a technical modification in the harvest of a <b>perforator</b> flap by relo-cating the <b>perforator</b> to an anatomically favorable location. This has led to decreased traction over the <b>perforator</b> and provided some amount of added length to the <b>perforator...</b>|$|R
40|$|In <b>perforator</b> flap reconstruction, {{vascular}} mapping using preoperative {{computed tomography}} (CT) angiography {{is widely used}} to confirm the existence and location of an appropriate <b>perforator.</b> This study proposes a rapid, accurate, and convenient method for marking the <b>perforator</b> location on the skin surface. For 12 patients who underwent <b>perforator</b> flap reconstruction between November 2011 and November 2013, metal clips were fixed on the skin surface at the anticipated <b>perforator</b> locations, which were decided using a handheld Doppler. CT angiography {{was used to compare}} the location between the metal clip and the actual <b>perforator.</b> The metal clip was moved and repositioned, if needed, {{on the basis of the}} CT images. The locations of the appropriate <b>perforator</b> and the metal clip, which were observed during the surgery, were then compared. In CT angiography, the mean distance between the metal clip and the <b>perforator</b> was 3 ± 3. 9 mm, and the mean distance that was measured during surgery was 0. 8 ± 0. 8 mm. In conclusion, we report a simple, rapid, and precise technique to indicate the accurate location of the appropriate <b>perforator</b> on the skin surface...|$|R

25|$|The {{technique}} of the MS-TRAM flap {{is similar to}} the {{technique of}} the DIEAP flap, but the MS-TRAM flap is used if the <b>perforators</b> of the abdominal wall are located in different intramuscular layers and the muscle fibres between these vessels would need to be divided. This gives damage to the rectus muscle, necessitating a reinforcing mesh repair and causing higher chance of postoperative complications such as abdominal wall weakness, bulging or herniation. In this situation the MS-TRAM flap is performed, in which a small cuff of muscle fibres between and around the <b>perforators</b> is incorporated.|$|E
50|$|The <b>perforator</b> {{propeller}} flap is {{the propeller}} flap {{which is used}} most commonly. It is a <b>perforator</b> flap with a skin island, which is separated in a larger and smaller paddle by the nourishing <b>perforator.</b> These paddles can rotate around the <b>perforator</b> (pedicle), for as many degrees as the anatomical situation requires (90-180 degrees). This flap looks like a propeller when the two paddles are not too different in size.|$|R

40|$|The {{introduction}} of <b>perforator</b> flaps by Koshima and Soeda in 1989 {{was met with}} much animosity in the surgical community. The flaps challenged conventional teaching and were often branded as being unsafe. Surgeries using <b>perforator</b> flaps are now routinely practiced all over the world, with increasing emphasis on minimizing donor site morbidity, and <b>perforator</b> flaps are becoming the current gold standard. The simple principles and techniques of <b>perforator</b> dissection {{can be applied to}} all <b>perforator</b> flaps, provided the surgeon has an intimate knowledge of the regional anatomy. Thus, virtually any piece of skin can be harvested as long as it incorporates a feeding vessel. This article highlights the essential techniques in planning and raising <b>perforator</b> flaps and the common pitfalls to be avoided...|$|R
25|$|Harvesting of the IGAP flap {{is similar}} to raising the SGAP flap, however, the flap is taken from the lower buttock area {{including}} one or more <b>perforators</b> of the inferior gluteal vessels.|$|E

40|$|A 24 -year-old male {{presented}} {{after being}} involved in a motorcycle accident and {{was found to have}} soft tissue defects of the knee with exposure of patella. Due to the severe injury from the popliteal fossa to the posterior aspects of the lower leg, repair with a free flap from anterolateral thigh <b>perforator</b> was planned instead of local calf muscle flap. Preoperative angiography was performed, and it showed that superior medial genicular <b>perforator</b> was patent compared with unreliable filling of the superior lateral genicular <b>perforator.</b> The soft tissue defect was repaired using the superior medial genicular <b>perforator</b> as the recipient vessel. This was performed by creating <b>perforator</b> to <b>perforator</b> anastomosis (supermicrosurgery). The flap survived successfully, and the patient was able to ambulate in a few weeks without serious complications. This case indicates that superior medial genicular <b>perforator</b> can be used as the recipient vessel for covering the soft tissue defects of the knee caused by blunt injury...|$|R
40|$|During {{the past}} 20 years, the neural anatomy of many flaps has been investigated, {{although}} no extensive {{studies have been}} reported yet on the anterolateral thigh flap. The goal {{of this study was}} to describe the sensory territories of the nerves supplying the anterolateral thigh flap with dissections on fresh cadavers and with local anesthetic injections in living subjects. The sensate anterolateral thigh flap is typically described as innervated by the lateral cutaneous femoral nerve. Two other well-known nerves, the superior <b>perforator</b> nerve and the median <b>perforator</b> nerve, which enter the flap at its medial border, might have a role in anterolateral thigh flap innervation. Twenty-nine anterolateral thigh flaps were elevated in 15 cadavers, and the lateral cutaneous femoral nerve, the superior <b>perforator</b> nerve, and median <b>perforator</b> nerve were dissected. In the injection study, the lateral cutaneous femoral nerve, superior <b>perforator</b> nerve, and median <b>perforator</b> nerve in 16 thighs of eight subjects were sequentially blocked. The resulting sensory deficit from each injection was mapped on the skin and superimposed on the marked anterolateral thigh flap territory. The study shows that the sensate anterolateral thigh flap is basically innervated by all three nerves. The lateral cutaneous femoral nerve was present in 29 of 29 thighs, whereas the superior <b>perforator</b> nerve was present in 25 of 29 and the median <b>perforator</b> nerve in 24 of 29 thighs. Furthermore, in the proximal half of the flap, the lateral cutaneous femoral nerve lies deep,, whereas the superior <b>perforator</b> nerve and median <b>perforator</b> nerve lie more superficially. Whereas the lateral cutaneous femoral nerve innervates the entire flap, the superior <b>perforator</b> nerve innervates 25 percent of the flap and the median <b>perforator</b> nerve innervates 60 percent of the flap. Clinically, a small anterolateral thigh flap (7 X 5 cm) can be raised sparing the lateral cutaneous femoral nerve and using only the selective areas innervated by the superior <b>perforator</b> and median <b>perforator</b> nerves. Alternatively, a large anterolateral thigh flap can be raised with this multiple innervation. This can be helpful if one wants to harvest the flap under local anesthesia. Sensate bilobed flaps can be harvested when dual innervated flaps are required...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background and objectives: <b>Perforator</b> flaps, both pedicled {{and free}} flaps, are {{increasingly}} used in reconstructive surgery. However, the microvascular perfusion pattern within these flaps still remains essentially unknown. It {{is well known}} that in random-pattern flaps, flap length correlates directly with the width of the flap base. In <b>perforator</b> flaps, the importance of preserving a skin base is still an object of debate. We hypothesized that by dividing the skin base peripheral tissue perfusion in islanded <b>perforator</b> flaps increases. The abdominal panniculus in patients submitted to elective abdominoplasty was used to test and compare <b>perforator</b> flaps (intact skin bridge at the flap base in addition to a single <b>perforator)</b> and islanded <b>perforator</b> flaps (a single <b>perforator</b> located {{at the base of the}} flap only). Methods: Flap perfusion was measured using dynamic laser induced fluorescence videoangiography (IC-VIEW, PULSION medical systems AG, Munich, Germany). The abdominoplasty flap was used to create the intended flaps and the fluorescent dye indocyanine green (ICG) was injected intravenously. Special software (IC-CALC) was used for quantitative analysis. The fluorescence intensity was compared after 2 minutes of registration. The results are presented as mean ± SEM, and considered statistical significant when P < 0. 05. Results: An increase in mean pixel intensity represents an increase in tissue perfusion. After surgical release of the skin base in the <b>perforator</b> flaps, the ICG fluorescence increased in zone I (the most distal zone) in the islanded <b>perforator</b> flaps (n= 24, P< 0. 05 both compared to control and the flaps with skin base intact) Conclusions: Conversion of a <b>perforator</b> flap with skin base intact into an islanded <b>perforator</b> flap by dividing the skin base increases distal tissue perfusion. This finding could potentially enhance flap mobility and length- two major concerns in flap design...|$|R
40|$|In 2009, we have {{described}} the use of freestyle facial artery <b>perforator</b> flaps for one-stage nose reconstruction. Since then, several articles have reported the use of facial artery <b>perforator</b> flaps for nose reconstruction. The {{purpose of this article}} is to provide an update of the published technique after 10 years of experience. Since 2004, 21 patients have been treated with a freestyle facial artery <b>perforator</b> flap for one-stage reconstruction of the nasal ala. The flaps were 16 propellers, 4 V-Y, and 1 island transposition. A single venous congestion leading to a minor flap tip necrosis and a wound dehiscence was observed. All other flaps healed uneventfully. The V-Y design and multiple subunit reconstruction gave suboptimal results. It was concluded that indications for freestyle facial artery <b>perforator</b> flaps are total nasal alar subunit reconstruction or reconstruction of lateral alar defects when <b>perforator</b> anatomy allows. In these cases, freestyle facial artery <b>perforator</b> flaps are the first choice technique at our institution because they allow excellent results in one-stage operation.

25|$|Surgical post-mastectomy breast {{reconstruction}} requires general anaesthesia, {{cuts the}} chest muscles, produces new scars, and requires a long post-surgical recovery for the patient.

The TRAM flap (Transverse Rectus Abdominis Myocutaneous flap) procedure reconstructs the breast using an autologous flap of abdominal, cutaneous, and muscle tissues.

The DIEP flap (Deep Inferior Epigastric <b>Perforators)</b> procedure uses an autologous flap of abdominal skin and fat tissue.|$|E
25|$|During the Archaic Period, from 6000–1000 BC, mixed conifer-hardwood forests {{as well as}} mixed prairie-forests {{replaced}} Wisconsin's conifer forests. People {{continued to}} depend on hunting and gathering. Around 4000 BC they developed spear-throwers and copper tools such as axes, adzes, projectile points, knives, <b>perforators,</b> fishhooks and harpoons. Copper ornaments like beaded necklaces also appeared around 1500 BC. These people gathered copper ore at quarries on the Keweenaw Peninsula in Michigan and on Isle Royale in Lake Superior. They may have crafted copper artifacts by hammering and folding the metal and also by heating it to increase its malleability. However it is not certain if these people reached the level of copper smelting. Regardless, the Copper Culture of the Great Lakes region reached a level of sophistication unprecedented in North America. The Late Archaic Period also saw the emergence of cemeteries and ritual burials, {{such as the one}} in Oconto.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} the scheme to select alternative flaps {{limited to the}} region of the ipsilateral thigh when the <b>perforator</b> of the anterolateral thigh flap is not feasible. Total of 564 consecutive microsurgery cases using anterolateral thigh <b>perforator</b> flap was reviewed from March of 2001 to January of 2009. Total of 12 cases used a contingent flap due to anatomical and technical complications of the anterolateral thigh <b>perforator.</b> The alternatives were skin <b>perforator</b> flaps adjacent to the initial flap (3 cases of upper anterolateral thigh flap, 4 cases of anteromedial thigh flap), vastus lateralis muscle flap with skin graft (2 cases), and anterolateral thigh flap as septocutaneous flap without a prominent <b>perforator</b> on the septum (3 cases). All flaps survived and provided coverage as planned but one case using septocutaneous flap without a prominent <b>perforator</b> was noted with partial necrosis. Adjacent flaps around the anterolateral thigh <b>perforator</b> flap may provide useful alternative flaps in cases of failed elevation. Limiting the contingent secondary flap to this region may reduce further donor site morbidity and still provide an adequate flap for reconstruction...|$|R

5000|$|Soft tissue defects due to trauma {{or after}} tumor {{extirpation}} are important medical and cosmetic topics. Therefore, reconstructive surgeons {{have developed a}} variety of surgical techniques to conceal the soft tissue defects by using tissue transfers, better known as flaps. In {{the course of time}} these flaps have rapidly evolved from [...] "random-pattern flaps with an unknown blood supply, through axial-pattern flaps with a known blood supply to muscle and musculocutaneous <b>perforator</b> flaps" [...] {{for the sole purpose of}} optimal reconstruction with minimum donor-site morbidity.Koshima and Soeda were the first to use the name “perforator flaps” in 1989 [...] and since then <b>perforator</b> flaps have become more popular in reconstructive microsurgery. Thus <b>perforator</b> flaps, using autologous tissue with preservation of fascia, muscle and nerve represent the future of flaps. The most frequently used <b>perforator</b> flaps nowadays are the deep inferior epigastric <b>perforator</b> flap (DIEP flap), and both the superior and inferior gluteal (SGAP/ IGAP) flap, all three mainly used for breast reconstruction; the lateral circumflex femoral artery <b>perforator</b> (LCFAP) flap (previously named anterolateral thigh or ALT flap) and the thoracodorsal artery <b>perforator</b> (TAP) flap, mainly for the extremities and the head and neck region as a free flap and for breast and thoracic wall reconstruction as a pedicled <b>perforator</b> flap.|$|R
2500|$|Another theme {{exhibited}} in this hall is autosacrifice, a ritual that {{was conducted in}} private as a personal act of communication with the gods. Widespread throughout the entire population, this practice was performed by perforating certain fleshy parts of the body—such as the earlobes, lips, tongue, chest, calves, et cetera—with obsidian blades, agave needles or bone <b>perforators.</b> Once the implement was covered with blood, it was inserted in straw balls called Zacatapayoli. The entirety was probably placed in ceremonial boxes—tepetlacalli—as an offering to the gods. Objects associated with human sacrifice are the [...] "face blades" [...] or knives decorated with eyes and teeth, as well as skull [...] masks. Other ceremonial items include musical instruments, jewelry, and braziers for the burning of copal.|$|E
50|$|It is {{questionable}} whether these <b>perforators</b> are true <b>perforators,</b> {{because it might}} be more logical to not include these <b>perforators.</b> The surgical approach needed for direct <b>perforators</b> is slightly different from the one needed for indirect <b>perforators.</b> When direct <b>perforators</b> are not included, surgeons can focus on the anatomy of the perforator and the source vessel.|$|E

30|$|A local perforator-based pedicled flap {{permits a}} certain degree of {{flexibility}} in operative planning and decision-making.

Preoperative Doppler-marking of the <b>perforator</b> allows planning of incisions and flap designs. However, it is almost impossible to quantify or limit the area or territory supplied by a particular <b>perforator</b> owing to several factors: the diameter of the perforating vessel may vary or a part of the flap can fail to sustain itself on blood supply from a relatively distant <b>perforator.</b> This may lead to partial necrosis of the <b>perforator</b> flap in the postoperative period. Such partial necrosis may be due to part of the flap being elevated from the zone of injury.|$|R
