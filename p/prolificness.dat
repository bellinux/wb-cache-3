5|$|The {{breeding}} of farm animals seldom occurs spontaneously but is managed by farmers {{with a view}} to encouraging certain traits that are seen as desirable. These include hardiness, <b>prolificness,</b> mothering abilities, fast growth rates, low feed consumption per unit of growth, better body proportions, higher yields, better fibre qualities and other characteristics. Undesirable traits such as health defects, aggressiveness or lack of docility are selected against. Selective breeding has been responsible for some large increases in productivity. In 2007, a typical broiler chicken at eight weeks old was 4.8 times as heavy as a bird of similar age in 1957. In the thirty years to 2007, the average milk yield of a dairy cow in the United States nearly doubled.|$|E

60|$|Domestication, as {{a general}} rule, {{increases}} the <b>prolificness</b> of animals and plants. It eliminates the tendency to sterility which is common to species when first taken from a state of nature and crossed. On this latter head we have no direct evidence; but as our races of dogs, cattle, pigs etc., are almost certainly descended from aboriginally distinct stocks, and as these races are now fully fertile together, or at least incomparably more fertile than most species when crossed, we may with entire confidence accept this conclusion.|$|E
60|$|As {{the truest}} society {{approaches}} always nearer to solitude, so the most excellent speech finally falls into Silence. Silence is audible to all men, at all times, {{and in all}} places. She is when we hear inwardly, sound when we hear outwardly. Creation has not displaced her, but is her visible framework and foil. All sounds are her servants, and purveyors, proclaiming not only that their mistress is, but is a rare mistress, and earnestly to be sought after. They are so far akin to Silence, that they are but bubbles on her surface, which straightway burst, an evidence of the strength and <b>prolificness</b> of the under-current; a faint utterance of Silence, and then only agreeable to our auditory nerves when they contrast themselves with and relieve the former. In proportion as they do this, and are heighteners and intensifiers of the Silence, they are harmony and purest melody.|$|E
60|$|It is {{impossible}} not to be struck with the double parallelism between the two classes of facts just alluded to. On the one hand, slight changes in the conditions of life, and crosses between slightly modified forms or varieties, are beneficial as far as <b>prolificness</b> and constitutional vigour are concerned. On the other hand, changes in the conditions greater in degree, or of a different nature, and crosses between forms which have been slowly and greatly modified by natural means,--in other words, between species,--are highly injurious, {{as far as the}} reproductive system is concerned, and in some few instances as far as constitutional vigour is concerned. Can this parallelism be accidental? Does it not rather indicate some real bond of connection? As a fire goes out unless it be stirred up, so the vital forces are always tending, according to Mr. Herbert Spencer, to a state of equilibrium, unless disturbed and renovated through the action of other forces.|$|E
60|$|Of course, the {{district}} of St. Petersburg, with its icy winter, its low and powerless sun, and its twelve inches of annual rain, must necessarily present, in all its phenomena of vegetable and animal life, a striking contrast to the exuberant <b>prolificness</b> of New Grenada. It is, however, after all, not absolutely the opposite extreme. There are certain regions {{on the surface of}} the earth that are actually rainless; and it is these which present us with the true and real contrast to the luxuriant vegetation and teeming life of the country of the Amazon. In these rainless regions all is necessarily silence, desolation, and death. No plant can grow; no animal can live. Man, too, is forever and hopelessly excluded. If the exuberant abundance of animal and vegetable life shut him out, in some measure, from regions which an excess of heat and moisture render too prolific, the total absence of them still more effectually forbids him a home in these. They become, therefore, vast wastes of dry and barren sands in which no root can find nourishment, and of dreary rocks to which not even a lichen can cling.|$|E
60|$|Although the {{domestic}} goose certainly differs somewhat from any known wild species, yet {{the amount of}} variation which it has undergone, as {{compared with that of}} most domesticated animals, is singularly small. This fact can be partially accounted for by selection not having come largely into play. Birds of all kinds which present many distinct races are valued as pets or ornaments; no one makes a pet of the goose; the name, indeed, in more languages than one, is a term of reproach. The goose is valued for its size and flavour, for the whiteness of its feathers which adds to their value, and for its <b>prolificness</b> and tameness. In all these points the goose differs from the wild parent-form; and these are the points which have been selected. Even in ancient times the Roman gourmands valued the liver of the WHITE goose; and Pierre Belon (8/32. 'L'Hist. de la Nature des Oiseaux' par P. Belon 1555 page 156. With respect to the livers of white geese being preferred by the Romans see Isid. Geoffroy St.-Hilaire 'Hist. Nat. Gen.' tome 3 page 58.) in 1555 speaks of two varieties, one of which was larger, more fecund, and of a better colour than the other; and he expressly states that good managers attended to the colour of their goslings, so that they might know which to preserve and select for breeding.|$|E

5000|$|If we {{consider}} the vegetable kingdom generally, it must be recollected, that even of the seeds which are well ripened, the greater part are either eaten by insects, birds, and other animals, or decay for want of room and opportunity to germinate. Unhealthy plants are the first which are cut off by causes prejudicial to the species, being usually stifled by more vigorous individuals of their own kind. If, therefore, the relative fecundity or hardiness of hybrids be in the least degree inferior, they cannot maintain their footing for many generations, {{even if they were}} ever produced beyond one generation in a wild state. In the universal struggle for existence, the right of the strongest eventually prevails; and the strength and durability of a race depends mainly on its <b>prolificness,</b> in which hybrids are acknowledged to be deficient.|$|E
5000|$|Sadler scrutinised Malthus's An Essay on the Principle of Population {{and became}} {{convinced}} that the statistics it quoted in support were unsound (or where sound mis-used). From his own studies of census data for England in 1810 and 1820 [...] he concluded that the birthrate per hundred marriages was lower in the more densely populated counties; {{he went on to}} argue that this was because the more densely populated counties enjoyed a higher standard of living, and that prosperity, not poverty, was the more effective check on population growth. Sadler published (1830) the Law of Population which he derived from this detailed examination of available population statistics (The <b>Prolificness</b> of human beings, otherwise similarly circumstanced, varies inversely as their numbers) in a large book of the same name [...] "more than thirteen hundred closely-printed pages, crowded with an hundred-and-four statistical tables" [...] which left most reviewers at a loss for words. However, Thomas Babington Macaulay writing in the Edinburgh Review, was neither daunted nor impressed, beginning his reviewWe did not expect a good book from Mr Sadler and it is well that we did not for he has given us a very bad one. The matter of his treatise is extraordinary the manner more extraordinary still. His arrangement is confused, his repetitions endless, his style every thing which it ought not to be. Instead of saying {{what he has to say}} with the perspicuity, the precision, and the simplicity in which consists the eloquence proper to scientific writing, he indulges without measure in vague, bombastic declamation, made up of those fine things which boys of fifteen admire, and which every body, who is not destined to be a boy all his life, weeds vigorously out of his compositions after five-and-twenty.going on to point out that even Sadler's analysis did not support an inverse relationship in the technical/accurate meaning of the term, but rather a mild tailing off of fecundity at higher population densities which did not invalidate Malthus, attacking various details of Sadler's analysis, and ending 25 pages later: We have shown that Mr Sadler is careless in the collection of facts, — that he is incapable of reasoning on facts when he has collected them, — that he does not understand the simplest terms of science, — that he has enounced a proposition of which he does not know the meaning,— that the proposition which he means to enounce, and which he tries to prove, leads directly to all those consequences which he represents as impious and immoral, — and that, from the very documents to which he has himself appealed, it may be demonstrated that his theory is false. Sadler replied in a pamphlet showing that Macaulay had indulged in considerable misrepresentation of the content of the book. In June 1832, Sadler was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society.|$|E

40|$|There {{have been}} {{considerable}} {{efforts in the}} literature towards understanding and modeling dynamic aspects of scientific communities. Despite the great interest, {{little is known about}} the role that different members play in the formation of the underlying network structure of such communities. In this paper, we provide a wide investigation of the roles that members of the core of scientific communities play in the collaboration network structure formation and evolution. To do that, we define a community core based on an individual metric, core score, which is an h-index derived metric that captures both, the <b>prolificness</b> and the involvement of researchers in a community. Our results provide a number of key observations related to community formation and evolving patterns. Particularly, we show that members of the community core work as bridges that connect smaller clustered research groups. Furthermore, these members are responsible for an increase in the average degree of the whole community underlying network and a decrease on the overall network assortativeness. More important, we note that variations on the members of the community core tend to be strongly correlated with variations on these metrics. We argue that our observations are important for shedding a light on the role of key members on community formation and structure...|$|E
