40|$|<b>Paldimycin</b> (U- 70138 F) {{is a new}} {{antimicrobial}} agent with activity against gram-positive cocci. Clinical isolates of staphylococci and streptococci were tested. MICs were higher in Mueller-Hinton broth than in nutrient broth. Change in pH had minimal effect on the MICs in either broth. When inoculum size was varied, an inoculum effect was observed. The gram-positive cocci tested were generally more susceptible to <b>paldimycin</b> than to vancomycin...|$|E
40|$|The {{in vitro}} {{activity}} of <b>paldimycin,</b> a novel antimicrobial agent, was {{compared with that}} of vancomycin against 306 gram-positive isolates (representing 12 bacterial species) obtained from patients with cancer. <b>Paldimycin</b> had lower MICs for 90 % of isolates than vancomycin did against most isolates tested. Its activity, however, was medium and pH dependent, being greatest in Nutrient broth at a pH of 6. 8...|$|E
40|$|The {{in vitro}} {{activities}} of daptomycin (LY 146032), <b>paldimycin</b> (U- 70, 138 F), vancomycin, and penicillin G against 344 clinical isolates of anaerobic gram-positive bacteria {{were determined by}} an agar dilution method in calcium-supplemented (50 micrograms/ml) Wilkins-Chalgren medium, using an inoculum of 10 (5) CFU. Daptomycin demonstrated excellent activity against {{a broad range of}} anaerobic gram-positive cocci and bacilli, including Peptostreptococcus, Eubacterium, Bifidobacterium, Actinomyces, Propionibacterium, and Lactobacillus species and Clostridium difficile. Highly resistant strains (MIC, {{greater than or equal to}} 64 micrograms/ml) were encountered sporadically from different genera, but these accounted for only 3 % of all isolates tested. Vancomycin showed similar activity but was less active against Lactobacillus species and Peptostreptococcus prevotii. <b>Paldimycin</b> was inactive against most genera of anaerobic gram-positive bacteria. Overall, penicillin G remained the most broadly active agent against these isolates...|$|E
40|$|A bovine {{polymorphonuclear}} leukocyte (PMN) monolayer {{system was}} used to determine the ability of different antibiotics to kill surviving intracellular Staphylococcus aureus. The following classes of antimicrobial agents were tested in this high-volume assay procedure: aminocyclitol, beta-lactam, coumarin, lincosaminide, macrolide, naphthalenic ansamycin, paulomycin, peptide, quinolone, and tetracycline. The activities of these compounds were compared with those of positive (rifampin), negative (cloxacillin), and non-antibiotic-treated controls. Only oxytetracycline, the ansamycins (rifampin, rifamycin SV, streptovaricin A, C, and D), paulomycin, and <b>paldimycin</b> caused a significant reduction in the viable count of intracellular S. aureus. Of these, however, the intracellular killing by the streptovaricins was directly related to the cytotoxicity (as determined by trypan blue exclusion) of these compounds for the PMNs. Although the paulomycins were cytotoxic for the PMNs, the cytotoxic and the intracellular killing activity of these new compounds could be distinguished. The relevance of these results to the therapeutic effectiveness of these antibiotics in the treatment of bovine staphylococcal mastitis is discussed...|$|E
