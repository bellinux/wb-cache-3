50|$|In {{the rural}} areas of the {{alluvial}} plain and in the lower Diyala region, settlement almost invariably clusters near the rivers, streams, and irrigation canals. The bases {{of the relationship between}} watercourse and settlement have been summarized by Robert McCormick Adams, director of the Oriental Institute of the University of Chicago. He notes that the levees laid down by streams and canals provide advantages for both settlement and agriculture. Surface water drains more easily on the levees' back-slope, and the coarse soils of the levees are easier to cultivate and permit better subsurface drainage. The height of the levees gives some <b>protection</b> <b>against</b> floods and <b>the</b> <b>frost</b> that often affect low-lying areas and may kill and/or damage winter crops. Above all, those living or cultivating on the crest of a levee have easy access to water for irrigation and household use in a dry, hot country.|$|R

40|$|A snow cave is a bivouac shelter used in {{mountain}} climbing that {{is widely used}} as a shelter <b>against</b> <b>the</b> cold during winter. In the outdoors, wind velocity and air temperature have an influence on temperature change. It could stabilize body temperature if it can control the convection of ambient air. This paper could develop a theory focusing on the relation between physiological indexes and <b>the</b> <b>protection</b> <b>against</b> <b>the</b> cold while staying in a snow cave. For example, <b>protection</b> <b>against</b> <b>the</b> cold could be thermal insulation underwear, thermal insulation gloves, thermal insulation socks, a steam warmed temperature sheet and a rescue sheet. Measurement items were heart rate, blood pressure, rectal temperature, score of a subjective thermal sensation and {{the activity of the}} parasympathetic nervous system. It was clarified that <b>the</b> <b>protection</b> <b>against</b> <b>the</b> cold could be effective for the decrease of the physiological index. These field studies suggest that they would enable the adaptation in the adjustment range of the autonomic nervous system given these <b>protections</b> <b>against</b> <b>the</b> cold...|$|R
