50|$|In the mid 1990s, the tablets were {{replaced}} with barcoded <b>pull</b> <b>tags</b> placed on/near each {{item in the}} showroom. Customers took these to the cashier instead of the tablet in order to purchase the item, which would still be retrieved from the stockroom. By the late-1990s, many of the showrooms had been converted to allow a more traditional approach to shopping {{in addition to the}} catalog ordering process. By 2000, all of the remaining showrooms had been downsized and the catalog-style shopping approach was officially abandoned.|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} we present {{the concept of}} Audio-tactile Location Markers (ALMs) as a remedy {{to the lack of}} {{accessibility}} in current tag-based applications. ALMs are an auxiliary enhancement for existing real-world tags, which propagates their existence and purpose to blind and vision-impaired people in the vicinity. Users can activate an audible signal based on a pre-selection of available <b>tags</b> (<b>pull)</b> or choose to be constantly informed about nearby tags (push). We evaluated both methods with blind and vision-impaired people using an NFC-enabled smartphone. Participants experienced no problems locating the ALM based on the audible signal, but required assistance with touching the <b>tag.</b> <b>Pull</b> was favored to push in specific situations...|$|R
5000|$|Rafty Race: This game {{consists}} of multiple checkpoints along the beach. To start, each player must race {{to put on}} large swim fins, then run to the first checkpoint. There are a total of 16 swim fins, and three players — one male and two female — will be left without any fins, eliminating them from {{the remainder of the}} race. Once each player has put their swim fins on, they race to the first checkpoint, in which they have to <b>pull</b> a <b>tag</b> that is needed to inflate rafts with air pumps and grab color-coded tags at the second checkpoint, which are green for the men and red for the women. There are a total of 10 air pumps, five for each gender, and one player of each gender will be left without an air pump, and eliminated from the race. If a player does not <b>pull</b> a <b>tag,</b> he/she is eliminated. Once the remaining players have inflated their rafts, they will race through the water toward the third checkpoint — a buoy, which contains six oars — three for each gender. For each gender, there is one fewer raft than there are players, so the players that are left without a paddle are eliminated. After grabbing the oars, each player will paddle their way to the fourth checkpoint, which contains one of four keys needed to grab a key that will unlock a treasure chest at the final checkpoint. Only two players per gender will compete for grabbing a flag from the treasure chest, with the first player of each gender racing {{to the end of the}} beach, and winning the race.|$|R
50|$|Because {{inconsistencies}} {{had been}} found with the FQIS in other 767s, Boeing had issued a service bulletin for the routine checking of this system. An engineer in Edmonton duly did so when the aircraft arrived from Toronto following a trouble-free flight {{the day before the}} incident. While conducting this check, the FQIS failed and the cockpit fuel gauges went blank. The engineer had encountered the same problem earlier in the month when this same aircraft had arrived from Toronto with an FQIS fault. He found then that disabling the second channel by pulling the circuit breaker in the cockpit restored the fuel gauges to working order albeit with only the single FQIS channel operative. In the absence of any spares he simply repeated this temporary fix by <b>pulling</b> and <b>tagging</b> the circuit breaker.|$|R
50|$|For {{catching}} other marine {{animals such as}} fish, {{different methods}} are used. For the gill-netting operation, the fish boat would pull a long net at its back, which fish will flow into. For the seine fishing operation, fishermen will place a rounded net into the sea {{when they see a}} school of fish swim by. The long-lining operation consists of the fish boat <b>pulling</b> a string, <b>tagged</b> with little fish, to attract and lure the fish onto the string.|$|R
40|$|Embryonic {{stem cells}} (ESCs), with their dual {{capacity}} to self-renew and differentiate, {{are commonly used}} to study differentiation, epigenetic regulation, lineage choices, and more. Using non-directed retroviral integration of a YFP/Cherry exon into mouse ESCs, we generated a library of over 200 endogenously tagged fluorescent fusion proteins and present several proof-of-concept applications of this library. We show the utility of this library to track proteins in living cells; screen for pluripotency-related factors; identify heterogeneously expressing proteins; measure the dynamics of endogenously labeled proteins; track proteins recruited to sites of DNA damage; <b>pull</b> down <b>tagged</b> fluorescent fusion proteins using anti-Cherry antibodies; and test for interaction partners. Thus, this library {{can be used in}} a variety of different directions, either exploiting the fluorescent tag for imaging-based techniques or utilizing the fluorescent fusion protein for biochemical pull-down assays, including immunoprecipitation, co-immunoprecipitation, chromatin immunoprecipitation, and more...|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{the work}} {{presented}} in this thesis was to establish chromatin immunoprecipitation method in our laboratory {{as a tool to}} study target genes of the nuclear receptor NHR- 25 in C. elegans. Once the method is established, it will be also useful for studies of other DNA binding proteins. ChIP was performed in transiently transfected cells HEK 293 and analyzed using PCR and qPCR. Although ChIP is typically used to find authentic target genes in the cell or in organisms, testing protein-DNA interactions by ChIP in transient transfection system (by transfecting both the expression vector of the protein of interest and a vector containing potential binding sequence/promoter of the protein) can be useful as it serves as a relatively quick tool to confirm the direct binding. Since the detection is by PCR, this method is sensitive yet less costly non radioactive method to analyze protein-DNA interaction. For the first step towards ChIP in C. elegans; <b>pulling</b> down <b>tagged</b> protein directly from the worm was also performed as a preparation for in vivo analysis of NHR- 25 regulated genes...|$|R

Tie a very loose overhand knot using the doubled loop and the doubled section of line leading back to the fishing rod. Pass the object to be tied through the remaining loop of the overhand knot and slide the loop up onto the line just above the eye of the hook. Moisten the knot to lessen the friction and <b>pull</b> on the <b>tag</b> and standing ends evenly to snug the knot down. Trim the free end of the line to a length of about 3mm.|$|R
40|$|The Klebsiella oxytoca {{pullulanase}} secreton (type II secretion system) components PulM and <b>PulL</b> were <b>tagged</b> {{at their}} N termini with {{green fluorescent protein}} (GFP), and their subcellular location was examined by fluorescence microscopy and fractionation. When produced at moderate levels without other secreton components in Escherichia coli, both chimeras were envelope associated, as are the native proteins. Fluorescent GFP-PulM was evenly distributed over the cell envelope, with occasional brighter foci. Under the same conditions, GFP-PulL was barely detectable in the envelope by fluorescence microscopy. When produced together with all other secreton components, GFP-PulL exhibited circumferential fluorescence, with numerous brighter patches. The envelope-associated fluorescence of GFP-PulL was almost completely abolished when native PulL was also produced, suggesting that the chimera cannot compete with PulL for association with other secreton components. The patches of GFP-PulL might represent functional secretons, since GFP-PulM also appeared in similar patches. GFP-PulM and GFP-PulL both appeared in spherical polar foci when made at high levels. In K. oxytoca, GFP-PulM was evenly distributed over the cell envelope, with few patches, whereas GFP-PulL showed only weak envelope-associated fluorescence. These data suggest that, in contrast to their Vibrio cholerae Eps secreton counterparts (M. Scott, Z. Dossani, and M. Sandkvist, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 98 : 13978 - 13983, 2001), PulM and PulL do not localize specifically to the cell poles and that the Pul secreton is distributed over the cell surface...|$|R
50|$|Limitations of PSAT {{technology}} {{are that it}} is subject to loss by malfunction of the power source, environmental effects such as biofouling, ingestion by a predator, its depth limitation and cost. Most PSATS have internal software designed to detect damaging or sub-optimal conditions that will trigger an early release and transmission of data. For example, PSATs can withstand pressures to depths of 2000 to 2500 m depending on the model. If data indicate no change in pressure (depth) {{for a period of}} time, this could trigger an early release due to premature release (a <b>tag</b> <b>pulling</b> out of the fish early) or death of the animal to which it was attached. Such internal checks can alert researchers to unexpected or undesirable events. Ingestion by a predator is more difficult to detect in the sense of forcing a tag to report; however, in data processing it is indicated by an immediate loss of light and an increase in temperature that stabilizes while it is inside the predator.|$|R
40|$|In the AAA+ ClpXP protease, ClpX {{uses the}} energy of ATP binding and {{hydrolysis}} to unfold proteins before translocating them into ClpP for degradation. For proteins with C-terminal ssrA <b>tags,</b> ClpXP <b>pulls</b> on the <b>tag</b> to initiate unfolding and subsequent degradation. Here, we demonstrate that an initial step in ClpXP unfolding of the 11 -stranded β barrel of superfolder GFP-ssrA involves extraction of the C-terminal β strand. The resulting 10 -stranded intermediate is populated at low ATP concentrations, which stall ClpXP unfolding, and at high ATP concentrations, which support robust degradation. To determine if stable unfolding intermediates cause low-ATP stalling, we designed and characterized circularly permuted GFP variants. Notably, stalling was observed for a variant that formed a stable 10 -stranded intermediate but not for one in which this intermediate was unstable. A stepwise degradation model in which the rates of terminal-strand extraction, strand refolding or recapture, and unfolding of the 10 -stranded intermediate all depend on the rate of ATP hydrolysis by ClpXP accounts for the observed changes in degradation kinetics over {{a broad range of}} ATP concentrations. Our results suggest that {{the presence or absence of}} unfolding intermediates will play important roles in determining whether forced enzymatic unfolding requires a minimum rate of ATP hydrolysis.

5|$|A further {{report in}} 1945, {{supporting}} the same conclusion, was produced and stifled. In 1943, two U.S. POWs—Lt. Col. Donald B. Stewart and Col. John H. Van Vliet—had {{been taken by}} Germans to Katyn for an international news conference. Documents released by the National Archives and Records Administration in September 2012 revealed that Steward and Van Vliet sent coded messages to their American superiors indicating that they saw proof that implicated the Soviets. Three lines of evidence were cited. Firstly, the Polish corpses were in such an advanced state of decay that the Nazis could not have killed the Poles, as they had only taken over the area in 1941. Secondly, none of the numerous Polish artifacts, such as letters, diaries, photographs and identification <b>tags</b> <b>pulled</b> from the graves, were dated later than the spring of 1940. Most incriminating was the relatively good state of the men's uniforms and boots, which showed {{that they had not}} lived long after being captured. Later, in 1945, Van Vliet submitted a report concluding that the Soviets were responsible for the massacre. His superior, Major General Clayton Lawrence Bissell, General George Marshall's assistant chief of staff for intelligence, destroyed the report. Washington kept the information secret, presumably to appease Stalin and not distract from the war against the Nazis. During the 1951–52 Congressional investigation into Katyn, Bissell defended his action before the United States Congress, arguing that it was not in the U.S. interest to antagonize an ally (the USSR) whose assistance was still needed against the Empire of Japan. In 1950 Van Vliet recreated his wartime report.|$|R
