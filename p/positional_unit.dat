The purpose of this thesis is to investigate the levels of interdependency (simultaneity) between the performances of two direct opponents in professional football. More specifically, interdependency between performances is investigated at three different levels. Firstly, empirical analyses are conducted {{in order to assess}} the levels of interdependency between the performances of two teams in direct competition using team-game observations. Secondly, data on team formations and player starting positions within these formations is utilised in order to uniquely match individual players to a sole opponent on the field of play. Further empirical analyses are then conducted in order to investigate the levels of interdependency at this more isolated individual player level using player-game observations. Finally, an empirical investigation into the levels of interdependency between the performances of a <b>positional</b> <b>unit</b> (defence or attack) and their opposing team (as a collective) is conducted using positional unit-game observations. An exclusive and detailed data set ranging from the 2007 - 08 season to the 2010 - 11 season is utilised in order to estimate several production functions for teams, individual players and positional units competing in the German Bundesliga. The results in all empirical analyses confirm that the performance of the opponent is significant. At a team and <b>positional</b> <b>unit</b> level, no evidence is found to suggest that the performances of two direct opponents(s) are interdependent, however the results reveal that the recent past performances of the opponent(s) have a significant linear impact upon the performance of the subject. In particular, relative team form going in to a match is revealed to have a significant impact upon the performance of their opponent. At an individual player level, evidence is found to confirm that the performances of players in direct competition are interdependent thus supporting the sports economics theory of joint production. Specifically, the results reveal that the performances of defenders have a significant and negative impact upon the performances of their opposing attackers...|$|E
40|$|Individual {{player and}} <b>positional</b> <b>unit</b> {{tactical}} behaviours were assessed and compared to team strategy within a professional soccer team. Twenty-two matches were sampled from the 2003 – 04 domestic {{season of the}} British Nationwide League team and notated post-event. Tactical behaviours were measured {{through a combination of}} technical and spatial indicators relating to the performance of on the ball behaviours. Chi-square analyses highlighted distinct individual and unit tactical behaviours indicative of role-specific responsibilities. Qualitative and quantitative assessment of overall team strategy indicated an attacking bias through {{the right side of the}} pitch and a corresponding defensive weakness on the left. Similarities were also observed between the tactical behaviours of individuals, their respective units and team strategy. The findings of the present study provide detailed information regarding the measurement of tactical behaviour in soccer and supply a methodology for researchers to consider more accurately the contribution of individuals and their respective units to team performance. They also suggest the demands on soccer players are multi-levelled and may lead to conflicting individual and positional roles...|$|E
50|$|The {{relationship}} between the limitanei, of the border armies, and the pseudocomitatenses, the lowest-ranking units of the field armies, remains unclear. Theodor Mommsen proposed that the pseudocomitatenses were former units of limitanei incorporated into the mobile field armies, and most authors since have followed his theory. E.C. Nischer proposed the alternate theory that the pseudocomitatenses were <b>positional</b> garrison <b>units</b> which were independent of the border armies and thus placed under the same command as the field armies.|$|R

Vol. 7, No. 2, pp. 341 - 355, 2012. The purpose of the investigation was to {{develop an understanding of}} how the performance of a soccer team is affected when playing against different standards of opponents in the English Premier League. Twenty-nine Premier League matches were analysed during the 2010 - 2011 season for 18 selected performance indicators. Standards of opposing teams were defined as being top, middle or bottom depending on their final league position. The participating team was categorised in the 'middle' category and eighteen players from the squad were selected {{to take part in the}} study. Comparisons (mean±SD) were made between the team's performances on selected performance indicators against teams ranked as top, middle and bottom. A one-way ANOVA analysed the team's performance behaviour along with: five <b>positional</b> <b>units</b> (centre-back, full-back, centre midfield, wide midfield, centre forward); and individual player performance behaviour. At team level, successful passes (p= 0. 047) were significantly higher against middle (84. 2 %) compared with top (83. 8 %) and bottom standard teams (83. 3 %). Interceptions (p= 0. 016) were also significantly higher against middle (11. 2 ± 8. 3) when compared with playing against top standard teams (8. 4 + 5. 2) ...|$|R
40|$|We {{discuss the}} main {{concepts}} of circuit solutions for positional data representation and propose appropriate mathematical models. The basic features of positional information model {{formation in the}} displays with different (linear and array) types of element connection are analyzed. The mathematical models of digital circuits and their realizations for positional indication on different types of LED bar graph arrays are presented. An optimized analytical model and applicable logic structure for display with series connection of LED scale elements are proposed. The minimized circuit solutions for the reliable <b>positional</b> display <b>units</b> with different electric design of information area are offered...|$|R

Standards of opposing teams were defined as being top, middle or bottom depending on their final league position. The participating team was categorised in the ‘middle’ category and eighteen players from the squad were selected {{to take part in the}} study. Comparisons (mean±SD) were made between the team’s performances on selected performance indicators against teams ranked as top, middle and bottom. A one-way ANOVA analysed the team’s performance behaviour along with: five <b>positional</b> <b>units</b> (centre-back, full-back, centre midfield, wide midfield, centre forward); and individual player performance behaviour. At team level, successful passes (ρ= 0. 047) were significantly higher against middle (84. 2 %) compared with top (83. 8 %) and bottom standard teams (83. 3 %). Interceptions (ρ= 0. 016) were also significantly higher against middle (11. 2 ± 8. 3) when compared with playing against top standard teams (8. 4 ± 5. 2). The findings suggested the team generally performed better against middle than top or bottom standard opponents. Possessi[URL] was highlighted as a key factor influencing the performance at team level, although no account for game state was considered. The findings suggest that differences in individual player performance are not always evident at team or unit level which previous research has failed to address. The current study has shown that player, unit and team performance changes as a function of opposition standard but must be considered in the future in relation to game state...|$|R
30|$|In {{seeking a}} {{practical}} method for estimating magnetic storm induction of electric {{fields in the}} lithosphere beneath a single ground-based observatory, it is natural to consider an idealized model having Cartesian geometry, where a <b>unit</b> <b>positional</b> vector is given by x̂ = (x̂, ŷ, ẑ). The Earth’s surface {{is represented by the}} plane z= 0; the electrically conducting lithosphere, possibly with regional-scale three-dimensional structure, is assumed to occupy the region (z> 0); everything above the Earth’s surface (z< 0) is assumed to be an insulator.|$|R
40|$|International audienceThere {{is growing}} {{evidence}} that, {{faced with a}} complex environment, participants subdivide the incoming information into small perceptual units, called chunks. Although statistical properties {{have been identified as}} playing a key role in chunking, we wanted to determine whether perceptual (repetitions) and <b>positional</b> (initial <b>units)</b> features might provide immediate guidance for the parsing of information into chunks. Children aged 5 and 8 years were exposed to sequences of 3, 4, or 5 colours. Sequence learning was assessed either through an explicit generation test (Experiment 1) or through a recognition test (Experiment 2). Experiment 1 showed that perceptual and positional saliencies benefited learning and that sensitivity to repetitions was age dependent and permitted the formation of longer chunks (trigrams) in the oldest children. Experiment 2 suggested that children became sensitive to perceptual and positional saliencies regardless of age and that the both types of saliencies supported the formation of longer chunks in the oldest children. The discussion focuses on the multiple factors intervening in sequence learning and their differential effects {{as a function of the}} instructions used at test to assess sequence learning...|$|R
40|$|The spoken {{language}} production of eight Afrikaans speaking Coloured persons with {{mild to moderate}} aphasia and eight Afrikaans speaking Coloured persons without aphasia were explored using a narrative discourse analysis procedure. The aim {{of the study was}} to investigate the discourse characteristics of the Cape Afrikaans dialect in persons with and without mild to moderate aphasia. Furthermore the study aimed to establish the cultural appropriateness as well as the clinical applicability of the newly developed Discourse Test Battery (Ulatowska et al., 1998) for the Afrikaans speaking Coloured population. In addition the adaptation features as well as the dialectal and discourse ethnic markers features were identified. The narrative Discourse Test Battery devised by Ulatowska et al., (1998) consisting of two composite pictures, a picture sequence story, a story retell and personal experience task was administered to all subjects. For the purpose of investigating the higher cognitive and linguistic processes, the formulation of main ideas, providing the lessons for the stories as well as proverb interpretation tasks were included and analysed. The narrative discourse productions were transcribed and analysed using more stringent reliability measures. Measures of reliability were obtained by calculating inter-rater and intra-rater reliability measures. The data was analysed in terms of the length of narratives, pr 6 <b>positional</b> <b>units,</b> quality analysis, analysis of evaluation analysis of dialectal features and ethnic discourse markers as well as adaptation features. The results indicated that for all of these methods of assessment the experimental group performed poorer than the control group. Statistically significant differences were noted on the measures of expressive phonology, lexical items, global structure, suspense, clarity and temporal sequence of some of the narrative tasks. One of the most important clinical as well as theoretical findings was the overlap between some of the dialectal features, general discourse features as well as adaptation features. Analysis of the task effects indicated that the picture sequence and the personal experience narratives showed the greatest differences between the groups and revealed the most information with regard to dialectal features, discourse ethnic markers and adaptation features. The spontaneous proverb and multiple choice proverb interpretation tasks revealed greater difficulties in abstracting and generalising information for the experimental group than for the control group. The assessment tool was found to be culturally appropriate for the Afrikaans speaking Coloured population of the Western Cape...|$|R
40|$|A key {{function}} in tactical intelligence, {{is the ability}} to recognise patterns of behaviour in opposing force activities. Deployment templates are patterns that define the spatial layout opposing force units are known to employ, when carrying out a range of different operations. The early detection of these patterns, provide key indicators to intelligence analysts, for predicting future opposing force activities. In this paper, we investigate the use of neural networks to automatically detect deployment templates, when given full or partial opposing <b>unit</b> <b>positional</b> information. The spatial template recognition problem is a subset of many spatial pattern recognition problems found throughout defence, and the demonstrated success of this approach, could have important military implications beyond this particular application.

40|$|The {{computer}} graphics system performance is increasing {{faster than any}} other computing application. Algorithms for line clipping against convex polygons and lines have been studied {{for a long time}} and many research papers have been published so far. In spite of the latest graphical hardware development and significant increase of performance the clipping is still a bottleneck of any graphical system. So its implementation in hardware is essential for real time applications. In this paper clipping operation is discussed and a hardware implementation of the line clipping algorithm is presented and finally formulated and tested using Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGA). The designed hardware unit consists of two parts : the first is <b>positional</b> code generator <b>unit</b> and the second is the clipping unit. Finally it is worth mentioning that the  designed unit is capable of clipping (232524) line segments per second.         </p...|$|R
40|$|International audienceWe {{would like}} to propose {{a new model of}} meaning {{construction}} based on language comprehension considered as a dynamic process during which the meaning of each linguistic unit and the global meaning of the sentence are determined simultaneously. This model, which may be called "gestalt compositionality," is radically opposed to the classic compositional mechanism advocated by linguistic formalism based on the primacy of syntax. The process considers the syntactic structure of an utterance as the product of meaning construction rather than its source. The comprehension of an utterance is consequently directly based on the interaction between the different basic components of this utterance: lexical <b>units,</b> grammatical markers, <b>positional</b> relations between <b>units,</b> and more generally, basic "constructions" in the sense of Construction Grammar. Thus, meaning is really the result of a gestalt compositional process insomuch as the contribution of each basic component depends on the contribution of the other components present in the utterance. We show a first attempt at modeling from French and English examples...|$|R
