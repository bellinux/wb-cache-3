According to the police the suspects had confessed to the assassination and claimed it was as result of Thangathurai's co-operation with the Sri Lankan government. In October 1999 seven people - Sivaprakasam Akilarupan alias Ahilson, Navaneethan Jeevakumar alias Jeyanth, Muttiah Koneswaran alias Babu, Manikkam Murugathasan alias Jerome, Satkunanathan Nijanthan alias Nijan, Ratnam Yogambal and Karthigesu Yogaranee - were charged {{with the murder of}} Thangathurai and six others. According to the lawyers for some of the suspects, they had been tortured by the police.|$|R
40|$|Everyday {{millions}} of containers circle {{the globe and}} 250, 000, 000 container movements are per-formed around the globe yearly through 220 ports. Approximately 2 % of in-transit containers are physically inspected, while empty containers are rarely inspected. A serious container event could trigger a worldwide massive <b>port</b> shutdown. Government <b>security</b> officials recognize con-tainer shipments {{as one of the}} world’s greatest security threats which press for dramatic im-provements in air and maritime <b>security.</b> <b>Port</b> <b>Authorities</b> are striving to increase efficiency through effective supply chain management, while focus is being placed on control, visibility and security. This paper is based mostly on the possible implementation of an RFID (Radio Frequency Identification) based container tracking system for Port Louis harbor. RFID will enable the identification of containers over long dis-tances and in demanding environments such as the port area. This will help in real-time identifi-cation and tracking of containers, reaching new levels of traceability and control. Companies will know at any point in time, where their assets are and all movements at key loca-tions will be recorded for eventual streamlining and optimizations. These will lead to a reduce...|$|R

40|$|The {{research}} employs {{an adaptive}} cross-disciplinary research strategy {{in an industrial}} example to address port facilities’ inability to assess whether their security systems are efficient. The research combines a twin-pronged approach of first, adapting Markowitz (1952) theory of portfolio selection {{from the field of}} finance to maritime <b>port</b> <b>security</b> to examine each <b>port</b> facility’s <b>security</b> systems as a portfolio; and secondly, through portfolio optimization to construct the optimum theoretical portfolio of security systems drawn from a number of different port facilities owned by Dubai Ports World. The research builds on the existing literature and proposes new definitions of <b>security,</b> <b>port</b> <b>security,</b> <b>port</b> <b>security</b> risk and <b>port</b> <b>security</b> risk management. The research also develops a model of <b>port</b> <b>security</b> risk based on Willis et al’s (2005) definition of terrorist risk. Furthermore, the research builds on the work of Gleason (1980) and examines terrorist attacks on ports and on shipping in ports between 1968 and 2007 and shows, using the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test, that they follow a Poisson distribution. The contribution which the research makes is in terms of adapting Markowitz (1952) theory to the <b>port</b> <b>security</b> environment; and the modelling and measurement {{of the impact of the}} introduction of new <b>port</b> <b>security</b> technology, changes in background <b>port</b> <b>security</b> threat levels and for the planning of <b>port</b> <b>security</b> in Greenfield sites. Furthermore, the adaptive approach of the research is generalisable to all nodes in the supply chain and is not limited to port facilities alone...|$|R
