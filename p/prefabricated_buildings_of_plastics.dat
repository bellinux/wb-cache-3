40|$|Industrialised and {{developing}} countries face an urgent challenge to decouple economic growth and greenhouse gas emissions. The {{aim of this study}} is to investigate where the largest potentials are to the Swedish industry decrease greenhouse gas emissions without increasing their costs. To limit the scope of the study is made by assessing the 10 largest categories of production by value sold in Sweden. The objectives are to investigate: (a) which the 10 largest categories are; (b) how much the productions of the products in the categories emit and where in the production those emissions come from; and (c) if policies or other actions can help lowering the amount emitted. For (a) statistics from Eurostat is used, for (b) an EIO-LCA database is used for most cases, but forestry is done with the help of a report on Swedish forestry emissions, while (c) is done by a literature review regarding the industries included in the study. The top 10 categories by value sold is: (1) Vehicle compression-ignition internal combustion piston engines; (2) Chemical wood pulp, soda or sulphate, other than dissolving grades; (3) Coniferous wood; (4) Pine wood; (5) Parts and accessories of bodies; (6) Bodies for motor vehicles including completely equipped and incomplete bodies; (7) Drive-axles with differential, non-driving axles and their parts; (8) Spruce wood and fir wood; (9) <b>Prefabricated</b> <b>buildings</b> <b>of</b> wood; And (10) Other parts and accessories for vehicles. Results show that chemical wood pulp had the largest emissions both per value produced and total. Additionally, chemical wood pulp is the category where the most clear cut improvements can be done. Besides, it is found that improvement possibilities exist for forestry and motor vehicle parts production, while <b>prefabricated</b> <b>buildings</b> <b>of</b> wood are very sustainable compared to other building methods. Suggestions are also made for policies that could decrease greenhouse gas emissions from chemical wood pulp and forestry. A suggestion for further investigation is to assess whether those would be better than improving existing broad policies in Sweden. ...|$|R
40|$|One {{thousand}} <b>prefabricated</b> <b>buildings</b> were imported in {{a systematic}} manner by the New Zealand Government from Europe and erected in the Titahi Bay area of Wellington and the Tamaki area of Auckland NZ. These kitset buildings, manufactured in both England and Austria, were shipped to NZ and put together on site in New Zealand by immigrant tradesmen especially selected in {{their country of origin}} for the task. The importation, carried out between 1953 and 1956, remains to this day the largest state sponsored importation <b>of</b> <b>prefabricated</b> <b>buildings.</b> <b>Of</b> all the issues facing the project, the decision to use imported timbers proved to be among the most contentious, striking at the heart of NZ perception of itself as a nation of timber builders. This paper will explore the background to the timber controversy, including the resource availability issues associated with native and exotic species that led to the initial decision. It will also discuss apprehensions within the NZ Forest Service to the importation, quality control issues associated with securing timber quality within Austria and in NZ, and give reasons for the hypothesis that the political issues surrounding the use of imported timber, were instrumental in limiting the long term acceptance of this unique State sponsored building project as a template for future housing procurement...|$|R

40|$|The major {{territory}} of Siberia {{is occupied by}} underexplored, hardly accessible areas having unstable or frozen soils. Development of these territories is hampered {{for a number of}} reasons, including poor weather and soil conditions, lack of infrastructure, roads, networks, and remoteness from industrial enterprises. Traditional building methods are rather expensive. The latter circumstance calls for new types of residential and public buildings, with the main requirement being their transportability (by air and land transport), higher degree of prefabrication (including foundations), light weight of structures, fast assembly, possibility of assembly and installation of large components without the use of heavy machinery, application of local materials, structural reliability, especially in the conditions of unstable soils. Construction operations on permafrost soils are not to alter the soil properties. The proposed structure <b>of</b> low-rise <b>buildings</b> is aimed at the attainment of the followings objectives: assimilation of hardly accessible areas of Siberia, development of low-rise housing, and secondary use of veneer waste products. A <b>prefabricated</b> <b>building</b> <b>of</b> the closed type consists of a foundation plate, as well as walls and coverings arranged {{in the form of a}} spatial framework united into a single manifold system. Beam elements <b>of</b> a <b>prefabricated</b> <b>building</b> are to be made of timber-based materials and assembled into a single bolted mountable and dismountable structure by means of a system of shaped metal node elements. Advantages <b>of</b> new low-rise <b>buildings</b> include their higher transportability due to the compactness of individual items and reduction of the overall weight, smaller construction term; increase in the building reliability on weak, unstable and frozen soils; expansion of the area of architectural design; development of a new method of recycling of large-size veneer waste products. The above features can make the new type <b>of</b> low-rise <b>buildings</b> highly competitive.

40|$|Planning {{installations}} {{is becoming}} an increasing problem in construction, {{because the number of}} devices for technical supply is constantly increasing with continual progress in science and technology. Since the installations <b>of</b> the <b>building</b> can not be viewed unrelated of the construction, problem of its planning is more complicated in <b>prefabricated</b> <b>buildings</b> because the elements of construction are prefabricated. Planning was formerly performed by embedding the installation in prefabricated elements. This method had a lot of flaws, and modern approach tends setting installation out of prefabricated elements except when the traditional approach proves as economical. Although the hot water heating with radiators is the most practical way <b>of</b> heating in <b>prefabricated</b> <b>buildings,</b> the under floor heating systems have greater and greater use. Today, prefabricated sanitary cabins have a huge use and they are much more economical in comparison to special panels for bathrooms that were once create. Approaches in terms of planning electrical installation are different, but for conventional constructed buildings, as well as <b>prefabricated</b> <b>buildings,</b> the use <b>of</b> lightweight prefabricated walls with embedded installations, today is recommended, when the room is loaded with a large number of this installations and if it is possible...|$|R
