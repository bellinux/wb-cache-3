40|$|The harsh {{environment}} of the arctic requires specialized safety solutions. One main safety issue in the arctic {{is the need for}} more enclosed modules. Enclosed modules are used for two reasons; to prevent ice and snow to expose the process equipment; and to prevent the cold climate to impose an unduly harsh working environment for operators. The enclosed mechanically ventilated <b>process</b> <b>modules</b> are different from the open naturally ventilated <b>process</b> <b>modules</b> that are normally used in offshore facilities. The explosion safety performance of the non-standard mechanically ventilated <b>process</b> <b>modules</b> has therefore been studied in detail through an extensive program of CFD simulations. It is seen that mechanically ventilated modules has explosion risk drivers that are distinctly different from risk drivers in naturally ventilated modules. It is seen that the ignition source isolation efficiency is significantly more important for confined modules than for standard naturally ventilated modules. The explosion design loads are therefore strongly depending on the ignition source isolation efficiency. Isolation control, {{and its impact on the}} explosion design loads, is discussed in this paper. The presented conclusions are of high importance in future developments in arctic climate...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} novel and {{innovative}} scheme for 10 Gb/s parallel Very Short Reach (VSR) optical communication system. The optimized scheme properly manages the SDH/SONET redundant bytes and adjusts {{the position of}} error detecting bytes and error correction bytes. Compared with the OIF-VSR 4 - 01. 0 proposal, the scheme has a coding <b>process</b> <b>module.</b> The SDH/SONET frames in transmission direction are disposed as follows: (1) The Framer-Serdes Interface (FSI) gets 16 x 622. 08 Mb/s STM- 64 frame. (2) The STM- 64 frame is byte-wise stripped across 12 channels, all channels are data channels. During this process, the parity bytes and CRC bytes are generated in the similar way as OIF-VSR 4 - 01. 0 and stored in the code <b>process</b> <b>module.</b> (3) The code <b>process</b> <b>module</b> will regularly convey the additional parity bytes and CRC bytes to all 12 data channels. (4) After the 8 B/ 10 B coding, the 12 channels is transmitted to the parallel VCSEL array. The receive process approximately in reverse order of transmission process. By applying this scheme to 10 Gb/s VSR system, the frame size in VSR system is reduced from 15552 x 12 bytes to 14040 x 12 bytes, the system redundancy is reduced obviously.

40|$|Economic {{models of}} quality {{assurance}} {{can be an}} important tool for decision makers in software development projects. They enable to base quality assurance planning on economical factors of the product and the used defect-detection techniques. A variety of such models has been proposed but many are too abstract to be used in practice. Furthermore, even the more concrete models lack an integration with existing software development process models to increase their applicability. This paper describes an integration of a thorough stochastic model of the economics of analytical quality assurance with the systems development process model V-Modell XT.

40|$|The {{potential}} of modular micro-assembly systems can often {{not be fully}} exploited by small companies, as commercial availability of process modules is limited and the development and maintenance of a pool of process modules is too elaborate. To overcome this problem, an open <b>process</b> <b>module</b> interface specification is proposed, which allows integration of process modules into different systems (cross-platform integration). Based on the specification, a <b>process</b> <b>module</b> construction kit is presented, which shall reduce the development effort of process modules.
