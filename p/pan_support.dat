40|$|This {{paper is}} {{concerned}} with the self-assembly of polyelectrolyte multilayer membranes (PEMMs) by using dynamic layer-by-layer (LBL) adsorption technique for pervaporation separation of water/alcohol mixtures. The polyacrylonitrile (PAN) ultrafiltration membrane used as a support was firstly hydrolyzed with alkaline solutions followed by alternatively depositing polyethylenei mine (PEI) and polyacrylic acid (PAA) under a pressure of 0. 1 MPa. The PEI-ethanol solution and PEI-aqueous solution were used to investigate the effects of solvents on the assembly process. It was found that both separation factor and permeate flux were improved remarkably by replacing PEI aqueous solution with PEI-ethanol solution. Because only a few composite bilayers were needed to achieve a good capability in the dynamic LBL process, the hydrolysis degrees of <b>PAN</b> <b>support</b> membrane would strongly affect the pervaporation membrane performances. It was also noted that the exposure of membranes to low pH after hydrolysis would not benefit for the assembly. Further studies were conducted to investigate the effects of alkali species on the PAN hydrolysis and pervaporation performances of PEMMs. The contribution of alkali species on the pervaporation performance was in the order of KOH > NaOH > LiOH. Finally, the performances of PEI/PAA multilayer membranes assembled on the hydrolyzed <b>PAN</b> <b>support</b> were evaluated with a relatively wide range of feed temperature and concentration. The PEMMs obtained with only 2. 5 bilayers had a separation factor of 604 and a permeate flux of 314 g/m(2) h (70 degrees C) for pervaporation of 95 wt% ethanol-water mixture. (c) 2007 Elsevier B. V.

However, LbL process is also recognized as a time-consuming process, especially for assembly of dense membranes. In this paper, a one-step dynamic assembly based on electrostatic adsorption was developed to prepare the PE complex membranes. The chitosan (CS), used as a model polycation, was dynamically deposited on a hydrolyzed polyacrylonitrile (<b>PAN)</b> <b>support</b> membrane with negative charges under a selected pressure to form a PE complex membrane for pervaporation separation of water-ethanol mixture. Compared with traditional dip-coating method, this new assembly process could offer some advantages such as the formation of selective layer with dilute solution, easily used for different membrane module types and suitable for large scale applications. The assembly conditions such as dynamic pressure, CS molecular weight, and CS concentration were investigated. The appropriate conditions for assembly were: dynamic pressure. 0. 2 MPa; CS molecular weight, 82, 000; and CS concentration, 0. 5 wt. %. In the case of pervaporation of 95 wt. % ethanol/water mixtures, the separation factor and the permeate flux of the CS polyelectrolyte complex membranes were 422 and 230 g/(m(2) h) (60 degrees C), respectively. The cross-linking treatment with glutaraldehyde and sulfuric acid were subsequently performed. It was found that the separation performance was improved by the cross-linking treatment. Finally, inner skin hollow fiber PE complex membranes were also successfully explored using one-step dynamic assembly for pervaporation dehydration.

A series of PS- b -PNIPAM- b -PS triblock copolymers were synthesized using reversible addition-fragmentation chain transfer (RAFT) polymerization. The hydrophobic PS end blocks were selected to form the minority component, whereas the temperature-responsive PNIPAM midblock accounted for the majority component. The self-assembly and phase behavior in bulk of PS- b -PNIPAM- b -PS as well as selected blends with low molecular weight PNIPAM homopolymers were studied using transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Classical lamellar, cylindrical, spherical, and bicontinuous double gyroid morphologies were observed in the dried state. In aqueous solutions, the glassy PS domains act as physical cross-links, and hydrogels were therefore formed. The bulk block copolymer morphology had a strong effect {{on the degree of}} swelling in aqueous solutions upon cooling below the coil-globule transition temperature of the PNIPAM midblock. Bulk compositions with spherical PS domains and PNIPAM continuous phase swelled in water up to 58 times by weight, whereas composition having cylindrical PS domains or bicontinous gyroid structure in bulk swelled 20 or 10 times by weight, respectively. Finally, lamellar compositions did not show any swelling.

We report here the first mixed matrix composite membrane made of commercially available poly (amide-b-ethylene oxide) (Pebax® 1657, Arkema) mixed with the nano-sized zeolitic imidazole framework ZIF- 7. This hybrid material has been successfully deposited as a thin layer (less than 1 μm) on a porous polyacrylonitrile (<b>PAN)</b> <b>support.</b> An intermediate gutter layer of PTMSP was applied {{to serve as a}} flat and smooth surface for coating to avoid polymer penetration into the porous support. Key features of this work are the preparation and use of ultra-small ZIF- 7 nano-particles (around 30 - 35 nm) and the membrane processability of Pebax® 1657. SEM pictures show that excellent adhesion and almost ideal morphology between the two phases has been obtained simply by mixing the as-synthesized ZIF- 7 suspension into the Pebax® 1657 dope, and no voids or clusters can be observed. The performance of the composite membrane is characterized by single gas permeation measurement of CO 2, N 2 and CH 4. Both, permeability (PCO 2 up to 145 barrer) and gas selectivity (CO 2 /N 2 up to 97 and CO 2 /CH 4 up to 30) can be increased at low ZIF- loading. The CO 2 /CH 4 selectivity can be further increased to 44 with the filler loading of 34 wt%, but the permeability is reduced compared to the pure Pebax® 1657 membrane. Polymer chain rigidification at high filler loading {{is supposed to be a}} reason for the reduced permeability. The composite membranes prepared in this work show better performance in terms of permeance and selectivity when compared with asymmetric mixed matrix membranes described in the recent literature.

Yet, despite this, very little value adding of minerals exists. Most of the mined minerals are exported, where it is reworked into valued items. The country subsequently imports the valuable items at a much higher cost. In the 2006 / 7 financial year, the government made the decision to support several projects aimed at adding value to the mined minerals and by so doing, creating job opportunities. One such project was identified for the mineral Fluorite (CaF 2). Fluorite is exposed to a controlled burn in a plasma reactor, producing an array of different fluorocarbon gases used in the electronics industry and for commercial polymers like Teflon®. Currently, fluorocarbon gases are separated using a series of cryogenic distillation columns. Although this technique has proven to be successful, it has several negative aspects such as the high cost involved when operating at cryogenic conditions as well as difficulty handling the gases at these sub–zero temperatures. It was proposed to study the possibility of using membranes to separate fluorocarbon gases at ambient conditions. Several membranes were screened to determine which one is best suited for this application. Two Teflon® based membranes were selected from this data. One of the membranes had a <b>PAN</b> <b>support,</b> while the other had a PEI support. Pure gas data for both membranes showed promising results. It yielded the highest flux for C 3 F 6, followed by N 2 and CF 4. c–C 4 F 8 was not used because it was demonstrated that the gas tends to condensate at low pressures. It is recommended to rather use pressure swing condensation to remove this gas from the mixture before the remainder is purified using membranes. Both membranes behaved similarly, with selectivity between C 3 F 6 and CF 4, and N 2 and CF 4; all above 10. By including the permeate pressure in the Solution–diffusion model, it was possible to model the pure gas data Binary feed gas mixture experiments showed a large amount of coupling existing between the feed gas mixtures. The result is a decrease in the selectivity as well as the total flux of the gas mixture. Partial fluxes were modelled by introducing a thermodynamic factor that was shown to follow a power law equation. The PAN–supported membrane outperformed the PEI–supported one; it was decided to use this membrane from this point onwards. Analysis of the ternary feed mixtures showed a strong selectivity towards the gas abundant in the feed blend. The existence of convective diffusion was proven, and included in the modelling, as well as a breakthrough pressure constant. This is indicative of strong interaction between the different gases and the membrane. Throughout the study {{it became clear that the}} difference in surface charge between the gases and the membrane were decisive. Opposite charges between a gas (C 3 F 6) and the membrane aided in gas permeation. Membrane separation of fluorocarbon gases at ambient conditions is possible. Teflon® based membranes are recommended. It will be advantageous to study the effect of elevated temperatures on the separation efficiency of such a system. Master...|$|E
40|$|Introduction: Different {{models of}} {{tractors}} have been imported from foreign countries or assembled in Iran for many years. Consistency of foreign manufactured products with native specifications and {{the improvement of}} locally manufactured tractors are important problems that must be considered. Moreover, tractor dimensions, sitting space and some other important {{factors such as the}} ability of Iranian users to operate them must be taken into consideration. In this study, we surveyed the proper proportion of tractors dimension, location of control tools and driver’s work space, with Iranian users’ anthropometric data of drivers from five provinces. Human factors are of paramount importance in developing farm machinery given that these machines will often be operated by persons with minimum skills. Therefore, farm machinery should be made simple to operate and as free from hazards as possible. Materials and methods: Firstly, the anthropometric data for 250 users 20 - 60 years old was calculated. The drivers were selected randomly. Then the specifications of 4 tractors including: Ferguson 285, Ferguson 399, Valtra and New Holland were compared with the anthropometric data of user in 5 th and 95 th percentile value and their adaptation was studied. Anthropometric Data of subjects consisted of: standing height, full hand length, popliteal length, seat pan width, seat pan depth, elbow height, seat back support height, hand pan width, hand grip and full-leg length. Getting on the tractor is the first contact of an operator with a tractor. In assessing the suitability of the provision made for getting on the tractor, an experiment was arranged in which operators tried to get on 3 tractors. The mode of getting on the tractors, the agony on the operator’s face, the muscular reactions and individual opinion on the difficulties or comfort while undertaking the task were observed and recorded. The specifications of tractors compared with Anthropometric Data were measured, whiles the tractors were positioned on a level ground for measurements after the tires had been ganged. These specifications were tractor height, steering wheel height, footrest height, foot set height; tractor seat geometry as seat pan width, seat pan depth and seat <b>pan</b> <b>support</b> height; steering geometry as distance of steering wheel from seat reference point, steering wheel radius, steering wheel thickness, steering wheel inclination to the horizontal and seat reach adjustment; levers and pedals distance from seat reference point as gear lever, parking brake lever, hydraulic control lever, clutch pedal, accelerator pedal, brake pedal, front panel, workspace width and workspace length. Results and Discussion: The experiment that was conducted with operators attempting to get on the tractors indicated that tractor steps heights were higher than the desirable limit. Therefore, based on the ideas of the researcher and tractors drivers, getting on all tractors is difficult. With {{an increase in the number}} of steps or a decrease in their heights, the desirable condition can be created. Seat depth of new Holland and Valtra tractors were great for drivers in the 5 th percentile value. A variable thickness pad can solve this problem. Results of studies indicated that Seat depth of Massey Ferguson 285 and 399 was shorter than driver’s leg length of 95 th percentile value. To solve the problem an increase of 10 centimeters to pad height of these tractors was suggested. Seat pad of tractors were short for drivers in the 95 th percentile value. Distance of steering wheel from seat reference point (SRP) in Massey Ferguson 285 and Valtra was further than drivers hand length in the 5 th percentile value. Therefore, the drivers hand is short for driver’s good operation. Surveys indicated that drivers had problems for gear lever access in Massey Ferguson 399. Therefore, for good access on gear lever we must increase seat stroke range by 5 - 10 centimeters. The record available from Meteorological Organization indicated that air temperature and rain throughout the year in the study area is between 20 to 40 degrees Celsius and 100 to 300 mm change. Valtra and New Holland tractors having a driver cabs with heating and cooling equipment have the ideal space for the performance of their driver. Massey Ferguson 285 tractor does not have any driver cab and Roll Over Protection Structure (ROPS). Conclusions: This research was conducted in five provinces of Iran to assess ergonomics of some commonly and new used tractors in Iran containing Ferguson 285, Ferguson 399, Valtra and New Holland. As there was no data base with required details, data was collected directly by personal contact with tractor users. A questionnaire was filled out for each person and anthropometric data was calculated in all provinces for 250 users 20 - 60 year old that were selected at random. Then relevant specifications of 4 tractors were measured and compared with the relevant anthropometric data of users in the 5 th and 95 th percentile value and their adaptation was studied. The results indicated that tractor steps, Seat depth, distance of steering wheel and distance of some levers and pedals from seat reference point should be amended...|$|E

5|$|In the laboratory, {{platinum}} wire {{is used for}} electrodes; platinum <b>pans</b> and <b>supports</b> are used in thermogravimetric analysis because of the stringent requirements of chemical inertness upon heating to high temperatures (~1000°C). Platinum is used as an alloying agent for various metal products, including fine wires, noncorrosive laboratory containers, medical instruments, dental prostheses, electrical contacts, and thermocouples. Platinum-cobalt, an alloy of roughly three parts platinum and one part cobalt, is used to make relatively strong permanent magnets. Platinum-based anodes are used in ships, pipelines, and steel piers.|$|R
