Essiac was instead marketed by Essiac Products Inc. and others as a dietary supplement, subject to much looser regulation and not required to show any proof of effectiveness.|$|E
50|$|As {{with many}} of the first cases {{reported}} by Dallas, this case involved a dispute over title to land in the Pennsylvania colony. The unnamed plaintiff, a tenant (lessee) of landowner Richardson, and whose right to possession of the leased land depended on Richardson’s good title to the land, thus found himself defending Richardson’s title to the land. The tenant sued Campbell, an opposing claimant to the same real property. The plaintiff offered a patent dated 1762, which granted title in the disputed land to Richardson, or Richardson’s <b>predecessor</b> <b>in</b> <b>title.</b> The defendant Campbell offered receipts showing payments made to the Secretary of the Land Office, one Mr. Peters, several years prior to Richardson’s patent. The plaintiff argued that those payments were for an adjacent tract of land.|$|E

In the early 1990s beyond the technical sciences, economical, medical and social programmes became in demand.

5000|$|The Rent Act 1965 {{introduced}} {{three major}} innovations. Firstly, except for furnished lettings, {{it was the}} first time that a new long-term flexible approach had been brought to the old problem of rent control. It substituted the rent-fixing formula of earlier legislation with independent rent regulation by Rent Officers. This introduced the normal valuation principles into the assessment of a fair rent (section 68 in the Rent Act 1965 and Section 70 in the consolidated Rent Act 1977) by requiring that regard should specifically be had to the age, character, locality and state of repair of the dwelling. Personal circumstances were to be disregarded as were improvements carried out voluntarily by, and any disrepair or defects attributable to, the tenant or a <b>predecessor</b> <b>in</b> <b>title.</b> A most fundamental concept was introduced whereby it had to be assumed that the number of persons seeking to become tenants of similar dwelling houses in the locality on the terms (other than those relating to rent) of the regulated tenancy was not substantially greater than the number of such dwelling-houses in the locality that were available for letting on such terms. This requirement to assume a roughly balanced market was described by commentators as the [...] "scarcity factor", (words that did not appear in the Act). There was an automatic rent review (but only if applied for) at three-yearly intervals (reduced to two-yearly intervals in the 1980 Housing Act).|$|E
5000|$|In Georgia, {{joint tenancy}} is {{commonly}} conveyed in a deed as [...] "Joint Tenants with Rights of Survivorship". The legal {{effect of this}} type of tenancy is a [...] "life estate" [...] with a [...] "contingent remainder". Translated, this means that the interest of each joint tenant can be thought of in two parts: the [...] "present" [...] interest while the parties are both alive and what happens in the [...] "future" [...] when one of the tenants dies. Viewed separately, the interest of each independent co-tenant is only [...] "temporary" [...] interest while they both co-tenants are alive and neither owns a [...] "full" [...] interest. The [...] "full" [...] interest is determined by who outlives the other and vests automatically in the survivor at, and only at, the time of death. In the case of a mortgage executed by only one of the living joint tenants, the mortgage does not sever the tenancy. Instead, the mortgage is interpreted as conveying whatever interest the debtor holds. In this example, that would be the debtor's life (or [...] "temporary") estate only, since both parties are still living, but the lender would also be entitled to the full estate, but only if the debtor were to outlive the other joint-tenant. Consequently, if the debtor dies first, the co-tenant, who is not party to the mortgage, would take full ownership interest of the property free and clear of the mortgage. However, just because a surviving co-tenant isn't liable on the mortgage {{does not mean that the}} mortgage is extinguished or that the property is not subject to foreclosure if the mortgage isn't paid. The Georgia Supreme Court decision of Manders v. King, 284 Ga. 338, 339, 667 S.E.2d 59, 60 (2008) is instructive. [...] "Georgia is one of several states adhering to the common-law doctrine of exoneration, which provides that, unless a will specifically provides otherwise, an heir or devisee of real property may look to the decedent's personal property for satisfaction of liens on devised real property, at the expense of the residuary legatees or distributees of the decedent's personal estate. J. Kraut, Annotation, Right of Heir or Devisee to Have Realty Exonerated from Lien Thereon at Expense of Personal Estate, 4 A.L.R.3d 1023, § 3. See Raines v. Shipley, 197 Ga. 448, 458, 29 S.E.2d 588 (1944) (“Under the general law it was the duty of the executors to discharge this particular mortgage debt devised real property from the personal property of the testatrix, if any she had....”). See also Killingsworth v. First Nat. Bank of Columbus, 237 Ga. 544, 546, 228 S.E.2d 901 (1976) (estate required to exonerate devised real property by paying balance of mortgage liens so long as the liens were debts of the testator and not an assumption of debts of a <b>predecessor</b> <b>in</b> <b>title).</b> Id. In Manders, the Court held “a surviving joint tenant does not qualify for exoneration of a mortgage on joint tenancy property unless there is language in the decedent's will clearly expressing an intention that the mortgage debt be paid.” In re Estate of Young, supra; In re Estate of Dolley, supra, 265 Cal.App.2d at 72.2. In short, if there is a mortgage on a property that was executed by only one joint-tenant and that joint-tenant dies, unless there is a specific provision in the Will of the deceased joint-tenant that estate assets should be used to pay the outstanding mortgage, then surviving joint-tenant is not exonerated from the mortgage and the property is subject to foreclosure if the mortgage goes into default.|$|E

40|$|On January 16, 2014, the Supreme Court of Montana {{reversed}} and remanded {{a district}} court decision that had foreclosed the public’s {{right to access}} the Ruby River. The Court held that {{the right of way}} was a public prescriptive easement, which extended beyond the road surface itself to include such area as necessary for the county to maintain the road {{in the interest of the}} public. Furthermore, the Court concluded that once a public right-of-way is established by prescriptive use, the scope of current and future use of such an easement is not limited to those historic adversarial practices which gave rise to the easement, but rather is subject to uses that are incidental to original uses or “reasonably foreseeable. ” Finally, the Court found the adjacent landowner’s takings claim to be without merit because any compensable interest had been expressly severed by his <b>predecessor</b> <b>in</b> <b>title</b> and the enactment of the state’s Stream Access Law, which encumbered his deed with an inalienable public servitude.
