40|$|This article {{addresses}} the comparative {{advantage of the}} government to the private property/casualty insurance industry for the provision of insurance coverage for catastrophic losses. That the government can play an important role as an insurer of societal losses has been a central <b>public</b> <b>policy</b> <b>principle</b> since at least the New Deal. In addition, our government typically automatically provides forms of specific relief following unusually severe or unexpected disasters, which itself {{can be viewed as a}} form of ex post insurance. This article argues that, for systemic reasons, the government is much less effective than the private property/casualty insurance market in providing coverage of losses generally, but especially of losses in contexts of catastrophes. Key words: government insurance; catastrophe; disaster Virtually all approaches to the problem of catastrophic loss conclude that the magnitude and character of such losses compels some form of governmental solution, whether in the form of ex post disaster assistance or ex ante regulation to reduce exposure to the loss. With respect to disaster assistance, for example, in the U. S., a permanent source of government-provided aid has been in place since the creation of the Federal Emergency Relief Administration during the New Deal, and is frequently supplemented by the Congres...|$|E
40|$|Punitive damages is a {{legal concept}} {{generally}} recognized only in common law countries. These damages are awarded in addition to compensatory damages, and are meant for punishment and deterrence of wrongdoers. While this type of damages can be typically awarded in common law countries, tort law of European civil law countries {{are based on the}} principle of restitution and prohibition of enrichment. This distinction creates a clash between civil law and common law countries. This distinction has raised interpretations also in the field of international commercial arbitration. This thesis is consentrating on the question of how the concept of punitive damages should be treated in international commercial arbitration, which is known of its complexity with regards of choice of law questions and attributes of different legal systems. The first question concerns the powers of arbitrators, more precisely, whether they have the power to award punitive damages. Secondly, if such damages have been awarded, are those awards enforceable in the European civil law countries, which do not recognize such concept. This issue is discussed mainly in relation to <b>public</b> <b>policy</b> <b>principle</b> laid down in the New York Convention as a ground for non-enforcement of arbitral award. Because the United States is the most prominent ground for punitive damages claims, it provides the best and most appropriate starting point for this thesis in relation to measuring powers of arbitral tribunals. Therefore, the analysis is highly based on the case law of the United States. However, also legislation and case law of European countries are discussed. As for the enforceability issue, the legislation and relatively rare case law are analyzed in European countries such as France, Germany and England. This analysis discloses that the principles of party autonomy and pro-arbitration have a great value in international arbitral proceedings expanding the powers of arbitrators to include powers regarding awarding punitive damages. The requirements for awarding punitive damages are quite well settled in the United States because of the substantial amount of case law regarding the issue, but European situation still seems to be more ambiguous. The final outcome depends on the mixture of applicable substantial law and lex arbitri {{as well as on the}} will of the parties. The question of enforceability of punitive damages awards, on the other hand, have proven to be a difficult issue to interpret. While the majority of legal community tend to interpret the ordre public principle narrowly, thus covering only the basic notions of morality and justice, lack of proper case law in Europe regarding the issue turns the unequivocal answer impossible...|$|E

40|$|Abstract- Since {{the end of}} {{the eighties}} the Becker and Murphy model of {{rational}} addiction has been the dominant approach to estimate addiction e ects. The main implication of the model is that <b>public</b> <b>policy,</b> in <b>principle,</b> should not interfere with a fully rational behaviour. However, the additional public health care costs smokers impose on non smokers could be internalised using price mechanisms, as the long run price elasticity of demand is supposed to be, according to this model, significantly higher than the short run one and higher than that obtained from alternative models of addiction, such as the habit persistence model. In this paper we estimate the demand for Tobacco and related products in Italy using PANEL data supplied by ISTAT for the twenty Italian regions. The rational addiction model is used to estimate addiction e ects following the methodological approach suggested by Baltagi and Levin (2001). The myopic addiction model is also estimated as an alternative way of modelling addiction e ects. These data seem to support the rational addiction model, although the results are not clearcut. We have thus estimated the same models using Time Series of per-capita Households Tobacco expenditures from the Italian National Accounts. In this case, the data strongly support the Rational Addiction model and produce elasticities in line with similar case studies...|$|R

The motivation for the work was to enable decision-makers, in a culturally and technologically diverse organisation, to share information {{for the purpose of}} making decisions that are well informed about the risk-related aspects of the situations they seek to address. The research examined the use of decision support system DSS) technology to facilitate decision-making of this type. This involved identifying the technology available and its application to risk management. Decision-making is a complex activity that does not lend itself to exact measurement or precise understanding at a detailed level. In view of this, a prototype DSS was developed through which to understand the practical issues to be accommodated and to evaluate alternative approaches to supporting decision-making of this type. The problem of measuring the effect upon the quality of decisions has been approached through expert evaluation of the software developed. The practical orientation of this work was informed by a review of the relevant literature in decision-making, risk management, decision support and information technology.

40|$|PhD (Public Management and Governance), North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2014 The {{phenomenon}} of the <b>public</b> <b>policy</b> process, which encapsulates the <b>public</b> <b>policy</b> implementation, has been in existence long before the political transformation {{that took place in}} South Africa in 1994. However, the ushering in of the new dispensation saw the integration of the existing <b>public</b> <b>policies.</b> In addition, it inevitably heralded the introduction of the new <b>public</b> <b>policies</b> and national guidelines across all sectors of the South African <b>public</b> institutions. <b>Public</b> <b>policy</b> implementation, as an integral stage of the <b>public</b> <b>policy</b> process, emerged as indispensable towards effective and efficient public service. The basic education, as a public institution, could also not be exempted from such inevitability of heightened <b>public</b> <b>policy</b> implementation. The introduction of the new education related <b>public</b> <b>policies</b> included the developmental appraisal system (DAS), the whole school evaluation (WSE), the integrated quality management systems (IQMS) and the discipline and safety national guidelines (DSNG). This, consequently, bears testament to what became an inevitable transformation process in South African basic education. Using the DAS, the WSE, the IQMS and the DSNG as points of departure and Empangeni education district as a reference area, the focus of this study has been the <b>public</b> <b>policy</b> process, the internal organisational arrangements and structures for <b>public</b> <b>policy</b> implementation, the <b>public</b> <b>policy</b> implementation process together with its inherent challenges and an improved model aimed at alleviating or even eradicating such <b>public</b> <b>policy</b> implementation challenges. The theoretical models, both descriptive and prescriptive, suggest that the <b>public</b> <b>policy</b> process, which entails namely: <b>public</b> <b>policy</b> agenda, <b>public</b> <b>policy</b> formulation, <b>public</b> <b>policy</b> adoption, <b>public</b> <b>policy</b> implementation and <b>public</b> <b>policy</b> evaluation, is premised on the <b>public</b> <b>policy</b> models. Of all the above-listed <b>public</b> <b>policy</b> process stages, <b>public</b> <b>policy</b> implementation stands out as the pinnacle around which the <b>public</b> <b>policy</b> process revolves. The <b>public</b> <b>policy</b> implementation stage, therefore, suggests a point where the influence, the impact and the successes or failures of the <b>public</b> <b>policy</b> process unfold. In light of this inextricable link of the <b>public</b> <b>policy</b> implementation stage to the general <b>public</b> <b>policy</b> process that is influenced by models, the effective <b>public</b> <b>policy</b> implementation is, subsequently, embracive of attributes and lessons derived from the <b>public</b> <b>policy</b> models. Some of these attributes and lessons, inter alia, include; the mutual participation by all actors involved, rather than dominance by an elite group (derived from the elite/mass model), the identification of institutional structures responsible for the <b>public</b> <b>policy</b> implementation (derived from the institutional model) and the accommodation of the implementation review as well as feedback (all indicative of the systems model). The literature review and the empirical data analyses show convergent views that suggest that the effective <b>public</b> <b>policy</b> implementation is directly proportional to the extent of internal organisational arrangements and structures {{as well as to the}} basic functionality of schools as centres for the implementation process. This implies that where internal institutional arrangements and structures are evident and functional, the implementation of <b>public</b> <b>policies</b> is bound to be effective and efficient, while the contrary also holds. Given Empangeni education district being the focal point of the study, it has emerged that the use of personnel from other units and the absence of a district unit designated to solely oversee the coordination, the implementation and the evaluation of the education related <b>public</b> <b>policies,</b> inhibit the potential of adequately achieving the intended objectives of the education related <b>public</b> <b>policies</b> implemented. In case of schools as the institutional centres for <b>public</b> <b>policy</b> implementation, empirical data analyses have established an inter-connection between the <b>public</b> <b>policy</b> implementation and the schools‟ basic functionality. Consequently, it is in functional schools (i. e. schools where the school management teams and school governing bodies are visible, effective and work collaboratively), where <b>public</b> <b>policy</b> implementation thrives and is effective. The contextualisation of the empirical research analyses to the study focus area, Empangeni Education District (EED), established that its current implementation model faces <b>public</b> <b>policy</b> implementation challenges. The most evident challenges, inter alia, include: * the inadequate advocacy of the education related <b>public</b> <b>policies</b> to be implemented; * the two or three days, currently accepted as a capacity building period by those expected to implement education related <b>public</b> <b>policies,</b> are not proportional to the volume of work to be covered and it suggests an inadequate time-frame for capacity development in the EED's current model; * the material and mechanisms used to perform functional work do not accommodate all role-players (also called actors in this study) according to their demographical needs, like language, which renders them inept to perform to their optimum level; * the primary structure of the current EED's <b>public</b> <b>policy</b> implementation model is a top-down directional structure which underscores the top-down cascading model; * current communication technology employed, do not take advantage of the 21 century‟s information computer technology in order to make the work environment more user-friendly, efficient and effective; * the simultaneous implementation of education related <b>public</b> <b>policies</b> poses a challenge to internal organisational arrangements, such as <b>public</b> <b>policy</b> implementation (PPI) structures and personnel, for effective implementation of such policies; and * the evident inadequate continuous and deliberate monitoring of implemented education related <b>public</b> <b>policies.</b> Conclusions and inferences drawn from this study suggest that the EED's current <b>public</b> <b>policy</b> implementation model is inadequate to deal with the identified challenges. Finally, this study proposes a strengthened EED <b>public</b> <b>policy</b> model, which accommodates recommendations to EED's <b>public</b> <b>policy</b> implementation challenges. Inherently, the proposed strengthened <b>public</b> <b>policy</b> implementation model is not limited to dealing with the identified challenges only, but it radically embraces the introduction of systems and internal organisational structures that promote inclusive, collaborative and traceable implementation of education related <b>public</b> <b>policies.</b> Doctora...|$|R
