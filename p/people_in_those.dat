Jesse Walker, writing in Reason.com, criticized the 2016 report, questioning whether the count was reliable, as it focused {{on the number of}} groups rather than the number of <b>people</b> <b>in</b> <b>those</b> groups or the size of the groups.

He later recalled, [...] "I thought <b>people</b> <b>in</b> <b>those</b> conditions would have very, very, reduced language—they wouldn't be really a verbal society any more, and I think we're heading towards that.

The Allies unwilling to risk a new fiasco, but determined to solve the problem, established a naval blockade around southern Greece, which was still loyal to the king, and that caused extreme hardship to <b>people</b> <b>in</b> <b>those</b> areas.

2500|$|Santa Maria {{was founded}} as an {{independent}} town by the Franciscan Fray Francisco Dominguez Javier on November 26, 1793. He began constructing the church which was completed in the early 1800s by Fray Tomas Marti. The construction of the church was viewed {{as the foundation of}} the spiritual crusade in the said locality. Natives were converted into Christianity and more people began to inhabit the place. Civil affairs started to take shape and the appointment of the first Capitan del Barrio, Andres dela Cruz, paved way for the permanent establishment of Poblacion, which was the seat of Spanish colonial government. <b>People</b> <b>in</b> <b>those</b> days were just renting their pieces of land. They paid their rents to the friars who were stationed in what is now known as Santa Clara, a barangay where at present one can see the ruins of a big convento of friars. People from other nearby places such as [...] Balagtas, Pandi, Santa Maria, and San Jose del Monte, paid their rents in this convento. Santa Maria at that time was then called [...] "Santa Maria de Pandi". The people acquired their lands after paying certain sum to the friars and the land became [...] "Lupang Tagalog".|$|E
2500|$|According to {{the free}} market view, a secure system of private {{property}} rights {{is an essential part}} of economic freedom. [...] Such systems include two main rights: the right to control and benefit from property and the right to transfer property by voluntary means. These rights offer people the possibility of autonomy and self-determination according to their personal values and goals. Economist Milton Friedman sees property rights as [...] "the most basic of human rights and an essential foundation for other human rights." [...] With property rights protected, people are free to choose the use of their property, earn on it, and transfer it to anyone else, as long as they do it on a voluntary basis and do not resort to force, fraud or theft. In such conditions most people can achieve much greater personal freedom and development than under a regime of government coercion. A secure system of property rights also reduces uncertainty and encourages investments, creating favorable conditions for an economy to be successful. Empirical evidence suggests that countries with strong property rights systems have economic growth rates almost twice as high as those of countries with weak property rights systems, and that a market system with significant private property rights is an essential condition for democracy. According to Hernando de Soto, much of the poverty in the Third World countries is caused by the lack of Western systems of laws and well-defined and universally recognized property rights. De Soto argues that because of the legal barriers poor <b>people</b> <b>in</b> <b>those</b> countries can not utilize their assets to produce more wealth. One thinker to question private property was Pierre-Joseph Proudhon, a socialist and anarchist, who argued that property is both theft and freedom.|$|E
