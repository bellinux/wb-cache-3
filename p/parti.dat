5|$|Prior to the election, Dato' Onn Ja'afar {{had changed}} his approach, forming the <b>Parti</b> Negara after IMP {{suffered}} crushing losses to the Alliance in local elections. Advocating stronger pro-Malay policies recognising Malay political dominance, the <b>Parti</b> Negara failed to shake the Alliance's grip on power. However, some believe <b>Parti</b> Negara's proposals helped sway UMNO politicians towards more radically pro-Malay policies. The British themselves insisted on handing over power only to a multiracial government, and the Alliance was considered to meet this requirement.|$|E

5|$|Major {{political}} parties in Sarawak {{can be divided into}} three categories: native non-Muslim, native Muslim, and non-native; parties, however, may also include members from more than one group. The first political party, the Sarawak United Peoples' Party (SUPP), was established in 1959, followed by the <b>Parti</b> Negara Sarawak (PANAS) in 1960 and the Sarawak National Party (SNAP) in 1961. Other major {{political parties}} such as <b>Parti</b> Pesaka Sarawak (PESAKA) appeared by 1962. These parties later joined the national coalition of the Alliance Party. The Alliance Party (later regrouped into Barisan Nasional) has ruled Sarawak since the formation of Malaysia. The opposition in Sarawak has consistently alleged that the ruling coalition uses various types of vote-buying tactics in order to win elections. Stephen Kalong Ningkan was the first Chief Minister of Sarawak from 1963 to 1966 following his landslide victory in local council elections. However, he was ousted in 1966 by Tawi Sli {{with the help of the}} Malaysian federal government, causing the 1966 Sarawak constitutional crisis.|$|E

40|$|Objective: To analyze {{hemorrhage}} at vaginal delivery using hemoglobin and hematocrit indices. Methods: This was a {{cross-sectional study}} of 328 vaginal deliveries divided into spontaneous delivery {{with or without}} episiotomy and forceps delivery. The sample was randomly stratified by type of vaginal delivery. Data were collected at admission for delivery, hospital discharge and postpartum return visit. Results: There were 122 (37. 2 %) deliveries without episiotomy, 147 (44. 8 %) with episiotomy, and 59 (18. 0 %) with forceps delivery and episiotomy. Hemoglobin values between admission for delivery and discharge ranged from - 5. 9 g/dl to 0. 7 g/dl. Hemoglobin reduction was significantly higher in women having forceps delivery than in those with spontaneous deliveries, with and without episiotomy (p= 0. 0133 and p< 0. 0001, respectively). Hemorrhage was greater in the forceps delivery group than in the other groups. Conclusion: The analysis of hemorrhage at vaginal delivery by using hemoglobin and hematocrit indices showed variation among {{the three types of}} vaginal delivery studied. There was greater hemorrhage with forceps delivery and less hemorrhage with spontaneous delivery. In women with forceps delivery, postpartum indices were lower than those at hospital admission. Objetivo: Analisar a hemorragia no <b>parto</b> vaginal através dos índices de eritrócitos e hematócrito. Métodos: Estudo transversal realizado em 328 <b>partos</b> vaginais divididos em: espontâneo, com e sem episiotomia, e <b>parto</b> fórceps.

Background: Postnatal {{depression}} is a pathology {{occurring in the}} first weeks after childbirth with negative consequence not only for mothers, but also for theirs babies and families. Objective: To examine the prevalence of postnatal depression and factors that might predict depressive symptoms one week and three months after childbirth. Methods: 197 pregnant women filled out the Anticipation of Childbirth Questionnaire (QAP) (Costa et al., 2005 a) in the 2 nd trimester of pregnancy. In the first week after childbirth participants filled out the Experience and Satisfaction with the Childbirth Questionnaire (QESP) (Costa et al., 2005 b) and the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) (Augusto et al., 1996). Three months after childbirth, EPDS questionnaire was filled out again. Results: A significant number of women is clinically depressed (EPDS ≥ 13) {{in the first week}} and three months after childbirth (12. 4 % and 13. 7 %, respectively). Of those with EPDS ≥ 13 in the first week, 25 % are still clinically depressed 3 months after childbirth.

The Yang di-Pertua Negeri sits {{at the top of the}} hierarchy followed by the state legislative assembly and the state cabinet. It is the head of state although its functions are largely ceremonial. The chief minister is the head of government as well the leader of the state cabinet. The legislature is based on the Westminster system and therefore the chief minister is appointed based on his or her ability to command the majority of the state assembly. While local authorities being fully appointed by the state government owing to the suspension of local elections by the federal government. Legislation regarding state elections are within the powers of the federal government and not the state. The assembly meets at the state capital, Kota Kinabalu. Members of the state assembly are elected from 73 constituencies which are delineated by the Election Commission of Malaysia and may not necessarily result in constituencies of same voter population sizes. A general election representatives in the state assembly must be held every five years, when the seats are subject of universal suffrage for all citizens above 21 years of age.

5|$|The MNC's main rival was the Alliance des Bakongo (ABAKO), led by Joseph Kasa-Vubu, who {{advocated}} {{a more radical}} ideology than the MNC, based around calls for immediate independence {{and the promotion of}} regional identity. ABAKO's stance was more ethnic nationalist than the MNC's; it argued that an independent Congo should be run by the Bakongo as inheritors of the pre-colonial Kingdom of the Kongo. The Confédération des Associations Tribales du Katanga (CONAKAT), a localist party led by Moïse Tshombe, was the third major organisation; it advocated federalism and primarily represented the southern province of Katanga. These were joined by a number of smaller parties which emerged as the nationalist movement developed, including the radical <b>Parti</b> Solidaire Africain (PSA), and factions representing the interests of minor ethnic groups like the Alliance des Bayanzi (ABAZI).|$|E
5|$|Although it was {{the largest}} of the African {{nationalist}} parties, the MNC had many different factions within it that took differing stances on a number of issues. It was increasingly polarised between moderate évolués and the more radical mass membership. A radical and federalist faction headed by Ileo and Albert Kalonji split away in July 1959, but failed to induce mass defections by other MNC members. The dissident faction became known as the MNC-Kalonji (MNC-K), while the majority group became the MNC-Lumumba (MNC-L). The split divided the party's support base into those who endured with Lumumba, chiefly in the Stanleyville region in the north-east, and those who backed the MNC-K, popular in the south and among Kalonji's own ethnic group, the Baluba.

In reaction to the founding of the MDRM, in 1946 the Party for the Disinherited of Madagascar (<b>Parti</b> des déshérités de Madagascar, PADESM) was formed. It attracted membership from members of coastal communities formerly subjugated by the Merina empire, as well as highland-based descendents of former Merina slaves. Initially a non-nationalist party, PADESM eventually favored a gradual process toward independence that would preserve close ties to France and prevent the reemergence of the precolonial Merina hegemony. The French authorities tacitly supported PADESM, which accused MDRM of launching the uprising to re-establish Merina rule. By aligning itself with PADESM, Socialist-dominated French politicians sought to cast themselves as champions of the oppressed masses against the exploitative Hova elites.|$|E
