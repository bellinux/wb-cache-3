MethodsA paired cross-sectional birth observation study was conducted with a convenience sample of 18 clinics (nine pairs of intervention and control clinics) from June 28 to August 7, 2013. Outcomes included implementation of practices known to decrease maternal and/or neonatal mortality and improve patient care. ResultsOverall, 25 and 17 births occurred in intervention and control clinics, respectively. Active management of the third stage of labor was appropriately performed by 20 (83 %) of 24 intervention teams versus 7 (50 %) of 14 control teams (P= 0. 015). Intervention teams implemented more practices to decrease neonatal mortality than did control teams (P< 0. 001). Intervention teams ensured patient privacy in 23 (92 %) of 25 births versus 11 (65 %) of 17 births for control teams (P= 0. 014). All 15 applicable intervention teams kept patients informed versus 6 (55 %) of 11 control teams (P= 0. 001).

40|$|Intracranial {{hypertension}} (ICH) was systematized in {{four categories}} {{according to its}} aetiology and pathogenic mechanisms: parenchymatous ICH with an intrinsic cerebral cause; vascular ICH, which has its aetiology in disorders of cerebral blood circulation; ICH caused by disorders of cerebro-spinal fluid dynamics and idiopathic ICH. The increase of intracranial pressure {{is the first to}} happen and then intracranial hypertension develops from this initial effect becoming symptomatic; it then acquires its individuality, surpassing the initial disease. The intracranial hypertension syndrome corresponds to the stage at which the increased intracranial pressure can be compensated and the acute form of intracranial hypertension is equivalent to a decompensated ICH syndrome. The decompensation of intracranial hypertension is a condition of instability and appears when the normal intrinsic ratio of intracranial pressure – time fluctuation is changed. The essential conditions for decompensation of intracranial hypertension are: the speed of intracranial pressure increase over normal values, the highest value of abnormal intracranial pressure and the duration of high ICP values.

40|$|Background Rapid {{restoration}} of vessel patency after {{acute myocardial infarction}} is key to reducing myocardial muscle death and increases survival rates. Standard therapies include thrombolysis and direct PTCA. Alternative or adjunctive <b>emergency</b> <b>therapies</b> that could be initiated by minimally trained personnel {{in the field are}} of potential clinical benefit. This paper evaluates a method of accelerating reperfusion through application of low frequency mechanical stimulus to the blood carrying vessels. Materials and method We consider a stenosed, heparinized flow system with aortic-like pressure variations subject to direct vessel vibration at the occlusion site or vessel deformation proximal and distal to the occlusion site, versus a reference system lacking any form of mechanical stimulus on the vessels. Results The experimental results show limited effectiveness of the direct mechanical vibration method and a drastic increase in the patency rate when vessel deformation is induced. For vessel deformation at occlusion site 95 % of clots perfused within 11 minutes of application of mechanical stimulus, for vessel deformation 60 centimeters from the occlusion site 95 % percent of clots perfused within 16 minutes of stimulus application, while only 2. 3 % of clots perfused within 20 minutes in the reference system.

40|$|We {{analyzed}} {{the role of}} adhesion molecules in the pathogenesis of experimental cerebral malaria (ECM), since tumor necrosis factor (TNF) {{plays a major role}} in this condition and has been shown to up-regulate in vitro expression of cell adhesion molecules (CAM), particularly intercellular CAM- 1 (ICAM- 1). We found increased expression of ICAM- 1 on brain endothelial cells from mice with ECM. Treatment with monoclonal antibodies (mAb) directed against leukocyte function-antigen 1 (LFA- 1, the ligand of ICAM- 1) on days 6, 8 and 10 almost totally prevented ECM, while decreasing blood TNF levels. To exclude the possibility that the effects of anti-LFA- 1 mAb resulted from an even partial inhibition of TNF overproduction, mice with signs of imminent death (hypothermia and neurologic defects) were treated with the anti-LFA- 1 mAb, with dramatically protective effect. In contrast, injection of anti-ICAM- 1 mAb on day 6 caused rapid death, while it was innocuous in normal mice. An mAb directed against complement receptor type 3 (CR 3) was ineffective, as were injections of soluble human ICAM- 1. These results suggest that adhesion of LFA- 1 + cells to endothelial cells, stimulated by TNF to express high levels of ICAM- 1, is critical in the pathogenesis of ECM. <b>Emergency</b> <b>therapy</b> at interfering with cytoadherence could be considered in the treatment of cerebral malaria in man, in which high blood TNF levels are also observe...|$|R
