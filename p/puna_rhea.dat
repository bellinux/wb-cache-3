50|$|The {{numbers of}} both the greater and <b>puna</b> <b>rhea</b> are {{decreasing}} as their habitats are shrinking. Both are considered near threatened by the IUCN. The IUCN also states that they are both approaching vulnerable status. The lesser rhea is classified as least concern.|$|E
50|$|The IUCN {{considers}} the former two northern taxa R. p. tarapacensis and R. p. garleppi {{as a separate}} species, the <b>puna</b> <b>rhea</b> (R. tarapacensis). Both garleppi and tarapacensis were described by Charles Chubb in 1913. It is possible garleppi {{should be considered a}} junior synonym of tarapacensis.|$|E
50|$|There are {{endangered}} species in Chile, including the South Andean huemul, tundra peregrine falcon, <b>puna</b> <b>rhea,</b> Chilean woodstar, ruddy-headed goose, and green sea turtle. As of 2001, 16 species of mammals {{in a total}} of 91 were considered endangered. Of 296 breeding bird species, 18 were threatened with extinction. Also threatened were four types of freshwater fish and 268 plant species.|$|E

Endangered species in Argentina include the ruddy-headed goose, Argentinean pampas deer, South Andean huemul, <b>puna</b> <b>rhea,</b> tundra peregrine falcon, black-fronted piping guan, glaucous macaw, spectacled caiman, the broad-nosed caiman, Lear's macaw, the guayaquil great green macaw, and the American crocodile.|$|E
5000|$|The rheas [...] {{are large}} ratites (flightless birds without a keel on their sternum bone) {{in the order}} Rheiformes, native to South America, related to the ostrich and emu. There were {{formerly}} two, but now three recognized extant species: the greater or American rhea (Rhea americana), the lesser or Darwin's rhea (Rhea pennata) and the <b>puna</b> <b>rhea</b> (Rhea tarapacensis). The greater and puna rheas are currently rated as near-threatened in their native ranges, while Darwin's rhea is of least concern; a feral population of the greater rhea in Germany appears to be growing.|$|E
