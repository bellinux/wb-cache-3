5|$|M-139 was {{designated}} as a state trunkline by 1931 from US31 at Scottdale to US12 in Benton Harbor. In late 1953 or early 1954 M-139 was extended westward along US12 and then northward along <b>Paw</b> <b>Paw</b> Avenue to meet a new bypass routing of US31 north of Benton Harbor. US31 was rerouted to follow {{what is now the}} I-196 freeway in 1963. At that time, US31 was then routed along I-94 and M-139 to Scottdale. The following year, the concurrency was removed when M-139 was truncated to end at I-94/US31. The northern extension on <b>Paw</b> <b>Paw</b> Avenue was turned back to local control, truncating the northern end of M-139 to the intersection with BL I-94 (previously US12).|$|E
5|$|One {{field study}} found that red wattlebirds foraged for longer periods when nectar {{concentrations}} in flowers were low, and consumed fewer insects at this time.

40|$|This study {{investigated}} the prevalence of <b>pawing</b> behavior in Standardbred racehorses. A population of 41 currently racing Standardbred racehorses was observed twice daily {{for a period of}} two months to determine if there was a relationship between <b>pawing</b> and sex, gait or time of day. Twenty-four of the 41, or 58. 5 percent of observed horses showed <b>pawing</b> behavior at the time of observation. The group of horses which showed the <b>pawing</b> behavior consisted of eight females and 16 males. Observations of <b>pawing</b> ranged from 0. 83 percent to 31. 4 percent of total observations with the average percentage of <b>pawing</b> observations at 10. 6 percent of total observations. The majority of <b>pawing</b> observations were recorded in the afternoon with an average number of 79. 8 percent occurring in the afternoon, while an average of 20. 2 percent of <b>pawing</b> observations occurred in the morning. These findings indicate that greater than half of the observed population of Standardbreds exhibited <b>pawing</b> behavior, and within the <b>pawing</b> group the majority showed significantly more <b>pawing</b> behavior during the afternoon observation (P< 0. 05). These results have important implications for future studies investigating stereotypic behavior not only in horses, but across species as well...|$|R

5|$|When M-40 {{was created}} around by July 1, 1919, it {{originally}} ran from Niles to Dowagiac and Decatur roughly along the current path of M-51. Then it {{traveled to the}} northeast where it entered <b>Paw</b> <b>Paw</b> and continued north to Allegan. By 1921, M-40 is shown on maps extending south of Niles to the Indiana state line, but not extending to Allegan. The segment from Niles south {{was used for the}} routing of US31 in 1926. A section of the highway was realigned in the same time period near <b>Paw</b> <b>Paw.</b> After the change, M-40 followed the contemporary US12 instead of <b>Paw</b> <b>Paw</b> Road. A rerouting of M-89 in 1927 shifted it to run from Allegan southeast to Plainwell instead of east to Martin; M-40 replaced M-89 on the Allegan–Martin roadway. In 1929, the routing from Allegan to Martin was removed and renumbered M-118, and M-40 was extended to the north out of Allegan along M-89 and its modern routing to a new terminus in Holland ending at US31. The last segment of unpaved highway was paved in late 1945 or early 1946. This segment was near Dunningville in central Allegan County.|$|E

40|$|The {{objectives}} {{of this study}} were to determine the prevalence of <b>pawing</b> behavior in a population of Standardbred racehorses and the relationship of <b>pawing</b> frequency to time of day. Standardbreds (n= 41) were observed using instantaneous scan sampling twice daily, in the morning before training and in the afternoon after training. A majority of the horses, twenty-four (58. 5 %) of the 41 horses showed <b>pawing</b> behavior at least once (median= 7, interquartile range= 2 – 15). After training, there were a median of 4 (interquartile range 1 – 11) observations of <b>pawing</b> or 11. 2 % of total observations. In the morning, before training, there were 3 (0 – 3. 25) <b>pawing</b> observations, or 9. 1 % of total observations. There was a significantly greater frequency of <b>pawing</b> in the afternoon (P= 0. 0005).
