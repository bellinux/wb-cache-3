40|$|A new semiautomated {{instrument}} is described which quantifies {{the number of}} bacteria in <b>potable</b> <b>waters</b> within 3 min, providing a permanent colorimetric record of the results. The bacteria detection device can measure as few as 100 CFU/ml in <b>potable</b> <b>waters.</b> In brief, a 100 - to 1, 000 -ml sample of tap water is drawn through a large surface, customized filter housed in the device, and bacteria, rust, and humic acid in the water are concentrated thereon. A reducing agent is used to remove the rust and humic acid from the filter. The filter is inverted and backflushed to elute the bacteria which are collected and reconcentrated onto a 7 -mm-diameter filter surface. The reconcentrated bacteria are stained, and the filter fibers are preferentially decolorized without removing the dye from the bacteria. The color intensity of the filter surface is compared with a color guide to {{determine the amount of}} bacteria in the test water...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—Asbestos {{appears not}} {{to act as a}} potent gut {{carcinogen}} in humans or other animals. In humans it appears only so to act in those who have been occupationally exposed and who have swallowed substantial amounts of asbestos following inhalation. The amounts of asbestos naturally occurring in <b>potable</b> <b>waters</b> or added during the passage of such waters through asbestos-cement pipes are so small that one would not expect them to induce gut cancer; all epidemiological studies are consistent with this view. THE PROBLEM IN THE light of our present knowledge this question resolves itself into two questions: Does the ingestion of asbestos lead to cancer of the gut or mesothelioma of the peritoneum? If so, does the use of asbestos-cement pipes increase to any significant extent the asbestos content of <b>potable</b> <b>waters</b> passing through it? ANIMAL EXPERIMENTS In considering the first question {{it should be noted that}} human data are available; data obtained by animal experimentation are of limited value. Nonetheless, the anima...|$|R
