And the primitiveness of the supposed single stock, which, after all, is the essential part of the matter, is not only a hypothesis, but one which has not a shadow of foundation, if by [...] "primitive" [...] be meant [...] "independent of any other living being." [...] A scientific definition, of which an unwarrantable hypothesis forms an essential part, carries its condemnation within itself; but even supposing such a definition were, in form, tenable, the physiologist who should attempt to apply it in Nature would soon find himself involved in great, if not inextricable difficulties. As we have said, it is indubitable that offspring tend to resemble the <b>parental</b> <b>organism,</b> but it is equally true that the similarity attained never amounts to identity, either in form or in structure. There is always a certain amount of deviation, not only from the precise characters of a single parent, but when, as in most animals and many plants, the sexes are lodged in distinct individuals, from an exact mean between the two parents. And indeed, on general principles, this slight deviation seems as intelligible as the general similarity, if we reflect how complex the co-operating [...] "bundles of forces" [...] are, and how improbable it is that, in any case, their true resultant shall coincide with any mean between the more obvious characters of the two parents. Whatever be its cause, however, the co-existence of this tendency to minor variation with the tendency to general similarity, is of vast importance in its bearing {{on the question of the}} origin of species.|$|E

In contrast to previous results from a gnotobiotic rat system, these mutants also induced significantly fewer smooth-surface carious lesions compared with that by strain UA 130.

However, in contrast to the <b>parental</b> <b>organism,</b> glucose-grown cultures of the mutant did not adhere to smooth surfaces when incubated with sucrose under nongrowing conditions.

In addition, the extracellular activity of the mutant was also severely depressed relative to the parental activity. The reduced levels of mutant enzyme activity appear to be a result of a mutation in a structural gene coding for glucosyltransferase activity since (i) mutant glucosyltransferase activity is much less resistant to heat inactivation compared to the parental enzymes and (ii) the migration patterns of the mutant and parental enzymes differ on polyacrylamide gels and after isoelectric focusing on polyacrylamide gels. However, the kinetic properties of the mutant enzymes {{are similar to those of}} the comparable parental activities in terms of pH and temperature optima and Km values for sucrose.

This is the first demonstration of a two-step mobilization of a genetically engineered plasmid in any type of fresh water, including drinking water. Transfer was mediated by R plasmid R 100 - 1 of E. coli ED 2149 (R 100 - 1). Matings in drinking water at 15, 25, and 35 degrees C yielded recombinants, the number of which increased with increasing temperature. Numbers of recombinants obtained were 2 orders of magnitude lower than those obtained from matings in Trypticase soy broth. High concentrations of <b>parental</b> <b>organisms</b> (2. 6 x 10 (8) to 2. 0 x 10 (9) CFU/ml) were required. During 1 week of incubation in drinking water, number of <b>parental</b> <b>organisms</b> and recombinants resulting from mobilization remained constant {{in the absence of}} indigenous organisms and declined in their presence. Using oligonucleotide probes for the cloned foreign DNA (thymidine kinase gene) and plasmid vector DNA (ampicillin resistance gene), we demonstrated that both genes were transferred to E. cloacae in the mobilization process. In one recombinant selected for detailed study, the plasmids containing these genes differed in size from all forms of pHSV 106 present in E. coli HB 101 (pHSV 106), indicating that DNA rearrangement had occurred.

In addition, MT 10, as well as the recently characterized protease mutant G- 102, which is defective in the rgpB gene, displayed reduced self-aggregation, hemagglutination, and the ability to bind to immobilized type I collagen compared to levels of the wild-type parent.

Mutants that can grow without tryptophan were not isolated, but those that can grow on anthranilate or indole as well as on tryptophan were obtained at a frequency expected for single-step mutations. Activity of tryptophan synthetase was demonstrated in extracts of these anthranilate-utilizing mutants, but not in the parental strain. These results suggest that the multiple nutritional requirements of L. casei are often, if not always, due to one or a few small lesions such as base substitution mutations rather than large deletions affecting the genes involved in each biosynthetic pathway. The data would also imply that many of the biosynthetic pathways that are not fully functional in L. casei were active at one time and became nonfunctional during evolution of the present species...|$|E

The deletion of one or two amino acid residues at the C terminus had no effect on the acid-tolerance properties of mutants. When further amino acid residues at the C terminus were removed, mutants became more acid-sensitive. The mutant with deletion of eight amino acid residues at the C terminus did not grow at pH 5. 5, suggesting that the C-terminal tail of the Dgk homologue was indispensable for tolerance to acid stress in S. mutans. Kinase activity assays revealed that deletion of the C-terminal amino acids of Dgk led to a reduction of kinase activity for undecaprenol. A truncated mutant that had completely lost kinase activity was unable to grow at pH 5. 5. These results suggest that the acid tolerance of S. mutans is closely related to kinase activity of the Dgk homologue. Additionally, the dgk deletion mutant exhibited markedly reduced levels of smooth-surface carious lesions in pathogen-free rats, despite there being no difference between the mutant and the <b>parental</b> <b>organism</b> in the extent of total smooth surface plaque.

Transfer of the wild-type luxD gene into the V. harveyi M 17 mutant by this means resulted in complementation of the luxD mutation and full restoration of luminescence in the mutant; expression of transferase activity was induced if DNA upstream of luxC preceded the luxD gene on the plasmid, indicating the presence of a strong inducible promoter. To extend the usefulness of the transfer system, the gene for chloramphenicol acetyltransferase was inserted into the pKT 230 vector as a reporter. The promoter upstream of luxC was verified to be cell density regulated and, in addition, glucose repressible. It is suggested that this promoter may be the primary autoregulated promoter of the V. harveyi luminescence system. Strong termination signals on both DNA strands were recognized and are located downstream from luxE at a point complementary to the longest mRNA from the lux operon. Structural lux genes transferred back into V. harveyi under control of the luxC promoter are expressed at very high levels in V. harveyi as determined by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis analysis: the gene transfer system is thus useful for expression of proteins as well as for studying the regulation of lux genes in their native environment...|$|E

Herein, we explored the role of Hp urease in bacterial survival in murine peritoneal macrophages and J 774 cells. Plasmid-free mutagenesis was used to replace ureA and ureB with cat in Hp Strains 11637 and 11916. ureAB null Hp lacked detectable urease activity and did not express UreA or UreB as judged by immunoblotting. Deletion of ureAB had no effect on Hp binding to macrophages or the rate or extent of phagocytosis. However, intracellular survival of mutant organisms was impaired significantly. Immunofluorescence microscopy demonstrated that (in contrast to <b>parental</b> <b>organisms)</b> mutant Hp resided in single phagosomes, which were acidic and accumulated the lysosome marker lysosome-associated membrane protein- 1 but not early endosome autoantigen 1. A similar phenotype was observed for spontaneous urease mutants derived from Hp Strain 60190. Treatment of macrophages with bafilomycin A 1, NH 4 Cl, or chloroquine prevented acidification of phagosomes containing mutant Hp. However, only ammonium chloride enhanced bacterial viability significantly. Rescue of ureAB null organisms was also achieved by surface adsorption of active urease. Altogether, our data indicate a role for urease and urease-derived ammonia in megasome formation and Hp survival. J...|$|R

Virtually all strains of the human bacterial pathogen Streptococcus pyogenes express a highly conserved extracellular cysteine protease known as streptococcal pyrogenic exotoxin B (SpeB). Two sets of isogenic strains deficient in SpeB cysteine protease activity were constructed by integrational mutagenesis using nonreplicating recombinant plasmids containing a truncated segment of the speB gene. Immunoblot analyses and enzyme assays confirmed that the mutant derivatives were deficient in expression of enzymatically active SpeB cysteine protease.

This {{is evident}} at the nucleotide level but also structurally, {{in the form}} of karyotypic variation and DNA content differences between strains. Although natural populations of T. cruzi are predominantly clonal, hybrid lineages (TcIId and TcIIe) have been identified and hybridisation has been demonstrated in vitro, raising the possibility that genetic exchange may continue to shape the evolution of this pathogen. The mechanism of genetic exchange identified in the laboratory is unusual, apparently involving fusion of diploid parents followed by genome erosion. We investigated DNA content diversity in natural populations of T. cruzi in the context of its genetic subdivisions by using flow cytometric analysis and multilocus microsatellite genotyping to determine the relative DNA content and estimate the ploidy of 54 cloned isolates. The maximum difference observed was 47. 5 % between strain Tu 18 cl 2 (TcIIb) and strain C 8 cl 1 (TcI), which we estimated to be equivalent to ∼ 73 Mb of DNA. Large DNA content differences were identified within and between discrete typing units (DTUs). In particular, the mean DNA content of TcI strains was significantly less than that for TcII strains (P< 0. 001). Comparisons of hybrid DTUs TcIId/IIe with corresponding parental DTUs TcIIb/IIc indicated that natural hybrids are predominantly diploid. We also measured the relative DNA content of six in vitro-generated TcI hybrid clones and their parents.

60|$|Sexual {{reproduction}} {{is quite a}} distinct matter. Here, in all these cases, what is required is the detachment of two portions of the <b>parental</b> <b>organisms,</b> which portions we know as the egg and the spermatozoon. In plants it is the ovule and the pollen-grain, as in the flowering plants, or the ovule and the antherozooid, as in the flowerless.

Now, what is remarkable about this mode of {{reproduction is}} this, that the egg by itself, or the spermatozoa by themselves, are unable to assume the parental form; but if they be brought into contact with one another, the effect of the mixture of organic substances proceeding from two sources appears to confer an altogether new vigour to the mixed product. This process is brought about, as we all know, by the sexual intercourse of the two sexes, and is called the act of impregnation. The result of this act {{on the part of the}} male and female is, that the formation of a new being is set up in the ovule or egg; this ovule or egg soon begins to be divided and subdivided, and to be fashioned into various complex organisms, and eventually to develop into the form of one of its parents, as I explained in the first lecture. These are the processes by which the perpetuation of organic beings is secured. Why there should be the two modes--why this re-invigoration should be required on the part of the female element we do not know; but it is most assuredly the fact, and it is presumable, that, however long the process of asexual multiplication could be continued, I say there is good reason to believe that it would come to an end if a new commencement were not obtained by a conjunction of the two sexual elements.|$|R
40|$|Copyright © 2008 Published by Elsevier GmbHThe {{hierarchical}} organisation {{of biological}} entities has important nomenclatural implications. Because {{of the independence}} of reproductive events across different organisational levels, species are not (necessarily) clades of organisms, and organisms are not (necessarily) clades of cells: a surviving ancestral species is a paraphyletic assemblage of <b>organisms,</b> and a <b>parental</b> multicellular <b>organism</b> is a paraphyletic group of cells. Thus, clades of species might not be clades of organisms, and clades of organisms might not be clades of cells. Phylogenetic definitions of clade names must employ specifiers (analogous to ‘type taxa’) appropriate to the relevant hierarchical level: for a clade of individual organisms, the specifiers should be organisms, and for a clade of species, the types should be species. If specifiers of the wrong organisational level are used, the entities defined can be highly problematic. At least in sexually-reproducing taxa, definitions of higher taxa cannot circumvent the species problem by simply referring to specimens instead of species. Michael S. Y. Lee and Adam Skinne...|$|R
40|$|Lipopolysaccharide-deficient mutants {{of smooth}} Brucella species (rough mutants) {{have been shown}} to arise spontaneously in culture. However, in situ {{analysis}} of Brucella infected macrophages using antibody directed against O-polysaccharide suggested a loss of reactivity of Brucella consistent with the appearance of rough organisms, and a potential contribution to infection. The experiments reported describe the direct recovery of Brucella from macrophages infected in vitro and from the spleens of infected mice at a frequency similar to that described in vitro, suggesting that Brucella dissociation is not simply an in vitro artifact. The frequency of appearance of spontaneous rough organisms deficient in O-polysaccharide expression measured in vitro is approximately 2 - 3 logs higher than the appearance of mutation to antibiotic resistance, purine auxotrophy or reversion of erythritol sensitive ∆eryC mutants to tolerance. Genetic trans-complementation using a plasmid-based expression of Brucella manBA successfully restored O-polysaccharide expression in only one third of O-polysaccharide deficient spontaneous mutants. Suggesting that the appearance of rough mutants is caused by mutation at more than one locus. In addition, Sanger sequencing of the manBA structural genes detected multiple sequence changes that may explain the observed phenotypic differences. The presence of O-polysaccharide resulted in macrophage and neutrophil infiltration into the peritoneal cavity and systemic distribution of the organism. In contrast, rough organisms are controlled by resident macrophages or by extracellular killing mechanisms and rapidly cleared from this compartment consistent with the inability to cause disease. Loss of O-polysaccharide expression appears to be stochastic giving rise to organisms with biological properties distinct from the <b>parental</b> smooth <b>organism</b> during the course of infection...|$|R
40|$|An {{outbreak}} of conjunctivitis, unaccompanied by {{involvement of the}} respiratory tract, is reported in a colony of white mice. A special strain of pleuropneumonia-like organisms was regularly isolated from the eyes and nasal passages of affected mice but not from the lungs or middle ears. Ocular carriage of these organisms {{in the absence of}} an inflammatory reaction occurred in at least 50 per cent of the adult mice. Transmission to the young was presumably initiated by <b>parental</b> contact, the <b>organisms</b> being recoverable after the eyes were open, and was continued after weaning by direct contact between cage mates. These organisms were repeatedly established on the conjunctiva of normal Swiss mice by direct contact with infected animals and subsequently maintained there for ten successive passages. Multiplication of the pleuropneumonia-like organisms, which was largely limited to the eye and its appendages, was accompanied by a low rate of conjunctivitis. The multiple conjunctival instillation of ocular washings from infected mice was the only additional method of implantation of the organisms which was successful...|$|R
40|$|Changes in the {{presence}} of outer membrane protein II (P. II) constituents of gonococci were demonstrated by selecting opacity variants and defining the 125 I-labeled bands of <b>parental</b> and variant <b>organisms.</b> In general, colony opacity phenotype was a convenient, reliable guide for obtaining variants that differed from their parents by the apparent single-step gain or loss of one P. II constituent. Within a given strain (three strains were studied), particular P. II species were associated with particular opacity phenotypes. This was well demonstrated in strain JS 3, in which five different P. II constituents were identified and compared. Four of these five P. II moieties were consistently associated with a characteristic degree of colony opacity: presence of the fifth P. II (P. IIa) did not correlate with a discernible increase in opacity when present either alone or in combination with other opacity-associated P. II moieties. The electrophoretic migration characteristics for each of the five P. II constituents of this strain differed with regard to apparent molecular weight and the effects of temperature and 2 -mercaptoethanol. The high prevalence of colony opacity variants indicates that gonococcal populations are capable of presenting a variety of surface components to their external environment...|$|R
40|$|Nesting {{behaviour}} {{is critical}} for reproductive success in oviparous <b>organisms</b> with no <b>parental</b> care. In <b>organisms</b> where sex is determined by incubation temperature, nesting behaviour may be a prime target of selection in response to unbalanced sex ratios. To produce an evolutionary change in response to sex-ratio selection, components of nesting behaviour must be heritable. We estimated the field heritability of two key components of nesting behaviour in a population of painted turtles (Chrysemys picta) with temperature-dependent sex determination by applying the ‘animal model’ to a pedigree reconstructed from genotype data. We obtained estimates of low to non-detectable heritability using repeated records across all environments. We then determined environment-specific heritability by grouping records with similar temperatures for the winter preceding the nesting season, a variable known to be highly associated with our two traits of interest, nest vegetation cover and Julian date of nesting. The heritability estimates of nest vegetation cover and Julian date of nesting were qualitatively highest and significant, or nearly so, after hot winters. Additive genetic variance for these traits was not detectable after cold winters. Our analysis suggests that the potential for evolutionary change of nesting behaviour may be dependent on the thermal conditions of the preceding winter, a season that is predicted to be especially subject to climate change...|$|R
40|$|Fine-scale {{environmental}} heterogeneity {{is predicted}} {{to be important in}} determining variation in genotypic diversity and in selection for important life history traits in natural populations. For example, theory suggests that organisms with complex life histories that involve both sexual and asexual modes of reproduction use sex to produce genotypically diverse and widely dispersed propagules for the colonisation of distant or unstable habitats, but rely on asexual reproduction to restock or maintain populations within their <b>parental</b> habitat. Such <b>organisms</b> should also have great potential for site-specific adaptation as multiple generations may compete within relatively static conditions. Surprisingly, little is still known about the importance of fine-scale genotypic variation and the degree of local adaptation within populations of clonal marine organisms. In this study, I used two brooding corals (Pocillopora damicornis and Seriatopora hystrix) and one brooding sea anemone (Actinia tenebrosa), to test for evidence of fine-scale adaptation and the effects of environmental heterogeneity on variation in genotypic diversity. Using a combination of genetic and experimental techniques I assessed: i) if reproductive mode varies with environmental heterogeneity across habitats, ii) how genotypic diversity varies over fine spatial scales (centimetres and meters), and iii) if different clonal genotypes show evidence of fine-scale adaptation to specific habitats. My data on the population genetics and mode of reproduction for the corals P. damicornis and S. hystrix did not support theoretical predictions. Brooded larvae from P. damicornis colonies collected in five reef habitats were all produced asexually. In contrast, brooded larvae of Seriatopora hystrix were sexually produced, with up to three sires contributing to some broods (rp (�SE) = 0. 32 � 0. 43), and almost half (46...|$|R
