There was a big building inside the village that had a hoist for casks. The boys arranged a big barrel of petroleum, with phosphorus bombs inside, that was all poised ready to swing. When a tank came through the village and slowed to make the turn they would just <b>pull</b> a <b>catch</b> and the barrel would smack the tank fair and square and go off with a great gust of flame." ...|$|R

50|$|Just as in free climbing, {{the usual}} aid {{technique}} involves two climbers, {{a leader and}} a belayer. The leader is connected by a rope to the belayer, who remains at the belay station while the leader moves up. As the leader advances, the rope is let out by the belayer, and clipped by the leader into the pieces of protection as they are placed. If the leader falls, the belayer locks off the rope and, assuming the protection doesn't <b>pull</b> out, <b>catches</b> the leader's fall on the rope. When the leader, moving up, reaches {{the end of the}} rope, or a convenient stopping point, he or she builds an anchor, hangs on it, and fixes the rope to it. This then becomes the next belay station. The belayer then ascends the fixed rope using mechanical ascenders, retrieving the protection that was placed by the leader. Meanwhile, the leader sets up a hauling system and, using another rope brought up for that purpose, hauls up a bag containing the climbers' food, water, hammocks or porta-ledge, sleeping bags, and so on. Many variations on this basic technique are possible, including solo aid climbing and climbing with a team of three or more.|$|R
50|$|As {{a sophomore}} in 2013, Diggs played in only seven games, missing the final six {{games of the}} season after {{suffering}} a season-ending injury at Wake Forest. He was an honorable mention All-ACC selection by the media and coaches despite the injury. He began his sophomore campaign with an impressive game against FIU, recording 98 yards receiving and one touchdown and 70 return yards on three kickoffs. His impressive play carried over against Old Dominion by recording a career-best 179 yards receiving and a touchdown, earning ACC Receiver of the Week honors for his play. He had 110 receiving yards and a touchdown against Connecticut. However, in Maryland's 34-10 loss to Wake Forest, Diggs broke his right fibula, ending his season.

50|$|The ride {{begins when}} the train slowly backs {{out of the station}} and up the {{vertical}} lift, <b>pulled</b> by a <b>catch</b> car. Once reaching the top of the lift, with riders facing straight down, and their legs dangling in the air, the train is released and zooms through the station heading into a 110 ft tall boomerang. This element contains two of the three inversions found on the ride going forward. After twisting through the Boomerang, riders then go through a 102 ft tall vertical loop which crosses over the station and hit the second vertical tower of the ride. A <b>catch</b> car there <b>pulls</b> the train up the second vertical tower, this time with riders facing the sky. After the train reaches the top of the tower, it is released to cycle backward through the layout. The train then goes through the station and heads up the first vertical lift again, where it is caught once more by the catch car and then very slowly lowered back into the station.|$|R
5000|$|Xcelerator's {{powerful}} hydraulic catapult motor accelerates {{the train}} to 82 mi/h km/h in 2.3 seconds (about 1.62 g). It only uses 157 ft of track to launch the train. The twin hydraulic catapult motor achieves a maximum of [...] each while accelerating the train. Xcelerator's hydraulic motor system has the mechanical capability of accelerating vehicles to a speed of 117 mi/h km/h or more, though it only needs to hit 82. In order for a train to launch, it must [...] "drift" [...] back to [...] "hook" [...] into the catch car. Twenty-four volts are used to demagnetize a pin underneath the third car, causing it to drop. At the same time, two bellows actuators fill up with air, causing the two drive tires holding the train in place, at the train's rear, to retract. The brakes will lower while the train rolls back to hook, and the pin will then hook into the catch car—which is over 7 ft long. Once connected, the motor will <b>pull</b> the <b>catch</b> car over nylon runners and launch the train. In order to stop the catch car, it passes over {{its own set of}} magnetic brakes. If the train is lightly loaded, the motor has to work harder to attain launch speed. Often the catch car may overshoot its ending position and down itself if it cannot attain the speed within parameters. The train must also clear the launch track within three seconds, or the ride will down itself and produce a shortshot. From the time the launch begins, the train has 8.25 seconds to pass over a proximity switch (Hall effect sensor) {{near the bottom of the}} first valley, thus clearing the starting block. If the train does not pass over the switch within the given time frame, the ride will down itself.|$|R
500|$|To hunt fish, {{the eagle}} swoops {{down over the}} water and snatches the fish {{out of the water}} with its talons. They eat by holding the fish in one claw and tearing the flesh with the other. Eagles have {{structures}} on their toes called spicules that allow them to grasp fish. Osprey also have this adaptation. Bald eagles have powerful talons and have been recorded flying with a [...] mule deer (Odocoileus hemionus) fawn. This feat is the record for the heaviest load carrying ever verified for a flying bird. It has been estimated that the gripping power (pounds by square inch) of the bald eagle is ten times greater than that of a human. Bald eagles can fly with fish at least equal to their own weight, but if the fish is too heavy to lift, the eagle may be dragged into the water. It may swim to safety, in some cases <b>pulling</b> the <b>catch</b> along to the shore as it swims, but some eagles drown or succumb to hypothermia. Many sources claim that bald eagles, like all large eagles, cannot normally take flight carrying prey more than half of their own weight unless aided by favorable wind conditions. On numerous occasions, when large prey such as mature salmon or geese are attacked, eagles have been seen to make contact and then drag the prey in a strenuously labored, low flight over the water to a bank, where they then finish off and dismember the prey. When food is abundant, an eagle can gorge itself by storing up to [...] of food in a pouch in the throat called a crop. Gorging allows the bird to fast for several days if food becomes unavailable. Occasionally, bald eagles may hunt cooperatively when confronting prey, especially relatively large prey such as jackrabbits or herons, with one bird distracting potential prey, while the other comes behind it in order to ambush it. While hunting waterfowl, bald eagles repeatedly fly at a target and cause it to dive repeatedly, hoping to exhaust the victim so it can be caught (white-tailed eagles have been recorded hunting waterfowl in the same way). When hunting concentrated prey, a successful catch which often results in the hunting eagle being pursued by other eagles and needing to find an isolated perch for consumption if it is able to carry it away successfully.|$|R
50|$|After three {{successful}} {{years with}} Mike Mularkey, Ward began the season under new offensive coordinator Ken Whisenhunt and new wide receivers coach Bruce Arians. On September 19, 2004, he caught 6 passes for 151 receiving {{yards and a}} touchdown in a 13-30 loss at Baltimore. During the 4th quarter starting quarterback Tommy Maddox was injured and replaced by rookie quarterback Ben Roethlisberger. After replacing Maddox, Roethlisberger threw a touchdown pass to Ward, making it the first one of their career together. During a Week 3 contest at the Miami Dolphins, Ward caught 9 passes for 96 {{yards and a touchdown}}. After replacing Maddox, Roethlisberger led the Steelers to 14 wins in a row. On December 18, 2004, Ward made 9 catches for a season-high 134 yards as Pittsburgh beat the Giants 33-30 for their 13th consecutive victory. After finishing the season 15-1, the Steelers played the Jets for the divisional championship. During the 20-17 win, Ward racked up 10 catches for 105 receiving yards and a touchdown. On January 23, 2005, the Steelers lost 27-41 to the eventual Super Bowl XXXIX Champions, the New England Patriots. In the AFC Championship game, Ward <b>pulled</b> in 5 <b>catches</b> for 109-yards and a touchdown. For the fourth year in a row, he was voted to the Pro bowl along with Alan Faneca.

6000|$|... "At {{any moment}} she might die; {{at any moment}} she might become Lady Timpany. It was terrible, terrible. If she died, then he would die too; {{he would go to}} seek her beyond the grave. If she became Lady Timpany...ah, then! The {{solution}} of the problem would not be so simple. If she became Lady Timpany: it was a horrible thought. But then suppose she were in love with Timpany--though it seemed incredible that anyone could be in love with Timpany--suppose her life depended on Timpany, suppose she couldn't live without him? He was fumbling his way along this clueless labyrinth of suppositions when the clock struck twelve. On the last stroke, like an automaton released by the turning clockwork, a little maid, holding a large covered tray, popped out of the door that led from the kitchen regions into the hall. From his deep arm-chair George watched her (himself, it was evident, unobserved) with an idle curiosity. She pattered across the room and came to a halt in front of what seemed a blank expense of panelling. She reached out her hand and, to George's extreme astonishment, a little door swung open, revealing the foot of a winding staircase. Turning sideways in order to get her tray through the narrow opening, the little maid darted in with a rapid crab-like motion. The door closed behind her with a click. A minute later it opened again and the maid, without her tray, hurried back across the hall and disappeared {{in the direction of the}} kitchen. George tried to recompose his thoughts, but an invincible curiosity drew his mind towards the hidden door, the staircase, the little maid. It was in vain he told himself that the matter was none of his business, that to explore the secrets of that surprising door, that mysterious staircase within, would be a piece of unforgivable rudeness and indiscretion. It was in vain; for five minutes he struggled heroically with his curiosity, but at the end of that time he found himself standing in front of the innocent sheet of panelling through which the little maid had disappeared. A glance sufficed to show him the position of the secret door--secret, he perceived, only to those who looked with a careless eye. It was just an ordinary door let in flush with the panelling. No latch nor handle betrayed its position, but an unobtrusive catch sunk in the wood invited the thumb. George was astonished that he had not noticed it before; now he had seen it, it was so obvious, almost as obvious as the cupboard door in the library with its lines of imitation shelves and its dummy books. He <b>pulled</b> back the <b>catch</b> and peeped inside. The staircase, of which the degrees were made not of stone but of blocks of ancient oak, wound up and out of sight. A slit-like window admitted the daylight; he was at the foot of the central tower, and the little window looked out over the terrace; they were still shouting and splashing in the pool below.|$|R
40|$|In 2013, the 55 th Venice Biennale, {{the world}} 2 ̆ 7 s oldest bi-annual {{international}} contemporary art exhibition, opened {{under the title}} The Encyclopedic Palace, organized by Italian curator Massimiliano Gioni. The international exhibition section is always flanked by an amalgamation of distinct national spaces, a dual exhibition model {{that has been the}} hallmark of the Biennale since 1998. In 2013, the United States pavilion was devoted to American artist Sarah Sze 2 ̆ 7 s work Triple Point and her signature arrangement of everyday objects and materials, such as Q-tips, water bottles, painter 2 ̆ 7 s tape, and desk lamps. The title of Sze 2 ̆ 7 s multi-room installation, culled from earlier works as well as created from new materials, refers to the thermodynamic equilibrium of any given substance [...] specifically, a 2 ̆ 2 triple point 2 ̆ 2 is the temperature and pressure at which a substance is solid, liquid and gas at the same time. The quasi-scientific installations provide constantly shifting viewpoints as the viewer circumnavigates the interconnected spaces of the U. S. pavilion, moving amid, around, and through the work, but also focusing on different individual objects before <b>pulling</b> back to <b>catch</b> glimpses of the work as a whole. In this thesis, I apply a phenomenological analysis to Triple Point in order to make sense of its scientific references in conjunction with its complex form. I view Triple Point as a culmination of the ideas that Sze has sustained and explored over the course of her career [...] such as the investigation of everyday objects in relation to site, space, and viewer [...] that situates the viewer in an experience caught between empirical order and individual perception. To examine Triple Point using the idea of 2 ̆ 2 embodied perception, 2 ̆ 2 I formally analyze the work in relation to its scientific meanings as suggested by its titles of individual works [...] Gleaner, Planetarium, Eclipse, Scale, Orrery, Pendulum, Observatory, and Compass. I then trace the discourse surrounding phenomenology and the rise of installation art through the writings of art historians Michael Fried, Rosalind Krauss, and Claire Bishop, before finally situating French philosopher Maurice Merleau-Ponty 2 ̆ 7 s phenomenology as an apt theory for analyzing this work. In embracing both the scientific objectivity implied by Sze 2 ̆ 7 s installations without sacrificing the import of physical perception, I contend that Triple Point invites the viewer to look at [...] but also beyond [...] the array of familiar objects, emphasizing a shifting sense of the work that is never exhaustively fixed. Thus, Triple Point does not expose the classic dichotomies between art and science, natural and manufactured, image and object, but instead opens up the moment of their confluence [...] the paradoxical achievement of an embodied perception as described by Merleau-Ponty. Understood phenomenologically, Triple Point invites viewers to get caught-up in the dynamic experience of 2 ̆ 2 between-ness 2 ̆ 2 invoked by the installation 2 ̆ 7 s title and to engage with their everyday experiences of contemporary life in a new way...|$|R
40|$|The power clean {{exercise}} is commonly prescribed to athletes involved in strength and power sports {{due to the}} kinematic similarities that this exercise has to key phases during jumping and sprinting (e. g. explosive hip, knee and ankle extension). Another popular method to improve athletic performance and lower body power is training with a weighted vest (WV) (i. e. centralised loading) as it allows individuals to perform sports specific movements such as jumping and sprinting in an overloaded fashion. Weighted vest training {{may also be a}} possible alternative loading method that could allow individuals to continue to train with full body explosive exercises without being limited by the technique and mobility demands. However, it is currently unknown what effect this loading method has on full body explosive movements such as the power clean. Therefore this thesis sought to investigate the acute and longitudinal effects of centralised loading on the performance of the power clean exercise and athletic performance. The purpose of the first {{study was to determine the}} optimal load to be worn during the performance of the power clean exercise. This was achieved by comparing the acute kinematic and kinetic effects of performing the power clean with loads of 50 % and 70 % 1 RM across three conditions in nine recreationally trained males; 1) no Exo-skeleton, 2) 5 % bodyweight Exo-skeleton and, 3) 12 % body mass Exo-skeleton. Four of the kinematic variables measured were technique variables which were; 1) most forward position to catch (DxL), 2) start position to catch (DxT), 3) start position to beginning of 2 nd pull (Dx 2), and 4) 2 nd <b>pull</b> position to <b>catch</b> (DxV). It was concluded that the optimal Exo-skeleton load to be worn during the power clean was a load ~ 12 % of a lifter’s bodyweight and such loading may positively influence kinematic and kinetic variables during power clean performance. Following the results from study one, a five week power clean training intervention was devised to determine and compare the longitudinal kinematic, kinetic and performance effects of wearing a weighted Exo-skeleton vs. no Exo-skeleton. Sixteen resistance trained males were randomly assigned to either a no Exo-skeleton or a 12 % bodyweight Exo-skeleton group. Training with the 12 % Exo-skeleton resulted in a number of desirable technique changes (as determined by the variables noted above) that included increases in the rearward displacement of the barbell, increases in barbell velocity, and improved peak power outputs. Furthermore, the cumulative effect of improved lifting kinematics, barbell velocity, and PP resulted in the 12 % Exo-skeleton group improving the CMJ by 8. 5 % and 1 RM power clean performance by 4. 6 %. Conversely, the no Exo-skeleton group demonstrated only a mild increase in 1 RM power clean performance (1. 9 %) and a decrease in CMJ performance (- 1. 5 %). In conclusion, training with a 12 % Exo-skeleton is a viable alternative loading method for resistance trained males who wish to improve their power clean ability (both technique and performance) and CMJ performance...|$|R
40|$|Fishermen {{going out}} to the Northeast 2 ̆ 7 s famed fishing grounds {{over the last several years}} have been <b>pulling</b> in large <b>catches</b> of once-ailing {{groundfish}} after more than a decade of decline. Many fishermen, and even scientists and fishery managers, say that there are more fish in the ocean now than at any other point in recent memory. However, despite the plentiful landings, total landings are down in some ports from years past due to stiff regulations that strictly curtail the areas that can be fished and the total number of days that a fisherman can be at sea. This regulatory framework was put in place in an effort to limit the number of fish caught to a more sustainable level. Indeed, the increased landings that individual fishing boats are realizing indicate that the framework appears to be working, at least to a degree. The fisheries of the Northeast, however, still find themselves in a precarious position. Though the stocks of the principal groundfish appear to be rebounding, they remain quite low and in need of more time to rebuild. To sustain their current growth, the fisheries must stay closely monitored, and perhaps more importantly, minimally fished. Towards this goal, the National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS), the federal agency that oversees all commercial fishing in the Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ), issued a proposed set of rules in March 2002 that would curtail commercial fishing more drastically than it has been in the past. While the fisheries remain tenuously balanced between collapse and recovery, the fishermen who try to make their livings from those fisheries find themselves in an even more precarious position. New rules limiting days at sea may well be necessary for the preservation of ailing fish stocks, but they put yet another strain on the livelihoods of fishermen. Fishermen hoping to stay in business face considerable challenges from regulatory bodies like NMFS, depleted fish stocks, and competition from within an extremely tight industry. Because fishing is often a 2 ̆ 2 boom or bust 2 ̆ 2 industry, leaving fishermen without cash for long periods of time, fishermen are often highly leveraged and rely on credit for the extension of services and supplies. Fishermen need boats; and boats need adequate supplies, wharfage, and repair from shipyards and other facilities. Many of the fishermen who have been strapped for cash in these last years of heavy restrictions on days at sea and total allowable catch have had to pay for these goods and services on credit. The credit supplied by shipyards and other creditors gives rise to a maritime lien, the ungainly sea creature that will be the subject of this Comment. A maritime lien gives a creditor, in the event of a default or other defined trigger such as tort, the right to arrest and sell a vessel so that the creditor can collect on her debts. What 2 ̆ 7 s more, it is not only the vessel that is sold when a maritime lien is enforced; it is the vessel 2 ̆ 7 s appurtenances as well. Appurtenances include a vessel 2 ̆ 7 s sails, equipment, and anything that makes the vessel a 2 ̆ 2 going concern. 2 ̆ 2 Recently, the First Circuit ruled that fishing permits were so integral to a vessel that the permits should be considered appurtenances and thus be sold with the vessel when a creditor enforces a maritime lien. This decision may prove to have far reaching implications for the commercial fishing industry. This Comment will address the issue of maritime liens and the recent designation of fishing permits as appurtenances to those liens. The First Circuit case of Gowen, Inc. v. F/V Quality One will be analyzed as a current example of the issues and problems associated with that designation. This Comment maintains that the inclusion of fishing permits as appurtenances to maritime liens may endanger fishermen 2 ̆ 7 s livelihoods more than it benefits the creditors who extend goods and services to fishermen on credit. It will also argue that the inclusion of fishing permits is not required by case law or by any existing statute. To the contrary, it would be more equitable and less restrictive to treat fishing permits not as appurtenances, but as a distinct piece of property, to be treated as collateral in a separate maritime lien, enforced only if the value of the vessel itself is not equal to or greater than the value of the goods and/or services extended. Finally, it is important to mention what this Comment will not cover. The universe of maritime liens is intricately tied to both the law of admiralty and the law of secured transactions. It is my intention to provide a brief overview of maritime liens, fishing permits, and the separate regulatory regimes that control them for the purpose of elucidating and taking issue with the Gowen court 2 ̆ 7 s connection between fishing permits and maritime liens...|$|R
