25|$|The {{water is}} {{pressurized}} in two stages, and flows {{through a series}} of six or seven intermediate feed water heaters, heated up at each point with steam extracted from an appropriate duct on the turbines and gaining temperature at each stage. Typically, {{in the middle of this}} series of feedwater heaters, and before the second stage of pressurization, the condensate plus the makeup water flows through a deaerator that removes dissolved air from the water, further purifying and reducing its corrosiveness. The water may be dosed following this point with hydrazine, a chemical that removes the remaining oxygen in the water to below 5 parts per billion (ppb). It is also dosed with <b>pH</b> <b>control</b> agents such as ammonia or morpholine to keep the residual acidity low and thus non-corrosive.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. The TiO 2 /mica {{pearlescent}} pigments {{were prepared}} by the hydrolysis of TiOCl 2 on the natural mica (muscovite) followed by a calcinations process.
