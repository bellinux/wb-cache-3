5000|$|As the {{pneumatic}} operation of valves, compared to motorised operation, has cost and reliability advantages, pneumatic actuation {{is still an}} industry standard. To allow the construction of hybrid systems, where the 4-20 mA is generated by the controller, but {{enables the use of}} pneumatic valves, a range of current to pressure (I to P) converters are available from manufacturers. These are usually located locally to the control valve and convert 4-20 mA to 3-15 psi (or (0.2 - 1.0 bar).This signal is then fed to the valve actuator or more commonly, a pneumatic positioner. This is a dedicated controller with a <b>pneumatic</b> <b>nozzle</b> and flapper arrangement and a mechanical linkage to sense the valve actuator movement. This ensures that problems of friction are overcome and the valve control element moves to the desired position, by comparing the actual valve regulating element position against the desired value; hence the name [...] "positioner". As a mechanical linkage is used for this, the positioner has to be mounted on the valve body. A positioner also allows the use of higher air pressures for valve actuation, which is particularly useful with cylinder type valve actuators.|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this work}} was to {{increase}} the amount of recycled waste wood in the wood-processing industry. Contaminations such as plastics and wood preservatives therefore have to be identified and removed. A promising technique to detect this foreign matter is near-infrared (NIR) spectroscopy. For several organic and inorganic active compounds for wood preservation, the NIR reflectance spectra acquired with sensors with the capability of on-line measurements were characterized. Some of them were significantly different from those of previously published spectra. Moreover, untreated wood was distinguishable from wood treated with preservatives. Confounding factors, such as the water content, wood species and solvent of the preservative, were examined which had so far massively interfered the NIR detection and classification. Chemometric-based solutions are presented in this work to cope with analytical challenges arisen from the complexity of waste wood samples. This formed the basis for a sorting trial in which treated wood chips were detected in real time with an NIR spectrometer and automatically separated by <b>pneumatic</b> <b>nozzles,</b> showing that the laboratory experiments can be transferred into small industrial scale. Additionally, the experiments showed that wood–plastic composites (WPC) of different plastic types were distinguishable with NIR spectroscopy and can be sorted by ejection based on this information. Unmixed material is a major prerequisite for a high-quality recycling of WPC and has never been demonstrated on a technical scale. Furthermore, three different NIR devices (hyperspectral imaging camera, miniaturized spectrometer and sorting plant) were evaluated regarding their applicability in the waste wood recycling process...|$|R

50|$|Regarding sound {{generated}} {{inside the}} building, {{there are two}} principal types of transmission. Firstly, airborne sound travels through walls or floor and ceiling assemblies and can emanate from either human activities in adjacent living spaces or from mechanical noise within the building systems. Human activities might include voice, noise from amplified sound systems, or animal noise. Mechanical systems are elevator systems, boilers, refrigeration or air conditioning systems, generators and trash compactors. Aerodynamic sources include fans, pneumatics, and combustion. Noise control for aerodynamic sources include quiet air <b>nozzles,</b> <b>pneumatic</b> silencers and quiet fan technology. Since many mechanical sounds are inherently loud, the principal design element is to require the wall or ceiling assembly to meet certain performance standards, (typically Sound transmission class of 50), which allows considerable attenuation of the sound level reaching occupants.|$|R
40|$|The use of {{techniques}} and equipment designed to pneumatically place backfill into an underground mine opening through boreholes for subsidence abatement has historically met with limited success, {{largely due to}} the inability to directly monitor the placement of the backfill in the opening. The success of a backfilling project cannot be guaranteed if it is not known whether the underground opening has been completely filled with backfill material. To overcome the inability to directly monitor backfill placement, the U. S.

This system utilizes a recently developed <b>pneumatic</b> <b>nozzle</b> coupled with an instrumentation package that allows for real-time observations and measurements of backfill placed in an underground opening through a borehole.

Consequently, {{the aim of}} this study was to improve the dissolution of piroxicam. Microparticles containing piroxicam were produced by spray drying, using isopropyl alcohol and water in the ratio of 40 : 60 v/v as solvent system, and spray chilling technology by melting the drug and chilling it with a <b>pneumatic</b> <b>nozzle</b> to enhance dissolution rate. The prepared formulations were evaluated for in vitro dissolution and solubility. The prepared drug particles were characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), differential scanning calorimeter, X-ray diffraction and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. Dissolution profile of the spray dried microparticles was compared with spray-chilled microparticles, pure and recrystallized samples. Spray dried microparticles and spray chilled microparticles exhibited decreased crystallinity and improved micromeritic properties. The dissolution of the spray dried microparticle and spray chilled particles were improved compared with recrystallized and pure sample of piroxicam. Consequently, it was believed that spray drying of piroxicam is a useful tool to improve dissolution but not in case of spray chilling. This may be due to the degradation of drug or variations in the resonance structure or could be due to minor distortion of bond angles. Hence, this spray drying technique can be used for formulation of tablets of piroxicam by direct compression with directly compressible tablet excipients...|$|E

Because there are relatively few chemical options available for pepper pest management, {{it is critical}} to make efficacious application of pesticides. Foliar spray coverage and spray retention in the middle and bottom of bell pepper canopies were compared using fluorescent dyes and food coloring, respectively. Several delivery systems were evaluated, including air-induction and twin-fan nozzles, air-assisted delivery with conventional hydraulic <b>nozzles,</b> and <b>pneumatic</b> atomization <b>nozzles</b> producing electrically charged sprays. Plant spacing between and within rows was evaluated in the second year of the application trial. Travel speeds of 6. 4 and 12. 9 km h- 1 were also evaluated. Faster travel speeds did not significantly affect spray retention in twin-row canopies. The electrostatic sprayer produced the greatest differences in deposits between the middle and bottom of the canopy. Although there {{was no more than a}} 25 cm difference between leaves sampled from the middle and bottom canopy locations, spray retention on foliage in the bottom canopy locations had significantly lower retention than the middle canopy for almost all sprayer types.

At AMIL, freezing rain, freezing drizzle, icing fog and in-cloud icing {{as well as}} frost, snow, ice pellets and icing clouds can be simulated {{in a variety of}} cold chambers of different heights and with different wind conditions using specialized spraying systems and temperature set-ups. Freezing rain is simulated using a 9 m high vertical chamber capable of supercooling water droplets from 100 to 1000 μm, so they freeze not long after impact. The freezing drizzle is simulated in a 4 m high chamber where supercooled droplets from 50 to 250 μm freeze on impact. Icing fog and in-cloud icing are simulated {{with the help of a}} <b>pneumatic</b> spray <b>nozzle</b> system which allows for a finer water spray, in the 20 μm diameter range. The frost is simulated by saturating a cold room with humidity generated from a heated, temperature controlled water bath. Snow is simulated with a fine pneumatic water spray which forms a soft rime simulating the effect of natural snow. Ice pellets are made in the 9 m high vertical cold chamber using strong turbulent wind that increases the air residency and convective air cooling of water droplets so they freeze before impact. Finally, icing wind tunnels allow for the simulation of an object iced through a passing supercooled cloud.

40|$|Dust {{control is}} a very {{significant}} issue in underground coal mining. The benefits of reducing dust levels will be a lesser risk of lung disease to coal miners, improved working conditions and a reduced risk of dust explosions. Coal dust is commonly suppressed by water sprays but suppression efficiency is not high because dust tends to travel in the air flow round the water droplets rather than being captured by them. If water sprays are electrostatically charged, then a significant improvement in dust suppression efficiency may be achieved. Of the three principal droplet charging mechanisms, i. e. corona charging, induction charging and contact charging, corona charging is {{the most widely used}} in many industrial fields including dust suppression, However, it requires a high applied voltage, ranging from thousands to more than a hundred thousand volts, depending on the geometry of the charging equipment. Induction charging has been used in agricultural spraying since Law (1978) developed an embedded-electrode induction charging spraying nozzle. This nozzle provides a compact, inexpensively fabricated droplet charger and, reduces design requirements on size and output voltage (of the order of 1000 volts). It also reduces the potential for mechanical damage, misalignment and personnel hazard. In order {{to evaluate the effectiveness of}} dust suppression, either the charge on individual droplets or the charge-to-mass ratio of water sprays needs to be known. However, the parameters which control the charge applied to water and the charging rate have been unsolved theoretically for any charging mechanism. The existing theories for the induction-charged and air-atomising a liquid jet have been found to be inadequate. And there is no theory available for corona charging of the droplets produced with a <b>pneumatic</b> <b>nozzle</b> in order to predict the spray charge level or the spray charge-to-mass ratio. In view of this situation, mathematical models have been developed in this thesis for both the corona and induction charging mechanisms. During the development of the theories, it has been assumed that for corona charging, that the jet is disintegrated into droplets and the droplets are then charged; for induction charging, that the jet is first charged and the charged jet is then disintegrated into charged droplets. The Sauter mean diameter of the sprays, D 32, plays an important role in linking the individual droplet charge to the spray charge-to-mass ratio for both charging mechanisms. The developed theories are general models suitable for any liquid with both corona and induction charging. Theoretical calculations for the spray charge-to-mass ratio, individual droplet charge and the ratio of droplet charge to the Rayleigh charge limit have been presented for almost all of the influencing electrical and mechanical parameters such as applied voltage, air flowrate, liquid flowrate, liquid conductivity, liquid dielectric constant, nozzle dimensions, cylindrical electrode dimensions, and fluid parameters, for example, density, viscosity and surface tension. In the calculation for corona charging of droplets, the effect of the droplets on corona current and corona-onset voltage has been assessed for first time. The introduction of the Sauter mean diameter of the sprays, D 32, makes the assessment possible. Theoretical calculations for induction charging of liquid jets have shown that provided liquids have a conductivity value higher than the critical value, s = - 10 4 S/m, then they can be charged satisfactorily by the induction charging method. Among all of the influencing parameters, the electrical and mechanical parameters determine the charging rate and the water spray charge level. The suitability of employing these two charging mechanisms to dust suppression in coal mine has been evaluated based on the spray charge level, safety issues and the simplicity or otherwise of the equipment. The induction charging method was considered to have advantages over its corona charging counterpart, and has been chosen for charging the water sprays in the experiment program. Water has a conductivity of s = - 10 2 S/m, higher than the critical value, s = - 10 4 S/m. Based upon theoretical considerations, it is concluded that water is an appropriate liquid for corona charging, based on its dielectric constant, and for induction charging, based on its conductivity. In order to facilitate the testing of electrostatically charged water spray cloud parameters, a spray charger/collector was designed and constructed by others and a computerised data acquisition system has been employed. According to the theory developed for induction charging, the optimum length of the charging electrode has been analysed based upon the assumption that water jet is first charged and then the charged jet is disintegrated into charged droplets by the high pressure air. An experimental program examined the dependence of spray current upon four parameters: air flowrate, water flowrate, applied voltage and jet diameter. The experiments have shown that the induction-charged air-atomising nozzle used in the experiment is able to impart a significant charge into the water sprays. The spray charge-to-mass ratio calculated based upon the measured spray current demonstrates the same characteristics as predicted by theory: increasing with air flowrate, decreasing with water flowrate, increasing with applied voltage to a peak value then decreasing with further increase in the voltage, and increasing with jet diameter. A successful interpretation of an important phenomenon in the inductioncharged air-atomising a water jet, that spray charge-to-mass ratio and spray current increase with air pressure (or air flowrate) and decrease with increasing water flowrate, has been achieved based on the theories developed in this thesis. This phenomenon occurs because increasing air flowrate and/or decreasing water flowrate leads to a higher velocity of jet flowing through the induction electrode. However, when water flowrate becomes very small, a decrease in spray current with increasing air pressure (or flowrate) may be caused both by jet breakup inside the electrode and by contraction of the jet. In order to verify the theory, a preliminary comparison of experimental data with theoretical predictions employing a constant kic in the air-jet interaction coefficient a which was assumed to be 0. 7 has shown a general agreement. However, the value of kic appears to be related to jet diameter, air/water mass ratio and applied voltage. An empirical equation for kic has then been formulated based on the experimental data for the spray charge-to-mass ratio. Finally a comparison of experimental results with theoretical predictions using the formulated kic shows an improved agreement. It is concluded that the induction-charged air-atomising nozzle has a potential application in dust suppression in coal mines, as the voltage required to charge water sprays is only 1000 ~ 1200 volts, and that the theory developed for induction charging of water sprays can be used to guide laboratory investigations and design processes for dust suppression and other industrial applications which might employ the electrostatic charging of liquid sprays...|$|E

Dropsize data were obtained for the following atomizing-gases: nitrogen; argon; carbon dioxide; and helium. They were selected to cover a gas molecular-weight range of 4 to 44. Atomizing-gas mass-flux ranged from 6 to 50 g/sq cm-sec and four differently sized two-fluid fuel nozzles were used having orifice diameters that varied from 0. 32 to 0. 56 cm. The ratio of liquid-jet diameter to SMD, D sub o/D sub 32, was correlated with aerodynamic and liquid-surface forces based on the product of the Weber and Reynolds number, and gas-to-liquid density ratio, rho sub g/rho sub 1. To correlate spray dropsize with breakup forces produced by using different atomizing-gases, a new molecular-scale dimensionless group was derived. The derived dimensionless group was used to obtain an expression for the ratio of liquid-jet diameter to SMD, D sub o/D sub 32. The mathematical expression of this phenomenon incorporates the product of the Weber and Reynolds number, liquid viscosity, surface tension, acoustic gas velocity, the RMS velocity of gas molecules, the acceleration of gas molecules due to gravity, and gas viscosity. The mathematical expression encompassing these parameters agrees well with the atomization theory for liquid-jet breakup in high velocity gas flow.

40|$|A {{fluidized}} bed gasification (FBG) pilot plant {{was designed and}} constructed at the University of Saskatchewan Chemical Engineering Department Fluidization Laboratory. FBG is a thermo-chemical method for converting solid biomass to a gaseous fuel, termed syngas. Several instrumentation and control issues were particularly challenging with this pilot plant, including development of the fuel feeding system, pressure measurement of high temperature fluids, and metering of steam as a process reactant. The fuel feeding system was tested using MBM (meat and bone meal) to determine the output rate stability, and predictability and measurability of the system as the components in the fuel feeding system were integrated. The fuel feeding system that was tested included a 150 mm primary metering screw conveyor, a 150 mm rotary airlock, and a 50 mm secondary injection screw conveyor. Each component of the system was fitted with a 3 -phase electric motor and a variable speed drive {{to allow for a}} variable output rate. The weighing system that was integral to the metering conveyor was tested as well, but upon pressurizing the metering conveyor and hopper, the weighing system sustained an unreasonable amount of noise. Integrating a <b>pneumatic</b> injection <b>nozzle</b> with the injection conveyor was found to work effectively both under ambient temperatures and hot FBG conditions up to 725 oC. Above 725 oC, {{it was found that the}} test fuel would char and coat the nozzle, causing it to plug. Testing of the feeding system with the injection nozzle removed illustrated that the system could work well without it. It was determined that the injection conveyor speed to metering conveyor speed ratio that should be used for this system was 1 : 110 for absolute rotational speeds, or 1 : 1 of the full conveyor speeds. The complete system, including the injection nozzle, was analyzed and determined to produce a fuel output rate (FS) for % speeds from 5 - 25 %, which roughly corresponded to the desired plant fuel feed rate of 1 - 5 g/s. Techniques for remote pressure measurement of {{fluidized bed}}s were examined as well, including the use of long tubes to cool hot gases and filters for blocking solid particles. The pressure measurement delay of these techniques was examined in comparison to a direct local measurement. This was conducted by comparing the pressure readings from two identical sensors; one mounted directly to a manifold, and the other mounted via a variable assembly (comprised of a variable length of 6. 35 mm (1 / 4 ") PE tubing and a porous plate filter). Assemblies without a porous plate were found to have a minimal delay of up to 0. 303 seconds for 30 m length of PE impulse tubing. More significant delays were found for systems using both a 10 media grade porous plate filter and impulse tubing; a 3 m tube length with filter has a delay of up to 0. 221 s, and a 30 m impulse tube combined with the filter has a measurement delay of up to 1. 915 s, a significant delay in cases where high-frequency analysis of pressure is used for bed agglomeration prediction, or systems where fast response is required to changing pressure conditions. Additionally, a steam flow measurement system using an orifice plate and differential pressure sensor was installed and calibrated. By collecting time-based steam samples and process data, the physical system coefficients were determined for this system, allowing for steam flow measurement, accurate within 5 % over a flow range of 0. 5 to 2. 0 g/s...|$|R
