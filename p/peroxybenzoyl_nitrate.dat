40|$|An {{experimental}} {{investigation of}} the gas-phase photooxidation of toluene–NO_x–air mixtures at part-per-million concentrations {{has been carried out}} in a 65 -m^ 3, outdoor smog chamber to assess our understanding of the atmospheric chemistry of toluene. In addition, six CO-NO_x–air irradiations were conducted to characterize the chamber with regard to any wall radical sources. Measured parameters in the toluene–NO_x experiments included O_ 3, NO, NO_ 2, HNO_ 3, peroxyacetyl nitrate (PAN), CO, toluene, benzaldehyde, o-cresol, m-nitrotoluene, <b>peroxybenzoyl</b> <b>nitrate</b> (PBZN), temperature, relative humidity, aerosol size distributions, and particulate organic carbon. Predictions of the reaction mechanism of Leone and Seinfeld [7] are found to be in good agreement with the data under a variety of initial conditions. Additional simulations are used to investigate various mechanistic pathways in areas where our understanding of toluene chemistry is still incomplete...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a detailed laboratory characterization of a thermal dissociation chemical ionization mass spectrometer (TD-CIMS) for the atmospheric measurement of Peroxyacetyl nitrate (PAN) and its homologues (PANs). PANs are efficiently dissociated {{in a heated}} inlet and the resulting peroxy acyl radicals are reacted with I&minus; ions in a flow tube. The mass spectrometer detects the corresponding carboxylate ions. PAN, peroxypropionyl nitrate (PPN), peroxyisobutyryl nitrate (PiBN), peroxy-n-butyryl nitrate (PnBN), peroxyacryloyl nitrate (APAN), peroxycrotonyl nitrates (CPAN) and peroxymethacryloyl nitrate (MPAN) were cross-calibrated with both a dual channel GC/ECD and a total odd-nitrogen (NOy) instrument for the NCAR TD-CIMS' typical aircraft operation conditions. In addition, the instrument sensitivity {{to a number of}} more exotic PANs (peroxyhydroxyacetyl nitrate, methoxyformyl peroxynitrate, and <b>peroxybenzoyl</b> <b>nitrate)</b> was evaluated qualitatively by comparisons with a long-path FTIR instrument. The sensitivity for PPN is slightly higher than that of PAN. Larger aliphatic and olefinic PAN compounds generally showed lower sensitivities. We postulate that these differences are owing to secondary reactions in the thermal decomposition region, which either reduce the yield of peroxy acyl radicals or cause losses of these radicals through intramolecular decomposition. The relative importance of these secondary reactions varies considerably between different PAN species. Results also indicate that the reaction of the larger peroxy acyl radicals with the ion-water cluster, I&minus;(H 2 O) n proceeds about an order of magnitude faster than with I&minus; alone, as has been observed for peroxy acetyl radicals. Sensitivity variations among the individual PAN species at very low water vapor were observed. The results call for careful evaluation of each PAN species to be measured and for each desired operating condition of a TD-CIMS instrument...|$|E
40|$|Environmental chamber {{experiments}} and computer model calculations {{were conducted to}} assess the impacts of the gas-phase reactions of styrene on the atmospheric formation of ozone and styrene's known oxidation products. The experiments consisted of determining the effects of adding styrene on ozone formation, NO oxidation, integrated OH radical levels, and formation of benzaldehyde, formaldehyde, and <b>peroxybenzoyl</b> <b>nitrate</b> (PBzN) in various simulated photochemical smog systems in a dual ~ 2500 -liter, xenonarc -irradiated Teflon environmental chamber. The gas-phase mechanism for the atmospheric reactions of styrene was updated based on available literature data, and model predictions using the mechanism were compared {{with the results of}} the chamber experiments. The model predictions were consistent with the observed effects of styrene on benzaldehyde and formaldehyde and not inconsistent with the qualitative PBzN data, but the effect of styrene on radical levels and ozone could only be simulated if it was assumed that the reaction of styrene with ozone does not result in radical formation. The mechanisms which fit the chamber data was used to used to predict the impacts of styrene on ozone formation under various atmospheric conditions. The changes to the ozone + styrene mechanism caused the Maximum Incremental Reactivity (MIR) for styrene, relative to the average of all VOC emissions, to decrease from ~ 0. 7 to ~ 0. 6, on a mass basis. Uncertainties in the mechanism for the styrene + NO reactions were found not to significantly impact 3 ambient ozone impact predictions. The impact of styrene on ozone formation depended significantly on NO x conditions, being greater than that of ethane (but less than the average of all emissions on a mass basis and therefore not "highly react [...] ...|$|E
