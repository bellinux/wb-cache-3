5|$|Lithuania was {{increasingly}} {{threatened by the}} growing power of the Grand Duchy of Moscow in the 15th and 16th centuries. Moscow indeed took over many of Lithuania's eastern possessions in military campaigns of 1471, 1492, and 1500. Grand Duke Alexander of Lithuania was elected King of Poland in 1501, {{after the death of}} John Albert. In 1506, he was succeeded by Sigismund I the Old (Zygmunt I Stary) in both Poland and Lithuania as <b>political</b> <b>realities</b> were drawing the two states closer together. Prior to his accession to the Polish throne, Sigismund had been a Duke of Silesia by the authority of his brother Vladislas II of Bohemia, but like other Jagiellon rulers before him, he did not pursue the claim of the Polish Crown to Silesia.|$|E
5|$|Though the French {{presented}} {{themselves as}} liberators, they behaved like conquerors. After acrimonious {{negotiations between the}} representatives of the new Batavian Republic and those of the French Republic, a harsh Treaty of The Hague was concluded on 16 May 1795. Apart from imposing territorial concessions and a huge indemnity, this obligated the Dutch to maintain a French army of occupation of 25,000 men. This changed the Dutch republic from a client state of England and Prussia into a French one; henceforth it would conduct a foreign and military policy dictated by France, where its predecessor had followed British dictates since 1787 (an offensive and defensive alliance of the two republics was part of the treaty), while its economic policies would in effect also be made subservient to the interests of France. However, this did not mean that it lost its independence in all respects. The program of reform that the Dutch revolutionaries attempted to put in place (however constrained by the <b>political</b> <b>realities</b> of the French revolution as this was to progress) was mostly driven by indigenous needs and aspirations. The political events in the Netherlands were mainly derived from Dutch initiative, with some notable exceptions. The French were responsible for {{at least one of the}} coups d'état, and the French ambassador often acted as a proconsul.|$|E
5|$|Aside from non-military {{problems}} facing the junta, it also came into conflict with the Americans over political strategy, most notably as to whether armed force or politics should {{be the focus of}} efforts to end the communist threat to South Vietnam. Minh, the leading generals and Tho, favored a politically oriented solution, feeling that the deposal of Diệm and Nhu had created new possibilities for ending the insurgency of the National Liberation Front, or Viet Cong, mainly through an outreach program. They thought that military force would not be sufficient for Saigon, and that political means were more effective than using American firepower in making up for this. To the junta leaders, the rapid growth of the insurgency in Diệm's final year was due to it being seen as a rallying point and symbol of opposition to Diệm and Nhu, rather than an endorsement of the communists. The senior junta generals believed that with the Ngô brothers dead, the insurgency was now without its major focus of opposition, and therefore, motivation to operate in a vigorous way. To them, most of the insurgents were non-communist, with heavy elements of Cao Đài and Hòa Hảo religious sects or other opposition that had joined because of passionate anti-Diệm sentiment. Minh thus saw the post-Diệm period as an opportunity for grassroots political strengthening to undercut the NLF support base and force the remainder to integrate into mainstream society due to <b>political</b> <b>realities.</b>|$|E

25|$|In the {{aftermath}} of World War II, the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia (KSČ) was in a favourable position. Its powerful influence on Czechoslovak politics since the 1920s, its clean wartime record and cooperation with non-Communist parties, its identification with the Soviet Union, one of the country's liberators, and its determination to become the country's leading political force without alarming the West (a strategy followed too by Communist parties in Italy and France) dovetailed with popular opposition to Nazi rule, the longing for real change that followed it, and the new <b>political</b> <b>realities</b> of living within the Soviet orbit to produce a surge in membership from 40,000 in 1945 to 1.35 million in 1948.|$|E

40|$|The {{gap between}} the {{political}} trust levels of Anglo and African-American citizens {{represents one of the}} most clearly established characteristics of American political attitudes. The “political reality ” (or “political empowerment”) model has been used to explain this pattern. While empirical tests generally support the <b>political</b> <b>reality</b> model, few actually allow for much variation in the <b>political</b> <b>reality</b> facing citizens. The analysis presented here extends previous research on the <b>political</b> <b>reality</b> model and focuses on the ways in which collective descriptive representation differentially affects feelings of trust among Anglos and African-Americans. The {{results of this study suggest}} that while higher levels of African-American representation have important positive effects for African-American citizens and some negative impacts for Anglo citizens, political representation levels on par with minority proportions of the general population as a whole do not seem to boost feelings of political trust among the African-American community...|$|R

25|$|Soon, the PNL {{found itself}} {{threatened}} by the <b>political</b> <b>realities</b> of a Greater Romania. The policy of alliances of the Romanian National Party (a mainly Transylvanian group) had brought the rapid formation of the cabinet of Alexandru Vaida-Voevod in December 1919; this cabinet, and especially its Peasants' Party group, supported a radical version of the land reform, leading to endless debates in parliament. At the same time, the People's Party, a new and strong populist movement under General Averescu, had begun a campaign for both an urgent land reform and for bringing about the prosecution of PNL politicians as agents of the economic hardships. Faced with a choice, Brătianu approached Averescu and offered PNL support for a People's Party cabinet in return for moderation.|$|E

In the 2012 presidential elections, Alla Dzhioyeva, an opposition representative had victory snatched from {{her by the}} South Ossetian Supreme Court. This illustrated the region’s limited political autonomy, which was underlined by the unchallengeable presence of the Russian military. That court decision supported the contention that South Ossetia is a not a real state, but a Russian vassal. South Ossetia's borders are controlled by Russia. There is no South Ossetian foreign policy. South Ossetia {{does not have the}} functions of a state to provide for its citizens. There is little popular support for independence.|$|E

Kogălniceanu, a future Prime Minister of Romania, proposed that all orders of society be represented in the assembly, without calling for universal suffrage. Instead he proposed the creation of electoral college, giving the upper classes predominant power. Like most of his colleagues, he felt obliged to remain mindful of his era's social and <b>political</b> <b>realities</b> by recognizing the boyars continued leading role and limiting the participation of peasants due to their lack of education and experience.|$|E

40|$|The author {{reflects}} {{on the issue of}} epistemological limitations in the process of media imaginings of <b>political</b> <b>reality.</b> Using reference theory and description theory the author tries to answer the question of what makes up the image of <b>political</b> <b>reality</b> as verbalized in media coverage. His conclusion is that attempts to reflect the factual image in the media presentation of politics produce a specific politico-journalistic construction of this reality, the apparent re- ality. Therefore, the category of truth in media communications concerning the field of poli- tics usually fails. One should thus expect that this traditional realism, which is expressed on the one hand by the factual nature of the media, and on the other by the morality of the media, will constitute a pillar that supports the image of <b>political</b> <b>reality</b> that is presented, interpreted and commented on in the media. In principle, this should not be a naïve realism, giving prior- ity to individual cognitive spontaneity rather than to reflection, analysis and experience, or a spiritual realism seeking the truth about reality through human spirituality...|$|R

500|$|Once {{established}} at St. Botolph's Church in Boston, Cotton was not quick in learning the <b>political</b> <b>realities</b> of pacifying the bishops or manipulating their aides {{in order to}} be able to be an effective Puritan. The first Bishop of Lincoln under whom he worked, William Barlow, was critical of the parish for selecting Cotton as their preacher. [...] With this criticism Cotton was ready to return to the university; however, the bishop's constant business in London allowed Cotton to ultimately stay and preach in his somewhat non-conformist manner. [...] One great help to Cotton was the assistance of the great Puritan, John Preston, whose religious conversion was attributed to Cotton. [...] Preston had become a political force at Queen's College, and later the Master of Emmanuel, and held favor with the King. [...] In his collegiate roles, Preston sent a steady stream of students to live with and learn from Cotton, giving Cotton the epithet of [...] "Dr. Preston's seasoning vessel." ...|$|E

In 1936, Auden spent three months in Iceland where he gathered material for a travel book Letters from Iceland (1937), written in collaboration with Louis MacNeice. In 1937 he went to Spain intending to drive an ambulance for the Republic in the Spanish Civil War, but was put to work broadcasting propaganda, a job he left to visit the front. His seven-week visit to Spain affected him deeply, and his social views grew more complex as he found <b>political</b> <b>realities</b> to be more ambiguous and troubling than he had imagined. Again attempting to combine reportage and art, he and Isherwood spent six months in 1938 visiting China amid the Sino-Japanese War, working on their book Journey to a War (1939). On their way back to England they stayed briefly in New York and decided to move to the United States. Auden spent late 1938 partly in England, partly in Brussels.|$|E
