The pressing needs for us are to clarify the pathogenesis of diabetes and cure the patients. Technique of molecular biology has been utilized to clarify the pathogenesis of diabetes and the treatment of diabetes has been remarkably advanced. Recent advancements in the medical treatment are an establishment of patient education, teamwork system of medical staffs, and an improvement of medications e. g. insulin preparations, oral hypoglycemic agents, and eye treatment. <b>Pen-system</b> insulin supply is simple and handy even for the blind diabetics treated with insulin and an intensive insulin therapy capable of keeping a near normal metabolic control has become common by using the <b>pen-system.</b> The development of the oral diabetic agents was also advanced; a pill of alpha-glucosidase inhibitor was made with witching idea. Photocoagulation, which is the most advanced treatment among them, is necessary for the patients with proliferative diabetic retinopathy. In contrast with proliferative retinopathy, we have no way except keeping the good metabolic control to prevent diabetic nephropathy in spite of the severe increase of incidence of diabetic nephropathy...|$|E
