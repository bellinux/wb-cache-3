5|$|A {{technique}} for altering the natural progression of eruption is employed by orthodontists {{who wish to}} delay or speed up the eruption of certain teeth for reasons of space maintenance or otherwise preventing crowding and/or spacing. If a primary tooth is extracted before its succeeding <b>permanent</b> tooth's root reaches ⅓ of its total growth, the eruption of the <b>permanent</b> tooth will be delayed. Conversely, if {{the roots of the}} <b>permanent</b> tooth are more than ⅔ complete, the eruption of the <b>permanent</b> tooth will be accelerated. Between ⅓ and ⅔, it is unknown exactly what will occur to the speed of eruption.|$|E
5|$|In 1980, the Alaska Legislature {{created the}} Alaska <b>Permanent</b> Fund Corporation {{to manage the}} {{investments}} of the <b>Permanent</b> Fund, and it passed the <b>Permanent</b> Fund Dividend program, which provided for annual payments to Alaskans from the interest earned by the fund. After two years of legal arguments about who should be eligible for payments, the first checks were distributed to Alaskans. After peaking at more than $40 billion in 2007, the fund's value declined to approximately $26 billion as of summer 2009. In addition to the <b>Permanent</b> Fund, the state also maintains the Constitutional Budget Reserve, a separate savings account established in 1990 after a legal dispute over pipeline tariffs generated a one-time payment of more than $1.5 billion from the oil companies. The Constitutional Budget reserve is run similar to the <b>Permanent</b> Fund, but money from it can be withdrawn {{to pay for the}} state's annual budget, unlike the <b>Permanent</b> Fund.|$|E

China supported the stronger representation of developing countries, voicing support for India. Russia has also endorsed India's candidature for a <b>permanent</b> seat on the Security Council.|$|E
