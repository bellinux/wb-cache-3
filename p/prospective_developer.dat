40|$|Affective {{computing}} {{systems are}} software systems that take in account the emotional {{state of the}} user during their operation. Recently it is increasingly accepted that combining emotional with intellectual processing makes a system both more realistic and more intelligent. As such, affective computing systems are {{considered by many to}} represent the highest form of artificial intelligence and {{the state of the art}} in computer human interaction. A major difficulty in building an affective computing system is to identify what emotion attributes are most applicable for the development of the particular system that is under development. If such information is available then a system’s developer can build the sought system by using only the emotion attributes that are most influential for that type of system. In this work we present a method that addresses this problem. We describe our method and present an evaluation from its implementation and experiments with two different media collections. Our findings indicate that the method can successfully pinpoint to the most influential emotion attributes and thus allow the <b>prospective</b> <b>developer</b> to select the most applicable attributes for building a production-grade affective computing system...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Local {{bioenergy}} {{will play}} a crucial role in national and regional sustainable energy strategies. Effective siting and feedstock procurement strategies are critical to the development and implementation of bioenergy systems. This paper aims to improve spatial decision-support in this domain by shifting focus from homogenous (forestry or agricultural) regions toward heterogeneous regions—i. e., areas with a presence of both forestry and agricultural activities; in this case, eastern Ontario, Canada. Multiple land-cover and resource map series are integrated in order to produce a spatially distributed GIS-based model of resource availability. These data are soft-linked with spreadsheet-based linear models in order to estimate and compare the quantity and supply-cost of the full range of non-food bioenergy feedstock available to a <b>prospective</b> <b>developer,</b> and to assess the merits of a mixed feedstock stream relative to a homogenous feedstock stream. The method is applied to estimate bioenergy production potentials and biomass supply-cost curves for a number of cities in the study region.

40|$|A {{community}} benefits agreement (CBA) is {{a private}} contract negotiated between a <b>prospective</b> <b>developer</b> and community representatives. In essence, the CBA specifies the benefits that the developer will provide to the community {{in exchange for the}} community 2 ̆ 7 s support, or quiet acquiescence, of its proposed development. The promise of community support may be especially useful to a developer seeking government subsidies or timely project approvals. The CBA is a relative newcomer to the toolbox of strategies that communities may utilize to ensure that development occurs consistent with the sometimes more narrow goals and desires of neighborhood residents, as opposed to the sometimes broader goals and desires of municipal and regional governing bodies. The CBA concept is still in its infancy. However, with only about ten years of experience with CBAs, a number of differences and similarities are emerging as case studies are developed and reviewed across the country. This article is intended to document a comprehensive review of major CBA processes in cities across the United States; some successful, some not so successful, and some still in the development stages to gain better insights into the legal, social, and political aspects of negotiating for social justice as part of the land development process...|$|E

40|$|Arsenic soil {{concentrations}} at {{many environmental}} investigation sites in Florida {{and other states}} have been reported above the current U. S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) soil screening level (0. 4 mg/kg) and above the recently modified (2005) Florida default residential exposure Soil Cleanup Target Level (SCTL) of 2. 1 mg/kg. At a site in west central Florida, arsenic soil concentrations were compiled site-wide during early routine sampling. In a state-specific 2001 study of background concentrations of arsenic in Florida soils, 27 out of the 51 counties that were evaluated contained arsenic soil concentrations above the EPA soil screening level. Ten out of the 51 counties that were evaluated had arsenic concentrations in soil regularly above the then-applicable residential exposure SCTL of 0. 8 mg/kg. That study also identified elevated arsenic concentrations above FDEP’s residential exposure SCTL in a geographic “belt” from Leon and Madison counties in NW Florida to Lee and Charlotte counties in SW Florida. This belt includes Hillsborough County, in which the Site is located. Based on a very extensive site database for surface and subsurface soil, {{it was concluded that}} the observed arsenic concentrations at the Site represent a naturally occurring condition (2. 4 mg/kg mean and 2. 8 mg/kg 95 % UCL drawn from over 2, 000 site soil samples). The close agreement between the mean and the 95 % UCL concentrations indicates a low degree of statistical variability across the Site, and is supportive of the conclusion that the observed distribution represents naturally occurring background. Further, while the 2. 8 mg/kg UCL exceeds the Florida default residential cleanup target of 2. 1 mg/kg, it does not represent a significantly increased human health risk (1. 3 x 10 - 6 excess lifetime cancer risk). While there was no regulatory involvement, preparation of the initial background survey, a site risk evaluation, and evaluations of local background arsenic concentrations allowed the Site owner and <b>prospective</b> <b>developer</b> to determine that the 340 acre site was suitable for residential improvement...|$|E
40|$|The {{case study}} {{is a part of}} the {{dissertation}} made to complete the Master of Business Administration in Project Management. Degree program in January 2009. The experimental study was performed in the north-western region of Sri Lanka, where it was identified sufficient wind potential resource is available for harnessing wind energy. Studies had been conducted in Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB) and National Renewable Energy Laboratory, USA (NREL) in 2000 and 2002 respectively to identify the feasibility of utility scale wind farms in the region. As a result of that NREL Wind Resource Assessment for Sri Lanka and Maldives completed in 2002. The Rural Electrification Unit of CEB also had conducted a site specific wind measurement study in 2000 and revealed the potential wind resource for a utility scale wind farms in the region in 2001. Also, Constraints for the Development of Wind Farms in Sri Lanka is a study conducted to simulate the grid behavior if the wind plants were connected in the north-western region. Another case study had been performed to select the suitable turbine type for the region. All these studies revealed that the utility scale wind farms are feasible in the region. The related literature review reveals the feasibility of utility scale wind farms in the region. The NREL, CEB and other studies; direct the potential developers to the identified regions for setting up the site specific wind measurement facilities, revealed the potential feasibility of grid connected wind farms and the acceptability of wind power to the grid. Also they discuss the limitation of the wind power input to the grid The experimental study conducted at Nirmalapura (Np) and Mullipuaram (Mp) area revealed that the wind speed in the Np is 7 m/s and the Wind Power Density (WPD) as 327 W/m 2. In Mp the two factors are 6. 8 m/s and the WPD 315 W/m 2. These results verify the technical feasibility of using IEC Class III wind turbines with large rotor diameters. for larger swipe area for capturing more energy passes through the rotor. These results have?. Jlreater chance of varying from one location to another in the same region. Hence, a site specific Wind Resource Assessment is a must to a potential wind site. It was also observed that the wind site classifications done by NREL study do not comply as it is. The Np region classified as Good - Class 4 site with 7 - 7. 5 m/s wind speed and 400 - 500 W/m 2 Wind Power Density. The experimental results show that the site is in 7 - 7. 5 m/s wind speed region and WPD of 300 - 400 W/m 2. The actual measured WPD seems lower compare to the NREL Classification. However, the Mp area is compatible with 6. 4 - 7 m/s and WPD of 300 - 400 W/m 2 wind class. Technical, social and commercial feasibilities for implementing utility scale wind farms also exist. There are capacity addition restrictions to the grid for technical reasons and it is a limitation for harnessing the potential wind resource in the region. the turbine technology must be optimized and select suitably for the wind regime. Dispite the issues due to coal power plant implementation in the region, people would welcome wind projects in to the region. This does not mean that there would not be any social resistance. Project mangers with good personal soft skills would require operating in the area. If not expert advice must be sorted. The present high cost of finance is causing projects to be more commercially riskier. However, intuitive funding methods would minimize the risks in expected returns. The project profitability is very sensitive to the currency risk in the country. Intensity of the risk is more in this industry due almost 60 % of the implementation cost goes with the equipment purchase. If the capital is drawn from foreign currencies, which is obviously required for equipment purchase, the exposure to the currency devaluation is high during repayment. One another sensitive factor, transportability of equipment, is much more feasible compared to any other wind resource areas due to geographic and infrastructure conditions Wind power is very sensitive to small variation of wind speed due to its cubic relationship to the out put power of the turbine. Hence site specific data analysis can not be ruled out to an acceptable feasibility of a project. Small variation in the wind speed will greatly affect the energy estimations hence the revenue calculations. Use of non site specific wind data for wind project evaluation is not acceptable for any <b>prospective</b> <b>developer.</b> Technical feasibility of wind projects are undoubted in the region if a comprehensive project financing plan is available...|$|E

40|$|Rapid {{growth in}} regions {{surrounding}} large metropolitan areas {{leads to the}} phenomenon of urban sprawl. In states like Michigan, land is being converted at a rate seven times greater than formerly used (and potentially contaminated) sites are being redeveloped. City governments now see these unused or abandoned areas as important assets in realizing the goal of urban revitalization. New legislation in Michigan provides economic (e. g., tax recapture) and legal (e. g., suspension of retroactive liability) incentives for local governments and <b>prospective</b> <b>developers</b> who are now seeking these brownfields instead of farmland and open space. To evaluate land use options with respect to brownfields inventory, characterization, and potential for redevelopment, both government and private decision-makers need access to information regarding land capability; development incentives; public goals, interests, and preferences; and environmental concerns such as site contamination and environmental quality. This paper discusses a decision support system that provides access to state, regional, and local geospatial databases, several informational and visualization tools, and assumptions useful in providing {{a better understanding of}} issues, options, and alternatives in redeveloping brownfields. The resultant decision support system is augmented by a unique GIS-based land use modeling application called Smart Places ® as an integrated expert system. The decision support system is being tested in a city- and county-level brownfield identification, screening, and marketing effort in Jackson County, Michigan. This project represents a testbed for decision makers and policy analysts at all levels of government to establish urban land use policy and development guidelines that may be applicable to related land use issues in a variety of urban and urbanizing settings. While this project was conducted in Michigan, the tools and procedures used are seen as readily adaptable to other locations...|$|R
40|$|Energy use and {{production}} have become highly salient within both {{national and international}} policy. This reflects an international recognition {{of the need to}} cut emissions in order to mitigate the threats of climate change. Within the UK there is significant policy support for renewable energy development generally, and wind power in particular. Nevertheless, the UK is not expected to meet its targets for renewable energy production. This is often portrayed as being the result of localised public opposition to particular proposed developments. However, this thesis challenges the notion that local objectors are powerful actors within renewable energy deployment. A detailed, multi-method case study of one planning application for a wind power development was conducted in order to explore how the planning process is experienced and perceived by various different actors involved (i. e. representatives of the developers, local objectors, local supporters). The findings refute the assertion that localised opposition presents significant obstacles for the development of renewable energy; they instead highlight the limited influence of objectors. In order to understand the many different forms of power which may be exercised the research employs Lukes’ three-dimensional view of power as a framework of how the concept is to be understood. Through this framework, the thesis does not only consider the power of objectors, but also of <b>prospective</b> <b>developers</b> and the forms of power that are found within the structures of the planning system. Power is considered to be visible not only in the outcomes of decision-making processes but also in the processes themselves. It is shown that whilst planning processes are presented as being public and democratic, considerable power is exercised in controlling the participation that is allowed and ultimately the range of outcomes which can be achieved. This research was funded by the Economic and Social Research Council in collaboration with Scottish and Southern Energy Plc...|$|R
