These materials characterisation techniques allow a complete analysis of the reference material in terms of mechanical behaviour, surface topography and thermally induced events during cure. The effect of cure level within the adhesive was explored by examining all the material properties {{as a function of}} <b>post</b> <b>cure</b> duration and temperature. <b>Post</b> <b>cure</b> temperature and duration were found to be directly proportional to the amount of curing reactions taking place within the system, with increases in <b>post</b> <b>cure</b> duration found to lower the temperatures required to cure to a specific level. The mechanical properties of the adhesive varied as a function of <b>post</b> <b>cure</b> harshness with a number of mechanisms conteributing to the strength during <b>post</b> <b>cure.</b> The elastic modulus of the material was found to decrease with increases in <b>post</b> <b>cure</b> temperature, more so than with increases in <b>post</b> <b>cure</b> duration.

As curing levels are increased the glass transition temperature increases until a point where the energy required to cause the transition falls and the Tg is lowered.

40|$|Abstract]: This project {{looks at}} the {{flexural}} and thermal properties of composites that have renewable resources as fillers and additives, {{there is also a}} comparison between different <b>post</b> <b>curing</b> techniques. The renewable resources that have been analysed are palm oil and sawdust and the <b>post</b> <b>curing</b> techniques are conventionally and with a microwave. Increasing pressure from environmental groups and the government have encouraged companies to investigate using renewable resources in all areas of their industry. This project investigates the relationships which renewable resources produce as a result of different amounts and sizes of fillers and additives. The three point loading test was used to measure the flexural properties, the Dynamic Mechanical Analysis (DMA) testing machine tested the thermal properties and the microscope was used to analyse the level of adhesion between fillers and epoxy. The results indicated that the plasticizing effect of the palm oil reduced the flexural stress and flexural modulus of the samples, while the strain increased with increasing amounts of palm oil. The flexural stress and flexural strain decreased with the increasing size of the sawdust particles, although the size of the sawdust particles had a minimal effect on the flexural modulus. The amount of sawdust added marginally reduced the peak flexural stress of the samples, and the strain and flexural modulus was not affected by increasing amounts of sawdust. The amount and size of sawdust particles, as well as amount of palm oil does not affect the thermal properties of the epoxy composite. The only significant difference between samples is the affect the <b>post</b> <b>curing</b> technique: conventional <b>post</b> <b>cured</b> samples exhibited a higher glass transition temperature. In terms of flexural and thermal properties, natural fillers and additives represent an alternative to traditional fillers and additives, although there is a large amount of study {{that can be done to}} further improve the results. This research provides the basis for future study into the manufacturing and use of renewable fillers and additives in composites...|$|R
40|$|The complex sand cores and moulds for {{prototype}} sand, castings {{produced by}} Selective Laser Sintering (SLS), result fragile {{once they are}} removed from the supporting uncured sand. Therefore, they require <b>Post</b> <b>Curing</b> to become dimensionally stable and capable of successfully undergoing {{the rigors of the}} metal casting process. In this paper the effects of <b>post</b> <b>curing</b> process parameters on the performances of sand parts produce by SLS are investigated. The sand characteristics and <b>Post</b> <b>Curing</b> parameters choice must take into account the presence of two antagonistic needs: the decrease of gas production during the casting decreasing the presence of volatile components of the binder, and the improvement of the mechanical performances increasing the binder weight percentage (Subramanian K. & Al, 1995,). Three different phenolic resin coated sands were investigated: 1) silica SiO 2; 2) synthetic mullite 3 Al 2 O 32 SiO 2; 3) synthetic mullite + SiO 2. The compressive strength of the sand specimen was reported VS time and temperature post process parameters. Increasing curing temperature and time, the mechanical performances improve up to a maximum value than decrease. A benchmark was defined and used to evaluate the post process parameters influence on dimensional and shape tolerance. The mechanical behaviour of a part reflects the micro joining mechanisms between the particles a model is proposed to understand how the <b>post</b> <b>curing</b> parameters can influence the performances of the SLS products.
