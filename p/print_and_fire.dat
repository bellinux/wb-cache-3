Thereby, the in-situ contact resistance curves of glass-containing silver metallization could be assigned to microstructural phenomena such glass melting, silver solution, ARC etching and silver precipitation.

40|$|The {{evolution}} of microstructure and electrical properties of silver-based thick-film metallizations of silicon solar cells prepared by infrared firing processes has been investigated.

The existance of an optimum value of the peak firing temperature is observed and explained in terms of competitive phenomena occurring at the metal/silicon interface.

In addition, the magnetoresistive responses of the layers and the sheet were plotted. These data suggest that strains, pores and lack of composition homogeneity in the films concur in affecting their magnetic properties, and are responsible for their reduced magnetoresistance anisotropy (e. g. ca. 4 % for films as compared to ca. 8 % for the bulk alloy at H = 80 kA/m).

The viscosity of the paste glass showed decisive influence for the etching of the anti-reflection coating (ARC). The ARC was opened immediately after entering the softening range of the respective glass, regardless of large differences in glass chemistry. Furthermore, the viscosity-temperature behaviour of the paste glass determines the intensity of the redox-reaction and related silver precipitation at the interface, which takes part between ARC opening and glass resolidification.

40|$|Alloying from {{screen-printed}} aluminum pastes on silicon is a simple, {{reliable and}} cost-effective metallization technique, which is standardly {{applied for the}} rear contact formation of silicon solar cells in today’s production lines. Despite its long history and widespread utilization, however, there have still been open questions on the fundamentals of the alloying process, on the interaction of paste additives with the Al-Si system during alloying, and on the recombination characteristics of Al-alloyed contacts. This work has therefore dealt with investigating and quantifying alloying from screen-printed Al pastes on Si for solar cell applications in detail. The main achievements of this work are summarized in brief in the following: (1) Derivation of a comprehensive analytical model for alloying from screen-printed Al pastes which allows for the accurate calculation of the Al contact structure and the doping profiles of the Al-doped p+ Si (Al-p+) regions for {{a broad range of}} <b>printing</b> <b>and</b> <b>firing</b> conditions. (see chapter 2) (2) Detailed theoretical and experimental investigation of the recombination characteristics of Al-p+ regions with and without surface passivation. The influence of the <b>printing</b> <b>and</b> <b>firing</b> conditions on the recombination characteristics of the Al-p+ regions has been clarified and optimal conditions have been determined. Implied open-circuit voltages of up to 651 mV for non-passivated and 699 mV for surface-passivated Al-p+ regions have been realized. (see chapter 3) (3) Deduction of a comprehensive analytical model for alloying from screen-printed Al pastes containing boron additives. This model enables the precise calculation of the acceptor profiles of the Al- and B-co-doped p+ Si (Al-B-p+) regions and the investigation and optimization of their recombination characteristics. Excellent implied open-circuit voltages of 665 mV have been achieved for full-area Al-B-p+ regions without surface passivation for the optimal effective B percentage of 0. 03 wt%. (see chapter 4) (4) Investigation of the structural and electrical properties of local contacts formed by full-area screen-printing <b>and</b> <b>firing</b> of Al pastes on locally opened dielectric layers. By intentionally adding Si to the Al paste, the recombination characteristics of the local contacts were improved, so that the effective rear surface recombination velocity was reduced down to {{less than a third of}} the value of a conventional Al paste. (see chapter 5) (5) Application of these results to improve the conversion efficiencies of n-type Si solar cells with screen-printed full-area or local Al-p+ rear emitters. Nickel plating has been demonstrated to be a promising technique for the front contact formation of these solar cells. Etching of highly phosphorus-doped n+ Si regions was implemented as an industrially feasible approach for the formation of the n+ front surface fields.

While the improved potential barrier predominates for Tpeak,eff ≲ 770 °C, the increased defect density prevails for Tpeak,eff ≲ 800 °C, thus defining an optimal effective peak temperature.

Phase relations in the pseudoternary system $NiO-PbO-TiO_ 2 $ and quaternary $Ni-Pb-NiTiO_ 3 -PbTiO_ 3 $ were explored by equilibrating compacted mixtures of component oxides and/or metals in air and prepurified Ar gas.
