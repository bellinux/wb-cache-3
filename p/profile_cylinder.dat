40|$|The decay {{rates of}} {{stresses}} and displacements due to self-equilibrated loads {{acting on the}} end of angle-ply laminated hollow cylinders are found by using the theory of three-dimensional elasticity. The study assumes that the periodic displacement and stress fields used decay away exponentially from the end load region. The use of a recursive and successive approximation method leads to an eigenmatrix whose eigenvalues represent the decay rates of the problem. By this approach, the composite cylinders may be composed of an arbitrary number of anisotropic layers, each of which may have different material properties, thicknesses and lamination profiles. The decay rates for anti-symmetrically laminated cylinders are found and presented.

The present study is bound to a process of joining of two bimetallic axisymmetric components from various materials by upsetting bimetallic components in a closed die.

40|$|The {{scattering}} {{of a plane}} electromagnetic wave by perfectly conducting or dielectric cylinders {{has been the focus}} of numerous investigations for the past few decades. The motive is the enormous number of practical applications in optics, acoustics and electromagnetics [1]. This particular study was inspired by work to analyze electromagnetic scattering from the blades of wind turbines. The customary way to tackle this problem is to use one of the many numerical approaches to calculate the distribution of the surface current density (SCD) at the surface of an infinite cylinder, and then to assume that for high aspect ratio, (where l is the length of the cylinder and a is a characteristic size of its arbitrary cross-section) one can approximate the SCD of the highly elongated cylinder by the solution for the two-dimensional case [2]. In most cases is assumed that a does not exceed a wavelength. The enforcement of the rigorous Method of Regularization [3] to the 2 -D scattering problem for an arbitrary <b>profiled</b> metallic <b>cylinder</b> enables us to overcome these shortcomings and to extend dramatically the size of the cross-section up to several hundred wavelengths.

A detailed analysis, including higher order terms, has been made of the flat plate wake with a Blasius profile at the trailing edge. The same method yields, as a special case, complete results for the development of linearized wakes with arbitrary initial profile under the influence of arbitrary pressure gradients.
