5|$|Bart and Milhouse torment {{a tourist}} named Howell Huser (a parody of {{television}} personality Huell Howser), who is then chased {{out of town}} by bullies Dolph, Jimbo, and Kearney. Huser is later revealed to be a media personality, and he appears on a network's morning television show warning tourists against visiting Springfield and giving it his lowest rating for any American location (six out of ten). The Springfield tourism business collapses and Mayor Quimby holds an emergency meeting at the town hall. After many senseless suggestions, Lisa suggests that Springfield legalize same-sex marriage to entice visitors to their town. All of Springfield happily agrees with Lisa's idea, even Marge. The town makes a commercial that is broadcast throughout America, convincing <b>people</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> Springfield.|$|E
5|$|When Harding {{ran for the}} Republican {{nomination}} for president in 1920 he was considered a long shot until after the convention began. Then the leading candidates, such as General Leonard Wood, could not gain the needed majority, and the convention deadlocked. Harding's support gradually grew until he was nominated on the 10th ballot. He conducted a front porch campaign, remaining {{for the most part}} in Marion and allowing the <b>people</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> him. He won in a landslide over Democrat James M. Cox and Socialist Party candidate Eugene Debs, running on a theme of return to normalcy and becoming the first sitting senator to be elected president.|$|E
25|$|Over {{the next}} twenty years, {{patterns}} of immigration continued to change. The government encouraged more <b>people</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> Australia and many more assisted agreements were made with countries. In the late 1950s, more immigrants began to be accepted from the Middle East. In 1958, under the Migration Act 1958, the dictation test was removed and a new universal visa scheme or entry permits introduced. This allowed non-Europeans to immigrate. Their entry was now {{based on what they}} could contribute to Australia and if it could be shown that they could integrate into Australian society. This attracted many professionals and highly qualified people who added to Australia's relatively small tertiary industry.|$|E

25|$|Reacting to {{the human}} rights trials, hardliners in the Argentine army staged a series of uprisings against the Alfonsín government. They barricaded {{themselves}} in several military barracks demanding an end of the trials. During Holy Week (Semana Santa) of April 1987, Lieutenant-Colonel Aldo Rico (commander of the 18th Infantry Regiment in Misiones province) and several junior army officers, barricaded themselves in the Campo de Mayo army barracks. The military rebels, who were called the carapintadas, {{called for an end}} to the trials and the resignation of army chief of staff General Héctor Ríos Ereñú. Rico believed that the Alfonsin government would be unwilling or unable to put down the uprising. He was correct, as the Second Army Corps commander's orders to surround the barracks were ignored by his subordinates. Alfonsin called on the <b>people</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> the Plaza de Mayo to defend democracy, and hundreds of thousands responded.|$|E
25|$|At {{times it}} would be {{necessary}} to summon <b>people</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> the mote for judgement, proclamations, gatherings, etc. This was sometimes done by ringing a bell, which was fitted upon or beside the moot hill, especially when a date for the meeting had not been previously set. At Greenhills near Barrmill in North Ayrshire a different method {{is said to have been}} employed, namely that of raising a flag at the Bore stone; a prominent site near the moot hill. It is likely that bonfires would have been lit as a signal, either from the smoke during the day or the light at night. A 'Bonfire hill' place name survives at Stewarton in East Ayrshire and a 'Bonfire knowe' is recorded at Kilmarnock. The Tarbolton moot was still used for lighting bonfires up until the 19th-century at least and the name Shinny Hill is suggestive of traditional bonfires; a 'Shinicle' being a halloween bonfire.|$|E
25|$|The police {{plan was}} to move in at midnight on September 14 and evict the house while the squatters were still in their beds. In past evictions, the police did not assault a house until long after {{the moment of the}} deadline, and the hope was to take the squatters by {{surprise}} and minimize the time available for them to prepare their defense. A couple of days before the eviction was to take place, posters were hung up all over the city. The posters invited <b>people</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> a demonstration in support of the house. The poster showed a large image of a burning car and the text said {{that it was a good}} idea to show up with your face masked. This did raise some eyebrows at police headquarters, but in the end the police estimated that it was just a coincidence and that nothing big was underway. The police also thought that since the demonstration was held at 10:00 pm on a Sunday, not many people would attend.|$|E

Her disruptive behavior appalled Fred Gwynn, a new O.T.O. member living in the commune at 1003 South Orange Grove Avenue: [...] "Betty went to almost fantastical lengths to disrupt the meetings [...] that Jack did get together. If she could not break it up by making social engagements with key personnel she, and her gang, would go out to a bar and keep calling in asking for certain <b>people</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> the telephone." ...|$|E
500|$|In Sweden, the Småland city of Växjö {{is home to}} the Swedish Emigrant Institute (Svenska Emigrantinstitutet), {{founded in}} 1965 [...] "to {{preserve}} records, interviews, and memorabilia relating to the period of major Swedish emigration between 1846 and 1930". The House of the Emigrants (Emigranternas Hus) was founded in Gothenburg, the main port for Swedish emigrants, in 2004. The centre shows exhibitions on migration and has a research hall for genealogy. In the U.S., there are hundreds of active Swedish-American organizations , for which the Swedish Council of America functions as an umbrella group. There are Swedish-American museums in Philadelphia, Chicago, Minneapolis, and Seattle. Rural cemeteries such as the Moline Swedish Lutheran Cemetery in central Texas also serve as a valuable record of the first Swedish <b>people</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> America.|$|E
500|$|Bryan's {{campaign}} had at most an estimated $500,000. With his eloquence and youthful energy his major {{assets in the}} race, Bryan decided on a whistle-stop political tour by train on an unprecedented scale. Hanna urged McKinley to match Bryan's tour {{with one of his}} own; the candidate declined {{on the grounds that the}} Democrat was a better stump speaker: [...] "I might just as well set up a trapeze on my front lawn and compete with some professional athlete as go out speaking against Bryan. I have to think when I speak." [...] Instead of going to the people, McKinley would remain at home in Canton and allow the <b>people</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> him; according to historian R. Hal Williams in his book on the 1896 election, [...] "it was, as it turned out, a brilliant strategy. McKinley's 'Front Porch Campaign' became a legend in American political history." ...|$|E

500|$|According to Horner, [...] "In 1896, as {{the country}} was mired in an {{economic}} slowdown that affected millions, a real, substantive policy debate was conducted by candidates who believed firmly in their respective positions." [...] Bryan, whose campaign was ill-financed, felt that his best means of persuading the voter of his position was personal communication, and embarked on an unprecedented itinerary of whistle stop appearances by train. [...] If the train passed any large group of homes and did not stop for Bryan to speak, it would at least disgorge a bundle of political tracts for local distribution. [...] McKinley felt he could not match Bryan's speaking tour, as the Democrat was a better stump speaker. [...] Despite Hanna's urgings to the candidate {{to get on the}} road, the former governor decided on a front porch campaign; he would remain at home in Canton and allow the <b>people</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> him. [...] As McKinley's wife, Ida, was an invalid, this also boosted his image as a good husband.|$|E
500|$|After Maxwell's Urban Hang Suite was completed, the {{finished}} recordings {{were presented to}} Columbia Records in mid 1995. It was shelved for nearly a year, because of issues with Columbia's management, the label's extensive reorganization, and record executives' doubts regarding the album's commercial potential. The marketplace dominance of hip hop soul in 1995 was in contrast with Maxwell's monogamous themes and older soul influences, which Columbia worried would be interpreted as old-fashioned. The label's executives also feared that his romantic concept and image would not appeal to listeners. Maxwell made matters worse by refusing to allow his picture {{to be placed on}} the album's front cover; instead he preferred to have the track listing and other information he felt was more important about the album in place of his photo. Regarding the cover, Maxwell later said [...] "I wanted people to have the facts: the title, the selections {{and the fact that you}} had to basically buy it. I wanted <b>people</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> the music and not base any opinion on the image". Columbia reached a compromise with Maxwell and used a promotional shot of him as the back cover. The album's front cover art also features a picture of a pair of golden women's shoes on the floor of a hotel room, with the bar coding prominently displayed. In the period before its release, Maxwell wrote and demoed songs for a subsequent studio album, and embarked on an African American college tour with Groove Theory and the Fugees.|$|E
500|$|At {{the time}} of the {{formation}} of the new league in 2004, the club was owned by Spirits Sports and Leisure Group. The club announced its search for a star player under the league's allowance for one star player outside of the $1.5million salary cap, insisting that the player should not look at the position as a retirement fund. Coach Lawrie McKinna sought interest from Australia national football team players Ante Milicic and Simon Colosimo, and announced that he may sign more than the three under-20 players required by league rules. Early concerns for the club focussed on concerns over financial stability, but after forming a partnership with technology company Toshiba and a cash injection from local businessman John Singleton, the club's financial worries were eased. McKinna was keen to sign local player Damien Brown of Bateau Bay, formerly of the Newcastle Jets. In a decision which prompted the player to declare that he was [...] "over the moon", Brown became the first player to sign with the club. Club chairman Lyall Gorman was pleased that a local had become a [...] "foundation player" [...] and part of Brown's role would be to assist with selection of younger players from the local area. By early December 2004, the club had created a steady foundation of player signings and began negotiations with former Perth Glory striker Nik Mrdja, signing him later in the month as its star attacker. Mrjda {{was one of the most}} prominent players in the last season of the National Soccer League, scoring the final goal to secure Perth Glory's finals win. The club's management was reluctant to sign a star player outside of the $1.5million salary cap, stipulating that they [...] "would have to contribute on the pitch and get <b>people</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> the ground." ...|$|E
