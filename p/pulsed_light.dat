25|$|Dermatological {{vascular}} laser (single wavelength) or intense <b>pulsed</b> <b>light</b> (broad spectrum) machines {{offer one}} of the treatments for rosacea, in particular the erythema (redness) of the skin. They use light to penetrate the epidermis to target the capillaries in the dermis layer of the skin. The light is absorbed by oxyhemoglobin, which heats up, causing the capillary walls to heat up to 70°C (158°F), damaging them, and causing them to be absorbed by the body's natural defense mechanism. With {{a sufficient number of}} treatments, this method may even eliminate the redness altogether, though additional periodic treatments will likely be necessary to remove newly formed capillaries.|$|E

The authors described use of the device to decrease discomfort before procedures including supplementing anesthesia with the injection of triamcinolone acetonide into the proximal nail fold for psoriasis, decreasing discomfort during a Restylane injection of the nasolabial fold, making an intense <b>pulsed</b> <b>light</b> (IPL) facial treatment easier by reducing pain during the procedure, and throughout axillary hyperhidrosis treatment with botulinum toxin.

40|$|ABSTRACT The {{effectiveness}} of <b>pulsed</b> UV <b>light</b> on the microbial load of boneless chicken breast was in-vestigated. Unpackaged and vacuum-packaged samples inoculated with an antibiotic-resistant strain of Salmo-nella Typhimurium {{on the top}} surfaces were treated with <b>pulsed</b> UV <b>light</b> for 5, 15, 30, 45, and 60 s at 5, 8, and 13 cm distance from the quartz window in the <b>pulsed</b> UV <b>light</b> chamber. The log 10 reductions of Sal-monella (cfu/cm 2) on unpackaged samples varied from 1. 2 to 2. 4 after a 5 -s treatment at 13 cm and a 60 -s treatment at 5 cm, respectively. The log 10 reductions on vacuum-packaged samples varied from 0. 8 to 2. 4 after the 5 -s treatment at 13 cm and the 60 -s treat-ment at 5 cm, respectively. The optimum treatment conditions were determined to be 5 cm- 15 s for un-packaged samples and 5 cm- 30 s for vacuum-packaged samples, both of which resulted in about 2 log 10 re-duction (~ 99 %). The total energy and temperatures of samples increased with longer treatment time and shorter distance from the quartz window in the <b>pulsed</b> UV <b>light</b> chamber. The changes in chemical quality and color of samples were determined after mild (at 13 cm for 5 s), moderate (at 8 cm for 30 s), and extreme (at 5 cm for 60 s) treatments. Neither malonaldehyde con-tents nor color parameters changed significantly (P> 0. 05) after mild and moderate treatments. Mechanical properties of the packaging material were analyzed be-fore and after <b>pulsed</b> UV <b>light</b> treatments. The elastic modulus at both along-machine and perpendicular-to-machine direction and yield strength at perpendicular-to-machine direction changed significantly (P < 0. 05) after extreme treatment. Overall, these results clearly indicate that <b>pulsed</b> UV <b>light</b> has a potential {{to be used for}} decontamination of unpackaged and vacuum-packaged poultry.
