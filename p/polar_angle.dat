40|$|An {{experimental}} {{study was conducted}} on the noise characteristics of four-bladed general aviation propellers with uneven blade spacing. The subscale propeller designs were inspired by the fourbladed McCauley propellers used on the Beechcraft King Air 350 series aircraft. The 4 -inch diameter (1 : 22. 5 scale) propellers were manufactured using high-resolution stereolithography and were powered by a high performance, radio controlled brushless electric motor. Acoustic measurements were taken with a 24 -microphone array. The use of uneven blade spacing created additional tones over which the acoustic intensity was distributed. Large amounts of acoustic intensity were shifted into the lowest frequency tone (occuring at half of the blade passage frequency of the propeller with evenly spaced blades), resulting in reductions of A-weighted overall sound pressure levels of up to 5 dB for <b>polar</b> <b>angles</b> near 90. These reduction are partly offset by increases in A-weighted overall sound pressure levels of up to 4 dB at <b>polar</b> <b>angles</b> less than 50. Although the theory used to predict propeller noise does not show good agreement with experiments, it does show this trend of increasing noise at low <b>polar</b> <b>angles.</b> Since noise at low <b>polar</b> <b>angles</b> are weighted less in noise metrics such as flyover noise, the use of uneven blade spacing has potential for providing noise reduction without adding excessive complexity to propeller design...|$|R

40|$|Consider the American basket {{call option}} in the case where there are N {{underlying}} assets, the number of possible exercise times prior to maturity is finite, and the vector of N asset prices is modeled using a Levy process. A numerical method based on regression and numerical integration is proposed to estimate {{the price of the}} American option. In the proposed method, we first express the asset prices as nonlinear functions of N uncorrelated standard normal random variables. For a given set of time-t asset prices, we next determine the time-t continuation value by performing a numerical integration along the radial direction in the N-dimensional polar coordinate system for the N uncorrelated standard normal random variables, expressing the integrated value via a regression procedure {{as a function of the}} <b>polar</b> <b>angles,</b> and performing a numerical integration over the <b>polar</b> <b>angles.</b> The larger value of the continuation value and the time-t immediate exercise value will then be the option value. The time-t option values over the N-dimensional space may be represented by a quadratic function of the radial distance, with the coefficients of the quadratic function given by second degree polynomials in N- 1 <b>polar</b> <b>angles.</b> Partitioning the maturity time T into k* intervals of length Δt, we obtain the time-(k- 1) Δt option value from the time-kΔt option values for k= k*, k*- 1,…, 1.

It is found that the numerical results for the American option prices based on regression and numerical integration agree well with the simulation results, and exhibit a variation of the prices as we vary the non-normality of the underlying distributions of the assets. To assess the accuracy of the computed price we may use estimated standard error of the computed American option price. The standard error will help us gauge whether the number of selected points along the radial direction and the number of selected <b>polar</b> <b>angles</b> are large enough to achieve the required level of accuracy for the computed American option price...|$|R
