The service was launched on 26 July 2005 as Ireland's fourth mobile network operator behind Vodafone, O2 and Meteor. 3's coverage {{is made up}} of a single 2,100MHz band UMTS network, with claims of 96% population coverage and 500,000 subscribers. A roaming agreement with Vodafone provides GSM coverage where no UMTS signal is available. Service was initially offered as post-paid only, but on 16 May 2006 the introduction of a <b>pre-paid</b> <b>service,</b> known as 3Pay, was announced. A pre-paid mobile broadband service was launched on 29 February 2008 under the name 3Pay Broadband, with vouchers available for durations of one day, one week, or one month. On 13 May 2010, 3 Ireland announced the launch of the world's first commercial voice and data I-HSPA network. In July 2012, 3 Ireland announced a strategic partnership with Vodafone Ireland to share network infrastructure. This facilitated rapid rollout of 3 Ireland's 4G network, while also making it less costly. When a 3 user is using 2G or Edge connection, they are using Vodafone's 2G network, as 3 are a 3G/HSDPA network only.

25|$|Count 2: Modification of a {{revenue sharing}} {{agreement}} on <b>pre-paid</b> mobile <b>services.</b> Previously, telecom operators {{had to pay}} the TOT a percentage of their revenues for post-paid mobile <b>services.</b> To offer <b>pre-paid</b> <b>services,</b> which are generally cost less to the consumer, AIS negotiated with TOT to design a revenue sharing agreement for <b>pre-paid</b> <b>services</b> that offered less revenue to the TOT comprising an estimated loss of 14.2billion baht (revenue reduced from 25% to 20%) from 2001 to 2006 and another estimated loss of 56billion baht (revenue reduced from 30% to 20%) from 2006 to 2015. The judges ruled that {{the terms of the}} pre-paid agreement harmed TOT while benefiting AIS. The judges did not dispute the fact that TOT's total revenue actually increased substantially {{as a result of the}} agreement, but noted that the rise in pre-paid revenue came about while harming TOT's post-paid revenue. The massive growth in Thai mobile penetration from 13% in 2001 to 80% in 2007, due almost completely to <b>pre-paid</b> <b>services,</b> and the reduction in AIS market share from 68% to 53% in the same period were not taken into account by the court.|$|R

50|$|With premium SMS {{the price}} of the ticket can be added to the users mobile phone bill or debited from their <b>pre-paid</b> <b>service</b> using SMS billing. The main {{business}} limitation is that when premium SMS is used for billing, by default around 20-40% of the transaction value is retained by the mobile operator and sms aggregator. Normally, this would not be viable for low margin tickets, however, in many cases much more favourable commercial terms have been negotiated e.g. between the public transport organisations and mobile operators. Payments charged to payment cards require an initial registration to associate the user's mobile phone number to their credit card, but have a far more favorable fee structure for service providers.|$|E

40|$|The rapid {{diffusion}} of mobile telephony {{is an important}} subject in diffusion studies of innovation. This study attempts to learn how mobile telephony diffuses in China, which has the most mobile telephone subscribers worldwide, {{in terms of the}} appropriate growth model and forces driving the diffusion. To identify the appropriate growth model, this study compares the fitness and forecasting ability of three conventional models — the Logistic, Bass, and Gompertz models. The determinants of the diffusion rate are then analyzed based on the most appropriate model. Empirical results, based on data for mobile telephone subscribers in China for 1986 – 2007, indicate that the Gompertz model performs best. Moreover, the four determinants for the diffusion rate are: number of fixed-line telephone subscribers, the low cost of mobile handsets, <b>pre-paid</b> <b>service</b> and the personal handy-phone system (PHS) service.

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} {{a study of}} adoption determinants for mobile commerce, focusing on end-users of a mobile commerce <b>pre-paid</b> <b>service.</b> The main objective {{of the study is}} twofold; to identify end-user’s adoption determinants and increase the validity of an adoption model by applying it to the results of the study. In order to investigate the field of mobile commerce service adoption, information related to its’ end-users was gathered. The study is based on literature studies, service tests, open-ended interviews with experts within the field and marketing meetings at Telenor Mobil’s mobile commerce department as sources of input, influencing the design of the study. As a result, a case study was designed. A series of focused interviews and participant observations with end-users of the service, open-ended interviews with employees at Telenor Mobil’s mobile commerce department was performed, in addition to gathering of documents and archival records on end-users. To fully understand the adoption process of mobile commerce, Pedersen and Methlie [2002] suggest studying the mobile commerce service end-users in three context-dependent adoption perspectives. These perspectives view the individual as a technology end-user, a consumer and a network member. Each perspective is illustrated by a relevant model, consisting of {{a modified version of the}} decomposed theory of planned behaviour for the technology end-user, the customer life cycle model for the consumer and a social network analysis as a basis for the network member. Regarding Pedersen and Methlie’s framework as tentative, assuming that its uniformity and nature propositions were correct, the framework was applied to the results of the study in order to validate its concepts. The findings of the case study indicate strong support for triangulating the three perspectives suggested by Pedersen and Methlie [2002]. Many determinants were identified, the strongest based on experimental and instrumental motives. Timing of service exposure was also found important in influencing both initial and post-decisional phases of consumer adoption. Validity of the framework was supported...|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background Studies {{largely from}} the market {{research}} field suggest that {{the inclusion of a}} stamped addressed envelope, rather than a pre-paid business reply, increases the response rate to mail surveys. The evidence that this is also the case regarding patient mail surveys is limited. Methods The aim {{of this study is to}} investigate whether stamped addressed envelopes increase response rates to patient mail surveys compared to pre-paid business reply envelopes and compare the relative costs. A sample of 477 initial non-responders to a mail survey of patients attending breast clinics in Greater Manchester between 1 / 10 / 2002 – 31 / 7 / 2003 were entered into the trial: 239 were randomly allocated to receive a stamped envelope and 238 to receive a pre-paid envelope in with their reminder surveys. Overall cost and per item returned were calculated. Results The response to the stamped envelope group was 31. 8 % (95 % CI: 25. 9 % – 37. 7 %) compared to 26. 9 % (21. 3 % – 32. 5 %) for the pre-paid group. The difference (4. 9 % 95 % CI: - 3. 3 % – 13. 1 %) is not significant at α = 0. 05 (χ 2 = 1. 39; 2 tailed test, d. f. = 1; P = 0. 239). The stamped envelopes were cheaper in terms of cost per returned item (£ 1. 20) than the pre-paid envelopes (£ 1. 67). However if the set up cost for the licence to use the <b>pre-paid</b> <b>service</b> is excluded, the cost of the stamped envelopes is more expensive than pre-paid returns (£ 1. 20 versus £ 0. 73). Conclusion Compared with pre-paid business replies, stamped envelopes did not produce a statistically significant increase in response rate to this patient survey. However, the response gain of the stamped strategy (4. 9 %) is similar to that demonstrated in a Cochrane review (5. 3 %) of strategies to increase response to general mail surveys. Further studies and meta analyses of patient responses to mail surveys via stamped versus pre-paid envelopes are needed with sufficient power to detect response gains of this magnitude in a patient population. </p...|$|E
