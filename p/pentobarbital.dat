5|$|The drug {{has been}} {{introduced}} for use in executions by lethal injection in certain jurisdictions in the United States {{in combination with other}} drugs. It was introduced to replace <b>pentobarbital</b> after the latter's manufacturer disallowed that drug's use for executions.|$|E
25|$|<b>Pentobarbital</b> was {{introduced}} {{at the end}} of 2010 due to a shortage of sodium thiopental, and has since become the primary sedative in lethal injections in the United States.|$|E
25|$|In 2011, after {{pressure}} by activist organizations, {{the manufacturers of}} sodium thiopental and <b>pentobarbital</b> halted supply of the drugs to U.S. prisons performing lethal injections and required all resellers to do the same.|$|E
25|$|When sodium <b>pentobarbital,</b> a {{barbiturate}} used {{often in}} single drug animal euthanasia, is administered in an overdose, it causes rapid unconsciousness followed by paralysis of the diaphragm. This drug may also kill via cardiac arrhythmia.|$|E
25|$|Typically, three {{drugs are}} used in lethal injection. An {{anesthetic}} such as sodium thiopental or <b>pentobarbital</b> is used to induce unconsciousness, pancuronium bromide (Pavulon) to cause muscle paralysis and respiratory arrest, and potassium chloride to stop the heart.|$|E
25|$|The {{export of}} drugs {{to be used}} for lethal {{injection}} was banned by the European Union (EU) in 2011, together with other items under the EU Torture Regulation. Since then, <b>pentobarbital</b> followed thiopental in the European Union's ban.|$|E
25|$|Nembutal is a {{trade name}} for <b>pentobarbital,</b> {{which is a}} long-acting {{barbiturate}} used as a sedative. The drug is commonly used in suicides; and is also used in executions in the United States and The People's Republic of China.|$|E
25|$|In August 1941, {{after being}} {{diagnosed}} with uterine cancer, Alice underwent a hysterectomy. On 23 September, she attempted suicide by taking an overdose of <b>pentobarbital.</b> When her friend, Patricia Bowles, discovered her, she had already marked every piece of furniture {{with the name of}} the friend who would inherit it. Bowles rescued Alice by calling a doctor to pump her stomach.|$|E
25|$|Drug users tend {{to prefer}} short-acting and intermediate-acting barbiturates. The most {{commonly}} used are amobarbital (Amytal), <b>pentobarbital</b> (Nembutal), and secobarbital (Seconal). A combination of amobarbital and secobarbital (called Tuinal) is also highly used. Short-acting and intermediate-acting barbiturates are usually prescribed as sedatives and sleeping pills. These pills begin acting fifteen to forty minutes after they are swallowed, and their effects last from five to six hours.|$|E
25|$|Since then, {{some states}} have used other anesthetics, such as <b>pentobarbital,</b> etomidate, or {{fast-acting}} benzodiazepines like midazolam. Many states have since bought lethal injection drugs from foreign furnishers, and most states have made it a criminal offense to reveal the identities of furnishers or execution team members. In November 2015, California adopted regulations allowing the state to use its own public compounding pharmacies to make the chemicals.|$|E
25|$|On November 18, 1978, Jones {{was found}} dead on a deck chair with a gunshot wound to his head that Guyanese coroner Cyrill Mootoo stated was {{consistent}} with a self-inflicted gunshot wound. However, Jones's son Stephan believes his father may have directed someone else to shoot him. An autopsy of Jones's body also showed levels of the barbiturate <b>Pentobarbital,</b> {{which may have been}} lethal to humans who had not developed physiological tolerance.|$|E
25|$|Before the benzodiazepines were invented, {{there were}} the {{barbiturate}}s, which are still used today if benzodiazepines or the hydantoins are not an option. These are used to induce a barbituric coma. The barbiturate most commonly used for this is phenobarbital. Thiopental or <b>pentobarbital</b> may {{also be used for}} that purpose if the seizures have to be stopped immediately or if the person has already been compromised by the underlying illness or toxic/metabolic-induced seizures; however, in those situations, thiopental is the agent of choice.|$|E
25|$|Thiopental {{rapidly and}} easily crosses the {{blood brain barrier}} {{as it is a}} {{lipophilic}} molecule. As with all lipid-soluble anaesthetic drugs, the short duration of action of sodium thiopental is due almost entirely to its redistribution away from central circulation towards muscle and fat tissue, due to its very high fat:water partition coefficient (aprx 10), leading to sequestration in fat tissue. Once redistributed, the free fraction in the blood is metabolized in the liver. Sodium thiopental is mainly metabolized to <b>pentobarbital,</b> 5-ethyl-5-(1'-methyl-3'-hydroxybutyl)-2-thiobarbituric acid, and 5-ethyl-5-(1'-methyl-3'-carboxypropyl)-2-thiobarbituric acid.|$|E
25|$|There is a {{small group}} of List II drugs for which doctors have to write the {{prescriptions}} according to the same, tougher guidelines as those for List I drugs (writing the prescription in full in letters, listing the patients name, and have to contain the name and initials, address, city and telephone number of the licensed prescriber issuing the prescriptions, as well as the name and initials, address and city of the person the prescription is issued to). Among that group of drugs are the barbiturates amobarbital, butalbital, cyclobarbital, and <b>pentobarbital.</b>|$|E
25|$|After sodium thiopental began {{being used}} in executions, Hospira, the only American company that made the drug, stopped {{manufacturing}} it due to its use in executions. The subsequent nationwide shortage of sodium thiopental led states to seek other drugs to use in executions. <b>Pentobarbital,</b> often used for animal euthanasia, was used {{as part of a}} three-drug cocktail {{for the first time on}} December 16, 2010, when John David Duty was executed in Oklahoma. It was then used as the drug in a single-drug execution for the first time on March 10, 2011, when Johnnie Baston was executed in Ohio.|$|E
25|$|In {{tests in}} <b>pentobarbital</b> trained rhesus monkeys benzodiazepines {{produced}} effects similar to barbiturates. In a 1991 study, triazolam {{had the highest}} self-administration rate in cocaine trained baboons, among the five benzodiazepines examined: alprazolam, bromazepam, chlordiazepoxide, lorazepam, triazolam. A 1985 study found that triazolam and temazepam maintained higher rates of self-injection than {{a variety of other}} benzodiazepines. A 1991 study indicated that diazepam, in particular, had a greater abuse liability among people who were drug abusers than did many of the other benzodiazepines. Some of the available data also suggested that lorazepam and alprazolam are more diazepam-like in having relatively high abuse liability, while oxazepam, halazepam, and possibly chlordiazepoxide, are relatively low in this regard. A 1991â€“1993 British study found that the hypnotics flurazepam and temazepam were more toxic than average benzodiazepines in overdose. A 1995 study found that temazepam is more rapidly absorbed and oxazepam is more slowly absorbed than most other benzodiazepines.|$|E
25|$|Some {{symptoms}} of an overdose typically include sluggishness, incoordination, difficulty in thinking, slowness of speech, faulty judgement, drowsiness, shallow breathing, staggering, and, in severe cases, coma or death. The lethal dosage of barbiturates varies greatly with tolerance and from one individual to another. The lethal dose is highly variable among different {{members of the}} class with superpotent barbiturates such as <b>pentobarbital</b> being potentially fatal in considerably lower doses than the low-potency barbiturates such as butalbital. Even in inpatient settings, however, the development of tolerance is still a problem, as dangerous and unpleasant withdrawal symptoms can result when the drug is stopped after dependence has developed. Tolerance to the anxiolytic and sedative effects of barbiturates tends to develop faster than tolerance to their effects on smooth muscle, respiration, and heart rate, making them generally unsuitable for a long time psychiatric use. Tolerance to the anticonvulsant effects tends to correlate more with tolerance to physiological effects, however, meaning that they are still a viable option for long-term epilepsy treatment.|$|E
25|$|PETA has {{promoted}} legal initiatives to enforce existing euthanasia laws. In 1990, Georgia's Humane Euthanasia Act {{became one of}} the first laws in the nation to mandate intravenous injection of sodium <b>pentobarbital</b> as the prescribed method for euthanizing cats and dogs in Georgia animal shelters. Prior to that time, gas chambers and other means were commonly employed. Georgia Agriculture Commissioner Tommy Irvin was tasked with licensing the shelters and enforcing the new law, through the Department's Animal Protection Division. However, Commissioner Irvin failed to abide by the terms of the law, and instead continued to license gas chambers. PETA contacted the author of the original legislation, and in March 2007, the Georgia Department of Agriculture and Commissioner Irvin were sued by former State Representative Chesley V. Morton. The Fulton County Superior Court ruled in favor of the plaintiffs, validating the terms of the Humane Euthanasia Act, with an injunction prohibiting the Department from issuing licenses to shelters using gas chambers in violation of the Act. When the Department continued to license a gas chamber in Cobb County, a second court action was brought, which resulted in the Department being held in contempt.|$|E
25|$|PETA {{opposes the}} no-kill movement, and, {{according}} to its most recent filing with The Virginia Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services (VDACS), euthanized 81 percent of the animals that ended up at its shelter. According to VDACS, PETA took 3,017 animals into its shelters in 2014, of which 2,455 were euthanized, 162 were adopted, 353 were released to other shelters, and 6 were reclaimed by their original owners. The group justifies its euthanasia policies toward animals who are not adopted by saying that it takes in feral cat colonies with diseases such as feline AIDS and leukemia, stray dogs, litters of parvo-infected puppies, and backyard dogs and says {{that it would be}} unrealistic to follow a no-kill policy in such instances. PETA offers free euthanasia services to counties that kill unwanted animals via gassing or shootingâ€”the group recommends the use of an intravenous injection of sodium <b>pentobarbital</b> if administered by a trained professional and for severely ill or dying animals when euthanasia at a veterinarian is unaffordable. The group recommends not breeding pit bulls and supports euthanasia in certain situations for animals in shelters: for example, for those living for long periods in cramped cages.|$|E
500|$|The Los Angeles County Coroners Office was {{assisted}} in their investigation by psychiatrists from the Los Angeles Suicide Prevention Team, who had expert knowledge on suicide [...] It was estimated that Monroe had died between 8:30 and 10:30p.m., and the toxicology report later {{revealed that the}} cause of death was acute barbiturate poisoning. She had 8mg% (milligrams per 100 milliliters of solution) chloral hydrate and 4.5mg% of <b>pentobarbital</b> (Nembutal) in her blood, and a further 13mg% of <b>pentobarbital</b> in her liver. Empty bottles containing these medicines were found next to her bed. The possibility that Monroe had accidentally overdosed was ruled out, because the dosages found in her body were several times over the lethal limit. Her doctors stated that she had been prone to [...] "severe fears and frequent depressions" [...] with [...] "abrupt and unpredictable" [...] mood changes, and had overdosed several times in the past, possibly intentionally. Due to these facts and the lack of any indication of foul play, the coroner classified her death as a [...] "probable suicide".|$|E

2500|$|John David Duty (April 25, 1952 [...] December 16, 2010) was an American who was {{executed}} in Oklahoma for first-degree murder. According to the Oklahoma Department of Corrections, {{he is the}} first person in the United States to have been put to death with <b>pentobarbital.</b> A nationwide shortage of sodium thiopental led the state to incorporate the substitution into their protocol for lethal injections. Duty's case gained media attention because <b>pentobarbital</b> had typically been used to euthanize animals.|$|E
2500|$|An Associated Press {{news agency}} {{journalist}} said that 5g of the barbiturate <b>pentobarbital</b> was administered. [...] Franklin {{was pronounced dead}} ten minutes later.|$|E
2500|$|In 2010, a {{nationwide}} shortage of the lethal injection drug, sodium thiopental, led the Oklahoma Department of Corrections to instead consider <b>pentobarbital,</b> which {{is commonly used}} for animal euthanasia. Oklahoma state law is not specific in prescribing {{the use of a}} fast-acting barbiturate, allowing flexibility for such a substitution. Duty and two other inmates on death row filed a federal appeal that the new protocol would constitute cruel and unusual punishment. In a hearing before the Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals, the professor of anesthesia from Harvard Medical School testified for the defense that <b>pentobarbital</b> might not succeed in preventing [...] "severe, excruciating pain". However, the professor of anesthesiology at the University of Massachusetts Amherst countered in a deposition for the state that 5grams of <b>pentobarbital</b> would be sufficient to cause unconsciousness and death in minutes. Representatives from the Oklahoma Department of Corrections and the Death Penalty Information Center both testified that no other state had used <b>pentobarbital</b> and that they believed Duty would be the first person to be executed by the drug. On December 14, 2010, the Circuit Judges Jerome Holmes and Neil Gorsuch joined Chief Judge Mary Beck Briscoe in a unanimous decision upholding the use of the drug, citing that the state witness had demonstrated [...] "substantially more clinical experience with the use of pentobarbital". A petition for certiorari to the Supreme Court of the United States over the constitutionality of the state's execution protocol was also denied.|$|E
2500|$|Franklin was {{executed}} at the Eastern Reception, Diagnostic and Correctional Center in Bonne Terre, Missouri on November 20, 2013. [...] The execution began at 6:07 AM CST {{and he was}} pronounced dead at 6:17 AM. His execution was the first lethal injection in Missouri to use <b>pentobarbital</b> alone instead of the conventional three drug cocktail.|$|E
2500|$|Under Texas law, executions {{are carried}} out at or after 6 p.m. Huntsville (Central) time [...] "by {{intravenous}} injection of a substance or substances in a lethal quantity sufficient to cause death and until such convict is dead". [...] The law does not specify the substance(s) to be used; previously, according to the Texas Department of Criminal Justice the chemicals used for the lethal injection were the commonly-used three-drug combination of (in order) sodium thiopental (a dose which sedates the offender, {{but not enough to}} kill outright), pancuronium bromide (a muscle relaxant which collapses the diaphragm and lungs), and potassium chloride (which stops the heartbeat). The offender is usually pronounced dead approximately seven minutes after start of the injection process; the cost for the three substances is $86.08 per offender. As a result of drug shortages, sodium thiopental was replaced by <b>pentobarbital</b> in 2011. Further shortages of this drug have pushed the cost of the drugs to approximately $1300 per offender. Still further shortages of pancuronium bromide (and the expiration of the existing stock) forced the state into switching to a single-drug protocol, using solely <b>pentobarbital.</b>|$|E
2500|$|Patients {{with brain}} swelling, causing {{elevation}} of intracranial pressure, either secondary to trauma or following surgery, {{may benefit from}} this drug. [...] Sodium thiopental, and the barbiturate class of drugs, decrease neuronal activity and therefore decrease the production of osmotically active metabolites, which in turn decreases swelling. [...] Patients with significant swelling have improved outcomes following the induction of coma. Reportedly, thiopental {{has been shown to}} be superior to <b>pentobarbital</b> in reducing intracranial pressure. This phenomenon is also called a reverse steal effect.|$|E
2500|$|Barbiturates like <b>pentobarbital</b> can {{act like}} free radical {{scavengers}} as well decrease intracranial blood volume by reducing cerebral metabolic demand. However, administration of barbiturates poses risks such as hypotension, induced coma and infection limiting their potential clinical application. Although corticosteroids {{are not very}} effective in treating cerebral edema resulting from ischemic stroke and intracerebral hemorrhage, they are very effective in treating vasogenic edema resulting from brain tumors. Idea behind administration of both barbiturates and corticosteroids is to provide space for cerebral swelling resulting from edema, thus, these [...] are very non specific treating methods.|$|E
2500|$|In 1971, the Convention on Psychotropic Substances {{was signed}} in Vienna. Designed to {{regulate}} amphetamines, barbiturates, and other synthetics, the 34th version of the treaty, , regulates secobarbital as schedule II, amobarbital, butalbital, cyclobarbital, and <b>pentobarbital</b> as schedule III, and allobarbital, barbital, butobarbital, mephobarbital, phenobarbital, butabarbital, and vinylbital as schedule IV on its [...] "Green List". The combination medication Fioricet, consisting of butalbital, caffeine, and paracetamol (acetaminophen), however, is specifically exempted from controlled substance status, while its sibling Fiorinal, which contains aspirin instead of paracetamol and may contain codeine phosphate, remains a schedule III drug.|$|E
2500|$|In the United States, [...] the Controlled Substances Act of 1970 {{classified}} most barbiturates as controlled substancesâ€”and {{they remain}} so [...] Barbital, methylphenobarbital (also known as mephobarbital), and phenobarbital are designated schedule IV drugs, and [...] "Any substance which contains any quantity of a derivative of barbituric acid, or any salt of a derivative of barbituric acid" [...] (all other barbiturates) were designated as schedule III. Under the original CSA, no barbiturates {{were placed in}} schedule I, II, or V, however amobarbital, <b>pentobarbital,</b> and secobarbital are schedule II controlled substances unless {{they are in a}} suppository dosage form.|$|E
2500|$|Duty was {{strapped}} to a gurney with a patch over his right eye when the drugs were administered at 6:12 pm; a second intravenous line was prepared as a backup. The injection protocol included <b>pentobarbital</b> for sedation, followed by vecuronium bromide to paralyze his breathing, and finally potassium chloride to stop the heart. Duty repeated, [...] "Thank you Lord, Thank you Lord" [...] while he lost consciousness. He appeared to stop breathing 3 minutes later and was pronounced dead at 6:18 pm. Duty was the last prisoner to be executed in the United States in 2010. He was survived by his two sons, a daughter, and several grandchildren.|$|E
2500|$|Love {{also drew}} on {{literary}} influences while writing the album's lyrics; the phrase [...] "live through this" [...] in [...] "Asking For It", which {{later became the}} album title, is derived from a quote in Gone with the Wind, and the phrase [...] "kill me pills" [...] is a direct reference to the poet Anne Sexton, who, after overdosing on barbiturates and <b>pentobarbital</b> called the drugs [...] "kill me pills." [...] The refrain in [...] "Plump" [...] in which Love sings, [...] "I'm eating you. I'm overfed" [...] also bears similarity to a line from Sexton's poem [...] "The Ballad of the Lonely Masturbator", which reads: [...] "They are eating each other. They are overfed." ...|$|E
2500|$|Sodium thiopental, {{also known}} as Sodium Pentothal (a {{trademark}} of Abbott Laboratories, {{not to be confused}} with <b>pentobarbital),</b> thiopental, thiopentone, or Trapanal (also a trademark), is a rapid-onset short-acting barbiturate general anesthetic that is an analogue of thiobarbital. [...] Sodium thiopental was a core medicine in the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines, which is a list of minimum medical needs for a basic healthcare system, but was supplanted by propofol. Despite this thiopental is still listed as an acceptable alternative to propofol, depending on local availability and cost of these agents. It was previously the first of three drugs administered during most lethal injections in the United States, but the U.S. manufacturer Hospira stopped manufacturing the drug and the EU banned the export of the drug for this purpose.|$|E
2500|$|Further, {{barbiturates}} {{are relatively}} non-selective compounds that bind to an entire superfamily of ligand-gated ion channels, {{of which the}} GABAA receptor channel {{is only one of}} several representatives. This superfamily of ion channels includes the neuronal nACh receptor channel, the 5-HT3 receptor channel, and the glycine receptor channel. However, while GABAA receptor currents are increased by barbiturates (and other general anaesthetics), ligand-gated ion channels that are predominantly permeable for cationic ions are blocked by these compounds. For example, neuronal nAChR channels are blocked by clinically relevant anaesthetic concentrations of both thiopental and <b>pentobarbital.</b> Such findings implicate (non-GABA-ergic) ligand-gated ion channels, e.g. the neuronal nAChR channel, in mediating some of the (side) effects of barbiturates. This is the mechanism responsible for the (mild to moderate) anesthetic effect of barbiturates in high doses when used in anesthetic concentration ...|$|E
2500|$|Justice Sonia Sotomayor filed a dissent, {{in which}} Justices Ginsburg, Breyer, and Elena Kagan joined. Sotomayor stated that [...] "under the Court's new rule, {{it would not}} matter whether the State {{intended}} to use midazolam, or instead to have petitioners drawn and quartered, slowly tortured to death, or actually burned at the stake: because petitioners failed to prove the availability of sodium thiopental or <b>pentobarbital,</b> the State could execute them using whatever means it designate." [...] Sotomayor attacked the credence the Court gave to Oklahoma's expert witness, writing [...] "Dr. Evans' conclusions were entirely unsupported by any study or third-party source, contradicted by the extrinsic evidence proffered by petitioners, inconsistent with the scientific understanding of midazolam's properties, and apparently premised on basic logical errors." [...] Sotomayor contended Dr. Evans' testimony that midazolam could [...] "paralyze the brain" [...] was directly refuted by peer-reviewed articles cited by the prisoners' expert witnesses.|$|E
2500|$|Sodium thiopental is {{a member}} of the {{barbiturate}} class of drugs, which are relatively non-selective compounds that bind to an entire superfamily of ligand-gated ion channels, of which the GABAA receptor channel is one of several representatives.
