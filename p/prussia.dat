5|$|The {{partition}} {{treaty was}} ratified by its signatories on September 22, 1772. It {{was a major}} success for Frederick II of Prussia: Prussia's share {{might have been the}} smallest, but it was also significantly developed and strategically important. <b>Prussia</b> took most of Polish Royal <b>Prussia,</b> including Ermland, allowing Frederick to link East <b>Prussia</b> and Brandenburg. <b>Prussia</b> also annexed northern areas of Greater Poland along the Noteć River (the Netze District), and northern Kuyavia, but not the cities of Danzig (Gdańsk) and Thorn (Toruń). The territories annexed by <b>Prussia</b> became a new province in 1773 called West <b>Prussia.</b> Overall, <b>Prussia</b> gained 36,000km2 and about 600,000 people. According to Jerzy Surdykowski Frederick the Great soon introduced German colonists in territories he conquered and engaged in Germanization of Polish territories. Frederick II settled 26,000 Germans in Polish Pomerania which influenced the ethnic situation in the region that at the time had around 300,000 inhabitants, and enforced Germanization. According to Christopher Clark in certain areas annexed by <b>Prussia</b> like Notec and Royal <b>Prussia</b> 54 percent of the population (75 percent of the urban populace) were German-speaking Protestants. In the next century this was used by nationalistic German historians to justify the partition, but it was irrelevant to contemporary calculations: Frederick, dismissive of German culture, was instead pursuing an imperialist policy, acting on the security interests of his state. The new-gained territories connected <b>Prussia</b> with Germany proper, and were of major economic importance. By seizing northwestern Poland, <b>Prussia</b> instantly cut off Poland from the sea, and gained control of over 80% of the Commonwealth's total foreign trade. Through levying enormous custom duties, <b>Prussia</b> accelerated the inevitable collapse of the Polish–Lithuanian state.|$|E
5|$|A trade {{treaty was}} signed between the Commonwealth and <b>Prussia,</b> {{unfavorable}} to the Commonwealth. The Partition {{cut off the}} Commonwealth's access to the Baltic Sea, and the state {{had no choice but}} to accept the high tariffs imposed by <b>Prussia.</b>|$|E
5|$|Already by 1769—71, both Austria and <b>Prussia</b> {{had taken}} over some border territories of the Commonwealth, with Austria taking Szepes County in 1769–1770 and <b>Prussia</b> {{incorporating}} Lauenburg and Bütow. On February 19, 1772, the agreement of partition was signed in Vienna. A previous agreement between <b>Prussia</b> and Russia {{had been made in}} Saint Petersburg on February 6, 1772. Early in August, Russian, Prussian and Austrian troops simultaneously entered the Commonwealth and occupied the provinces agreed upon among themselves. On August 5, the three parties signed the treaty on their respective territorial gains at the commonwealth's expense.|$|E
50|$|Although the ineffectual King himself seemed {{resigned}} to <b>Prussia's</b> fate, various reforming ministers, such as Baron vom Stein, Prince von Hardenberg, Scharnhorst, and Count Gneisenau, set about reforming <b>Prussia's</b> administration and military, with {{the encouragement of}} Queen Luise (who died, greatly mourned, in 1810).|$|R

5|$|Duchess Louise of Mecklenburg-Strelitz (Luise Auguste Wilhelmine Amalie; 10 March 1776– 19 July 1810) was Queen of <b>Prussia</b> as {{the wife}} of King Frederick William III.

5|$|From the beginning, the {{alliance}} {{was much more}} valuable to the Commonwealth than to <b>Prussia.</b> Soon after the treaty was signed, the international situation, and changes within the Commonwealth, made the treaty much less valuable to the Prussian side. Meanwhile, the Commonwealth embarked {{on a series of}} major internal reforms, seeing {{the alliance}} as a guarantee that it had the backing of a powerful neighbor in this process – where in fact <b>Prussia</b> felt those reforms were not in its best interest, and felt threatened by them. When Russia invaded the Commonwealth in May 1792, <b>Prussia</b> refused a request to honor the alliance and intervene, arguing that it was not consulted with regard to the 3rd May Constitution, which invalidated the alliance. A few months later, in 1793, <b>Prussia</b> aided Russia in the suppression of the Kościuszko Uprising.|$|E
5|$|Heinrich von Treitschke's History of Germany in the Nineteenth Century, {{published}} in 1879, has perhaps a misleading title: it privileges {{the history of}} <b>Prussia</b> over the history of other German states, and it {{tells the story of}} the German-speaking peoples through the guise of Prussia's destiny to unite all German states under its leadership. The creation of this Borussian myth (Borussia is the Latin name for <b>Prussia)</b> established <b>Prussia</b> as Germany's savior; it was the destiny of all Germans to be united, this myth maintains, and it was Prussia's destiny to accomplish this. According to this story, <b>Prussia</b> played the dominant role in bringing the German states together as a nation-state; only <b>Prussia</b> could protect German liberties from being crushed by French or Russian influence. The story continues by drawing on Prussia's role in saving Germans from the resurgence of Napoleon's power in 1815, at Waterloo, creating some semblance of economic unity, and uniting Germans under one proud flag after 1871.|$|E

5|$|In 1454, the Prussian Confederation, an {{alliance}} of Prussian cities and nobility opposed to the increasingly oppressive rule of the Teutonic Knights, asked King Casimir to take over <b>Prussia</b> and initiated an armed uprising against the Knights. Casimir declared a war on the Order and the formal incorporation of <b>Prussia</b> into the Polish Crown; those events led to the Thirteen Years' War of 1454-66. The mobilization of the Polish forces (the pospolite ruszenie) was weak at first, since the szlachta would not cooperate without concessions from Casimir that were formalized in the Statutes of Nieszawa promulgated in 1454. This prevented a takeover of all of <b>Prussia,</b> but in the Second Peace of Thorn in 1466, the Knights had to surrender the western half of their territory to the Polish Crown (the areas known afterwards as Royal <b>Prussia,</b> a semi-autonomous entity), and to accept Polish-Lithuanian suzerainty over the remainder (the later Ducal <b>Prussia).</b> Poland regained Pomerelia, with its access to the Baltic Sea, as well as Warmia. In addition to land warfare, naval battles took place in which ships provided by the City of Danzig (Gdańsk) successfully fought Danish and Teutonic fleets.|$|E
5|$|In 1866, Austria {{called for}} <b>Prussia</b> {{to hand over}} {{administration}} of Schleswig-Holstein, which had until that point been jointly administered by the two powers, to the Duke of Augustenberg. <b>Prussia</b> refused, and Otto von Bismarck sent troops into Austrian-administered Holstein. This provoked war between Austria and <b>Prussia,</b> with Hesse siding with the Austrians, technically making Alice and her sister Victoria enemies.|$|E

5|$|Princess Charlotte of <b>Prussia</b> (Viktoria Elisabeth Auguste Charlotte; 24 July 1860 – 1 October 1919) was Duchess Consort of Saxe-Meiningen as {{the wife}} of Bernhard III, the duchy's last ruler.

5|$|Schleswig and Holstein {{were two}} territories fought over between <b>Prussia</b> and Denmark during the First and Second Schleswig Wars. In the latter, <b>Prussia</b> and Austria {{defeated}} Denmark, but the duchies were claimed by Austria for the Prince Christian's family. However, following the Austro-Prussian War, in which <b>Prussia</b> invaded and occupied the duchies, they became Prussian, but the title Duke of Schleswig-Holstein was still claimed by Prince Christian's family.|$|E
5|$|The Treaty of Jassy in January 1792 {{ended the}} Russian {{war with the}} Ottomans, and in April of that year the First Coalition wars began, forcing <b>Prussia</b> to move the bulk of its forces west to deal with revolutionary France. Russia, angered by Poland's attempt {{to move out of}} its influence, invaded Poland in May. Around that time, Prussian policy was already set against Poland; rather than {{discussing}} how to aid it, Frederic Wilhelm and his ministers were discussing how to convince Austria and <b>Prussia</b> to a new partition. Lucchesini has already made several declarations that <b>Prussia</b> cannot aid the Commonwealth, and in June that year, Potocki's mission to Berlin received a confirmation of that, motivated {{on the grounds that the}} Constitution of 3 May changed Polish state so much that <b>Prussia</b> does not consider its obligations binding. Prussian Foreign Minister, Friedrich Wilhelm von Schulenburg-Kehnert, has clearly and with rare candor told Potocki that <b>Prussia</b> did not support the constitution, but could not say so initially, as to not allow any Polish-Russian reconciliation, and now will not even help as a mediator, as it is not in Prussian's interest of the state to see Commonwealth strengthened so that it could threaten <b>Prussia</b> in some future.|$|E
5|$|The end of {{the eighteenth}} century saw the {{division}} of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth, in three steps, among the neighboring states.

5|$|Another {{war with}} Russia {{followed}} in 1632 and was concluded without much {{change in the}} status quo. King Władysław IV then proceeded to recover the lands lost to Sweden.

After Frederick William's last Prussian homage before the Polish king in 1641, the Commonwealth's position in regard to <b>Prussia</b> and its Hohenzollern rulers kept getting weaker.|$|E
5|$|At {{the outset}} of the war, Frederick had one of the finest armies in Europe: his troops—any company—could fire at least four volleys a minute, and some of them could fire five.
