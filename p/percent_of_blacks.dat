25|$|In 1950 few {{northern}} cities yet had majority or near majority {{percentages of}} blacks, nor did southern ones: Washington, DC was 35 percent African American and Baltimore was 40 percent. From 1950 to 1970, {{the black population}} increased dramatically in Philadelphia, Pittsburgh, Newark, Chicago, Detroit, Cleveland, St. Louis, Kansas City, Cincinnati and Indianapolis. By 1960 75 <b>percent</b> <b>of</b> <b>blacks</b> lived in urban environments, while whites had been moving to suburbs in large numbers following WWII. Black flight has altered the hyper-urban density that had resulted from the Second Great Migration to cities (1940–70), with hyper-segregation in inner-city areas, such as in Chicago, St. Louis, and East St. Louis.|$|E
25|$|Inspired by the Revolution and evangelical preachers, {{numerous}} slaveholders in the Chesapeake region manumitted {{some or all}} {{of their}} slaves, during their lifetimes or by will. From 1,800 persons in 1782, the total population of free blacks in Virginia increased to 12,766 (4.3 <b>percent</b> <b>of</b> <b>blacks)</b> in 1790, and to 30,570 in 1810; the percentage change was from free blacks' comprising {{less than one percent of}} the total black population in Virginia, to 7.2 percent by 1810, even as the overall population increased. One planter, Robert Carter III freed more than 450 slaves in his lifetime, more than any other planter. George Washington freed all of his slaves at his death.|$|E
25|$|African Americans {{had long}} {{composed}} {{the majority of}} the state's population. However, in 1860, only 2 percent of the state's black population were free; most were mulattos or free people of color, with ties of kinship to white families. They were well established as more educated and skilled artisans in Charleston and some other cities despite social restrictions, and sometimes as landowners and slaveholders. As a result, free people of color before the war became important leaders in the South Carolina government during Reconstruction; they made up 26 <b>percent</b> <b>of</b> <b>blacks</b> elected to office in the state between 1868 and 1876 and played important roles in the Republican Party, prepared by their education, skills and experiences before the war.|$|E

25|$|Although Virginia, Maryland and Delaware were slave states, {{the latter}} two already had a high {{proportion}} of free blacks by the outbreak of war. Following the Revolution, the three legislatures made manumission easier, allowed by deed or will. Quaker and Methodist ministers particularly urged slaveholders to free their slaves. The number and proportion of freed slaves in these states rose dramatically until 1810. More than half of the number of free blacks in the United States were concentrated in the Upper South. The proportion of free blacks among the black population in the Upper South rose from less than one percent in 1792 to more than 10 percent by 1810. In Delaware, nearly 75 <b>percent</b> <b>of</b> <b>blacks</b> were free by 1810.|$|E

2500|$|Between 1900 and 1910, the African-American {{population}} rose {{rapidly in}} Chicago. White hostility {{and population growth}} combined to create the ghetto on the South Side. [...] Nearby were areas dominated by ethnic Irish, who were especially territorial in defending against incursions into their areas by any other groups. Most of this large population was composed of migrants. In 1910 more than 75 <b>percent</b> <b>of</b> <b>blacks</b> lived in predominantly black sections of the city. The eight or nine neighborhoods {{that had been set}} as areas of black settlement in 1900 remained the core of the Chicago African-American community. The Black Belt slowly expanded as African Americans, despite facing violence and restrictive covenants, pushed forward into new neighborhoods. As the population grew, African Americans became more confined to a delineated area, instead of spreading throughout the city. When blacks moved into mixed neighborhoods, ethnic white hostility grew. After fighting over the area, often whites left the area to be dominated by blacks. This {{is one of the reasons}} the black belt region started.|$|E
50|$|The racial {{wage gap}} {{for blacks and}} whites has been {{observed}} to differ in {{the public and private}} sectors. In a 2001 analysis, a $3.65 difference per hour was found between blacks and whites in the private sector, a 34 percent difference. In contrast, a smaller difference of $2.85 per hour was found in the public sector, a 21 percent difference. For the 23 <b>percent</b> <b>of</b> <b>blacks</b> that work in the public sector, evidence suggests that wages are based primary on individual qualifications, but for the 77 <b>percent</b> <b>of</b> <b>blacks</b> employed in the private sector, this assertion has not been found to be as valid.|$|E
50|$|When the Emancipation Proclamation {{was signed}} in 1863, less than eight percent of the African-American {{population}} lived in the Northeastern or Midwestern United States. This began to change over the next decade; by 1880, a migration was underway to Kansas. The U.S. Senate ordered an investigation into it. In 1900, about 90 <b>percent</b> <b>of</b> <b>blacks</b> still lived in Southern states.|$|E
50|$|From 1965 to 1969, {{black family}} income rose from 54 to 60 <b>percent</b> <b>of</b> white family income.

50|$|After the {{introduction}} of crack cocaine, even African-American families were torn apart; family institutions also became dysfunctional. There were no male role models in the family. Seventy <b>percent</b> <b>of</b> <b>black</b> children were born to single mothers. Twenty eight <b>percent</b> <b>of</b> all <b>black</b> men would be incarcerated in their lifetime.

One report found that 53 <b>percent</b> <b>of</b> <b>blacks</b> born in the bottom income quintile remain there as adults, while only 33 percent of whites do.

50|$|Twenty-five <b>percent</b> <b>of</b> <b>blacks</b> had white-collar occupations (management, professional, {{and related}} fields) in 2000, {{compared}} with 33.6% of Americans overall. In 2001, {{over half of}} African-American households of married couples earned $50,000 or more. Although {{in the same year}} African Americans were over-represented among the nation's poor, this was directly related to the disproportionate percentage of African-American families headed by single women; such families are collectively poorer, regardless of ethnicity.|$|E
5000|$|The {{number of}} Americans holding antisemitic views {{declined}} markedly {{six years later}} when another ADL study classified only 12 percent of the population—between 20 and 25 million adults—as [...] "most anti-Semitic."

Despite their relative obscurity, black Republicans are nonetheless important and influential. However, the literature on black Republicans has been neither well informed nor satisfying, typically portraying black Republicans as adherents to a single strain of Republican thought. In response, this thesis aims to document the diverse array of thoughts, opinions, and experiences among black Republicans.
