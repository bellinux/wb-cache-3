40|$|<b>The</b> vial <b>capping</b> {{process is}} a {{critical}} unit operation during drug product manufacturing, as it could possibly generate cosmetic defects or even affect container closure integrity. Yet there is significant variability in capping equipment and processes, and their relation to potential defects or container closure integrity has not been thoroughly studied. In this study we applied several methods-residual seal force tester, a self-developed system of a piezo force sensor measurement, and computed tomography-to characterize different container closure system combinations that had been sealed using different capping process parameter settings. Additionally, container closure integrity of these samples was measured using helium leakage (physical container closure integrity) and compared to characterization data. <b>The</b> different <b>capping</b> equipment settings lead to residual seal force values from 7 to 115 N. High residual seal force values were achieved with high capping pre-compression force and a short distance between <b>the</b> <b>capping</b> plate and <b>plunge.</b> <b>The</b> choice of container closure system influenced the obtained residual seal force values. The residual seal force tester and piezoelectric measurements showed similar trends. All vials passed physical container closure integrity testing, and no stopper rupture was seen {{with any of the}} settings applied, suggesting that container closure integrity was warranted for the studied container closure system with <b>the</b> chosen <b>capping</b> setting ranges...|$|R

40|$|A {{cylindrical}} transmembrane molecule {{is constructed}} by linking hydrophobic sites {{selected from a}} coarse grain model. The resulting hollow tube assembly serves as a representation of a transmembrane channel, pore, or a carbon nanotube. The interactions of a coarse grain di-myristoyl-phosphatidyl-choline hydrated bilayer with both a purely hydrophobic tube and a tube with hydrophilic <b>caps</b> are studied. <b>The</b> hydrophobic tube rotates in the membrane and becomes blocked by lipid tails after a few tens of nanoseconds. The hydrophilic sites of <b>the</b> <b>capped</b> tube stabilize it by anchoring the tube in the lipid headgroup/water interfacial region of each membrane leaflet. <b>The</b> <b>capped</b> tube remains free of lipid tails. <b>The</b> <b>capped</b> tube spontaneously conducts coarse grain water sites; the free-energy profile {{of this process is}} calculated using three different methods and is compared to the barrier for water permeation through the lipid bilayer. Spontaneous tube insertion into an undisturbed lipid bilayer is also studied, which we reported briefly in a previous publication. The hydrophobic tube submerges into the membrane core in a carpetlike manner. <b>The</b> <b>capped</b> tube laterally fuses with the closest leaflet, and then, after <b>plunging</b> into <b>the</b> membrane interior, rotates to assume a transbilayer orientation. Two lipids become trapped {{at the end of the}} tube as it penetrates the membrane. The hydrophilic headgroups of these lipids associate with <b>the</b> lower tube <b>cap</b> and assist <b>the</b> tube in crossing the interior of the membrane.

40|$|In this paper, hypopycnal and hyperpycnal {{particulate}} currents {{that are}} formed at river outflows {{in the sea}} are studied. The main aim {{is the use of}} CFD methods, in order to investigate <b>the</b> <b>plunging</b> mechanism in <b>the</b> case of hyperpycnal currents. Two series of numerical experiments are conducted. The first series, aims to validate the numerical model by checking its ability in capturing the critical suspended sediment concentration for <b>plunging.</b> <b>The</b> second series, aims to investigate the dependence of <b>the</b> <b>plunge</b> depth from <b>the</b> initial flow conditions, in the case of hyperpycnal currents. From the analysis of the results, an empirical equation is derived which relates <b>the</b> <b>plunge</b> depth with <b>the</b> initial conditions. It is also found that secondary hyperpycnal currents, can be generated indirectly, from hypopycnal currents, due to descending sediment fingers. The model predictions, in the present paper are in agreement with previous investigations...|$|R
