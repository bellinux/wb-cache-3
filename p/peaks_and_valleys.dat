40|$|Purpose: To {{investigate}} biochemical {{changes in}} mouse tumour tissue following Microbeam Radiation Therapy (MRT) and Broad Beam (BB) irradiation using synchrotron Fourier-Transform Infrared (FTIR) microspectroscopy. Materials and methods: Synchrotron FTIR microspectroscopy {{was carried out}} on mouse tumour sections previously irradiated with BB (11, 22 or 44 Gy), MRT (560 Gy in-beam, 25 μm wide, 200 μm peak separation) or sham-irradiation (0 Gy) from mice culled 4 hours post-irradiation. Results: MRT and BB-irradiated tumour sections showed clear chemical shifts in spectral bands corresponding to functional group vibrations in protein (16541630 cm- 1), lipid (~ 1470, 1463 cm - 1) and nucleic acid (11301050 cm- 1). MRT <b>peak</b> <b>and</b> <b>valley</b> regions showed virtually identical absorbance patterns in protein and lipid regions. However, we observed chemical shifts corresponding to the nucleic acid region (11201050 cm- 1) between the <b>peak</b> <b>and</b> <b>valley</b> dose regions. Chemical maps produced from integrating absorbance bands of interest over the scanned tumour area did not reveal any microbeam paths. Conclusions: The lack of difference between MRT <b>peak</b> <b>and</b> <b>valley</b> irradiated areas suggests a holistic tissue response to MRT that occurs within 4 h, and might be the first evidence for a mechanism by which MRT kills the whole tumour despite {{only a small percentage}} receiving peak irradiation...|$|R

500|$|Bedrock composes {{much of the}} {{streambed}} in {{the upper}} and lower reaches of the Kootenay, but in the middle portion, alluvial sediments allow the river to meander over a broader valley floor. The sediments probably originated through heavy glaciation during the previous Ice Age. About 15,000 years ago, the Cordilleran Ice Sheet advanced southwards into present-day BC, Montana and Idaho, blocking the Kootenay River at the outlet of Kootenay Lake, which [...] did not yet exist. Glaciers covered most of the northern Kootenay River watershed and heavily shaped the <b>peaks</b> <b>and</b> <b>valleys</b> one sees today. The glacier that formed Kootenay Lake caused the river to back up into an enormous body of water that stretched all the way to Libby, Montana, near where the Libby Dam now stands, and possibly even connected to Lake Pend Oreille, which also was much enlarged at the time. Glacially deposited sediments buried the old streambed of the Kootenay River and created a natural dam where the Kootenay turns west out of Kootenay Lake. After the glaciers retreated, Kootenay Lake receded to its present level and the Kootenay Flats were formed.|$|E

40|$|Abstract – While {{naturally}} sampled <b>peak</b> <b>and</b> <b>valley</b> current mode control {{methods have}} been widely used, other control architectures are possible using gated sampling techniques. Theory for an emulated peak current mode control method using a gated sample and hold of the valley current is developed. This gated sampling technique removes the duty cycle dependence of the slope compensating ramp, stabilizing the modulator gain over changes in line voltage. A general solution for current mode buck regulator small signal linear equations is presented. This allows the modulator gain for any control method to be introduced into the equations, including <b>peak,</b> <b>valley,</b> average <b>and</b> gated sampling methods. Comparison to <b>peak</b> <b>and</b> <b>valley</b> is made using switching, linear and LaPlace spice models. Sub-harmonic stability bounds are demonstrated using graphical spreadsheet calculators.

2500|$|The 20th century saw <b>peaks</b> <b>and</b> <b>valleys</b> in the {{popularity}} of Chianti and eventually lead to a radical evolution in the wine's style due {{to the influence of}} the [...] "Super Tuscans". The late 19th century saw oidium and the phylloxera epidemic take its toll on the vineyards of Chianti just as they had ravaged vineyards across Europe. The chaos and poverty following the Risorgimento heralded the beginning of the Italian diaspora that would take Italian vineyard workers and winemakers abroad as immigrants to new lands. Those that stayed behind and replanted, chose high yielding varieties like Trebbiano and Sangiovese clones such as the Sangiovese di Romagna from the nearby Romagna region. Following World War II, the general trend in the world wine market was for cheap, easy drinking wine, which saw a brief boom for the region. With over cropping and an emphasis on quantity over quality, the reputation of Chianti among consumers eventually plummeted. By the 1950s, Trebbiano (which is known for its neutral flavors) made up to 30% of many mass-market Chiantis. By the late 20th century, Chianti was often associated with basic mass-market Chianti sold in a squat bottle enclosed in a straw basket, called fiasco. However, during this same time a group of ambitious producers began working outside the boundaries of DOC regulations to make what they believed would be a higher quality style of Chianti. These wines eventually became known as the [...] "Super Tuscans'.|$|E

2500|$|An {{idealised}} grating {{is considered}} here {{which is made}} up of a set of slits of spacing d, that must be wider than the wavelength of interest to cause diffraction. Assuming a plane wave of monochromatic light of wavelength λ with normal incidence (perpendicular to the grating), each slit in the grating acts as a quasi point-source from which light propagates in all directions (although this is typically limited to a hemisphere). After light interacts with the grating, the diffracted light is composed of the sum of interfering wave components emanating from each slit in the grating. At any given point in space through which diffracted light may pass, the path length to each slit in the grating will vary. Since the path length varies, generally, so will the phases of the waves at that point from each of the slits, and thus will add or subtract from one another to create <b>peaks</b> <b>and</b> <b>valleys,</b> through the phenomenon of additive and destructive interference. When the path difference between the light from adjacent slits is equal to half the wavelength, , the waves will all be out of phase, and thus will cancel each other to create points of minimum intensity. Similarly, when the path difference is λ, the phases will add together and maxima will occur. The maxima occur at angles θm, which satisfy the relationship [...] = |m|, where θm is the angle between the diffracted ray and the grating's normal vector, and d is the distance from the center of one slit {{to the center of the}} adjacent slit, and m is an integer representing the propagation-mode of interest.|$|E
