500|$|Lying Cat: Lying Cat {{is a large}} female talking feline {{companion}} to The Will who aids him in his work. Green in color and with yellow stripes, she {{has the ability to}} detect when a verbal statement is a lie, which she indicates by saying [...] "Lying". Her power is limited to the state of the mind of the person speaking: she can detect deliberate deception, but cannot detect a falsehood if a given statement is believed to be true by the speaker. According to Izabel, Lying Cats always <b>play</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>rules,</b> an allusion to the fact that a Lying Cat must also admit ethical truths as well as factual ones. When Gwendolyn, who becomes Lying Cat's ally, accidentally kills a man, Izabel says that they had no right to execute that man in his home, which Lying Cat cannot deny. It has been revealed that Lying Cat was the runt of her seven-kitten litter, which has caused her distress.|$|E
500|$|Lucas North {{appears to}} be a person divided between who he was prior to his incarceration and who he has become since. Richard Armitage has {{described}} Lucas as [...] "very ambiguous, but quite open with everybody" [...] and [...] "a bit of a double-edged sword, so he's not completely white. He's a bit of a dark horse." [...] He is also described as having [...] "no knowledge of how damaged he is emotionally, until memories start to work their way to the surface." [...] Following his release from prison, glimpses of him adjusting to the outside world—such as a scene in episode two in which Lucas lies on the floor rather than in a bed in order to sleep—reveal to the audience how much he is struggling, though he keeps it hidden from his teammates. Lucas also fights very hard to be accepted and to regain Harry's trust, but he does not always <b>play</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>rules.</b> In the series seven finale, Lucas admits to having blamed Harry for his ...|$|E
500|$|Since the {{intention}} of DKP is to allocate scarce resources amongst guild members, they can be understood {{in the context of}} virtual capital. [...] Players [...] "earn" [...] and [...] "spend" [...] DKP, bidding in a system of auctions for an item which holds some value for them. [...] DKP are referred to as [...] "currency" [...] a guild leader pays his [...] "employees". [...] Despite these analogies, DKP remain a kind of [...] "private money system", allowing guilds to mete out these otherwise unachievable items in return for participation and discipline. [...] The points cannot be traded or redeemed outside the guild and are not actually part of the game itself; they are tracked on external websites. [...] In contrast, the virtual currencies created by game developers are part of the game software and may be traded between players without respect to any social affiliation. [...] Just as DKP is valueless outside the guild, parlaying of economic capital for DKP (paying real world currency in exchange for DKP) is almost unheard of. [...] Because guilds mete out DKP in return for participation in events the functional result is that DKP serve less as currency or material capital and more as what Torill Mortensen refers to as a [...] "social stabilizer"; players who attend raids more frequently or <b>play</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>rules</b> reap the rewards while more [...] "casual" [...] gamers do not. [...] This provides an incentive for players to remain in the social system (the guild) longer than they might otherwise.|$|E

50|$|The {{player on}} {{the left of the}} winner of the bid ('declarer' is hardly used; in fact many refer to 'tricks' as 'sets') will begin the game. The only {{exception}} - {{and this is not a}} universal rule - is in no-trump games, the winner of the bid will begin the game. <b>The</b> other less-agreed-upon <b>rule</b> is <b>the</b> drawing of trumps. Some people <b>play</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>rule</b> that <b>the</b> drawing of trumps can only begin when the player drawing trumps already has a void suit or when trump has been broken (i.e. a trump card has already been <b>played),</b> some <b>play</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>rule</b> that drawing can be done at any point in the game, while most <b>play</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>rule</b> that trumps can only be drawn when the trump suit has been broken. At the end of the game, players remain in the same seats but due to the nature of partner determination, everyone could begin with new partners in the next round.|$|R

But you know the United States government ordered the inspectors {{to withdraw from the}} modalities without conferring with the Security Council. It took Iraqis by surprise.

2500|$|Wilkerson made {{comments}} in November 2005 {{to the effect}} that the Vice President had decided that the Third Geneva Convention (regarding treatment of POWs) would not apply to [...] "al-Qaeda and al-Qaeda look-alike detainees" [...] and that the February 2002 White House memorandum regarding the [...] "Humane Treatment of Taliban and al Qaeda Detainees" [...] contained a loophole designed to avoid applying the Geneva convention to the detainees. According to Wilkerson, the phrase [...] "the detainees (should) be treated humanely and, to the extent appropriate and consistent with military necessity, {{in a manner consistent with}} the principles of Geneva" [...] was a way to appear to <b>play</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>rules</b> while in reality, the [...] "military necessities" [...] would always overrule concerns about the plight of the detainees. Wilkerson said that this was result of Cheney and Rumsfeld working in collaboration to undermine the standard decision-making process of the White House (which included his superior, Colin Powell).|$|E
2500|$|During an October 6 news conference, President Barack Obama said, [...] "I {{think it}} expresses the frustrations the American people feel, {{that we had}} the biggest {{financial}} crisis since the Great Depression, huge collateral damage all throughout the country ... and yet you're still seeing some of the same folks who acted irresponsibly trying to fight efforts {{to crack down on the}} abusive practices that got us into this in the first place." [...] When Jake Tapper of ABC News pushed Obama to explain the fact that his administration hasn't prosecuted any Wall Street executives who didn't <b>play</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>rules,</b> he replied, [...] "One of the biggest problems about the collapse of Lehman's and the subsequent financial crisis and the whole subprime lending fiasco is that a lot of that stuff wasn't necessarily illegal; it was just immoral or inappropriate or reckless." [...] On October 18, when interviewed by ABC news, he said [...] "in some ways, they’re not that different from some of the protests that we saw coming from the Tea Party. Both on the left and the right, I think people feel separated from their government. They feel that their institutions aren’t looking out for them." ...|$|E
2500|$|European Union law is {{a system}} of rules {{operating}} within the member states of the European Union. Since {{the founding of the}} Coal and Steel Community after World War II, the EU has developed the aim to [...] "promote peace, its values and the well-being of its peoples". The EU has political institutions, social and economic policies, which transcend nation-states for the purpose of cooperation and human development. According to its Court of Justice the EU represents [...] "a new legal order of international law". The EU's legal foundations are the Treaty on European Union and the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, unanimously agreed by the governments of 28 member states. New members may join, if they agree to <b>play</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>rules</b> of the organisation, and old members may leave according to their [...] "own constitutional requirements". People are entitled to participate through the Parliament, and their national governments in shaping the legislation the EU makes. The Commission has the initiative for legislation, the Council of the European Union represents member state governments, the Parliament is elected by European citizens, while the Court of Justice is meant to uphold {{the rule of law and}} human rights. As the Court of Justice has said, the EU is [...] "not merely an economic union" [...] but is intended to [...] "ensure social progress and seek the constant improvement of the living and working conditions of their peoples".|$|E

2500|$|Luchadores are {{traditionally}} {{divided into two}} categories, rudos (lit. [...] "tough guys", who are [...] "bad guys", or [...] "heels"), who bend or break the rules, and técnicos (the [...] "good guys", or [...] "faces", literally [...] "technicians"), who <b>play</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>rules</b> and their moves are much more complex and spectacular. [...] Técnicos tend to have very formal combat styles, close to Greco-Roman wrestling and martial arts techniques, whereas rudos tend to be brawlers. [...] Técnicos playing the [...] "good guy" [...] role, and rudos playing the [...] "bad guy" [...] role is very characteristic of Mexican lucha libre, which differs from U.S. professional wrestling, where many technical wrestlers {{play the role of}} heels (e.g., Kurt Angle), and many brawlers play as [...] "faces" [...] (e.g., Stone Cold Steve Austin & The Rock). Although rudos often resort to using underhanded tactics, they are still expected to live up to a luchador code of honor. For instance, a luchador who has lost a wager match would prefer to endure the humiliation of being unmasked or having his head shaved rather than live with the shame that would come from not honoring his bet. Rudos have also been known to make the transition into técnicos after a career defining moment, {{as was the case with}} Blue Demon, who decided to become a técnico after his wrestling partner, Black Shadow, was unmasked by the legendary Santo. Tag teams are sometimes composed of both rudos and técnicos in what are called parejas increibles (incredible pairings). Parejas increibles highlight the conflict between a luchadors desire to win and his contempt for his partner.|$|E
