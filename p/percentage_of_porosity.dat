The subject tight gas reservoir consists of a finely laminated siltstone sequence; extensive cementation and moderate clay content are the primary causes of low permeability. SANS/USANS experiments run at ambient pressure and temperature conditions on lithologically-diverse sub-samples of three core plugs demonstrated that a broad pore size distribution could be interpreted from the data. Two interpretation methods were used to evaluate total porosity, pore size distribution and surface area and the results were compared to independent estimates derived from helium porosimetry (connected porosity) and low-pressure N 2 and CO 2 adsorption (accessible surface area and pore size distribution). The pore structure of the three samples as interpreted from SANS/USANS is fairly uniform, with small differences in the small-pore range (< 2000 Å), possibly related to differences in degree of cementation, and mineralogy, in particular clay content. Total porosity interpreted from USANS/SANS is similar to (but systematically higher than) helium porosities measured on the whole core plug. Both methods were used to estimate the <b>percentage</b> <b>of</b> open <b>porosity</b> expressed here as a ratio <b>of</b> connected <b>porosity,</b> as established from helium adsorption, to the total porosity, as estimated from SANS/USANS techniques. Open porosity appears to control permeability (determined using pressure and pulse-decay techniques), with the highest permeability sample also having the highest <b>percentage</b> <b>of</b> open <b>porosity.</b> Surface area, as calculated from low-pressure N 2 and CO 2 adsorption, is significantly less than surface area estimates from SANS/USANS, which is due in part to limited accessibility of the gases to all pores. The similarity between N 2 and CO 2 -accessible surface area suggests an absence of microporosity in these samples, which is in agreement with SANS analysis. A core gamma ray profile run on the same core from which the core plug samples were taken correlates to profile permeability measurements run on the slabbed core.

Lengthy polymerization time being one of them and in order to overcome this fact microwave curing method was recommended. Unavailability of specially designed microwavable acrylic resin made it unpopular. Therefore, in this study, conventional heat cure PMMA was polymerized by microwave energy. Aim and Objectives: This study was designed to evaluate the surface porosities in PMMA cured by conventional water bath and microwave energy and compare it with microwavable acrylic resin cured by microwave energy. Materials and Methods: Wax samples were obtained by pouring molten wax into a metal mold of 25 mm × 12 mm × 3 mm dimensions. These samples were divided into three groups namely C, CM, and M. Group C denotes conventional heat cure PMMA cured by water bath method, CM denotes conventional heat cure PMMA cured by microwave energy, M denotes specially designed microwavable acrylic denture base resin cured by microwave energy. After polymerization, each sample was scanned in three pre-marked areas for surface porosities using the optical microscope. As per the literature available, this instrument is being used {{for the first time to}} measure the porosity in acrylic resin. It is a reliable method of measuring area of surface pores.

[...] Wichita State University, College of Engineering, Dept. of Mechanical EngineeringThe {{orthotropic}} {{nature of}} composites provides excellent {{performance in the}} fiber direction, but it is susceptible to failure in the orthogonal direction. Failure due to the delamination is limited to composites, and has an adverse consequence on its mechanical properties. The interlaminar tensile (ILT) strength of a composite part is compromised by delamination failure caused mainly by the applied loads and environmental factors. This phenomenon creates a challenge in design and manufacturing of composite parts for the aerospace industry. This study is focused on improving the ILT strength of a curved composite laminate by suppressing failure modes associated with free edge effects and to evaluate the ILT strength of a curved section with various porosities. Composite panels were built on an angle bend tool using the fiber reinforced carbon/epoxy tape pre-pregs. The manufactured panels were machined using a water jet to produce test coupons as required by ASTM 6415. The curved sections of the test coupons were reinforced with metal clamps manufactured from aluminum 7075 -O alloy and another pre-preg material (glass fiber reinforced pre-preg). The observed ILT strength of the reinforced coupons {{was found to be}} much higher than the baseline because the reinforcement reduces the effects of the stresses induced by the free edge of the composite specimen. There was a 25 % increase in the interlaminar tensile strength for the coupons reinforced by the metal clamps and a 21 % increase in strength for the coupons reinforced with the glass pre-preg material. We also observed that with various <b>percentages</b> <b>of</b> <b>porosity,</b> the ILT strength varied significantly, which needs to be addressed in the future studies. The failure of the coupons occurred due to the delaminations caused by the interlaminar stresses under the applied loads.

40|$|Casting defects could largely {{affect the}} {{mechanical}} properties of casting products. A number of test pieces made of ductile iron (EN-GJS- 400 - 18 -LT) with {{different levels of}} shrinkage porosity were prepared and then tensile and fatigue tests were performed to investigate the impact of shrinkage porosity on their mechanical properties. The {{results showed that the}} tensile strength decreases linearly with increasing of the shrinkage porosity. The tensile elongation decreases sharply with the increase of the shrinkage porosity mainly due to the non-uniform plastic deformation. The fatigue life also dramatically declines with increasing of the porosity and follows a power law relationship with the area <b>percentage</b> <b>of</b> <b>porosity.</b> The existence of the shrinkage porosity made the fatigue fracture complex. The shrinkage pores, especially those close to the surface usually became the crack initiation sites. For test pieces with less porosity, the fatigue fracture was clearly composed of crack initiation, propagation, and overloading. While for samples with high level of porosity, multiple crack initiation sites were observed...|$|E

40|$|This study {{describes}} the electrochemical characterization of N-doped carbon xerogels {{in the form}} of microspheres and of carbon aerogels with varied porosities and surface oxygen complexes. The interfacial capacitance of N-doped carbon xerogels decreased with increased micropore surface area as determined by N 2 adsorption at − 196 °C. The interfacial capacitance showed a good correlation with the areal NXPS concentration, and the best correlation with the areal concentration of pyrrolic or pyridonic nitrogen functionalities. The gravimetric capacitance decreased with greater xerogel microsphere diameter. The interfacial capacitance of carbon aerogels increased with higher <b>percentage</b> <b>of</b> <b>porosity</b> as determined from particle and true densities. The interfacial capacitance showed a linear relationship with the areal oxygen concentration and with the areal concentrations of CO- and CO 2 -evolving groups.

40|$|Aim This study {{evaluated}} a new porcine bone {{model to}} test the primary stability of different implants, analyzing Micro-CT, insertion torque, and pull-out strength. Materials and methods Bone cylinders were prepared from porcine bone and separated into 2 groups: 10 high density bone cylinders (HDB), and 10 low density bone cylinders (LDB). Then, 3 D pre-implant analyses were performed, evaluating tridimensional bone density (ratio of trabecular bone volume and total tomographic volume, BV/TV), trabecular separation; <b>percentage</b> <b>of</b> closed pores; <b>percentage</b> <b>of</b> open pores; <b>percentage</b> <b>of</b> total <b>porosity,</b> in 3 bone levels (L 1 bone volume corresponding to the internal part of the threads; L 2 corresponding to the area between 0 to 0. 5 mm {{from the end of}} threads; L 3 corresponding to the area between 0. 5 to 1. 5 mm from the end of threads). Twenty implants of two different macrostructures were inserted in the bone cylinders, and divided into 4 groups (5 implants each) : Group 1, e-Fix HE implant placed in HDB cylinder; Group 2, e-Fix HE implant in LDB cylinder; Group 3, e-Fix HE Silver implant placed in HDB cylinder; Group 4, e-Fix HE Silver implant in LDB cylinder. The insertion torque was recorded and bone cylinders were re-evaluated by Micro-CT (post-implant analysis). Then a pull-out strength test was performed. Results 3 D analysis showed that pre- and post-implants intra-groups evaluation had statistically significant differences in Group 3 and 4, for all tomographic parameters assessed. Group 3 showed the best values for biomechanical tests (Friedman Test, p< 0. 05). Conclusion This methodology can produce standardized bone cylinders of high and low bone density, in which different implant designs are able to promote different effects, evidenced by biomechanical and image analysis...|$|R
40|$|Abstract — The {{effect of}} foundry variables, such as mold {{materials}} and pouring temperature on the microstructure, dendrite arm spacing, percentage porosity and mechanical properties of as-cast LM 25 Al alloy was investigated. The microstructure of the as-cast samples {{was characterized by}} optical microscopy. The {{results showed that the}} secondary dendrite arm spacing (SDAS, λ) is well refined by pouring at higher temperatures in metal mold compared to greensand mold. The SDAS decreases with increasing pouring temperature due to multiplication of nucleation sites in the superheating liquid melt. The <b>percentage</b> <b>porosity</b> <b>of</b> the cast specimens decreases with increasing pouring temperatures and is lowest for metal mold at highest pouring temperature. The mechanical properties of the as-cast LM 25 Al alloy, such as hardness and ultimate tensile strength increases as pouring temperature increases. However, <b>percentage</b> elongation <b>of</b> the as-cast alloy decreases with increasing pouring temperatures. Among the mold materials, permanent metal mold casting has shown to impart better quality than greensand mold casting...|$|R
40|$|Synergy can be {{achieved}} using multiple imaging modalities to reveal cortical bone adaptation at organ, tissue and ultrastructural levels. Peripheral quantitative computed tomography (pQCT) measurement showed significant regional variations of cortical bone mineral density (cBMD) in the distal tibia and distal radius, independent of menopausal status. The higher cBMD was related to its prevalent compressive stress. Circularly polarized light (CPL) microscopy supported this by showing a preferred transverse to oblique collagen fibre orientation. Quantitative backscattered electron (QBSE) imaging study of osteon morphometry and degree of mineralisation in the cadaveric tibia and radius showed that the variation of cBMD was {{due to differences in}} <b>percentage</b> <b>of</b> intracortical <b>porosity</b> (IP), rather than to the variation of mineralisation. The distal tibia had significantly lower cBMD than the distal radius. This lower cBMD was compensated by having greater cortical thickness, polar moment of inertia, and collagen fibre orientation index. The tibia, being subject to habitual dynamic compressive loading as compared with the non-weight-bearing nature of the radius, may activate a higher remodelling rate, which does not allow full secondary mineralisation. This was evidenced in the study showed lower cBMD and greater <b>percentage</b> <b>of</b> IP; thus, the compensatory increase in bone geometry is meant to withstand the sustained bend and torsion loading in this region. This chapter demonstrates that compressive loading is more osteogenic bringing about greater regional BMD. The design of exercise intervention programs to enhance bone quality should consider the strain mode effect. Compensation between the material density and structure is evidenced which allows bone strengthening. Regional bone adaptation, as revealed by multiple imaging modalities, allows better understanding of changes at different levels of bone organization.
