40|$|The work {{presents}} the results of investigation centred around the selection of a ceramic slurry composition if ceramic fibre is applied as a component of moulding material used for the lost wax technology. Producing a ceramic material of assumed parameters demands for changing the surface properties of the mineral grains. The critical concentration of solid particles or the gel point depends on the size of mineral particles, their shape and ability to aggregate. This ability has been achieved by modifying their surface properties by adding some polymer and the wetting agent (surfactant), which are adsorbed. Using the fibre material has required developing a method of its applying to the pattern set. The technology of multi-layer spraying has been recognised as the most advantageous one. The performed laboratory experiments have allowed for determining both the material composition and the parameters of its applying, such as air pressure, nozzle diameter, and the spraying distance for gravity <b>pneumatic</b> <b>spraying</b> gun...|$|E
40|$|A {{variety of}} thin (10 - 1000 nm) metal oxide films have been {{deposited}} on flat glass substrates by the pyrolysis of an aerosol of metal acetylacetonates in a suitable carrier. The optical characteristics and {{thickness of the}} films have been measured and particular interest has centered {{on the use of}} a novel pin on disc apparatus to measure the physical durability of such thin films. Characteristic friction/penetration force traces have been established for 1 st Series transition metal oxide films and some ranking in terms of 'hardness' established. The use of SnO_ 2 - coated glass for electrodes in a light modulator cell has been examined. The electrochromic behaviour of a silver matrix in DMSO electrolyte has been observed in a small glass cell and by cyclic voltammetry on a vitreous carbon electrode. Optimum conditions for practical light-shutter have been established and electrode processes elucidated. A corrosion study of mild steel in two different water/organic electrolytes of industrial importance has been carried out. Mechanisms to account for the corrosion observed have been presented. Support for the usual anodic reaction is presented Fe #-># Fe" 2 "+ + 2 e but in the electrolyte operated at low pH film formation of a water soluble organic 'tar' has been confirmed and the proposed reaction Fe" 2 "+ + H_ 2 O #-># FeOH"+ + H"+ leads to a local increase in [H"+] which accounts for the observed corrosion rate. In contrast, corrosion behaviour in the pH 8 electrolyte supports the view that the rate limiting reduction reaction is possibly oxygen (or water) reduction although some contribution from an organic 'impurity' cannot be ruled out. Coatings of Fe_ 3 O_ 4 on mild steel have been prepared by CVD using <b>pneumatic</b> <b>spraying</b> techniques and the corrosion behaviour of coated electrodes in organic-phosphate electrolyte (pH 8) has been examined.

40|$|Pneumatic {{sprayers}} {{are widely}} used in vineyards due to their very fine droplet size, which makes the drift risk to become an important problem to be considered. The {{aim of this study}} was to assess the effect of the spout diameter at the release point on the spray droplet size and uniformity achieved for different liquid flow rates (LFR) and air flow rates (AFR). A test bench was developed to simulate a real pneumatic sprayer under laboratory conditions, and it was empirically adjusted to match the air pressure conditions as closely as possible to real working conditions. Two positions of insertion of the liquid hose, the conventional position (CP) and an alternative position (AP), were tested for three LFRs, 1. 00, 1. 64, and 2. 67 Lmin- 1, and four AFRs, 0. 280, 0. 312, 0. 345, and 0. 376 m 3 s- 1. The air speed decrease between the two insertion points of the liquid hose was measured. A Malvern SprayTec® instrument was used to measure the droplet size, and the D 50, D 10, and D 90 parameter values were obtained. The relative SPAN factor (RSF) was also calculated. A model to predict variations in D 50 was fitted using the aforementioned parameters. The results show that variations in the diameter of the spout significantly change the droplet size, producing a mean increase of 59. 45 % in D 50 and similar increases in D 10 and D 90. The model developed to predict variations in D 50 has a very high degree of accuracy (R 2 = 0. 945). The relative decrease in the air speed along the spout did not present significant differences for the different airflow rates tested. The results of the study show that the droplet size produced in <b>pneumatic</b> <b>spraying</b> can be modified easily by varying the air spout dimensions. This should be taken into account by manufacturers from a design point of view. Postprint (author's final draft...|$|E
40|$|The {{immobilization}} of antibodies on silica surfaces {{has been}} a wide and common practice via cross-linking {{with the formation of}} covalent bonds between surface and antibody. The formation of antibody thin films on solid surfaces using <b>pneumatic</b> <b>spray</b> (PS) as the deposition technique and the analysis of the surface morphology of these films were investigated during this study. The <b>pneumatic</b> <b>spray</b> method was compared with the covalent bonding method Avidin-Biotin Bridge (ABB). The intensities and capture efficiency tests showed similar results for both techniques with a lower signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) for the PS deposited films. Specificity tests suggested that the bio-sensitivity of the antibody films that were pneumatically sprayed maintained their capture abilities after the immobilization process. Analysis obtained from the attenuated total reflectance Fourier transform infrared ATR-FTIR support these results indicating that the antibodies retained their native structure and chemical stability thorough the induced physisorption process. The <b>pneumatic</b> <b>spray</b> films also preserve mechanical stability by adhering to the surface after the rinsing procedures. Capture efficiency was tested for both immobilization techniques, the results of which were similar. The <b>pneumatic</b> <b>spray</b> technique was also tested using a diverse range of deposition times. It was shown that a 2 minute deposition time was sufficient to produce a film with similar capture efficiency to the avidin-biotin bridge technique. The surface density obtained for the 2 minute deposition was 9. 05 ng/mm 2, which is higher than the range of 2. 2 to 4. 74 ng/mm 2 reported for the avidin-biotin bridge technique[1 - 3]. The contact angle measurements for the <b>pneumatic</b> <b>spray</b> films showed a higher hydrophobicity compared with the avidin-biotin bridge films. This is due to the higher surface roughness obtained for the avidin-biotin bridge films, a higher surface density for the PS and the random orientation of the antibodies in the <b>pneumatic</b> <b>spray</b> films. A study of shelf life showed that the <b>pneumatic</b> <b>spray</b> technique produces stable films {{that can be used for}} as long 100 days (study performed only up to 100 days) with similar capture efficiency to those prepared in the same day. To further understand the improvement in capture efficiency of the <b>pneumatic</b> <b>spray</b> films, the surface morphology was investigated to determine its influence in the cell adhesion process. The surface was characterized by several different techniques: ellipsometry to determine the thickness of the films, atomic force microscopy (AFM) to calculate the surface roughness, optical microscopy to identify particle formation during antibody immobilization process, fluorescent microscopy and sandwich fluorescent immunoassay to observe the immobilization patterns of antibodies and antigens on the surface, contact angle measurements to analyze the wettability of the antibody films and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) to confirm the presence of antibody on both deposition methods and to propose a growth model for the <b>pneumatic</b> <b>spray</b> deposition technique. A possible explanation for the similar results of capture efficiency for both techniques can be attributed to three main factors. First, the antibodies retained their native structure thorough the induced physisorption process allowing then to capture antigen normally. Second, the lack of orientation of the antibodies in the pneumatic films was compensated by high surface density thereby offering more binding sites to capture antigens. Third, hydrophobic surfaces are favorable to cell adhesion, therefore the high hydrophobicity of the <b>pneumatic</b> <b>spray</b> films increases the capture efficiency. It is important to mention that the time that it takes to produce the immunoassay surfaces was reduced dramatically from more than twenty four hours for the avidin-biotin bridge films to only a few minutes for the <b>pneumatic</b> <b>spray</b> films. In addition, <b>pneumatic</b> <b>spray</b> films significantly reduce the amount of materials and chemicals used in the deposition process. These factors make the <b>pneumatic</b> <b>spray</b> technique an excellent technique for the immobilization of antibodies on glass slides for commercial bio-sensor devices...|$|R
40|$|To {{reduce the}} high surface {{roughness}} of additive manufactured (AM) products, typically a post-treatment is required. Subtractive post-treatments are often performed {{by hand and}} are therefore expensive and time consuming, whereas conventional additive post-treatments, such as <b>pneumatic</b> <b>spray</b> coating, require large quantities of coating material. Ultrasonic spray coating, in contrast, is an additive post-treatment technology capable of applying coatings in an efficient way, resulting in less material usage. In this paper, we investigate {{the application of the}} ultrasonic spray coating process and the final properties of the coated AM part by applying a thin coating to reduce surface roughness of the AM substrate and to impart hydrophobic functionality. The hydrophobic coating is applied onto flat selective laser sintered (SLS) surfaces prepared from polyamide 12 (PA 12) having a surface roughness of Ra = 20 µm. The hydrophobic coating consists of 5 wt % polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) in acetone. The coated substrates are analyzed for roughness using a profilometer, a contact angle using a goniometer, and a coating uniformity and thickness using light and scanning electron microscopes. The layer formation applying the ultrasonic spray coating is studied and compared with layer formation using <b>pneumatic</b> <b>spray</b> coating. It is found that a roughness reduction down to 5 µm was achieved via an ultrasonic spray coating with 30 layers of PVDF solution. It is shown in cross-section electron microscopy pictures that, {{due to the nature of}} the ultrasonically generated droplets, the rough and porous surface of the SLS surface is filled with the PVDF material after which the roughness is reduced by adding a thin layer on top. In comparison to a standard industry-applied <b>pneumatic</b> <b>spray</b> coating process, the results obtained from ultrasonic spray coating show less material usage, a reduced roughness, and a better filling of the pores, obviously resulting in optimized adhesion...|$|R

The XRD analysis showed that the obtained crystalline structure of the films is tetragonal β-Bi 2 O 3 for both glass and silica. DRS showed the broad absorbance spectra of the films, correlated to β-Bi 2 O 3 with an energy band gap of 2. 4 eV. FESEM showed that the morphology of the films was different according to the substrate. In the case of corning glass, random non-compact distribution of particleswas observed while over silica discs overlapped sheets of β-Bi 2 O 3 were seen. This is probably due to differences in thewetting and evaporation rate of the sprayed droplets. During photodiscoloration of anionic indigo carmine (IC) dye solution, the β-Bi 2 O 3 coated silica was found more effective than the coated glass, response associated to the larger interaction between the dye molecules and catalysts assisted by the roughness and porosity induced by the silica. Furthermore, photocatalytic evaluation of coated silica in discoloration of other two organic dyes: cationic rhodamine B (RhB) and anionic acid blue 113 (AB) revealed that adsorption and interaction of the dye molecules with coated films could vary due to the presence of different functional and branched groups that overall affect the photocatalytic process, the kinetic rate of discoloration and the TOC analysis.

Spray of alcoholic solutions results in thinner but more compact films with reduced (0 0 12) orientation, Eg of ca. 2. 0 eV, and no chlorine contamination when deposited at 330  °C. According to XPS, the films have uniform concentration of the elements through the film thickness, spray of sulfur-rich solutions ([In]/[S]= 1 / 6) results in the films with lower oxygen content...|$|R

The effect of precursor molarity on structural, optical and electrical properties has been studied. The XRD {{lines of the}} deposited NiO were enhanced with increasing precursor molarity due to {{the improvement of the}} films crystallinity. It was shown that the crystalline size of the deposited thin films was calculated using Debye-Scherer formula and found in the range between 9 and 47 nm. The optical properties have been discussed in this work. The absorbance (A), the transmittance (T) and the reflectance (R) were measured and calculated. Band gap energy {{is considered one of the}} most important optical parameter, therefore measured and found ranging between 3. 64 and 3. 86 eV. The NiO thin film reduces the light reflection for visible range light. The increase of the electrical conductivity to maximum value of 0. 0896 (Ω cm) – 1 can be explained by the increase in carrier concentration of the films. A good electrical conductivity of the NiO thin film is obtained due to the electrically low sheet resistance. NiO can be applied in different electronic and optoelectronic applications due to its high band gap, high transparency and good electrical conductivity...|$|R
40|$|We {{demonstrate}} the high precision C isotopic {{analysis of a}} series of purified albumins by liquid chromatography-combustion isotope ratio mass spectrometry (IRMS) by using direct aqueous liquid injection. Albumins from 18 species and albumens from chicken and turkey egg were obtained from a commercial source and shown to be of > 98 % purity by capillary zone electrophoresis and high-performance liquid chromatography. One microliter of an aqueous protein solution with a total of < 40 -pmol protein (2. 5 μg), which contained about 150 -nmol C, was injected directly into a flowing stream of high-performance liquid chromatography grade water. The solution passed through a <b>pneumatic</b> nebulizer, was <b>sprayed</b> onto a moving wire, passed through a drying oven, and was combusted in a furnace. After the water of combustion was removed, the resulting CO 2 gas was directed to a high precision IRMS instrument operated in continuous flow mode. The average precision across the 20 samples analyzed was SD(δ 13 C) = 0. 45 %., and the average accuracy was δ 13 C < 0. 4 %. compared to aliquots analyzed by conventional preparation by using combustion tubes and dual inlet analysis. The observed isotope ratio range was about - 22. 5 %. < δ 13 CPDB < - 16 %. as expected for modern materials from a natural source. These results demonstrate rapid, high precision, and accurate C isotopic analysis of untreated macromolecules in an aqueous stream by liquid source IRMS...|$|R
40|$|Solar cells {{generate}} {{electrical power}} by direct conversion of solar radiation into electricity using semiconductors. Once produced, the solar cells {{do not require}} the use of water; operate in silence and can be easily installed almost everywhere, as solar panels with low technological risk. In this thesis new photovoltaic materials and solar cells are investigated. From the beginning of the semiconductor era, silicon has been present; the semiconductor theory improved with the silicon technology, almost taking the idealized models to reality in within silicon. In the recent years plenty of new natural and artificially produced materials have seen the light; some of them are still waiting to be understood and explained by a new theory that has to be experimentally proved right. The clue for a better and faster progress is to work in a multidisciplinary frame; as this thesis shows, all research and knowledge has to have future protections and possibilities of been used in the benefit of our society. Today, the photovoltaic technology (PV) based on silicon solar cells dominates the market. The thin film PV such as GaAs, Cu(In,Ga) Se 2 (GIGS) and CdTe have reached power conversion efficiencies above 20 % which makes them industrially interesting despite the use of scare and/or very toxic elements. Researchers and investors are expectant for a new stable, eco-friendly, inexpensive, fast and easy to produce material {{that could be used in}} a big scale and long term for photovoltaic terrestrial applications. Some years ago it was believed that this ideal material was near to be confirmed when the reflectors were on a new chalcogenide material: Cu 2 ZnSn(SxSe 1 -x) 4 (CZTSSe) called kesterite after its crystal structure. This semiconductor is very attractive due to its constituent elements, semiconductor properties. Its similarity with GIGS and compatibility with the already existing industrial processes made possible its rapid power conversion efficiency rise as absorber material in thin film solar cells. Through the years kesterite has been found to be a challenging material due to the energetically feasible mixture of stannite and kesterite structures, the high probability of defects, and the narrowness of the optimum compositional region (compared with that of chalcopyrites) that eases the formation of secondary phases limiting the efficiency of the solar cells. Recently, CZTSSe thin film solar cells with certified efficiency of 12. 6 % were produced by IBM; synthesized by spin-coating using a hydrazine-based pure solution approach on a soda-lime glass (SLG) Mo coated substrate. The use of hydrazine is the key for the record as well its mayor drawback however it demonstrates the robustness of the solution-based techniques. In this thesis the use of a cool-wall vertical <b>pneumatic</b> <b>spray</b> pyrolysis system (SP) is demonstrated as a synthesis technique of CZTS kesterite thin films from water and alcohol-based precursor solutions containing metal salts and thiourea. In the course of this thesis, the possibilities and limitations of this synthesis technique and the resulting films are explored in the frame of system- and solution-related parameters. The SP system used in this thesis is sophisticate and advantageous; is able of reproduce the open-air conditions used in typical spray systems but also it is capable of grow films by spraying in an oxygen-free atmospheres such as Ar or Ar-H 2 or any other. It was completely new spray approach by the year of the publication of our first repot (2013) with a 0. 5 % efficient working solar cell. A remarkable efficiency value by the time of publication if considered the combo challenge: material + deposition technique. In this thesis, air, Ar and Ar-H 2 were used as carrier gas and atmosphere, where the so sprayed films were studied in combination with other system parameters (solution flux, time of spraying, substrate temperature, etc.) and some solution related parameters (solvent, metal precursors concentration, solution stability, etc.). To obtain device grade films, the sprayed kesterite ought to be annealed; this annealing process is also subject of study in this thesis. One step annealing at high temperature (580 °C) at room pressure in S-containing reactive atmosphere was optimized for the CZTS-based thin films with efficiencies of 1. 4 %. To synthesize CZTSSe films, different annealing approaches were tried; one step room pressure annealing (at 550 °C) in Se- containing reactive atmosphere probed to be the optimum for sprayed kesterite from methanol-based precursor solutions for solar cells with the highest conversion efficiency of 1. 9 % obtained in this thesis. The results showed here open many new possibilities for the use of spray systems for the synthesis of PV quality materials for solar cells applications. En esta tesis se demuestra el uso de un sistema de spray pyrolysis utilizado para sintetizar kesterita de azufre puro (CZTS) un material que representa un reto tecnológico y científico en el campo de las celdas solares de películas delgadas. La síntesis de este material es llevada a cabo en un sistema de spray en atmosfera controlada en el marco de los parámetros del sistema y de la solución; evitando el uso de reactivos altamente peligrosos utilizando en su caso agua y alcoholes. Se demuestra la síntesis de materiales del tipo CZTSSe después de un proceso de selenización; las celdas solares resultantes muestran las posibilidades del material y del sistema...|$|R
