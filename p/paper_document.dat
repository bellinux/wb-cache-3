It consisted of a pink tri-fold <b>paper</b> <b>document,</b> laminated on one side. It contained a photo of the driver, their personal details and home address, and a listing of categories of vehicle they are licensed for, with any restrictions printed using a code format. The unlaminated side consisted of a section for any written in endorsements as well as a page with the term 'Driving licence' or its equivalents in a large number of languages.|$|E
25|$|The lettermail service {{allows the}} {{transmission}} of virtually any <b>paper</b> <b>document.</b> The 2015 and 2016 rate was 85 cents for a standard letter (30 g or less) and $1.20 for a letter between 30 g and 50 g. Rates usually increase in mid-January of each year (in 2014 the increase was delayed {{to the end of}} March); for ordinary letters (30 g or less), the 2014 rate was originally scheduled to be $0.65. The rate was regulated by a price-cap formula, linked to the inflation rate. The Corporation now has a “permanent” stamp that is valued at the domestic rate forever, eliminating the need to buy 1 cent stamps after a rate increase. The rates for lettermail are based on weight and size and determine whether the article falls into the aforementioned standard format or in the oversize one.|$|E

40|$|In this paper, {{we propose}} {{a notion of}} {{bridging}} personal and collaborative work {{through the use of}} <b>paper</b> <b>documents</b> which expands the notion of bridging paper and digital doc-ument. Based on ethnographic ¯eld researches, we found out that <b>paper</b> <b>documents</b> are taken to the collaborative working scene as a cohesive package of work, and they are handled as a symbol of work. By tracking the use of <b>paper</b> <b>documents</b> between the sequence of private and collaborative working situation, we think that we could seamlessly support the large area of working contexts by <b>paper</b> <b>documents.</b> We also report on an early implementation of our prototype system which seamlessly combine the use of <b>paper</b> and dig-ital <b>document</b> in the personal and collaborative situation. While the user handles digital documents at the personal working situation, he or she could transfer into paper docu-ments in collaborative working situation. 1...|$|R

40|$|<b>Paper</b> <b>documents</b> {{are often}} {{described}} as 'information rich', in contrast with electronic documents. This ethn ographic study examines Lotus NOTES in a sub-section of the Irish civil service, with particular reference to the concurrent use of electronic and <b>paper</b> <b>documents.</b> The sub-section examines disagreements with regard to claims by Irish citizens for particular government benefits. The study describes how meta-information contained in paper case files is perceived as necessary {{for the work of}} the organisation, thus restricting the use of electronic case files in NOTES as a shared information system. However, this reliance on paper files derives not only from the information rich properties of <b>paper</b> <b>documents,</b> but also from the desire of some workers to protect their occupational status by defining, as necessary for their job, information which is only available in <b>paper</b> <b>documents</b> and which only they can interpret. This dependence on <b>paper</b> <b>documents</b> also reduces the amount of information that can be shared within the organisation. This paper suggests that, only if the perceived threat posed by the information system were reduced in some way would user innovations in work practices and greater sharing of information within the organisation become possible...|$|R

50|$|EDI {{and other}} similar {{technologies}} save a company money by providing an alternative to, or replacing, information flows that require {{a great deal of}} human interaction and <b>paper</b> <b>documents.</b> Even when <b>paper</b> <b>documents</b> are maintained in parallel with EDI exchange, e.g. printed shipping manifests, electronic exchange and the use of data from that exchange reduces the handling costs of sorting, distributing, organizing, and searching <b>paper</b> <b>documents.</b> EDI and similar technologies allow a company {{to take advantage of the}} benefits of storing and manipulating data electronically without the cost of manual entry. Another advantage of EDI is the opportunity to reduce or eliminate manual data entry errors, such as shipping and billing errors, because EDI eliminates the need to rekey documents on the destination side. One very important advantage of EDI over <b>paper</b> <b>documents</b> is the speed in which the trading partner receives and incorporates the information into their system thus greatly reducing cycle times. For this reason, EDI can be an important component of just-in-time production systems.|$|R
