40|$|<b>Preconditioning</b> with brief {{ischemia}} {{before a}} sustained period of ischemia reduces infarct {{size in the}} perfused heart. A cultured chick ventricular myocyte model was developed to investigate the role of adenosine receptor subtypes in cardiac <b>preconditioning.</b> Brief hypoxic exposure, termed <b>preconditioning</b> hypoxia, prior to prolonged hypoxia, protected myocytes against injury induced by the prolonged hypoxia. Activation of the adenosine A 1 receptor with CCPA or the A 3 receptor with C 1 -IB-MECA can replace <b>preconditioning</b> hypoxia and simulate <b>preconditioning,</b> with a maximal effect at 100 nM. While activation of the A 2 a receptor by 1 microM CGS 21680 could not mimic <b>preconditioning,</b> its stimulation during <b>preconditioning</b> hypoxia, however, attenuated the protection against hypoxia-induced injury. Blockade of A 2 a receptors with the selective antagonist CSC (1 microM) during <b>preconditioning</b> hypoxia enhanced the protective effect of <b>preconditioning.</b> Nifedipine, which blocked the A 2 a receptor-mediated calcium entry, abolished the A 2 a agonist-induced attenuation of <b>preconditioning.</b> Isoproterenol, forskolin, and BayK 8644, which stimulated calcium entry, also attenuated <b>preconditioning.</b> Nifedipine blocked the increase in calcium uptake by these agents {{as well as their}} attenuating effect on <b>preconditioning.</b> The present study provides the first evidence that the adenosine A 3 receptor is present on ventricular myocytes and can mediate simulation of <b>preconditioning.</b> The data demonstrate, for the first time, that activation of the A 2 a receptor antagonizes the <b>preconditioning</b> effect of adenosine, with increased calcium entry during the <b>preconditioning</b> stimuli as a novel mechanism...|$|R

40|$|AbstractBackgroundMitochondrial KATP channel {{activation}} is {{an essential}} component of ischemic <b>preconditioning.</b> These channels are selectively opened by diazoxide and may be up-regulated by adenosine and nitric oxide. Therefore, pharmacological <b>preconditioning</b> with diazoxide in combination with adenosine and a nitric oxide donor (triple-combination pharmacological <b>preconditioning)</b> may enhance cardioprotection. Methods and resultsIsolated and perfused rat hearts underwent ischemic <b>preconditioning</b> with 3 cycles of 5 minutes of ischemia and 5 minutes of reperfusion before 5 minutes of oxygenated potassium cardioplegia and 35 minutes of ischemia. Pharmacological <b>preconditioning</b> was performed by adding adenosine, diazoxide, and a nitric oxide donor S-nitroso-N-acetyl-penicillamine each alone or in combinations for 25 minutes followed by 10 minutes washout before cardioplegic arrest. Only triple-combination pharmacological <b>preconditioning</b> conferred significant cardioprotection as documented by highly improved left ventricular function and limited creatine kinase release during reperfusion that was comparable to that afforded by ischemic <b>preconditioning.</b> Mitochondrial KATP channel activity assessed by flavoprotein oxidation was increased by diazoxide, but no further increase in flavoprotein oxidation was obtained by ischemic <b>preconditioning</b> and triple-combination pharmacological <b>preconditioning.</b> Significant activation of protein kinase C-ϵ was observed in only ischemic <b>preconditioning</b> and triple-combination pharmacological <b>preconditioning.</b> Pretreatment with the mitochondrial KATP channel inhibitor 5 -hydroxydecanoate or the protein kinase C inhibitor chelerythrine abrogated activation of protein kinase C-ϵ and cardioprotection afforded by ischemic <b>preconditioning</b> and triple-combination pharmacological <b>preconditioning.</b> ConclusionsIntegrated pharmacological <b>preconditioning</b> is not simply mediated by enhanced mitochondrial KATP channel activation, but is presumably mediated through amplified protein kinase C signaling promoted by coordinated interaction of adenosine, mitochondrial KATP channel activation, and nitric oxide...|$|R
40|$|Experiments {{were carried}} out to test the {{hypothesis}} that <b>preconditioning</b> reduces the impairment of recovery of cardiac mechanical function and that this effect is mediated by activation of adenosine A 1 receptors. Isolated hearts were Langendorff-perfused at 37 degrees C with oxygenated blood and paced at 3 Hz. They were divided into 5 groups, all subjected to 45 min global ischemia followed by one hour of reperfusion: 1) Control hearts (n = 7) which received no treatment or short ischemia before the long ischemia, 2) <b>preconditioned</b> hearts (n = 7), submitted to 5 -min zero-flow global ischemia, followed by 5 min reperfusion before the long ischemia, 3) hearts pretreated with sulfophenyltheophylline (SPT 100 microM) before <b>preconditioning</b> and long ischemia (n = 6), 4) hearts in which <b>preconditioning</b> was substituted by administration of 10 microM phenyl-isopropyl-adenosine (PIA) over 5 min, and 5) hearts in which <b>preconditioning</b> was substituted by the administration of 1. 5 mg adenosine over 5 min. Hemodynamic results show significant improvement of the postischemic recovery of left ventricular developed pressure (DP) by <b>preconditioning.</b> SPT pretreatment did not reverse the improvement of recovery, obtained by <b>preconditioning,</b> whereas PIA treatment could not mimic <b>preconditioning.</b> Adenosine treatment caused some improvement of recovery of DP, but which remained lower compared to that caused by <b>preconditioning.</b> The contracture developed during ischemia persisted in control hearts, whereas contracture disappeared in non-treated <b>preconditioned</b> hearts. SPT did not prevent the decrease in contracture by <b>preconditioning</b> although values remained slightly higher than in the non-treated <b>preconditioned</b> hearts. PIA did not substitute for <b>preconditioning</b> in preventing contracture. In the adenosine treated group, some decrease of contracture occurred during reperfusion, but values remained significantly higher than in <b>preconditioning.</b> We conclude that receptor A 1 activation is not the main mechanism underlying improved functional recovery conferred by <b>preconditioning</b> since an A 1 receptor blocker (SPT) cannot reverse the effect of <b>preconditioning</b> and an A 1 receptor agonist (PIA) cannot mimic it.

5|$|To {{resist the}} Vietnamese {{occupation}} of Kampuchea and the regime which they installed, the Khmer Rouge {{called on the}} Kampuchean people to unite and fight the Vietnamese.

40|$|Promising {{effects of}} ischemic <b>preconditioning</b> in renal transplantation. BackgroundIschemic <b>preconditioning,</b> a {{phenomenon}} induced by brief ischemia and reperfusion periods, renders an organ tolerant to subsequent prolonged ischemia. This study evaluated different schedules of <b>preconditioning</b> the kidney {{to assess the}} role of nitric oxide (NO) and {{determine the effects of}} <b>preconditioning</b> on kidney transplantation. MethodsIn study design A, to determine the optimum procedure of <b>preconditioning,</b> one-cycle schedules were assayed by occluding/releasing renal pedicles according to various warm ischemic (5, 10, 15, 20 min) and reperfusion (10, 20, 40 min) windows in Sprague-Dawley rats. Thereafter, warm renal ischemia was induced by clamping both pedicles for 40 minutes. Design B used the most suitable schedule found from the first study to obtain several groups, using either a direct nitric oxide donor (spermine NONOate) or two nitric oxide synthase (NOS) blockers (L-NAME and aminoguanidine), to determine whether NO mediates in renal <b>preconditioning.</b> To establish whether <b>preconditioning</b> reduces cold preservation damage, in Design C the optimum <b>preconditioning</b> schedule was used in syngeneic Lewis rats where <b>preconditioned</b> and non-preconditioned kidneys were transplanted after five hours of cold storage in Euro-Collins solution. ResultsThe best <b>preconditioning</b> schedule consisted of 15 minutes of warm ischemia and 10 minutes of reperfusion (Prec 15 / 10), since it was the only schedule that offered both functional and histological protection. The NO donor reproduced the ischemic <b>preconditioning.</b> Non-selective NOS blockade abolished the <b>preconditioning</b> and exacerbated ischemic damage, which was overcome by the addition of the NO donor. Selective blocking of inducible NOS also abolished the effects of <b>preconditioning.</b> Renal NO increased at the end of <b>preconditioning</b> in the Prec 15 / 10 group. Prolongation of the reperfusion window (20 or 40 min) abolished the <b>preconditioning</b> protection, although it was associated with a further increase in renal NO. As renal DNA oxidative injury paralleled NO, increasing with prolongation of reperfusion, it may account for the disappearance of <b>preconditioning.</b> Finally, the one-cycle <b>preconditioning</b> schedule offered an effective functional and histological protection against cold preservation damage in rat renal transplantation. ConclusionsFifteen minutes of warm ischemia and 10 minutes of reperfusion in the kidney is the most suitable one-cycle schedule for <b>preconditioning</b> since it protects from both warm and cold ischemia. The beneficial effect of <b>preconditioning</b> is related to the local production of NO, and we believe it has promising therapeutic value in clinical renal transplantation...|$|R

One example of a <b>preconditioning</b> program is a VAC- 45 program developed at Texas A&M University. This program requires a 45 -day post-weaning phase with proper nutritional program, specified animal health program, dehorning, castration, and bunk feeding. The purpose is to reduce stress from shipping calves at weaning, improve the immune system, and boost performance in the feedlot. <b>Preconditioning</b> is aimed at reducing industry costs for treating sick calves, estimated to be $ 35 per head annually (Lalman and Smith). However, <b>preconditioning</b> costs cow-calf owners considerably more than selling calves at weaning, about $ 60 per head.
