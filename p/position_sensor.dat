In the drive-by-wire system, the engine’s throttle body {{is controlled by the}} powertrain computer in response to the accelerator pedal position—allowing the computer to determine the optimal throttle body, fuel, and CVT settings based on the accelerator pedal position and its rate of travel.|$|E

This article presents concise definitions for the linearity, drift, bandwidth and resolution of <b>position</b> <b>sensors.</b> These definitions allow <b>position</b> <b>sensors</b> to be readily compared and the {{performance of}} feedback systems to be accurately predicted...|$|R
40|$|This paper studies an {{absolute}} <b>positioning</b> <b>sensor</b> for a high-speed maglev train and its fault diagnosis method. The absolute <b>positioning</b> <b>sensor</b> {{is an important}} sensor for the high-speed maglev train to accomplish its synchronous traction. It is used to calibrate the error of the relative <b>positioning</b> <b>sensor</b> {{which is used to}} provide the magnetic phase signal. On the basis of the analysis for the principle of the absolute <b>positioning</b> <b>sensor,</b> the paper describes the design of the sending and receiving coils and realizes the hardware and the software for the sensor. In order to enhance the reliability of the sensor, a support vector machine is used to recognize the fault characters, and the signal flow method is used to locate the faulty parts. The diagnosis information not only can be sent to an upper center control computer to evaluate the reliability of the sensors, but also can realize on-line diagnosis for debugging and the quick detection when the maglev train is off-line. The absolute <b>positioning</b> <b>sensor</b> we study has been used in the actual project...|$|R

All Supras this year {{had the same}} amount of power (both automatics and 5-speeds). The engine received a redesigned throttle <b>position</b> <b>sensor</b> (TPS) as well as a new EGR system and knock sensor.

2500|$|A {{servo system}} differs from some stepper motor {{applications}} {{in that the}} position feedback is continuous while the motor is running; a stepper system relies on the motor not to [...] "miss steps" [...] for short term accuracy, although a stepper system may include a [...] "home" [...] switch or other element to provide long-term stability of control. For instance, when a typical dot matrix computer printer starts up, its controller makes the print head stepper motor drive to its left-hand limit, where a <b>position</b> <b>sensor</b> defines home position and stops stepping. As long as power is on, a bidirectional counter in the printer's microprocessor keeps track of print-head position.|$|E
2500|$|The new A70 Supra engine, the Toyota 7M-GE, was the {{flagship}} engine of Toyota's arsenal. Both {{versions of the}} engine contained 4 valves per cylinder and dual overhead cams. The turbocharged 7M-GTE engine was Toyota's first distributor-less engine offered in the US which used coil packs sitting on the cam covers and a cam <b>position</b> <b>sensor</b> driven by the exhaust camshaft. It was equipped with a CT26 turbocharger and was rated at [...] at 5600 rpm while the naturally aspirated 7M-GE engine was rated at [...] at 6000 rpm. Further refinement on the turbo model increased power to [...] and [...] in 1989. This was mostly due to a redesign of the wastegate. All models used the same tire size of 225/50R16 on 16x7 inch wheels. Spare tires were full-sized but on steel wheels.|$|E

5000|$|A {{throttle}} <b>position</b> <b>sensor</b> (TPS) is {{a sensor}} {{used to monitor}} the throttle position of a vehicle. The sensor is usually located on the butterfly spindle/shaft {{so that it can}} directly monitor the position of the throttle.

Some engine control units (ECUs) also control the throttle position electronic throttle control (ETC) or [...] "drive by wire" [...] systems and if that is done the <b>position</b> <b>sensor</b> is used in a feedback loop to enable that control.|$|E

40|$|High-resolution {{positioning}} for maglev trains {{is implemented}} by detecting the tooth-slot {{structure of the}} long stator installed along the rail, but there are large joint gaps between long stator sections. When a <b>positioning</b> <b>sensor</b> is below a large joint gap, its positioning signal is invalidated, thus double-modular redundant <b>positioning</b> <b>sensors</b> are introduced into the system. This paper studies switching algorithms for these redundant <b>positioning</b> <b>sensors.</b> At first, adaptive prediction {{is applied to the}} sensor signals. The prediction errors are used to trigger sensor switching. In order to enhance the reliability of the switching algorithm, wavelet analysis is introduced to suppress measuring disturbances without weakening the signal characteristics reflecting the stator joint gap based on the correlation between the wavelet coefficients of adjacent scales. The time delay characteristics of the method are analyzed to guide the algorithm simplification. Finally, the effectiveness of the simplified switching algorithm is verified through experiments...|$|R
