5|$|Education {{during the}} college's early history {{was based on}} St Ignatius' Ratio Studiorum, with {{emphasis}} upon theology, classics and science, all of which still feature prominently in the curriculum. The educational practice, observed at the College of St Omer, of dividing a class into Romans and Carthaginians continued long after the migration to Stonyhurst but is not employed today; each pupil would be pitched against an opponent {{with the task of}} <b>picking</b> <b>up</b> <b>on</b> the other's mistakes in an attempt to score points.|$|E

The image horrified Hall; her guilt at being depicted in a drawing that she saw as blasphemous led to her choice of a religious subject for her next novel, The Master of the House.|$|E
5|$|The {{commission}} {{blamed the}} failings primarily on Perkin-Elmer. Relations between NASA and the optics {{company had been}} severely strained during the telescope construction, due to frequent schedule slippage and cost overruns. NASA found that Perkin-Elmer did not review or supervise the mirror construction adequately, did not assign its best optical scientists to the project (as it had for the prototype), and in particular did not involve the optical designers in the construction and verification of the mirror. While the commission heavily criticized Perkin-Elmer for these managerial failings, NASA was also criticized for not <b>picking</b> <b>up</b> <b>on</b> the quality control shortcomings, such as relying totally on test results from a single instrument.|$|E

25|$|To {{determine}} if infants were <b>picking</b> <b>up</b> <b>on</b> the statistical information, each infant {{was presented with}} multiple presentations of either a word from the artificial grammar or a nonword {{made up of the}} same syllables but presented in a random order. Infants who were presented with nonwords during the test phase listened significantly longer to these words than infants who were presented with words from the artificial grammar, showing a novelty preference for these new nonwords. However, the implementation of the test could also be due to infants learning serial-order information and not to actually learning transitional probabilities between words. That is, at test, infants heard strings such as dapiku and tilado that were never presented during learning; they could simply have learned that the syllable ku never followed the syllable pi.|$|E

25|$|Filming of {{an episode}} can usually take a {{considerable}} amount of time to be done and as such, each task is usually filmed back-to-back, rather than weekly as it appears in the broadcast schedule for a series. For each episode, four television crews are used to follow the candidates during a task, and often are focused on <b>picking</b> <b>up</b> <b>on</b> mistakes and issues between candidates, than on their overall performance. The final edit of an episode often trims down a task that took 2–3 days to be done, to fit it within approximately about half of what will be televised for that episode, meaning candidates may appear to make minimal contributions when in reality they made more, while others may not feature as much if Lord Sugar or his advisers feel they did well and completed their duties, as emphasis is often put on moments that can be entertaining for audiences. Often the filming of an episode can hamper the efforts of candidates in a task, due to film crews usually having to get filming permission first from the respective owner of a store or establishment, which can often be a time consuming and cumbersome process as a result, whilst the strict rules of the BBC on product placement and advertising mean candidates have to approach businesses with care when asking them for help.|$|E

The battleship was hit twice by 20.3cm (8in) shells; the first failed to explode and caused negligible damage, but the second struck the forward rangefinders and destroyed the radar antenna. The aft radar, which possessed only a limited forward arc, was the ship's only remaining radar capability.|$|E

500|$|However, MacFarlane {{was criticized}} for his {{portrayal}} of transsexualism in the Family Guy episode [...] "Quagmire's Dad". Gay novelist Brent Hartinger found the episode's inclusion of transphobic remarks from Peter and Lois Griffin — {{as well as a}} scene of Brian vomiting profusely upon discovering his new girlfriend to be Glenn Quagmire's father – to be [...] "shockingly insensitive". Hartinger continued, [...] "Frankly, it's literally impossible for me to reconcile last night's episode with MacFarlane's words, unless I {{come to the conclusion that}} the man is pretty much a complete idiot". The Gay and Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation, a LGBT media watchdog organization, shared [...] "serious concerns being voiced from members of the community" [...] about the episode.

Saying that they test and respect the genre's conventions in equal measure– specifically noting their use of a piano interlude on [...] "Trophies" [...] while suggesting that [...] "tearing heads off is their forte". In his review for Big Cheese, Lais Martin Wairing enthused that the band are [...] "very promising," [...] comparing them to Bring Me the Horizon but offering that While She Sleeps [...] "deserve success in their own right." [...] The album also received some minor criticism, with several reviewers <b>picking</b> <b>up</b> <b>on</b> the short overall length of the CD and While She Sleeps' similarities to other bands. In a generally favorable review for The New Review, Jen Rochester said that the CD [...] "is over before you know it," [...] while concluding that [...] "it’s definitely an effort worth checking out."

500|$|Hill began {{recording}} The Miseducation in late 1997 at Chung King Studios in New York City, {{and completed}} it in June 1998 at Tuff Gong Studios in Kingston, Jamaica. In an interview, Hill described {{the first day}} of recording, stating: [...] "The first day in the studio I ordered every instrument I ever fell in love with: harps, strings, timpani drums, organs, clarinets. It was my idea to record it so the human element stayed in. I didn't want it to be too technically perfect." [...] Initially, Jean did not support Hill recording a solo album, but eventually offered to help as a producer, which she did not accept. Aside from doing work at Chung King Studios, Hill also recorded at Perfect Pair Studios in New Jersey, as well as Sony Studios, with some songs having different elements recorded at different studios. The bulk of the album, however, was recorded at Tuff Gong Studios in Kingston, Jamaica, the studio built by reggae musician Bob Marley. Regarding this shift in environment, Hill stated: [...] "When I started recording in New York and New Jersey, lots of people were talking to me about going different routes. I could feel people up in my face, and I was <b>picking</b> <b>up</b> <b>on</b> bad vibes. I wanted a place where there was good vibes, where I was among family, and it was Tuff Gong." [...] Many members of the Marley family were present in the studio during the recording sessions, among them Julian Marley, who added guitar elements to [...] "Forgive Them Father." ...|$|E

500|$|... "The Don" [...] {{received}} universal acclaim {{from music}} critics, with Nas's lyrics drawing particular praise. Rico Barrino of Artistdirect praised Nas's rapping as {{being able to}} impress in different contexts, calling his lyrics [...] "both catchy and commanding" [...] and noted his [...] "precise, potent lyrical poetry honed by 20 years in the game". Writing for MTV News, Rob Markman called the production [...] "a sonic departure" [...] from Nas' previous work, but complimented his lyrics as [...] "vintage" [...] and pointed out {{the consistency of the}} lyrical quality throughout the song. In his review of [...] "The Don" [...] for About.com, Henry Adaso described the song as [...] "the type of lyrical exercise Nas only throws down once or twice per album", and that songs such as [...] "The Don" [...] gave a case for Nas' inclusion [...] "as one of hip-hop's all-time greats", also <b>picking</b> <b>up</b> <b>on</b> his [...] "assured" [...] boasts and the [...] "quiet confidence" [...] enveloped in his tone.

A reviewer of the song for DJBooth wrote of Nas' performance as [...] "at turns wistful, threatening and braggadocious", and praised the production's [...] "compulsively head-noddable groove". In their review of Life Is Good, Sputnikmusic recommended [...] "The Don" [...] to first-time listeners of Nas, stating to be an exhibition of Nas' [...] "incredible lyrical structures" [...] and [...] "how rapidly this guy can punch out the syllables". They also noted it as a [...] "change of pace" [...] from the more downtempo material on Life Is Good.
