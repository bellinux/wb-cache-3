5000|$|Simultaneously announced, The Monochrome Display and <b>Printer</b> <b>Adapter</b> (MDPA), often {{shortened}} to Monochrome Display Adapter (MDA), {{which did}} not support pixel-addressable graphics of any sort, offered a high-quality 80x25 character mode, having a relatively high pixel-resolution of 720x350 (character box size 9x14), {{that could be used}} on a monochrome monitor (originally, specifically the IBM 5151 Personal Computer Display).|$|E
50|$|The {{parallel}} port interface was originally {{known as the}} Parallel <b>Printer</b> <b>Adapter</b> on IBM PC-compatible computers. It was primarily designed to operate printers that used IBM's 8-bit extended ASCII character set to print text, but {{could also be used}} to adapt other peripherals. Graphical printers, along with a host of other devices, have been designed to communicate with the system.|$|E

5000|$|Game Boy <b>Printer</b> - an <b>adapter</b> {{designed}} for printing {{things from the}} Game Boy onto adhesive stickers. For example, it was used for printing out Game Boy Camera pictures and Pokémon information from the Pokédex in the Game Boy Pokémon games.|$|R
50|$|The {{company was}} {{incorporated}} in February 1983. Initially, they produced simple peripherals {{such as an}} RS-232 to Centronics parallel <b>printer</b> interface <b>adapter.</b> Later, they designed the Expanderam series of RAM expansion cards for the QL, {{which led to the}} Trump Card combined RAM expansion and floppy disk interface. This was notable in that it mapped RAM into memory space reserved for external peripheral devices, thus allowing the QL's RAM to be expanded to 768 kB rather than the official limit of 512 kB.|$|R
50|$|The Monochrome Display Adapter (MDA, also MDA card, Monochrome Display and <b>Printer</b> <b>Adapter,</b> MDPA) is IBM's {{standard}} {{video display}} card and computer display {{standard for the}} PC introduced in 1981. The MDA {{does not have any}} pixel-addressable graphics modes. It has only a single monochrome text mode (PC video mode 7), which can display 80 columns by 25 lines of high resolution text characters or symbols useful for drawing forms.|$|E
50|$|IBM {{initially}} offered two video adapters for the PC, the Color/Graphics Adapter and the Monochrome Display and <b>Printer</b> <b>Adapter.</b> CGA {{was intended}} to be a typical home computer display; it had NTSC output and could be connected to a composite monitor or a TV set with an RF modulator in addition to RGB for digital RGBI-type monitors, although IBM did not offer their own RGB monitor until 1983. Supported graphics modes were 40 or 80×25 color text with 8×8 character resolution, 320×200 bitmap graphics with two fixed 4-color palettes, or 640×200 monochrome graphics.|$|E
5000|$|Hercules Computer Technology, Inc. {{was formed}} in 1982 in Hercules, California, by Van Suwannukul and Kevin Jenkins {{and was one of}} the major {{graphics}} card companies of the 1980s. Its biggest products were the MDA-compatible Hercules Graphics Card (HGC) and Hercules Graphics Card Plus (HGC+) and the associated standard, which was widely copied and survived into the 1990s. The Hercules Graphics Card included a [...] "Centronics compatible" [...] parallel printer port, the same as the IBM Monochrome Display and <b>Printer</b> <b>Adapter</b> board that the card was based on. The company also produced CGA compatible cards, and with the unsuccessful Hercules InColor Card, it tried to go head-to-head with EGA.|$|E
50|$|All models {{also had}} a 16-bit {{universal}} parallel port with separate input and output buses for connecting peripherals such as printers (Eastern Bloc printers used the incompatible ИРПР interface instead {{of the more popular}} Centronics port, so Centronics <b>printers</b> needed an <b>adapter),</b> mice or Covox DACs for sound output, and tape recorder port for data storage. Later models included a manufacturer-supplied floppy drive controller (that could be plugged into a Q-Bus slot) by default. It was available for earlier models as an aftermarket part, but homebrew ones (that also often extended rather anemic 16K memory of original BK) were more popular. A cottage industry for such peripherals and mods flourished.|$|R
50|$|The {{operating}} {{system can be}} located on any storage, but is typically installed on a hard disk or solid-state drive. A Live CD represents the concept of running an {{operating system}} directly from a CD. While this is slow compared to storing the operating system on a hard disk drive, it is typically used for installation of operating systems, demonstrations, system recovery, or other special purposes. Large flash memory is currently more expensive than hard disk drives of similar size (as of mid-2014) but are starting to appear in laptop computers because of their low weight, small size and low power requirements. Computer communications involve internal modem cards, modems, network adapter cards, and routers. Common peripherals and adapter cards include headsets, joysticks, microphones, <b>printers,</b> scanners, sound <b>adapter</b> cards (as a separate card rather than located on the motherboard), speakers and webcams.|$|R
40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{is about}} the research carried on developing an MPS (Multipurpose Portable System) which consists of an instrument and many accessories. The instrument is portable, hand-held, and rechargeable battery operated, and it measures temperature, absorbance, and concentration of samples by using optical principles. The system also performs auxiliary functions like incubation and mixing. This system {{can be used in}} environmental, industrial, and medical applications. ^ Research emphasis is on system modularity, easy configuration, accuracy of measurements, power management schemes, reliability, low cost, computer interface, and networking. The instrument can send the data to a computer for data analysis and presentation, or to a printer. ^ This dissertation includes the presentation of a full working system. This involved integration of hardware and firmware for the micro-controller in assembly language, software in C and other application modules. ^ The instrument contains the Optics, Transimpedance Amplifiers, Voltage-to-Frequency Converters, LCD display, Lamp Driver, Battery Charger, Battery Manager, Timer, Interface Port, and Micro-controller. ^ The accessories are a <b>Printer,</b> Data Acquisition <b>Adapter</b> (to transfer the measurements to a computer via the Printer Port and expand the Analog/Digital conversion capability), Car Plug Adapter, and AC Transformer. This system has been fully evaluated for fault tolerance and the schemes will also be presented. ...|$|R
50|$|The {{original}} IBM parallel <b>printer</b> <b>adapter</b> for the IBM PC {{was designed}} to support 8-bit data bidirectionally in 1981. This allowed the port {{to be used for}} other purposes, not just output to a printer. This was accomplished by allowing the data lines to be written to by devices on either end of the cable, which required the ports on the host to be bidirectional. This feature saw little use, and was removed in later revisions of the hardware. Years later, in 1987, IBM reintroduced the bidirectional interface with its IBM PS/2 series, where it could be enabled or disabled for compatibility with applications hardwired not to expect a printer port to be bidirectional.|$|E
5000|$|Among other {{novelties}} that Lotus introduced was a graph maker {{that could}} display several forms of graphs (including pie charts, bar graphics, or line charts) but required {{the user to}} have a graphics card. At this early stage, the only video boards available for the PC were IBM's Color/Graphics Adapter and Monochrome Display and <b>Printer</b> <b>Adapter</b> while the latter did not support any graphics. However, because the two video boards used different RAM and port addresses, both could be installed in the same machine and so Lotus took advantage of this by supporting a [...] "split" [...] screen mode whereby the user could display the worksheet portion of 1-2-3 on the sharper monochrome video and the graphics on the CGA display.|$|E
50|$|The IBM Personal Computer was {{launched}} in 1981 with the Color Graphics Adapter (CGA) expansion card and the Monochrome Display And <b>Printer</b> <b>Adapter.</b> The CGA offered two basic operating modes: 320×200 pixel (or 40x25 character) low resolution or a 640x200 (or 80×25 characters) pixels high resolution mode. While the low-resolution mode was very comparable to 8-bit home computers of the era, the higher-resolution mode offered a fair advance, used with a suitable RGBI (or RGB) monitor (such as the IBM 5153 Personal Computer Color Display). Still, since by design CGA {{was able to be}} connected to cheap composite monitors and even to home TVs (via RF modulator), CGA was limited in resolution; its text modes has a character box size of 8x8 pixels, which made text fairly rough-looking, especially in the vertical direction, which had only one pixel row for descenders.|$|E
40|$|AN 10316 _ 1 This {{application}} note describes a typical printer / notebook adapter power supply, {{based on a}} Greenchip TM II controller, the TEA 1532. The features of this controller are elaborated in full detail and a possible design strategy for both discontinuous and continuous conduction mode is given to obtain the basic component values. This is demonstrated by the example design of an adapter power supply. © Royal Philips Electronics N. V. 2004 All rights are reserved.
