40|$|This paper {{describes}} how features {{from the field}} of Intelligent Tutoring Systems are applied to the Motor-Operated Valve (MOV) Advanced Technology Training System (ATTS). The MOV ATTS is a training system developed at Galaxy Scientific Corporation for the Central Research Institute of Electric Power Industry in Japan and the Electric Power Research Institute in the United States. The MOV ATTS combines traditional computer-based training approaches with system simulation, integrated expert systems, and student and expert modeling. The primary goal of the MOV ATTS is to reduce human errors that occur during MOV overhaul and repair. The MOV ATTS addresses this goal by providing basic operational information of the MOV, simulating MOV operation, providing troubleshooting practice of MOV failures, and tailoring this training to the needs of each individual student. The MOV ATTS integrates multiple expert models (functional and <b>procedural)</b> to provide <b>advice</b> and feedback to students. The integration also provides expert model validation support to developers. Student modeling is supported by two separate student models: one model registers and updates the student's current knowledge of basic MOV information, while another model logs the student's actions and errors during troubleshooting exercises. These two models are used to provide tailored feedback to the student during the MOV course...|$|R

40|$|Higher {{education}} institutions have long {{argued that they}} have a distinctive and critical role to play as partners in initial teacher education. This research offers an evaluation of this claim by exploring the contribution of higher education alongside the school-based input it is intended to complement. Using a case study approach within a well-established 'collaborative' partnership, focused on advice about choosing appropriate lesson activities, data were collected from 18 university-based sessions, and from the weekly mentor meetings of four experienced mentors. Despite important differences between individual schools, a high level of consistency was found between the partners in terms of their substantive recommendations. Where the university tutors' input was clearly distinctive from that of school-based mentors was in the explicit nature of the <b>procedural</b> <b>advice</b> given to trainees, the sources on which each drew in making their recommendations, and in the extent to which ideas were subjected to critical scrutiny. © 2006 Taylor and Francis...|$|E

40|$|Expectations for {{educational}} research {{can seem like}} the ancient moral equation Nietzsche criticizes in his Twilight of the Idols. There Nietzsche (1968 / 1889) derides the Socratic/Platonic equation of reason, virtue, and happiness. Reason leads to truth. Truth leads to virtue, and virtue leads to happiness. Clifford (1973) notes a similar equation in her work {{on the history of}} the impact of research on teaching. Underlying the enduring optimism and hope {{for educational}} research is the belief that "to know the right is to do the right " (pp. 1 - 2). Educational research p ovides the knowledge that will influence teachers. Teachers thereby acquire the pedagogical excellence (virtue) necessary to promote some educational good. This article does not question the equation's basic structure, except to deny any necessary connection between parts. Knowledge derived from research may l ad to pedagogical excellence. But, important differences appear in how teachers, teacher educators, or researchers conceptualize "knowing the right. " Among teachers, Dewey (1929) laid out broad possibilities. Prospective teachers, on the one hand, want to know how to do things in order to be successful teachers. Research knowledge becomes a source of <b>procedural</b> <b>advice</b> for good performance, and knowing the right means using the right "recipes " (p. 15).

40|$|This {{research}} proposes the use {{of neural}} networks for providing task support in a proactive but relatively unobtrusive manner. The user interface features separate and persistent advice windows, where <b>procedural</b> <b>advice</b> and relevant domain knowledge are displayed continuously, side by side to the task window. The display is updated in short intervals. As the central component of the back end, a neural network identifies the user's current task and relevant advice based on the task progress. A prototype. Telephone Triage Assistant (TTA), has been built to demonstrate the user interface style and the proposed approach. It supports novice nurses ' triage task based on a telephone interview. Theusability of TTAhasbeen informally evaluated at a medical call center, and the feedback was encouraging in general. 1. INTRQDUCTION Telephone triage in medical call centers is both challenging and critical, as it involves multitasking such as listening, recording and interpreting patients ' syn:, making an assessment {{about the nature of}} the diseases, and recommending an appropriate action accordingly. All of these are performed under time pressure and distractions caused by more critical patients. The quicker an assessment is made through the right line of questions, the sooner the proper care can be suggested. Sometimes, in a life-threatening situation where time is limited, it may help save a life (Wheeler & Windt, 1993). It is, therefore, important to have access to relevant and up-to-date domain knowledge at the point of need, instead of completely relying on one person's memory, to provide consistent and accurate response...|$|E

Paper {{presented at the}} Junior Researchers of EARLI Conference 2010, Frankfurt, Germany. Learner-controlled education gives learners control over their learning pathways. They assess their own performance and select a task out of a large set of learning tasks, accommodating their own learning needs. However, novice learners often do not possess the self-assessment and task-selection skills necessary for determining an appropriate path. Especially if they are novices in the learning domain too, it is even harder to set an appropriate path. They will be overloaded by both the unfamiliar learning environment and the unfamiliar domain. Moreover, they will not know what performance standards are relevant for performance assessment, and what task characteristics {{to take into account}} for task selection. Consequently, they probably will neither gain a great deal of knowledge nor improve domain-specific skills. 	This study tested whether a procedural advisory model providing self-assessment and task-selection advice, helps learners in learner-controlled education to determine an appropriate learning pathway. The self-assessment advice provides a scoring rubric for assessing performance. The task-selection advice provides a rule which is based on the learner’s self-assessment and mental effort and the task aspects of the prior task. These learners will be better able to determine their own learning pathway, in turn enhancing learning performance. The model is expected to benefit the learners’ development of self-assessment and task-selection skills, and, consequently, positively affect acquisition of the learners’ domain-specific skills.
