30|$|Aniline black, {{also known}} as chrome black, is perhaps the {{earliest}} of the synthetic organic pigments, being discovered between 1860 and 1863 [11]. It {{is known for its}} matte finish [12], which Maki uses to contrast with the glossier, high key pigments of the colored subjects. Although aniline black is known to have been widely used in the printing and dyeing industries since 1863, it has only before been specifically identified in the cultural heritage literature as an ink in a 1930 s printed book [13]. In that work, Doncea and Ion published a diffuse reflectance infrared spectrum (DRIFTS) for the pigment, but the dependence of the DRIFTS technique on the optical properties of the sample make it insufficient to serve as a general reference for further identifications. It {{should be noted that the}} popular Infrared and Raman Users Group (IRUG) spectral database does not contain a reference spectrum of aniline black [14], which may have contributed to the lack of observed occurrences for this historically important pigment. To the authors’ knowledge, the aniline black reported here for three of Haku Maki’s “Poem” series prints is the pigment’s first discovery on a work of fine art. The use of aniline black has declined since the mid- 1930 s when other synthetic blacks that were safer and easier to apply emerged onto the market [15]. It is worth noting, however, that the pigment is still included in several commercial artists’ paint lines, such as Winsor & Newton’s Designers Gouache Jet Black (# 50947171) and Holbein’s Artists’ Watercolor Tube <b>Peach</b> <b>Black</b> (#W 137 W 337), where it is mixed in the latter with lamp black. As such, it would not be surprising to find other examples of the use of aniline black, even in contemporary artworks.|$|E
40|$|A reduced {{cancer risk}} {{associated}} with fruit and vegetable phytochemicals initially dictated chemopreventive approaches focused on specific green variety consumption or even single nutrient supplementations. However, these strategies not only failed to provide any health benefits but gave rise to detrimental effects. In parallel, public-health chemoprevention programmes were developed in the USA and Europe to increase whole vegetable consumption. Among these, the National Cancer Institute (NCI) sponsored plan “ 5 to 9 {{a day for a}} better health” {{was one of the most}} popular. This campaign promoted wide food choice through the consumption of at least 5 to 9 servings a day of colourful fruits and vegetables. In this study the effects of the diet suggested by NCI on transcription, translation and catalytic activity of both xenobiotic metabolizing (XME) and antioxidant enzymes were studied in the animal model. In fact, the boost of both antioxidant defences and “good” phase-II together with down-regulation of “bad” phase-I XMEs is still considered one of the most widely-used strategies of cancer control. Six male Sprague Dawley rats for each treatment group were used. According to the Italian Society of Human Nutrition, a serving of fruit, vegetables and leafy greens corresponds to 150, 250 and 50 g, respectively, in a 70 kg man. Proportionally, rats received one or five servings of lyophilized onion, tomato, <b>peach,</b> <b>black</b> grape or lettuce – for white, red, yellow, violet or green diet, respectively - or five servings of each green (“ 5 a day” diet) by oral gavage daily for 10 consecutive days. Liver subcellular fractions were tested for various cytochrome P 450 (CYP) linked-monooxygenases, phase-II supported XMEs such as glutathione S-transferase (GST) and UDP-glucuronosyl transferase (UDPGT) as well as for some antioxidant enzymes. Hepatic transcriptional and translational effects were evaluated by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and Western blot analysis, respectively. dROMs test was used to measure plasmatic oxidative stress. Routine haematochemical parameters were also monitored. While the five servings administration didn’t significantly vary XME catalytic activity, the lower dose caused a complex pattern of CYP inactivation with lettuce exerting particularly strong effects (a loss of up to 43...|$|E

40|$|Whey is a {{byproduct}} of cheese, curd and casein manufacture and as {{an excellent source of}} proteins, vitamins, minerals and lactose can be used in wide range of industrial production. If treated as waste material without further processing, it can have negative impact on the environment. Main components of whey are water (93 % of total volume), lactose (70 to 72 % of dry matter), whey protein (8 to 10 % solids), and minerals (12 to 15 % solids). Of the minerals, most abundant are magnesium, phosphorus, calcium, potassium, sodium, zinc, and their salts which are passed to whey from milk. Predominantly represented vitamins are water-soluble vitamins (B 1, B 2, B 12, B 6, and C) from which the vitamins B 2, B 12 and C are bound to the whey proteins. The most abundant whey proteins are betalactoglobulin, alfa lactalbumin, GMP (glycomacropeptide), bovine serum albumin, immunoglobulins, lactoferrin and lactoperoxidase. For each of these proteins have been demonstrated or at least implied, unique functional, nutritional or nutraceutical properties. The aim of the thesis was to compile a literature review focused on the possibility of using whey from the production of cheese and curd as raw materials for the manufacture of various types of beverages and monitoring the effect of the addition of various flavor components and whey proteins on the sensory quality of the drink prepared from fresh sour whey. The hypothesis of this work was that flavored whey drinks made from acid whey supplemented with whey protein have a higher sensory quality score than flavored drinks without the addition of whey protein and that whey drinks flavored with mango flavour are more acceptable by consumers they are able to mask undesirable off-tastes of sour whey better than flavor <b>peaches,</b> cherries and <b>black</b> currants. In all specimens, the effect of 8 different recipes and flavors of peaches, cherries, mango and blackcurrant on the final sensory quality and acceptability to consumers was observed. It was found that the best rated drinks were of cherry and mango flavors. Beverages with the addition of mango juice were able to reliably mask natural off-taste of whey, which supports the hypothesis about the appropriateness of using this flavor. Drinks with peach flavor were evaluated to be of the worst senzory quality. As of the best sensory quality were evaluated drinks flavored with cherry flavor, which reached the best overall evaluation. In all variants of formulas was observed that drinks with added WPC achieved better overall evaluation than similar variations without addition of WPC. Statistically significant results of this finding, however, were observed only in the context of mango flavors...|$|R
40|$|Isolates of Monilinia fructicola (Wint.) Honey {{obtained}} from stone fruit orchards in Hawkes Bay, North Island and from Californian fruit exported to New Zealand, were tested for resistance to methyl benzimidazole carbamate (MBC). Resistant isolates from the North Island had EC₅₀ values of > 30, 000, and most isolates from the imported fruit had of values approximately 1. 5 mg a. i. /l carbendazim. Sensitive isolates failed to grow on 1 mg a. i. /l carbendazim. A detached peach shoot system {{was used in}} controlled conditions for estimation of values for incubation period, latent period and rate of spore production on flowers (cv Glohaven). The same variables {{and the rate of}} colonisation of host tissue were measured on fruit (cv Fantasia) in controlled conditions. An inoculum density of 1 x 10 ⁴ spore/flower or fruit greatly increased fitness in vivo compared to an inoculum density of 1 x 10 ² spore/flower (fruit). Isolates varied considerably, but there was no consistent relationship between the degrees of resistance and fitness. This was in contrast to earlier studies with dicarboximide resistant strains of M. fructicola. The survival in the field of 10 isolates resistant or sensitive to MBC or dicarboximide fungicides on twig cankers and mummified fruit was compared. The ability to produce conidia on twig cankers inoculated in late spring 1989 was maintained by all sensitive and MBC resistant isolates for at least 1 year. The production of conidia on mummified fruit inoculated in February 1990 decreased after 2 - 3 months in the field but some conidia were still produced on all fruit in the following spring. Dicarboximide resistant isolates produced less conidia than either the MBC resistant and the sensitive isolates. The pathogenicity and fitness of all isolates were similar to the original values after survival for 1 year. A technique was developed to produce apothecia reliably from inoculated <b>peach</b> (cv <b>Black</b> Boy) and nectarine (cv Fantasia) fruit in controlled conditions in the laboratory. The fruit were inoculated with resistant or sensitive isolates, or combinations, and were incubated for 8 weeks at 25 °C (± 1 °C) with 12 hours photoperiod of fluorescent light (Sylvania 2 x 65 W, daylight) to produce mummified fruit. The fruit were then buried in moist autoclaved peat moss for 10 weeks at 25 °C (± 1 °C) in the dark to form stromata. These fruit were then hydrated with running tap-water (total hardness (CaCO₃) = 47 g/m³ and conductivity at 20 °C = 12. 7 mS/m) for 72 hours. The hydrated mummified fruit were placed in moist peat moss and were incubated for 13 - 14 weeks at 8 °C (± 0. 5 °C) in the dark. At the end of this period, stipe initials were visible. Differentiation of stipe initials into mature apothecia occurred within 15 - 20 days after transfer to 12 °C (± 2 °C) with a 12 hour photoperiod of fluorescent and incandescent light. All isolates produced apothecia when treated in this way. A technique for isolation of ascospore sets in linear arrangement was developed for tetrad analysis of the inheritance of resistance. At least 3 hours of fluorescent and incandescent light at 12 °C (± 2 °C) was essential to allow ascospore ejection from individual asci taken from apothecia previously maintained in a 12 hour photoperiod at 12 °C (± 1 °C). A water film on the surface of water agar was necessary to hold a set of ejected ascospores in linear sequence. Single ascospores were obtained in sequence {{with the aid of a}} micromanipulator. Genetic analysis of MBC resistant isolates was carried out on ascospores derived from apothecia produced in the laboratory. Analysis of ascospore sets in linear arrangement and ascospore populations indicated that resistance to > 30, 000 mg a. i. /l carbendazim (high-resistant) is governed by a single major gene and is affected by gene conversion mechanisms. Crossing over was frequent, suggesting that recombination of resistance with other characters, such as pathogenicity and fitness, may occur readily. The segregation ratio (1 : 1) from most resistant isolates revealed that heterokaryons containing both resistant and sensitive alleles were common in resistant populations and that resistance is dominant. Allozyme analysis of ascospore progeny through electrophoresis revealed a narrow genetic base of M. fructicola in New Zealand. The technique for reliable apothecial production in controlled conditions developed in this study provided an important step for the determination of the biology of M. fructicola strains resistant to MBC fungicides, and the complexity of its life cycle. Genetic heterogeneity in field populations can be conserved in one isolate through heterokaryosis, thus providing for adaptability of the pathogen to the changing environmental conditions. Knowledge on genetic variability, overwintering ability, pathogenicity and fitness factors may be useful for future management strategies of stone fruit brown rot. Special emphasis should be made in particular to prevent primary infection on blossoms, which would delay the establishment of recombinant strains of M. fructicola and the onset of brown rot epidemics...|$|R
40|$|Black pacu Colossoma macropomum and red pacu Piaractus brachypomus are two endemic {{fruit and}} {{seed-eating}} Amazon fishes {{considered to be}} important seed dispersing agents in flooded forests. Dwindling populations coupled with the omnivorous feeding habits, rapid growth, high meat quality and commercial acceptance of these fishes has led to them becoming prime candidates for aquaculture development. However, high aquafeed prices are the prime limiting factor {{for the development of}} pacu culture in the Peruvian Amazon. The main objectives of this dissertation were: 1) to assess the effects of fish size on seed dispersal capacity of black and red Pacu; 2) to compare seed dispersal potential of these two Amazon fishes against two other seed dispersal mechanisms (anemochory and hydrochory); 3) to determine the apparent digestibility coefficients (ADC) of three local high-carbohydrate feedstuffs (yuca or cassava, plátano or plantain, and pijuayo or <b>peach</b> palm) in <b>black</b> and red Pacu; 4) to examine the feasibility of incorporating cassava, plantain, and peach palm meal in formulated diets for black pacu; and 5) to evaluate and compare black pacu fingerling growth, feed utilization and survival when reared at three water temperatures: 27. 5, 30 and 32. 5 ºC. In the first study, {{no significant differences were found}} for germination rates of seeds ingested among the three different size groups of fish tested. Although germination rates varied, the findings demonstrate both fish species in different ages may play an important role as seed dispersers in the floodplain forests. In a second study, ADC for crude protein, lipid and gross energy from raw and cooked green plantain meal (GPM) and cassava root meal (CRM) were lower compared to values of other common vegetal ingredients like corn and wheat. However, ADC values for raw and cooked peach palm meal (PPM) were, in most cases, higher than those reported for raw or cooked GPM and CRM. In comparison with other traditional feedstuffs, ADC values for PPM are similar to corn and higher than those reported for soybean meal and wheat bran, which suggests this ingredient, has high potential for incorporation in low-cost pacu aquafeed formulations in the Peruvian Amazon. In a third study, weight gain, feed conversion, survival, hematocrit, hemoglobin, mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration, alternative complement activity, and lysozyme were found to be similar among several diets tested; however, protein efficiency ratio (PER) was lower in fish fed the diet containing wheat middlings. Relative to wheat middlings, all feedstuffs tested (cassava, plantain, and peach palm meal) were effective energy sources for juvenile black pacu and can serve as carbohydrate sources in balanced aquafeeds for this species. In a fourth study, black pacu reared at 30 ºC demonstrated significantly higher final body weight, body weight gain, specific growth rate, feed conversion ratio, feeding efficiency, and PER levels than fish reared at either 27. 5 or 32. 5 ºC (P 3 ̆c 0. 05). No significant differences (P 3 ̆e 0. 05) were recorded for feed intake, protein intake, or condition factor. This study suggests that global temperature increase may impair the ability of pacus to efficiently utilize feed and that growth in water temperatures above 30 ºC may become limiting for this species. In summary, growing evidence suggests that over the past two decades black and red pacu populations have significantly declined as a result of human activities and over-exploitation in the Peruvian Amazon, and their substantial role as seed disperers in the flooded forests could result in serious declines of many plant and animal components of the valuable aquatic ecosystem of the Amazon basin. Therefore, aquaculture of black and red pacu in the Peruvian Amazon is an attractive option to satisfy not only the increasing demand for animal protein for human consumption, but also as a viable mitigation measure for wild fish and forestry conservation. Results from this dissertation can serve as a basis for further improvement in culture technology for these two important species...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} was finding genes that control the {{production}} of potentially health beneficial metabolites in apple fruits. The approach was genetic mapping of secondary metabolites such as phenolic compounds in an F 1 progeny, leading to the detection of genetic loci that controlled these metabolites. At these genetic loci candidate genes were identified, using the whole genome sequence of apple, and it was investigated whether the expression of these candidate genes in the F 1 progeny correlated with the metabolite levels. The cultivated apple (Malus x domestica Borkh) {{is among the most}} diverse and ubiquitously cultivated fruit species. It belongs to the family of Rosaceae which includes many commercial fruit species such as pear, strawberry, cherry, <b>peach,</b> apricot, almond, <b>black</b> cherry, and crab apple. Apple has a haploid chromosome number of 17. It is a self-incompatible and highly heterozygous crop. The breeding is further hampered by the long juvenile period which makes breeding in this crop a very slow process. The saying “An apple a day keeps the doctor away” has encouraged many researchers to search for the “magic” ingredients found in apple. Due to the beneficial role of apple phenolics, it is also called as a “new agrochemical crop”. Apple possesses many health beneficial properties for human beings as it is a rich source of phenolic compounds. It has been associated with reducing the risks of certain diseases such as cancers, particularly prostate, liver, colon, and lung cancers, cardiovascular diseases, coronary heart diseases, asthma, type- 2 diabetes, thrombotic stroke, and ischemic heart disease. The second chapter of this thesis describes the construction of genetic linkage maps of the parents of a segregating population derived from the cross between the cultivars ‘Prima’ and ‘Fiesta’. For this purpose the already available linkage maps, as described in this chapter, were made denser by inclusion of 240 Diversity Array Technology (DArT) markers. Thus the total number of markers for ‘Prima’ and ‘Fiesta’ integrated map reached to 820. DArT-markers are hybridization based dominant DNA-markers. DArT provides a high-throughput whole genome genotyping platform for the detection and scoring of hundreds of polymorphic loci without any need for prior sequence information. This is the first report on DArT in horticultural trees. Genetic mapping of DArT markers in two mapping populations and their integration with other marker types showed that DArT is a powerful high throughput method for obtaining accurate and reproducible marker data, at low cost per data point. This method appears to be suitable for aligning the genetic maps of different segregating populations. Sequencing of the marker clones showed that they are significantly enriched for low copy, gene rich regions. Chapter 3 describes metabolic diversity of Malus. Wild germplasm was compared to advanced breeding selections and to the segregating F 1 population from the cross between the cultivars ‘Prima’ and ‘Fiesta’. The metabolic profiles were analyzed by means of liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS). LC-MS is an analytical chemistry technique that combines the physical separation capabilities of liquid chromatography with the mass analysis capabilities of mass spectrometry. This resulted in the detection of 418 putative metabolites in the peel and 254 in the flesh. Fruits from 23 wild species, eight advanced selections and the segregating F 1 population were analyzed. The data were subjected to Principle Components Analysis (PCA). Variance analysis of the first PC showed that genetic variation accounted for 96. 6 % in peel and 97. 4 % in flesh of the total metabolic variation. Technical variation accounted for 1. 4 % and 0. 8 %, while environmental variation accounted for 2. 0 % and 1. 8 % in peel and flesh respectively. The genetic variation between wild genotypes was very large, compared to the advanced selections and the F 1 progeny. Only 8 % of the genetic variation of the first principle component was captured by the advanced selections. This indicates strong genetic erosion during breeding. This genetic erosion was mainly caused by reduction of the levels of several flavonoids including catechin, epicatechin and procyanidins. PCA of the F 1 progeny of  the ‘Prima’ x ‘Fiesta’ cross showed a clear 3 : 1 Mendelian segregation of metabolites. These metabolites were 4. 2 fold less in both peel and flesh in progeny that had inherited the recessive alleles of a gene at the top of Linkage Group 16 (LG 16) from the heterozygous parents. We found a separate group of 11 metabolites in peel and 12 in flesh. These metabolites were putatively identified as glycosylated forms of b-glycols: R-octane- 1, 3 -diol and its unsaturated form R- 5 -(Z) -octene- 1, 3 -diol which have a potential role in controlling infection by microorganisms and influence the aroma of some ciders. The levels of these metabolites were up to 50 fold more abundant in some progeny compared to both parents. Genetic mapping showed that this strong increase was caused by one locus at the top of LG 8, in progeny that had inherited only the recessive alleles of that locus from the heterozygous parents. This research illustrates not only the strong genetic erosion in apple breeding regarding metabolic diversity, and strong reduction of flavonoids in some progeny, but also shows that inbreeding can lead to a strong increase of metabolites that were present at much lower levels in both parents and advanced selections. This loss and gain of metabolites was especially observed in case of accumulation of recessive alleles during inbreeding. The genetic factors controlling metabolite composition were studied in more detail in Chapter 4. We investigated the genetic factors of the quantitative variation of these potentially beneficial compounds (Chapter 3, 4), by combining the genetic maps (Chapter 2) with the LC-MS data for thesegregating F 1 population from the cross ‘Prima’ x ‘Fiesta’. This resulted into metabolite quantitative trait loci (mQTLs). When using the software MetaNetwork, 669 significant mQTLs were detected: 488 in the peel and 181 mQTLs in the flesh. Four linkage groups (LGs) i. e. LG 1, LG 8, LG 13 and LG 16 were found to contain mQTL hotspots, mainly regulating metabolites that belong to the phenylpropanoid pathway. These include various metabolites i. e. sinapate hexoside, coumaroyl hexoside, phloridzin, quinic acids, phenolic esters, kaempferol glycosides, quercetin glycosides, cyanidin pnetoside, flavan- 3 -ols (catechin, epicatechin), and procyanidins. The genetics of annotated metabolites was studied in more detail using MapQTL ®. It was found that quercetin conjugates had mQTLs on LG 1 and LG 13. The most important mQTL hotspot with the largest number of metabolites was, however, detected at the top of LG 16 : mQTLs for 32 peel-related and 17 flesh-related phenolic compounds. The metabolites that mapped in the mQTL hotspot on LG 16 all belong to the phenylpropanoid pathway of secondary metabolites. These compounds showed a monogenic Mendelian inheritance in a 3 : 1 segregation ratio. Procyanidins dimer II was used {{as a representative of the}} numerous compounds that mapped at the LG 16 mQTL hotspot. By means of graphical genotyping of this monogenic trait, a genetic window could be made in which the gene that caused the mQTL hotspot should reside. We located structural genes involved in the phenolic biosynthetic pathway, using the genetic map together with the published whole genome sequence of apple. The structural gene leucoanthocyanidin reductase (MdLAR 1) was detected in the mQTL hotspot window on LG 16, as were seven transcription factor genes. To our knowledge, this is the first time that a QTL analysis was performed on such a high number of metabolites in an outbreeding plant species.  The expression of the candidate genes found in the mQTL window on LG 16 was studied and discussed in Chapter 5. qPCR was used for this purpose and it was found that the expression of only the structural gene MdLAR 1 was strongly positively correlated with the metabolite procyanidin dimer II content. Neither the expression profiles of other structural genes of the phenylpropanoid pathway, the transcription factor genes at the mQTL hotspot, nor of transcription factor genes outside the mQTLs hotspot, showed any significant correlation with the procyanidin dimmer II content that mapped at the mQTL hotpot. This indicates that MdLAR 1 was the gene, which caused this mQTL hotspot (Chapter 5). The progeny that had inherited one or two copies of the dominant alleles (Mm, MM) showed on the average a 4. 4 and 11. 8 fold higher expression level of MdLAR 1 respectively, compared to the progeny that had inherited the recessive alleles only (mm). This led to a 4. 0 fold increase of procyanidin dimer II level at the ripe stage. Strikingly, at the mQTL hotspot at the top of LG 16, there is also a locus that controls acidity of the ripe fruits. However, the dominant alleles for acidity appeared to be in repulsion to the dominant alleles for high metabolite levels (Chapter 6). This shows that acidity is controlled by another gene than the metabolite levels. The combination of the genetic position based on the whole apple genome sequence, annotation of potential genes, and expression profiling indicated that the malic acid transporter gene MdALMT 2 was responsible for the clear differences in malic acid content and pH in mature apple fruits of the segregating F 1 population. The genetic inheritance of at least one dominant allele (MaMa/Mama) of this gene sufficed for a three-fold increase of the malic acid concentration and a reduction of the pH from 4 to 3 in ripe apples, compared to the presence of only the lower expressed recessive allele (mama). This malic acid transporter gene is located at the top of LG 16. Malic acid is the predominant organic acid associated with the pH in apple fruits. It is synthesized in the cytoplasm and transported into the cell vacuole. The concentration of malic acid in the cell vacuole determines the pH of the cell. pH is very important for the overall taste of many fruits, including apple, and has profound effects on the organoleptic quality of apples. The pH of mature apples was genetically mapped on LG 16 in the segregating population from the cross ‘Prima’ x ‘Fiesta’. To our knowledge, this is the first time that the genetic segregation of the pH in apple is assigned to a specific gene. Further, this gene has not been reported yet in conjunction to pH of apples or other fruits. After cloning of the MdALMT 2 gene, it can be used for, proof of principle, influencing the acidic of existing varieties either by silencing this gene in more acidic cultivars or by inserting this gene into the low acidic cultivars. Another step would be to develop an allele specific molecular marker for selection (Marker Assisted Selection) of the acidity of fruits already at seedling stage, five years before the trees carry fruits.             In another study, a dominantly mutated allele of the transcription factor gene MdMYB 10,including its upstream promoter, coding region and terminator sequence, was introduced by transformation into apple, strawberry and potato plants. The dominantly inherited mutant allele of MdMYB 10 from apple induces anthocyanin production throughout the plant, also at the early stage after transformation. The aim was to determine whether MdMYB 10 could be used as a visible selectable marker for plant transformation as an alternative to chemically selectable markers, such as kanamycin resistance. After transformation, the color of  calli, shoots and well-growing plants were evaluated. Red and green shoots were harvested from apple explants and examined for the presence of the MdMYB 10 gene by PCR analysis. Red shoots of apple explants always contained the MdMYB 10 gene but not all MdMYB 10 containing shoots were red. Strawberry plants transformed with the MdMYB 10 gene showed anthocyanin accumulation in leaves and roots. No visible accumulation of anthocyanin could be observed in potato plants grown in vitro, even the ones carrying the MdMYB 10 gene. However, acid methanol extracts of potato shoots or roots carrying the MdMYB 10 gene contained up to four times higher anthocyanin content than control plants. Therefore, anthocyanin production as a result of the dominant MdMYB 1010 gene can be used as a selectable marker for apple, strawberry and potato transformation, replacing kanamycin resistance gene such as nptII. We reported this MdMYB 10 as a cisgenic selectable marker gene for apple transformation (Chapter 7). The results from all experimental chapters have been discussed in a broader sense in the general discussion (Chapter 8). The future prospectives and potential challenges in the genetical metabolomics are also highlighted. The approaches we developed in the current thesis could be used not only for developing potentially a more healthy and improved apple but can also be applied for the genetical metabolomics studies in other important crops.  ...|$|R
