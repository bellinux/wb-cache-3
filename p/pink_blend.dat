2500|$|Rosa 'Princess of Wales', a white blend rose cultivar, {{is named}} {{in honour of}} Diana. She {{received}} it as a tribute for her 10-year cooperation with the British Lung Foundation. It was bred by Harkness in the United Kingdom and introduced in 1997. The nostalgic floribunda {{is also known as}} 'Hardinkum'. It has a double bloom form, and a mild to strong fragrance. The rose is said to be one of Diana's favourites. After her death, the proceeds from selling the roses in 1998–99 were donated to the British Lung Foundation. In 2002, it was granted the Award of Garden Merit by the Royal Horticultural Society. Rosa 'Diana, Princess of Wales', a <b>pink</b> <b>blend</b> garden rose, was first introduced in 1998 at the British Embassy in the United States. The classical hybrid tea rose was bred by Keith W. Zary of Jackson & Perkins and is also known under the names 'Elegant Lady' and 'Jacshaq'. It has a classic bloom form with ivory petals, and a mild, sweet fragrance. [...] "15% of the retail price" [...] for buying each of the roses was donated to the Diana, Princess of Wales Memorial Fund. It was also not sold in the United Kingdom in order to prevent from creating a competition with Rosa 'Princess of Wales'.|$|E

5000|$|Kenya also avoided {{damage in}} air attacks by the Germans on 27-28 March. She had by now {{received}} the nickname [...] "The Pink Lady", {{due to her}} Mountbatten Pink camouflage paint, during the commando raid against installations on Vågsøy Island off the Norwegian coast. This was attributed to her Mountbatten <b>Pink</b> camouflage <b>blending</b> in with the pink marker dye the Germans were using in their shells, preventing German spotters from distinguishing between shell splashes and the ship. The force returned to Scapa Flow in early January 1942. Kenya returned to escorting Arctic convoys between March and May 1942. On 22 March after escorting PQ12 to Murmansk Kenya was loaded with 10 tonnes of Russian bullion and took it back to Britain for safe keeping.|$|R
60|$|I did sleep a {{few hours}} under Nonnezoshe, and when I awoke {{the tip of the}} arch was losing its cold {{darkness}} and beginning to shine. The sun had just risen high enough over some low break in the wall to reach the bridge. I watched. Slowly, in wondrous transformation, the gold and blue and rose and <b>pink</b> and purple <b>blended</b> their hues, softly, mistily, cloudily, until once more the arch was a rainbow.|$|R
5000|$|The couturier {{remembered his}} mother when, {{years after her}} death, {{on the eve of}} his first runway show, he was looking at the façade of the House that bore his name on Avenue Montaigne and exclaimed: [...] "If Mother had lived, I would never have dared." [...] In the same way that we sense the {{presence}} of Charles Baudelaire's mother, Caroline, in his work and the influence of Jeanne, Marcel Proust's mother, in his, Madame Dior had a profound effect on her son's entire career. Regarding the Granville house, Christian Dior wrote: [...] "I have the tenderest, most magical memories of it. Not only that; my life, my style, owe nearly everything to its location and architecture," [...] and [...] "...(it) was pebbledashed in a very soft <b>pink,</b> <b>blended</b> with gray gravel, and these two colors have remained my favorite shades in couture." [...] But it was above all his mother's garden that made a deep impression on the couturier. Having spent his childhood learning the names of flowers and their descriptions from horticulture catalogs, Christian Dior drew inspiration from them to create the silhouettes that would lead to his success in 1947 with the Corolle line. The decor of the Diors' apartment in La Muette, Paris, was also imprinted on the couturier's imagination: reference is made to it in the Louis XVI style which inspired the interiors of the Dior boutiques. Finally, it was Madeleine Dior's look that the couturier remembered when he invented the famous New Look with its nipped in waist, pronounced hips and emphasized bust recalling the feminine silhouettes of the Belle Époque. Long after the couturier's death, the House of Dior continues to pay tribute to this muse, as in the Fall-Winter 2005 runway show, where a Belle Époque-inspired dress was named [...] "Madeleine".|$|R
5000|$|One of the anecdotal and {{possibly}} apocryphal tales told {{in support of}} Mountbatten pink {{was the story of}} the cruiser HMS Kenya (nicknamed [...] "The Pink Lady" [...] at the time due to her Mountbatten pink paint), which during Operation Archery covered a commando raid against installations on Vågsøy Island off the Norwegian coast. The Germans fired on the Kenya for several minutes with coastal guns but she sustained only minor damage from near misses. This was attributed to her Mountbatten <b>pink</b> camouflage <b>blending</b> in with the pink marker dye the Germans were using in their shells, preventing German spotters from distinguishing between shell splashes and the ship. Stories like this, and personal experience of ships with the colour disappearing from view, made crews of ships with the colour notable supporters.|$|R

60|$|Shefford {{knew that}} this would be his last look at the rainbow bridge. As he gazed the tip of the great arch lost its cold, dark stone color and began to shine. The sun had just arisen high enough over some low break in the wall to reach the bridge. Shefford watched. Slowly, in wondrous transformation, the gold and blue and rose and <b>pink</b> and purple <b>blended</b> their hues, softly, mistily, cloudily, until once again the arch was a rainbow.|$|R

6000|$|Bubbles {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{fascinating}} of sports. There is the soft foamy mass, like driven snow, or like whipped cream. Blanche bends down to blow [...] "a honeycomb," [...] holding the bowl of the pipe in the water; at her gurgling blasts there slowly heaves upwards the pile of larger, clearer bubbles, each reflecting the whole scene, and sparkling with rainbow tints, until Aubrey ruthlessly dashes all into fragments with his hand, and Mary pronounces it stiff enough, and presents a pipe to little Daisy, who, drawing the liquid into her mouth, throws it away with a grimace, and declares that she does not like bubbles! But Aubrey stands with swelled cheeks, gravely puffing at the sealing-waxed extremity. Out pours a confused assemblage of froth, but the glassy globe slowly expands the little branching veins, flowing down on either side, bearing an enlarging miniature of the sky, the clouds, the tulip-tree. Aubrey pauses to exclaim! but where is it? Try again! A proud bubble, as Mary calls it, a peacock, in <b>blended</b> <b>pink</b> and green, is this transparent sphere, reflecting and embellishing house, wall, and shrubs! It is too beautiful! It is gone! Mary undertakes to give a lesson, and blows deliberately without the slightest result. Again! She waves her disengaged hand in silent exultation as the airy balls detach themselves, and float off on the summer breeze, with a tardy, graceful, uncertain motion. Daisy rushes after them, catches at them, and looks at her empty fingers with a puzzled [...] "All gone!" [...] as plainly expressed by Toby, who snaps at them, and shakes his head with offended dignity at the shock of his meeting teeth, while the kitten frisks after them, striking at them with her paw, amazed at meeting vacancy.|$|R
