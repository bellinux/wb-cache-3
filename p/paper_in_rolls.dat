The drop-size distri-bution recorder {{consists of a}} self- contained, mobile unit able to operate without electric power. This recorder utilizes "Ozalid 105 SZ " filter <b>paper</b> cut <b>in</b> <b>rolls</b> three inches wide and 150 feet long. Before using the ASB recorder, problems concerning smearing, un-derdevelopment, and splashing required a solution. A portion of the data {{used in this study}} came from the AN /TPS- 10 D weather radar located atop McCulloch Peak. Several comparisons between the radar data and the drop-size data demonstrate a tendency for a relation-ship between the average mean drop diameter and the average height of the echo top, averaging both values throughout a shower.

40|$|Caranda is a Brazilian native palm tree, {{belonging}} to Arecaceae family and occurring, predominan,t in the Brazilian Swampland. This work studied the germination and the caranda seeds storage behavior. The germination study {{was carried out}} in the temperatures of 25 ºC and 30 ºC in constant white light and the alternate temperature of 20 / 30 ºC with 10 hours of darkness for the lowest temperature and 14 hours of light for the highest temperature, using paper and paper roll as substratum. At the end of test, the germination percentage, germination speed index, germination medium time and the primary root length were evaluated. After the seeds improvement, it was obtained two sub-samples destined for 30 days storage in two invironments: cold and dry chamber (16 ºC/ 55 % UR) and freezer (- 18 ºC). The following tests, water content, germination, germination medium time and primary root length were evaluated. The caranda seeds germination <b>in</b> <b>paper</b> <b>roll</b> and on paper is favored by the temperature of 20 / 30 ºC <b>in</b> <b>paper</b> <b>roll</b> and on paper and paper roll on 30 ºC.

60|$|It is well to take, {{if not to}} make, {{a proper}} needle for putting the wicks into the moulds. It should be a hooked piece of wire, like a crochet needle, which catches the wick by its middle and pulls it doubled through the hole. A stick across {{the mouth of the}} mould secures the other end. When the tallow is setting, give an {{additional}} pull downwards. A gun-barrel, with a cork or wad put the required distance down the barrel, has been used for a mould. Pull the candle out by the wick after heating the barrel. Two wads might be used; the one strongly rammed in, to prevent the tallow from running too far, the other merely as a support for the wick. Perhaps, even paper moulds might be used; they could be made by gumming or pasting <b>paper</b> <b>in</b> a <b>roll.</b>|$|R

40|$|The {{objective}} of this work {{was to investigate the}} effect of substrate, color and size on the germination and vigor of Melanoxylon brauna seeds. It was performed two essays. In the first, the seeds were classified by color (light and dark) and size (small and large). In the second essay, it was investigated the influence of substrates on sand, between sand, above paper, between <b>paper</b> and <b>in</b> <b>paper</b> <b>rolls,</b> type germitest. <b>In</b> both essays, the seeds were maintained in controlled conditions (light and temperature) during 10 days. The percentage of germination and germination speed index (GSI) were calculated. Furthermore, it was determined the weight of 1, 000 seeds and the germination of the species was characterized by observation until the seedling formation. The weight of 1, 000 seeds of M. brauna was 133. 43 g, in average. The root protrusion occurred around 72 hours after the beginning of imbibition, and the germination was as epigel phanerocotyledonar. Small and light color seeds presented percentage of germination and GSI lower than others. The large seeds, independent of color, and small dark seeds presented the higher GSI and percentage of germination.

With the purpose of obtaining information about the reproductive spread of this species, it was studied the effect of temperature on seed germination capability. The temperatures used were: 15, 20, 25, 30, 35 and 40 ºC. The seeds were sown on <b>paper</b> towel <b>in</b> <b>roll</b> form, with four replicates of one experimental unit consisted of a roll with 25 seeds. The experiment followed a completely randomized design with six treatments and four replications. There was primary root emission at temperatures of 15 to 40 ºC.

The protrusion of the root began on the seventh day after sowing, except the 15 ºC which provided a slow and gradual process, beginning on the fourteenth day after hatching. At 40 ºC, the germination capability was less than 15 % and there was no normal seedling.

40|$|The Albizia niopoides, {{popularly known}} as white mimosa, is a native forest species of fast-growing and with high {{potential}} for reforestation purposes. However, there is little information about its seminiferous spread. Thus, this study aimed to evaluate the germination performance and vigor of A. niopoides seed under different water volumes for substrate moistening. The experimental design was completely randomized with four replicates and each replicate with 25 seeds. The seeds were sown on germitest <b>paper</b> (arranged <b>in</b> <b>rolls)</b> moistened with water volumes equivalent to 1. 0; 1. 5; 2. 0; 2. 5; 3. 0; 3. 5; and 4. 0 times the dry weight (DW) of the substrate without further water addition. Germination occurred in a germination chamber (Biochemical Oxygen Demand-B. O. D-type) set at 25 °C and continuous light. The analyzed variables were percentage of germination, length of shoot and primary root, dry weight of shoot, and root seedling system. Decreasing effect on germination percentage values, primary root length, and dry weight of the root system from the substrate moistening with the water volume equivalent to 2. 0 times its dry weight were found.

A completely randomized design was used with a 4 x 4 factorial (water volumes and temperatures). The moistening of the substrate with 2. 0, 2. 5, 3. 0 and 3. 5 times the weight of the paper at temperatures of 25, 30 and 20 - 30 ºC can be used for germination and vigor of Parkia platycephala Benth.

Several comparisons between the radar data and the drop-size data demonstrate a tendency for a relationship between the average mean drop diameter and the average height of the echo top, averaging both values throughout a shower. A tendency for a relationship also occurs between the variance of the drop diameter and the average height of the echo top. The average mean echo intensity exhibits a possible correlation with both the mean of the parameter (D[subscript max]-D[subscript min]) (D₁₀₀₀ + D₅₀₀ + D₁₀₀ + D₅₀ + D₁₀ + D₅) and the mean range of drop sizes.
