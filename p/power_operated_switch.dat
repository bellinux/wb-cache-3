40|$|Abstract:- This paper {{describes}} a novel transformer less grid connected ANN based power converter with negative grounding for a photovoltaic generation system. The negative terminal {{of the solar}} cell array can be directly connected {{to the ground in}} the proposed grid-connected power converter to avoid the transparent conducting oxide corrosion that occurs in some types of thin-film solar cell array. The proposed grid-connected power converter consists of a dc–dc power converter and a dc–ac inverter. The salient features of the proposed power converter are that some power electronic switches are simultaneously used in both the dc–dc power converter and dc–ac inverter, and only two <b>power</b> electronic <b>switches</b> <b>operate</b> at high <b>switching</b> frequency at the same time (one is in the dc– dc power converter and the other is in the dc–ac inverter). The leakage current of the photovoltaic generation system is reduced because the negative terminal of the solar cell array is connected directly to the ground. Finally, a prototype was developed to verify the performance of the proposed grid- connected power converter. Performance of the proposed ANN based grid-connected power converter is verified using MATLAB/SIMULINK. I...|$|R
40|$|Pulsed <b>power</b> gas <b>switches</b> <b>operate</b> under extreme {{conditions}} holding off voltages at millions of volts and greater, conducting currents at 100 ’s of kiloamps, and can reliably trigger {{with less than}} 10 ns of jitter at optimal operating conditions. However as Martin and Braginskii had noted the impedance of these switches is dynamic and a function of many parameters such as gas pressure, current, {{and the number of}} channels. In systems such as Protogen or Ursa Minor many gas switches are utilized to enable optimal performance and pulse shaping. A challenge with either system is that, if the switches are tightly coupled and one switch triggers early, then the fields on the second switch change dramatically and can move the second switch into a new operating regime that will result in a different dynamic resistance. This paper presents a least squares approach to extracting the Martin and Braginskii switch resistance with field dependent carrier recombination from measured data. I...|$|R

40|$|Abstract — The {{multilevel}} converter {{has drawn}} tremendous {{interest in the}} power industry. The general structure of the multilevel converter is to synthesize a sinusoidal voltage from several levels of voltages. Multilevel voltage source converters are emerging as {{a new breed of}} power converter options for high power applications. These converter topologies can generate high-quality voltage waveforms with <b>power</b> semiconductor <b>switches</b> <b>operating</b> at a frequency near the fundamental. Among the available multilevel converter topologies, the cascaded multilevel converter constitutes a promising alternative, providing a modular design that can be extended to allow a transformer less connection. A three-phase, seven level cascaded multilevel voltage source inverter with reduced number of switches based DSTATCOM for power line conditioning to improve power quality in the distribution network is used which will compensate the distorted line current harmonics and reactive power. The reference currents for generating switching signals of multilevel inverter are obtained using Instantaneous Real Power Theory. A new dc-link voltage controller is also used which will overcome the disadvantages of conventional Proportional Integral controllers.
