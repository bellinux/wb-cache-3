2500|$|Bieber was GM Department Director {{for just}} {{two and a}} half years, but {{negotiated}} a historic contract with General Motors (GM) in 1982. The early 1980s recession and competition from Japanese automakers had cut very deeply into GM's market share, and the company had laid off more than 140,000 of its 330,000 production workers (roughly half its workforce). UAW membership had fallen to 1.2 million from a peak of 1.5 million in 1979. In March 1981, nine months after Bieber became GM Department head, GM asked the union to reopen its contract and negotiation concessions but the union refused. In November 1981, however, GM began using its worker <b>participation</b> <b>program</b> to convince its unionized employees to reopen their contract. Bieber strongly criticized the company for generating [...] "distrust of the U.A.W. leadership", [...] "spoonfeed" [...] a [...] "captive audience", and perverting the worker <b>participation</b> <b>program</b> into a means to [...] "propagandize or parrot the current views of {{the chairman of the board}} of G.M. as to how to save G.M. through worker sacrifice." [...] But behind the scenes, UAW President Douglas Fraser, Bieber, and others were secretly already talking with GM about reopening the contract. The union agreed to enter into talks in January 1982, hoping to win job security commitments for its members in exchange for wage and benefit concessions. The decision was a historic one, as it was only the second time in UAW history that the union had agreed to reopen a contract. It was historic as well as it was the first concessionary contract the union had negotiated.|$|E

In FY 2007, annual external research funding exceeded $78million. In FY 2009–2010, the research funding is close to $82million. In 2002, Northeastern's Center for Subsurface Sensing and Imaging Systems was designated an NSF Engineering Research Center. In 2004, Northeastern was one of six institutions selected by the National Science Foundation as a center for research in nanotechnology. In 2010, Northeastern was granted $12million by an alum for a Homeland security research facility, to be named the George J.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to analyze the {{relationship}} between citizen engagement in various public <b>participation</b> <b>programs</b> and the participants’ assessment of transparency in local government. To examine this relationship, the study focused on three aspects of citizen participation: (1) citizen engagement in <b>participation</b> <b>programs</b> generally, (2) online versus offline participation, and (3) online or offline participation in policymaking phases specifically. A 2009 survey of residents of Seoul, South Korea, was used to test the study hypotheses, as it provided information from 1, 014 respondents on their citizen participation and their perceptions of transparency in government. Surprisingly, citizens’ engagement in public <b>participation</b> <b>programs</b> was not significantly associated with perceptions of transparency in government. Moreover, citizen <b>participation</b> in online <b>programs</b> had a marginally negative association with assessments of government transparency. However, citizens who engaged in offline <b>participation</b> <b>programs</b> during the policy agenda setting phase indicated a more favorable assessment of transparency in local government...|$|R

The characteristics that might be considered representative of successful modified sport programs are listed, and, as these characteristics venture beyond those demonstrated in research, they provide some suggestive criteria of focus for future research...|$|R

40|$|Excerpt] I {{am happy}} to comment on a provocative {{monograph}} that raises important issues for union policies and strategies. The authors make two main points: 1. Unions should be proactive in developing worker <b>participation</b> <b>programs</b> in industry and should push them beyond the shopfloor into strategic economic and technological issues. 2. As far as possible, worker <b>participation</b> <b>programs</b> should be controlled by the union. Union leaders should firmly reject programs jointly controlled by union and management. I agree with the first point and disagree with the second. I also question what I see as a bias in selecting case examples to support the Banks-Metzgar thesis. If authors are free to choose any cases to support their arguments, they can 2 ̆ 2 prove 2 ̆ 2 almost anything...|$|R
