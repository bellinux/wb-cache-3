50|$|Drawing as a Form of CommunicationDrawing {{is one of}} {{the oldest}} forms of human expression, with {{evidence}} for its existence preceding that of written communication. It is believed that drawing was used as a specialised form of communication before the invention of the written language, demonstrated by the production of cave and rock paintings created by Homo sapiens sapiens around 30,000 years ago. These drawings, known <b>as</b> <b>pictograms,</b> <b>depicted</b> objects and abstract concepts. The sketches and paintings produced in prehistoric times were eventually stylised and simplified, leading to the development of the written language as we know it today.|$|R
40|$|A {{study was}} {{conducted}} at Pumula Clinic in Bulawayo to assess the usefulness of pictorial labeling in increased patient understanding. The {{results of the study}} indicate that compliance was significantly improved by the use of <b>pictograms</b> <b>as</b> opposed to written instructions. Such a scheme, if implemented on a national scale, should improve health care in Zimbabwe...|$|R

It was introduced on 1 January 1965 and has been updated many times since. The signage recommended by the committee made heavy use of <b>pictograms,</b> <b>as</b> was the tradition in mainland Europe, together with a new typeface developed by Kinneir and Calvert.|$|R

Pictograms designed by Migrantas {{are similar to}} those found all over in the world in public spaces where they are normally used in place of written language in advertising and street signs. The difference between Migrantas' pictograms is that they are used to highlight the individual, cultural, socio-economic and political aspects of migration.|$|R
40|$|The paper {{outlines}} the theoretical {{framework for the}} concept of applying analytical psychology to architectural design. What has been discussed are methods and process of designing tools {{for the analysis of}} perceptual experiences resulting from the representations of the notions used in the description of the architectural space attributes. A tool is presented – pictogram test based on the graphic reduction of the language of architecture as well as environmental research results confirming its accuracy. The presented methods of analysis concern <b>pictograms</b> <b>as</b> well as perceptual experience presumption errors in the design process. The errors a designer unwary of the complexity of the perceptual experience of the designed architectural space could be prone to have also been identified. Piotr Szymańsk...|$|R
30|$|These {{initiatives}} of the ICCR {{focus more}} on promoting trade than ensuring consumer safety and environmental protection through appropriate RC mechanisms on the label that are comprehensible by the consumer. Nor are manufacturers required to identify hazardous substances through signal words, precautionary statements or <b>pictograms</b> <b>as</b> {{is the case with}} non-PCP hazardous substances (e.g., pesticides, industrial chemicals). Globally, there is a trend to harmonize labelling of products containing hazardous chemicals in order to promote trade. The assumption is that harmonizing labels will also promote effective RC.|$|R
50|$|Aulagnier, {{founding}} member of the journal Tropique {{is considered one of the}} most influential French psychoanalysts of her generation, together with Jean Laplanche, Jean-Bertrand Pontalis and André Green. Aulagnier created an original, if difficult theory of child psychosis, revolving around the experiences of infant-mother relationships in early childhood, and drawing on and developing the theories of both Winnicott and Lacan. In particular she proposed the concept of the <b>pictogram</b> <b>as</b> an initial link between the body zones and the first mental representations; and continued to work for a theoretical recuperation of the importance of body and feelings as non-verbal presences within early thought.|$|R

50|$|Pictography {{is a form}} {{of writing}} which uses representational, {{pictorial}} drawings, similarly to cuneiform and, to some extent, hieroglyphic writing, which also uses drawings as phonetic letters or determinative rhymes. Some <b>pictograms,</b> such <b>as</b> Hazards <b>pictograms,</b> are elements of formal languages.|$|R
40|$|Considering the {{importance}} of Internet-based communications in our society, the lack of Instant Messaging (IM) services adapted to individuals with cognitive disabilities who have difficulties using written language creates a situation of exclusion that has {{a negative impact on}} their daily lives. To alleviate this situation we present Messenger Visual, an IM service that uses <b>pictograms</b> <b>as</b> the main communication system. Along the paper we introduce the main design aspects of an IM service to support pictogram-based communications, as well as the design and evaluation aspects of an IM client that takes into account both the pictogram-based communication and the user interface accessibility requirements of individuals with cognitive disabilities.

40|$|It {{is ironic}} that Otto Neurath, one of those {{responsible}} for the ‘linguistic turn’ in philosophy of the twentieth century, should have been concerned during the last twenty years of his life with developing a ‘pictorial language’. By using simplified <b>pictograms</b> <b>as</b> components, the Wiener Methode der Bildstatistik (later called Isotype) bypassed verbal language to a great extent, creating the potential for universal understanding of biological, social and economic correlations. However, despite its consistency and rigour, Isotype was not a complete language, and Neurath knew that it never could be. This paper will examine the linguistic characteristics of Isotype and describe the deliberate resistance on the part of its creators to develop a full theory behind it...|$|R
40|$|This article {{discusses}} {{the challenges of}} visually representing pain qualities in pictogram design. An existing set of 12 pictograms designed for people with literacy problems was evaluated to understand more about misunderstandings of pictogram interpretation. Two sets of university students from different disciplines were asked to interpret the pictograms, and a novel classification system was developed to categorise answer types, as ‘location’, ‘affective’, temporal’ or ‘literal’. Several design recommendations are made as a result that will help improve the design of pain <b>pictograms</b> <b>as</b> a whole as well as guide designers of related pictogram work. We demonstrate how, through the robust classification of incorrect responses, {{it is possible to}} extract useful comprehension error patterns to inform future design...|$|R
50|$|The Yugtun or Alaska {{script is}} a syllabary invented {{around the year}} 1900 by Uyaquq to write the Central Alaskan Yup'ik language. Uyaquq, who was {{monolingual}} in Yup'ik, initially used indigenous <b>pictograms</b> <b>as</b> a form of proto-writing {{that served as a}} mnemonic in preaching the Bible. However, when he realized that this did not allow him to reproduce the exact words of a passage the way the Latin alphabet did for English-speaking missionaries, he and his assistants developed it until it became a full syllabary. Although Uyaquq never learned English or the Latin alphabet, he was influenced by both. The syllable kut, for example, resembles the cursive form of the English word good.|$|R
50|$|The first {{citation}} of {{the city}} in the historical literature belongs to the famous book Mojem Alboldan, by Yaqut Homavi (13th century) which introduces the Birjand as the most beautiful town in the Qohestan. Before this, Birjand had been probably not as big and important as a municipality but rather as a rural community. However, the Birjand geographical area had its historical and political importance long before the emergence {{of the city}} of Birjand. Many citations of the region are available in the original literature like Ehya -ol- Molook of the once important localities in the area. Apart from literature, the oldest evidence {{on the history of the}} region is the ancient Lakh-Mazar inscription in the Kooch village some 25 km south east of Birjand. Numerous fine drawings and inscriptions are carved on an igneous rock surface. The inscriptions include <b>pictograms</b> <b>as</b> well as Arsacid Pahlavi, Sasanian Pahlavi, Arabic and Persian scripts. The former tribe famous for the region of Birjand is called Sagarthian - historically in union with the Parthian.|$|R

40|$|Class of 2011 AbstractOBJECTIVES: To {{design and}} {{evaluate}} a dosing schedule pictogram in an elderly population. To identify possible reasons for misunderstanding of a dosing schedule pictogram and, if appropriate, redesign the pictogram to reflect reasons for misunderstanding. METHODS: Through a modified focus group analysis involving {{residents of a}} retirement community in Tucson, Arizona, the understandability of a morning-noon-night color pictogram was assessed. Residents’ interpretation of the <b>pictogram</b> <b>as</b> correct or incorrect was assessed using a decision-tree analysis. The percentage of correct responses was calculated and compared to established pictogram criteria for acceptability. Lastly, potential reasons for misunderstanding were assessed. RESULTS: Thirteen residents, six males and seven females, participated in the study. The rate of correct interpretation was 84. 6...|$|R

It {{was during this}} early period in New York that Honegger-Lavater became influenced by American street advertising and began to utilize <b>pictograms</b> <b>as</b> graphic representations of linguistic elements in her work. In 1962, the New York City Museum of Modern Art published her William Tell as a single sheet lithograph, accordion folded in the [...] "Leporello" [...] style, with a legend listing the meanings of the various symbols (e.g., a single blue dot represents William Tell). The story proceeds chronologically as the book unfolds, and is told entirely by using the symbols without words.
