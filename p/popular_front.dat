5|$|The Spanish Civil War, fought between 1936–39, {{provided}} an opportunity for many European countries to evaluate new technologies and tactics, including armored warfare. At {{the beginning of the}} war, the Nationalist and Popular Fronts each possessed only five World War I-era-design Renault FT light tanks, although these were soon reinforced with imported materiel. Italy began supplying Nationalist Spain with L3/35 tankettes in August 1936. The Soviet Union soon followed suit by supplying the <b>Popular</b> <b>Front</b> with T-26 light tanks in October 1936. Germany sent its first shipments of Panzer I light tanks to the Nationalist Front in September 1936. During the war, France and Poland provided the <b>Popular</b> <b>Front</b> with a number of additional FT light tanks. A considerable number of tanks delivered to the <b>Popular</b> <b>Front</b> were subsequently captured; many of these were put into service against their former owners.|$|E
5|$|In 1935 Azaña and Indalecio Prieto {{started to}} unify the left and to combat its extreme elements. They staged large, popular rallies of {{what would become the}} <b>Popular</b> <b>Front.</b> Lerroux's Radical {{government}} collapsed after two major scandals, including the Straperlo affair. However, Zamora did not allow the CEDA to form a government, instead calling elections. The elections of 1936 were won by the <b>Popular</b> <b>Front,</b> with vastly smaller resources than the political right who followed Nazi propaganda techniques. The right began to plan how to best overthrow the Republic, rather than taking control of it.|$|E
5|$|Like Nasser, Gaddafi favoured the Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat and his group, Fatah, {{over more}} militant and Marxist Palestinian groups. As the years progressed however, Gaddafi's {{relationship}} with Arafat became strained, with Gaddafi considering him too moderate {{and calling for}} more violent action. Instead he supported militias like the <b>Popular</b> <b>Front</b> for the Liberation of Palestine, <b>Popular</b> <b>Front</b> for the Liberation of Palestine – General Command, the Democratic Front for the Liberation of Palestine, As-Sa'iqa, the Palestinian Popular Struggle Front, and the Abu Nidal Organization. He funded the Black September Organization whose members perpetrated the 1972 Munich massacre of Israeli athletes in West Germany, and had the killed militants' bodies flown to Libya for a hero's funeral.|$|E

40|$|This article {{considers}} the political {{success of the}} Baltic <b>Popular</b> <b>Fronts</b> in the years of perestroika on the materials of 1989 — 1990 elections. The author analyses the motives behind the establishment of mass movements and their ideational imperatives, describes the dynamics {{of changes in the}} demands of <b>popular</b> <b>fronts,</b> and comes to a conclusion about their significance {{for the establishment of a}} multi-party system in the Baltics...|$|R
5|$|The Nationalist and Popular armies also {{designed}} and manufactured {{a number of}} their own tanks. The Nationalists, for example, began the war with three Trubia A4 prototypes, manufactured {{before the beginning of}} the conflict. They also completed the first prototype of the Verdeja light tank. This was designed to overcome the shortcomings of tanks provided by the Germans and the Italians, as well as Soviet tanks captured from the <b>Popular</b> <b>Front.</b> <b>Popular</b> <b>Front</b> production of armored vehicles was segmented throughout different areas of Spain. In the north, between 15 and 20 Carro Trubia-Naval tanks were manufactured at the factory in Sestao, conversely the Trubia factory had built only a single model Landesa tank. In Catalonia, two tanks were produced by the Maquinaría Moderna factory in Sant Sadurní d'Anoia. Though the <b>Popular</b> <b>Front</b> designed and manufactured many more armored fighting vehicles than the Nationalists, this ultimately worked in the Nationalists favor as the factories and their production lines were captured intact during the war.|$|E
5|$|Speaking at a Chautauqua {{conference in}} Jūrmala, Latvia in June 1986, Matlock {{told the crowd}} that the United States did not {{recognize}} the incorporation of the Baltic States into the Soviet Union. His remarks are credited by Dainis Īvāns, leader of the <b>Popular</b> <b>Front</b> of Latvia, with galvanizing the independence movement in Latvia.|$|E
5|$|There {{are several}} {{branches}} {{of political parties}} on the council, including Communist, Islamist, and secular. The leftist factions of the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) such as the <b>Popular</b> <b>Front</b> for the Liberation of Palestine (PFLP) and the Palestinian People's Party (PPP) usually dominate the reserved seats. Hamas gained {{the majority of the}} open seats in the 2005 Palestinian municipal elections.|$|E
50|$|The French Front populaire and the Spanish Frente <b>Popular</b> <b>popular</b> <b>fronts</b> of the 1930s are {{the most}} {{important}} ones.|$|R
50|$|Many historians {{consider}} the <b>Popular</b> <b>Front's</b> electoral victory {{as the first}} event in the immediate {{chain of events that}} led to the military rebellion against the Republic on 17-18 July 1936.|$|R
50|$|In 1988 Gorbachev {{started to}} lose control of two small but {{troublesome}} regions of the Soviet Union, as the Baltic republics were captured by their <b>popular</b> <b>fronts,</b> and the Caucasus descended into violence and civil war.|$|R
5|$|Despite a {{relatively}} small mandate in terms of votes, some socialists {{took to the streets}} to free political prisoners, without waiting for the government to do so officially. There were claims of an imminent socialist or anarchist takeover. The right had firmly believed, at all levels, that they would win. Portela would, a year later, claim that Gil-Robles and General Francisco Franco had approached him within days to the election to propose a military takeover. Portela resigned, even before a new government could be formed. However, the <b>Popular</b> <b>Front,</b> which had proved an effective election tool, did not translate into a <b>Popular</b> <b>Front</b> government. Largo Caballero and other elements of the political left were not prepared to work with the republicans, although they did agree to support much of the proposed reforms. Manuel Azaña Díaz was called upon to form a government, but would shortly replace Zamora as president. The right began to conspire as to how to best overthrow the republic, rather than taking control of it.|$|E
5|$|On September 16, 1944, {{leaders of}} the Blocco del popolo (<b>Popular</b> <b>Front)</b> in Sicily, the {{communist}} Girolamo Li Causi and Pantaleone, went {{to speak to the}} landless labourers at a rally in Villalba, challenging Don Calò in his own personal fiefdom. In the morning tensions rose when Christian Democrat mayor Beniamino Farina – a relative of Vizzini as well as his successor as mayor – angered local communists by ordering all hammer-and-sickle signs erased from buildings along the road on which Li Causi would travel into town. When his supporters protested, they were intimidated by separatists and thugs.|$|E
5|$|The Spanish coup of July 1936 {{fractured}} the Spanish Republican Armed Forces {{and marked}} the beginning of the Spanish Civil War. Following a period of troubles in the Second Spanish Republic, a group of officers attempted to overthrow the left-wing <b>Popular</b> <b>Front</b> government, elected five months previously, in a military coup. Planning started in early 1936, and the coup was launched on 17 and 18 July. The coup failed to take complete control of the country and civil war ensued.|$|E
5000|$|The ITAR-TASS {{news agency}} reported, quoting the Azerbaijani <b>Popular</b> <b>Front's</b> {{information}} center, that [...] "more than 20 {{people were killed}} and 15 wounded" [...] when Armenian militants captured the village and forced the residents to flee to a nearby forest.|$|R
5000|$|Not all coalitions who use {{the term}} [...] "popular front" [...] meet the {{definition}} for [...] "popular fronts", and not all <b>popular</b> <b>fronts</b> use the term [...] "popular front" [...] in their name. The same applies to [...] "united fronts".|$|R
50|$|In neo-Trotskyist theory, however, such an {{alliance}} was rejected as being based either on a false strategy of <b>popular</b> <b>fronts,</b> or on political opportunism, {{said to be}} incompatible either with apermanent revolution or with the principle of independent working class political action.|$|R
5|$|During the referendum, 84% of the {{approximately}} 7.5 million voters approved the amendments. On November 28 of that year, President Lukashenko signed the changes into law. Other results {{not directly related to}} the voting included the expanding role of the Council of Ministers, which allowed it to deal with issues related to development of economic, social and political spheres within Belarus. The 1996 referendum was not, however, the first call to dissolve the Supreme Soviet. In 1991 and 1992, after the August coup in Moscow by senior CPSU officials, democratic forces in the government wanted to dissolve the Supreme Soviet permanently. The members of the Belarusian <b>Popular</b> <b>Front</b> pressed for a referendum, and despite achieving the number of signatures required by law at the time, the Supreme Soviet quashed the measure.|$|E
5|$|In 1941 {{the flag}} was allowed for usage by the Nazi {{occupation}} administration, {{and it appeared}} on arm patches of Belarusian volunteers in the German Army and Waffen SS and {{was used by the}} Belarusian Central Rada, the pro-German government of Belarus in 1943–1944. After the end of World War II the flag was used by Belarusian diaspora in the West and by small groups of anti-Soviet resistance in Belarus itself. In late 1980s the flag was again used as a symbol of national revival and democratic changes in Belarus. By proposal of the Belarusian <b>Popular</b> <b>Front</b> the flag became state symbol of Belarus upon its regaining of independence in 1991.|$|E
5|$|On 18July 1936, {{war broke}} out on the Iberian {{peninsula}} as Spain dissolved {{into a state of}} civil war. After the chaos of the initial uprising, two opposing sides coalesced and began to consolidate their position—the <b>Popular</b> <b>front</b> (the Republicans) and the Spanish Nationalist front. In an early example of a proxy war, both sides quickly received support from other countries, most notably the Soviet Union and Germany as both wanted to test their tactics and equipment. The first shipment of foreign tanks, 50 Soviet T-26s, arrived on the 15 of October. The shipment was under the surveillance of Nazi Germany's Kriegsmarine and Germany immediately responded by sending 41 PanzerI's to Spain a few days later. This first shipment was followed by four more shipments of PanzerI Ausf.B's, with 122 vehicles shipped in total.|$|E
5000|$|As Stalinism came to {{dominate}} the Comintern, the united front strategy was dropped. In the period preceding Adolf Hitler's electoral victory in Germany, the Comintern argued that the social democrats were [...] "social fascists" [...] and that they, rather than the Nazis, represented the real danger. Following Hitler's victory, the Comintern argued for <b>popular</b> <b>fronts</b> drawing in forces far beyond the working class movement. Trotsky, now exiled from the USSR, argued that the first conclusion was disastrous because it prevented unity against the far right, and that the second, emphasizing <b>popular</b> <b>fronts,</b> was disastrous because {{the terms of the}} struggle would be dictated by mainstream liberal parties. He feared that the communists would have to subordinate their politics within the alliance. Trotsky continued to argue for a workers' united front against fascism.|$|R

5|$|Although {{hesitant}} {{at first}} to take sides in the conflict, Arafat and Fatah {{played an important role}} in the Lebanese Civil War. Succumbing to pressure from PLO sub-groups such as the PFLP, DFLP and the Palestine Liberation Front (PLF), Arafat aligned the PLO with the Communist and Nasserist Lebanese National Movement (LNM). The LNM was led by Kamal Jumblatt, who had a friendly relationship with Arafat and other PLO leaders. Although originally aligned with Fatah, Syrian President Hafez al-Assad feared a loss of influence in Lebanon and switched sides. He sent his army, along with the Syrian-backed Palestinian factions of as-Sa'iqa and the <b>Popular</b> <b>Front</b> for the Liberation of Palestine – General Command (PFLP-GC) led by Ahmad Jibril to fight alongside right-wing Christian forces against the PLO and the LNM. The primary components of the Christian front were the Phalangists loyal to Bachir Gemayel and the Tigers Militia led by Dany Chamoun, a son of former President Camille Chamoun.|$|E
5|$|Elections in 1936 were {{won by a}} {{grouping}} of left-wing parties united as the <b>Popular</b> <b>Front.</b> The right began to conspire {{as to how to}} best overthrow the republic, rather than taking control of it. The government was weak, and Azaña led a minority government. Pacification and reconciliation would have been a huge task. Acts of violence and reprisals spiralled. In April, parliament replaced Zamora with Azaña as president. However, Azaña was increasingly isolated from everyday politics; his replacement, Casares Quiroga, was weak. This was a watershed event which inspired conservatives to give up on parliamentary politics. CEDA turned its campaign chest over to army plotter Emilio Mola. Monarchist José Calvo Sotelo replaced CEDA's Gil-Robles as the right's leading spokesman in Parliament. Prieto did his best to avoid revolution, promoting a series of public works and civil order reforms, including parts of the military and civil guard. Communists quickly took over the ranks of socialist organisations, scaring the middle classes. Several generals decided that the government had to be replaced if the dissolution of Spain was to be prevented. They held professional politicians in contempt.|$|E
5|$|In June 1976, Amin {{allowed an}} Air France {{airliner}} from Tel Aviv to Paris hijacked by {{two members of}} the <b>Popular</b> <b>Front</b> for the Liberation of Palestine – External Operations (PFLP-EO) and {{two members of the}} German Revolutionäre Zellen to land at Entebbe Airport. The hijackers were joined there by three more. Soon after, 156 non-Jewish hostages who did not hold Israeli passports were released and flown to safety, while 83 Jews and Israeli citizens, as well as 20 others who refused to abandon them (among whom were the captain and crew of the hijacked Air France jet), continued to be held hostage. In the subsequent Israeli rescue operation, codenamed Operation Thunderbolt (popularly known as Operation Entebbe), on the night of 3–4 July 1976, a group of Israeli commandos were flown in from Israel and seized control of Entebbe Airport, freeing nearly all the hostages. Three hostages died during the operation and 10 were wounded; 7 hijackers, about 45 Ugandan soldiers, and 1 Israeli soldier, Yoni Netanyahu, were killed. A fourth hostage, 75-year-old Dora Bloch, an elderly Jewish Englishwoman who had been taken to Mulago Hospital in Kampala before the rescue operation, was subsequently murdered in reprisal. The incident further soured Uganda's international relations, leading the United Kingdom to close its High Commission in Uganda.|$|E
50|$|A cross-class {{alliance}} {{is a term}} for an organisation that bypasses social-economic classes in pursuit of its aim. It is often used by Trotskyists as a term of abuse towards <b>popular</b> <b>fronts</b> as they prefer working class united fronts, however some also accuse some supposed united fronts as being cross class alliances.|$|R
50|$|Jibril {{became the}} leader of the {{military}} wing of the PFLP-GC and was the heir apparent of the organization before he was killed. He was {{also a member of the}} <b>Popular</b> <b>Front’s</b> executive committee. Jibril was reported to have been participated in an airborne attack on Israel in 1987, killing six Israeli soldiers.|$|R
50|$|Pedro Aguirre Cerda (February 6, 1879 - November 25, 1941) was a Chilean {{political}} figure. A {{member of}} the Radical Party, he {{was chosen as the}} <b>Popular</b> <b>Front's</b> candidate for the 1938 presidential election, and was triumphally elected. He governed Chile until his death in 1941. Pedro Aguirre Cerda was of Basque descent.|$|R
5|$|The Constitution {{introduces}} {{separation of}} powers. According to Belarusian law, each office is separate but {{must work together}} to serve the people. The Constitution also makes Belarus a presidential democracy, significantly reducing {{the role of the}} prime minister. Of the fifteen former Soviet republics, Belarus was the one of latest to create and pass a new constitution subsequent to the dissolution of the USSR. A delay occurred due to debates among Supreme Soviet deputies, who were also trying to stave off the opposition and democratic forces who wanted to close the Supreme Soviet down for good. A power struggle to determine the relationship between the new executive branch and the legislature caused much of the debate in 1992 and 1993. The former chairman of the Supreme Soviet, Stanislau Shushkevich, criticized the early drafts due to the amount of power granted to the president. The opposition Belarusian <b>Popular</b> <b>Front</b> criticized the final drafts {{due to the lack of}} balance between the two parties and for allowing Vyachaslau Kebich to run for presidential elections in June of that year despite serving in the same role with the SSR.|$|E
5|$|In {{the late}} night hours of 24 October 2001, during the Second Intifada, the Israeli Army (IDF) {{launched}} an incursion into Beit Rima in {{what became the}} first major Israeli military raid into Palestinian-controlled territory, according to Human Rights Watch (HRW). The IDF stated {{the intent of the}} raid was to capture the alleged killers of Israeli Tourism Minister Rehavam Ze'evi, who was shot dead by members of the <b>Popular</b> <b>Front</b> for the Liberation of Palestine (PFLP) in retaliation for Israel's assassination of the party's leader Mustafa Zibri (Abu Ali Mustafa) in August. About 50 people from Beit Rima were detained and brought to the Israeli settlement of Halamish for interrogation. Most were released before the day's end, but eleven men remained in Israeli custody, two of whom Israel alleged to be directly involved in Ze'evi's assassination. In the course of the raid, Israeli forces killed six Palestinians, including three members of the Palestinian National Security Forces and two officers from the Civil Police, and wounded seven others. The Palestinian authorities in Beit Rima stated they had not received prior warning from the IDF and their slain men had been resting in an olive grove near the local police station, while Israeli military officials stated all those killed had either fired on Israeli forces or approached them threateningly and all were members of various armed groups. The HRW stated that the Red Crescent was prevented from treating the injured men until 7:00 am, a delay that resulted in the death of two of the police officers. Israeli forces also demolished three homes in the town, alleging that they belonged to family members of Ze'evi's killers.|$|E
25|$|When the Spanish Civil War erupted {{after the}} failed right-wing coup in 1936, Secretary of State Cordell Hull {{moved quickly to}} ban {{what would have been}} {{legitimate}} arms sales to the democratically elected left-wing <b>Popular</b> <b>Front</b> government of the Second Spanish Republic, forcing the <b>Popular</b> <b>Front</b> to turn to the Soviet Union for support.|$|E

50|$|The Palestinian <b>Popular</b> Struggle <b>Front</b> is a Palestinian {{political}} faction led by Khalid ‘Abd al-Majid.

50|$|The Communist Party of Great Britain {{took its}} {{lead from the}} Communist Party of the Soviet Union (CPSU). The view of the CPSU in the mid-to-late 1930s was that Communist parties across Europe should form <b>Popular</b> <b>fronts</b> to work with all other anti-Fascist parties to oppose Fascism. The CPGB was happy to fall {{in line with this}} position.|$|R
