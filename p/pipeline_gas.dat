40|$|Abstract. Fire risk of <b>gas</b> <b>pipeline</b> leakage is high. The factors {{contributing}} to <b>gas</b> <b>pipeline</b> leakage most are third party damage, corrosion, design and incorrect operation. The accident consequences of <b>gas</b> <b>pipeline</b> leakage and quantitative risk assessment method of <b>gas</b> <b>pipeline</b> leakage consequence are analyzed. In order to achieve quantitative fire risk assessment of <b>gas</b> <b>pipeline</b> leakage, flash fire model, vapor cloud explosion model and thermal radiation damage criterion are analyzed. Firstly, the gas leakage quantity is estimated. Then, the heat radiation estimate flux, the thermal dose and damage range are got by using flash fire model, vapor cloud explosion model and the thermal radiation damage criterion respectively. Combined with an example of <b>gas</b> <b>pipeline,</b> damage ranges of different disaster patterns are estimated according to different <b>gas</b> <b>pipeline</b> leakage pattern. Through comparing the accident consequences of <b>gas</b> <b>pipeline</b> leakage, this paper provides some reliable scientific references for <b>gas</b> <b>pipeline</b> management departments...|$|R
