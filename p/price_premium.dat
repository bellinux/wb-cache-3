5|$|Lexus' {{arrival in}} the Japanese market in July 2005 marked the first {{introduction}} of a Japanese premium car marque in the domestic market. New generation LS, IS, ES, GS, and RX models subsequently became available in Japan along with the SC 430, ending domestic sales of Toyota-branded models under the Celsior, Altezza, Windom, Aristo, Harrier, and Soarer nameplates, respectively. The Altezza and Aristo were previously exclusive to Japanese Toyota retail sales channels called Toyota Vista Store, the Windom was exclusive to Toyota Corolla Store, the Celsior and Harrier were exclusive to Toyopet Store, and the Soarer was previously available at both Toyota Store and Toyopet Store locations. Lexus models sold in Japan featured higher specifications and a <b>price</b> <b>premium</b> compared with their discontinued Toyota counterparts. Sales for the first half-year were slower than expected, affected by the contraction of the domestic auto market and price increases, but improved in subsequent months with an expanded lineup.|$|E

40|$|World {{markets for}} a number of grains (soybeans, corn, canola and cottonseed) have become {{differentiated}} into GM, certified non-GM and organic segments, which has created opportunities and challenges for grain market participants. This paper summarises the evidence to date on the extent of <b>price</b> <b>premiums</b> for non-GM products throughout the world. A broad economic framework is employed to explain the observed pattern of <b>price</b> <b>premiums.</b> The key conclusion of the analysis is that world grains markets for which there are GM variants are dominated by GM grains, but there are niches for certified non-GM and organically produced grains, for which <b>price</b> <b>premiums</b> are paid. With some certified non-GM grains for a specific purpose, <b>price</b> <b>premiums</b> appear to be increasing. Apart from consumer attitudes, the key drivers of <b>price</b> <b>premiums</b> are mandatory labelling of GM products in some key grain consuming countries (particularly high income countries), higher production costs for non-GM crops and the cost of identity preservation.

25|$|The cathodes of {{some early}} 2007 {{lithium-ion}} batteries {{are made from}} lithium-cobalt metal oxide. This material is expensive, and cells made with it can release oxygen if overcharged. If the cobalt is replaced with iron phosphates, the cells will not burn or release oxygen under any charge. The <b>price</b> <b>premium</b> for early 2007 conventional hybrids is about US$5000, some US$3000 of which is for their NiMH battery packs. At early 2007 gasoline and electricity prices, that would mean a break-even point after six to ten years of operation. The conventional hybrid premium could fall to US$2000 in five years, with US$1200 or more of that being cost of lithium-ion batteries, providing for a three-year payback. The payback period may be longer for plug-in hybrids, because of their larger, more expensive batteries.|$|E
25|$|Machine-knitted jumpers {{tend to use}} finer wool, cotton, or {{synthetic}} yarn and have less complex patterns, {{since many of the}} traditional stitches cannot be reproduced this way. They are generally flatter, lighter and less substantial, without the pronounced texture of a hand knitted or hand loomed jumper. Machine knitted jumpers will loosen with wear, and so it is advisable to buy one size smaller than the size of the sweater usually worn. They are the least expensive option. Hand-looming allows more complicated stitches to be used, will have fewer stitches to the inch and be thicker. The best quality hand-loomed jumpers are almost indistinguishable from hand knit. Hand-knit jumpers tend to be more tightly knit, to have more complex stitch patterns and to be longer-lasting and they attract a significant <b>price</b> <b>premium.</b> By holding them up to light, the difference between the machine knit and hand knit is evident.|$|E

40|$|Consumers buy organic {{products}} to increase utility, while farmers invest in organic production to achieve <b>price</b> <b>premiums.</b> However, investors {{would like to}} avoid the risk of falling prices when organic supply increases to maintain profit. We suggest the use of market integration tests between non-stationary price series of organic/conventional products to reveal whether increasing organic supply {{can be expected to}} reduce <b>price</b> <b>premiums.</b> Increased organic supply will induce price falls if organic/conventional markets are independent. Organic supply growth will leave <b>price</b> <b>premiums</b> unchanged, if <b>prices</b> move together over time, since conventional supply typically is larger than organic. The method is applied to the Danish market for farmed salmonids. Cointegration is identified up- and down-stream, while the Law of One Price only holds upstream in the long run. Upstream, conventional trout is market leader, while impulse-response functions identify significant short run responses from conventional to organic trout prices, but not vice versa. Downstream, market leaders cannot be identified, nevertheless impulse-response analysis show significant short run responses from conventional to organic salmonid prices, however, no significance is detected in the opposite direction. The result indicates that organic salmonid prices are tied to the conventional market and do not develop independently. Hence, it can be expected that <b>price</b> <b>premiums</b> are maintained when investing in organic salmonid farming...|$|R

A survey of 701 eBay users is conducted which compares the <b>price</b> <b>premiums</b> of two nearly identical online auction businesses, one that has online auction listings with a perceived high quality and the other that has substantially lower perceived quality.

In fact, it shows that sellers with good website quality are all perceived to be equally trustworthy regardless of their eBay reputation; whereas sellers with poor website quality are not perceived to be trustworthy even if they have a high eBay reputation score. The results also show that the trust resulting from increased website quality increases intention to transact and results in <b>price</b> <b>premiums</b> of 12 % (on average) for sellers with higher quality listings. Theories from marketing, economics, and social psychology are used to explain why website quality induces trust in unknown vendors without providing any concrete evidence regarding the vendor’s past history...|$|R

40|$|For online marketplaces {{to succeed}} and prevent a market of ‘lemons’, their {{feedback}} technologies {{must be able}} to differentiate among sellers and generate <b>price</b> <b>premiums</b> for trustworthy ones (as returns to their superior feedback). However, the literature has solely focused on positive and negative feedback ratings, alas ignoring the role of feedback text comments. These text comments are proposed to convey useful tacit knowledge about a seller’s prior transactions that cannot be described by simple positive and negative ratings. This study examines the ‘hidden’ content of feedback text comments and its role in building buyer’s trust in a seller’s benevolence and credibility. In turn, benevolence and credibility are proposed to influence the <b>price</b> <b>premiums</b> that a seller receives from buyers. This paper utilizes content analysis to analyze over 10, 000 feedback text comments of 420 sellers in eBay’s online auction marketplace, and match them with survey responses from 420 buyers that recently purchased products from these sellers. These dyadic data show that feedback comments create <b>price</b> <b>premiums</b> for trustworthy sellers by influencing buyer trust beliefs in a seller’s benevolence and credibility (even after controlling for the impact of positive and negative ratings). The analysis of feedback comments does provide a superior explanatory power in benevolence and credibility. Interestingly, the addition of benevolence (which has been ignored in online auctions) provides an outstanding predictive power on <b>price</b> <b>premiums</b> (R 2 = 50 %) compared to prior studies (R 2 = 20 - 30 %) ...|$|R
