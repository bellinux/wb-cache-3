The album was edited on an aged machine {{that had previously been}} used to cut together dialog for movies in the 1970s. Its computer threw the entire album out of phase. Shields was able to <b>put</b> <b>it</b> <b>back</b> <b>together</b> from memory, yet when it came to mastering the album, to Creation's dismay, he needed 13 days, rather than the usual one day.|$|E
5|$|In 1997, Matt and Jeff {{created their}} own wrestling promotion, The Organization of Modern Extreme Grappling Arts (frequently {{abbreviated}} to OMEGA Championship Wrestling, or simply OMEGA), in which Matt competed under the name High Voltage. The Hardys launched the promotion because, at the time, there weren't many places to wrestle, nor did they know anyone who could help. Both Matt and Jeff would take apart the ring and <b>put</b> <b>it</b> <b>back</b> <b>together</b> at every event they had, while Matt sewed all the costumes worn in OMEGA. The promotion would fold in October 1999, after both Matt and Jeff signed with the World Wrestling Federation. Eight years later in 2007, Highspots.com produced a two-disc DVD set entitled OMEGA: Uncommon Passion, chronicling {{the history of the}} promotion, including matches and interviews with many OMEGA wrestlers.|$|E

500|$|After six of {{the seven}} continents are {{returned}} to normal, Chip is able to regain his memory; he is in fact Dark Gaia's opposite, Light Gaia. Since the beginning of time, {{the two of them}} had been in a cycle where Dark Gaia would break the planet apart, and Light Gaia would <b>put</b> <b>it</b> <b>back</b> <b>together.</b> Chip was released along with Dark Gaia, but because both of them were released prematurely, he lost his memory, and Dark Gaia was broken apart. They are able to place the last Chaos Emerald in the shrine on the final continent at Eggman's new empire, [...] "Eggmanland", but are interrupted by him; Sonic then defeats Eggman who is using a robot that utilizes Dark Gaia's power. During the battle, the three sink into the core of the Earth and encounter [...] Dark Gaia. Eggman orders Dark Gaia to destroy Sonic, but it turns on him, knocking him away with one of its tentacles, and absorbs the power that turned Sonic into a Werehog, curing Sonic of lycanthropy, and uses that power to become Semi-Perfect Dark Gaia.|$|E

That problem was solved in 976 by Zhang Sixun by replacing the water with mercury, which remains liquid down to [...] Zhang implemented the changes into his clock tower, which was about [...] tall, with escapements to keep the clock turning and bells to signal every quarter-hour. Another noteworthy clock, the elaborate Cosmic Engine, was built by Su Song, in 1088. It was {{about the size of}} Zhang's tower, but had an automatically rotating armillary sphere—also called a celestial globe—from which the positions of the stars could be observed. It also featured five panels with mannequins ringing gongs or bells, and tablets showing the time of day, or other special times. Furthermore, it featured the first known endless power-transmitting chain drive in horology. Originally built in the capital of Kaifeng, it was dismantled by the Jin army and sent to the capital of Yanjing (now Beijing), where they were unable to <b>put</b> <b>it</b> <b>back</b> <b>together.</b> As a result, Su Song's son Su Xie was ordered to build a replica.|$|E

A fake head was created from a model cast of actress Victoria Morsell's head, with pumps installed to pump fake blood into it, and strings attached {{to either side}} {{so it could be}} pulled apart. The crew only had one head model, so they had to keep <b>putting</b> <b>it</b> <b>back</b> <b>together</b> and reusing <b>it</b> over and over for each take.

2500|$|The [...] "abiding {{passion of}} his life" [...] was ceramics, and the 1970s and 1980s gave Williams ample {{opportunities}} in that field.

500|$|When the game's {{text was}} {{translated}} from Japanese to English, the game {{needed to be}} reprogrammed {{in order to accomplish}} this; different companies handled this process in different ways. Tecmo's Japanese writers wrote rough translations in English, and they would then fax them to the American division. According to Criona, the American division would [...] "edit it and <b>put</b> <b>it</b> <b>back</b> <b>together,</b> telling the story in a context that an American English speaker would understand. This would go back and forth several times." [...] Moreover, the game's text was stored in picture files instead of raw computer text, and because of the NES' hardware limitations, the English text need to be very clear and concise to fall within those limitations; many times, different words with the same meaning but with fewer characters had to be used. All symbols and objects were scrutinized by Nintendo of America, who had specific rules on what could be included for North American releases; for instance, any Satanic, Christian, or any other religious, sexual, or drug-related references were not allowed.|$|E

40|$|The {{field of}} {{interiors}} is complex.

50|$|Rosalind Bengelsdorf {{was born}} April 30, 1916 in New York, NY. She {{studied at the}} Art Students League of New York as a {{teenager}} (1930-1934) with John Steuart Curry, Raphael Soyer, Anne Goldthwaite, and George Bridgman. In 1935 she joined the atelier of artist Hans Hofmann. She held a growing belief that the picture plane was a “living reality” of forms, energies, and colors. Because of this belief, Hofmann became a mentor to her for his dedication to painting as an independent object. Like Hofmann, she believed that “the shapes that compose the picture below to nothing else but the picture.” With his encouragement, she began to merge the idea that space is filled with “myriad, infinitesimal subdivisions” that changed into vibrating interplay of elements into her work. She felt that the abstract painter was observing the world and nature, tearing <b>it</b> apart, and <b>putting</b> <b>it</b> <b>back</b> <b>together</b> in a unique way. In 1936, she began working as a WPA Federal Art Project muralist with Burgoyne Diller for the Central Nurses Home on Welfare Island. The mural, entitled Abstraction (now destroyed), balances simple geometric forms through position and color.|$|R
