5|$|A {{large number}} of {{decompression}} experiments were done using goats, which were compressed for three hours to assumed saturation, rapidly decompressed to surface pressure, and examined for symptoms of decompression sickness. Goats which had been compressed to 2.25 bar absolute or less {{showed no signs of}} DCS after rapid decompression to the surface. Goats compressed to 6 bar and rapidly decompressed to 2.6 bar (<b>pressure</b> <b>ratio</b> 2.3 to 1) also showed no signs of DCS. Haldane and his co-workers concluded that a decompression from saturation with a <b>pressure</b> <b>ratio</b> of 2 to 1 was unlikely to produce symptoms.|$|E

Aerodynamic improvements including splitting the compressor into two separately rotating parts, incorporating variable blade angles for entry guide vanes and stators, and bleeding air from the compressor enabled later turbojets to have overall <b>pressure</b> <b>ratios</b> of 15:1 or more. For comparison, modern civil turbofan engines have overall <b>pressure</b> <b>ratios</b> of 44:1 or more. After leaving the compressor, the air enters the combustion chamber.|$|R

A special focus was set on low nozzle <b>pressure</b> <b>ratios</b> to identify the origin of a locally re-attached flow condition that was detected in previous test campaigns. A convex shaped Mach disc was found for nozzle <b>pressure</b> <b>ratios</b> less than 10 and a slight concave one for nozzle <b>pressure</b> <b>ratios</b> more than 20.

25|$|The speed {{lines of}} gas turbine {{centrifugal}} compressors typically exhibit choke. This {{is a situation}} where the <b>pressure</b> <b>ratio</b> of a speed line drops rapidly (vertically) with little or no change in flow. In most cases {{the reason for this is}} that close to Mach 1 velocities have been reached somewhere within the impeller and/or diffuser generating a rapid increase in losses. Higher <b>pressure</b> <b>ratio</b> turbocharger centrifugal compressors exhibit this same phenomenon. Real choke phenomena is a function of compressibility as measured by the local Mach number within an area restriction within the centrifugal pressure stage.|$|E

25|$|Not {{long after}} the -6 entered service, an {{increase}} in thrust and therefore core power was required. Unable to increase (HP) turbine rotor inlet temperature, General Electric chose the expensive path of reconfiguring the CF6 core to increase its basic size. They removed two stages {{from the rear of}} the HP compressor, leaving an empty air passage where the blades and vanes had once been. Two booster stages were added to the LP (low pressure) compressor, which increased the overall <b>pressure</b> <b>ratio</b> to 29.3. Although the 86.4 in (2.19 m) diameter fan was retained, the airflow was raised to 1,450lb/s (660kg/s), yielding a static thrust of 51,000lbf (227kN).

40|$|An {{apparatus}} for {{the investigation}} of flow separation in a supersonic nozzle has been designed and constructed. Nozzle wall pressure distributions and shadowgraphs showing the associated shock wave configuration have been obtained {{for a range of}} different stagnation pressures and constant exit <b>pressure.</b> The <b>pressure</b> <b>ratios</b> were such that the theoretical nozzle exit pressure, without separation, was always less than atmospheric pressure. With the nozzle contour and <b>pressure</b> <b>ratios</b> investigated it is found that separation of flow from the nozzle walls always occurs. The separation is accompanied by a weak oblique shock wave of such strength that the flow deflection through it is approximately constant, independent of the location of the point of separation within the nozzle. The pressure adjustment from nozzle to exit does not occur through a normal shock wave. At <b>pressure</b> <b>ratios</b> below a certain value a definite asymmetry of flow appears in which the detached jet deflects away from the nozzle symmetry axis.

25|$|The {{increase}} in pressure produced by a single stage {{is limited by the}} relative velocity between the rotor and the fluid, and the turning and diffusion capabilities of the airfoils. A typical stage in a commercial compressor will produce a pressure increase of between 15% and 60% (pressure ratios of 1.15–1.6) at design conditions with a polytropic efficiency in the region of 90–95%. To achieve different pressure ratios, axial compressors are designed with different numbers of stages and rotational speeds. As a rule of thumb we can assume that each stage in a given compressor has the same temperature rise (Delta T). Therefore, at the entry, temperature (Tstage) to each stage must increase progressively through the compressor and the ratio (Delta T)/(Tstage) entry must decrease, thus implying a progressive reduction in stage <b>pressure</b> <b>ratio</b> through the unit. Hence the rear stage develops a significantly lower <b>pressure</b> <b>ratio</b> than the first stage.|$|E
25|$|Strong tones {{can occur}} in both {{rectangular}} and circular jets when the <b>pressure</b> <b>ratio</b> {{is greater than the}} critical and the flow becomes supersonic on exit, resulting in a sequence of repetitive shock cells.
