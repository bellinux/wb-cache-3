25|$|Among {{other things}} he {{repaired}} the aqueducts, cleansed the sewers, and prevented private persons drawing off public water {{for their own}} use. The Aqua Appia was the first aqueduct of Rome. It was constructed in 312 BC by Appius Claudius Caecus, the same Roman censor who also built the important Via Appia. Unauthorised plumbing into Rome's aqueducts {{had always been a}} problem, as Frontinus records much later. Cato also ordered the demolition of houses which encroached on the <b>public</b> <b>way,</b> and built the first basilica in the Forum near the Curia (Livy, History, 39.44; Plutarch, Marcus Cato, 19). He raised the amount paid by the publicani for the right to collect taxes and, at the same time, reduced the contract prices for the construction of public works.|$|E

25|$|Despite the name, {{necessity}} {{alone is}} an insufficient claim to create any easement. Parcels {{without access to}} a <b>public</b> <b>way</b> may have an easement of access over adjacent land if crossing that land is absolutely necessary to reach the landlocked parcel {{and there has been}} some original intent to provide the lot with access, and the grant was never completed or recorded but is thought to exist. A court order is necessary to determine the existence of an easement by necessity. To obtain this generally the party who claims the easement files a lawsuit, and the judge weighs the relative damage caused by enforcing an easement against the servient estate against the damage to the dominant estate if the easement is found not to exist and is thus landlocked.|$|E
500|$|In December 2015, The Hollywood Reporter {{reported}} that Russian distribution company Arthouse had acquired distribution rights {{to release the}} film in Russia in March 2016. The CEO of Arthouse {{said that it was}} [...] "a huge challenge because of the federal 'gay propaganda' law that victimizes the Russian LGBT community", and [...] "will prevent Carol to be sold to major TV channels or even being advertised on federal networks". He noted that [...] "some cinemas will refuse to book the film", but [...] "the controversy around the LGBT issues will help us market Carol to the right audience", adding that it is a film about [...] "a relationship, it's a story of forbidden love" [...] and he believed it would [...] "appeal to the <b>public</b> <b>way</b> beyond the LGBT community." [...] The film was released in Russia on March 10, 2016.|$|E

2500|$|Business New Zealand chief {{executive}} Phil O'Reilly stated [...] "I think the Progressive dispute {{is a very}} <b>public</b> <b>way</b> station of a trend towards more of this.

2500|$|In some US states (such as Louisiana, Massachusetts and New York), {{although}} there are laws requiring all traffic on a <b>public</b> <b>way</b> to use the right-most lane unless overtaking, this rule is often ignored and seldom enforced on multi-lane roadways. [...] Some states, such as Colorado, {{use a combination of}} laws and signs restricting speeds or vehicles on certain lanes to emphasize overtaking only on the left lane, and to avoid a psychological condition commonly called road rage.|$|E
2500|$|Anti-religious museums {{began to}} be closed in the late 1930s and chairs of [...] "scientific atheism" [...] were {{abolished}} in universities. The average figures for those who attended atheist lectures was dropping to less than 50 per lecture by 1940. The circulation of anti-religious journals was dropping as was membership in the League of the Militant Godless. There are different reasons that may have caused this, including some moral alienation {{of people from the}} brutality of the campaign as well as the fact that the centralized terror did not have much tolerance for autonomous organizations, and even those who worked for anti-religious purposes could find themselves criticized in the campaign or subject to purge for deviating from the established line. Stalin's mind may have changed as well; he may have lost patience with the campaign, alternatively he may have thought that it had reached its goals once organized religion had ceased to exist in any <b>public</b> <b>way</b> throughout the country or he may have thought that the looming war clouds needed a more unified country.|$|E

50|$|Non-motorized access on freeways allows pedestrians, bicyclists {{and other}} non-motorized traffic {{to use a}} freeway. Such roads are <b>public</b> <b>ways</b> {{intended}} primarily for high-speed travel over long distances, and they have resulted in highways in the United States with engineering features such as long sight-distances, wide marked lanes {{and the absence of}} cross traffic.
