50|$|As part {{of their}} plan, Freudenberg took {{a job in a}} public utility also {{supplying}} natural gas, and the two took an apartment in the East Berlin neighborhood of Prenzlauer Berg. In January and February 1989, they began assembling a 13 metre tall by 11 metre diameter balloon envelope out of polythene, which they cut into strips, taped together, and engirded with a string net. There was no basket, only a narrow wooden beam. On the evening of 7 March they decided that the wind conditions were favourable for their escape. They drove to a <b>pressure</b> <b>regulating</b> <b>station</b> in Blankenburg neighborhood to which Freudenberg had the keys and at midnight began to fill their balloon with gas. From some time after 1:00 am the balloon was visible from a distance. A waiter {{on his way home from}} work which had ended at 1:30 am noticed the balloon, and called the Volkspolizei. When the couple heard a patrol car arriving shortly after 2:00 am the balloon was not yet completely filled. Because they feared it would not lift both of them they quickly decided for Freudenberg to escape alone, his wife always having been doubtful. He occupied the beam and cut the tethers. With only one person aboard the balloon had a very high buoyancy and rose fast. Ballast bags hanging down on lines severed a power line shortly after launching and caused it to short-cut and spark. Although East German security had often shot and killed citizens attempting to escape, they decided against shooting because of the possibility of triggering an explosion of the natural gas now leaking. Also, they believed Freudenberg to have been killed by the current which was not the case. Freudenberg's 23 year old wife was able to get back home, where the Stasi were already waiting for her.|$|E

The pressure level is controlled by <b>pressure</b> <b>regulating</b> <b>stations.</b> In some specific configurations, the downstream pressure is not properly controlled by the pressure regulator and oscillates around the set point.

Amplitudes and frequencies of the outlet pressure were especially sensitive to inlet pressure and {{to the size of}} the downstream volume. Amplitudes and frequencies of oscillations were reduced for highest downstream volume, the frequency simulated was generally higher than the frequency measured on test bench.

40|$|Hydraulic {{simulation}} of water distribution systems using computer software {{appears to have}} reached a very mature level of practice. There {{does not appear to}} be many other improvements that can be made to the basic underlying solution algorithms. While this statement is mostly true, there still remains one area that results in problems when developing simulation models. In discussions with water distribution modeling practitioners, the most commonly mentioned remaining problem is stability of computers programs in the presence of <b>pressure</b> <b>regulating</b> devices. The three most common <b>pressure</b> <b>regulating</b> devices are <b>pressure</b> reducing valves, flow control valves and pressure sustaining valves. The difficulty in computer codes is that the status of the device is not known a priori. Consider a pressure reducing valve (PRV) â€” it may have one of three states. For the first state, the valve operates normally - such that the valve is in a partially closed or throttling position to maintain the set pressure on the downstream side of the valve. The second state occurs when the pressure downstream of the valve cannot be maintained and drops below the set pressure. In this case the valve moves to a fully open position. For the third state, the PRV acts as check valve. If there is more than one <b>pressure</b> <b>regulating</b> valve in a water distribution system then each device may be in one of three states. In computer codes, a guess is made to the status of each of the <b>pressure</b> <b>regulating</b> devices and the system is solved for to determine the flows and pressures. A check is then made to determine if the guesses of status are consistent with the results. If the assumed status of the device is inconsistent with the results the status is altered and the hydraulic solver is re-run. This paper demonstrates with a simple example that has a combination of a pressure reducing valve and a flow control valve that many commonly available commercial programs and Government programs cannot properly model even the simplest of systems.

40|$|In {{pressure}} irrigation-water distribution networks, <b>pressure</b> <b>regulating</b> {{devices for}} controlling the discharged flow rate by irrigation units are needed {{due to the}} variability of flow rate. In addition, applied water volume is used controlled operating the valve during a calculated time interval, and assuming constant flow rate. In general, a <b>pressure</b> <b>regulating</b> valve PRV is the commonly used <b>pressure</b> <b>regulating</b> device in a hydrant, which, also, executes the open and close function. A hydrant feeds several irrigation units, requiring a wide range in flow rate. In addition, some flow meters are also available, one {{as a component of}} the hydrant and the rest are placed downstream. Every land owner has one flow meter for each group of field plots downstream the hydrant. Its lecture could be used for refining the water balance but its accuracy must be taken into account. Ideal PRV performance would maintain a constant downstream pressure. However, the true performance depends on both upstream pressure and the discharged flow rate. The objective of this work is to asses the influence of the performance on the applied volume during the whole irrigation events in a year. The results of the study have been obtained introducing the flow rate into a PRV model. Variations on flow rate are simulated by taking into account the consequences of variations on climate conditions and also decisions in irrigation operation, such us duration and frequency application.

40|$|Computer {{hydraulic}} solvers such as EPANET allow complex {{water distribution}} system networks to be simulated by design engineers. Modeling of systems containing combinations of pressure reducing valves (PRVs), pressure sustaining valves (PSVs) and flow control valves (FCVs) {{can sometimes be}} problematical. The status of PRVs, PSVs and FCVs is usually solved for based on a heuristic approach. Starting from an assumed state of the control device, a check is performed during the next step of the iteration procedure, {{as to whether the}} original assumption of each particular assumed valve status still holds. If the assumption proves to be no longer true, a correction {{of the state of the}} control device is made. It has been observed in the past that this approach may sometimes fail to converge at all, or even worse may converge to incorrect solutions when simulating networks that include <b>pressure</b> <b>regulating</b> devices. In the majority of cases for which no correct solution was obtained, the solver converged quickly to an incorrect solution. Hence, no warning message was generated to indicate there was a problem with the solution. Some simple networks incorporating PRVs and FCVs have been considered in this research. The networks have multiple <b>pressure</b> <b>regulating</b> and flow regulating devices that are placed in series and separated by substantial lengths of pipe. Even for simple networks comprising two <b>pressure</b> <b>regulating</b> devices (one <b>pressure</b> <b>regulating</b> device and one flow regulating device) in series, current hydraulic modeling software fails to converge to the correct solution for particular configurations and settings. This paper aims to consider the circumstances in which such difficulties occur and the reasons for the failure to solve. In 2002, Deuerlein in his PhD thesis proposed a new method to ensure that the correct solution for water distribution systems containing multiple <b>pressure</b> and flow <b>regulating</b> valves is obtained. He used Nash equilibrium. The application of this approach enables all simple networks (as described above) to be correctly solved that previously could not be solved or those that converged to the wrong solution in EPANET. Details of the Nash equilibrium algorithm and the specific application to some example networks that converged to the wrong solution in EPANET are presented in this paper. Arbitrary pressure and flow controlling devices in water distribution systems can now be simulated with confidence. Convergence is assured if the system's physics are feasible. The approach has been implemented as part of the water supply network simulation and optimization model KANET. Jochen Deuerlein, Angus R. Simpson and Stefanie Wilkins[URL]...|$|R
