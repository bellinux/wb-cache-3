40|$|Corrosion of {{reinforcing}} and <b>prestressing</b> steel due to chloride contamination {{is one of}} {{the primary}} causes of deterioration of concrete structures. A review of published literatures shows that the research on the deterioration of mechanical properties of reinforcing steel is more than that on <b>prestressing</b> strands, even though the corrosion of <b>prestressing</b> strands may trigger structural collapse without warnings due to higher stress levels in the steel. This paper aims to investigate the degradation of mechanical behaviour of corroded <b>prestressing</b> strands. Details of a comprehensive experiment designed to examine the mechanical behaviour of corroded <b>prestressing</b> strands in concrete structural members are presented. A micromechanical damage model for failure mechanism of corroded <b>prestressing</b> strands is proposed, and a model for damage factor is derived. Based on these models, a constitutive model for corroded <b>prestressing</b> strands is developed and verified with test results. It is found in the paper that both the strength and ductility of corroded <b>prestressing</b> strands decrease with the increase of corrosion and that the hemispherical model for the pit shape is more appropriate for the prediction of strength reduction of corroded <b>prestressing</b> strands. The paper concludes that the constitutive model developed in the paper can be used to predict the mechanical behaviour of corroded <b>prestressing</b> strands accurately, paving the way for the assessment of corrosion-induced flexural failure of prestressed concrete structures...|$|R

40|$|Screwed {{acetabular}} cups, {{applied in}} total hip replacements, generate stresses {{in the surrounding}} bone during implantation (<b>prestresses).</b> The effect of these <b>prestresses</b> on the endurance of the hip replacement are unknown. The <b>prestresses</b> in the acetabulum were examined both experimentally, using strain gauge techniques, and numerically, using the finite element method. It {{was found that the}} <b>prestresses</b> were of the same order of magnitude, if not larger, than the stresses due to the hip reaction force during one-legged stance. In some cases, the <b>prestresses</b> even approximated the ultimate tensile strength of cortical bone. The <b>prestresses</b> seemed to have a strong dependence on the outer shape of the cup, rather than on the flexibility of the cup or whether the cup had a self-cutting thread or not. Furthermore, {{it was found that the}} <b>prestresses</b> are not very susceptible to stress relaxation due to the visco-elastic behaviour of bone. This means that <b>prestresses</b> will remain present over long periods of time. So even when a patient has resumed normal daily activities, the <b>prestresses</b> will still play an important role in the overall stress distributions around the acetabulum. Due to the interaction of <b>prestresses</b> and stresses due to normal loading, the primary stability of a metal-backed screwed cup is better guaranteed than the primary stability of an all-polyethylene screwed cup...|$|R
40|$|The <b>prestressing</b> tendons in {{prestressed}} concrete containments lose their <b>prestressing</b> forces with time due to creep and shrinkage of concrete, and relaxation of the <b>prestressing</b> steel. During the design phase, engineers estimate these losses {{to arrive at}} the end of operating life (Refs. 1 and 2), normally forty years. The operating experiences with the trend of <b>prestressing</b> forces indicate that the <b>prestressing</b> tendons lose their <b>prestressing</b> forces at a rate higher than predicted due to sustained high temperature (Ref. 3). Thus, it is necessary to perform TLAAs for the extended period of operation.

In this paper the moment due to <b>prestressing</b> force is assumed to be a direct function of the <b>prestressing</b> force multiplied by a coefficient thus the <b>prestressing</b> force is obtained from the stress conditions of the bottom and top fibres under external loading.

50|$|The {{majority}} of fabric structures derive their strength from their doubly curved shape. By forcing the fabric {{to take on}} double-curvature the fabric gains sufficient stiffness to withstand the loads it is subjected to (for example wind and snow loads).

40|$|<b>Prestressing</b> cables {{are widely}} used in huge constructions like {{buildings}} and bridges. Corrosion of <b>prestressing</b> steel is more dangerous than the corrosion of reinforcing steel in concrete. Stress corrosion is propagated due to corrosion initiation in <b>prestressing</b> steel under stressed condition. Corrosion resistance of the <b>prestressing</b> steel depends upon the grout material. In this investigation three types of grout materials namely cement grout with non-shrinking admixture, polyurethane foam and epoxy grout were assessed for its suitability within the <b>prestressing</b> cable duct. The performance of grout materials to protect against <b>prestressing</b> steel corrosion was evaluated by different electrochemical techniques such as OCP measurements, anodic polarisation test and impressed voltage technique. The mechanical property of the different grout materials were test at room and elevated temperature. Among the three grouts, epoxy based grout system showed better corrosion resistance properties...|$|R
40|$|Incrementally {{launched}} bridges, {{which are}} generally built with the static scheme of a continuous beam on supports, change their scheme {{several times during}} launching. In these different configurations, internal forces vary and bending moments of opposite signs occur in the same sections for different positions of deck during advancement. In these bridges, two different kinds of <b>prestressing</b> are necessary: a temporary one during launching and a definitive one in service life. In this study, the possibility of implementing automatic adjustable <b>prestressing</b> for the launching stages is investigated; the launch <b>prestressing</b> is partially supplied by a system which can change the tension value in the <b>prestressing</b> tendons according to {{the change in the}} loads acting on the structure. This adjustable <b>prestressing</b> can be either semi-automatic or totally automatic (auto-adjustable), following the concept of "organic <b>prestressing.</b> " The conditions of activation and deactivation of automatic <b>prestressing</b> through a control system of stresses and deformations are given, giving indications to designers on the additional tendons to be applied in the advanced part of the deck and on the control sections which system implementation needs. A numerical example is given to clarify the concept of adjustable <b>prestressing,</b> details being provided in the case study examined on the evaluation of stresses, on the choice of control sections and on the <b>prestressing</b> tendons, through the aid of diagrams of activation and deactivation of the adjustable <b>prestressing.</b> The results of the study highlight the fact that adjustable <b>prestressing</b> is useful for the advanced part of the deck, in the launching stages of bridges with several spans with similar lengths, especially for the bottom fibres, when sections are placed in the midspan, or for upper fibres when they pass over piers, in the case of limited nose lengths...|$|R

Conversely, for higher <b>prestressing</b> force, concrete softening starts playing a relevant role with very small increments of the 1 st frequency of vibration.|$|R

40|$|Vacuumatics {{consist of}} {{independent}} particles inside an airtight enclosed membrane, that are prestressed {{due to a}} difference in (air) pressure. Analytical and numerical research of vacuum <b>prestressing</b> has illustrated that the effective <b>prestressing</b> forces {{can be divided into}} two interrelated <b>prestressing</b> components. Due to the granular characteristics of Vacuumatics, the material behaviour can be modelled by means of the Discrete Element Method (DEM). The individual <b>prestressing</b> components acting on the edge particles of vacuumatic structures can be simulated by means of a specialised Atmospheric Pressure Model in HADES (by Habanera). Analytically defined equations form the basic input in this simulation process. These simulations enable us to analyse (visually as well as numerically) the <b>prestressing</b> forces, but also the contact forces and the displacements of each particle due to this vacuum <b>prestressing.</b> Furthermore, bending phenomena of beam-shaped Vacuumatics can be analysed in detail, providing us with insight to describe and predict the structural properties of any type of vacuumatic structure...|$|R

Based on the model experiment, the results and conclusions of shear lag in curved box girder with <b>prestressing</b> force are presented that <b>prestressing</b> force has changed shear lag distribution. The <b>prestressing</b> force action on box girder shall be considered comprehensively, structural force shall be analyzed accurately, optimize <b>prestressing</b> tendons shall be set rationally which would make force more rationally.

50|$|The {{behaviour}} {{of structures}} which depend upon <b>prestress</b> to attain their strength is non-linear, so {{anything other than}} a very simple cable has, until the 1990s, been very difficult to design. The most common way to design doubly curved fabric structures was to construct scale models of the final buildings in order to understand their behaviour and to conduct form-finding exercises. Such scale models often employed stocking material or tights, or soap film, as they behave in a very similar way to structural fabrics (they cannot carry shear).|$|E
50|$|Mathematically {{the surface}} {{embedded}} into a non-plane closed curve is called minimum if its area is minimal amongst all the surfaces passing through this curve. The best-known minimum surface sample is a soap film bounded by wire frame. Usually {{to create a}} minimum surface, a fictitious constitutive law, which maintains a constant <b>prestress,</b> independent of any changes in strain, is used. The alternative approximated approach to the minimum surface problem solution is based on SGM. This formulation allows one to minimize the surface embedded into non-plane and plane closed contours.|$|E
5000|$|Freyssinet's {{proposal}} was for three reinforced concrete truss spans, and was significantly {{less expensive than}} the standard masonry arch design. The design used jacks to raise and connect the arches, effectively introducing an element of <b>prestress.</b> The bridge also enabled Freyssinet to discover the phenomenon of creep in concrete, whereby the concrete deforms with time when placed under stress. Regarding this bridge, Freyssinet wrote: [...] "I have always loved it {{more than any other}} of my bridges, and of all that the War has destroyed, it is the only one whose ruin has caused me real grief".|$|E
40|$|At {{some point}} in the design of every {{post-tensioned}} con-crete member, the licensed design professional (LDP) must determine the <b>prestressing</b> forces required in the member to satisfy code requirements. This <b>prestressing</b> force is calculat-ed after all initial and long-term losses have been accounted for and is commonly referred to as the Final Effective Force (FEF). The FEF and the tendon profile are the two most impor-tant design parameters in post-tensioned members. The FEF and the tendon profile determine the flexural stresses under service loads. Using appropriate code equations and unbonded tendons, the <b>prestressing</b> force at nominal strength is a func-tion of the FEF. There are several ways to assure that the FEF in the structure is achieved, depending on the size and strength of the <b>prestressing</b> steel installed.

5000|$|Circular storage {{structures}} such as silos and tanks can use prestressing forces to directly resist the outward pressures generated by stored liquids or bulk-solids.Horizontally curved tendons are installed within the concrete wall to form a series of [...] "hoops" [...] spaced vertically up the structure. When tensioned, these tendons exert both axial (compressive) and radial (inward) forces onto the structure, {{which can be used}} to directly oppose the subsequent storage loadings. If the magnitude of the <b>prestress</b> is designed to always exceed the tensile stresses produced by the loadings, a permanent residual compression will exist in the wall concrete, assisting in maintaining a watertight, crack-free structure under all storage conditions.|$|E
50|$|Muscles possess {{nonlinear}} visco-elastic properties {{when they}} contract. This property can autocorrect movements when a muscle {{is forced to}} change its length, and at a velocity different from that with which it was originally commanded. Such automatic correction is useful when a commanded action is perturbated, for example, if a step goes into a hole as this causes the foot to unexpectedly stretch down. The nonlinear visco-elastic properties of muscles interact with these perturbation induced velocity and length differences such that they counteract directly, as they happen, the effects upon {{the body of the}} perturbation.Part of the resistance to perturbation is passive, by means of the nonlinear increase in passive tension and joint torques produced by muscular and other soft tissues. Tissue <b>prestress</b> is a preflexive property that constitutes a basal level of passive tension which, due to its presence in antagonistic tissues of a joint, increases joint passive stiffness and stability.|$|E
