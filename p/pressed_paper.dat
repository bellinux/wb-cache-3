The size of the doll can vary between ½ inch and 2.0 inches. In western culture, the dolls are mostly made of <b>pressed</b> <b>paper,</b> adhesive tape, paper and colorful wool.

50|$|In 1835, {{five years}} before the {{introduction}} of the worldwide first stamps in Great Britain, he suggested the introduction of adhesive tax postmarks (aufklebbare Brieftaxstempel) to the Department of Commerce in Vienna, which was responsible for the postal system. These postmarks were to be used for the pre-payment of postage. He called them gepresste Papieroblate (<b>pressed</b> <b>paper</b> wafers), which are known today as stamps. His suggestion was looked at in detail, but rejected for the time being.|$|E
50|$|Colbert {{transformed}} {{the interior of}} the Arsenale using atmospheric elements including stone, curtains made from one-million <b>pressed</b> <b>paper</b> tea bags from Sri Lanka, and minimalist lighting techniques. Founded in 1104, the Arsenale was originally used to build and launch long ships to sea via the Venetian canals. The interior architecture of the structure provided an ideal setting for Ashes and Snow: the monumental space gracefully accommodated Colbert’s large-format photographic artworks and films. The show was a critical and popular success, and {{remains one of the most}} attended exhibitions by any single artist in Europe.|$|E

50|$|The Case {{family were}} {{prominent}} industrialists in Manchester where they operated a paper mill and water bottling facility. In 1861 Alfred Wells Case and his twin brother Albert Willard Case opened the Case Brothers Inc. paper mill in Highland Park where they produced washed cotton supplied to the Union Army during the Civil War. At {{the end of}} the war, the Case brothers began a specialized papermaking operation and soon became a leader in the manufacturing of pressboard, a strong paper product used as album board, shoe board, and binder board. They were true Connecticut Yankees that ran an efficient, innovative, highly skilled operation, and the company continued to flourish as the New England paper industry reached its peak. In 1878 the company won first prize for its <b>pressed</b> <b>paper</b> at the International Paris Exposition, competing with many European paper manufacturers, and achieved further success at the Melbourne Exhibition of 1880. Case Brothers Inc. remained a family business and continued success into the 1960s when it was acquired by Boise Cascade Corporation. The Case family owned a large amount of land in the southeastern section Manchester that is now the Case Mountain Recreational Area. They built a stone bridge across the west end of Case Pond, many stone walls, a chestnut log cabin, and a carriage path that loops from Spring Street to the top of Lookout Mountain and down to Case Pond.|$|E
40|$|In this paper, {{we report}} an {{analysis}} of <b>pressed</b> <b>paper</b> in terms of porosity and permeability. Previously, we reported a <b>pressed</b> <b>paper</b> that exhibits decreased porosity and permeability. Additionally, its applications into programmed sample delivery as well as flow rate control were reported. However, {{there is a need}} for a theoretical analysis of <b>pressed</b> <b>paper</b> in terms of porosity and permeability for a more precise design principle and its applications because porosity and permeability are important factors in determining fluidic behavior. Here, we propose a theoretical model for analyzing decreased porosity and permeability in <b>pressed</b> <b>paper.</b> Porosity and permeability of <b>pressed</b> <b>paper</b> were quantitatively calculated using experimental results with a theoretical model. Furthermore, based on the analyzed results of porosity and permeability in <b>pressed</b> <b>paper,</b> a porosity–permeability relationship was investigated...|$|E
40|$|Following an {{invitation}} by the Design Museum in Lisbon, mude, this personal show features works in water-jet cut <b>pressed</b> <b>paper</b> and natural rubber. Reflections on complex systems, systems {{of behavior and}} processes of doing, {{led to the development}} of ornaments to wear. Unfortunately a misunderstanding lead the use of a wrong title for this show. The short but well attended exhibition was originally planned to be entitled 'patterns of doing, patterns of wearing', but this got mixed up with the title of the lecture (Foreign Bodies / Jewellery as Prosthesis) and the title for the workshop (Mapping complexity / Patterns of doing - Patterns of wearing) which was in line with the exhibition title. The Exhibition, the public talk and the workshop took place during one week. The workshop was open to professionals and students at ArCo, Centro de Arte & Comunicacao Visual. The event was financially supported by the Swiss Embassy in Portugal...|$|E
