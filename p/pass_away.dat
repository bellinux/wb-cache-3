It was said that the 8000 {{elephants}} in the forest took turns to catering for his needs. Koṇḍañña only left once, to farewell Gautama Buddha. Koṇḍañña kissed the Buddha's feet and stroked them with his hands. He advised his disciples not to mourn him before returning to the forest to <b>pass</b> <b>away</b> the following morning. He was cremated on a large sandalwood pyre which was constructed {{with the help of the}} elephants, and the ceremony was presided over by Anuruddha, one of the ten chief disciples and five hundred other monks. The ashes were later taken to Veluvana, where they were enshrined in a silver stupa.|$|E

The {{components}} {{that make up the}} mind are known as the five aggregates (i.e., material form, feelings, perception, volition, and sensory consciousness), which arise and <b>pass</b> <b>away</b> continuously. The arising and passing of these aggregates in the present moment is described as being influenced by five causal laws: biological laws, psychological laws, physical laws, volitional laws, and universal laws. The Buddhist practice of mindfulness involves attending to this constantly changing mind-stream.|$|E

Parākramabāhu found himself facing dissension within his own ranks and the defeat of his forces in Malaya; Manabharana even recaptured Polonnaruwa and with it most of Rajarata. Despite this Parākramabāhu persevered with the offensive, withdrawing from his southern campaign and concentrating his forces in the north. Manabharana once again found himself besieged in Polonnaruwa. Both sides were exhausted by the incessant warfare of the preceding years, and Manabharana eventually fled the city for Ruhuna. His forces were overtaken at the Mahaweli River by Parākramabāhu's army and annihilated; the king returned to the south in time to <b>pass</b> <b>away</b> {{from a combination of}} disease and exhaustion.|$|E

Unless an administrator (someone like an auditing firm partner, usually appointed by creditors on a company's insolvency) is able to rescue the business, shareholders will lose their money, employees will lose their jobs and a liquidator will be appointed to sell off any remaining assets to distribute as much as possible to unpaid creditors.

25|$|The {{first issue}} of Superman, {{published}} in 1939, also featured the origin story. Max Gaines had written to Siegel and Shuster {{and asked them to}} expand the origin sequence to two pages, and to include four pages that detailed how Clark Kent became a journalist as well as a full page feature that expanded on the scientific explanation for Superman's powers. In this issue, the passing motorists are revealed to be the Kents, who leave him at the local orphan asylum but later return to adopt him. The Kents teach Clark that he must keep his powers a secret but that he will someday use them to assist humanity. Clark becomes Superman after the Kents <b>pass</b> <b>away</b> and wins his job as a reporter for the Daily Star by delivering information he had gathered as Superman about a lynch mob at the county jail. The feature on Superman's powers asserts again that Kryptonians had evolved to physical perfection, but also reveals that because Earth is a smaller planet than Krypton, the lighter gravitational pull further enhanced Superman's strength.|$|E
500|$|As {{with another}} Prabhupada-inspired track {{that he wrote}} during this period, [...] "Living in the Material World", Harrison expresses his belief that the pursuit of fame and riches – {{particularly}} {{in the music industry}} – is meaningless.

[...] While author Joshua Greene compares Harrison's songs from this period to Vedic sutras, Allison specifies this verse-two message to a passage from the Katha Upanishad, which reads: [...] "Intoxicated, deluded by the glamour of riches, the childish do not see that they must <b>pass</b> <b>away.</b> They think, 'This is the world and there is no other.'" ...|$|E
