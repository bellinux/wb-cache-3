Our work aimed to determine the term of the development stages and the species cycle in the four seasons of the year (complete development, beginning of bloom, complete bloom, and seed set), verifying the <b>plant's</b> <b>therapeutic</b> profile during the four distinct development phases in order to detect differences in its potency. Pharmacological tests were performed to observe the anti-inflammatory activity. Results Phenological observations were accessed for a 12 month-period, from the Brazilian summer of 1999 / 2000 to fall 2000. On average the plantules' emergence occurred 15 days after seeding. All plantules grew in a similar manner up to 25 days after transplantation in all seasons. Starting on the 25 th day, we observed faster growth during spring, with plants reaching a height of about 60 cm after 100 days of transplantation, unlike other seasons, in which plants reached heights of 40, 40, and 35 cm during winter, summer, and fall, respectively. The P. pellucida aqueous extract showed significant anti-inflammatory activity during phenophases 1 and 2 of winter and spring. Depending on the plant's phenophase there was variation in the potency of edema inhibition. Conclusion P. pellucida has a phenological cycle of approximately 100 days.

40|$|Shiga toxin 1 (Stx 1) is a {{virulence}} {{factor of}} enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli, {{such as the}} O 157 :H 7 strain. In the intestines, secretory IgA (SIgA) is {{a major component of}} the immune defense against pathogens and toxins. To form SIgA, the production of dimeric IgA that retains biological activity is an important step. We previously established hybrid-IgG/IgA having variable regions of the IgG specific for the binding subunit of Stx 1 (Stx 1 B) and the heavy chain constant region of IgA. If hybrid-IgG/IgA cDNAs can be expressed in <b>plants,</b> <b>therapeutic</b> or preventive effects may be expected in people eating those plants containing a "plantibody". Here, we established transgenic Arabidopsis thaliana expressing dimeric hybrid-IgG/IgA. The heavy and light chain genes were placed under the control of a bidirectional promoter and terminator of the chlorophyll a/b-binding protein of Arabidopsis thaliana (expression cassette). This expression cassette and the J chain gene were subcloned into a single binary vector, which was then introduced into A. thaliana by means of the Agrobacterium method. Expression and assembly of the dimeric hybrid-IgG/IgA in plants were revealed by ELISA and immunoblotting. The hybrid-IgG/IgA bound to Stx 1 B and inhibited Stx 1 B binding to Gb 3, as demonstrated by ELISA. When Stx 1 holotoxin was pre-treated with the resulting plantibody, the cytotoxicity of Stx 1 was inhibited. The toxin neutralization was also demonstrated by means of several assays including Stx 1 -induced phosphatidylserine translocation on the plasma membrane, caspase- 3 activation and 180 base-pair DNA ladder formation due to inter-nucleosomal cleavage. These results indicate that edible plants containing hybrid-IgG/IgA against Stx 1 B have the potential to be used for immunotherapy against Stx 1 -caused food poisoning...|$|R
