5000|$|According {{to a major}} study, Wilderness: Earth's Last Wild Places, {{carried out}} by Conservation International, 46% of the world's land mass is wilderness. For <b>purposes</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>report,</b> [...] "wilderness" [...] was defined as an area that [...] "has 70% or more of its {{original}} vegetation intact, covers at least 10,000 km2 and must have fewer than five people per square kilometer." [...] However, an IUCN/UNEP report published in 2003, found that only 10.9% of the world's land mass is currently a Category 1 Protected Area, that is, either a strict nature reserve (5.5%) or protected wilderness (5.4%). Such areas remain relatively untouched by humans. Of course, there are large tracts of lands in National Parks and other protected areas that would also qualify as wilderness. However, many protected areas have some degree of human modification or activity, so a definitive estimate of true wilderness is difficult.|$|E
