40|$|Plastics {{are widely}} used to store and package food and beverages. They are convenient, lightweight, {{unbreakable}} and relatively inexpensive. However, there are both environmental and health risks from {{the widespread use of}} plastics. Environmental problems: Most plastics are made from petroleum, a non-renewable resource. Plastic packaging also creates unnecessary waste. Plastic is bulky—taking up a large volume of landfill space. Health risks: The use of plastics in cooking and food storage can carry health risks, especially when hormonedisrupting chemicals from some <b>plastics</b> <b>leach</b> into foods and beverages. Plastic manufacturing and incineration creates air and water pollution, and exposes workers to toxic chemicals. Choose less polluting products to reduce your exposure to chemicals...|$|R
30|$|Due {{to their}} large surface-to-volume ratio and {{chemical}} composition, MP accumulate waterborne contaminants including metals [[53]] and persistent, bioaccumulative, and toxic compounds (PBTs) [[54]]. A review {{on the relationship}} between plastic debris and PBTs (e.g., PCBs and DDT) has been published recently [[55]], and a number of studies exist for polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) [[56]-[61]]. However, {{there is a lack of}} information on other important contaminants like pharmaceuticals and endocrine-disrupting compounds (EDCs). Nonylphenol and bisphenol A have been detected in MP [[60],[62],[63]]. Fries et al. [[24]] detected various plastic additives in MP, including some well-known EDCs (e.g., phthalates).

40|$|A {{method for}} {{detecting}} trace levels of dissolved organic compounds and <b>leached</b> <b>plastic</b> compounds {{in drinking water}} includes the steps of employing deep ultraviolet light-emitting diode induced fluorescence at sensitivity levels of several parts per trillion in real time so that a more compact and inexpensive excitation source, relative to a deep UV laser-induced fluorescence, for fluorescence detection of dissolved organic compounds in water is provided.

40|$|Xenoestrogens are compounds, foreign {{from the}} body, that can enter cells and {{interact}} with the estrogen receptors (ER) to produce an estrogenic response. Many additives used in plastics are compounds with estrogenic activity. Some of these additives are known to slowly <b>leach</b> from the <b>plastics.</b> When using plastic containers as lunchboxes for reheating or food storage, these additives can <b>leach</b> from the <b>plastics</b> and {{end up in the}} food. In this project, food simulates were cooked in six different thermoplastic containers, made of polypropylene, in an oven at 100 °C for 15 minutes. Three of the thermoplastic containers were lunchboxes marketed to be able to withstand cooking in a microwave. The other three were provisional lunchboxes made from various food storing containers originally made for refrigeration purposes. The estrogenic activity in the different samples was measured using an ER-CALUX in vitro assay. The results were measured in 17 β-estradiol equivalent (Bio-EEQ) values in pg/ml. The purpose of this project was to investigate whether or not these <b>plastic</b> containers <b>leach</b> xenoestrogens that can be measured with an ER-CALUX assay, and compare the results with the results from other existing toxicological studies, and also {{to see if there is}} a difference in Bio-EEQ levels between the plastic containers made for microwave usage and those made for refrigerated purposes.

40|$|Plastic {{pollution}} {{represents a}} major and growing global problem. It is well-known that plastics {{are a source}} of chemical contaminants to the aquatic environment and provide novel habitats for marine organisms. The present study quantified the impacts of plastic leachates from the seven categories of recyclable plastics on larval survival and settlement of barnacle Amphibalanus (=Balanus) amphitrite. Leachates from plastics significantly increased barnacle nauplii mortality at the highest tested concentrations (0. 10 and 0. 50 m(2) /L). Hydrophobicity (measured as surface energy) was positively correlated with mortality indicating that plastic surface chemistry may be an important factor in the effects of plastics on sessile organisms. Plastic leachates significantly inhibited barnacle cyprids settlement on glass at all tested concentrations. Settlement on plastic surfaces was significantly inhibited after 24 and 48 h, but settlement was not significantly inhibited compared to the controls for some plastics after 72 - 96 h. In 24 h exposure to seawater, we found larval toxicity and inhibition of settlement with all seven categories of recyclable commercial plastics.

30|$|Nonylphenol is a viscous, {{pale yellow}} color product of {{industrial}} synthesis formed during the alkylation process of phenols. Nonylphenol {{is not a}} single chemical compound; instead, the term refers to compounds of those that have a central aromatic (or benzene) ring and a nine carbon side chain. The most commonly occurring compound of nonylphenol is 4 -nonylphenol, in which the side chains are attached directly to the carbon opposite of the hydroxyl group (OH; oxygen and a hydrogen atom) and this compound makes up over 90 % of commercial nonylphenol. NPs are widely used as detergents, emulsifiers, and surfactants (wetting agents) in household and industrial products such as paints, plastics, cosmetics, lubricant oils, construction materials, vulcanized rubber, and paper. They are also used in the processing of fuels, metals, petroleum, textiles, agricultural chemicals, and leather. Substantial quantities of NP-containing compounds reach sewage treatment works, where they biodegrade into several by-products, including NP (Agency, 2010). Further instance, un-reacted NP used as stabilizer in <b>plastic</b> may <b>leach</b> out, and though this might not be a significant source of NP in the environment, it can be direct route of exposure. When it comes in close contact with foods or if the plastics are ingested by aquatic organisms, they may cause serious effects.|$|R

40|$|Plastics have {{transformed}} everyday life; usage is increasing and annual production {{is likely to}} exceed 300 million tonnes by 2010. In this concluding paper to the Theme Issue on Plastics, the Environment and Human Health, we synthesize current understanding of the benefits and concerns surrounding the use of plastics and look to future priorities, challenges and opportunities. It is evident that plastics bring many societal benefits and offer future technological and medical advances. However, concerns about usage and disposal are diverse and include accumulation of waste in landfills and in natural habitats, physical problems for wildlife resulting from ingestion or entanglement in <b>plastic,</b> the <b>leaching</b> of chemicals from plastic products {{and the potential for}} plastics to transfer chemicals to wildlife and humans. However, perhaps the most important overriding concern, which is implicit throughout this volume, is that our current usage is not sustainable. Around 4 per cent of world oil production is used as a feedstock to make plastics and a similar amount is used as energy in the process. Yet over a third of current production is used to make items of packaging, which are then rapidly discarded. Given our declining reserves of fossil fuels, and finite capacity for disposal of waste to landfill, this linear use of hydrocarbons, via packaging and other short-lived applications of plastic, is simply not sustainable. There are solutions, including material reduction, design for end-of-life recyclability, increased recycling capacity, development of bio-based feedstocks, strategies to reduce littering, the application of green chemistry life-cycle analyses and revised risk assessment approaches. Such measures will be most effective through the combined actions of the public, industry, scientists and policymakers. There is some urgency, as the quantity of plastics produced in the first 10 years of the current century is likely to approach the quantity produced in the entire century that preceded...|$|R
40|$|AbstractDue {{to their}} versatility, robustness, and low {{production}} costs, plastics {{are used in}} a wide variety of applications. Plasticizers are mixed with polymers to increase flexibility of plastics. However, plasticizers are not covalently bound to <b>plastics,</b> and thus <b>leach</b> from products into the environment. Several studies have reported that two common plasticizers, bisphenol A (BPA) and phthalates, induce adverse health effects in vertebrates; however few studies have addressed their toxicity to non-mammalian species. The aim of this review is to compare the effects of plasticizers in animals, with a focus on aquatic species. In summary, we identified three main chains of events that occur in animals exposed to BPA and phthalates. Firstly, plasticizers affect development by altering both the thyroid hormone and growth hormone axes. Secondly, these chemicals interfere with reproduction by decreasing cholesterol transport through the mitochondrial membrane, leading to reduced steroidogenesis. Lastly, exposure to plasticizers leads to the activation of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors, the increase of fatty acid oxidation, and the reduction in the ability to cope with the augmented oxidative stress leading to reproductive organ malformations, reproductive defects, and decreased fertility...|$|R
40|$|Phthalate esters or {{phthalates}} {{have become}} ubiquitous water pollutants. They {{are used as}} plasticisers in several plastics. Due to them not being bound to the <b>plastic</b> material they <b>leach</b> out over time. Thus phthalate esters have entered the planet’s aquasphere. Phthalates are stable in the environment and also recalcitrant to most standard water processing methods. Due to their being linked to endocrine disruption and cancer they have been classed as a pollutant of concern by the EU and the American EPA. Previous work had shown that ultrasound of frequency between 20 kHz and 500 kHz {{can be used to}} remove phthalate esters from aqueous solutions as an advanced oxidation process. These works studied the effects of various parameters on the sonolysis. They however, did not perform a satisfactory analysis of the degradation products of the esters studied. These too may be biologically active and need to be ascertained for ultrasound to be considered for their removal from water in industrial and municipal processing centres. Therefore this work describes the study of additional parameters known to be pertinent to ultrasound science, namely the acoustic power, the type of gas dissolved in the solution and the initial concentration of phthalate on the sonolysis of DBP {{as a model for the}} family of phthalate esters. Work was performed using 20 kHz and 515 kHz ultrasound. The performance of these two systems is compared and contrasted throughout. A detailed analysis of the products of the degradation of DBP was then performed using LC-MS based methods. Finally the degradation of other alkyl phthalates was examined as well as the effect of DBP on the quenching of aqueous sonoluminescence. This last topic was performed hoping it would give some insight into the way DBP partitions in the bubble-water interface. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R
40|$|Tetrabromobisphenol A, (TBBPA or Br 4 BPA), is {{a widely}} used {{brominated}} flame retardant (BFR). Although TBBPA and its breakdown products been found in river sediments, {{the environmental impact of}} their contamination is largely unknown. One breakdown product of TBBPA is bisphenol A (BPA), which has been studied intensively for its toxicology because it is used in the manufacturing of <b>plastics</b> and <b>leaches</b> from food containers, water bottles and pipes. Other breakdown products of TBBPA include tribromobisphenol A (Br 3 BPA), dibromobisphenol A (Br 2 BPA), and monobromobisphenol A (BrBPA) but little is known about their toxicology. Since TBBPA is toxic, {{there is a need to}} search for an alternative BFR, with one being tetrabromobisphenol A bis(2, 3 -dibromopropylether) or TBBPA-DBPE. However, almost nothing is known about the toxicology of this compound. Hence, two rainbow trout cell lines, RTL-W 1 from liver and RTgill-W 1 from gill, were used to evaluate the cellular toxicity of TBBPA, BPA, BrBPA, Br 2 BPA, Br 3 BPA and TBBPA-DBPE. 	The cells were exposed to these compounds for 24 h in the basal medium, L- 15, to study their cytotoxicity and in L- 15 with fetal bovine serum (FBS) to evaluate their capacity to induce 7 -ethoxyresorufin o-deethylase (EROD) activity. Viability was measured with three fluorometric indicator dyes: Alamar Blue (AB) for metabolism, 5 -carboxyfluorescein diacetate acetoxymethyl (CFDA AM) for cell membrane integrity, and Neutral Red (NR) for lysosomal activity. The concentrations causing a 50 % reduction in viability (EC 50) as measured with these three dyes were used to compare the relative cytotoxicity of these chemicals. For both cell lines and with all viability endpoints, TBBPA was the most cytotoxic, with EC 50 s ranging from 2. 33 to 3. 11 ug/ml. BPA, BrBPA, Br 2 BPA, and Br 3 BPA also caused dose-dependent declines in cell viability but showed no consistent order of potency. None of the six compounds induced EROD activity, which suggests that they do not activate the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR). Regardless of the endpoint or cell line, TBBPA-DBPE was not cytotoxic. This suggests that, from a toxicological perspective, this compound may be a suitable replacement for TBBPA as a BFR. 	BPA stood out from the other compounds in two regards. BPA caused a dose-dependent decline in cell viability for cultures in L- 15 with FBS, whereas for the other compounds, little or no change in viability was seen in cultures with FBS. BPA elicited a decline in the ability of cells to reduce AB almost immediately upon its addition to cultures in a simple buffer, whereas as for other compounds a decline took time to develop. These results suggest that BPA exerts its cytotoxicity by a different mechanism different from the other compounds. 1 yea...|$|R
40|$|Background: In Homoeopathy, plastic containers/vials {{are used}} for the storing/dispensing of ethanol-based {{medicines}} instead of glass. Various {{studies have suggested that}} <b>plastic</b> components that <b>leach</b> out in stored substances tend to cause contamination and may produce adverse effects in living systems. The present study was aimed to find out chemical composition and leaching behaviour of commonly used plastic vials (PVs) if any during the storage of ethanol-based homoeopathic medicines in optimal environment. Material and Methods: The experiments were conducted on two sample sets of PVs. Chemical properties of PV were assessed by Fourier Transform Infrared Attenuated Total Reflectance (FTIR-ATR) spectroscopy. PV were cut separately [sample- 1 (S- 1) and sample- 2 (S- 2) ] and immersed in Homoeopathic Grade Ethanol (HGE) in conical flask and stored for 7 days at ambient temperature (25 ° ± 5 C) with constant rotary shaking. After 7 days, S- 1 and S- 2 of PV in Homoeopathic Grade Ethanol (HGE) were decanted and filtered. Aliquots (A 1 and A 2) were analysed by proton nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (H 1 NMR). The spectral graph obtained by FTIR-ATR spectroscopy for PV compositions and spectral graph obtained by H 1 NMR spectroscopy for PV ethanol aliquots were examined for PVs material and PV leaching effect in HGE. Results: FTIR-ATR spectra showed that PV are made up of two types of polyolefin′s compounds i. e. Low Density Polyethylene (LDPE) and Linear Low Density Polyethylene (LLDPE). Aliquots of PV in HGE showed the presence benzophenone and its methyl derivative, heat and light stabiliser (2, 2, 6, 6 -tetramethylpiperidine and amino derivative), antioxidant (4, 4 ′- thiobis and 2 -tertbutyl- 5 -methylphenol) and plasticizer bis 2 -Diethylhexyl phthalate (DEHP) or Dioctyl phthalate (DOP). Results of study suggest that PVs <b>leach</b> out <b>plastic</b> polymers in HGE.

40|$|As {{discussed}} in chapter 1, phosphorylation {{is a very}} important post-translational modification in signal transduction and plays very important roles in the whole cellular life. Phosphorylation is mediated by PKs in cells. Mutations in PKs can be a cause or consequence of some diseases. In the recent decades, PKs have been an enzyme target for discovering disease mechanisms and the related therapeutic products to cure these diseases. Till the end of 2013, there have been more than 20 kinase inhibitory molecules approved by USFDA for the treatment of some kinase induced diseases, like IM for CML. However, this success is a small step in drug discovery for kinase induced diseases. Efforts still need to be put in to discover more potential small inhibitory molecules to protect humans against variable diseases caused by deregulation of PKs. Abl 1 is a non-receptor tyrosine kinase and its hybrid Bcr-Abl fusion gene is found in most patients with CML and in some patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) or acute myeloid leukemia (AML). The constitutively high TK activity of Bcr-Abl results in unregulated cell division. So efforts have not been stopped to find new effective TK inhibitors since the first TK inhibitor drug IM was approved by USFDA in 2001. Here, Abl 1 is chosen as a model enzyme to establish different instrumental methods for discovering new TK inhibitors. Abltide is the substrate used in this project. To maintain the catalytic reaction of Abl 1 in vitro, the enzyme incubation conditions mimicked the in vivo conditions in the beginning and were optimized as much as possible to simplify the product readout procedure. Finally, the phosphorylation reaction catalyzed by Abl 1 was conducted in 15 mM Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7. 5) containing DTT (1 mM) and MgCl 2 (5 mM) in the presence of ATP and Abltide at 30 &# 176;C. For inhibitor study, test molecules are added into this reaction system to prevent substrate from converting to product. In this thesis, several discontinuous enzyme assays were aimed at, so the enzymatic reaction should be stopped before the readout of the product. In this study, the stop solutions were mainly composed of ACN, but the amount was slightly changed according to the composition of the mobile phase in consideration of the peak shapes of target analytes. Chapter 2 describes a LC-ESI-MS method for kinetic study of Abl 1. As we all know, Tris-HCl is non-volatile, which is not compatible with the ESI mode. So an online desalting system, with the assistance of a divert valve, was introduced to remove non-volatile salts before determination of the analyte by ESI-MS positive mode. This analytical method was validated according to FDA guidance. The LOQ was 10 nM for p-Abltide and 25 nM for Abltide. The linear regression equation of the calibration curve was y = 0. 8895 x + 0. 0443; r 2 = 0. 9997. The %RSDs across all data points were less than 10. 0 % in the precision test and assay accuracy ranged from - 1. 6 to + 5. 3 %. A stability test indicated that both p-Abltide and Abltide were stable during the process of the enzymatic reaction in vitro. In the Abl 1 assay, when the ratio of ACN/reaction mixture (v/v) was 1 / 3, the enzymatic reaction was stopped completely and the peak shape of p-Abltide was acceptable. The study in this chapter indicated that the reaction of Abl 1 and two substrates (Abltide and ATP) behaves according to a ternary-complex mechanism. The Km of Abltide was calculated by nonlinear regression as 34. 78 µM and the Vmax value was 5. 563 µmol/mg/min. The Km and Vmax of ATP were 43. 61 µM and 5. 906 µmol/mg/min, respectively. A substrate concentration around or below the Km is suggested in tests to identify competitive inhibitors in an inhibition assay. Therefore, 35 µM of Abltide and the same amount of ATP were used to study Abl 1 potential inhibitors in chapter 3. A LC-ESI-MS method using a gradient mobile phase system was developed to test the inhibitory activity of potential Abl 1 inhibitors. The LOQ was 40. 8 nM for p-Abltide and 26. 7 nM for Abltide. Due to the difference in mobile phase used in chapter 2 and 3, the quenching solutions were different. In this study, the ratio of ACN/reaction mixture (v/v) was decreased to 1 / 4 to maintain a good peak shape of p-Abltide. The linear regression equation was y = 0. 9151 x + 0. 0883, r 2 > 0. 995. The RSDs for precision were less than 10. 0 %. Assay accuracy ranged from - 6. 93 to + 0. 15 %. The robustness test for the gradient mobile phase system suggested that the LC system was robust. Moreover, there was no matrix effect on the analytes ionization. Using this method, the IC 50 values were determined as 201. 1 nM for IM, 925. 1 pM for dasatinib, 64. 03 nM for EGCG, 1. 915 µM for MPB. The inhibitory activity fluctuated from 26 % to 55 % for caffeic acid at concentrations from 1 nM to 1 mM. So, the inhibition potency ranking is dasatinib > EGCG > IM > MPB > caffeic acid. Importantly, a concentration range should be applied to screen NPs in order to avoid false negative results and not to miss the compounds with high effect at low dosage. Considering the important regional influence on NPs, it is convenient to study NPs locally. LC-UV is a worldwide technique as it is cheap. So a LC-UV method was developed to perform an inhibitor study of Abl 1, which is described in chapter 4. The LOQ was 0. 2 µM for p-Abltide using UV detection, which all other parameters tested during the validation have met the criteria in the FDA guidelines. The validated method was applied to study potential inhibitors of Abl 1, and the results suggested that the inhibition potency ranking for NPs is dependent on their concentrations. In this test, the inhibition potency ranking was nilotinib > IM > quercetin > chrysophanol > resveratrol when their concentrations were set at 1 µM and 10 µM. However, the ranking for the three NPs reversed and was quercetin nilotinib > IM. The IC 50 values estimated herein were in good agreement with those reported in literature and the inhibition potency ranking was also consistent with the reported data. Therefore, the LC-InPED method described in this chapter is applicable to the inhibition study of Abl 1. Unfortunately, an unexpected failure of the enzymatic reaction happened in the process of this project. A lot of time was consumed to dig out the reason. Finally, the Abl 1 inhibitory activity of compounds from <b>leaching</b> <b>plastic</b> tubes might be the cause. Chapter 6 portrays this unpredicted finding. The leaching compounds were extracted from the plastic tubes and the inhibitory activity of the tube extract was confirmed by Abl 1 assays described in chapter 2 and 3. Additionally, MS spectra and UV chromatograms of the tube extract solution verified the existence of unknown compounds in the tube extract solution. It was tried to identify these compounds by high resolution MS, but unfortunately, no conclusion could be made till now. Hence, in the future more effort would be done to identify and isolate those active compounds in the extract solution. nrpages: 140 status: publishe...|$|R
