50|$|Most {{compressors}} {{are either}} <b>positive</b> <b>displacement</b> compressors or radial compressors. <b>Positive</b> <b>displacement</b> compressors are currently {{the most efficient}} type of compressor, and have the largest refrigerating effect per single unit (400-2500 RT). They have a large range of possible power supplies, and can be 380 V, 1000 V, or even higher. The principle behind <b>positive</b> <b>displacement</b> compressors utilizes a turbine to compress refrigerant into high-pressure vapor. <b>Positive</b> <b>displacement</b> compressors are of four main types: screw compressor, rolling piston compressor, reciprocating compressor, and rotary compressor.|$|R
50|$|A {{practical}} {{difference between}} dynamic and <b>positive</b> <b>displacement</b> pumps {{is how they}} operate under closed valve conditions. <b>Positive</b> <b>displacement</b> pumps physically displace fluid, so closing a valve downstream of a <b>positive</b> <b>displacement</b> pump produces a continual pressure build up that can cause mechanical failure of pipeline or pump. Dynamic pumps differ in {{that they can be}} safely operated under closed valve conditions (for short periods of time).|$|R
40|$|Downsizing is an {{established}} {{trend in the}} development of passenger car engines. However, the benefits of an improved fuel economy are often obtained {{at the expense of the}} engine’s dynamic response (owing to increasing demands on the boosting system) and, consequently, the vehicle driveability. The use of a continuously variable transmission in the supercharger driveline offers increased control flexibility over the air path, which could allow more suitable calibrations to be developed. This paper gives details of a co-simulation-based investigation into the trade-off between the steady-state part-load fuel efficiency and the resulting tip-in transient response for a highly boosted downsized gasoline engine. The engine was a 2. 0 l in-line four-cylinder unit, designed to replace a 5. 0 l, naturally aspirated V 8, equipped with a <b>positive</b> <b>displacement</b> <b>supercharger</b> in a sequential series arrangement with a fixed-geometry turbocharger with an external wastegate. The supercharger can be de-clutched and bypassed, and therefore three separate supercharger engagement regimes were investigated for part-load operation, defined as follows: with the supercharger disengaged and bypassed; with the supercharger engaged with a fixed drive ratio; with the supercharger engaged using a variable ratio (i. e. through a continuously variable transmission). For each of these supercharger engagement regimes, design-of-experiments and optimisation techniques were used to find the best settings for the key engine control parameters such as the intake and exhaust valve timings and the exhaust gas recirculation rate. Using these calibrations as a starting point, the transient performance was then assessed in fixed-speed tip-in simulations. The trade-off situation was found to be highly complex; identifying the best overall balance of the steady-state efficiency and the dynamic performance requires a subjective assessment. However, the continuously variable transmission does provide the best potential for dynamic response combined with a satisfactory fuel economy. It is suggested that the most suitable solution would be to have multiple user selectable calibrations, such as the ‘economy’ and ‘sport’ modes used on many modern vehicles...|$|E

50|$|Pumps can be {{classified}} by their method of <b>displacement</b> into <b>positive</b> <b>displacement</b> pumps, impulse pumps, velocity pumps, gravity pumps, steam pumps and valveless pumps.

50|$|A <b>positive</b> <b>displacement</b> pump {{must not}} operate against a closed valve on the {{discharge}} {{side of the}} pump, because it has no shutoff head like centrifugal pumps.

40|$|LectureOwing {{to their}} {{impressive}} properties reciprocating <b>positive</b> <b>displacement</b> pumps {{are used in}} many applications. Pumping fluids at high delivery pressures and metering are the areas of frequent use. The design of reciprocating pumps requires an exact knowledge of the appearing phenomena such as unacceptable pipeline pulsation and harmful cavitation. But cavitation in reciprocating <b>positive</b> <b>displacement</b> pumps is still an insufficiently understood problem. For {{a better understanding of}} the effects of incipient, partial and full cavitation in reciprocating <b>positive</b> <b>displacement</b> pumps high-speed camera measurements were done under real operating conditions using a horizontal single-acting plunger pump. Inspection windows were placed to capture all cavitation phenomena. Exemplarily the cavitation phenomena and their erosive potential are to be described on the basis of high-speed sequences for selected cavitation conditions. Also the mechanism of the incipient cavitation and the opening of the self acting valves could be clearly investigated with this experimental setup. Standards and guidelines were discussed concerning the economical operating of reciprocating <b>positive</b> <b>displacement</b> pumps...|$|R

50|$|<b>Positive</b> <b>displacement</b> {{pumps are}} the most {{effective}} for low vacuums. Momentum transfer pumps in conjunction {{with one or two}} <b>positive</b> <b>displacement</b> pumps {{are the most}} common configuration used to achieve high vacuums. In this configuration the <b>positive</b> <b>displacement</b> pump serves two purposes. First it obtains a rough vacuum in the vessel being evacuated before the momentum transfer pump can be used to obtain the high vacuum, as momentum transfer pumps cannot start pumping at atmospheric pressures. Second the <b>positive</b> <b>displacement</b> pump backs up the momentum transfer pump by evacuating to low vacuum the accumulation of displaced molecules in the high vacuum pump. Entrapment pumps can be added to reach ultrahigh vacuums, but they require periodic regeneration of the surfaces that trap air molecules or ions. Due to this requirement their available operational time can be unacceptably short in low and high vacuums, thus limiting their use to ultrahigh vacuums. Pumps also differ in details like manufacturing tolerances, sealing material, pressure, flow, admission or no admission of oil vapor, service intervals, reliability, tolerance to dust, tolerance to chemicals, tolerance to liquids and vibration.|$|R

50|$|Vacuum {{pumps are}} {{combined}} with chambers and operational procedures {{into a wide}} variety of vacuum systems. Sometimes more than one pump will be used (in series or in parallel) in a single application. A partial vacuum, or rough vacuum, can be created using a <b>positive</b> <b>displacement</b> pump that transports a gas load from an inlet port to an outlet (exhaust) port. Because of their mechanical limitations, such pumps can only achieve a low vacuum. To achieve a higher vacuum, other techniques must then be used, typically in series (usually following an initial fast pump down with a <b>positive</b> <b>displacement</b> pump). Some examples might be use of an oil sealed rotary vane pump (the most common <b>positive</b> <b>displacement</b> pump) backing a diffusion pump, or a dry scroll pump backing a turbomolecular pump. There are other combinations depending on the level of vacuum being sought.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. We {{assign to}} each nondegenerate Hamiltonian on a closed sym-plectic {{manifold}} a Floer-theoretic quantity called its “boundary depth, ” and establish basic results {{about how the}} boundary depths of different Hamil-tonians are related.

For instance, any coisotropic submanifold of contact type (in the sense of Bolle) in any closed symplectic manifold has <b>positive</b> <b>displacement</b> energy, as does any stable coisotropic submanifold of a Stein manifold. We also show that any stable coisotropic submanifold admits a Riemannian metric that makes its characteristic foliation totally geodesic, and that this latter, weaker, condition is enough to imply <b>positive</b> <b>displacement</b> energy under certain topological hy-potheses. 1. introduction A nondegenerate Hamiltonian H on a closed symplectic manifold (M,ω) has an associated Floer chain complex CF∗(H,J) (see, e. g., [30] for a survey; we use...|$|R
40|$|In this paper, an {{integral}} methodology for the modeling of a twin-screw compressor is presented. Starting from a known rotor profile, all the algorithms {{to calculate the}} second rotor profile, {{the size of the}} control volume, and the compressor’s performance are presented. The proposed modeling approach can be applied in an optimization procedure to find the optimal rotor profiles for a given application, with corresponding working conditions. Furthermore, based on the modeling results and substantiated with measurements on different compressor types, a similarity law for <b>positive</b> <b>displacement</b> compressors seems to exist. The existence of a similarity law has large application potential as it could be used to predict the performance of a <b>positive</b> <b>displacement</b> compressor in other than the (lab) tested working conditions.
