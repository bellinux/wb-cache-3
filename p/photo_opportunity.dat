So Seedman, knowing he would regret doing so, forced Dellernia's head up and held him by the chin so his face would be visible.|$|E

25|$|The {{colourful}} {{theme for}} the Australia Pavilion, which became synonymous with the hosting of the Expo with Australia as host nation, was designed by prominent Australian artist Ken Done, and featured huge playful colourful letters making up the word Australia in an Australia Pavilion Entrance set, and Exit set, with the entrance set a stack of nine, 3x3, some 2.1 metres high each, and the exit set, {{in a line of}} nine letters, some 5.6 metres high each. These letters became a very popular <b>photo</b> <b>opportunity</b> for the Expo, and the theme was also found on the brightly coloured Australia Pavilion uniforms also.|$|E
25|$|Negative {{criticism}} of Mann's works {{is not hard}} to find. One of her detractors, Pat Robertson of the Christian Broadcasting Network, has said that “selling photographs of children in their nakedness for profit is an exploitation of the parental role and I think it’s wrong.” He views such work as a violation of the responsibility of parents to do everything in their power to protect, shelter, and nurture their children. More negative criticism came from Raymond Sokolov’s article Critique: Censoring Virginia in the Wall Street Journal. He questioned whether children should be photographed nude and whether federal funds should be appropriated for such artworks. Accompanying his article was a modified image by Mann of her daughter Virginia (Virginia at 4), in which her eyes, nipples, and pubic region were now covered with black bars. Mann said he used the image without permission “to illustrate that {{this is the kind of}} thing that shouldn’t be shown.” She was devastated and insulted that someone could mutilate her photograph that way. Virginia was also upset about the article. She wrote a letter to the author saying “Dear Sir, I don’t like the way you crossed me out.” Mann said that after Virginia saw the article, she started touching herself on the areas that were blacked out, saying, “what’s wrong with me?” It was somewhat difficult for Mann to understand the harsh {{criticism of}} these photographs, for she did not stage these moments — instead when she saw a <b>photo</b> <b>opportunity</b> unfolding, she simply asked her children stop moving until she could capture it. When Mann was young, she was often nude, so she raised her children similarly.|$|E

[...] Carl Hiaasen eulogized her in The Miami Herald, writing that The Everglades: River of Grass was [...] "monumental", and praised her passion and her resolve; even when {{politicians}} finally found value in the Everglades and visited her for a <b>photo</b> <b>opportunity,</b> she still provoked them to do more and do it faster.|$|E
500|$|Time {{describes}} the piece {{as an essential}} <b>photo</b> <b>opportunity,</b> {{and more of a}} destination than a work of art.The New York Times writes that it is both a [...] "tourist magnet" [...] and an [...] "extraordinary art object", while USA Today refers to the sculpture as a monumental abstract work. Chicago art critic Edward Lifson considers Cloud Gate to be among the greatest pieces of public art in the world. The American Welding Society recognized Cloud Gate, MTH Industries and PSI with the group's Extraordinary Welding Award.

Though Phillips {{no longer had}} the right to release any Presley material, he made sure the session was captured on tape. The results were notable as the [...] "Million Dollar Quartet" [...] recordings—Johnny Cash was long thought to have played as well, but he was present only briefly at Phillips's instigation for a <b>photo</b> <b>opportunity.</b> The year ended with a front-page story in The Wall Street Journal reporting that Presley merchandise had brought in $22 million on top of his record sales, and Billboards declaration that he had placed more songs in the top 100 than any other artist since records were first charted. In his first full year at RCA, one of the music industry's largest companies, Presley had accounted for over 50 percent of the label's singles sales.|$|E

Against her wishes, Leslie reluctantly does so. When Raul starts {{speaking}} Spanish to the camera, Leslie asks April to translate, and learns Raul is discussing his [...] "Committee to Humiliate and Shame America". A furious Leslie tears up the $35,000 check and shouts [...] "Viva America", prompting Raul to declare Pawnee is no longer their sister city and storm out. Leslie insists she will raise the money to build the park without them and Tom, inspired by her example, secretly puts all the tip money he made from the Venezuelans into the park donation jar.

500|$|Mackinac Island {{has been}} a tourist {{destination}} since the late 19th century. The island was the country's second national park, after Yellowstone, until the land was given to Michigan in 1895 to become its first state park. M-185 has been recognized in the press for its unique role as the only state highway without car traffic in the United States by such publications as the Chicago Tribune, The Kansas City Star, The Saturday Evening Post, and the Toronto Star. and [...] In 2003, it was named the [...] "best scenic drive" [...] in the state by The Detroit News. In 2008, USA Today named the island one of the [...] "10 great places to get your feet back on the ground" [...] as a car-free destination, highlighting the unique status of M-185 in the process. The magazine Paraplegia News, in an article encouraging its readers to visit Mackinac Island, called the trek around the island on M-185 a [...] "high priority" [...] for visitors.

2500|$|ABC News {{reporter}} John Miller, who {{has also}} worked as a press secretary for law enforcement agencies, has identified three distinct stages {{in the evolution of}} the perp walk. Until the 1940s, suspects were paraded before reporters across a stage in the basement of police headquarters. The reporters decided if any would make a good story. After that period, reporters were assigned to individual station houses, and watched as suspects were booked and fingerprinted. They often were allowed to talk to them, and if any were deemed worthy of coverage a <b>photo</b> <b>opportunity</b> was usually provided. Bank robber Willie Sutton's legendary response (which he denied ever having made) of [...] "Because that's where the money is" [...] to a question about why he robbed banks, was said to have been uttered during a perp walk held in this fashion. A variant of the perp walk from this era, now no longer practiced, was the [...] "confession shot" [...] in which the defendant would be photographed signing or reviewing his written statement admitting to the crime.|$|E
