Additionally, pump users are interested in simple, easy to use, moderate cost, reliable bearing condition instruments.

40|$|Anywhere liquid {{pressure}} is reduced across a throttling device, {{there is a}} potential application for a hydraulic power recovery motor (HPRM). Cost of power makes HPRM's attractive with recoveries as small as 25 hp on a continuous basis. When incorporated into new plants, expansions, or revamps, payback can occur in as little as six months. When adapted to existing installations, payback may require 12 to 18 months depending on the extent of new hardware necessary. Because it is a positive displacement device, the HPRM torque and speed are almost completely independent - unlike hydraulic power recovery turbines (centrifugal motors). Three screw HPRM's have low moments of inertia, operate at low vibration and noise levels and extract power in the 70 - 85 % efficiency range. Output power levels to 600 hp and differential pressures to 2500 psi are possible. A primary application for the HPRM is driving process pumps.

40|$|Lecturepg. 59 In this paper, an {{innovative}} approach of applying gas-lubricated, noncontacting sealing technology to <b>process</b> <b>pumps</b> is presented, {{in which a}} novel ?twin hybrid? design is incorporated to address the issues of gas seal applications to <b>process</b> <b>pumps.</b> In this design, orifice-injected inert barrier gas between concentric twin seal faces gives rise to hydrostatic action, so that the inner seal face with hydrodynamic lift features upon running can initiate and maintain stable face separation, even at extremely slow speed. The outer plain face seal, by way of higher barrier gas pressure, prevents any process fluid on the outer diameter cavity from leaking or emitting through sealing faces. The twin face design compacting two seals to one seal ring not only reduces greatly the cartridge size so as to fit all pumps without stuffing box modifications, but maintains its dual seal functionality with the single seal simplicity. The hybrid feature combining hydrostatic action for start/stop and slow speed operations, and hydrodynamic action for initiating and maintaining stable face separation not only enhances the sealing performance, but also expands its application ranges. Detailed design features and operating principles including reducing O-ring hysteresis and pressure reversal or loss-of-barrier gas are discussed. Extensive laboratory and field test were conducted to validate the designs. A field test is described to exemplify its applications in <b>process</b> <b>pumps</b> including its performance in abnormal operating conditions...|$|R
40|$|Lecturepg. 133 This paper {{introduces}} {{the benefits of}} applying the fiber-optic Fabry-Perot interferometer (ffpi) pressure sensor {{as a means of}} detecting cavitation and flow instabilities in centrifugal pumps. The need for monitoring dynamic pressure pulsations in pumps as a means of preventing catastrophic failures resulting from severe hydraulic fluctuations has always existed in the pumping industry. However, the ability to continuously sense such phenomena has heretofore not been available with conventional pressure sensors. The development of the ffpi pressure sensor has made high temperature monitoring in <b>process</b> <b>pumps</b> possible. Their ability to function reliably at temperatures exceeding 700 degrees F, and in hazardous environments, make them ideal for use in real-world <b>process</b> applications.

Moreover, even a functioning seal cannot be classified as a zero emission point within a chemical plant; the cost of these emissions will continue to rise with time. Business competition and societal pressure demand that maintenance costs be reduced and chemical emissions to the environment be eliminated. The progress made by one chemical manufacturing company in their meeting these demands, while also satisfying the additional business objectives of safety, reliability, and profitability is reviewed. The mechanical features and hydraulic characteristics of various types of sealless pumps are described. Centrifugal pumps utilizing canned design features and magnetic drive technology are included. Guidelines for the economic justification of sealless pumps vis-?-vis sealed pumps are outlined in a simple life cycle cost model. Sealless pumps are not the panacea. As with most types of machinery, they are plagued by design limitations and/or faults.

The challenge of designing a vertical <b>process</b> <b>pump</b> that will deliver a high vapor pressure liquid with poor lubricating qualities at 10, 000 ft TDH and stay within budgetary constraints is understandably an enormous task.

Also, purchase specifications for the design of the pump and pump system do not always coincide harmoniously with the actual system requirements. As a result, these pumps go through a never ending refinement process of design as the user company and pump company strive to improve the MTBF as process conditions change and technology evolves.
