25|$|Pashkin — Chairman of {{the local}} trade union. He {{frequently}} urges the group to work harder and later brings in former bureaucrats to <b>pick</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>slack.</b> Pashkin once went through a long court trial in which his patriotism and ethnicity, specifically due to {{the name of his}} father, Leon Ilych, were questioned.|$|E
25|$|Keynes' {{basic idea}} was simple: {{to keep people}} fully employed, governments have to run deficits {{when the economy is}} slowing, as the private sector would not invest enough to keep {{production}} at the normal level and bring the economy out of recession. Keynesian economists called on governments during times of economic crisis to <b>pick</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>slack</b> by increasing government spending and/or cutting taxes.|$|E
25|$|Scully {{also contributed}} to the network's tennis and PGA Tour golf {{coverage}} in the late 1970s and early 1980s, usually working the golf events with Pat Summerall, Ken Venturi, and Ben Wright. From 1975 to 1982, {{he was part of the}} team that covered the Masters tournament for CBS. Scully's network commitments led to his working a reduced schedule with the Dodgers, who hired Ross Porter to help <b>pick</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>slack.</b>|$|E
5000|$|In 1979, {{the team}} {{became known as}} the Rutherford Signmen, and once again they were the class of the Junior C league. Kazarian had graduated, but Randy McMillen and Dave Cruickshank more than <b>picked</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>slack,</b> with “Rooster” {{succeeding}} “Kaz” as scoring champ and the team sailing to its third straight Ontario title.|$|R
50|$|The Rams {{limited the}} Cardinals to 161 total yards of offense {{and put up}} 401 yards {{themselves}} even though Marshall Faulk did not play. Lamar Gordon <b>picked</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>slack</b> with 81 rushing {{yards and a touchdown}} while Marc Bulger ran in one score and threw touchdowns to Torry Holt and Dane Looker in a 37-13 rout.|$|R

25|$|The law of {{accelerating}} returns is {{the basis}} for all of these speculations about creating a digital brain. It explains why computational capacity will continue to increase unabated even after Moore's Law expires, which Kurzweil predicts will happen around 2020. Integrated circuits, the current method of creating computer chips, will fade from the limelight, while some new more advanced technology will <b>pick</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>slack.</b> It is this new technology that will get us to the massive levels of computation needed to create an artificial brain.|$|E
25|$|The Bengals forced three interceptions, {{and allowed}} only 45 rushing yards and 136 passing yards, while their offense held {{the ball for}} 39:29. Bills {{starting}} running back Thurman Thomas was held to just six yards on four carries, while quarterback Jim Kelly completed only 14 of 30 passes for 161 yards and a touchdown, with three interceptions. The Bills had only 10 first downs, one more than the AFC Championship record for the fewest amount ever, and failed to convert any of their 10 third down conversion attempts. Just like their previous game, the Bengals did not get much of a performance from NFL MVP Boomer Esiason, who completed only 11 of 20 passes for 94 yards, with a touchdown and two interceptions. But once again, their running game was able to <b>pick</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>slack,</b> gaining 175 yards on the ground, 102 {{yards and two touchdowns}} coming from fullback Ickey Woods.|$|E
25|$|Assigning jobs in occupations {{that women}} had never held before was a {{daunting}} task. By social custom, working {{women did not}} work in the trades and rarely supervised men. Women worked mainly in offices, classrooms, hospitals, retail stores, libraries, and beauty shops. In 1943, Marine Corps manpower was in short supply, but members of the WR were available to <b>pick</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>slack.</b> However, the corps had to select, train, classify, and assign the women to jobs where they could contribute and {{do so in the}} shortest amount of time. After completing their Marine Corps indoctrination training, selected women received advanced schooling in a variety of specialties. By {{the end of the war}} 9,641 members of the WR had attended more than 30 specialist schools run by higher educational institutions, the Army, Navy, and Marine Corps. Colonel Streeter's philosophy was to let them try anything, except heavy lifting and combat. The WR strength on 1June 1945 was 17,672. Of this number 1,342 were engaged in occupations classified as professional or semi-professional; 10,279 in clerical; 741 in sales; 587 in services; 344 in skilled trades; 1,305 as semi-skilled; 14 as unskilled; 35 as students; and 6 as unaccounted for. Marine Corps recruiting literature indicated there were over 200 types of jobs available in the WR. While this may have been correct, the fact was that well over half the women were assigned to and worked in clerical fields. The first duty posts and stations for the WR included places such as Washington, D.C.; New York; Philadelphia; Chicago; San Diego; and Quantico, Virginia. Marine aviation was the fastest-growing unit of the Corps. Both officers and enlisted women served at Marine Corps Air Stations including Cherry Point and Edenton, North Carolina; Paris Island, South Carolina; El Centro, El Toro, Mojave, and Santa Barbara, California.|$|E
5000|$|The Grand Street Shuttle (black [...] ) was a New York City Subway {{service that}} {{operated}} {{during the long}} Manhattan Bridge rehabilitation project while the north tracks (connecting to the IND Sixth Avenue Line via the Chrystie Street Connection) were closed.

5000|$|Shonda Rhimes {{stated that}} the fourth season will {{focus more on the}} core {{characters}}, as opposed to the third season where more characters were introduced. Rhimes explained why: [...] "Kerry Washington couldn't work 14 hours a day, so we had to tell our story in a different way, and that necessitated other people both <b>picking</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>slack</b> in beautiful ways".|$|R
30|$|Employees who {{perceived}} altruistic behaviour from their managers also reported being more innovative, suggesting new product ideas {{and ways of}} doing work better. Moreover, {{they were more likely}} to report engaging in team citizenship behavior, going beyond the call of duty, <b>picking</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>slack</b> for an absent colleague - all indirect effects of feeling more included in their workgroups (Prime & Salib, 2014).|$|R
500|$|When Brady Hoke {{replaced}} Rich Rodriguez as Michigan's head coach, AnnArbor.com {{predicted that}} Hemingway {{would be the}} biggest individual beneficiary on the team, as Hoke was expected to change the team's offensive schemes from the spread offense to a pro-style offense. He was also expected to help <b>pick</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>slack</b> created by the full-season suspension of Stonum. As a fifth-year senior, he established a new career high on September 10, 2011, against Notre Dame in the rivalry game and during the first night game ever played at Michigan Stadium, when he recorded three receptions for 165 yards. [...] Before the game, Desmond Howard, who had worn number 21 before Hemingway at Michigan, was honored for his enshrinement in the College Football Hall of Fame, and the jersey number was designated to be adorned with a [...] "Desmond Howard: Michigan Legend" [...] patch on the upper-right chest. On October 8, against the Northwestern, Hemingway had 5 receptions {{for a total of}} 124 yards. Following the 2011 Big Ten Conference football season, he earned All-Big Ten Conference honorable mention recognition from the coaches. [...] In the January 3, 2012 Sugar Bowl, 23–20 overtime victory over Virginia Tech he recorded the team's only two touchdowns, earning 2012 Sugar Bowl Most Outstanding Player honors. He concluded the season with team highs of 34 receptions, 699 yards and four receiving touchdowns, giving him a conference leading 20.6 yards per reception. His receiving average ranked third in all of Division I FBS. Hemingway was invited to the January 21, 2012 East–West Shrine Game, and he was an early invite to the February 22 — 28, 2012 NFL Scouting Combine.|$|E

2500|$|Thailand saw an {{explosion}} of locally produced films during the 1970s after the Thai government imposed a heavy tax on imported films in 1977, {{which led to a}} boycott of Thailand by Hollywood studios. To <b>pick</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>slack,</b> 150 Thai films were made in 1978 alone. Many of these films were low-grade action films and were derided by critics and scholars as [...] "nam nao" [...] or [...] "stinking water".|$|E

Army had a 15-point {{lead on the}} Owls through the midpoint in the 3rd quarter backed by three Trent Steelman touchdown runs and one touchdown pass. But Temple would score 29 straight points including 2 touchdown runs by Brown {{to pull away from}} the Black Knights.|$|R
2500|$|On February 3, 1894, Bellamy's The New Nation {{was forced}} to suspend {{publication}} owing to financial difficulties. The publication's top paid circulation in its best year had only reached the 8,000 mark, and even this had proven {{to be no more}} than a fond memory by 1894. New periodicals had emerged to <b>pick</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>slack,</b> including The Coming Nation, a weekly newspaper published by Julius Augustus Wayland, which proclaimed itself to be an extension of the Bellamyite political tradition. Two years of phantom existence followed, with a handful of pamphlets produced by a Bureau of Nationalist Literature in Philadelphia on behalf of the rapidly waning movement. By 1896 the Bellamyite movement had expired, with all but a small handful of isolated groups vanished forever. A Nationalist Party did run candidates for office in Wisconsin (unsuccessfully) as late as 1896.) ...|$|E
2500|$|Carolina led {{by as many}} as 11 in {{the first}} half of the Big Four Tournament contest before Duke trimmed the lead to five at halftime. [...] Carolina played much of the second half shorthanded as Al Wood and Sam Perkins got into foul trouble; Perkins would foul out with 7:55 to go. James Worthy did his best to <b>pick</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>slack,</b> leading the Tar Heels with 26 points and hitting eight {{straight}} shots at one point in the second half. [...] Nevertheless, Gene Banks was able to give Duke only its second lead of the game, 73–71, with 2:36 left. [...] Carolina came back to tie it at 76. [...] Future Tar Heel head coach Matt Doherty, a freshman at the time, was then fouled, and hit a free throw with 12 seconds remaining to provide the winning margin. [...] A Jimmy Braddock free throw in the final second gave Carolina the 78–76 victory.|$|E

50|$|The major {{motivation}} for the Republicans' surrender was not a lack of will but a loss of clandestine materiel support. The Neu Reich supplied Republican agents in Europe with aid to keep the British Empire out of the Pan-European War. Then the Russian Communist Party began <b>picking</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>slack</b> to keep Great Britain from siding with the more conservative factions in the Russian Civil War. This was stopped once the Bolsheviks were firmly in power.|$|R

50|$|The {{growth of}} the Illawarra region, and of Sydney to the north, has created {{significant}} opportunities for the port's future development.

The defense was suspect at times (nearly 300 passing yards by Akron), but linebacker Kevin Worthy <b>picked</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>slack</b> with a 72-yard fumble return for a touchdown. Iowa's 37 points in the first quarter was a school record for points in a single quarter.|$|R
