We report a large scale <b>photometric</b> <b>evaluation</b> in six companies in northern and central Italy. Operator tasks were predominantly administrative with some computer aided design activity.

Based upon site visits to various commercial aircraft sites, the existing visual environment in aircraft inspection {{has been found to be}} generally inadequate. This study demonstrates a procedure which can be utilized to assist in selecting the appropriate lighting equipment for aircraft tasks. An evaluation was undertaken at a single commercial aircraft maintenance facility which included task analyses of typical inspection jobs combined with <b>photometric</b> <b>evaluations</b> of the ambient and task lighting. Portable and personal lighting sources were sampled and evaluated in the laboratory and on the hangar floor for both photometric performance and ease of use.

40|$|A new {{approach}} to photogrammetric restitution of 3 -line stereo scanner images is presented for use within the MOMS- 02 and MOMS- 2 P project. It {{is based on the}} replacement of the orientation image concept by a rigorous treatment of the orbit information in the bundle adjustment process. To this end, the trajectory data and the orbit determination parameter covariance matrix are incorporated into the photogrammetric processing, together with associated partial derivatives of the spacecraft position with respect to the epoch state and model parameters. By constraining the adjusted trajectory to the physical laws of orbital motion, the bundle adjustment process is stabilized by a significant reduction of the number of required destimation parameters. The basic algorithms for the incorporation of orbital constraints into the <b>photometric</b> <b>evaluation</b> of stereo scanner images and the resulting benefits are described. Special focus is given to the application for MOMS- 02 image analysis and necessary prerequisits for an optimum use of the new concept within the MOMS/Priroda project are discussed...|$|E
40|$|Abstract—This {{paper is}} {{a study of the}} {{influences}} of the dif-ferent parameters which affect the <b>photometric</b> <b>evaluation</b> of light-emitting surfaces (due to reflection or self- emission) when a conventional color digital camera is used. The overall {{purpose of this paper is}} to evaluate the luminance and the reflectivity of the vertical traffic sign with the camera in order to provide an automatic recognition of deteriorated reflective sheeting material of which the traffic signs were made. This paper describes how the A/D converter output signal given by a pixel of the digital camera can be related to the luminance and the reflectivity of the corresponding surface element whose image is formed on a pixel. Thus, each surface element of the traffic sign’s surface can be separately evaluated. By photometrically calibrating the camera, we have been able to prove this relationship in our experiments.

Traditional chromatographic methods are expensive and results need long turnaround times, making them incompatible with rapid on-site decision making. ELISA methods {{have been shown to}} meet or exceed the performance of gas chromatography [...] they offer rapid low-cost analysis, thereby increasing the frequency of sampling and enhancing data quality. Automated ELISA workstations allow the full benefit of these kits to be realized. Sample preparation, reagent pipetting, incubation, and <b>photometric</b> <b>evaluation</b> can be performed without user intervention. Reliability is increased through the elimination of operator error, better accuracy and precision, and often higher speed. Much larger batch sizes are possible and these systems can provide sample tracking with report generation for documentation requirements.

There exist a few proposals of local integration methods (Coleman/Jain 1982, Healey/Jain 1984, Wu/Li 1988, Rodehorst 1993), and two proposals for global optimization (Horn/Brooks 1986 and Frankot/ Chellappa 1988).

40|$|This {{dissertation}} conceptualizes and computationally {{demonstrates a}} photometric characterization methodology for daylighting fixtures. The methodology {{is based upon}} applying far-field <b>photometric</b> <b>evaluation</b> techniques. The photometric characterization methodologies use computer simulations to characterize visible light and thermal performance of daylighting fixtures. A daylighting fixture is defined to include the boundary and all the components that exist between the admittance plane and exit plane of a daylighting aperture. The fixture concept allows the characterization data {{to be applied to}} daylighting fixtures in any setting. The lack of comprehensive daylighting performance evaluation protocols and basic daylighting component research indicate the need to develop this characterization methodology. This dissertation articulates key weaknesses in current daylighting indicators and performance characterization research, which support the need for additional protocols to characterize daylight, including angular intensity distribution at the point it is admitted into a building and associated thermal gains. The characterization methodology is demonstrated using four lighting software programs to assess louver control components for toplighting. Visible light characterizations addressed i...|$|E

40|$|Expanding {{upon the}} work of Way and Srivastava 2006 we {{demonstrate}} how the use of training sets of comparable size continue to make Gaussian process regression (GPR) a competitive approach to that of neural networks and other least-squares fitting methods. This is possible via new large size matrix inversion techniques developed for Gaussian processes (GPs) {{that do not require}} that the kernel matrix be sparse. This development, combined with a neural-network kernel function appears to give superior results for this problem. Our best fit results for the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) Main Galaxy Sample using u,g,r,i,z filters gives an rms error of 0. 0201 while our results for the same filters in the luminous red galaxy sample yield 0. 0220. We also demonstrate that {{there appears to be a}} minimum number of training-set galaxies needed to obtain the optimal fit when using our GPR rank-reduction methods. We find that morphological information included with many photometric surveys appears, for the most part, to make the <b>photometric</b> redshift <b>evaluation</b> slightly worse rather than better. This would indicate that most morphological information simply adds noise from the GP point of view in the data used herein. In addition, we show that cross-match catalog results involving combinations of the Two Micron All Sky Survey, SDSS, and Galaxy Evolution Explorer have to be evaluated in the context of the resulting cross-match magnitude and redshift distribution. Otherwise one may be misled into overly optimistic conclusions.

40|$|Abstract—Local feature {{detection}} and description {{are widely used}} for object recognition such as augmented reality applications. There {{have been a number}} of evaluations and comparisons between feature detectors and descriptors and between their different implementations. Those evaluations are carried out on random sets of image structures. However, feature detectors and descriptors respond differently depending on the image structure. In this paper, we evaluate the overall performance of the most efficient detectors and descriptors in terms of speed and efficiency. The evaluation is carried out on a set of images of different object classes and structures with different geometric and <b>photometric</b> deformations. This <b>evaluation</b> would be useful for detecting the most suitable detector and descriptor for a particular object recognition application. Moreover, multi-object applications such as digilog books could change the detector and descriptor used based on the current object. From the results, it has been observed that some detectors perform better with certain object classes. Differences in performance of the descriptors vary with different image structures.

40|$|Context. Since {{the advent}} of modern {{multiband}} digital sky surveys, photometric redshifts (photo-z's) have become relevant if not crucial to many fields of observational cosmology, from the characterization of cosmic structures, to weak and strong lensing. Aims. We describe an application to an astrophysical context, namely the <b>evaluation</b> of <b>photometric</b> redshifts, of MLPQNA, a machine learning method based on Quasi Newton Algorithm. Methods. Theoretical methods for photo-z's evaluation {{are based on the}} interpolation of a priori knowledge (spectroscopic redshifts or SED templates) and represent an ideal comparison ground for neural networks based methods. The MultiLayer Perceptron with Quasi Newton learning rule (MLPQNA) described here is a computing effective implementation of Neural Networks for the first time exploited to solve regression problems in the astrophysical context and is offered to the community through the DAMEWARE (DAta Mining & ExplorationWeb Application REsource) infrastructure. Results. The PHAT contest (Hildebrandt et al. 2010) provides a standard dataset to test old and new methods for <b>photometric</b> redshift <b>evaluation</b> and with a set of statistical indicators which allow a straightforward comparison among different methods. The MLPQNA model has been applied on the whole PHAT 1 dataset of 1984 objects after an optimization of the model performed by using as training set the 515 available spectroscopic redshifts. When applied to the PHAT 1 dataset, MLPQNA obtains the best bias accuracy (0. 0006) and very competitive accuracies in terms of scatter (0. 056) and outlier percentage (16. 3 %), scoring as the second most effective empirical method among those which have so far participated to the contest. MLPQNA shows better generalization capabilities than most other empirical methods especially in presence of underpopulated regions of the Knowledge Base.

40|$|Investigations of the {{interstellar}} environment around Wolf-Rayet (WR) stars have {{lead to the}} discovery of extended shells of gas and dust 50 - 100 pc in diameter in the lines of sight toward three WR stars. In this paper, several origins for these extended shells are discussed. While positional coincidences cannot be excluded, the locations of the WR stars near the projected centers of the shells, the detection of only shortward-shifted, high-velocity UV absorption line components in their IUE spectra, plus commonality of some WR star properties which are rare in the general WR star population suggest some casual connections between the WR stars and formation of interstellar shells. To access whether the high-velocity UV interstellar absorption lines are a frequent phenomenon related to WR stellar winds, we present a survey of such features in all WR stars observed with IUE through 1991. Of 35 stars studied, only four are found to have components with velocity displacements greater than 45 km/s which are not attributable to previously identified OB association superbubbles. The means a surprising 82 % of non-OB association WR stars show no evidence of high-velocity gas in their lines of sight at IUE's spectral resolution, suggesting that high-velocity interstellar absorption lines are not a common consequence of Wolf-Rayet star stellar winds alone. We review the properties of three WR stars (HD 50896, HD 96548, and HD 192163) which may reside inside extended interstellar shells and find that they are similar in terms of spectral class (WN 5 - 8), presence of an optical ring nebula, and reported <b>photometric</b> variability. <b>Evaluation</b> of possible origins of the extended shells suggests these three stars are in a post X-ray binary stage of high-mass binary star evolution. If this is correct, then the large interstellar shells detected might be evidence of either supernova remnant shells generated by the explosion of the binary's primary star, or non-conservative mass transfer during a Roche Lobe overflow stage of the binary after the supernova explosion. In either of these cases the bright optical ring nebulae associated with these three WR stars may signify recent Roche Lobe overflows consistent with spectroscopic abundance analysis...|$|R
