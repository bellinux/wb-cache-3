40|$|Global {{changes in}} food demand {{resulting}} from {{population growth and}} more meat-intensive diets require an increase in global protein crop production, not least as climate change and increasing scarcity of fresh water could restrict future production. In contrast to many other regions, in Finland climate change could open new opportunities through enabling more diverse cropping systems. It is justified to re-enquire whether the extent and intensity of protein crop production are optimized, resources are used efficiently and sustainably, cropping systems are built to be resilient and whether ecological services that <b>protein</b> <b>crops</b> provide are utilized appropriately. This paper aims to analyze in a descriptive manner the biological grounds for sustainable intensification of protein crop production in Finland. Production security is considered by evaluating the effects of and likelihood for constraints typical for northern conditions, examining historical and recent crop failures and estimating ecosystem services that more extensive introduction of <b>protein</b> <b>crops</b> potentially provide for northern cropping systems now and in a changing climate. There is an evident potential to expand protein crop production sustainably {{to a couple of}} times its current area. In general, variability in protein yields tends to be higher for <b>protein</b> <b>crops</b> than spring cereals. Nevertheless, protein yield variability was not necessarily systematically higher for Finland, when compared with other European regions, as it was for cereals. <b>Protein</b> <b>crops</b> provide significant ecological services that further support their expanded production. By this means protein self-sufficiency remains unrealistic, but increased production of <b>protein</b> <b>crops</b> can be achieved. The expansion of rapeseed and legumes areas also seems to be economically feasible. From the economic viewpoint, an increase in domestic protein supply requires that farmers have economic incentives to a) cultivate protein-rich crops instead of cereals, and b) use them as animal feed instead of imported sources of protein. Environmental sustainability is an argument to justify economic support for protein-rich crops and thus increase their cultivation...|$|E

40|$|Grain legumes, {{together}} with quinoa and amaranth (pseudocereals) {{and other crops}} are attractive candidates to satisfy the growing demand for plant protein production worldwide for food and feed. Despite their high value, many <b>protein</b> <b>crops</b> have not been adequately assessed and numerous species are underutilized. Special attention has {{to be paid to}} genetic diversity and landraces, and to the key limiting factors affecting yield, including water deficiency and other abiotic and biotic stresses, in order to obtain stable, reliable and sustainable crop production through the introduction and local adaptation of genetically improved varieties. Legumes, the main <b>protein</b> <b>crops</b> worldwide, contribute to the sustainable improvement of the environment due to their ability to fix nitrogen and their beneficial effects on the soil. They {{play a key role in}} the crop diversification and sustainable intensification of agriculture, particularly in light of new and urgent challenges, such as climate change and food security. In addition, the role of legumes in nutrition has been recognized as a relevant source of plant protein, {{together with}} other benefits for health. Chapters dealing with common bean, lupine, soybean, lentil, cowpea and Medicago are included in this book. Most contributions deal with legumes, but the significant number of papers on different aspects of quinoa gives an idea of the increasing importance of this protein crop. Pseudocereals, such as quinoa and amaranth, are good sources of proteins. Quinoa and amaranth seeds contain lysine, an essential amino acid that is limited in other grains. Nutritional evaluations of quinoa indicate that it constitutes a source of complete protein with a good balance among all of the amino acids needed for human diet, and also important minerals, vitamins, high quality oils and flavonoids. Other <b>protein</b> <b>crops</b> also included in this book are hemp, cotton and cereals (maize, wheat and rice). Although cereals protein content is not high, their seeds are largely used for human consumption. In this book are included articles dealing with all different aspects of <b>protein</b> <b>crops,</b> including nutritional value, breeding, genetic diversity, biotic and abiotic stress, cropping systems or omics, which may be considered crucial to help provide the plant proteins of the future. Overall, the participation of 169 authors in 29 chapters in this book indicates an active scientific community in the field, which appears to be an encouraging reflect of the global awareness of the need for sustainability and the promising future of proteins crops as a source of food and feed.

40|$|The aim {{of organic}} farming husbandry, {{is to be}} entirely based on an {{organically}} produced diet. Shortage of organically produced <b>protein</b> <b>crops</b> for production of concentrates supplying the European market, and a contemporary ban {{on the use of}} fishmeal for ruminants in the EU has lead to an increased need for organically produced feedstuffs for production of concentrates in Norwegian organic husbandry. Pea is the most common cultivated protein-rich crop in organic agriculture in Norway. For ruminants, peas has a low bypass protein content compared to common protein supplements such as rape meal and soybean meal. Other high-protein crops with complementary properties are therefore needed to meet the demand in feed quality for ruminants, pigs and poultry. Oilseed crops, which are rich in both fat and protein, will become of considerable interest if problems related to their cultivation are solved. Currently, our experience with oilseed crops in organic agriculture is limited. In a four year research project "Organic protein feed and edible oil from oilseed crops" this experience will be extended and the feed quality of organically grown <b>protein</b> <b>crops</b> like rape, turnip rape and camelina will be evaluated.

40|$|Europe {{has become}} heavily {{dependent}} on soya bean imports, entailing trade agreements and quality standards that do not satisfy the European citizen’s expectations. White, yellow and narrow-leafed lupins are native European legumes that can become true alternatives to soya bean, given their elevated and high-quality protein content, potential health benefits, suitability for sustainable production, and acceptability to consumers. Nevertheless, lupin cultivation in Europe remains largely insufficient to guarantee a steady supply to the food industry, which in turn must innovate to produce attractive lupin-based protein-rich foods. Here, we address {{different aspects of the}} food supply chain that should be considered for lupin exploitation as a high-value protein source. Advanced breeding techniques are needed to provide new lupin varieties for socio-economically and environmentally sustainable cultivation. Novel processes should be optimized to obtain high-quality, safe lupin protein ingredients, and marketable foods need to be developed and offered to consumers.
