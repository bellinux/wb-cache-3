5|$|Thanks to {{the thick}} {{straight}} wing the Thunderjet rapidly reached its Mach 0.82 limitation at full throttle and low altitude. The aircraft had sufficient power to fly faster, but exceeding the Mach limit at low altitudes {{resulted in a}} violent <b>pitch-up</b> and structural failure causing the wings to break off. Above 15,000ft (4,600m), the F-84 could be flown faster but {{at the expense of}} severe buffeting. Fortunately, the airspeed was sufficiently easy to control to make safe dive bombing from 10,000ft (3,000m) possible. The top speed limitation proved troublesome against Soviet Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-15s in Korea. Slower than the MiG, the F-84 was also unable to turn tightly with a maximum instantaneous-turn load of only 3Gs followed by rapid loss of airspeed. One F-84E pilot credited with two MiG kills achieved his second victory by intentionally flying his aircraft into <b>pitch-up.</b> The MiGs chasing him were unable to follow the violent maneuver and one crashed into the ground. Luckily for the F-84E pilot, the aircraft did not disintegrate but the airframe did suffer heavy warping. The F-84 was a stable gun platform and the computing gunsight aided in accurate gunnery and bombing. Pilots praised the aircraft for Republic's legendary ruggedness.|$|E
5|$|Experiments {{showed the}} need for {{only a small number}} of design changes, mainly {{involving}} the wing profile and positioning. To improve high-alpha performance, the leading edge of the wing was drooped, especially on outer sections, a dog-tooth was introduced at about half-span to control spanwise flow, and the entire wing given a slight negative camber which helped control trim drag and <b>pitch-up.</b> The area rule principle, made public in 1952, was also applied to the design. This resulted in several changes including the addition of a tailcone, sharpening the radar nose profile, thinning the intake lips, and reducing the cross-sectional area of the fuselage below the canopy.|$|E
5|$|According to the {{official}} investigation conducted by the Bureau d'Enquêtes et d'Analyses pour la Sécurité de l'Aviation Civile (BEA), the crash {{was caused by a}} metallic strip that fell from a Continental Airlines DC-10 that had taken off minutes earlier. This fragment punctured a tyre on Concorde's left main wheel bogie during take-off. The tyre exploded, and a piece of rubber hit the fuel tank, which caused a fuel leak and led to a fire. The crew shut down engine number 2 in response to a fire warning, and with engine number 1 surging and producing little power, the aircraft was unable to gain altitude or speed. The aircraft entered a rapid <b>pitch-up</b> then a violent descent, rolling left and crashing tail-low into the Hôtelissimo Les Relais Bleus Hotel in Gonesse.|$|E
25|$|A unique {{feature of}} the Thunderceptor was its unusual inverse tapered wing, in which the chord length {{increased}} along the wing span from the root to the tip, the opposite of conventional swept wing designs. This {{was an attempt to}} address the problem of <b>pitch-up,</b> a potentially deadly phenomenon that plagued early high-speed models. The Thunderceptor's design meant the entire wing stalled smoothly, more like a straight-wing design.|$|E
25|$|Despite SAC's loss of interest, the {{aircraft}} {{attracted the attention}} of Tactical Air Command (TAC), and the F-101 was reconfigured as a fighter bomber, intended to carry a single nuclear weapon for use against tactical targets such as airfields. With the support of TAC, testing was resumed, with Category II flight tests beginning in early 1955. A number of problems were identified during development, with many of these fixed. The aircraft had a dangerous tendency toward severe <b>pitch-up</b> at high angle of attack that was never entirely solved. Around 2,300 improvements were made to {{the aircraft}} in 1955–56 before full production was resumed in November 1956.|$|E
25|$|On 2 June 2013, {{investigators}} from the Ministry of Transport and Civil Aviation of Afghanistan confirmed the load shift hypothesis {{as the starting}} point: three armoured vehicles and two mine-sweeping vehicles, totalling 80 tons of weight, had not been properly secured. At least one armoured vehicle had broken loose on takeoff and rolled backwards, slamming into the airplane's rear bulkhead, puncturing the bulkhead and knocking out the Cockpit Voice Recorder and Flight Data Recorder. This also crippled hydraulic systems 1 and 2 and damaged the horizontal stabilizer components - most notably the jackscrew, which rendered the airplane uncontrollable. Control of the aircraft was therefore lost, with the abnormal <b>pitch-up</b> rotation, stall, and crash to the ground ensuing. The damage to the tail controls and hydraulic systems {{made it impossible for}} the crew to regain control of the aircraft.|$|E
500|$|The RAF later {{received}} Hunters {{equipped with}} an improved Avon engine. The Avon 203 produced 10,000lbf (44.48kN) of thrust and was fitted to XF833, which became the first Hunter F.6. Some other revisions on the F.6 included a revised fuel tank layout, the centre fuselage tanks being replaced by new ones in the rear fuselage; the [...] "Mod 228" [...] wing, which has a distinctive [...] "dogtooth" [...] leading edge notch to alleviate the <b>pitch-up</b> problem; and four [...] "wet" [...] hardpoints, finally giving the aircraft a good ferry range. The Hunter F.6 was given the company designation Hawker P.1099.|$|E
500|$|The FLCC further {{incorporates}} limiters governing {{movement in}} the three main axes based on attitude, airspeed and angle of attack (AOA); these prevent control surfaces from inducing instability such as slips or skids, or a high AOA inducing a stall. The limiters also prevent maneuvers that would exert more than a 9 g load. Flight testing has revealed that [...] "assaulting" [...] multiple limiters at high AOA and low speed can result in an AOA far exceeding the 25° limit, colloquially referred to as [...] "departing"; this causes a deep stall; a near-freefall at 50° to 60° AOA, either upright or inverted. While {{at a very high}} AOA, the aircraft's attitude is stable but control surfaces are ineffective; the pitch limiter locks the stabilators at an extreme <b>pitch-up</b> or pitch-down attempting to recover, this can be overridden so the pilot can [...] "rock" [...] the nose via pitch control to recover.|$|E
2500|$|Another control problem {{stemmed from}} {{handling}} {{characteristics of the}} swept wing at high angles of attack. As the aircraft approached stall speeds, loss of lift on {{the tips of the}} wings caused a violent <b>pitch-up.</b> This particular phenomenon (which could easily be fatal at low altitude where there was insufficient time to recover) became known as the [...] "Sabre dance".|$|E
2500|$|While {{the plane}} was {{climbing}} through , the captain's airspeed indicator read [...] [...] The autopilot, which was taking its air speed information from the same equipment that was providing faulty readings to the captain's ASI, increased the <b>pitch-up</b> attitude and reduced power to lower the plane's airspeed. The co-pilot's ASI read [...] and decreasing, yet the aircraft started to give multiple contradictory warnings that it was flying too fast, including rudder ratio, Mach airspeed, and overspeed lights and sounds.|$|E
2500|$|The {{first of}} the Type 544s serving as prototypes for the later {{production}} series flew on 19 January 1956. The aircraft evolved more with the third Type 544 incorporating different aerodynamic changes and a stronger airframe for the new low level role - to quote Flight; [...] "To permit uninhibited manoeuvring in thick turbulent air at low levels while carrying heavy loads of strike weapons, the structure is extremely sturdy". Various aerodynamic [...] "fixes" [...] to try and counter <b>pitch-up</b> effects at high speed and altitude included flared-out wing tips and wing fences. The tailplane was also changed from dihedral to anhedral. The combined modifications led to the final Type 544 being considered the [...] "production standard". The first production Scimitar flew on 11 January 1957.|$|E
2500|$|Initial {{enthusiasm for}} the {{aircraft}} was dampened by several problems, the most alarming inherited from MiG-15/MiG-17 was the danger of mid-air tank implosions when {{more than half of}} the fuel had been used - the leaking fuel of the crushed fuselage fuel tanks located between the engines would then ignite, leading to a fatal explosion. Furthermore, deployment of air-brakes at high speeds caused a high-g <b>pitch-up,</b> elevators lacked authority at supersonic speeds, and the aircraft possessed a high landing speed of [...] Absence of a two-seat trainer version slowed pilot transition to the type. Handling problems were addressed with the second prototype, SM-9/2, which added a third ventral air-brake and introduced all-moving tail-planes with a damper to prevent pilot-induced oscillations (PIO) at subsonic speeds, flying for the first time on 16 September 1954, and entering initial production as the MiG-19.|$|E
2500|$|The {{new design}} was {{considerably}} larger, carrying {{three times the}} initial fuel load and designed around larger, more powerful Pratt & Whitney J57 turbojets. The greater dimensions of the J57 engines required modifications to the engine bays, and modification to the intakes to allow a larger amount of airflow to the engine. The new intakes were also designed to be more efficient at higher Mach numbers. In order to increase aerodynamic efficiency, reduce structural weight and alleviate <b>pitch-up</b> phenomena recently identified in flight testing of the Douglas D-558-2 Skyrocket, an aircraft with a control surface configuration similar to the XF-88, the horizontal tail was relocated {{to the top of}} the vertical stabilizer, giving the F-101 its signature [...] "T-tail". In late 1952, the mission of the F-101 was changed from [...] "penetration fighter" [...] to [...] "strategic fighter", which entailed equal emphasis on both the bomber escort mission and on nuclear weapons delivery. The new Voodoo mock-up with the reconfigured inlets, tail surfaces, landing gear, and dummy nuclear weapon was inspected by Air Force officials in March 1953. The design was approved, and an initial order for 29 F-101As was placed on 28 May 1953, no prototypes being required as the F-101 was considered a simple development of the XF-88, with the Cook-Cragie production policy, in which initial low-rate production would be used for testing without the use of separate prototypes, chosen instead.|$|E
60|$|There was a queer {{moment of}} doubt whether we shouldn't all smash together. I {{had to make}} up my mind very quickly whether I would <b>pitch-up</b> and drop {{backward}} at once and take my chance of falling undamaged--a poor chance it would have been--in order to avoid any risk to her, or whether I would lift against the wind and soar right over her. This latter I did. She had already got her horse in hand when I came up to her. Her woman's body lay along his neck, and she glanced up as I, with wings aspread, and every nerve in a state of tension, swept over her.|$|E
50|$|A benefit {{obtainable}} from a control-canard is {{the correction}} of <b>pitch-up</b> during a wingtip stall. An all-moving canard {{capable of a}} significant nose-down deflection {{can be used to}} counteract the <b>pitch-up</b> due to the tip stall. As a result, the aspect ratio and sweep of the wing can be optimized without having to guard against <b>pitch-up.</b> A highly loaded lifting canard does not have sufficient spare lift capacity to provide this protection.|$|E
50|$|A {{commonly}} used solution to <b>pitch-up</b> in modern combat aircraft {{is to use}} a control-canard. Another modern solution to <b>pitch-up</b> is the use of slats. When slats are extended they increase wing camber and increase maximum lift coefficient.|$|E
50|$|T-tail {{aircraft}} {{are more susceptible}} to <b>pitch-up</b> at high angles of attack. This <b>pitch-up</b> results from a reduction in the horizontal stabilizer's lifting capability as it passes through the wake of the wing at moderate angles of attack. This can also result in a deep stall condition.|$|E
50|$|Before the <b>pitch-up</b> {{phenomenon}} {{was well}} understood, it plagued all early swept-wing aircraft. In the F-100 Super Sabre it even got its own name, the Sabre dance. In aircraft with high-mounted tailplanes, like the F-101 Voodoo, recovery was especially difficult because the tailplane was placed {{directly in the}} wing wake during the <b>pitch-up,</b> causing deep stall (although the T-tail was meant to prevent <b>pitch-up</b> from starting in the first place). Deployment of the braking parachute and a considerable height above the ground were essential for a chance at recovery.|$|E
50|$|Meanwhile, NACA 145 had {{completed}} 21 contractor flights by Douglas pilots Eugene F. May and William Bridgeman in November 1950. In this jet-and-rocket-propelled craft, Scott Crossfield and Walter Jones began the NACA's investigation of <b>pitch-up</b> lasting from September 1951 well into summer 1953. They flew the Skyrocket {{with a variety}} of wing-fence, wing-slat and leading edge chord extension configurations, performing various maneuvers as well as straight-and-level flying at transonic speeds. While fences significantly aided recovery from <b>pitch-up</b> conditions, leading edge chord extensions did not, disproving wind-tunnel tests to the contrary. Slats (long, narrow auxiliary airfoils) in the fully open position eliminated <b>pitch-up</b> except in the speed range around Mach 0.8 to 0.85.|$|E
50|$|Finally, {{while not}} {{directly}} related to the effects above, it was common during the early jet age to use T-tail designs {{in order to keep the}} aerodynamic surfaces well clear of the jet engine area. In this case it is possible for a <b>pitch-up</b> event to cause the turbulent air behind the wing to flow across the horizontal stabilizer, making it difficult or impossible to apply nose-down pressure to counteract the <b>pitch-up.</b> Aircraft with low-mounted tail surfaces did not suffer from this effect, and in fact improved their control authority as the wing's wake cleared the controls surfaces, flowing above it. This was not always enough to correct for the problem, however; the F-86 continued to suffer from <b>pitch-up</b> in spite of increasing nose-down pressure from the tail surfaces.|$|E
50|$|In aerodynamics, <b>pitch-up</b> is {{a severe}} form of stall in an aircraft. It is {{directly}} related to inherent properties of all swept wings, and seen primarily on those platforms. Unlike conventional low-speed stalls, <b>pitch-up</b> can occur at any speed, and are especially dangerous when they take place in the transonic; at these speeds the aerodynamic loads can become so high as to break up the aircraft, as occurred in 1964 when a F-105 Thunderchief of the USAF Thunderbirds broke up in mid-air.|$|E
5000|$|... the {{autopilot}} logic that enables it {{to continue to}} give <b>pitch-up</b> commands beyond the stall angle, thereby aggravating the stall situation and increasing the crew's difficulties in recovery.|$|E
50|$|Angle {{of attack}} sensors on the {{aircraft}} can also detect when {{the angle of}} attack approaches the attitude known to result in <b>pitch-up</b> and activate devices like the stick shaker to warn the pilot, and the stick pusher which overpowers the pilot and forces {{the nose of the}} aircraft down to a safer angle of attack. Twist or washout built into the wingtips can also alleviate <b>pitch-up.</b> In effect, the angle of attack at the wingtip becomes smaller than elsewhere on the wing, meaning that the inboard portions of the wing will stall first.|$|E
50|$|<b>Pitch-up</b> {{problems}} were first noticed on high-speed test aircraft with swept wings. It {{was a common}} problem on the Douglas Skyrocket, which was used extensively to test the problem.|$|E
5000|$|Godzilla 2000-Godzilla: Final Wars: This roar is {{deep and}} unlike the other roars. It has no middle <b>pitch-up.</b> It {{was used for the}} {{duration}} of the Millennium series, and was never altered.|$|E
50|$|After {{the initial}} <b>pitch-up,</b> the pilot places the {{elevators}} in the neutral position. Failure {{to do this}} will cause the aircraft to continue pitching up during the upright part of the maneuver, and downward in the inverted part, resulting in something resembling a barrel roll. The pilot then applies full aileron, accomplished by moving the stick to either the right or left. As the aircraft rolls about its longitudinal axis, the nose will begin to drop. Upon completing the roll, the nose will usually be 10 to 30 degrees below the horizon, so the pilot will need to <b>pitch-up</b> to return to level flight.|$|E
5000|$|An {{aileron roll}} {{is similar to}} the slow roll, and the two {{maneuvers}} are often confused with each other. However, unlike a slow roll, an aileron roll is performed at the maximum roll rate, and is uncontrolled in the pitch axis. It consists of a constant attitude change during the maneuver; from the initial <b>pitch-up</b> to the plane following a slight corkscrew path as the nose drops, followed by the final <b>pitch-up.</b> If the pilot picks a reference point on the horizon, directly ahead of the plane, the nose will actually appear to trace a shape similar to the letter [...] "D" [...] above this reference point.|$|E
50|$|Plywood-skinned low-set {{tailplane}} and {{fin with}} fabric-covered built-up wooden elevators and rudder {{are at the}} tail end of the fuselage, the elevators fitted with trim tabs, one for longitudinal trim and one to compensate for <b>pitch-up</b> with operation of the airbrakes.|$|E
50|$|The nose {{is raised}} to a nominal 5° - 15° nose up pitch {{attitude}} to increase lift from {{the wings and}} effect liftoff. For most aircraft, attempting a takeoff without a <b>pitch-up</b> would require cruise speeds while still on the runway.|$|E
5000|$|Aileron roll; 360° {{revolution}} {{about the}} longitudinal axis at maximum roll rate. It {{consists of a}} <b>pitch-up</b> followed by a roll which is uncontrolled in the pitch axis, resulting in an initial climb, and then descent to the original altitude.|$|E
50|$|The three {{aircraft}} {{gathered a}} great deal of data about <b>pitch-up</b> and the coupling of lateral (yaw) and longitudinal (pitch) motions; wing and tail loads, lift, drag and buffeting characteristics of swept-wing aircraft at transonic and supersonic speeds; and the effects of the rocket exhaust plume on lateral dynamic stability throughout the speed range. (Plume effects were a new experience for aircraft.) The number three aircraft also gathered information about the effects of external stores (bomb shapes, drop tanks) upon the aircraft's behavior in the transonic region (roughly 0.7 to 1.3 times the speed of sound). In correlation with data from other early transonic research aircraft such as the XF-92A, this information contributed to solutions to the <b>pitch-up</b> problem in swept-wing aircraft.|$|E
50|$|Any {{swept wing}} {{tends to be}} {{unstable}} in the stall, since the rearward end stalls first causing a <b>pitch-up</b> force worsening the stall and making recovery difficult. This effect is more significant with forward sweep because the rearward end is the root and carries greater lift.|$|E
50|$|In the NTSB {{investigation}} report, {{the cause}} was attributed to extreme <b>pitch-up</b> to 14g+ caused {{by the loss of}} the port elevator trim tab due to wear in the trim tab mounts, exacerbated by lock-nuts on the mounting bolts losing their self-locking ability due to use past their normal life.|$|E
50|$|In {{many modern}} {{conventional}} aircraft, {{the center of}} gravity is placed ahead of the center of pressure of the main wing. The wing lift then exerts a pitch-down moment around the centre of gravity, which must be balanced by a <b>pitch-up</b> moment (implying negative lift) from the tailplane. A disadvantage is that it generates trim drag.|$|E
5000|$|As {{the primary}} {{causes of the}} <b>pitch-up</b> problem are due to {{spanwise}} flow and more loading at the tips, measures {{to address these issues}} can eliminate the problem. In early designs these were typically [...] "add-ons" [...] to an otherwise conventional wing planform, but in modern designs {{this is part of the}} overall wing design and normally controlled via the existing high-lift devices.|$|E
5000|$|Another control problem {{stemmed from}} {{handling}} {{characteristics of the}} swept wing at high angles of attack. As the aircraft approached stall speeds, loss of lift on {{the tips of the}} wings caused a violent <b>pitch-up.</b> This particular phenomenon (which could easily be fatal at low altitude where there was insufficient time to recover) became known as the [...] "Sabre dance".|$|E
