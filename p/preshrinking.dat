2500|$|During World War II, elastic waistbands {{and metal}} snaps gave way {{once again to}} button {{fasteners}} due to rubber and metal shortages. Undergarments were harder to find as well, since soldiers abroad had priority to obtain them. By {{the end of the}} war, Jockey and Hanes remained the industry leaders in the US, but Cluett, Peabody and Company made a name for itself when it introduced a <b>preshrinking</b> process called [...] "Sanforization", invented by Sanford Cluett in 1933, which came to be licensed by most major manufacturers.|$|E
40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (pages 45 - 47) The {{object of}} this research was to determine the effectiveness of a domestic microwave oven in the preshrink drying of selected interfacing and underlining fabrics. A comparative study was conducted to determine whether the method of drying (i. e., tumble dry, microwave oven dry, or room-line dry) does significantly affect he dimensional changes which occur in the <b>preshrinking</b> of selected interfacing and underlining woven fabrics. The fabrics for this study were selected as representative of those available to consumers in Southern California. These fabrics included one cotton, one rayon, one polyester, two polyester-cotton; blends, one rayon-polyester bland, and one rayon polyester-goat hair blend. All fabrics were of plain weave construction that did not require ironing when subjected to home laundry processes. Specimens were laundered in four-pound loads according to procedures typical of those used in the home for <b>preshrinking</b> purposes and according to accepted test procedures. Specimens were laundered in four-pound loads according to procedures typical of those used in the home for <b>preshrinking</b> purposes and according to accepted test procedures. Specimens were dried according to their assigned drying procedure [...] tumble dry, microwave oven dry, or room-line dry. Five laundering and drying cycles were carried out. Specimens were measured before laundering and after the first and fifth laundering and drying cycles. The changes in dimensions indicated that in the preshrink drying of selected interfacing and underlining fabrics, the method of drying, whether by tumble dryer, microwave oven, or room-line dry, does significantly affect the dimensional changes which occur. The microwave oven is not recommended for the preshrink drying of fabrics...|$|E
40|$|The {{effect of}} ethanol on the amiloride- and benzamil (Bz) -insensitive salt taste {{receptor}} was {{investigated by the}} measurement of intracellular Na+ activity ([Na+]i) in polarized rat fungiform taste receptor cells (TRCs) using fluorescence imaging and by chorda tympani (CT) taste nerve recordings. CT responses were monitored during lingual stimulation with ethanol solutions containing NaCl or KCl. CT responses were recorded {{in the presence of}} Bz (a specific blocker of the epithelial Na+ channel [ENaC]) or the vanilloid receptor- 1 (VR- 1) antagonists capsazepine or SB- 366791, which also block the Bz-insensitive salt taste receptor, a VR- 1 variant. CT responses were recorded at 23 °C or 42 °C (a temperature at which the VR- 1 variant salt taste receptor activity is maximally enhanced). In the absence of permeable cations, ethanol induced a transient decrease in TRC volume, and stimulating the tongue with ethanol solutions without added salt elicited only transient phasic CT responses that were insensitive to elevated temperature or SB- 366791. <b>Preshrinking</b> TRCs in vivo with hypertonic mannitol (0. 5 M) attenuated the magnitude of the phasic CT response, indicating that in the absence of mineral salts, transient phasic CT responses are related to the ethanol-induced osmotic shrinkage of TRCs. In the presence of mineral salts, ethanol increased the Bz-insensitive apical cation flux in TRCs without a change in cell volume, increased transepithelial electrical resistance across the tongue, and elicited CT responses that were similar to salt responses, consisting of both a transient phasic component and a sustained tonic component. Ethanol increased the Bz-insensitive NaCl CT response. This effect was further enhanced by elevating the temperature from 23 °C to 42 °C, and was blocked by SB- 366791. We conclude that in the presence of mineral salts, ethanol modulates the Bz-insensitive VR- 1 variant salt taste receptor...|$|E

25|$|In the 1920s, {{manufacturers}} shifted emphasis from durability to comfort. Union suit advertisements {{raved about}} patented new designs that {{reduced the number}} of buttons and increased accessibility. Most of these experimental designs had to do with new ways to hold closed the crotch flap common on most union suits and drawers. A new woven cotton fabric called nainsook gained popularity in the 1920s for its durability. Retailers also began selling <b>preshrunk</b> undergarments.|$|R
40|$|The {{relationship}} between cell volume and the neural response to acidic stimuli was investigated by simultaneous measurements of intracellular pH (pH i) and cell volume in polarized fungiform taste receptor cells (TRCs) using 2 ’, 7 ’-bis-(2 -carboxyethyl) - 5 -(and- 6) -carboxyfluorescein (BCECF) in vitro and by rat chorda tympani (CT) nerve recordings in vivo. CT responses to HCl and CO 2 {{were recorded in}} the presence of 1 M mannitol and specific probes for filamentous (F) actin (phalloidin) and monomeric (G) actin (cytochalasin B) under lingual voltage clamp. Acidic stimuli reversibly decrease TRC pH i and cell volume. In isolated TRCs F-actin and G-actin were labeled with rhodamine phalloidin and bovine pancreatic deoxyribonuclease- 1 conjugated with Alexa Fluor 488, respectively. A decrease in pH i shifted the equilibrium from F-actin to G-actin. Treatment with phalloidin or cytochalasin B attenuated the magnitude of the pH i-induced decrease in TRC volume. The phasic part of the CT response to HCl or CO 2 was significantly decreased by <b>preshrinking</b> TRCs with hypertonic mannitol and lingual application of 1. 2 mM phalloidin or 20 �M cytochalasin B with no effect on the tonic part of the CT response. In TRCs first treated with cytochalasin B, the decrease in the magnitude of the phasic response to acidic stimuli was reversed by phalloidin treatment. The pH i-induced decrease in TRC volume induced a flufenamic acid–sensitive nonselective basolateral cation conductance. Channel activity was enhanced at positive lingual clamp voltages. Lingual application of flufenamic acid decreased the magnitude of the phasic part of the CT response to HCl and CO 2. Flufenamic acid and hypertonic mannitol were additive in inhibiting the phasic response. We conclude that a decrease in pH i induces TRC shrinkage through its effect on the actin cytoskeleton and activates a flufenamic acid–sensitive basolateral cation conductance that is involved in eliciting the phasic part of the CT response to acidic stimuli...|$|E
5000|$|In August 1993 {{the group}} {{released}} another EP, Something's Wrong with Our Heroes, and undertook a national tour to support it. Early {{the following year}} Nursery Crimes disbanded.

In 1994 McInnes and Rose formed Shreen, McFarlane compared the two groups [...] "Like Nursery Crimes, Shreen's sound combined melodic pop hooks, incisive guitar riffs, tight harmonies and rapid tempos". Dixon later joined the same group, which disbanded in 1996.|$|R
