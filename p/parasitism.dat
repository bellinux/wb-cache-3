5|$|Regressive theory : Viruses {{may have}} once been small cells that {{parasitised}} larger cells. Over time, genes not required by their <b>parasitism</b> were lost. The bacteria rickettsia and chlamydia are living cells that, like viruses, can reproduce only inside host cells. They lend credence to this theory, as {{their dependence on}} <b>parasitism</b> {{is likely to have}} caused the loss of genes that enabled them to survive outside a cell.|$|E
5|$|The {{cattle egret}} engages in {{low levels of}} brood <b>parasitism,</b> {{and there are a}} few {{instances}} of cattle egret eggs being laid in the nests of snowy egrets and little blue herons, although these eggs seldom hatch. There is also evidence of low levels of intraspecific brood <b>parasitism,</b> with females laying eggs in the nests of other cattle egrets. As much as 30% extra-pair copulations have been noted.|$|E
5|$|The female pallid cuckoo (Cuculus pallidus) {{will lay}} {{eggs in a}} willie wagtail nest, {{although}} the hosts often recognise and eject the foreign eggs, so successful brood <b>parasitism</b> is rare. <b>Parasitism</b> by the fan-tailed (Cacomantis flabelliformis), brush, (C. variolosus), Horsfield's bronze (Chrysococcyx basalis), and shining bronze cuckoo (C. lucidus) has also been reported.|$|E
5|$|Regressive {{hypothesis}} : Viruses {{may have}} once been small cells that parasitised larger cells. Over time, genes not required by their <b>parasitism</b> were lost. The bacteria rickettsia and chlamydia are living cells that, like viruses, can reproduce only inside host cells. They {{lend support to}} this hypothesis, as their dependence on <b>parasitism</b> {{is likely to have}} caused the loss of genes that enabled them to survive outside a cell. This is also called the degeneracy hypothesis, or reduction hypothesis.|$|E
5|$|The idea {{of group}} living has been {{discussed}} by many evolutionists for its costs and benefits. Alexander predicted that the cost to large groups {{is that they are}} more likely to suffer from <b>parasitism,</b> but at the same time, they benefit by defense against predation. This theory is not supported in the case of P.exclamans because the <b>parasitism</b> does not always increase with nest size and the predation rate was independent of size.|$|E
5|$|Although it {{is subject}} to {{predation}} and <b>parasitism,</b> and changes in agricultural practices have caused local population declines, this widespread and abundant species is not threatened globally. Climate change may present a long-term threat, by shifting the necessary Alpine habitat to higher altitudes.|$|E
5|$|An {{outline of}} the origins of the {{parasitic}} life style has been proposed. Epithelial feeding monopisthocotyleans on fish hosts are basal in the Neodermata and were the first shift to <b>parasitism</b> from free living ancestors. The next evolutionary step was a dietary change from epithelium to blood. The last common ancestor of Digenea + Cestoda was monogenean and most likely sanguinivorous.|$|E
5|$|Biological {{control is}} a method of {{controlling}} pests such as insects, mites, weeds and plant diseases using other organisms. It relies on predation, <b>parasitism,</b> herbivory, or other natural mechanisms, but typically also involves an active human management role. It {{can be an important}} component of integrated pest management (IPM) programs.|$|E
5|$|Brood <b>parasitism</b> by brown-headed cowbirds is common, {{with up to}} 25% of Carolina wren nests being {{affected}} in certain regions such as Oklahoma and Alabama. Cowbird <b>parasitism</b> peaks in April at 41%, and is as low as 8% and 0% in July and August, respectively. Female cowbirds sometimes eject Carolina wren eggs before laying their own, and even if host eggs are retained, the size of cowbird eggs negatively affect the hatching success of wren eggs. As a result, cowbirds may {{have a significant impact}} on the reproductive success of wrens. The feeding rate for cowbird nestlings is higher than wren feeding rates, and some have been raised to independence. This also can be detrimental to the survival of wren nestlings. A rare instance of brood-parasitism by a house finch has been recorded. The rate of brood <b>parasitism</b> is thought to be lower in more natural and concealed nesting locations. Body parasites such as the larvae of blowflies feed on nestlings and the blood loss weakens nestlings. Fellow species of wren such as Bewick's wren and the winter wren compete for nesting locations and food, respectively.|$|E
5|$|Helpers, {{offspring}} {{from the}} previous brood, have sometimes been noted to assist in feeding the fledglings at the nest of their parents. Cases of brood <b>parasitism</b> by the Asian koel have been noted. An average breeding success of 44% has been noted with {{the main cause of}} fledgling mortality being shortage of insect food which in turn was dependent on rainfall.|$|E
5|$|Insects {{are mostly}} soft bodied, fragile and almost defenseless {{compared}} to other, larger lifeforms. The immature stages are small, move slowly or are immobile, {{and so all}} stages are exposed to predation and <b>parasitism.</b> Insects then {{have a variety of}} defense strategies to avoid being attacked by predators or parasitoids. These include camouflage, mimicry, toxicity and active defense.|$|E
5|$|North American {{predators and}} parasitoids can {{occasionally}} cause high emerald ash borer mortality, but generally offer only limited control. Mortality due to native woodpeckers is variable. <b>Parasitism</b> by parasitoids such as Atanycolus cappaerti can be high, but overall such control is generally low.|$|E
5|$|Reproductive mimicry {{occurs when}} {{the actions of the}} dupe {{directly}} aid in the mimic's reproduction. This is common in plants with deceptive flowers that do not provide the reward they seem to offer. Other forms of mimicry have a reproductive component, such as Vavilovian mimicry involving seeds, and brood <b>parasitism,</b> which can also involve aggressive mimicry.|$|E
5|$|Storm petrels seem to {{be largely}} free of blood parasites, even when in close {{proximity}} to carrier species such as the yellow-legged gull. It has been suggested that seabird species with long incubation periods and long lives have well-developed immune systems that prevent serious blood <b>parasitism.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{black-necked grebe}} is {{socially}} monogamous. Conspecific or intraspecific brood <b>parasitism,</b> where the female lays {{eggs in the}} nest of others of their own species is common with nearly 40% of nests being parasitized on average. In terms of territory, this grebe will only defend its nest site.|$|E
5|$|The {{most common}} predators of greater noctule bat are barn owl (Tyto alba) and Eurasian eagle-owl (Bubo bubo). The greater noctule bat {{generally}} leaves its roost to forage {{after it is}} already completely dark outside, this coincides with the general time that the two mentioned owl species hunt. There is also some risk to the greater noctule from <b>parasitism</b> between bats.|$|E
5|$|The role of {{cleaning}} symbioses has been debated by biologists for over thirty years. Some believe that cleaning represents selfless co-operation, essentially pure mutualism, increasing the fitness of both individuals. Others such as Robert Trivers hold that it illustrates mutual selfishness, reciprocal altruism. Others again believe that cleaning behaviour is simply one-sided exploitation, {{a form of}} <b>parasitism.</b>|$|E
5|$|Although it {{is subject}} to {{predation}} and <b>parasitism,</b> the main threat to this species is changes in agricultural practices, which have led to population decline, some local extirpation, and range fragmentation in Europe; however, it is not threatened globally. The red-billed chough, which derived its common name from the jackdaw, was formerly associated with fire-raising, and has links with Saint Thomas Becket and Cornwall. The red-billed chough has been depicted on postage stamps of a few countries, including the Isle of Man, with four different stamps, and The Gambia, where the bird does not occur.|$|E
5|$|Biological control {{can affect}} {{biodiversity}} through predation, <b>parasitism,</b> pathogenicity, competition, or other attacks on non-target species. An introduced control {{does not always}} target only the intended pest species; it can also target native species. In Hawaii during the 1940s parasitic wasps were introduced to control a lepidopteran pest and the wasps are still found there today. This may {{have a negative impact}} on the native ecosystem, however, host range and impacts need to be studied before declaring their impact on the environment.|$|E
5|$|Blackcaps {{are caught}} by Eurasian sparrowhawks in the {{breeding}} range, and by Eleonora's falcons on migration. Eurasian jays and Eurasian magpies take eggs and young, as do mammals such as stoats, weasels and squirrels. Domestic cats {{are the most}} important predator, possibly killing up to 10% of blackcaps. Blackcaps are occasionally hosts of the common cuckoo, a brood parasite. The level of <b>parasitism</b> is low because the cuckoo's eggs are often rejected. Blackcaps have evolved adaptations which make it difficult for the parasitic species to succeed, despite the cuckoo's tendency to lay eggs which resemble those of their host. Blackcaps are good at spotting alien eggs, and their own eggs are very alike within a clutch, making it easier to spot the intruder. There is, however, considerable variation between different clutches, making it harder for the cuckoo to convincingly mimic a blackcap egg. The open habitat and cup nest of the warbler make it a potential target for the cuckoo; it may have experienced much higher levels of <b>parasitism</b> in the past, and countermeasures would have spread rapidly once they evolved.|$|E
5|$|Cnidarians feed {{in several}} ways: predation, {{absorbing}} dissolved organic chemicals, filtering food particles {{out of the}} water, obtaining nutrients from symbiotic algae within their cells, and <b>parasitism.</b> Most obtain {{the majority of their}} food from predation but some, including the corals Hetroxenia and Leptogorgia, depend almost completely on their endosymbionts and on absorbing dissolved nutrients. Cnidaria give their symbiotic algae carbon dioxide, some nutrients, a place in the sun and protection against predators.|$|E
5|$|Data on nesting {{success rates}} is limited; {{one study of}} 35 nests found 28 (80%) {{resulted}} in the fledging {{of at least one}} young currawong. Causes of failure included nest collapse by gale-force winds and rain, and harassment and nest raiding by pied currawongs. The incidence of brood <b>parasitism</b> is uncertain. A pair of grey currawongs have been observed feeding a channel-billed cuckoo (Scythrops novaehollandiae) chick on one occasion.|$|E
5|$|Despite their {{apparent}} simplicity, {{bacteria can}} form complex associations with other organisms. These symbiotic associations {{can be divided}} into <b>parasitism,</b> mutualism and commensalism. Due to their small size, commensal bacteria are ubiquitous and grow on animals and plants exactly as they will grow on any other surface. However, their growth can be increased by warmth and sweat, and large populations of these organisms in humans are the cause of body odour.|$|E
5|$|Host-parasite mimicry is a {{situation}} where a parasite mimics its own host. As with mimicry of the female sex outlined previously, only two species are involved, the model and mimic being of the same species. Brood <b>parasitism,</b> a form of kleptoparasitism where the mother has its offspring raised by another unwitting organism, is one such situation where host-parasite mimicry has evolved. Pasteur terms this form of aggressive-reproductive mimicry Kirbyan mimicry, after the English entomologist William Kirby.|$|E
5|$|Host-{{parasite}} mimicry is a {{two species}} system where a parasite mimics its own host. Cuckoos are a canonical example of brood <b>parasitism,</b> {{a form of}} kleptoparasitism where the mother has its offspring raised by another unwitting organism, cutting down the biological mother's parental investment in the process. The ability to lay eggs that mimic the host eggs is the key adaptation. The adaptation to different hosts is inherited through the female line in so-called gentes (gens, singular). Cases of intraspecific brood <b>parasitism,</b> where a female lays in conspecific's nest, {{as illustrated by the}} goldeneye duck (Bucephala clangula), do not represent a case of mimicry. Another example is that of chemical mimicry, in which the parasitic butterfly Phengaris rebeli, which parasitizes the ant species Myrmica schencki by releasing chemicals that fool the worker ants to believe that the caterpillar larvae are ant larvae, and enable the P. rebeli larvae to be brought directly into the M. schencki nest. Parasitic (cuckoo) bumblebees (formerly Psithyrus, now included in Bombus) resemble their hosts more closely than would be expected by chance, at least in areas like Europe where parasite-host co-speciation is common. However, this is explainable as Müllerian mimicry, rather than requiring the parasite's coloration to deceive the host and thus constitute aggressive mimicry.|$|E
5|$|Mallards are opportunistically {{targeted}} by brood parasites, occasionally having eggs laid in their nests by redheads, ruddy ducks, lesser scaup, gadwalls, northern shovellers, northern pintails, cinnamon teal, common goldeneyes, and other mallards. These eggs are generally accepted when they resemble the eggs {{of the host}} mallard, but the hen may attempt to eject them or even abandon the nest if <b>parasitism</b> occurs during egg laying.|$|E
5|$|Red-billed choughs {{can acquire}} blood parasites such as Plasmodium, but {{a study in}} Spain showed that the {{prevalence}} was less than one percent, and unlikely to affect the life history and conservation of this species. These low levels of <b>parasitism</b> contrast with a much higher prevalence in some other passerine groups; for example a study of thrushes in Russia showed that all the fieldfares, redwings and song thrushes sampled carried haematozoans, particularly Haemoproteus and Trypanosoma.|$|E
5|$|Some {{intraspecific}} brood <b>parasitism</b> occurs, and {{instances of}} unusually {{large numbers of}} eggs in a nest {{may be the result}} of females laying eggs in the nests of their neighbours. Such foreign eggs are sometimes recognised and ejected by females. The house sparrow is a victim of interspecific brood parasites, but only rarely, since it usually uses nests in holes too small for parasites to enter, and it feeds its young foods unsuitable for young parasites. In turn, the house sparrow has once been recorded as a brood parasite of the American cliff swallow.|$|E
5|$|The American robin {{is known}} to be a rejecter of cowbird eggs, so brood <b>parasitism</b> by the brown-headed cowbird is rare. Even when it occurs, the parasite's chick does not {{normally}} survive to fledging. In a study of 105 juvenile robins, 77.1% were infected with one or more species of endoparasite, with Syngamus species the most commonly encountered, found in 57.1% of the birds.|$|E
5|$|The Eurasian {{rock pipit}} {{is also a}} host to the flea Ceratophyllus borealis, and several other flea species in the genera Ceratophyllus and Dasypsyllus. The Eurasian rock pipit can benefit from <b>parasitism</b> of the common {{periwinkle}} Littorina littoria by the castrating trematode Parorchis acanthus. Beaches can become attractive where {{the decline of the}} periwinkle results in more ungrazed algae, with corresponding increases in invertebrates and a greater diversity of smaller Littorina snails as food for the pipits.|$|E
5|$|The Phengaris rebeli is a brood parasite, an {{organism}} that manipulates another organism (the host) {{to raise its}} offspring; in this case, the P. rebeli parasitizes a particular species of ant, the Myrmica schencki. The P. rebeli was first discovered to be a brood parasite when a researcher observed M. schencki ants bringing the P. rebeli larvae back to their own nest. One of the proposed hypotheses for this <b>parasitism</b> was that P. rebeli larvae released chemicals to confuse the ants into believing they were ant larvae.|$|E
5|$|The choughs host bird fleas, {{including}} two Frontopsylla species which are Pyrrhocorax specialist. Other parasites recorded on choughs include a cestode Choanotaenia pirinica, and various species of chewing lice in the genera Brueelia, Menacanthus and Philopterus. Blood parasites such as Plasmodium {{have been found}} in red-billed choughs, but this is uncommon, and apparently does little harm. <b>Parasitism</b> levels are much lower than in some other passerine groups.|$|E
5|$|The main predators of {{the garden}} warbler are Eurasian sparrowhawks and {{domestic}} cats. Some falcons will also take adults, and the Eleonora's falcon hunts the garden warbler and many other small passerines as they migrate across the Mediterranean. Eurasian jays and Eurasian magpies take the eggs and young of warblers, as do mammals such as stoats, weasels and squirrels. The garden warbler is a host of the common cuckoo, a brood parasite. The blackcap has a much lower level of <b>parasitism</b> than its relative because the cuckoo's eggs are often rejected.|$|E
5|$|The {{young of}} a clutch hatch over {{two or three}} days and are brooded until their {{feathers}} develop and eyes open five days after hatching. The young are fed on insects until they fledge 16 to 25, typically 17, days after hatching. After this they are fed for one or two weeks. While feeding nestlings, the female is dominant over the male. Cape sparrows are among the main hosts of brood <b>parasitism</b> by the dideric cuckoo in southern Africa, and sometimes parasitise nests of their own species.|$|E
5|$|Akhmatova {{was widely}} honoured in the USSR and the West. In 1962 she was visited by Robert Frost; Isaiah Berlin tried {{to visit her}} again, but she refused him, worried that her son might be re-arrested due to family {{association}} with the ideologically suspect western philosopher. She inspired and advised a large circle of key young Soviet writers. Her dacha in Komarovo was frequented by such poets as Yevgeny Rein and Joseph Brodsky, whom she mentored. Brodsky, arrested in 1963 and interned for social <b>parasitism,</b> {{would go on to}} win the Nobel Prize in Literature (1987) and become Poet Laureate (1991) as an exile in the U.S.|$|E
5|$|As a countermeasure, {{cultures}} of the nematode Deladenus siricidicola {{have been used as}} biological control to protect trees since the 1980s. This parasite feeds on the mycelia of A.areolatum and is therefore a food competitor of wood wasp larvae. Where S.noctilio larvae are present, the parasite infects and sterilizes the eggs of female wasps, causing them to be infertile. These infertile females lay infected eggs into new trees and thus spread the nematode. This control method has proven to be relatively successful to combat the Sirex–Amylostereum complex. In the Southern Hemisphere, where the technique has been widely employed, reductions of <b>parasitism</b> levels of 70%–100% have been achieved.|$|E
