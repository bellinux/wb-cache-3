We present results from a survey completed by 122 users of Facebook regarding their information disclosure practices and their attitudes about privacy. Based on our data, we develop and evaluate a model for understanding factors that affect how privacy attitudes influence disclosure and discuss implications for social network sites. Our analysis shows {{that the relationship between}} <b>privacy</b> attitudes <b>and</b> certain types of disclosures (those furthering contact) are controlled by <b>privacy</b> policy consumption <b>and</b> <b>privacy</b> behaviors.

5|$|Despite {{the growth}} of the Internet, the {{characteristics}} of local area networks (LANs)--computer networks that do not extend beyond a few kilometers—remain distinct. This is because networks on this scale do not require all the features associated with larger networks and are often more cost-effective and efficient without them. When they are not connected with the Internet, they also have the advantages of <b>privacy</b> <b>and</b> security. However, purposefully lacking a direct connection to the Internet does not provide assured protection from hackers, military forces, or economic powers. These threats exist if there are any methods for connecting remotely to the LAN.|$|E

This article is a review of Internet <b>privacy</b> policies <b>and</b> trust seals of Chinese Websites in Taiwan. This study involves two phases. In the first phase, content analysis was performed on 422 Chinese Websites in Taiwan about the presence {{and scope of the}} <b>privacy</b> policy <b>and</b> trust seals. In the second phase, a quantitative survey was conducted to explore Internet users’ recognition of Internet <b>privacy</b> policies <b>and</b> trust seals, and to examine the influence of Internet <b>privacy</b> policies <b>and</b> trust seals on consumer online purchase decisions. The findings reveal that (1) 50 % of the Websites have provided Internet <b>privacy</b> policy statements, <b>and</b> 70 % of them have adopted Internet trust seals; (2) Internet users would trust a Website that has at least one trust seal, and suggest that the best place to show trust seals is on the Website’s homepage; and (3) the Internet <b>privacy</b> policies <b>and</b> trust seals would positively influence consumer online purchase decisions...|$|R

Instead of educating the public about different subcultures in the gay community, they printed effective posters showing an eye peeping through a keyhole and a family living in a fishbowl. High-profile liberal figures, labor unions, and other large organizations including the Church Council of Greater Seattle opposed Initiative Thirteen. David Estes {{did not have the}} enthusiasm and momentum modeled by Bryant and other communities though his campaign used many of their tactics.

5|$|Another related {{investigation}} {{involved the}} fate of the children of captured pregnant guerrillas, who were given up for adoption by the military junta. An estimated 500 children were involved. The investigation became controversial during the Kirchner administration, as those involved had become adults and some of them refused to participate in DNA testing. One of those cases was the Noble siblings case, involving the adopted sons of Ernestina Herrera de Noble, owner of the Clarín newspaper. The Kirchners advanced a bill in Congress to make the genetic testing of suspected victims mandatory. Although the measure had popular support, critics considered it a breach of the right to <b>privacy,</b> <b>and</b> politically motivated because of a dispute between Kirchner and the Clarín newspaper. The Noble siblings tests in 2011 were negative, and the case was closed in January 2016, after Kirchner left the presidency. Hilario Bacca, a confirmed son of disappeared guerrillas, appealed a judicial ruling that sought to change his name, asking to keep the name he had been using.|$|E

Paul also said that under no circumstances would he be endorsing {{either of the two}} main parties' candidates (McCain– Republican Party, or Obama– Democratic Party) because there were no real differences between them, and because neither of them, if elected, would seek to make the fundamental changes in governance that were necessary. He urged instead that, rather than contribute to the “charade” that the two-party election system had become, the voters support the third-party candidates as a protest vote, to force change in the election process. Later that same day, Paul gave a televised interview with Nader saying much the same again.|$|E
5|$|By 1964, {{membership}} {{had risen}} to 80,000, and the ACLU participated in efforts to expand civil liberties. In the 1960s, the ACLU continued its decades-long effort to enforce {{separation of church and}} state. It defended several anti-war activists during the Vietnam War. The ACLU was involved in the Miranda case, which addressed conduct by police during interrogations, and in the New York Times case, which established new protections for newspapers reporting on government activities. In the 1970s and 1980s, the ACLU ventured into new legal areas, involving the rights of homosexuals, students, prisoners, and the poor. In the twenty-first century, the ACLU has fought the teaching of creationism in public schools and challenged some provisions of anti-terrorism legislation as infringing on <b>privacy</b> <b>and</b> civil liberties. Fundraising and membership spiked after the 2016 election; the ACLU's current membership is more than 1.2 million.|$|E
5|$|In September 2011, the District Court granted Apple's {{motion to}} dismiss for lack of Article III {{standing}} and failure to state a claim, but gave the plaintiffs leave to amend their complaint, thereby not shutting out the claims permanently. The court ruled that without a showing of legal damages compensable under current law, the plaintiffs had not shown they sustained injury in fact by the defendants' actions. The problem facing the plaintiffs is {{the current state of}} electronic privacy law, the issue being that there is no national privacy law that provides for compensatory damages for breach of <b>privacy,</b> <b>and</b> this is the same issue faced by victims of data breaches, as breaches, per se, sustain no legal damages without a showing of actual and measurable harm such as monetary loss. Under U.S. law as of July 2012, it is only when a data breach results in actual loss as defined by applicable law that compensable damages arise. The case remained on the California court's docket as of July 2012.|$|E

40|$|Abstract – Security <b>and</b> <b>privacy</b> {{issues have}} become far more {{critical}} and {{complex in the}} Internet era. Balancing security enhancement <b>and</b> <b>privacy</b> protection remains a key challenge involving both technical and non-technical issues. It is crucial to restructure computer and software engineering curricula to familiarize students with the challenges and opportunities associated with the security <b>and</b> <b>privacy</b> in the Internet era. The key is the balance between security enhancement <b>and</b> <b>privacy</b> protection. This has motivated the project led by the author to bring these real world challenges and opportunities to classroom. This project aims at familiarizing students with the security <b>and</b> <b>privacy</b> issues in this era; the ethical and legal basis for privacy protection; the major challenge of balancing security enhancement <b>and</b> <b>privacy</b> protection; security- <b>and</b> privacy-enhancing technologies; and psychological, social, cultural and physiological influences of security <b>and</b> <b>privacy</b> violation.
