Three different techniques of signal analysis (i. e. rescaled range analysis, phase space method and technique of Shannon entropy) have been applied to the pressure fluctuations obtained during the solids-gas flow of fly ash (median particle diameter 30 μm; particle density 2300 kgm- 3; loose-poured bulk density 700 kgm- 3) through a 69 mm I. D. x 168 m long pipeline and also white powder (median particle diameter 55 μm; particle density 1600 kgm- 3; loose-poured bulk density 620 kgm- 3) through a 69 mm I. D. x 148 m long test rig. Results show that with increasing conveying distance (and conveying velocity {{in the direction of}} flow), there is an overall decrease in the values of Hurst exponent, an increase in the area covered by the <b>phase-space</b> <b>diagram</b> and an increase in the Shannon entropy values, indicating an increase in the degree of complexity of flow mechanism (or turbulence) {{along the length of the}} conveying pipeline. All the three methods have revealed that the closely coupled bends reverse the trend of change of Hurst exponent, <b>phase-space</b> <b>diagram</b> area and Shannon entropy values. This is due to the slowing down of particles caused by the friction of particles along the bend wall resulting in dampened particle turbulence...|$|E

40|$|Using {{the latest}} cosmological {{hydrodynamic}} N-body simulations of groups and clusters, we study how location in phase-space coordinates at $z$$=$$ 0 $ can {{provide information on}} environmental effects acting in clusters. We confirm the results of previous authors showing that galaxies tend to follow a typical path in phase-space as they settle into the cluster potential. As such, different regions of phase-space {{can be associated with}} different times since first infalling into the cluster. However, in addition, we see a clear trend between total mass loss due to cluster tides, and time since infall. Thus we find location in phase-space provides information on both infall time, and tidal mass loss. We find the predictive power of <b>phase-space</b> <b>diagrams</b> remains even when projected quantities are used (i. e. line-of-sight velocities, and projected distances from the cluster). We provide figures that can be directly compared with observed samples of cluster galaxies and we also provide the data used to make them as supplementary data, in order to encourage the use of <b>phase-space</b> <b>diagrams</b> as a tool to understand cluster environmental effects. We find that our results depend very weakly on galaxy mass or host mass, so the predictions in our <b>phase-space</b> <b>diagrams</b> can be applied to groups or clusters alike, or to galaxy populations from dwarfs up to giants.

40|$|We {{conduct a}} {{comprehensive}} numerical {{study of the}} orbital dependence of harassment on early-type dwarfs consisting of 168 different orbits within a realistic, Virgo-like cluster, varying in eccentricity and pericentre distance. We find harassment is only effective at stripping stars or truncating their stellar disks for orbits that enter deep into the cluster core. Comparing to the orbital distribution in cosmological simulations, {{we find that the}} majority of the orbits (more than three quarters) result in no stellar mass loss. We also study the effects on the radial profiles of the globular cluster systems of early-type dwarfs. We find these are significantly altered only if harassment is very strong. This suggests that perhaps most early-type dwarfs in clusters such as Virgo have not suffered any tidal stripping of stars or globular clusters due to harassment, as these components are safely embedded deep within their dark matter halo. We demonstrate that this result is actually consistent with an earlier study of harassment of dwarf galaxies, despite the apparent contradiction. Those few dwarf models that do suffer stellar stripping are found out to the virial radius of the cluster at redshift= 0, which mixes them in with less strongly harassed galaxies. However when placed on <b>phase-space</b> <b>diagrams,</b> strongly harassed galaxies are found offset to lower velocities compared to weakly harassed galaxies. This remains true in a cosmological simulation, even when halos have a wide range of masses and concentrations. Thus <b>phase-space</b> <b>diagrams</b> may be a useful tool for determining the relative likelihood that galaxies have been strongly or weakly harassed.

Allowing for a general continuous pressure p(ρ,a) leads to bounded curvature invariants and a general nonsingular evolution. In this case, the maximum energy density is reached in a finite time and there is no cosmological evolution beyond this point which leaves the big bang singularity inaccessible from a spacetime prospective. The existence of maximum energy density and a general nonsingular evolution is independent of the equation of state and the spacial curvature k. As an example we study the evolution of the equation of state p=ωρ through its <b>phase-space</b> <b>diagram</b> to show the existence of a maximum energy which is reachable in a finite time.

The DBI dark energy model considered here has a scalar field with a nonstandard kinetic energy term, and has potential and brane tension that are power-law functions. The new feature considered here is an interaction between the DBI dark energy and dark matter through a phenomenological interaction between the DBI scalar field and the dark matter fluid. We analyze {{two different types of}} interactions between the DBI scalar field and the dark matter fluid.

We use cosmological simulations, and velocity versus position <b>phase-space</b> <b>diagrams</b> to infer the orbital histories of the cluster galaxies. In particular, we embed a simple analytical description of ram-pressure stripping in the simulations to identify the regions in phase-space where galaxies {{are more likely to}} have been sufficiently stripped of their H I gas to fall below the detection limit of our survey. We find a striking agreement between the model predictions and the observed location of H I-detected and non-detected blue (late-type) galaxies in phase-space, strongly implying that ram-pressure plays a key role in the gas removal from galaxies, and that this can happen during their first infall into the cluster. However, we also find a significant number of gas-poor, red (early-type) galaxies in the infall region of the cluster that cannot easily be explained with our model of ram-pressure stripping alone. We discuss different possible additional mechanisms that could be at play, including the pre-processing of galaxies in their previous environment. Ou...|$|R

This paper addresses the challenging problems of cluttering and overdraw inherent to such visualizations. We generate a 2 x 2 tensor field during line rasterization that encodes the distribution of line orientations through each image pixel. Anisotropic diffusion of a noise texture is then used to generate a dense, coherent visualization of line orientation. In order to represent features of different scales, we employ a multi-resolution representation of the tensor field.

40|$|Statistical {{analysis}} of the orbits of distant Kuiper Belt Objects (KBOs) have led to suggest that an additional planet should reside in the Solar System. According to recent models, the secular action of this body should cause orbital alignment of the KBOs. It was recently claimed that the KBOs concerned by this dynamics are presumably trapped in mean motion resonances with the suspected planet. I reinvestigate here the secular model underlying this idea. The original analysis was done expanding and truncating the secular Hamiltonian. I show that this is inappropriate here, as the series expansion is not convergent. I present a study based on numerical computation of the Hamiltonian with no expansion. I show in <b>phase-space</b> <b>diagrams</b> the existence of apsidally anti-aligned, high eccentricity libration islands that were not present in the original modelling, but that match numerical simulations. These island were claimed to correspond to bodies trapped in mean-motion resonances with the hypothetical planet, and match {{the characteristics of the}} distant KBOs observed. My main result is that regular secular dynamics can account for the anti-aligned particles itself as well as mean-motion resonances. I also perform a semi-analytical study of resonant motion and show that some resonance are actually capable of producing the same libration islands. I discuss then the relative importance of both mechanisms. Comment: Accepted in Astronomy & Astrophysics letter...|$|R
40|$|In this paper, we give an {{elaborate}} and understandable review of traffic cellular automata (TCA) models, {{which are a}} class of computationally efficient microscopic traffic flow models. TCA models arise from the physics discipline of statistical mechanics, having the goal of reproducing the correct macroscopic behaviour based on a minimal description of microscopic interactions. After giving an overview of cellular automata (CA) models, their background and physical setup, we introduce the mathematical notations, show how to perform measurements on a TCA model's lattice of cells, {{as well as how}} to convert these quantities into real-world units and vice versa. The majority of this paper then relays an extensive account of the behavioural aspects of several TCA models encountered in literature. Already, several reviews of TCA models exist, but none of them consider all the models exclusively from the behavioural point of view. In this respect, our overview fills this void, as it focusses on the behaviour of the TCA models, by means of time-space and <b>phase-space</b> <b>diagrams,</b> and histograms showing the distributions of vehicles' speeds, space, and time gaps. In the report, we subsequently give a concise overview of TCA models that are employed in a multi-lane setting, and some of the TCA models used to describe city traffic as a two-dimensional and of cells, or as a road network with explicitly modelled intersections.

40|$|AbstractPast {{failures}} {{to solve the}} riddle of phyllotaxis were {{due in part to}} faulty methods employed in the construction of theories or the assembling of observational data. The following examples of faulty methods are analysed to reveal hidden errors or unwanted consequences: 1) Tait argued that if the numbers of conspicuous left and right spirals are consecutive Fibonacci numbers, then the divergence angle must be between one-third and one-half of a turn. He then concluded that the converse was necessarily true. 2) Schwendener used a force diagram to show that equal and opposite forces were acting at the ends of a line segment AA' in the plane development of a cylindrical surface. He then concluded that the points A and A' were compelled to move apart. 3) Davies and others measured divergence angles on many plants with a given phyllotaxis, and then plotted a frequency distribution of the measured values to show that they cluster about an average value. 4) Richards and others worked exclusively with difficult transcendental equations derived from a disc model of phyllotaxis, although a simple transformation would have converted the transcendental equations into simple algebraic equations. 5) Some investigators overlook the fact that the girth of the stem is a natural unit of lenght for the study of phyllotaxis. Using other units tends to obscure an important functional relationship that is revealed when the natural unit is used. The analysis of these faulty methods is followed by a discussion of a) the importance of using a <b>phase-space</b> <b>diagram</b> and b) how a mathematical model should be understood...|$|E
40|$|The direct {{application}} of fluid system approaches to granular materials oftentimes leads to spectacular failures, e. g. two miscible fluids shaken {{in a container}} rapidly become an homogeneous mixture, while vibrating a device containing two kinds of powders result in extreme segregation. Nevertheless, much can be learned through analogies between these disparate systems. The approach taken in this work {{is to focus on}} adapting concepts from fluid behavior and explore their application in relevant industrial processes involving granular materials [...] -such as mixing/segregation, heat transfer and flowability. We use Particle Dynamics (PD) [...] -a Discrete Element Method [...] -to model transport and flow of granular materials. Adhesion, for example, is commonly found in operations involving fine powders where van der Waals forces start to play an important role. Our PD model, which is capable of simulating dry adhesive interactions, is used to study mixing/segregation. By introducing a characterization tool [...] -the van der Waals Granular Bond Number [...] -the asymptotic mixed/segregated state of the system is analytically predicted. These predictions are most easily summarized by <b>phase-space</b> <b>diagrams</b> which exhibit both mixed and segregated regions. The <b>phase-space</b> <b>diagrams</b> are computationally tested (with PD) by selecting granular materials of different properties so that we explore both mixed and segregated regions. Each of these materials is allowed to reach its asymptotic state in a mixing drum, and this final state is compared to the predictions. Beyond predicting the asymptotic state of a system, the next natural step is to explore the possibility of controlling it. With this purpose, we propose the addition of ``helper" particles that can either promote mixing or segregation. These amphiphilic helper particles [...] -also called Janus particles [...] -act as bridges between the base (non-helper) particles, alternatively promoting mixing in a system that would otherwise segregate (surfactant helpers) or separating a specific kind of particle from a mixture (extractant helpers). Phase space diagrams summarizing these trends are analytically built by comparing the interaction forces in the system: the final state of the system is determined by the interactions that predominate. Again, the predictions are then tested against results obtained by PD simulations of the system including Janus particles, which are further compared to the binary adhesive system that contain no helper particles. The presence of adhesive forces in granular materials can also affect the flowability of a granular material. Glidants [...] -also known as flow aids or conditioners [...] -are frequently added to dry cohesive powders to improve their flow properties and to facilitate their handling. These aids can reduce the inter-particle forces by imposing a physical barrier between host particles but are often identified on a trial-and-error or ad hoc basis. Using our PD model and characterization tools, glidant particles are engineered to improve the flowability properties of a dry cohesive powder. Finally, heat transfer within granular materials is studied by observing the dominant heat transfer mechanisms in the granular bed. Specifically, we examine the conditions necessary to achieve conduction-dominated versus convection-dominated heat transfer and introduce a granular analog of the Peclet number as a means of quantifying the transition. Our experiments consist of PD simulations of rotating tumblers where the granular material is being heated from the walls. When conduction is the dominant mechanism, increasing the mixing rate seems to have a positive impact in the rate of heat transfer; however, under convection-dominated conditions the opposite is often true. In order to further clarify the role of inter-particle mixing, the temperature profiles of the material in the drums are compared to a continuum model for mixing of cohesionless granular materials. Similarities between these two {{are most likely to be}} found when convection is the mechanism that dominates the heat transport. Dimensionless numbers are used to correlate the results obtained for multiple systems and surprising degree of similarity is found when compared to analogous fluid correlations...|$|R
