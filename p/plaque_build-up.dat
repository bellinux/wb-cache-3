30|$|Atherosclerotic plaque {{formation}} and growth in arteries are complex processes hemo-dynamically and mechanically. Some <b>plaques,</b> which are <b>build-ups</b> inside your arteries composed of fat, cholesterol, calcium, and other matters, remain stable throughout an individual’s life, or they become unstable and can grow {{to such a}} size that they pose a health risk from stenosis, which is a partial blockage of the artery, leading to disruption. The rupture of these vulnerable plaques {{is thought to be}} responsible for most fatalities. According to Davies [1], almost 73 % of deaths from myocardial infarction (heart attack) are caused by plaque rupture.|$|R
40|$|Background Practicing good {{oral hygiene}} is pivotal to {{achieving}} superior oral health and {{overall quality of}} life. Controlling the <b>plaque</b> biofilm <b>build-up</b> on tooth surface has been the keystone for prevention of gingival diseases for decades. As gingivitis {{is associated with a}} number of diseases including heart disease, a review of the treatment approaches is conducted to identify a comprehensive set of guidelines for consumers to achieve better oral health. Aim To systematically review the evidence based approaches and evaluate their effectiveness in reducing gingivitis. Methods A search for relevant articles was conducted on PubMed, Medline and Cochrane in May 2014. In addition, the search included articles from journals, research groups and organizations. Results Based on the reviews, powered brushing using Triclosan/copolymer tooth paste was found to have an advantage over manual, with rotation oscillation brushes were proficient in minimizing plaque and gingivitis. Use of Inter-dental brushes was more favourable than flossing alone. Hexiditine (0. 14 %) mouth rinse reduced more plaque compared to Chlorhexidine with no side effects. Conclusion A lifestyle that includes powered brushing using Triclosan based tooth paste, Hexidine mouth rinses after the meals and interdental tooth brushes instead of flossing will reduce gingivitis. Dental professionals need to educate patients on these approaches. Consumers should adopt the combination of these to achieve their health goals. Comprehensive policies aimed at providing fair access to dental care for all people is essential. Government may enact policies that promote cost effective early diagnosis, preventive care and, subsidize dental products that result in better oral health. published_or_final_versionPublic HealthMasterMaster of Public Healt...|$|R
40|$|The success {{reported}} {{for the treatment of}} superficial skin carcinomas by photodynamic therapy with topical application of the photosensitizer precursor 5 -aminolevulinic acid has therapeutic implications for the treatment of other skin disorders. This paper describes the accumulation of the photosensitizing agent protoporphyrin IX in areas of plaque psoriasis by monitoring of the fluorescence emission induced by low-intensity laser excitation at 488 nm. We present results from 15 patients with a total of 42 plaques and show that the characteristic fluorescence emission of protoporphyrin IX increases in intensity within the 6 -h period following application of 5 -aminolevulinic acid, suggesting that there is a potential for superficial photodynamic therapy. The rate of increase and maximum intensity of fluorescence emission was not directly related to the applied quantity of the precursor. The variability of the fluorescence intensity was as great between plaques at different sites on the same patient as between different patients. Also, the effect of plaque occlusion following application appeared insignificant. Although there was only limited enhancement of emission from areas of skin surrounding the <b>plaque,</b> a significant <b>build-up</b> of sensitizer was detected after several days in some areas of psoriasis that received no application...|$|R

Anthony Rosenzweig, a professor of Medicine at Harvard Medical School, found that the increase in <b>plaque</b> <b>build-up</b> in the blood vessels and the impaired ability to form new vessels were associated with a reduction in vascular progenitor cells, which some researchers claim could play a protective role in keeping vascular health.|$|E
50|$|Gingivitis is {{a common}} result of <b>plaque</b> <b>build-up</b> around the gingival tissues.

50|$|When {{this type}} of {{aneurysm}} occurs {{in the area of}} the fossa ovalis, an enlarged pouch is formed. This pouch can protrude into the right atrium or the left atrium. The cause of this aneurysm is the result of abnormal, increased pressure within the heart. Even if the foramen ovale does seal shut, an aneurysm may occur, usually on the side of the right atrium. If the aneurysm stretches too far, it can narrow the opening of the inferior vena cava. This type of aneurysm can be a result of <b>plaque</b> <b>build-up</b> in the arteries from coronary heart disease, as well as diseases of the aortic valve or mitral valve.

5000|$|Claims {{have been}} made that {{electric}} toothbrushes are more effective than manual ones as they are less dependent upon a user's personal brushing technique. Some dentists also claim that they help children with overcoming their fear of the dentist. Independent research finds that most electric toothbrushes are no more effective than manual brushes—assuming that people use a manual toothbrush brush effectively. The rotation-oscillation-models {{have been found to}} be marginally better than manual ones. The research concludes that the way brushing is done, including the amount of time spent, is more important than the choice of brush. For patients with limited manual dexterity or where difficulty exists in reaching rear teeth, however, dentists regard electric toothbrushes as being especially beneficial. A 2014 Cochrane review suggested the effectiveness of electric toothbrushes over manual ones: <b>plaque</b> <b>build-up</b> and gingival inflammation was reduced by 11% and 6% respectively after one to three months of use and after three months of use, the reduction observed was greater - 21% reduction in plaque and 11% reduction in gingival inflammation. [...] In addition, ultrasound from a commercially available ultrasonic toothbrush has been shown to break up dental plaque composed of chains of cariogenic Streptococcus mutans bacteria, destroying their cell walls and removing their methods of attachment to the enamel surface, at a distance of 5mm from the plaque.|$|E

Successful preventive programs and home care procedures clearly depend on the interaction and commitment between the dental professional and the patient.

40|$|Atherogenesis is the {{narrowing}} of arteries due to <b>plaque</b> <b>build-up</b> {{that results in}} cardiovascular disease {{that can lead to}} death. The macrophage lectin-like oxidized LDL receptor- 1 (LOX- 1), also called the oxidized low-density lipoprotein receptor 1 (OLR 1), is currently thought to aid in atherosclerotic disease progression; therefore metabolic studies have potential to both provide mechanistic validation for the role of LOX- 1 in disease progression and provide valuable information regarding biomarker strategies and clinical imaging. One such mechanistic study is the upregulation of LOX- 1 by methylated bacterial DNA and deoxy-cytidylate-phosphate-deoxy-guanylate-DNA (CpG) -DNA exposure. CpG-DNA is known to promote oxidative burst responses in macrophages, due to its direct binding to toll-like receptor 9 (TLR 9) leading to the initiation of an NF-κB mediated immune response. In addition to the upregulation of macrophage LOX- 1 expression, these studies have also examined the macrophage metabolic response to murine LOX- 1 /OLR 1 antibody exposure. Our data suggests the antibody exposure effectively blocks LOX- 1 dependent oxLDL metabolic activation of the macrophage, which was quantified using the multianalyte microphysiometer (MAMP). Using the MAMP to examine metabolic fluctuations during various types of oxLDL exposure, LOX- 1 upregulation and inhibition provide valuable information regarding the role of LOX- 1 in macrophage activation of oxidative burst...|$|E

Despite their inher-ently cross-sectional nature, postmortem studies have enabled the staging of {{the progression of}} both amyloid and tangle pathologies, and, consequently, the development of diagnostic criteria that are now used worldwide. In addition, clinicopathological correlation studies have been crucial to generate hypotheses about the pathophysiology of the disease, by estab-lishing {{that there is a}} continuum between “normal ” aging and AD dementia, and that the amyloid <b>plaque</b> <b>build-up</b> occurs primarily before the onset of cognitive deficits, while neuro-fibrillary tangles, neuron loss, and particularly synaptic loss, parallel the progression of cog-nitive decline.

A project seeking to use imaging technology for health care diagnosis began when the imaging team considered using the VICAR software to analyze X-ray images of soft tissue. With marginal success using X-rays, the team applied the same methodology to ultrasound imagery, which was already digitally formatted. The new approach proved successful for assessing amounts of <b>plaque</b> <b>build-up</b> and arterial wall thickness, direct predictors of heart disease, and the result was a noninvasive diagnostic system with the ability to accurately predict heart health. Medical Technologies International Inc. (MTI) further developed and then submitted the technology to a vigorous review process at the FDA, which cleared the software for public use. The software, patented under the name Prowin, is being used in MTI's patented ArterioVision, a carotid intima-media thickness (CIMT) test that uses ultrasound image-capturing and analysis software to noninvasively identify the risk for the major cause of heart attack and strokes: atherosclerosis.

40|$|Inflammation is the {{mainstay}} of atherosclerosis and is an important governing factor at all stages of the disease process from lesion formation to <b>plaque</b> <b>build-up</b> and final end-stage rupture and thrombosis. An overview of the numerous clinico-epidemiological studies on the association between inflammatory gene polymorphisms and Cardiovascular disease (CVD) and its co-morbidities {{have shown that the}} risk associated with any single genotype is modest while the haplotypes, especially those defined on the basis of tag-SNP approach, have better coverage of the gene and show moderately higher impact on disease risk. Nevertheless, even these associations have been inconsistent with low cross-race repeatability. This has been attributed to many plausible causes such as clinical heterogeneity, sample selection criteria, variable genetic landscapes across different ethnic groups, confounding effect of co-morbidities etc. On the other hand, unbiased studies such as the family-based linkage and case-control based associations that have taken into account, thousands of genotypic markers spanning the whole genome, have had the ability to identify novel genetic loci for coronary artery disease. These studies have shown that many inflammatory genes are involved in the regulation of specific biomarkers of inflammation that collectively contribute to the disease-associated risk. In addition, there appears to be considerable cross talk between the different biochemical and metabolic processes. Therefore, consideration of all these factors can build towards an ‘atherosclerotic bionetwork’ that can refine our quest for developing a robust risk stratification tool for cardiovascular disease...|$|E
40|$|It {{has been}} {{suggested}} that atherosclerotic plaques can be visualized in a panoramic radiograph but this tool is not reliable for systematic screening of patients due to its low sensitivity. This study investigated the potential role for dental practitioners in using an ultra- sound machine to detect carotid artery plaques. 100 subjects completed a survey concerning theirathero-sclerosis risk factors. Bilateral images and digital video clips of the carotid arteries of each person were obtained with a portable high-resolution ultrasound device equipped with an L 38 / 10 - 5 MHz linear-array transducer. Images were subsequently interpreted. We found images suggestive of atherosclerotic <b>plaque</b> <b>build-up</b> in two Caucasian females: one 59 year-old with risk factors including: past smoker, high choles- terol, and family history of atherosclerosis and one 54 year-old with risk factors including: past smoker, overweight, and reported no physical activity. Both individuals were referred to their primary care providers for further assessments. 2 % of the patient adult population may have carotid blockages detectable by ultrasound. The frequency can be as high as 5. 5 % in individuals older than 50. In the dental setting, ultrasound imaging can be used to capture bilateral pictures of the carotid arteries. With these images, at-risk patients may be screened for atherosclerotic plaques that could ultimately form a stroke-causing embolus.

40|$|The thesis {{explores the}} canine oral cavity, namely, the teeth {{and the most}} common dental diseases. Dental injury and disease in dogs is a topic of growing {{interest}} in veterinary science. The theoretical section discusses the anatomy of the head, oral cavity and teeth. It presents general knowledge of veterinary dentistry {{and a list of}} the most common oral cavity diseases. The practical section explores the suitability and the effectiveness of two prevention methods against the build-up of dental plaque, respectively, against the spread of periodontitis. 	Diseases affecting the periodontium are increasingly common in dogs; they are deemed to be the most frequent diseases affecting small animals above five years of age. There are two most common periodontal diseases. The first, gingivitis, is a reversible inflammation of the gum. The second, periodontitis, is essentially irreversible without specialized treatment and often leads to loss of teeth. 	The major criterion for maintaining a healthy oral cavity is prevention. Therefore, two methods of home-based prevention are compared in the practical part of the thesis. First, all patients underwent a full-scale dental treatment in a veterinary centre, that is, a comprehensive ultrasonic cleaning and polishing with dental cleaning paste. Then, ascophyllum nodosum, a seaweed also known as Norwegian kelp, was mixed within the daily food ration of half of the patients. In this way, the teeth were being cleaned passively. The second half of the patients had their teeth cleaned with Orozyme, an enzyme-formula oral hygiene gel for dogs, and this way an active teeth cleaning method was explored. Six weeks after the initial dental treatment, a dental plaque identification test was carried out in a veterinary centre. Statistical analysis of the resulting data did not signal substantial differences between the treatment with Norwegian kelp and that of using the oral gel. A combination of the two techniques is, therefore, recommended as the best prevention strategy against <b>plaque</b> <b>build-up...</b>|$|E
40|$|Atherosclerosis is an {{underlying}} cause {{of two of}} the leading causes of death in the world, heart attacks and strokes. It is a chronic inflammatory disease characterized by <b>plaque</b> <b>build-up</b> in large and medium arteries. During disease progression, monocytes in the blood invade the arterial wall, where they can differentiate into macrophages and dendritic cells. Together, these cells phagocytose lipids, clear apoptotic cell debris, present antigen to T cells, and produce pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines. Both monocyte recruitment to the plaque and macrophage function within the plaque require cell motion. The purpose of this work is to study monocyte and macrophage movement in the context of atherosclerosis. First, the mechanism of how the atypical chemokine receptor Duffy Antigen / Receptor for Chemokines (DARC) influences the progression of atherosclerosis is investigated. DARC alters the localization of chemokines and it was thought that through this it could influence cell recruitment to the arteria wall. It was confirmed that the absence of DARC does promote plaque formation, but a molecular mechanism of action was not discovered. Next, to study myeloid cell motion more directly, I developed a system for imaging fluorescent leukocytes in atherosclerotic arteries in vivo. The major challenge in intravital imaging of large arteries is the motion artifacts due to the expansion of the arterial wall with the heartbeat. This new system utilizes cardiac triggering and novel image post-processing algorithms to remove these motion artifacts and allow for cell motion quantification. Apoe-/- Cx 3 cr 1 GFP/+ Cd 11 cYFP mice were generated to visualize labeled monocytes and macrophages. Monocytes were observed patrolling the endothelium of atherosclerotic arteries and the motion characteristics were quantified. Macrophages were seen actively probing their local environment as well as migrating through the plaque. Finally, these macrophages were extensively phenotyped by cell surface markers to link observed motion to known subsets and function. Supplemental videos include a demonstration of the improvement in movie quality with cardiac triggering and image post-processing, examples movies of monocytes patrolling atherosclerotic arteries and macrophages migrating within the plaque and an example 3 D reconstruction of atherosclerotic plaque acquired in vivo. Supplemental SNP analysis of the mice used in this work is also provided...|$|E
40|$|Coronary {{artery disease}} (CAD) is a {{condition}} in which the blood supply to the myocardium is partially or completely blocked due to <b>plaque</b> <b>build-up</b> in the artery wall. Myocardial SPECT imaging is a commonly used technique to assess the blood flow to the myocardium and the function of the heart. The interpretation of the images can be difficult and subjective. Several automatic myocardial SPECT quantification programs have been developed to standardize the interpretation and analysis of myocardial images. These programs are based on different mathematical models for determination of the heart shape and different normal databases for detection of abnormality, which may lead to disparity in the results given by these different programs. The aims of the work were to validate two automatic quantification programs, i. e. AutoQUANT and 4 D-MSPECT, concerning important parameters in the detection of CAD, such as extent, severity and semi-quantitative segment scores and to show that a combination of a patient-like digital phantom and the Monte Carlo technique is useful in simulating clinical patient images. Results: The development of a radioactive ink-based stack phantom was performed for accurate generation of SPECT images. The comparison between the images generated by the stack phantom and the corresponding Monte Carlo simulated images showed good agreement. Differences between the one-day and two-day protocols, as well as between the two quantification programs, were found. Interdependence between the measures of extent and severity were observed. The interdependence was identified as being due to the algorithm used by the quantification program in the assessment of extent and severity. A model was developed to account for this interdependence. The ability of myocardial SPECT to discriminate between transmural and subendocardial lesions was observed for the simulated cases, while in the clinical situations this difference is difficult to observe due to the interdependence of the extent and severity. Conclusions: The disparity between the two programs in assessing the same patient images was found. The combination of the NCAT digital phantom and the SIMIND program was found to be useful in simulating clinical myocardial SPECT study. This technique could be a promising tool since realistic patient studies can be performed in a controlled way and used as input in different automatic quantification programs for accurate comparative evaluations...|$|E
40|$|Arteriosclerosis {{with its}} {{clinical}} sequelae (cardiac infarction, stroke, peripheral arterial occlusive disease) and vascular/Alzheimer dementia not only result in {{far more than}} half of all deaths but also represent dramatic economic problems. The reason is, among others, that diabetes mellitus is an independent risk factor for both disorders, and the number of diabetics strongly increases worldwide. More than one-half of infants in the first 6 months of life have already small collections of macrophages and macrophages filled with lipid droplets in susceptible segments of the coronary arteries. On the other hand, the authors of the Bogalusa Heart Study found a strong increase in the prevalence of obesity in childhood that is paralleled by an increase in blood pressure, blood lipid concentration, and type 2 diabetes mellitus. Thus, there is a clear linkage between arteriosclerosis/Alzheimer's disease on the one hand and diabetes mellitus on the other hand. Furthermore, it has been demonstrated that distinct apoE isoforms on the blood lipids further both arteriosclerotic and Alzheimer nanoplaque formation and therefore impair flow-mediated vascular reactivity as well. Nanoplaque build-up seems to be the starting point for arteriosclerosis and Alzheimer's disease in their later full clinical manifestation. In earlier work, we could portray the anionic biopolyelectrolytes syndecan/perlecan as blood flow sensors and lipoprotein receptors in cell membrane and vascular matrix. We described extensively molecular composition, conformation, form and function of the macromolecule heparan sulfate proteoglycan (HS-PG). In two supplementary experimental settings (ellipsometry, myography), we utilized isolated HS-PG for in vitro nanoplaque investigations and isolated human coronary artery segments for in vivo tension measurements. With the ellipsometry-based approach, we were successful in establishing a direct connection on a molecular level between diabetes mellitus on the one side and arteriosclerosis/Alzheimer's disease on the other side. Application of glucose at a concentration representative for diabetics and leading to glycation of proteins and lipids, entailed a significant increase in arteriosclerotic and Alzheimer nanoplaque formation. IDLapoE 4 /E 4 was by far superior to IDLapoE 3 /E 3 in <b>plaque</b> <b>build-up,</b> both in diabetic and non-diabetic patients. Recording vascular tension of flow-dependent reactivity in blood substitute solution and under application of different IDLapoE isoforms showed an impaired vasorelaxation for pooled IDL and IDLapoE 4 /E 4, thus confirming the ellipsometric investigations. Incubation in IDLapoE 0 /E 0 (apoE "knockout man"), however, resulted in a massive flow-mediated contraction, also complemented by strongly aggregated nanoplaques. In contrast, HDL was shown to present a powerful protection against nanoplaque formation on principle, both in the in vitro model and the in vivo scenario on the endothelial cell membrane. The competitive interplay with LDL is highlighted through the flow experiment, where flow-mediated, HDL-induced vasodilatation remains untouched by additional incubation with LDL. This is due to the four times higher affinity for the proteoglycan receptor of HDL as compared to LDL. Taken together, the studies demonstrate that while simplistic, the ellipsometry approach and the endothelial-mimicking proteoglycan-modified surfaces provide information on the initial steps of lipoprotein-related plaque formation, which correlates with findings on endothelial cells and blood vessels, and afford insight into the role of lipoprotein deposition and exchange phenomena at the onset of these pathophysiologies...|$|E
