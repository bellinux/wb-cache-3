Results from the single-hole tests showed several significant correlations between permeability and injection rate and between permeability and test order. Fracture permeability values determined by cross-hole pneumatic testing in fractured ash-flow tuff ranged from 0. 81 to 3. 49 x 10 {sup - 14 } m{sup 2 }, depending on injection rate and analysis method used. Results from the cross-hole tests monitor intervals showed no significant correlation between permeability and injection rate; however, results from the injection interval showed a significant correlation between injection rate and permeability. Porosity estimates from the cross-hole testing range from 0. 8 to 2. 0 percent. The maximum temperature change associated with the pneumatic testing was 1. 2 {degrees}C measured in the injection interval during cross-hole testing. The maximum temperature change in the guard and monitor intervals was 0. 1 {degrees}C. The maximum error introduced into the permeability values due to temperature fluctuations is approximately 4 percent.

As part of the Nevada Nuclear Waste Storage Investigations Project of the US Department of Energy, the US Geological Survey has been conducting hydrologic, geologic, and geophysical investigations at Yucca Mountain and the surrounding region to provide data evaluation of the potential suitability of the site. Hydrologic investigations of the unsaturated zone at this site were started in 1982.

40|$|Classical water {{relations}} theory {{predicts that}} predawn plant water potential {{should be in}} equilibrium with soil water potential (soil Ψw) around roots, and many interpretations of plant water status in natural populations are based on this expectation. We examined this expectation for two salt-tolerant, cold-desert shrub species in glasshouse experiments where frequent watering assured homogeneity in soil Ψw and soil-root hydraulic continuity and where NaCl controlled soil Ψw. Plant water potentials were measured with a pressure chamber (xylem Ψp) and thermocouple <b>psychrometers</b> (leaf Ψw). Soil Ψw was measured with in situ thermocouple <b>psychrometers.</b> Predawn leaf Ψw and xylem Ψp were significantly more negative than soil Ψw, for many treatments, indicating large predawn soil-plant Ψw disequilibria: up to 1. 2 [*]MPa for Chrysothamnus nauseosus (0 and 100 [*]mm NaCl) and 1. 8 [*]MPa for Sarcobatus vermiculatus (0, 100, 300, and 600 [*]mm NaCl). Significant nighttime canopy water loss was one mechanism contributing to predawn disequilibrium, assessed by comparison of xylem Ψp for bagged (to minimize transpiration) and unbagged canopies, and by gas exchange measurements. However, nighttime transpiration accounted for {{only part of the}} predawn disequilibrium. Other mechanisms that could act with nighttime transpiration to generate large predawn disequilibria are described and include a model of how leaf apoplastic solutes could contribute to the phenomenon. This study is among the first to conclusively document such large departures from the expectation of predawn soil-plant equilibrium for C 3 shrubs, and provides a general framework for considering relative contributions of nighttime transpiration and other plant-related mechanisms to predawn disequilibrium...|$|R
