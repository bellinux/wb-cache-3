25|$|Originally a {{sub-category}} {{of direct}} discrimination, harassment {{is now an}} independent tort which requires no comparator. The Protection from Harassment Act 1997, and now the Equality Act 2010 sections 26 and 40, define harassment as where a person's dignity is violated, or the person is subject to an intimidating, hostile, degrading, humiliating or offensive environment. An employer will be liable for its own conduct, but also conduct of employees, or customers if this happens on 2 or more occasions and the employer could be reasonably expected to have intervened. In a straightforward case, in Majrowski v Guy's and St Thomas' NHS Trust a gay man was ostracised and bossed about by his supervisor {{from the very start}} of his work as a clinical audit co-ordinator. The House of Lords held the laws create a statutory tort, for which (unless a statute says otherwise) an employer is automatically vicariously liable. Under the Equality Act 2010 section 27, an employer must also ensure that once a complaint is brought by a worker, even if it ultimately proves to be unfounded, that worker should not be victimised. This means the worker should not be subject to anything that a reasonable person would perceive as detrimental. In St Helen’s MBC v Derbyshire the House of Lords held a council victimised female staff who were pursuing an equal <b>pay</b> <b>claim</b> when it sent letters warning (without much factual basis) that if the claim went ahead, the council would be forced to cut school dinners and make redundancies. Because it attempted to make the workers feel guilty, a reasonable person would have regarded this as a detriment. By contrast, in Chief Constable of West Yorkshire Police v Khan, a sergeant with a pending race discrimination claim was denied a reference by the employer that he was suing. The House of Lords held this could not be considered victimisation because the Constabulary was only seeking to protect its legitimate interests by not giving a reference, so as to not prejudice its own future case in the discrimination hearings.|$|E

40|$|Abstract This {{study is}} to {{investigate}} the determinants of the demand for life insurance policies in Taiwan. Specifically, the regression analysis is implemented in this thesis. The dependent variables considered in this thesis include insured amounts and premiums for overall and five individual insurances including while life, term life, endowment, health and accidental insurances. The dependent variables considered for the regression analysis are the personal characteristics including age, sex, marriage status, and the components of insurance policy, such as the way of <b>pay,</b> <b>claim</b> experience, etc. The empirical {{results show that the}} significances of determinants in the insured amount and premium regressions are different. Besides, the empirical results are also different for individual life insurances. The most interesting finding is that the coefficient of determinant (R-squares) in the regression for overall insurance is much less than the ones in the regressions for individual insurances. The independent variables, the way of <b>pay,</b> <b>claim</b> experience, and martial status are always insignificant in all regressions. The variable, condition, is significant in all regressions for individual insurance but not in the regression for overall insurance. The other variables are commonly significant in regressions for overall and individual insurances. Keywords: Life insurance, Insured amount, Premium, Regression analysis摘要 本研究旨在探討保額及保費，在所有商品及個別險種間的決定因素為何？為了達成此研究的目的，我們從實際的樣本保單及保戶的資料中，參考其他文獻資料，篩選出包含要被保人性別、年齡、理賠、婚姻狀況等變數，透過線性迴歸的方法來探討，利用敘述統計迴歸分析及共變異係數等方式來說明分析保額及保費對於各險種之間的決定因素。 實證結果發現，在保費的部分，不同險種間對於同樣的變數，有著不同的解釋，有些顯著，有些則不然。同樣是性別的這個變數，在終身壽險看來就較不顯著，而養老保險對於性別來說就比較明顯，情況可能是大多數的女性保戶較男性保戶更在意退休規劃的議題，其他如定期壽險也有相似的情形，男性投保的比率整體看來較女性為高，對於保障的需求，單身和已婚者在保障的部分，有明顯的差別。但在保額的變動部分，實證結果發現，無論是婚姻狀況或者年齡等變數，在解釋保額變化的部分，都沒有顯著的表現，可見我們無法用年齡的多寡或者婚姻的狀況來提供增加保額的理由，這和我們一般的想法並不吻合。可見在保額的規劃部分，還有許多我們沒有找到的變數。 關鍵字：壽險、保額、保費、迴歸分析目錄 第一章	 緒論…………………………………………………………………… [...] 1 第一節	 研究背景…………………………………………………………… 1 第二節	 研究動機…………………………………………………………… 1 第三節	 研究目的…………………………………………………………… 2 第四節	 研究流程…………………………………………………………… 2 第二章	 台灣地區人壽保險產業概況與文獻回顧…………………………… [...] 4 第一節	 人身保險之定義……………………………………………. ……… 4 第二節	 台灣地區人壽保險產業概況……………………………. ………… 5. 第三節 文獻回顧孤兒保單的定義與形成…………………………………… 16 第三章	 研究方法……………………………………………………………… 20 第一節	 研究資料與限制…………………………………………………… 20 第二節	 變數說明…………………………………………………………… 20 第四章	 研究結果與分析………………………………………………………. 23 第一節以保費為應變數所做的迴歸結果………………. …………… [...] ……… 23 第二節以保額為應變數所做的迴歸結果………………………… [...] …… [...] … [...] 32 第五章	 結論與建議 [...] . ………………………………………………………… [...] . 36 文獻參考 [...] . ………………………………………………………… [...] 37 											 表目次 表一、保險業家數及其分支機構……………………………………………… 6 表二、國情統計資料表 ……………………………………………………………………. 6 表三、壽險業占金融機構資產比率表………………………………………… 7 表四、保險密度、滲透度、人壽及年金保險投保率表……………………………. 7 表五、保險業保費收入統計表………………………………………………… [...] 8 表六、人身保險業保費收入統計表…………………………………………… [...] 8 表七、 98 年第一季保費收入一覽表……………………………………………. 9 表八、各險種 98 年第一季保費收入表…………………………… [...] …………. 10 表九、保險業重大事件一覽表…………………………………………………. 12 表十、壽險業務員登錄一覽表…………………………………………………. 18 表十一保費為應變數所做的迴歸結果表……………………. ………………… 34 表十二 保額為應變數所做的迴歸結果表……………………………………… 3...|$|E

Few topics have generated as much interest within the social sciences, {{as well as in}} the popular media. In the spirit of Kurt Lewin, we know that the theories we hold have practical implications for how we live and act. For this reason, it is useful to explore the background of these theoretical foundations as a way to introduce the articles in this issue and relate them to the ongoing gender debates in organizational and social science. After briefly summarizing the essentialist view, sex role theory, and social constructionist theory, I will summarize the thrust of the four articles in this journal, frame them within the context of the constructionist perspective, and suggest how they add to this important debate...|$|E
