The report found that the refugees had struggled to gain employment and English language skills. Another evaluation report undertaken for the Home Office and published in 2011 also found that only small numbers of resettled refugees were in <b>paid</b> <b>employment,</b> noting that many were still more concerned about meeting their basic needs.|$|E

5|$|Mental health {{consists}} of a broad scope of measurements of mental well being including depression, stress and measurements of self-worth. Numerous factors affect the prevalence of mental health disorders among women in India, including older age, low educational attainment, fewer children in the home, lack of <b>paid</b> <b>employment</b> and excessive spousal alcohol use. There is also {{evidence to suggest that}} disadvantages associated with gender increase the risk for mental health disorders. Women who find it acceptable for men to use violence against female partners may view themselves as less valuable than men. In turn, this may lead women to seek out fewer avenues of healthcare inhibiting their ability to cope with various mental disorders.|$|E
5|$|By early 1938 the Group {{had made}} their static rocket motor, which {{originally}} burned for three seconds, run for over a minute. In May that year, Parsons was invited by Forrest J Ackerman to lecture on his rocketry work at Chapter Number 4 of the Los Angeles Science Fiction League (LASFL). Although he never joined the society, he occasionally attended their talks, on one occasion conversing with a teenage Ray Bradbury. Another scientist {{to become involved in}} the GALCIT project was Sidney Weinbaum, a Jewish refugee from Europe who was a vocal Marxist; he led Parsons, Malina, and Qian in their creation of a largely secretive communist discussion group at Caltech, which became known as Professional Unit 122 of the Pasadena Communist Party. Although Parsons subscribed to the People's Daily World and joined the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), he refused to join the American Communist Party, causing a break in his and Weinbaum's friendship. This, coupled with the need to focus on <b>paid</b> <b>employment,</b> led to the disintegration of much of the Rocket Research Group, leaving only its three founding members by late 1938.|$|E

On 14 November, a duodenal ulcer perforated, from which he spent six months recovering. In an attempt to appease him, the Lord Chancellor offered Birkett a peerage without salary on 8 May 1950, but he refused as he lacked the means to survive without <b>paid</b> <b>employment.</b> While speaking {{at a conference in}} Washington, D.C. on 31 August 1950, he received a telegram from the Lord Chancellor offering him appointment to the Court of Appeal; he immediately wired back his acceptance.

50|$|In {{unemployment}} insurance (UI) in the United States, the average high-cost multiple (AHCM) is a commonly used actuarial measure of Unemployment Trust Fund adequacy.

In this definition, cost rate for any duration of time is defined as benefit cost divided by total wages <b>paid</b> in covered <b>employment</b> for the same duration, usually expressed as a percentage.|$|R
5|$|The Confederate {{stronghold of}} Vicksburg, Mississippi blocked {{the way for}} {{complete}} Union control of the Mississippi River, making its capture vital for the Union War effort. Grant's Army held western Tennessee with almost 40,000 troops available to fight. Grant was aggravated to learn that Lincoln authorized McClernand to raise a separate army for the purpose. Halleck ordered McClernand to Memphis, and placed him and his troops under Grant's authority. After Grant's army captured Holly Springs Grant planned to attack Vicksburg's front overland while Sherman would attack the fortress from the rear on the Mississippi River. However, Confederate cavalry raids on December 11 and 20 broke Union communications and recaptured Holly Springs, preventing Grant's and Sherman's armies from connecting. On December 29, a Confederate army led by Lieutenant General John C. Pemberton repulsed Sherman's direct approach ascending the bluffs to Vicksburg at Chickasaw Bayou. McClernand reached Sherman's army, assumed command, and independently of Grant led a campaign that captured Confederate Fort Hindman. During this time Grant incorporated fleeing African American slaves into the Union Army giving them protection and <b>paid</b> <b>employment.</b>|$|E
5|$|Through {{the late}} 17th century, the various clans {{of the eastern}} coastal region were governed by chieftains who {{typically}} ruled over one or two villages. A zana-malata named Ratsimilaho emerged to unite these clans under his rule in 1710. His reign lasted 50 years and established a sense of common identity and stability throughout the kingdom, but his successors gradually weakened this union, leaving it vulnerable to the growing influence and presence of European and particularly French settlers, slave traders, missionaries and merchants. The fractured Betsimisaraka kingdom was easily colonised in 1817 by Radama I, king of Imerina who ruled from its capital at Antananarivo in the central highlands. The subjugation of the Betsimisaraka in the 19th century left the population relatively impoverished; under colonisation by the French (1896-1960) a focused {{effort was made to}} increase access to education and <b>paid</b> <b>employment</b> working on French plantations. Production of former plantation crops like vanilla, ylang-ylang, coconut oil and coffee remain the principal economic activity of the region beyond subsistence farming and fishing, although mining is also a source of income.|$|E
25|$|South African {{employees}} {{who were in}} <b>paid</b> <b>employment</b> had median monthly earnings of R2 800. The median monthly earnings for men (R3 033) were higher than that for women (R2 340) - women in <b>paid</b> <b>employment</b> earned 77,1% of what men did.|$|E
30|$|Moreover, {{it should}} be noticed that the fed-batch medium only {{occupied}} 0.87 % of the total cost (Fig.  4 b). Additionally, the cost could be further decreased with improvement exerted on culture medium, electricity, and vapor, which account for the major chunk of the manufacturing expenses. Therefore, attention should be <b>paid</b> toward <b>employment</b> of highly efficient electric machinery, using inexpensive raw materials as culture medium for reducing the capital and operating costs effectively.|$|R

40|$|In recent years, {{a record}} number of women have been {{breaking}} out of corporate life and embracing entrepreneurial careers partly as a redress to the discriminations they experience in <b>paid</b> <b>employments.</b> Female entrepreneurship is emerging as a potent force as more women emerge as business owners even in economic sectors that were previously thought to be the preserve of men. Women in Business: Theory, Practice and Flexible Approaches is a practical book that sets out to provide support and practical planning tools to guide both established and aspiring female entrepreneurs. These include checklists and tests, which could make the decision-making processes easier because self-employment and entrepreneurial activities are decisions that cannot be taken lightly. Women entrepreneurs are seen to be more realistic about their commercial prodigies and often make attempts to develop them within a family environment, while men gravitate more towards developing business hierarchies with defined rules and working business procedures. A number of theories, based on feminist analyses of the same, are also explored. The recognition of the capacity of women entrepreneurs in our global community is no longer a matter of debate, but a realisation that female entrepreneurship is now forming one of the major factors contributing to the development of many countries, and not just countries in transition...|$|R

40|$|The social {{impacts of}} {{products}} and service life cycles are increasingly of interest among policy makers and stakeholders. Workers’ issues {{are considered to be}} a source of key inventory data to assess social impacts, and are crucial in moving towards social sustainability. There is a need to develop a social inventory database for evaluating social impacts {{of products and}} services. This study aimed at the development of a social intensity dataset using an input–output analysis framework. The 2005 Asian International input–output table is used in this work. Six social issues are considered: total <b>employment,</b> <b>paid</b> workers, vulnerable <b>employment,</b> wages, fatal, and non-fatal occupational injuries. To verify the acceptability of this study, an estimation of total social footprint deduced from final consumption rates was carried out. The social intensities associated with 10 countries and 76 economic sectors were constructed. The results show that the social intensities from cradle to gate the agricultural sector has the highest in terms of total employment and vulnerable employment. Meanwhile, the mining sector in China has a higher non-fatal and fatal occupational injuries than the agriculture sector, secondary sector, and tertiary sector. The public administration sector and the education and research sector had a higher wages intensity than any other sectors due to these sectors being labor intensive and having higher wages. The social intensity in terms of total <b>employment,</b> <b>paid</b> workers, vulnerable <b>employment,</b> non-fatal injuries, and fatal accident cases in the developing countries was higher than the developed countries whereas wages intensity in developing countries was lower than that of developed countries. The social footprints resulting from the final consumption of each country show that the social footprints had transferred from the developing countries to the developed countries. Exports from China to the USA, Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, and Singapore have a significant social impact in these countries...|$|R
