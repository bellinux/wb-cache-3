40|$|This article {{argues that}} {{scholars}} must understand mass digitized texts as assemblages of new editions, subsidiary editions, and impressions of their historical sources, {{and that these}} various parts require sustained bibliographic analysis and description. To adequately theorize any research conducted in large-scale text archives—including research that includes primary or secondary sources discovered through keyword search—we must avoid the myth of surrogacy proffered by page images and instead consider directly the text files they overlay. Focusing on the OCR (optical character recognition) from which most large-scale historical text data derives, this article argues {{that the results of}} this "automatic" process are in fact new editions of their source texts that offer unique insights into both the historical texts they remediate and the more recent era of their remediation. The constitution and provenance of digitized archives are, to some extent at least, knowable and describable. Just as details of type, ink, or paper, or paratext such as <b>printer's</b> <b>records</b> can help us establish the histories under which a printed book was created, details of format, interface, and even grant proposals can help us establish the histories of corpora created under conditions of mass digitization...|$|R

The frequency range of the tuner is usually within the terrestrial broadcasting bands. Some FS meters can also receive satellite (TVRO and RRO) frequencies. Most modern FS meters have AF and VF circuits {{and can be used}} as standard receivers. Some FS meters are also equipped with <b>printers</b> to <b>record</b> received field strength.|$|R

50|$|During 1978, unannounced reprints {{for some}} state values were issued printed in {{photogravure}} by Harrison & Sons, the same printer {{that produced the}} coil stamps earlier. Some of these reprints are quite scarce, particularly the Perlis 10 cents and Sabah 20 cents values, as they were replaced by the new issue of Flowers and Animals the same year, and the new issue had not been announced by the post office. Once again, the stamps were printed in sheets of 200 in two panes of 100, 10 x 10. Unlike the Bradbury Wilkinson printings, these sheets had cylinder numbers in the bottom right margins, one for each colour and numbered 1A for the left pane and 1B for the right.These stamps can easily be separated out from the Bradbury Wilkinson printings, as photogravure produces edges with a 'fuzzy' look, caused by the photographic process when producing the printing cylinders. This can clearly {{be seen on the}} edges of the word 'Malaysia'. Bradbury Wilkinson printings have clear, straight edges. There are also differences in shade, but these are unreliable.There were two reprints, not all values being reprinted twice, and new values produced during the second printing. It is this printing that produced the scarce 10 cents value. The only proofs that have appeared to date are single full colour proofs on Harrison & Sons presentation cards, all values existing. It is considered that only two each of these cards would have been produced, one for the <b>printers</b> <b>record</b> and one for the Malaysian Post Office in Malaysia.|$|R

40|$|A {{computer}} {{program has been}} developed that improves the efficiency of wind tunnel model leak checking. The program uses a voice recognition unit to relay a technician's commands to the computer. The computer, after receiving a command, can respond to the technician via a voice response unit. Information about the model pressure orifice being checked is displayed on a gas-plasma terminal. On command, the program records up to 30 seconds of pressure data. After the recording is complete, the raw data and a straight line fit of the data are plotted on the terminal. This allows the technician {{to make a decision}} on the integrity of the orifice being checked. All results of the leak check program are stored in a database file that can be listed on the line <b>printer</b> for <b>record</b> keeping purposes or displayed on the terminal to help the technician find unchecked orifices. This program allows one technician to check a model for leaks instead of the two or three previously required...|$|R
50|$|A {{proprietary}} {{communications protocol}} was {{common to all}} members of the Uniscope product line. Groups of terminals were generally dropped off a common communications line via a multiplexer (mux) and identified by remote identifier and station identifier symbols. Some terminals may have been equipped with peripheral devices such as <b>printers</b> and <b>recording</b> devices (cartridge tape or floppy disk) which were identified on the communications line by a device identifier. Terminals on a drop were sequentially polled for traffic, sometimes with a general poll to which any terminal with traffic could respond. A fairly complex data presentation protocol permitted application programmers to format a screen for any number of business purposes. For example, fields could be described that would accept only numeric or alpha-numeric characters. Some fields could not be changed by the terminal operator. A protocol extension permitted programmers to specify color for each field and lines on the borders of each cell (underline, or vertical bars, etc.) The Uniscope display protocol, while proprietary, roughly parallel the ANSI X3.64 standard.|$|R

50|$|Home {{computers}} {{often had}} incompatible peripherals such as joysticks, <b>printers,</b> or data <b>recording</b> (tape or disk). For example, if a Commodore 64 user wanted a printer, {{they would need}} to buy a Commodore-compatible unit, or else risk not being able to plug the printer into their computer. Similarly, disk formats were not interchangeable without third party software since each manufacturer (Atari, IBM, Apple, et al.) used their own proprietary format. Gradually computer and game systems standardized on the Atari joystick port for joysticks and mice (during the 1980s), parallel port for printers (mid-1980s), the MS-DOS-derived FAT12 format for floppy disks (mid-1990s), and so on.|$|R

2500|$|According to {{southern}} Chinese histories, during the 480s, {{a man named}} Gong Xuanxuan styled himself Gong the Sage and 'said that a supernatural being {{had given him a}} [...] "jade seal jade block writing," [...] which did not require a brush: one blew on the paper and characters formed.' He then used his powers to mystify a local governor. Eventually he was dealt with by the governor's successor, who presumably executed Gong. Timothy Hugh Barrett postulates that Gong's magical jade block was actually a printing device, and Gong was one of the first, if not the first <b>printer.</b> The semi-mythical <b>record</b> of him therefore describes his usage of the printing process to deliberately bewilder onlookers and create an image of mysticism around himself.|$|R

40|$|A major {{advance in}} our {{understanding}} of the natural history of Schistosoma haematobium-related morbidity has come through the introduction of the portable ultrasound machines for non-invasive examination of the kidneys and bladder. With the use of generators or battery packs to supply power in non-clinical field settings, and with the use of instant photography or miniaturized thermal <b>printers</b> to <b>record</b> permanent images, it is possible to examine scores of individuals in endemic communities every day. Broad-based ultrasound screening has allowed better definition of age-specific disease risks in urinary schistosomiasis. Results indicate that urinary tract abnormalities are common (18 % overall prevalence) in S. haematobium transmission areas, with a 2 - 4 % risk of either severe bladder abnormality or advanced ureteral obstruction. In longitudinal surveys, ultrasound studies have shown that praziquantel and metrifonate therapy are rapidly effective in reversing urinary tract abnormalities among children. The benefits of treating adults are less well known, but research in progress should help to define this issue. Similarly, the prognosis of specific ultrasound findings needs to be clarified, and the ease of sonographic examination will make such long-term follow-up studies feasible. In summary, the painless, quick, and reproducible ultrasound examination has become an essential tool in the study of urinary schistosomiasis...|$|R
40|$|The {{similarities}} in size, {{trend of the}} epidemic, the generic drug industries and the high poverty levelsbetween India and Brazil help to draw comparisons with regards to their ART delivery system.

Brazilused its resources to train physicians with the latest standards of care in the diagnosis, counselingand treatment of HIV/AIDS as well as to set up a 424 AIDS Drugs Dispensing Units (ADDU).

5000|$|There are {{a number}} of {{interesting}} dynamics here; Te Wharerahi was brother-in-law to Tāmati Wāka Nene and Eruera Maihi Patuone (both of which wished for peace) whilst there is a suspicion that Rewa and Moka may have been close to the Bishop Pompallier, who spoke against the signing of the Treaty to some of the Māori chiefs. William Colenso, the CMS missionary <b>printer,</b> in his <b>record</b> of the events of the signing of the Treaty of Waitangi gives an example of Bishop Pompallier's activities with a statement of the chief Te Kemara, when he signed the Treaty: “after some little time Te Kemara came towards the table and affixed his sign to the parchment, stating that the Roman Catholic bishop (who had left the meeting before any of the chiefs had signed) had told him [...] "not to write on the paper, for if he did he would be made a slave." ...|$|R
50|$|A {{carriage}} control tape was a loop of punched tape {{that was used}} to synchronize rapid vertical page movement in most IBM and many other line <b>printers</b> from unit <b>record</b> days through the 1970s. The tape loop was as long as the length of a single page. A pin wheel moved the tape accurately using holes {{in the center of the}} tape. A hole punched in one of the other channels represented a particular position on the page. Channel one was typically used to indicate the top of the page and might be the only channel used. Another channel might indicate the summary line on an invoice, enabling rapid skipping to that line. IBM provides a special manual punch that allowed accurate placement of the channel punches. Skipping occurred under computer control, but a form feed switch on the printer control panel allowed a manual skip to the top of the page. The tapes could be easily changed when new, continuously fed forms were loaded into the printer.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. This article {{describes}} a real-time temperature measurement {{system based on}} ARM 9 and temperature sensor DS 18 B 20. The temperature signal is collected by DS 18 B 20 and converted into 16 bits serial digital signal. Later, ARM 9 receives the signal and sends it to the wireless transceiver module PTR 2000. PTR 2000 sends the received signal to ARM 9. At last the signal is transmitted to the LCD for a real-time display, also {{be sent to the}} <b>printer</b> for detailed <b>records.</b> Our design proposal is simple and practical. System Design The design is to develop a high-precision wireless temperature measurement system. System consists of four major components: temperature measurement part, wireless transmission part, digital display and printer interface design part. Temperature measurement part complete the temperature signal acquisition and processing. Then get high-precision temperature data. The DS 18 B 20 temperature sensor which is made by DALLS company convert the temperature signal into 16 serial digital signal for the ARM 9 processing[1]. It can also improve the accuracy of temperature measurement. It greatly simplifies the interface between the microprocessor and sensor. Comparing with other types of temperature sensors...|$|R
5000|$|In the Bay of Islands, {{there existed}} a vague but widely {{diffused}} {{belief that the}} Treaty of Waitangi was merely a ruse of the Pākehā, {{and the belief that}} it was the intention of the Europeans, so soon as they became strong enough, to seize all Māori lands. This belief, together with Heke's views about the imposition of the customs duties, can also be linked to the further widely diffused belief that the British flag flying on Flagstaff Hill over the town of Kororāreka signified that the Māori had become taurekareka (slaves) to Queen Victoria. This discontent appears to have been fostered by the talk with the American traders, although it was an idea that had existed since the signing of the Treaty of Waitangi; William Colenso, the CMS missionary <b>printer,</b> in his <b>record</b> of the events of the signing of the Treaty of Waitangi commented that [...] "after some little time Te Kemara came towards the table and affixed his sign to the parchment, stating that the Roman Catholic bishop (who had left the meeting before any of the chiefs had signed) had told him [...] "not to write on the paper, for if he did he would be made a slave." ...|$|R
