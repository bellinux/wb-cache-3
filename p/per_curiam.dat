5000|$|One critic, {{antitrust}} expert Kevin McDonald of Jones Day, singles out the 1953 {{case for}} having truly created the antitrust exemption by reading congressional intent into Holmes original opinion. After quoting the <b>per</b> <b>curiams</b> closing sentence, he writes: With that baseless assertion, the baseball exemption was born. As we have seen, Federal Baseball {{said nothing about}} the Congress of 1890 intentionally excluding baseball from the Sherman Act. It {{is as if the}} majority in Toolson imagined Senator Sherman announcing that [...] "today we enact the Magna Carta of the working class so that all American business will respect the right of consumers to free and open competition ... that is, um, except for organized baseball, of course." [...] Indeed, what did it mean to affirm Federal Baseball [...] "so far as that decision determines that Congress had no intention of including ... baseball within the ... antitrust laws", when Federal Baseball said no such thing? Lower courts, he said, took the courts reasoning to mean that other professional team sports were also exempt, forcing the justices to clarify that it only applied to baseball, and criticize their earlier ruling, in order to sustain decisions that football and boxing were interstate commerce and within the scope of antitrust law.|$|R
40|$|Much {{scholarship}} {{in law and}} political science has long understood the U. S. Supreme Court to be the “apex” court in the federal judicial system, and so to relate hierarchically to “lower” federal courts. On that top-down view, exemplified {{by the work of}} Alexander Bickel and many subsequent scholars, the Court is the principal, and lower federal courts are its faithful agents. Other scholarship takes a bottom-up approach, viewing lower federal courts as faithless agents or analyzing the “percolation” of issues in those courts before the Court decides. This Article identifies circumstances in which the relationship between the Court and other federal courts is best viewed as neither top-down nor bottom-up, but side-by-side. When the Court intervenes in fierce political conflicts, it may proceed in stages, interacting with other federal courts {{in a way that is}} aimed at enhancing its public legitimacy. First, the Court renders a decision that is interpreted as encouraging, but not requiring, other federal courts to expand the scope of its initial ruling. Then, most federal courts do expand the scope of the ruling, relying upon the Court’s initial decision as authority for doing so. Finally, the Court responds by invoking those district and circuit court decisions as authority for its own more definitive resolution. That dialectical process, which this Article calls “reciprocal legitimation,” was present along the path from Brown v. Board of Education to the unreasoned <b>per</b> <b>curiams,</b> from Baker v. Carr to Reynolds v. Sims, and from United States v. Windsor to Obergefell v. Hodges—as partially captured by Appendix A to the Court’s opinion in Obergefell and the opinion’s several references to it. This Article identifies the phenomenon of reciprocal legitimation, explains that it may initially be intentional or unintentional, and examines its implications for theories of constitutional change and {{scholarship in}} federal courts and judicial politics. Although the Article’s primary contribution is descriptive and analytical, it also normatively assesses reciprocal legitimation given the sacrifice of judicial candor that may accompany it. A Coda examines the likelihood and desirability of reciprocal legitimation in response to President Donald Trump’s derision of the federal courts as political and so illegitimate...|$|R
25|$|On November 7, 1959, on the 116th {{day of the}} strike, the Supreme Court {{upheld the}} appellate court's findings. In Steelworkers v.

By a 5–4 vote, the US Supreme Court held that no alternative method for a recount could be established within the time limits set by the State of Florida.|$|E
25|$|Chief Justice Rehnquist's concurring opinion, {{joined by}} Justices Scalia and Thomas, began by {{emphasizing}} {{that this was}} an unusual case in which the Constitution requires federal courts to assess whether a state supreme court has properly interpreted the will of the state legislature. Usually, federal courts do not make that type of assessment, and indeed the <b>per</b> <b>curiam</b> opinion in this case did not do so. After addressing this aspect of the case, Rehnquist examined and agreed with arguments that had been made by the dissenting justices of the Florida Supreme Court.|$|E
25|$|Before the Supreme Court {{could hear}} the case, however, President George W. Bush issued a Memorandum to the United States Attorney General. In the Memorandum, President Bush {{asserted}} authority under the Constitution and the various laws of the United States to order states to review the convictions and sentences of foreign nationals {{who had not been}} advised of their Vienna Convention rights. Because of the President's Memorandum, Medellín filed a second case in state court for habeas corpus. The U.S. Supreme Court then dismissed Medellín's first petition for certiorari in a <b>per</b> <b>curiam</b> decision, Medellín v. Dretke, 544 U.S. 660 (2005) (Medellín I).|$|E
25|$|Since it {{presumed that}} Congress's {{failure to act}} in the years since Federal Baseball Club was an {{implicit}} expression of intent to keep baseball exempt from the Sherman Antitrust Act, it has been read as having done more to create that exemption than the older case. Two justices (Stanley Forman Reed and Harold Hitz Burton) dissented from the short, unsigned <b>per</b> <b>curiam</b> majority opinion, arguing MLB and its revenue sources had changed enough since 1922 that the logic of that case no longer applied. In 1972, a third justice (William O. Douglas) would express his regret at having joined the majority when Toolson was again upheld in the similar Flood v. Kuhn.|$|E

500|$|On remand, the United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit {{issued a}} <b>per</b> <b>curiam</b> opinion affirming Drayton and Brown's convictions. Five years after issuing its opinion in Drayton, the Supreme Court of the United States offered further {{clarification}} {{of the meaning}} of [...] "coercion" [...] in Brendlin v. California. Writing for a unanimous Court, Justice Souter cited Bostick and Drayton to hold that coercion should be judged according to the experiences of a [...] "reasonable person" [...] in the situation. He wrote, [...] "when a person has no desire to leave for reasons unrelated to the police presence, the coercive effect of the encounter can be measured better by asking whether a reasonable person would feel free to decline the officers’ requests or otherwise terminate the encounter".|$|E
500|$|Sotomayor {{was part}} of the three-judge Second Circuit panel that affirmed the {{district}} court's ruling in Maloney v. Cuomo (2009). [...] Maloney was arrested for possession of nunchucks, which are illegal in New York; Maloney argued that this law violated his Second Amendment right to bear arms. The Second Circuit's <b>per</b> <b>curiam</b> opinion noted that the Supreme Court has not, so far, ever held that the Second Amendment is binding against state governments. On the contrary, in Presser v. Illinois, a Supreme Court case from 1886, the Supreme Court held that the Second Amendment [...] "is a limitation only upon the power of Congress and the national government, and not upon that of the state". With respect to the Presser v. Illinois precedent, the panel stated that only the Supreme Court has [...] "the prerogative of overruling its own decisions," [...] and the recent Supreme Court case of District of Columbia v. Heller (which struck down the district's gun ban as unconstitutional) did [...] "not invalidate this longstanding principle". The panel upheld the lower court's decision dismissing Maloney's challenge to New York's law against possession of nunchucks. [...] On June 2, 2009, a Seventh Circuit panel, including the prominent and heavily cited judges Richard Posner and Frank Easterbrook, unanimously agreed with Maloney v. Cuomo, citing the case in their decision turning back a challenge to Chicago's gun laws and noting the Supreme Court precedents remain in force until altered by the Supreme Court itself.|$|E

It characterized the trial court's decision as [...] "thorough, thoughtful and well-reasoned" [...] while also lamenting that there were [...] "no good alternatives" [...] in the case.

2500|$|In a 6–3 decision, the Supreme Court {{agreed with}} the two lower courts, which had {{originally}} decided {{that the government had}} not met its [...] "heavy burden" [...] of showing a justification for a prior restraint.

2500|$|The United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit {{granted a}} {{certificate}} of appealability only regarding Day's forfeiture argument, and then affirmed in a <b>per</b> <b>curiam</b> decision.

2500|$|According to the Court, {{the statewide}} {{standard}} (that a [...] "legal vote" [...] is [...] "one {{in which there}} is a 'clear indication of the intent of the voter'") could not guarantee that each county would count the votes in a constitutionally permissible fashion.

2500|$|Interestingly, the <b>per</b> <b>curiam</b> opinion cited Dennis v. United States {{as though}} it were good law and {{amenable}} to the result reached in Brandenburg.

It may be that principles of stare decisis figured in the Court's decision to avoid overruling the relatively recent Dennis, but the distance between the two cases' approach is obvious and irreconcilable.|$|E

2500|$|Professor Charles Zelden faults the <b>per</b> <b>curiam</b> {{opinion in}} the case for, among other things, not declaring that the nation's electoral system {{required}} significant reform, and for not condemning administration of elections by part-time boards of elections dominated by partisan and unprofessional officials. Zelden concludes that the Court's failure to spotlight this critical flaw in American electoral democracy made a replay of Bush v. Gore more likely, not less likely, either in Florida or elsewhere. In 2013, retired Justice Sandra Day O'Connor, who had voted with the majority, speculated that perhaps the Court should have declined to hear the case, which [...] "gave the court a less-than-perfect reputation".|$|E
