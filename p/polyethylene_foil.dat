40|$|This paper {{presents}} an energy balance modelling approach {{to predict the}} nightly water yield and the surface temperature (Tf) of two passive radiative dew condensers (RDCs) tilted 30 º from horizontal. One was fitted with a white hydrophilic <b>polyethylene</b> <b>foil</b> recommended for dew harvest {{and the other with}} a black <b>polyethylene</b> <b>foil</b> widely used in horticulture. The model was validated in south-eastern Spain by comparing the simulation outputs with field measurements of Tf and dew yield.

The results were somewhat less precise for dew yield, with a larger scatter around the 1 : 1 relationship. A sensitivity analysis showed that the simulated dew yield was highly sensitive to changes in relative humidity and downward longwave radiation. The proposed approach provides a useful tool to water managers for quantifying the amount of dew that could be harvested as a valuable water resource in arid, semiarid and water stressed regions...|$|E
40|$|This {{contribution}} {{presents the}} analysis of an earlier proposed double membrane sensor for measuring mass density and rheological properties of liquids with respect to different driving modes. Concerning practical implementation the sensor mounting and {{the stability of the}} <b>polyethylene</b> <b>foil,</b> currently used as membrane material, are investigated. The sensor is based on two opposed membranes vibrating in parallel where a sample liquid is enclosed between the membranes. The excitation and read-out mechanisms of the membrane vibration are based on Lorentz forces induced in a static magnetic field. Each membrane carries three conductive paths for excitation, which can be separately connected to the excitation currents. This allows the excitation of the first and second modes of vibration and enables prestressing the second mode of oscillation. Analyzing the material-stability of the used <b>polyethylene</b> <b>foil</b> shows a strong long-term drift of the modulus of elasticity and an increase of internal damping with increasing temperature. Comparing the resonance frequency of the fundamental mode with earlier measurements achieved with the second mode of resonance indicates an increased sensitivity to density featuring a reasonably sustained quality factor for high viscosities. Thereby, the sensitivity can be adjusted by varying the distance between the membranes...|$|E

Pumpkin balloons, currently being used in the NASA Ultra-Long Duration Ballooning (ULDB) Program, consist of stiff meridional tendons that constrain a thin, highly curved plastic surface. The present study exploits the high degree of symmetry of this design by adopting a newly developed, closed form expression of a symmetry-adapted coordinate system for structures with n-fold symmetry, which provides the tangent stiffness matrix in a very efficient block-diagonal form. The critical buckling pressure of balloons with different properties are computed. It is found that for any chosen balloon there is a power law relation between the critical pressure and the number of lobes. The change in the power-law coefficients is used to study the sensitivity of different balloons to design parameters such as the shape of the lobe cutting pattern and the elastic properties of the membrane and tendons.

Five different types of pollen was measured, and Principal Component Analysis (PCA) was applied on the infrared spectra, using the software The Unscrambler X, version 10. 3. Instead of the commonly used KBr pellet, the pollen grains were embedded in paraffin between <b>polyethylene</b> <b>foils,</b> both for the practical implication as such foil easily can be used in pollen samplers, and to avoid scattering. The study offers an analysis of socio-economic consequences of allergies, and identifies the market components, market interest, cost, and price for a pollen analysis service (PollenID) to be based in Ås, Norway. Concerning the pollen analysis method, PCA plots show clear separation between pollen species, in addition to groupings among pollen of the same species. Due to the paraffin and foil embedding, scattering was almost completely avoided. The method needs further development to be fully automated, but demonstrates remarkable potential. However, the market research indicates limited interest for pollen analysis, possibly because this service is not available today, and the target groups might not see the need for a customized pollen forecast. The estimated operation cost was estimated to 1. 9 million NOK per year, and the price suggested was 200 NOK per sample, to make the analysis more available to the public. M-I...|$|R
40|$|We {{report on}} {{genotyping}} of {{single nucleotide polymorphisms}} (SNP) by melting curve analysis (MCA) on DNA microarrays in a plastic microfluidic system with integrated heaters using lamination foils. Thin-film micro-heaters were processed on <b>polyethylene</b> napthalate (PEN) <b>foil</b> in only one metallization step. DNA microarrays were prepared directly on the PEN surface without the need of surface pre-treatment via UV-mediated immobilization of the spotted DNA microarrays. MCA in microfluidic channels is demonstrated at a ramping rate of 60 °C/min, enabling ultra-rapid (50 seconds) SNP analysis...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} genotyping {{on a novel}} microheater concept using semi-transparent copper microheaters {{manufactured by}} roll-to-roll and lift-off on <b>polyethylene</b> napthalate (PEN) <b>foil.</b> Using a mesh structure, heater surfaces have been realized in one single metallization step with a manufacturing robustness higher than conventional meander structures. The thermal distribution of the meshes, evaluated using thermochromic-liquid-crystals (TLC), produced more homogenous heating characteristics compared to meanders. Parylene coated heaters were functionalized using copolymer poly(DMA-NAS-MAPS) to enable covalent DNA immobilization and successful melting curve analysis was performed differentiating between match and mismatch oligonucleotides...|$|R
