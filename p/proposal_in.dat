5|$|In 1978, {{expansion}} of Sunshine Village ski resort was approved, with added parking, hotel expansion, {{and development of}} Goat's Eye Mountain. Implementation of this development proposal was delayed through the 1980s, while environmental assessments were conducted. In 1989, Sunshine Village withdrew its development <b>proposal,</b> <b>in</b> light of government reservations, and submitted a revised <b>proposal</b> <b>in</b> 1992. This plan {{was approved by the}} government, pending environmental review. Subsequently, the Canadian Parks and Wilderness Society (CPAWS) filed a court injunction, which halted the development. CPAWS also put pressure on UNESCO to revoke Banff's World Heritage Site status, over concerns that developments were harming the park's ecological health.|$|E

Alternative theories have been proposed that do not require a large amount of undetected matter, but instead modify the laws of gravity established by Newton and Einstein; yet no alternative theory has been as successful as the cold dark matter <b>proposal</b> <b>in</b> explaining all extant observations.|$|E
5|$|After {{seeing the}} success of Pee-wee's Big Adventure, the CBS network {{approached}} Reubens with an ill-received cartoon series <b>proposal.</b> <b>In</b> 1986, CBS agreed to sign Reubens to act, produce, and direct his live-action children's program, Pee-wee's Playhouse, with a budget of $325,000 per episode, the same price as a prime-time sitcom, and no creative interference from CBS; although CBS did request a few minor changes throughout the years. After casting actors like Laurence Fishburne and S. Epatha Merkerson, production began in New York City. The opening credits of the show were sung by Cyndi Lauper.|$|E
5|$|Fleischmann and Weissmandl's rescue group, the Working Group, {{devised a}} more ambitious <b>proposal</b> <b>in</b> November that year. Known as the Europa plan or Grossplan, {{the aim was}} to bribe the SS with money from Jews overseas, {{primarily}} the United States, to stop the deportation of all Jews to Poland. Various sums have been mentioned in connection with this, including $2–3 million. Nothing came of it, reportedly because Heinrich Himmler intervened in August 1943.|$|E

A report by the London Borough of Hillingdon's planning department rejected the <b>proposal</b> <b>in</b> December that year {{on the grounds that}} the site was already overdeveloped.

5|$|In late 2011, Patton {{announced}} that he and Speaker of the Kentucky House of Representatives Greg Stumbo would ask the General Assembly to consider adding the University of Pikeville as the ninth state-supported university in the Kentucky university system.

5|$|The {{trial and}} {{execution}} of Riel caused a bitter and prolonged reaction which convulsed Canadian politics for decades. The Orange Irish Protestant element in Ontario had demanded the execution as the punishment for Riel's treason and his execution of Thomas Scott in 1870. With their revenge satisfied, the Orange {{turned their attention to}} other matters (especially the Jesuit Estates <b>proposal).</b> <b>In</b> Quebec there was no forgetting, and the politician Honoré Mercier rose to power by mobilizing the opposition in 1886.|$|E
5|$|There {{was also}} a <b>proposal</b> <b>in</b> 2000 to {{renovate}} the interchange at Bradley Avenue. The next year, SANDAG approved {{the construction of a}} southern bypass of Ramona and widening from Vigilante Road to Dye Road for a cost of $200million as part of a 2030 transportation plan. The chairman of the Ramona Planning Group suggested calming traffic by using a roundabout instead of widening the highway.|$|E
5|$|Towards {{the end of}} the session, Rice {{prominently}} {{broke with}} Democrats to oppose the removal of capital gains tax breaks and to oppose granting unemployment benefits to locked-out workers.

5|$|Added to {{the state}} highway system in 1933, and defined in 1935, Route198 {{extended}} from US 80 onto La Mesa Boulevard and Palm Avenue to SR94 by 1938. In 1947, the San Diego County Highway Development Association requested that the highway from Sixth Avenue in Mission Valley to US 80 be constructed as a freeway. Although state senator Fred Kraft criticized the <b>proposal</b> <b>in</b> July 1953 because he believed {{that it would be}} too expensive and would not reduce congestion in the long-term, especially around the junction with US 80 in Grossmont, approval for the Route 94 freeway extended to the junction with U.S. Route 80 (US80) by October, with the Grossmont part of the route signed as Route 67. The Route 67 freeway was completed in March 1957, from Campo Road and Route 94 to US 80; the project was completed for $1,625,000.|$|E
5|$|After {{the deal}} in Marysville fell through, ISC courted another site, this time south of Bremerton National Airport in Bremerton, WA just across Puget Sound from Seattle. Although like the Marysville {{proposal}} the <b>proposal</b> <b>in</b> Bremerton {{was to be}} partially funded with public money, the money will not come directly from taxes but instead from bonds funded by taxes, in a scheme {{similar to the one}} used to fund Kansas Speedway. Also like the Marysville proposal, the Bremerton track would be publicly owned and leased to ISC for three races per year. ISC's current proposal was met with a lukewarm response from area lawmakers and citizens, but the company has promised to present an improved offer for early 2007.|$|E
5|$|Al-Adil aroused open hostility {{from the}} Hanbali lobby in Damascus for largely {{ignoring}} the Crusaders, having launched only one campaign against them. Al-Adil {{believed that the}} Crusader army could not be defeated in a direct fight. Prolonged campaigns also involved the difficulties of maintaining a coherent Muslim coalition. The trend under al-Adil was the steady growth of the empire, mainly through the expansion of Ayyubid authority in al-Jazira and Armenia. The Abbasids eventually recognized al-Adil's role as sultan in 1207. A Crusader military campaign was launched on 3 November 1217, beginning with an offensive towards Transjordan. Al-Mu'azzam urged al-Adil to launch a counter-attack, but he rejected his son's <b>proposal.</b> <b>In</b> 1218, the fortress of Damietta in the Nile Delta was besieged by the Crusaders. After two failed attempts, the fortress eventually capitulated on 25 August. Six days later al-Adil died of apparent shock at Damietta's loss.|$|E
