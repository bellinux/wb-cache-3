The objective {{of this paper is}} to evaluate the global emission of a transport network based on <b>probe</b> <b>car</b> and traffic sensor data. This paper used the microsimulator; AIMSUN to simulate vehicles on a network and also the pollutant emitted. Different penetration rate of probe vehicles were simulated and the accuracy of pollutant estimated from probe vehicles were compared against the emission from the all vehicles simulated i. e probe and normal vehicles. Two spatial resolutions i. e. at a network level and at a link level were studied. This paper shows that <b>probe</b> <b>car</b> can be used to give good estimate of pollutant emitted by vehicles traversing on a network.

The objective {{of this paper is}} to evaluate the global emission of a transport network based on <b>probe</b> <b>car</b> and sensor data. Probe vehicles allow an accurate estimation of the emission at different points in the network and these results could be extrapolated to the whole network by using traffic sensor data. To begin, data emission which can be extracted from <b>probe</b> <b>car</b> must be tested. Therefore, the first task is an evaluation of the differences between the simulated vehicle emission (provided by using the microsimulator; AIMSUN) and estimation of vehicle emission from a sample of simulated vehicles representing the population of probe vehicles. The aim of the second part of this study is to determine the optimal penetration rate of probe vehicles. Then, the global emission and its accuracy could be determined. This methodology shows that using <b>probe</b> <b>car</b> gives good estimation of the real data emission (90 - 95 %).

Recent advances in connected and automated vehicle technologies enable sensor-equipped <b>cars</b> (<b>probe</b> <b>cars)</b> to detect and broadcast available parking spaces when driving through parking lots. In this paper, we evaluate the impact of market penetration of <b>probe</b> <b>cars</b> on the system performance, and investigate different parking guidance policies to improve the data acquisition process. We adopt a simulation-based approach to impose four policies on an off- street parking lot influencing the behavior of <b>probe</b> <b>cars</b> to park in assigned parking spaces. This in turn effects the scanning route and the parking space occupancy estimations. The last policy we propose is a near-optimal guidance strategy that maximizes the information gain of posteriors. The results suggest that an efficient information gathering policy can compensate for low penetration of connected and automated vehicles. We also highlight the policy trade-off that occur while attempting to maximize information gain through explorations and improve assignment accuracy through exploitations. Our results can assist urban policy makers in designing and managing smart parking systems...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. In recent year, {{the rise}} of {{economic}} growth and technology advance leads {{to improve the quality}} of service of traditional transport system. Intelligent Transportation System (ITS) has become more and more popular. At present, the collection of real-time traffic information is executed in two ways: (1) Stationary Vehicle Detectors (VD) and (2) Global Position System (GPS) -based <b>probe</b> <b>cars</b> reporting. However, VD devices need a large sum of money to build and maintain. Therefore, we propose the linear regression model to infer the equation between vehicle speed and traffic flow. The traffic flow can be estimated from the speed which is obtained from GPS-based <b>probe</b> <b>cars.</b> In experiments, the Speed Error Ratio (SER) and Flow Error Ratio (FER) of linear regression model are 4. 60 % and 24. 63 % respectively. The estimated speed and traffic flow by using linear regression model is better than by using linear model, power law model, exponential model, and normal distribution model. Therefore, the linear regression model can be used to estimate traffic information for ITS...|$|R

40|$|GPS is {{increasingly}} {{being used to}} collect travel data {{as the cost of}} the equipment is relatively low and it is capable of providing continuous and accurate spatial information and speed in real time. One such example is the Internet Protocol <b>probe</b> <b>car</b> (IPCar) project in Japan which equipped probe cars (consisting of taxis and buses) with GPS. The aim of this project is to explore feasible real time applications of IPCar data either as a stand alone data source or with other data sources such as detector counts and automatic vehicle identification (AVI) travel time. The initial focus of this project is to provide travel time information. This study focuses on a data cleansing consisting of 6 steps to determine the OD pattern of the probes. The cleansing process addresses data errors and searches for trip ends and the results show that the cleansed data was accurate in terms of trip length distribution, in particular for trips of more than 1 km. The probe data also matched 76 %- 83 % of the trips from an independent data from a taxi management system. The OD pattern gives a macroscopic view of the taxi movement and shows that the main generator and attractor of trips are areas around Sakuragi-cho, Yokohama station, Honmoku, Negishi station and Totsuka. The OD pattern and desired line of the <b>probe</b> <b>car</b> also demonstrate that using taxis as probe vehicles only generate intense data for the small areas heavily serviced by taxis and therefore travel time at a higher level of confidence can only be predicted for these small areas. Future full scale implementation of the IPCar project may need to consider private cars and other sources of information such as detectors and AVI data, to supplement area with sparse taxi coverage...|$|E

40|$|AbstractThis study applies a {{particle}} filter (PF) and an unscented Kalman filter (UKF) {{to estimate the}} headway and velocity of a six- vehicle platoon system. These two feedback estimators were used to estimate headway and velocity indirectly from several measurement variables, such as acceleration rate and velocity, of selected vehicles in the platoon. To evaluate {{the performance of the}} proposed two estimators, artificial car-following data were created to cover various speed ranges that include some acceleration and deceleration scenarios. Also, a comparison of estimation accuracy is conducted when varying the number of probe cars installed in the platoon system. Numerical analysis showed that the PF succeeded in estimating headway and velocity more accurately than the UKF, even when the number of probe cars installed is fewer and their location is varied within the platoon. The estimations by the UKF were inaccurate and the filter was unstable during all <b>probe</b> <b>car</b> penetrations except during the 100 % installation scenario. The UKF is considered to yield stable and accurate estimates only when all vehicles are equipped with the sensing system, whereas the PF does not require numerous probe cars to generate accurate estimates regardless of their location in the platoon...|$|E
40|$|A traffic {{reconstruction}} and prediction algorithm based on probe vehicles {{is discussed in}} the present paper. Traffic information is provided {{by a set of}} probe vehicles circulating randomly on the network, in the form of average traffic intensity and correlations local in time and spatial position.

Using statistical physics methods, a reconstruction algorithm is built and evaluated on a traffic toy model, where the queues have a finite capacity and specific state-dependent transitions rates are used to mimic typical situations of traffic-jams. The reconstruction algorithm consists of a message-passing procedure between sites corresponding to roads-segments at given day-time, which propagates both backward and forward in time, to reconstruct the past traffic and to make predictions.

In this study, we overview the present situation and structure problems on road {{information sharing}}. Two main problems are as follows: i) how to gather the information about which road can be used and ii) how to share the information among different disaster information systems used in the authorities concerned. We propose road information sharing using probe vehicle data to solve the first problem. The characteristics and the possible use of the GIS plotted probe vehicle data in past disasters are discussed. The probe vehicle data provide information to decide which road are likely to remain available at the time, and also where the vehicle turned around, that indicates the road might not be available. The travel time of individual car trips are numerically simulated with and without road information sharing among the cars. The reductions of the travel time depend on numbers of <b>probe</b> <b>cars</b> and road closures. The simulation results indicate that the probe vehicle data can be effectively used to reduce the travel time in a time of disaster, and to gather regional information on available roads...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Sapporo is a {{city with}} two million {{citizens}} that gets six meters of snow per year. This means that winter road management {{is very important for}} sustaining economic and social activities during the winter. We believe that an exploratory and iterative analysis and visualization approach is useful to support the decision mak-ing, to improve the winter road management strategies. We propose using a huge library of tools and services, and a framework that allows users to freely federate tools and services improvisationally (“mash-up”) to create custom visualization and analysis environments and to apply these on appropriately selected data sets. Un-like conventional macro analysis approaches, we focus on micro analysis of winter road conditions. We use <b>probe</b> <b>car</b> data, speed readings etc., automatically collected from taxis and private cars. Geospatial visualization of the average speeds of all the road segments shows how different roads are affected by heavy snowfall, by snow plowing, and by snow removal. Combining geospatial visualization with knowl-edge discovery algorithms is a potential approach in this area. An example would be clustering the road segments based on similarity of the impact snowfall has to group roads into groups that can be maintained using similar strategies...|$|E
40|$|The {{road network}} in the Keihanshin area (the second most {{populated}} urban region in Japan encompassing the metropolitan areas of the cities of Osaka in Osaka prefecture, Kobe in Hyōgo Prefecture, and Kyoto in Kyoto prefecture) is modeled as two layers {{from the viewpoint of}} the frequency of use of roads by freight vehicles. This model was derived, tested and validated from the <b>probe</b> <b>car</b> data of 300 trucks operated by 21 freight companies in the Keihanshin area. The two layers are called high-frequency-network and low-frequency-network layers. Characteristics, such as the density of probe data, average driving time, and speed of both network layers, were estimated. This analysis revealed that trucks spend a duration about 6 times longer on the high-frequency network even though it is 1 / 4 the size of the low-frequency network. The instantaneous velocity histograms indicated a significant difference in speeds between the two network layers of 25. 03 km/h in the high-frequency layer and 16. 87 km/h in the low-frequency layer.

The vehicle used was a EURO 4 emission compliant SI car. Two real world driving cycles/routes were designed and employed for the tests, which were located in a densely populated area and a busy major road representing a typical urban road network. Eight trips were conducted at morning rush hours, day time non-peak traffic periods and evening off peak time respectively. The aim is to investigate the impacts of traffic conditions such as road congestion, grade and turnings on fuel consumption, engine thermal efficiency and emissions. The time aligned vehicle moving parameters with fuel consumption and emission data enabled the micro-analysis of the correlations between these parameters. The trip average data for fuel consumption, thermal efficiency and emissions etc were calculated. The impact of vehicle's transient movements and traffic events on emissions were studied.

40|$|To gain {{a better}} {{understanding}} of the impact of parking spaces on traffic congestion, road infrastructure, time spent searching for parking and ultimately CO 2 emissions, several parking surveys have been undertaken. Traditionally these surveys were performed by individuals manually logging parking lot information, thus limiting spatial and temporal coverage due to high labor costs. As a result, the need for automating the data collection process for open parking spaces is paramount when one starts looking into using parking lot information in real-time applications and across a large area such as a city, state, or even an entire country. Some studies have been conducted looking into this automation process, such as using ultrasonic sensors, 2 D LIDARs, vision sensors, parking lot cameras and sensors for individual parking spots in a lot. Most of these methods generated promising results, but were either expensive or not suitable for real-time processing. This thesis describes an affordable method to detect parking spots in real-time by installing a low cost, off-the-shelf laser range sensors onto a <b>probe</b> <b>car.</b> Several algorithms will investigate the effect of having a stationary sensor and enabling a vertical motion of the sensor, with hopes of obtaining 3 D images of a parking lot. The experiments are conducted for different parking configurations, in normal and adverse weather conditions. The results were compared to onboard ground truth camera recordings of the experiments. Statistical analyses were also performed to determine how effective a laser range sensor is in mapping a parking lot in one run; and how many runs were necessary to map the parking lot with a certain confidence. Results show that the stationary laser range sensor maps parking spots with high accuracy, successfully generating a 2 D and 3 D layout of the parking configuration. Moreover, it has been shown that the sensor’s accuracy does not diminish for adverse weather conditions. The vertical motion of the sensor on the other hand helps with detecting some black cars, which are not as efficiently identified by the stable sensor. M. S...|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe headway {{distance}} between vehicles in a platoon {{is difficult to}} measure unless the vehicles are equipped with costly equipment such as laser or radar sensors, or an image processing system. This paper proposes an alternate approach to estimating headway distance indirectly from measurable variables such as the acceleration rate and velocity of selected vehicles in the platoon. Assuming a six-vehicle platoon, a particle filter (PF) and an unscented Kalman filter (UKF) are applied in order to estimate the headway of each vehicle based on the measurement variables of three (or all) vehicles in the platoon. The state-space models of the PF and the UKF are given by the conservation equation of headway and the conventional car-following model. To evaluate the PF and UKF performance, two scenarios were prepared: one assumed that prior knowledge of a model parameter differed from what was actually observed as posterior information, {{the other was a}} situation where a platoon vehicle slowed down unexpectedly during the car-following process. In both situations, the state-space model itself was unable to describe the dynamics of headway distance precisely, and the PF and the UKF were applied to minimize the headway distance errors caused by the incorrect model parameter and the unexpected vehicle slowdown. Numerical analysis demonstrated that both the PF and UKF were successful in estimating the headway distance, even when the car-following model did not express the true car-following phenomena. We also determined that, if all vehicles are equipped as <b>probe</b> <b>cars,</b> and thus capable of measuring the acceleration rate and velocity, the PF is superior to UKF when estimating the headway distance precisely. However, UKF is more stable than the PF when measurements are not taken from all vehicles, especially when a vehicle in the platoon unexpectedly slows downs during the car-following process...|$|R

2500|$|Triangulation method. In {{developed}} countries {{a high proportion}} of cars contain one or more mobile phones. The phones periodically transmit their presence information to the mobile phone network, even when no voice connection is established. In the mid-2000s, attempts were made to use mobile phones as anonymous traffic <b>probes.</b> As a <b>car</b> moves, so does the signal of any mobile phones that are inside the vehicle. By measuring and analysing network data using triangulation, pattern matching or cell-sector statistics (in an anonymous format), the data was converted into traffic flow information. With more congestion, there are more cars, more phones, and thus, more probes. In metropolitan areas, the distance between antennas is shorter and in theory accuracy increases. An advantage of this method is that no infrastructure needs to be built along the road; only the mobile phone network is leveraged. But in practice the triangulation method can be complicated, especially in areas where the same mobile phone towers serve two or more parallel routes (such as a motorway (freeway) with a frontage road, a motorway [...] (freeway) and a commuter rail line, two or more parallel streets, or a street that is also a bus line). By the early 2010s, the popularity of the triangulation method was declining.|$|R

However, it provides travel time information only for highways and major arterial roads on which detectors are installed, and assumes constant travel times for other miscellaneous links.
