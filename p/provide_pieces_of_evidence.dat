40|$|Within {{class of}} generic black holes there are extremal black holes (with {{vanishing}} Hawking temperature T) and vanishing horizon area Ah, but with finite Ah/T ratio,the Extremal Vanishing Horizon (EVH) black holes. We study the near horizon limit of a four dimensional EVH black hole {{solution to a}} generic (gauged) Einstein-Maxwell dilaton theory and show that in the near horizon limit they develop a throat which is a pinching orbifold limit of AdS 3. This {{is an extension of}} the well known result for extremal black holes the near horizon limit of which contains an AdS 2 throat. We show that in the near EVH near horizon limit the pinching AdS 3 factor turns to a pinching BTZ black hole and that this near horizon limit is indeed a decoupling limit. We argue that the pinching AdS 3 or BTZ orbifold is resolved if the near horizon limit is accompanied by taking the 4 d Newton constant G 4 to zero such that the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy S = Ah/(4 G 4) remains finite. We propose that in this limit the near horizon EVH black hole is dual to a 2 d CFT. We <b>provide</b> <b>pieces</b> <b>of</b> <b>evidence</b> in support of the EVH/CFT correspondence and comment on its connection to the Kerr/CFT proposal and speculations how the EVH/CFT may be used to study generic e. g.

40|$|Evidence {{exists that}} the {{observation}} of actions activates the same cortical motor areas {{that are involved in}} the performance of the observed actions. The neural substrate for this is the mirror neuron system. We harness this neuronal system and its ability to re-enact stored motor representations as a means for rehabilitating motor control. We combined observation of daily actions with concomitant physical training of the observed actions in a new neurorehabilitative program (action observation therapy). Eight stroke patients with moderate, chronic motor deficit of the upper limb as a consequence of medial artery infarction participated. A significant improvement of motor functions {{in the course of a}} 4 -week treatment, as compared to the stable pre-treatment baseline, and compared with a control group have been found. The improvement lasted for at least 8 weeks after the end of the intervention. Additionally, the effects of action observation therapy on the reorganization of the motor system were investigated by functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), using an independent sensorimotor task consisting of object manipulation. The direct comparison of neural activations between experimental and control groups after training with those elicited by the same task before training yielded a significant rise in activity in the bilateral ventral premotor cortex, bilateral superior temporal gyrus, the supplementary motor area (SMA) and the contralateral supramarginal gyrus. Our results <b>provide</b> <b>pieces</b> <b>of</b> <b>evidence</b> that action observation has a positive additional impact on recovery of motor functions after stroke by reactivation of motor areas, which contain the action observation/action execution matching system...|$|E
40|$|Harmonized {{time series}} of column-averaged mole {{fractions}} of atmospheric methane and ethane {{over the period}} 1999 – 2014 are derived from solar Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) measurements at the Zugspitze summit (47 ° N, 11 ° E; 2964 m a. s. l.) and at Lauder (45 ° S, 170 ° E; 370 m a. s. l.). Long-term trend analysis reveals a consistent renewed methane increase since 2007 of 6. 2 [5. 6, 6. 9] ppb yr − 1 (parts-per-billion per year) at the Zugspitze and 6. 0 [5. 3, 6. 7] ppb yr − 1 at Lauder (95 % confidence intervals). Several recent studies <b>provide</b> <b>pieces</b> <b>of</b> <b>evidence</b> that the renewed methane increase is most likely driven by two main factors: (i)  increased methane emissions from tropical wetlands, followed by (ii)  increased thermogenic methane emissions due to growing {{oil and natural gas}} production. Here, we quantify the magnitude of the second class of sources, using long-term measurements of atmospheric ethane as a tracer for thermogenic methane emissions. In 2007, after years of weak decline, the Zugspitze ethane time series shows the sudden onset of a significant positive trend (2. 3 [1. 8, 2. 8] [*]×[*]  10 − 2 ppb yr − 1 for 2007 – 2014), while a negative trend persists at Lauder after 2007 (− 0. 4 [− 0. 6, − 0. 1] [*]×[*]  10 − 2 ppb yr − 1). Zugspitze methane and ethane time series are significantly correlated for the period 2007 – 2014 and can be assigned to thermogenic methane emissions with an ethane-to-methane ratio (EMR) of 12 – 19 %. We present optimized emission scenarios for 2007 – 2014 derived from an atmospheric two-box model. From our trend observations we infer a total ethane emission increase over the period 2007 – 2014 from oil and natural gas sources of 1 – 11 Tg yr − 1 along with an overall methane emission increase of 24 – 45 Tg yr − 1. Based on these results, the oil and natural gas emission contribution (C) to the renewed methane increase is deduced using three different emission scenarios with dedicated EMR ranges. Reference scenario 1 assumes an oil and gas emission combination with EMR [*]=[*]  7. 0 – 16. 2 %, which results in a minimum contribution C  [*]>[*]  39 % (given as lower bound of 95 % confidence interval). Beside this most plausible scenario 1, we consider two less realistic limiting cases of pure oil-related emissions (scenario 2 with EMR [*]=[*]  16. 2 – 31. 4 %) and pure natural gas sources (scenario 3 with EMR [*]=[*]  4. 4 – 7. 0   %), which result in C  [*]>[*]  18 % and C  [*]>[*]  73 %, respectively. Our results suggest that long-term observations of column-averaged ethane provide a valuable constraint on the source attribution of methane emission changes and provide basic knowledge for developing effective climate change mitigation strategies...|$|E

40|$|Appropriate {{pharmacotherapy}} {{in older}} patients is of increasing importance. Advances {{in medicine and}} pharmacotherapy mean that people with health problems live longer. The longer life expectancy means that health professionals, but particularly physicians, pharmacists, and nurses, will have {{to meet the challenge}} of providing pharmaceutical care to older vulnerable patients. Older patients often have more than one medical problem. This makes appropriate prescribing for curative, preventive and symptomatic treatment goals essential, with polypharmacy as a result. However, there is currently concern about the large number of drug-related problems reported, which appear to especially affect older patients. These problems are thought to be because health professionals lack sufficient knowledge and skills in pharmacology and pharmacotherapy, possibly because of shortcomings in their education and training. Indeed, {{it has been suggested that}} improving education in geriatric pharmacotherapy might improve the knowledge and skills of health professionals in complex pharmacotherapy, thereby preventing or reducing the number of drug-related problems. ADDIN RW. CITE 328 Topinkova,E. 2012; 316 Members of EMERGE, Erice Medication Errors Research Group 2009; 14 Krahenbuhl-Melcher,A. 2007; 40 van den Bemt,P. M. 2000; 97 Aronson,J. K. 2006; 317 Aronson,J. K. 2009; 321 Cherubini,A. 2012 This thesis presents a series of studies on education in general and geriatric pharmacotherapy, knowledge and skills of health professionals, and educational intervention studies. No high-level evidence-based geriatric pharmacotherapy education was found in the literature. The WHO- 6 -step is proven to be effective for prescribing in general. The general and geriatric pharmacology and pharmacotherapy education at Dutch medical schools is already constructed quite well. However medical schools need to pay attention to assessment procedures – prescribing without a ‘prescribing examination’ is like driving without a driver’s license, given that it is a high risk task with potentially negative patient outcomes. For prescribing in general, the WHO- 6 -step should be adopted by medical schools worldwide, given the robust evidence supporting its effectiveness. This thesis shows that the effectiveness remains after implementation in a real medical curriculum by a longitudinal learning programme. The STRIP, a medication review method, could be adopted for polypharmacy skills, given the positive results on medical students’ polypharmacy skills and the lack of other evidence-based strategies. It might be worth considering using other clinical methods to achieve educational goals. A start was made to studying interdisciplinary learning between pharmacists and physicians, by identifying the actual knowledge of both professions. Several factors contribute to differences in knowledge and skills of health professionals. Undergraduate training results in more basic pharmacology knowledge for pharmacy students compared to medical students. Medical students had better pharmacotherapy skills and on applying knowledge on patients both groups of students performed equally. In the graduated health professionals, the pharmacists and the physicians, the difference increase with more years of work experience, with the highest scores for pharmacists on all domains of pharmacology and pharmacotherpy knowledge and skills. It is important to realize that the absence of evidence is not evidence for the absence of effect. ADDIN RW. CITE 372 Altman,D. G. 1995 In the field of geriatric pharmacotherapy education, there is a major absence of evidence, which means that teachers and curriculum designers should use the best evidence available.
