The optimum shell thickness as well as the dimensions and number of stringers are sought, which minimize the cost function. The cost function includes the material, fabrication and painting costs. For the comparison an unstiffened shell is also optimized.

40|$|A {{significant}} {{numerical simulation}} capability now exists {{for studying the}} various phenomena associated with the response, failure, and performance of multilayered composite panels and shells subjected to combined pressure, mechanical, and thermal loads. The phenomena involved cover {{a wide range of}} length scales from local to global structural response. The modeling approaches used for multilayered panels include micromechanical models, three-dimensional continuum models, quasi-three-dimensional models, and two-dimensional plate and shell models. Within each category a number of models with several levels of sophistication has evolved. The four categories are described in review papers. Despite the extensive literature cited in the afore-mentioned references, only a few studies have been reported on the effects of stiffness discontinuities, such as those associated with an abrupt stiffener termination or dropped plies, on the response of composite <b>panel.</b> <b>Stiffener</b> termination is often necessary in composite aerospace structures to satisfy detailed design requirements, and therefore an understanding and a prediction of its effect on the response and failure of composite panels are desirable.

40|$|Structural members, such as, {{stiffeners}} {{are applied}} to aeronautical structures {{in order to promote}} the necessary global or local dynamic stiffness. The manufacture and assembly process of these parts and machines capability can introduce variability in the parts and thereby incorporating uncertainties in the structural performance. Tolerances known as GD&T (Geometrical dimensioning and Tolerance), must be specified for several dimensions during the engineering design, in order to enable the manufacture of the structure. In the same way, some material properties have variability, when different suppliers are involved. Thus, the uncertainties must be incorporated into the structural analysis in order to obtain a more reliable design. Therefore, the present thesis applies the SFEM to incorporate these uncertainties in a typical structural member and panel applied in the aeronautical industry. The approach used was Perturbation Technique using Taylor series expansions to incorporate the uncertainties in the structural members typically used in aircraft. Natural frequencies, frequency response functions and modal analysis are studied {{in order to understand the}} consequences of these uncertainties in a beam with hat and "Z" section normally applied as an aircraft <b>panel</b> <b>stiffener.</b> The stiffeners were modeled considering the Timoshenko Theory in Matlab software. Sensitivity analyses were applied for the correct interpretations and trends of the top contributors.

Semi-active vibration control method based on synchronized switch damping have been attracted more attention due to its robustness compared with passive approaches and simplicity compared with active approaches. In this paper, three SSD semi-active control methods combined with a modal observer were applied to multimodal vibration suppression of an aircraft <b>panel</b> with <b>stiffeners,</b> and their effectiveness was verified by experimental results. A state observer was built based on the experimentally identified state-space model of the panel.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{the design and}} analysis of a composite sandwich solar array panel with internal local stiffeners. The purpose of this investigation is {{the connection between the}} panel and the satellite structure. The application for this purpose is the Eu:CROPIS (Euglena and Combined Regenerative Organic-Food Production in Space) compact satellite. The release mechanisms to be used are Frangibolts. A main design driver is the use of as few hold down and release mechanisms as possible. This approach is well founded due to the resulting reduction in complexity of the on board computer, the harness and its connections. Furthermore, the reduction in release mechanisms reduces the power consumption during the detumbling phase after launch. A finite element model is used to calculate the deformations, stresses and strains of the solar panel in different configurations. The numbers of hold down and release mechanisms (HDRM) as well as the layout of the internal <b>panel</b> <b>stiffeners</b> are investigated.
