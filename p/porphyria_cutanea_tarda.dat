40|$|Background. Bullous {{dermatosis}} (BD) {{is becoming}} increasingly recognized in patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD). It is clinically reminiscent of por-phyria <b>cutanea</b> <b>tarda,</b> but its detailed pathogenesis remains unclear. Studies have shown increased porphy-rin levels in dialysis patients, and this may partly explain the skin lesions and photosensitivity evident in these patients. In experimental studies, aluminium can induce various abnormalities in porphyrin and haem metabolism. This study investigated a possible involve-ment of porphyrin metabolism and aluminium {{in the development of}} bullous dermatosis in chronically dia-lysed patients. Methods. Three groups were studied (12 healthy con...|$|R
40|$|Hepatocellular {{carcinoma}} (HCC) is {{a common}} form of cancer that arises from hepatocytes and whose risk may be affected by several known environmental factors, including hepatitis viruses, alcohol, cigarette smoking, and others. Rare monogenic syndromes, such as alpha 1 -antitrypsin deficiency, glycogen storage disease type I, hemochromatosis, acute intermittent and <b>cutanea</b> <b>tarda</b> <b>porphyria,</b> as well as hereditary tyrosinemia type I {{are associated with a}} high risk of HCC. Several common conditions or diseases inherited as polygenic traits e. g. autoimmune hepatitis, type 2 diabetes, a family history of HCC, hypothyroidism, and non-alcoholic steatohepatitis also show an increased risk of HCC compared to the general population. Overall, the genetic susceptibility to HCC is characterized by a genetic heterogeneity; a high individual risk of HCC may thus be caused by several unlinked single gene defects, whose carriers are rare in the general population, or by more common conditions inherited by complex genetics...|$|R
25|$|The non-acute porphyrias are X-linked {{dominant}} protoporphyria (XLDPP), congenital {{erythropoietic porphyria}} (CEP), <b>porphyria</b> <b>cutanea</b> <b>tarda</b> (PCT), and erythropoietic protoporphyria (EPP). None of these are associated with acute attacks; their primary manifestation is with skin disease. For this reason, these four porphyrias—along with two acute porphyrias, VP and HCP, that may also involve skin manifestations—are sometimes called cutaneous porphyrias.|$|E
25|$|Most {{types of}} {{porphyria}} are inherited from a person's parents and {{are due to}} a mutation {{in one of the}} genes that make heme. They may be inherited in an autosomal dominant, autosomal recessive, or X-linked dominant manner. One type, <b>porphyria</b> <b>cutanea</b> <b>tarda,</b> may also be due to increased iron in the liver, hepatitis C, alcohol, or HIV/AIDS. The underlying mechanism results in a decrease in the amount of heme produced and a build-up of substances involved in making heme. Porphyrias may also be classified by whether the liver or the bone marrow is affected. Diagnosis is typically by blood, urine, and stool tests. Genetic testing may be done to determine the specific mutation.|$|E
25|$|The organs mainly {{involved}} in heme synthesis are the liver (in which {{the rate of}} synthesis is highly variable, depending on the systemic heme pool) and the bone marrow (in which rate of synthesis of Heme is relatively constant and depends on the production of globin chain), although every cell requires heme to function properly. However, due to its toxic properties, proteins such as Hemopexin (Hx) are required to help maintain physiological stores of iron {{in order for them}} to be used in synthesis. Heme is seen as an intermediate molecule in catabolism of hemoglobin in the process of bilirubin metabolism. Defects in various enzymes in synthesis of heme can lead to group of disorder called porphyrias, these include acute intermittent porphyria, congenital erythropoetic porphyria, <b>porphyria</b> <b>cutanea</b> <b>tarda,</b> hereditary coproporphyria, variegate porphyria, erythropoietic protoporphyria.|$|E
40|$|Chloroquine is a {{prototype}} antimalarial drug, {{widely used}} in several branches of medicine. Antimalarial drugs are used in the treatment of various dermatological, immunological, rheumatological and infectious diseases. Examples of off-labelled indications for chloroquine analogues use include dermatomyositis, sarcoidosis, polymorphous light eruption, disseminated granuloma annulare and porfiria <b>cutanea</b> <b>tarda.</b> There is a {{relatively small number}} of adverse effects related to chloroquine analogues used in standard doses, such as gastrointestinal disturbances, headaches, skin reactions, hypotension, convulsions, extrapyramidal symptoms and visual disturbances. Psychiatric side effects of chloroquine seem to be rare, but may manifest in a wide range of symptoms, such as confusion, disorientation, ideas of persecution, agitation, outbursts of violence, loss of interest, feeling sad, suicidal ideas and impaired insight. There is also a report of a manic episode with psychotic features in the course of bipolar disorder, and another case report of persecutory delusions, anxiety, derealisation and visual illusions triggered by chloroquine. The duration of psychiatric symptoms usually ranges from one to two weeks, and symptoms usually disappear within several days following cessation of chloroquine usage and starting psychiatric treatment where indicated. This article reviews the case studies of patients diagnosed with mental disorders resulting from the use of chloroquine, and discusses the management in such cases...|$|R
40|$|Thesis (M. A.) [...] Boston UniversityPorphyria <b>cutanea</b> <b>tarda</b> (PCT) is {{the most}} common form of porphyria, {{diseases}} that arise from decreased activity levels of enzymes in the heme biosynthetic pathway. Unlike other porphyrias that are caused by genetic mutations, PCT is often caused by exogenous factors, which include alcohol abuse, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection. Many studies have shown that there is an overlap in the population of patients who have PCT and HCV infection. HCV infection, in particular, causes inflammation and fibrosis in the liver, and disrupts overall homeostasis of the body, especially with respect to iron metabolism. Both diseases present symptoms that are either the cause or the effect of iron overloading in the liver. Iron overloading leads to oxidative stress in the body which further propagates symptoms of PCT and HCV. This review will investigate the causes, symptoms, and treatment modalities for patients with PCT and HCV infection. It will also evaluate the risk factors, such as iron overload and oxidative stress, which may contribute to the overlap among patient populations with the two diseases...|$|R
40|$|Some {{environmental}} factors of possible aetiological importance for primary liver carcinoma (PLC) in males were analysed in a case-control study including 83 cases of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), 15 cases of intrahepatic cholangiocellular carcinoma (CC), 3 cases of haemangiosarcoma and 1 case of unspecified sarcoma {{in the liver}} [...] 102 cases in total. Two matched controls were used in each case. One case with haemangiosarcoma was exposed to polyvinyl chloride. The case with unspecified soft-tissue sarcoma was exposed to phenoxy acids. A 4 -fold increase {{in the risk of}} HCC was seen in alcoholics, and regular drinking gave a 3 -fold increase in the risk. Exposure to organic solvents gave a 2 -fold increase in the risk of HCC. No increased risk was observed for cases exposed to various other chemicals. Three cases of HCC had a previous diagnosis of porphyria acuta intermittens (PAI), versus no control. Six cases of HCC had a previous diagnosis of porphyria acuta intermittens (PAI), versus no control.

500|$|Clinically, {{patients}} affected with HCP present {{similarly to}} those with other acute porphyrias, such as acute intermittent porphyria (AIP) and variegate porphyria (VP). [...] Patients with HCP and VP can present with symptoms shared between the acute and cutaneous porphyrias. [...] This includes the acute attacks of abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, tachycardia, hypertension and seizures, {{as well as the}} cutaneous findings seen in <b>porphyria</b> <b>cutanea</b> <b>tarda</b> (PCT), namely increased skin fragility, bullous lesions after exposure to sunlight and increased scarring.|$|E
500|$|Hereditary coproporphyria (HCP) is a {{disorder}} of heme biosynthesis, classified as an acute hepatic porphyria. [...] HCP {{is caused by}} a deficiency of the enzyme coproporphyrinogen oxidase, coded for by the CPOX gene, and is inherited in an autosomal dominant fashion, although homozygous individuals have been identified. [...] Unlike acute intermittent porphyria, individuals with HCP can present with cutaneous findings similar to those found in <b>porphyria</b> <b>cutanea</b> <b>tarda</b> in addition to the acute attacks of abdominal pain, vomiting and neurological dysfunction characteristic of acute porphyrias. Like other porphyrias, attacks of HCP can be induced by certain drugs, environmental stressors or diet changes. [...] Biochemical and molecular testing can be used to narrow down the diagnosis of a porphyria and identify the specific genetic defect. [...] Overall, porphyrias are rare diseases. [...] The combined incidence for all forms of the disease has been estimated at 1:20,000. [...] The exact incidence of HCP is difficult to determine, due to its reduced penetrance.|$|E
500|$|In 1991, Congress {{enacted the}} Agent Orange Act, giving the Department of Veterans Affairs the {{authority}} to declare certain conditions 'presumptive' to exposure to Agent Orange/dioxin, making these veterans who served in Vietnam eligible to receive treatment and compensation for these conditions. The same law required the National Academy of Sciences to periodically review the science on dioxin and herbicides used in Vietnam to inform the Secretary of Veterans Affairs about {{the strength of the}} scientific evidence showing association between exposure to Agent Orange/dioxin and certain conditions. The authority for the National Academy of Sciences reviews and addition of any new diseases to the presumptive list by the VA is expiring in 2015 under the sunset clause of the Agent Orange Act of 1991. [...] Through this process, the list of 'presumptive' conditions has grown since 1991, and currently the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs has listed prostate cancer, respiratory cancers, multiple myeloma, type II diabetes mellitus, Hodgkin's disease, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, soft tissue sarcoma, chloracne, <b>porphyria</b> <b>cutanea</b> <b>tarda,</b> peripheral neuropathy, chronic lymphocytic leukemia, and spina bifida in children of veterans exposed to Agent Orange as conditions associated with exposure to the herbicide. This list now includes B cell leukemias, such as hairy cell leukemia, Parkinson's disease and ischemic heart disease, these last three having been added on August 31, 2010. Several highly placed individuals in government are voicing concerns about whether some of the diseases on the list should, in fact, actually have been included.|$|E
40|$|Hormonal changes, {{prolonged}} fasting due to {{vomiting and}} some medications used during pregnancy, may cause an acute crisis of porphyria, sometimes unveiling a latent disease. Porphyria may also affect {{the evolution of}} pregnancy. Aim: To study the reciprocal influence {{in the evolution of}} both pregnancy and porphyria. Material and methods: Retrospective review of medical records of women with porphyria followed by the authors. If additional information was required, an additional visit to the clinic was scheduled. The characteristics of pregnancy, delivery and the newborn were analyzed. Results: Information about 60 pregnancies in 17 women aged 18 to 43 years was gathered. Among women with acute porphyria, one with coproporphyria had four pregnancies, nine with variegate porphyria had a total of 34 pregnancies and two with acute intermittent porphyria had six pregnancies. Five women with <b>porphyria</b> <b>cutanea</b> had a total of 16 pregnancies. Influence of porphyria in pregnancy: Compared to the general population, no differences were observed in birth weight of newborns, frequency of gestational hypertension, term or preterm deliveries of live newbornss, spontaneous abortions nor in tubal pregnancies; there was a high frequency of hyperemesis gravidarum. Influence of pregnancy in porphyria: 5 of the 12 patients with acute porphyria, had an acute porphyria crisis, 3 during the puerperal period and 2 during pregnancy (42 % of women, 11 % of pregnancies). All these crisis were associated to the administration of medications. All patients survived. Two of these women had six ulterior pregnancies without complications. Conclusions: Women with porphyria that become pregnant have a higher frequency of hyperemesis gravidarum. Crises among women with acute porphyrias, were always {{associated with the use of}} potentially dangerous medication...|$|R
