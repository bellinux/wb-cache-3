5|$|Konsu, and {{monolithic}} pillars with <b>phallic</b> representation {{have also}} been discovered in Madagascar. In ancient Maya, <b>phallic</b> architecture was rare but Uxmal in particular has {{a considerable number of}} phallus-like architectural pieces. It contains a temple known as the Temple of the Phallis and <b>phallic</b> sculptures and motifs.|$|E
5|$|Herodotus, {{the ancient}} Greek historian, {{documented}} women carrying large <b>phallic</b> shaped monuments and ornaments {{the size of}} a human body in villages in ancient Dionysia. On the island of Delos a pillar supports a colossal phallus, the symbol of Dionysus. Phallus reliefs on buildings on such sites are also believed to have been apotropaic devices to ward off evil. The elaborate use of <b>phallic</b> architecture and sculpture in ancient Greek society can also be seen in sites such as Nea Nikomedeia in northern Greece. Archaeologists excavating the ancient town discovered clay sculptures of plump women with <b>phallic</b> heads and folded arms.|$|E
5|$|<b>Phallic</b> {{architecture}} became {{prominent in}} ancient Egypt and Greece, where genitalia and human sexuality received {{a high degree}} of attention. The ancient Greeks honored the phallus and celebrated <b>phallic</b> festivals. The Greco-Roman deity Priapus was worshiped as a god of fertility, depicted with a giant phallus in numerous public architectural pieces.|$|E
5|$|<b>Phallic</b> {{architecture}} {{consciously or}} unconsciously creates a symbolic representation of the phallus. Buildings intentionally or unintentionally resembling the human penis {{are a source of}} amusement to locals and tourists in various places around the world. Deliberate <b>phallic</b> imagery is found in ancient cultures and in the links to ancient cultures found in traditional artifacts.|$|E
5|$|Scholars of anthropology, sociology, and {{feminism}} {{have pointed}} out the symbolic nature of <b>phallic</b> architecture, especially large skyscrapers which dominate the landscape as symbols of male domination, power and political authority. Towers and other vertical structures may unintentionally or perhaps subconsciously have those connotations. There are many examples of modern architecture that {{can be interpreted as}} <b>phallic,</b> but very few for which the architect has specifically cited or admitted that meaning as an intentional aspect of the design.|$|E
5|$|Similar figurines {{of women}} with phallus heads from the Neolithic period have been found across Greece, Macedonia and parts of old Yugoslavia. The vast {{majority}} of the figurines of the Hamangia culture have cylindrical phallus-shaped heads without facial features, although some, particularly of the Aegean culture, had <b>phallic</b> sculptural pieces with <b>phallic</b> heads with a pinched nose and slitty eyes. In these parts of the ancient world, obelisk like structures resembling the human penis were built, often with <b>phallic</b> symbols, representing human fertility and asserting male sexuality and orgasm. <b>Phallic</b> symbolism was prevalent in the architecture of ancient Babylonia, and in Khametian iconography, the obelisk was considered to be symbolic of the phallus of the masculine earth. The obelisks of ancient Egypt themselves had several functions, existing both as a reference to the cultus of the sun and of the phallus, representing fertility and power.|$|E
5|$|The ancient Greeks and Romans celebrated <b>phallic</b> {{festivals and}} built a shrine with an erect phallus to honor Hermes, {{messenger}} of the gods. Those figures {{may be related to}} the ancient Egyptian deity Min who was depicted holding his erect phallus. Figures of women with a phallus for a head have been found across Greece and Yugoslavia. <b>Phallic</b> symbolism was prevalent in the architectural tradition of ancient Babylon. The Romans, who were deeply superstitious, also often used <b>phallic</b> imagery in their architecture and domestic items. The ancient cultures of many parts of the Far East, including Indonesia, India (such as the Lingam), Korea and Japan, used the phallus as a symbol of fertility in motifs on their temples and in other areas of everyday life.|$|E
5|$|Priapic worship {{amongst the}} women of Sicily {{continued}} into the 18th century; worshiping <b>phallic</b> votive objects and kissing such offerings before placing them upon the altar in the churches. Fetishism with the phallus architecturally and in smaller implements was also exhibited by certain Christian sects in medieval times, such as the Manichaeans, and was connected with masochism and sadism, a form of religious flagellantism. Smaller <b>phallic</b> shaped monuments {{in the form of}} idols, even vases, rings, drinking vessels and jewellery have been well-documented and could be found within medieval churches of Ireland.|$|E
5|$|In 2012, a beehive metal {{sculpture}} by Thompson Dagnall in Hyde, Greater Manchester, was {{criticized by the}} council for installment adjacent to the children’s play area in Hyde park for looking too rude and <b>phallic.</b> Although Dagnall was paid £3,500 a week for his efforts, council workers modified the structure by stumping it and moved it {{to another part of}} the park.|$|E
5|$|This is {{followed}} with Spears performing a dance routine inside a blacklight paint graffiti room, {{and the two}} women dancing around a metal bedframe. Spears then begins chasing Madonna in a wooden-like maze, and the latter enters a room covered with fallen leaves and stands in a swing. Once Spears finds the room, Madonna {{is nowhere to be}} found. Throughout the video, Madonna gradually loses her symbolic power, paralleled by her disposing the cane and jacket, becoming less <b>phallic</b> and more noticeably female biologically and more feminine socially. Although it ultimately seems that Spears becomes the dominant figure, Madonna recovers her <b>phallic</b> power {{in the form of a}} cigar from an onlooking male. Spears appears in Madonna's room and throws her against the wall, and Madonna vanishes just as they are about to kiss. The video ends as Madonna's laugh is heard in the background.|$|E
5|$|He claimed similar <b>phallic</b> {{triplets}} {{for several}} other texts. However, {{in the majority}} of texts glyph 76 is not common, and Fischer proposed that these were a later, more developed stage of the script, where the creation chants had been abbreviated to X Y Z and omit the phallus. He concluded that 85% of the rongorongo corpus consisted of such creation chants, and that {{it was only a matter}} of time before rongorongo would be fully deciphered.|$|E
5|$|In Thailand, the phallus is also {{considered}} to be a symbol of good luck and representative of fertility. There are numerous shrines in the country featuring <b>phallic</b> architecture. Chao Mae Tuptim shrine in Bangkok, behind the Swissôtel Bangkok hotel has over a hundred colored circumcised wooden penis statues of all shapes and sizes which are said to possess special cosmic powers and endow good fortune and fertility on anybody coming into contact with them.|$|E
5|$|The {{clitoris}} develops from a <b>phallic</b> outgrowth in {{the embryo}} called the genital tubercle. Initially undifferentiated, the tubercle develops into either a clitoris or penis during {{development of the}} reproductive system depending on exposure to androgens (primarily male hormones). The clitoris forms from the same tissues that become the glans and upper shaft of the penis, and this shared embryonic origin makes these two organs homologous (different {{versions of the same}} structure).|$|E
5|$|Phallus impudicus, known colloquially as {{the common}} stinkhorn, is a {{widespread}} fungus recognizable for its foul odor and its <b>phallic</b> shape when mature, the latter feature giving rise to several names in 17th-century England. It is a common mushroom in Europe and western North America, where it occurs in habitats rich in wood debris such as forests and mulched gardens. It appears from summer to late autumn. The fruiting structure is tall and white with a slimy, dark olive colored conical head. Known as the gleba, this material contains the spores, and is transported by insects which are attracted by the odor—described as resembling carrion. Despite its foul smell, it is not poisonous and immature mushrooms are consumed in parts of France and Germany.|$|E
5|$|Candi Sukuh {{temple of}} Ngancar, East Java, {{was built in}} the 10th century and is {{dedicated}} to Shiva and is evidence of Tantric ritual in Hinduism and the fertility cult practiced at the time and preoccupation with the lingga. The temple has numerous reliefs graphically depicting sexuality and fertility including several stone depictions of a copulating penis and vagina. It consists of a pyramid with reliefs and statues at the front. Among them is a male statue clutching his penis, with three tortoises with flattened shells. The temple once had a striking 1.82 metre (5'11.5ft) representation of lingga with four testicles; this is now housed in the National Museum of Indonesia. <b>Phallic</b> references were also made in Khmer architecture in Cambodia, and several Khmer temples depict the phallus in reliefs.|$|E
5|$|The Vedic {{beliefs and}} {{practices}} of the pre-classical era were {{closely related to the}} hypothesised Proto-Indo-European religion, and the pre-Islamic Indo-Iranian religion. The earliest iconic artworks of Shiva may be from Gandhara and northwest parts of ancient India. There is some uncertainty as the artwork that has survived is damaged and they show some overlap with meditative Buddha-related artwork, but the presence of Shiva's trident and <b>phallic</b> symbolism in this art suggests it was likely Shiva. Numismatics research suggests that numerous coins of the ancient Kushan Empire that have survived, were images of a god who is probably Shiva. The Shiva in Kushan coins is referred to as Oesho of unclear etymology and origins, but the simultaneous presence of Indra and Shiva in the Kushan era artwork suggest that they were revered deities by the start of the Kushan Empire.|$|E
5|$|The Royal Artillery Monument {{attempted}} {{a very different}} effect. Jagger takes a realist approach to his figures, embracing detailed images of military power {{with none of the}} classical symbolism of other monuments, or even Jagger's own pre-war pieces. The art historian Reginald Wilenski likens the memorial to the work of Frank Brangwyn, who focused on depicting the physical labour of soldiers and workers during the war. The memorial shows the three upright bronze figures stood at ease, rather than to attention; the driver even leans back against the parapet, his cape hanging over his outstretched arms, suggesting an attitude of exhaustion or contemplation. The faceless, heavily laden statue of the fallen soldier appears less at rest than tired, pulled down as if by a great weight. At the same time, the sheer size of the memorial, including the oversized gun and the larger-than-life bronze figures, exudes a sense of strength and power; the figures are stocky, confident and imposing. This strength and power contributes to the sense of masculinity that pervades the work, from the <b>phallic</b> image of the howitzer, to the solid, muscular figures of the gunners.|$|E
25|$|The {{first period}} occurs between 4 and 6 {{weeks of the}} gestation. Examples include genital {{virilisation}} such as midline fusion, <b>phallic</b> urethra, scrotal thinning and rugation, and <b>phallic</b> enlargement; although the role of testosterone is far smaller than that of dihydrotestosterone. There is also development of the prostate gland and seminal vesicles.|$|E
25|$|In {{both sexes}} the <b>phallic</b> {{portion of the}} {{urogenital}} sinus extends on to the under surface of the cloacal tubercle as far forward as the apex. At the apex {{the walls of the}} <b>phallic</b> portion come together and fuse, obliterating the urogenital opening. Instead, a solid plate, the urethral plate, is formed. The remainder of the <b>phallic</b> portion is for a time tubular, and then, by the absorption of the urogenital membrane, it establishes a communication with the exterior. This opening is for a while the primitive urogenital opening, and it extends forward to the corona glandis.|$|E
25|$|In this context, the totemic pole may be {{interpreted}} as a <b>phallic</b> symbol.|$|E
25|$|<b>Phallic</b> props {{were used}} for satyr plays, symbolizing {{fertility}} in honour of Dionysus.|$|E
25|$|The {{definitive}} urogenital sinus {{consists of}} a caudal <b>phallic</b> portion and an intermediate narrow channel, the pelvic portion.|$|E
25|$|In Lacanian algebra, Φ {{stands for}} the {{imaginary}} phallus and also represents <b>phallic</b> signification; -Φ stands in for castration.|$|E
25|$|In {{the male}} the pelvic {{portion of the}} cloaca {{undergoes}} much greater development, pushing before it the <b>phallic</b> portion.|$|E
25|$|Mutinus caninus, a {{woodland}} fungus, draws {{its first}} name from Priapus's Roman name, {{due to its}} <b>phallic</b> shape.|$|E
25|$|The label {{also went}} on to suggest than an open teepee flap implied sexual {{encounter}} and arrow shafts become <b>phallic</b> objects.|$|E
25|$|A dildo is a sex toy, often {{explicitly}} <b>phallic</b> in appearance, {{intended for}} sexual penetration or other sexual activity during masturbation or with sex partners.|$|E
25|$|The {{top half}} of the human body is shown naked. Sometimes a kind of {{trousers}} are worn; sometimes the genitals are seen and there are <b>phallic</b> representations.|$|E
25|$|Coit Tower {{appears in}} many {{background}} shots. Hitchcock {{once said that}} he included it as a <b>phallic</b> symbol. Also prominent in the background is the tower of the San Francisco Ferry Building.|$|E
25|$|In ancient Roman religion, Mutunus Tutunus or Mutinus Titinus was a <b>phallic</b> {{marriage}} deity, in {{some respects}} equated with Priapus. His shrine was located on the Velian Hill, supposedly since the founding of Rome, until the 1st century BC.|$|E
25|$|The Centro Ceremonial Cuajilote {{is located}} on the Bobos River. It {{consists}} of a large plaza 400 meters long lined with structures. In the center of the plaza there are three shrines, one of which contains <b>phallic</b> figures.|$|E
25|$|Today, it is {{generally}} accepted among scholars that fertility was essential in Viking society, and the most famous find that testifies to such rites is a small <b>phallic</b> statuette that was found in Rällinge in Sweden in the early 20th century. The appearance of this statuette indicates that it was related to fertility rites and it is usually interpreted as Freyja's brother Freyr. Adam of Bremen tells of the <b>phallic</b> statue of Freyr in the Temple at Uppsala and of the ribald songs that were sung during the rituals. In Völsa þáttr, there is an account on how a horse's penis was worshipped by a pagan family, an account that has connections with an old Indo-Aryan sacrificial rite.|$|E
25|$|Several of Gotland's image stones show {{scenes that}} allude {{to death and}} eroticism, and the stones are two to three metres tall <b>phallic</b> {{memorial}} stones in remembrance of the dead. The stones have richly decorated surfaces and they often have a certain motif in the upper field: a welcoming scene {{in the realm of}} the dead between a man and a lady. The lady offers a drinking horn to the man who arrives on Sleipnir. It is the man's <b>phallic</b> shape, among other things, which allows us to connect the images to the literary sources. The scene may depict the deceased who is united with Hel or with Rán. It is primarily kings and chieftains who are portrayed with an erotic death, but also the death of a hero can be portrayed in the same way.|$|E
25|$|From the 1970s onwards, psychoanalytical {{ideas that}} have been arising {{in the field of}} French {{feminism}} have gained a decisive influence on feminist theory. Feminist psychoanalysis deconstructed the <b>phallic</b> hypotheses regarding the Unconscious. Julia Kristeva, Bracha Ettinger and Luce Irigaray developed specific notions concerning unconscious sexual difference, the feminine and motherhood, with wide implications for film and literature analysis.|$|E
25|$|However the San Gwann {{general public}} has several artistic {{monument}} being erected {{in different places}} and the Kolonna Eterna largely integrated within {{the landscape of the}} area; even if so some local have called for its removal because of its <b>phallic</b> nature. Eventually in 2015 Paul Vella Critien had inaugurated another monument at Naxxar Higher Secondary School which had not similar controversy.|$|E
25|$|Old Chichen (or Chichén Viejo in Spanish) is {{the name}} given {{to a group of}} {{structures}} to the south of the central site, where most of the Puuc-style architecture of the city is concentrated. It includes the Initial Series Group, the <b>Phallic</b> Temple, the Platform of the Great Turtle, the Temple of the Owls, and the Temple of the Monkeys.|$|E
