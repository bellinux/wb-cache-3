25|$|Rajneeshee {{attorney}} Swami Prem Niren (Philip J. Toelkes) argued {{before the}} United States District Court for the District of Oregon in November 1985 {{that the financial}} situation of the Rajneesh organization was such {{that it would take}} time to sell off assets to raise capital. He attempted to block execution of the jury judgment against the organization. Judge Owen <b>Panner</b> ruled that the judgment and collateral for paying it would remain, due to the uncertain financial circumstances of the Rajneesh organization. Byron received $975,000 of the judgment on November 27, 1985. Judge <b>Panner</b> refused to order Byron to return the funds to the Rajneesh organization.|$|E
2500|$|In September 2008, {{the three}} Santo Daime churches {{filed suit in}} federal court to gain legal status to import DMT-containing {{ayahuasca}} tea. The case, Church of the Holy Light of the Queen v. Mukasey, presided over by Judge Owen M. <b>Panner,</b> was {{ruled in favor of}} the Santo Daime church. As of March 21, 2009, a federal judge says members of the church in Ashland can import, distribute and brew ayahuasca. U.S. District Judge Owen <b>Panner</b> issued a permanent injunction barring the government from prohibiting or penalizing the sacramental use of [...] "Daime tea". Panner's order said activities of The Church of the Holy Light of the Queen are legal and protected under freedom of religion. His order prohibits the federal government from interfering with and prosecuting church members who follow a list of regulations set out in his order.|$|E
2500|$|The {{legal status}} in the United States of DMT-containing plants is {{somewhat}} questionable. Ayahuasca plants and preparations are legal, as they contain no scheduled chemicals. However, brews made using DMT containing plants are illegal since DMT is a Schedule I drug. [...] That said, some people are challenging this, using arguments {{similar to those used}} by peyotist religious sects, such as the Native American Church. A court case allowing the União do Vegetal to import and use the tea for religious purposes in the United States, Gonzales v. O Centro Espirita Beneficente Uniao do Vegetal, was heard by the U.S. Supreme Court on November 1, 2005; the decision, released February 21, 2006, allows the UDV to use the tea in its ceremonies pursuant to the Religious Freedom Restoration Act. In a similar case an Ashland, Oregon-based Santo Daime church sued for their right to import and consume ayahuasca tea. [...] In March 2009, U.S. District Court Judge <b>Panner</b> ruled in favor of the Santo Daime, acknowledging its protection from prosecution under the Religious Freedom Restoration Act.|$|E

30|$|In our review, most {{patients}} with <b>Panner’s</b> disease were boys (90  %).

It {{is often difficult}} to distinguish <b>Panner’s</b> disease from osteochondritis dissecans of the humeral capitellum. <b>Panner’s</b> disease has been reported to occur in boys between 7 and 10 years old, which is younger than susceptible age of osteochondritis dissecans. In MRI, low intensity area in the ossification center of the humeral capitellum in T 1 -weighted image is useful findings for diagnosis.

30|$|Several {{experts believe}} that {{abnormal}} valgus stress {{after the age of}} 5 years is {{the most important factor in}} the development of <b>Panner’s</b> disease [28, 29, 30, 31]. The capitellum has a rich vascular supply prior to the age of 5 years. Afterwards, the nucleus of the capitellum is mainly supplied by posterior vessels functioning as end arteries [32]. If those vessels are disrupted by repetitive stress (i.e. throwing), ischaemia can develop [30, 31]. This may result in the disordered endochondral ossification [29, 32] called <b>Panner’s</b> disease.|$|R

40|$|This {{research}} {{sought to}} investigate {{the problems associated with}} gold panning among non-panning rural, urban communities and also the gold <b>panners</b> of Shurugwi district. Although there are many potential socio-economic benefits of gold panning, there are numerous negative impacts from these small and inefficient panning operations as a result of wasteful extraction and processing techniques. The panning operations were found to be worsening social and environmental impacts of non-panning communities. The negative effects are already being felt in Shurugwi district were HIV spread has been on the increase, also theft and deaths by <b>panners</b> through poor mining and to a greater extent bully fighting. Extensive land degradation has further contributed to siltation of rivers and dams, destruction of vegetation as well as contamination of water bodies. The impact far outweighs the potential socio-economic benefits of gold panning as urban infrastructure has been at risk as well. The role of the government and other relevant stake holders as enforcers of laws, regulations and promoter of mining development need to be defined. Environmental destructive mining practises persist as there is lack of enforcement and control mechanisms for the gold <b>panners.</b> On the other hand there is need for gold <b>panners</b> in the district {{to take responsibility for the}} negative impacts from their livelihood...|$|R
