It is to be decided， if the lateral resistance of nails driven from one side only is worse than from both sides. 	The another practical important problem on the nailed joints is that how many length the nails are to be penetrated in the third piece of timber，so as to resist equivalently to the nails penetrating through three pieces.

Among 1300 analyzed trees, only 13. 7 % did not show external, macroscopic disease symptoms. There was a relatively large share of dead trees (15. 0 %), which in individual stands ranged 4. 0 - 32. 0 %. The most frequent symptoms in crowns were as follows: top dying (6. 3 % trees), entire branch dying (16. 2 %) or only their tops (9. 6 %), crown thinning (19. 4 %), leaf atrophy (10. 8 %) and leaf discoloration (11. 6 %). On sycamores trunks, the following symptoms were found: plate-like and strip-like necrosis of bark that was breaking, falling off and exposing wood (8. 6 % trees), local bark cankers (14. 7 %), among which healed ones dominated (10. 3 %), bark cracks (14. 3 %) and tree cancer symptoms (3. 8 %). Bark necrosis and wood exposure formed 1. 5 times more frequently on the northern and western side than on the southern and eastern side, bark cracks appeared most frequently on the southern trunk side. On the cross sections of sycamore trunks, the following symptoms were found predominantly: T-shaped discolorations which appeared in the place of local healed cankers, dead wood regions in the places of local unhealed cankers and widespread bark cankers, sometimes taking the form of a sector reaching the part near the pith, and greyish - green or greenish - brown wood discolorations in the form of numerous stains, especially in the trunk periphery part. On the trunks of 184 (14. 2 %) sycamores, perithecia of Nectria coccinea were present. They formed in the area of cankers on bark and exposed wood alike. Fruiting bodies of Nectria cinnabarina, Eutypa acharii, Melanomma pulvis-pyrius, conidiomata of Cytospora ambiens, Aposphaeria cf. pulviscula and conidiomata of Stegonsporium pyriforme occurred sporadically. From wood, the following were isolated predominantly: Basidiomycetes sp. 1, Chalara sp. 1, Cadophora fastigiata, Nectria cinnabarina and Cytospora ambiens. Chalara sp. 1, with its morphological features, best matched the anamorph of Ceratocystis coerulescens sensu lato...|$|R
