2500|$|The {{most common}} type of keel is the [...] "flat plate keel", and this is fitted in the {{majority}} of ocean-going ships and other vessels. A form of keel found on smaller vessels is the [...] "bar keel", which may be fitted in trawlers, tugs, and smaller ferries. Where grounding is possible, this type of keel is suitable with its massive scantlings, but there is always a problem of the increased draft with no additional cargo capacity. If a double bottom is fitted, the keel is almost inevitably of the flat plate type, bar keels often being associated with open floors, where the <b>plate</b> <b>keel</b> may also be fitted.|$|E
50|$|The Madeira {{was built}} at the Chicago yard of the Chicago Shipbuilding Company in 1900 {{primarily}} of heavy steel plates that were riveted together, with wood joinery used in other places. The ship had a flat <b>plate</b> <b>keel</b> and was shaped very flat and full to maximize cargo capacity. The career of the ship is mostly unknown, except for some notoriety gained when it struck the former Sault Ste. Marie International Bridge at Sault Ste. Marie, Michigan in 1902.|$|E

5|$|Three {{attempts}} to sabotage the ship {{were discovered in}} 1904. On 31 March, rivets on the <b>keel</b> <b>plates</b> were found bored through. On 14 September, a 1⅜in (3.5cm) bolt was found driven into the launching way, where it protruded some 5in (11cm). Shortly after the Connecticut was launched on 29 September, a hole 1in (2.5cm) in diameter was discovered drilled through a ⅝in (1.6cm) steel <b>keel</b> <b>plate.</b> The ship's watertight compartments and pumps prevented her from sinking, and all damage was repaired. The incidents prompted the Navy to post armed guards at the shipyard, and an overnight watch was kept by a Navy tug manned by Marines who had orders to shoot to kill any unauthorized person attempting to approach the ship.|$|R

The model data were extrapolated to full size by the usual method which assumes the forces to vary according to Froude's law, {{and in the case of}} the smooth model by a method of separation that takes into account the effect of scale on the frictional resistance. It was concluded that the effect of rivet heads on the takeoff performance of a relatively high-powered float seaplane is of little consequence but that it may be of greater importance in the case of more moderately powered flying boats...|$|R
50|$|Nubian was {{launched}} on 20 April 1909, her <b>keel</b> <b>plate</b> having been laid down on 18 May 1908 at the Thornycroft yard in Woolston, Southampton. The ship was commissioned for {{service in the}} First Destroyer Flotilla by Commander Colin McKenzie at Sheerness on 3 September 1909. Powered by oil-fired steam turbines producing a total of around 15,500 horsepower, she replaced a River-class destroyer in the flotilla. Steam trials had taken place {{at the mouth of}} the Thames in June of that year.|$|R
50|$|Edinburgh {{cast off}} the tow, {{so that she}} started to sail in circles. Although her guns were in disarray, she fired on the attacking German ships. Her second salvo straddled Hermann Schoemann, {{damaging}} her severely enough that her crew scuttled her. Edinburghs escorts drove off Z24 and Z25, but she {{was struck by a}} torpedo that had missed another ship. The torpedo struck Edinburgh amidships, exactly opposite the first torpedo hit from U-456. She was now held together only by the deck <b>plating</b> and <b>keel,</b> which was likely to fail at any time, so the crew abandoned ship. Gossamer took off 440 men and Harrier about 400. Two officers and 56 other ranks were killed in the attacks. The vigorous action of the minesweepers led the Germans to mistake the power of the force they were facing.|$|R
5000|$|Resolution {{was built}} by Palmer Shipbuilding and Iron Company, {{at a cost of}} £875,522, plus £78,295 for guns. She was laid down on 14 June 1890, {{launched}} on 28 May 1892 and completed the following November. She underwent trials in December 1893, and was commissioned at Portsmouth on 5 December of that year for service in the Channel Squadron. In early August 1894, Resolution was a unit of [...] "Fleet Red" [...] in the annual manoeuvres held in the Southwest Approaches. She was recommissioned for further Channel Fleet service on 9 April 1895. On 18 July 1896, she collided with her sister ship HMS Repulse, suffering slight <b>plating</b> and <b>keel</b> damage. She nonetheless took part in annual manoeuvres from 24 July 1896 to 30 July 1896, this time off the southwest coasts of England and Ireland as part of [...] "Fleet A".|$|R
50|$|A central row of {{symmetrical}} conical osteoderms {{is positioned}} on the back. On {{both sides of}} this median series, a parallel row of large thin osteoderms is present, featuring moderately high keels, their apexes pointing to behind. The vertical sides of the rump are covered by three rows of conical osteoderms: the upper rim is equipped with large plates and apexes pointing to the rear; at the middle side a similar row is present of even larger plates; the lower edge has a row of smaller <b>plates,</b> their <b>keels</b> to the contrary directed to the front. In general, the keels are sharp and narrower plates have higher and more asymmetrically placed keels. Some osteoderms have the shape of pure cones. The larger osteoderms are also ordered in transverse rows but are not fused into bands; small ossicles connect the larger elements. On the underside of the breast, osteoderms are present also.|$|R
2500|$|The {{contract}} to build Kearsarge {{had been given}} to Newport News Shipbuilding on 9 September 1940, and her keel was laid down on 3 August 1942. The seventh [...] was sunk in the Battle of Santa Cruz on 26 October 1942, and the CV-12 hull was renamed Hornet (the name Kearsarge is still stamped into her <b>keel</b> <b>plate).</b> Larger and more advanced than her Yorktown-class namesake, she was launched on 30 August 1943 and commissioned on 29 November 1943. Her first commander was Captain (later Rear Admiral) Miles R. Browning.|$|R
5000|$|Salvage {{operations}} commenced {{immediately after}} the grounding. The German cruiser [...] and the French training ship Duguay-Trouin came {{to the aid of}} the stranded ship with Bremen attempting to tow the steamer off the rocks. Within days, continued buffeting by waves and a storm pushed the ship broadside of the shore with a sharp list to port. Inspection revealed major structural damage to her frame and <b>keel</b> <b>plates.</b> Her engines had been displaced during impact and her port side was filled with 16 ft of water. She was declared a total loss on 19 December.|$|R
40|$|Hypostomus rhantos is {{described}} for a uniquely pigmented species of loricariid catfish {{from the upper}} Río Orinoco of Amazonas, Venezuela. Hypostomus rhantos can be separated from all other Hypostomus except H. micromaculatus by having its head and dorsal and lateral surfaces of body densely covered in very small spots (greater than 15 spots on the first plate in the dorsal series of specimens less than 100 mm SL vs. less than 10; greater than 30 spots in specimens greater than 100 mm SL vs. less than 15). The new species is distinguished from H. micromaculatus by having round spots (vs. longitudinally oval) that are unordered (vs. in longitudinal lines), by having well-developed keels on the lateral <b>plates</b> (vs. <b>keels</b> weak), {{by the presence of}} a ridge on the pterotic that is contiguous with the supraorbital ridge (vs. pterotic ridge absent), and by having the abdomen fully plated (vs. partially plated or naked) ...|$|R
25|$|According to her survivors, {{the first}} torpedo struck just aft {{of the bridge}} and caused major damage. Apparently, it {{exploded}} the ship's magazine; the resulting blast sheared off everything forward of the point of impact, destroying completely the bridge, the chart room, and the officers' and petty officers' quarters. As she stopped dead in the water, unable to signal a distress message, a second torpedo struck about 40 feet forward of the fantail and carried away the after part of the ship above the <b>keel</b> <b>plates</b> and shafts and destroyed the after crew's quarters. Only the midships section was left intact.|$|R
500|$|Brunel, {{anxious to}} ensure the {{avoidance}} of hogging in a vessel of such unprecedented size, designed the hull to be massively redundant in strength. Ten longitudinal iron girders were installed along the keel, running from beneath the engines and boiler to the forward section. The iron ribs were [...] in size. The iron <b>keel</b> <b>plates</b> were an inch thick, and the hull seams were lapped and double riveted in many places. Safety features, which {{also contributed to the}} structural strength of the vessel, included a double bottom and five watertight iron bulkheads. The total amount of iron, including the engines and machinery, was 1,500tons.|$|R
5|$|Abdül Kadir was {{the first}} Ottoman pre-dreadnought {{battleship}} to be constructed. She was laid down in 1892 {{at the beginning of}} a small-scale expansion of the Ottoman Navy. Work slowed down considerably once she was framed. By the early 1900s the only progress that had been made was the addition of armor <b>plating</b> around her <b>keel.</b> Once that was finished, work ceased. Construction was planned to resume in 1904 but by that time her keel blocks, which were used to prevent hogging and sagging, had shifted and the ship was considered a total loss. She was scrapped on the slipway in 1914. A model of this ship exists in the Constantinople Naval Museum.|$|R
50|$|The Hunley {{was removed}} from its watery grave at a 45 degree angle {{in order to keep}} the {{interior}} contents from shifting and falling through a weaken section of the hull. The Hunley had been laying at 45 degree angle on the sea floor for more than a hundred years. To lift the civil war submarine from the ocean, several slings were attached to the underside of the submarine and then slowly lifted from the water. Once the submarine was relocated to the Lasch Conservation Center it was left in the slings at a 45 degree angle until the hull <b>plates</b> and <b>keel</b> blocks were removed, eleven tons of sediment had been cleaned out of the interior and a engineering and strength evaluation could be completed. Once the evaluation was completed and the Hunley was deemed safe to move, it took three days in June of 2011 to turn the civil war submarine upright. The conservators also used sensors, located on the keel support, to monitor the weight on each bearing. This was done so that the conservators can make sure the weight of the submarine is being supported evenly.|$|R
40|$|Twenty-six {{stainless}} steel trunnion samples, five aluminum end support retainer plate samples, two aluminum <b>keel</b> <b>plate</b> samples, and two titanium clips were analyzed. The shielded high purity germanium detectors used had efficiencies of 33, 54, and 80 pcts. at 1332 keV. Detector efficiencies {{as a function}} of energy and corrections for self absorption in the samples were determined with calibrated sources, unactivated control samples, and calculations. Several measurements were made on most samples. In the trunnion samples, Mn- 54 and Co- 57 were seen and limits were obtained for other isotopes. The results agree well with 1 -D activation calculations for an anisotropic trapped proton model. In the aluminum samples, Na- 22 and Be- 7 were seen. Other results are presented...|$|R
40|$|Some measuremental {{studies on}} the hull types of temmas in the Omura Bay were made with 27 construction-{{diagrams}} and, for comparison, 12 diagrams in other coasts. Some statistical reviw resulted in the following findings: i) For the temmas in the Omura Bay, B/L and the inclination of the stem are rather small and D/L is rather large, compared with the temmas in the other coasts. ii) In the transverse section, the subtended angle between the stern part of the <b>keel</b> <b>plating,</b> which is called tomogawara, and the base line is rather large, and the inclining angle of the side plating is rather small. iii) As a result of discriminant analysis, it was indicated that the hull types of temmas are clearly different by designer and by use...|$|R
