40|$|Recently, a lot {{of energy}} {{efficient}} techniques have been developed to reduce the usage of the carbon intensive energy (brown energy) of databases. There is a new opportunity to reduce the brown energy usage: renewable <b>energy</b> (<b>green</b> <b>energy)</b> has been used to at least partially power computer systems. The key challenge of exploiting <b>green</b> <b>energy</b> sources is that they are variable and intermittent. So far, there has been little work on integrating renewable energy into a database system. This paper attempts to bridge this gap with ReinDB (Renewable Energy Integrated Database). The design goal of ReinDB is to minimize the brown energy consumption on a database server with both <b>green</b> and brown <b>energy</b> supplies. Specifically, we develop the green supply driven execution paradigm and adaptive power management techniques <b>to</b> adapt <b>to</b> <b>green</b> <b>energy</b> supply. We further propose <b>green</b> aware optimizations <b>to</b> improve the efficiency of both brown and <b>green</b> <b>energy</b> usage.

40|$|We {{consider}} {{a model of}} capital replacement under uncertainty of energy costs. Adjustment delays in the replacement of energy-intensive capital follow from two fundamentals in the problem: uncertainty and Ricardian rents in the existing cap-ital structure. They imply a simple dichotomy where short-run output contracts, but the long-run output recovers and increases above the initial output, despite the increasing energy costs. To provide a quantitative assessment of the consumer price increase needed for the replacement, adjustment delays, and policies expe-diting the change, the model is calibrated using electricity market data. We find that a market-driven large scale entry of <b>green</b> <b>energy</b> requires unprecedented en-ergy cost and consumer price increases mainly due to rents of the existing capital.
