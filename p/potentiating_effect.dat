In this study we compared the platelet proaggregating and <b>potentiating</b> <b>effects</b> of unfractionated heparin (UH), 2 low molecular weight (LMW) heparins, enoxaparin and dalteparin, and a heparinoid, danaparoid sodium (orgaran), to platelets of an ICU patient population and a normal control group. In both populations UH caused platelet aggregation in a dose-dependent manner. This occurred in the therapeutic range of the drug, with as little as 0. 5 U/ml UH. The LMW heparins caused less and the heparinoid least platelet aggregation. Generally, the aggregation observed in ICU patients was greater than in the normal population. The <b>potentiating</b> <b>effects</b> of the 4 drugs in association with physiological agonists was examined. Similar patterns of potentiation were observed in both populations, with UH causing significant enhancement of platelet aggregation, the LMW heparins intermediate and heparinoid least enhancement. There was substantial variability in the individuals' platelets' reactions to the drugs, in particular to UH. Our findings suggest that UH has the greatest effect, the low molecular weight heparins an intermediate effect and the heparinoid the least propensity to cause platelet activation...|$|R

5000|$|... dFBr {{has been}} {{identified}} as a novel positive allosteric modulator of neuronal nicotinic acetylcholine receptor with sub-type specificity for heteromeric receptor with no effect on homomeric sub-type. A recent study has been published which describes the synthesis of water-soluble salts of dFBr and its action has been confirmed as selective potentiator of α4β2 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor responses by using two-electrode voltage clamp whole cell recordings. In the year 2002 it was reported that dFBr was cytotoxic on human colon cancer cell line HCT-116.Desformylflustrabromine has also been found to be a positive allosteric modulator for the α2β2 subtype of neuronal nicotinic acetylcholine receptor. Additionally it relieves the inhibition of both α2β2 and α4β2 Nicotinic Acetylcholine Receptors by β-Amyloid (1-42) Peptide. Thus Desformylflustrabromine can potentially be used in the treatment of Alzheimer's disease.

5000|$|Poly {{drug use}} often {{carries with it}} more risk than use of a single drug, due to an {{increase}} in side effects, and drug synergy. The <b>potentiating</b> <b>effect</b> of one drug on another is sometimes considerable and here the licit drugs and medicines - such as alcohol, nicotine and antidepressants - have to be considered in conjunction with the controlled psychoactive substances. The risk level will depend on the dosage level of both substances. If the drugs taken are illegal, they have a chance of being mixed (also known as [...] "cutting") with other substances which dealers are reported to do to increase the perceived quantity when selling to others to increase their returns. This is particularly common with powdered drugs such as cocaine or MDMA which can be mixed with relative ease by adding another white powdery substance to the drug. This cumulative effect can lead to further unintended harm to health dependent on what is being covertly added. Concerns also exist about a number of pharmacological pairings: alcohol and cocaine increase cardiovascular toxicity; alcohol or depressant drugs, when taken with opioids, lead to an increased risk of overdose; and opioids or cocaine taken with ecstasy or amphetamines also result in additional acute toxicity. Benzodiazepines are notorious for causing death when mixed with other CNS depressants such as opioids, alcohol, or barbiturates.|$|E

40|$|Conventional {{methods of}} {{classifying}} {{causes of death}} suggest that about 70 % of the deaths of children (aged 0 - 4 years) worldwide are due to diarrhoeal illness, acute respiratory infection, malaria, and immunizable diseases. The role of malnutrition in child mortality is not revealed by these conventional methods, despite the long-standing recognition of the synergism between malnutrition and infectious diseases. This paper describes a recently-developed epidemiological method to estimate the percentage of child deaths (aged 6 - 59 months) which {{could be attributed to}} the <b>potentiating</b> <b>effects</b> of malnutrition in infectious disease. The results from 53 developing countries with nationally representative data on child weight-for-age indicate that 56 % of child deaths were attributable to malnutrition's <b>potentiating</b> <b>effects,</b> and 83 % of these were attributable to mild-to-moderate as opposed to severe malnutrition. For individual countries, malnutrition's total <b>potentiating</b> <b>effects</b> on mortality ranged from 13 % to 66 %, with at least three-quarters of this arising from mild-to-moderate malnutrition in each case. These results show that malnutrition has a far more powerful impact on child mortality than is generally appreciated, and suggest that strategies involving only the screening and treatment of the severely malnourished will do little to address this impact. The methodology provided in this paper makes it possible to estimate the effects of malnutrition on child mortality in any population for which prevalence data exist...|$|R
50|$|Consistent {{with the}} role of most siglecs and the {{presence}} of the intracellular ITIM, Siglec-8 has been found to function as an inhibitory immunoregulatory receptor. Ligation of Siglec-8 induces apoptosis in eosinophils, and, surprisingly, the normally pro-survival cytokines interleukin (IL)-5 and GM-CSF have been found to potentiate this apoptotic effect. IL-33, which activates and maintains eosinophils, also exerts a similar <b>potentiating</b> <b>effect</b> on Siglec-8-induced apoptosis. Inhibitor studies demonstrate that apoptosis induced by crosslinking Siglec-8 through the use of an anti-Siglec-8 mAb and a secondary antibody is mediated sequentially through reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, loss of mitochondrial membrane potential, and caspase activation. In the presence of IL-5, the loss of mitochondrial membrane integrity is accelerated and the secondary crosslinking antibody is no longer necessary to induce apoptosis. IL-5 stimulation also appears to alter the mode of cell death of eosinophils induced by Siglec-8 ligation in that cell death becomes a caspase-independent process. Costimulation of the IL-5 receptor and Siglec-8 leads to a type of cell death resembling regulated necrosis that is promoted by MEK1/ERK signaling. Because inhibition of MEK1 does not alter ROS generation but the ROS inhibitor diphenyleneiodonium inhibits ERK1/2 phosphorylation and cell death, the production of ROS appears to be upstream of MEK1/ERK signaling in this pathway. Cell death induced by Siglec-8 in the presence of IL-33, in contrast, is mediated primarily by a caspase-dependent pathway, and IL-33 is capable of synergizing with IL-5 in potentiating cell death induced by Siglec-8 ligation.|$|E

However, the mechanism of this effect was not clear. Since the nitric oxide (NO) and prostaglandins (PGs) induced by LPS might modulate IL- 6 release, we examined whether NO and PGs were also involved in the <b>potentiating</b> <b>effect</b> of rat CGRP (rCGRP) on LPS-induced IL- 6 release from mouse macrophages. The IL- 6 level in the medium was measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Accumulation of NO was assessed by measuring the presence of nitrite by the Greiss reaction. PGI 2 was assessed by measuring the formation of 6 -keto-prostaglandin F 1 α (6 -keto-PGF 1 α) by radioimmunoassay. The {{results showed that the}} <b>potentiating</b> <b>effect</b> of rCGRP (0 · 1 nm) on LPS-induced IL- 6 release was significantly inhibited by either 100 μm NG-monomethyl-l-arginine acetate (l-NMMA; an inhibitor of NO synthase) or 10 μm indomethacin (an inhibitor of cyclo-oxygenase). The LPS-induced NO and PGI 2 production from these cells was increased significantly by rCGRP at 0 · 01 – 10 nm in a concentration-dependent manner, which was blocked by l-NMMA and indomethacin. These results suggest that rCGRP enhances the NO production elicited by LPS and subsequently increases the PGs production which is involved in the <b>potentiating</b> <b>effect</b> of rCGRP on LPS-induced IL- 6 release from the peritoneal macrophages in the mouse...|$|E
40|$|Sensitization of vagal lung C-fibers (VLCFs) {{induced by}} {{mediators}} {{contributes to the}} pathogenesis of airway hypersensitivity, which is characterized by exaggerated sensory and reflex responses to stimulants. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) are mediators produced during airway inflammation. However, the role of ROS in VLCF-mediated airway hypersensitivity has remained elusive. Here, we report that inhalation of aerosolized 0. 05 % H 2 O 2 for 90 s potentiated apneic responses to intravenous capsaicin (a TRPV 1 receptor agonist), a,b-methylene-ATP (a P 2 X receptor agonist), and phenylbiguanide (a 5 -HT 3 receptor agonist) in anesthetized rats. The apneic responses to these three stimulants were abolished by vagatomy or by perivagal capsaicin treatment, a procedure that blocks the neural conduction of VLCFs. The <b>potentiating</b> <b>effect</b> of H 2 O 2 on the apneic responses to these VLCF stimulants was prevented by catalase (an enzyme that degrades H 2 O 2) and by dimethylthiourea (a hydroxyl radical scavenger). The <b>potentiating</b> <b>effect</b> of H 2 O 2 on the apneic responses to capsaicin was attenuated by HC- 030031 (a TRPA 1 receptor antagonist) and by iso-pyridoxalphosphate- 6 -azophenyl- 29, 59 -disulphonate (a P 2 X receptor antagonist).

40|$|Aims: In our {{previous}} work, we {{reported that the}} insulin <b>potentiating</b> <b>effect</b> on melatonin synthesis is regulated by a post-transcriptional mechanism. However, the major proteins of the insulin signaling pathway (ISP) and the possible pathway component recruited on the <b>potentiating</b> <b>effect</b> of insulin had not been characterized. A second question raised was whether windows of sensitivity to insulin exist in the pineal gland due to insulin rhythmic secretion pattern. Main methods: Melatonin content from norepinephrine(NE) -synchronized pineal gland cultures was quantified by high performance liquid chromatography with electrochemical detection and arylalkylamine-N-acetyltransferase (AANAT) activity was assayed by radiometry. Immunoblotting and immunoprecipitation techniques were performed to establish the ISP proteins expression {{and the formation of}} 14 - 3 - 3 : AANAT complex, respectively. Key findings: The temporal insulin susceptibility protocol revealed two periods of insulin <b>potentiating</b> <b>effect,</b> one at the beginning and another one {{at the end of the}} in vitro induced ""night"". In some Timed-insulin Stimulation (TSs), insulin also promoted a reduction on melatonin synthesis, showing its dual action in cultured pineal glands. The major ISP components, such as IR beta, IGF- 1 R, IRS- 1, IRS- 2 and PI 3 K(p 85), as well tyrosine phosphorylation of pp 85 were characterized within pineal glands. Insulin is not involved in the 14 - 3 - 3 :AANAT complex formation. The blockage of PI 3 K by LY 294002 reduced melatonin synthesis and AANAT activity. Significance: The present study demonstrated windows of differential insulin sensitivity, a functional ISP and the PI 3 K-dependent insulin <b>potentiating</b> <b>effect</b> on NE-mediated melatonin synthesis, supporting the hypothesis of a crosstalk between noradrenergic and insulin pathways in the rat pineal gland.

In serum-starved low (12 - 18) passage NIH 3 T 3 fibroblasts, 60 mM ethanol enhanced the mitogenic effect of insulin in the absence or presence of 25 microM zinc about 2 - or 12 -fold, respectively. In contrast, in serum-starved high (30 - 47) passage NIH 3 T 3 cells 60 mM ethanol had large (20 - 40 -fold) <b>potentiating</b> <b>effects</b> on insulin-induced DNA synthesis {{even in the absence of}} zinc. Furthermore, ethanol also enhanced the effects of PCho on DNA synthesis in both the absence and presence of insulin. The <b>potentiating</b> <b>effects</b> of ethanol on insulin- and PCho-induced DNA synthesis were associated with 1. 2 - 1. 3 -fold stimulation of cell proliferation. Rapamycin, an inhibitor of p 70 S 6 kinase action, strongly inhibited the <b>potentiating</b> <b>effects</b> of ethanol on insulin- and PCho-induced mitogenesis. Unexpectedly, ethanol inhibited synergistic activation of p 42 /p 44 mitogen-activated protein kinases by insulin and PCho. In both Swiss 3 T 3 and JB 6 cells, ethanol potentiated insulin-induced DNA synthesis only in the presence of zinc. In these cells, ethanol also increased the effects of PCho on both DNA synthesis and cell proliferation in the co-presence of either insulin or ATP. The results indicate that in various cell lines physiologically relevant concentrations of ethanol can increase the ability of insulin and PCho to induce DNA synthesis and, to smaller extents, cell proliferation.

40|$|Streptococcal {{pyrogenic}} exotoxin (SPE) dramatically potentiates {{the lethal}} shock induced by gram-negative bacterial endotoxin. To provide further {{understanding of the}} mechanism underlying the <b>potentiating</b> <b>effect,</b> the physiological basis for the toxic synergism of the two toxins was investigated. Pretreatment of rabbits with an intravenous (i. v.) dose (10 micrograms/kg of body weight) of SPE greatly enhanced the endotoxin lethality and reduced the 50 % lethal dose to less than 5 micrograms of endotoxin per kg. The SPE pretreatment dose caused severe pathophysiological changes in combination with a small i. v. dose of endotoxin (1 microgram/kg). These changes included transient hyperglycemia followed by profound hypoglycemia, elevation of the blood lipoperoxide level, and an acute increase in plasma beta-glucuronidase activity. These changes were comparable with those in animals given a large i. v. dose of endotoxin (100 micrograms/kg) alone. An injection of SPE alone did not alter any of the parameters described above. These results suggest that SPE renders rabbits more sensitive to extensive pathophysiologic effects of endotoxin, and the <b>potentiating</b> <b>effect</b> on endotoxin lethality may thus involve a general potentiation of physiologic failures.

However, this mechanism has never been formally demonstrated to date and is questioned by our previous data showing that intracerebral concentrations of MPP(+), the active metabolite of MPTP, are not modified by co-injection of probenecid. In this study, we investigated the <b>potentiating</b> <b>effects</b> of probenecid in vivo and in vitro arguing against the possibility of altered metabolism or impaired renal elimination of MPTP.
