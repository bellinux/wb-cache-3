2500|$|The Progressive Democrats' {{economic}} policies {{were based on}} economic liberalism. They supported the freedom of private enterprise and the lowering of taxes. They generally favoured privatisation; for example, they supported the privatisation of the previously state-owned airline Aer Lingus and communications company Telecom Éireann. They were {{also part of the}} break-up of airports company Aer Rianta and unsuccessfully lobbied for a private, competing second terminal in Dublin Airport. As acting PD leader and Minister for Health, Mary Harney was involved in the controversial extension of private-sector influence in health care. She pursued a policy of co-location of private hospitals on public hospital grounds and is seen as sympathetic to the privatisation of health insurance. However they opposed their coalition partner’s plans to privatise airports company Aer Rianta, on the grounds that a private monopoly would be worse than a <b>public</b> <b>monopoly.</b>|$|E
60|$|The Council, however, {{submitting}} to {{the opinion of}} this necessity, endeavored to render that dubious engagement as beneficial {{as possible to the}} Company. They began by putting up the contract to the highest bidder. The proposals were to be sealed. When the seals came to be opened, a very extraordinary scene appeared. Every step in this business develops more and more the effect of this junction of <b>public</b> <b>monopoly</b> and private influence. Four English and eight natives were candidates for the contract; three of the English far overbid the eight natives. They who consider that the natives, from their superior dexterity, from their knowledge of the country and of business, and from their extreme industry, vigilance, and parsimony, are generally an over-match for Europeans, and indeed are, and must ultimately be, employed by them in all transactions whatsoever, will find it very extraordinary that they did not by the best offers secure this dealing to themselves. It can be attributed to this cause, and this only,--that they were conscious, that, without power and influence to subdue the cultivators of the land to their own purposes, they never could afford to engage on the lowest possible terms. Those whose power entered into the calculation of their profits could offer, as they did offer, terms without comparison better; and therefore one of the English bidders, without partiality, secured the preference.|$|E
60|$|The sophisters and declaimers, {{as soon as}} the Assembly met, {{began with}} decrying the ancient {{constitution}} of the revenue in many of its most essential branches, such as the <b>public</b> <b>monopoly</b> of salt. They charged it, as truly as unwisely, with being ill-contrived, oppressive, and partial. This representation they were not satisfied to make use of in speeches preliminary to some plan of reform; they declared it in a solemn resolution or public sentence, as it were judicially passed upon it; and this they dispersed throughout the nation. At the time they passed the decree, with the same gravity they ordered the same absurd, oppressive, and partial tax to be paid, until they could find a revenue to replace it. The consequence was inevitable. The provinces which had been always exempted from this salt monopoly, some of whom were charged with other contributions, perhaps equivalent, were totally disinclined to bear any part of the burden, which by an equal distribution was to redeem the others. As to the Assembly, occupied as it was with the declaration and violation of the rights of men, and with their arrangements for general confusion, it had neither leisure nor capacity to contrive, nor authority to enforce, any plan of any kind relative to the replacing the tax, or equalizing it, or compensating the provinces, or for conducting their minds to any scheme of accommodation with the other districts which were to be relieved. The people of the salt provinces, impatient under taxes damned by the authority which had directed their payment, very soon found their patience exhausted. They thought themselves as skilful in demolishing as the Assembly could be. They relieved themselves by throwing off the whole burden. Animated by this example, each district, or part of a district, judging of its own grievance by its own feeling, and of its remedy by its own opinion, did as it pleased with other taxes.|$|E

40|$|Today we are {{witnessing}} the birth of more and more new markets because of the liberalisation of former public businesses or <b>public</b> <b>monopolies.</b> With this in mind, the background for this report was a need to understand consumer choices in markets that were formerly partly public businesses or <b>public</b> <b>monopolies</b> better. Based on a survey among {{a representative sample of}} the populations of Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Norway and Sweden, this report looks at three different markets in which individual consumers now have a free choice of services. The three markets are: Health services (general practitioners or specialists). Dental services. Pre-school children's day care. The report will uncover usage patterns and key reasons for consumer choices in these markets. In addition, the study will shed light on the level of consumer satisfaction with the services, the information accessible, and on consumer perceptions about their possibilities for complaint. Further more, the study will highlight significant differences on a Nordic level, on a country level and on a market level. Based on the survey results the report will comment on areas where there appears to be potential for improvement - either via more accessible information or an improved complaints process...|$|R

Both for reasons of efficiency (lower administrative and sales costs) and to reduce the scope of risk selection, <b>public</b> <b>monopolies</b> should play an important role on this market. A further major advantage of the monopoly solution is the fact, that public insurers have a strong incentive to actively participate in prevention. ...|$|R

50|$|In economics, a {{government}} monopoly (or <b>public</b> <b>monopoly)</b> {{is a form}} of coercive monopoly in which {{a government}} agency or government corporation is the sole provider of a particular good or service and competition is prohibited by law.

50|$|Liberalisation of {{electricity}} tends to substantially benefit large consumers (mainly industrial users), but benefits for domestic consumers {{compared with a}} <b>public</b> <b>monopoly</b> or a regulated private monopoly are questionable, as liberalisation has be shown to pass on supply costs onto consumers. There are also doubts over whether the system can ensure long-term security of supply through providing sufficient incentives to begin building generation capacity in time for when it is needed, an issue which has started to plague Britain in the mid-2010s as spare capacity has decreased significantly to just over 1.2 percent in 2015.|$|E
5000|$|A <b>public</b> <b>monopoly</b> on {{broadcasting}} in France {{had been}} established {{with the formation of}} Radiodiffusion Française (RDF) in 1945.

From the beginning, the public broadcaster experienced fierce competition from the [...] "peripheral stations": French-speaking stations aimed at the French public but transmitting on longwave from neighbouring countries, such as Radio Monte Carlo (RMC) from Monaco, Radio Luxembourg (later RTL) from Luxembourg, and Europe 1 from Germany (exceptionally, in 1974, RMC was allowed to set up a transmitter on French territory).|$|E

5000|$|The {{provision}} about [...] "licensing of broadcasting, {{television or}} cinema enterprises", i.e. the state’s right to license themedia companies, was included {{because of the}} limited number of available frequencies and the fact that, at that time, most European states had a monopoly of broadcasting and television. Later Court decision held that due to [...] "the technical progress in the last decades, the justification of these restrictions cannot be made by reference to the number of available frequencies and channels." [...] The <b>public</b> <b>monopolies</b> within the audiovisual media were seen by the Court as contrary to Article 10, primarily because they cannot provide a plurality of sources of information.|$|R

According to Pisano (2010 : 467): “After reading Chandler, it is hard to think about technological innovation as anything but tightly intertwined with organizational and institutional innovation.” A variety of governance structures emerged as well to orchestrate the co-evolution of new sciences and technologies, even though it is often assumed that the “free market” does all the institutional work (Nelson 2005). Emerging technologies like railroads, telephones, and electrical power required considerable government investment and involvement, along with “new” innovations such as <b>public</b> <b>monopolies</b> or eminent domain. But the centrality of strategic and institutional work for innovation tends to get pushed into the background.|$|R
