5|$|At a {{party in}} the Great Northern to welcome the new investors, Benjamin and Catherine Martell (Piper Laurie) {{secretly}} discuss their plan to burn the town's sawmill and buy the land cheaply. Leland begins sobbing hysterically when a <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> <b>music</b> begins, and Martell escorts him away. Meanwhile, Shelly waits {{at home with her}} gun, as Johnson arrives back. Hank attacks him beside his truck, threatening him; Johnson returns home and lashes out at Shelly, and she draws the gun and shoots him.|$|E
5|$|The author Mark Lewisohn {{reports that}} the Beatles held their first and only 24-hour session at Abbey Road {{near the end of}} the {{creation}} of The Beatles, which occurred during the final mixing and sequencing for the album. The session was attended by Lennon, McCartney and producer George Martin. Unlike most LPs, there was no customary three-second gap between tracks, and the master was edited so that songs segued together, via a straight edit, a crossfade, or an incidental <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> <b>music.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{developers}} refreshed Combat Evolveds {{music and}} sound effects {{along with its}} visuals. While players can toggle the original music from Halo: Combat Evolved, the soundtrack was also rerecorded in partnership with Pyramind Studios, using the 75-piece Skywalker Symphony Orchestra and the Chanticleer vocal ensemble. Because there were no MIDI recordings of the original game's music, Paul Lipson, Lennie Moore, Tom Salta, and Brian Trifon transcribed each <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> <b>music.</b>|$|E

5|$|The film's plot {{follows the}} hunt by the public-security agency Section 9 for a mysterious hacker {{known as the}} Puppet Master. With the {{assistance}} of her team, Motoko Kusanagi tracks and finds their suspect, only {{to be drawn into}} a complex sequence of political intrigue and a cover-up as to the identity and goals of the Puppet Master. The overarching philosophical themes of the film include self-identity in a technologically advanced world. The music, composed by Kenji Kawai, includes an ancient Japanese language in a wedding song that serves as a key <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> <b>music</b> leading up to the climax of the film.|$|E
5|$|Thick as a Brick is {{the fifth}} studio album by the British rock band Jethro Tull, {{released}} in March 1972. The album contains a continuous <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> <b>music,</b> split over two sides of an LP record, and was deliberately designed to parody the concept album genre. The original packaging, designed like a newspaper, claims the album to be a musical adaptation of an epic poem by the fictional 8-year-old genius Gerald Bostock, though the lyrics were actually written by the band's frontman, Ian Anderson.|$|E
5|$|The game's setting {{stemmed from}} the idea of players being able to create and control a group of obedient creatures. The Shapers and the world of Geneforge were the result of Vogel imagining how would a being possess such power and how would they use it. The game's setting, a mixture of science fiction and fantasy, differs from the pure science fiction setting the game had been envisioned as. Vogel had {{difficulties}} balancing gameplay with the powerful directed-energy weapons players would expect to use in a science fiction game. Sales exceeded the developer's expectations, despite fears that the departure from Spiderweb's Avernum series would deter players. Geneforge received a positive reception from reviewers, despite the quality of the graphics being rated as poor and the game containing one <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> <b>music,</b> the title theme. The plot and setting were praised by reviewers for uniqueness and detail.|$|E
50|$|Possibly {{the oldest}} {{surviving}} music from Sussex is the 14th century Robertsbridge Codex which contains six <b>pieces</b> <b>of</b> <b>music.</b> This manuscript contains one <b>of</b> the earliest <b>pieces</b> <b>of</b> <b>music</b> specifically {{written for the}} keyboard. The Robertsbridge Codex is also the earliest evidence of two handed, polyphonic organ music and dates from around 1325.|$|R

5|$|The {{most famous}} <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> <b>music</b> {{influenced}} by astrology is the orchestral suite The Planets. Written by the British composer Gustav Holst (1874–1934), and first performed in 1918, {{the framework of}} The Planets {{is based upon the}} astrological symbolism of the planets. Each of the seven movements of the suite is based upon a different planet, though the movements are not in the order of the planets from the Sun. The composer Colin Matthews wrote an eighth movement entitled Pluto, the Renewer, first performed in 2000. In 1937, another British composer, Constant Lambert, wrote a ballet on astrological themes, called Horoscope. In 1974, the New Zealand composer Edwin Carr wrote The Twelve Signs: An Astrological Entertainment for orchestra without strings. Camille Paglia acknowledges astrology as an influence on her work of literary criticism Sexual Personae (1990).|$|E
5|$|The {{music and}} {{instruments}} in each level {{were chosen to}} correspond to the game world and the level's placement in the overall emotional arc. The music is composed of multiple layers of acoustic instrument tracks that rise and fall in correlation with the player's actions. The instruments used include pianos, string instruments such as classical guitars, and woodwinds such as bass flutes and bassoons. The number of instruments playing increases in correlation {{with the amount of}} petals that the player gathers. The music is meant to suggest natural sounds like wind. The instrument tracks were intended to be able to stand on their own, even when used in a large orchestrated group as in levels three and six. Several times in the development process, Diamante became so attached to a <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> <b>music</b> that needed alteration that he composed a new piece to replace it. Diamante was long in talks with Sony to produce an album of music from the game. On April 8, 2010 a soundtrack album was released by Sony for purchase on the PlayStation Network. The album, titled Flower: Original Soundtrack from the Video Game, contains 8 tracks with a total duration of 1:04:37.|$|E

25|$|In 1985, Jarre was {{contacted}} by the musical director of the Houston Grand Opera with the proposal for him related to the celebrations of Texas' 150th birthday in 1986, 150th birthday {{of the city of}} Houston and NASA's 25th birthday. Because of NASA's involvement, Jarre got the chance to keep in contact with a friend of his, astronaut captain Bruce McCandless II who later introduced Jarre to a flight companion of his, astronaut and jazz musician Ron McNair. Together they had the idea that for the celebrations, Jarre would create a <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> <b>music</b> that could be performed by McNair on his saxophone. The idea was that McNair, on his next trip into space in the Challenger Space Shuttle, would perform (and record onto video) the new <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> <b>music,</b> which would then be projected (through video playback) onto a giant screen that was to be constructed on the front of one of the buildings.|$|E
25|$|The tune Lillibullero {{is another}} well known {{signature}} tune {{of the network}} following its broadcast previously {{as part of the}} top-of-the-hour sequence. This <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> <b>music</b> is still heard before certain bulletins and as a shortened version elsewhere, but it is used less often than previously. The use of the tune has gained some controversy because of its background as a Protestant marching song in Northern Ireland.|$|E
25|$|Creating {{the music}} for the series was a {{deliberate}} attempt to deviate from the standard for animated cartoons, which traditionally followed the works of Carl Stalling. The most complicated <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> <b>music</b> created for the series was for the opening sequence, which was recorded preceding animation, rather than the typical method of composing it afterward. Newman's scat singing plays over transitions in the series. The show also incorporated homemade sound effects.|$|E
