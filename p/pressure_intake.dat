The results show that the standard air intake system resulted in rich combustion which led to the incomplete combustion due to less availability of air. By eliminating the air filter, the air flow restriction through the air intake system was reduced. Hence, better combustion and less unburned components are achieved because of higher air availability. A higher air <b>intake</b> <b>pressure</b> is required to increase air density in allowing for better combustion within a limited time to improve fuel economy, power output and exhaust emissions.

The method introduces a thermally transient condition and uses temperature measurements to extract the adiabatic efficiency and internal convective heat transfer coefficient simultaneously, thus capturing the aerodynamic and thermal performance. The procedure has been implemented both in simulation and experimentally on a typical turbocharger gas stand facility. Under ideal conditions, the new identification predicted adiabatic efficiency to within 1 %point 1 and heat transfer coefficient to within 1 %. A sensitivity study subsequently showed that the method is particularly sensitive to the assumptions of heat transfer distribution pre and post compression. If 20 % of the internal area of the compressor housing is exposed to the low <b>pressure</b> <b>intake</b> gas, {{and this is not}} correctly assumed in the identification process, errors of 7 - 15 %points were observed for compressor efficiency.

This master thesis approaches the problem by attempting to model the exhaust gas temperature by using the standard sensors equipped in SI engines, together with an in-cylinder pressure sensor which is {{needed in order to}} develop certain models. The concept in the master thesis is based upon a parameterization of the ideal Otto cycle with tuning parameters which all have physical meanings. Input variables required for the parameterization model is obtained from a fix point iteration method. This method was developed in order to improve the estimates of residual gas fraction, residual gas temperature and variables dependent of those, such as temperature at intake valve closing. The mean value model of the temperature, at the exhaust valve, is based upon the assumption of the ideal gas law, and that the burned gases undergoe a polytropic expansion into the exhaust manifold. Input variables to the entire model are intake manifold pressure, exhaust manifold <b>pressure,</b> <b>intake</b> manifold temperature, engine speed, air mass flow, cylinder pressure, air-to-fuel equivalence ratio, volume, and ignition timing. A useful aspect with modeling the exhaust gas temperature is the possibility to implement it in turbo modeling.

40|$|Transportation {{accounted}} for 28 % {{of the total}} U. S. energy demand in 2011, with 93 % of U. S. transportation energy coming from petroleum. The large impact of the transportation sector on global climate change necessitates more-efficient, cleaner-burning internal combustion engine operating strategies. One such strategy that has received substantial research attention {{in the last decade}} is Homogeneous Charge Compression Ignition (HCCI). Although the efficiency and emissions benefits of HCCI are well established, practical limits on the operating range of HCCI engines have inhibited their application in consumer vehicles. One such limit is at high load, where the pressure rise rate in the combustion chamber becomes excessively large. Fuel stratification is a potential strategy for reducing the maximum pressure rise rate in HCCI engines. The aim is to introduce reactivity gradients through fuel stratification to promote sequential auto-ignition rather than a bulk-ignition, as in the homogeneous case. A gasoline-fueled compression ignition engine with fuel stratification is termed a Gasoline Compression Ignition (GCI) engine. Although a reasonable amount of experimental research has been performed for fuel stratification in GCI engines, a clear understanding of how the fundamental in-cylinder processes of fuel spray evaporation, mixing, and heat release contribute to the observed phenomena is lacking. Of particular interest is gasoline's pressure sensitive low-temperature chemistry and how it impacts the sequential auto-ignition of the stratified charge. In order to computationally study GCI with fuel stratification using three-dimensional computational fluid dynamics (CFD) and chemical kinetics, two reduced mechanisms have been developed. The reduced mechanisms were developed from a large, detailed mechanism with about 1400 species for a 4 -component gasoline surrogate. The two versions of the reduced mechanism developed in this work are: (1) a 96 -species version and (2) a 98 -species version including nitric oxide formation reactions. Development of reduced mechanisms is necessary because the detailed mechanism is computationally prohibitive in three-dimensional CFD and chemical kinetics simulations. Simulations of Partial Fuel Stratification (PFS), a GCI strategy, have been performed using CONVERGE with the 96 -species reduced mechanism developed in this work for a 4 -component gasoline surrogate. Comparison is made to experimental data from the Sandia HCCI/GCI engine at a compression ratio 14 : 1 at <b>intake</b> <b>pressures</b> of 1 bar and 2 bar. Analysis of the heat release and temperature in the different equivalence ratio regions reveals that sequential auto-ignition of the stratified charge occurs in order of increasing equivalence ratio for 1 bar <b>intake</b> <b>pressure</b> and in order of decreasing equivalence ratio for 2 bar <b>intake</b> <b>pressure.</b> Increased low- and intermediate-temperature heat release with increasing equivalence ratio at 2 bar <b>intake</b> <b>pressure</b> compensates for decreased temperatures in higher-equivalence ratio regions due to evaporative cooling from the liquid fuel spray and decreased compression heating from lower values of the ratio of specific heats. The presence of low- and intermediate-temperature heat release at 2 bar <b>intake</b> <b>pressure</b> alters the temperature distribution of the mixture stratification before hot-ignition, promoting the desired sequential auto-ignition. At 1 bar <b>intake</b> <b>pressure,</b> the sequential auto-ignition occurs in the reverse order compared to 2 bar <b>intake</b> <b>pressure</b> and too fast for useful reduction of the maximum pressure rise rate compared to HCCI. Additionally, the premixed portion of the charge auto-ignites before the highest-equivalence ratio regions. Conversely, at 2 bar <b>intake</b> <b>pressure,</b> the premixed portion of the charge auto-ignites last, after the higher-equivalence ratio regions. More importantly, the sequential auto-ignition occurs over a longer time period for 2 bar <b>intake</b> <b>pressure</b> than at 1 bar <b>intake</b> <b>pressure</b> such that a sizable reduction in the maximum pressure rise rate compared to HCCI can be achieved...|$|R

These components are utilised for precondition and aftertreatment of air, fuel and exhaust gas, which {{is involved in}} the combustion process. In this dissertation a methodology for a model-based function development with semi-physical engine models for control of air path quantities of an exemplary Diesel engine with high-pressure (HP-EGR) and low-pressure exhaust gas recirculation (LP-EGR) is developed. In this framework for function development black-box models for stationary and dynamical emission formation are utilised to optimise reference values for the air path control and to rate the developed control scheme with regard to the cumulated driving cycle emissions of the new European driving cycle (NEDC). A combination of HP-EGR and LP-EGR represents a novel approach to significantly lower the particulate and NOx emissions of Diesel engines. A semi-physical mean value engine model with lumped parameters is the base to analyse the system properties of the complex air path. In doing so, the additional LP-EGR shows only minor influences to the quantities charge air pressure and HP-EGR, while there are significant influences of these quantities on the LP-EGR mass flow rate. Furthermore, the LP-EGR is characterised by significant gas propagation times in the intake and exhaust system. These delays are modelled by a gas composition model, which is incorporated into the control scheme.

TITLE: DEVELOPMENT AND PERFORMANCE EVALUATION OF A MONO-VALVE ENGINE MAJOR PROFESSOR: Dr. Suri Rajan A new Mono-Valve engine head was fabricated and assembled for a standard 4 -stroke single cylinder Two-Valve gasoline engine with an aim {{to achieve an}} improved air flow characteristics {{than that of the}} Two-Valve engine. The Mono-Valve engine has only one valve in the cylinder head with the intake and exhaust ports controlled by an auxiliary Rotary-Valve. The two engines were tested under cold flow motoring conditions at engine speeds ranging from 1000 to 2500 rpm under fully open and half open throttle conditions in order to study and compare their volumetric efficiencies. Variable intake pipe lengths of 8. 25, 25. 5 and 39 inches were used to study their effect on volumetric efficiencies and in-cylinder pressure characteristics of both the engines. The results of the experiments showed that the average in-cylinder peak <b>pressure,</b> <b>intake</b> and exhaust pressures characteristics are similar for both the engine heads. However, the volumetric efficiency of the new Mono-Valve engine head was found to be 2 - 7 % less than that of the original Two-Valve engine head depending upon the length of the intake pipe. This is mainly due to the opening angle in the Rotary-Valve that mostly controls the duration of the intake and the exhaust processes, and also due to the timing of the opening and closing of the intake and exhaust ports...|$|E
40|$|Diesel/gasoline dual-fuel {{combustion}} uses both {{gasoline and}} diesel fuel in diesel engines to exploit their different reactivities. This operation combines {{the advantages of}} diesel fuel and gasoline while avoiding their disadvantages, attains spatially stratified low temperature combustion (LTC), and yields very low NOx and PM emissions while maintaining good efficiency. It is promising in solving the problems of conventional LTC through better control of ignition and combustion. The benefits of dual-fuel operation and the potential of using gasoline fumigation to realize these benefits provide the major motivation to this research. This research is aimed at using gasoline fumigation in a medium-duty diesel engine to identify and quantify the influencing factors of diesel/gasoline dual-fuel LTC on engine efficiency and emissions. The factors include gasoline fraction, injection settings, rail <b>pressure,</b> <b>intake</b> pressure, and EGR level. This objective was realized {{through a series of}} experimental tests done at 1400 rpm and three loads, including both diesel baseline tests and dual-fuel tests. First, design of experiments and relevant statistical techniques were applied to tests. Twenty-three best models between 6 factors (intake pressure, rail pressure, SOI for diesel baseline tests, SOI for dual-fuel tests, EGR level, and gasoline fraction) and 5 targets (efficiency, NOx, smoke number, HC, and CO) were obtained through regression of test data. Confirmation tests were done based on best models. Generally, the observations are improved NOx and smoke emissions, but unimproved or deteriorated efficiency, HC and CO emissions. The optimization effort makes some achievements, but needs further improvement. The influence of each factor is analyzed. The measures to get better models are explained. Second, parametric studies of gasoline fraction and injection timing were done to find their influence on efficiency and emissions. Efficiency generally decreases slightly as gasoline fraction increases or injection timing is retarded. Generally, increasing gasoline fraction is beneficial for NOx and smoke emissions, but HC and CO emissions deteriorate. An advance in injection timing, however, has the opposite influence. Finally, individual cycle data were analyzed to study cyclic variability (CV) and its influence on dual-fuel efficiency and emissions. Factors causing or influencing CV were identified. The CV in dual-fuel operation is more serious than that in diesel operation, in terms of magnitude. Most of the test data studied do not have strong determinism, and the influence of gasoline addition is small...|$|E

In addition, the EPA and NHTSA have recently established fuel economy and green house gas emission standards which require the diesel engine to be more efficient than ever before. Premixed charge compression ignition (PCCI) is an advanced combustion mode that can reduce PM and NOx emissions and maintain, or even improve, the engine efficiency. However, there are several factors, including mixing timing, pressure rise rate and gas exchange that limit the PCCI operating range. In order to extend the effective PCCI operating range, this study was performed as a continuation of work conducted by the author 2 ̆ 7 s colleagues. Specifically, this effort focuses on numerically identifying, and experimentally validating, the high load limit of effective PCCI. ^ This thesis first presents results for the calibration of a GT-Power engine model. This model was then utilized to run several design of experiments (DOEs) with four different input variables, including the VGT position, rail <b>pressure,</b> <b>intake</b> valve closing timing (IVC), and start of injection (SOI). Regression models were created {{based on the results}} from the DOEs. These models were then used to optimally determine the required inputs for effective PCCI. ^ Strict engine-out emissions were set as constraints for effective PCCI. Specifically, bsNOx, bsPM, bsUHC, and bsCO must be less than 0. 2, 0. 1, 7, and 775 g/hp-hr, respectively. Air-fuel ratio and the overlap between start of combustion and end of injection (SOC-EOI) in the simulation were considered as proxies for these emission constraints. Pressure rise rate (PRR) was used as a proxy for noise. The optimization targeted maximizing torque at a given speed and fueling amount without violating any the following constraints: AFR≥ 18, SOC-EOI≥- 2 °CA, PRR 3 ̆c 100 bar/ms. To be classified as effective PCCI, the optimal result must also maintain, or improve, brake thermal efficiency (BTE) compared to conventional operation at the same speed and fueling point. ^ The final results from this study indicated that BTE limited effective PCCI operation at 800 rpm, which was also illustrated by the author 2 ̆ 7 s colleagues 2 ̆ 7 prior experimental work. However, this study, both numerically and experimentally, demonstrated an increase in the maximum achievable effective PCCI load from 5. 2 to 7. 3 bar BMEP at 1200 rpm by utilizing late SOI, high rail pressure, fully opened EGR valve, and early IVC. This finding is profound, as 1200 rpm 7. 3 bar BMEP corresponds to the highway cruise condition for modern class 8 trucks. This result demonstrates that the combination of late SOI (after top dead center) and IVC modulation enables highway cruise operation with no engine fuel penalty and EPA-compliant engine out NOx emissions, suggesting that urea consumption during cruise can be eliminated. At 1600 rpm, the numerical work indicated that, using a similar strategy, the maximum effective PCCI load can be increased from 4. 4 to 5. 5 bar BMEP. ...|$|E

40|$|AbstractA {{study to}} extend the low load limit {{of the mixture of}} {{commercial}} gasoline and diesel in the compression mode is performed on a single cylinder diesel engine. The additional measures, like intake heating, rebreathing, negative valve overlap, are not employed. By adopting boosting, sweeping the injection pressure and varying the fuel octane number, the minimum fuelling rate and the minimum IMEP gained is compared. Besides, the thermal efficiency and emission results at these operation points are also discussed. The results illustrate that the high <b>intake</b> <b>pressure,</b> the low injection pressure and the low fuel octane number are very effective to extend low load limit. With these strategies, gasoline-type fuels can get the lowest load 0. 07 MPa IMEP (0. 14 MPa <b>intake</b> <b>pressure</b> and 20 MPa injection pressure) and successfully replace diesel at low load operation points in the compression mode. Increasing the <b>intake</b> <b>pressure</b> and reducing the injection pressure can significantly reduce the minimum fuelling rate and then the minimum IMEP. The minimum IMEP (0. 34 MPa) of the calibration point on the original engine at test speed (1600 rpm) can be achieved by G 80 without boosting. The combustion efficiency is influenced by the <b>intake</b> <b>pressure</b> and the injection pressure, however, the ISFC is more dependent on the engine load rather than other factors. If there is more over-lean mixture in cylinder when adjusting the experimental conditions, CO and HC emissions are higher. To satisfy the Euro VI regulation on NOx (< 0. 4 g/kWh), a small amount of EGR is needed to control NOx emission...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: One of the {{effective}} ways to reduce both NOx and PM {{at the same time}} in a diesel CI engine is to operate the engine in low temperature combustion (LTC) regimes. In general, two strategies are used to realize the LTC operation-dilution controlled LTC and late injection LTC- and in this study, the former approach was used. In the dilution controlled regime, LTC is achieved by supplying a large amount of EGR to the cylinder. The significant EGR gas increases the heat capacity of in-cylinder charge mixture while decreasing oxygen concentration of the charge, activating low temperature oxidation reaction and lowering PM and NOx emissions. However, use of high EGR levels also deteriorates combustion efficiency and engine power output. Therefore, it is widely considered to use increased <b>intake</b> <b>pressure</b> as a way to resolve this issue. In this study, the effects of <b>intake</b> <b>pressure</b> variations on performance and emission characteristics of a single cylinder diesel engine operated in LTC regimes were examined. LTC operation was achieved in less than 8 % O 2 concentration and thus a simultaneous reduction of both PM and NOx emission was confirmed. As <b>intake</b> <b>pressure</b> increased, combustion efficiency was improved so that THC and CO emissions were decreased. A shift of the peak Soot location was also observed to lower O 2 concentration while NOx levels were kept nearly zero. In addition, an elevation of <b>intake</b> <b>pressure</b> enhanced engine power output as well as indicated thermal efficiency in LTC regimes. All these result...|$|R
40|$|International audienceEnvironmental {{issues and}} respect for the European Union's {{objectives}} for green house emissions reduction, has required an improved in the sophistication of control strategies. This article focuses on the control of the air path diesel engine. Most studies consider the following control setup: <b>intake</b> <b>pressure</b> and <b>intake</b> air flow are controlled using EGR and VGT valves. A simple state feddback control law strategy based on a nonlinear control Lyapunov function and D-stabilisation is proposed. LMI terms have been developed. The goal is to achieve the reference tracking of desired values of <b>intake</b> and exhaust <b>pressures.</b> First at all, a description of the airpath system is given, then, the mean value model of the diesel engine is presented and converted into a Takagi-Sugeno'model. The model was validated with the AMEsim software. Finally, to ensure the performance of the proposed approach, simulation results are presented...|$|R
