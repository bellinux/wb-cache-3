40|$|In {{this paper}} {{it is argued}} that we should amend the {{traditional}} understanding of the view known as the guise of the good. The guise of the good is traditionally understood as the view that we only want to act in ways that we believe to be good in some way. But {{it is argued that}} a more plausible view is that we only want to act in ways that we believe we have normative reason to act in. This change – from formulating the view in terms of goodness to formulating it in terms of reasons – is significant because the revised view avoids various old and new counterexamples to the traditional view, because the revised view is better motivated than the traditional view, and because the revised view is better placed to explain certain features of desire than the traditional view.

Then Hake and his men rode to Sigurd's house, where they took his daughter Ragnhild and her brother Guthorm, and carried them, with much property and valuable articles, home to Hadeland, where Hake had many great farms.

The {{solution}} of some {{problems of a}} blast furnace smelting process, having theoretical and practical significance, in which influence of pressure in a blast furnace on <b>passing</b> <b>of</b> the phenomena of gas dynamics, heat interchange, mass transfer along height and radius of a blast furnace is considered.

If thermal processes define a fuel rate at reduction of an iron-ore material in metallurgical unit velocity of processes of reduction defines productivity of furnace.
