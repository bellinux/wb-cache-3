50|$|The estate lies by the River Thames on the {{historic}} highway from Staines to Windsor, near Runnymede. It was originally known as Remenham, after Hugo de Remenham, {{who held the}} land {{at the end of}} the 14th century. The estate was then owned for a period by <b>the</b> <b>Tyle</b> family, and subsequently by John Morley, Francis Kibblewhite, William Christmas and Henry Frederick Thynne (clerk to the Privy Council under Charles II) in the 17th century. In 1714 Thomas Thynne, 2nd Viscount Weymouth, inherited the estate. In the mid-eighteenth century it was acquired by Sophia, Duchess of Kent. In 1751 the Duke of Roxburghe purchased the land for his eldest son, the Marquess of Bowmont and Cessford (then a boy at Eton College), and renamed it Beaumont in his honour. In 1786 Warren Hastings, the first Governor-General of India, acquired Beaumont Lodge at the cost of £12,000. He lived at Beaumont for three years. In 1789 the estate was sold to Henry Griffith, an Anglo-Indian, who had the Windsor architect Henry Emlyn rebuild the house in 1790 as a nine-bay mansion with a substantial portico.|$|R

This house they spoyled for wrathe they bare to the prior of St. John's, unto whom it belonged, and, {{after a number of}} them had sacked this Temple, what with labour and what with wine being overcome, they lay down under the walls and housing,, and were slain like swyne, one of them killing another for old grudge and hatred, and others also made quick dispatch of them. A number of them that burnt the Temple went from thence to the Savoy, destroying in their way all the houses that belonged to the Hospital of St. John.John Baker thinks that the inhabitants took the opportunity to rebuild much of the Temple, and that this was when the Temple's Hall was built, since it contained 14th century roofing {{that would not have been}} available to the Knights Templar. The Inns of Court were similarly attacked in Jack Cade's rebellion, although there are no specific records showing damage to the Inner Temple.|$|R

60|$|Having hinted {{somewhat}} {{of the skin}} and covering of terrestrial Animals, I shall next add an Observation I made on the skin and Scales of a Soal, a small Fish, commonly enough known; and here in Fishes, {{as well as other}} Animals, Nature follows its usual method, framing all parts so, as that they are both usefull and ornamental in all its composures, mingling utile and dulce together; and both these designs it seems to follow, though our unassisted senses are not able to peceive them: This is not onely manifest in the covering of this Fish, but in multitudes of others, which it would be too long to enumerate, witness particularly that small Sand Shell, which I mention'd in the XI. Observation, and infinite other small Shells and Scales, divers of which I have view'd. This skin I view'd, was flead from a pretty large Soal, and then expanded and dry'd, the inside of it, when dry, to the naked eye, look'd very like a piece of Canvass, but the Microscope discover'd that texture to be nothing else, but the inner ends of those curious Scolop'd Scales I, I, I, in the second Figure of the XXI. Scheme, namely, the part of GGGG (of the larger representation of a single Scale, in the first Figure of the same Scheme) which on the back side, through an ordinary single Magnifying Glass, look'd not unlike <b>the</b> <b>Tyles</b> on an house.|$|R
