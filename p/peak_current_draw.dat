40|$|Increases in <b>peak</b> <b>current</b> <b>draw</b> and {{reductions}} in the oper-ating voltages of processors continue to amplify the impor-tance of dealing with voltage fluctuations in processors. One approach suggested has been to not only react to these fluc-tuations but also attempt to eliminate future occurrences of these fluctuations by dynamically modifying the execut-ing program. This paper investigates the potential of a very simple dynamic scheme to appreciably reduce the num-ber of run-time voltage emergencies. It shows that we can map many of the voltage emergencies in {{the execution of the}} SPEC 2000 benchmarks on an aggressive superscalar de-sign to a few static loops, categorize the microarchitectural cause of the emergencies in each important loop through simple observations and a simple priority function, and fi-nally apply straightforward software optimization strategies to mitigate up to 70 % of the future voltage swings...|$|E
40|$|Increases in <b>peak</b> <b>current</b> <b>draw</b> and {{reductions}} in the operating voltage of processors {{stress the importance of}} dealing with voltage fluctuations in processors. Noise-margin violations lead to undesired effects, like timing violations, which may result in incorrect execution of applications. Several recent architectural solutions for inductive noise have been proposed that, unfortunately, have a strong correlation to the underlying power-delivery package model and require a feedback loop that is largely constrained by the voltage/current sensor characteristics. The resulting solutions are not robust across a wide range of microprocessor designs and packaging technologies. This paper proposes a Delayed-Commit and Rollback scheme (DeCoR) that guarantees correctness, insensitive to the package model or the responsiveness of the voltage sensors. In particular, our approach recovers from, rather than attempting to avoid, voltage emergencies. This approach incurs a small performance penalty when compared to an ideal machine that does not have voltage emergencies. We show that explicit checkpoint-recovery schemes, intended to handle infrequent events, e. g., radiation-induced soft errors, suffer from large performance overheads for frequently-occurring voltage emergencies. DeCoR requires very few modifications to modern processor designs, as it leverages the existing store queue and reorder buffers. Unlike conventional designs that conservatively protect all components of the processor from inductive noise with overly-large timing margins, our approach only requires conservative protection of the architected register state and cache write paths. 1...|$|E

40|$|Simultaneous {{switching}} {{events in}} the clock lines and the signals passing through sequential and combinational logic elements cause large and voltage variations in the power and ground network. This is known as power supply noise and it affects the performance and reliability of the entire circuit. In this paper, we propose an algorithm that performs clock skew scheduling to minimize the number of simultaneous switching events such that the power supply noise is suppressed. Our approach establishes a direct relationship between <b>current</b> (<b>drawn</b> by a circuit element, sequential or combinational) and skew by the concept of envelope waveforms, using a graphical representation. We provide a graphbased scheduling approach to reduce the <b>peak</b> <b>current</b> and to minimize {{the difference between the}} <b>current</b> <b>peaks</b> and valleys such that the current profile of the entire circuit is smoothened. Our approach also guarantees that the resulting clock schedule does not violate setup and hold time constraints. Experimental results on benchmark circuits show an average reduction of 19. 6 % in the <b>peak</b> <b>current,</b> an average reduction of 38. 7 % in the current swing, and an average reduction of 47. 4 % in voltage variations in the power lines. 1...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—Power supply {{noise is}} {{fundamentally}} caused by large <b>current</b> <b>peaks.</b> Since large <b>current</b> <b>peaks</b> are induced by simultaneous switching of many circuit elements, power supply noise can be minimized by deliberate clock scheduling which utilizes nonzero clock skew. In this paper, nonzero skew clock scheduling {{is used to}} avoid the large <b>peak</b> <b>current</b> and consequently reduce power supply noise. While previous approaches require extra characterization efforts to acquire current waveform of a circuit, we approximate it only with existing cell library information to be easily adapted to conventional design flow. A simulated annealing based algorithm is performed, and the <b>peak</b> <b>current</b> values are estimated for feasible clock schedules found by the algorithm. The clock schedule with the minimum <b>peak</b> <b>current</b> is selected for a solution. Experimental results on ISCAS 89 benchmark circuits show that the proposed method can effectively reduce the <b>peak</b> <b>current.</b> Index Terms—Power supply noise, clock scheduling, <b>peak</b> <b>current,</b> current waveform estimation, cell library I...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Electrical {{discharge}} machining (EDM) is a non-conventional machining process where materials are removed by the thermal energy exerted from series of electrical sparks. This process is applied for machining of non-conductive alumina (Al 2 O 3). The workpiece {{is covered with}} the adhesive copper foil to initiate the initial spark between the workpiece and the tool electrode. A pyrolytic carbon (PyC) layer is generated on workpiece surface by dissociating kerosene dielectric after the machining of initial copper assisting electrode (AE) layer. In this study, experiments were performed by varying the <b>peak</b> <b>current</b> and keeping other parameters constant in order to investigate the effect of <b>peak</b> <b>current</b> on material removal rate (MRR) in EDM of Al 2 O 3.

The micro-EDM machining parameters includes, <b>peak</b> <b>current</b> and pulse on time. Fuzzy analysis was developed to evaluate the machining accuracy.
