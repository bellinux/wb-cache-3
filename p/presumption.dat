5|$|Even if a {{differentiating}} {{measure is}} found, {{there is a}} strong <b>presumption</b> that it is constitutional. The legislature must necessarily have a wide power of classification in making laws that operate differently for different groups of people in order to give effect to its policy. Unless the law is plainly arbitrary, suggesting examples of arbitrariness are not ordinarily helpful in rebutting this <b>presumption</b> of constitutionality. It is presumed that Parliament knows best for its people, and is experienced in making laws directed at societal problems, hence its differentiation is based on adequate grounds. Therefore, to rebut this <b>presumption</b> it is necessary for the person challenging the law to adduce some material or factual evidence to show that it was enacted arbitrarily or had operated arbitrarily.|$|E

5|$|It is a crime, {{while in}} a {{security}} area, to consort with or {{to be found in}} the company of a person carrying or having possession of or having under his or her control a firearm, ammunition or explosive in contravention of the offence mentioned above, if the circumstances raise a reasonable <b>presumption</b> that the person consorting intends or is about to act or has recently acted with the person having the item in a manner prejudicial to public security or the maintenance of public order. The penalty is either death or life imprisonment. It is a slightly less serious offence to be in a security area and consort with or be in the company of another person if it is reasonable for the person consorting to know that the other person had one of the above items. The penalty for this offence is imprisonment not exceeding ten years. If a person is carrying or has in his or her possession or under his or her control a firearm, ammunition or explosive, there is a rebuttable <b>presumption</b> that the person was acting in contravention of the offence mentioned above.|$|E

40|$|Canadian {{evidence}} scholars frequently {{claim that}} conclusive <b>presumptions</b> {{are nothing more}} than substantive offence definitions. This position reflects a persistent confusion, not about the function of legal <b>presumptions</b> in the law of evidence, but about the function of offence definitions beyond the law of evidence. Offence definitions, unlike conclusive <b>presumptions,</b> serve the normative function of defining wrongful conduct for citizens. This commentary argues that the language of conclusive <b>presumptions</b> allows us to distinguish the gravamen of a criminal offence from a means of facilitating proof of that wrong. It is, to that extent, worth preserving the distinction between conclusive <b>presumptions</b> and offence definitions...|$|R

5|$|Nevertheless, {{because the}} judge is {{empowered}} to disregard previous judgments (either his own or of other judges) and can apply his personal interpretation of Sharia to any particular case through ijtihad, divergent judgements arise even in apparently identical cases. There is a <b>presumption</b> against overturning a decision when {{it is based on}} ijtihad. This principle is crucial in two respects. Firstly, it concentrates the substance of the law in the hands of judges as, in consequence, there is a <b>presumption</b> that only a judge exercising ijtihad, rather than a king or a parliament, can determine God's law. Secondly, it renders a judge's decision practically immune to reversal on appeal. The role of ijtihad has led to calls for the Sharia to be codified to give clarity and remove uncertainty. As a result, in 2010, the Minister of Justice announced plans to implement a codification of Sharia law, although resistance from the religious establishment is reportedly delaying its implementation.|$|E

40|$|This note argues that, in {{developing}} the contemporary mandatory-permissive standard, the Supreme Court has misunderstood the effects of <b>presumptions</b> on juries. <b>Presumptions</b> that are ‘permissive’ in theory may nevertheless be ‘mandatory’ in fact, thereby leading some juries to convict regardless of their beliefs and inclinations. Thus, these legal <b>presumptions</b> may undermine the moral sense and political function of the jury. Part I of this note shows, through doctrinal analysis, that the mandatory-permissive distinction is an anomaly in the Court 2 ̆ 7 s jurisprudence. Part II shows that this distinction is at variance with a substantial body of empirical social science research. This part suggests that jurors are influenced significantly by the authority-laden legal structure surrounding judicial instructions on all presumptions—however permissive in theory. Part III proposes that the distinction between ‘mandatory’ and ‘permissive’ <b>presumptions</b> be abandoned, and that ‘reasonable-doubt’ due process scrutiny 8 be applied to all <b>presumptions.</b> This proposal would help to prevent the improper use of <b>presumptions</b> and ensure that jury verdicts reflect jurors 2 ̆ 7 actual beliefs...|$|R

Hence, the test is only applicable if the object of the impugned legislation is a proper one.|$|E
5|$|According to Béla Miklós Szőke's theory, the {{detailed}} description of the Magyars by western contemporary sources and the immediate Hungarian intervention in local wars give the <b>presumption</b> that the Hungarians had already lived on the eastern territories of the Carpathian Basin since the middle of the 9th century. Regarding the right location of early Hungarian settlements, the Arabic geographer al-Jayhani (only snippets of his work survived in other Muslim authors' papers) in the 870s placed the Hungarians between Don and Danube rivers. Szőke identifies al-Jayhani's Danube with the middle Danube region, as opposed to the previously assumed lower Danube region, because following al-Jayhani's description the Christian Moravians were the western neighbors of the Magyars.|$|E

40|$|This chapter {{seeks to}} make sense of the {{existence}} of such rules and <b>presumptions</b> and their potential with a view to contributing to debates on a more coordinated or structured enforcement of abuse regulation provisions on a global scale. With that purpose, it compares the setup and role of legal <b>presumptions</b> of dominance/monopolisation and of abusive behaviour as benchmarks for antitrust enforcement in both EU and U. S. law. Section two of the paper identifies and distinguishes two different categories of legal techniques (short-cut rules and evidentiary <b>presumptions)</b> facilitating the enforcement of abuse regulation. General policy and case law evolutions allow to infer that both legal systems seemingly attest to a move away from short-cut rules in favour of evidentiary <b>presumptions.</b> In the U. S., the latter kind of <b>presumptions</b> are also even more limited in scope and scale. Section three will summarily address those evolutions in relation to both legal orders. Section four questions to what extent a reliance on different regulatory enforcement techniques in both legal orders could provide fertile ground for convergence amongst EU and U. S. abuse practices and whether the development of effectively converging legal <b>presumptions</b> actually offers a way forward for emerging and more established competition law jurisdictions across the globe. Focus will particularly be put on legal <b>presumptions,</b> as they have become seemingly more important in both legal orders over the past two decades. Peer reviewe...|$|R
5|$|After Ford {{left the}} White House in January 1977, the former President privately {{justified}} his pardon of Nixon by carrying {{in his wallet}} {{a portion of the}} text of Burdick v.

In 2001, the John F. Kennedy Library Foundation awarded the John F. Kennedy Profile in Courage Award to Ford for his pardon of Nixon. In presenting the award to Ford, Senator Edward Kennedy said that he had initially been opposed to the pardon, but later decided that history had proved Ford to have made the correct decision.|$|E
5|$|All new {{subsidiary}} legislation must {{be sent to}} the Council for scrutiny within 14 days of their publication in the Government Gazette. The Council is then required to make its report to the Speaker and the appropriate Minister within 30 days. However, unlike with bills, there is no provision to extend the original deadline. As with bills, tardiness in sending an adverse report results in a conclusive <b>presumption</b> that the Council finds no differentiating measures in the {{subsidiary legislation}}. Where the Council issues an adverse report, the Minister must revoke or amend the offending provision within six months of the report, unless Parliament passes a resolution confirming that provision.|$|E

40|$|In {{the first}} part of this paper I {{consider}} the Gricean account of communication, as structured by the Cooperative Principle and the four maxims. Several authors, including Jean Goodwin [10], Fred Kauffeld [17], Michael Gilbert [7], Ernie Lepore and Mathew Stone [22], among others, argue that the Gricean view of communication fails in as much as it pretends to offer an account of all such human interactions. As Goodwin and Kauffeld suggest, a more promising starting point is to consider the variety of contextually determined <b>presumptions</b> that we make about speakers and that we rely upon in interpreting utterances. These <b>presumptions</b> are established in various ways, and are dropped, or defeated, in certain conditions. In order to clarify these aspects we need to inquiry into the nature of <b>presumptions.</b> I argue that Kauffeld’s [18], [19], [20] account of <b>presumptions</b> is useful in this context. In the second part of the paper I look at what this account tells us about how, and in what conditions, <b>presumptions</b> in communication are rebutted...|$|R
