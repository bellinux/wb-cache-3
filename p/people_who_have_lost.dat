5|$|Personal traits such as age, gender, location, and {{education}} correlate, either positively or negatively, with HIV/AIDS awareness levels. For example, older women have demonstrated {{higher levels of}} knowledge regarding HIV/AIDS than younger women in Malawi. Because men typically have greater access to education and other social resources, they are often more knowledgeable about HIV prevention and transmission than women. While men are, on average, able to list 2.2 ways to prevent HIV transmission, women are only able to list 1.5 ways. Only 38% of women surveyed in 2003-2004 understood that their husbands {{would be less likely}} to contract HIV if they used condoms during intercourse with prostitutes and other women from high-risk groups. In addition, men who are raised in urban environments are, on average, more informed about HIV/AIDS than men who are raised in rural environments, presumably because urban children typically have greater access to educational resources than rural children. Among both men and women, higher levels of education correspond to increased knowledge about HIV/AIDS: men and women who have received secondary school educations are significantly more likely to understand complex aspects of the disease, such as the fact that people who appear healthy can still be HIV-positive, than those who have not. Finally, <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>have</b> <b>lost</b> friends or family members to the disease are likely to have greater knowledge about HIV/AIDS due to their personal, firsthand exposure to the problem.|$|E
500|$|The {{usage of}} an audio sample from Space Shuttle Challenger {{disaster}} {{at the beginning}} of the song was criticized by the families of the lost crew, NASA, and some media.

[...] "XO" [...] managed to appear on many music charts across Europe and Oceania and it peaked at number 45 on the US Billboard Hot 100.|$|E
500|$|The {{administration}} of fluid therapy in individuals with pulmonary contusion is controversial. Excessive fluid in the circulatory system (hypervolemia) can worsen hypoxia {{because it can}} cause fluid leakage from injured capillaries (pulmonary edema), which are more permeable than normal. However, low blood volume (hypovolemia) resulting from insufficient fluid has an even worse impact, potentially causing hypovolemic shock; for <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>have</b> <b>lost</b> large amounts of blood, fluid resuscitation is necessary. [...] A lot of the evidence supporting the idea that fluids should be withheld from people with pulmonary contusion came from animal studies, not clinical trials with humans; human studies have had conflicting findings on whether fluid resuscitation worsens the condition. [...] Current recommendations suggest giving enough fluid to ensure sufficient blood flow but not giving any more fluid than necessary. [...] For people who do require large amounts of intravenous fluid, a catheter may {{be placed in the}} pulmonary artery to measure the pressure within it. [...] Measuring pulmonary artery pressure allows the clinician to give enough fluids to prevent shock without exacerbating edema. [...] Diuretics, drugs that increase urine output to reduce excessive fluid in the system, can be used when fluid overload does occur, {{as long as there is}} not a significant risk of shock. [...] Furosemide, a diuretic used in the treatment of pulmonary contusion, also relaxes the smooth muscle in the veins of the lungs, thereby decreasing pulmonary venous resistance and reducing the pressure in the pulmonary capillaries.|$|E

2500|$|Rotoreliefs {{were the}} next phase of Duchamp's {{spinning}} works. To make the optical [...] "play toys", he painted designs on flat cardboard circles and spun them on a phonographic turntable. When spinning, the flat disks appeared three-dimensional. He had a printer produce 500 sets of six of the designs, and set up a booth at a 1935 Paris inventors' show to sell them. The venture was a financial disaster, but some optical scientists thought they might be of use in restoring three-dimensional stereoscopic sight to <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>have</b> <b>lost</b> vision in one eye. In collaboration with Man Ray and Marc Allégret, Duchamp filmed early versions of the Rotoreliefs and they named the film Anémic Cinéma (1926). Later, in Alexander Calder's studio in 1931, while looking at the sculptor's kinetic works, Duchamp suggested that these should be called [...] "mobiles". Calder agreed to use this novel term in his upcoming show. To this day, sculptures of this type are called [...] "mobiles".|$|E
50|$|Jastrow {{found that}} <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>had</b> <b>lost</b> their {{eyesight}} after age six still {{were able to}} see in their dreams, and that <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>had</b> <b>lost</b> their eyesight before the age of five could not.

Jastrow concluded that sight was not innate, and that significant mental development occurred between ages five and seven. He noted that hearing, not sensation, was the primary sense of the blind, in both waking and dream. He collected first-hand accounts of dreams from visually impaired individuals, including Helen Keller.|$|R

His voice, saying [...] "damnation and damnation," [...] echoed and re-echoed in her ears. Somehow she understood that as she had never understood any sober statement of his case.

60|$|We {{probably}} {{began to}} celebrate our Fourth-of-July night {{in that way}} one hundred and twenty-five years ago, and on every Fourth-of-July night since these horrors have grown and grown, until now, in our five thousand towns of America, somebody gets killed or crippled on every Fourth-of-July night, besides those cases of sick persons whom we never hear of, who die {{as the result of}} the noise or the shock. They cripple and kill more people on the Fourth of July in, America than they kill and cripple in our wars nowadays, and there are no pensions for these folk. And, too, we burn houses.

It's a frenzy beyond his own control, with him--just as it's a frenzy beyond their own control, with them. There are Asylums for mad people, all over the country, at the public disposal, on certain conditions. If I fulfill those conditions, will the law deliver me from the misery of being married to a madman, whose madness is drink?'--'No,' says the lawyer.

But with the decay, of any intellectual observation of the present these past things had lost their vitality.

6000|$|Leaving for {{a moment}} the larger {{argument}} as to the lines of this revelation and the broad proofs of its validity, there are some smaller points which have forced themselves upon my attention during the consideration of the subject. This home of our dead seems to be very near to us--so near that we continually, as they tell us, visit them in our sleep. Much of that quiet resignation which we have all observed in <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>have</b> <b>lost</b> those whom they loved--people who would in our previous opinion have been driven mad by such loss--is {{due to the fact that}} they have seen their dead, and that although the switch-off is complete and they can recall nothing whatever of the spirit experience in sleep, the soothing result of it is still carried on by the subconscious self. The switch-off is, as I say, complete, but sometimes for some reason it is hung up for a fraction of a second, and it is at such moments that the dreamer comes back from his dream [...] "trailing clouds of glory." [...] From this also come all those prophetic dreams many of which are well attested. I have had a recent personal experience of one which has not yet perhaps entirely justified itself but is even now remarkable. Upon April 4th of last year, 1917, I awoke with a feeling that some communication had been made to me of which I had only carried back one word which was ringing in my head. That word was [...] "Piave." [...] To the best of my belief I had never heard the word before. As it sounded like the name of a place I went into my study the moment I had dressed and I looked up the index of my Atlas. There was [...] "Piave" [...] sure enough, and I noted that it was a river in Italy some forty miles behind the front line, which at that time was victoriously advancing. I could imagine few more unlikely things than that the war should roll back to the Piave, and I could not think how any military event of consequence could arise there, but none the less I was so impressed that I drew up a statement that some such event would occur there, and I had it signed by my secretary and witnessed by my wife with the date, April 4th, attached. It is a matter of history how six months later the whole Italian line fell back, how it abandoned successive positions upon rivers, and how it stuck upon this stream which was said by military critics to be strategically almost untenable. If nothing more should occur (I write upon February 20th, 1918), the reference to the name has been fully justified, presuming that some friend in the beyond was forecasting the coming events of the war. I have still a hope, however, that more was meant, and that some crowning victory of the Allies at this spot may justify still further the strange way in which the name was conveyed to my mind.|$|E
