5|$|The first <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>is</b> now Switzerland {{to fall to}} Rome was the {{southern}} Ticino, annexed after the Roman victory over the Insubres in 222BC.

5|$|Berenice {{was born}} in 28 to Herod Agrippa and Cypros, as granddaughter to Aristobulus IV and {{great-granddaughter}} to Herod the Great. Her elder brother was Agrippa II (b. 27), and her younger sisters were Mariamne (b. 34) and Drusilla (b. 38). According to Josephus, {{there was also a}} younger brother called Drusus, who died before his teens.

5|$|Historically {{a part of}} Lancashire, {{there are}} records of Didsbury {{existing}} as a small hamlet {{as early as the}} 13th century. Its early history was dominated by being part of the Manor of Withington, a feudal estate that covered a large <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>is</b> now the south of Manchester. Didsbury was described during the 18th century as a township separate from outside influence. In 1745 Charles Edward Stuart crossed the Mersey at Didsbury in the Jacobite march south from Manchester to Derby, and again in the subsequent retreat.|$|E
5|$|The first <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>is</b> now the Oslo Commuter Rail was the Trunk Line, {{which opened}} on 1 September 1854 between Oslo East Station (OsloØ, {{located at the}} same place as the current OsloS), and Eidsvoll. The line was at first private, {{although}} it was nationalized in 1926. On 3 October 1862, the Kongsvinger Line opened from Lillestrøm to Kongsvinger. The Østfold Line opened from OsloØ to Moss and onwards to Halden on 2 January 1879, followed by the Eastern Østfold Line from Ski via Mysen to Sarpsborg on 24 November 1882.|$|E
5|$|During the ten and a {{half hours}} that it burned, the fire had {{destroyed}} buildings from Broad Street below Wall Street to Stone Street, up Whitehall Street to Bowling Green, and up Broadway to Exchange Place. Four firefighters and 26 civilians lost their lives, and buildings were reported destroyed on Broadway, New Street, Broad Street, Exchange Place, Beaver Street, Marketfield Street, Whitehall Street, and South William Street. All told, the fire destroyed 345 buildings in the southern <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>is</b> now the Financial District, resulting in property damage estimated at the time between $5 million and $10 million. In today's currency, damages would be between $ and $.|$|E

5|$|In 1631 Wiśniowiecki {{returned}} to the Commonwealth and took over from his uncle the management of his father's huge estate, which included a large <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>is</b> now Ukraine. In 1632 he converted from Eastern Orthodoxy to Catholicism, an action that caused much concern in Ukraine. His decision has been analyzed by historians, and often criticized, particularly in Ukrainian historiography. The Orthodox Church feared to lose a powerful protector, and Isaiah Kopinsky, metropolitan bishop of Kiev {{and a friend of}} his mother, unsuccessfully pleaded with him to change his mind. Jeremi would not budge although he remained on decent terms with the Orthodox Church, avoiding provocative actions, and supported his uncle and Orthodox bishop Peter Mogila and his Orthodox Church collegium.|$|E
5|$|Neither {{of these}} Portuguese {{settlement}} efforts was launched {{for the purpose}} of territorial conquest. It is true that both gradually came to occupy and farm a broad area around their initial bridgeheads (in the case of Luanda, mostly along the lower Kwanza River). However, their main function was trade – overwhelmingly the slave trade. Slaves were bought from African intermediaries and sold to Brazil and the Caribbean. In addition, Benguela developed a commerce in ivory, wax, and honey, which they bought from Ovimbundu caravans which fetched these goods from among the Ganguela peoples in the eastern <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>is</b> now Angola.|$|E
5|$|The Ulysses S. Grant National Historic Site near St. Louis, {{and several}} other sites in Ohio and Illinois memorialize Grant's life. There are smaller {{memorials}} in Chicago's Lincoln Park and Philadelphia's Fairmount Park. Named in his honor are Grant Park, {{as well as several}} counties in western and midwestern states. On June 3, 1891, a bronze statue of Grant by Danish sculptor Johannes Gelert was dedicated at Grant Park in Galena, Illinois. From 1890 to 1940, <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>is</b> now Kings Canyon National Park was called General Grant National Park, named for the General Grant sequoia.|$|E

5|$|The Roman {{military}} occupation {{of a significant}} <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>is</b> now northern Scotland lasted only about 40 years; although their influence on the southern section of the country, occupied by Brythonic tribes such as the Votadini and Damnonii, would still have been considerable {{between the first and}} fifth centuries. The Welsh term Hen Ogledd ("Old North") is used by scholars to describe what is now the North of England and the South of Scotland during its habitation by Brittonic-speaking people around AD 500 to 800. According to writings from the 9th and 10th centuries, the Gaelic kingdom of Dál Riata was founded in the 6th century in western Scotland. The 'traditional' view is that settlers from Ireland founded the kingdom, bringing Gaelic language and culture with them. However, some archaeologists have argued against this view, saying there is no archaeological or placename evidence for a migration or a takeover by a small group of elites.|$|E
5|$|The highway {{was also}} part of the East Michigan Pike, {{designed}} to be a counterpart of the West Michigan Pike {{on the other side of}} the LP. The original route of the East Michigan Pike included a section along the coast of The Thumb between Bay City and Port Huron and used the same route as the Dixie Highway north of Bay City. Backers of this auto trail lost out in terms of name recognition to the Dixie Highway, relegating the East Michigan Pike to the list of failed auto trails. The southern <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>is</b> now US23 in the state was {{also part of}} the auto trail craze. The Top of Michigan Trail was designated in 1917 from the state line north to the Bay City area, before turning inland along other roadways. The name faded from shortly after the time the Michigan State Highway Department (MSHD) assigned the first highway numbers in the state.|$|E
5|$|Various {{memorial}} or tourist route designations {{have been}} applied to US23 in the state since the 1980s. The highway {{has been a part}} of the Lake Huron Circle Tour since the creation of the Great Lakes Circle Tours in 1986. The non-freeway section was designated the Sunrise Side Coastal Highway by the Michigan Department of Transportation (MDOT) in 2004 as a <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>is</b> now the Pure Michigan Byway Program. Since 2009, it has been called the Huron Shores Heritage Route. The highway has also carried two memorial designations related to war veterans and a third related to local civic leaders since a 2001 consolidation of related legislation in the state. MDOT has listed two of the highway's bridges on its historic bridge list, one of which is also on the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP). Future improvements to the route of US23 include a proposed northerly extension of the freeway from Standish to one of several locations along the Lake Huron shoreline. Another freeway has been proposed in the Flint area that could connect US23 directly to the south end of I-475.|$|E

The southern <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>is</b> now Fall River was incorporated as the town of Tiverton as part of the Massachusetts Bay Colony in 1694, a few years after the merger with Plymouth Colony. In 1746, in the settlement of a colonial boundary dispute between Rhode Island and Massachusetts, Tiverton was annexed to Rhode Island, along with Little Compton and what is now Newport County, Rhode Island.
