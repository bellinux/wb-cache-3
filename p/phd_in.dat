40|$|Pulmonary {{hypertension}} (PH) is {{a severe}} complication of sarcoidosis, with an unknown prevalence. The aetiology is multifactorial, and the exact mechanism of <b>PH</b> <b>in</b> the individual patient {{is often difficult}} to establish. The diagnostic work-up and treatment of <b>PH</b> <b>in</b> sarcoidosis is complex, and should therefore be determined by a multidisciplinary expert team in a specialised centre. It is still a major challenge to identify sarcoidosis patients at risk for developing PH. There is no validated algorithm when to refer a patient suspected for PH, and PH analysis itself is difficult. Until present, there is no established therapy for <b>PH</b> <b>in</b> sarcoidosis. Besides optimal treatment for sarcoidosis, case series evaluating new therapeutic options involving PH-targeted therapy are arising for a subgroup of patients.

The {{development}} of pulmonary hypertension (<b>PH)</b> <b>in</b> COPD adversely affects survival and exercise capacity. Thus, the aim of this study was to evaluate the possible association between single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in TRPM 8  and COPD or <b>PH</b> <b>in</b> COPD among the Chinese Han population. A total of 513 COPD patients and 506 controls were enrolled in the study. Six tag SNPs (tSNPs) were genotyped. The relationship between COPD or <b>PH</b> <b>in</b> COPD and the six tSNPs was evaluated using the χ 2 test and genetic model analysis. In the rs 9789398 polymorphism, the T/C genotype was associated with an increased risk for COPD (P= 0. 005). Under the assumption of models of inheritance, there was an association between the rs 9789398 polymorphism and COPD. In the rs 9789675 polymorphism, the G/A genotype was associated with an increased risk for COPD (P= 0. 021). Furthermore, by the χ 2 test, we found that the minor allele “A” of rs 9789675 (odds ratio [OR] = 0. 63, 95 % confidence interval [CI], 0. 42 – 0. 97, P= 0. 034) and the minor allele “C” of rs 9789398 (OR = 1. 59, 95 % CI, 1. 03 – 2. 44, P= 0. 034) were associated with a decreased risk of <b>PH</b> <b>in</b> COPD in allele models. In genetic models, the genotypes “GA” and “AA” of rs 9789675 were associated with a decreased risk of <b>PH</b> <b>in</b> COPD. The genotypes “TC” and “CC” of rs 9789398 were associated with a decreased risk of <b>PH</b> <b>in</b> COPD. Moreover, “CG” of rs 1004478 was significantly associated with a decreased risk of <b>PH</b> <b>in</b> COPD. There was a significant association between the five SNPs (rs 2362290, rs 9789675, rs 9789398, rs 1003540, and rs 104478) in the TRPM 8  gene and the risk of <b>PH</b> <b>in</b> COPD. Our findings indicated that rs 9789398 in the TRPM 8  gene was significantly associated with the risk of COPD in the Chinese Han population. Moreover, rs 9789675, rs 9789398, and rs 1004478 were significantly associated with the risk of <b>PH</b> <b>in</b> COPD.

40|$|Background: One of {{the causes}} of upper {{gastrointestinal}} bleeding in patients with liver cirrhosis is thepresence of portal hypertensive gastropathy (PHG). The prevalence of PHG in patients with liver cirrhosis isquite high but there is still inconsistency regarding the studies about gastric <b>pH</b> <b>in</b> cirrhosis patient. The aim {{of this study is to}} compare the gastric <b>pH</b> <b>in</b> mild and severe PHG due to liver cirrhosis. Method: Cross sectional method with consecutive sampling was done to all liver cirrhotic patients who came to Clinic of Gastroenterology and Hepatology in Cipto Mangunkusumo hospital from March to May 2014. Sixtytwo patients with portal hypertensive gastropathy underwent endoscopy to measure the degree of gastropathy based on Mc Cormack classification ad the mean basal gastric pH using pH-metric. Results: There are 50 (80. 6 %) male patients and 12 (19. 4 %) female patients participated in this study. Portal hypertensive gastropathy is mostly caused by hepatitis C (56. 5 %), hepatitis B (32. 3 %), non-hepatitis (8. 1 %) and alcohol (3. 2 %). The mean of gastric <b>pH</b> <b>in</b> all liver cirrhosis patients with portal hypertensive gastropathy was 2. 13. The mean gastric <b>pH</b> <b>in</b> liver cirrhosis patient with mild portal hypertensive gastropathy (2. 00 mEq/L) was lower than the gastric <b>pH</b> <b>in</b> severe portal hypertensive gastropathy (2. 25 mEq/L) with significant differences (p< 0. 05) Conclusion: The gastric <b>pH</b> <b>in</b> liver cirrhosis patient between mild and severe portal hypertensive gastropathy are significantly differen...|$|R

40|$|Early {{injury to}} the lung {{circulation}} leads to the rapid development of pulmonary hypertension (PH) after pre mature birth. <b>PH</b> <b>in</b> bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) results from increased vascular tone and abnormal vasoreactivity, hypertensive remodeling, and decreased vascular growth.
