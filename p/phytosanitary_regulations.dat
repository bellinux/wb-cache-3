50|$|In sweet corn, {{losses are}} as {{significant}} as hybrid varieties, but are only used on a periodic basis. The susceptible varieties cause losses ranging from 40 to 100% when infected prior to the five-leaf stage. The losses are 15-35% and 3-15% for seven-leaf and nine-leaf stages, respectively. Stewart's wilt may add additional costs for <b>phytosanitary</b> <b>regulations</b> from trading partners. Such regulations primarily affect seed commerce by preventing seed from being exported or by creating additional costs for phytosanitary inspections prior to export. During epidemics in the 1990s, Stewart's wilt was a significant economic issue for the corn seed industry because of the logistics of trading and exchange of large volumes of field corn seed throughout the world. Stewart's wilt also creates indirect costs for seed producers because resources must be used to screen germplasm and breed corn for Stewart's wilt resistance to develop hybrids that efficiently and effectively control the disease. In Kentucky, the disease causes huge losses for corn producers. Stewart's wilt impacts include stand reductions, production of fewer and smaller ears, and an increased susceptibility of wilt-infected plants to stalk rotting organisms.|$|E

The strong increase in world trade in the past decades appears to have led to an increase in introductions of species transported by this pathway, and highlights the need for effective phytosanitary legislation and measures. The <b>phytosanitary</b> <b>regulations</b> in most countries are based on the International Plant Protection Convention and the World Trade Organisation's Agreement on Sanitary and Phytosanitary Measures, but there are large differences in countries' approaches to managing the risk of introducing invasive alien species through international plant trade.

We found large differences in countries' <b>phytosanitary</b> <b>regulations.</b> New Zealand and Australia have the strictest <b>phytosanitary</b> <b>regulations,</b> while Europe maintains a general authorization for P 4 P imports. The remaining countries have regulations between these extremes. The evidence is sparse regarding the quality of implementation and effectiveness, and impact of individual phytosanitary measures.

40|$|The Sanitary Phytosanitary Code (SPS) is {{an effort}} to reduce the {{technical}} barriers to trade created by <b>phytosanitary</b> <b>regulations,</b> or trade barriers related to plant and animal health.

40|$|As {{progress}} has been made on tariff reduction by recent trade agreements, barriers to freer international trade arising from nontariff sources have become more prominent. Regulation of product quality and in particular food safety can be a major source of such barriers. Lowering them requires that trading partners develop methods of cooperation, termed rapprochement, in setting and reforming national-level quality regulation. A better understanding of the effects of such rapprochement efforts on trade in food products requires a melding of economic theory and empirical work on regulation, international trade, industrial organization, product quality, rent-seeking, and competitiveness. The immediate importance of this understanding is due to the new treatment of food quality regulation under trade pacts such as the North American Free Trade Agreement and the Uruguay Round of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. These agreements recommend the increased use by countries of guidelines adopted by international standards organizations such as Codex Alimentarius. Contracting parties have the ability to set stricter standards if they have sufficient scientific evidence that such measures are justified. This dissertation examines the language on sanitary and <b>phytosanitary</b> <b>regulation</b> included in recent trade agreements in order to analyze how they attempt to manage potential nontariff barriers to trade. A conceptual model outlines how the welfare impacts of these trade barriers may be characterized and the joint determination of the scientific and policy merit of food safety regimes in light of the level of rapprochement attained by the trade agreement. Case studies of a particular trading relationship (U. S. -New Zealand) and quality management systems for food producers and processors (HACCP and ISO 9000) illustrate the application of this model. These case studies show that, far from creating a close harmonious trading environment, national-level regulations currently allow for the maintenance and possible development of trade barriers. ...|$|R

40|$|International {{trade in}} {{agricultural}} products conveys {{the risk of}} transferring exotic pests across national borders. Of particular concern are pests "that may be of national economic importance to the country facing the risk represented by the pest, {{when it is not}} yet present, or present but not widespread and under active control " (International Plant Protection Convention). To address these concerns, countries enact sanitary and <b>phytosanitary</b> [SPS] <b>regulations</b> that reduce pest risks by restricting the movement of agricultural commodities. In general, the legitimacy of such regulations is well-recognized under international trade rules. Even so, the World Trade Organization [WTO] acknowledges the potential for, and possible widespread misuse of, unjustified SPS regulations as nontransparent barriers to trade. In order to deter the enactment of unjustified SPS regulations, new formal dispute settlement procedures have been established under the WTO. These dispute settlement procedures emphasize the requirement for firm scientific risk analyses in the justification of SPS regulations (GATT 1994). But the efficacy of these procedures in constraining the enactment of unjustified SPS trade restrictions is not yet tested.

The TTIP represents a fruitful area to investigate {{the way in which the}} EP is utilizing (or underutilizing) its new power as well as implications for the EU’s democratic deficit.

40|$|Recent {{attention}} to agricultural trade policy {{has turned to}} issues of technical barriers, particularly sanitary and <b>phytosanitary</b> (SPS) <b>regulations,</b> that constrain movement of products across international borders. It is intuitive that there are public good arguments that make some SPS restrictions necessary to insure a safe food supply and protect domestic animal herds and plant stocks from pests and diseases. In other cases, regulations rationalized on technical grounds seem to lack firm scientific foundations and appear, at least to potential beneficiaries of expanded trade, to be imposed primarily to shield domestic producers from competition. That such controversies arise is not surprising. Their likelihood {{is suggested by the}} economic theory of regulation, sometimes referred to as “capture ” theory. Applied to technical trade barriers, the theory suggests that when there is doubt about the merit of a technical restriction, domestic interest groups will often succeed in obtaining protective decisions from domestic regulatory agencies. Both NAFTA and the WTO address issues of SPS and other technical trade barriers. Under NAFTA, it was agreed that each country retains the right to adopt SPS measures to protect human, animal, and plant life and health, that each country has the right to establish appropriate levels of protection, and that SPS measures must be based on scientific evidence, be non-discriminatory, and be applied only to the extent necessary.

40|$|International {{trade of}} plants and plant {{products}} {{is one of the}} major vectors for the introduction and spread of exotic pests of plants. Some of these pests may affect agricultural production and/or limit access to international export markets. Phytosanitary inspections {{of plants and}} plant products at border ports are an important phytosanitary measure to ensure compliance with importing countries’ requirements. Measures are formulated by undertaking Pest Risk Analysis (PRA). In many developing countries however, the undertaking of PRAs is affected by limited national phytosanitary capacity and resources. This thesis provides insights that may facilitate more effective <b>phytosanitary</b> <b>regulation,</b> particularly the undertaking of PRAs where limited data and expertise are available for this purpose. The Plant Quarantine and Phytosanitary Service (PQPS), the National Plant Protection Organization (NPPO) of Zambia is a case in point. In light of the above, a simplified PRA procedure was developed, one that is internationally acceptable and easily applied day-to-day with the resources available in a developing country like Zambia. The developed procedure focused on Pest Risk Assessment, the second stage of a PRA as guided by international standards. This stage is key to formulating phytosanitary measures. The procedure is entirely qualitative and relates to particular risk elements. The risk elements used in the simplified procedure were identified for inclusion after a detailed review of PRAs conducted by NPPOs of various developed countries, including Australia, New Zealand and the USA as well as one of the Regional Plant Protection Organizations (RPPO), the European and Mediterranean Plant Protection Organization (EPPO). The review evaluated the different steps of stage two of these PRAs, specifically, entry, establishment, spread and consequences of the pest(s). Selection of risk elements for inclusion in the procedure was based on their consistent usage in the PRAs reviewed. The procedure was developed to be easy to apply and being user-friendly, with straightforward questions requiring a yes or no response. The procedure developed in this study avoids the burden of misinterpretation of levels of risk through ratings or scoring. As such, the procedure has the potential to be applied by the NPPOs of other developing countries, including Zambia’s PQPS. The procedure can provide PQPS with science-based PRAs to support the application of phytosanitary measures on imported plants and plant products. Use of the procedure was then tested, using Zambia’s import of South African maize (Zea mays) seed for sowing in a comparative study. However, having a suitable PRA procedure is one thing but ensuring there is the capacity to apply it routinely is another. Additional effort was therefore made to identify the essential PRA process components necessary for a NPPO to have an internationally acceptable PRA system. Essential components of a PRA system were determined through the aforementioned comprehensive review of publicly available PRAs as well as NPPOs and RPPOs documented procedures. The essential components included: •	Presence of a PRA unit; •	Collaboration with specialists from all relevant plant health fields, whether in the NPPO or outside; •	Access to published sources of PRA relevant information and the availability of up-to-date data sets; •	Objective, if not independent technical peer review of each PRA; and •	Risk communication and consultation with stakeholders, including potential trading partners(s). As the case in point, the phytosanitary capacity of Zambia’s NPPO, the PQPS was examined in relation to its PRA system. Two questionnaires were designed specifically for this purpose. The questionnaires provided the means to survey PQPS staff to obtain information on: •	Phytosanitary activities at border ports; •	International trade patterns; •	The current PRA process; •	The availability of PRA experts; •	PQPS staffing; •	Availability of and access to sources of information relevant to PRAs; and •	Laboratory and inspection facilities. The questionnaires were applied between November 2011 and June 2012 at the PQPS head office in Lusaka and Zambia’s border ports. Border ports were Katima Mulilo, Chirundu, Copperbelt, Mwami, Nakonde, Victoria Falls and the main airport, the Kenneth Kaunda International Airport (KKIA). Survey results showed that Zambia’s phytosanitary capacity is challenged in relation to PRA processes. The Zambian NPPO does not have staff specifically tasked with conducting PRAs and a PRA unit is not established in its structure. At the time of the survey, PQPS had a staff comprising 26 Plant Health Inspectors (PHIs). Presently, PHIs located at the border ports conduct ad hoc analyses of the risks associated with imported plants and plant products at the same time they complete phytosanitary inspections. In summary, there was little doubt that Zambia’s PRA process needs to be improved. The phytosanitary capacity of its NPPO is lacking and ideally will require significant injection of funds in the long term. In the absence of additional funding, however, improvements could still be made to its PRA process. The effectiveness of Zambia’s phytosanitary regulatory system will depend on its capacity to undertake PRAs. It is recommended that the effectiveness of Zambia’s system could be improved by: (i) restructuring PQPS so as to utilise some of its in-house tertiary qualified personnel located centrally in Head Office to focus on PRAs; (ii) applying routinely the newly developed PRA procedure at Head Office to develop scientifically justified measures to imports of plants and plant products; (iii) utilising the expertise of other centrally located plant health specialists in the PRA process; (iv) clarifying the inspection roles of PQPS border staff; and (v) establishing clearer communication channels with PHIs located at the border ports thereby enabling them to respond consistently to Head Office directives relating to phytosanitary measures required for imported plants and plant products...|$|R
40|$|In {{the past}} 2 decades, {{developing}} countries have expanded their export share to 24 % {{of the global}} cut flower market. But although there are clear opportunities for ACP producers, small-scale flower farmers still need help {{if they are to}} compete with the major growers. Three decades after the first forays by Southern producers into the global flower market, floriculture continues to hold out hope for ACP producers. In the North, demand for cut flowers has blossomed, especially in Europe, which imports more than 80 % of world output. Kenya remains the clear leader. Between 2001 and 2003, it increased its already substantial market share of EU exports by 17 %. But other ACP players have been quick to move into the field, including Cote d Ivoire, South Africa, Tanzania, Uganda, Zambia and, most spectacularly, in Ethiopia, which chalked up a massive growth of 230 % in the same period The thorn on the rose The most recent newcomers are producers in the Caribbean and the Pacific. In Jamaica, a fledgling flower industry is supplying local markets and selling anthurium, orchids, ginger lilies, and heliconias to cruise ship passengers and to US customers via the internet. In the Pacific, a floriculture workshop supported by CTA in collaboration with the Institute for Research, Extension and Training in Agriculture (IRETA) has enabled one smallholder from the Solomon Islands to set up a blooming business. A number of ACP countries have comparative advantages for producing cut flowers, for reasons of land, labour, climate and preferential tariffs with the EU. But studies show that transport, storage, and distribution account for much of the value added, with production only netting 10 % of the sale price. Though rewarding, the future may not be as bright as the past. The growth of cut flower production now outstrips that of demand, and ACP countries face tough competition from Colombia and China. Prices of bulk cut flowers, such as carnations, alstroemeria and roses, are falling due to over-supply; those of exotic flowers are holding up better. Tropical flowers constitute a growing niche market and popular sellers include orchids, anthuriums, gingers, strelitzia (birds of paradise), heliconias and proteas. Consumer concerns Although it was only established in 1972, Kenya s horticulture industry now ranks fourth in terms of export revenues behind tea, coffee and tourism. But such rapid growth has hidden costs. Kenya has come under fire for poor labour conditions and high use of agrochemicals. Growing pressure from consumers in key importing countries such as Germany has forced the Kenya Flower Council to set up codes of conduct. FAO has sent integrated pest management experts to Nyeri, in central Kenya, to train the 5, 500 women s groups growing flowers there. Producers in the South face a number of hurdles. Flower growing is highly capital intensive and the stringent regulations in the international market such as minimum residue levels (MRLs) and other sanitary and <b>phytosanitary</b> (SPS) <b>regulations</b> are often difficult to negotiate. With such a perishable product, packaging, cold storage and efficient transport links are crucial but costly pre-requisites, and Southern producers start from a disadvantage for reasons of distance. Dutch and German companies have moved into several ACP countries so they can have direct control over quality, distribution and marketing (see Spore 85). Most cut flower producers in the South are dependent on breeders in the North for their planting material, and have to pay royalties. A future in floriculture Given these constraints, {{it is not surprising that}} much of the flower industry is dominated by large concerns. According to Kenya s Horticultural Crops Development Authority, smallholder production has declined in the past 5 years. But in spite of the obstacles, some ACP producers are forging ahead to show there can be a future in floriculture. Uganda is using hydroponics, a technique which limits pests and disease, to grow flowers. In Zambia, small-scale farmer Peter Mtumbe has switched from maize to roses and is planning to double his operation. In Ethiopia, a family firm has become a major international supplier, while in Fiji women have been helped to market flowers for export to Hawaii and New Zealand (see Spore 117). South Africa has found a profitable market producing chrysanthemums. An export guide published by the Centre for the Promotion of Imports from Developing Countries (CBI) identifies summer flowers blooms produced during Europe s winter as a promising sector. Sales to supermarkets are also increasing, a trend which opens up opportunities for ACP producers, but also poses challenges. To take advantage of what most agree is still a flourishing market, more agricultural research is needed to develop local planting material and tackle pest and disease problems. The Secretariat of the Pacific Community (SPC) is working to help Fiji flower growers deal with a fungus that is attacking red ginger (Alpinia purpurata). According to a recent CTA-supported study, producers need help with import requirements, distribution and marketing. One ingenious responses is a Flower Business Park, set up by a rose grower in Naivasha, Kenya, where flower growers pay rental fees for services ranging from land and water to on-site clearance for export documents. In the past 2 decades, developing countries have expanded their export share to 24 % of the global cut flower market.

The workshop also discussed the relationship between the norms and principles of international trade law contained in the provisions of the World Trade Organization (WTO); analyzed the legal framework of economic integration in various regions of the world; and reflected on the potential for eliminating unnecessary obstacles to trade, including by mutual recognition of conformity. The workshop was focused particularly on the potential effects of the implementation of Deep and Comprehensive Free Trade Agreements (DCFTA) between the EU and Georgia, Moldova, and Ukraine. It also addressed the economic impacts of the currently applied mutual sanctions conflict” between the EU, the USA and some other Western nations on the one hand, and Russia on the other, their impacts on international trade, and on the potentials of long-term cooperation between the EU and the EAEU. The impacts on economies of other CIS countries, not directly involved, were also touched upon. Harmonization of legislation in the field of technical, as well as sanitary, <b>phytosanitary,</b> and veterinary <b>regulations</b> between the EAEU and other regions, primarily the EU, was addressed in detail. The discussion covered the harmonization of terminology and labeling; harmonization of national and regional standards with international standards; accreditation, product safety, training in the field of standardization and conformity assessment as well as trade facilitation. In order to foster interdisciplinary and international dialogue on the topic, the workshop brought together well-established scientists, policymakers, banks and companies representatives from around the world, including: Péter Balás, Deputy Director General, DG Trade, European Commission; Igor Finogenov, Chairman of the Management Board, Eurasian Development Bank (EDB), Kazakhstan; Pavel Kabat, Director General and Chief Executive Officer, IIASA; Evgeny Vinokurov, Director, Centre for Integration Studies, Eurasian Development Bank; Paul de Lusignan, Leading Expert, Tariff and Non-Tariff Negotiations, Rules of Origin, DG Trade, European Commission,, Stefanie Harter, Head, Liaison Office to the German Ministries of Foreign Affairs, Defence, Interior and Justice, German Agency for International Cooperation, Evgeny Hotulev, Director, Department of Macroeconomic Policy, Eurasian Economic Commission (EEC), Oleg Noginskiy, Director, Ukrainian Association Suppliers of the Customs Union, Veronika Movchan, Director, Institute for Economic Research and Policy Consulting (IER), Alessandro Nicita, Officer-in-Charge, Trade Policy Research Section, Trade Analysis Branch, Division on International Trade, United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD), among many others, with a total of 41 participants. The workshop participants discussed possible ways how non-tariff barriers could be reduced and convergence of technical regulations to the mutual benefit of all parties involved could be achieved. In this context, they also analyzed the opportunities and risks of economic modernization of the East-European partnership countries, if they adapt to European technical regulations and sanitary requirements. Possibilities for providing a unified policy, removing bottlenecks and differences in the sphere of technical regulation in the EAEU countries, was examined; and the impacts of such policy on producers of goods and services in different regions with regard to ensuring their competitiveness were assessed...|$|R

40|$|As trade {{agreements}} lower tariff rates throughout the world, other {{barriers to trade}} emerge. These non-tariff barriers {{can be just as}} troublesome for exporting companies. Non-tariff barriers include technical measures, customs rules and procedures, transport regulations or costs, lack of knowledge of regional markets, and import policies. The objective {{of this study is to}} identify non-tariff barriers faced by U. S., and more specifically North Dakota, exporting businesses, especially those involved in agriculture, and to identify difficulties involved in exporting products. A survey of North Dakota businesses is conducted to identify important trade barriers. <b>Phytosanitary</b> <b>regulations</b> and railroad problems are two frustrating issues that create barriers to export for North Dakota agribusinesses. Other non-tariff barriers mentioned in the survey include labeling, paperwork, registration, and language differences. When entering new markets, the biggest problems exporters have are making contacts, resolving credit issues, and competing with low-cost competitors from foreign countries. non-tariff barriers, trade, survey, North Dakota exporters, International Relations/Trade,...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{provides}} a systematic welfare-based approach {{to analyze the}} impact of non-tariff measures (NTMs) on trade and welfare in presence of market imperfections. We focus on standard-like measures such as technical barriers and sanitary and <b>phytosanitary</b> <b>regulations.</b> The approach overcomes the shortcomings of the mainstream approach based on the analysis of forgone trade caused by trade costs. The latter ignores market imperfections: welfare increases when NTMs are removed and trade expands. We explain how to account for external effects and market failures in trade-focused welfare analysis, leading to a more balanced overall assessment of measures despite a potential reduction of trade flows. We show {{that the relationship between}} trade, welfare, and NTMs is complex. The optimum NTM is often not zero. An application to shrimp trade illustrates the feasibility of the proposed approach. The illustration shows that the reinforcement of a food safety standard can be socially preferable to the status-quo situation, both domestically and internationally...|$|E

The case study makes extensive use of both primary and secondary sources. Qualitative information and data were collected through semi-structured interviews and informal conversations with avocado growers, Calavo’s personnel and representatives of local organizations. I find that coordination generally occurs through an informal type of verbal marketing contract in which trust and reputation are highly important. The multinational firm has adapted to local models of negotiation and supplier selection. I argue that government-imposed quality and <b>phytosanitary</b> <b>regulations</b> have shaped the relation between Calavo and producers, and increased socio-economic stratification. Alliances between state and wealthier producers have been critical for industry expansion. My findings illustrate that contract farming is not, on its own, sufficient to guarantee integration of smaller producers into international markets...|$|E
40|$|Stewart 2 ̆ 7 s {{disease of}} corn, {{caused by the}} {{bacterium}} Pantoea (Erwinia) stewartii, is extremely important for seed and sweet corn producers. Substantial economic losses are possible in both types of production. For the seed corn industry, zero tolerance <b>phytosanitary</b> <b>regulations</b> greatly inhibit the ability of seed corn to be exported from Stewart’s diseaseinfected fields. Management often focuses {{on the role of}} the corn flea beetle (Chaetocnema pulicaria) vector that is necessary for both pathogen survival during the winter months and pathogen transmission during the field season. Research on the corn flea beetle is limited, especially in regard to its population dynamics during the growing season in Iowa and the proportion of the population that is harboring the bacterium. The corn flea beetle is the sole overwintering habitat for the bacterium; therefore, predicting the risk of Stewart’s disease in each growing season is based primarily on the probability of corn flea beetle populations surviving northeast Iowa winters...|$|E
40|$|This {{research}} examines expanding Value Stream Mapping (VSM) from {{a single}} organisation tool to a supply chain tool. VSM is a lean production tool {{that is used to}} identify areas of waste, traditionally in manufacturing processes internal to a single organisation. This research will adapt and apply a supply chain view of VSM in the context of New Zealand timber exports with a focus on phytosanitary compliance. <b>Phytosanitary</b> <b>regulations</b> {{are an important part of}} international trade as it allows for countries to ensure that products entering their country are free from contaminants, such as pests and diseases. New Zealand must meet other countries phytosanitary requirements in order to enforce our biosecurity measures. Meeting these <b>phytosanitary</b> <b>regulations</b> for export adds cost and reduces efficiencies across the supply chain, reducing this impact while still maintaining a high standard would be beneficial to the export industries in New Zealand, this research will focus on the timber industry. This research uses a multi case study approach to apply VSM to create six current state maps for the phytosanitary compliance processes in the supply chain for sawn timber being exported to Australia and a selection of countries in Asia. The research outlines the traditional methods used in VSM and suggests an adapted method of applying VSM to processes that cross multiple organisational boundaries for a supply chain view. A single future state map is then created, with suggested industry changes. The research objectives are to apply VSM across multiple organisations in a supply chain, to identify the current state map of the processes involved with meeting phytosanitary compliance requirements for Australia and several countries in Asia for sawn timber, and to suggest a future state map for the phytosanitary compliance system in New Zealand. Overall, it was found that the current phytosanitary processes are well managed in New Zealand and meets the requirements of our key export customers. However, the application of a supply chain VSM view has revealed some wastes that could improve the process. This research adds to the established Lean systems literature with an adapted supply chain VSM approach...|$|E
