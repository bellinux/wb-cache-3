40|$|<b>Porcine</b> <b>brucellosis,</b> {{caused by}} the {{bacterium}} Brucella suis, is an economically important cause of reproductive loses in pigs. This organism can be maintained in wild and feral swine, complicating eradication efforts in domesticated pigs. One variant, found only in Europe, is also maintained in hares. Some variants of B. suis mainly affect caribou, reindeer or rodents, and are not important in pigs. B. suis is zoonotic. In humans, brucellosis can be a serious, debilitating and sometimes chronic disease that may affect a variety of organs. Most cases {{are the result of}} occupational exposure to infected animals. B. suis has also been weaponized and could be used in a bioterrorist attack. Etiology In pigs, brucellosis is mainly caused by Brucella suis, a Gram–negative coccobacillus or short rod. This organism is a facultative intracellular pathogen. Other Brucella species rarely found in pigs include Brucella abortus and B. melitensis (For information on B. abortus or B. melitensis, see the factsheets titled “Bovine Brucellosis ” and “Ovine and Caprine Brucellosis, ” respectively. ...|$|E
40|$|Brucella suis is a causative {{agent of}} <b>porcine</b> <b>brucellosis.</b> We report the resequencing of the {{original}} sample upon which the published sequence of Brucella suis 1330 is based and describe {{the differences between the}} published assembly and our assembly at 12 loci. Brucella species are Gram-negative pathogenic bacteria caus-ing zoonotic disease and have been designated category B priority pathogens (1). To fully enable the Brucella research community, it is important to construct genome sequence assemblies of the highest quality, since they are the foundation for developing de-tection and monitoring assays and understanding the biology that may lead to mitigation of Brucella bacteria as both potential bioterrorism threats and infectious agents. Hereinafter, we report the resequencing of the 2. 1 -Mbp chromosome 1 and 1. 2 -Mbp chromosome 2 of Brucella suis 1330, which were fully sequenced in 2002 (5) and used as a reference for previous studies (2, 7), and we describe the sequence differences between the published as-sembly and our assembly.

40|$|Abstract: A {{crossbred}} private {{pig farm}} was maintained at poosaripalayam village of Tirupur district, Tamil Nadu, India and reported {{with the history}} of reproductive failure and increased mortality rate in neonates. Stillbirth and neonatal mortality rates were 20. 00 % and 88. 46 % respectively. During postmortem investigation, samples were collected from piglets and subjected to polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for swine fever, brucellosis and PCV 2. None of the samples were positive for swine fever and <b>brucellosis.</b> <b>Porcine</b> circovirus 2 was confirmed in pooled organ samples by PCR. Histopathological revealed the presence of reticular cell hyperplasia in spleen, necrotic enteritis, nephorosis and toxic hepatitis. Present study suggests that PCV 2 is an emerging viral pathogen which causes for reproductive failure in swine farming but not recognized so far in India and warrants detailed epidemiology study to trace back the source of infection...|$|R
40|$|Feral swine (Sus scrofa) are {{considered}} an invasive species that {{is comprised of}} the wild descendants of domestic swine, European wild boar, and hybrids of these two species. Feral swine were historically associated with the major river drainages in Coastal South Carolina. However, natural range expansion and human release and relocation of feral swine appear to be sources of their expansion into areas not previously occupied. Although an exact estimate of feral swine population numbers is not available, in 2006 feral swine were reported in 42 of 46 South Carolina counties, compared to 46 of 46 counties reporting feral swine activity in 2011. Feral swine can serve as reservoirs {{for a number of}} diseases including pseudorabies, swine <b>brucellosis</b> (Brucella spp.), <b>porcine</b> respiratory and reproductive syndrome and porcine circovirus which may be passed to livestock and, in some cases, native wildlife and humans. The National Wildlife Disease Program within the US Department of Agriculture, Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service, Wildlife Services conducted serologic surveys for pseudorabies virus, <b>brucellosis,</b> <b>porcine</b> circovirus, and porcine respiratory and reproductive syndrome virus in South Carolina feral pig populations from 2007 - 2012. During that period, we opportunistically sampled and collected serum from 545 feral pigs. Overall, 111 of 544 (20. 40 %) animals tested positive for antibodies to pseudorabies, 87 of 545 (15. 96 %) animals tested positive for antibodies to brucellosis, 171 of 306 (55. 88 %) animals tested positive for antibodies to porcine circovirus, and seven of 312 (2. 24 %) animals tested positive for antibodies to porcine respiratory and reproductive syndrome. Positive cases of pseudorabies and brucellosis were spatially limited to populations closely associated with the major river drainages in Coastal South Carolina. These positive cases of pseudorabies and brucellosis were found in areas of long established pig populations. The seven positive cases of porcine respiratory and reproductive syndrome were limited to one geographic cluster within the Congaree and Wateree river confluence and two clusters along the PeeDee River Drainage. These clusters of seropositive cases indicate a more geographically localized distribution of porcine respiratory and reproductive syndrome. Interestingly, positive cases of porcine circovirus appeared to be evenly distributed across all sample locations in South Carolina. A more spatially and temporally consistent sampling strategy is recommended to investigate linear spread of pathogens along river drainages and throughout the feral swine population in South Carolina...|$|R
40|$|The {{principal}} {{objectives of}} this Issues Paper are to document existing {{policy and the}} scope of the non-routine analysis of the risks associated with the importation of pig meat, and to identify the hazards to be considered in the import risk analysis. The non-routine import risk analysis of pig meat is ‘generic ’ in that (a) it is not restricted to specific exporting countries, and, (b) import conditions which may be developed will be relevant to each exporting country’s animal health status. Background issues are outlined in the first three sections of this document. Hazard identification is described in the fourth section, and yielded the list of disease agents shown below. In the final section of the document, technical information concerning each identified hazard is provided. It is envisaged that a risk assessment will be carried out for each identified hazard and documented in the ensuing Draft IRA Report.

40|$|Brucella suis biovar 2 is {{the most}} common {{aetiological}} agent of <b>porcine</b> <b>brucellosis</b> in Europe. B. suis biovar 2 is considered to have low zoonotic potential, but is a causative agent of reproductive losses in pigs, and it is thus economically important. The multilocus variable-number of tandem repeats genotyping analysis of 16 loci (MLVA- 16) has proven to be highly discriminatory and {{is the most}} suitable assay for simultaneously identifying B. suis and tracking infections. The aim {{of this study was to}} investigate the relatedness between isolates of B. suis biovar 2 obtained during a brucellosis outbreak in domestic pigs and isolates from wild boars and hares collected from proximal or remote geographical areas by MLVA- 16. A cluster analysis of the MLVA- 16 data revealed that most of the isolates obtained from Switzerland clustered together, with the exception of one isolate. The outbreak isolates constituted a unique subcluster (with a genetic similarity > 93. 8 %) distinct from that of the isolates obtained from wild animals, suggesting that direct transmission of the bacterium from wild boars to domestic pigs did not occur in this outbreak. To obtain a representative number of isolates for MLVA- 16, alternative methods of Brucella spp. isolation from tissue samples were compared with conventional direct cultivation on a Brucella-selective agar. We observed an enhanced sensitivity when mechanical homogenisation was followed by host cell lysis prior to cultivation on the Brucella-selective agar. This work demonstrates that MLVA- 16 is an excellent tool for both monitoring brucellosis and investigating outbreaks. Additionally, we present efficient alternatives for the isolation of Brucella spp...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: The large {{abundance}} of free-ranging wild boars (Sus scrofa) and a trend towards animal friendly outdoor management of domestic pigs {{lead to an}} increasing probability of disease transmission between those animal populations. In 2001, an active monitoring was started for classical swine fever (CSF), Aujeszky's disease (AD) and <b>porcine</b> <b>brucellosis</b> (PB) in wild boars in Switzerland. The objective of this programme was to document the serological status of wild boars regarding the selected pathogens. To continue this serosurveillance, 1, 060 wild boar samples were collected during two regular hunting seasons in 2004 – 2005. Furthermore, in a pilot study, 61 outdoor pigs from 14 farms located in areas with high wild boar densities were sampled in 2004 and serologically tested for AD and PB. All wild boar samples were negative for CSF. Seroprevalence for AD was 2. 83 % (95 % CI 1. 91 – 4. 02 %). Seroprevalence for PB was 13. 5 % (95 % CI 10. 7 – 16. 7 %) for the Rose Bengal test and 11. 05 % (95 % CI 8. 82 – 13. 61 %) for the indirect ELISA. There was no serological evidence for AD in domestic pigs. All tested animals from 13 piggeries were seronegative for PB, but three pigs from the same farm showed doubtful results. Further investigations on the farm did not indicate the presence of PB in the herd. These findings urge the need for better diagnostic tools to obtain reliable results concerning PB prevalence. Since contact and following transmission of infectious agents between infected wild boars and outdoor pigs might occur in the future, it is advisable to include outdoor pigs in areas at risk in routine surveillance programmes.
