40|$|The {{effect of}} feeding {{different}} grinding levels {{and the effect}} of <b>pelleted</b> <b>feed</b> were tested on the salmonella-prevalence of finishing pigs. The feed was given to pigs in the weight interval from 27 to 99 kilos. The pigs were given dry feed ad libitum. The experiment comprised approximately 1, 000 finishers divided into four groups. In the test both meal and <b>pelleted</b> <b>feed</b> were used. The conclusions are: I. Meal feed gave a significantly lower salmonella level than heat-treated, <b>pelleted</b> <b>feed.</b> 2. The number of salmonella positive pigs were lower when using coarse grinding, but the effect of grinding level was not significant (P= 0. 08). 3. <b>Pelleted</b> <b>feed</b> gave a significantly higher production economy compared to meal feed - mainly due to a better feed conversion. 4. The content of starch in manure was affected by both grinding level and the pelleting process. Analyses showed approximately 25 times more starch in manure when using coarse grinded meal feed compared to fine grinded <b>pelleted</b> <b>feed.</b> 5. <b>Pelleted</b> <b>feed</b> gave a significantly poorer gastric health than meal feed. 6. The gastric health was considerably better when using coarse grinded meal feed compared to the other groups tested. It has been concluded that use of coarse grinded meal feed gives a better protection against salmonella, but the poorest economy. The other way round very fine grinded <b>pelleted</b> meal <b>feed</b> gives the best production economy by an unacceptable high level of gastric changes and salmonella prevalence...|$|R

50|$|As {{with most}} {{aquaculture}} ventures, feeds {{are the biggest}} factor in the cost-efficiency of the farming operation, {{and there would be}} considerable advantages in using formulated <b>pellet</b> <b>feed</b> to supplement or replace the baitfish. However, as yet the manufactured feeds are not competitive with the baitfish.A further future prospect in enhancing the ranching of SBT is the plan of Long Term Holding. By holding its fish for two successive growing seasons (18 months) instead of one (up to 8 months), the industry could potentially achieve a major increase in volume, greater production from the limited quota of wild-caught juveniles, and ability to serve the market year round.

40|$|The major {{objective}} of poultry feeding is {{the conversion of}} feedstuff into human food. The economic importance of poultry feeding, becomes apparent when it is realized that 60 - 70 % of the total production cost of poultry production is feed. For this reason, the efficient use of feed is extremely important in broiler production. The {{objective of}} this research was to review connections between grinding and the pelleting process, and to describe how digestion processes in poultry were influenced by mash or <b>pelleted</b> <b>feed.</b> This literature showed that that energy consumption is a highly relevant factor of economy of feed industry, and that it is affected by grinding. Thus, main criterions for evaluating optimal particle size in feed were both biotic and economic factors. Comparisons were done with mash and <b>pelleted</b> <b>feed.</b> Mash diet gives greater unification of growth, lower mortality and requires lower use of energy, making it more economical. Poultry has preferences for bigger particles size, so <b>pelleted</b> <b>feed</b> increases feed intake relative to mash. <b>Pelleted</b> <b>feed</b> also results in lower percentage of waste in feeding, and is also easier to handle, transport and store. On the other side, <b>pelleted</b> <b>feed</b> is about 10 % more expensive than the other which are not pelleted, largely due to higher energy consumption during production. Recommendations regarding optimum particle size, however, have been contradictory, as the results from feeding trials and different experiments are confounded by a number of factors, including feed physical form, complexity of the diet, grain type, endosperm hardness, grinding method, pellet quality and particle size distribution. On each of this factors possibilities to influence on them are always existing. On the end, however, <b>pelleted</b> <b>feed</b> seems to have more advantages than disadvantages. However, opinions presented in the literature are divided, so more researches is needed to finally conclude which is optimal, mash or <b>pelleted</b> <b>feed...</b>|$|R

50|$|As {{mentioned}} {{earlier in the}} egg stage of development, Cod are fed yolk, followed by plank tonic animals (ground plankton) in the larvae stage, and finally a <b>pellet</b> <b>feed</b> after leaving the onshore facility. The pellets fed to Atlantic Cod are mostly grain based, which are made of fish oil, bone meal, vitamins and minerals.2 Atlantic Cod have a superb 1 kg of feed to 1 kg of weight gain ratio.8 In some open water environments this ratio is even more efficient, because Cod will eat other small natural organisms in the water. Cod fish are actually carnivorous animals and will even eat each other if prevalent size ratios are available. However aquatic farms have recently been trying to turn Atlantic Cod's carnivorous diet to a more herbivorous one; as already done in chickens8 This would drastically lower the already low price of feed for future generations.|$|E

40|$|Summary: The {{hypothesis}} {{of the present}} investigations was that organic feeding {{with a high level}} of protein might increase the risk of development of infection with S.

Pigs were followed by microbiological examination of faecal samples and serological analysis of blood in 8 weeks. In the experimental model applied, it was not possible to show any significant difference in the establishment and course of infection with S. Typhimurium in relation to the feeding strategy. The variation of the infection among the individual pigs included in the study was very high which may cover a possible effect of the different feedings. This high degree of variation may be taken into account when future experimental investigations have to be planned.

50|$|Farmed fish eat {{specially}} formulated pellet feeds {{containing the}} required nutrients for both fish {{health and the}} health of humans who eat fish. A fish feed should be nutritionally well-balanced and provide a good energy source for better growth. Commercially farmed fish are broadly classified into herbivorous fish, which eat mostly plant proteins like soy or corn, vegetable oils, minerals, and vitamins; and carnivorous fish, which are given fish oils and proteins. Carnivorous fish feed contains 30-50% fish meal and oil, but recent research suggests finding alternatives to fish meal in aquaculture diets. Among the various feeds investigated, soybean meal appears to be a better alternative to fishmeal. Soybean meal prepared for the fish industry is heavily dependent on the particle sizes contained in the feed pellets. Particle size influences feed digestibility. The particle sizes of fish <b>pellet</b> <b>feed</b> are influenced by both grain properties and the milling process. Properties of the grain include hardness and moisture content. The milling process affects particle size based on the mill equipment type used, and some properties of the mill equipment (for example corrugations, gap, speed, and energy consumption).|$|E

40|$|The commercially available, {{pelleted}} moose food {{sold under}} the same brand name (“Mazuri Moose Maintenance”) in North Amercia and Europe differs drastically in ingredient composition; the European formula does not contain the aspen sawdust that is regarded the crucial ingredient in the North American diet.

These <b>pelleted</b> <b>feeds,</b> and for comparison grass and browse samples, were submitted {{to a variety of}} analyses in order to isolate the potentially beneficial factors of the commercial moose <b>feeds.</b> All <b>pelleted</b> <b>feeds</b> had comparable particle size distributions, with the North American moose feed as the notable exception, as the sawdust particles were not as finely ground as the other ingredients. All <b>pelleted</b> <b>feeds</b> were similar in nutrient composition; however, the commercial moose feeds had higher percentages of fiber, due to a higher cellulose (and in the European pellets also hemicellulose) content. The commercial moose pellets did not display significantly higher amounts of lignin than the other <b>pelleted</b> <b>feeds,</b> in spite of the sawdust ingredient. Due to their high cellulose content, they even had lower lignin:cellulose-ratios than the other feeds and therefore rather resembled grass than browse in their fiber composition. Thus, the reported success of the commercial moose diets is most likely explained by their comparatively low energy density and high fiber content, and not by the sawdust ingredient itself. Additionally, the fact that they do not contain corn starch is considered beneficial. The nutritional contribution to husbandry problems in captive moose is considered to be generally due to the widespread use of <b>pelleted</b> <b>feeds</b> high in energy density and poor in structural fiber components...|$|R
