The effect of chitosan concentration and purity, {{as well as}} the influence of temperature, ionic strength (salt) and impact of a solid physical support in the medium are examined. Results show that the antibacterial activity of neat chitosan: (i) requires partial solubilisation; (ii) can be promoted by environmental factors such as adequate temperature range, ionic strength and the presence of a solid physical support that may facilitate the attachment of bacteria; (iii) depends on bacterial species, with a sensitivity order of E. coli > L. innocua > S. aureus; and (iv) increases with chitosan concentration, up to a critical point above which this effect decreases. The latter may be due to remaining proteins in chitosan acting as nutrients for bacteria therefore limiting its antibacterial activity.

In producing repeatable calorimetry data on Al alloys, sample preparation, reproducibility and baseline drift need to be considered in detail.

40|$|Ceramic {{particles}} {{are believed to}} be particularly abrasive due to their extreme hardness. Ceramic debris has been reported in retrieved total hip arthroplasty (THA) due to chipping and fracture of alumina components or by flaking of hydroxyapatite from implant coatings. However {{there appears to be no}} abrasion ranking of such particle behavior. The hypotheses in this study were, i) alumina particles would create large scratches in CoCr surfaces and ii) hydroxyapatite would produce very mild scratching comparable to bone-cement particles. Hydroxyapatite beads came in two types of commercial powders while the flakes were scraped from retrieved femoral stems. Alumina beads came in two commercial <b>powders</b> <b>and</b> <b>flakes</b> were retrieved from a fractured ceramic head. Particle morphologies were determined by SEM and CoCr surface damage by interferometry and SEM. Six 38 -mm MOM were mounted inverted in a hip simulator and run with ceramic particles inserted for a 10 -second test. Surface-roughness ranking after 10 -second abrasion test revealed that bone cement and hydroxyapatite produced least damage to CoCr surfaces while alumina produced the most. Alumina increased surface roughness 19 -fold greater than either hydroxyapatite or bone-cement particles. The alumina debris produced numerous scratches typically 20 - 80 µm wide with some up to 140 µm wide. Surprisingly the alumina beads and flakes were pulverized within the 10 -second test interval and remained adherent to the CoCr surfaces. Additionally, the hydroxyapatite although also a ceramic had no more effect on CoCr than the bone-cement debris. Use of well-characterized and commercially available alumina and hydroxyapatite powders appeared advantageous for abrasion tests. These new data indicated that such ceramic powders have merit...|$|E

Regular site visits highlighted the fact that advanced <b>powdering</b> <b>and</b> <b>flaking,</b> as well as alveolar weathering {{of many of the}} Globigerina Limestone megaliths, and fissuring and formation of point-loads in load-bearing stones, were ongoing and were becoming serious concerns, culminating also in the destabilisation of both critical, and minor areas. It was also established that the sporadic interventions which until then had characterised attempts to preserve the sites were mostly futile; some, such as the pointing of fissures with cement, in themselves were accelerating the damage. Ponding inside the Temples was a regular occurrence over the years and loss of infill from the walls was practically continuous. Something needed to be done in a more holistic way. A multi-disciplinary joint project was set up between the Museums Department, 6 Malta, and the University of Florence, Italy, to survey and assess the megalithic monuments, including Ħaġar Qim and Tarxien. This project, which included site work was carried out over a few weeks in the spring or autumn of every year, took place between 1985 and 1991 [2 – 4].

Studies of the construction materials were also carried out, and included chemical, mineralogical, petrographical and physical characterisation of the stones and any soluble salts present [3, 4]. High concentrations of soluble salts were found in the Temple megaliths (up to 1.2 % for chlorides in the Tarxien Temples) and high concentrations of sulfates (a maximum of 0.8 % in samples from Tarxien) as well as high nitrate values (often over 200  ppm and in one case reaching over 700  ppm) [5].|$|R

Initial inspection reveals the presence of narrow emission lines in boron nitride <b>powder</b> <b>and</b> exfoliated <b>flakes</b> of hexagonal boron nitride deposited on Si/SiO 2 substrates. Generally rather stable, the boron nitride emitters constitute a good quality visible light source. However, as briefly discussed, certain specimens reveal a peculiar type of blinking effects, which are likely related to existence of meta-stable electronic states. More advanced characterisation of representative stable emitting centres uncovers a strong dependence of the emission intensity on the energy and polarisation of excitation. On this basis, we speculate that rather strict excitation selectivity {{is an important factor}} determining the character of the emission spectra, which allows the observation of single and well-isolated emitters. Finally, we investigate the properties of the emitting centres in varying external conditions. Quite surprisingly, it is found that the application of a magnetic field introduces no change in the emission spectra of boron nitride emitters. Further analysis of the impact of temperature on the emission spectra and the features seen in second-order correlation functions is used to provide an assessment of the potential functionality of boron nitride emitters as single photon sources capable of room temperature operation...|$|R

40|$|Chitosan is {{considered}} a model polymer because of its excellent biocompatibility, biodegradability, antibacterial property and metal binding ability. Despite the favorable properties, the poor mechanical strength {{and the loss of}} structural integrity limits the applications of chitosan. Graphene's intrinsic low weight with excellent thermal stability makes it an ideal filler for reinforcing polymers. In this work, we prepared graphene oxide (GO) via Hummer's method and simplified Hummer's method using graphite <b>powder</b> <b>and</b> graphite <b>flakes</b> as starting materials, respectively. The GO obtained using Hummer's method and simplified Hummer's method had a small area of less than 50 Î¼m 2 and a large area of about 7000 Î¼m 2, respectively. The small area GO and large area GO were reduced by sodium hydroxide, in which the reduced GO (rGO) with small area and large area were incorporated into a chitosan matrix, respectively, using a simplistic drop-casting technique to produce a thin film. Glass transition temperature (T g) and mechanical strength of chitosan/large area rGO at concentrations of 0. 3, 0. 6 and 0. 9 wt. of GO were found to be better than chitosan/small area rGO. We also investigated the T g and mechanical strength between chitosan/small area GO and chitosan/small area rGO, where we discovered that the former had better thermal and tensile properties. By comparing the T g and mechanical strength of chitosan/small area GO against chitosan/large area GO, we found that the latter displayed superior thermal and tensile properties. Antibacterial tests were performed on the graphene-based chitosan composites and their ability to act as bactericide was manifested in the retardation of the growth of Pseudomonas aeruginosa.

40|$|Since the {{discovery}} of graphene, the quest for two-dimensional (2 D) materials has intensified greatly. Recently, a new family of 2 D transition metal carbides and carbonitrides (MXenes) was discovered that is both conducting and hydrophilic, an uncommon combination. To date MXenes have been produced as <b>powders,</b> <b>flakes,</b> <b>and</b> colloidal solutions. Herein, {{we report on the}} fabrication of similar to 1 x 1 cm(2) Ti 3 C 2 films by selective etching of Al, from sputter-deposited epitaxial Ti 3 AlC 2 films, in aqueous HF or NH 4 HF 2. Films that were about 19 nm thick, etched with NH 4 HF 2, transmit similar to 90 % of the light in the visible-to-infrared range and exhibit metallic conductivity down to similar to 100 K. Below 100 K, the films resistivity increases with decreasing temperature and they exhibit negative magnetoresistance-both observations consistent with a weak localization phenomenon characteristic of many 2 D defective solids. This advance opens the door for the use of MXenes in electronic, photonic, and sensing applications...|$|R
40|$|The {{fermentability}} of indigestible {{carbohydrates and}} content of short-chain fatty acids along the hindgut of rats were investigated using plant materials of importance in the Swedish diet (instant potato <b>powder,</b> apples <b>and</b> oat <b>flakes).</b> Results with the composite food products were compared with commercial fibre fractions obtained from similar sources, ie potato fibre, apple pectin and beta-glucan-enriched oat fibre. The materials were incorporated into diets yielding a concentration of 60 or 70 g kg (1) indigestible carbohydrates. The fermentability of indigestible carbohydrates was high with all diets, between 79 and 90 %. All substrates except the pure apple pectin generated intermediate to high proportions of butyric acid in the caecum (15 - 22 vs 8 %). The potato products gave high concentrations of butyric acid in the distal colon. The potato powder, ie the diet with the highest content of resistant starch (22 g kg(- 1)), also gave the highest proportion of butyric acid in the distal colon (19 %), which was higher than the proportion in the caecum with the same substrate (15 %) (P < 0. 005). The composite foods promoted {{a higher proportion of}} butyric acid in the distal colon as compared with the commercial fibre fractions (P < 0. 05). (C) 2002 Society of Chemical Industry...|$|R
40|$|Conductive {{adhesives}} {{are widely}} used in electronic packaging applications such as die attachment and solderless interconnections, component repair, display interconnections, and heat dissipation. The effects of film thickness as functions of filler volume fraction, conductive filler size, shape, as well as uncured adhesive matrix viscosity on the electrical conduction behavior of epoxy-based adhesives are presented in this work. For this purpose, epoxy-based adhesives were prepared using conductive fillers of different size, shape, and types, including Ni <b>powder,</b> <b>flakes,</b> <b>and</b> filaments, Ag <b>powder,</b> <b>and</b> Cu <b>powder.</b> The filaments were 20 μm in diameter, and 160 or 260 μm in length. HCl and H 3 PO 4 acid solutions were used to etch and remove the surface oxide layers from the fillers. The plane resistance of filled adhesive films was measured using the four-point method. In all cases of conductive filler addition, the planar resistivity levels for the composite adhesive films increased when the film thickness was reduced. The shape of resistivity-thickness curves was negative exponential decaying type and was modeled using a mathematical relation. The relationships between the conductive film resistivities and the filler volume fractions were also derived mathematically based on the experimental data. Thus, the effects of surface treatment of filler particles, the type, size, shape of fillers, and the uncured epoxy viscosity could be included empirically by using these mathematical relations based on the experimental data. By utilizing the relations we proposed to model thickness-dependent and volume fraction-dependent conduction behaviors separately, {{we were able to}} describe the combined and coupled volume fraction-film thickness relationship mathematically based on our experimental data...|$|R
