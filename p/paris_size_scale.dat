40|$|A {{framework}} for accurately modeling fatigue crack growth in ductile crystalline solids is necessarily multiscale The {{creation of new}} free surface occurs at the atomistic scale, where the material's cohesive strength {{is controlled by the}} local chemistry On the other hand, significant dissipation during fatigue crack growth takes place at a <b>size</b> <b>scale</b> that can be modeled appropriately by conventional continuum mechanics. The intermediate <b>size</b> <b>scale</b> where the discreteness of dislocations comes Into play is the main origin of the hysteresis needed for fatigue and of the high stresses required for atomistic separation to take place. We focus on recent developments which permit analyses of fatigue crack growth involving the direct coupling of disparate <b>size</b> <b>scales.</b> Although no analyses have been carried out directly coupling <b>size</b> <b>scales</b> from the atomic to the conventional continuum, the ingredients to do so are in place. We provide background that illustrates the key role played by the intermediate discrete dislocation <b>size</b> <b>scale</b> and review steps that have been taken to permit direct <b>size</b> <b>scale</b> coupling.

In this study, we measure the vacuole-cell <b>size</b> <b>scaling</b> trends in budding yeast using optical microscopy and a novel, to our knowledge, image analysis algorithm. Vacuole volume and surface area both show characteristic scaling trends {{with respect to}} cell size that are consistent among different strains. Rapamycin treatment was found to increase vacuole-cell <b>size</b> <b>scaling</b> trends for both volume and surface area. Unexpectedly, these increases did not depend on macroautophagy, as similar increases in vacuole size were observed in the autophagy deficient mutants atg 1 Δ and atg 5 Δ. Rather, rapamycin appears to act on vacuole size by inhibiting retrograde membrane trafficking, as the atg 18 Δ mutant, which is defective in retrograde trafficking, shows similar vacuole <b>size</b> <b>scaling</b> to rapamycin-treated cells and is itself insensitive to rapamycin treatment. Disruption of anterograde membrane trafficking in the apl 5 Δ mutant leads to complementary changes in vacuole <b>size</b> <b>scaling.</b> These quantitative results lead to a simple model for vacuole <b>size</b> <b>scaling</b> based on proportionality between cell growth rates and vacuole growth rates...|$|R

The possibility of measuring single-cell fluorescence with imaging-in-flow cytometry devices allows {{the study of}} the <b>size</b> <b>scaling</b> of chlorophyll content at both the inter- and intraspecific levels.

40|$|Calculations on finite (or {{partially}} finite) systems, such as Monte-Carlo simulations or the diagonalization of {{a finite}} transfer matrix, are often extrapolated to the thermodynamic limit {{by the use}} of scaling assumptions involving the finite sizes L of the system.

40|$|With the {{projector}} quantum Monte Carlo algorithm and the stochastic diagonalization {{it is possible}} to calculate the ground state of the Hubbard model for small finite clusters. Nevertheless the usual finite <b>size</b> <b>scaling</b> of the Hubbard model has problems of deducing the behavior of the infinite system correctly from the numerical data of small system sizes. Therefore we study the finite <b>size</b> <b>scaling</b> of the superconducting correlation functions in superconducting BCS-reduced Hubbard models to analyze the finite size behavior in small finite clusters. The ground state of the BCS-reduced Hubbard models is calculated with the stochastic diagonalization without any approximations.

As CPUs continue to scale, {{it is essential}} to explore the directory’s architecture dependences. However, this is challenging using detailed simulation given the large number of CPU configurations that are possible. This paper proposes to use multicore reuse distance analysis to study coherence directories. We develop a framework to extract the directory access stream from parallel LRU stacks, enabling rapid analysis of the directory’s accesses and contents across both core count and cache <b>size</b> <b>scaling.</b> We also implement our framework in a profiler, and apply it to gain insights into multicore scaling’s impact on the directory.
