Variables influencing firm value of current year are: firm value of <b>previous</b> <b>year,</b> and profitability of <b>previous</b> <b>year.</b> Capital structure of <b>previous</b> <b>year</b> and firm growth of <b>previous</b> <b>year,</b> its influence do not significant. Thereby, determination of capital structure represent the combination from implementation of market timing theory (negative influence of profitability to capital structure and positive influence of capital structure of <b>previous</b> <b>year</b> to capital structure of current year), and signaling effect theory (positive influence of firm growth to capital structure). While firm value represent the implementation from market timing theory, because proven is not influenced by capital structure directly, but {{is influenced by}} profitability and firm value of <b>previous</b> <b>year</b> positively. Profitability measured by ROA expose that firm performance to yield the profit from business activity, playing important role in determination of capital structure and make-up of firm value. ...|$|R
