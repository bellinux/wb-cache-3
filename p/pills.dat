40|$|A <b>pilled</b> fabric image {{consists}} of sub-images of different frequency components, and the fabric texture and the <b>pilling</b> information are in different frequency bands. Interference from fabric background texture affects {{the accuracy of}} computer-aided <b>pilling</b> ratings. A new approach for <b>pilling</b> evaluation based on the multi-scale two-dimensional dualtree complex wavelet transform (CWT) is {{presented in this paper}} to extract the <b>pilling</b> information from <b>pilled</b> fabric images. The CWT method can effectively decompose the <b>pilled</b> fabric image with six orientations at different scales and reconstruct fabric background texture and <b>pilling</b> sub-images. This study used an energy analysis method to search for an optimum image decomposition scale and dynamically discriminate <b>pilling</b> image from noise, fabric texture, fabric surface unevenness, and illuminative variation in the <b>pilled</b> fabric image. For <b>pilling</b> objective rating, six parameters were extracted from the <b>pilling</b> image to describe <b>pill</b> properties.

40|$|Abstract- Fabric <b>pilling</b> is {{a serious}} problem for the apparel industry, causing an {{unsightly}} appearance and premature wear. Woolen products are particularly prone to <b>pilling.</b> Recently, a process for production of woolen nonwoven ap-parel fabrics has been commercialized in Australia, and may lead to new markets for Australian wool. However, the suc-cess of such nonwoven fabrics will partly rely on their pro-pensity to <b>pill.</b> A key element in the control of fabric <b>pilling</b> is the evaluation of resistance to <b>pilling</b> by testing. Resis-tance to <b>pilling</b> is normally tested in the laboratory by processes that simulate accelerated wear, followed by a ma-nual assessment of the degree of <b>pilling</b> by an expert based on a visual comparison of the sample to a set of test images. To bring more objectivity into the <b>pilling</b> rating process, a number of automated systems based on image analysis have been developed. The authors previously proposed a new me-thod of image analysis based on the two-dimensional discrete wavelet transform to objectively measure the <b>pilling</b> intensi-ty for woven fabrics. This paper presents preliminary work in extending this method to nonwoven fabrics...|$|R
