5000|$|At ambient {{pressure}} and low temperatures 1T-TaS2 is a Mott insulator. Upon heating it abruptly changes to a nearly commensurate charge density wave (NCCDW) state at TNCCDW ~ 190 K, to an incommensurate CDW (ICCDW) state at TICCDW ~ 350 K, {{and to a}} metallic state at TM ~ 550 K, as revealed by electrical conductivity measurements. The NCCDW transitions exhibits a strong thermal hysteresis, and occurs at ~ 150 K upon cooling and at ~ 220 K upon heating; both these temperatures depend on the heating/cooling rate. As a function of sample thickness t the NCCDW transition suddenly disappears at t < 35 nm. It can also be suppressed in thicker samples by application of a gate voltage (~3 V) in a <b>planar</b> <b>transistor</b> configuration. Meanwhile, the ICCDW and metallic transitions exhibit a much smaller thermal hysteresis and much weaker dependences on the heating/cooling rate, sample thickness and applied voltage.|$|E

50|$|For {{its first}} fifty years the {{phonograph}} turntable {{did not use}} electronics; the needle and soundhorn were purely mechanical technologies. However, in the 1920s radio broadcasting became the basis of mass production of radio receivers. The vacuum tubes that had made radios practical were used with record players as well, to amplify the sound {{so that it could}} be played through a loudspeaker. Television was soon invented, but remained insignificant in the consumer market until the 1950s. The transistor, invented in 1947 by Bell Laboratories, led to significant research in the field of solid-state semiconductors in the early 1950s. The transistor's advantages revolutionized that industry along with other electronics. By 1959 Fairchild Semiconductor had introduced the first <b>planar</b> <b>transistor</b> from which come the origins of Moore's law. Integrated circuits followed when manufacturers built circuits (usually for military purposes) on a single substrate using electrical connections between circuits within the chip itself. Bell's invention of the transistor and the development of semiconductors led to far better and cheaper consumer electronics, such as transistor radios, televisions, and by the 1980s, affordable video game consoles and personal computers that regular middle-class families could buy.|$|E

Multigate transistors also provide a better analog performance due to a higher intrinsic gain and lower channel length modulation.

40|$|This work {{addresses}} two substantial {{problems of}} organic electronic devices: the controllability and adjustability of performance, and the integration using scalable, high resolution patterning techniques for <b>planar</b> thin-film <b>transistors</b> and novel vertical transistor devices. Both problems {{are of particular}} importance {{for the success of}} transparent and flexible organic electronics in the future. To begin with, the static behavior in molecular doped organic pin-diodes is investigated. This allows to deduce important diode parameters such as the depletion capacitance, the number of active dopant states, and the breakdown field. Applying this knowledge, organic pin-diodes are designed for ultra-high-frequency applications and a cut-off-frequency of up to 1 GHz can be achieved using optimized parameters for device geometry, layer thickness, and dopant concentration. The second part of this work is devoted to organic thin-film transistors, high resolution patterning techniques, as well as novel vertical transistor concepts. In particular, fluorine based photo-lithography, a high resolution patterning technique compatible to organic semiconductors, is introduced fielding the integration of organic thin-film transistors under ambient conditions. However, as it will be shown, horizontal organic thin-film transistors are substantially limited in their performance by charge carrier injection. Hence, down-scaling is inappropriate to enlarge the transconductance of such transistors. To overcome this drawback, a novel vertical thin-film transistor concept with a vertical channel length of âˆ¼ 50 nm is realized using fluorine based photo-lithography. These vertical devices can surpass the performance of <b>planar</b> <b>transistors</b> and hence are prospective candidates for future integration in complex electronic circuits...|$|R
