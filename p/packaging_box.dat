50|$|The term box art (also {{called a}} game cover or cover art) {{can refer to}} the artwork {{on the front of}} PC or console game <b>packaging.</b> <b>Box</b> art is usually flashy and bombastic, in the vein of movie posters, and serves a similar purpose. Additionally, {{screenshots}} {{on the back of the}} box often mix in-game sequences with pre-rendered sections. Historically, art featured on the box has been in excess of what the computer or console was technically capable of displaying. Veteran San Francisco box art illustrator Marc Ericksen, who produced nearly 100 illustrations for video games from 1982 to 2003, including games like Tengen's Tetris, Capcom's Megaman 2, Atari 7800's Galaga, Data East's Bad Dudes, and SNK's Guerrilla War contends that there was very little in the screen graphics to sell the games. The sales arms needed illustrations to introduce a visual construct to acquaint young gamers to the gameplay concepts. The graphics were exciting when in motion, but offered very little to engage a prospective purchaser's attention when static. Illustrators were less frequently required beyond the year 2000, when screen graphics reached parity with illustrations and could be utilized as cover art.|$|E

40|$|Turkey {{is one of}} {{the main}} fig fruits {{producers}} in the World. The protection of the fig fruit quality in the chains from harvesting to marketing is very important. Vibration often causes some damages to perishable fruits in transportation and reduces their quality. The fruit injury due to vibration is related to the transportation characteristics of vehicles, packaging boxes and the conditions of the roads. The objective of this study was to investigate the effectiveness of <b>packaging</b> <b>box</b> by different materials to decrease the damages of vertical vibration on the quality of three fresh fig varieties (Yediveren, Sarilop and Bursa Black) during transportation. The experiments were carried out in two stages. In the first stage; the frequency and acceleration values of truck were determined during the real transportation. In the second stage, these values were applied on the simulator (shaker) to examine the effect of vibration on fresh figs packaged with three different boxes. The results showed that the cardboard <b>packaging</b> <b>box</b> was not proper for transporting of the fresh fig fruits in all road conditions. The mass loss of fresh fig fruits packed with cardboard box were found to be 2. 5 times more than extruded and expanded polystyrene boxes at 16 Hz frequency and 2. 54 m s- 2 acceleration. Sarilop fig variety was more damaged under the off-road. For long highway road conditions, Burs...|$|E

40|$|The study compares {{cost and}} {{benefits}} {{of carbon dioxide and}} vacuum <b>packaged</b> <b>boxed</b> beef distribution to retail grocery outlets In the retail grocery segment of the beef distribution channel, the major portion still moves fresh in the form of hanging quarters or primals. However, a recently important method of shipment to the retail grocery segment is beef in boxed, palletized form. Although nc accurate data are available to document the proportion of beef which is distri-buted boxed versus hanging, industry corr-sensus is that the boxed, palletized method will continue to increase in im-portance (4). This study provides tl~eresults,~fa comparative cost-benefit analysis of carbon dioxide and vacuum <b>packaged</b> <b>boxed</b> beef, both of which hold promise for in-creased utilization in the trade. The intent is not to identify one method. as superior in all situations to the other, but rather to analyze relative costs and savings associated with the two methods. The specific objectives were: 1) to identify additional costs associated with utilization of carbon dioxide dnd vacuum <b>packaged</b> <b>boxed</b> beef at the packer level, and 2) to evaluate the two systems with respect to shrink, trim 10 SS, and retail case life so as to provide a cost-benefit comparison of the two boxed beef methods, The carbon dioxide method of boxed beef consists of placing a sheet of polyethylene in a cardboard box.,placins either a primal or subprimal cut on tl~c polyethylene which is then folded over tllc meat. Just prior to box closure, a small perforated polyethylene bag of carbon dioxide pellets (typically about two pounds) is placed in the box which may then be l~al-Ietized.

40|$|The {{integration}} of RFID tags in different applications {{is important in}} order to gain greater functionality in products. Upon <b>packaging,</b> <b>box</b> tracking in logistics or in the supply chain can easily be achieved [1]. High manufacturing costs have led to the search for alternative manufacturing methods at an ultra-low cost and various printing processes have been considered such as inkjet, gravure, flexo, offset and screen printing. Currently, investigations are focused on the use of these printing technologies for the mass production of RFID directly on different printing materials such as papers, cardboards and foils [2 – 12]. This paper is an upgrade of our preliminary research [13] focused on antenna design and optimization of printing conditions. The analysis of the readability of UHF RFID tags, which were printed on real pharmaceutical packaging (of tablets) and on ID cards with printed and multi-layered laminated plastic cards were done. Two different antenna designs were printed. The first one on a <b>packaging</b> <b>box</b> and the second one on a foil layer which was then laminated with seven different foil layers. For printing thermal drying silver conductive printing ink was used. The NXP plastic strap chips were integrated with printed antennas using conductive glue. We found that printed antennas of UHF RFID tags and inline chip integration can swap the RFID tag label on packaging and RFID tag inlays in ID cards with printed ones. Preliminary results are promising, but to achieve better performance significant improvements have {{to be made in the}} near future...|$|E

In order to validate this assembling process, the temperature distribution inside the specimens was measured during laser transmission welding. The assembly consists of a quasi-amorphous sample as the upper part and a semi-crystalline sample as the lower part. The temperature fields were measured by infrared thermography with the camera sensor perpendicular to the welded interface. With an energy beam of 28 J. mm- 2 and irradiation time of 15 s, we have noticed that the maximum temperature inside the sample is kept far from the PAEK degradation one. Moreover, the temperature at the interface reaches the melting temperature thus assuring enough mobility for polymeric chains to get adhesion at the interface. The location and size of the heat-affected zone has been determined. Finally, some frames were machined and successfully welded...|$|E
