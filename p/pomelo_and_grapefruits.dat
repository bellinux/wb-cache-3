40|$|Pomelo [Citrus grandis (L.) Osbeck] has {{the largest}} fruit size among citrus species. There are several cultivars for pomelo species which is {{sensitive}} to low temperatures thus its cultivation is possible in relatively preserved areas in subtropical regions. The interest to pomelo production has increased due to several reasons such as, its has a little or no bitterness in fruit flesh conversaly to grapefruit, avaibility of pigmented varieties, high concentration of vitamin C, total phenolics and carotenoids in fruit flesh, {{as well as its}} efficiency in destroying free radicals such as superoxide anion and hydrogen peroxide. Several pomelo varieties have been introduced to Turkey and adaptation studies have been established. In the present study, Reinking, Pomelo WN, Kao Panne and Citrus hassaku which is a spontaneous hybrid between <b>pomelo</b> <b>and</b> mandarin were investigated in terms of fruit yield and pomological characteristics. In addition, Henderson grapefruit was included in this study in order to obtain a comparasion between <b>pomelo</b> <b>and</b> <b>grapefruit.</b> A large variation was observed in fruit yield of cultivars established in 2011 and 2012. In 2011, the highest yield was determined in Henderson whereas it was obtained from Citrus hassaku in 2012. Pomelo varieties yielded between 5 - 60 kg fruit per tree and 8. 6 - 50 kg fruit per tree in 2011 and 2012, respectively. In terms of pomological traits, Citrus hassaku had the highest fruit weight; Pink, Kao Panne <b>and</b> Reinking <b>pomelos</b> had the highest peel thickness <b>and</b> <b>Pomelo</b> WN yielded the highest TSS/TA ratio...|$|R
50|$|The pomelo {{is one of}} {{the four}} {{original}} citrus species (the others being citron, mandarin, and papeda), from which the rest of cultivated citrus hybridized. In particular, the common orange <b>and</b> the <b>grapefruit</b> are assumed to be natural occurring hybrids between the <b>pomelo</b> <b>and</b> the mandarin, with the pomelo providing the bigger size and greater firmness.|$|R
50|$|The {{intent was}} to obtain a grapefruit-like cross that is less bitter or acidic than grapefruit, instead {{achieving}} sweetness similar to the pomelo. It was to be smaller than the <b>pomelo,</b> <b>and</b> more flavourful, with characteristics linked to the grapefruit. The breeders intentionally used a tetraploid <b>grapefruit</b> <b>and</b> a diploid <b>pomelo,</b> with triploid progeny and seedless.|$|R

30|$|Biosorption {{capacity}} of citrus waste (orange, <b>pomelo,</b> <b>grapefruit</b> <b>and</b> lemon peel), banana (Musa paradisiaca), cassava, jackfruit, pomegranate, garlic peel for heavy metals (Pb, zinc, copper and chromium), anionic and basic dyes {{has been studied}} (Bhatnagar et al. 2015). In another investigation, litchi pericarps {{were used for the}} removal of As(III) from aqueous solution waste (Li et al. 2016). Suryan et al. reported the removal of Pb, Cd, Ni and Cu from aqueous solution using paper mill sludge. They found that the growing a sufficient quantity of bacterial, fungal and algal biomass is a costly method. Development of inexpensive biosorbent such as waste biomass from agriculture industry and paper industry represents a cost-effective method for metal removal (Suryan and Ahluwalia 2010). A recent investigation showed the removal of As by non-living biomass of marine macrophytes (Pennesi et al. 2012). In another study, a non-living lichen (Cladonia rangiformis) was used as a biosorbent for Pb removal from aqueous solution (Ekmekyapar et al. 2012). Researchers also reported that dead biomass of Mesorhizobium amorphaeto can also act as a robust biosorbent for Cd removal from aqueous waste (Mohamad et al. 2012). Goyal et al. found that the non-living biomass of Spirulina sp. showed the better biosorption capacity in zinc and Pb removal (Aneja et al. 2010). Guo et al. developed the transgenic Arabidopsis thaliana to increase the tolerance and accumulation of Cd and As by simultaneous over-expression of AsPCS 1 and YCF 1 genes (Guo et al. 2012). In another study Zhang and Liu showed the enhancement of resistance capability of transgenic Alfalfa toward the heavy metals and organic pollutants (Zhang and Liu 2011).|$|R

40|$|Several Caribbean sugar {{producing}} {{countries are}} actively looking for viable alternatives to recover {{some of the}} expected lost revenues due to the WTO (World Trade Organization) ruling that sugar subsidies in the European Union (EU) are illegal. One alternative worth considering is exporting fresh grapefruits to the EU. This marketing opportunity comes about as the United States of America (U. S.), the world’s leading <b>grapefruit</b> producer <b>and</b> exporter (over half of world production), has suffered a series of recent setbacks (citrus canker, citrus greening diseases, and devastating hurricanes) that threaten the future of that industry. Specifically, <b>grapefruit</b> <b>and</b> <b>pomelo</b> production in the U. S. has declined steadily since 2000 (from 2, 506 thousand metric tons in 2000 to only 914 thousand metric tons in 2005).
