40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} the rheological behavior and mucoadhesive nature of saliva substitutes, by incorporating various mucoadhesive polymers into an artificial saliva <b>pump</b> <b>spray</b> formulation. For this purpose various mucoadhesive polymers including cellulosic polymers in the range of 0. 1 - 1. 0 % and Carbomers such as C 974 p, C 971, C 934 p and C 971 in the range of 0. 01 - 0. 1 % were added to a formulated aqueous-based artificial saliva <b>pump</b> <b>spray</b> formulation, containing fixed amounts of some essential electrolytes. The pH of the formulations was between 6. 3 - 7. 4. The formulations were examined in terms of appearance, taste, odor, spray-ability, short-term thermal and mechanical stability, pH, viscosity and rheological behavior, particle size distribution, as well as invitro mucoadhesive strength (MS). The mucoadhesivity ratio (MR) was also calculated as follows: MR=MStest/MScontrol, using natural saliva as the control. Natural saliva showed a pseudoplastic rheological behavior, with a viscosity in the range of 12. 85 - 28. 15 cP. Hence, artificial saliva samples having viscosities within this range were selected. The rheological behavior and viscosity of the test samples as well as the natural saliva were subsequently determined. Similar to that found for the natural saliva, all the prepared formulations showed a pseudoplastic rheological behavior. Among the polymers, C 974 p had the highest viscosity (25. 97 ± 0. 11 cPp) and mucoadhesive strength (34. 84 ± 0. 21 mN/cm 2) followed by hydroxypropylmethylcellulose which had a viscosity of 25. 48 ± 0. 11 cPp and a mucoadhesive strength of 34. 03 ± 0. 24 mN/cm 2. Furthermore, the mucoadhesivity of C 974 p containing artificial saliva was 1. 186 times greater than natural saliva and 1. 387 times more than water. In conclusion, it seems that the presence of mucoadhesive polymers within the artificial saliva <b>pump</b> <b>spray</b> formulations could help to improve the adhesive nature of the formulation to mucosal surfaces, making it even more effective than the natural saliva...|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: Recent {{reports have}} shown that, {{although}} rare, findings of mucosal ulcers and perforations {{of the nasal}} septum in some cases {{may be associated with}} the use of topical nasal glucocorticosteroids (GCS). It can been speculated that, a reduction in septal mucosal blood flow causing ischemia may eventually induce septal perforations. AIM: To evaluate whether a single dose of a potent nasal GCS given in a clinically recommended dose may acutely reduce the mucosal blood flow on the nasal septum. METHODS: Six healthy subjects received in a randomised double blind placebo controlled crossover procedure one dose of 64 micrograms budesonide aqueous nasal spray (Rhinocort aqua, AstraZeneca R&D, Lund, Sweden) and placebo. One dose was delivered into each nasal cavity by means of a <b>pump</b> <b>spray.</b> As a positive control 140 micrograms of xylometazoline (Nezeril, AstraZeneca R&D, Lund, Sweden) was sprayed in the same way, but in an open fashion. A wash-out period of at least 3 days followed each session. Blood flow was measured on the nasal septum with Laser Doppler flowmetry up to 20 min after administration. RESULTS: Budesonide did not affect the nasal septal mucosal blood flow as compared to placebo, but xylometazoline reduced the septal mucosal blood flow by 60. 9 +/- 7. 1 % measured from baseline values. CONCLUSION: A single dose of intranasal budesonide aqueous nasal spray has no acute effects on nasal septal mucosal blood flow...|$|E
40|$|The local deposition, pharmacokinetics, and {{systemic}} activity of inhaled and intranasal glucocorticosteroids in different formulations and devices(ICSs) has been investigated. After nasal {{administration of the}} ICS budesonide (Bud), the systemic availability (F) {{was found to be}} significantly higher from an aqueous <b>pump</b> <b>spray</b> and from the powder inhaler Turbuhaler, than from a pressurized metered dose inhaler (pMDI), and the uptake process was slower and less complete with the pMDI formulation. Lung deposition of Bud from a pMDI plus Nebuhaler, and from Turbuhaler, was found to be twice as high as with a pMDI alone, whereas Ftotal was only about 50 % higher. Thus, a larger proportion of Ftotal was derived from lung deposited Bud when using a pMDI plus Nebuhaler, spacer and Turbuhaler, than when using a pMDI. It was also found that the pMDI resulted in a significantly larger variability in lung deposition than Turbuhaler. In addition, a marked reduction in F was found when the pMDI canisters were not shaken properly before administration which confirms that the pMDI is very dependent on proper handling. Fluticasone propionate (FP), was found to accumulate in plasma during repeated dosing due to a slow systemic elimination. The accumulation is a probable explanation for the marked plasma cortisol suppression observed with repeated dosing within the clinical dose range. In conclusion, the present study has shown differences in local deposition, pharmacokinetics {{and systemic}} activity of inhaled glucocorticoid formulations, features which may contribute to differences in therapeutic properties...|$|E

When sprays were given six times per day for a total of 25 doses, infection, detected by either virus shedding or seroconversion, developed in 100 % of the 13 placebo-treated subjects and 58 % of the 12 pirodavir-treated subjects (P = 0. 015). Clinical colds developed in 54 % of placebo-treated subjects and 8 % of pirodavir-treated subjects during drug administration (efficacy = 85 %, P = 0. 03), although late-developing colds developed in several subjects in both groups. Significant reductions in morning symptom scores and in the frequency of abnormal middle-ear pressures were also found in the pirodavir group. In contrast, in two prophylaxis studies using three doses daily, no significant antiviral or clinical benefits were observed. When frequent sprays were initiated at 24 h after RV challenge, significant reductions in virus shedding but no clinical benefits were found. Intranasal pirodavir was generally well tolerated but was associated with an excess rate of transient unpleasant taste.

The study population consisted of 367 children (less than 17 years old) and 693 adults. About 10 % of the children and 12 % of adults reported doctor diagnosed asthma. The self-reported prevalence rates for wheezing (37 – 40 %) and attacks of shortness of breath with wheeze (16 – 28 %) were much higher than that for doctor diagnosed asthma and common co-occurrence of the three symptoms is found. The prevalence rates for other respiratory symptoms include 33 – 35 % for chronic cough, 31 – 32 % for chronic phlegm, 44 – 50 % for frequent blocked-runny nose, and 16 – 27 % for sinusitis.

40|$|OBJECTIVES: Chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) is {{a common}} chronic disease of the upper airways and has {{considerable}} impact on quality of life. Topical delivery of drugs to the paranasal sinuses is challenging, therefore the rate of surgery is high. This study investigates the delivery efficiency of a pulsating aerosol in comparison to a nasal <b>pump</b> <b>spray</b> to the sinuses and the nose in healthy volunteers and in CRS patients before and after sinus surgery. METHODS: (99 m) Tc-DTPA pulsating aerosols were applied in eleven CRSsNP patients without nasal polyps before and after sinus surgery. In addition, pulsating aerosols were studied in comparison to nasal pump sprays in eleven healthy volunteers. Total nasal and frontal, maxillary and sphenoidal sinus aerosol deposition and lung penetration were assessed by anterior and lateral planar gamma camera imaging. RESULTS: In healthy volunteers nasal pump sprays resulted in 100 % nasal, non-significant sinus and lung deposition, while pulsating aerosols resulted 61. 3 +/- 8. 6 % nasal deposition and 38. 7 % exit the other nostril. 9. 7 +/- 2. 0 % of the nasal dose penetrated into maxillary and sphenoidal sinuses. In CRS patients, total nasal deposition was 56. 7 +/- 13. 3 % and 46. 7 +/- 12. 7 % before and after sinus surgery, respectively (p< 0. 01). Accordingly, maxillary and sphenoidal sinus deposition was 4. 8 +/- 2. 2 % and 8. 2 +/- 3. 8 % of the nasal dose (p< 0. 01). Neither in healthy volunteers nor in CRS patients there was significant dose in the frontal sinuses. CONCLUSION: In contrast to nasal pump sprays, pulsating aerosols can deliver significant doses into posterior nasal spaces and paranasal sinuses, providing alternative therapy options before and after sinus surgery. Patients with chronic lung diseases based on clearance dysfunction may also benefit from pulsating aerosols, since these diseases also manifest in the upper airways...|$|E

Methods: A quantitative evaluation of the effect before and after Xylocaine spray on endotracheal tube pain relief, and a qualitative interview study of the impact of this intervention on patients’ satisfaction of intensive care in a prospective, clinical investigation. Those in the medical intensive care unit being endotracheal intubated and being able to clearly communicate with the caregivers were enrolled after providing their inform consent. We prescribed Xylocaine 10 % <b>pump</b> <b>spray</b> as frequently as demanded. Results: Nineteen patients were eligible for this study. The numerical rating scale of the throat pain before local Xylocaine spray were 8. 82 ± 0. 79, 7. 98 ± 0. 92, 7. 07 ± 0. 76, 6. 37 ± 0. 83 and 5. 47 ± 1. 23, sequentially, compared with after therapy results, which were 3. 84 ± 0. 86, 3. 57 ± 0. 74, 3. 06 ± 0. 70, 2. 61 ± 0. 77 and 1. 96 ± 0. 88 (p< 0. 01). The interval between Xylocaine demanded gradually increased with time after endotracheal tube intubation, and was also different between the daytime and the night-time on the first day of admission (p< 0. 001). Most of the patients suffered from throat pain due to endotracheal intubation, and they agreed their satisfaction was affected by the factors, the level of throat pain being controlled (correlation: 0. 89, p< 0. 01), and the caregivers’ attitude with regard to the pain control (correlation: 0. 46, p< 0. 05).

40|$|ObjectiveTo examine {{patient and}} wound {{variables}} presumed to influence healing outcomes {{in the context}} of therapeutic trials for chronic venous leg ulcers. MethodsThis double-blind, vehicle-controlled study was conducted with randomized assignment to one of four cell therapy dose groups (n = 46, 43, 44, 45) or vehicle control (n = 50). A 2 -week run-in period was used to exclude rapid healers and those with infection or uncontrolled edema. This was a multicenter (ambulatory, private, hospital-based and university-based practices, and wound care centers in North America) study. Adults ≥ 18 years old with chronic venous insufficiency associated with an uninfected venous leg ulcer (2 - 12 cm 2 area, 6 - 104 weeks' duration) were included in the study. Excluded were pregnant or lactating women, wounds with exposed muscle, tendon or bone, patients unable to tolerate compression bandages, or patients who had exclusionary medical conditions or exposure to certain products. Exclusion during run-in included patients with infection, uncontrolled severe edema or with healing rates ≥ 0. 349 cm/ 2 wk. Screen fail rate was 37 % (134 / 362), and the withdrawal rate was ∼ 10 % (23 of 228). Growth-arrested neonatal dermal fibroblasts and keratinocytes were delivered via <b>pump</b> <b>spray</b> in a fibrin sealant-based matrix, plus a foam dressing and four-layer compression bandaging. Treatment continued for 12 weeks or until healed, whichever occurred first. Patient demographic and wound-related variables were evaluated for influence on complete wound healing in all patients, as well as the subsets of treated and control patients. ResultsWound duration (P =. 004) and the presence of specific quantities of certain bacterial species (P <. 001) affected healing in the vehicle group, while healing in the cell-treated groups was influenced by wound duration (P =. 012), wound area (P =. 026), wound location (P =. 011), and specific quantities of certain bacterial species (P =. 002). Age, sex, race, diabetes, HbA 1 C, peripheral neuropathy, and serum prealbumin did not significantly affect healing. Body mass index was positively associated with healing in cell-treated patients. ConclusionsWound duration is a quantifiable surrogate for one or more undefined variables that can have a profound negative effect on venous leg ulcer healing. Although cell therapy overcame barriers to healing, the only specific barrier identified was the presence of certain bacterial species. Interventional trials of potentially effective new therapies can be most informative when patients with suspected barriers to healing are included. The specific measurement of candidate barriers such as microbial pathogens, wound inflammatory state, and fibroblast function should be considered in future randomized trials to improve our understanding of the basis for chronicity...|$|E
