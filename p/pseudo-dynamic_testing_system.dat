In {{order to}} point out the main factors in MDOF <b>pseudo-dynamic</b> <b>test</b> design of {{high-rise}} flexible, the key points in <b>pseudo-dynamic</b> <b>test</b> design using equivalent MDOF system were analyzed based on the theoretic derivation and numerical simulation, and the problems to notice in test design were pointed out, the <b>pseudo-dynamic</b> <b>test</b> results validity of high piers based on equivalent SDOF system was discussed, and the impact of high mode to the earthquake response of high-rise flexible structure was acquired. The results of numerical simulation of lumped-mass model prove that the contribution of high mode to the displacement of high flexible structure is little, and the displacement is mainly provided by the first-order mode, which is {{nothing to do with the}} selection of seismic waves. However, the high mode have great influence on seismic base shear and base moment of high flexible structure, and the influence level is associated with the properties of seismic wave spectrum. Under one specific earthquake wave, the second-order vibration may play a main contribution to seismic base shear and base moment of high-rise flexible structure. Therefore, it is proper to use equivalent two-degree of freedom <b>system</b> in <b>pseudo-dynamic</b> <b>test</b> of high piers.

The {{emphasis is on the}} simulation of earthquake effects, for which three principle methods are discussed: shaking tables, <b>pseudo-dynamic</b> <b>testing</b> and real-time testing. The latest developments in these areas are discussed in depth in the subsequent papers in this issue. While shaking tables and pseudo-dynamic methods are quite well established, both techniques have undergone significant advances in recent years, including improvements in control to ensure accurate reproduction of dynamic loads, and the construction of very large facilities aimed at eliminating the significant scaling problems. Development of the substructuring method has enabled large-scale <b>pseudo-dynamic</b> <b>tests</b> of parts of structures, coupled to numerical models of the remainder. Attempts are now being made to extend this approach to shaking tables. Recently, considerable efforts have been devoted to methods of testing both at large scale and in real time.

40|$|Analytical {{modeling}} of structures subjected to ground motions {{is an important}} aspect of fully dynamic earthquake-resistant design. In general, linear models are only sufficient to represent structural responses resulting from earthquake motions of small amplitudes. However, the response of structures during strong ground motions is highly nonlinear and hysteretic. System identification is an effective tool for developing analytical models from experimental data. Testing of full-scale prototype structures remains the most realistic and reliable source of inelastic seismic response data. <b>Pseudo-dynamic</b> <b>testing</b> is a recently developed quasi-static procedure for subjecting full-scale structures to simulated earthquake response. The present study deals with structural modeling and the determination of optimal linear and nonlinear models by applying system identification techniques to elastic and inelastic pseudo-dynamic data from a full-scale, six-story steel structure. It is shown that the feedback of experimental errors during the <b>pseudo-dynamic</b> <b>tests</b> significantly affected the higher modes and led to an effective negative damping for the third mode. The contributions of these errors are accounted for and the small-amplitude modal properties of the test structure are determined. These properties are in agreement with the values obtained from a shaking table test of a 0. 3 scale model. The nonlinear hysteretic behavior of the structure during strong ground motions is represented by a general class of Masing models. A simple model belonging to this class is chosen with parameters which can be estimated theoretically, thereby making this type of model potentially useful during the design stages. The above model is identified from the experimental data and then its prediction capability and application in seismic design and analysis are examined...|$|R
