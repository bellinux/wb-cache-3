40|$|The {{feasibility}} of large-scale separation of amino acids and inorganic ions by ion exchange columns {{has been demonstrated}} by considering a prototype problem involving one amino acid (proline), sodium chloride, and chloridic acid. The optimal design and operation of such a process {{has been based on}} an appropriate mathematical model, which includes the description of multicomponent ion exchange equilibria and the simulation of inter- and intraphase transport processes. The latter is based on a new lumping approximation of the Nernst-Planck equation for the diffusion of ions. The model contains some adjustable parameters that have been estimated from binary equilibrium data and experimental binary breakthrough curves of all the involved ionic species. The model reliability has been tested by comparison with experimental effluent histories of several adsorption-elution cycles involving multicomponent mixtures. Using the model, an optimal column operation, which includes ammonia feed before regeneration, has been designed for the separation of the <b>prototype</b> <b>mixture.</b> This result has been tested experimentally at the laboratory scale...|$|E
40|$|Within {{the fatal}} {{immunodeficiency}} disease-inducing strain of feline leukemia virus, FeLV-FAIDS, are viruses which range in pathogenicity from minimally (clone 61 E is the prototype) to acutely pathogenic, {{most of the}} latter of which are also replication defective (clone 61 C is the <b>prototype).</b> <b>Mixtures</b> of 61 E and 61 C virus and chimeras generated between them, but not 61 E alone, killed feline T cells. T-cell killing depended on changes within a 7 -amino-acid region near the C terminus of the gp 70 env gene or was achieved independently by changes within a 109 -amino-acid region encompassing the N terminus of gp 70. The carboxy-terminal change was also sufficient for induction of fatal immunodeficiency disease in cats. Other changes within the 61 C gp 70 gene enhanced T-cell killing, as did changes in the long terminal repeat, the latter of which also enhanced virus replication. T-cell killing correlated {{with high levels of}} intracellular unintegrated and proviral DNA, all of which were blocked by treatment of infected cells with sera from 61 C-immune cats or with a neutralizing monoclonal antibody. These findings indicate that T-cell killing is a consequence of superinfection and that the mutations in env critical to pathogenicity of the immunosuppressive variant result in a failure to establish superinfection interference in infected cells...|$|R
40|$|The {{collision}} {{cross section}} that controls thermalization of gas mixtures is the transport cross section σ(1) η {{and not the}} elastic cross section σel. The two are the same for pure s-wave scattering but not when higher partial waves contribute. We investigate the differences between them for <b>prototype</b> atomic <b>mixtures</b> and show that the distinction is important at energies above 100 μK for LiYb and 3 μK for RbYb and RbCs. For simple systems, both σ(1) η and σel follow universal energy dependence that depends only on the s-wave scattering length when expressed in reduced length and energy units...|$|R
40|$|AbstractPrevious work {{investigated}} a {{range of}} spatio-temporal constraints for fMRI data analysis to provide robust detection of neural activation. We present a mixture-based method for the spatio-temporal modelling of fMRI data. This approach assumes that fMRI time series are generated by a probabilistic superposition of a small set of spatio-temporal <b>prototypes</b> (<b>mixture</b> components). Each <b>prototype</b> comprises a temporal model that explains fMRI signals on a single voxel and the model's “region of influence” through a spatial prior over the voxel space. As the key ingredient of our temporal model, the Hidden Process Model (HPM) framework proposed in Hutchinson et al. (2009) is adopted to infer the overlapping cognitive processes triggered by stimuli. Unlike the original HPM framework, we use a parametric model of Haemodynamic Response Function (HRF) so that biological constraints are naturally incorporated in the HRF estimation. The spatial priors are {{defined in terms of}} a parameterised distribution. Thus, the total number of parameters in the model does not depend on the number of voxels. The resulting model provides a conceptually principled and computationally efficient approach to identify spatio-temporal patterns of neural activation from fMRI data, in contrast to most conventional approaches in the literature focusing on the detection of spatial patterns. We first verify the proposed model in a controlled experimental setting using synthetic data. The model is further validated on real fMRI data obtained from a rapid event-related visual recognition experiment (Mayhew et al., 2012). Our model enables us to evaluate in a principled manner the variability of neural activations within individual regions of interest (ROIs). The results strongly suggest that, compared with occipitotemporal regions, the frontal ones are less homogeneous, requiring two HPM prototypes per region. Despite the rapid event-related experimental design, the model is capable of disentangling the perceptual judgement and motor response processes that are both activated in the frontal ROIs. Spatio-temporal heterogeneity in the frontal regions seems to be associated with diverse dynamic localizations of the two hidden processes in different subregions of frontal ROIs...|$|R
40|$|This {{research}} was conducted to establish mixture proportioning and production technologies for ready-mixed concrete containing pulp and paper mill residual solids and to study technical, economical, and performance benefits of using the residual solids in the concrete. Fibrous residuals generated from pulp and paper mills were used, and concrete mixture proportions and productions technologies were first optimized under controlled laboratory conditions. Based on the mixture proportions established in the laboratory, <b>prototype</b> field concrete <b>mixtures</b> were manufactured at a ready-mixed concrete plant. Afterward, a field construction demonstration was held to demonstrate the production and placement of structural-grade cold-weather-resistant concrete containing residual solids...|$|R
40|$|In {{this work}} Grand Canonical Monte Carlo (GCMC) {{simulations}} {{have been used}} to study hydrogen sulfide (H 2 S) removal from biogas streams by different zeolites such as FAU (Faujasite, NaX and NaY), LTA (zeolite A (Lynde division, Union Carbide)) and MFI (Zeolite Socony Mobil – five). Additionally, quantum mechanics (QM) molecular simulations have been performed to obtain structures and partial charges of some sorbates. The computational procedure adopted has been validated by comparison with experimental data available for H 2 S removal in atmospheric environment by zeolite NaY. In order to obtain a priority list in terms of both H 2 S isotherms and adsorption selectivity, adsorption simulations for pure H 2 S at low pressures and for a <b>prototype</b> biogas <b>mixture</b> (i. e., CO 2, CH 4, and H 2 S) have been performed and compared. The adsorption mechanisms and competition for accessible adsorption sites in terms of thermodynamic behavior have been also examined. Overall, the results obtained in this work could be routinely applied to different case studies, thus yielding deeper qualitative and quantitative insights into adsorption pollutant removal processes in environmental fields...|$|R
40|$|After the {{handwritten}} segmentation process, it {{is common}} to have connected digits. This is due to the great size and shape digit variations. In addition, the acquisition and the binarization processes can add noise to the images. These under segmented images, when given as input to classifiers which are specialists to deal with digits separately, should lead to errors. Aiming to detect the handwritten connected digits, it is herein introduced a hybrid system architecture {{to be used as a}} segmentation pos-processing task. The proposed system is based on a prototype selection scheme that combines self-generating <b>prototypes</b> and Gaussian <b>mixtures.</b> Besides, this work presents a set of features for the proposed problem. A real-world database of handwritten digits was used to validate the new approach. The results obtained in the experimental study showed that the hybrid strategy achieved promising accuracy rates. 1...|$|R
40|$|The {{support and}} cooling {{structures}} add important {{contributions to the}} thickness, in radiation length, of vertex detectors. In order to minimize the material budget of pixel sensors, we developed {{a new approach to}} integrate the cooling into the silicon devices. The microchannels are formed in silicon using isotropic SF 6 plasma etching in a DRIE (deep reactive ion etcher) equipment. Due to their peculiar profiles, the channels can be sealed by a layer of a PECVD silicon oxide. We have realized on a silicon wafer microchannels with different geometries and hydraulic diameters. We describe the main fabrication steps of microchannels with focus on the channel definition. The experimental results are reported on the thermal characterization of several <b>prototypes,</b> using a <b>mixture</b> of glycol and water as a liquid coolant. The prototypes have shown high cooling efficiency and high-pressure breaking strength. (C) 2012 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R
