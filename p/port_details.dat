40|$|This paper {{presents}} a modular multilevel converter (MMC) based DC/DC converter with LCL inner circuit for HVDC transmission and DC grids. Three main design challenges are addressed. The first challenge {{is the use}} of MMCs with higher operating frequency compared to common transformer-based DC/DC converters where MMC operating frequency is limited to a few hundred hertz due to core losses. The second issue is the DC fault response. With the LCL circuit, the steady state fault current is limited to a low magnitude which is tolerable by MMC semiconductors. Mechanical DC circuit breakers can therefore be used to interrupt fault current for permanent faults and extra sub-module bypass thyristors are not necessary to protect antiparallel diodes. Thirdly, a novel controller structure is introduced with multiple coordinate frames ensuring zero local reactive power at both bridges in the whole load range. The proposed controller structure is also expandable to a DC hub with multiple <b>ports.</b> <b>Detailed</b> simulations using PSCAD/EMTDC are performed to verify the aforementioned design solutions in normal and fault conditions...|$|R

40|$|Abstract — This paper {{presents}} {{a framework for}} the porting of the SoftFloat floating-point implementation package to an FPGA with 6502 soft core and evaluates {{the performance of the}} package on this platform by testing a 2 nd order Butterworth Low Pass Filter. Within the framework, 8051, PIC and FPGA architectures are explained and the three platforms are compared for control applications in order to explain why FPGA with soft core is chosen as a platform. The IEEE 754 - Standard for Binary Floating-Point Arithmetic is explained for Single Precision Floating-Point Format in order to give the reader an insight in the representation of floating-point numbers, special values, floatingpoint arithmetic, rounding modes and exceptions. The <b>porting</b> <b>details</b> and execution times for available floating-point functions are presented. To evaluate the performance of the package, an experiment is carried out using a 2 nd order Butterworth Low Pass Filter. The design of the Butterworth Low Pass Filter and its implementation in microcontrollers using direct form realization is presented. Fixed-point arithmetic is introduced and a methodology is presented for the choice of the number of integer and fraction bits. The effects of truncation and filter coefficient perturbation on the filter properties are discussed in detail. I...|$|R
