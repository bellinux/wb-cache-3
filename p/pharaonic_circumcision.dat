40|$|Abstract Background Female genital {{mutilation}} (FGM) is commonly practiced mainly in a belt reaching from East to West Africa {{north of the}} equator. The practice is known across socio-economic classes and among different ethnic, religious, and cultural groups. Few studies have been appropriately designed to measure {{the health effects of}} FGM. However, the outcome of FGM on intersex individuals has never been discussed before. Case presentation The patient first presented as a female with delayed puberty. Hormonal analysis revealed a normal serum prolactin level of 215 Mu/L, a low FSH of 0. 5 Mu/L, and a low LH of 1. 1 Mu/L. Type IV FGM (<b>Pharaonic</b> <b>circumcision)</b> had been performed during childhood. Chromosomal analysis showed a 46, XY karyotype and ultrasonography verified a soft tissue structure in the position of the prostate. Conclusion FGM pose a threat to the diagnosis and management of children with abnormal genital development in the Sudan and similar societies. </p...|$|E
40|$|Somalia has {{the highest}} global {{prevalence}} (98 %) of female circumcision (FC), and, despite {{a long history of}} abandonment efforts, it is not clear {{as to whether or not}} these programmes have changed people’s positive attitudes toward the practice. Against this background, this paper explores the attitudes of Somalis living in Hargeisa and Galkayo districts to the practice of FC. Methods. A purposive sampling of 24 Somalis, including activists and practitioners, men and women, was conducted in Somalia. Unstructured interviews were employed to explore the participants' knowledge of FC, their attitudes toward the continuation/discontinuation of the practice, and the type they want to continue or not to continue. Result. The findings of this qualitative study indicate that there is a strong resistance towards the abandonment of the practice in Somalia. The support for the continuation of Sunna circumcision is widespread, while there is a quite large rejection of <b>Pharaonic</b> <b>circumcision.</b> Conclusion. Therefore, since the “zero tolerance policy” has failed to change people’s support for the continuation of the practice in Somalia, programmes that promote the pinch of the clitoral skin and verbal alteration of status, with the goal of leading to total abandonment of FC, should be considered for the Somali context...|$|E
40|$|At least 87 % of Nassarawa Eggon {{women were}} infibulated {{at the age}} of 7 or 8. Infibulation, also known as <b>Pharaonic</b> <b>Circumcision,</b> is the most drastic form of female genital {{mutilation}} practiced in Nassarawa Eggon. The article examines the rationale for and the consequences of the practice in establishing the differences in the level of promiscuity, sexual satisfaction, medical and adverse physical level between the circumcised (x) and uncircumcised (y), particularly in Nassarawa Eggon, Nasarawa state-Nigeria. A survey method of research was employed, where 30 -circuncised (mean 62. 8) and 30 -uncircumcised females (mean 48. 7) of Nassarawa Eggon were used as participants. Scores were scored X= 1884, mean= 62. 8, SD = 7. 5 and y= 1460, mean= 48. 7, SD= 8. 2 for circumcised and uncircumcised females respectively using t-test independent for the analysis. The findings of the study revealed that the major causes and reasons of female circumcision are problems relating to the cultural orientation, religious belief, social and medical reasons. It is argued that the incidence of the practice should be reduced and that policy directed towards this aim should {{be an integral part of}} other development policies. Since women’s gender identity is at stake, women should be actively involved in formulating and implementing the necessary policies. Their involvement is one of the main prerequisites for progress in the abolition of infibulation and the maintenance of smooth development of psychological thought and personality development.
