40|$|Some applications, {{including}} disaster {{monitoring and}} recovery networks, use low-power wide-area networks (LPWAN). LPWAN sensors capture data bits and transmit them to public carrier networks (e. g., cellular networks) via dedicated gateways. One {{of the challenges}} encountered in disaster management scenarios revolves around the carry/forward sensed data and geographical location information dissemination to the disaster relief operatives (disaster relief agency; DRA) to identify, characterise, and prioritise the affected areas. There are network topology options to reach its destination, including cellular, circuit switched, and peer-to-peer networks. In the context of natural disaster prediction, {{it is vital to}} access geographical location data as well as the timestamp. This paper proposes the usage of Pseudo A Number (PAN), that is, the calling <b>party</b> <b>address,</b> which is used by every network to include the location information instead of the actual calling <b>party</b> <b>address</b> of the gateway in LPWAN. This PAN information can be further analysed by the DRA to identify the affected areas and predict the complications of the disaster impacts in addition to the past history of damages. This paper aims to propose a solution that can predict disaster proceedings based on propagation and the velocity of impact using vector calculation of the location data and the timestamp, which are transmitted by sensors through the PAN of the gateway in LPWAN...|$|E

40|$|In 1991, {{after the}} first Gulf War, the Marsh Arabs of {{southern}} Iraq rose up against the Hussein government, with U. S. encouragement. The rebellion failed; in retaliation the government embarked on a massive water diversion project to drain the wetlands. In 1970 the wetlands covered nearly 11, 000 square kilometers; today they cover fewer than a thousand. The Marsh Arabs whose ancestors {{had lived in the}} wetlands for five thousand years were forced to flee; many died. The drainage of the wetlands was a deliberate and calculated act of genocide and ecocide. At the time, Iraq was a party to several international agreements that made its acts illegal. The various environmental treaties to which Iraq was a party and customary international law regarding transboundary environmental harm provide little recourse for the Marsh Arabs, although they may provide the basis for claims to be pursued by neighboring states. 	Of the other treaties to which Iraq is a party, the Genocide Convention most clearly prohibits acts such as those committed by the Iraqi government against the Marsh Arabs. Common Article 3 of the Geneva Conventions addresses individual murders and extrajudicial killings of Marsh Arabs, but probably does not address the problem of the destruction of the wetlands as a whole. The Covenants on Economic and Cultural Rights and Civil and Political Rights provide similar protections, and provide that a people may not be deprived of its means of subsistence, as the Marsh Arabs have been. Treaties to which Iraq is not a <b>party</b> <b>address</b> the specific problem of environmental modification used in war or as an instrument of persecution of an ethnic group. ENMOD and the Rome Statute prohibit environmental warfare of the type engaged in by Iraq, but {{it is unlikely that the}} provisions of either have been accepted as custom in the practice of states. Protocols I and II to the Geneva Conventions of 1949, however, are probably expressions of customary international law, and may even express jus cogens or non-derogable norms. Of these, Protocol I addresses environmental harm far more directly. Under Protocol I, the Iraqi government’s action against the southern Mesopotamian wetlands was illegal because its effects were widespread, long-lasting, and severe, and because it was a prohibited reprisal against the natural environment...|$|E
40|$|The American Communist movement, {{born out}} of a left-wing split from the American Socialist Party in 1919, was divided into several hostile organisations that {{understood}} very little about American politics, culture or society. In its early years, the Communist International (Comintern) repeatedly intervened into the American Party. Far from hindering the Party's {{understanding and appreciation of}} American conditions, this intervention helped transform the Party from a marginal sect of isolated immigrants in 1920, to an important part of American politics in the 1930 s. This intervention stemmed from the desire of the early Comintern, under the leadership of Lenin and Trotsky, to create an international revolutionary Communist movement. However, in the mid- 1920 s, as the leadership and ideology of the Russian Communist party changed. Under the rubric of building 'socialism in one country', the Comintern now intervened more and more to create a stable, Pro-Stalin leadership. The first portion of this thesis, comprising the first four chapters, illustrates how between 1919 and 1923 Comintern intervention was necessary to politically and organisationally construct a Party. The Comintern helped achieve unity amongst the competing groups; forced the Party {{to take advantage of the}} opportunities for legal work; compelled the Party to intervene into the labour movement. The next four chapters examine the change in Comintern intervention between 1923 and 1929. During this period, internecine factionalism, increasingly devoid of a political basis,t ore the Party asunder,and sapped its ability to intervene into society. The Comintern continued to intervene, but largely to play one faction off against another. In the aftermath of the 1928 Sixth Congress, the Party leadership purged first its left, Trotskyist wing, led by James P. Cannon, and within the year, the right, Bukharnite, wing, led by Jay Lovestone. The Comintern then installed a pliant leadership that finally ended factionalism and carried the now Stalinised Party into the 1930 s. The final chapter analyses the changing Communist perspective on the 'Negro Question', from ignoring black rights to championing the right of Southern blacks to independence. Here, the Comintern, acting on pressure from pioneer black Communists, insisted that the <b>Party</b> <b>address</b> this important issue. At the Sixth Congress, the Comintern adopted the theory that blacks in the American South were a oppressed nationality, and had the right to form a separate state. Whilst this programme was not in accord with reality, it forced the Party to aggressively fight for black rights, so that by the 1930 s it was well known for its stand for black liberation.
