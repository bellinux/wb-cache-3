40|$|It {{was with}} {{considerable}} pleasure and enthusiasm that I accepted {{the invitation of}} Christine Trampusch and Bruno <b>Palier,</b> the editors of this special issue, to respond to their small but excellent collection of papers on process tracing in political economy. Like them (Trampusch and <b>Palier</b> 2016), I am convinced that what they and others typically call process tracing can, if appropriately (and, indeed, sparingly) used, help open the black box of causation in social, political and economy systems; it can, in short, help us fashion better explanations of social, political and economic outcomes. I am also convinced, like them, that the clarification of what process tracing actually entails methodologically, as is the principal aim of this special issue, will help us better make that case. In the, alas, all too limited space I have, I cannot and hence do not seek to provide a detailed commentary and reflection {{on each of the}} papers in this collection. Instead, I will keep my comments very general – using, as my point of departure, the editors’ very useful framing essay. I will confine myself to three appreciative, though at the same time critical yet I hope constructive, observations in the hope of advancing the debat...|$|E

30|$|Our paper {{makes two}} contributions, one {{empirical}} and one theoretical. The empirical contribution concerns our {{characterization of the}} effects of recent labour market policy reforms. In contrast to the more pessimistic characterizations of labour market liberalization (see, for example, Streeck 2009) we highlight some of the positive dimensions of recent changes, especially the role of non-standard work as a bridge to standard work, and the increase in overall employment, in particular in services, so that we can see dualisation also as part of a more or less successful adaptation (see for example, Reisenbichler and Morgan 2012; Rinne and Zimmermann 2011; Hassel 2014). The paper’s theoretical contribution is its focus on the permeability of the labour market segments. We argue that the dividing line between standard and non-standard work is not as clear and permanent as, for example, <b>Palier</b> and Thelen (2010) claim.|$|E

5000|$|After {{his major}} league playing days were over, <b>Palys</b> {{continued}} {{to play in the}} minor leagues till 1963.

The next batter hit a grounder to first and <b>Palys</b> danced up and down till the ball hit him in the leg. Under baseball rules, a base hit is recorded for the batter and the baserunner declared out if the latter is struck by a ball in fair territory.

40|$|Poverty, {{increased}} inequality, {{and social}} exclusion {{are back on}} the political agenda, {{not only as a}} consequence of the Great Recession of 2008, but also because of a seemingly structural trend towards increased inequality in advanced industrial societies that has persisted since the 1970 s. Policies in labor markets, social policy, and political representation are strongly linked in the creation, widening, and deepening of insider-outsider divides [...] a process known as dualization. While it is certainly not the only driver of increasing inequality, its development across multiple domains makes dualization one of the most important current trends affecting developed societies. The comparative perspective of this book provides insights into why Nordic countries witness lower levels of insider-outsider divides, whereas in continental, liberal and southern welfare states, they are more likely to constitute a core characteristic of the political economy. Most importantly, the comparisons presented in this book point to the crucial importance of politics and political choice in driving and shaping the social outcomes of deindustrialization. While increased structural labor market divides can be found across all countries, governments have a strong responsibility in shaping the distributive consequences of these labor market changes. Insider-outsider divides are ultimately the result of political choice. A landmark publication, this volume is geared for faculty and graduate students of economics, political science, social policy, and sociology, as well as policymakers concerned with increasing inequality in a period of deep economic and social crisis.

30|$|Associated {{with these}} pressures, {{there has been}} a growing {{internal}} diversity and increased segmentation within the German post-war model, accelerated by the Hartz labour market reforms (eg. Eichhorst 2014; Hassel 2014; Jürgens et al. 2006; Kirchner et al. 2012, 2014; <b>Palier</b> and Thelen 2010). A notable watershed was the defeat of the metal workers’ union, IG Metall, in 2003 and the so-called Pforzheim Agreement of February 2004. This facilitated further development of local concessions on the terms of industry agreements in order to defend jobs. 3 According to Streeck (2009, p.  53) it gave works councils an ‘effective veto over union policy’. Although presented at the time as a practical measure to save jobs, the agreement has been widely regarded as a major defeat for the union, opening the way for greater segmentation as weaker firms would be the ones to take advantage of its provisions (Silva 2013, p.  353).|$|E
3000|$|The {{institutional}} {{development of the}} German welfare regime in the past 3 decades is puzzling {{from the perspective of}} both literatures. Most analyses of social policy development since about 1990 emphasize the liberalization of both social insurance and social services (Streeck 2007; Trampusch 2009; <b>Palier</b> and Thelen 2010; Vail 2009). Although authors disagree about the extent of liberalization, the general trend is clear: recent reforms have weakened the breadwinner bias of social policy institutions; weakened corporatist administration of core programs like pensions and health care; introduced market mechanisms into core programs; and increased individuals’ and the state’s share of financing relative to contributions. Given the emphasis on policy stability in welfare state regime scholarship and the VoC literature, these shifts in social protection are surprising. Do fundamental changes in the post-war political consensus or the workings of the economic institutions crafted via the post-war settlement explain these shifts, or are other causal forces at work?

30|$|Much of the {{literature}} on Germany and neoliberal globalization focuses on growing segmentation and on the concessions that core workers in competitive firms have made to protect their jobs (Bosch et al. 2007; Eichhorst 2012; Hassel 2011; Spermann 2011; Thelen and <b>Palier</b> 2010). This literature, however, emphasizes the changes outside the traditional structures of full time production work within firms: In particular, it focuses on the emergence of lower paid, part time, temporary, and precarious workers within firms, industries and in the core labor market. As important as these developments undeniably are, {{the literature}} either ignores or mischaracterizes developments that are occurring within the so-called core governance and production arrangements in the German political economy. Views either overly pessimistically lament the inescapable decline of German trade unions and traditional German skilled labor based production in the face of globalization induced marketization of all relations, or they over optimistically suggests that the old arrangements, aside from concessions on wages and temporary labor, remain more or less functionally in tact.|$|E
40|$|Family {{policies}} in the Nordic countries gain international attention. 1 An important {{reason for this is}} that they appear to produce good results: the Nordic countries combine comparatively high levels of fertility with high female employment rates and low rates of child poverty. Feminists, anti-poverty activists, and social liberals generally tend to look to the Nordic countries with curiosity and admiration (Lister, 2009). Recently it has also been argued that the Nordic countries not only produce social equality and high levels of living, but also enact active policies targeted at families that enhance productivity and lay the foundation for economic success (e. g. Esping-Andersen, 2002). Such policies simultaneously encourage women to work outside the home, and create good conditions for children’s early education. Working mothers improve economic efficiency, broaden the tax base, and improve household income, thus reducing child poverty. It is hoped that early childhood education will create more equal life chances for children and secure a productive labour force for the future (cf. Esping-Andersen, 2002; Morel, <b>Palier,</b> & Palme, 2012). Whether viewed from the perspective of gender equality, child welfare, or social investment, then, Nordic family policies appear to have some very useful features...|$|E
