5|$|The bat is a hitting tool, {{traditionally}} {{made of a}} single, solid <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> <b>wood.</b> Other {{materials are}} now commonly used for nonprofessional games. It is a hard round stick, about 2.5inches (6.4 centimeters) in diameter at the hitting end, tapering to a narrower handle and culminating in a knob. Bats used by adults are typically around 34inches (86 centimeters) long, and not longer than 42inches (106 centimeters).|$|E
5|$|The main {{advantage}} of composite bows over self bows (made {{from a single}} <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> <b>wood)</b> is their combination of smaller size with high power. They are therefore more convenient than self bows when the archer is mobile, as from horseback, or from a chariot. Almost all composite bows are also recurve bows as the shape curves away from the archer; this design gives higher draw-weight {{in the early stages}} of the archer's draw, storing somewhat more total energy for a given final draw-weight. It would be possible to make a wooden bow that has the same shape, length and draw-weight as a traditional composite bow, but it could not store the energy, and would break before full draw.|$|E

These wide strips are called ivi'ivi. The faulalo is a tubular <b>piece</b> (or <b>pieces)</b> <b>of</b> <b>wood</b> about four inches in diameter running around the circumference of {{the house at the}} lower extremity of the roof, and is supported on the poulalo. The auau is one or more <b>pieces</b> <b>of</b> <b>wood</b> <b>of</b> substantial size resting {{on the top of the}} poutu. At a distance of about two feet between each are circular <b>pieces</b> <b>of</b> <b>wood</b> running around the house and extending from the faulalo to the top of the building.

Deciding that traveling in search of people towards {{the top of the}} mountain, where they see a structure, would be a better medical option than heading back home, they continue towards the mountaintops. As night falls, they rest in the wild. The man takes the first guard shift, and the stars in the night sky time lapse behind him. He wakes the woman to take his turn to sleep. When he eventually wakes up, the two characters press on with the intention of turning back if they do not find people.|$|E

She defeats and injures Matt; when she manages to remove his mask, she discovers Matt's secret identity and innocence. Forced to fight Bullseye alone, Elektra is overpowered and killed by the hitman. A wounded Matt {{makes his way to}} a church, where he is looked after by his confidante, Father Everett, who knows his secret identity. After recovering slightly, Matt fights Bullseye, who had followed him to the church. Bullseye discovers that loud noise is Matt's weakness and prepares to kill him with a spiked <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> <b>wood</b> after incapacitating him. Matt blocks the attack and hears an FBI sniper stationed on the neighboring building preparing to fire. As the bullet is fired, Matt moves out of the bullet's path and pulls Bullseye's hands into it. When Bullseye pleads for mercy, Matt throws him from the church's steeple. Bullseye lands on the hood of Urich's car, severely injured but alive.|$|E
