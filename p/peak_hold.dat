40|$|Thirteen {{extensively}} characterised {{grain sorghum}} varieties were evaluated {{in a series}} of 7 broiler bioassays. The efficiency of energy utilisation of broiler chickens offered sorghum-based diets is problematic and the bulk of dietary energy is derived from sorghum starch. For this reason, rapid visco-analysis (RVA) starch pasting profiles were determined as they may have the potential to assess the quality of sorghum as a feed grain for chicken-meat production. In review, it was found that concentrations of kafirin and total phenolic compounds were negatively correlated with <b>peak</b> and <b>holding</b> RVA viscosities to significant extents across 13 sorghums. In a meta-analysis of 5 broiler bioassays it was found that <b>peak,</b> <b>holding,</b> breakdown and final RVA viscosities were positively correlated with ME:GE ratios and peak and breakdown RVA viscosities with apparent metabolizable energy corrected for nitrogen (AMEn) to significant extents. In a sixth study involving 10 sorghum-based diets <b>peak,</b> <b>holding</b> and breakdown RVA viscosities were positively correlated with ME:GE ratios and AMEn. Therefore, it emerged that RVA starch pasting profiles do hold promise as a relatively rapid means to assess sorghum quality as a feed grain for chicken-meat production. This potential appears to be linked to quantities of kafirin and total phenolic compounds present in sorghum and it would seem that both factors depress RVA starch viscosities in vitro and, in turn, also depress energy utilisation in birds offered sorghum-based diets. Given that other feed grains do not contain kafirin and possess considerably lower concentrations of phenolic compounds, their RVA starch pasting profiles may not be equally indicative...|$|R

The solution used for formation of alumina layer in all cases was an electrolyte containing 180 g/l sulphuric acid at a constant forming voltage (voltastatic anodizing). In order to assess the mechanical properties of the obtained anodic alumina layers a series of nanoindentation tests was performed employing different indentation procedures. The two mechanical characteristics of the alumina films, the indentation hardness (HIT) and the indentation modulus (EIT), were determined {{by means of the}} instrumented indentation and the Oliver & Pharr approximation method.

40|$|CdZnTe is {{the premier}} {{semiconductor}} material for room-temperature gamma-ray spectroscopy and imaging. The high {{effective atomic number}} of 52 and high density of 6 grams per centimeter cubed yield excellent detection efficiency; a pixelated detector design allows for 3 D position sensitivity and material non-uniformity corrections resulting in < 1 % FWHM energy resolution at 662 keV; the wide bandgap of 1. 61 eV permits room temperature operation. Fabrication improvements and the feasibility of floating-temperature operation are analyzed in this work. Several fabrication changes are tested to mitigate gain nonuniformity in some pixels during operation. Changing the substrate from printed circuit board to ceramic improves operation, maintains spectroscopic performance, and is adopted. Switching the electrode contacts from gold to platinum drastically raises the leakage current and is rejected. Two proprietary fabrication techniques are proposed. The first, fabrication A, raises the leakage, degrades spectroscopic performance, and is rejected. The second, fabrication B, causes greater gain nonuniformity, degrades resolution, and is also rejected. To reduce system power consumption, a temperature correction algorithm is developed that allows data collection at operating temperatures different from the calibration temperature without performance degradation. This begins with isolating the temperature effects to the detector rather than the readout electronics, and demonstrating {{the accuracy of the}} electronic baseline as a surrogate for temperature. Considering the temperature effects, linear gain corrections only partially recover spectroscopic performance and cannot account for pixel nonuniformity or energy nonlinearity. Parametric corrections pinpoint specific aspects of system operation susceptible to change with temperature. <b>Peak</b> <b>hold</b> drop, depth of interaction, and gain as a function of depth are individually corrected and recover spectroscopic performance almost entirely.

40|$|Analysis of the multi-nerve impulses {{by means}} of {{electrophysiological}} method has become {{important to understand the}} parallel information processing in the nervous system. We have previously reported the multi-impulse analyzing system by using the microcomputer (MEK 6800 D-II) and additional electronic circuits. Impulses from two nerve cells or more were classified according to their amplitude. That was executed by machine language program. The system operated sufficiently to analyze the impulses recorded in nerve bundle from mechanoreceptors on the crayfish antennule. However, there were a few problems in the system. The one was a slight time lag of the peak discriminator which detected the peak time of an impulse and triggered A-D converter. The other was flicker of realtime display caused by sequential time sharing between data input routine and display one. Those problems are improved in the present new system. The former is overcome by using the <b>peak</b> <b>hold</b> circuit in place of the peak discriminator, and the latter by introducing the interrupt technique when both impulse height and interspike interval are gotten into the microcomputer. An additional microcomputer (CBM) which can execute BASIC program is connected with the previous one in order to supply the lack of programing flexibility on the machine language system. The connection between those two microcomputer consists of a control line and 8 -bit bidirectional data bus. By using the only one control line, the program for data transfer is made as simple as possible. Then, the new system is made to reconcile processing speed in machine language system and flexibility in BASIC system. Furthermore, CBM 3032 have an input-output port based on the standard IEEE 488 bus. A X-Y plotter (WX 4671) is connected with this port through an interface circuit.

40|$|Total 12 {{units of}} high power klystron-modulator systems are under {{continuous}} {{operation in the}} Pohang Light Source (PLS) linac. The peak powers of the modulator and the klystron are 200 MW and 80 MW, respectively. The total heater run time of an oldest klystron system has been accumulated over 75, 000 -hours as of now. Therefore, {{it is necessary to}} monitor the klystron operational status for stable beam operation. It can be achieved by measuring the klystron perveance to diagnose characteristics of klystron. Up to now, the operator manually performs it. We have designed the perveance monitor by processing the sensing signal of a beam voltage and current of the klystron. It takes advantage of the time saving in diagnosing klystron performance. In addition, a highly accurate current and voltage sensor is one of the critical components of the measuring system. This paper presents the design concepts and initial test results of the perveance monitor to diagnose characteristics of klystron. Perveance definition The klystron is a device for amplifying signals at microwave radio frequencies. The perveance is an important design parameter since it is totally determined by electron gun dimensions. When the cathode is operated in the space-charge-limited region, the emission current will be a specific function of the applied voltage [2]. The constant, k, {{is a function of the}} geometry of the cathode-anode structure, and is termed perveance. It is space-charge characteristic between electrodes in a klystron tube. It is equal to the current (Ik) divided by the electronic potential (Vk) of the collector raised to the 3 / 2 powers [3]. Basic design concept The perveance monitor can be divided into two major sections: a pulse conditioning & <b>peak</b> <b>hold</b> module (PCPHM) section, a perveance processor module (PPM) section.

IITMSAT is a student driven Nano-satellite embraced by IIT Madras leading to the development of Space-based Proton-Electron Energy Detector (SPEED). It is a payload that is being developed to be launched on-board IITMSAT. The scientific objective of the payload is to gather data on the variations in the charge particle flux below the inner Van Allen radiation belts. SPEED is designed to obtain energy spectra of high-energy protons and electrons, specifically designed to investigate correlations between variations in these spectra and seismic activity, solar flares and lightning storms. The SPEED electronics consists of <b>Peak</b> <b>hold</b> Detector, Charge-Sensitive Pre-Amplifier, TIVVA microcontroller and Photo Multiplier Tubes. This paper describes the development of the high voltage power supply for the photo multiplier tubes (PMT) of SPEED. In SPEED, photo multiplier tubes operates at around 1000 V to 1300 V with very strict ripple requirements and requires very precise and controlled high voltage. Due to their high gain and extremely light sensitivity photomultipliers (PMTs) can easily be damaged by applying excessive light to the photocathode and thus exceeding the maximum output current. A novel compact and controllable high voltage power supply based on integrated DC-DC converters is developed which provides ultralow ripple of about 0. 3 % to 0. 5 % at an output of 1000 volts which is further reduced by the 5 th order low-pass filter circuitry. Innovative automatic current protection circuitry is developed for protecting PMT from being damaged by saturation current. We are able to develop voltage monitoring and regulation system for high voltage with a voltage regulation of 0. 1 %. Voltage regulation is achieved by control software based on TIVA microcontroller based solution. A number of tests have been performed to provide very reliable and efficient high voltage power supply for PMT.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the present study was to develop an {{automated}} measuring instrument of peripheral pulse transit time (PTT) as an attempt to resolve the problems, which occur when the peripheral pulse wave (PW) is detected by a fixed trigger level. An important innovation for the present instrument was the decision to employ a variable trigger level (Vt), beat by beat, with evaluation of the two troublesome phenomena seen frequently in peripheral PW. Using the <b>peak</b> <b>hold</b> circuit, the fluctuation of the base line was evaluated as the negative peak amplitude (NPA), and the variation of the pulse amplitude as the peak-to-peak amplitude (PPA). Vt was then electrically decided by evaluating an equation; Vt = NPA + (n/ 10) × PPA. Here the number n, present by a PW trigger switch (n = 1, 2, …, 10), decided the slice rate at which the ascending limb of PW was detected, and the distorting effects clue to the conduction of PW were decreased when the presetting of n was rather small. Accomplishing this innovation, however, required that the PW he monitored as well and that it be memorized until the decision on Vt had been made. A bucket brigade device (BBD), a recently developed analogue delay unit, was composed of 4096 condenser-switch pairs and conducted the PW input in such a manner that the clock pulse controlled the switch on-off and, therefore, the timing of signal delivery between 2 adjacent condensers. The PW could be delayed from 205 msec to 512 msec by adjusting the clock cycle beforehand, with this adjustment being necessary to overcome the individual difference in peripheral PW. Thus the start signal of the PTT measurement was given by detecting the delayed ECG (generated by another BBD) at a fixed preset trigger level and the stop signal was given by detecting the simultaneously delayed PW at a variable trigger level Vt in each cardiac cycle. These 2 signals became the final outputs of the instrument, and the PTT could be measured by using a universal counter. A preliminary experiment demonstrated that the fixed trigger method that had been customarily used resulted in a more highly susceptible PTT to the troublesome phenomena mentioned above than the variable trigger method produced in the present instrument. Altogether, it was concluded that the instrument developed in the present study had a potential for continuous tracking of peripheral PTT beat by beat without these problems...|$|E
