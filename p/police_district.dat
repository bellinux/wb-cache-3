5|$|Each <b>police</b> <b>district</b> may {{dictate that}} {{operational}} personnel {{have a higher}} amount of training, for instance 80 hours is required in Oslo. Officers are certified at five levels, of which the top four can use firearms. Level three consists of a call-out unit for each <b>police</b> <b>district,</b> consisting of a combined 646 people. This requires 103 hours of special training per year. Higher levels are required for body-guard service (55 officers) and the Emergency Response Union (73 officers).

5|$|All {{identification}} of people {{was performed in}} Tromsø, as a cooperation between Troms <b>Police</b> <b>District,</b> National Criminal Investigation Service and the University Hospital of North Norway. By 18 September, all people had been identified, and the bodies were transported to Russia and Ukraine on 20 September after a short memorial in Tromsøhallen.

5|$|If {{an offense}} is filed, the issue may be {{investigated}} by police on duty. Permission for {{search and seizure}} is issued by the police prosecutor on duty at the <b>police</b> <b>district.</b> Apprehended people are permitted a free defense counsel at the public's expense. If the police wish to keep apprehended people in detention, the issue is brought to the relevant district court, a process which may be repeated several times if the custody needs to be extended. Investigations are led by a police prosecutor. During investigation, {{the case may be}} concluded as a non-criminal offense, dismissed, or transferred to another <b>police</b> <b>district.</b> Minor cases with a positive finding may be resolved by police penalty notice, settlement by a conflict resolution board and withdrawal of prosecution.|$|E

5|$|Two {{parallel}} investigations were undertaken, one by HSL {{and one by}} Namdal <b>Police</b> <b>District.</b> The latter criticized the former because there were not given access to the cockpit voice recorder (CVR). Since 1989 both {{the police and the}} prosecuting authority had not been represented in the accident investigations. HSL emphasized that they had no legal obligation to submit the tapes to the police, that the police had not asked for the tapes after Widerøe Flight 839 in 1990 and that the Ministry of Transport and Communications supported this line. The reason for the rules was that the Norwegian Airline Pilots Association did not want the records from the CVR to be used in criminal cases against pilots. The investigation board stated that they would forward any information which supported criminal violations, while Namdal <b>Police</b> <b>District</b> stated that it was necessary for an independent police investigation to identify any criminal violations. The Norwegian Data Inspectorate's director Georg Apenes supported the police in their request for the tapes.|$|E
5|$|Each <b>police</b> <b>district</b> {{is led by}} a {{chief of}} police and is {{subdivided}} into several police stations in towns and cities, and sheriffs' offices for rural areas. The Governor of Svalbard acts as chief of police for Svalbard. Norwegian police officers do not carry firearms, but keep their Heckler & Koch MP5 submachine guns and Heckler & Koch P30 pistols locked down in the patrol cars. The Norwegian Prosecuting Authority is partially integrated with the police.|$|E
5|$|On June 1, 2005, the Staten Island Rapid Transit Police Department was disbanded and the 25 Staten Island {{railroad}} Police Officers {{merged into}} {{the much larger}} Metropolitan Transportation Authority Police. The Metropolitan Transportation Authority Police department was created in 1998 when the Long Island Rail Road Police and the Metro-North Railroad Police Departments merged. In 2005 the MTA Police Department then opened their newest patrol district, <b>Police</b> <b>District</b> #9 which began covering the Staten Island Railway.|$|E

5|$|Another {{issue is}} using {{standardized}} technology for communication with agencies in other countries. Norway {{is a member}} of the Schengen Agreement, which requires trans-border communication between law enforcement agencies. There were 27 different networks for the police, one for each <b>police</b> <b>district.</b> In Oslo, Akershus and Østfold, the police had also been using Enhanced Digital Access Communication System since 1994. There were 230 municipal fire department radio systems, and a manual mobile phone system for the health sector. The health network was built by the county municipalities between 1990 and 1995 and covers all parts of the health service, including paramedics, ambulance services, midwives and medical doctors. The various systems had different levels of coverage. In addition, Global System for Mobile Communication (GSM) and Nordic Mobile Telephone (NMT450) telephones were being used where encrypted communication was necessary.|$|E

5|$|Deptford {{was mostly}} {{located in the}} Blackheath Hundred of the county of Kent, with the Hatcham part in Surrey. It was {{regarded}} as two parts and in 1730 was divided into the two parishes of St Nicholas {{in the north and}} St Paul in the south. The southern part by the ford was known as Deptford and the northern, riverside area was known as Deptford Strand. It was also referred to as West Greenwich, with the modern town of Greenwich being referred to as East Greenwich until this use declined in the 19th century. The whole of Deptford came within the Metropolitan <b>Police</b> <b>District</b> in 1830 and was included in the area of responsibility of the Metropolitan Board of Works in 1855.

Results showed that there are few organisational climate differences between the <b>police</b> <b>districts</b> and the NPUC. The organisational climate in Økokrim however differs considerably from the organisational climate in both the <b>police</b> <b>districts</b> and at the NPUC. These differences within the police organisation {{can be explained by}} a number of variables, accounted for in the discussion section. A brief comparison with the higher education sectors show that Økokrim s results are more similar to colleges and universities than to the <b>police</b> <b>districts</b> and the NPUC.

50|$|The {{number of}} <b>police</b> <b>districts</b> was nearly {{constant}} from 1894 to 2002, {{although a few}} have been creased and closed. However, the organization in the various <b>police</b> <b>districts</b> varied considerably, especially in the cities. In particular some cities had the civilian responsibilities undertaken by the municipality. Especially for the public this was confusing, and the police services received a homogenous organization during the 1980s, with the civil tasks being organized {{as part of the}} police stations. Økokrim was established in 1988 and in 1994 the administrative responsibilities for the sheriff's offices was transferred to <b>police</b> <b>districts.</b> The <b>police</b> school became a university college in 1993 and introduced a three-year education; in 1998 a second campus opened in Bodø. Police Reform 2000 was a major restructuring of the police force. First the National Police Directorate was created in 2001. From 2003 the number of <b>police</b> <b>districts</b> was reduced from 54 to 27. The Police Computing and Material Service and the Criminal Investigation Service were both established in 2004. Ten police officers have been killed in service since 1945.|$|R
5|$|Metropolitan Norway {{is divided}} into 27 police {{district}}s. Each district is further subdivided into local police stations and rural police districts, the latter led by a sheriff. Each <b>police</b> <b>district</b> is headquartered at a main police station and is led by a chief of police. Police districts hold a common pool of resources and personnel and have a common administration and budget. Each also has a joint operations center which also acts as an emergency call center for 112. Many of the larger districts have their own execution and enforcement authority, while this in integrated in the smaller districts. The size of the police districts varies, from Oslo with 2,500 employees and covering a population of 570,000 to Eastern Finnmark which has 160 employees and 30,000 residents.|$|E
5|$|Oslo <b>Police</b> <b>District</b> has {{a series}} of special {{divisions}} and task forces which provide aid to all other police districts when necessary.

This caused the police to use two years to gain court permission to access the evidence. The report found no technical problems with the aircraft. However, it found several pilot errors and laid a large responsibility on the airline for lack of proper organization and routines. No-one was charged after the accident, but lead to a major restructure of operations and procedures in Widerøe.|$|E
