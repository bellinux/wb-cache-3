5|$|The post-war boom in {{automobile}} {{travel and}} the construction of the Interstate Highway System, as well as competition from commercial airlines, led to the decline of <b>passenger</b> <b>rail.</b> The Pennsylvania Railroad eliminated passenger service between Erie and Pittsburgh in April1948. It eventually ended through service to Philadelphia, requiring passengers to transfer in Emporium, Pennsylvania, and discontinued service from Erie altogether on March27, 1965. By 1968, the number of New York Central trains was also reduced to five per day. The two railroads were merged on February1, 1968, and formed the Penn Central Transportation Company. Penn Central continued to run the former New York Central passenger trains, until the last departed Union Station on April30, 1971. The newly created National <b>Passenger</b> <b>Rail</b> Corporation, more commonly known as Amtrak, took over nationwide <b>passenger</b> <b>rail</b> operations the next day. Amtrak continued to operate a New York-to-Chicago train until January1972, the Lake Shore, which had a station stop in Erie starting in November1971. However, the poor condition of the track between Buffalo and Chicago, as well as the service's general lack of profitability, led to the Lake Shores demise. Erie remained devoid of any <b>passenger</b> <b>rail</b> service until Amtrak reintroduced the former New York Central train, the Lake Shore Limited, on November30, 1975.|$|E

5|$|Dawson Creek is a {{regional}} node for air, rail, and bus services. The Dawson Creek Airport, which services commercial flights by Central Mountain Air, {{was built in}} 1963; its 1,524m (5,000ft) runway was paved in 1966. There are larger airports in Fort St. John and Grande Prairie that maintain more comprehensive flight schedules. <b>Passenger</b> <b>rail</b> service was available in Dawson Creek between 1931 and 1974. Service began when the Northern Alberta Railways (NAR) built its northwest terminus in the town and was extended in 1958 to Vancouver with a rail line through the Rocky Mountains. <b>Passenger</b> <b>rail</b> service ended as commodity shipments of grains, oil and gas by-products, and forestry products became {{more important in the}} resource-based economy. Greyhound Lines maintains a bus station in Dawson Creek which connects the city to Vancouver, Edmonton (via Grande Prairie), and Whitehorse (via Fort Nelson).|$|E
5|$|In {{common with}} the rest of Tasmania, Whitemore no longer has <b>passenger</b> <b>rail</b> {{transport}}; the last Tasmanian <b>passenger</b> <b>rail</b> service stopped in 1978 and the service to Whitemore prior to that. Rail transport for Whitemore opened in the late 1870s. The first passenger train was on 27 April 1870 and the rail line opened for regular traffic in February 1871. This transport was from a siding rather than a station. The Whitemore siding did not have a full-time station master and was not a regular stop; passengers had to request the train stop or flag the train for a pickup. The town’s only regular transport services as of 2014 are Redline Coaches' private school-bus services.|$|E

5|$|While Union Station {{was busy}} from its opening and through World War II, <b>passenger</b> <b>rail</b> service began to dwindle {{after the war}} when air and highway travel became more popular. By the 1960s, the New York Central {{drastically}} cut service, while the Pennsylvania abandoned service to Erie altogether. Both railroads were merged in 1968 to form Penn Central, and <b>passenger</b> <b>rail</b> was transferred from Penn Central to Amtrak in 1971. At one point, from 1972 to 1975, even Amtrak service in Erie was suspended. With reduced demand for train travel, Union Station was neglected and allowed to decay until Logistics Plus bought it in 2003. Since then it has been restored, with portions re-purposed as commercial and retail space.|$|E

The BNSF Railway complex in Amarillo continues to serve a heavy daily traffic load, approximately 100–110 trains per day.

There have been various proposals over the years to add passenger service. One, the Caprock Chief, would have seen daily service as part of a Fort Worth, Texas—Denver, Colorado service, but it failed to gain traction.|$|E
