5|$|Of all {{the strains}} in the piece, the final D strain {{is perhaps the}} most interesting. It is written in B-flat minor. When Joplin used minor keys in the {{previous}} sections, he used the relative key of G minor (i.e., relative to the main key of B-flat major). However, in this fourth section, he instead used the <b>parallel</b> <b>key.</b> This strain also features sections where the right hand and left hand play notes in unison, and in which the standard 2/4 time left-hand beat is noticeably absent.|$|E

50|$|<b>Parallel</b> <b>keys</b> are {{the most}} widely used. They have a square or {{rectangular}} cross-section. Square keys are used for smaller shafts and rectangular faced keys are used for shaft diameters over 6.5 in or when the wall thickness of the mating hub is an issue. Set screws often accompany <b>parallel</b> <b>keys</b> to lock the mating parts into place. The keyway is a longitudinal slot in both the shaft and mating part.|$|R
50|$|In this opus {{there are}} four pairs of <b>parallel</b> <b>keys</b> (E, F, A and B, major/minor) and three pairs of {{relative}} keys (B major/G-sharp minor, C major/A minor, B flat minor/D flat Major).|$|R
5000|$|Largo e dolce (in A minor, {{ending with}} an {{imperfect}} cadence) - unusually this movement {{is written in}} the <b>parallel</b> <b>key,</b> rather than the relative key, to the home key.|$|E
5000|$|Schubert {{ended his}} Impromptus in E-flat major, D. 899 No. 2 in E-flat minor, <b>parallel</b> <b>key</b> to E-flat major, {{and so did}} Brahms in his Rhapsody in E-flat major, Op. 119 No. 4.|$|E
5000|$|Scherzo (Allegro molto) (in D {{major and}} in ternary form) - The {{movement}} in the <b>parallel</b> <b>key</b> (tonic major) features flying notes, and a waltz-like middle section mainly in B-flat major. The movement is cheerful throughout.|$|E
5000|$|In {{rock and}} popular music, {{examples}} of songs that emphasize <b>parallel</b> <b>keys</b> include Grass Roots' [...] "Temptation Eyes", [...] "Every Little Thing She Does Is Magic", Lipps Inc's [...] "Funkytown", The Beatles [...] "Norwegian Wood," [...] and Dusty Springfield's You Don't Have To Say You Love Me.|$|R
50|$|There is {{one pair}} of <b>parallel</b> <b>keys</b> (D minor/major) and two pairs of {{relative}} keys (E-flat major/C minor; and E‑flat minor/G-flat major), the remaining four preludes satisfying neither criterion. However, by choosing 11 different keys for his first 11 published preludes, {{he was at least}} keeping his options open.|$|R
5000|$|Dp {{stands for}} Dominant-{{parallel}}. The word [...] "parallel" [...] in German has {{the meaning of}} [...] "relative" [...] in English. G major and E minor are called <b>parallel</b> <b>keys.</b> The G major chord and the E minor chord in the key of C major are called parallel chords in the Riemann system.|$|R
50|$|It is {{composed}} as a da capo aria (bars 1-86) {{with a short}} middle section ("", bars 87-100) which has the tempo marking Allegretto {{and is in the}} <b>parallel</b> <b>key</b> of A minor. The aria consists almost wholly of two-bar phrases.|$|E
50|$|There is then a large {{variation}} on the first theme where the main tune is played with other notes in between. There is then a large section of arpeggios and finishing off on 6 final chords. Modulating to the <b>parallel</b> <b>key</b> of F major for an interrupted final cadence.|$|E
50|$|This key is F major, the {{subdominant}} of C major. After the exposition {{is heard}} twice, the music then modulates {{to the development}} in the <b>parallel</b> <b>key</b> of F minor, and its relative key (A-flat major). The movement then modulates to the tonic, for the recapitulation, followed by a short coda.|$|E
5000|$|Major {{and minor}} chords may each {{be found in}} both the major and minor scales, {{constructed}} on different degrees of each.

5000|$|Confusingly, {{the term}} for [...] "relative key" [...] in German is Paralleltonart, while <b>parallel</b> <b>key</b> is Varianttonart. Similar {{terminology}} is used in most Germanic and Slavic languages, but not Romance languages. This is in particular confusing with the term parallel chord, which denotes chords derived from the relative key in English usage.|$|E
5000|$|After {{the first}} theme of 'minor seconds' closes, Chopin {{introduces}} a Più Lento section {{in which a}} new melody (without dissonant minor seconds) is played in the <b>parallel</b> <b>key,</b> E major. The final section of the piece starts with a recapitulation of the first theme, with climaxes in a coda played in E Major.|$|E
5000|$|Theme C più lento (slower) — a sostenuto in the <b>parallel</b> <b>key</b> of C minor (D-flat major, enharmonic {{equivalent}} to C-sharp major). Besides the slower general pace, the melody is in quarter notes {{except for a}} few flourishes in eighth notes, giving this section the quality of an interlude before the dramatic restatement of Theme B ...|$|E
50|$|By 1910 Rachmaninoff had {{definitely}} {{decided to}} complete the set, publishing 13 preludes, Op. 32, covering the remaining 13 keys (C major, B-flat minor, E major, E minor, G major, F minor, F major, A minor, A major, B minor, B major, G-sharp minor, D-flat major). In this opus there are four pairs of <b>parallel</b> <b>keys</b> (E, F, A, and B, major/minor) and one relative pair (B major and G-sharp minor).|$|R
5000|$|Brahms's ballades are {{arranged}} in two pairs of two, the members of each pair being in <b>parallel</b> <b>keys.</b> The first ballade {{was inspired by a}} Scottish poem [...] "Edward" [...] found in a collection Stimmen der Völker in ihren Liedern compiled by Johann Gottfried Herder. It {{is also one of the}} best examples of Brahms's bardic or Ossianic style; its open fifths, octaves, and simple triadic harmonies are supposed to evoke the sense of a mythological past.|$|R
5000|$|Each Prelude is {{followed}} by a Fugue in the same key. In each book the first Prelude and Fugue is in C major, followed by a Prelude and Fugue in its <b>parallel</b> minor <b>key</b> (C minor). Then all keys, each major key followed by its <b>parallel</b> minor <b>key,</b> are followed through, each time moving up a half tone: C → C → D → E → E → F → F → ... ending with ... → B → B.|$|R
50|$|The Allegro is in sonata form, {{opening with}} a G major theme, {{played by the}} orchestra. The main theme is a bright and happy {{discussion}} between the solo violin and the accompaniment, followed by a modulation to the dominant D major, then its <b>parallel</b> <b>key</b> D minor. It experiments in other keys but does not settle and eventually heads back to the tonic, G major, in the recapitulation.|$|E
5000|$|A {{borrowed}} chord (also called mode {{mixture and}} modal interchange) is a chord {{borrowed from the}} <b>parallel</b> <b>key</b> (minor or major scale with the same tonic). Borrowed chords are typically used as [...] "color chords", providing harmonic variety through contrasting scale forms, which are major scales and the three forms of minor scales. Similarly, chords may be borrowed from the parallel modes, the various modes beginning on the same tonic as a scale, for example Dorian with D major.|$|E
50|$|A <b>parallel</b> <b>key</b> {{modulation}} is {{a change}} of mode, but maintains the same tonal center. For example, one section of a composition {{may be in the}} key of E major and then modulate to E minor. This can be done directly or facilitated by the various modulation techniques described above. Depending on the length of the modulation and whether or not it returns to the original key, {{it may or may not}} be designated by a change of key signature.|$|E

5000|$|In music, {{an altered}} chord, {{an example of}} alteration, is a chord {{with one or more}} notes from the {{diatonic}} scale replaced by a neighboring pitch in the chromatic scale. Thus the note must be a chord tone. According to the broadest definition any chord with a nondiatonic chord tone is an altered chord, while the simplest use of altered chords is the use of [...] "borrowed" [...] chords—borrowed from the <b>parallel</b> <b>key</b> and the most common is the use of secondary dominants.|$|E
50|$|A tapered lock {{is a form}} of keyless {{shaft locking}} device that does not require any {{material}} to be removed from the shaft. The basic idea is similar to a clamp coupling but the moment of rotation is closer {{to the center of the}} shaft. An alternative coupling device to the traditional <b>parallel</b> <b>key,</b> the tapered lock removes the possibility of play due to worn keyways. It is more robust than using a key because maintenance only requires one tool and the self-centering balanced rotation means it lasts longer than a keyed joint would, but the downside is that it costs more.|$|E
5000|$|It {{opens in}} sonata form, softly in the strings, {{followed}} by a theme shared by the solo oboe and clarinet. A typically laconic Schubertian transition consists of just four measures for the two horns, effectively modulating to the subdominant <b>parallel</b> <b>key</b> of G major (measures 38-41). The second subject begins with a celebrated lyrical melody in that key, stated first by the celli {{and then by the}} violins (sometimes drolly sung to Sigmund Spaeths words as [...] "This is ... the sym-phoneee ... that Schubert wrote but never fin-ished") to a gentle syncopated accompaniment. This is interrupted by a dramatic closing group alternating heavy tutti sforzandi interspersed with pauses and developmental variants of the G major melody, ending the exposition.|$|E
40|$|Interference fits {{are widely}} {{employed}} to semi-permanently connect gears, pulleys, flanges, wheels, disks, rotors, and similar mechanical components, to a shaft. The stress state along the hub central portion may be thoroughly predicted by modelling the press-fit problem as plane and by employing the Lamé equations for thick-walled cylinders, and the transmissible torque may be confidently estimated {{by relying on}} the Lamé predictions, since they are valid along most of the contact axial length. 	Often a key {{is added to the}} press-fit, to secure the torque transmission and to prevent any relative rotation between the shaft and the hub. Both <b>parallel</b> and tapered <b>keys</b> are employed in practical applications. With respect to their tapered counterparts, <b>parallel</b> <b>keys</b> possess the advantage that they do not cause any eccentricity. This study considers <b>parallel</b> <b>keys</b> only. The presence of the keyseat increases the compliance of the hub and the shaft, thus producing a diminution of the contact pressure between the hub and the shaft, which results in a similar diminution of the transmissible torque. In this paper, a preliminary Finite Element analysis is carried out to quantify the above diminution of the contact pressure in the assumption of frictionless contact. The analysis is carried out for a solid shaft and for a practically relevant selection of ratios between the hub inner and outer radii. 	A preliminary development is presented of an analytical approach based upon the classical Michell polar solution, which is particularly suitable to mimic rings. 	The diminution of the transmissible torque with respect to a keyless shaft-hub press-fit is quantified, and the results are presented in a design diagram...|$|R
