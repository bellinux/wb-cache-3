5|$|A {{direct method}} for {{producing}} an MSA uses the dynamic programming technique {{to identify the}} globally optimal alignment solution. For proteins, this method usually involves two sets of parameters: a gap penalty and a substitution matrix assigning scores or probabilities to the alignment of each <b>possible</b> <b>pair</b> of amino acids based on the similarity of the amino acids' chemical properties and the evolutionary probability of the mutation. For nucleotide sequences a similar gap penalty is used, but a much simpler substitution matrix, wherein only identical matches and mismatches are considered, is typical. The scores in the substitution matrix may be either all positive or a mix {{of positive and negative}} {{in the case of a}} global alignment, but must be both positive and negative, in the case of a local alignment.|$|E

25|$|During the {{conversion}} from straight-chain {{form to the}} cyclic form, the carbon atom containing the carbonyl oxygen, called the anomeric carbon, becomes a stereogenic center with two possible configurations: The oxygen atom may take a position either above or below {{the plane of the}} ring. The resulting <b>possible</b> <b>pair</b> of stereoisomers is called anomers. In the α anomer, the -OH substituent on the anomeric carbon rests on the opposite side (trans) of the ring from the CH2OH side branch. The alternative form, in which the CH2OH substituent and the anomeric hydroxyl are on the same side (cis) of the plane of the ring, is called the β anomer.|$|E

25|$|A graph {{property}} {{is the question}} of whether a graph belongs to a given family of graphs; the answer must remain invariant under any relabeling of the vertices. In this context, the question to be determined is how many pairs of vertices must be tested for adjacency, in the worst case, before the property of interest can be determined to be true or false for a given implicit graph. Rivest and Vuillemin proved that any deterministic algorithm for any nontrivial graph property must test a quadratic number of pairs of vertices. The full Aanderaa–Karp–Rosenberg conjecture is that any deterministic algorithm for a monotonic graph property (one that remains true if more edges are added to a graph with the property) must in some cases test every <b>possible</b> <b>pair</b> of vertices. Several cases of the conjecture have been proven to be true—for instance, it is known to be true for graphs with a prime number of vertices—but the full conjecture remains open. Variants of the problem for randomized algorithms and quantum algorithms have also been studied.|$|E

40|$|A graph Γ {{is said to}} be {{symmetric}} if its automorphism group (Γ) is transitive on the arc set of Γ. Let G be {{a finite}} non-abelian simple group and let Γ be a connected pentavalent symmetric graph such that G≤(Γ). In this paper, we show that if G is transitive on the vertex set of Γ, then either G(Γ) or (Γ) contains a non-abelian simple normal subgroup T such that G≤ T and (G,T) is one of 58 <b>possible</b> <b>pairs</b> of non-abelian simple groups. In particular, if G is arc-transitive, then (G,T) is one of 17 <b>possible</b> <b>pairs,</b> and if G is regular on the vertex set of Γ, then (G,T) is one of 13 <b>possible</b> <b>pairs,</b> which improves the result on pentavalent symmetric Cayley graph given by Fang, Ma and Wang in 2011.

He had a gold watch, and a gold curb chain with large gold seals; and he carried a pliant ebony cane with a gold top. His linen was of the very whitest, finest, and stiffest; his wig of the glossiest, blackest, and curliest. His snuff was princes' mixture; his scent BOUQUET DU ROI. His features were contracted into a perpetual smile; and his teeth were in such perfect order that it was difficult at a small distance to tell the real from the false.|$|E

50|$|Maxdiff and best-worst scaling (BWS) have erroneously been {{considered}} synonyms. Respondents can produce best-worst data {{in any of}} a number of ways, with a maxdiff process being but one. Instead of evaluating all <b>possible</b> <b>pairs</b> (the maxdiff model), they might choose the best from n items, the worst from the remaining n-1, or vice versa (sequential models). Or indeed they may use another method entirely. Thus it should be clear that maxdiff is a subset of BWS; maxdiff is BWS, but BWS is not necessarily maxdiff. Indeed, maxdiff might not be considered an attractive model on psychological and intuitive grounds: as the number of items increases, the number of <b>possible</b> <b>pairs</b> increases in a multiplicative fashion: n items produces n(n-1) pairs (where best-worst order matters). Assuming respondents do evaluate all <b>possible</b> <b>pairs</b> is a strong assumption. Early work did use the term maxdiff to refer to BWS, but with Marley's return to the field, correct academic terminology has been disseminated throughout Europe and Asia-Pacific.|$|R
