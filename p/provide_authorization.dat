5000|$|Message {{submission}} (...) and SMTP-AUTH (...) {{were introduced}} in 1998 and 1999, both describing new trends in email delivery. Originally, SMTP servers were typically internal to an organization, receiving mail for the organization from the outside, and relaying messages from the organization to the outside. But as time went on, SMTP servers (mail transfer agents), in practice, were expanding their roles to become message submission agents for Mail user agents, {{some of which were}} now relaying mail from the outside of an organization. (e.g. a company executive wishes to send email while on a trip using the corporate SMTP server.) This issue, a consequence of the rapid expansion and popularity of the World Wide Web, meant that SMTP had to include specific rules and methods for relaying mail and authenticating users to prevent abuses such as relaying of unsolicited email (spam). Work on message submission (...) was originally started because popular mail servers would often rewrite mail in an attempt to fix problems in it, for example, adding a domain name to an unqualified address. This behavior is helpful when the message being fixed is an initial submission, but dangerous and harmful when the message originated elsewhere and is being relayed. Cleanly separating mail into submission and relay was seen as a way to permit and encourage rewriting submissions while prohibiting rewriting relay. As spam became more prevalent, it was also seen as a way to <b>provide</b> <b>authorization</b> for mail being sent out from an organization, as well as traceability. This separation of relay and submission quickly became a foundation for modern email security practices.|$|E

We used pseudonym techniques to achieve the identity privacy of the vehicles and their requested services.

We adopted ABE to guarantee rigorous access control based on the purchased access structure. We used hash chain technique to <b>provide</b> <b>authorization</b> property through electronic voucher which a vehicle has to possess before enjoying any giving service. Security analysis and experimental results based on transmission overhead, average delay, and average loss ratio are provided.
