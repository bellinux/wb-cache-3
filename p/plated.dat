40|$|AbstractSlip {{mechanism}} and <b>plate</b> theory were utilized {{to the investigation}} of computing formulas of five <b>plate</b> numbers. Column <b>plate</b> number and peak <b>plate</b> number were two different concepts. Peak <b>plate</b> number was a new concept which came from slip mechanism. A good relation existed between the peak <b>plate</b> number and the asymmetry of practical peak of chromatogram. Peak <b>plate</b> number could be regarded as an asymmetry index of chromatogram peak, as column <b>plate</b> number is regarded as an efficiency index of column. The <b>plate</b> in slip mechanism was mobile, which {{was different from the}} fixed <b>plate</b> in <b>plate</b> theory. The five <b>plate</b> numbers were four kinds of column <b>plate</b> numbers and one kind of peak <b>plate</b> number (q’); the four column <b>plate</b> numbers were theoretical <b>plate</b> number (n 0), real <b>plate</b> number (n), plate-model <b>plate</b> number (q 0) and slip-mechanism <b>plate</b> number (q) ...|$|R

Usually no {{more than half of}} eligible videos have a pre-roll advertisement, {{due to a lack of}} interested advertisers. In 2013, YouTube introduced an option for channels with at least a thousand subscribers to require a paid subscription in order for viewers to watch videos.

5|$|Construction was {{slowed by}} {{industrial}} action after the war, and was suspended on 21October 1919 as Chile wanted to repurchase {{the ship and}} have it re-converted to a battleship. The £2.5 million cost of doing so would have been higher than the £1.5 million offered by the Chileans and the Admiralty decided to retain the ship.

Armstrong Whitworth <b>plated</b> over the openings for the undelivered elevators on the flight deck (which had been cancelled when they could not meet the specifications), finished the rear funnel, removed the torpedo tubes, and <b>plated</b> over the forward funnel uptakes before she sailed to the Royal dockyard at Portsmouth for the modifications necessary for the trials on 20April 1920.
