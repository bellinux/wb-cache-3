40|$|AbstractA {{numerical}} {{method to}} evaluate the lateral buckling load of non-prismatic thin-walled straight beams with nonsymmetric cross-section is proposed. For this purpose, the potential energy considering the effects of initial stresses, the elastic strain energy, {{and the work of}} external forces for non-prismatic thin-walled beam with non-symmetric cross-section are derived. Then equilibrium equations and boundary conditions are obtained from the total potential energy. Power series approximation is used to solve the fourth –order differential equations of non-prismatic thinwalled beam with variable geometric parameters and with generalized end conditions. Based on power series expansions of displacement components explicit expressions for displacement parameters are derived. And also, it is assumed that the functions which describe the beam's variable parameters such as: flexural rigidity and loads can be expanded in to power series form. Finally, the lateral buckling loads are determined by solving eigenvalue problem. Several numerical examples of non-prismatic thin-walled beams have been presented to verify the accuracy and validity of this method, and the obtained results are compared with the finite element solutions using Ansys software and other available numerical or analytical approaches. The method can be applied for the elastic critical buckling load of <b>prismatic</b> <b>members</b> as well as non <b>prismatic</b> <b>members...</b>|$|R

40|$|Metal {{building}} {{frames are}} typically designed using welded prismatic and web-tapered members with doubly-symmetric and/or singly-symmetric cross sections. Until recently, the base U. S. provisions for design of frames with web-tapered members were {{provided in the}} AISC ASD (1989) and LRFD (1999) Specifications. Unfortunately, these previous AISC provisions address only a small range of practical designs. As a result, metal building manufacturers have tended {{to develop their own}} methods for design of the wide range of nonprismatic member geometries and configurations encountered in practice. This research develops new design procedures for design of frames using general prismatic members and web-tapered members. An equivalent <b>prismatic</b> <b>member</b> concept utilized in prior research and the prior AISC provisions is generalized to accommodate the broad range of member types and configurations commonly used in metal building industry. Furthermore, the new design procedures incorporate many of the improvements achieved in the AISC (2005 & 2010) Specifications to metal building frame design. These improvements include a new stability design method, the direct analysis method, more complete considerations of different column buckling limit states (flexural, torsional and flexural-torsional buckling), and improved axial load and flexural resistance provisions. This research develops practical design-based procedures for simplified calculation of the elastic buckling resistances of prismatic and web-tapered members to facilitate the application of the proposed design methods. In addition, this research performs a relatively comprehensive assessment of beam lateral torsional buckling (LTB) behavior and strength of prismatic and web-tapered members using refined virtual test simulation. It is demonstrated that web-tapered members behave in a comparable fashion to prismatic members. Based on the virtual simulation study, recommendations for potential improvement of the AISC LTB resistance equations are provided. Lastly, the strength behavior of several representative metal building frames is studied in detail using the same virtual test simulation capabilities developed and applied for the assessment of the beam LTB resistances.

Material savings, cost effectiveness, weight reduction, Strength {{and aesthetics}} of steel structures {{are some of}} the key factors to be considered in structural design. In the last decade, non-prismatic steel members have proved to be more effective in structural design than the <b>prismatic</b> <b>members,</b> i. e. they have higher load carrying capacity when their geometry closely resemble the bending moment envelope as compared to <b>prismatic</b> <b>members</b> with the same material properties, loading and boundary conditions. However, there is a unique point (degree of non-uniformity) for which every non-prismatic member loses its load carrying capacity due to a change in its failure position and mechanism. Therefore, in order to investigate the effect of geometrical non-uniformity on steel members, non-prismatic steel members with different steel sections were simulated using ADINA/M 8. 4. 2 version whose function is based on finite element method. Furthermore, the non-prismatic steel members were modeled under different geometrical arrangements, degree of non-uniformity, boundary and loading conditions. Deflections, stress distributions, torsional effect and critical buckling load were recorded. The numerical results obtained in this study combine effectively an optimized check for different geometrical arrangements and degree of non-uniformity leading to a relatively improved economic and safe design...|$|R

40|$|For {{the weight}} {{efficient}} and crashworthy {{design of the}} structural body of a transportation system, {{a thorough understanding of}} crushing behavior of thin-walled structural members such as spot-welded sheet metal beams or extruded aluminum beams must be gained. In the present thesis, the complex crushing process of three-dimensional thin-walled structures subject to combined loading is solved analytically and numerically. Also, several new design concepts of strengthening "S" shaped frame with regard to weight efficiency and energy absorption are proposed. The mechanics of biaxial bending collapse and the collapse under combined bending and compression of thin-walled <b>prismatic</b> <b>member</b> are formulated and initial and subsequent shrinking interaction curves between the loading components are constructed. All the analytical derivations show close correlations with the results of the accompanying finite element analysis. Based on these two complex crushing mechanisms, the analytical derivation of the crushing resistance of three-dimensional "S" shaped frame is presented. Extensive study on the strengthening of the three-dimensional "S" shaped frame is performed with two types of internal reinforcing member, diagonally positioned sheet metal stiffener and ultralight metallic foam-filler. The optimization process involving varying the cross-sectional shape and the type of reinforcing member for both aluminum-extruded member and spot-welded hat-type cross-section member is developed. (cont.) Using the analytical closed form expression of the crushing force of "S" shaped frame, the optimization process was performed based on Sequential Quadratic Programming. As a more realistic application, a front side rail and subframe structure of a mid size passenger car is analyzed. The combinational optimization process of "Design of Experiment" and "Response Surface Method" is carried out with the objective of weight minimization while maintaining the same or higher level of crash energy absorption. Both methods of internal reinforcement show high increase in the energy absorption and weight efficiency. The gain in terms of the specific energy absorption varies from 37 % to 267 % depending on the method. The proposed theoretical understanding and the design methodologies could be used as crash oriented early-stage component design tools. by Heung-Soo Kim. Thesis (Ph. D.)

The stability matrices are formulated by minimizing the potential energies with respect to displacements. Axial and shear buckling loads are determined by solving eigenvalue problems.

Results from the analytical model were compared to load-deflection behaviour of a number of beams with different geometric and material properties from other researchers.

A detailed account of tests on 15 <b>prismatic</b> <b>members</b> using conventional concrete as well as rubberised concrete, with relatively high replacement ratios of both fine and coarse mineral aggregates with rubber particles, is given. The results enable direct assessment of strength and complete deformation characteristics including the post-peak response for ultimate behaviour governed both by shear and mixed-mode tensile-shear. After describing the material properties, mix designs and member details, the main observations from detailed measurements of the crack kinematics through a digital image correlation monitoring system, with focus on members developing shear-governed response, are reported. Complementary numerical studies are undertaken using nonlinear finite element procedures which are validated against tests developing shear-governed failures. In order to provide further insight into the key response characteristics, particularly those related to ultimate strength, a number of numerical sensitivity studies employing various constitutive parameters are also carried out. Moreover, comparative assessments in terms of shear resistance, toughness and force transfer across the cracked interfaces are performed and discussed.

The method is illustrated by the computer program described. The structures are restricted to those of an orthogonal nature with rigid, interconnected elements. The method of solution is a stiffness matrix approach utilising a finite element formulation for the in-plane and out-of-plane action of the floor deck. A process of condensation is applied to the stiffness matrices to reorganise and reduce storage demands. A 'part-structure' condensation is employed floor by floor, making the process highly suitable for multi-storey structures. Several examples are given to illustrate the use of the program and to demonstrate its versatility. Also the wide range of results obtainable and the methods of presentation are given. The program is used together with one for a plane frame analysis and one for a rigid, orthogonal, skeletal space frame analysis, both of which are described in this volume, in order to investigate and compare the solutions obtained for the test frames described. Some results are presented for the investigation into the stiffening effect of the floor slabs on the bare frame.

Detailed accounts of the full-scale testing on the 24 metre span frame and the experimental results are given. Supplementary tests on beams cut out from the tested frame in order to establish the strain-hardening factor are also presented. A literature survey on the published material pertinent to the lateral torsional-buckling of a tapered member was undertaken. Different methods of treatment for the elastic stability of tapered members and any evidence from previous research in this area were reviewed. Details of an appropriate finite element and the corresponding computer programme are given. This section describes the assumptions and the Finite Element formulations adopted in the computer programme.

40|$|The use of {{prestressed}} U-Beams, {{developed as}} an economical and aesthetic alternative to traditional I-beams, {{is becoming increasingly}} common. While U-Beams are seeing increased use, questions have arisen {{in the design of}} bridges utilizing this girder type. Specific issues include live load distribution, bridge deck behavior, and debonding limits. First, since the U-Beam is a new girder type, limited guidance exists for the live load distributions to be used in design. Second, due to the increased stiffness and strength of this girder, fewer girder lines are required resulting in increased deck spans. Finally, current AASHTO debonding limits severely restrict the efficiency of the section. While it is important to evaluate these limits, questions have also arisen regarding the effectiveness of commercially available debonding products as many precasters have experienced problems with these materials. Determining the effectiveness of debonding is essential before determining the appropriateness of the AASHTO debonding limits and will be a focus of this study. Based on these research needs, the objective of this research study is to investigate the live load distribution and flexural deck behavior of a U-Beam bridge and to assess the effectiveness of common debond sheathing products. Two phases of research were conducted. The first phase consisted of evaluation of a U-Beam bridge constructed in Indianapolis, Indiana to assess the live load distribution factors and flexural deck behavior of this bridge. This investigation was performed by instrumenting the bridge with strain gages and placing loaded dump trucks in different loading configurations on the bridge deck. Comparison of the measured live load distribution factors and flexural deck behavior with those calculated according the AASHTO provisions are provided. The second phase consisted of evaluation of several commercially available debond sheathing products. This investigation was performed by constructing a series of 27 concentrically prestressed, <b>prismatic</b> <b>members.</b> Strains were measured along the face of the specimens both before and after prestress transfer. Additionally, strains were measured at 14 and 28 days after transfer to detect any possible time dependant effects. The resulting strain distributions along the length of each specimen also allowed for the determination of transfer lengths for each specimen. Comparison of the effectiveness of the various debond sheathing products is provided. Recommendations are made about the live load distribution factors used in design and selection of debond sheathing used during construction. ...|$|R

Therefore, for 1 / 2 <=(h(max) -h(min)) /h(max) < 1 the Frobenius' series solution cannot be used to establish the characteristic equation for the cantilever beam-columns; the problem is then solved numerically by means of a collocation procedure. Some of the analytical solutions (buckling loads) were compared with the results of shell finite-element analyses and an excellent agreement was found in all cases, thus validating the mathematical model and confirming the correctness of the analytical results.
