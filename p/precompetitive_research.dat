40|$|The limited {{efficiency}} of current air traffic systems {{will require a}} next-generation of Smart Air Traffic System (SATS) that relies on current technological advances. This challenge means a transition toward a new navigation and air-traffic procedures paradigm, where pilots and air traffic controllers perform and coordinate their activities according to new roles and technological supports. The design of new Human-Computer Interactions (HCI) for performing these activities {{is a key element}} of SATS. However efforts for developing such tools need to be inspired on a parallel characterization of hypothetical air traffic scenarios compatible with current ones. This paper is focused on airborne HCI into SATS where cockpit inputs came from aircraft navigation systems, surrounding traffic situation, controllers' indications, etc. So the HCI is intended to enhance situation awareness and decision-making through pilot cockpit. This work approach considers SATS as a system distributed on a large-scale with uncertainty in a dynamic environment. Therefore, a multi-agent systems based approach is well suited for modeling such an environment. We demonstrate that current methodologies for designing multi-agent systems are a useful tool to characterize HCI. We specifically illustrate how the selected methodological approach provides enough guidelines to obtain a cockpit HCI design that complies with future SATS specifications.

40|$|This is {{the author}} {{accepted}} manuscript. The final version is available from Elsevier via the DOI in this record. OBJECTIVE: Protein supplementation increases gains in lean body mass following prolonged resistance-type exercise training in frail older adults. We assessed whether the greater increase in lean body mass {{can be attributed to}} muscle fiber type specific hypertrophy with concomitant changes in satellite cell (SC) content. DESIGN: A total of 34 frail elderly individuals (77  ±  1  years, n =  12 male adults) participated in this randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial with 2 arms in parallel. INTERVENTION: Participants performed 24  weeks of progressive resistance-type exercise training (2 sessions per week) during which they were supplemented twice-daily with milk protein (2  ×  15  g) or a placebo. METHODS: Muscle biopsies were taken at baseline, and after 12 and 24  weeks of intervention, to determine type I and type II muscle fiber specific cross-sectional area (CSA), SC content, and myocellular characteristics. RESULTS: In the placebo group, a trend for a 20 % ±  11 % increase in muscle fiber CSA was observed in type II fibers only (P = . 051), with no increase in type I muscle fiber CSA. In the protein group, type I and II muscle fiber CSA increased by 23 % ±  7 % and 34 % ±  10 % following 6  months of training, respectively (P   . 05). No changes in myonuclear content and SC contents were observed over time in either group (both P > . 05). Regression analysis showed that changes in myonuclear content and domain size are predictive of muscle fiber hypertrophy. CONCLUSIONS: Protein supplementation augments muscle fiber hypertrophy following prolonged resistance-type exercise training in frail older people, without changes in myonuclear and SC content.

40|$|This is {{the author}} {{accepted}} manuscript. The final version {{is available from the}} publisher via the DOI in this record. Disuse leads to rapid loss of skeletal muscle mass and function. It has been hypothesized that short successive periods of muscle disuse throughout the lifespan {{play an important role in}} the development of sarcopenia. The physiological mechanisms underlying short-term muscle disuse atrophy remain to be elucidated. We assessed the impact of 5 days of muscle disuse on postabsorptive and postprandial myofibrillar protein synthesis rates in humans. Twelve healthy young (22 ± 1 yr) men underwent a 5 -day period of one-legged knee immobilization (full leg cast). Quadriceps cross-sectional area (CSA) of both legs was assessed before and after immobilization. Continuous infusions of l-[ring-(2) H 5]phenylalanine and l-[1 -(13) C]leucine were combined with the ingestion of a 25 -g bolus of intrinsically l-[1 -(13) C]phenylalanine- and l-[1 -(13) C]leucine-labeled dietary protein to assess myofibrillar muscle protein fractional synthetic rates in the immobilized and nonimmobilized control leg. Immobilization led to a 3. 9 ± 0. 6 % decrease in quadriceps muscle CSA of the immobilized leg. Based on the l-[ring-(2) H 5]phenylalanine tracer, immobilization reduced postabsorptive myofibrillar protein synthesis rates by 41 ± 13 % (0. 015 ± 0. 002 vs. 0. 032 ± 0. 005 %/h, P < 0. 01) and postprandial myofibrillar protein synthesis rates by 53 ± 4 % (0. 020 ± 0. 002 vs. 0. 044 ± 0. 003 %/h, P < 0. 01). Comparable results were found using the l-[1 -(13) C]leucine tracer. Following protein ingestion, myofibrillar protein bound l-[1 -(13) C]phenylalanine enrichments were 53 ± 18 % lower in the immobilized compared with the control leg (0. 007 ± 0. 002 and 0. 015 ± 0. 002 mole% excess, respectively, P < 0. 05). We conclude that 5 days of muscle disuse substantially lowers postabsorptive myofibrillar protein synthesis rates and induces anabolic resistance to protein ingestion.

40|$|The {{bioprinting}} technology {{allows the}} creation of three-dimensional (3 D) tissues in an additive manufacturing process with spatial control of cells, bioactive materials and molecules and therefore reflects the inherent complexity of native tissues to a high degree. As applied university we focus on industry-driven projects. We are developing bioprinting solutions {{in the fields of}} the cosmetic and pharma industry. The current bioprinting solution offers the following specifications: i) inkjet- and extruder-based printheads with temperature control for cell jetting and contact printing into well plates, ii) different cell-compatible printable matrices (bioinks), iii) a photopolymerization unit to crosslink bioinks at 365 nm and iv) a cell mixer to avoid cell sedimentation in the print cartridge while printing. For tissue generation alternating layers of bioink and cells are printed to produce a multi-layered 3 D tissue construct. In our aging population there is a huge demand for treatments of muscle-tendon related diseases. In an industry research project we are developing an all-in-one solution to produce and analyse printed in vitro muscle-tendon tissues in a customized well plate. Two posts in each well of the well plate will serve as anchor points to build muscle/tendon tissues. First, monocultures of primary human myoblasts and primary rat tenocytes were printed separately in a dumbbell-shape around the posts. After cell differentiation the myoblasts were stained positive for myosin heavy chain (MHC) and myotubes developed and for tendon the characteristic collagen I-distribution around the cell nuclei was detected. The printed muscle tissue is contracting on electrical stimulation and shows physiological functionality. The integration of electrodes in the well plates will allow electrical stimulation and subsequent read-out in the well plate. Nephrotoxicity is a major cause for effective drugs not being marketed. In a <b>precompetitive</b> <b>research</b> project we are reproducing parts of the nephron the so called proximal tubulus. In preliminary experiments we printed the proximal tubule of the kidney seeded with proximal tubule epithelial cells to cultivate them under physiological flow conditions.

40|$|The {{need for}} a Combustion and Melting Research Facility focused on the {{solution}} of glass manufacturing problems common to all segments of the glass industry was given high priority in the earliest version of the Glass Industry Technology Roadmap (Eisenhauer et al., 1997). Visteon Glass Systems and, later, PPG Industries proposed to meet this requirement, {{in partnership with the}} DOE/OIT Glass Program and Sandia National Laboratories, by designing and building a research furnace equipped with state-of-the-art diagnostics in the DOE Combustion Research Facility located at the Sandia site in Livermore, CA. Input on the configuration and objectives of the facility was sought from the entire industry by a variety of routes: (1) through a survey distributed to industry leaders by GMIC, (2) by conducting an open workshop following the OIT Glass Industry Project Review in September 1999, (3) from discussions with numerous glass engineers, scientists, and executives, and (4) during visits to glass manufacturing plants and research centers. The recommendations from industry were that the melting tank be made large enough to reproduce the essential processes and features of industrial furnaces yet flexible enough to be operated in as many as possible of the configurations found in industry as well as in ways never before attempted in practice. Realization of these objectives, while still providing access to the glass bath and combustion space for optical diagnostics and measurements using conventional probes, was the principal challenge {{in the development of the}} tank furnace design. The present report describes a facility having the requirements identified as important by members of the glass industry and equipped to do the work that the industry recommended should be the focus of research. The intent is that the laboratory would be available to U. S. glass manufacturers for collaboration with Sandia scientists and engineers on both <b>precompetitive</b> basic <b>research</b> and the solution of proprietary glass production problems. As a consequence of the substantial increase in scale and scope of the initial furnace concept in response to industry recommendations, constraints on funding of industrial programs by DOE, and reorientation of the Department's priorities, the OIT Glass Program is unable to provide the support for construction of such a facility. However, it is the present investigators' hope that a group of industry partners will emerge to carry the project forward, taking advantage of the detailed furnace design presented in this report. The engineering, including complete construction drawings, bill of materials, and equipment specifications, is complete. The project is ready to begin construction as soon as the quotations are updated. The design of the research melter closely follows the most advanced industrial practice, firing by natural gas with oxygen. The melting area is 13 ft x 6 ft, with a glass depth of 3 ft and an average height in the combustion space of 3 ft. The maximum pull rate is 25 tons/day, ranging from 100 % batch to 100 % cullet, continuously fed, with variable batch composition, particle size distribution, and raft configuration. The tank is equipped with bubblers to control glass circulation. The furnace can be fired in three modes: (1) using a single large burner mounted on the front wall, (2) by six burners in a staggered/opposed arrangement, three in each breast wall, and (3) by down-fired burners mounted in the crown in any combination with the front wall or breast-wall-mounted burners. Horizontal slots are provided between the tank blocks and tuck stones and between the breast wall and skewback blocks, running the entire length of the furnace on both sides, to permit access to the combustion space and the surface of the glass for optical measurements and sampling probes. Vertical slots in the breast walls provide additional access for measurements and sampling. The furnace and tank are to be fully instrumented with standard measuring equipment, such as flow meters, thermocouples, continuous gas composition analyzers, optical pyrometers, and a video camera. The output from the instruments is to be continuously recorded and simultaneously made available to other researchers via the Internet. A unique aspect of the research facility would be its access to the expertise in optical measurements in flames and high temperature reacting flows residing in the Sandia Combustion Research Facility. Development of new techniques for monitoring and control of glass melting would be a major focus of the work. The lab would be equipped with conventional and laser light sources and detectors for optical measurements of gas temperature, velocity, and gaseous species and, using new techniques to be developed in the Research Facility itself, glass temperature and glass composition...|$|R
40|$|Motivation Traditionally, {{conflicts}} {{between public and}} corporate collaborators concern aspects of confidentiality, publishing, intellectual property rights (IPRs) and ownership 1. Public-private partnerships (PPPs) are knowledge-based relationships; hence the management of intellectual property (IP) is of critical importance. The initial knowledge of each partner brought in the partnership, i. e. the background IP, is a crucial starting point for collaboration. Further, {{the management of the}} knowledge created by the partnership throughout the project, i. e. foreground IP, depends on many practical decisions, such as whether or not an idea is protected, where the IP protection is pursued, how exclusive rights are deployed, by whom and for which purpose 2. The different expectations of and approach to IP by the various stakeholders must be taken into account. The need is high for stakeholders to work together, get rid of unrealistic, outmoded and conflicting expectations of IP from multiple stakeholders 1; 3. There is a lot of uncertainty about the approach towards IP management. The optimal model for promoting innovation with respect IPRs of the collaborators has not been defined yet 3. In-depth insights in the impact of various IPRs rules applied in PPPs, is urgently needed. The aim {{of this study is to}} investigate to what extent IPR rules vary across (precompetitive) PPPs. This study will serve to further explore the impact of the variation of various IPR rules in order to develop best practices for further optimizing collaborative efforts and to engage stakeholders in sharing objectives and develop common approaches to address the aspects of IP 3; 4. Research questions 1) To which extent do IPR rules vary across precompetitive PPPs? 2) What is the impact of the variation of IPR rules across <b>precompetitive</b> PPPs? <b>Research</b> methodology Comparative analysis of IPRs documents (IP policies, IP guidelines, IP principles and Grant Agreements/Project Agreements templates) related to precompetitive PPPs. Abstract The pharmaceutical sector faces major challenges in the discovery and development of new drugs and therapies. New approaches and insights with respect to novel or existing compounds are hardly needed. Based on the principle that knowledge development is enhanced through sharing of ideas and resources, R&D projects at the precompetitive level are increasingly conducted in public-private partnerships (PPPs). Such precompetitive PPPs are presented through multifaceted partnering models and reflect heterogeneity of partners with different, often conflicting objectives and cultures. It is not surprising that intellectual property rights (IPRs), so crucial in pharmaceutical R&D, play a pivotal role in safeguarding partner’s interests, and that IPRs and trust issues take a crucial part of the negotiation process 5 - 12. The open nature of the so-called precompetitive PPPs complicates agreements with respect to IPRs. The empirical study identifies IPRs concepts used in life sciences precompetitive PPPs and explores the variation of those concepts across precompetitive PPPs. IPRs principles, policies, guidelines, grant agreements and project agreements of 19 precompetitive PPPs have been analyzed. Key concepts such as background IPRs, foreground IPRs, (co-) ownership, access rights and IPRs management are compared. Some precompetitive PPPs allow a certain degree of flexibility during negotiations on IPRs whereas others require partners to stick clearly at restrictive contractually defined IPRs. The executive office of a precompetitive PPP can be an intermediary, but in a few cases it has an active role as partner with equal rights in terms of ownership. Ownership of background IPRs remains with the original owner in 8 of the PPPs investigated. The other PPPs did not include specific guidance on the ownership rights to background IPRs. In terms of foreground IPRs, 8 PPPs assign ownership of new inventions to the idea generator(s), 3 PPPs claim foreground ownership and in 1 case, the partners and the PPP are co-owners of foreground IP. The rules on access rights to background IPRs vary between royalty-free access versus access on ‘fair and reasonable conditions’. Access rights to foreground IPRs cover much more possibilities. The IPRs management is heavily context specific; there is no ‘one size fits all’. In precompetitive PPPs, some projects are only focused on training, education and basic information sharing, whereas other projects are aimed at evolving towards a proof-of-concept stage, wherein access to background IPRs and development of foreground IPRs can implicate the progression of the process. Depending on the scope, the objectives and expected outcome of the project, certain project agreements require very clear and upfront specified grant IPRs clauses, whereas other projects may include more general grant IPRs clauses, leaving room for possible IPRs negotiations further in the project development. For precompetitive PPPs acting as information sharing platforms, flexibility in the IPRs policy might be of key importance 12; 13. A stepwise approach whereby open source templates guide initial knowledge exchange, followed by a ‘closure’ step after which IPRs could be contractually defined once the project becomes more specific, could increase trust and clear early IPRs issues, offering beneficial solutions for both public and private stakeholders. status: accepte...|$|R
