5|$|M34 <b>Prime</b> <b>Mover</b> – M34 Prime Movers {{were simply}} M32B1 Recovery Vehicles without the towing cable and were just used for pulling towed {{artillery}} into place. It was typically reserved for pulling heavy artillery, {{such as the}} 240mm howitzer. It lacked any armament and had four seats for crew. The vehicle also had tail lights, electric outlets for stopping of towed loads, and multiple stowage ports. Production started in 1944 and ended in 1945.|$|E
5|$|The Sd.Kfz. 10 (Sonderkraftfahrzeug - special {{motorized}} vehicle) was a German half-track {{that saw}} widespread use in World War II. Its main role {{was as a}} <b>prime</b> <b>mover</b> for small towed guns such as the 2 cm FlaK 30, the 7.5 cm leIG, or the 3.7 cm PaK 36 anti-tank gun. It could carry eight troops in addition to towing a gun or trailer.|$|E

25|$|<b>Prime</b> <b>movers</b> and tankers had 10.00x22 size tires, while bridge, crane, and semi-tractor trucks had 14.00x20s with {{a larger}} cross-section. All had dual rear tires. Brakes were full air with drum brakes on all wheels. <b>Prime</b> <b>movers</b> had {{adjustable}} electrical brake connections for trailer brakes.|$|R
5|$|Its only combat use in American units {{was with}} the US Marine Corps 1st Tank Battalion during the Pacific War in 1942. However, it is {{believed}} that M2A4s served in Burma and India with the British 7th Hussars and 2nd Royal Tank Regiment during their engagements with the Imperial Japanese Army's 14th Tank Regiment. The M2A4 light tank {{led to the development of}} the M3 Stuart light tank and the M4 Tractor artillery <b>prime</b> <b>mover.</b> The M3 Stuart saw widespread use throughout the war.|$|E
5|$|As {{problems}} with the EMD SDP40F mounted, Amtrak adopted the F40PH as its long-term solution nationwide for diesel service. In the spring of 1977 Amtrak traded 40 SDP40Fs back to EMD; components including the <b>prime</b> <b>mover</b> were installed into an F40PH's frame. The 40 rebuilt locomotives were designated F40PHR and were identical to new-build F40PHs, incorporating the larger fuel tank and more powerful HEP generator which had become standard. Amtrak ultimately acquired 132 F40PHRs in this manner, which combined with new orders between 1975–1988, and the purchase of six GMD F40PHs from GO Transit in 1990, led to a fleet of 216 locomotives, the country's largest fleet.|$|E
5|$|The Sonderkraftfahrzeug 8 ("special {{motorized}} vehicle 8") was a German half-track {{that saw}} widespread use in World War II. Its main roles were as a <b>prime</b> <b>mover</b> for heavy towed guns {{such as the}} 21 cm Mörser 18, the 15 cm Kanone 18 and the 10.5 cm FlaK 38. Approximately 4,000 were produced between 1938 and 1945. It was used in every campaign fought by the Germans in World War II, notably the Invasion of Poland, the Battle of France, the Balkans Campaign, the Eastern Front, the North African Campaign, the Battle of Normandy and the Italian Campaign.|$|E

25|$|The {{situation}} did {{not improve}} much after the war. The <b>prime</b> <b>movers</b> were in constant need of repairs and spare parts were scarce, {{and most of the}} time no more than one of the units was in revenue service. They were taken out of service in April 1951 and the district asked that new <b>prime</b> <b>movers</b> be delivered before they be taken back into use. NSB's board approved this and new Hercules <b>prime</b> <b>movers</b> were installed. Unit 823 completed it retrofitting on 21 November 1953. The other two received the upgrade on 9 April and 10 June 1954, respectively.|$|R

5|$|The first diesel {{locomotive}} used by NSB {{was a single}} Di 1 unit delivered in 1942. It was more cost-efficient than the steam locomotives used on the non-electrified lines, and in 1945, NSB decided {{that it would not}} order more steam locomotives. General Motors' Electro Motive Division (EMD) made a bid to deliver twelve units based on their F7, and NSB agreed to lease a single unit for trial. The body and mechanical components were built by NOHAB, the motors by ASEA and <b>prime</b> <b>mover</b> by EMD. While under production in 1954, GM shipped a G12 for trial in Norway and Sweden. It was tested on the express train on the Dovre Line on 7 August, but proved to have insufficient power, causing the train to be 20 minutes late.|$|E
5|$|For {{passenger}} {{service the}} F40PH has another electrical alternator, the head-end generator. The HEP unit generates three-phase AC power at 480 V (500kW {{on the first}} order, 800kW on later units) for lighting, heating and air-conditioning the train. Originally, F40PHs powered the HEP alternator from the prime mover; from the head end to the train must be a constant frequency, and the <b>prime</b> <b>mover</b> had to turn at a constant 893 RPM while supplying head end power (even standing still, with the throttle in idle). Power to the traction motors was controlled by varying the field excitation of the main (traction) generator. On some later versions of the F40PH (and on many rebuilt F40s), a second small diesel engine {{at the rear of}} the locomotive powers the HEP alternator. In these engines, the prime-mover speed varies in the usual way; they can be identified by the diesel exhaust {{at the rear of the}} locomotive and by their quiet idle. Remaining F40s, with the constant-RPM prime movers, are noticeably louder.|$|E
5|$|In {{the spring}} of 1977 Amtrak faced a power crisis. In {{addition}} to the SDP40Fs derailing, Amtrak was having trouble with two other six-axle designs. The GE E60CP and E60CH electric locomotives were having derailment problems as well; the GE P30CH had the same truck design as E60s and rode poorly, although it did not exhibit the same tendency to derail. Amtrak decided to abandon the SDP40F {{in favor of the}} F40PH, a four-axle design with none of the riding problems of the six-axle locomotives. Amtrak traded 40 SDP40Fs back to EMD; components including the <b>prime</b> <b>mover</b> were installed into an F40PH's frame. Between 1977–1987 Amtrak would trade 132 of the SDP40Fs back to EMD for F40PHRs. The SDP40F remained in service on the Santa Fe longer than anywhere else, although the arrival of HEP-equipped Superliner cars on the Western routes displaced them from there as well. The last SDP40Fs left the Amtrak roster in 1987.|$|E
50|$|Initially {{the first}} {{generation}} PowerStar was very popular with operators who had traditionally only brought North American sourced <b>prime</b> <b>movers,</b> {{due to the fact}} the PowerStar could be sourced with the same driveline as their North American <b>Prime</b> <b>Movers,</b> but with the comfort of a European cab. The PowerStar was very well priced also.|$|R

At the end of the manufacturing process, the <b>prime</b> <b>movers</b> were hot tested before being fitted to the locomotives in Boise. The engines meet US tier three emission standards.|$|R

5|$|The Porsche hull designs {{included}} a rear-mounted turret and a mid-mounted engine. The suspension {{was the same}} as on the Elefant tank destroyer. This had six road wheels per side mounted in paired bogies sprung with short longitudinal torsion bars that were integral to the wheel pair; this saved internal space and facilitated repairs. One Porsche version had a gasoline-electric drive (fundamentally identical to a Diesel-electric transmission, only using a gasoline-fueled engine as the <b>prime</b> <b>mover),</b> similar to a gasoline-electric hybrid but without a storage battery; two separate drive trains in parallel, one per side of the tank, each consisting of a hybrid drive train; gasoline engine – electric generator – electric motor – drive sprocket. This method of propulsion had been attempted before on the Tiger (P) (later Elefant prototypes) and in some US designs, but had never been put into production. The Porsche suspension components were later used on a few of the later Jagdtiger tank destroyers. Another proposal was to use hydraulic drives. Dr. Porsche's unorthodox designs gathered little favour.|$|E

25|$|The SD50's long hood saw {{changes from}} {{previous}} EMD models. The overall frame length was increased, {{and the long}} hood was made substantially longer. The resistors for the dynamic brake grid were moved from their previous location above the <b>prime</b> <b>mover</b> to a new, cooler location {{in front of the}} engine compartment air intakes, where they were more effectively separated {{from the rest of the}} locomotives' systems, and also closer to the locomotive's electrical switchgear, thereby simplifying the <b>prime</b> <b>mover</b> maintenance procedures, and the electrical system as well.|$|E
