40|$|Location {{models are}} formal {{descriptions}} of locations (i. e., named sets of geographical positions) {{as well as}} of semantic relationships among locations. There exist various location models that vary in the considered location information, their level of detail, the kind of modelled relations and the used formal representation. In fact, more complex location models cover more aspects required for implementing location-aware or location-dependent systems, but also require more complex algorithms. As each application domain requires only a limited set of features, limiting a model to those features helps to improve system performance. In this paper, we discuss a novel location model called location <b>poly-hierarchies</b> that models the belonging of one location to one ore more other locations. Furthermore, we present an approach for creating location <b>poly-hierarchies</b> from a given set of locations...|$|R

Relations in lexical databases often form trees, imperfect trees or <b>poly-hierarchies</b> {{which can be}} embedded into concept lattices. Manyto-many relations can be represented as concept lattices where the values from one domain are used as the formal objects and {{the values of the}} other domain as formal attributes. This paper further discusses algorithms for selecting meaningful subsets of lexical databases, the representation of complex relational structures in lexical databases and the use of lattices as basemaps for other lexical relations...|$|R
40|$|Location {{awareness}} {{is a key}} feature of mobile information systems. Typically, location is determined by interpreting a set of measured positions. Various approaches for position determination do exist. They vary greatly in their precision, applicability, and energy requirements. As mobile devices are battery-driven, energy {{is one of the}} most limiting factors for the systemâ€™s uptime. Locations have a hierarchical nature and location-based applications differ in their required precision. In this paper, we present three approaches that utilise location <b>poly-hierarchies</b> in order to reduce the energy demand of continuous location determination: (1) We analyse the dependencies among the different hierarchy levels, (2) we incorporate an adaptive delay between measurements based on the hierarchy level and the calculated minimal required time to change, and (3) we select appropriate positioning techniques for each hierarchy level. We implemented and evaluated our approaches...|$|R
