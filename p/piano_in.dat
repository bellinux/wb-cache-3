5|$|At {{the age of}} six, Flanagan's parents {{gave him}} a {{clarinet}} for Christmas. He learned to read music from playing the clarinet, but {{within a few years}} he preferred the piano. The family had a <b>piano</b> <b>in</b> the house, and Flanagan received lessons from one of his brothers, Johnson, and Gladys Wade Dillard, who also taught Kirk Lightsey and Barry Harris. Flanagan graduated from Northern High School, which he attended with other future musicians, including Sonny Red.|$|E
5|$|He {{married the}} violinist and {{composer}} Claire Delbos also in 1932. Their marriage {{inspired him to}} both compose works for her to play (Thème et variations for violin and <b>piano</b> <b>in</b> the year they were married) and to write pieces to celebrate their domestic happiness, including the song cycle Poèmes pour Mi in 1936, which he orchestrated in 1937. Mi was Messiaen's affectionate nickname for his wife. In 1937 their son Pascal was born. The marriage turned to tragedy when Delbos lost her memory after an operation and {{spent the rest of}} her life in mental institutions.|$|E

5|$|Soon {{after leaving}} Fitzgerald, Flanagan played solo <b>piano</b> <b>in</b> New York. In 1979 {{he was a}} guest on the first series of Marian McPartland's Piano Jazz radio programs.

For much of the 1980s he led a trio that featured bassist George Mraz and various drummers. By around 1990 Flanagan was concentrating on his own appearances and recordings rather than sideman activities. In the early 1990s Mraz was replaced by Peter Washington, whose heavier bass lines added urgency to the trio's sound.|$|E

The Foehls ran the hotel very closely—they lived on the premises.|$|E
5|$|The Pavane (1887) was {{conceived}} and originally written as an orchestral piece. Fauré published the version for <b>piano</b> <b>in</b> 1889. In {{the form of}} an ancient dance, the piece was written to be played more briskly than it has generally come to be performed in its familiar orchestral guise. The conductor Sir Adrian Boult heard Fauré play the piano version several times and noted that he took it at a tempo no slower than crochet=100. Boult commented that the composer's sprightly tempo emphasised that the Pavane was not a piece of German romanticism.|$|E
5|$|The Student and Instructor {{models were}} also {{introduced}} in the late 1960s. They were designed to teach the <b>piano</b> <b>in</b> the classroom.

This allowed the teacher to monitor individual students' progress.|$|E

5|$|As well as {{performing}} {{new works}} dedicated to him, Szigeti also championed {{the music of}} other contemporary composers, notably Sergei Prokofiev and Igor Stravinsky. He {{was among the first}} violinists to make Prokofiev's First Violin Concerto a standard part of his repertoire, and frequently performed and recorded works of Stravinsky (including the Duo Concertante, recorded with the composer at the <b>piano</b> <b>in</b> 1945.) The Berg Violin Concerto he even recorded twice, under the baton of Dimitri Mitropoulos. Most famously, Szigeti recorded the Bloch concerto, a premier recording made in 1939 with the Orchestre de la Société des Concerts du Conservatoire conducted by Charles Munch (originally released on Columbia LP and reissued on Membran CD).|$|E
5|$|By March 2008, the duo had {{recruited}} SebRochford to play drums with Byrne in New York City. Later that month, multi-instrumentalist {{and previous}} Eno collaborator LeoAbrahams was enlisted to perform guitar, percussion instruments, and <b>piano</b> <b>in</b> his London home studio. Abrahams and Rochford would continue {{working on the}} tracks in Abrahams' studio through May and their work was e-mailed to other collaborators—Byrne attended one session to play guitar. Other musicians worked with Byrne in NewYorkCity and Eno in London, such as frequent Byrne collaborator MauroRefosco, Eno's daughters Darla and Irial, and JarvisCocker of Pulp, who added uncredited guitar in London. The duo attempted to record {{as much of the}} music from home studios as possible and played almost all instrumentation themselves, saving the drums and percussion for the studio. In addition to the tracks that were released, the musicians had some other instrumentals that Byrne did not complete.|$|E
5|$|Byard also {{continued}} to play and record with other leaders. While in Europe in 1965, he joined Art Blakey's band {{for a series of}} concerts there. In 1967 Byard played in a small group with drummer Elvin Jones. Between 1966 and 1969 Byard recorded three albums with the saxophonist Eric Kloss, then, in 1970, returned to Mingus' band, including for performances in Europe. Byard occasionally substituted on <b>piano</b> <b>in</b> Duke Ellington's orchestra in 1974 when the leader was unwell. In 1974–75 Byard had a residency at Bradley’s in New York. He also fronted a big band, the Apollo Stompers, which was formed in the late 1970s. There were two versions of the band: one made up of musicians in New York, and the other using students from the New England Conservatory of Music, where Byard had taught from 1969.|$|E
