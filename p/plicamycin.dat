50|$|<b>Plicamycin</b> (INN, {{also known}} as mithramycin; trade name Mithracin) is an antineoplastic {{antibiotic}} produced by Streptomyces plicatus. It is an RNA synthesis inhibitor. The manufacturer discontinued production in 2000. Several different structures are currently reported in different places all with the same chromomycin core, but with different stereochemistry in the glycoside chain, a 1999 study has re-investigated the compound and proposed a revised structure.|$|E
40|$|The authors studied P-glycoprotein (P-gp) {{expression}} in three patients affected by myeloid blast crisis of chronic myeloid leukemia undergoing chemotherapy with <b>plicamycin</b> + hydroxyurea. P-gp is the molecular marker of multidrug resistance (MDR), {{and is able}} to promote the efflux of various drugs (including <b>plicamycin)</b> from the neoplastic cell. When resistance towards <b>plicamycin</b> and hydroxyurea association was observed, the blasts obtained from the three patients were found to express P-gp. Although P-gp may be not the unique mechanism responsible for resistance towards <b>plicamycin</b> and hydroxyurea association, the MDR phenotype may {{play an important role in}} the resistance towards this treatment protocol in the blast crisis of chronic myeloid leukemia...|$|E
40|$|Between 1987 - 1988 we treated, in a {{cooperative}} study, 13 patients in blast crisis of CGL according to Koller and Miller's regimen. We observed no {{return to the}} chronic phase of the disease, while some patients suffered major drug-induced side effects. Six patients in accelerated phase were treated with the same combination therapy. All of them responded with {{a return to the}} chronic phase for a median of 4. 5 months. In our hands the combination of <b>plicamycin</b> and hydroxyurea was ineffective in patients with CGL in blast crisis. This regimen could deserve further evaluation in patients with CGL in acceleration...|$|E
30|$|Many {{chemotherapeutic}} agents {{with different}} mechanisms of action {{have been developed}} up to now. Apoptosis induction {{is one of the}} mechanisms which has attracted researchers' attention for fighting against cancer [1]. Doxorubicin [2], daunorubicin [3], idarubicin [4], bleomycin [5], mitomycin C [6], cisplatin [7], <b>plicamycin</b> [8], and carmustine [9] are of the well-known apoptogenic agents; although in order to serve them in targeted drug delivery system, appropriate drug carriers should be employed. Such carriers are aimed to facilitate drug delivery procedure and avoid problems like bioavailability and normal tissue toxicity. In this regard, the issues such as loading efficacy and controlled release of the agents are of the inseparable obstacles that researchers are confronted with up to now. The development of an agent that possesses the favorable drug carrier characteristics and acts as an apoptogenic agent by itself could be a promising method for coping with the mentioned obstacles.|$|E
40|$|As {{the major}} issue {{to limit the}} use of drugs, drug safety leads to the {{attrition}} or failure in clinical trials of drugs. Therefore, {{it would be more}} efficient to minimize therapeutic risks if it could be predicted before large-scale clinical trials. Here, we integrated a network topology analysis with cheminformatics measurements on drug information from the DrugBank database to detect the discrepancies between approved drugs and withdrawn drugs and give drug safety indications. Thus, 47 approved drugs were unfolded with higher similarity measurements to withdrawn ones by the same target and confirmed to be already withdrawn or discontinued in certain countries or regions in subsequent investigations. Accordingly, with the 2 D chemical fingerprint similarity calculation as a medium, the method was applied to predict pharmacovigilance for natural products from an in-house traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) database. Among them, Silibinin was highlighted for the high similarity to the withdrawn drug <b>Plicamycin</b> although it was regarded as a promising drug candidate with a lower toxicity in existing reports. In summary, the network approach integrated with cheminformatics could provide drug safety indications effectively, especially for compounds with unknown targets or mechanisms like natural products. It would be helpful for drug safety surveillance in all phases of drug development...|$|E

40|$|There {{has been}} a {{dramatic}} change in the therapeutic approach to patients with Paget's disease of bone over the last 40 years. In the 1960 s, only symptomatic therapy could be given, with control of pain the main objective. Analgesics and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs were the most commonly used agents. From 1968 onwards, antiosteoclastic agents became available, including calcitonin, <b>plicamycin</b> (mithramycin) and etidronate (etidronic acid), a first-generation bisphosphonate. Limitations with these agents, including potentially deleterious effects on bone mineralization with etidronate (etidronic acid), has cleared the way for increasingly potent second- and third-generation bisphosphonates, including clodronate (clodronic acid), pamidronate (pamidronic acid), alendronate (alendronic acid) and risedronate (risedronic acid). Even more potent bisphosphonates will become available in the near future. With the newer bisphosphonates, there is some hope for long-term remission (if not definitive healing) of pagetic lesions, as well as prevention of long-term complications in both symptomatic and asymptomatic patients. Thus, indications for therapy have been extended to include younger patients to prevent bone deformity of the limbs and skull, leading to secondary osteoarthritis, facial deformities and potentially to sarcoma transformation; as well as to elderly patients to prevent bone fragility, leading to fracture, and pagetic vascular steal syndromes. The increased potency and longer duration of action of newer bisphosphonates more than compensates for their marginally increased cost compared with older bisphosphonates...|$|E
40|$|Introduction. Among the {{numerous}} paraneoplastic syndromes of the lung carcinoma, metabolic manifestations {{are of the}} particular clinical relevance. They are the consequence of the prominent neurosecretory activity of certain peptides and hormones, mostly within amine precursor uptake and decarboxylation (APUD) secretion. Small cell lung carcinoma {{is the most common}} cause of paraneoplastic syndromes. Ectopically produced proteins by the tumor are structurally similar but biologically less active than the ”true” hormones, which may be clinically manifested by absent, less frequent or milder symptoms of the hormonal imbalance. Malignant hyponatremia. Malignant hyponatremia may be caused by arginine-vasopressin imbalance within the syndrome of inappropriate secretion of antidiuretic hormone (SIADH), or by hypersecretion of the atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP). Beside the postural hypotension, clinical picture is characterized by neurological symptoms caused by plasma hypo-osmolality, resulting in detection of the occult pulmonary neoplasm as well as post-therapeutic exacerbation of the small cell carcinoma. Malignant hypercalcemia. Malignant hypercalcemia is the most common paraneoplastic endocrine syndrome. In about 80 % of the lung carcinomas without bone metastases it is caused by an increase of the parathyroid hormone-releasing protein (PTH-rP) in interaction with certain cytokines, products of the autochthonous neuroendocrine tumor secretion, predominantly in the squamous cell carcinoma. The cells expressing PTH-rP show coexpression of some neuroendocrine products. Conclusion. Different degrees of hypercalcemia cause heterogenous manifestations - from fatigue, anorexia, bone pains through polyuria, polydipsia, gastrointestinal complaints all the way to confusion, lethargy, coma and death. In addition to prevention of the intravascular volume overload, the treatment occasionally necessitates substitution of calcitonin possibly with <b>plicamycin</b> and gallium nitrate...|$|E
40|$|International audienceSAHA (vorinostat) is a {{histone deacetylase}} {{inhibitor}} {{approved by the}} USA Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for treating advanced refractory cutaneous T cell lymphomas. As SAHA alters the expression of many genes under control of the Sp 1 transcription factor, we examined the effect of its association with the FDA-approved anticancer antibiotic Mithramycin A (MTR, <b>plicamycin),</b> a competitive inhibitor of Sp 1 binding to DNA. Sézary syndrome (SS) cells, expanded ex vivo from {{peripheral blood mononuclear cells}} of 4 patients, were tested for their sensitivity to the drugs regarding cytotoxicity and differential responsive gene expression. Multivariate statistical methods were used to identify genes whose expression is altered by SAHA, MTR, and the synergist effect of the two drugs. MTR, like SAHA, induced the apoptosis of SS cells, while the two drugs in combination showed clear synergy or potentiation. Expression data stressed a likely important role of additive or synergistic epigenetic modifications in the combined effect of the two drugs, while direct inhibition of Sp 1 -dependent transcription seemed to have only limited impact. Ontological analysis of modified gene expression suggested that the two drugs, either independently or synergistically, counteracted many intertwined pro-survival pathways deregulated in SS cells, resistance of these tumors to intrinsic and extrinsic apoptosis, abnormal adhesion migration, and invasive properties, as well as immunosuppressive behavior. Our findings provide preliminary clues on the individual and combined effects of SAHA and MTR in SS cells and highlight a potential therapeutic interest of this novel pair of drugs for treatment of SS patients...|$|E
