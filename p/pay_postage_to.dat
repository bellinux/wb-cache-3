Gibson announced {{on the morning}} of July 16, 2008 that West End Games could not currently afford to provide refunds to customers who preordered the canceled Septimus product, and indeed could not even afford <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> the <b>postage</b> <b>to</b> ship books to individuals who expressed a willingness to accept a refund in the form of products instead of money.|$|R
50|$|The {{issue of}} Russian postage stamps is {{directly}} related <b>to</b> <b>postage</b> rates in force at given times during {{the history of the}} Russian postal service. Stamp denominations were applied to meet a public need <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> <b>postage</b> costs according <b>to</b> the current rates. Issuing values for the revenue generation was not a purpose of the state policy in this area. Change of postage rates is an important aspect in studying the Russian postal history and collecting its items.|$|R
50|$|The British Packet Agency {{office was}} amalgamated with the Barbados Post Office in 1858. Six pence red and one-shilling brown-black stamps were ordered {{and sent to}} the island in October 1858. These stamps did show the value. Up till 1860 all the stamps were imperforate, from 1860 the stamps were {{supplied}} perforated. In 1873 two new values were supplied a three pence and a five shilling stamp. It is believed {{that the purpose of the}} three-penny stamp was <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> for <b>postage</b> <b>to</b> Great Britain by vessels other than the regular mail packets. The five-shilling stamp was not intended for any special rate and was used on heavy postal packets.|$|R
60|$|This letter, with {{a silver}} coin,--much {{more than enough to}} pay any {{possible}} postage,--had been handed by Shirley to the first mate of the British steamer, in the harbor of Valparaiso, and that officer had given it to a seaman, who was going on shore, with directions {{to take it to the}} post-office, and <b>pay</b> for the <b>postage</b> out of the silver coin, and whatever change there might be, he should keep it for his trouble. On the way to the post-office, this sailor stopped to refresh himself, and meeting with a fellow-mariner in the place of refreshment, he refreshed him also. And by the time the two had refreshed themselves to their satisfaction, there was not much left of the silver coin--not enough <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> the necessary <b>postage</b> <b>to</b> France.|$|R
50|$|Michel also {{documents}} stamps issued apparently {{with little}} or no intent of being used <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> <b>postage</b> and stamps issued by regions or areas with dubious political status. Scott excludes many issues that were unlikely to be actually used <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> <b>postage.</b>|$|R
50|$|In some countries, it was {{permitted}} to cut out the imprinted stamp and use it <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> <b>postage</b> on another item of mail. This {{is also known as}} a cut-out.|$|R
50|$|In late 2005, the Washington Post {{reported}} that the Christian Coalition was unable <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> its office <b>postage</b> bill <b>to</b> Pitney Bowes. In addition, it had not paid new lawyers in Virginia Beach; the law firm sued the Coalition.|$|R

5000|$|Entitled [...] "Columbus in Sight of Land", this {{lowest value}} in the set {{was based on a}} {{painting}} by William Powell and was one of several to be engraved by Alfred Jones. This stamp was used primarily <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> <b>postage</b> on third-class mail.|$|R
5000|$|One of {{the most}} common uses is when {{companies}} are legally required to send something upon request, such as a [...] "winners list" [...] {{at the end of a}} sweepstakes; the company will require a SASE to be included with the request <b>to</b> avoid <b>paying</b> <b>postage.</b>|$|R
60|$|He {{took two}} sheets of note paper {{instead of one}} sheet of letter paper, in order that, if he should get tired after filling one of them, he could stop, and so send what he had written, without causing his father <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> <b>postage</b> on any useless paper.|$|R

At the time the KNPP was controlling part of Karenni State (Kayah State). Covers bearing these stamps were actually sent by the Karenni, with Thai stamps <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> <b>postage.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Voting in {{the states}} of Oregon, Washington, and Colorado are unique {{in regards to the}} rest of the nation, in that voting is {{conducted}} entirely by mail.

50|$|As a {{refinement}} {{to stamp}} systems is {{the method of}} requiring that a micropayment only be made (or some other form of penalty imposed) if the recipient considers the email to be abusive. This addresses the principal objection to stamp systems: popular free legitimate mailing list hosts {{would be unable to}} continue to provide their services if they had <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> <b>postage</b> for every message they sent.|$|R
2500|$|In 1837, British {{postal rates}} were high, complex and anomalous. To simplify matters, Sir Rowland Hill {{proposed}} an adhesive stamp to indicate pre-payment of postage. At {{the time it}} was normal for the recipient <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> <b>postage</b> on delivery, charged by the sheet and on distance travelled. By contrast, the Penny Black allowed letters of up to [...] to be delivered at a flat rate of one penny, regardless of distance.|$|R

Part of an evolving suite of USPS electronic payment services called PostalOne!, eVS allows mailers shipping {{large volumes of}} parcels through the Postal Service a way to circumvent use of hard-copy manifests, postage statements and drop-shipment verification forms. Instead, mailers can <b>pay</b> <b>postage</b> automatically through a centralized account and track payments online.|$|R

40|$|We aim to {{estimate}} the elasticity of voter turnout. We analyze how voters react {{to a change in}} voting costs. Some municipalities in the canton of Berne reduced voting costs by <b>paying</b> the <b>postage</b> of the return envelope when voters opt for postal voting. We find that <b>paying</b> the <b>postage</b> is associated with a statistically significant 1. 8 percentage point increase in voter turnout. This increase in turnout negatively affects the alignment of voters with leftist party positions...|$|R
50|$|The stamp {{program of}} a postal {{organization}} is an umbrella {{term for the}} entire process of postage stamp issuance and distribution by the organization. Aspects include the decision of about stamps to issue, what postal rates they will <b>pay,</b> <b>postage</b> stamp design, printing, and publicity for the new stamps. The stamp program is generally managed by a specialized department within the organization, which balances demands {{from the rest of}} the organization, the nation's government, stamp collectors, and the public which actually buy and use the stamps.|$|R
5000|$|... "Columbus Announcing His Discovery" [...] depicts {{his return}} to court from his first voyage. The {{original}} painting by Ricardo Baloca y Cancico is lost and {{is believed to have}} been destroyed during the Spanish Civil War. Originally intended <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> <b>postage</b> for international registered letters, the change in the registered mail fee left this stamp with fewer direct uses. Although it would pay the cost for a triple-rate international letter, it was most commonly used in combination with other stamps to meet more expensive heavyweight charges.|$|R
5000|$|It is {{somewhat}} misleading {{to characterize the}} mailbox rule as a [...] "monopoly," [...] because the enforcement of [...] leaves customers with ample alternative means of delivering their messages. Customers can deliver their messages either by <b>paying</b> <b>postage,</b> by placing messages on or under a door or a doormat, by using newspaper or non-postal boxes, by telephoning or emailing, by engaging in person-to-person delivery in public areas, by tacking or taping their notices on a door post, or by placing advertisements in local newspapers. These methods are comparable in efficacy to communication via the mailbox.|$|R

He boasts of his own {{abilities}} in business and lists his eight [...] "speculations" [...] for success. He then tries forging letters and delivering them to rich people, asking them <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> <b>postage</b> themselves, as was the custom at the time.

50|$|A {{registered}} envelope {{is a form}} of {{postal stationery}} consisting of a strong envelope with an imprinted stamp used for sending registered mail. The envelopes usually include a perpendicular blue cross and an R in a circle symbol, both internationally recognised symbols of registered mail. The imprinted stamp (often on the flap) shows the fee for the registration service, while a space is left for a <b>postage</b> stamp <b>to</b> be affixed <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> the <b>postage</b> fee. The envelopes are usually marked Registered Letter but that term strictly only relates to a normal letter or packet that has extra postage and markings applied so that it may travel under the registered mail service.|$|R

25|$|During {{the first}} half year of its {{inception}} the Parcel Post service with its new series of special stamps proved to be very successful, resulting with the mailing of more than 300 million parcels during this short period. But after much confusion among and pressure from postal workers, the Post Office Department acquiesced and the Postmaster General authorized the use of ordinary <b>postage</b> stamps <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> the <b>postage</b> on 4th class parcels, beginning on July 1, 1913, ending mandatory use of the new stamps after precisely six months. In turn Parcel Post stamps were allowed for use <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> the <b>postage</b> for all classes of mail until the supply finally ran out. This is the only series of stamps issued by the Post Office that have ever been allowed dual usage. The last printing of Parcel Post stamps, a run of the 10-cent value, occurred on June 24, 1913, but stamps still in stock continued to be shipped to post offices for quite some time, particularly of higher values, with the final delivery—a supply of 75-cent stamps—made as late as 1921. Although the stamps were discontinued, one new denomination of the series—20 cents—was deemed too useful to discard, and a 20 cent value was accordingly added to the existing definitive Washington-Franklin series.|$|R

[...] Balloting materials may be sent via the U.S. Postal Service without prepayment of postage for [...] "members of the Armed Forces in active service (and their spouses and dependents)"; [...] "members of the U.S. Merchant Marine and their spouses and dependents"; and [...] "U.S. citizens residing outside the territorial limits of the United States and the District of Columbia and their spouses and dependents residing with or accompanying them." ...|$|R

25|$|The stamps {{were printed}} by the Bureau of Engraving and Printing which had only {{six weeks to}} design, print and {{distribute}} the issues to customers for use on mail to Germany {{in time for the}} departing flight. However U.S. the Post Office would only receive a small profit of 6.5% of the stamp’s denomination for letters that would actually be carried aboard the Graf Zeppelin. The German Zeppelin Airship Works would receive most of the profit for those stamps that were actually used <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> <b>postage</b> and were carried by their airship. The U.S. Post Office still agreed to issue the stamps anticipating that most of the stamps sold would be to stamp collectors eager to add the new stamps to their stamp collections, and consequently would be retaining all of the revenue generated.|$|R
