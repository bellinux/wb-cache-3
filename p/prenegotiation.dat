40|$|Only {{after four}} years of prenegotiations did the Uruguay Round of Multilateral Trade Negotiations take place in 1986. This paper {{analyzes}} the <b>prenegotiation</b> phase on international trade in services by focusing on a North-South perspective of the underlying economics of international trade in services and the diplomatic exercise this <b>prenegotiation</b> phase set off. The factors during the <b>prenegotiation</b> phase which led to the launch of the Uruguay Round of negotiations are dissected as well as how the <b>prenegotiation</b> phase weakened the GATT’s long standing positive reputation. An overview of the important economic issues which will influence the General Agreement on Trade in Services (GATS) is included...|$|E
40|$|In this paper, I {{explore the}} <b>prenegotiation</b> process between Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO), which {{extended}} over eight months in 1993 {{and ended with}} {{the signing of the}} Declaration of Principles (DOP) in September of that year. During this period, the parties committed to recognize each other and conduct future negotiations with the aim of ending a century of conflict. The DOP was considered a significant breakthrough in Israeli-Palestinian relations. Scholars of Conflict Resolution typically view the discussions that led to the DOP as a positive example of how antagonists in ethno-national conflicts begin a course of constructive dialogue and conciliation. Applying <b>prenegotiation</b> theory, I question this assumption and argue that the <b>prenegotiation</b> process that took place between January and August 1993 leading the parties to commit to official negotiations and sign the DOP was in fact no more than a means of conflict management adjusting to contemporary circumstances. The research will uncover the factors that brought the leaders of both parties to consider negotiation and move towards accepting it as the best option at their disposal. I explore the functions that the <b>prenegotiation</b> performed and discuss how both parties failed to ensure that the necessary <b>prenegotiation</b> functions of the process were exhausted. Thus, my analysis indicates that the failure of the Oslo process, which began with the signing of the DOP, was inherent in the process 2 ̆ 7 s flawed basis...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{studies the}} process of <b>prenegotiation</b> {{and the role of}} {{mediators}} during the negotiations between the Argentine and British governments about the dispute over the sovereignty of the Falkland/Malvinas Islands from immediately after the war of 1982 to 1990. In this period, the relationship between both governments evolved from rupture and no-relations to the agreement on the conditions to negotiate the renewal of full diplomatic relations concluded in early 1990. In a preliminary process of <b>prenegotiation,</b> the governments of Switzerland, initially, and the United States played a role in helping to reach an agreement. The former failed when the talks ended abruptly in July 1984. The latter succeeded in getting both parties to the table and keeping them there, thus avoiding a potential rupture until the two parties reached an agreement in principle. During the <b>prenegotiation</b> stage, the principal parties were able to reduce the risks of escalation; they defined and narrowed the boundaries of the dispute, clearly identified the trade-offs, and structured the agenda of formal negotiations. Consequently, the likelihood of successful negotiation improved significantly when the parties reach an agreement during <b>prenegotiation</b> on what will be discussed later. This case also illustrate that sometimes, when negotiations reach a point of stalemate, a mediator can help to find a "zone of agreement". When this situation occurs, the degree of involvement and the resources of the mediator are particularly important. Finally, this case confirms the assertions that effective mediation is more a matter of leverage and influence than a matter of impartiality. international negotiation, <b>prenegotiation,</b> mediation, Falklands, Malvinas...|$|E

We examine one particular {{phase in the}} decision making process within the European Union, namely the domestic <b>prenegotiations</b> on legislative proposals of the Commission.

40|$|International {{environmental}} agreements (IEAs) are treaties negotiated, signed, and ratified by individual nation-states to address transboundary environmental issues. This article {{provides an overview}} of the recent state of the art in the domain of the political economy of the formation of IEAs. Central to this survey is the question how the political process impacts different stages of agreement formation and ultimately the stability of the agreement. Of particular relevance are the rules defined during <b>prenegotiations</b> that govern the negotiation process, ratification, and implementation. Strategic delegation and lobbying are directly relevant during the negotiation and ratification phases. What matters for implementation is the choice of policy instruments at the national level, which are impacted by lobbying and, hence, indirectly influence negotiations. Theoretical analyses of IEAs have mainly employed game-theoretic models to study the incentives of countries to sign and ratify agreements. Models of the political processes leading to an agreement have only emerged recently. Empirical results, including results from experimental work, complement theoretical approaches...|$|R
40|$|The study {{looks at}} the {{application}} of preference programming approaches and techniques for decision support during <b>prenegotiations</b> over services. In hierarchical decision analysis models the need for multi-attribute evaluation techniques that may incorporate uncertainties directly in the modeling phase {{has resulted in the}} use of the ‘interval’ approach. With such an approach, preference judgments are presented as ranges including all possible value estimates. This paper reports the results of applying an interval preference programming approach and technique in decision support scenarios for reasoning during pre-negotiations over services. The aim has been to critically evaluate the approach and establish its applicability for ranking multi-dimensional service offers. Our experimental results using interval SMART, in pre-negotiation decision making scenarios, showed that while the dominance relations among alternatives remained unchanged following the introduction of uncertainty intervals, the rank order and dominance relations of the alternatives may vary as a result of the addition or dropping of new alternatives with inferior values...|$|R

The paper identifies how these approaches have and can be used to assist negotiation practitioners, offer a rationale for the application of decision analytic approaches in terms of the particular analytical requirements of the <b>prenegotiation</b> period, suggests how these process-oriented tools can be integrated with substantive tools, and discusses ways in which these tools can be presented and delivered to practitioners in a practical and confidence-building manner...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{develops}} {{a conceptual framework}} and applies it to analyze the dynamics of national interests in <b>prenegotiation.</b> The study's goals are to develop a systematic approach for analyzing <b>prenegotiation</b> processes and provide results that will have practical utility for negotiators. Specifically, the approach {{is applied to the}} <b>prenegotiation</b> process of the 1992 United Nations Conference on Environment and Development (UNCED), examining the financial resources issue, in particular. Decision analytic models were built to account for three key negotiation actors, and sensitivity analyses were performed to evaluate the incremental modifications to issue preferences required to achieve mutually acceptable compromises. Conclusions are drawn that indicate the extent of flexibility required of key negotiation actors {{to take advantage of the}} opportunities for agreement in the financial resources issue area. The conceptual framework and methodological approach explored in this paper can provide practical assistance as a planning tool for negotiators, helping them to diagnose the situation and plan strategies for future environmental and other multilateral negotiations. The approach can suggest specific opportunities for compromise and the degree and type of flexibility needed to achieve a convergence of interests on the issue...|$|E
40|$|The issues, the {{activities}} and the relations preceding the formal international negotiations have increasingly become an area of a special theoretical interest. The <b>prenegotiation</b> or the <b>prenegotiation</b> phase {{is part of the}} broader issue of the dynamic interactive process of international negotiations. The Southeast European region or the Balkans, in particular its people and political leaders, could utilize much of the conceptual experience of prenegotiating in coping with the multitude of major and minor real and potential conflicts and other issues. Prenegotiations provide an opportunity to approach and be involved in managing significant issues, including conflicts, without taking the risk of formal commitments, as well as facilitating the very negotiations in areas as determining the participants, the agenda, etc. A basic benefit from prenegotiations by all parties is the possibility to understand better the specific mechanism of shaping the partner 2 ̆ 7 s and the own party 2 ̆ 7 s commitment to negotiate. Switching from the traditional bargaining model of negotiations to the problem-solving model in the Balkans, utilizing to the most the third-party capacity and the seminar and workshop experience of dealing with particular issues in an informal way are special accents in the <b>prenegotiation</b> potential applied to Southeast European issues...|$|E
40|$|Negotiations on the {{establishment}} of a Middle East zone free of biological, nuclear, and chemical weapons and their means of delivery are now at a critical phase after more than three decades of <b>prenegotiations.</b> This article examines the factors that have impeded negotiations in order to identify the key actors whose mutually reinforcing efforts are essential to its establishment. We argue that current efforts to negotiate a zone free of nuclear weapons and other {{weapons of mass destruction and}} their delivery systems (WMDFZ) in the Middle East can learn much from the successful negotiation of other nuclear weapons free zones (NWFZs). Nevertheless, the circumstances in the Middle East are unique and require a more holistic approach. Success here will depend largely on a multidimensional perspective that brings together the energies and insights of a range of state and nonstate actors, not least civil society in the Middle East, where confidence and trust building is too complex and demanding a task to be seen as the preserve of political and geostrategic calculation. Enabling the societies and polities of the region to identify areas of mistrust and misunderstanding across strategic, political, but also cultural and religious divides in order to open up possibilities for dialogue and mutual respect holds the key to creating a favorable negotiating environment...|$|R
40|$|A Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty (CTBT) {{had been}} on the arms control agenda since 1954, the subject of {{intermittent}} bilateral or trilateral talks that achieved only partial measures. The end of the Cold War provided renewed public pressure and political impetus for banning nuclear explosions. This thesis analyses the context and processes of the multilateral test ban negotiations that opened in the Conference on Disarmament in 1994. Combining participant-observation and contemporaneous notes with extensive use of documentary sources, unpublished materials and interviews, the study explores the dynamics of the CTBT negotiations in light both of regime theory and post cold war concepts of multilateralism, highlighting the role of civil society actors as well as states. Providing historical background and rich detail on the negotiating process from 1994 - 1996, the thesis examines the causal factors, strengths and weaknesses of the outcomes in four key areas: <b>prenegotiations,</b> scope, verification and entry into force. Focusing on the strategies and mechanisms by which actors with competing expectations and interests reached agreement, two types of convergence are explored: distributive, encompassing both imposed and managed divisions of gains and losses; and integrative, in which expectations of what would constitute an acceptable agreement are expanded or changed through cognitive strategies and the shaping of norms and interests. The thesis shows that whilst sharing a general objective of a CTBT, governments had significantly different views on what a test ban should encompass and accomplish, particularly with respect to broader concepts of nonproliferation and disarmament. While nuclear interests {{played a major role in}} determining a state's expectations and negotiating posture, other factors were important in reaching convergence. These included: knowledge and ideas; civil society engagement; norms and regime values; partnerships and alliances; internal policy cohesion or division; and the level of domestic and international political attention and support. By choosing to incorporate transnational civil society as a principal unit of analysis, along with states, the thesis contributes to a fuller understanding of how governments' calculations of what constitutes self-interest and security can be influenced and shaped, opening up alternative solutions for agreement than might have been initially envisaged.

40|$|With {{the end of}} the Cold War and of the {{predictability}} of bi-polar power arrangements, {{the opportunity}} to shape global security has arisen. As the sole remaining superpower the United States has an opportunity and probably a requirement to attempt to shape this new international environment. As new conflicts arise and old ones continue nations try to negotiate to solve these problems diplomatically. To facilitate negotiations a phase of <b>prenegotiation</b> takes place {{to try to get the}} parties to the negotiating table. This thesis uses the British-IRA prenegotiations to examine this process and to explore the role the United States can and should play in international conflict resolution. The case is studied using <b>prenegotiation</b> and negotiation theory, which is reviewed in Chapter 2. The current British-IRA prenegotiations process is examined along with the role the United States has played. Despite British objections the United States has gotten involved in facilitating the talks, often benefitting the IRA-Sinn Fein side. This has had a negative effect on the British-U. S. relations, but the overall effect has been positive, forcing the issue and moving the prenegotiations towards formal negotiations. NAU. S. Navy (U. S. N.) autho...|$|E

In this paper we address these problems by organizing the supply chain {{as a collection of}} autonomous agents that are able to coordinate their activities through negotiation. The agents generate plans of action towards the achievement of their goals and, over time, conflicts inevitably occur among them. Conflict resolution is crucial for achieving effective multi-agent coordination. Negotiation is the predominant process for resolving conflicts.

40|$|This study {{assesses the}} role of {{political}} leadership in international regime formation. It is argued that political leadership is a necessary, but not sufficient, condition {{for the success of}} efforts to reach agreement through processes of institutional bargaining that dominate attempts to form regimes in international society. The theoretical work of Oran Yotmg has drawn attention to the issue of leadership in the formation of international regimes. This study has sought to test ideas, derived from his work, {{in the context of the}} international regime regulating human activities in Antarctica which was established under the terms of the Antarctic Treaty of 1959. Based largely on the analysis of recently released government archival material, this case study contrasts the failed attempt to form an Antarctic regime in the late 1940 s and early 1950 s with the success of efforts in the late 1950 s. Indeed, the failure of the efforts undertaken in the earlier period to solve what was known as the Antarctic Problem provides a near experimental condition (or relevant counterfactual) to compare with the success of the efforts which culminated in the signing and ratification of the 1959 Treaty. This thesis confirms Young's hypothesis that political leadership is a multidimensional phenomenon which plays a critical role in regime formation. While leadership was present in both attempts to form an Antarctic regime, the emergence of intellectual leadership in the late 1940 s was not complemented by structural or significant entrepreneurial leadership to overcome or circumvent <b>prenegotiation</b> problems. In the later, successful attempt, the ideas generated and proposed through intellectual leadership in the earlier period were complemented with entrepreneurial leadership and structural leadership that were crucial in overcoming extant <b>prenegotiation</b> and other institutional bargaining problems. Thus, the case study suggests that entrepreneurial, structural and intellectual forms of leadership are necessary for regime formation to occur. ...|$|E

40|$|MPI is {{the main}} {{standard}} for communication in high-performance clusters. MPI implementations use the Eager protocol to transfer small messages. To avoid the cost of memory registration and <b>prenegotiation,</b> the Eager protocol involves a data copy to intermediate buffers at both sender and receiver sides. In this paper, however, we propose that when a user buffer is used frequently in an application, it is more efficient to register the sender buffer and avoid the sender-side data copy. The performance results of our proposed Eager protocol on MVAPICH 2 over InfiniBand indicate that up to 14 % improvement can be achieved in a single medium-size message latency, comparable to a maximum 15 % theoretical improvement on our platform. We also show that collective communications such as broadcast can benefit from the new protocol by up to 19 %. In addition, the communication time in MPI applications with high buffer reuse is improved using this technique. 1...|$|E
40|$|Effects {{of eight}} {{variables}} on yielding behavior {{and time to}} resolution were evaluated by a meta-analysis of published bargaining experiments reported over a twenty-five year period. The strongest effect sizes were obtained for the variables of <b>prenegotiation</b> experience, negotiator's orientation, initial position distance, and time pressure. Weak effect sizes were shown for large versus small issues, representation, and visibility of the bargaining process. These results challenge the assertion made by Blake and Mouton (1989) that group representation {{is the most important}} determinant of competitive behavior in bargaining. Analyses of differences in procedures used in the strongest and weakest effect-size studies in each category suggest a number of conditions under which bargainers are likely to be intransigent. Comparison of the meta-analysis results with those obtained from a simulation where similar variables were combined in scenarios revealed stronger effect sizes for the combined variables both across and within stages of the simulation. Further analyses would elucidate effects of other independent and dependent variables as these are explored in future experimentation...|$|E

In this paper we have outlined the role of multicriterial methods in programming expert systems to decide in favor of the most eligible variant between a multitude of possibilities. We also made a case study and designed the prototype of an expert system for choosing the most profitable offer among many, in the <b>prenegotiation</b> stage, for a company, in order to organize the negotiation processes accor-dingly.

40|$|Many trade {{negotiations}} involve large cuts in high tariffs, while allowing smaller cuts for an agreed share of politically sensitive products. The {{effects of these}} flexibilities on market access opportunities are difficult to predict, creating particular problems for developing countries in assessing whether to support a proposed trade agreement. Some widely used ad hoc approaches for identifying likely sensitive products—such as the highest-bound-tariff rule—suggest {{that the impact of}} a limited number of such exceptions on average tariffs and market access is likely to be minor. Applying a rigorous specification based on the apparent objectives of policymakers in setting the <b>prenegotiation</b> tariff enables more accurate assessment of the implications of sensitive-product provisions for average agricultural tariffs, economic welfare, and market access under the Doha negotiations. The analysis concludes that highest-tariff rules are likely to seriously underestimate the impacts on average tariffs and that treating even 2 percent of tariff lines as sensitive is likely to have a sharply adverse impact on economic welfare. The impacts on market access are also adverse, but much smaller, perhaps reflecting the mercantilist focus of the negotiating process. Copyright, Oxford University Press. ...|$|E
40|$|In {{this paper}} we propose a multi-criteria model based on the fuzzy {{preferences}} approach which can be implemented in the <b>prenegotiation</b> phase to evaluate the negotiations packages. The applicability of some multi-criteria ranking methods were discussed for building a scoring function for negotiation packages. The first one is Simple Additive Weighting (SAW) technique which determines the sum of the partial satisfactions from each negotiation issue and aggregate them using the issue weights. The other one is Distance Based Methods (DBM), with its extension based on the distances to ideal or anti-ideal package, i. e. the TOPSIS procedure. In our approach the negotiator's preferences over the issues are represented by fuzzy membership functions and next a selected multi-criteria decision making method is adopted to determine the global rating of each package. The membership functions are used here as the equivalents of utility functions spread over the negotiation issues, which let us compare different type of data. One of the key advantages of the approach proposed is its usefulness for building a general scoring function in the ill-structured negotiation problem, namely the situation in which the problem itself as well as the negotiators preferences cannot be precisely defined, the available information is uncertain, subjective and vague. Secondly, all proposed variants of scoring functions produce consistent rankings, even though the new packages are added (or removed) and do not result in rank reversal...|$|E
40|$|Includes bibliographical references. This {{dissertation}} {{examines the}} pre-negotiation {{stage of the}} negotiation process in South Africa leading to the first plenary session of the Convention for a Democratic of South Africa on 20 December 1991. The pre-negotiation stage was that period in the South African conflict when negotiated solutions were considered, and negotiation towards a political settlement was adopted as an option by the major parties, namely the National Party South African government and the African National Congress. The central question this dissertation asks is why did the South African multiparty negotiations begin? This question is important; De Klerk's seminal address to the Tricameral Parliament on 2 February 1990, and the subsequent release of Nelson Mandela on 11 February 1990, is often considered {{as the beginning of}} the negotiation process in South Africa. This however is not true. Negotiations did take place before this date and they were crucial in shaping the path towards multiparty negotiations. The important question therefore is what prepared the ground for 2 February 1990, and the resulting political process that l ed to multiparty negotiations. The dissertation thus has two sub-questions: (1) why negotiations in South Africa occurred at all; and (2) why the South African government ended up negotiating with the ANC. To answer these questions, the dissertation will use I. William Zartman's theory of ripeness as a guide, and Brian Tomlin's five-staged model of <b>prenegotiation</b> as an analytical framework. In this respect, the dissertation is a theoretical singlecase study. The dissertation argues that multiparty negotiations in South Africa began because the South African government and the African National Congress reached a shared understanding that the South African conflict could be solved through a negotiated solution, produced a commitment to a negotiated solution, and in the process, overcame the problem of preconditions as a barrier to the opening of multiparty negotiations...|$|E
40|$|The Preparatory Committee (PrepCom) of the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development (UNCED) was {{in session}} between March 18 and April 5, 1991. The Project on the Processes of International Negotiation (PIN) sent two {{observers}} to the session. Many issues were discussed and debated among the national delegations. One of them, presented in detail {{for the first}} time, was Agenda 21, a program to coordinate action on environmental and developmental issues after the 1992 UNCED conference. The joint purpose of this working paper is to witness the generation of a new formula [...] an agreement in principle [...] concerning Agenda 21 and to provide guidance and recommendations to the Secretariat {{on how to handle}} this issue to achieve an early convergence of interests among the national delegations. First, the paper presents initial reactions to the Agenda 21 proposal that PIN observed at the meeting. Based upon these reactions, the goals of Agenda 21, and a conceptual understanding of how stable formulas are generated, a range of options for the further development of an Agenda 21 proposal is derived. These options contain what may be a workable formula for Agenda 21 [...] one that can be debated and hopefully accepted by the national delegations. Finally, a set of next steps is presented. This working paper {{is the product of a}} larger study of issue and coalition dynamics in the <b>prenegotiation</b> phase of UNCED. Within that study, this paper serves the purpose of documenting and analyzing the development of a new and important issue for the PrepCom [...] the generation of a substantive formula for Agenda 21.
