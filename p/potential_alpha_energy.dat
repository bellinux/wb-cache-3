40|$|Inhalation of the {{short-lived}} radon decay products, 218 Po, 214 Pb, 214 Bi/ 214 Po, in homes, in the outdoor atmosphere and at work places yield {{the greatest amount}} of the natural radiation exposure of the human. In all dosimetric models the dominant parameter related to dose is the activity size distribution of the decay products in the air because the original deposition destination and amount of the inhaled activity deposited in lung depend on the particle size. For the determination of dose a relation between the <b>potential</b> <b>alpha</b> <b>energy</b> concentration of the radon progeny exposure (Cp t) and dose the so-called dose conversion factor (DCF = Dose/Cp t) is needed. Cp is the <b>potential</b> <b>alpha</b> <b>energy</b> concentration (PAEC) of {{the short-lived}} radon decay products, and t is the time of inhalation. In the estimation of the DCF by dose model calculations the activity size distribution in terms of <b>potential</b> <b>alpha</b> <b>energy</b> concentration is an important input parameter. For practical reasons related to measurements the relative activity size distribution should be divided into • relative size distribution of the unattached radon progeny, • relative size distribution of the radon progeny aerosol, • the unattached fraction in terms of <b>potential</b> <b>alpha</b> <b>energy</b> concentration (fp).

40|$|To better {{understand}} the physical behavior of thoron decay products in outdoor air at ground level, and the resulting exposuredose coefficient, measurements of the concentrations of thoron (""Rn) gas and its short-lived decay products ("" 0, ^I 2 Pb, ^I 2 Bi) in attached-to-aerosol and unattached states were carried out at a semi-arid field site in central New Mexico under varying atmospheric conditions. A high volume air sampler (100 L mid) with a single 635 mesh stainless steel screen (50 % penetration for 4 nm particles) and a glass fiber filter were employed. Analysis of the 105 outdoor measurements yielded the following average values: 9 Bq ma for the ""Rn activity concentration; 22 nJ ma for the concentration of <b>potential</b> <b>alpha</b> <b>energy,</b> 0. 03 for the equilibrium factor, 0. 15 for the unattached fraction of <b>potential</b> <b>alpha</b> <b>energy,</b> and 14 nSv h " for the effective dose rate. The activity concentration of thoron gas and the unattached fraction of <b>potential</b> <b>alpha</b> <b>energy</b> {{are similar to those}} of radon and its decay products at this site but the equilibrium factor and dose rate are smaller. The thoron decay products measurements are interpreted using the computer code TPOUT, which applies onedimensional eddy transport to calculate the vertical concentrations of ^Rn and its decay products as a function of atmospheric stability, aerosol concentration, terrain roughness, and surface wind speed. This code successfully predicted the observed trends of unattached and attached decay products concentrations with height and other factors. For example, die analysi...|$|E
40|$|Traditionally, {{assessments}} of the bronchial dose from radon progeny were carried out by measuring the unattached fraction (fp) of <b>potential</b> <b>alpha</b> <b>energy</b> concentration (PAEC), the total PAEC, activity median diameters (AMDs) and equilibrium factor, and then using dosimetric lung models. A breakthrough was proposed by Hopke et al. (1990) to use multiple metal wire screens to mimic the deposition properties of radon progeny in the nasal (N) and tracheobronchial (T-B) regions directly. In particular, they were successful in using four layers of 400 -mesh wire screens with a face velocity of 12 cm/s for the simulation of radon progeny deposition in the T-B region. Oberstedt and Vanmarcke (1995) carried out precise calibrations for the system, and named the system as the “bronchial dosimeter”. Based on these, Yu and Guan (1998) proposed a portable bronchial dosimeter similar to a normal measurement system for radon progeny or PAEC and consisted of only a single sampler and employed only one 400 -mesh wire screen and one filter. However, all these “bronchial dosimeters ” in fact only determined the fraction of <b>potential</b> <b>alpha</b> <b>energy</b> from radon progeny deposited in the T-B region, which required certain assumptions and calculations to further give the final bronchial dose.

40|$|Background: Decay {{products}} of radon and thoron present in indoor environment {{are the most}} important sources of radiation from natural sources which affect human beings, since general public spend at lest 80 % of their time in indoor. Materials and Methods: Air samples were collected for measuring the concentration of radon and thoron daughter products from various indoor environments during four different seasons of the year from the Gudalore taluk of Nilgiri Biosphere using high volume air sampler. The concentration of decay {{products of}} radon and thoron were estimated using an alpha counter. Results: Studies have revealed that the annual average <b>potential</b> <b>alpha</b> <b>energy</b> concentrations of radon and thoron progeny in dwellings of Gudalore were recorded as 3. 54 and 2. 65 mWL respectively. It was also observed that the <b>potential</b> <b>alpha</b> <b>energy</b> concentration (PAEC) values for radon progeny undergo dramatic change with the change of season perhaps due to different aerosol contents in the air. The maximum 222 Rn (3. 93 mWL) and 220 Rn (3. 10 mWL) progeny concentrations were observed during winter months and the minimum values (222 Rn 3. 14 mWL and 220 Rn 2. 20 mWL) were observed during summer. Conclusion: Studies have shown that the dwelling with mud wall registered high value of radon and thoron progenies (5. 49 mWL and 3. 88 mWL). While low values were observed in dwellings with vinyl floor. High concentrations of radon and thoron progeny were observed between 3. 00 to 5. 00 Hrs, while low values were observed at 14. 00 hrs. Studies suggest that radiation emission from radon and thoron daughter in the study area were remained well below the recommended level. Iran. J.   Radiat...|$|E

Data show that while filtration and electrostatic precipitation were effective in reducing total <b>potential</b> <b>alpha</b> <b>energy</b> concentrations (PAECs), they caused a greater percentage of the radon decay products, subsequently formed, to be unattached. This resulted in a substantial increase in the dose to the bronchial tissues. While enhanced convection removed both the attached and unattached decay products, its overall removal effectiveness was only 50 % to 60 %. The optimal form of treatment appears to be a combination of enhanced convection and nonuniform space charging.

The deposition velocity of unattached progeny was found to range from 3 to 5 m h- 1, being higher at increased air motion.

Radon- 222 progeny activity and <b>potential</b> <b>alpha</b> <b>energy</b> concentration appear affected by the airborne particle number concentration and size distribution. Particle number was up to 200 x 10 {sup 3 }/cm{sup 3 }. Only an accumulation mode (30 - 1000 nm) and some bimodal size distributions in this accumulation size range were significant. Diesel particles and combustion particles from burning propane caused a major modal diameter shift to a smaller size range (50 - 85 nm) compared with previous values (100 - 200 nm). The high particle number reduced the unattached progeny (0. 5 - 2 nm) to > 5 %. The nuclei mode (2 - 30 nm) in this test was nonexistent, and the coarse mode (> 1000 nm), except from the drilling areas and on the stopes, was mostly not measurable. Airborne particle total mass and long- lived radionuclide alpha activity concentrations were very low (80 - 100 {mu}g/m{sup 3 } and 4 - 5 mBq/m{sup 3 }) owing to high ventilation rates. Mass-weighted size distributions were trimodal, with the major mode at the accumulation size region, which accounts for 45 - 50 % of the mass. The coarse model contains the the least mass, about 20 %.

40|$|This review {{summarizes}} data on {{lung cancer}} risk from radon experimental studies performed by our group in France {{with emphasis on}} the most recent findings and analyses {{on the influence of}} dose-rate and that of fatal versus incidental tumors. A dose-effect relationship was established in rats, which was very similar for medium and high cumulative exposures, to that observed in uranium miners. At low cumulative exposures in the range of 0. 18 Jhm- 3 (50 WLM) to 0. 36 Jhm- 3 (100 WLM), the proportion of fatal lung cancer is about 80 % that of total lung cancers. In contrast, at cumulative exposures of 0. 72 Jhm- 3 (200 WLM) and higher, the proportion of fatal lung cancer is about half that of total lung cancers. The parameters that influence fatal lung cancer risk are cumulative exposure, <b>potential</b> <b>alpha</b> <b>energy</b> concentration (PAEC), exposure rate, and protraction of exposure. At high cumulative exposures up to 10. 8 Jhm- 3 (3, 000 WLM), an inverse dose-rate effect similar to that observed in uranium miners was also found in rats. The inverse exposure- rate effect was observed mainly at the highest exposure-rates. In contrast, our recent results indicate that at relatively low cumulative exposures of 0. 36 Jhm- 3 (100 WLM), comparable to lifetime exposures in high-radon houses or current underground mining exposures, the risk of lung cancer in rats decreases with decreasing PAEC, i. e., exposure rate. These data suggest that the induction of lung cancer results from a complex inter- play between cumulative exposure and exposure rate, with an optimal combination of these two parameters that results in a maximum risk of lung cancer induction. They support the hypothesis that, at low doses, the risk of lung cancer is governed by {{the rate at which the}} dose is delivered, and not by the total cumulative dose alone. These data are also consistent with those of underground uranium miners showing an inverse dose-rate effect at high cumulative exposures, but an attenuation of this effect at cumulative exposures lower than 0. 18 Jhm- 3 (50 WLM). They support both an inverse dose-rate effect at high cumulative exposures, as well as its attenuation or disappearance at low cumulative exposures...|$|E
