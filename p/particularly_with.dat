He also built many of the gates and fortifications in Cairo.|$|E
5|$|Biographer Mellow {{believes}} that In Our Time is Hemingway's most experimental book, <b>particularly</b> <b>with</b> its unusual narrative form.

5|$|A {{large portion}} of Clarke's music {{features}} the viola, as she was a professional performer for many years. Much of her output was written for herself and the all-female chamber ensembles she played in, including the Norah Clench Quartet, the English Ensemble, and the d'Aranyi Sisters. She also toured worldwide, <b>particularly</b> <b>with</b> cellist May Muklé. Her works were strongly influenced by several trends in 20th century classical music. Clarke also knew many leading composers of the day, including Bloch and Ravel, with whom her work has been compared.|$|E
5|$|Abovian saw in {{strengthening}} of the friendship of Russian and Armenian peoples a guarantee of the national, political and cultural revival of his native lands. However; when Abovian wrote the novel he was already disillusioned with Tsarist policies in Armenia, <b>particularly</b> <b>with</b> the implementation of Polozhenie (Statute) in 1836 which greatly reduced {{the political power of}} the Armenian Catholicos and the abolishment of the Armenian Oblast in 1840. In the novel, elements of romanticism and realism are interlaced while the narration is supplanted by lyrical retreats.|$|E
5|$|Ace, {{along with}} Ballantine Books, {{was one of}} the leading science fiction {{publishers}} for its first ten years of operation. With the death of owner A. A. Wyn in 1967, however, the company's fortunes began to decline. Two prominent editors, Donald A. Wollheim and Terry Carr, left in 1971, and in 1972 Ace was sold to Grosset & Dunlap. Despite financial troubles, there were further successes, <b>particularly</b> <b>with</b> the third Ace Science Fiction Specials series, for which Carr was the editor. Further mergers and acquisitions resulted in the company becoming a part of Berkley Books. Ace then became an imprint of Penguin Group (USA).|$|E

He started drinking, and relationships between him {{and the rest of the}} band became strained, <b>particularly</b> <b>with</b> Blackmore. On 6 November 1971, he collapsed with hepatitis while waiting to board a plane in Chicago, cancelling the remainder of a US tour.|$|E
5|$|Although {{sometimes}} {{regarded as}} foreign elements in Roman culture, {{music and dance}} had existed in Rome from earliest times. Music was customary at funerals, and the tibia (Greek aulos), a woodwind instrument, was played at sacrifices to ward off ill influences. Song (carmen) {{was an integral part}} of almost every social occasion. The Secular Ode of Horace, commissioned by Augustus, was performed publicly in 17 BC by a mixed children's choir. Music was thought to reflect the orderliness of the cosmos, and was associated <b>particularly</b> <b>with</b> mathematics and knowledge.|$|E
5|$|Although {{these are}} mainly {{mountain}} species with limited interactions with humans, the red-billed chough has a coastal {{population in the}} far west of its range, and has cultural connections <b>particularly</b> <b>with</b> Cornwall, where it appears on the Cornish Coat of Arms. A legend from that county says that King Arthur did not die but {{was transformed into a}} red-billed chough, and hence killing this bird was unlucky.|$|E

5|$|Churchmen such as Erasmus and Luther {{proposed}} {{reform to}} the Church, {{often based on}} humanist textual criticism of the New Testament. In October 1517 Luther published the 95 Theses, challenging papal authority and criticizing its perceived corruption, <b>particularly</b> <b>with</b> regard to instances of sold indulgences. The 95 Theses led to the Reformation, a break with the Roman Catholic Church that previously claimed hegemony in Western Europe. Humanism and the Renaissance therefore played a direct role in sparking the Reformation, {{as well as in}} many other contemporaneous religious debates and conflicts.|$|E

5|$|Examples of biologically {{important}} {{fatty acids}} include the eicosanoids, derived primarily from arachidonic acid and eicosapentaenoic acid, that include prostaglandins, leukotrienes, and thromboxanes. Docosahexaenoic acid {{is also important}} in biological systems, <b>particularly</b> <b>with</b> respect to sight. Other major lipid classes in the fatty acid category are the fatty esters and fatty amides. Fatty esters include important biochemical intermediates such as wax esters, fatty acid thioester coenzyme A derivatives, fatty acid thioester ACP derivatives and fatty acid carnitines. The fatty amides include N-acyl ethanolamines, such as the cannabinoid neurotransmitter anandamide.|$|E

5|$|Fatalities and {{injuries}} at this race {{proved to be}} a major turning point in both the 1994 season, and in the development of Formula One itself, <b>particularly</b> <b>with</b> regard to safety. The race weekend was marked by the deaths of Austrian driver Roland Ratzenberger and of three-time world champion Ayrton Senna in separate accidents. Other incidents saw driver Rubens Barrichello injured and several mechanics and spectators injured. In terms of driver fatalities, this was Formula One's darkest weekend since two drivers were killed at the 1960 Belgian Grand Prix.|$|E
5|$|Fuller, however, was {{confident}} {{in his work}} {{and the idea that}} the film would be strongly anti-racist, <b>particularly</b> <b>with</b> the changes he had made to the original work. The original novel's hate-filled Muslim black trainer, who had deliberately retrained the dog to attack white people, was converted into the character of Keys, who genuinely wished to cure the animal. Fuller also changed the novel's original ending into a more pessimistic film ending. The film was shot in only forty-five days at a cost of $7 million. Five white German Shepherd Dogs played the unnamed central character.|$|E
5|$|Goldschmidt {{was elected}} to the Portland City Council in 1970 and then as mayor of Portland in 1972, {{becoming}} the youngest mayor of any major American city. He promoted the revitalization of Downtown Portland and was influential on Portland-area transportation policy, <b>particularly</b> <b>with</b> the abandonment of the Mount Hood Freeway and the establishment of the MAX Light Rail. He was appointed U.S. Secretary of Transportation by President Jimmy Carter in 1979; in that capacity he worked to revive the ailing automobile industry and to deregulate several industries. He served until the end of Carter's presidency in 1981 and then served as a senior executive with Nike for several years.|$|E
