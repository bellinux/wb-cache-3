Experimental studies used nitrogen and carbon dioxide as the working fluids to show the effect of specific heat ratio. At ratios of nozzle pressure to ambient pressure ranging from 4 to 60 diversion efficiencies of 50 to 99 percent were produced. A one-dimensional analytic gas flow model was developed.

30|$|A {{similar study}} found safe values for most types of {{stripping}} procedures with metal handheld strippers and <b>perforated</b> stripping <b>disks</b> at low speed. However, the threshold value of 5.5 °C was reached in some cases, demonstrating {{the need for}} care during the procedure [15]. The greatest variation in recorded temperature during this study was 3.2 °C when using <b>perforated</b> stripping <b>disks</b> in molars, therefore, below the critical value. The explanation for greater temperature rise in the Baysal et al. [15] study {{is the fact that}} they have used 10 s on each surface to perform the stripping, while our study used 0.5 mm, independent of time. Drills of high speed require refrigeration and do not promote significant increase in the temperature of the pulp. However, in this study, only techniques that do not require refrigeration were used.|$|R

40|$|We {{study the}} {{evolution}} of the superconducting state in a <b>perforated</b> <b>disk</b> by varying the size of the hole. The superconducting properties are investigated by means of transport measurements around the superconducting/normal phase boundary Tc(H). A transition from a one-dimensional to a two-dimensional regime is seen when increasing the magnetic field for disks with small holes. A good agreement is found between the measured Tc(H) line and the calculations performed in the framework of the linearized Ginzburg-Landau theory. The effect of breaking the axial symmetry of the structure by moving the hole away {{from the center of the}} disk is also studied. An enhanced critical field is found for the asymmetric structures, possibly due to the recovery of the singly connected state. Comment: 12 pages, 9 figures, accpeted for publication in Phys.

40|$|Arthroscopic {{findings}} {{observed in}} the lateral and endaural approaches, and the subsequent dissections were compared in the upper joint compartments of 15 temporomandibular joints of 8 cadavers. Most of all arthroscopic findings to [S] synovial tissue degeneration, [Ar] articular fibrocartilage/disk surface degeneration, [Ad] adhesion and [P] <b>perforated</b> <b>disk</b> had good correspondence {{to the findings of}} dissections. The findings of [S] and [P] had high sensitivity (true positive rate 0. 89 ～ 1. 00) and high specificity (true negative rate 0. 92 ～ 1. 00), they had high diagnostic accuracis. The specificity (0. 75) of [Ar] was not high because of two false positives obtained from the enlarged images in arthroscopy compared with in dissections. This meant, however, arthroscopy was suitable for the precise diagnosis of IAt}. Tne sensitivity (0. 67) of [P] was not high because of a false negative obtained from that the adhesion of anterolateral synovial portion was not able to be found. This meant the visible fields depended on arthroscopic approaches to the temporomandibular joints. These data confirmed that arthroscopy was an effective method to investigate the condition of temporomandibular joints, especially in precise diagnosis. On the other hand, it was shown that there was a little area, anterolateral synovial portion by means of lateral and endaural approaches, not to visualize in arthroscopy...|$|E

The turbulence originating from this grid is studied by hot wire anemometry to see if there is a frequency for maximal response. Although no resonant enhancement of the turbulent kinetic energy or the dissipation rate is observed, the results for the two different sets of disks show that significant turbulent fluctuations are introduced mainly in the energy containing range and partially in the inertial sub range.

40|$|Symmetry-induced vortex-antivortex {{configurations}} in superconducting {{squares and}} triangles were predicted earlier; yet, {{they have not}} been resolved in experiment up to date. Namely, with vortex-antivortex states being highly unstable with respect to defects and temperature fluctuations, it is very unlikely that samples can be fabricated with the needed quality. Here we show how these drawbacks can be overcome by strategically placed nanoholes in the sample. As a result, (i) the actual shape of the sample becomes far less important, (ii) the stability of the vortex-antivortex configurations in general is substantially enhanced, and (iii) states comprising novel giant-antivortices (with higher winding numbers) become energetically favorable in <b>perforated</b> <b>disks.</b> In the analysis, we stress the potent of strong screening to destabilize the vortex-antivortex states. In turn, the screening-symmetry competition favors stabilization of new asymmetric ground states, which arise for small values of the effective Ginzburg-Landau parameter kappa.

40|$|A compact active grid is {{developed}} with which a pipe flow can be stirred {{in order to}} enhance the turbulence. The active grid is composed of a stationary and a rotating disk with characteristic hole patterns. This active grid is placed inside the pipe, allowing flow to pass through it. With only one moving part, the design is much less complicated than current active grids. Several combinations of <b>perforated</b> <b>disks</b> are investigated, and the resulting control over the turbulent intensity and spectral energy distribution is quantified over a wide range of rotation frequencies. We find that significant turbulent fluctuations are introduced mainly in the energy-containing range and partially also in the inertial subrange. These additional fluctuations represent up to 25 % of the total energy and are not caused by pulsations of the mean flow. The compact active grid will be of use where efficient mixing in limited space is required and in applications when the introduction of specific lengthscales is desirable, such as in premixed burners...|$|R

40|$|The {{results of}} a {{detailed}} experimental investigation of the near-wake (up to seven turbine diameters downstream) of a model horizontal axis tidal turbine (HATT) device in a large-scale recirculating water channel facility are reported. An Acoustic Doppler Velocimeter is used to provide detailed threedimensional mean and turbulent flow field information at five different depths across the full width of the channel downstream of the turbine, giving the most complete three-dimensional velocities and Reynolds normal and shear stress data set yet available. In addition the Reynolds-stress anisotropy tensor is used to illustrate the degree of anisotropy of the Reynolds stress within the turbine’s wake. These results reveal the strongly anisotropic nature of the near-wake turbulence suggesting isotropic turbulence models {{should not be used}} to model near-wake dynamics. Finally the power-law decay rates of the maximum normalised turbulent kinetic energy differ significantly from those found downstream of grids, meshes or <b>perforated</b> <b>disks,</b> suggesting that previous modelling approaches, which neglected swirl effects and modelled the turbine by absorption discs, may significantly over predict the turbulent kinetic energy decay rate of HATT wakes...|$|R

This fact contradicts what was expected; the thickness of the enamel and the dentin of molars did not prevent them from suffering temperature increase. One possible explanation for this finding would be due to the higher buccal-lingual volume of the enamel found in molars, requiring greater amount of time for removal of the same tissue thickness.|$|R

The terms 'sejunction' and 'funicular' and 'pendular' water were discussed. Their importance was demonstrated by a series of model experiments with sand fractions of different size grades. The distribution functions for the pores of these sands were calculated and compared with the experimental results.

40|$|ABSTRACT: This work {{objectified}} {{to evaluate}} the efficiency of two meter mechanism of corn seeds when submitted to different forward speed and soil management system during the non-tillage seeding. It was used a factorial design in randomized blocks. The factors whose effects were examined {{were related to the}} seeders with pneumatic and horizontal disk meter mechanisms for the distribution of the seeds, to the set tractor-seeder forward speeds (4. 4; 8. 0 and 9. 8 km h- 1), and to the soil management system considering the corn no-tillage seeding over minimum tillage with chisel plow and the no-tillage system for the seeding of oat culture (Avena strigosa Schreb). It was verified that the forward speed didn't influence the initial and final stands of plants but it interfered in the regularity of longitudinal distribution of plants. The smallest speed provided the largest percentile of normal spacing between plants. The pneumatic meter mechanism presented better performance than the horizontal <b>disk</b> <b>perforated</b> in the longitudinal distribution of plants.

50|$|The main {{difference}} between DCCC {{and other types}} of countercurrent chromatography techniques {{is that there is no}} vigorous mixing of phases to enhance the mass transfer of compounds that allows them to distribute between the two phases. In 1951 Kies and Davis described an apparatus similar to the DCCC. They created a series of open tubes that were arranged in a cascade to either drip a more dense phase through an less dense stationary phase or, conversely, a less dense phase could be introduced into the bottom of the tube to dribble through the more dense phase. In 1954, a fractionation column was introduced by Kepes the resembled a CCC column divided into chambers with <b>perforated</b> plastic <b>disks.</b> Similar DCCC-type instruments have been created by A. E. Kostanyan and collaborators which employ vertical columns that are divided into partitions with porous disks. Once the columns are filled with stationary phase, the mobile phase is pumped through, not continuously but, in pulses. The solvent motion created by a pulsed pumping action creates the mixing and settling that is common to most all forms of countercurrent chromatography.|$|R
