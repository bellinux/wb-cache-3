5|$|After {{a period}} of air-to-air {{exercises}} and practice the Wing undertook a Circus operation on 3 August 1941. In the evening the Wing crossed out over Manston at 18,000ft and then dropped to 13,000ft over the coast at Gravelines and set course for Saint Omer. Near Ambleteuse five Bf 109Fs were sighted one thousand feet above and in front travelling past the Spitfires. The German fighters shadowed the flight before three detached and dived to attack, curving in from behind. The Spitfires turned into them. Finucane missed with his first burst of fire and chased the leading Bf 109 into cloud while following the Bf 109's condensation trail. Hitting the enemy with another burst from 200 yards the Bf 109 burst into flames. He sighted another formation of 18 Bf 109s above and climbed to attack supported by six Spitfires. Finucane scored hits on the tail unit of one which went down vertically and into a cloud layer at 2,000ft at which <b>point</b> <b>contact</b> was lost. Finucane claimed one destroyed and one probably destroyed. The operation elevated his tally to 7. The day was best remembered in Fighter Command {{for the loss of}} Flight Lieutenant Eric Lock who was shot down by ground-fire in the morning patrol.|$|E

25|$|There {{are several}} {{different}} ways of fabricating a QPC. It can be realized in a break-junction by pulling apart a piece of conductor until it breaks.

By applying a voltage to suitably shaped gate electrodes, the electron gas can be locally depleted and {{many different types of}} conducting regions can be created in the plane of the 2DEG, among them quantum dots and quantum point contacts. Another means of creating a QPC is by positioning the tip of a scanning tunneling microscope close to the surface of a conductor.|$|E

500|$|John Northrup Shive (February 22, 1913 [...] June 1, 1984) was an American {{physicist}} and inventor. [...] He made notable contributions in electronic engineering and solid-state physics {{during the early}} days of transistor development at Bell Laboratories. [...] In particular, he produced experimental evidence that holes could diffuse through bulk germanium, and not just along the surface as previously thought. This paved the way from Bardeen and Brattain's <b>point</b> <b>contact</b> transistor to Shockley's more-robust junction transistor. Shive is best known for inventing the phototransistor in 1948 (a device that combines the sensitivity to light of a photodiode and the current gain of a transistor), and for the Shive wave machine in 1959 (an educational apparatus used to illustrate wave motion).|$|E
500|$|On January 30, 1948 Shive {{discovered}} that gold-plated tungsten point contacts on a p-type layer of germanium grown on an n-type substrate gave [...] "a terrific triode effect".

[...] He leveraged this discovery to build a <b>point</b> <b>contact</b> transistor with bronze contacts on the front and back of thin wedge of germanium, proving that holes could diffuse through bulk germanium and not just along the surface as previously thought. This confirmed William Shockley's idea that {{it should be possible to}} build a junction transistor, an idea that hitherto he had kept secret from the rest of the team.

These clean quantum <b>point</b> <b>contacts</b> indeed show transport features that are obscured by disorder in standard samples.

40|$|A Weyl {{semimetal}} is a topologically non-trivial {{phase of}} matter that hosts mass-less Weyl fermions, the particles that remained elusive {{for more than}} 80 years since their theoretical discovery. The Weyl semimetals exhibit unique transport and magneto-transport properties and remarkably high surface spin polarization. Here we show that a unique mesoscopic superconducting phase with a critical temperature up to 7 K can be realized by forming metallic <b>point</b> <b>contacts</b> with silver (Ag) on single crystals of TaAs, while neither Ag nor TaAs are superconductors. The Andreev reflection spectra obtained from such <b>point</b> <b>contacts</b> are fitted well within a modified Blonder-Tinkham-Klapwijk (BTK) model with a superconducting energy gap up to 1. 2 meV. The analysis within this model also reveals high transport spin polarization up to 60 % indicating a spin polarized supercurrent flowing through the <b>point</b> <b>contacts</b> on TaAs. Such <b>point</b> <b>contacts</b> also show a large anisotropic magnetoresistance (AMR) originating from the spin polarized current. Therefore, apart from {{the discovery of a}} novel mesoscopic superconducting phase and it's coexistence with a large spin polarization, our results also show that the <b>point</b> <b>contacts</b> on Weyl semimetals are potentially important for applications in spintronics.

40|$|As {{developing}} or regenerating neurons grow, their axons seek cues in the {{extracellular matrix}} that are recognized by integrin receptors. To understand the regulation {{and structure of}} neural integrin complexes, we have examined the association of two functionally important integrins, al@ 1 and a 3 B 1, within PC 1 2 cells. Detergent-resistant cytoskeletal ghosts were prepared from PC 12 cells and examined by immunoblotting. In cells maintained in suspension the al, a 3, and @l integrin subunits were solubilized by Triton X- 100 detergent. In contrast, when cells were grown on collagen or laminin about 50 % of the al and 01 subunits were retained with the cytoskeleton, but a 3 remained soluble. Confocal immunofluorescence microscopy of whole cells demonstrated that all three integrin subunits were expressed in a punctate pattern on the cell surface in <b>point</b> <b>contacts.</b> <b>Point</b> <b>contacts</b> were also {{found to be the}} predominant adhesion structure of dorsal root ganglion neurons. After detergent extraction of PC 12 cells, the <b>point</b> <b>contacts</b> remained only at the cell-substrate interface.

2500|$|Shockley, {{angered by}} not being {{included}} on the patent applications, secretly continued his own work to build {{a different sort of}} transistor based on junctions instead of point contacts; he expected this kind of design {{would be more likely to}} be commercially viable. The <b>point</b> <b>contact</b> transistor, he believed, would prove to be fragile and difficult to manufacture. Shockley was also dissatisfied with certain parts of the explanation for how the <b>point</b> <b>contact</b> transistor worked and conceived of the possibility of minority carrier injection. On February 13, 1948 another team member, John N. Shive, built a <b>point</b> <b>contact</b> transistor with bronze contacts on the front and back of thin wedge of germanium, proving that holes could diffuse through bulk germanium and not just along the surface as previously thought. Shive's invention sparked Shockley's invention of the junction transistor. A few months later he invented an entirely new, considerably more robust, type of transistor with a layer or 'sandwich' structure. This structure went on to be used for the vast majority of all transistors into the 1960s, and evolved into the bipolar junction transistor. Shockley later admitted that the workings of the team were [...] "mixture of cooperation and competition." [...] He also admitted that he kept some of his own work secret until his [...] "hand was forced" [...] by Shive's 1948 advance.
