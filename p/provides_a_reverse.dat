40|$|Abstract. The laser {{forming process}} {{is one of}} the last {{technologies}} on forming of sheet metals with laser beam heat distribution. In this process laser beam moves across the top surface of the sheet metal and the heated zone expands and causes a great moment that deforms the sheet metal. Subsequently, the heated zone gets cooled and <b>provides</b> <b>a</b> <b>reverse</b> strain and moment. The final bending angle is a combination of two phases. Due to the complexity of the process, it is studied with different approaches; FEM analysis and analytical as well as empirical methods. The laser forming is a sensible process regarding the material properties. Also, because of the temperature change during the process, it is important to use a temperature dependent model. In this study The FEM model is proposed for simulation of the mechanism. Based on the simulation results, an integrated analytical model is then developed by a new elasto-plastic material model considering linear strain hardening, combined with the temperature dependent mechanical and physical properties. In addition, the temperature dependent tangential modulus is used instead of the yield point of the material to improve accuracy in the plastic deformation phase. Finally, the analytical model is compared with the FEM standard code, which showed a great conformity. Historical Revie...|$|E
40|$|Over {{the last}} 40 years {{manufacturing}} industry {{has enjoyed a}} rapid growth {{with the support of}} various computer-aided systems (CAD, CAPP, CAM etc.) known as CAx. Since the first Numerically Controlled (NC) machine appeared in 1952, there have been many advances in CAx resource capabilities. The information integration and interoperability between different manufacturing resources has become an important and popular research area over the last decade. Computer Numerically Controlled (CNC) machines are an important link in the manufacturing chain and the major contributor to the production capacity of manufacturing industry today. However, most of the research has focused on the information integration of upper systems in the CAD/CAPP /CAM/CNC manufacturing chain, leaving the shop floor as an isolated information island. In particular, there is limited opportunity to capture and feed shopfloor knowledge back to the upper systems. Furthermore, the part programs for the machines are not exchangeable due to the. machine specific postprocessors. Thus there is a further need to consider information interoperability between different CNC machine and other systems. This research investigates the reverse transformation of the CNC part programmes into higher level of process information, entitled process comprehension, to enable the shopfloor interoperability. A novel framework of universal process comprehension is specified and designed. The framework <b>provides</b> <b>a</b> <b>reverse</b> direction of information flow from the CNC machine to upper CAx systems, enabling the interoperability and recycling of the shopfloor knowledge. A prototype implementation of the framework is realised and utilised to demonstrate the functionalities through three industrially inspired test components. The major contribution of this research to knowledge is the new vision of the shopfloor interoperability associated with process knowledge capture and reuse. The research shows that process comprehension of part programmes can provide an effective solution to the issues of the shopfloor interoperability and knowledge reuse in manufacturing industries.

40|$|Assessment {{of reward}} {{responsiveness}} in the response bias probabilistic reward task in rats: implications for cross-species translational research A Der-Avakian 1, 3, MS D’Souza 1, 3, DA Pizzagalli 2, 4 and A Markou 1, 4 Mood disorders, such as major depressive disorder, {{are characterized by}} abnormal reward responsiveness. The Response Bias Probabilistic Reward Task (hereafter referred to as probabilistic reward task (PRT)) quantifies reward responsiveness in human subjects, and an equivalent animal assessment is needed to facilitate preclinical translational research. Thus, {{the goals of the}} present studies were to develop, validate and characterize a rat analog of the PRT. Adult male Wistar and Long–Evans rats were trained in operant testing chambers to discriminate between two tone stimuli that varied in duration (0. 5 and 2 s). During a subsequent test session consisting of 100 trials, the two tones were made ambiguous (0. 9 and 1. 6 s) and correct identification of one tone was reinforced with a food pellet three times more frequently than the other tone. In subsequent experiments, Wistar rats were administered either a low dose of the dopamine D 2 /D 3 receptor agonist pramipexole (0. 1 mg kg 1, subcutaneous) or the psychostimulant amphetamine (0. 5 mg kg 1, intraperitoneal) before the test session. Similar to human subjects, both rat strains developed a response bias toward the more frequently reinforced stimulus, reflecting robust reward responsiveness. Mirroring prior findings in humans, a low dose of pramipexole blunted response bias. Moreover, in rats, amphetamine potentiated response bias. These results indicate that in rats, reward responsiveness can be quantified and bidirectionally modulated by pharmacological manipulations that alter striatal dopamine transmission. Thus, this new procedure in rats, which is conceptually and procedurally analogous to the one used in humans, <b>provides</b> <b>a</b> <b>reverse</b> translational platform to investigate abnormal reward responsiveness across species...|$|E

40|$|Chris Priestley’s 2011 novel, Mister Creecher, {{promises}} to show ‘the {{making of a}} monster [...] . ’ Set in 1818, the novel is a metafictional rewriting of Mary Shelley’s Frankenstein (1818), imagining the monster’s journey as he tracks his creator to Scotland. In this version, the monster is aided by London pickpocket, Billy, whose provenance, the early novels of Charles Dickens, suggests further intertexts for this contemporary novel. It is Billy, rather than the eponymous ‘Creecher’, who is the novel’s protagonist: a sentimentalized, suffering Dickensian child, whose narrative is reconfigured through encounters with Shelley’s gothic novel {{and a range of}} other intertexts. Through Billy, Mister Creecher (2011) re-imagines Dickens’ children and the Dickensian bildungsroman, reconfiguring the positions of villain and innocent. Neo-Victorian texts have been characterized by a doubled relationship to their intertexts, a relationship that is parasitic on the one hand, revisiting the traumas of a past reconstructed as barbaric, and redemptive on the other hand, since these reconstructions are usually aimed at a revisionist critique. In the case of Mister Creecher (2011) the parasitic relationship of contemporary metafiction to past gothic and Victorian works {{is a part of the}} novel’s active intertextual fabric. This is a novel that explores how intertextuality itself functions as a corrupting parasite, problematizing and infecting any future encounter with back-grounded works. The introduction of Shelley’s creation into Dickens’ landscape is a wilfully contradictory gesture. On one hand, the doubling of Billy with Shelley’s monster <b>provides</b> <b>a</b> <b>reverse</b> bildungsroman, an account of villainy as social rather than simply essential or sensational, with reference to notions of family and childhood relevant in the contemporary moment. On the other hand, the monster’s invasion of Dickensian London is an aggressive act of gothic contagion or colonization, one akin to that imagined by Frankenstein himself in his fear that he has loosed ‘a race of devils … upon the earth, who might make the very existence of the species of man a condition precarious and full of terror’...|$|E
40|$|Reverse {{execution}} can {{be defined}} as a method which recovers the states that a program attains during its execution. Therefore, reverse execution eliminates the need for repetitive program restarts every time a bug location is missed. This potentially shortens debug time considerably. This thesis presents a new approach which, {{for the first time ever}} (to the best of the author's knowledge), achieves reverse execution at the assembly instruction level on general purpose processors via execution of a reverse program. A reverse program almost always regenerates destroyed states rather than restoring them from a record. Furthermore, a reverse program provides assembly instruction by assembly instruction execution in the backward direction. This significantly reduces state saving and thus decreases the associated memory and time costs of reverse execution support. Furthermore, this thesis presents a new dynamic slicing algorithm that is built on top of assembly instruction level reverse execution. Dynamic slicing is a technique which isolates the code parts that influence an erroneous variable at a program point. The algorithm presented in this thesis achieves dynamic slicing via execution of a reduced reverse program. A reduced reverse program is obtained from a full reverse program by omitting the instructions that recover states irrelevant to the dynamic slice under consideration. This <b>provides</b> <b>a</b> <b>reverse</b> execution capability along a designated dynamic slice only. The use of a reduced reverse program for dynamic slicing removes the need for runtime execution trajectories. The methodology of this thesis has been implemented on a PowerPC processor with a custom made debugger. As compared to previous work, all of which heavily use state saving techniques, the experimental results show up to 2206 X reduction in runtime memory usage, up to 403 X reduction in forward execution time overhead and up to 2. 32 X reduction in forward execution time for the tested benchmarks. Measurements on the selected benchmarks also indicate that the dynamic slicing method presented in this thesis can achieve up to six orders of magnitude (1, 928, 500 X) speedups in reverse execution along the dynamic slice as compared to full-scale reverse execution.

40|$|This paper-based thesis {{attempts}} {{to answer the}} question how the adoption and diffusion of RFID can be balanced successfully between technological innovation and regulation by law. To answer this question, an abductive reasoning perspective has been applied. The first premise of abduction includes four sets of observations presented in four articles; the second premise of abduction includes two hypothetical claims, and the third premise of abduction builds the case, i. e., concludes the thesis. As first step, the definitional framework is established. Ten theories of adoption and diffusion of technological innovation (TRA, TPB, MPCU, SCT, TAM, TAM 2, C-TAM-TPB, IDT, PCI, and UTAUT) and their characteristics are investigated. They frame the technological viewpoint. Then, the reasons for regulation (public interest theory, private interest theory, and institutionalist theory) as well as the means of regulation (regulation by law, norms, market, and architecture) and their application are investigated. They frame the regulatory viewpoint. As second step, four observations are made that constitute the first premise of abduction based on the findings of four individual research articles referred to as the Database Article, Marketing Article, Modality Mix Article, and Survey Article: Database Article: This research article evaluates the strategic advantage of placing RFID databases in certain territorial and jurisdictional regions based on database regulation. The analysis of the database regulation by law in Europe and North America revealed that, based on the creativity, skill and judgement, and investment doctrine, they do not protect RFID data in databases. It is claimed that protection of RFID data in databases should be regulated by other means of regulation, for instance, by regulation by norms or architecture. Observation 1 stipulates: Despite the amount of data anticipated to be stored and the regulation by law in the different countries where RFID is adopted and diffused, the location of the databases containing RFID data does not seem {{to play an important role}} for the technological innovator. Marketing Article: This research article applies a legal use case for the technological innovations marketed by the industry as active RFID tags. The analysis of the RFID industry’s marketing efforts and the unfavourable regulation by law is possible, and likely. Adopting the broad legal interpretation of self-emitting devices (short-range devices) to RFID tags that need to transduce energy from an RFID reader (active RFID tags) might allow the search and seizure of transmitted RFID data without a warrant to be in line with the constitutional rights. It is claimed that within the RFID industry there should be more awareness of regulation by legislation and adjudication. Observation 2 stipulates: Extending the doctrinal definition of active RFID tags to include reader-independent and indiscriminate signalling might lead to unfavourable regulation by law. Modality Mix Article: This research article offers a reflection on how law must manage the evolution of technological innovation. The analysis of the Draft Recommendation (2008) by the European Commission shows that the focus on regulation by law is inappropriate for a manageable diffusion of RFID technology. An over-regulation of RFID technology by regulation by law is possible if the Draft Recommendation (2008) is implemented and comes into force. It is claimed that a more diverse set of modalities (regulation by norms, market, and architecture) is necessary to successfully regulate RFID technology. Observation 3 stipulates: The current adoption and diffusion of RFID technology do not seem to be following an appropriate mix of regulation. Survey Article: This research article <b>provides</b> <b>a</b> <b>reverse</b> perspective of current RFID issues by examining the RFID industry’s view of regulation by law and consumers. The analysis of the survey data of the RFID industry shows three shortcomings by the RFID industry in its engagement of legal experts, its knowledge of regulation by law for RFID subject-matter, and its information policy to the general public. It is claimed that the exchange between the RFID industry and the legal regulator needs to improve. Observation 4 stipulates: The interaction between, and consequently also the exchange of expert know-how and standpoints of, (i) the RFID industry and the legal regulator and (ii) the RFID industry and the consumers seem insufficient. As third step, two hypothetical claims are made as second premise of abduction based on a literature review of characteristics of adoption and diffusion of technological innovation in IS research, namely IT, EDI, and RFID. First, the research shows that in IS research there are only a few regulation-by-law characteristics (5 of 150 different characteristics). Thus, a first hypothetical claim is made that in IS research there is a lack of legal perspectives. Second, the research shows that in IS research there are even fewer characteristics of other regulatory means, such as for example, social norms, market or architecture. Thus a second hypothetical claim is made that in IS research there is a lack of diversity in regulation of technological innovation. Finally, a case is built as third premise of abduction. It seems possible to conclude that (i) based on observation 1 and hypothetical claim 2, increasing the diversity of regulation modalities might have a positive effect on the strategic management decisions for the location of RFID systems; (ii) based on observation 2 and hypothetical claim 1, increasing the legal perspective in IS research might have a positive effect on the RFID industry’s marketing strategy; (iii) based on observation 3 and hypothetical claim 2, a more thorough and precise review of essential regulation by law is necessary; and (iv) based on observation 4 and hypothetical claim 1, increasing the legal perspective in IS research might have a positive effect on the RFID industry’s awareness of the legal challenges and their consequences. It is suggested that the four cases (conclusions) built in this thesis provide a solid foundation for the following four hypotheses that can be further tested with additional empirical data: 1. Increasing the diversity of regulation modalities has a positive effect on the strategic management decisions for the deployment location of technological innovation. 2. Increasing the legal perspective in IS research has a positive effect on the marketing strategy for technological innovation. 3. Increasing the thoroughness and precision in the review of essential regulation by law has a positive effect on other regulatory tools for technological innovation. 4. Increasing the legal perspective in IS research has a positive effect on the industry’s awareness of the legal challenges and their consequences. Therefore, to prevent bits from falling once they have learned to walk, the legal perspective of regulation in IS research as well as the diverse implementation of regulation in IS research should probably be increased. Such an increase might augment the awareness for the potential of regulation in technological innovation, which, in turn, might foster the adoption and diffusion of RFID...|$|E

Multicast greatly improves the network efficiency to distribute data to multiple recipients {{as compared to}} multiple unicast sessions of the same data to each receiver individually, {{by taking advantage of}} the shared nature of the wireless medium. However it is difficult to guarantee the reception reliability of multiple multicast/broadcast recipients because the wireless medium is error prone and each receiver experiences different channel conditions. An additional difficulty is that mul-ticast/broadcast services in many networks such as 3 G multimedia multicast services do not <b>provide</b> <b>a</b> <b>reverse</b> communications channel for the receivers to request the retransmission of lost data packets.

Further, VinEd extends {{the notion of a}} view to any activity that can be based on the original program, e. g., program compilation, or version control functions. Thus VinEd can be extended to form a complete programming environment. In this paper, we consider the role of program views in the programming tasks and look at the way views are supported by current systems. We then describe the salient properties of VinEd from the user's point of view, and present examples of views that help in program comprehension as well as of views that take care of software engineering activities. Finally, we discuss the most important implementation issues of VinEd, and analyze its performance...|$|R

They <b>provide</b> <b>a</b> remedy that <b>reverses</b> all transactions when a fraudulent use has occurred, or when there is a violation of the contract terms. However this method has limitations; it offers one single remedy (the return of the payment), and not all disputes imply a breach of contract or fraud.|$|R

Our proposed clinical decision support framework <b>provides</b> <b>a</b> foundation for future clinical decision support systems to follow a multi-layered clinical decision support framework approach by learning from evidence-based/data driven legacy clinical data. Learning from legacy clinical data activity, <b>provides</b> <b>an</b> opportunity to <b>reverse</b> engineer existing clinical workflows, in order to remove redundant clinical pathways thereby providing clinicians recommendations/suggestions to refine clinical workflows.|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe {{manipulation}} of the posttranscriptional gene silencing phenomenon known as RNA interference (RNAi), demonstrated {{more than a decade}} ago in the genetic model systems Caenorhabditis elegans Maupas (Fire et al., 1998) and Drosophila melanogaster Meigen (Kennerdell and Carthew, 1998), has <b>provided</b> <b>a</b> powerful <b>reverse</b> genetic tool for the elucidation of gene function. Since its discovery, myriad reports have been published describing efforts to apply RNAi approaches in insect species lacking well developed genetics or characterized genomes. Here we review recent progress in this area, focusing in particular on several recent landmark studies that demonstrate the potential practical value of this gene silencing technique for the development of new tools for the management of insect pests of agriculture...|$|R
40|$|RNA {{interference}} (RNAi) <b>provides</b> <b>a</b> powerful <b>reverse</b> genetics {{approach to}} analyze gene func-tions both in tissue culture and in vivo. Because of its widespread applicability and effective-ness {{it has become}} {{an essential part of the}} tool box kits of model organisms such as Caenorhabditis elegans, Drosophila, and the mouse. In addition, the use of RNAi in animals in which genetic tools are either poorly developed or nonexistent enables a myriad of funda-mental questions to be asked. Here,we review themethods and applications of in vivoRNAi to characterize gene functions in model organisms and discuss their impact to the studyof devel-opmental as well as evolutionary questions. Further, we discuss the applications of RNAi tech-nologies to crop improvement, pest control and RNAi therapeutics, thus <b>providing</b> <b>an</b> appreciation of the potential for phenomenal applications of RNAi to agriculture and medicine.
