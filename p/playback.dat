40|$|International audienceDifferent <b>playbacks</b> {{have been}} {{proposed}} to synthesize the dynamical information of the vocal folds. However most of them rely on the delineation of the glottal gap using segmentation techniques which isa complex task and usually requires a manual supervision. In order to solve this issue, three new <b>playbacks</b> based on the optical flow computation are presented. Two of them, called Optical Flow Glottovibrogram and Glottal Optical Flow Waveform, analyze the global dynamics; and the remaining one, called Optical Flow Kymogram, analyzes the local dynamics. The reliability of the proposed <b>playbacks</b> is evaluated by comparison with traditional representations, showing a great correlation in shape with the traditional <b>playbacks,</b> and allowing {{the identification of the}} most important instants of time, such as closed-states and maximal opening. In addition, they provide complementary information to the common spatio-temporal representations, although the new <b>playbacks</b> are lightly blurre...|$|R

40|$|International audiencePlaybacks are {{a useful}} tool for {{conducting}} well-controlled and replicated experiments on the effects of anthropogenic noise, particularly for repeated exposures. However, <b>playbacks</b> are unlikely to fully reproduce original sources of anthropogenic noise. Here we examined the sound pressure and particle acceleration of boat noise <b>playbacks</b> in a field experiment and reveal that although there remain recognized limitations, the signal-to-noise ratios of boat <b>playbacks</b> to ambient noise do not exceed those of a real boat.

5|$|Professional audio subwoofers used in rock {{concerts in}} stadiums, DJ {{performances}} at dance music (e.g., EDM) and similar events must {{be capable of}} very high bass output levels, at very low frequencies, with low distortion. This {{is reflected in the}} design attention given in the 2010s to the subwoofer applications for sound reinforcement, public address systems, dance club systems and concert systems. Consumer applications (as in home use) are considerably less demanding due to much smaller listening space and lower <b>playback</b> levels. Subwoofers are now almost universal in professional sound applications such as live concert sound, churches, nightclubs, and theme parks. Movie theatres certified to the THX standard for <b>playback</b> always include high capability subwoofers. Some professional applications require subwoofers designed for very high sound levels, using multiple 12-, 15-, 18- or 21-inch drivers (30cm, 40cm, 45cm, 53cm respectively). Drivers as small as 10-inch (25cm) are occasionally used, generally in horn-loaded enclosures.|$|E
40|$|Unlike {{the smaller}} and more {{vulnerable}} mammals, African elephants have relatively few predators that threaten their survival. The sound of disturbed African honeybees Apis meliffera scutellata causes African elephants Loxodonta africana to retreat and produce warning vocalizations that lead other elephants to join the flight. In our first experiment, audio <b>playbacks</b> of bee sounds induced elephants to retreat and elicited more head-shaking and dusting, reactive behaviors that may prevent bee stings, compared to white noise control <b>playbacks.</b> Most importantly, elephants produced distinctive "rumble" vocalizations in response to bee sounds. These rumbles exhibited an upward shift in the second formant location, which implies active vocal tract modulation, compared to rumbles made in response to white noise <b>playbacks.</b> In a second experiment, audio <b>playbacks</b> of these rumbles produced in response to bees elicited headshaking, and further and faster retreat behavior in other elephants, compared to control rumble <b>playbacks</b> with lower second formant frequencies. These responses to the bee rumble stimuli occurred {{in the absence of}} any bees or bee sounds. This suggests that these elephant rumbles may function as referntial signals, in which a formant frequency shift alerts nearby elephants about an external threat, in this case, the threat of bees.
