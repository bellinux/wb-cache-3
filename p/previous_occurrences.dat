2500|$|Some Theravadins such as David Kalupahana, see Nagarjuna's view of {{emptiness}} as {{compatible with the}} Pali Canon. In {{his analysis of the}} Mulamadhyamikakarika, Kalupahana sees Nagarjuna's argument as rooted in the Kaccānagotta Sutta (which Nagarjuna cites by name). Kalupahana states that Nagarjuna's major goal was to discredit heterodox views of Svabhava (own-nature) held by the Sarvastivadins and establish the non-substantiality of all dharmas. According to Peter Harvey, the Abhidhamma theory of the Theravadins is not based on the kind of Svabhava that Nagarjuna was critiquing: [...] "They are dhammas because they are upheld by conditions or they are upheld according to their own nature' (Asl.39). Here 'own-nature' would mean characteristic nature, which is not something inherent in a dhamma as a separate ultimate reality, but arise due to the supporting conditions both of other dhammas and <b>previous</b> <b>occurrences</b> of that dhamma. This is of significance as it makes the Mahayana critique of the Sarvastivadin's notion of own-nature largely irrelevant to the Theravada." ...|$|E
60|$|You {{may well}} {{believe that we}} had plenty of matter for talk now, since the raiding of our village seemed by long odds the {{greatest}} event that had really ever occurred in the world; for although these dull peasants may have thought they recognized the bigness {{of some of the}} <b>previous</b> <b>occurrences</b> that had filtered from the world's history dimly into their minds, the truth is that they hadn't. One biting little fact, visible to their eyes of flesh and felt in their own personal vitals, became at once more prodigious to them than the grandest remote episode in the world's history which they had got at second hand and by hearsay. It amuses me now when I recall how our elders talked then. They fumed and fretted in a fine fashion.|$|E
60|$|In {{spite of}} the gaiety of the court of King Edward a cloud hung over the kingdom; for it was {{threatened}} by a danger far more terrible than any combination of foes--a danger which no gallantry upon the part of her king or warriors availed anything. With a slow and terrible march the enemy was advancing from the East, where countless hosts had been slain. India, Arabia, Syria, and Armenia had been well-nigh depopulated. In no country which the dread foe had invaded had less {{than two-thirds of the}} population been slain; in some nine-tenths had perished. All sorts of portents were reported to have accompanied its appearance in the East; where it was said showers of serpents had fallen, strange and unknown insects had appeared in the atmosphere, and clouds of sulphurous vapour had issued from the earth and enveloped whole provinces and countries. For two or three years the appearance of this scourge had been heralded by strange atmospheric disturbances; heavy rains and unusual floods, storms of thunder and lightning of unheard-of violence, hail-showers of unparalleled duration and severity, had everywhere been experienced, while in Italy and Germany violent earthquake shocks had been felt, and that at places where no tradition existed of <b>previous</b> <b>occurrences</b> of the same kind.|$|E

60|$|The Queen {{meanwhile}} {{was surprised}} (June 10) that Mr. Gladstone should make his defeat a vital question, and asked whether, in case Lord Salisbury should be unwilling {{to form a}} government, the cabinet would remain. To this Mr. Gladstone replied that to treat otherwise {{an attack on the}} budget, made by an ex-cabinet minister with such breadth of front and after all the <b>previous</b> <b>occurrences</b> of the session, would be contrary to every precedent,—for instance, the notable case of December 1852,—and it would undoubtedly tend to weaken and lower parliamentary government.(125) If an opposition defeated a government, they must be prepared to accept the responsibility of their action. As to the second question, he answered that a refusal by Lord Salisbury would obviously change the situation. On this, the Queen accepted the resignations (June 11), and summoned Lord Salisbury to Balmoral. The resignations were announced to parliament the next day. Remarks were made at the time, indeed by the Queen herself, at the failure of Mr. Gladstone to seek the royal presence. Mr. Gladstone’s explanation was that, viewing “the probably long reach of Lord Hartington’s life into the future,” he thought that he would be more useful in conversation with her Majesty than “one whose ideas might be unconsciously coloured by the limited range of the prospect before him,” and Lord Hartington prepared to comply with the request that he should repair to Balmoral. The visit was eventually not thought necessary by the Queen.|$|E
6000|$|When {{the famous}} Trojan {{wanderer}} narrated his escapes and adventures to Queen Dido, her Majesty, as we read, took the very greatest {{interest in the}} fascinating story-teller who told his perils so eloquently. A history ensued, more pathetic {{than any of the}} <b>previous</b> <b>occurrences</b> in the life of Pius Aeneas, and the poor princess had reason to rue the day when she listened to that glib and dangerous orator. Harry Warrington had not pious Aeneas's power of speech, and his elderly aunt, we may presume, was by no means so soft-hearted as the sentimental Dido; but yet the lad's narrative was touching, as he delivered it with his artless eloquence and cordial voice; and more than once, {{in the course of his}} story, Madam Bernstein found herself moved to a softness to which she had very seldom before allowed herself to give way. There were not many fountains in that desert of a life--not many sweet, refreshing resting-places. It had been a long loneliness, for the most part, until this friendly voice came and sounded in her ears and caused her heart to beat with strange pangs of love and sympathy. She doted on this lad, and on this sense of compassion and regard so new to her. Save once, faintly, in very very early youth, she had felt no tender sentiment for any human being. Such a woman would, no doubt, watch her own sensations very keenly, and must have smiled after the appearance of this boy, to mark how her pulses rose above their ordinary beat. She longed after him. She felt her cheeks flush with happiness when he came near. Her eyes greeted him with welcome, and followed him with fond pleasure. [...] "Ah, if she could have had a son like that, how she would have loved him!" [...] "Wait," [...] says Conscience, the dark scoffer mocking within her, [...] "wait, Beatrix Esmond! You know you will weary of this inclination, as you have of all. You know, when the passing fancy has subsided, that the boy may perish, and you won't have a tear for him; or talk, and you weary of his stories; and that your lot in life is to be lonely--lonely." [...] Well? suppose life be a desert? There are halting-places and shades, and refreshing waters; let us profit by them for to-day. We know that we must march when to-morrow comes, and tramp on our destiny onward.|$|E

5000|$|The word Jesus uses {{to greet}} the women {{translates}} as either [...] "good morning" [...] or [...] "rejoice."

Jesus has previously used this same greeting in Matthew for Judas at 26:49 and for the Roman soldiers, and Nolland writes that its return here redeems the expression after its <b>previous</b> <b>occurrences.</b> In John's version of this scene at John 20:19-26, Jesus uses the word [...] "peace" [...] as a greeting.

50|$|It {{was unclear}} what {{had caused the}} failure at first, as {{tracking}} camera footage merely showed a large white cloud enveloping the booster followed by explosion of the entire launch vehicle.

Scott Carpenter's Mercury flight was only days away, and if the failure were caused by the Atlas, it could mean significant delays for that mission, which used a similar Atlas D derived booster. However, analysis of telemetry data and closer examination of the launch films quickly confirmed the Centaur {{as the source of}} trouble and exonerated the Atlas.|$|E

Furthermore, the authors offer additional evidence in favor of a dual-process model by showing validity for these two unique sources of variance...|$|R
