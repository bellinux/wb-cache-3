50|$|BPEL is an {{orchestration}} language, {{and not a}} choreography language. The primary {{difference between}} orchestration and choreography is executability and control. An orchestration specifies an executable process that involves message exchanges with other systems, such that the message exchange sequences are controlled by the orchestration designer. A choreography specifies a protocol for <b>peer-to-peer</b> <b>interactions,</b> defining, e.g., the legal sequences of messages exchanged {{with the purpose of}} guaranteeing interoperability. Such a protocol is not directly executable, as it allows many different realizations (processes that comply with it). A choreography can be realized by writing an orchestration (e.g., {{in the form of a}} BPEL process) for each peer involved in it. The orchestration and the choreography distinctions are based on analogies: orchestration refers to the central control (by the conductor) of the behavior of a distributed system (the orchestra consisting of many players), while choreography refers to a distributed system (the dancing team) which operates according to rules (the choreography) but without centralized control.|$|E

50|$|The goal {{of using}} such {{computer}} applications {{is to increase}} <b>peer-to-peer</b> <b>interactions</b> through digital means, in order to replicate real-life 21st century communication skills. One such technology that has gained significant recognition within K-12 education is the Weblog. Weblogs, or blogs, are frequently accessed on classroom computers due to their positive effects upon students. These online journals are primarily used to support communication {{in the form of}} presentation, and they provide a useful tool for class interaction. Weblogs allow students to present their own findings and discoveries to an authentic audience. Receiving feedback about course work not just from your teacher but from your peers, or possibly from the outside world, can be very empowering to students. In their eyes, having the ability to publish their writing on a blog suddenly transforms them into authors and publishers. Blogs make students are of careful and conscientious writing. Students are no longer writing for an audience of one. Instead, their words face an audience of their peers as well as countless others whose primary goal is not only to read, but also to provide commentary, feedback and even to critique and criticize their words. By using classroom computers for such means, students become increasingly more cautious and aware of their grammar, spelling and word-choice knowing that they are the authors of a published piece of writing that will reach a wide audience.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Self-organisation {{in nature}} is {{responsible}} for many complex and persistent phenomena. This suggests that self-organisation {{may be useful in}} the creation of complex applications.

In this paper we describe applications using self-organisation based upon the DIET multi-agent platform that supports lightweight agents. Multi-agent systems can be created that support decentralisation, scalability and adaptability. We show that these application properties are useful for information sharing in mobile communities via self-organising among middle agents, and via <b>peer-to-peer</b> <b>interaction</b> between agents. 1...|$|R

A national survey of 1511 children and 906 parents found that 12 - 17 -year-olds encounter a range of online risks.

Parental restriction of online <b>peer-to-peer</b> <b>interactions</b> was associated with reduced risk but other mediation strategies, including the widely practiced active co-use, were not.
