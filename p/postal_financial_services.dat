40|$|Post offices, {{inherited}} from the Industrial Revolution, were monolithic telephone and postal administrations. They were intimately linked to the fabric of nations and {{made significant contributions to}} state finances. From the 1960 s onwards, integrators, such as UPS and FEDEX, started offering end-to-end express services, thus challenging the postal monopoly in new high added value services. Gradually, the liberalization paradigm gained ground. Telecommunications and sometimes financial services were spun off from postal operations. More recently, new policies and priorities started to emerge especially on the development agenda where financial inclusion has become a top priority in the developing world. The question to be addressed is which role, if any, the posts play or could play in ensuring inclusion. Despite an exceptionally scarce research in the field, this paper provides an overview of how these shifts in paradigm have affected postal policy, the <b>postal</b> <b>financial</b> <b>services</b> regulatory framework, the status of the organizations delivering those services and the offerings themselves in developing as well as in developed countries. After a research review, including the regulatory dimension, the paper focuses on how <b>postal</b> <b>financial</b> <b>services</b> institutions in their legal framework have developed bringing to the fore a panorama of a dozen of promising transformations of financial postal services in developing countries...|$|E

40|$|This volume {{contains}} {{the proceedings of}} a discussion forum relating issues of competitiveness in a globalised world to European competition policies. It includes a view from Joseph E.

Aspects of sectoral regulation are discussed {{with respect to the}} electricity, railway, <b>postal</b> <b>services</b> and <b>financial</b> <b>services</b> sectors {{as well as to the}} regulation of shop-opening hours. Globalisation has enhanced competition, but it has also encouraged collusion between companies which limits the degree of competition. This puts pressure on competition authorities to establish cross-country networks. In the EU, the decentralisation of enforcement activities should therefore be complemented by some institutionalised horizontal co-operation between national competition authorities. ...|$|R

Payment operations and banking services for different business banks show high rates of annual increase {{while at the same time}} postal money orders and banking services of the Postal Saving Bank mark steady decrease in the years of the observed period. However, viewed as a group of services (a segment) they have marked a high average annual rate of increase of 6. 2 % for the territory of the Yugoslav Posts and 5. 5 % for the territory of the Croatian Posts due to a dominant share of the former of 93 % for Yugoslavia and 95 % for Croatia as compared to the latter. </p...|$|R
40|$|First class {{postage rates}} have been raised once again {{in an effort to}} curb the <b>Postal</b> <b>Service’s</b> <b>financial</b> problems. This scenario, which has taken place {{regularly}} every two or three years, has resulted in first class rates rising faster than inflation. In most industries, an “easy ” solution of this kind is not possible because businesses must compete tosurvive. But then, as Miller (1985) emphasizes, the Postal Service is facilitated by a monopoly on first class mail. Where did the monopoly come from in the first place? Should the Postal Service be allowed to keep avoiding the realities of the marketplace? My view of the beginning of the postal monopoly is pragmatic, as is Miller’s, but I also view the growth of this public monopoly as cyclical rather than constant. Miller says that the Constitution gives onlyCongress the right to conduct postal business. Furthermore, he says the Postal Service took on itself the responsibility for defining a “letter ” and thereby cinched its own monopoly. I believe the Post Office felt the need to do so historically because {{there has always been a}} sizable contingent which did not respect the monopoly pro-vision, especially if service was poor and rates high. Periodic chal-lenges have taken place, often under the benign neglect of the gov-ernment ifnot its official sanction. The historical record suggests tha...|$|R

40|$|This study {{focuses on}} {{exploring}} {{the determinants of}} the use of <b>financial</b> <b>services</b> in Tanzania with respect to the role of household behavioural factors. This is achieved by attempting three interrelated research questions: i) What are the financial experiences of households in Tanzania? ii) What are beliefs held by households in Tanzania about the use of <b>financial</b> <b>services?</b> iii) What are the effects of household behavioural characteristics for intention to use <b>financial</b> <b>services</b> and subsequent usage of <b>financial</b> <b>services?</b> Both quantitative and qualitative research methods are employed to achieve the research objective. The empirical findings suggest that behavioural factors matter for the use of <b>financial</b> <b>services.</b> Firstly, the examination of household financial experiences on a sample of 30 households through the application of financial diary methodology revealed a variety of household financial experiences that highlight the necessity of <b>financial</b> <b>services</b> to households. Secondly, despite the fact that most households do not use <b>financial</b> <b>services,</b> it is found that households hold positive beliefs about <b>financial</b> <b>services</b> for saving facilities, security, finance, money management and improving economic well-being. Thirdly, structural equations models indicate that attitudes towards <b>financial</b> <b>services,</b> perceived behavioural control and subjective norms significantly impact the intention to use <b>financial</b> <b>services.</b> Perceived behavioural control is observed to prominently influence the use of <b>financial</b> <b>services.</b> The study offers the following contributions: Firstly, it develops a behavioural conceptual framework that integrates financial and psychological perspectives. This framework facilitates a broader understanding of the determinants for the use of <b>financial</b> <b>services</b> from various perspectives. Secondly, it provides distinct insights into the influence of behavioural characteristics in the use of <b>financial</b> <b>services.</b> This adds to the limited empirical literature about the determinants for the use of <b>financial</b> <b>services</b> specifically the effects of behavioural factors. Based on the findings, implications for financial inclusion initiatives and relevant future research have been identified...|$|R
