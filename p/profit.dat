The club {{has one of}} the largest supporting groups in Italy (fourth, behind Juventus and Milan teams) which was the main source of income, in terms of gate revenue and TV rights. Except the first few seasons, Napoli made an aggregate <b>profit</b> in successive years: in 2004–05 and 2005–06 season the net loss were €7,061,463 and €9,088,780. In 2006–07 Serie B, Napoli made its first <b>profit</b> of €1,416,976 The first Serie A season back Napoli had a net <b>profit</b> of €11,911,041 It followed with a net <b>profit</b> of €10,934,520, due to the income from European matches which was offset by the increase in cost. In 2009–10 season, Napoli heavily invested on players, and made that season a net <b>profit</b> of just €343,686. In 2010–11 Serie A, Napoli returned to the right track with €4,197,829 net <b>profit.</b> It was due to the new collective TV rights of Serie A, as well as qualification to 2010–11 UEFA Europa League.|$|E

50|$|In {{addition}} to income tax, companies were also {{subject to a}} <b>profits</b> tax, which was deducted from company <b>profits</b> when determining the income tax liability. It was a differential tax, with a higher tax rate on dividends (<b>profits</b> distributed to shareholders) than on <b>profits</b> retained within the company. By penalising the distribution of <b>profits,</b> it was hoped companies would retain <b>profits</b> for investment, which was considered a priority after the Second World War. The tax {{did not have the}} desired effect, so the distributed <b>profits</b> tax was increased by 20% by the post-war Labour government to encourage companies to retain more of their <b>profits.</b> At the time of Hugh Gaitskell's 1951 budget, the <b>profits</b> tax was 50% for distributed <b>profits</b> and 10% for undistributed <b>profits.</b>|$|R
50|$|<b>Profits</b> from government-owned {{corporation}}s: Especially when a {{government-owned corporation}} enjoys a legally protected monopoly and records excessive <b>profits,</b> such <b>profits</b> may be criticized as hidden taxation.

50|$|A {{series of}} {{reductions}} in the <b>profits</b> tax were brought in from 1951 onwards by the new Conservative government. The tax rates fell to 22.5% on distributed <b>profits</b> and 2.5% on undistributed <b>profits</b> by 1957, but the <b>profits</b> tax was no longer income tax-deductible. Derick Heathcoat-Amory's Budget of March 1958 replaced the differential <b>profits</b> tax with a single <b>profits</b> tax measure, applicable to both retained and distributed <b>profits.</b> This gradual decrease, and final abolition, of taxes on capital distributions reflected ideological differences between the Conservative and Labour parties: the Conservative approach was to distribute <b>profits</b> to capital holders for investment elsewhere, while Labour sought to force companies to retain <b>profits</b> for reinvestment in the company in the hope this would benefit the company's workforce.|$|R

5|$|As the CIP allowed licensees {{to import}} goods at half price, it was {{regarded}} as a virtual guarantee of business success, regardless of entrepreneurial skill. As a result, the licenses were highly prized. For those who were not confident in their sales ability, a healthy <b>profit</b> was usually made by selling their license to other willing businessmen, especially as demand far outstripped supply. A 1966 US Government report concluded {{that it was possible to}} guarantee a 100% domestic <b>profit</b> on piasters, and that a 50% <b>profit</b> could be safely achieved by using black market exchange rates and depositing one's money in an American bank.|$|E

25|$|Advocates {{of unions}} {{claim that the}} higher wages that unions demand can be paid for through company <b>profits.</b> However, as Milton Friedman pointed out, <b>profits</b> are only very rarely high enough. 80% of {{national}} income is wages, and only about 6% is <b>profits</b> after tax, providing very little room for higher wages, even if <b>profits</b> could be totally used up. Moreover, <b>profits</b> are invested leading {{to an increase in}} capital: which raises the value of labor, increasing wages.

40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} {{presence}} and sources of contrarian and momentum <b>profits</b> on the Indian stock market. Results show that there are contrarian and momentum <b>profits</b> in the short- and medium-term investment horizons, respectively. Further investigation reveals that investors can only earn short-term contrarian <b>profits</b> by investing in small and medium size (and low- and medium-trade volume) firms. In contrast, large firms (and high-volume of trade firms) appear to be correctly priced, leaving no opportunity for contrarian <b>profits.</b> As far as the sources of contrarian <b>profits</b> are concerned, firm-specific component is {{the major source of}} such <b>profits.</b> The role of firm-specific component as the source of contrarian <b>profits</b> for large size and high trade volume firms is very small and this phenomenon explains why large firms do not contribute to contrarian <b>profits.</b> Firm-specific component plays the major role in contrarian <b>profits</b> for small and medium size and low and medium trade volume firms. However, the good news for the Indian stock market is that the contribution of firm-specific component as a source of contrarian <b>profits</b> has decreased dramatically since 1999...|$|R
50|$|The <b>profits</b> tax {{is imposed}} on the <b>profits</b> of a firm.

However, {{in the field of}} mining, it is difficult to implement this tax, since it is problematic to compute economic depreciation, e.g.: “the treatment of depletion allowances and exploration” The <b>profits</b> tax is a direct tax.|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} the paper is to present the {{theoretical}} and empirical analysis of the causal relationship between company 2 ̆ 7 s investment and <b>profits.</b> Following the previous research findings that are not unanimous, we examined the causal relation between <b>profits</b> and investment both at the aggregate and at the industry level. The theory on the field allows us to define three basic theses: <b>profits</b> determine investment on the aggregate level or industry sectors level in a national economy, investment determines <b>profits,</b> and <b>profits</b> determine investment and investment determine <b>profits.</b> We used the Granger definition of causality and the Toda-Yamamoto procedure. Based {{on the results of}} the analysis, we can claim that investment determines <b>profits</b> in a national economy. At the industry sectors level there is the greatest support for a cause-and-effect relation in the direction from <b>profits</b> to investment. The results of our empirical analysis and contextual interpretation can help in identifying potential factors and barriers that hinder the effective functioning of the economic system. It is undisputed that investment and <b>profits</b> is extraordinarily important for the economic system and that the investment and <b>profits</b> relation is undeniably strong...|$|R
