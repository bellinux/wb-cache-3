5|$|In 2017, another {{stage of}} {{expansion}} was announced, adding a four-way tram junction {{at the intersection}} of North Terrace, King William Street and King William Road. One further stop would be provided north of that junction, adjacent to the Adelaide Festival Centre, and three to the east of it near Museum, University and East End at the new eastern terminus in front of the old Royal Adelaide Hospital. The project is expected to cost $80 million with the contract awarded to a joint venture of Downer Rail and York Civil. <b>Preliminary</b> <b>works</b> began in July 2017 with major works commencing in October and are scheduled to be completed in 2018.|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{identify}} and analyze the dominating discourse in the <b>preliminary</b> <b>work</b> of the Sex Purchase Act. In order to achieve the {{aim of this}} study we selected <b>preliminary</b> <b>work</b> of the Sex Purchase Act that was produced between 1977 and 1999. The selection is based on the fact that prostitution began to be recognized as a social problem and a gender equality issue between men and women in society. The ongoing debate during the chosen years resulted in the Sex Purchase Act, which was passed in 1999. By using discourse analysis as a methodological and theoretical approach, we have empirically studied and theoretically analyzed the dominating discourse in the <b>preliminary</b> <b>work</b> of the Sex Purchase Act. This study shows that the dominating discourse in the <b>preliminary</b> <b>work</b> is based on a perception that prostitution reflects violence against women, which prevents women and men from becoming equal in society. The dominating discourse in the <b>preliminary</b> <b>work</b> is characterized by a heteronormative standard and has influences that can be recognized as feminist ideology. The content in the dominating discourse is produced by people with high social status, which gives sex buyers and sex workers limited influence on how their categories are presented in the <b>preliminary</b> <b>work...</b>|$|R

500|$|The first {{track was}} {{laid in the}} Bowshank Tunnel on 4 April 2014. On 30 September 2014, the first train on the Waverley Route for 45 years – a works train – ran to Newcraighall. Tracklaying began in earnest on 6 October 2014, {{although}} <b>preliminary</b> <b>works</b> had resulted in a section of slab track laid through Bowshank Tunnel, south of Stow, as well as ballasting along large sections of the route and pre-cast switch and crossing units for the passing loops. The {{first part of the}} route to be ballasted was the section through Lothianbridge Viaduct to which structural repairs had to be carried out. By the end of October, more than [...] of track had been laid as far as Tynehead and the double-track on the Shawfair loop had been completed plus [...] of the second track on the Borthwick loop. Work was halted in late November 2014 after a contractor working for BAM Nuttall in the Gala area was injured when a sleeper came loose when being lifted into position and landed on his leg. Work restarted on 12 January 2015 following a review by BAM of their track installation methodology. By 3 February, the track was complete through Galashiels and hundreds of spectators turned out to welcome the first train into the station since 1969, which was hauled by GBRf Class 66761 and 66741.|$|E
2500|$|Pottery {{is one of}} {{the oldest}} {{materials}} for sculpture, as well as clay being the medium in which many sculptures cast in metal are originally modelled for casting. Sculptors often build small <b>preliminary</b> <b>works</b> called maquettes of ephemeral materials such as plaster of Paris, wax, unfired clay, or plasticine. [...] Many cultures have produced pottery which combines a function as a vessel with a sculptural form, and small figurines have often been as popular as they are in modern Western culture.

Renewal of track commenced in 2007 on the line between Ennis and Athenry was completed in 2009. After a gap of more than thirty years, train services between the cities of Galway and Limerick commenced on Tuesday the 30 March 2010, on budget {{at a cost of}} €106.5m. [...] The service provides five trains per day between Galway and Limerick. [...] It serves existing stations at Limerick, Ennis, Athenry and Galway, as well as new stations at Sixmilebridge, Gort, Ardrahan and Craughwell. The Limerick to Galway service also feeds into expanded intercity services between Limerick and Dublin and between Galway and Dublin. Irish Rail planned for both routes to gain hourly services at peak and two hourly off-peak, however recession has resulted in delay, with some services withdrawn.|$|E
2500|$|Proposals for a canal {{across the}} Isthmus of Panama {{date back to}} 1529, soon after the Spanish conquest. Álvaro de Saavedra Cerón, a {{lieutenant}} of conquistador Vasco Núñez de Balboa, suggested four possible routes, one of which closely tracks the present-day canal. Saavedra believed that such a canal {{would make it easier}} for European vessels to reach Asia. Although King Charles I was enthusiastic and ordered <b>preliminary</b> <b>works</b> started, his officials in Panama soon realized that such an undertaking was beyond the capabilities of 16th-century technology. One official wrote to Charles, [...] "I pledge to Your Majesty that there is not a prince in the world with the power to accomplish this". The Spanish instead built a road across the isthmus. The road came to be crucial to Spain's economy, as treasure obtained along the Pacific coast of South America was offloaded at Panama City and hauled through the jungle to the Atlantic port of Nombre de Dios, close to present day Colón. Although additional canal building proposals were made throughout the 16th and 17th centuries, they came to naught.|$|E

The same year the Navy {{had taken a}} great harvest of prizes in the North Sea, one of which, a Prussian fishing dogger, {{flat-bottomed}} and rounded at the stem and stern, was purchased to be a floating lightship, and re-named the Pharos. By July 1807 she was overhauled, rigged for her new purpose, and turned into the lee of the Isle of May. ‘It was proposed that the whole party should meet in her and pass the night; but she rolled {{from side to side}} in so extraordinary a manner, that even the most seahardy fled. It was humorously observed of this vessel that she was in danger of making a round turn and appearing with her keel uppermost; and that she would even turn a half-penny if laid upon deck.’ By two o’clock {{on the morning of the}} 15th July this purgatorial vessel was moored by the Bell Rock.|$|E
