50|$|<b>Polyphenylene</b> <b>oxide</b> is {{well known}} for oxidation. This can be viewed as follows.|$|E
5000|$|A {{wide range}} of {{polymers}} are now produced in glass-filled varieties, including polyamide (Nylon), acetal homopolymers and copolymers, polyester, <b>polyphenylene</b> <b>oxide</b> (PPO / Noryl), polycarbonate, polyethersulphone ...|$|E
40|$|An {{internal}} foam fabrication {{is one of}} {{the concepts}} being considered for cryogenic insulation on the hydrogen tanks of the shuttle vehicle. The three-dimensional polyurethane used on the S- 4 B tanks failed to meet the higher temperature requirements of the shuttle vehicle, however, and other foams under consideration include polyisocyanurates, <b>polyphenylene</b> <b>oxides,</b> polyimides, and polybenzimidazoles. Improved adhesive systems for attaching the foams to the interior tank wall are under study...|$|R
40|$|Novel {{polyphenylene}} ethers with imide linking {{units are}} disclosed. These polymers incorporate the solvent and thermal resistance of polyimides and the processability of polyphenylene ethers. Improved physical properties over {{those of the}} prior art are obtained by incorporating meta linked ethers and/or <b>polyphenylene</b> <b>oxides</b> into the polymer backbone. A novel process for making polymers of this type is also disclosed. The process is unique in that the expected need of high process temperatures and/or special atmospheres are eliminated...|$|R
50|$|Phenyl ether {{polymers}} are a {{class of}} polymers that contain a phenoxy and/or a thiophenoxy group as the repeating group in ether linkages. Commercial phenyl ether polymers belong to two chemical classes: polyphenyl ethers (PPEs) and <b>polyphenylene</b> <b>oxides</b> (PPOs). The phenoxy groups in the former class of polymers do not contain any substituents whereas those in the latter class contain 2 to 4 alkyl groups on the phenyl ring. The structure of an oxygen-containing PPE is provided in Figure 1 and that of a 2, 6-xylenol derived PPO is shown in Figure 2. Either class can have the oxygen atoms attached at various positions around the rings.|$|R
50|$|Allan Stuart Hay FRS1929-2017(born July 23, 1929 in Edmonton, Alberta) is a Canadian chemist, and Tomlinson Emeritus Professor of Chemistry at McGill University. He is {{best known}} for his synthesization of <b>Polyphenylene</b> <b>Oxide,</b> leading to the {{development}} of Noryl and various other plastics.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Polyphenylene</b> <b>oxide</b> (PPO) - {{polystyrene}} (PS): Noryl {{developed by}} General Electric Plastics in 1966 (now owned by SABIC). The miscibility {{of the two}} polymers in Noryl {{is caused by the}} presence of an aromatic ring in the repeat units of both chains; ...|$|E
50|$|Mixing {{polymers}} {{is another}} method of increasing strength, particularly with materials that show crazing preceding brittle fracture such as atactic polystyrene (APS). For example, by forming a 50/50 mixture of APS with <b>polyphenylene</b> <b>oxide</b> (PPO), this embrittling tendency can be almost completely suppressed, substantially increasing the fracture strength.|$|E
40|$|Homopolymers of the monomers, 2, 6 -dimethyl-phenol (DMP) was {{synthesised}} by {{two methods}} involving oxidative coupling of their phenol monomer. Both the methods {{were found to}} be quite different in terms of producing polymers of different physical and mechanical properties. The first method produced polymers of low intrinsic viscosity with fairly good mechanical strength. Where as the second method produced polymers with higher intrinsic viscosity accompanied by enhanced mechanical properties. The synthesised polymers were characterised for structure-property correlations by measuring physical and mechanical properties namely, density measurements, dilute solution intrinsic viscosity measurements, tensile testing and fourier transform infra red spectroscopy (FTIR). The study reveals methodology for tailoring properties of <b>polyphenylene</b> <b>oxides</b> to suit various applications...|$|R
40|$|A {{three-dimensional}} finite-element meso-cell {{model has}} been designed and constructed to predict initiation of the particle/polymer matrix debonding damage and non-linear stress-strain relation of particulate polymer composites (PPC). The meso-cell model consists of a micro-particle, an interface, and a matrix. The initiation of the debonding damage process has been predicted {{on the basis of}} a tensile criterion. An experimental investigation has been made on glass beads reinforced <b>polyphenylene</b> <b>oxides</b> for verification of the meso-cell model and the meso-mechanical finite-element technique. In situ scanning electron microscopy has been adopted to study the particle-matrix debonding process in real time under tensile deformation. The predicted results have been found to be in good agreement with the experimental results. The results of the in situ microscopic test also verify the correctness of the meso-cell model.

40|$|Membrane gas {{separation}} {{emerged as}} a commercial process {{on a large scale}} during the 1980 s. When compared to other gas separation processes such as cryogenics, adsorption and absorption, membrane separation competes primarily on the basis of overall economics and convenience, but {{not on the basis of}} product purity. For example, membranes have been used for offshore natural gas processing because they reduce the size and the weight of the processing units, require less maintenance and less operator supervision. In order to improve product purity, development of new membrane materials, and modification of existing membrane material for better gas separation properties, is required. This research focused on preparation and characterization of new copolymers from the family of <b>polyphenylene</b> <b>oxides.</b> This family of polymers was chosen because of the properties of its best-known representative, poly(2, 6 -dimethyl- 1, 4 -phenylene oxide), which shows one of the highest rates of permeability for gases among glassy polymers, exhibits excellent film-forming properties, and is resistant to a number of chemical agents. The study was divided into two parts: (1) homopolymers and both block and random copolymers of different composition were synthesized by oxidative coupling of 2, 6 -diphenylphenol and 2, 6 -dimethylphenol; (2) the physical and gas transport properties of the polymers were determined. (Abstract shortened by UMI. ...|$|R
5000|$|<b>Polyphenylene</b> <b>oxide</b> (PPO), {{which is}} {{obtained}} from the free-radical, step-growth oxidative coupling polymerization of 2,6-xylenol, has many attractive properties such as high heat distortion and impact strength, chemical stability to mineral and organic acids, and low water absorption. PPO is difficult to process, and hence the commercial resin (Noryl) is made by blending PPO with high-impact polystyrene (HIPS) which serves to reduce the processing temperature.|$|E
50|$|A {{large number}} of {{commercial}} polymeric products are derived from the blending {{of two or more}} polymers to achieve a favorable balance of physical properties. However, since most polymer blends are immiscible, it is rare to find a pair of polymers that both are miscible and have desired characteristics. An example of such pair is the miscible resin NORYL™, a mix of <b>poly(phenylene</b> <b>oxide)</b> and polystyrene. Immiscible blends will phase separate and form a dispersed phase, which may improve physical properties (figure 1). DuPont’s rubber toughened Nylon consists of small particles of poly(cis-isoprene) (natural rubber) in a Nylon matrix that toughen the material by arresting crack propagation.|$|E
5000|$|Block {{copolymers}} {{are interesting}} {{because they can}} [...] "microphase separate" [...] to form periodic nanostructures, as in the styrene-butadiene-styrene block copolymer shown at right. The polymer is known as Kraton and is used for shoe soles and adhesives. Owing to the microfine structure, the transmission electron microscope or TEM was needed to examine the structure. The butadiene matrix was stained with osmium tetroxide to provide contrast in the image. The material was made by living polymerization so that the blocks are almost monodisperse, so helping to create a very regular microstructure. The molecular weight of the polystyrene blocks in the main picture is 102,000; the inset picture has a molecular weight of 91,000, producing slightly smaller domains. The spacing between domains has been confirmed by small-angle X-ray scattering, a technique which gives information about microstructure.Since most polymers are incompatible with one another, forming a block polymer will usually result in phase separation, and the principle has been widely exploited since {{the introduction of the}} SBS block polymers, especially where one of the block is highly crystalline. One exception to the rule of incompatibility is the material Noryl, where polystyrene and <b>polyphenylene</b> <b>oxide</b> or PPO form a continuous blend with one another.|$|E
40|$|Relative {{adhesion}} strengths between AS 4, AS 1, and XAS {{carbon fibers}} and thermoplastic polymers were determined using the embedded single filament test. Polymers studied included polycarbonate, <b>polyphenylene</b> <b>oxide,</b> polyetherimide, polysulfone, <b>polyphenylene</b> <b>oxide</b> blends with polystyrene, and polycarbonate blends with a polycarbonate polysiloxane block copolymer. Fiber surface treatments and sizings improved adhesion somewhat, but adhesion remained well below levels obtained with epoxy matrices. An {{explanation for the}} differences between the Hercules and Grafil fibers was sought using X ray photon spectroscopy, wetting, scanning electron microscopy and thermal desorption analysis...|$|E
40|$|International audienceThis paper {{describes}} the synthesis and {{the characterization of}} <b>poly(phenylene</b> <b>oxide)</b> -based nanoelectrode arrays. Using a hybrid organic/inorganic "sol-gel" solution, FTO (fluoro-tin-oxide) nanoelectrode arrays were synthesized with well-defined order, and controlled diameter of the nanoelectrode and the center-to-center distance. These FTO/ZrO 2 nanoelectrodes were modified with ultrathin, polymer coatings based on the self-limiting electropolymerization of phenol. The polymer coated mainly the FTO nanoelectrodes. Impedance coupled with FTIR spectroscopies studies shows that the electrodeposited polymer coating is uniform, conformal and pin-hole free. The CP-AFM (conductive probe-AFM) imaging studies confirm that the ultrathin, uniform insulating <b>poly(phenylene</b> <b>oxide)</b> (PPO) layer homogeneously coats the FTO nanoelectrodes...|$|E

40|$|The single fiber {{adhesion}} {{shear test}} has been adapted to testing the adhesion between carbon fiber and thermoplastic polymers. Tests of three thermoplastics, polycarbonate, <b>polyphenylene</b> <b>oxide</b> and polyetherimide indicate the shear adhesion strength is {{significantly less than}} of an epoxy polymer to the same carbon fiber...|$|E
40|$|A {{personal}} UV dosimeter {{that can}} quantitatively assess high exposure solar UVA exposures has been developed. The chemical <b>polyphenylene</b> <b>oxide</b> {{has been previously}} reported {{on its ability to}} measure high UVB exposures. This current research has found that <b>polyphenylene</b> <b>oxide,</b> cast in thin film form, is responsive to both the UVA and UVB parts of the solar spectrum. Further to this, the UVB wavelengths were filtered out with the use of mylar. This combined system responded to the UVA wavelengths only and underwent a change in optical absorbance as a result of UVA exposure. Preliminary results indicate that this UVA dosimeter saturates steadily when exposed to sunlight and can measure exposures of more than 20 MJ/m 2 of solar UVA radiation with an uncertainty level of no more than ± 5 %...|$|E
40|$|The {{adhesion}} strength of AS 4 fibers to thermoplastic polymers was determined. The specific polymers were polycarbonate, <b>polyphenylene</b> <b>oxide,</b> polyetherimide, <b>polyphenylene</b> <b>oxide</b> blends with polystyrene, and polycarbonate blends with a polycarbonate-polysiloxan copolymer. Data are also included for polysulfone. It was recognized {{at the outset}} that an absolute measure of the fiber matrix adhesion would be difficult. However, it is feasible to determine the fiber bond strengths to the thermoplastics relative to the bond strengths of the same fibers to epoxy polymers. It was anticipated, and in fact realized, that the adhesion of AS 4 to the thermoplastic polymers was relatively low. Therefore, further objectives of the study were to identify means of increasing fiber/matrix adhesion and to try to determine why the adhesion of AS 4 to thermoplastics is significantly less than to epoxy polymers...|$|E

40|$|Some new {{examples}} of favorable interactions between additives in flame retardant formulations have been found. These include the following: phosphorus combinations such as triphenyl phosphate with a tetraphenyl phenylene diphosphate, and char-former combinations such as novolacs with <b>polyphenylene</b> <b>oxide</b> in styrenics, melamine with <b>polyphenylene</b> <b>oxide</b> and kaolinite in polyolefin elastomers; and a neopentyl phosphonate ester with a melamine phosphate in ethylene-vinyl acetate. Useful interactions were detected by various tests and data analysis methods including multiple regression, and further elucidated by various analytical methods. Some indications of possible modes {{of action and}} explanations for the interactions are presented. Barrier formation appears {{to play an important}} role in these three cases, although vapor phase action (possibly physical) is also noted. Rate of char formation is suggested as an important variable. The systematic use of combinations of differently functioning flame retardants constitutes the ‘systems approach’ which is advocated for the solution of retardancy problems...|$|E
40|$|It {{has been}} shown that liquid {{junction}} potentials (LJP) are the cause of a systematic error of hydroxonium ions (protons) static transport numbers in membranes made from sulfonated <b>poly(phenylene</b> <b>oxide)</b> if LJP are calculated from concentration potentials measured by means of KCl filled electrodes. The remedy has been found in the use of wire electrodes of second kind like Ag/AgCl. Theory and results...|$|E

In AsF 5 doped poly-(p-phenylene) two states inside the gap have been seen, consistent with a bipolaron model for the conductivity...|$|E
40|$|Information {{about the}} {{mechanism}} of the electrochemical oxidation of dimethylphenols in NaOH + MeOH solution was obtained by an in situ multiple internal reflection Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy study. Polymer film forma-tion is rapid when the para position of the hydroxyl group is free, while it cannot occur when the para and one 0 fthe ortho positions are blocked. In the latter case, methanol is electro-oxidized, giving formate ions as the main product. Electropolymerization has been investigated recently as a method for synthesizing and deposit ing polymer coatings onto conduct ive substrates (1). From phenolic derivatives, we have prepared and studied chemical and physical properties {{of a series of}} <b>polyphenylene</b> <b>oxide</b> films (2) -which are insulators while some semiconductor films are obtained with another series of polymers from naphtol derivatives (3).

Detailed membrane flux and rejection data are presented for 200 -hr life tests with synthetic wash water, at two concentrations, and real wash water, at one concentration.
