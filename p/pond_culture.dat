40|$|ABSTRACT—In {{order to}} study the {{olfactory}} discriminating ability of lacustrine sockeye salmon (Oncorhynchus nerka) and masu salmon (O. masou), the integrated olfactory nerve response to various freshwaters was recorded by electrophysiological techniques. In both species independent of sex and gonadal maturity, each freshwater caused a different olfactory response. Source and effluent waters of the <b>culture</b> <b>pond</b> at Toya Lake Station (the source and <b>culture</b> <b>pond</b> waters) evoked the minimum and maximum response magnitude, respectively. In cross-adaptation experiments, the <b>culture</b> <b>pond</b> water abolished all secondary responses to other freshwaters, and no freshwater abolished the secondary response to the <b>culture</b> <b>pond</b> water. The concentration response study revealed that the minimum concentration (threshold) to induce response to the <b>culture</b> <b>pond</b> water after adaptation to Lake Toya water was between 0. 1 and 1. 0 %.

50|$|The {{first people}} {{known to have}} entered the area of Alachua County were Paleo-Indians, who left {{artifacts}} in the Santa Fe River basin prior to 8000 BCE. Artifacts from the Archaic period (8000 - 2000 BCE) have been found at several sites in Alachua County. Permanent settlements appeared {{in what is now}} Alachua County around 100 CE, as people of the wide-ranging Deptford culture developed the local Cades <b>Pond</b> <b>culture.</b> The Cades <b>Pond</b> <b>culture</b> gave way to the Alachua culture around 600 CE. The Timucua-speaking Potanos lived in the Alachua culture area in the 16th century, when the Spanish entered Florida.

40|$|The dual {{problems}} of global fossil fuels supplies {{and global warming}} {{focus attention on the}} need to develop technologies that can provide large amounts of renewable fuels without contributing to global warming. The capture of power plant flue gas CO 2 using microalgae cultures is one potential technology that could meet this objective. The central R&D issues are the design and operation of low-cost algal mass culture systems and the development of algal strains and cultivation techniques that can achieve very high biomass productivities. The major objective of this project was to develop mass culture techniques that could result in greatly increased biomass productivities, well above the about 50 metric tons per hectare per year (mt/ha/y) currently achievable. In this project, two marine microalgae species, the diatom Cyclotella sp [...] and the green alga Tetraselmis sp., were cultivated on seawater in both open ponds and closed photo bioreactors, under a variety of different cultivation conditions. Simultaneous operation of the closed photo bioreactors and open ponds demonstrated similar productivities, under the same operating conditions. Thus the very expensive closed systems do not provide any major or inherent advantages in microalgae production over open ponds. Mutants of Cyclotella sp. were developed that exhibited reduced pigment content, which theoretically would result in greatly increased productivities when grown under full sunlight. However, in open ponds, these mutant strains exhibited similar productivities as the parental strains. The mutant strains all grew relatively slowly, suggesting that additional mutations masked whatever inherent potential for increased productivities may have resulted from the reduced pigment content. Research is still required to develop improved low pigment strains. When open <b>pond</b> <b>cultures</b> were exposed to intermittent sunlight, by partially covering the ponds with slats, solar conversion efficiencies increased dramatically, by over 50 %. Although such techniques are not directly applicable to practical processes, the experiments demonstrated the inherent potential of algal mass cultures to achieve very high productivities. Nitrogen limited <b>pond</b> <b>cultures</b> demonstrated {{that it is possible to}} produce biomass with a potentially high content of carbohydrates or oils (although these were not directly measured in these experiments), without reducing achievable productivities. This suggested that microalgae biomass suitable for conversion to biofuels (ethanol or biodiesel) could be produced without compromising productivity. Experiments combining both light modulation and nitrogen limitation indicated possibly synergistic effects. The goal of developing practical and economic processes for the sustainable production of renewable fuels with microalgae <b>pond</b> <b>cultures</b> using power plant flue gases as sources of CO 2 was advanced by these studies, but requires more work. Most important is the research, development and demonstration in outdoor <b>pond</b> <b>cultures</b> of algal strains with low pigment content. Such strains are the most likely approach to achieve, in combination with the other mass culture techniques investigated in this study, the very high productivities, above 100 mt/ha/y (45 t/acre/y), that are the goal in this field. The projected economics for such a process suggests that, as for higher plant biofuel production, microalgae biofuels production should be developed as a multiproduct process providing additional higher value co-products...|$|R

30|$|Two major {{concerns}} regarding the production stability were addressed. The {{first was the}} evaporation of brackish growth media leading to increasing salt content and possible salt stress.

Laboratory tests have shown CA’s ability to survive up to 45  °C (Moro et al. 2007; Winckelmann et al. 2015) and increasing salt content (Winckelmann et al. 2015).
