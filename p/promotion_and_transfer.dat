5|$|Agreeing to this proposal, Crisp became first a Seaman and by {{the summer}} of 1916 a Skipper in the Royal Naval Reserve, {{arranging}} for his son to join the crew of his boat, the HM Armed Smack I'll Try, armed with a 3–pounder gun. On 1 February 1917 in the North Sea, I'll Try had its first confrontation with the enemy when two submarines surfaced close to the smack and her companion the larger Boy Alfred. Despite near misses from enemy torpedoes, both smacks scored hits on their larger opponents and reported them as probable sinkings, although post–war German records show that no submarines were lost on that date. Both skippers were awarded the Distinguished Service Cross and a present of £200 for this action, and Crisp was offered a <b>promotion</b> <b>and</b> <b>transfer</b> to an ocean–going Q–ship. He was forced to turn down this offer due to his wife's sudden and terminal illness. She died in June 1917.|$|E
25|$|With an {{appreciation}} that {{both men were}} {{to blame for the}} altercation, Banner gives Bond the assignment he craves: the rocket-powered X-2, which is designed to fly to the edge of outer space. The general insists, however, on piloting the first test flight at full power, despite strong pressure from his superior, Lieutenant General Bryan Shelby (Paul Fix), to let a younger man take on the dangerous job. When Bond is assigned to fly the last half-power test before the main flight, he goes to full power without authorization and barely survives a high-altitude bailout when the aircraft goes out of control. The base flight surgeon tells Banner that only a young, fit person could have survived, leading the general to accept a <b>promotion</b> <b>and</b> <b>transfer.</b> He recommends Colonel McKee as his successor. Although Banner offers to take Connie with him to his new assignment, she decides to stay with Bond.|$|E

2500|$|Returning to Arkansas, Rust {{received}} a commission as [...] Colonel on July 5, 1861, and assisted Van H. Manning in recruiting and organizing the 3d Arkansas Infantry Regiment. The Third Arkansas would become Arkansas's most celebrated Civil War regiment {{and the only}} Arkansas regiment to be permanently assigned to General Robert E. Lee's Army of Northern Virginia. In the fall of 1861, Rust and the Third Arkansas traveled to Western Virginia and {{took part in the}} Battle of Cheat Mountain under Lee.

However, by 1861 he had returned to Alabama, finished his schooling, studied law, {{and set up a}} successful practice in Henry County that also included ownership of a weekly newspaper in his hometown. Opposed to Abraham Lincoln's election, Oates cautioned against precipitate secession; however, once Alabama decided to leave the Union, he threw himself wholeheartedly into the Southern cause, raising a company of volunteers that became Co. [...] "G" [...] of the 15th Alabama. After Cantey's <b>promotion</b> <b>and</b> <b>transfer</b> to a new position, Oates assumed command of the regiment as a whole. [...] In later years, Oates would serve as Governor of Alabama, and would also command three U.S. Brigades (none of which saw combat) during the Spanish–American War.|$|E

40|$|The {{success of}} an {{internal}} labor market (ILM) is predicated on the successful communication of stakeholder benefits. One {{of the benefits of}} an ILM include higher assessed performance {{in the first two years}} among internal <b>promotions</b> <b>and</b> <b>transfers</b> compared to external hires relative to both objective (i. e. sales) and subjective measures (i. e. supervisor performance ratings). Firm-specific skills provide the initial advantage to the internal mover over the external hire, and as the external hire acquires that knowledge the gap in performance is narrowed. Another benefit of a robust ILM is financial. Companies stand to save money over ~ 7 years because the salaries of internally promoted workers were found to be significantly less (18 %) than externally hired employees. Therefore, in order to maximize the value of a firm’s human capital the firm should employ processes and tools in service of retaining and developing its internal talent in preparation for <b>promotion</b> <b>and</b> internal <b>transfer,</b> rather than shoulder the costs of hiring externally. In cases where firms routinely hire externally, managers report an observable drop in employee morale...|$|R

This constant movement of staff was a very common early practice within all railroads owing usually to the large territory combined with the limitations on travel and communications.
