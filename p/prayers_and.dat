5|$|Catholic worship was {{deliberately}} low key, {{usually in the}} private houses of recusant landholders or in domestic buildings adapted for services. Surviving chapels from this period are generally austere and simply furnished. Typical worship consisted of a sermon, long vernacular <b>prayers</b> <b>and</b> an unsung Low Mass in Latin. Musical accompaniment was prohibited until the nineteenth century, when organs began to be introduced into chapels.|$|E

5|$|Devotions to Mary {{are part}} of Catholic piety but are {{distinct}} from the worship of God. Practices include <b>prayers</b> <b>and</b> Marian art, music, and architecture. Several liturgical Marian feasts are celebrated throughout the Church Year and she is honoured with many titles such as Queen of Heaven. Pope Paul VI called her Mother of the Church because, by giving birth to Christ, she {{is considered to be}} the spiritual mother to each member of the Body of Christ. Because of her influential role in the life of Jesus, <b>prayers</b> <b>and</b> devotions such as the Hail Mary, the Rosary, the Salve Regina and the Memorare are common Catholic practices. Pilgrimages to the sites of several Marian apparitions affirmed by the Church, such as Lourdes, Fátima, and Guadalupe, are also popular Catholic devotions.|$|E

5|$|Afternoon is {{the time}} {{occurring}} between noon and evening. The specific range of time this encompasses varies in one direction: noon is currently defined as a constant 12:00 pm, but when afternoon ends is dependent on when evening begins, {{for which there is}} no standard definition. However, before a period of transition from the twelfth to fourteenth centuries, noon instead referred to 3 pm—possible explanations include shifting times for <b>prayers</b> <b>and</b> midday meals, along which one concept of noon was defined—and so afternoon would have referred to a narrower timeframe.|$|E

5|$|Apart {{from these}} more {{spectacular}} pieces of resistance, {{in some places}} chantry priests continued to say <b>prayers</b> <b>and</b> landowners to pay them to do so. Opposition to the removal of images was widespread—so much so that when during the Commonwealth, William Dowsing was commissioned {{to the task of}} image breaking in Suffolk, his task, as he records it, was enormous. In Kent and the southeast, compliance was mostly willing and for many, the sale of vestments and plate was an opportunity to make money (but it was also true that in London and Kent, Reformation ideas had permeated more deeply into popular thinking).|$|E

5|$|Few {{months after}} his birth, al-Jamri family {{traveled}} to Najaf, Iraq where his father continued his religious studies. At the time, al-Jamri's family was composed of his parents and his 2-year-old brother Mohammed Jameel. He studied for five years at the Talibiya primary school which was also attended by some Bahrainis such as Sami, the elder son of Isa Qassim. Having no TV at home, al-Jamri and his siblings {{spent most of their}} time listening to stories told by their mother or playing with kites outside.

40|$|The {{research}} was conducted with the purpose to study the effect of <b>prayer</b> <b>and</b> meditation on galvanic skin response (GSR). It was hypothesized {{that there was a}} significant positive effect of <b>prayer</b> <b>and</b> meditation (Om chanting) on galvanic skin response (GSR). The sample consisted of 20 normal, healthy female participants through purposive sampling. The age group of the sample was 18 to 24 years (Mean = 18. 7, SD= 1. 55). Gender was female and minimum education was graduation. The daily practice time of <b>prayer</b> <b>and</b> meditation session was 30 minutes for one month. Pre- Post data were recorded before and after intervention of <b>prayer</b> <b>and</b> meditation session by using single group pre-post research design. Recordings of galvanic skin response (GSR) were made on a computerized polygraph (Model Physiopac, PP 4, Medicaid Systems, Chandigarh, India) test. The results revealed a significant increase in GSR values as an effect of <b>prayer</b> <b>and</b> meditation which suggested the psychophysiological relaxation. Practicing <b>prayer</b> <b>and</b> meditation increases the galvanic skin response and hence decreases the stress level of the individual...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{the present}} study was to examine the {{relationship}} between a model of <b>prayer</b> <b>and</b> a measure of subjective well-being within the context of a cognitive-behavioural framework. A community sample of 173 (77 males and 96 females) British adults completed measures of <b>prayer</b> activity <b>and</b> the General Health Questionnaire- 28. The present findings suggest that meditative prayer, frequency of <b>prayer,</b> <b>and</b> <b>prayer</b> experience account for unique variance (among other measures of prayer) in a general measure of subjective well-being. The results demonstrate the potential usefulness of a cognitive-behavioural framework to help better understand the relationship between <b>prayer</b> <b>and</b> subjective well-being...|$|R
5|$|Hyder's army {{included}} several Catholic soldiers and he allowed Christians {{to build a}} church within the Seringapatam Fort where French generals offered <b>prayers</b> <b>and</b> priests visited. Mangalorean historian A.L.P. D'Souza mentions that Hyder had also used Canara Christians for administrative purposes. In accordance with the two treaties concluded with Portugal, Hyder allowed Portuguese priests to settle disputes among the Christians. Despite this, the Christians in general hated Hyder Ali because of the heavy taxes they were made to pay to the king's treasury.|$|E
5|$|In the {{folklore}} of Croats of Ravni Kotari, {{a region}} in northern Dalmatia, there were men called vidogoja. They {{were believed to}} know past and future things.

The vidogoja were also thought to be able to inflict diseases on people, and to have evil eyes. They could not fly.|$|E
5|$|Kinberg's wife Alice was {{a strong}} feminist, and during the 1980s {{he and his wife}} {{supported}} a number of changes to the liturgy and ritual.

While most congregation members approved of these changes, a minority resisted them.|$|E

5|$|Religion plays a {{large part}} in the Forgotten Realms, with deities and their {{followers}} being {{an integral part of}} the world. They do not have a passive role, but in fact interact directly in mortal affairs, answer <b>prayers,</b> <b>and</b> have their own personal agendas. All deities must have worshipers to survive, and all mortals must worship a patron deity to secure a good afterlife. A huge number of diverse deities exist within several polytheistic pantheons; a large number of supplements have documented many of them, some in more detail than others.|$|E
5|$|Scholars {{regard the}} badnjak customs as practises {{inherited}} from the old Slavic religion. In the pre-Christian religion of the Serbs, as shown by Serbian scholar Veselin Čajkanović, there were trees seen as dwelling places of spirits or divinities. Čajkanović argues that there were also trees seen as divinities per se. He considers the badnjak as a convincing example of the latter. Salutations, <b>prayers,</b> <b>and</b> sacrifices such as grain, wine, and honey are offered to him (the name badnjak is of masculine gender in Serbian); he is consistently treated not as a tree but as a person.|$|E

5|$|Unknown to Karman, {{both men}} were PKI members and intent on making him join the party. They gave him {{communist}} pamphlets and indoctrinated him in Party philosophy. When Karman was late in telling Rifah his feelings, losing her to another man, the PKI manipulated his emotions to make him leave Islam and hate Haji Bakir. Ultimately this was successful: Karman abandoned his mandatory <b>prayers</b> <b>and</b> began to espouse the Party's politics. After Karman was refused marriage to Rifah a second time, following her husband's death, he had Haji Bakir imprisoned. In this time Karman married Marni, intending to convert her family to communism.|$|E
50|$|The {{heart of}} the Carmelite charism is <b>prayer</b> <b>and</b> contemplation.
