5|$|In these stanzas, Donne {{compares the}} <b>parting</b> of two lovers to a death, {{desiring}} the lovers' <b>parting</b> to be quiet, without struggle, and voluntary {{even though it}} is inevitable. At the same time, he considers the separation of lovers to be equivalent to the soul separating from the body on death. Ramie Targoff argues that this is not because he sees the separation of the lovers as permanent, like death, but that as with death Donne finds the challenge with separation to be ensuring the relationship's continuity in the future.|$|E

5|$|A mould {{is usually}} {{designed}} so that the moulded part reliably remains on the ejector (B) side of the mould when it opens, and draws the runner and the sprue out of the (A) side along with the parts. The part then falls freely when ejected from the (B) side. Tunnel gates, also known as submarine or mould gates, are located below the <b>parting</b> line or mould surface. An opening is machined into {{the surface of the}} mould on the <b>parting</b> line. The moulded part is cut (by the mould) from the runner system on ejection from the mould. Ejector pins, also known as knockout pins, are circular pins placed in either half of the mould (usually the ejector half), which push the finished moulded product, or runner system out of a mould.The ejection of the article using pins, sleeves, strippers, etc., may cause undesirable impressions or distortion, so care must be taken when designing the mould.|$|E

40|$|Abstract-The {{petrography}} of shale <b>partings</b> in carbonate rocks from eleven cores in the Illinois (Jeffersonville Formation) and Michigan Basins (Detroit River Formation) of Indiana {{indicates the}} presence of a K-bentonite which is interpreted as the Tioga Bentonite, an important stratigraphic marker in the middle Devonian rocks throughout the central and eastern United States. The clay mineral composition of the Tioga Bentonite of Indiana is interstratified illite and smectite, usually with admixed kaolinite. This composition stands in striking contrast o the simple illite suite without kaolinite in the normal terrigenous shale <b>partings</b> in the Devonian rocks of Indiana. Euhedral sanidine, high temperature albite, zircon, apatite, and the angularity of quartz grains found associated only with the interstratified clay mineral suite support the volcanic origin of these clay <b>partings...</b>|$|R
