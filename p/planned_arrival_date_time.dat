40|$|AbstractThe {{problem of}} {{personnel}} and interventions scheduling faced by a container ship maintenance service provider (MSPC), commonly {{the manufacturer of}} a main ship subsystem such as engines, is analysed. Clients can make {{a request for a}} maintenance service of a containership at a given harbour with a given number of days in advance to the desired date, as established in the service contract. The MSPC is allowed to delay the intervention to any future stop of the route within a specified time window depending on its urgency, as set in the contract. The MSPC technicians can be divided into different categories of skills and further distinguished as belonging to the MSPC main company, to the MSP network of subsidiaries, or hired on demand, with different availability constraints, personnel costs, and transport costs in relation to harbour proximity. Delays on <b>planned</b> <b>arrival</b> <b>dates</b> to harbours as well as changes in the duration of stay are common due to bad meteorological conditions, congestions at harbours, or other issues arisen during sailing or previous stops, so a rolling planning horizon should be adopted to face such a dynamic environment. A Constraint Programming optimisation model hybridized with Large Neighborhood Search is proposed in order to address the problem and its performance compared to actual plans from a world-wide known MSPC. The model has been developed to perform also as a decision making tool; a factorial design of experiment is adopted in order to analyse the impact of a change in some contractual features, such as the minimum time allowed to clients for requiring a service, or the maximum delay allowed to the MSPC to satisfy a service request. How granting clients more flexibility while preserving efficacy and efficiency of the service can so be investigated...|$|R

The Dawn spacecraft was launched from the Cape Canaveral Air Force Station on September 27, 2007 on a Delta-II 7925 H- 9. 5 rocket that placed the 1218 -kg spacecraft into an Earth-escape trajectory. On-board the spacecraft is an ion propulsion system (IPS) developed at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory which will provide a total delta-V of approximately 11 km/s for the heliocentric transfer to Vesta, orbit capture at Vesta, transfer between Vesta science orbits, departure and escape from Vesta, heliocentric transfer to Ceres, orbit capture at Ceres, transfer between Ceres science orbits, and orbit maintenance maneuvers for all Vesta and Ceres science orbits. Full-power thrusting from December 2007 through October 2008 was used to successfully target a Mars gravity assist flyby in February 2009 that provided an additional delta-V of 2. 6 km/s. Deterministic thrusting for the heliocentric transfer to Vesta resumed in June 2009 and concluded with orbit capture at Vesta on July 16, 2011. An additional 231 hours of IPS thrusting was used to enter the first Vesta science orbit, called Survey orbit, on August 3, 2011 at an altitude of about 2, 735 km. The IPS was then used over the next year to transfer the spacecraft to the other science orbits: a high altitude mapping orbit (HAMO- 1) in September 2011 at an altitude of approximately 673 km, a low altitude mapping orbit (LAMO) at approximately 210 km altitude, and a second high altitude mapping orbit (HAMO- 2) at approximately 673 km altitude. To date the IPS has been operated for approximately 24, 327 hours, consumed approximately 260 kg of xenon, and provided a delta-V of approximately 7 km/s.

40|$|Master of ArtsDepartment of GeographyJohn A. Harrington JrIn {{late summer}} and fall, many migratory birds journey south from the North American Great Plains to spend the winter in {{locations}} with greater food availability. As spring returns, a combination of genetics and environmental cues trigger these birds to return north to their breeding grounds. Several bird migration phenology studies from Europe, Australia, and the eastern/northern United States have discovered that some bird species are returning earlier in the spring, a change that has often been correlated with a warming climate. This study aimed {{to be the first}} to analyze possible changes in both spring bird migration phenology and regional spring climate change in Kansas. First <b>arrival</b> <b>dates</b> (FADs) were collected for thirty bird species, resulting in a database with over 6, 000 FAD entries. For northeast Kansas, 1997 - 2007 median <b>arrival</b> <b>dates</b> were calculated and compared to dates published by Dr. Richard Johnston in 1965. In southcentral Kansas, 1997 - 2007 and 1947 - 1967 median <b>arrival</b> <b>dates</b> were calculated and compared. Temperature data from spring (February through May) were also obtained from the National Climate Data Center's United States Historical Climatology Network for all stations within northeast and south central Kansas and temporal trends were analyzed with linear regression analysis. A comparison between median <b>arrival</b> <b>dates</b> in northeast Kansas found that eleven species had altered their <b>arrival</b> <b>date</b> by a potentially significant number of days. Nine of these had advanced their arrival and two showed a delay. In south central Kansas, nine species were shown to have statistically significant differences in median <b>arrival</b> <b>dates</b> between <b>time</b> periods. Six of these showed an advance and three showed a delay. Five species showed the same trend between both regions, with four arriving earlier by an average 9. 4 days and one delaying by an average of 4. 5 days. Temperature trends for both subregions in Kansas showed significant warming of 1. 8 - 2. 6 °F (1. 0 - 1. 4 °C) over the last century, with the largest warming observed in February and associated strongly with increasing minimum temperatures. The results from this study provide the first evidence that some bird species have recently altered the timing of their arrival in Kansas, with a greater shift toward earlier <b>arrival</b> <b>dates.</b> While the majority of these shifts were correlated with spring warming in Kansas, additional research is necessary to determine the precise cause(s) of these phenological shifts.

Habitat associations, local movements, settling patterns, <b>arrival</b> <b>dates,</b> residency <b>times</b> and survival were estimated from 71 radiomarked pintails during spring 2001, 2003 and 2004, and diet determined from 130 females collected during spring 1998 and 1999. Seventy-two percent of pintail diurnal locations were in palustrine wetlands, 7 % in riverine wetlands, 3 % in lacustrine wetlands, 6 % in municipal sewage lagoons and irrigation reuse pits and 10. 5 % in croplands. Emergent wetlands with hemi-marsh conditions were used diurnally more often than wetlands with either open or closed vegetation structures. Evening foraging flights averaged 4. 3 km (SE = 0. 6) and 72 % were to cornfields. In accord with these findings, 87 % of 93 pintails collected during spring 1998 and 1999 returning to evening roosts consumed corn, which represented 84 % dry mass of all foods. Pintails collected on noncropped wetlands ingested invertebrates and seeds from wetland plants more frequently than birds returning to roost. Radiomarked pintails arrived in Nebraska on 7 March 2003 and 18 February 2004; average <b>arrival</b> <b>date</b> was six days earlier during 2004 compared to 2003.

30|$|Each {{individual}} pallet has {{an acceptable}} window of <b>arrival</b> <b>dates</b> and a strict lower bound on its departure date.

40|$|Electric {{propulsion}} {{has recently}} become a viable technology for spacecraft, enabling shorter flight times, fewer required planetary gravity assists, larger payloads, and/or smaller launch vehicles. With the maturation of this technology, however, comes {{a new set}} of challenges in the area of trajectory design. Because low-thrust trajectory optimization has historically required long run-times and significant user-manipulation, mission design has relied on expert-based knowledge for selecting departure and <b>arrival</b> <b>dates,</b> <b>times</b> of flight, and/or target bodies and gravitational swing-bys. These choices are generally based on known configurations that have worked well in previous analyses or simply on trial and error. At the conceptual design level, however, the ability to explore {{the full extent of the}} design space is imperative to locating the best solutions in terms of mass and/or flight times. Beginning in 2005, the Global Trajectory Optimization Competition posed a series of difficult mission design problems, all requiring low-thrust propulsion and visiting one or more asteroids. These problems all had large ranges on the continuous variables - launch <b>date,</b> <b>time</b> of flight, and asteroid stay times (when applicable) - as well as being characterized by millions or even billions of possible asteroid sequences. Even with recent advances in low-thrust trajectory optimization, full enumeration of these problems was not possible within the stringent time limits of the competition. This investigation develops a systematic methodology for determining a broad suite of good solutions to the combinatorial, low-thrust, asteroid tour problem. The target application is for conceptual design, where broad exploration of the design space is critical, with the goal being to rapidly identify a reasonable number of promising solutions for future analysis. The proposed methodology has two steps. The first step applies a three-level heuristic sequence developed from the physics of the problem, which allows for efficient pruning of the design space. The second phase applies a global optimization scheme to locate a broad suite of good solutions to the reduced problem. The global optimization scheme developed combines a novel branch-and-bound algorithm with a genetic algorithm and an industry-standard low-thrust trajectory optimization program to solve for the following design variables: asteroid sequence, launch <b>date,</b> <b>times</b> of flight, and asteroid stay times. The methodology is developed based on a small sample problem, which is enumerated and solved so that all possible discretized solutions are known. The methodology is then validated by applying it to a larger intermediate sample problem, which also has a known solution. Next, the methodology is applied to several larger combinatorial asteroid rendezvous problems, using previously identified good solutions as validation benchmarks. These problems include the 2 nd and 3 rd Global Trajectory Optimization Competition problems. The methodology is shown to be capable of achieving a reduction in the number of asteroid sequences of 6 - 7 orders of magnitude, in terms of the number of sequences that require low-thrust optimization as compared to the number of sequences in the original problem. More than 70 % of the previously known good solutions are identified, along with several new solutions that were not previously reported by any of the competitors. Overall, the methodology developed in this investigation provides an organized search technique for the low-thrust mission design of asteroid rendezvous problems. Ph. D.

40|$|The {{behaviour}} of long-distance {{migratory birds}} {{is assumed to}} partly be {{under the influence of}} genes, as demonstrated by selection experiments.

40|$|Abstract Phenology is an {{important}} part of life history that is gaining increased attention because of recent climate change. We use game theory to model phenological adaptation in migratory birds that compete for territories at their breeding grounds. We investigate how the evolutionarily stable strategy (ESS) for the timing of arrival is affected by changes in the onset of spring, the timing of the resource peak, and the season length. We compare the ESS mean <b>arrival</b> <b>date</b> with the environmental optimum, that is, the mean <b>arrival</b> <b>date</b> that maximizes fitness in the absence of competition. When competition is strong, the ESS mean <b>arrival</b> <b>date</b> responds less than the environmental optimum to shifts in the resource peak but more to changes in the onset of spring. Increased season length may not necessarily affect the environmental optimum but can still advance the ESS mean <b>arrival</b> <b>date.</b> Conversely, shifting a narrow resource distribution may change the environmental optimum without affecting the ESS mean <b>arrival</b> <b>date.</b> The ESS mean <b>arrival</b> <b>date</b> and the environmental optimum may even shift in different directions. Hence, treating phenology as an evolutionary game rather than an optimization problem fundamentally changes what we predict to be an adaptive response to environmental changes...|$|R
40|$|When {{assessing}} {{the benefits of}} early <b>arrival</b> <b>date</b> of migratory birds, a hidden and often ignored component of males 2 ̆ 7 fitness is the higher chance of early-arriving birds to obtain extra-pair fertilizations. Here we investigated how extra-pair paternity might affect the relationship between male <b>arrival</b> <b>date</b> and number of fertilizations in a model study system, the European pied flycatcher Ficedula hypoleuca. For this purpose, we sampled and genotyped breeding pairs, unpaired males and offspring (including embryos from unhatched eggs when possible) of a Dutch pied flycatcher population. Detailed information on <b>arrival</b> <b>date</b> of males, egg laying date of their social mates and nest success was also recorded. Early-arriving males had early-laying females and males with early-laying females had a higher probability of siring extra-pair eggs and obtain more fertilizations. However, male <b>arrival</b> <b>date</b> alone did not correlate with the probability to gain extra-pair paternity and neither {{to the amount of}} fertilized eggs. Both early- and late-arriving males had a higher probability of losing paternity in their own nest compared to birds with an intermediate <b>arrival</b> <b>date.</b> Finally, late-arriving males were more likely to remain unpaired but, interestingly, a few of these birds obtained paternity via extra-pair copulations. Because earlier <b>arrival</b> <b>date</b> did not lead to more extra-pair fertilizations and because such relationship seems to be driven mainly by the female 2 ̆ 7 s laying date, we conclude that the contribution of extra-pair paternity to the overall fitness benefits of early male <b>arrival</b> <b>date</b> is relatively small...|$|R

40|$|We {{tested the}} novel {{hypothesis}} that <b>arrival</b> <b>date</b> in migratory birds represents a reliable indicator of male quality {{that can be}} used by females as a cue in extrapair mating decisions. Secondary sexual characters are often condition-dependent, and competition for early arrival leads to condition-dependent migration. Hence, both secondary sexual characters and <b>arrival</b> <b>date</b> are predicted to be condition-dependent indicators of male phenotypic quality. We studied the relationship between expression of a secondary sexual character, <b>arrival</b> <b>date,</b> and condition, respectively, and extrapair paternity in a Spanish population of barn swallows, Hirundo rustica. By using microsatellite markers to determine paternity, we showed that 17. 8 % of all offspring (N = 674) and 32. 4 % of all broods (N = 170) were due to extrapair paternity. Quasi-parasitism (in which the male nest owner fathered the offspring, but the eggs were laid by another female) occurred in 2. 6 % of all nestlings and 2. 9 % of all broods. Individuals were consistent in the frequency of extrapair paternity among first, second, and third broods. Males with long outermost tail feathers, arriving early and in prime body condition, had little extrapair paternity in their nests. This was also the case when controlling for the confounding effects of male age. Partial correlation analysis was used to investigate the direct and indirect effects of tail length, <b>arrival</b> <b>date,</b> and body condition on extrapair paternity. Body condition accounted for most of the variance in extrapair paternity, whereas tail length and <b>arrival</b> <b>date</b> accounted for a smaller proportion of the variance. Body condition was strongly correlated with tail length and <b>arrival</b> <b>date.</b> However, because females cannot directly assess condition or <b>arrival</b> <b>date</b> (males arrive before females), females may obtain an indirect measure of condition and migration ability from tail length and other phenotypic traits of males. This suggests that extrapair paternity depends on the effects of condition, through its indirect effects on <b>arrival</b> <b>date,</b> tail length, and other variables. Copyright 2003. ...|$|R

For a shorebird population that has significantly advanced migration in recent decades, we show that individual <b>arrival</b> <b>dates</b> are highly consistent between years, but that the <b>arrival</b> <b>dates</b> of new recruits to the population are significantly earlier now than in previous years. Several mechanisms could drive {{advances in}} recruit arrival, none of which require individual plasticity or rapid evolution of migration timings.

This mechanism could also explain why <b>arrival</b> <b>dates</b> of short-distance migrants, which generally return to breeding sites earlier and have greater scope for advance laying, are advancing more rapidly than long-distance migrants...|$|R
40|$|In migratory birds, <b>arrival</b> <b>date</b> and {{hatching}} date are two key phenological markers {{that have}} responded to global warming. A body of knowledge exists relating these traits to evolutionary pressures. In this study, we formalize this knowledge into general mathematical assumptions, and use them in an ecoevolutionary model. In contrast to previous models, this study novelty accounts for both traits-arrival date and hatching date-and the interdependence between them, revealing when one, the other or both will respond to climate. For all models sharing the assumptions, the following phenological responses will occur. First, if the nestling-prey peak is late enough, hatching is synchronous with, and <b>arrival</b> <b>date</b> evolves independently of, prey phenology. Second, when resource availability constrains {{the length of the}} pre-laying period, hatching is adaptively asynchronous with prey phenology. Predictions for both traits compare well with empirical observations. In response to advancing prey phenology, <b>arrival</b> <b>date</b> may advance, remain unchanged, or even become delayed; the latter occurring when egg-laying resources are only available relatively late in the season. The model shows that asynchronous hatching and unresponsive <b>arrival</b> <b>date</b> are not sufficient evidence that phenological adaptation is constrained. The work provides a framework for exploring microevolution of interdependent phenological traits...|$|R

40|$|Climate {{change has}} {{advanced}} the phenology of many organisms. Migratory animals face particular problems because {{climate change in}} the breeding and the wintering range may be asynchronous, preventing rapid response to changing conditions. Advancement in timing of spring migration may have carry-over effects {{to other parts of}} the annual cycle, simply because advancement of one event in the annual cycle also advances subsequent events, gradually causing a general shift in the timing of the entire annual cycle. Such a phenotypic shift could generate accumulating effects over the years for individuals, but also across generations. Here we test this novel hypothesis of phenotypic response to climate change by using long-term data on the Arctic tern Sterna paradisaea. Mean breeding date advanced by almost three weeks during the last 70 years. Annual <b>arrival</b> <b>date</b> at the breeding grounds during a period of 47 years was predicted by environmental conditions in the winter quarters in the Southern Ocean near the Antarctic and by mean breeding date the previous year. Annual mean breeding date was only marginally determined by timing of arrival the current year, but to a larger extent by <b>arrival</b> <b>date</b> and breeding date the previous year. Learning affected <b>arrival</b> <b>date</b> as shown by a positive correlation between <b>arrival</b> <b>date</b> in year (i + 1) relative to breeding date in year (i) and the selective advantage of early breeding in year (i). This provides a mechanism for changes in <b>arrival</b> <b>date</b> being adjusted to changing environmental conditions. This study suggests that adaptation to changing climatic conditions can be achieved through learning from year to yea...|$|R
40|$|Objective To {{investigate}} {{factors associated}} with unscheduled admission following presentation to emergency departments (EDs) at three hospitals in England. Design and setting Cross-sectional analysis of attendance data for patients from three urban EDs in England: a large teaching hospital and major trauma centre (site 1) and two district general hospitals (sites 2 and 3). Variables included patient age, gender, ethnicity, deprivation score, <b>arrival</b> <b>date</b> and <b>time,</b> <b>arrival</b> by ambulance or otherwise, a variety of ED workload measures, inpatient bed occupancy rates and admission outcome. Coding inconsistencies in routine ED data {{used for this study}} meant that diagnosis could not be included. Outcome measure The primary outcome for the study was unscheduled admission. Participants All adults aged 16 and older attending the three inner London EDs in December 2013. Data on 19 734 unique patient attendances were gathered. Results Outcome data were available for 19 721 attendances (> 99 %), of whom 6263 (32 %) were admitted to hospital. Site 1 was set as the baseline site for analysis of admission risk. Risk of admission was significantly greater at sites 2 and 3 (adjusted OR (AOR) relative to site 1 for site 2 was 1. 89, 95 % CI 1. 74 to 2. 05, p< 0. 001) and for patients of black or black British ethnicity (AOR 1. 29, 1. 16 to 1. 44, p< 0. 001). Deprivation was strongly associated with admission. Analysis of departmental and hospital-wide workload pressures gave conflicting results, but proximity to the “ 4 -hour target” (a rule that limits patient stays in EDs to 4 hours in the National Health Service in England) emerged as a strong driver for admission in this analysis (AOR 3. 61, 95 % CI 3. 30 to 3. 95, p< 0. 001). Conclusion This study found statistically significant variations in odds of admission between hospital sites when adjusting for various patient demographic and presentation factors, suggesting important variations in ED-level and clinician-level behaviour relating to admission decisions. The 4 -hour target is a strong driver for emergency admission...|$|R

40|$|International audienceRecent {{changes in}} {{migration}} distances and propensity for migration associated with climate change {{have suggested that}} these traits can evolve rapidly. Part of this rapid response to selection {{may be due to}} maternal effects that facilitate changes in the underlying physiology of migration. We hypothesize that exposure to large amounts of antioxidants in the egg will facilitate assimilation and metabolism of dietary antioxidants later in life, thereby allowing offspring to better cope with extreme strenuous exercise such as the bursts of rapid migration shown during spring migration. We tested the relationship between temporal change in mean <b>arrival</b> <b>date</b> of migratory birds since 1960 and concentrations of 2 antioxidants in the eggs of 14 species of birds. Only egg concentration of vitamin E {{was a significant predictor of}} advancement in spring <b>arrival</b> <b>date.</b> Furthermore, we experimentally manipulated egg content of vitamin E in barn swallows Hirundo rustica and subsequently recorded <b>arrival</b> <b>date</b> of yearling male recruits. <b>Arrival</b> <b>date</b> advanced significantly by > 1 standard deviation due to treatment, providing experimental evidence for a relationship between egg concentration of vitamin E and subsequent migration behavior. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that maternal effects have played an important role in the evolution of bird migration...|$|R

We analyzed {{the effects of}} temperature anomaly on <b>arrival</b> <b>date</b> and infestation severity of potato leafhopper, Empoasca fabae Harris, a classic new world long distance migrant, and a significant pest in several agricultural crops. We compiled E. fabae <b>arrival</b> <b>dates</b> and infestation severity data at different states in USA from existing literature reviews and agricultural extension records from 1951 - 2012, and examined the influence of temperature anomalies at each target state or overwintering range on the <b>date</b> of <b>arrival</b> and severity of infestation. Average E. fabae <b>arrival</b> <b>date</b> at different states reveal a clear trend along the south-north axis, with earliest arrival closest to the overwintering range. E. fabae arrival has advanced by 10 days over the last 62 years. E. fabae arrived earlier in warmer years in relation to each target state level temperature anomaly (3. 0 days / °C increase in temperature anomaly). Increased temperature had a significant and {{positive effect on the}} severity of infestation, and <b>arrival</b> <b>date</b> had a marginal negative effect on severity. These relationships suggest that continued warming could advance the time of E. fabae colonization and increase their impact on affected crops...|$|R
40|$|Urbanization has {{a marked}} {{effect on the}} {{reproduction}} and other ecological and behavioural traits of many living organisms, including birds. In migrant birds, survival and reproductive output {{is influenced by the}} (mis) synchronization of arrival with the availability of resources. Many recent studies have shown that arrival timing is related to temperatures en-route and at destination. Because urban areas are "heat islands", with higher temperatures that influence earlier vegetation and invertebrate development, this should favour earlier arrival of migrant birds to cities rather than to rural areas. In this paper, we analysed differences between urban and rural habitats in mean dates and trends of first <b>arrival</b> <b>dates</b> of 18 species of migratory bird species in western Poland during 1983 - 2010. For many individual species, and overall, mean first <b>arrival</b> <b>date</b> was significantly earlier in rural areas than in urban areas (significant for 11 species). However, the trend towards earlier first <b>arrival</b> <b>dates</b> was stronger in urban areas for 15 of the 18 species (significantly stronger in four species). Consequently, <b>arrival</b> <b>dates</b> in urban areas are fast approaching, or have now matched or passed those in rural areas. These findings suggest that recent environmental changes may have more rapidly changed the migratory habits of birds occupying urban habitats than those occupying rural habitats...|$|R
