40|$|AbstractHookworms, {{together}} with other helminthes infestations, were serious health problems in Taiwan before. With improvements in public health and medicine, the prevalence of parasite infestations drops significantly and current attention has been shifted to foreign laborers coming from the Southeast Asia. Herein we reported a case of hookworm infestation who presented as subacute diarrhea. Initially, only peripheral eosinophilia was revealed. Anti-helminth treatment, but not the immunosuppressant for eosinophilic gastroenteritis, was given when the hookworm ova were finally harvested after repeated stool examinations. Please remember the old diseases when you meet a patient with gastrointestinal complaints and peripheral eosinophilia, especially when there are intermittent skin atopic manifestations. Repeated <b>parasite</b> ova <b>checks</b> with concentration method are necessary in acute stage, especially when the worm burden is not heavy...|$|R
40|$|Background: Giardiasis is a one of {{the most}} {{prevalent}} intestinal parasitic diseases in human, treatment of this disease through medicinal plants is very important since parasite resistance to chemical drugs exists. Thus, in this study, the in vitro anti-giardial activity of chloroformic extract of Tanacetum parthenium and Artemisia annua on cyst and trophozoite of Giardia lamblia were separately investigated. Materials and Methods: In this experimental study chloroformic extracts of Artemisia annua and Tanacetum parthenium on cyst and trophozoite of G. lamblia in vitro were prepared in 1, 10, 50 and 100 mg∕ml concentrations for 5, 10, 30, 60 and 180 min. Purified cysts were used for encystations and culture in TYI-S- 33 medium. Then, 2 ml of each solution was placed in test tubes, to which 10, 000 washed cysts and trophozoites were added. The contents of the tubes were gently mixed and incubated. The percentages of dead parasites were determined by counting 500 cysts. Non treated parasites were considered a control group in each experiment and the viability of the <b>parasites</b> <b>checked</b> with Eeosin staining and statistical analysis were done. Results: The results showed that chloroformic extracts of A. annua at 100 mg/ml concentration affected on Gardia cyst 86 % and 100 % trophozoite after 1 hour. T. parthenium at 50 mg/ml concentration killed cysts (83 %) and trophozite (100 %) after 1 hour, respectively. T. parthenium chloroformic extract had a better effect on cyst and trophozoite of Giardia at 50 mg/ml after 1 hour exposure than A. annua extract. Conclusion: According to this study, A. annua and T. parthenium chlorofomic extracts could be considered as a more effective anti-giardial agent. Chloroformic extract of T. parthenium was also shown the anti-giardial activity compared with A. annua and control groups at all exposure times. Therefore, in the future research using these plants are recommended against Giardia in low concentration in the in vivo, also to find fractions of the pharmacological effects of these plants...|$|R
40|$|Using hypotonically permeabilized Toxoplasma gondii tachyzoites, we {{investigated}} the topology {{of the free}} glycosylphosphatidylinositols (GPIs) within the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane. The morphology and permeability of <b>parasites</b> were <b>checked</b> by electron microscopy and release of a cytosolic protein. The membrane integrity of organelles (ER and rhoptries) was checked by protease protection assays. In initial experiments, GPI biosynthetic intermediates were labeled with UDP-[6 - 3 H]GlcNAc in permeabilized parasites, and the transmembrane distribution of the radiolabeled lipids was probed with phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C (PI-PLC). A new early intermediate with an acyl modification on the inositol was identified, indicating that inositol acylation also occurs in T. gondii. A {{significant portion of the}} early GPI intermediates (GlcN-PI and GlcNAc-PI) could be hydrolyzed following PI-PLC treatment, indicating that these glycolipids are predominantly present in the cytoplasmic leaflet of the ER. Permeabilized T. gondii parasites labeled with either GDP-[2 - 3 H]mannose or UDP-[6 - 3 H]glucose showed that the more mannosylated and side chain (Glc-GalNAc) -modified GPI intermediates are also preferentially localized in the cytoplasmic leaflet of the ER...|$|R

This study determined whether apoptotic machinery is operable to keep the <b>parasite</b> population under <b>check.</b> Methods A synchronized culture of P. falciparum (Dd 2 strain) was initiated at 0. 5 % ring stage parasitaemia and kept under conditions not limiting for RBCs and nutrient by adjusting hematocrit to 5 % at each schizogony and changing growth media daily. Parasite growth pattern and morphology was evaluated by blood smear microscopy and flow-cytometry using SYBR green. The apoptotic processes were evaluated for evidence of: DNA fragmentation by TUNEL, collapse of mitochondria membrane potential (ΔΨ m) by TMRE, expression of metacaspse gene by RT-qPCR and by probing parasite proteins with anti-caspase antibodies. Results From the seeding parasitaemia of 0. 5 %, the parasites doubled every 48 hours to a parasitaemia of 4 %. Thereafter, the growth stagnated and the culture consistently crashed at about 6 % parasitaemia. ΔΨ m potential collapsed as the parasite density increased and DNA fragmentation increased steadily from 0. 2 % to ~ 6 %. The expression of metacaspase gene and protein was observed in all stages, but their abundance was variable among the stages.

40|$|Background: Diarrhea {{is one of}} {{the main}} public health {{problems}} occurring in West Java. One of the affected areas is Subdistrict Jatinangor. Inappropriate management of sanitation facilities around Jatinangor area causes contamination of water. Cikeruh River {{is one of the}} water sources in Jatinangor Area, from which people obtain water for daily activities. Water borne illness due to poor sanitation condition can lead to parasitic infection such as Giardia lamblia, Entamoeba histolytica and Cryptosporidium parvum which can cause a prolonged diarrhea. There has not been any study done regarding the presence of parasitical infection causing diarrhea around Jatinangor. Methods: In order to identify the parasitic infection, a descriptive study was carried out on 16 fecal samples collected from diarrheal patient who visited Puskesmas Jatinangor from September–November 2012. The <b>parasites</b> were <b>checked</b> by using wet mount method Results: The parasites found were Entamoeba histolytica, Cryptosporidium parvum, but none of Giardia lamblia. There were also other findings such as Iodamoeba butschlii and Entamoeba coli. Conclusion: Positive findings of Entamoeba histolytica and Cryptosporidium parvum in diarrhea patients is most probably due to contaminated water and food.

40|$|Cultured striped trumpeter Latris lineata {{was held}} in sea cage systems or a {{land-based}} facility in south-eastern Tasmania. Visual checks of metazoan ectoparasites were conducted on six cohorts (T 1 to T 6) in the land-based facility from 2006 to 2007, and three cohorts (C 1 to C 3) held in cages from 2007 to 2008. Three parasite species were recorded; a cymothoid Ceratothoa banksii; a chondracanthid Chondracanthus goldsmidi; and a caligid Caligus nuenonnae. All three parasite species were present on the striped trumpeter in the sea cages with C. nuenonnae and C. goldsmidi found in very low prevalence on all cohorts. There was no significant effect of cohort or season on the parasites' prevalence or intensity. Cohort C 1 had the highest numbers of C. nuenonnae with prevalence of 2. 5 % (intensity 1. 0 ± 0. 0 parasites fish− 1), whilst cohort C 3 had the highest prevalence of C. goldsmidi (3. 3 %, intensity 1. 0 ± 0. 0). The isopod C. banksii was recorded in increasing prevalence in cohorts C 1 and C 2 during 2008, cohort C 1 had a prevalence ranging from 9. 8 % (intensity 1. 0 ± 0. 0) to 17. 5 % (intensity 1 ± 0. 0) whereas prevalence in cohort C 2 ranged from 27. 7 % (intensity 1. 21 ± 0. 1) to 67. 2 % (intensity 1. 8 ± 0. 1). The two copepod species were recorded on the fish held in the land-based facility. C. nuenonnae was found on fish from two cohorts at a prevalence of 22. 3 % (intensity 1. 4 ± 0. 1 parasites) in cohort T 1 and 4. 3 % (1. 0 ± 0. 0) in cohort T 2. In contrast, C. goldsmidi was present during all <b>parasite</b> <b>checks</b> of cohorts T 2 to T 6 with the percentage of infected fish ranging from 27. 2 % (intensity 1. 3 ± 0. 1) in cohort T 2 to 100 % (intensity 32. 8 ± 1. 9) in cohort T 4. Treatments against C. goldsmidi were conducted on cohorts T 2 to T 6 including manual removal of adult parasites and Neguvon baths. There was no apparent reduction in the parasite prevalence within season during follow-up surveys after ~ 6 months. An eleven month re-infection experiment was conducted with C. goldsmidi; striped trumpeter from which parasites were removed showed significantly lower prevalence (F = 161. 8, df 1, 20, P less than 0. 001) than those fish from which parasites were not removed. The study suggests that effective control of parasitic crustaceans {{is likely to be}} an important factor in the successful culture of sea-caged striped trumpeter...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Objective The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to investigate whether the infection of C 57 BL/ 6 mice by P. berghei ANKA, which causes severe malaria, was modulated by co-infection with Trypanosoma cruzi. Methods Groups of C 57 BL/ 6 mice were infected either with P. berghei ANKA, T. cruzi strain G, or with both parasites. The presence of <b>parasites</b> was <b>checked</b> by microscopic examination of blood samples. Symptoms of neurological or respiratory disorders, as well as mortality, were registered. Breakdown of the blood brain barrier was determined by injecting the dye Evans blue. Histological sections of the lung were prepared and stained with hematoxilin-eosin. Results All mice infected only with P. berghei ANKA died within 7 – 11 days post-infection, either with symptoms of cerebral malaria or with respiratory abnormalities. The animals co-infected with T. cruzi strain G survived longer, without any of the referred to symptoms. Protection against the early death by severe malaria was effective when mice were given T. cruzi 15 days before P. berghei inoculation. Breakdown of the blood brain barrier and extensive pulmonary oedema, caused by malaria parasites, were much less pronounced in co-infected mice. The degree of protection to severe malaria and early death, conferred by co-infection with T. cruzi, was comparable to that conferred by treatment with anti-CD 8 antibodies. Conclusion Co-infection with T. cruzi protects C 57 BL/ 6 against the early death by malaria infection, by partially preventing either the breakdown of the blood brain, and cerebral malaria as a consequence, or the pulmonary oedema. </p...|$|R
40|$|Background: Malaria is a {{major public}} health problem in the world, but {{treatment}} of malaria is becoming more difficult due to increasing drug resistance. Therefore, the need for alternative drugs is acute. Aims: This study investigated the antiplasmodial and protective effect of an ethanolic extract of the leaves from a traditionally used medicinal plant, Azadirachta indica (Neem) in a mouse model of malaria. Materials and Methods: Swiss albino mice were intraperitoneally infected with 10 x 106 Plasmodium berghei ANKA, a rodent malaria parasite. The presence of <b>parasites</b> was <b>checked</b> by microscopic examination of blood samples daily. Ethanolic extracts of Neem at 300, 500 and 1000 mg/kg were administered intraperitoneally daily for five days from the day parasitaemia reach 5 % of parasite inoculation. Intraperitoneal chloroquine and artemether were used as standard drug treatment controls. Symptoms of neurological or respiratory disorder, mortality, weight and temperature were recorded. Histological sections of brain were prepared and examined after staining with hematoxylin-eosin and immunohistochemistry for apoptotic cells. Results: All Neem treatment groups displayed parasitaemia that gradually increased during treatment, and showed signs of terminal illness (i. e. hypothermia, ptosis and convulsions) within 2 – 4 days post-treatment. In contrast, the chloroquine and artemether groups showed no cerebral malaria symptoms and no deaths. Apoptosis in Purkinje cells, cerebral haemorrhage and oedema were found {{in some of the}} mice treated with Neem and chloroquine. Conclusions: Azadirachta indica (Neem) extract was not protective against malaria symptoms and signs in this mouse model. However, a difference in the number of apoptotic Purkinje cells between the untreated control group and Neem treatment at 500 mg/kg suggests that Neem may have some neuronal protective effect...|$|R
40|$|Background and Aim: Leishmanization (LZ) is an {{effective}} tool to prevent cutaneous leishmaniasis. Standardization of Leishmania is {{the main drawback of}} LZ. The aim {{of this study was to}} assess the effect of various preservatives on the infectivity of Leishmania. Methods: L. major harvested at different stages of growth; logarithmic, early and late stationary phases were frozen using various preservatives of saccharose, glycerol, trehalose, glucose, sorbitol, and dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO). The harvested parasites were inoculated into BALB/c mice before and after freezing. The infectivity of the <b>parasites</b> was <b>checked.</b> IFA test was used to assess the rate of metacyclic parasite. Results: The ratio of live Leishmania in different growth stages and various preservatives were 89. 0 % to 98. 2 %. The lesion development in groups of mice which received Leishmania in sacarose + glycerol or DMSO was started from 3 rd week and at 5 th week all the mice showed lesion. The group of mice which were inoculated with early or late stationary phases in saccharose + glucose, saccharose + glycerol, glycerol 15 % or DMSO showed lesion from 4 th to 5 th week and in 100 % showed lesions at 8 th week. The rate of metacyclic parasites increases from log phase to early and late stationary phases. Conclusion: There was a correlation between percent of live parasite and the rate of lesion development in BALB/c mice. Saccharose 22. 5 % + Glyserol 22. 5 % were the most appropriate preservative to freeze L. major. IFA test is used to detect metacyclic Leishmania.

40|$|The {{golden hamster}} (Mesocricetus auratus) is a {{susceptible}} model to Leishmania (Viannia) spp.; however, available studies employ different infection protocols, {{which account for}} clinical and pathological presentation differences. Herein, L. (V.) braziliensis preparations were standardized to contain 104, 105, or 106 parasites to determine an optimal inoculum that ensured cutaneous lesions without causing a disseminated infection in hamsters. Lesion development was followed for 105 days by size measurements, and skin, draining lymph node, spleen, and sera were investigated to <b>check</b> <b>parasite</b> load, spleen visceralization, cytokine expression, histopathological changes, and anti-Leishmania IgG levels. The lesion emergence time was inversely proportional to the parasite concentration in the inocula. Animals infected by 104 parasites presented nodular lesions, while those infected with 106 parasites often exhibited ulcerated lesions. The differences in the final lesion sizes were observed between 104 and 105 inocula or 104 and 106 inocula. High IFNG expression, anti-Leishmania IgG levels, and parasite load occurred independently of the inoculum used. A mild inflammatory skin involvement was observed in animals infected with 104 parasites, while extensive tissue damage and parasite spleen visceralization occurred with 105 and 106 parasites. These results indicate that inocula with different concentrations of parasites generate differences {{in the time of}} lesion emergence, clinical presentation, and systemic commitment, despite high and similar IFNG expression and parasite load. This suggests that a modulation in the immune response to different parasite numbers occurs in an early phase of the infection, which could dictate the establishment and magnitude of the chronic phase of the disease...|$|R
40|$|Manipulation by parasites is a catchy {{concept that}} {{has been applied to}} a large range of {{phenotypic}} alterations brought about by parasites in their hosts. It has, for instance, been suggested that the carotenoid-based colour of acanthocephalan cystacanths is adaptive through increasing the conspicuousness of infected intermediate hosts and, hence, their vulnerability to appropriate final hosts such as fish predators. We revisited the evidence in favour of adaptive coloration of acanthocephalan parasites in relation to increased trophic transmission using the crustacean amphipod Gammarus pulex and two species of acanthocephalans, Pomphorhynchus laevis and Polymorphus minutus. Both species show carotenoid-based colorations, but rely, respectively, on freshwater fish and aquatic bird species as final hosts. In addition, the two parasites differ in the type of behavioural alteration brought to their common intermediate host. Pomphorhynchus laevis reverses negative phototaxis in G. pulex, whereas P. minutus reverses positive geotaxis. In aquaria, trout showed selective predation for P. laevis-infected gammarids, whereas P. minutus-infected ones did not differ from uninfected controls in their vulnerability to predation. We tested for an effect of parasite coloration on increased trophic transmission by painting a yellow–orange spot on the cuticle of uninfected gammarids and by masking the yellow–orange spot of infected individuals with inconspicuous brown paint. To enhance realism, match of colour between painted mimics and true <b>parasite</b> was carefully <b>checked</b> using a spectrometer. We found no evidence for a role of parasite coloration in the increased vulnerability of gammarids to predation by trout. Painted mimics did not differ from control uninfected gammarids in their vulnerability to predation by trout. In addition, covering the place through which the parasite was visible did not reduce the vulnerability of infected gammarids to predation by trout. We discuss alternative evolutionary explanations for the origin and maintenance of carotenoid-based colorations in acanthocephalan parasites...|$|R
