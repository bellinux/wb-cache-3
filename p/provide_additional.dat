5|$|An {{alternate}} route for developing emergency medicine is to <b>provide</b> <b>additional</b> training for other specialists to equip them {{to practice in}} emergency medicine. This has the benefit of being more rapid to implement, as physicians already trained in other areas can add the necessary emergency skills to their repertoire. However, after the initial expansion {{it is difficult for}} emergency medicine to progress further in nations that adopt this strategy, as the retrained practitioners identify more with their original specialty and have less incentive to continue to press for further innovations in emergency medicine.|$|E

5|$|In November 1912, a {{bill was}} publicised under the LER name that {{included}} a plan to extend the Piccadilly tube tracks westwards from Hammersmith to connect to the L's Richmond branch tracks.

The bill received assent as the London Electric Railway Act, 1913 on 15 August 1913. The advent of World War I prevented work on the extension starting. Post-war, a shortage of funds and other priorities meant that the extension was postponed until the early 1930s.|$|E
5|$|Modern steels {{are made}} with varying {{combinations}} of alloy metals to fulfill many purposes. Carbon steel, composed simply of iron and carbon, accounts for 90% of steel production. Low alloy steel is alloyed with other elements, usually molybdenum, manganese, chromium, or nickel, in amounts of up to 10% by weight to improve the hardenability of thick sections. High strength low alloy steel has small additions (usually < 2% by weight) of other elements, typically 1.5% manganese, to <b>provide</b> <b>additional</b> strength for a modest price increase.|$|E
