40|$|Introduction of <b>piggy-back</b> <b>transport</b> aspect as a {{sub-system}} of multi-modal transport, {{especially the}} latest "C" technology, enables efficiency of capital {{investments in the}} order of 17 - 20 %, reduces transportation costs throughout the transportation chain as compared to traditional traffic aspects by 40 % (on the average), increases productivity at least by 500 % while the capital equipment writes off in ll years (2 to 3 times quicker than upon investments in traditional transport aspects}. From the listed quite interesting results obtained in progressive nations (Federal Republic of Germany, United States, etc.) originates the need for a more vigorous introduction of <b>piggy-back</b> <b>transport</b> in our country. In all basic Yugoslav documents for the term period of up to the year 2000 (medium-term and long- term) the orientation towards a more timely introduction of these new transport technologies has been supported. </p...|$|R

40|$|We have {{isolated}} mutants of Escherichia coli {{that have}} an altered beta-galactoside <b>transport</b> <b>system.</b> This altered <b>transport</b> <b>system</b> is able to transport a sugar, maltose, that the wild-type beta-galactoside <b>transport</b> <b>system</b> is unable to transport. The mutation that alters the specificity of the <b>transport</b> <b>system</b> is in the lacY gene, and we refer to the allele as lacYmal. The lacYmal allele was detected originally in strains in which the lac genes were fused to the malF gene. Thus, {{as a result of}} gene fusion and isolation of the lacYmal mutation, a new <b>transport</b> <b>system</b> was evolved with regulatory properties and specificity {{similar to those of the}} original maltose <b>transport</b> <b>system.</b> Maltose <b>transport</b> via the lacYmal gene product is independent of all of the normal maltose <b>transport</b> <b>system</b> components.

40|$|There are two <b>transport</b> <b>systems</b> used by {{agricultural}} businesses {{engaged in}} primary production. These are <b>transport</b> <b>systems</b> involving tractors and motorized vehicles. <b>Transport</b> <b>systems</b> involving tractors {{are made up}} of motorized vehicles and vehicles that are Toled Grand Super, or more specifically, a motor vehicle plus one or more vehicles that are towed along. A motorized vehicle refers to an agricultural traktor John Deere 6620. Motorized <b>transport</b> <b>systems</b> are comprised of Lorries Tatra 815 Agro. A lorry can only have one additional vehicle connected to itself. The <b>transport</b> <b>systems</b> mentioned above can be used in agricultural businesses engaged in primary production along with similar or identical productions. Motorized <b>transport</b> <b>systems</b> used in agricultural primary production are in the majority of cases applied to additional productions. This is the given <b>transport</b> <b>system</b> framework, which can be setup with adaptations for various uses. It therefore follows that the possibilities of comparing <b>transport</b> <b>systems</b> using universal undercarriages are increased. Expenditure associated with these <b>transport</b> <b>systems,</b> are easily compared. It is also possible to easily compare <b>transport</b> <b>systems</b> involving tractors with motorized <b>transport</b> <b>systems</b> {{as long as there is}} no need for more vehicles connected to them. It is obvious that the use of motorized <b>transport</b> <b>systems</b> for longer distances is preferable to <b>transport</b> <b>systems</b> involving tractors. Expenses for every driven kilometre with the comparable <b>transport</b> <b>systems</b> show a significant difference in cost. This difference is 36, 85 Kč.

40|$|The use of kinetic {{equations}} of NO 3 - <b>transport</b> <b>systems</b> in {{oilseed rape}} (Brassica napus), determined by 15 NO 3 - labeling under controlled conditions, combined with experimental field {{data from the}} INRA-Châlons rape database were used to model NO 3 - uptake during the plant growth cycle. The quantitative effects of different factors such as day/night cycle, ontogenetic stages, root temperature, photosynthetically active radiation, and soil nitrate availability on different components of the constitutive high-affinity <b>transport</b> <b>systems,</b> constitutive low-affinity <b>transport</b> <b>systems,</b> inducible low-affinity <b>transport</b> <b>systems,</b> and inducible high-affinity <b>transport</b> <b>systems</b> of nitrate were then determined to improve the model's predictions. Simulated uptake correlated well with measured values of nitrogen (N) uptake under field conditions for all N fertilization rates tested. Model outputs showed that the high-affinity <b>transport</b> <b>system</b> accounted for about 89 % of total NO 3 - uptake (18 % and 71 % for constitutive high-affinity <b>transport</b> <b>systems</b> and inducible high-affinity <b>transport</b> <b>systems,</b> respectively) when no fertilizer was applied. The low-affinity <b>transport</b> <b>system</b> accounted for a minor proportion of total N uptake, and its activity was restricted to the early phase of the growth cycle. However, N fertilization in spring increased the duration of its contribution to total N uptake. Overall, data show that this mechanistic and environmentally regulated approach is a powerful means to simulate total N uptake in the field with the advantage of taking both physiologically regulated processes at the overall plant level and specific nitrate <b>transport</b> <b>system</b> characteristics into account...|$|R
40|$|Human skin {{fibroblasts}} from 'normal' {{subjects were}} found to possess at least two hexose <b>transport</b> <b>systems.</b> One system {{was responsible for the}} uptake of 2 -deoxy-D-glucose (dGlc), D-glucose and D-galactose, whereas the other was responsible primarily for the uptake of 3 -O-methyl-D-glucose (MeGlc). The transport of dGlc was the rate-limiting step in the uptake process; over 97 % of the internalized dGlc was phosphorylated and the specific activity of hexokinase was several times higher than that for dGlc transport. The dGlc <b>transport</b> <b>system</b> was activated by glucose starvation, and was very sensitive to inhibition by cytochalasin B and energy uncouplers. Fibroblasts isolated from a patient with symptoms of hypoglycaemia {{were found to}} differ from their normal counterparts in the dGlc <b>transport</b> <b>system.</b> They exhibited a much higher transport affinity for dGlc, D-glucose and D-galactose, with no change in the respective transport capacity. Transport was not the rate-limiting step in dGlc uptake by these cells. Moreover, the patient's dGlc <b>transport</b> <b>system</b> was no longer sensitive to inhibition by cytochalasin B and energy uncouplers. This suggested that the intrinsic properties of the patient's dGlc <b>transport</b> <b>system</b> were altered. It {{should be noted that the}} patient's dGlc <b>transport</b> <b>system</b> could still be activated by glucose starvation. Despite the changes in the dGlc <b>transport</b> <b>system,</b> the MeGlc <b>transport</b> <b>system</b> in the patient's fibroblasts remained unaltered. The observed difference in the properties of the two hexose <b>transport</b> <b>systems</b> in the 'normal' and the patient's fibroblasts strongly suggests that the two <b>transport</b> <b>systems</b> may be coded or regulated by different genes. The present finding provides the first genetic evidence from naturally occurring fibroblasts indicating the presence of two different hexose <b>transport</b> <b>systems...</b>|$|R
40|$|In {{the plasma}} {{membrane}} {{of the green}} alga Monoraphidium braunii {{there are at least}} two monovalent anion <b>transport</b> <b>systems.</b> One of them is specific for bicarbonate. This <b>transport</b> <b>system</b> is activated by blue light and its induction is triggered by a decrease in the external CO 2 concentration. The second <b>transport</b> <b>system</b> is responsible for nitrate uptake at least. This <b>transport</b> <b>system</b> is also activated by blue light and its induction occurs when there is no ammonium in the external medium. Both <b>transport</b> <b>systems</b> are synthesized independently. Hence, when M. braunii cells grow with nitrate as the only nitrogen source under high CO 2, they have a nitrate <b>transport</b> <b>system</b> but lack a bicarbonate transporter. Conversely, cells grown with ammonium under low CO 2, have a bicarbonate <b>transport</b> <b>system</b> but lack a nitrate transporter. Both <b>transport</b> <b>systems</b> are induced in cells irradiated with white light in the absence of a carbon source, suggesting that there may be precursors in the plasma membrane that only need the synthesis and assembly of some component(s) to become fully active.
