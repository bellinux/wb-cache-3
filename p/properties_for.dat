5|$|In the 17th and 18th centuries manorial homes, {{including}} Cranham Hall, became attractive <b>properties</b> <b>for</b> merchants {{from the}} City of London. Initial attempts {{to expand the}} suburban estates from Upminster in the early 20th century ran into problems {{because of the lack}} of water supply. In 1922 sewage works for Upminster and Cranham were opened in Great Warley. In the 1930s land was used to develop some council housing and following the sale of the Benyon estate the pace of new building quickened. Cranham's location on the very edge of London's urban sprawl is explained by the halting effect on suburban house building of the introduction of the Metropolitan Green Belt and World War II. Thereafter building took place within the area bounded by the Southend Arterial Road in the north and St Mary's Lane in the south; and there were 615 council houses built by 1971.|$|E

Alternatively, entirely different materials and constructions could be explored with the objective of producing mass standards with greater stability.

Also, vapor-deposited, protective ceramic coatings like nitrides could be investigated for their suitability to isolate these new alloys.|$|E
