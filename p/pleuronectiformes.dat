5|$|<b>Pleuronectiformes</b> (flatfish) are {{an order}} of ray-finned fish. The most obvious {{characteristic}} of the modern flatfish is their asymmetry, with both eyes {{on the same side}} of the head in the adult fish. In some families the eyes are always on the right side of the body (dextral or right-eyed flatfish) and in others they are always on the left (sinistral or left-eyed flatfish). The primitive spiny turbots include equal numbers of right- and left-eyed individuals, and are generally less asymmetrical than the other families. Other distinguishing features of the order are the presence of protrusible eyes, another adaptation to living on the seabed (benthos), and the extension of the dorsal fin onto the head.|$|E

40|$|Background: Flatfish {{metamorphosis}} is {{a hormone}} regulated post-embryonic developmental event that transforms a symmetric larva into an asymmetric juvenile. In altricial-gastric teleost fish, differentiation {{of the stomach}} takes place after the onset of first feeding, and during metamorphosis dramatic molecular and morphological modifications of the gastrointestinal (GI-) tract occur. Here we present the functional ontogeny of the developing GI-tract from an integrative perspective in the <b>pleuronectiforme</b> Atlantic halibut, and test {{the hypothesis that the}} multiple functions of the teleost stomach develop synchronously during metamorphosis. Results: Onset of gastric function was determined with several approaches (anatomical, biochemical, molecular and in vivo observations). In vivo pH analysis in the GI-tract lumen combined with quantitative PCR (qPCR) of alpha and beta subunits of the gastric proton pump (H+/K+-ATPase) and pepsinogen A 2 indicated that gastric proteolytic capacity is established during the climax of metamorphosis. Transcript abundance of ghrelin, a putative orexigenic signalling molecule produced in the developing stomach, correlated (p < 0. 05) with the emergence of gastric proteolytic activity, suggesting that the stomach's role in appetite regulation occurs simultaneously with the establishment of proteolytic function. A 3 D models series of the GI-tract development indicated a functional pyloric sphincter prior to first feeding. Observations of fed larvae in vivo confirmed that stomach reservoir function was established before metamorphosis, and was thus independent of this event. Mechanical breakdown of food and transportation of chyme through the GI-tract was observed in vivo and resulted from phasic and propagating contractions established well before metamorphosis. The number of contractions in the midgut decreased at metamorphic climax synchronously with establishment of the stomach's proteolytic capacity and its increased peristaltic activity. Putative osmoregulatory competence of the GI-tract, inferred by abundance of Na+/K+-ATPase a transcripts, was already established at the onset of exogenous feeding and was unmodified by metamorphosis. Conclusions: The functional specialization of the GI-tract was not exclusive to metamorphosis, and its osmoregulatory capacity and reservoir function were established before first feeding. Nonetheless, acid production and the proteolytic capacity of the stomach coincided with metamorphic climax, and also marked the onset of the stomach's involvement in appetite regulation via ghrelin...|$|R
40|$|AbstractIn a joint {{research}} of the Korean Biodiversity Information Facility (KBIF), the study analyzed species composition and fluctuations in abundance of fishes caught by the set net fishery installed in the offing of Impo, Dolsando in Yeosu-si, Jeollanamdo in June and September 2008. During the study period, there were 11, 180 individuals of 54 species of 39 families in 8 orders {{that appeared in the}} set net fishery in the offing of the Dadohae Marine National Park. The numbers of individuals that appeared in June and September were shown in Table 2. Among the fishes caught, the Perciformes was the dominant species with 29 species of 22 families followed by the Tetraodontiformes with 6 species of 2 families and the <b>Pleuronectiforme</b> with 5 species of 4 families. There appeared 3 species of 3 families of the Anguilliformes and the Beloniformes, respectively. There were 4 species of 2 families of the Clupeiformes and 3 species of 2 families of the Scorpaeniformes. There was 1 species of 1 family of the Aulopiformes. During the study period, Scomber japonicus was the dominant species with 9005 individuals followed by Trichiurus lepturus with 1500 individuals and Panpus argenteus with 184 individuals. In June, Trichiurus lepturus was dominant with 1200 individuals followed by Panpus argenteus with 150 individuals and Scomberomorus koreanus with 58 individuals. In October, Scomber japonicus was the dominant species with 9000 individuals followed by Trichiurus lepturus with 300 individuals and Scomberomorus koreanus with 45 individuals. It indicates that the dominance of a species has close relationship with water temperature because fishes migrate to feed in this season. Given the frequency of appearance, Scomber japonicus and Trichiurus lepturus most frequently appeared because they {{were in the middle of}} growing into adult fishes while the frequent appearance of Scomberomorus koreanus and Panpus argenteus, which were major species of the fishing industry, contributed to the income of fishermen. There appeared rarely seen species in the offing of Yeosu like Pelamis platurus, Rachycentron canadum (Linnaeus), Lobotes surinamensis, Kyphosus vaigiensis, Abudefduf vaigiensis and Siganus fuscescens (Houttuyn). They are subtropical fishes and seem to move here due to the warmer water affected by the global warming. Additional studies on species composition and fluctuations in abundance of fishes that appear in the set net fishery in the Dadohae Marine National Park will be continuously conducted. So, they will contribute to the increase of fishermen's income by transferring the new fish species to fishermen when newly developed rare fish species are fostered in the lab and evaluated for adaptability and growth potential. The research result will be used as basic data to secure national biological resources, and create/manage biodiversity data by building a biodiversity database network...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe left/right {{asymmetry}} {{of adult}} flatfishes (<b>Pleuronectiformes)</b> is remarkable given the external body symmetry of the larval fish. The best-known {{change is the}} migration of their eyes: one eye migrates {{from one side to}} the other. Two extinct primitive <b>pleuronectiformes</b> with incomplete orbital migration have again attracted public attention to the mechanism of eye migration, a subject of speculation and research for over a century. Cranial asymmetry is currently believed to be responsible for eye migration. Contrary to that hypothesis, we show here that the initial migration of the eye is caused by cell proliferation in the suborbital tissue of the blind side and that the twist of frontal bone is dependent on eye migration. The inhibition of cell proliferation in the suborbital area of the blind side by microinjected colchicine was able to prevent eye migration and, thereafter, cranial asymmetry in juvenile Solea senegalensis (right sideness, Soleidae), Cynoglossus semilaevis (left sideness, Cynoglossidae), and Paralichthys olivaceus (left sideness, Paralichthyidae) with a bottom-dwelling lifestyle. Our results correct the current misunderstanding that eye migration is driven by the cranial asymmetry and simplify the explanation for broken left/right eye-symmetry. Our findings should help to focus the search on eye migration-related genes associated with cell proliferation. Finally, a novel model is proposed in this research which provides a reasonable explanation for differences in the migrating eye between, and sometimes within, different species of flatfish and which should aid in our overall understanding of eye migration in the ontogenesis and evolution of <b>Pleuronectiformes...</b>|$|E

Next, we made a comparative study of the information gained in accordance with the phylogenetic level to which each specimen belongs: the findings of the study being summarized as follow: 1) The lobus inferior of the primitive Clupeiformes, which appeared in the Jurassic period of the Mesozoic era, is the smallest in size of all those belonging to the 12 orders which were examined. 2) The lobi inferiores of Anguilliformes, Myctophiformes, Beloniformes, Perciformes which appeared in the succeeding period, the Cretaceaus period, are larger than that in the Clupeiformes; and that of Anguilliformes, can only just be considered a belonging to the large-sized group. 3) The lobi inferiores of Gadiformes, <b>Pleuronectiformes,</b> Cottiformes, Lophiiformes, Zeiformes, and Tetraodontiformes which appeared in the following course of time, the Palaeogene period of the Holocene, are the biggest of all belong to the 12 orders. 4) Although Cypriniformes appeared in the Palaeogene as well as Gadiformes, <b>Pleuronectiformes,</b> Cottiformes, Zeiformes and Lophiiformes, its lobus inferior can not be considered as huge or even big. This makes us suppose that Cypriniformes was an inland limnetic and was not affected by the vast changes in the oceanic environment which appear to have taken place {{since the end of the}} Mesozoic era. 5) The size of the lobi inferiores of bony fishes, i. e. the center of the feeding mechanism, have gradually differentiated from small to giant in accordance with the environmental changes that took during the geological age covering the latter half of the Mesozoic era to the Holocene period of the Cenozoic.

40|$|Flatfishes (Actinopterygii: <b>Pleuronectiformes)</b> are {{a diverse}} group of teleost fishes, with over 700 species in the order. Jaw {{asymmetry}} and diet have been thought to contribute to flatfish diversity but this has not yet been tested in a comparative framework. Here I use geometric morphometric and comparative methods to test whether ocular-blind side asymmetry in flatfish head morphology contributed to flatfish diversification. I find that the repeated convergent evolution of similar morphology, jaw function, and diet likely contribute to the high diversity of flatfishes...|$|E
30|$|Previously, {{there were}} no reports on the {{complete}} mitogenome of rhombosoleid fishes, {{and only a few}} mitogenomic fragments are available. In the present study, the complete mitochondrial sequences of the three rhombosoleid fishes were determined for the first time. The genomic features of these mitogenomes were analyzed and compared with other flatfish mtDNAs. The results of this study could provide useful data for the studies of mitogenome structures in fishes and the development of molecular markers to explore the classification issues within Rhombosoleidae and <b>Pleuronectiformes</b> in the future.|$|E

During the present study, 258 species of fin fishes belonging to 141 genera, 84 families and 19 orders were recorded. Among these, Perciformes topped the list with 47 families, 84 genera and 169 species followed by Clupeiformes, Angulliformes, Tetrodoniformes, Cyprinodontiformes, Scorpaeniformes, Rajiformes, Elopiformes, <b>Pleuronectiformes,</b> Syluriformes, Laminiformes, Bercyformes, Aelopiformes, Syngathiformes and Gonorhychiformes which includes the medicinally important and ornamentally valuable species...|$|E
40|$|Background: This study purposed {{to assess}} the health risks of heavy metals {{including}} nickel (Ni), chromium (Cr), mercury (Hg), and lead (Pb) in three widely-consumed fish from the coast of Bandar Abbas (Persian Gulf) and to determine the maximum amounts allowed for consumption according {{to the degree of}} contamination. Methods: This cross-sectional study was conducted in the summer and fall of 2013. Thunnus tonggol and Liza klunzingeri were selected from the Bandar Abbas market, and <b>Pleuronectiformes</b> were caught from the sea. Heavy metal concentrations were determined by atomic absorption. Risk assessment and allowable consumption levels were determined according to methods provided by the US Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA). Results: The highest average levels of Ni and Cr in Thunnus tonggol were 0. 059 and 0. 234 (¬µg/g dry weight), respectively. The highest average level of Hg in <b>Pleuronectiformes</b> was 0. 095 (¬µg/g dry weight), and the highest average level of Pb in Liza klunzingeri was 0. 006 (¬µg/g dry weight). The target hazard quotient (THQ) for all analyses of metals in the studied species and the hazard index (HI) were less than 1 for all three species. Conclusion: The results showed that despite Ni, Cr, Hg, and Pb pollution, the consumption of up to 4 (kg/d) of Thunnus tonggol by adults and up to 2. 2 (kg/d) by children does not cause health problems in terms of the tested heavy metals. For Liza klunzingeri, these levels are 7. 32 and 4. 02 (kg/d), respectively...|$|E
40|$|Type I Antifreeze {{proteins}} (AFPs) {{have been}} fully characterized in two teleost Orders; <b>Pleuronectiformes</b> and Scorpaeniformes. Results {{from this study}} have confirmed that cunner [Tautogolabrus adspersus (Family Labridae) ], {{a member of a}} third Order (Order Perciformes), also produce a type I AFP. This finding solidifies the hypothesis that type I AFPs are multiphyletic in origin and suggests that they represent remarkable examples of convergent evolution within three Orders of teleost fish. The cunner AFP was purified from blood plasma and found to belong to what is now known as classical type I AFP with their small size (mass = 4095. 16 Da), alanine-richness (> 57 mol...|$|E
40|$|Parasites are {{recognised}} as {{an excellent}} source of information on the distribution of their hosts. Here, the macroparasite fauna of 20 species of <b>Pleuronectiformes</b> belonging to five different families and inhabiting the Portuguese coast was investigated and compared with that known in four other areas (the North Sea, north Northeast Atlantic, Mediterranean Sea and Northwest African coast) in order to determine (1) their zoogeographical pattern and (2) the role of the Portuguese coast as an intermediate biogeographic province. Macroparasites infecting <b>Pleuronectiformes</b> sampled along the Portuguese coast were collected using standard parasitological techniques, whereas data on those in the other four areas were obtained from the literature, rendering a total of 73 macroparasite species. Both sets of data were then compiled in a presence/absence matrix. Hosts and macroparasites were placed into zoogeographical categories according to their known distribution, and patterns were evaluated using multidimensional scaling and cluster analysis. The zoogeography of hosts and parasites was not entirely concordant, although that of endoparasites was generally consistent with the patterns for marine free-living species. On the other hand, only specific ectoparasites truly mirrored the distribution of their hosts. These differences reflect the importance of host ecology and dispersal and environmental factors on the patterns revealed. The Portuguese coast seems to {{play a significant role in}} the distribution of Pleuronectiformes‚Äô parasites along the Northeast Atlantic and Mediterranean Sea, due to its transitional character and to the sympatric occurrence of related hosts, both promoting the acquisition of new parasite species or the maintenance of historical host-parasite relationships...|$|E
