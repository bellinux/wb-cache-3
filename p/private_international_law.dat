An arrest may notably be imposed if the debtor holds a certificate of unpaid debts against the debtor, if the debtor attempts to hide or dispose of his assets, or if the debtor is not resident in Switzerland.

25|$|International adoption: {{involves}} the placing {{of a child}} for adoption outside that child's country of birth. This can occur through {{both public and private}} agencies. In some countries, such as Sweden, these adoptions account for the majority of cases (see above Table). The U.S. example, however, indicates there is wide variation by country since adoptions from abroad account for less than 15% of its cases. More than 60,000 Russian children have been adopted in the United States since 1992, and a similar number of Chinese children were adopted from 1995 to 2005. The laws of different countries vary in their willingness to allow international adoptions. Recognizing the difficulties and challenges associated with international adoption, and in an effort to protect those involved from the corruption and exploitation which sometimes accompanies it, the Hague Conference on <b>Private</b> <b>International</b> <b>Law</b> developed the Hague Adoption Convention, which came into force on 1 May 1995 and has been ratified by 85 countries as of November 2011.|$|E

2500|$|Under the {{following}} tax protester argument, the term [...] "state" [...] {{is used in}} an international meaning of [...] "nation" [...] or [...] "sovereign." [...] The argument is that this meaning refers to the foreign status of each state to every other state including the federal state, under <b>private</b> <b>international</b> <b>law.</b> Under this argument, all court opinions {{on the subject of}} states being foreign to each other (and also to the federal state and possessions) have upheld this concept, and have distinguished between meanings of foreignness by using the terms <b>private</b> <b>international</b> <b>law</b> and public international law. Under this argument, the latter term deals with the authority the 50 States delegated to the United States government to represent American interests outside of America, grouping all those that are bound by the United States Constitution as one body, relative to those that are not bound, such as France or Britain. Under this argument, the term [...] "private international law" [...] signifies the foreignness of the sovereign states, or nations, of the United States system to each other, within the system.|$|E
