40|$|The present part II review {{highlights}} <b>pharmacokinetic</b> <b>drug-drug</b> <b>interactions</b> (excluding {{those of}} minor severity) of medications used in prophylactic {{treatment of the}} main primary headaches (migraine, tension-type and cluster headache). The principles of pharmacokinetics and metabolism, and the interactions of medications for acute treatment are examined in part I. The overall goal of this series of two reviews {{is to increase the}} awareness of physicians, primary care providers and specialists regarding <b>pharmacokinetic</b> <b>drug-drug</b> <b>interactions</b> (DDIs) of headache medications. The aim of prophylactic treatment is to reduce the frequency of headache attacks using beta-blockers, calcium-channel blockers, antidepressants, antiepileptics, lithium, serotonin antagonists, corticosteroids and muscle relaxants, which must be taken daily for long periods. During treatment the patient often continues to take symptomatic drugs for the attack, and may need other medications for associated or new-onset illnesses. DDIs can, therefore, occur. As a whole, DDIs of clinical relevance concerning prophylactic drugs are a limited number. Their effects can be prevented by starting the treatment with low dosages, which should be gradually increased depending on response and side effects, while frequently monitoring the patient and plasma levels of other possible coadministered drugs with a narrow therapeutic range. Most headache medications are substrates of CYP 2 D 6 (e. g., beta-blockers, antidepressants) or CYP 3 A 4 (e. g., calcium-channel blockers, selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitors, corticosteroids).

The {{purpose of}} this study was to investigate the <b>pharmacokinetic</b> <b>drug-drug</b> <b>interaction</b> (DDI) between PCG and acyclovir. Method: When acyclovir and PCG were co-administered, plasma concentration of acyclovir, urinary excretion of acyclovir in vivo, uptake of acyclovir in kidney slices and uptake of acyclovir in human (h) OAT 1 /hOAT 3 - HEK 293 cells were determined to examine the effect of PCG on urinary excretion of acyclovir. Results: The plasma concentration of acyclovir was increased markedly and accumulative renal excretion and renal clearance of acyclovir were decreased significantly after intravenous administration of acyclovir in combination with PCG. PCG could decrease the uptake of acyclovir in kidney slices and in hOAT 1 -/hOAT 3 -human embryonic kidney (HEK 293) cells. Conclusions: It indicates that acyclovir is a substrate for OAT 1 and OAT 3. PCG inhibits the renal excretion of acyclovir by inhibit-ing renal transporters OAT 1 and OAT 3 in vivo and in vitro.

We assessed the maximal tolerated dose (MTD), evaluated the pharmacokinetics and preliminary anti-tumour efficacy of oral SU- 014813 administered continuously in combination with docetaxel to patients with advanced solid tumours. MethodsIn this phase I study successive patient cohorts received docetaxel 60 or 75 mg/m 2 every 3 weeks in combination with chronic daily dosing of SU- 014813. Dose limiting toxicity was assessed both in the first and second treatment cycle. ResultsTwenty-five patients were entered on study of which 24 started treatment. Dose limiting toxicities were prolonged neutropenia, neutropenic fever, fatigue and diarrhoea. Other toxicities included fatigue, alopecia, nausea, vomiting, anorexia, rash, hypertension and hair discolouration. The recommended phase II dose was determined to be docetaxel 75 mg/m 2 in combination with SU- 014813 50 mg/day.

Plasma concentrations of indisulam, capecitabine and its three metabolites were determined for pharmacokinetic analysis. The main dose-limiting toxicity was myelosuppression. Hand/foot syndrome and stomatitis were the major non-haematological toxicities. The recommended dose was initially established at indisulam 700 [*]mg[*]m− 2 and capecitabine 1250 [*]mg[*]m− 2 BID. However, during cycle 2 the recommended dose was poorly tolerated in three patients. A dose of indisulam 500 [*]mg[*]m− 2 and capecitabine 1250 [*]mg[*]m− 2 BID proved to be safe at cycle 1 and 2 in nine additional patients. Indisulam pharmacokinetics during cycle 1 were consistent with pharmacokinetic data from phase I mono-therapy studies. However, exposure to indisulam was remarkably increased at cycle 2 due to a drug–drug interaction between capecitabine and indisulam.

Lamotrigine has been postulated to be delivered to its site of action in the brain favourably despite its physicochemical properties. The {{aim of this study}} was to investigate the transport of lamotrigine in an in-vitro model of the BBB. In this study, lamotrigine was found to have a distribution coefficient of 0 at pH 7. 4 indicating that it was not highly lipophilic. Human brain endothelial cells (hCMEC/D 3) were used to probe the interaction of lamotrigine with drug transporters. The uptake of lamotrigine into hCMEC/D 3 cells was found to be an active process (K m = 62 ± 14 μM; V max = 385 ± 30 pmol/min/million cells). Furthermore, use of a panel of transporter inhibitors indicated that this active uptake was mediated by organic cation transporter 1 (OCT 1). OCT 1 mRNA and protein were shown to be expressed in hCMEC/D 3 cells. KCL 22 cells overexpressing OCT 1 were then used to validate these findings.

When treating HIV-infected patients with a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI), potential drug-drug interactions with antiretroviral agents have to be taken into account. We investigated the two-way <b>pharmacokinetic</b> <b>drug-drug</b> <b>interaction</b> and tolerability of concomitant administration of the SSRI citalopram and the HIV- 1 integrase inhibitor raltegravir in healthy volunteers. METHODS: An open-label, crossover, two-period trial was conducted in 24 healthy volunteers. Subjects received the following treatments: citalopram 20 mg once daily for 2 weeks followed by the combination with raltegravir 400 mg twice daily for 5 days and after a washout period raltegravir 400 mg twice daily for 5 days. Intensive steady-state pharmacokinetic blood sampling was performed. Geometric mean ratios (GMRs) of the combination versus the reference treatment and 90 % CIs were calculated for the area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC). CYP 2 C 19 genotyping was performed because it influences N-demethylation of citalopram to desmethylcitalopram. RESULTS: A total of 22 healthy volunteers completed the trial. GMRs (90 % CI) were 1. 00 (0. 98, 1. 03) for citalopram AUC 0 - 24 h, 0. 99 (0. 88, 1. 12) for desmethylcitalopram AUC 0 - 24 h and 0. 77 (0. 50, 1. 19) for raltegravir AUC 0 - 12 h. Raltegravir plasma concentration 12 h after intake (C 12 h) did not change with concomitant use of citalopram. Within each CYP 2 C 19 phenotype subgroup the citalopram metabolite-to-parent ratio, which is a measure for metabolic enzyme activity, was not influenced by concomitant raltegravir use. CONCLUSIONS: Raltegravir does not influence the pharmacokinetics of citalopram and desmethylcitalopram. Citalopram did not change the pharmacokinetics of raltegravir in a clinically meaningful way.

On multivariate analysis, high body mass index (P[*]=[*] 0. 008), no treatment with corticosteroids (P[*]=[*] 0. 04), increased time between the last tablet intake and measurement of blood HCQ concentrations (P[*]=[*] 0. 017), low platelet count (P < 0. 001), low neutrophil count (P < 0. 001), and high estimated creatinine clearance (P < 0. 001) were associated with low blood HCQ concentrations. In 22 SLE patients with chronic renal insufficiency (median serum creatinine clearance 52 ml/minute [range 23 - 58 ml/minute]) who received 400 mg/day HCQ, the median blood HCQ concentration was significantly higher than that in the 509 patients from the PLUS study (1, 338 ng/ml [range 504 - 2, 229 ng/ml] versus 917 ng/ml [range 208 - 3316 ng/ml]) (P < 0. 001). We provide a comprehensive analysis of determinants of blood HCQ concentrations. Because this measurement is increasingly being used, these data might be useful for clinicians...|$|E
40|$|Whereas {{ketoconazole}} {{is often}} used to study the worst-case sce-nario for clinical <b>pharmacokinetic</b> <b>drug-drug</b> <b>interactions</b> (DDIs) for drugs that are primarily metabolized by CYP 3 A 4, fluconazole {{is considered to be a}} moderate inhibitor of CYP 3 A 4, providing as-sessment of the moderate-case scenario of CYP 3 A-based DDIs. Fluconazole is also a moderate inhibitor of CYP 2 C 9 and CYP 2 C 19. For predicting clinical DDIs using conventional approaches, deter-mining the in vivo inhibitor concentration at the enzymatic site [I], a critical parameter, is still not practical. In our previous study, a novel method involving hepatocyte suspension in plasma was used to circumvent the need to determine the elusive [I] value. In this study, the CYP 1 A 2, 2 C 9, 2 C 19, 2 D 6, and 3 A 4 activities remaining in the presence of fluconazole were determined in human hepato-cytes suspended in human plasma, covering a range of fluconazole clinical plasma concentrations (Cavg and Cmax).

40|$|Malaria {{patients}} are frequently coinfected with HIV andmycobacteria causing tuberculosis, {{which increases the}} use of coadmin-istered drugs and thereby enhances the risk of <b>pharmacokinetic</b> <b>drug-drug</b> <b>interactions.</b> Activation of the pregnane X receptor (PXR) by xenobiotics, which include many drugs, induces drug metabolism and transport, thereby resulting in possible attenua-tion or loss of the therapeutic responses to the drugs being coadministered. While several artemisinin-type antimalarial drugs {{have been shown to}} activate PXR, data on nonartemisinin-type antimalarials are still missing. Therefore, this study aimed to elucidate the potential of nonartemisinin antimalarial drugs and drug metabolites to activate PXR. We screened 16 clinically used antimalarial drugs and six major drug metabolites for binding to PXR using the two-hybrid PXR ligand binding domain assembly assay; this identified carboxymefloquine, the major and pharmacologically inactive metabolite of the antimalarial drug mefloquine, as a potential PXR ligand. Two-hybrid PXR-coactivator and-corepressor interaction assays and PXR-dependent promoter reporter gene assays confirmed carboxymefloquine to be a novel PXR agonist which specifically activated the human receptor. In the PXR-expressing intestinal LS 174 T cells and in primary human hepatocytes, carboxymefloquine induced the ex...|$|R

The pregnane X receptor is a ligand-activated nuclear receptor, which plays central role in induction of numerous genes involved in the phase I. and II. of biotransformation including the most important hepatic enzyme CYP 3 A 4. The aim of the diploma thesis was to examine interaction of warfarin and its enantiomers with PXR in terms of transactivation of CYP 3 A 4 gene in hepatoma cell line HepG 2 or in primary human hepatocytes. The cytotoxicity of warfarin was tested on cell line HepG 2 using the MTT assay. Cytotoxic activity of warfarin didn't become evident in tested concentrations. Using the methods gene reporter assay and two-hybrid assay, we found that R-warfarin induces CYP 3 A 4 gene expression through nuclear receptor PXR. Using the method RT-PCR, we observed induction effect of warfarin and its enantiomers on the CYP 3 A 4 gene expression in isolated hepatocytes of two donors. I can conclude that activation of PXR by warfarin may cause <b>pharmacokinetic</b> <b>drug-drug</b> <b>interactions</b> of pharmaceuticals metabolized by CYP 3 A 4...|$|R
40|$|Pyronaridine/Artesunate (PA) 3 : 1 fixed dose {{combination}} {{is a novel}} artemisinin-based combination therapy (ACT) in development {{for the treatment of}} acute uncomplicated Plasmodium falciparum or Plasmodium vivax malaria. An understanding of both pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of pyronaridine is of importance in order to achieve optimal therapeutic outcome. In this thesis, population pharmacokinetic models for pyronaridine in healthy subjects, and adult and pediatric malaria patients were developed. Pyronaridine pharmacokinetics in both adult and pediatric populations were best described by a two compartment model with first order absorption and elimination from the central compartment. A presence of malaria infection and body weight were the significant covariates that explained pyronaridine pharmacokinetic variability in the adult population. For the pediatric population, age was the only significant covariate that explained pyronaridine pharmacokinetic variability. Monte Carlo simulations were also performed to address differences in pyronaridine exposures among these populations and to explore the exposures of pyronaridine among recommended dosage regimens for pediatric and adult malaria patients. Healthy adults had a higher exposure to pyronaridine as compared to adult malaria patients. For the pediatric population, younger children had a higher exposure to pyronaridine as compared to older children. The overall range of pyronaridine exposures among dosing groups for adult and pediatric malaria patients were relatively similar. The cut-off values of pyronaridine pharmacokinetic parameters associated with successful treatment outcome were also determined by means of receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve. These cut-off values can be used to optimize the outcome of malaria treatment. Additionally, Cox proportional hazard model was conducted to determine the relationship between several covariates and time to the occurrence of re-infection or recrudescence. The models showed that as the levels of predicted pyronaridine concentrations on day 7 increased, the risks of acquiring re-infection or recrudescence decreased. Finally, <b>pharmacokinetic</b> <b>drug-drug</b> <b>interaction</b> of pyronaridine and ritonavir was assessed based on the overlap pathway for metabolism of both drugs and the high rates of HIV and malaria co-infection. There was an effect of ritonavir on pyronaridine pharmacokinetics. However, the results were not considered clinically relevant. An increase in ritonavir exposure was observed in the presence of fixed dose PA...|$|E
40|$|To {{determine}} the maximum-tolerated dose for the combination paclitaxel and carboplatin administered every 4 weeks {{and to gain}} more insight into the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of this combination in previously untreated ovarian cancer patients. Thirty-five chemotherapy-naive patients with suboptimally debulked stage III (tumor masses > 3 cm) and stage IV ovarian cancer were entered onto this phase I trial in which paclitaxel was administered as a 3 -hour intravenous (IV) infusion at dosages of 125 to 225 mg/m 2 immediately followed by carboplatin over 30 minutes at dosages of 300 to 600 mg/m 2. A total of six courses was planned, followed by a second-look laparoscopy/laparotomy. Patients with a response and/or minimal residual disease at second-look laparoscopy received three additional courses. Twenty-six patients participated in the pharmacokinetic part of the study. The most important hematologic toxicity encountered was neutropenia. Neutropenia was more pronounced for the higher dose levels (DLs) and was cumulative. Thrombocytopenia was mild in the first eight DLs, but increased during the treatment courses. Nonhematologic toxicities consisted mainly of vomiting, neuropathy, fatigue, rash, pruritus, myalgia, and arthralgia. Dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs) in this trial were neutropenic fever, thrombocytopenia that required platelet transfusions, and cumulative neuropathy. Of 33 patients assessable for response, 26 major responders (78 %, 20 complete response [CR] and six partial response [PR]) were documented. The maximal concentration (Cmax) of paclitaxel and the area under the concentration-time curve (AUC) were not different from the historical data for paclitaxel as a single agent. Retrospective analysis using a modified Calvert formula showed that the measured carboplatin AUCs in plasma ultrafiltrate (pUF) were 30 % +/- 3. 4 % less than the calculated carboplatin AUC. Neutropenia was more pronounced than could be expected {{on the basis of}} the historical times above a threshold concentration greater than 0. 1 mumol/L (T > or = 0. 1 mumol/L) or 0. 05 mumol/L (T > or = 0. 05 mumol/L), and thrombocytopenia was less than could be expected from historical sigmoidal Emax models. The combination of paclitaxel 200 mg/ m 2 and carboplatin 550 mg/m 2 every 4 weeks is a well-tolerated treatment modality. The paclitaxel-carboplatin combination is highly active in stage III (bulky) and stage IV ovarian cancer. No indications for a <b>pharmacokinetic</b> <b>drug-drug</b> <b>interaction</b> between carboplatin and paclitaxel were foun...|$|E
40|$|NSAIDs are {{reported}} to {{increase the risk of}} bleeding in coumarin users. The mechanism underlying this risk is inhibition of platelet aggregation, however a pharmacokinetic mechanism resulting in an increased International Normalised Ratio (INR) was proposed in some case reports in warfarin treated patients. In this retrospective cohort study the influence of diclofenac, naproxen and ibuprofen on the INR of outpatients stabilised on acenocoumarol therapy was investigated. We also determined the role of cytochrome P 450 2 C 9 (CYP 2 C 9) polymorphism on coumarin dosage and INR in NSAID users. The study was carried out at the Groningen Outpatient Thrombosis Service. A retrospective cohort study among patients who received both acenocoumarol and one of the NSAIDs under study was performed. Patients whose INR rose above the upper level of the therapeutic range (INR above 3. 5 or 4. 0) after an NSAID under study was added to the acenocoumarol therapy, were compared with patients who did not show such an elevation. A two-sample t-test (average acenocoumarol dosage, age), and chi-square tests (sex, therapeutic range, type of NSAID) were used to test for differences. Genotyping was carried out by analysing blood samples for the relevant CYP 2 C 9 alleles. The study population consisted of 112 patients on stable acenocoumarol therapy, of which 52 (46 %) showed an elevation of the INR above the desired therapeutic level (INR 3. 5 and 4. 0 respectively) after the start of an NSAID under study. In 12 patients, the INR increased above 6. The INR of the other 60 patients (54 %) remained constant after the start of one of the NSAIDs under study. There were no statistically significant differences, between patients with increased INR and patients without increased INR with regard to age, sex, therapeutic range and average acenocoumarol dosage. Eighty patients, of whom 36 showed an increased INR {{as a result of a}} potential acenocoumarol-NSAID drug interaction, were included in the genotyping study. No association between CYP 2 C 9 genotype and an increased INR as a result of the drug-drug interaction was found. In nearly half of a cohort of elderly patients, the INR increased beyond the therapeutic range (INR 3. 5 or 4. 0) as a result of a potential <b>pharmacokinetic</b> <b>drug-drug</b> <b>interaction</b> between acenocoumarol and diclofenac, naproxen and ibuprofen. The average increase in INR was between I and 4. Polymorphism of CYP 2 C 9 does not seem to be a relevant risk factor for the NSAID-acenocoumarol interaction...|$|E

Concurrent use of rifampicin and many antiretroviral drugs is complicated by <b>pharmacokinetic</b> <b>drug-drug</b> <b>interactions.</b> Rifampicin is a very potent enzyme inducer, which can result in subtherapeutic antiretroviral drug concentrations. In addition, TB drugs and antiretroviral drugs have additive (pharmacodynamic) interactions as reflected in overlapping adverse effect profiles. This review provides an overview of the pharmacological interactions between rifampicin-based TB treatment and antiretroviral drugs in adults living in resource-limited settings. Major progress has been made to evaluate the interactions between TB drugs and antiretroviral therapy; however, burning questions remain concerning nevirapine and efavirenz effectiveness during rifampicin-based TB treatment, treatment options for TB-HIV-coinfected patients with nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor resistance or intolerance, and exact treatment or dosing schedules for vulnerable patients including children and pregnant women.

40|$|Chronic {{hepatitis}} C virus (HCV) infection {{can cause}} severe liver cirrhosis, for which liver transplantation {{is the only}} therapy. To prevent organ rejection, transplanted patients are treated with immunosuppressive agents. We describe two transplanted patients treated with tacrolimus who were simultaneously treated with direct-acting antivirals (DAAs) for their chronic HCV infection. No <b>pharmacokinetic</b> <b>drug-drug</b> <b>interactions</b> (DDIs) were expected between tacrolimus and the selected DAAs. However, in both patients, tacrolimus plasma concentrations decreased during HCV treatment. We hypothesise that decreased plasma concentrations were not caused by a DDI but were an indirect result of the clearance of the HCV infection. During chronic HCV infection, pro-inflammatory cytokines may inhibit cytochrome P 450 (CYP) enzymes, which are primarily responsible for tacrolimus metabolism. If this is true, then with clearance of the virus the activity of these enzymes will normalise and tacrolimus metabolism will increase. These changes were clinically relevant because the tacrolimus dosage needed to be adjusted. Therefore, physicians {{should be aware that}} CYP substrates with narrow therapeutic ranges might require dose adaption during HCV therapy with DAAs. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.

40|$|STUDY OF DRUG-DRUG INTERACTIONS BASED ON MODULATION OF THE FUNCTION OF LIVER AND KIDNEY ACTIVE TRANSPORTERS Leos Fuksa, M. Sc. ABSTRACT The present thesis {{focused on}} closer {{research}} of drug-induced {{changes in the}} expression and function of the main hepatic and renal transporters and their effects on the pharmacokinetics of the model substrates. The subject of our particular interest were ABC efflux transporters (namely P-gp and Mrp 2) localized in the apical membranes of polarized epithelium cells in the excretory organs, and also Oatp 2 transporter playing {{an important role in}} the basolateral uptake of drugs. Dexamethasone and amiodarone were employed to bring about changes in the active transport. Dexamethasone is a potent corticosteroid that showed capability to increase elimination processes, i. e. to induce enzymes and transporters both in vitro and in vivo. Amiodarone, a life-saving antiarrhythmic, is a well-known inhibitor of drug metabolism. Its direct inhibitory effects on the active transport have recently been reported. The summarized results of the included publications describe various aspects of the <b>pharmacokinetic</b> <b>drug-drug</b> <b>interactions,</b> where the underlying mechanism of the interaction is a modulation (either induction/activation or inhibition) of the active transport.
