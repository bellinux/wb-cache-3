2500|$|Two {{condensers}} were fitted, one on {{each side}} of the turbine run, and were supplied with circulating water by two large centrifugal pumps. The air pumps were direct acting twin-type <b>pumps,</b> <b>fitted</b> in duplicate <b>for</b> each condenser and independently driven. Steam was supplied at a pressure of 170lb per square inch by four double-ended cylindrical boilers, arranged to work under forced draught with closed stokeholds. Each of the boilers was fitted with eight furnaces of the suspension type. There were four combustion chambers, each common to two furnaces, the shell plates and stays being manufactured from high-tensile steel. The boilers were arranged in two boiler rooms with separate uptakes and funnel for each room.

5000|$|Ben-my-Chree {{was driven}} by three Parsons steam {{turbines}} which were built under licence by Vickers Sons and Maxim, the turbines developing 14,000 shaft horsepower, thereby resulting in a designed service speed of 24.5 knots. The turbines were so arranged so as to work in series, with one high-pressure ahead turbine driving the centre shaft, and two low-pressure ahead turbines driving their respective wing shaft. Astern turbines were incorporated in the casing, with each low-pressure turbine fitted with valves to control the admission of steam for ahead and astern working. These manoeuvring valves were independent of the high-pressure turbine which would run idle when the ship was manoeuvring. The valve gear was arranged for easy operation and was placed at the forward end of the high-pressure turbine. The main valves were of the vertical equilibrium type operated by large handwheels. Two condensers were fitted, {{one on each side}} of the turbine run, and were supplied with circulating water by two large centrifugal pumps.

5000|$|There are {{two main}} types of tire valves to which the bicycle tire pump attaches. These are the Presta valve and the Schrader valve. Some <b>pumps</b> <b>fit</b> both types of valves, whereas others do not, but {{adapters}} are available that enable the <b>pump</b> to <b>fit</b> any type of valve. [...] "All valves adjustable connecting systems," [...] also known as AVACS, enable the <b>pump</b> to <b>fit</b> any type of valve found on a bicycle, and {{it also has the}} capacity to fit onto other universal inflatable products, such as balls, paddling pools, and rubber rings.

50|$|Vacuum {{may be used}} to power, {{or provide}} {{assistance}} to mechanical devices. In hybrid and diesel engine motor vehicles, a <b>pump</b> <b>fitted</b> on the engine (usually on the camshaft) is used to produce vacuum. In petrol engines, instead, vacuum is typically obtained as a side-effect of the operation of the engine and the flow restriction created by the throttle plate, but may be also supplemented by an electrically operated vacuum pump to boost braking assistance or improve fuel consumption. This vacuum may then be used to power the following motor vehicle components: vacuum servo booster for the hydraulic brakes, motors that move dampers in the ventilation system, throttle driver in the cruise control servomechanism, door locks or trunk releases.|$|R
