40|$|The {{spread of}} human {{immunodeficiency}} virus (HIV) from a Florida dentist with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) to several of his patients has generated considerable concern {{about the risk of}} HIV transmission during dental treatment. Accordingly, self-reporting of HIV infection and subsequent AIDS by a dentist at our medical center <b>prompted</b> <b>notification</b> and testing of patients at risk. Key features of the notification and testing process were (a) only patients who had undergone procedures deemed to pose appreciable risk of exposure to the dentist's blood were notified, (b) the identity of the dentist was shielded by not including in notification letters any identifying information other than the name of the medical center, and (c) patients' blood specimens were tested promptly for HIV antibodies and results were reported immediately to each patient to minimize the period of anxiety. HIV antibody testing was requested by 41 of the 88 patients to whom notification letters were sent, and all 41 were HIV negative after having undergone 395 procedures by the HIV-infected dentist. Review of the 88 patients' medical and dental records showed that at least 77 had received treatment by other health care providers at the medical center so {{that they would not be}} able to ascertain which provider had HIV infection. None of the patients who were notified by the medical center subsequently queried the dentist concerning possible HIV infection. Our experience demonstrates that look-back investigations can be conducted by institutions in a manner that substantially protects the identity of health care workers with HIV infection, minimizes the number of patients discomfitted, and avoids excessive utilization of personnel time.

40|$|In {{recent years}} many popular {{interactive}} computer games have gained online remote multiplayer functionalities, supported by standard Internet communication protocols and architectures. Due to the heterogeneous communication infrastructures and network asymmetries, some users (i. e. clients) may be suffering slow, congested and unreliable Internet connections, while {{others may have}} access to fast and reliable links. A different rate and latency {{in the delivery of}} users' commands and event notifications may lead to unfairness issues during the game play. Specifically, this happens in the class of real time and interactive games, which require frequent and <b>prompt</b> event <b>notifications</b> and reactions among all the users competing in the gaming environment. A dynamic adaptation of the gaming architecture to the limitations of the communication infrastructure could be exploited to reduce these problems. The communication network topology and performance should be considered in the management of the client allocation to the set of multiple servers. In this paper we present a simple client migration algorithm which can be adopted on a generic multi-player, multi-server online gaming architecture. Client migration among the servers of the gaming infrastructure is exploited to adapt to the dynamic performances of the general communication network infrastructure. The proposed mechanism has been modeled and simulated for the class of distributed multi-player and multi-server interactive games, implemented over a general communication network infrastructure. Results show a significant fairness improvement, more homogeneous performances, and the absence of significant overheads. ...|$|R

40|$|Background: The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) {{reports that}} men have {{recently}} experienced a rise in rates of sexually transmitted infections (STIs) —particularly chlamydia, gonorrhea, and syphilis. While STI testing has improved in cost, portability, and accuracy, STI notification still relies on telephone calls. <b>Prompt</b> STI <b>notification</b> is critical {{to reduce the number}} of days between STI test and STI treatment in order to stop future STI transmissions and prevent long-term health complications. In 2014, AIDS Healthcare Foundation (AHF) began implementing Healthvana, an online patient engagement platform and smartphone application, to notify AHF Wellness Center clients of STI test results. The primary study objective of this dissertation is to determine whether Healthvana reduced the number of days between STI test, notification, and treatment for male clients. The secondary study objective of this dissertation is to better understand the characteristics of clients who opted in to Healthvana. Methods: STI test, notification, and treatment data as well as risk assessment data from 18 AHF Wellness Centers between January 1, 2014 and December 31, 2015 were retrospectively collected. Male clients were included in the cross-sectional analysis if they were tested, notified, and treated for STIs (n = 1, 460). Ordinary least squares and Poisson regressions were utilized to analyze differences in the mean number of days between STI test, notification, and treatment. Logistic regressions were utilized to analyze the difference between clients who did not opt in to Healthvana and clients who opted in to Healthvana. Results: The mean number of days between STI test and notification was reduced by 22 percent following Healthvana implementation, from nine days to seven days (p < 0. 001). Overall, Healthvana implementation reduced the total days between STI test and treatment by two days, from 13 days to 11 days (p = 0. 022). Clients under the age of 25 years experienced greater odds of opting in to Healthvana than clients who were 30 - 39 years old (p = 0. 027) and clients who were aged 40 years and older (p = 0. 004).

We invited 27 ART programmes from urban settings in Africa, Asia and South America {{to participate in}} a survey, with the aim to examine what preventive services had been integrated in ART programmes. Twenty-two programmes participated; eight (36 %) from South Africa, two from Brazil, two from Zambia and one each from Argentina, India, Thailand, Botswana, Ivory Coast, Malawi, Morocco, Uganda and Zimbabwe and one occupational programme of a brewery company included five countries (Nigeria, Republic of Congo, Democratic Republic of Congo, Rwanda and Burundi). Twenty-one sites (96 %) provided health education and social support, and 18 (82 %) provided HIV testing and counselling. All sites encouraged disclosure of HIV infection to spouses and partners, but only 11 (50 %) had a protocol for partner notification. Twenty-one sites (96 %) supplied male condoms, seven (32 %) female condoms and 20 (91 %) provided prophylactic ART for the prevention of mother-to child transmission. Seven sites (33 %) regularly screened for sexually transmitted infections (STI). Twelve sites (55 %) were involved in activities aimed at women or adolescents, and 10 sites (46 %) in activities aimed at serodiscordant couples. Stigma and discrimination, gender roles and funding constraints were perceived as the main obstacles to effective prevention in ART programmes. We conclude that preventive services in ART programmes in lower income countries focus on health education and the provision of social support and male condoms. Strategies that might be equally or more important in this setting, including partner <b>notification,</b> <b>prompt</b> diagnosis and treatment of STI and reduction of stigma in the community, have not been implemented widely...|$|R
40|$|Zika virus (ZIKV) is an {{emergent}} threat provoking {{a worldwide}} explosive outbreak. Since January 2015, 41 countries reported autochthonous cases.

A recent report describing low experimental transmission efficiency of its main putative vector, Ae. aegypti, in conjunction with apparent sexual transmission <b>notifications,</b> <b>prompted</b> the investigation of other potential sources of viral dissemination. Urine and saliva have been previously established as useful tools in ZIKV diagnosis. Here, we described the presence and isolation of infectious ZIKV particles from saliva and urine of acute phase patients in the Rio de Janeiro state, Brazil. Nine urine and five saliva samples from nine patients from Rio de Janeiro presenting rash and other typical Zika acute phase symptoms were inoculated in Vero cell culture and submitted to specific ZIKV RNA detection and quantification through, respectively, NAT-Zika, RT-PCR and RT-qPCR. Two ZIKV isolates were achieved, one from urine and one from saliva specimens. ZIKV nucleic acid was identified by all methods in four patients. Whenever both urine and saliva samples were available from the same patient, urine viral loads were higher, corroborating the general sense {{that it is a}} better source for ZIKV molecular diagnostic. In spite of this, from the two isolated strains, each from one patient, only one derived from urine, suggesting that other factors, like the acidic nature of this fluid, might interfere with virion infectivity. The complete genome of both ZIKV isolates was obtained. Phylogenetic analysis revealed similarity with strains previously isolated during the South America outbreak. The detection of infectious ZIKV particles in urine and saliva of patients during the acute phase may represent a critical factor in the spread of virus. The epidemiological relevance of this finding, regarding the contribution of alternative non-vectorial ZIKV transmission routes, needs further investigation...|$|R

40|$|The SALSA (Sensors and Apps for Languages in Smart Areas) project, {{a winner}} of the Open University’s MK:Smart Open Challenge awards, is {{investigating}} how a smart city infrastructure can enable the provision of highly accurate, location-based learning activities for language learners, particularly recent migrants who have a real need to learn the language of their new home. Second language acquisition is perceived by adult migrants themselves, as well as host governments, “as a crucial factor for socio-economic and cultural integration” 1. The city is a rich environment for language learning, providing opportunities for learning through observation, conversation, and social interaction during daily activities 2. Providing learning activities accessed on smartphones, mobile ICT devices that are owned by and familiar to many migrants, enables the city to become an educational environment for an audience who may struggle to attend classroom based language courses at fixed times and places due to family and work related constraints 1. Learning activities provided on smartphones enable personalised and flexible educational approach for a heterogenous group of learners, with differing needs and abilities 3. Language learning educators identify that location-based and context-sensitive resources and activities are a powerful resource for learners 4; and the mobility of smartphones makes them a particularly suitable platform for this mode of learning. SALSA ([URL]) is exploring the use of Bluetooth beacons placed around the city to trigger location-based learning resources in an app on learners’ smartphones. Once a learner has downloaded the app to their smartphone, they will be notified when they are near to a beacon and offered the opportunity to engage with a context-relevant learning activity stored in the app. Beacons are a low cost technology suitable for large scale deployment, transmitting a simple identifier that is interpreted by a smartphone app to trigger a predefined action, such as presenting the user with sample phrases suitable for the context, a listening exercise, or prompts for reflection. No network connection is required to engage with the learning activities, which enables the system to work indoors as well as outside, and at no network cost (a key consideration for low-income and internationally transient users). Beacons enable highly accurate identification of relative smartphone location, allowing for a density of different resources to be triggered in the same area, hence have been employed in scenarios such as providing information about exhibits in galleries, and guiding visually impaired customers through the London Underground ([URL]). As a wireless technology they enable a discrete engagement with learning activities for situations where they may choose not to explicitly engage with a trigger such as a QR code printed on a poster: the user is <b>prompted</b> by a <b>notification</b> to their smartphone similar to an SMS, with an onscreen message and optional phone vibration. Because a beacon only broadcasts an identifier which is then interpreted by the app on the user’s phone, no data about who is receiving the signal and acting upon it is collected by default. This offers users an anonymous interaction, which may be valued by groups of users such as recent migrants who can be sensitive to perceived privacy issues. As part of the SALSA project we are exploring users’ perceptions of the privacy aspects of location-triggered technologies; investigating how we might both ensure user privacy, yet also consider potential methods of collecting usage data to improve user experience (e. g. by personalizing learning resources based on their previous activities) and optimisation of service provision (placing of beacons, revision of learning activities to reflect users’ needs). SALSA is a small scale pilot project currently in progress in Milton Keynes, and will report on theoretical work,and initial findings from the field trials that are about to commence in Spring 2015. The trials will gather attitudinal, usability and learning-effectiveness data {{from a range of}} current adult English language learners who live or work in the town, and aim to inform educators, city planners, and policy makers about the benefits and challenges of implementing location-based language learning service utilizing smart city infrastructures. 1.
