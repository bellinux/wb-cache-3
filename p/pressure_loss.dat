The steam velocity in the hottest superheater tubes is high, decreasing the tube surface temperature. Low tube surface temperatures are essential to prevent superheater corrosion.

40|$|Hydraulic {{manifolds}} {{are used}} to realize compact circuit layout, but may introduce a high pressure drop in the system. Their design is in fact oriented more toward achieving minimum size and weight than to reducing <b>pressure</b> <b>losses.</b> This work studies the <b>pressure</b> <b>losses</b> in hydraulic manifolds using different methods: Computational Fluid Dynamic (CFD) analysis; semi-empirical formulation derived from the scientific literature, when available; and experimental characterization. The purpose is to obtain the <b>pressure</b> <b>losses</b> when the channels' connections within the manifold are not ascribable to the few classic cases studied in the literature, in particular for 90 ° bends (elbows) with expansion/contraction and offset intersection of channels. Moreover, since CFD analysis is used to predict <b>pressure</b> <b>losses,</b> general considerations of the manifold design may be outlined and this will help the design process in the optimization of flow passages. The main results obtained show how CFD analysis overestimates the experimental results; nevertheless, the numerical analysis represents the correct trends of the <b>pressure</b> <b>losses...</b>|$|R

By means of the chart, the <b>pressure</b> <b>losses</b> due to fluid friction and to momentum changes in the air flow accompanying combustion can be separately evaluated. The pressure-loss chart {{is based on the assumption}} that the <b>pressure</b> <b>losses</b> in the actual combustion chamber can be matched by those of an equivalent combustion chamber of constant cross-sectional area. The concept of the equivalent combustion chamber serves as a convenient basis for comparing the pressure-loss characteristics of combustion chambers of a variety of designs. The over-all <b>pressure</b> <b>losses</b> computed from the pressure-loss chart are within 7 percent of the experimental values for the three types of combustion chambers considered herein...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. The <b>pressure</b> <b>losses</b> {{characteristics}} of the rotating cavity with radial inflow were investigated by testing method. The rotating cavity with oblong and round drum holes inlet and outlet total pressure under different operational state were tested, the influence of non-dimensional mass flow rate and rotating Reynolds number on rotating cavity with a Radial Inflow of different drum holes were analyzed. The results show that total <b>pressure</b> <b>losses</b> of the rotating cavity increases with the rotating Reynolds number and flow coefficient. Structure with oblong drum holes is superior to structure with round drum holes with lower total <b>pressure</b> <b>losses</b> {{in the range of}} the ratio of the flow coefficient and the Reynolds number is less than 0. 048. And structure with round drum holes is superior to structure with oblong drum holes with lower total <b>pressure</b> <b>losses</b> in the range of the ratio of the flow coefficient and the Reynolds number is less than 0. 048...|$|R
25|$|Since {{the main}} {{reservoir}} pipe is kept constantly pressurized by the locomotive, the car reservoirs can be charged independently of the brake pipe, this being accomplished via a check valve to prevent backfeeding into the pipe. This arrangement helps to reduce the above described <b>pressure</b> <b>loss</b> problems, and also reduces the time required for the brakes to release, since the brake pipe only has to recharge itself.|$|E
25|$|Spiral Flow/Cross Flow: One fluid is in spiral {{flow and}} the other in a cross flow. Spiral flow {{passages}} are welded at each side for this type of spiral heat exchanger. This type of flow is suitable for handling low density gas, which passes through the cross flow, avoiding <b>pressure</b> <b>loss.</b> It can be used for liquid-liquid applications if one liquid has a considerably greater flow rate than the other.|$|E
25|$|The EV1 was {{not only}} used to {{showcase}} the electric powertrain, but also premiered a number of features and technologies that would later find their way onto more common GM models and other manufacturers' cars. The EV1 {{was among the first}} production vehicles to utilize aluminum {{in the construction of the}} frame. The car's body panels were made of plastic rather than metal, making the car lightweight and dent resistant. The vehicle was fitted with Anti-lock brakes and a traction control system. Comfort improvements included a keyless entry and ignition system, a special one-way thermal glass for better heat rejection on sunny days, an automated tire <b>pressure</b> <b>loss</b> warning system, electric power steering, and a time-programmable HVAC system.|$|E

25|$|Venom {{plays an}} {{important}} role in the ant's life as it is used to capture prey or for defence. About 95% of the venom's components are water-insoluble piperidine alkaloids, and it is particularly potent on sensitive humans. More than 14 million people are stung by them in the United States annually, where many are expected to develop allergies to the venom. Most victims experience intense burning and swelling, followed by the formation of sterile pustules, which may remain for several days. However 0.6% to 6.0% of people may suffer from anaphylaxis, which can be fatal if left untreated. Common symptoms include dizziness, chest pain, nausea, severe sweating, low blood <b>pressure,</b> <b>loss</b> of breath, and slurred speech. More than 80 deaths have been recorded from red imported fire ant attacks. Treatment depends on the symptoms; those who only experience pain and pustule formation require no medical attention, but those who suffer from anaphylaxis are given epinephrines. Whole body extract immunotherapy is used to treat victims and is regarded as highly effective.|$|E
25|$|Three {{practice}} sessions—two on Friday and a {{third on}} Saturday—were held before the Sunday race. The Friday morning and afternoon sessions lasted ninety minutes each; the third, one-hour session was held on Saturday afternoon. In the first practice session, Alonso set the fastest lap {{with a time of}} one minute and 49.056 seconds, one-tenth of a second faster than Hamilton in second and Rosberg third. Vettel was fourth-fastest, ahead of Ricciardo and Jean-Éric Vergne. Kimi Räikkönen, Button, Daniil Kvyat and Pérez rounded out the session's top ten drivers. Although several drivers narrowly avoided damaging their cars, the session passed relatively smoothly. Vergne's battery was changed, causing him to miss the first hour, but after setting his fastest lap, his car stopped with an energy recovery system failure, ending his session early. Räikkonen's session also ended prematurely when his brakes caught fire. Vettel stopped at the pit lane exit with a sudden oil <b>pressure</b> <b>loss,</b> but was not issued with a ten-place grid penalty because he was running an older engine.|$|E
25|$|One popular {{configuration}} for {{the mixing}} tube {{is a large}} bore tube {{with a series of}} internal baffles which create turbulence in the mixture after the injection point, which causes fairly rapid mixing to a homogenous mixture, which may then be continuously analysed by a monitoring instrument before further processing, or may be directly processed and analysed later from the storage cylinder. Continuous analysis allows adjustment of flow rate of the added gases to correct the mixture if it deviates from the specification. Post-analysis makes correction more difficult. Addition of components may be done in sequence or together. Adding them together means that mixing is done once, and this reduces the <b>pressure</b> <b>loss</b> in the intake system. It is important that the gases are thoroughly mixed before analysis as the analysis will then be more reliable. It is also highly desirable to ensure that the intake gases do not vary significantly in oxygen content over time for safety reasons, as the compressor will probably only be safe for a limited oxygen fraction.|$|E
40|$|In {{oil and gas}} {{drilling}} operations, {{predictions of}} <b>pressure</b> <b>losses</b> and cuttings concentration in the annulus are very complex due to the combination of interacting drilling parameters. Past studies have proposed many empirical correlations to estimate <b>pressure</b> <b>losses</b> and cuttings concentration. However, these developed correlations are limited to their experimental data range and setup, and hence, they cannot be applicable to all cases. CFD methods have the advantages of handling complex multiphase flow problems, as well as, an unlimited number of physical and operational conditions. The present study employs the inhomogeneous (Eulerian-Eulerian) model to simulate a two-phase solid-fluid flow and predict <b>pressure</b> <b>losses</b> and cuttings concentration in eccentric horizontal annuli {{as a function of}} varying drilling parameters: fluid velocity, diameter ratio (ratio of inner pipe diameter to outer pipe diameter), inner pipe rotation speed, and fluid type. Experimental data for <b>pressure</b> <b>losses</b> and cuttings concentration from previous literature compared very well with simulation data, confirming the validity of the current model. The study shows how reliable CFD methods can replicate the actual, yet complex oil and gas drilling operations...|$|R

500|$|People who climb {{mountains}} or fly in non-pressurized {{fixed-wing aircraft}} sometimes have supplemental [...] supplies.

Sudden cabin <b>pressure</b> <b>loss</b> activates chemical oxygen generators above each seat, causing oxygen masks to drop. Pulling on the masks [...] "to start the flow of oxygen" [...] as cabin safety instructions dictate, forces iron filings into the sodium chlorate inside the canister. A steady stream of oxygen gas is then produced by the exothermic reaction.|$|E
500|$|A sudden {{reduction}} in cabin pressure is hazardous to all passengers and crew. Above , a sudden cabin depressurisation would leave a [...] "time of useful consciousness" [...] up to 10–15 seconds for a conditioned athlete. At Concorde's altitude, the air density is very low; {{a breach of}} cabin integrity {{would result in a}} loss of pressure severe enough so that the plastic emergency oxygen masks installed on other passenger jets would not be effective and passengers would soon suffer from hypoxia despite quickly donning them. Concorde was equipped with smaller windows to reduce the rate of loss {{in the event of a}} breach, a reserve air supply system to augment cabin air pressure, and a rapid descent procedure to bring the aircraft to a safe altitude. The FAA enforces minimum emergency descent rates for aircraft and noting Concorde's higher operating altitude, concluded that the best response to <b>pressure</b> <b>loss</b> would be a rapid descent. Continuous positive airway pressure would have delivered pressurised oxygen directly to the pilots through masks.|$|E

40|$|Coiled tubing {{drilling}} {{has become}} an important development direction of drilling. The method of combining theoretical calculation with the experimental verification is adopted to analyze {{the flow of the}} coiled tubing drilling system. A set of experimental bench is developed, three kinds of curvature ratio of coiled tubing are used, and the frictional <b>pressure</b> <b>losses</b> of coiled tubing and partial pressure drop of each downhole tool are tested. The results of experiments with water agree well with rough pipe calculation model. The <b>pressure</b> <b>losses</b> of coiled tube are obviously larger than that of straight tube, and the value of it is about 11 – 17 %. The larger the curvature ratio is, the more the <b>pressure</b> <b>losses</b> of coiled tubing are. The fluid experiment with the polymer presents obviously the drag reduction effect. Experiment of simulated bottom hole assembly shows that partial pressure drop of bottom hole assembly is large. It has a little effect on the <b>pressure</b> <b>losses</b> of coiled tubing when whole bottom hole assemblies are connected. The research results can be used as the basis for formulating coiled tubing drilling process parameters, which will provide a guide for engineering practice...|$|R
2500|$|The {{dome and}} swirler are {{the part of}} the {{combustor}} that the primary air (see Air flow paths below) flows through as it enters the combustion zone. Their role is to generate turbulence in the flow to rapidly mix the air with fuel. Early combustors tended to use bluff body domes (rather than swirlers), which used a simple plate to create wake turbulence to mix the fuel and air. Most modern designs, however, are swirl stabilized (use swirlers). The swirler establishes a local low pressure zone that forces some of the combustion products to recirculate, creating the high turbulence. However, the higher the turbulence, the higher the <b>pressure</b> <b>loss</b> will be for the combustor, so the dome and swirler must be carefully designed so as not to generate more turbulence than is needed to sufficiently mix the fuel and air.|$|E
2500|$|On 10 May 1974 KLM Noordzee Helikopters S-61N PH-NZC crashed {{en route}} to an oil rig in the North Sea. None of the two crew and four {{passengers}} survived.

The uncontrollable aircraft landed hard in the water, capsized and sank. Investigation indicated that the metal fatigue crack must have spread rapidly {{in less than four}} hours. The rotor blades are pressurized with nitrogen gas at 10PSI to indicate the onset of a metal fatigue failure, yet no <b>pressure</b> <b>loss</b> was indicated during the preflight inspection.

[...] Bench tests showed that the increase in speed was not significant and the device was not flight tested. In 1943 the idea was reconsidered as a counter to the threat of the V1. Aircraft such as the Hawker Tempest and Gloster Meteor were not widely available and the Spitfire would only be able to intercept in a diving attack. A. D. Baxter and C. W. R.
