40|$|In this paper, a {{theoretical}} and experimental investigation on an innovative cycloidal speed reducer is presented. The typical cycloid drive has a <b>planet</b> <b>wheel,</b> {{the profile of}} which is the internal offset of an epitrochoid meshing with cylindrical rollers connected to the case. This reducer, on the contrary, has an external ring gear, the transverse profile {{of which is the}} external offset of an epitrochoid and engages with the <b>planet</b> <b>wheel</b> by means of cylindrical rollers. This paper investigates the structural characteristics and the kinematic principles of this type of reducer. A theoretical approach based on the theory of gearing (following Litvin’s approach) is developed and compared to a development of Blanche and Yang’s approach. Furthermore, a simplified procedure to calculate the force distribution on cycloid drive elements, its power losses, and theoretical mechanical efficiency is presented. The effects of design parameters on the values of forces are studied for an optimal design of this type of reducer. The theoretical model is tuned {{on the basis of the}} results of tests made on purpose. The mechanical efficiency dependency on speed and torque is described. The main aim of this work is to tune {{a theoretical}} model in order to predict the operating behavior of the cycloid drive and to improve its design procedure...|$|E

To improve load {{capacity}} of fabricated single-arm planetary carrier, and enlarge its applied fields, the calculation criterion of {{load capacity}} of fabricated single-arm planetary carrier under given interference amount is described according to relevant calculation theories in this paper. Some experiments {{have been carried}} out to verify the influence of different interference amounts forced on load capacity, and also the variation of force is confirmed while the <b>planet</b> <b>wheel</b> axle is pressed into the body of planetary carrier with given interference amount. The theoretical basis and reference of fabricated single-arm planetary carrier is ultimately put forward and applied in some relevant engineering practice...|$|E

For simplicity of the design and high performance the pinion of the gear has no bearing. It is centered by the <b>planet</b> <b>wheels</b> only. The original design showed a strong instability and a natural frequency increasing with the load between 2 and 6. 5 MW. In this operating range the natural frequency was below the operating speed of the gas turbine, n sub PT = 7729 RPM.

5000|$|The {{roots of}} Yue Minjun's style {{can be traced}} back to the work of Geng Jianyi, which had first {{inspired}} Yue with his work of his own laughing face. Over the years, Yue Minjun's style has also rapidly developed. Yue often challenges social and cultural conventions by depicting objects and even political issues in a radical and abstract manner. He has also shifted his focus from the technical aspects to the [...] "whole concept of creation". In the mid 1990s, the godfather of Chinese contemporary art Mr. Li Xianting tagged Yue Minjun a Cynical Realism mark, Cynical Realism means describe the living status with a cynicism and mocking ridicule art attitude, using self-opinion to understand political and commercial. [...] "Yue’s pieces are mocking himself and the community, free himself and vent his emotions"." [...] Art critics have often associated Yue with the Cynical Realism art movement in contemporary Chinese art. Yue is currently residing with fifty other Chinese artists in the Songzhuang Village. Since his debut, the work of Yue Minjun has been featured in numerous galleries in Singapore, Hong Kong and Beijing. His piece Execution became the most expensive work ever by a Chinese contemporary artist, when sold in 2007 for £2.9 million pounds (US $5.9 million) at London's Sotheby's. Until its sale at Sotheby's Hong Kong in 2007, this painting had been owned by Trevor Simon, a junior investment banker who bought it with about a third of his salary while working in the region. Simon kept this painting in storage for 10 years as required by the conditions of sale. The record sale took place week after his painting Massacre of Chios sold at the Hong Kong Sotheby's for nearly $4.1 million. 'Massacre of Chios' shares its name with a painting of the same name, by Eugène Delacroix, depicting the 1822 event in Greek history. As of 2007 thirteen of his paintings had sold for over a million dollars. One of his most popular series was his [...] "Hat" [...] collection. This series, pictures Yue's grinning head wearing a variety of hats—a chef's hat, a Special Forces beret, the helmet of a British policeman, Catwoman's mask, and so on. The artist tells us that the series is about a [...] "sense of the absurdity of the ideas that govern the sociopolitical protocol surrounding hats." [...] The series nicely illustrates the way that Yue's character is universally adaptable, a sort of logo that can be attached to any setting to add value. When asked to participate in the Venice Biennale in 1999, Yue opted to begin fabricating bronze sculptural versions [...] of his signature self-portrait paintings, playing off China's famous Qin Dynasty army of terracotta warriors. While the ancient sculptures are known for the subtle individuality of each of the warriors, his cackling modern-day version are relentlessly identical, cast from the same mold. In Noah's Ark, six of Yue's self-portraits sit in a small rowboat on a blue sea, squatting together, gripping their knees and screaming in silent laughter. In Solar System, three identical Yues are cackling at the bottom of the canvas, each clad only in underwear, giant <b>planets</b> <b>wheeling</b> behind them in outer space.During the [...] "Year of China" [...] in France in 2003/2004, he participated to the exhibition [...] "China, the body everywhere?"

40|$|This {{report is}} a {{continuation}} of previous publications edited within the cooperation between Wikov Gear, s. r. o and IT ASCR and oriented on investigation of dynamic properties of four-planetary gearing box with fixed carrier of planet gears. Linear computing model of dynamic behaviour of gearing box {{is based on the assumption}} of solid gearing’s wheels, constant stiffness of bearings and of planets’ pins. Also the contact stiffness in gearings are supposed to be constant with the mean value. Due to the vide helical gearing with manifold contacts the periodical variability of contact stiffness is neglected. The very week support of sun wheel and elastic supports of <b>planets</b> and ring <b>wheels</b> results in the general plane motion of all wheels. periodicity of four-planetary gearing results in existence of several multiple eigen-frequencies in frequency spectrum. As the gearing box works always in connection with other aggregates, the simple models of driving and breaking systems were jointed to the input and output shafts. Eigen-frequency spectrum corresponding modes of vibrations and transfer functions among all elements were ascertained for this 20 DOF system. Numerical computing is completed by graphical records of eigen-modes as well as of transfer functions. ...|$|R
