The {{idea of a}} relatively small amount must be kept in perspective as even metal-rich astronomical objects contain low percentages of any element other than hydrogen or helium; metals constitute only a tiny percentage of the overall chemical makeup of the universe, even 13.8 billion years after the Big Bang. However, metal-poor objects are even more primitive. These objects are formed during an earlier time of the universe. Intermediate Population I stars are common in the bulge near the centre of our galaxy, whereas <b>Population</b> <b>II</b> <b>stars</b> found in the galactic halo are older and thus more metal-poor. Globular clusters also contain high numbers of <b>population</b> <b>II</b> <b>stars.</b> It is thought that <b>population</b> <b>II</b> <b>stars</b> created all the other elements in the periodic table, except the more unstable ones. An interesting characteristic of <b>Population</b> <b>II</b> <b>stars</b> is that despite their lower overall metallicity, they often have a higher ratio of alpha elements (O, Si, Ne, etc.) relative to Fe as compared to Population I stars; current theory suggests {{this is the result}} of Type II supernovae being more important contributors to the interstellar medium {{at the time of their}} formation, whereas Type Ia supernovae metal enrichment came later in the universe's evolution.|$|R

50|$|The Central Bulge {{contains}} <b>Population</b> <b>II</b> <b>stars,</b> {{which are}} old stars of low metallicity, and have low surface temperatures. For this reason the central bulge glows an orange/red color. The disk {{of the galaxy}} is full of star formation, and Population I stars, which are metal-rich, with high surface temperatures, causing the disk to glow blue. Surrounding the galaxy is a halo that {{is made up of}} old <b>Population</b> <b>II</b> <b>stars,</b> as well as globular clusters, which are groups of <b>Population</b> <b>II</b> <b>stars</b> that are spherical in shape and contain roughly one million stars. Star formation takes place in the spiral arms of the galaxy. The rotation velocity of the galaxy is nearly uniform throughout the entire disk. The reason for this is due to an even bigger halo of postulated dark matter that extends beyond the size of the galaxy. This dark matter is to date made up of an unknown substance which radiates no light, and accounts for up to 90% of the mass in a total galaxy.|$|R
50|$|That this is {{not merely}} a {{philosophical}} issue {{can be seen from the}} history of distance measurements using Cepheid variables. In the 1950s, Walter Baade discovered that the nearby Cepheid variables used to calibrate the standard candle were of a different type than the ones used to measure distances to nearby galaxies. The nearby Cepheid variables were population I stars with much higher metal content than the distant <b>population</b> <b>II</b> <b>stars.</b> As a result, the <b>population</b> <b>II</b> <b>stars</b> were actually much brighter than believed, and when corrected, this had the effect of doubling the distances to the globular clusters, the nearby galaxies, and the diameter of the Milky Way.|$|R

However, later research suggests that Kapteyn b is just an artefact of stellar activity and that Kapteyn c needs more study to be confirmed. The metallicity of Kapteyn's star is estimated to be about 8 times less than the Sun.|$|R

Extended high-resolution spectroscopic observations since around 1995 (with Chris Sneden from the University of Texas at Austin as the leading observer) allowed observers to determine the abundances of 53 chemical elements in this star, as of December 2005 only second in number to the Sun.|$|E

Because the star is not completely metal-free, it does not belong to the first generation of stars (the hypothetical Population III). These stars converted the pristine hydrogen, helium, and lithium formed by the Big Bang into heavier elements, such as carbon, oxygen, and metals.|$|E

50|$|SDSS J102915+172927 or Caffau's star is a <b>population</b> <b>II</b> <b>star</b> in {{the galactic}} halo, {{seen in the}} {{constellation}} Leo. It is about 13 billion years old, {{making it one of}} the oldest stars in the Galaxy. At the time of its discovery, it had the lowest metallicity of any known star. It is small (less than 0.8 solar masses), deficient in carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, and completely devoid of lithium. Because carbon and oxygen provide a fine structure cooling mechanism that is critical in the formation of low-mass stars, the origins of Caffau's star are somewhat mysterious. It has been suggested, both for theoretical and observational reasons, that the formation of low-mass stars in the interstellar medium requires a critical metallicity somewhere between 1.5×10−8 and 1.5×10−6. The metallicity of Caffau's star is less than 6.9×10−7. According to Schneider et al., cooling by dust rather than the fine structure lines of CII and OI may have enabled the creation of such low-mass, metal-poor stars in the early universe. The absence of lithium implies past temperatures of at least two million Kelvins.|$|E
5000|$|Because HD 140283 {{is neither}} {{on the main}} {{sequence}} nor a red giant, {{its position in the}} Hertzsprung-Russell diagram can be interpreted with theoretical models of stellar evolution to infer the stellar age. For field stars (as opposed to stars in clusters) it is rare to know a star's luminosity, surface temperature and composition precisely enough to get a well-constrained value for the stellar age; because of their relative scarcity, this is even rarer for a <b>Population</b> <b>II</b> <b>star</b> like HD 140283. One recent study used the Fine Guidance Sensors of NASA's Hubble Space Telescope to measure a precise parallax (and therefore distance and luminosity) for the star, and employ this information to estimate an age for the star of 14.46 ± 0.8 billion years. Due to the uncertainty in the value, this age for the star may not conflict with the age of the Universe determined by the Planck satellite, 13.799 ± 0.021. Once dubbed the [...] "Methuselah Star" [...] by the popular press due to its age, the star must have formed soon after the Big Bang {{and is one of the}} oldest stars known. Accurate determinations of the ages of metal-poor stars, such as HD 140283 and those in globular clusters, set a lower limit for the possible age of the Universe independent of cosmological theory or observations.|$|E

40|$|International audienceThe Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe (WMAP) {{determination}} of the baryon-to-photon ratio implies, through big bang nucleosynthesis, a cosmological Li abundance larger, {{by a factor of}} 2 - 3, than the Li abundance plateau observed in the oldest <b>Population</b> <b>II</b> <b>stars.</b> It is, however, inescapable that there be a reduction by a factor of at least 1. 6 - 2. 0 of the surface Li abundance during the evolution of <b>Population</b> <b>II</b> field <b>stars</b> with [Fe/H]<=- 1. 5. That the observed Li should be lower than cosmologically produced Li is expected from stellar evolution models.
