50|$|There {{are many}} types of <b>plotter</b> <b>pen,</b> {{some of which are}} no longer mass-produced. Technical pen tips are often used, many of which can be renewed using parts and {{supplies}} for manual drafting pens. Early HP flatbed and grit wheel plotters used small, proprietary fiber-tipped or plastic nib disposable pens.|$|E
50|$|One type of <b>plotter</b> <b>pen</b> uses a {{cellulose}} fiber rod inserted {{through a}} circular foam tube saturated with ink, {{with the end}} of the rod sharpened into a conical tip. As the pen moves across the paper surface, capillary wicking draws the ink from the foam, down the rod, and onto the paper. As the ink supply in the foam is depleted, the migration of ink to the tip begins to slow down, resulting in faint lines. Slowing the plotting speed will allow the lines drawn by a worn-out pen to remain dark, but the fading will continue until the foam is completely depleted. Also, as the fiber tip pen is used, the tip slowly wears away on the plotting medium, producing a progressively wider, smudged line.|$|E
50|$|Ball-point <b>plotter</b> <b>pens</b> with refillable {{clear plastic}} ink {{reservoirs}} are available. They {{do not have}} the fading or wear effects of fiber pens, but are generally more expensive and uncommon. Also, conventional ball-point pens can be modified to work in most <b>pen</b> <b>plotters.</b>|$|R
50|$|Unlike other printer types, <b>pen</b> <b>plotter</b> {{speed is}} {{measured}} by pen speed and acceleration rate, instead of by page printing speed. A <b>pen</b> <b>plotter's</b> speed is primarily limited {{by the type of}} pen used, so the choice of pen is a key factor in <b>pen</b> <b>plotter</b> output speed. Indeed, most modern <b>pen</b> <b>plotters</b> have commands to control slewing speed, {{depending on the type of}} pen currently in use.|$|R

40|$|One of {{the most}} time {{consuming}} facets of custom Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) design is obtaining hardcopy plots of the mask geometries of cells and chips. The traditional method of generating these plots {{is to use a}} multicolor pen <b>plotter.</b> <b>Pen</b> plotters are inherently slow and the plotting speed increases linearly with the number of edges that must be plotted. A moderate custom chip design at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) now consists of more than 200, 000 such edges and can take as much as eight hours to plot using a pen plotter. Software is described that was written at JPL to produce similar plots using a laser printer. It is shown that, for rather small layouts, the laser printer can provide nearly instantaneous turnaround. For moderate to large chip designs, the laser printer provides a factor of five or more improvement is speed over pen plotting...|$|E

This means that plotters are vector graphics devices, rather than raster graphics as with other printers. <b>Pen</b> <b>plotters</b> can draw complex line art, including text, but do so slowly because of the mechanical movement of the pens. They are often incapable of efficiently creating a solid region of color, but can hatch an area by drawing a number of close, regular lines.|$|R

40|$|The drawn {{artifact}} and the act {{of drawing}} are uniquely suited for design thinking. Specifically, drawings that were traditionally crafted "by hand" are prone to qualities that promote a productive multiplicity of interpretations. These qualities are often incompletely characterized using terms such as "fuzzy" or "loose. " Digital output, however, is biased toward the notion of re-production. Representation in design, as a result, has become image-centric. This project explores a method for computing drawing (and the converse, drawing computing) by programing a vintage <b>pen</b> <b>plotter.</b> An apparatus that spans from the computational to the material allows for the incorporation of the desirable qualities of the "hand" drawing into a digital process. The same limitations {{that led to the}} obsolescence of the <b>pen</b> <b>plotter</b> lead to an integrated relationship between process and project. <b>Pen</b> <b>plotters</b> demand linear (rather than pixel) information. Imperfections resulting from ink-filled pens making contact with paper at various speeds mandate the consideration of time. A range of computational methods for representing line and making drawing are documented and implemented. A set of 32 drawings are framed in terms related to their making, and then evaluated in terms of their implications for architectural representation. by Carl Lostritto. Thesis (S. M.)

The software is based on the “What-You-See-Is-What-You-Get ” (WYSIWYG) paradigm where the user manipulates a graphical model that the output of the mechanical devices will ultimately map to. CAD programs are a form of WYSIWYG software. Output from CAD programs are commonly used for outputing to engraving machines and <b>pen</b> <b>plotters.</b> If one considers that the command interpretation from the software to the mechanical device controls largely the movements of the engraving or plotting head, the same idea could be used to control a roving robot. The controller plots out the movements of the robot all before execution occurs. This sort of control is not difficult to understand and can be designed for use by students. In fact, a simple drawing program can be designed for use as a CAD program for an engraver and <b>pen</b> <b>plotter</b> and as a robot controller that can be used by elementary school students...|$|R
