5|$|His fourth {{minister}} of economy, Domingo Cavallo, was appointed in 1991. He deepened the neoliberal reforms. The Convertibility plan was {{sanctioned by the}} Congress, setting a one-to-one fixed exchange rate between the United States dollar and the new Argentine peso, which replaced the Austral. The law also limited public expenditures, but this was frequently ignored. There was increased free trade to reduce inflation, and high taxes on sales and earnings {{to reduce the deficit}} caused by it. Initially, the plan was a success: the capital flights ended, interest and inflation rates were lowered, and economic activity increased. The money from privatizations allowed Argentina to repurchase many of the Brady Bonds issued during the crisis. The privatizations of electricity, water, and gas were more successful than previous ones. YPF, the national oil refinery, was privatized as well, but the state kept a good <b>portion</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>shares.</b> The project to privatize the pension funds was resisted in Congress, and was approved as a mixed system that allowed both public and private options for workers. The national state also signed a fiscal pact with the provinces, so that they reduced their local deficits as well. Buenos Aires Province was helped with a fund that gave the governor a million pesos daily.|$|E
25|$|In the UK {{there was}} {{initially}} a widespread {{belief that a}} corporation needed to demonstrate its creditworthiness by having its shares only partly paid, as where shares are partly paid, the investor would be liable {{for the remainder of}} the nominal value in the event that the company could not pay its debts. Shares with nominal values of up to £1,000 were therefore subscribed to with only a small payment, leaving even a limited liability investor with a potentially crushing liability and restricting investment to the very wealthy. During the Overend Gurney crisis (1866–1867) and the Long Depression (1873–1896) many companies fell into insolvency and the unpaid <b>portion</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>shares</b> fell due.

ResponseBase became a steadily larger company over time and an offer was made by eUniverse to buy the company.

50|$|Rights {{issues may}} be underwritten. The {{role of the}} {{underwriter}} is to guarantee that the funds sought by the company will be raised. The agreement between the underwriter {{and the company is}} set out in a formal underwriting agreement. Typical terms of an underwriting require the underwriter to subscribe for any shares offered but not taken up by shareholders. The underwriting agreement will normally enable the underwriter to terminate its obligations in defined circumstances. A sub-underwriter in turn sub-underwrites {{some or all of the}} obligations of the main underwriter; the underwriter passes its risk to the sub-underwriter by requiring the sub-underwriter to subscribe for or purchase a <b>portion</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>shares</b> for which the underwriter is obliged to subscribe in the event of a shortfall. Underwriters and sub-underwriters may be financial institutions, stock-brokers, major shareholders of the company or other related or unrelated parties.|$|E
50|$|Baker and Savasoglu {{contend that}} the best single {{predictor}} of merger success is hostility: only 38% of hostile deals were successfully consummated, while so-called friendly deals boasted a success rate of 82%. Cornelli and Li contend that arbitrageurs are actually {{the most important element}} in determining the success of a merger. Since arbitrageurs have made significant financial bets that the merger will go through, it is expected that they will push for consummation. For this very reason, the probability that the merger will consummate increases as arbitrageur control increases. In their study, Cornelli and Li found that the arbitrage industry would hold as much as 30%-40% of a target’s stock during the merger process. This represents a significant <b>portion</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>shares</b> required to vote yes to deal consummation in most mergers. Thus, takeovers in which arbitrageurs bought shares had an actual success rate higher than the average probability of success implied by market prices. As a result, they can generate substantial positive returns on their portfolio positions.|$|E

Buenos Aires Province was helped with a fund that gave the governor a million pesos daily.Although the Convertibility plan had positive consequences in the short term, it caused problems that surfaced later. Large numbers of employees of privatized state enterprises were fired, and unemployment grew to over 10%. Big compensation payments prevented an immediate public reaction. The free trade, and the expensive costs in dollars, forced private companies {{to reduce the number of}} workers as well, or risk bankruptcy. Unions were unable to resist the changes. People with low incomes, such as retirees and state workers, suffered under tax increases while their wages remained frozen. The provinces of Santiago del Estero, Jujuy and San Juan had their first violent riots. To compensate for these problems, the government started a number of social welfare programs, and restored protectionist policies over some sectors of the economy. It was difficult for Argentine companies to export, and easy imports damaged most national producers. The national budget soon slid into deficit.|$|E

50|$|As already mentioned, group {{foraging}} brings both {{costs and}} benefits to <b>the</b> members <b>of</b> that group. Some <b>of</b> <b>the</b> benefits <b>of</b> group foraging include being able to capture larger prey, being able to create aggregations of prey, being able to capture prey that are difficult or dangerous and most importantly reduction of predation threat. With regard to costs, however, group foraging results in competition for available resources by other group members. Competition for resources can be characterized by either scramble competition whereby each individual strives to get a <b>portion</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>shared</b> resource, or by interference competition whereby <b>the</b> presence <b>of</b> competitors prevents a forager's accessibility to resources. Group foraging can thus reduce an animal's foraging payoff.|$|R
