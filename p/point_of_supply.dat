2500|$|On 5 October, Blamey {{wrote to}} MacArthur in [...] "hard terms" [...] of the {{logistical}} difficulties faced by NGF and specifically, Allen. [...] Despite this, Blamey and MacArthur pressured Allen {{to increase his}} rate of advance and Blamey forced the issue by only arranging for supplies to be dropped at Myola – effectively forcing Allen to advance to meet his <b>point</b> <b>of</b> <b>supply.</b> [...] Anderson discusses this and identifies it as an [...] "extremely risky" [...] strategy. [...] Blamey (and Herring) wanted Allen to maintain pressure on the retreating Japanese and push home the advantage. [...] Dropping supplies forward maintains the momentum of advance but this quickly breaks down if the advance is stalled and there are limited reserves. [...] The position of Blamey was premised on {{the proposition that the}} Japanese were an enemy in retreat. [...] In fact, they had made a clean break from Ioriabiawa and had established defences that were blocking Allen's advance on both routes to Templeton's Crossing. With supplies dropped at Myola, Allen could not easily support the advance being made along the Mount Bellamy track and, until the position forward of Templeton' Crossing was secured, there was the risk of Myola being compromised.|$|E

30|$|It {{should be}} {{noticed that the}} devices were first biased under a {{moderate}} range to prevent the luminance degradation and voltage drift caused by overstress [16]. The threshold voltages are 26, 18, and 13 for devices, 1, 2, and 3, respectively. The thicknesses (TEMI) of polymer/QD films with spin speeds of 2, 000, 3, 000 and 4, 000  r/min were as 573, 374, and 314  nm measured by α-step method, respectively. The polymer/QD film is thicker than pure polymer film in the same spin speed. It {{can be attributed to}} the contribution of QDs on viscosity. The threshold voltage is obviously decreased with TEMI decreasing. If the threshold voltage divided by TEMI, about 0.41 [*]~[*] 0.45 [*]×[*] 108  V/m would be derived. Such a high field could generate injecting of carriers into the quantum dots [17]. This field is often observed in PLEDs, and it suggests that the injection current may be limited by space charge effect or tunneling effect within polymer LED [18]. Moreover, the output luminance is also dramatically increased with TEMI increasing as seen in Figure  4 b. The PLEDs have a feature of luminance characteristics. The maximum luminance can be obtained at some <b>point</b> <b>of</b> <b>supplied</b> current. Luminance is gradually extinct beyond that <b>point</b> <b>of</b> <b>supplied</b> current.

5000|$|A {{distinction}} {{should be}} made between the voltage at the <b>point</b> <b>of</b> <b>supply</b> (nominal system voltage) and the voltage rating of the equipment (utilization voltage). Typically the utilization voltage is 3% to 5% lower than the nominal system voltage; for example, a nominal 208 V supply system will be connected to motors with [...] "200 V" [...] on their nameplates. This allows for the voltage drop between equipment and supply. Voltages {{in this article are}} the nominal supply voltages and equipment used on these systems will carry slightly lower nameplate voltages. Power distribution system voltage is nearly sinusoidal in nature. Voltages are expressed as root mean square (RMS) voltage. Voltage tolerances are for steady-state operation. Momentary heavy loads, or switching operations in the power distribution network, may cause short-term deviations out of the tolerance band.
