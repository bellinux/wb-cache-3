40|$|<b>Patient</b> <b>monitoring</b> is a {{major part}} of many {{healthcare}} services. It can reduce the number of un-necessary hospitalizations, while increasing the access to healthcare to those who really need these services. Wireless and mobile technologies are finding a role in <b>patient</b> <b>monitoring</b> in several different environments: homes, hospitals, and nursing homes. However, due to several limitations including unpredictable and spotty coverage of users by wireless networks, the quality and reliability of <b>patient</b> <b>monitoring</b> have not been highly satisfactory.

Patients with {{life-threatening}} conditions require constant {{monitoring of}} their vital signs, such as {{heart rate and}} respiration rate. This task is usually performed by a nurse using a bedside <b>monitor</b> for each <b>patient.</b> These devices require a nurse to remain physically close to the patient at all times and each device allows for the monitoring of only one patient at a time. Although nurses can remotely <b>monitor</b> <b>patients</b> from the nursing station, they must remain near the nursing station or bedside. In addition, there are functions that are only available at the bedside monitor, such as silencing an alarm. This project presents an alternative to a bedside <b>patient</b> <b>monitor</b> by utilizing a tablet as a mobile <b>patient</b> <b>monitor,</b> giving the nurse more flexibility. The goal {{of this study was}} to establish a set of design guidelines for a mobile <b>patient</b> <b>monitoring</b> application with a user-friendly and efficient interface.

This paper demonstrates the use of SoSE modeling, simulation, verification and validation techniques similar to the emerging draft of INCOSE’s SoSE Engineering Guide to improve the success of such projects.

40|$|Mobile <b>patient</b> <b>monitoring</b> {{refers to}} {{continuous}} or frequent measurement {{and analysis of}} biosignals of a patient by employing mobile computing and wireless communication technologies ‐ irrespective of patient’s location. Some of the common biosignals are ElectroEncephaloGram (EEG), MagnetoEncephaloGram (MEG), Galvanic Skin Response (GSR), ElectroCardioGram (ECG) and Heart Rate Variability (HRV). Common problems observed during the trials of mobile <b>patient</b> <b>monitoring</b> systems are as follows: 1) Due to patient mobility and wireless networks availability changes, continuity of <b>patient</b> <b>monitoring</b> is affected; 2) The QoS offered by currently deployed wireless networks is variable ‐ and hence {{it may not be}} sufficient to transmit higher amount of biosignals data; and 3) The duration of a mobile <b>patient</b> <b>monitoring</b> session is affected due to limited battery capacity of a mobile device. This thesis researches solution to these problems using context‐aware computing paradigm and vertical handover technique. Herewith, we propose two context‐aware vertical handover mechanisms which address wireless network connectivity problems resulting from patient mobility and select the wireless network that best satisfies QoS requirements of continuous biosignals delivery. Following the context‐aware computing paradigm, we also adapted proposed handover mechanism to use a wireless network interface the use of which reduces power consumption of certain types of handheld mobile devices used in a mobile <b>patient</b> <b>monitoring</b> system...|$|R

The remote monitoring system proposed and developed in this thesis {{has the ability to}} provide doctors/healthcare professionals with 24 -hour access to real-time patient information, as well as historical data of every one of their patients. A prototype automated <b>patient</b> <b>monitoring</b> system was constructed to demonstrate general telemedicine system design concepts.

This stand-alone prototype automated <b>patient</b> <b>monitoring</b> system was successfully designed, built, and tested.

Longitudinal <b>patient</b> <b>monitoring</b> systems have been widely recommended for use to detect clinical deterioration.

This study aims to evaluate the implementation and effectiveness of a longitudinal <b>patient</b> <b>monitoring</b> system designed for adult patients in the unique environment of the Emergency Department (ED). Methods A novel participatory action research (PAR) approach is taken where socio-technical systems (STS) theory and analysis informs the implementation through the improvement methodology of ‘Plan Do Study Act’ (PDSA) cycles. We hypothesise that conducting an STS analysis of the ED before beginning the PDSA cycles will provide for a much richer understanding of the current situation and possible challenges to implementing the ED-specific longitudinal <b>patient</b> <b>monitoring</b> system.

40|$|<b>Patient</b> <b>monitoring</b> and {{connected}} medical devices are dramatically changing for providing more care and health services. A WBAN {{is based on}} IEEE 802. 15. 6, allowing near field communication up to one-meter range from the human body. In <b>patient</b> <b>monitoring,</b> the physiological data is sensed by sensor and forward to the medical professional, where the received data is continuously compared with the original data base of a patient. In order to give more care to patients, {{it is necessary to}} <b>monitor</b> the <b>patient</b> when they are in motion. This gives a promising way to assist the medical professionals for improving their <b>monitoring</b> abilities. Mobile <b>patient</b> <b>monitoring</b> system detects the patient’s situation when he/she is in motion and allows a patient to roam around the hospital without health professional. For proper communication between the mobile nodes of the <b>patient</b> <b>monitoring</b> system, the IEEE standard WLAN and WPAN are to be implemented. When the patient is moving in the arbitrary trajectory an unpredictable topology and link instability is formed, that make routing protocols a core issue. Different routing protocols such as AODV, DSR, DSDV, and AOMDV have been analysed in NS 2 for different types of <b>patient</b> <b>monitoring</b> scenario. Most WLAN are based on IEEE 802. 11 and provide wireless connection between the nodes for the communication. This gives users the ability to move around within a local coverage area up to hundred meter range and still be connected to the network. WPAN system is designed under IEEE 802. 15. 4 standard and provides interconnection of communicating devices. Also it can serve for more specialized purpose such as allowing the surgeon and other team members to communicate during an operation inside the operation theatre.
