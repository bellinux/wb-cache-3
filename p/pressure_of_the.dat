5|$|Immersion of {{the human}} body in water affects the circulation, renal system, fluid balance, and breathing, because the {{external}} hydrostatic <b>pressure</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> water provides support against the internal hydrostatic <b>pressure</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> blood. This causes a blood shift from the extravascular tissues of the limbs into the chest cavity, and fluid losses known as immersion diuresis compensate for the blood shift in hydrated subjects soon after immersion. Hydrostatic pressure on the body from head-out immersion causes negative pressure breathing which contributes to the blood shift.|$|E

5|$|If the {{concentration}} of the inert gas in the breathing gas is reduced below that {{of any of the}} tissues, there is a tendency for gas to return from the tissues to the breathing gas. This is known as out-gassing, and occurs during decompression, when the reduction in ambient pressure reduces the partial <b>pressure</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> inert gas in the lungs. This process may be complicated by the formation of gas bubbles, and the modeling is more complex and varied.|$|E

40|$|Triolein (TO) and {{phospholipids}} ({{egg yolk}} phosphatidylcholine, egg yolk phosphatidylethanolamine, and bovine brain phosphatidylserine) had low mutual solubilities and separated into the TO-liquid phase and phospholipid-bilayers. Spreading <b>pressures</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> TO-phospholipid mixture (i. e., surface <b>pressures</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> mixed monolayer in equilibrium with the phase-separating lipid mixture) at the air/saline interface were independent <b>of</b> <b>the</b> lipid composition. On the other hand, collapse <b>pressures</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> mixed monolayer <b>of</b> TO and phospholipid (i. e., surface <b>pressures</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> mixed monolayer in equilibrium with the TO-liquid phase) at the interface {{changed with the}} monolayer composition and were lower than the spreading pressure. The experimental data indicated the spreading and collapse pressures as offering a phase diagram for <b>the</b> presence <b>of</b> equilibrium between <b>the</b> mixed monolayer, the phospholipid-bilayers and the TO-liquid phase.
