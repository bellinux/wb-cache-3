5|$|Scarification had {{its origins}} in Nri mythology. Nri, the son of Eri who {{established}} the town of Nri, {{was said to have}} pleaded to Chukwu (the Great God) because of hunger. Chukwu then ordered him to cut off his first son's and daughter's heads and <b>plant</b> <b>them,</b> creating a 'blood bond' between the Igbo and the earth deity, Ana. Before doing so, Nri was ordered to mark ichi onto their two foreheads. Coco yam, a crop managed by females, sprang from his daughter's head, and yam, the Igbo peoples' staple crop, sprung from his son's head; Chukwu had taught Nri plant domestication. From this, the eze Nri's first son and daughter were required to undergo scarification's seven days after birth, with the eze Nri's daughter being the only female to receive ichi. Nri, the son of Eri, also gained knowledge of the yam medicine (ogwu ji). People from other Igbo communities made pilgrimages to Nri in order to receive this knowledge received in exchange for annual tributes.|$|E

To clean them rub the capsules through a screen. It's advised to <b>plant</b> <b>them</b> in the late spring or early summer because division {{takes place in the}} spring.

500|$|The next day, {{he asked}} Green—who had no {{interest}} in gardening that he knew of—what she had intended to do with the seeds. Though she initially claimed {{that she was going to}} <b>plant</b> <b>them,</b> when pressed she said that she intended to use them to commit suicide. Green's drinking was especially heavy that day, and as her behavior grew stranger, Farrar contacted the police for assistance in placing Green into psychiatric care. Police who responded to the home described Farrar and the children as [...] "shaken" [...] and Green's behavior as [...] "bizarre". Though Green did not seem to hold the police's presence against them and gave them no resistance, she denied being suicidal and called Farrar a series of obscenities. Farrar showed police the seed packets and other items he had found in her purse the day before, and the police transported Green to a nearby emergency room. The physician who attended her there found Green to be smelling strongly of alcohol, but not visibly drunk. Though Green appeared unkempt, the doctor felt her demeanor was not unusual for someone going through a bitter divorce and noted that Green professed no desire to hurt herself or others when the doctor interviewed her privately. However, when Farrar came into view in the hospital, Green's demeanor changed. According to the doctor, Green spat at him, called him obscene names, and stated that [...] "You're going to get these kids over our dead bodies". Though Green, with some persuasion by the doctor, initially agreed to a voluntary commitment, she shortly thereafter left the ER without informing anyone. She was found hours later, apparently having decided to walk home from the hospital, and brought back to the hospital. There, she agreed again to a voluntary commitment to the Menninger Clinic in Topeka, Kansas.|$|E

2500|$|Conservation {{of forests}} and {{resources}} is {{mandated by the}} Strangite church. Within Strang's Beaver Island kingdom and other places where Strangites were numerous, groves of trees were to be maintained upon each farm, village and town. Farms and cities without trees were required to <b>plant</b> <b>them,</b> and to establish parklands so that [...] "the aged and the young may go there to rest and to play." [...] Although Strang's kingdom has disappeared, his followers still endeavor to practice basic conservation measures.|$|E
2500|$|One of {{the biggest}} {{challenges}} of reintroducing plants back into the wild is the unintended introduction of unwanted species, such as pests, diseases, and invasive weeds. [...] Often, it is human destruction of areas in which the Sarracenia thrive that is a major killer. Aside from determining what genetic material is appropriate for reintroduction (which is up for debate), plants must be semi-aseptic to keep the habitat pristine and sustainable in the long term. [...] Another challenge is maintaining all of the introduced plant material and determining an optimal site to <b>plant</b> <b>them</b> in. [...] A single hurricane or storm event can change the dynamics of a field. [...] Even within a single bog, some areas may be waterlogged, while other areas may become very dry, so identifying the right location is critical. [...] Short term results on private property indicate planting larger specimens into the field have a higher chance of long term survival compared to planting smaller seedlings.|$|E
2500|$|Taro {{is used in}} the Tết dessert chè khoai môn {{which is}} sticky rice pudding with taro roots. [...] The stems are also used in soups such as canh chua. One is called Khoai sọ, which is smaller in size and more delicious than Khoai môn, and of course, more {{expensive}} than Khoai môn. Another more popular taro plants the roots grow in shallow waters and the stems and leaves above the surface of the water. This taro plants have saponins-like substances that make the endurable feeling of hot and itch in the mouth and throat. Northern farmers used to <b>plant</b> <b>them</b> to cook the stems and leaves to feed their hogs for their high speed of re-growth from their roots. After the cooking, the saponins in the soup of taro stems and leaves reduce to the level the trained hogs can eat. Nowadays, this practice is no longer widely popular in Vietnam agriculture. These taro plants are commonly called as khoai ngứa which literally means itchy potato.|$|E

2500|$|The Chesapeake Bay is {{also home}} to a diverse flora, both land and aquatic. Common {{submerged}} aquatic vegetation includes eelgrass and widgeon grass. A report in 2011 suggested that information on underwater grasses would be released, because [...] "submerged grasses provide food and habitat for a number of species, adding oxygen to the water and improving water clarity." [...] Other vegetation that makes its home {{in other parts of the}} Bay are wild rice, various trees like the red maple and bald cypress, and spartina grass and phragmites. Invasive plants have taken a significant foothold in the Bay; plants such as Brazilian waterweed, native to South America, have spread to most continents with the help of aquarium owners, who often dump the contents of their aquariums into nearby lakes and streams. It's highly invasive, and has the potential to flourish in the low-salinity tidal waters of the Chesapeake Bay. Dense stands of Brazilian waterweed can restrict water movement, trap sediment and affect water quality. Various local K-12 schools in the Maryland and Virginia region often have programs that cultivate native bay grasses and <b>plant</b> <b>them</b> in the Bay.|$|E
