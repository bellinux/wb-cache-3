Organic compost application significantly improved the dry biomass accumulation in wheat (Carpenter-Boggs et al. 2000). In agreement with this, our study also showed significantly higher radish dry biomass on organic formulations application. One hundred percent PG-treated plants showed significantly lower radish root length, shoot length, dry weight and root length of Chinese cabbage compared to that of diluted treatments and control.

Of 4216 xenobiotics tested, with cellulose-bound xyloglucan as donor-substrate, 18 inhibited XET activity and 18 promoted it (especially anthraquinones and flavonoids). No compounds promoted XET in quantitative assays with (cellulose-free) soluble xyloglucan as substrate, suggesting that promotion was dependent on enzyme–cellulose interactions. With cellulose-free xyloglucan as substrate, we found 22 XET-inhibitors – especially compounds that generate singlet oxygen (1 O 2) e. g., riboflavin (IC 50 29 μM), retinoic acid, eosin (IC 50 27 μM) and erythrosin (IC 50 36 μM). The riboflavin effect was light-dependent, supporting 1 O 2 involvement. Other inhibitors included tannins, sulphydryl reagents and triphenylmethanes. Some inhibitors (vulpinic acid and brilliant blue G) were relatively specific to XET, affecting only two or three, respectively, of nine other wall-enzyme activities tested; others [e. g.

However, the concentration of ABA in normal and dropped fruitlets decreased during fruit development. The concentration of IAA and GA 3 in normal fruitlets were significantly higher than those in dropped fruitlets during fruit development, whereas the concentration of ABA in normal fruitlets were significantly lower than that in dropped fruitlets. Consideration of plant growth promoters (IAA and GA 3) and <b>plant</b> <b>growth</b> <b>inhibitor</b> (ABA) ratio showed that IAA/ABA ratio in normal fruitlets at 6 week, 8 week and 10 week after fruit set were 7. 54, 7. 99 and 9. 42, respectively, which were significantly higher than those in dropped fruitlets (1. 81, 3. 21 and 3. 77, respectively).

Compared to controls, {{differences in the}} concentration of different mineral nutrients occurred in leaves collected shortly after fruit harvest: in Pbz-treated trees, the concentration of N and K significantly decreased, whereas that of Mg and Mn increased. Leaves of trees sprayed with GA 3 had a significantly lower concentration of N and Ca and Mn, and a slightly greater concentration of K. In spite of these changes, element concentrations were within accepted ranges and therefore the nutritional status of peach trees did not change with the application of both growth regulators.

It was {{the aim of this}} study to extend the current knowledge base through the analysis of phosphatidylcholine metabolism in response to a variety of hormonal signals. Gibberellin treatment promoted cell elongation, which was accompanied by an increase in the synthesis of cellular phospholipids Metabolic studies involving radiolabelled precursors of phosphatidyicholine, revealed a generalized switching off of the CDP-choline pathway coupled to a concomitant increase in flux through the phospholipid methyltransferase pathway upon long term exposure to gibberellic acid in conjunction with a decrease in CTP: phosphocholine cytidylyltransferase activity. Inhibition of phosphatidic acid production in these cultures resulted in a further increase in the flux through the phospholipid methyltransferase pathway. Jasmonie acid treatment resulted in an increase in cell proliferation coupled with an overall increase in phospholipid and triacyiglycerol synthesis and a decrease in the PC: PE ratio. Short term jasmonic acid treatment, whilst having no effect on the carbon flux through the phospholipid methyltransferase pathway, led to an increase in carbon flux through the CDP-choline pathway. However, in the long term this effect was diminished, the activity of the CTP: phosphocholine cytidylyltransferase decreased and an increase in phosphatidyicholine synthesis using methyl moieties occurred. Inhibition of phosphatidic acid by butan- 1 -ol treatment counteracted the increased labeling of cellular lipids from radiolabelled methyl donor molecules. An increase in cell elongation was evoked by abscisic acid treatment. Typically, abscisic acid treated cells contained less phospholipid than their control counterparts. The hormone had little effect on the cellular amounts of triacylglycerols, however an increase in the PC: PE ratio occurred. Short teni abscisic acid treatment resulted in an increase in the incorporation of both radiolabelled choline and methyl groups into cellular lipids. After long term exposure of the cells to abscisic acid, no difference was observed in the overall incorporation of choline and methyl groups into cellular lipids due to a plateau effect being achieved. Treatment with butan- 1 -ol to reduce phosphatidic acid production had no influence over the functioning of the phospholipid methyltransferase pathway in abscisic acid treated cells...|$|R

40|$|Introduction: Salinity is {{a common}} abiotic stress that seriously affects crop {{production}} {{in some parts of}} the world, particularly in arid and semi-arid regions. The deleterious effects of salinity on plant growth are associated with low osmotic potential of soil solution (water stress), nutritional imbalance, specific ion effect (salt stress), or a combination of these factors. Paclobutrazol (PBZ), a member of the triazole <b>plant</b> <b>growth</b> <b>inhibitor</b> group, is a broad-spectrum gibberellin biosynthesis inhibitor. Triazoles have both fungal toxicity and plant growth regulatory effects. They also increase tolerance of various plant species to biotic and abiotic stresses, including fungal pathogens, drought, air pollutants, and low- and high-temperature stress. According to our knowledge, there are no reports on the effects of exogenous PBZ enhancing vegetative peach- almond hybrid (GF 677) rootstock tolerance to salt stress. Therefore, the objective of this work was the possibility test of this idea that PBZ application would protect GF 677 rootstock from damaging effects of salinity. Materials and Methods: One-year-old rooted cuttings of GF 677 were grown in in plastic pots in the research greenhouse of Agricultural College, Isfahan University of Technology of Iran. The minimum and maximum temperatures during the experiment period were 19 and 32 ˚C, respectively. After cutting establishment (3 months), the plants were sprayed twice (with a 7 days interval) with 0 (control), 20 and 40 mg l- 1 PBZ to the point of run-off. One week after the second foliar application of PBZ, each plants was subjected to one of several salt stress treatments. The salt treatments (0, 25 and 50 mM NaCl) were applied to the pots intervals in 0. 5 l of irrigation water. To avoid osmotic shock, the NaCl concentration was increased gradually. The layout was a 3 × 3 factorial experiment in a completely randomized design, with four replications. The experimental measurements were carried out 60 days after beginning the salt treatments. Results and Discussion: The results showed that salt stress and application of PBZ significantly affected injury rating valve (IRV). The Injury rating value of plants was found to increase significantly as the salt concentration was raised. After exposure to salt stress those plants that did not receive PBZ exhibited higher symptoms of salt injury. There was a significant interaction between salinity and PBZ application. The lowest IRV in all NaCl concentrations observed when 20 mg l- 1 PBZ was applied. Salinity caused significant decrease leaf parameters so that the lowest means of leaf number (12. 5) and leaf fresh weight (6. 52 g) were recorded at 50 mM NaCl treatment, showing a 55. 80...|$|E
30|$|The {{abscisic acid}} (ABA), {{which is a}} <b>growth</b> <b>inhibitor,</b> is {{involved}} in fruit development, but knowledge of its precise role and mode of action remains poorly detailed [4, 5]. The ABA levels show a reduction at fruit set and this decrease was associated with downregulation of ABA biosynthesis genes and regulation of the gene encoding the enzymes involved in degradation of ABA after pollination [6]. The ABA also abolishes changes induced by gibberellic acid (GA) during fruit set in pea [7].

40|$|The {{plant hormone}} auxin {{is a central}} {{regulator}} of <b>plant</b> <b>growth.</b> TRANSPORT <b>INHIBITOR</b> RESPONSE 1 /AUXIN SIGNALING F-BOX (TIR 1 /AFB) is {{a component of the}} E 3 ubiquitin ligase complex SCFTIR 1 /AFB and acts as an auxin co-receptor for nuclear auxin signaling. The SCFTIR 1 /AFB-proteasome machinery plays a central regulatory role in development-related gene transcription. Populus trichocarpa, as a model tree, has a unique fast-growth trait to which auxin signaling may contribute. However, no systematic analyses of the genome organization, gene structure and expression of TIR 1 -like genes have been undertaken in this woody model plant. In this study, we identified a total of eight TIR 1 genes in the Populus genome that phylogenetically clustered into four subgroups, PtrFBL 1 /PtrFBL 2, PtrFBL 3 /PtrFBL 4, PtrFBL 5 /PtrFBL 6 and PtrFBL 7 /PtrFBL 8, representing four paralogous pairs. In addition, the gene structure and motif composition were relatively conserved in each paralogous pair and all of the PtrFBL members localized in the nucleus. Different sets of PtrFBLs were strongly expressed in the leaves, stems, roots, cambial zones and immature xylem of Populus. Interestingly, PtrFBL 1 and 7 were expressed mainly in cambial and vascular tissues, respectively, indicating their potential roles in wood formation. Furthermore, Populus FBLs responded differentially upon exposure to various stresses. Collectively, these observations lay the foundation for further investigations into the potential roles of PtrFBL genes in tree growth and development...|$|R

Leaf and stem tissues of B. sarothroides were extracted with 80 % methanol (v/v). This extract was reduced to an aqueous phase in vacuo and partitioned with ethyl acetate at pH 7. 3 (NF, neutral fraction), pH 2. 8 (AF, acidic fraction), and again at pH 2. 8 following hydrolysis at pH 11 (HF, hydrolyzed fraction). Thin layer chromatography (TLC) on silica gel H in chloroform:ethyl acetate:formic acid (CHCl₃:EtOAc:HCOOH) produced a region between R(f) 's 0. 5 to 0. 6 from AF of B. sarothroides which inhibited wheat seed coleoptile and radicle growth 52. 7 % and 66. 5 %, respectively, using 500 ul of a 1. 9 mg/ul extract. This section inhibited wheat coleoptile straight growth 38. 6 % at the same concentration. Additional TLC, UV spectrophotometry, spray reagents, NMR, and GC/MS indicated that the compound was 3, 8 -dihydroxy- 5, 6, 7 -trimethoxy- 2 -(4 -methoxyphenyl) - 4 H- 1 -benzopyran- 4 -one at a concentration of 265 ug/g fresh weight. This compound significantly inhibited the wheat coleoptile straight growth bioassay 18. 4 % using 2 to 3 ug/ul. An 80 % methanol extract of H. acradenius leaves evaporated in vacuo produced an aqueous insoluble brown resin. This resin dissolved in absolute methanol and separated by TLC in CHCl₃:EtOAc:HCOOH contained a region between R(f) 's 0. 6 to 0. 7 that inhibited wheat seed coleoptile growth 71. 8 % and radicle growth 90. 7 % using 200 ul of 1. 5 mg/ul solution. Wheat coleoptile straight growth was inhibited 53. 7 % in this region at the same concentration. Further examination of this region by the same methods as those used for B. sarothroides indicated {{the presence of a}} C- 12 alkenyl alcohol (2 mg/ml), an aromatic heterocyclic hydrocarbon (4 mg/ml), and an alkyl substituted version of 7 -hydroxycoumarin (5 mg/ml) at a concentration of 0. 7, 1. 4, and 1. 8 ug/g fresh weight, respectively. A combination of these compounds inhibited the wheat coleoptile straight growth bioassay 41. 1 % using 11 ug/ul. A 2 M HCl extract of H. acradenius was partitioned with diethyl ether, which was evaporated and the residue resuspended in 95 % methanol. TLC in CHCl₃:EtOAc:HCOOH separated an area between R(f) 's 0. 5 to 0. 6 where wheat seed coleoptile growth was inhibited 49. 7 % and radicle growth was inhibited 54. 6 % using 1000 ul of a 3. 3 mg/ul solution.

The use of <b>plant</b> <b>growth</b> regulators (PGRs) in papaya (Carica papaya L.) tissue culture {{is essential for}} tissue and organ culture in vitro. In this study, {{in a bid to}} expand the information available on the response to PGRs, a wide range of PGRs, roughly divided into four groups (auxins, cytokinins, alternative PGRs, <b>growth</b> <b>inhibitors</b> and retardants) was tested. Among them, the auxins 2, 4 -D, dicamba and picloram formed most callus (hard and soft). Callus inductions by chitosan and coconut water are novel results for papaya. Shoots only formed in response to BA and TDZ, but TDZ-induced shoots were fasciated and/or hyperhydric. These results provide novel perspectives for papaya researchers who may have recalcitrant genotypes or tissues that are unresponsive in vitro. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to evaluate the effects of three growth retardants on the development and yield of dry bean plants. The treatments were control (water), maleic hydrazide (0. 09 g a. i. L- 1), ethyl-trinexapac (0. 5 g a. i. L- 1) and propiconazole (0. 125 g a. i. L- 1). Maleic hydrazide decreased the <b>plant</b> <b>growth</b> rate, resulting in the height reduction (46 %). It also inhibited the twining shoot development, thus controlling the vigor excess of this genotype which has indeterminate growth. On the other hand, plants which were treated with ethyl-trinexapac and propiconazole showed the higher heights (from 25 to 52 %, respectively), indicating that both compounds provide the <b>plant</b> <b>growth.</b> These compounds also increased the number of pods (48 to 52 %) and grains (47 to 102 %), when compared to the control. However, ethyltrinexapac and maleic hydrazide decreased 50 -grain dry mass (41 to 52 %), indicating changes in the photoassimilate partition among plant structures. This change was evidenced by the correlation coefficient of the biomass allocated between the shoots and grains, which was inversely proportional (r=- 60. 57) and highly significant (p= 0. 0002). It is concluded that maleic hydrazide is an efficient <b>growth</b> <b>inhibitor</b> of dry bean plants. Propiconazole and ethyl-trinexapac provide the <b>plant</b> <b>growth,</b> and also improve the main yield components. However, ethyl-trinexapac and maleic hydrazide decrease grain biomass...|$|R
