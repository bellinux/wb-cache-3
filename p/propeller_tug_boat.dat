Minto {{was the best}} of the fleet for dealing with these conditions, which could result in ice 10 inches thick across the entire upper lake. In some winters, Minto was unable to travel to lower Arrow Lake, and C.P.R. used the steam <b>propeller</b> passenger and <b>tug</b> <b>boat</b> Columbia to take her place.In the very cold winter of 1916, Kootenay became icebound {{at the southern end of}} the Narrows between upper and lower Arrow Lakes. Minto with her steel-sided hull, was sent down from Nakusp to take her passengers (fortunately there were not many). Minto could not reach Koontenay but was able to get close enough so the passengers could walk over the ice or on shore to get to Minto. Kootenay was eventually able to work free, but her hull was permanently damaged.|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT: Method {{of design}} and {{analysis}} of bollard pull harbour tug focuses in its stability and straight movement. Research includes {{a brief review of}} general description of bollard pull harbour <b>tug,</b> <b>tug</b> <b>boat</b> functions, <b>tug</b> <b>boat</b> characteristics, functions, operation modes, requirements for <b>tug</b> <b>boats,</b> stability standard and factor affecting stability, stability requirements, displacement and buoyancy, fundamental {{of design and}} a very last, fundamental of analysis. This research also discuss about the methodology to implement the design and analysis to measure the stability and movement of the <b>tug</b> <b>boat.</b> The purpose of design modelling is to identify the error of the existing design and to redesign to eliminate or reduce errors. The error consists of the hull structure and skeg design. However to redesign the hull and skeg must be done during design stage. For this report, it will discuss only the basis of the design methodology. The analysis of the stability and straight movement of the bollard pull harbour tug are using software analysis. SolidWorks and ANSYS are the proposed analysis software that will implement for this thesis. The analysis of the <b>tug</b> <b>boat</b> is study on static and dynamic analysis that discuss about finite element analysis and hydrodynamic analysis. Dynamic analysis is important part because it deals with how the <b>tug</b> <b>boat</b> moving in a stable and balanced during its operation...|$|R

2500|$|Final {{preparations}} to refloat {{the ship}} began on 28 June 2007 when the ballast water, added earlier to stabilise the vessel, was pumped out to aid buoyancy.

An ocean swell up to [...] pounded the ship and caused the bow to move back and forth even when tethered to the <b>tug</b> <b>boats.</b> Soon after the attempt started to shift the ship, one of the cables connecting the ship to the <b>tug</b> <b>boat</b> Keera snapped dashing the attempt. This resulted in the decision to make another attempt after the salvage crews could regroup.|$|R
