Relative to the moderate condition, physiological responses were greater in the hot condition. The percentage change in body mass was different (p 1 % body mass loss and/or net body mass gain. STATEMENT OF RELEVANCE: Currently, the UK Emergency Services do not have specific evidence-based fluid replacement guidelines to follow when wearing chemical, biological, radiological and/or nuclear (CBRN) PPE. Although ad libitum fluid replacement is encouraged (when breathing apparatus permits), recommendations from evidence-based findings specific to different PPE and to different environmental conditions are lacking. This study provides novel evidence supporting {{the need to develop}} fluid replacement strategies during CBRN deployments in both moderate and hot environmental conditions for CBRN PPE...|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{determine}} if using an N 95 filtering face-piece respirator concurrently with a loose-fitting <b>powered</b> air-purifying <b>respirator</b> (PAPR) offers additional protection to the wearer. METHODS: We used a breathing mannequin programmed to deliver minute volumes of 25 L/min and 40 L/min. We measured the baseline protection factor of the PAPR with its motor operational and then deactivated (to simulate mechanical or battery failure). We tested 3 replicates of 3 different N 95 models. We glued each N 95 to the breathing mannequin and obtained a minimum protection factor of 100 at 25 L/min. We then placed the PAPR on the mannequin and took protection factor measurements with the N 95 -plus-PAPR combination, at 25 L/min and 40 L/min, with the PAPR operational and then deactivated. RESULTS: The N 95 significantly increased the PAPR’s protection factor, {{even with the}} PAPR deactivated. The effect was multiplicative, not merely additive.

50|$|Comparison of {{the results}} of tests of various types of {{respirators}} in the laboratories and in the workplaces showed that laboratory tests do not allow to properly assess the real effectiveness of respirators (even if they are applied without interruption).

This field measurements revealed low efficiency of several types of respirators, and forced more strictly limit their use: for negative pressure air-purifying respirators with full face mask and high efficiency filters - from 500 PEL to 50 PEL (USA), from 900 OEL to 40 OEL (UK);for <b>Powered</b> Air-Purifying <b>Respirators</b> with loose-fitting facepiece (hood or helmet) — from 1000 PEL to 25 PEL (USA), PAPR with half mask — from 500 PEL to 50 PEL (USA), for supplied Air Respirators with full face mask and continuous air supply mode - from 100 OEL to 40 OEL (UK); for SCBA and SAR with air supply on demand mode — from 100 PEL to 50 PEL (USA).|$|R

During nanoparticle synthesis, the number concentrations in the process room may exceed 10 × 106 cm− 3.

Here we have studied the in-use program protection factor (PPF) of loose-fitting <b>powered</b> air purifying <b>respirators,</b> while workers were coating components with TiO 2 or Cu x O y nanoparticles under a hood using a liquid flame spray process. The PPF was measured using condensation particle counters, an electrical low pressure impactor, and diffusion chargers. The room particle concentrations varied from 4 × 106 to 40 × 106 cm− 3, and the count median aerodynamic diameter ranged from 32 to 180 nm. Concentrations inside the respirator varied from 0. 7 to 7. 2 cm− 3. However, on average, tidal breathing was assumed to increase the respirator concentration by 2. 3 cm− 3. The derived PPF exceeded 1. 1 × 106, which is more than 40 × 103 times the respirator assigned protection factor. We were unable to measure clear differences in the PPF of respirators with old and new filters, among two male and one female user, or assess most penetrating particle size.

During the SARS outbreak in Toronto, a survey of HCWs found that > 60  % of respondents reported SARS-related concern for their own or their family’s health [29]. Moreover, 29  % of respondents had probable emotional distress [29]. During our outbreak, many ICU staff expressed concerns about acquiring MERS. Staff safety should be a primary goal in a hospital infectious outbreak. Pregnant and immunocompromised staff should be redeployed to lower-risk areas [30], which we did. Proper exposure management should be pre-planned, which was determined in our IDEP. N 95 respirator fit testing should be performed at hiring of new staff and done for all other staff before any outbreak.

Strict infection prevention and control practices should be implemented and audited. This was performed in our units. Repetitive training is recommended [31]. Despite intensive infection prevention practices, 3 of our ICU staff had MERS-CoV infection during the outbreak likely due to suboptimal PPE use while intubating yet undiagnosed patients.|$|R

Area sampling of ultrafine particles (UFP) was performed at 33 worksites in parallel with the collection of respirable particles. Personal sampling of respirable and inhalable particles {{was carried out in}} the breathing zone of 241 welders. Median mass concentrations were 2. 48 mg m− 3 for inhalable and 1. 29 mg m− 3 for respirable particles when excluding 26 users of <b>powered</b> air-purifying <b>respirators</b> (PAPRs). Mass concentrations were highest when flux-cored arc welding (FCAW) with gas was applied (median of inhalable particles: 11. 6 mg m− 3). Measurements of particles were frequently below the limit of detection (LOD), especially inside PAPRs or during tungsten inert gas welding (TIG). However, TIG generated a high number of small particles, including UFP. We imputed measurements <LOD from the regression equation with manganese to estimate determinants of the exposure to welding fume. Concentrations were mainly predicted by the welding process and were significantly higher when local exhaust ventilation (LEV) was inefficient or when welding was performed in confined spaces. Substitution of high-emission techniques like FCAW, efficient LEV, and using PAPRs where applicable can reduce exposure to welding fume. However, harmonizing the different exposure metrics for UFP (as particle counts) and for the respirable or inhalable fraction of the welding fume (expressed as their mass) remains challenging...|$|R
