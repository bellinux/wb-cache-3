According to the IAEA's Safeguards Statement for 2007, of the 82 states where both NPT safeguards and an Additional Protocol are implemented, the IAEA had found no indication of undeclared nuclear activity in 47 states, while evaluations of possible undeclared nuclear activity remained ongoing in 35 states.

5000|$|Iran's Khodadad Seifi {{responded to}} {{allegations}} against the Iranian nuclear programme saying that Iran has an inalienable right to peaceful nuclear energy and is fully committed to its non-proliferation agreements, {{that it has}} always been for peaceful purposes and that Iran continues to fully cooperate with the IAEA. All activities are carried out under the agency‚Äôs cameras and resident inspectors regularly visit the sites and measure and seal uranium containers. Some cooperation, it said, is even beyond the legal obligations so as to build more trust and confidence; non-diversion has always been confirmed by the agency. He added that the [...] "agency continues to verify the material at the nuclear facilities by Iran in accordance with the agreement." [...] He further noted that all countries have right to nuclear energy and none to nuclear weapons: ‚Äúnuclear energy for all and nuclear weapons for no one.‚Äù Iran addresses genuine proliferation but rejects conflating peaceful nuclear energy with developing nuclear weapons. In addition to obligations, he said, Islamic teaching is against pursuing nuclear weapons program. Nuclear weapons do not bring security but are the greatest threat to nuclear-haves and have-nots. As {{there is no reason to}} accept nuclear weapons but many reasons to abolish them all, nuclear weapons have no place in the defence doctrine of Iran. Yet some countries express concerns over Iranian nuclear weapons and there is a deep mistrust by Iran over the policies and intentions of these countries. Therefore there is a need to build mutual trust that is possible only by resorting to the force of logic not the logic of force. The golden rule is to resort to diplomacy alone. Sustainable solutions are attainable only by peaceful and respectful negotiations. For its part, Iran expresses full readiness to stick to meaningful time-bound negotiations. Iran stands ready to ensure its nuclear program will be exclusively peaceful and remove concerns of other parties and acknowledge the inherent right of Iran to peaceful nuclear energy including a full national fuel cycle. As such sanctions, whether unilateral or multilateral, should be lifted. Mutual respect and equal treatment is essential for a win-win situation. Other parties need to adopt the same approach. Moreover Iran underlines the important contribution other countries can make to the process. Iran takes this opportunity to thank all countries that support sovereign rights to peaceful science and tech and those who have supported, in the past several days, the Iranian programme. However, he cited the as yet extremely inflammatory statement by the ‚Äúlast speaker‚Äù with allegations against the <b>peaceful</b> <b>nuclear</b> <b>activities</b> of Iran and it would not dignify such unfound accusations with answers other than categorically rejecting them all. He said that Netanyahu tried to ‚Äúmislead this august body‚Äù about the nuclear programme, but that unlike last year his comments tried to be more royal than a king by setting a standard for Iranian nuclear activities and level of enrichment. As such, he must know that no one can dictate to Iran what to do and not to do. ‚ÄúAs a party to the NPT, Iran is fully aware of its rights and is fully committed to its obligations. Indeed the one who is badly in need to be educated about these issues is Israel, the only non-party to the NPT in the Middle East. And to that end Israel no choice but to accede to the NPT without delay and place all its nuclear possessions under IAEA safeguards. Netanyahu talked of WMDs in the Middle East without mention that Israel is the only one in the region that possesses all types of WMDss but is still not party to any treaty banning them.‚Äú Netanyahu also did not mention the proposed 2012 conference on the establishment of a WMD free zone in the Middle East which was not convened only due to Israeli objections. Similarly to last year, he continued sabre rattling to Iran by abusing the General Debate by threatening a founding member of the body that was intended to prevent breaches of the peace according to the UN charter. Despite this Israel enjoys full freedom and is ‚Äúproud of all atrocities and over 10 wars waged in 65 years by the Israel regime against all neighbours and others as well. It may wish to apply for an international award certifying the ability of Israeli forces in never ending savage attacks against people under occupation, in particular women and innocent children.‚Äù Iran warned that Israel should seriously avoid miscalculation about Iran and that Iran‚Äôs century‚Äôs old policy of non-aggression should not be seen as an inability to defend itself not because of its ability but its principled policy of rejecting the use of force. Iran is proud of being the best in exercising the inherent right to self-defence under Article 51 of the UN charter. Thus Netanyahu better not think of attacking Iran let alone planning for that. In conclusion, to point allegedly made by Iran‚Äôs foreign minister at the General Debate: ‚Äúwe have been accused of having a smile attack, a smile attack is better than a military attack‚Äù he then concluded that ‚Äúindeed a smile policy is better than lying.‚Äù ...|$|E

Argentina and Brazil, the :Latin American nations most capable of building nuclear weapons, refuse {{to comply with the}} treaty. Argentine and Brazilian military leaders pursued the development of nuclear weapons fro the 1970 's to the late 1980 's. The emergence of democratic regimes from the 1980 's encouraged the gradual "denuclearization" of weapons research in these nations. In July 1991, the presidents of Argentina and Brazil signed an accord in Guadalajara, Mexico, each promising to abandon the development of nuclear weapons. The risks of nuclear proliferation may be reduced because of this agreement. The Guadalajara Accord offers hope that nuclear proliferation in Latin America can be slowed and perhaps stopped. The establishment of civilian control over the military and the reduction I the belligerent rivalry between Argentina and Brazil are central factors in ending the quest for nuclear weapons.
