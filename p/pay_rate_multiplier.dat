40|$|This study {{examines}} {{the role of}} government <b>pay</b> <b>rates</b> in economic growth. A trend decline in government <b>pay</b> <b>rates,</b> expressed relative to what an economy can afford, is identified in many developing countries. The decline is attributed to the erosion of economic rents. Drawing on the theoretical insights of the Harris- Todaro two sector model, the study argues that static and dynamic benefits from the erosion of rents would lead to a negative relationship between government <b>pay</b> <b>rates</b> and economic growth. Utilizing the pooled regression models as well as the feasible two-stage generalized method of moments estimator, the study concludes that relative government <b>pay</b> <b>rates</b> are negatively related with economic growth in developing countries; hence, high government <b>pay</b> <b>rates</b> penalize economic growth. Countries that retain high government <b>pay</b> <b>rates</b> are identified...|$|R
40|$|I have {{developed}} a new rate multiplication method. I call it ideal because {{the quality of the}} frequency approximation that it makes is maximized, and it extends the range of its frequency scaling factor to all the rational numbers between zero and one. In addition, each input control code produces a unique output frequency. The input code is necessarily not straight binary, so the circuit is not pin compatible with other rate multipliers. I designed the ideal <b>rate</b> <b>multiplier</b> as a method for easily producing just tempered musical intervals. Even a three bit ideal <b>rate</b> <b>multiplier</b> produces many recognizable musical intervals. I built a prototype of a seven bit ideal <b>rate</b> <b>multiplier</b> which plays eleven notes of the twelve tone scale. The design itself is academically interesting, and deals with recursion and rational numbers...|$|R

40|$|The {{search for}} the optimal form of {{government}} has long {{attracted the attention of}} economists. As of the late 1980 s, empirical studies of the size of government were weighted to the view that the international trend to larger governments was impeding economic growth. This view has been contested by more recent studies drawing on endogenous growth theory and improved estimation techniques. This study highlights the importance of government <b>pay</b> <b>rates</b> as well as government size. International panel data indicate that an international trend to higher government employment shares has been associated with a decline in government relative <b>pay</b> <b>rates.</b> This study hypothesized rents have been embedded in government <b>pay</b> <b>rates</b> in many developing countries and that static and dynamic benefits of the erosion of these rents embodied would lead to a negative relationship between relative government <b>pay</b> <b>rates</b> and economic growth in developing countries. This hypothesis follows the theoretical framework of the Harris-Todaro two sector model. Utilizing the pooled regression models as well as the feasible two-stage generalized method of moments estimator, the study concludes that relative government <b>pay</b> <b>rates</b> are indeed negatively related with economic growth in developing countries; hence, high government <b>pay</b> <b>rates</b> penalize the economic growth. No relationship is identified between the government employment share and economic growth. Countries that retain high relative government <b>pay</b> <b>rates</b> are identified as includin...|$|R

40|$|Abstract:- A novel {{representation}} of process variables as frequency signals {{is presented in}} this paper. Traditional analog computers and transfer function analyzers built using the binary <b>rate</b> <b>multiplier</b> principle did not explicitly consider negative numbers. It is proposed to introduce a two-pin {{system in which the}} sign of the variable is made available as 1 -bit data on one pin and a series of pulses, whose frequency is proportional to the magnitude of the variable on another pin. Using this concept, the binary <b>rate</b> <b>multiplier</b> had been redesigned to accept signals of both the polarities. Integrators can be constructed, feedback of a variable can be realized and summing operation could be performed easily using this new representation...|$|R
