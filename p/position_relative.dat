5|$|Dead reckoning, {{in animals}} usually known as path integration, means the putting {{together}} of cues from different sensory sources within the body, {{without reference to}} visual or other external landmarks, to estimate <b>position</b> <b>relative</b> to a known starting point continuously while travelling on a path {{that is not necessarily}} straight. Seen as a problem in geometry, the task is to compute the vector to a starting point by adding the vectors for each leg of the journey from that point.|$|E

5|$|One {{aspect of}} the Carolinian method of {{estimating}} longitude on inter-island sailings is to visualize the target island relative to a second reference island's alignment with a succession of selected stars, points of the star compass. It is a refined system of dead reckoning whereby the navigator constantly synthesizes his <b>position</b> <b>relative</b> to the reference island's location in his mental model. The most remarkable {{thing is that the}} reference island (lu pongank) may be over the horizon, unseen, even imaginary.|$|E
5|$|For visual localization, {{the robot}} {{estimates}} its <b>position</b> <b>relative</b> to the aircraft using visual elements (doors, windows, tires, static ports etc.) of the aircraft. During {{the evolution of}} the robot, these visual elements are extracted from a three-dimensional virtual model of the aircraft and projected in the image plane of the cameras. The projected shapes are used for pattern recognition to detect those visual elements. The other detection method used is based on the extraction of features with a Speeded Up Robust Features (SURF) approach. A pairing is performed between images of each element to be detected and the actual scene experienced.|$|E
5|$|Similarly, it {{is argued}} that {{evolutionary}} theory is circular reasoning, in that evidence is interpreted as supporting evolution, but evolution is required to interpret the evidence. An example of this is the claim that geological strata are dated through the fossils they hold, but that fossils are in turn dated by the strata they are in. However, in most cases strata are not dated by their fossils, but by their <b>position</b> <b>relative</b> to other strata and by radiometric dating, and most strata were dated before the theory of evolution was formulated.|$|E

5|$|Some {{birds have}} also {{demonstrated}} {{the capacity to}} fall into slow-wave sleep one hemisphere of the brain at a time. The birds tend to exercise this ability depending upon its <b>position</b> <b>relative</b> {{to the outside of}} the flock. This may allow the eye opposite the sleeping hemisphere to remain vigilant for predators by viewing the outer margins of the flock. This adaptation is also known from marine mammals. Communal roosting is common because it lowers the loss of body heat and decreases the risks associated with predators. Roosting sites are often chosen with regard to thermoregulation and safety.|$|E
5|$|Following their {{experiences}} with the Sitgreaves and Whipple expeditions, and encounters with Mormons and the soldiers at Fort Yuma, the Mohave were aware that whites were immigrating to the region in increasing numbers. It was difficult for the Mohave to predict {{the behavior of the}} arriving whites, some of whom, like Whipple, were amiably disposed towards them, whereas others such as the Mormons were hostile. The kwanami were divided on how the situation should be approached; some advocated an aggressive posture, denying whites all passage through their territory, but others, including Irataba, preferred a peaceful approach, or even an alliance with them that could put the Mohave in a stronger <b>position</b> <b>relative</b> to their traditional enemies the Paiute, Chemehuevi, and Walapai.|$|E
5|$|In Aristotle's (384–322BC) {{description}} of the universe, the Moon marked {{the boundary between the}} spheres of the mutable elements (earth, water, air and fire), and the imperishable stars of aether, an influential philosophy that would dominate for centuries. However, in the , Seleucus of Seleucia correctly theorized that tides were due to the attraction of the Moon, and that their height depends on the Moon's <b>position</b> <b>relative</b> to the Sun. In the same century, Aristarchus computed the size and distance of the Moon from Earth, obtaining a value of about twenty times the radius of Earth for the distance. These figures were greatly improved by Ptolemy (90–168AD): his values of a mean distance of 59times Earth's radius and a diameter of 0.292Earth diameters were close to the correct values of about 60 and 0.273 respectively. Archimedes (287–212 BC) designed a planetarium that could calculate the motions of the Moon and other objects in the Solar System.|$|E

5|$|The Decimal Classification {{introduced}} {{the concepts of}} relative location and relative index which allow new books {{to be added to}} a library in their appropriate location based on subject. Libraries previously had given books permanent shelf locations that were related to the order of acquisition rather than topic. The classification's notation makes use of three-digit Arabic numerals for main classes, with fractional decimals allowing expansion for further detail. Using Arabic numerals for symbols, it is flexible to the degree that numbers can be expanded in linear fashion to cover special aspects of general subjects. A library assigns a classification number that unambiguously locates a particular volume in a <b>position</b> <b>relative</b> to other books in the library, {{on the basis of its}} subject. The number makes it possible to find any book and to return it to its proper place on the library shelves. The classification system is used in 200,000 libraries in at least 135 countries.|$|E
5|$|The {{only other}} {{astronomer}} from antiquity known by name who supported Aristarchus's heliocentric model was Seleucus of Seleucia, a Hellenistic astronomer who lived {{a century after}} Aristarchus. According to Plutarch, Seleucus {{was the first to}} prove the heliocentric system through reasoning, but it is not known what arguments he used. Seleucus' arguments for a heliocentric cosmology were probably related to the phenomenon of tides. According to Strabo (1.1.9), Seleucus was the first to state that the tides are due to the attraction of the Moon, and that the height of the tides depends on the Moon's <b>position</b> <b>relative</b> to the Sun. Alternatively, he may have proved heliocentricity by determining the constants of a geometric model for it, and by developing methods to compute planetary positions using this model, like what Nicolaus Copernicus later did in the 16th century. During the Middle Ages, heliocentric models were also proposed by the Indian astronomer Aryabhata, and by the Persian astronomers Albumasar and Al-Sijzi.|$|E
5|$|Variance in {{recovered}} phylogenetic {{positions for}} Eolambia persisted in following years. In the 2009 description of Levnesovia, Hans-Dieter Sues and Alexander Averianov found that Protohadros occupied an intermediate <b>position</b> <b>relative</b> to Altirhinus and Probactrosaurus, being the sister group of Fukuisaurus (results reproduced below). Meanwhile, {{in accordance with}} the results of Horner and colleagues, Albert Prieto-Márquez and Mark Norell found in 2010 that Eolambia was instead the sister group of Protohadros. He also noted features of Eolambia that were convergent upon hadrosaurids: the presence of a single tooth carina; the nearly-square outer corner of the predentary; and the midpoint of the quadratojugal notch (which articulates with the quadratojugal) being located roughly halfway up the surface of the quadrate (being located less than 60% of the bone's height down from the top). In 2012, Holtz classified Eolambia as a primitive member of the Styracosterna along with Altirhinus.|$|E
50|$|From these bases, {{directions}} toward {{objects in}} the sky can be quantified by constructing celestial coordinate systems. Similar to terrestrial longitude and latitude, the equatorial coordinate system specifies <b>positions</b> <b>relative</b> to the celestial equator and celestial poles, using right ascension and declination. The ecliptic coordinate system specifies <b>positions</b> <b>relative</b> to the Earth's orbit, using celestial longitude and latitude. Besides the equatorial and ecliptic systems, some other celestial coordinate systems, such as the galactic coordinate system, are more appropriate for particular purposes.|$|R

5|$|Battles {{take place}} on grid-based {{self-contained}} maps and are governed by a turn-based system where units on both sides are given their chance to move and act. Once a unit has moved, depending on their <b>position</b> <b>relative</b> to allied units and enemies, they may perform actions such as attacking or supporting allied characters through statistic-enhancing abilities, or they can wait until the next turn. When attacking, the game transitions from the top-down view of the map to a side-view battlefield, where a cinematic battle plays between the player and enemy units. Each unit has access to different weapons and items, but these will break {{after a number of}} uses and must be repaired in between missions. The effectiveness of melee weapons is dictated with the series' recurring Weapons Triangle mechanic: axes are strong against lances, lances strong against swords, and swords strong against axes. Villages found during map battles will be attacked; if defended by the player, non-player characters within the village will give hints about future objectives. A map is cleared when the boss is defeated. If characters fall in battle, they are subjected to permanent death, removing them {{from the rest of the}} game. If Roy dies, the game ends and the map must be restarted.|$|E
5|$|Connecting the {{cerebellum}} {{to different}} parts of the nervous system are three paired cerebellar peduncles. These are the superior cerebellar peduncle, the middle cerebellar peduncle and the inferior cerebellar peduncle, named by their <b>position</b> <b>relative</b> to the vermis. The superior cerebellar peduncle is mainly an output to the cerebral cortex, carrying efferent fibers via thalamic nuclei to upper motor neurons in the cerebral cortex. The fibers arise from the deep cerebellar nuclei. The middle cerebellar peduncle is connected to the pons and receives all of its input from the pons mainly from the pontine nuclei. The input to the pons is from the cerebral cortex and is relayed from the pontine nuclei via transverse pontine fibers to the cerebellum. The middle peduncle is the largest of the three and its afferent fibers are grouped into three separate fascicles taking their inputs to {{different parts of}} the cerebellum. The inferior cerebellar peduncle receives input from afferent fibers from the vestibular nuclei, spinal cord and the tegmentum. Output from the inferior peduncle is via efferent fibers to the vestibular nuclei and the reticular formation. The whole of the cerebellum receives modulatory input from the inferior olivary nucleus via the inferior cerebellar peduncle.|$|E
5|$|Finally {{there is}} often a need to correct for the {{apparent}} movement of the stars. On the timescale of human civilisation the stars have largely maintained the same <b>position</b> <b>relative</b> to each other. Each night they appear to rotate around the celestial poles due to the Earth's rotation about its axis. However, the Earth spins rather like a spinning top. Not only does the Earth rotate, it wobbles. The Earth's axis takes around 25,800 years to complete one full wobble. The effect to the archaeoastronomer is that stars did not rise over the horizon in the past in the same places as they do today. Nor did the stars rotate around Polaris as they do now. In the case of the Egyptian pyramids, it has been shown they were aligned towards Thuban, a faint star in the constellation of Draco. The effect can be substantial over relatively short lengths of time, historically speaking. For instance a person born on 25 December in Roman times would have been born with the sun in the constellation Capricorn. In the modern period a person born on the same date would have the sun in Sagittarius due to the precession of the equinoxes.|$|E
50|$|Urban {{geography}} {{is the study}} of cities, towns, and other areas of relatively dense settlement. Two main interests are site (how a settlement is <b>positioned</b> <b>relative</b> to the physical environment) and situation (how a settlement is <b>positioned</b> <b>relative</b> to other settlements). Another area of interest is the internal organization of urban areas with regard to different demographic groups and the layout of infrastructure. This subdiscipline also draws on ideas from other branches of Human Geography to see their involvement in the processes and patterns evident in an urban area.|$|R
