5|$|The {{prefrontal cortex}} plays a {{significant}} role in mediating executive functions. Neuroimaging during neuropsychological tests of executive function, such as the stroop test and working memory tests, have found that cortical maturation of the prefrontal cortex correlates with executive function in children. Planning involves activation of the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), anterior cingulate cortex, angular prefrontal cortex, right prefrontal cortex, and supramarginal gyrus. Working memory manipulation involves the DLPFC, inferior frontal gyrus, and areas of the <b>parietal</b> <b>cortex.</b> Inhibitory control involves multiple areas of the prefrontal cortex as well as the caudate nucleus and subthalamic nucleus.In conditions in which prepotent responses tend to dominate behavior, such as in drug addiction, where drug cues can elicit drug seeking (Chapter 15), or in attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD; described below), significant negative consequences can result.... ADHD can be conceptualized as a disorder of executive function; specifically, ADHD is characterized by reduced ability to exert and maintain cognitive control of behavior. Compared with healthy individuals, those with ADHD have diminished ability to suppress inappropriate prepotent responses to stimuli (impaired response inhibition) and diminished ability to inhibit responses to irrelevant stimuli (impaired interference suppression).... Functional neuroimaging in humans demonstrates activation of the prefrontal cortex and caudate nucleus (part of the striatum) in tasks that demand inhibitory control of behavior.... Early results with structural MRI show thinning of the cerebral cortex in ADHD subjects compared with age-matched controls in prefrontal cortex and posterior <b>parietal</b> <b>cortex,</b> areas involved in working memory and attention.}} Task shifting doesn't involve specific regions of the brain, but instead involves multiple regions of the prefrontal cortex and parietal lobe.|$|E

40|$|Knockout of the {{mitochondrial}} complex I protein, NDUFS 4, profoundly increases {{sensitivity of}} mice to volatile anesthetics. In mice carrying an Ndufs 4 lox/lox gene, adeno-associated virus expressing Cre recombinase was injected into {{regions of the}} brain postulated to affect sensitivity to volatile anesthetics. These injections generated otherwise phenotypically wild type mice with region-specific, postnatal inactivation of Ndufs 4, minimizing developmental effects of gene loss. Sensitivities to the volatile anesthetics isoflurane and halothane were measured using loss of righting reflex (LORR) and movement in response to tail clamp (TC) as endpoints. Knockdown (KD) of Ndufs 4 in the vestibular nucleus produced resistance to both anesthetics for movement in response to TC. Ndufs 4 loss in the central and dorsal medial thalami and in the <b>parietal</b> association <b>cortex</b> increased anesthetic sensitivity to both TC and LORR. Knockdown of Ndufs 4 only in the <b>parietal</b> association <b>cortex</b> produced striking hypersensitivity for both endpoints, and accounted for half the total change seen in the global KO (Ndufs 4 (KO)). Excitatory synaptic transmission in the <b>parietal</b> association <b>cortex</b> in slices from Ndufs 4 (KO) animals was hypersensitive to isoflurane compared to control slices. We identified a direct neural circuit between the <b>parietal</b> association <b>cortex</b> and the central thalamus, consistent with a model in which isoflurane sensitivity is mediated by a thalamic signal relayed through excitatory synapses to the <b>parietal</b> association <b>cortex.</b> We postulate that the thalamocortical circuit is crucial for maintenance of consciousness and is disrupted by the inhibitory effects of isoflurane/halothane on mitochondria...|$|R

Bilateral carotid ischemia-reperfusion is found to inhibit anti-apoptotic reaction of nerve cells of the <b>parietal</b> lobe <b>cortex</b> in the early and late post-ischemic periods {{at the expense of}} decreased number of Bcl- 2 +-cells and concentration of Bcl- 2 protein in them. In glial cells during the early period of ischemic-reperfusion injury the activity of anti-apoptotic processes intensifies to some extent by means of increased concentration of Bcl- 2 protein in them, and on the 12 th day the activity of anti-apoptotic processes decrease at the expense of reduced amount of Bcl- 2 +-cells and the content of Bcl- 2 protein in them.

This study aimed to observe the changes in DMN induced by increasing doses of propofol and progressively deepening sedation. Methods: Twelve healthy subjects were selected; they received target-controlled infusion of propofol (1. 0 and 3. 0  µg/mL of plasma) and underwent functional magnetic resonance imaging before sedation and when they achieved light and deep sedation states. The average degree, average shortest path length, global efficiency, local efficiency, and clustering coefficient of DMN were assessed to study the overall and internal changes of DMN with gradual changes in alertness level, as well as the relationship between thalamus and DMN. Meanwhile, basic vital signs and respiratory inhibition were recorded. Results: DMN parameters were gradually inhibited with decreasing level of alertness, the differences were significant between light sedation and awake states (all P< 0. 01), but not between deep and light sedation states. However, the shortest path lengths of the posterior cingulate cortex, medial prefrontal <b>cortex,</b> and lateral <b>parietal</b> <b>cortexes</b> in the DMN were significantly increased under deep sedation. Conclusion: Overall, DMN is propofol-sensitive. A small dose of propofol can significantly inhibit the DMN, affecting the level of alertness. The posterior cingulate cortex, medial prefrontal <b>cortex,</b> and lateral <b>parietal</b> <b>cortexes</b> in the DMN are less sensitive to propofol, and could be significantly inhibited by a higher concentration of propofol, further reducing the level of alertness.

40|$|The aims of {{the present}} study were to {{identify}} the cerebral structures associated with encoding and retrieval of verbal material. To circumvent the inherent disadvantages of the conventional block designs used in functional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), an event-related design compared activation related to randomly intermixed old and new words during recognition. To support the validity of results, both nonparametric analyses in regions of interest (ROI) and statistical parametric mapping (SPM 96) were used. Twelve healthy volunteers, ages 22 - 35 years, performed three tasks: intentional encoding of words, recognition of old (previously learned) words, and discrimination between words and nonwords, a task to control for visual input and motor output during recognition. Echo-planar magnetic resonance imaging of blood-level, oxygen-dependent, task-related changes was used to compare cerebral activity under active and resting conditions as well as to detect event-related activity within blocks of trials. Comparable results were obtained following nonparametric statistical analysis of selected ROI and SPM. Encoding of words was associated with increased activity in the left inferior frontal gyrus, including Broca's area and in the left <b>parietal</b> association <b>cortex.</b> Event-related data analysis revealed activation of the right medial frontal gyrus, the right anterior cingulate gyrus, and parietal association cortices during recognition of previously presented words.

Also neurons in the lateral fissure, the parietal operculum, fire when rough surfaces are felt. However the localization of somatosensory association areas in humans is largely unknown and differences in functional contributions between somatosensory association areas has not been previously demonstrated. For these reasons the regional cerebral blood flow was measured with 15 O-butanol and positron-emission tomography in two groups of young volunteers discriminating the lengths, shapes, and roughness of objects with their right hand. Roughness discrimination activated the lateral <b>parietal</b> opercular <b>cortex</b> significantly more than did length or shape discrimination. A Boolean intersection of the cluster images showing the statistical significant increases of length and shape discrimination demonstrated that shape and length discrimination activated the same cortical field lining the anterior part of the intraparietal sulcus (IPA).

In series I, 69. 2 % of neurons were activated and 13. 5 % were inhibited before the movement. Prior changes in activity were also seen in intersignal movements, with {{activation of}} 40. 6 % and inhibition of 21. 7 % of neurons. The time parameters of excitatory and inhibitory responses in both situations were similar, with pre-movement i tervals of 19 - 1640 msec. In series 2, pre-movement i hibition was seen rather more frequently than activation (36. 7 % and 33. 7 % respectively). The earliest changes were inhibitory, occurring some 1800 msec before movements, while excitatory changes occurred only 880 msec before movement. These data indicate the involvement oftl~e parietal associative area in the cat not only in executing, but also in preparing for different ypes of movement, including self-initiated movements, and that inhibition has an active role in this process.

Human functional brain imaging studies suggest that visual working memory can recruit a network of brain regions from visual to <b>parietal</b> to prefrontal <b>cortex.</b> In this review, we focus on the maintenance of representations during visual working memory and discuss factors determining the topography of those representations.
