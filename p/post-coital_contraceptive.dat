5000|$|Estradiol {{phenylpropionate}} (EPP), {{also known}} as estradiol 17β-phenylpropionate, is a semisynthetic, steroidal estrogen. It is the phenylpropionate ester of estradiol. EPP is marketed in combination with estradiol benzoate under the brand name Dimenformon Prolongatum in the Netherlands and in combination with estradiol benzoate, testosterone propionate, testosterone phenylpropionate, and testosterone isocaproate under the brand name Mixogen (a balanced mixture of estradiol and testosterone esters).http://home.intekom.com/pharm/donmed/mixogen.html Both of these drug combinations are long-acting injectables indicated in hormone replacement therapy for women in menopause. Dimenformon Prolongatum has also been investigated as a single injection, [...] "morning after" [...] <b>post-coital</b> <b>contraceptive,</b> and is additionally used {{as a component of}} hormone replacement therapy for transgender women.|$|E
5000|$|With the new legislation, the law redefines {{the term}} ‘{{abortion}}’. An abortion {{is the legal}} termination of a pregnancy of 13 weeks of gestation or more. During the first 12 weeks of gestation, the procedure is labeled the ‘legal termination of pregnancy’. In addition, the term ‘pregnancy’ was officially defined as beginning when the embryo is implanted in the endometrium. This helps to determine gestational age and, according to the research team of Maria Sanchez Fuentes, [...] "implicitly legitimizes any <b>post-coital</b> <b>contraceptive</b> method, including emergency contraception... and assisted reproduction (including infertility treatments such as IVF) and stem-cell research." [...] Women charged with having an illegal abortion have their sentences reduced, and the penalty for forcing a woman {{to have an abortion}} against her own will, which includes her partner or a physician, is increased. If physical violence is involved, the penalty is even higher. Furthermore, the law explicitly states that sexual and reproductive health are a priority in health services, with the goal of preventing unwanted pregnancies and sexually transmitted infections (STIs).|$|E

40|$|Mifepristone (RU- 486), {{a potent}} {{progesterone}} receptor antagonist and inducer of cytochromes P- 450, {{is currently in}} use in Europe, particularly as a <b>post-coital</b> oral <b>contraceptive.</b> Soon it {{will be available in}} the United States, as well. Since progesterone has been implicated in the pathogenesis of acute attacks of porphyria, the use of RU- 486 or related compounds might be considered in porphyric patients. However, as with other cytochrome P- 450 inducers, RU- 486 may have the ability to precipitate or exacerbate attacks of acute porphyria. The acute porphyrias in relapse are associated with an increase in activity of delta-aminolevulinic acid synthase, the first and normally rate-controlling enzyme in heme biosynthesis. We have used primary cultures of chick embryo liver cells to test the ability of RU- 486 to induce delta-aminolevulinic acid synthase activity and mRNA, cytochromes P- 450, porphyrin accumulation, and heme oxygenase. We found that RU- 486, at concentrations observed in human plasma after a single oral dose, induced the mRNA and activity of delta-aminolevulinic acid synthase, both by itself and in the presence of deferoxamine, a potent iron chelator that inhibits ferrochelatase. RU- 486 and deferoxamine together also produced significant accumulations of protoporphyrin. These results indicate that RU- 486 may pose a risk in patients with known acute porphyria and should be used with caution. RU- 486 increased the concentration of total cytochrome P- 450, and the activity of erythromycin demethylase, an activity specifically catalyzed by cytochrome P- 450 3 A. Unlike several other porphyrogens (e. g. hydantoins, barbiturates), RU- 486 does not produce accumulation of uroporphyrin or induction of heme oxygenase in chick embryo liver cells...|$|R
40|$|Unintended {{pregnancy}} and subsequent abortion remain major public health issues in many countries, despite evidence that <b>post-coital</b> emergency <b>contraceptives</b> {{have a good}} safety profile, are easy to use, and are effective in preventing unwanted pregnancies. Although emergency contraceptives have been prescribed in developed countries for more than 25 years, abortion rates have continued to rise steadily in many jurisdictions. Barriers {{to the use of}} emergency contraceptives reduce ready access of women to this birth control option. Because the effectiveness of emergency contraceptives is time dependent, establishing prescribing and dispensing mechanisms that are convenient to women is crucial to their ability to use the therapy in a timely manner. Emergency contraceptives in developed countries are traditionally prescribed by physicians in organized healthcare settings. In these countries, pharmacists are ideally situated to improve patient access to emergency contraceptives, since community pharmacies are widely available in both urban and rural settings and are open extended hours. Innovative initiatives using a variety of regulatory mechanisms now allow pharmacists a greater role in prescribing and distributing emergency contraceptives. In Washington State, USA, pharmacists entering into a collaborative drug therapy agreement with a physician or nurse practitioner can initiate emergency contraceptives based on a prescribing protocol. Several local programs in the United Kingdom have utilized accredited community pharmacists to supply emergency contraceptives using a patient group directive. In British Columbia, Canada, specially-certified pharmacists with independent prescriptive authority utilize an informed consent during the interactive consultation with the potential emergency contraceptive user. In yet other jurisdictions, emergency contraceptives have been transferred to over-the-counter (OTC) status. Relevant public health research questions can now be posed. Future studies will be able to compare the effectiveness of various regulatory mechanisms to expand access, to identify and address potential drawbacks of pharmacist-initiated emergency contraceptives, and to explore whether pharmacist-initiated prescriptions represent expanded access or simply a transfer of the prescribing of these agents from physicians to pharmacists. Countries with OTC emergency contraceptives will be able to explore the relationship between varying levels of pharmacist interaction with emergency contraceptive users and health outcomes, and to investigate whether the change in prescriptive status has resulted in unintentional barriers to access for populations such as teenagers and those with restricted discretionary income. These findings will provide valuable new information on the impact of initiatives designed to expand access to emergency contraceptives.

40|$|The tubers of Pueraria tuberosa have folkloric repute as emmenagogue. The n-BuOH {{fraction}} of the ethanolic extract of tubers exhibits significant antifertility activity in laboratory animals. The present investigation explored the active principle(s) of the tuber extract with reference to contragestive effects in rats and probed the possible mechanism of action. Bioactivity-guided fractionation identified puerarin as the major constituent that exerted pregnancy-terminating effects. Oral administration of puerarin atR 300 mg/kg per day for days (D) 1 – 2 post-coitus resulted in complete implantation failure. Serum oestradiol levels during D 2 –D 5 and progesterone (P 4) level on D 5 remained unaffected, but the endometrial expression of oestrogen receptor a (ERa) and ERb was adversely modulated that disrupted the implantation-specific characteristic endometrial oestrogenic milieu. The eventual consequence was loss of endometrial receptivity characterised by down-regulation of the uterine expression of P 4 receptor (PR) and attenuation of endometrial expression of leukaemia inhibitory factor, vascular endothelial growth factor and cyclo-oxygenase- 2, the three important signalling molecules {{involved in the process}} of implantation. Light microscopic examination of the embryos demonstrated no untoward effect of puerarin on the development of embryos until D 4, but D 5 blastocysts underwent gross morphological distortion. The findings taken together are interpreted to suggest that puerarin adversely impacts the uterine expression of ER and PR that disrupts the implantation-conducive uterine milieu and prevents implantation. In conclusion, puerarin may be envisaged as a prospective molecule that merits further exploration for the development of non-steroidal <b>post-coital</b> <b>contraceptive</b> for women...|$|E
40|$|Emergency {{contraceptive}} pills Emergency {{oral contraceptive}} pills are a <b>post-coital</b> <b>contraceptive</b> option, allowing women to prevent pregnancy after intercourse has occurred. Low contraceptive-prevalence rates along {{with high levels}} of unmet need for family planning in many developing countries indicate a high frequency of unprotected sexual relationships. As a result, many couples are at risk for an unplanned and/or unwanted pregnancy. Emergency contraception (EC) is effective in preventing a substantial proportion of pregnancies when it is used promptly after unprotected intercourse. It is an especially important option in cases of sexual coercion or rape. The most commonly available regimen is 1. 5 mg levonorgestrel in a single dose, packaged either as a single pill or as two pills of 0. 75 mg each. Although the two-pill products usually include instructions to take one pill up to 72 hours after unprotected intercourse and the second one 12 hours later, they can both be taken together without increasing side effects; this minimizes the chance of the second dose being missed. 1 This product is on WHO’s Model List of Essential Medicines 2 and is included in many countries ’ national medicines lists or formularies. More recently, a regimen containing 30 mg of the compound ulipristal acetate has been made available and can also be taken up to 120 hours after unprotected intercourse. 3 As of January 2012, this regimen is not available in developing countries. Emergency contraceptive pills (ECPs) work mainly by either preventing or delaying ovulation; this is likely the only mechanism of action, although there is some evidence showing that they may prevent the sperm and egg from meeting by altering the cervical mucus. 4 ECPs are more effective the sooner they are taken. Regular oral contraceptives taken in specific doses also can serve as EC. For a list of regular oral contraceptives {{that can be used for}} EC purposes, visit...|$|E
40|$|Background: The {{national}} health system in Somalia has been seriously undermined by {{almost two decades}} of civil war and conflict. Somalia's high total fertility rate, high maternal mortality ratio, and low contraceptive prevalence rate coupled with restrictive abortion laws make addressing the lack of family planning services an important priority. In crisis and conflict or post-conflict settings such as Somalia, emergency contraception can be important for pregnancy prevention, yet Somalia {{remains one of the}} few countries in the world without a registered progestin-only emergency contraceptive pill. In 2014, we conducted fieldwork in Somalia to explore awareness of and attitudes to emergency contraception. Methods: We conducted a qualitative, multi-methods study comprised of ten formal, semi-structured interviews with key informants (ie, physicians, non-governmental officials, and government officials) in Mogadishu, structured, in-person interviews with 20 Somali pharmacists in a range of neighbourhoods, and four focus group discussions with 21 married and unmarried Somali women. Most key informants and pharmacists were purposively sampled, with additional participants recruited through snowball sampling. Focus group participants were recruited through our study's partner non-governmental organisations in Mogadishu. Findings from this study will be disseminated to stakeholders {{in the form of a}} summarised report and will inform future projects and policies about the potential expansion of emergency contraception in Somalia. Findings: Responses from most participants showed little knowledge of existing family planning methods or emergency contraception. However, once emergency contraception was described, all participants expressed tremendous enthusiasm for expanding access to <b>post-coital</b> <b>contraceptive</b> methods in Somalia. They believed that the provision of emergency contraception would fill a major gap in reproductive health service delivery. All stakeholders involved in the study identified ways that emergency contraception could be incorporated into the health system. Interpretation: Although importation and use of pharmaceuticals in Somalia is severely unregulated, and measures for formal registration of medications in Somalia do not exist, results from our study highlight mechanisms that could be explored to expand access to emergency contraception in Somalia. This study sheds much needed light on why Somalia continues to be a global exception with respect to a dedicated product and suggests that there are possible avenues for overcoming existing barriers.
