By having similar heights, flowering and maturity dates, seed colors, and agronomic characteristics, they remain compatible with each other, and do not reduce yields when grown together on the field.|$|E

One major French film critic, François Chalais of Le Figaro, disliked the film, but Truffaut received high praise elsewhere. Pascal Bonitzer viewed the film as [...] "most profound, and without much exaggeration, {{one of the most beautiful}} French films of recent years," [...] and that [...] "it is not for nothing that Truffaut embodies his character, and that in the latter, Julien Davenne, the author and the actor are entwined in the tightest possible way...rarely does a filmmaker involve himself to that point - involving his body (and note all the ambiguity of the word in the context of this funeral film) and even his dead; mixing together Julien Davenne's dead with those of François Truffaut in the flaming chapel where the film comes to an end." [...] Joel Magny called Julien Davenne the ultimate [...] "truffaldian" [...] hero, [...] "unable to live the present moment in the fullness of his being, where he is...in a perpetual time-lag with reality." [...] The French magazine Télérama called Davenne [...] "l'homme qui aimait les flammes" [...] ("the man who loves the flames").

40|$|The {{main goal}} {{of this study was}} to improve <b>pure</b> <b>lines</b> for low input {{agricultural}} areas of the semi-arid region of Iran and similar environmental conditions. Forty barley <b>pure</b> <b>lines</b> provided from ICARDA along with three check cultivars were evaluated under rain-fed conditions in a semi-arid region of Iran during two years (2011 - 2013). The experiments were conducted in a randomized complete block design with four replications to estimate genetic variation and heritability for agro-morphological traits. The highest values of phenotypic and genotypic coefficients of variation were observed for the number of grains per spike followed by peduncle length, early vigor and grain yield. The broad heritability estimates ranged from 24 % for grain yield to 96 % for the number of grains per spike. The highest and lowest expected genetic advance, observed for days to physiological maturity and the number of grains per spike, respectively. Results of stepwise regression and path analysis showed that hectoliter grain weight and thousand grain weight exhibited the highest direct effects on grain yield, respectively. Comparisons between the <b>pure</b> <b>lines</b> and check cultivars indicated that out of 40 <b>pure</b> <b>lines,</b> 27 lines had a higher grain yield. Also, the <b>pure</b> <b>lines</b> No. 29, 13, 9 and 33 were identified as the superior lines for semi-arid environmental conditions. Our results indicate that check cultivars could be improved by selecting for <b>pure</b> <b>lines</b> with taller peduncle and the number of grains per spike, but with heavier grains. Therefore, these lines can be used as genetic material to broaden the genetic basis of barley breeding programs all over the world...|$|R

In this study, using a 60 K single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) panel, we estimated LD and haplotype structure in crossbred broiler chickens and their component <b>pure</b> <b>lines</b> (one male and two female lines) and calculated the consistency of LD between these populations. ResultsThe average level of LD (measured by r 2) between adjacent SNPs across the chicken autosomes studied here ranged from 0. 34 to 0. 40 in the <b>pure</b> <b>lines</b> but was only 0. 24 in the crossbred populations, with 28. 4 % of adjacent SNP pairs having an r 2 higher than 0. 3.

40|$|Background Genomic {{selection}} and genomic wide association studies {{are widely used}} methods that aim to exploit the linkage disequilibrium (LD) between markers and quantitative trait loci (QTL). Securing a sufficiently large set of genotypes and phenotypes can be a limiting factor that may be overcome by combining data from multiple breeds or using crossbred information. However, the estimated effect of a marker in one breed or a crossbred can only be useful for the selection of animals in another breed {{if there is a}} correspondence of the phase between the marker and the QTL across breeds. Using data of five pure pig (Sus scrofa) lines (SL 1, SL 2, SL 3, DL 1, DL 2), one F 1 cross (DLF 1) and two commercial finishing crosses (TER 1 and TER 2), the objectives of this study were: (i) to compare the equality of LD decay curves of different pig populations; and (ii) to evaluate the persistence of the LD phase across lines or final crosses. Results Almost all of the lines presented different extents of LD, except for the SL 2 and DL 3, both of which exhibited the same extent of LD. Similar levels of LD over large distances were found in crossbred and <b>pure</b> <b>lines.</b> The crossbred animals (DLF 1, TER 1 and TER 2) presented a high persistence of phase with their parental lines, suggesting that the available porcine single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) chip should be dense enough to include markers that have the same LD phase with QTL across crossbred and parental <b>pure</b> <b>lines.</b> The persistence of phase across <b>pure</b> <b>lines</b> varied considerably between the different line comparisons; however, correlations were above 0. 8 for all line comparisons when marker distances were smaller than 50 kb. Conclusions This study showed that crossbred populations could be very useful as a reference for the selection of <b>pure</b> <b>lines</b> by means of the available SNP chip panel. Here, we also pinpoint <b>pure</b> <b>lines</b> that could be combined in a multiline training population.

40|$|Background: Breeding {{goals in}} a {{crossbreeding}} system should be defined at the commercial crossbred level. However, selection is often performed to improve purebred performance. A genomic selection (GS) model that includes dominance effects {{can be used to}} select purebreds for crossbred performance. Optimization of the GS model {{raises the question of whether}} marker effects should be estimated from data on the <b>pure</b> <b>lines</b> or crossbreds. Therefore, the first objective of this study was to compare response to selection of crossbreds by simulating a two-way crossbreeding program with either a purebred or a crossbred training population. We assumed a trait of interest that was controlled by loci with additive and dominance effects. Animals were selected on estimated breeding values for crossbred performance. There was no genotype by environment interaction. Linkage phase and strength of linkage disequilibrium between quantitative trait loci (QTL) and single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) can differ between breeds, which causes apparent effects of SNPs to be line-dependent. Thus, our second objective was to compare response to GS based on crossbred phenotypes when the line origin of alleles was taken into account or not in the estimation of breeding values. Results: Training on crossbred animals yielded a larger response to selection in crossbred offspring compared to training on both <b>pure</b> <b>lines</b> separately or on both <b>pure</b> <b>lines</b> combined into a single reference population. Response to selection in crossbreds was larger if both phenotypes and genotypes were collected on crossbreds than if phenotypes were only recorded on crossbreds and genotypes on their parents. If both parental lines were distantly related, tracing the line origin of alleles improved genomic prediction, whereas if both parental lines were closely related and the reference population was small, it was better to ignore the line origin of alleles. Conclusions: Response to selection in crossbreeding programs can be increased by training on crossbred genotypes and phenotypes. Moreover, if the reference population is sufficiently large and both <b>pure</b> <b>lines</b> are not very closely related, tracing the line origin of alleles in crossbreds improves genomic prediction...|$|R
