The square now covers from the corner of Palazzo Ferreria to the first column across of the subjected parliament, and to the Spanish steps next to the City Gate.|$|E
5|$|For comparison, its {{population}} was only 20,000 in 1969 and 150,000 in 1980. Part {{of the difficulty}} in estimating the city's population is that <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> nomadic, setting up tents in suitable locations, then packing up when the need strikes. Some estimates put the 2008 population at over 2 million, estimated {{to be close to}} one-third of the country's population. The 2013 census gave the city's population as 958,399.|$|E
5|$|Pioneers {{traveling}} in wagon trains on the Oregon Trail in the 1850s and 1860s followed an alternative route {{in the area}} that used old Indian trails that skirted the lava flows. This alternative route was later named Goodale's Cutoff and <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> {{in the northern part of}} the monument. The cutoff was created to reduce the possibility of ambush by Shoshone warriors along the Snake River such as the one that occurred at Massacre Rocks, which today is memorialized in Idaho's Massacre Rocks State Park.|$|E

5|$|The castle is now {{situated}} in a small urban park called Caludon Castle Park, owned and managed by Coventry City Council. The moat is now dry, and at least <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> filled in, but parts are still visible, along with other earthworks. The remaining wall is a Scheduled Ancient Monument, as is the moated site to the south. Since 1955, the wall has also had Grade I listed building status.|$|E
5|$|The {{cerebellum}} of cartilaginous and {{bony fishes}} is extraordinarily large and complex. In {{at least one}} important respect, it differs in internal structure from the mammalian cerebellum: The fish cerebellum does not contain discrete deep cerebellar nuclei. Instead, the primary targets of Purkinje cells are a distinct type of cell distributed across the cerebellar cortex, a type not seen in mammals. In mormyrid fish (a family of weakly electrosensitive freshwater fish), the cerebellum is considerably larger {{than the rest of}} the brain put together. The largest <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> a special structure called the valvula, which has an unusually regular architecture and receives much of its input from the electrosensory system.|$|E
5|$|The {{station was}} little used and trains often passed through it without stopping. Its lack of {{patronage}} coupled with {{its proximity to}} other stations resulted in its closure in 1932. During the Second World War it {{was used as a}} bunker by prime minister Winston Churchill and his War Cabinet. The station building survives today and is close to Down Street's junction with Piccadilly. <b>Part</b> <b>of</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> now converted to a retail outlet.|$|E

5|$|The {{watershed}} of Little Fishing Creek {{is considerably}} {{longer than it}} is wide. The drainage basin area of the creek upstream of the stream gauge at Eyers Grove is 56.5 square miles. Most of the watershed is in Columbia County. However, {{a substantial part of}} the northwestern portion of the watershed is in Lycoming County and the northernmost <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> in Sullivan County. The watershed is part of the Lower North Branch Susquehanna River drainage basin.|$|E
5|$|The {{watershed}} of Mud Creek has {{an area of}} 17.70 square miles. It {{is mainly}} in Madison Township, Columbia County and Derry Township, Montour County, but a small <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> in West Hemlock Township, Montour County. The watershed of the creek is in the Washingtonville and Millville United States Geological Survey 7.5 minute quadrangles. It is on {{the eastern edge of}} the West Branch Susquehanna River watershed. The creek's major tributaries include several unnamed tributaries.|$|E
5|$|Iridescence, as {{explained}} by Thomas Young in 1803, is created when extremely thin films reflect {{part of the}} light falling on them from their top surfaces. The rest of the light goes through the films, and a further <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> reflected from their bottom surfaces. The two sets of reflected waves travel back upwards in the same direction. But since the bottom-reflected waves travelled a little further – controlled by the thickness and refractive index of the film, and the angle at which the light fell – {{the two sets of}} waves are out of phase. When the waves are one or more whole wavelength apart – in other words at certain specific angles, they add (interfere constructively), giving a strong reflection. At other angles and phase differences, they can subtract, giving weak reflections. The thin film therefore selectively reflects just one wavelength – a pure colour – at any given angle, but other wavelengths – different colours – at different angles. So, as a thin-film structure like a butterfly's wing or bird's feather moves, it seems to change colour.|$|E

5|$|The earth may be personified as {{the goddess}} Bhudevi in Indian sculpture. Bhudevi is often shown {{as a small}} figure in the icon. She may be seated on or {{dangling}} from one of Varaha's tusks, or is seated {{on the corner of}} his folded elbow or his shoulder and supports herself against the tusk or the snout, as being lifted from the waters. In later Indian paintings, the whole earth or a <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> depicted lifted up by Varaha's tusks. In Mahabalipuram, a rare portrayal shows an affectionate Varaha looking down to Bhudevi, who he carries in his arms. The earth may be portrayed as a globe, a flat stretch of mountainous land or an elaborate forest landscape with buildings, temples, humans, birds and animals. The defeated demon may be depicted trampled under Varaha's feet or being killed in combat by Varaha's gada. Nagas (snake gods) and their consorts Naginis (snake goddesses), residents of the underworld, may be depicted as swimming in the ocean with hands folded as a mark of devotion. Varaha may be also depicted standing on a snake or other minor creatures, denoting the cosmic waters.|$|E
5|$|The {{entry to}} the vestry {{is located at the}} end of the right side aisle next to the choir; {{at the end of the}} left side aisle is the Chapel for Mercy of God. The {{tabernacle}} is situated on the chapel's altar. The church's main altar is faced with a dark green marble, and houses relics of Saints Andrew, Zenon of Verona, Gregory of Nyssa, Gregory of Nazianzus, Cosmas, Damian and Anastasia, as well as the Virgin Mary's scarf and a donation from the Diocese of Verona. The ambo—a projection coming out from the soleas—is on the right side of the altar, and is faced with the same marble. Behind the altar, on the wall of the apse, there is a nine-metre high stone crucifix with a three-metre high figure of Christ. Plaster figures depicting the Virgin Mary and John the Baptist by architect Svyatoslav Sakhlebin are located on the left and the right sides (respectively) of the corbels. On the opposite side of the altar and above the cathedral's vestibule is the organ loft, which had originally room for 50choristers; a large <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> now occupied by the organ.|$|E

Ra'aya Meiheimna is found in Vols. 2 and 3 of the Zohar, but is not found explicitly in Vol. 1. Several great rabbis and sages have tried to find the Ra'aya Meheimna, which originally is a vast book on all the 613 mitzvot, and arrange it according to the order of positive commandments and negative commandments, and even print it as a book on its own.|$|E

25|$|While German {{universities}} {{have a strong}} focus on research, a large <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> also done outside of universities in independent institutes that are embedded in academic clusters, such as within the Max Planck, Fraunhofer, Leibniz and Helmholtz institutes. This German peculiarity of “outsourcing” research leads to a competition for funds between universities and research institutes and may negatively affect academic rankings.|$|E
25|$|Diamond Head is a {{defining}} {{feature of the}} view known to residents and tourists of Waikīkī, and also a U.S. National Natural Monument. The volcanic tuff cone is a State Monument.
