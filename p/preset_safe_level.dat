40|$|Subject matter experts {{systematically}} reviewed {{evidence on}} the effectiveness of housing interventions that affect safety and injury outcomes, such as falls, fire-related injuries, burns, drowning, carbon monoxide poisoning, heat-related deaths, and noise-related harm, associated with structural housing deficiencies. Structural deficiencies were defined as those deficiencies for which a builder, landlord, or homeowner would take responsibility (ie, design, construction, installation, repair, monitoring). Three of the 17 interventions reviewed had sufficient evidence for implementation: installed, working smoke alarms; 4 -sided isolation pool fencing; and <b>preset</b> <b>safe</b> hot water temperature. Five interventions needed more field evaluation, 8 needed formative research, and 1 was found to be ineffective. This evidence review shows that housing improvements are likely to help reduce burns and scalds, drowning in pools, and fire-related deaths and injuries. ...|$|R

30|$|According to the {{standards}} set by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to reduce pathogen up to a <b>safe</b> <b>level</b> for use, the compost pile should {{be exposed to the}} temperatures of 55 – 70  °C for 72  h. So the question is arisen that at the temperatures lower than the standard temperature, like vermicomposting, does the pathogen reduce to a <b>safe</b> <b>level?</b> (Edwards et al. 2010). Several reports have shown the reduction of pathogen to a <b>safe</b> <b>level</b> in the vermicomposting process under specific processing conditions. The first reduction of pathogens was reported by USEPA (1999) where pathogens are reduced by passing biological solid waste through the worm intestine.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. The class {{imbalanced}} problem {{occurs in}} various disciplines {{when one of}} target classes has a tiny number of instances comparing to other classes. A typical classifier normally ignores or neglects to detect a minority class due to {{the small number of}} class instances. SMOTE is one of over-sampling techniques that remedies this situation. It generates minority instances within the overlapping regions. However, SMOTE randomly synthesizes the minority instances along a line joining a minority instance and its selected nearest neighbours, ignoring nearby majority instances. Our technique called Safe-Level-SMOTE carefully samples minority instances along the same line with different weight degree, called <b>safe</b> <b>level.</b> The <b>safe</b> <b>level</b> computes by using nearest neighbour minority instances. By synthesizing the minority instances more around larger <b>safe</b> <b>level,</b> we achieve a better accuracy performance than SMOTE and Borderline-SMOTE...|$|R
