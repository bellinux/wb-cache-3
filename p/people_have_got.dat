He said, [...] "We {{will not}} allow people to separate us from the United States of America {{in dealing with the}} common challenges that we face around the world.

500|$|Hanneman {{said that}} the album was his {{personal}} favorite, reasoning it was [...] "so short and quick and to the point". Araya has remarked that Slayer's 2006 album Christ Illusion [...] "comes close", but that [...] "nothing can surpass Reign in Blood for intensity and impact. No one had heard anything like it before. In the twenty years since then, <b>people</b> <b>have</b> <b>got</b> more desensitized. What was over the top then might not be now." [...] Drummer Paul Bostaph who was a Slayer member from 1992 to 2001 (and 2013–present) first heard the record {{when he was a}} member of Forbidden. During a party Bostaph walked towards music he heard from another room, and approached Forbidden guitarist Craig Locicero. When asked what music was playing, Locicero shouted [...] "the new Slayer record". After listening closely to the record, he looked at Locicero, and concluded that his band was [...] "fucked".|$|E

500|$|Thatcher defined her own {{political}} philosophy {{in a major}} and controversial break with the one-nation conservatism of Edward Heath and her Conservative predecessors in an interview published in Woman's Own magazine, three months after her victory in the 1987 general election:I think we have gone through a period when too many children and people {{have been given to}} understand [...] "I have a problem, it is the Government's job to cope with it!" [...] or [...] "I have a problem, I will go and get a grant to cope with it!" [...] "I am homeless, the Government must house me!" [...] and so they are casting their problems on society and who is society? There is no such thing! There are individual men and women and there are families and no government can do anything except through people and people look to themselves first.

On January 26, 2008, CNET News reported that Karin Pouw, public affairs director for the Church of Scientology, did not address their specific request for a comment about the denial-of-service attacks but instead only responded to the appearance of the Tom Cruise video on YouTube. Pouw stated that the video consisted of [...] "pirated and edited" [...] excerpts of Cruise from a 2004 Scientology event, and that after the video appeared, there was increased traffic to Scientology sites as shown by top lists compiled by search engines. Pouw went on to state [...] "Those wishing to find out the Church of Scientology's views and to gain context of the video have the right to search official Church Web sites if they so desire." ...|$|E

Stopping at the Contemporary, which was hosting the 1973 Annual Convention of the Associated Press Managing Editors Association, the president held a live one-hour televised press conference in the Ballroom of the Americas. Following an earlier question by Joe Ungaro on Nixon's taxes, Nixon decided to address claims that he profited from his public service, stating [...] "I have earned every cent.
