40|$|This study {{investigated}} the capability of three rapid microbiological methods to detect microorganisms in aseptically prepared pharmacy preparations at National Health Service hospitals in the United Kingdom. BacT/ALERT 3 D (bioMerieux), AKuScreen (Celsis), and BactiFlow ALS (AES Chemunex) technologies were used to detect levels of microorganisms in pharmaceutical products. Four products selected to represent the range of pharmaceuticals prepared in National Health Service hospital pharmacy departments were spiked with known levels of microorganisms. The presence of microorganisms in these products was then determined using each of the rapid microbiological methods and compared to the number determined by traditional {{total aerobic microbial count}} methodology. An evaluation of the performance parameters associated with each of the methods, including cost analysis, was also undertaken. There was good correlation between rapid microbiological methods and total aerobic microbial count for heparin and <b>parenteral</b> <b>nutrition</b> <b>products.</b> The rapid microbiological methods had difficulty recovering Gram-positive organisms from vancomycin and methotrexate products; however, protocol developments demonstrated that this was surmountable. The main differences between the rapid microbiological method systems were time-to-result, the initial equipment cost, and the skill required to operate the instruments. The main finding from this work is that rapid microbiological methods can detect microbial contamination of hospital pharmaceutical products in a reduced time when compared to traditional microbiological techniques. The instrument comparison showed that Celsis AKuScreen provided the most rapid result for detecting bacteria; BacT/ALERT was the least expensive instrument and the simplest system to use; and BactiFlow ALS was the most expensive and more complex to use and gave intermediate time to results...|$|E
40|$|With {{a growing}} body of {{research}} suggesting the importance of nutrition in critical illness, there is a need for ways to know just how much nutrition to give. For the majority whose ICU stay is short, this might not be of great concern, but it is of crucial importance for longer-stay critically ill patients for whom unnecessary catabolism could be detrimental but who are also at high risk of complications from overfeeding. Guidelines for the provision of energy and protein are not based on a high level of evidence; available measures of energy and protein consumption have significant limitations, and there are no established ways to assess when an individual patient is receiving optimal nutrition during critical illness. Of the variety of available techniques in use for assessing and monitoring nutritional status, most are not easily applicable in the intensive care unit (ICU) setting due to the bodily changes that occur in critical illness or due to the limitations of the ICU setting itself, and many have not been adequately validated for their purpose. Tools for nutritional assessment are usually validated against a gold standard measure of nutritional status, and it is a relatively straightforward process to evaluate the sensitivity and specificity of such a tool against the gold standard tool. In contrast, it is less straightforward to validate a tool for nutritional monitoring. To be meaningful, the validation process would need to assess the tool against patients’ outcomes in a longitudinal study, ideally one that is randomised and controlled to eliminate possible confounders. Such outcomes should be clinically meaningful and patient-focused, that is, measures of how the patient feels, functions or survives. There would be little value in a tool that indicates a significant nutritional improvement without resulting in any better outcomes for the patient. The aim of this thesis is to investigate dietitians’ practices in nutritional management of ICU patients, to evaluate current approaches to nutritional monitoring in critical illness, and to identify methods that could be used to monitor nutritional progress during critical illness, with a view to developing a valid tool for this purpose. Protein was chosen as the focus for this monitoring as it has not been well studied, so this thesis also aims to explore current practices in provision of protein to ICU patients and compare these to the existing evidence on protein requirements in the critically ill and ways of measuring the effects of protein intake. In order to establish current nutritional management practices amongst ICU dietitians, an 18 - question survey tool was developed. The survey included validated measures of dietitian involvement in the ICU team, as this parameter was identified a priori as a potential confounder of the survey responses. The survey was then administered by telephone to at least one dietitian from each of the 182 ICUs in Australia and New Zealand. The findings of this project indicate that none of the interviewed dietitians are using methods of monitoring nutritional support that have been validated against patient outcome. Overall 15 indicators were identified that Australasian dietitians report using to assess and monitor nutrition in their critically ill patients. The results of the survey also indicated that there is a wide variation in nutritional practices in ICU; one example in particular is the wide range of target protein intakes for ICU patients which in current practice ranges threefold from 0. 75 g/kg (the RDI for healthy Australians and New Zealanders) to more than 2 g/kg body weight. To identify additional methods of monitoring nutritional progress in ICU, a literature search was undertaken, focusing on journal articles that reported nutrition-related studies in a critically ill population. There were 1027 studies found, that mentioned 53 different nutritionrelated parameters, and these included the 15 that dietitians had reported using. All of these nutritional indicators were then assessed for their potential application in a critically ill population, considering both feasibility and availability. The validity of these indicators was then investigated using a systematic review methodology asking the question ‘What nutritional parameters predict clinically significant outcomes in randomised studies conducted in a critically ill population?’ As there are no randomised controlled trials specifically designed to validate the use of any of the common nutritional parameters, the review identified trials of any nutrition-related intervention and then looked at whether these trials also recorded any nutritional monitoring parameters that might be expected to respond to improved nutrition, and whether these parameters were associated with improvements in clinically meaningful outcomes such as mortality, length of hospital or ICU stay, or incidence of infectious complications. Twenty-nine studies were found that did not report any significant difference in outcomes. Twenty studies showed a significant improvement in outcome as well as reporting nutritional monitoring parameters like serum albumin, prealbumin (transthyretin), retinol-binding protein, transferrin and lymphocytes. Of these, the number of studies supporting a statistical relationship between outcome and particular nutritional indicators was equal to, or outnumbered by, the studies not supporting such a relationship. The results of this systematic review indicated that none of the frequently-used parameters consistently predicts clinically significant outcomes in the critically ill. The survey of dietitians had revealed a wide range of target protein intakes used for ICU patients, ranging from the NHMRC’s RDI to more than 2 g/kg body weight. Standard <b>parenteral</b> <b>nutrition</b> <b>products</b> generally provide only the NHMRC amount of amino acids when guideline energy intakes are achieved, and only specialised solutions meet guideline goals for both energy and protein. To establish current practice at the candidate’s hospital, an audit looked at the last 300 patients who received parenteral nutrition. Due to institutionspecific factors, all 300 patients received the same standard three-in-one parenteral nutrition admixture (providing about an RDI level of 0. 8 g/kg protein), for median 8 days (interquartile range 6 - 14 days). The incidence of complications such as line sepsis and metabolic abnormalities was low. The standard solution did not meet the protein requirements of surgical or critically ill patients with a mean deficit of 12 g protein per day. Twenty-seven patients died while receiving parenteral nutrition. Mortality was significantly higher in ICU patients (odds ratio 5. 84; 95...|$|E

40|$|Background. Intestinal {{failure is}} {{associated}} frequently with liver injury, which persists after weaning off <b>parenteral</b> <b>nutrition.</b> We compared features of liver remodeling in intestinal failure {{during and after}} weaning off <b>parenteral</b> <b>nutrition.</b> Methods. Liver biopsies and serum samples were obtained from 25 intestinal failure patients at a median age of 9. 7 years (interquartile range: 4. 6 - 18) and from age-matched control patients. Seven patients had been receiving <b>parenteral</b> <b>nutrition</b> for 53 months (22 - 160), and 18 patients had been weaned off <b>parenteral</b> <b>nutrition</b> 6. 3 years (2. 4 - 17) earlier, after having received <b>parenteral</b> <b>nutrition</b> for 10 months (3. 3 - 34). Expression of alpha smooth muscle actin, collagen 1, proinflammatory cytokines, growth factors, and matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) was measured. Results. Significant increases in immunohistochemical expression of alpha-smooth muscle actin and collagen 1 were observed predominantly in portal areas and were similar to increases seen in patients currently receiving <b>parenteral</b> <b>nutrition</b> and in patients weaned off <b>parenteral</b> <b>nutrition.</b> Gene and protein expressions of alpha-smooth muscle actin and collagen were interrelated. Gene expression of ACTA 2, encoding alpha-smooth muscle actin, was increased only in patients who were receiving <b>parenteral</b> <b>nutrition</b> currently. Comparable upregulation of interleukin- 1 (alpha and beta), epidermal growth factor, integrin-beta 6, and MMP 9 gene expression was observed in both patient groups, irrespective of whether they were receiving <b>parenteral</b> <b>nutrition</b> currently. Liver expression and serum levels of TIMP 1 and MMP 7 were increased only in the patients on <b>parenteral</b> <b>nutrition</b> currently but were not increased after weaning off <b>parenteral</b> <b>nutrition.</b> Conclusion.

40|$|<b>Parenteral</b> <b>nutrition</b> is a {{life-saving}} {{therapy for}} patients with intestinal failure. It {{may be associated with}} transient elevations of liver enzyme concentrations, which return to normal after <b>parenteral</b> <b>nutrition</b> is discontinued.

40|$|Objective. Total <b>parenteral</b> <b>nutrition</b> is {{commonly}} used in neonates’ intensive care units for nutritional support of preterm neonates. Adequacy and safety of <b>parenteral</b> <b>nutrition</b> support are amongst the major concerns of neonates’ therapy. <b>Parenteral</b> <b>nutrition</b> prescription in Greek hospitals {{is not based on}} standardized protocols, thus resulting in wide diversity of formulations. In this study, the results of utilization of standardized computerized <b>parenteral</b> <b>nutrition</b> protocols and regimens for neonates are compared to the results of protocols and regimens prescribed by individual neonatologists on neonates’ outcome (weight changes, adequacy of <b>parenteral</b> <b>nutrition,</b> days of hospitalization, clinical outcome). SettingThe study took place at “Mitera” Maternity Hospital of Greece. Method. Two groups of 30 preterm infants (28 – 36 weeks) with respiratory failure were recruited for the study. They were admitted in a Greek maternity hospital and they all received total <b>parenteral</b> <b>nutrition</b> support in neonates’ intensive care unit. Standardized, computer based protocols were applied for the prescription of <b>parenteral</b> <b>nutrition</b> formulations in the first group, while on the other, regimens prescribed by neonatologists were used. Main outcome measures: Macro- and micronutrients provided by the different total <b>parenteral</b> <b>nutrition</b> protocols were recorded. Body weight was measured, blood count and biochemical profile were performed at the beginning {{and at the end of}} <b>parenteral</b> <b>nutrition</b> support. The number of days of total <b>parenteral</b> <b>nutrition</b> support as well as the total number of days of hospitalization was recorded. Results. Standardized protocols provided more energy (P-value: 0. 05), protein (P-value: 0. 023) and micronutrients than the non-standardised. Neonates that receive standardized total <b>parenteral</b> <b>nutrition</b> gained weight (+ 44 ± 114 g) and had better blood count and biochemical values during total <b>parenteral</b> <b>nutrition</b> support compared to the other group, that lost weight during total <b>parenteral</b> <b>nutrition</b> support (− 53 ± 156 g).

40|$|Total <b>parenteral</b> <b>nutrition</b> was {{developed}} in the 1960 s and has since been implemented commonly {{in the intensive care unit}} (ICU). Studies published in the 1980 s and early 1990 s indicate that the use of total <b>parenteral</b> <b>nutrition</b> is associated with increased mortality and infectious morbidity. These detrimental effects were related to hyperglycemia and overnutrition at a period when <b>parenteral</b> <b>nutrition</b> was not administered according to the all-in-one principle.

This fact and various published outbreaks due to contaminated <b>parenteral</b> <b>nutrition</b> preparations highlight the importance of appropriate standards in the preparation and handling of intravenous solutions and <b>parenteral</b> <b>nutrition.</b> Ready-to-use <b>parenteral</b> <b>nutrition</b> formulations may provide additional safety in this context. However, there is concern that such formulations may result in overfeeding and necrotizing enterocolitis. Given the risk for catheter-associated infection, handling with <b>parenteral</b> <b>nutrition</b> should be minimized and the duration shortened. Further research is required about this topic...|$|R
40|$|<b>Parenteral</b> <b>nutrition</b> {{offers the}} {{possibility}} of increasing or ensuring nutrient intake in patients in whom normal food intake is inadequate and enteral nutrition is not feasible, is contraindicated or is not accepted by the patient. These guidelines are intended to provide evidence-based recommendations {{for the use of}} <b>parenteral</b> <b>nutrition</b> in cancer patients. They were developed by an interdisciplinary expert group in accordance with accepted standards, are based on the most relevant publications of the last 30 years and share many of the conclusions of the ESPEN guidelines on enteral nutrition in oncology. Under-nutrition and cachexia occur frequently in cancer patients and are indicators of poor prognosis and, per se, responsible for excess morbidity and mortality. Many indications for <b>parenteral</b> <b>nutrition</b> parallel those for enteral nutrition (weight loss or reduction in food intake for more than 7 - 10 days), but only those who, for whatever reason cannot be fed orally or enterally, are candidates to receive <b>parenteral</b> <b>nutrition.</b> A standard nutritional regimen may be recommended for short-term <b>parenteral</b> <b>nutrition,</b> while in cachectic patients receiving intravenous feeding for several weeks a high fat-to-glucose ratio may be advised because these patients maintain a high capacity to metabolize fats. The limited nutritional response to the <b>parenteral</b> <b>nutrition</b> reflects more the presence of metabolic derangements which are characteristic of the cachexia syndrome (or merely the short duration of the nutritional support) rather than the inadequacy of the nutritional regimen. Perioperative <b>parenteral</b> <b>nutrition</b> is only recommended in malnourished patients if enteral nutrition is not feasible. In non-surgical well-nourished oncologic patients routine <b>parenteral</b> <b>nutrition</b> is not recommended because it has proved to offer no advantage and is associated with increased morbidity. A benefit, however, is reported in patients undergoing hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. Short-term <b>parenteral</b> <b>nutrition</b> is however commonly accepted in patients with acute gastrointestinal complications from chemotherapy and radiotherapy, and long-term (home) <b>parenteral</b> <b>nutrition</b> will sometimes be a life-saving maneuver in patients with sub acute/chronic radiation enteropathy. In incurable cancer patients home <b>parenteral</b> <b>nutrition</b> may be recommended in hypophagic/(sub) obstructed patients (if there is an acceptable performance status) if they are expected to die from starvation/under nutrition prior to tumor spread.

40|$|HYPOTHESIS: Immediate {{enteral feeding}} {{following}} major abdominal surgery reduces postoperative complications and mortality {{when compared with}} <b>parenteral</b> <b>nutrition.</b> DESIGN: A prospective multicenter randomized trial. SETTING: A university hospital department of digestive surgery. PATIENTS AND INTERVENTIONS: Two hundred forty-one malnourished patients undergoing major elective abdominal surgery {{were randomly assigned to}} receive, after surgery, either enteral (enteral nutrition group: 119 patients) or <b>parenteral</b> <b>nutrition</b> (total <b>parenteral</b> <b>nutrition</b> group: 122 patients). The patients were monitored for postoperative complications and mortality. RESULTS: The rate of major postoperative complications was similar in the enteral and <b>parenteral</b> groups (enteral <b>nutrition</b> group: 37. 8 %; total <b>parenteral</b> <b>nutrition</b> group: 39. 3 %; P was not significant), as were the overall postoperative mortality rates (5. 9 % and 2. 5 %, respectively; P was not significant).

To study endothelial function and common carotid artery mechanical properties in children receiving <b>parenteral</b> <b>nutrition,</b> we used noninvasive ultrasonic measurements in 18 children on <b>parenteral</b> <b>nutrition</b> and 18 controls. No difference {{appeared in the}} geometry of the common carotid artery (intima media thickness, systolic and diastolic diameters) between the patients on <b>parenteral</b> <b>nutrition</b> and the controls. The incremental elastic modulus was significantly higher in the patients on <b>parenteral</b> <b>nutrition</b> (1. 8 +/- 0. 4 versus 1. 4 +/- 0. 5 4 mm Hg x 10 (3), p < 0. 05) reflecting alteration of the elastic properties of the arterial wall independent of the vessel geometry. The flow-mediated dilatation of the brachial artery was significantly lower in the patients on <b>parenteral</b> <b>nutrition</b> (6 +/- 3 versus 8 +/- 3 %, p < 0. 05), whereas the dilatation after glyceryl trinitrate administration was similar (22 +/- 9 versus 25 +/- 9 %).

40|$|Background & aims There {{has been}} a move to {{increased}} emphasis on delivering <b>parenteral</b> <b>nutrition</b> to patients at home, which may improve patient care and reduce costs. However, safe provision of home, and indeed any, <b>parenteral</b> <b>nutrition</b> necessitates consideration of the physical and chemical stability of the <b>parenteral</b> <b>nutrition</b> and its components. Methods Medline and Embase were used to search for all English-language publications on vitamin stability. Identified publications were then analysed and summarized in the following review. Results Vitamins {{are one of the}} least stable components in PN and there are three main ways in which they have been shown to degrade: photodegradation, oxidation and through storage material interaction. Previous research on vitamins has demonstrated that significant losses can occur in the bag, which could have clinical consequences, particularly for long-term users of <b>parenteral</b> <b>nutrition.</b> These losses are most dramatic for vitamin C, which is rapidly degraded by oxygen, and vitamin A, which is rapidly degraded in the presence of sunlight. Conclusions There are a number of stability issues associated with vitamins in <b>parenteral</b> <b>nutrition</b> and further investigation is needed to assure their stability and compatibility with other <b>parenteral</b> <b>nutrition</b> constituents...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT. We {{tested the}} {{hypothesis}} that the provision of glutamine and branched-chain amino acids would reverse the gut atrophy that accompanies <b>parenteral</b> <b>nutrition.</b> Three hundred seventy-five rats were randomized into 15 groups to receive either conventional <b>parenteral</b> <b>nutrition,</b> rat food, glu-tamine-enriched <b>parenteral</b> <b>nutrition</b> (0. 5 % to 2. 5 %), branched-chain amino acid-enriched <b>parenteral</b> <b>nutrition</b> (0. 8 % to 2. 0 %), or glutamine plus branched-chain amino acid-enriched paren-teral nutrition (0. 5 %/ 0. 4 % to 1. 25 %/ 1 / 0 %). When compared with effects of conventional <b>parenteral</b> <b>nutrition,</b> the infusion of either glutamine or branched-chain amino acids partially reversed, in a dose-dependent manner, atrophy of the small bowel as assessed by gut weight (p <. 05), mucosal weight (p. 05), villous height (p <. 05), crypt cell production rate (p <. 05), and mucosal protein concentration (p <. 05). There was no effect on the large bowel. These results suggest that the parenteral infusion of either glutamine or branched-chai...|$|R
