500|$|Within a day, Moreau {{had four}} {{divisions}} across the river, representing a fundamental {{success of the}} French plan. Furthermore, at Hüningen, near Basel, {{on the same day}} that Moreau's advance guard crossed at Kehl, Ferino executed a full crossing, and advanced unopposed east along the German shore of the Rhine, with the 16th and 50th Demi-brigades, the 68th, 50th and 68th line infantry, and six squadrons of cavalry that included the 3rd and 7th Hussars and the 10th Dragoons. This gave the French the desired <b>pincer</b> <b>effect,</b> with the Army of the Sambre and Meuse approaching from the north, the bulk of the Army of the Rhine and Moselle crossing in the center, and Ferino crossing in the south.|$|E
40|$|In {{the title}} compound, [Zr(C 16 H 13 P) Cl 2], the {{geometry}} at the metal atom is distorted tetra­hedral; the Cl—Zr—Cl angle is 101. 490  (16) ° and the cyclo­penta­dienyl (Cp) centroids subtend an angle of 122. 63  (3) ° at the Zr atom. The P atom lies 0. 474  (3) and 0. 496  (3)  Å {{out of the}} planes of the Cp rings. The C—P—C angle of 91. 42  (7) ° reflects the <b>pincer</b> <b>effect</b> of the two Cp rings. Three C—H⋯Cl, one C—H⋯P, one C—H⋯π and one Cl⋯P inter­action link the mol­ecules to form thick layers parallel to the bc plane...|$|E
40|$|Five new silver {{complexes}} having bidentate N-heterocyclic carbene ligands were synthesized and {{characterized by}} elemental analysis, IR, NMR and mass spectroscopic methods. Four of the ligands used are neutral, having an alcohol group on alkyl substituent {{of one of}} the two nitrogen atoms of the heterocycle [NHC-OH], the fifth, having a ligand alkoxide, is mono-anionic [NHC-O]. A study on the rate of hydrolysis of complexes synthesized, showed that they are stable to hydrolysis even after 24 h. Probably, the <b>pincer</b> <b>effect</b> of both [NHC-OH] and [NHC-O] ligands stabilizes these compounds. All the synthesized complexes do not show cytotoxicity, but they have a significant antibacterial activity. They were tested on Escherichia coli and Bacillus subtilis and data obtained demonstrate that the synthesized Ag-complexes are very promising candidates to be used as antimicrobial compound...|$|E
40|$|Touchscreen {{technologies}} {{provide an}} intuitive and attractive source of sensory/cognitive stimulation for young children. Despite fears that usage {{may have a}} negative impact on toddlers’ cognitive development, empirical evidence is lacking. The current study presents results from the UK Toddler Attentional Behaviours and LEarning with Touchscreens (TABLET) project, examining the association between toddlers’ touchscreen use and the attainment of developmental milestones. Data were gathered in an online survey of 715 parents of 6 - to 36 -month-olds to address two research questions: (1) How does touchscreen use change from 6 to 36 months? (2) In toddlers (19 – 36 months, i. e., above the median age, n = 366), how does retrospectively reported age of first touchscreen usage relate to gross motor (i. e., walking), fine motor (i. e., stacking blocks), and language (i. e., producing two-word utterances) milestones? In our sample, the proportion of children using touchscreens, as well as the average daily usage time, increased with age (youngest quartile, 6 – 11 months: 51. 22 % users, 8. 53 min per day; oldest quartile, 26 – 36 months: 92. 05 % users, average use of 43. 95 min per day). In toddlers, aged 19 – 36 months, age of first touchscreen use was significantly associated with fine motor (stacking blocks), p = 0. 03, after controlling for covariates age, sex, mother’s education (a proxy for socioeconomic status) as well as age of early fine motor milestone achievement (<b>pincer</b> grip). This <b>effect</b> was only present for active scrolling of the touchscreen p = 0. 04, not for video watching. No significant relationships were found between touchscreen use and either gross motor or language milestones. Touchscreen use increases rapidly over the first 3 years of life. In the current study, we find no evidence to support a negative association between the age of first touchscreen usage and developmental milestones. Indeed, earlier touchscreen use, specifically scrolling of the screen, was associated with earlier fine motor achievement. Future longitudinal studies are required to elucidate the temporal order and mechanisms of this association, and to examine the impact of touchscreen use on other, more fine-grained, measures of behavioral, cognitive, and neural development...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThree {{groups of}} unusual forms of tracheobronchial {{compression}} caused by vascular anomalies are presented. Three patients had an encircling right aortic arch with a left-sided descending aorta and ligamentum arteriosum (group 1), two patients had airway compression {{caused by a}} <b>pincer</b> <b>effect</b> between a malposed and enlarged ascending aorta and the descending aorta (group 2), and three patients had airway compression after an arterial switch operation for transposition of the great arteries (group 3). Symptoms developed in all patients {{before the age of}} 4 months, and six of them had multiple failed attempts at extubation before the surgical intervention directed at relieving the airway compression. Fiberoptic endoscopy was used in all patients as a first-line diagnostic tool and was 100 % accurate in establishing the diagnosis. The operations performed were aortic uncrossing in group 1, dissection and aortopexy of the right or left main bronchus in group 2, and dissection of the left main bronchus and lysis of adhesions in group 3. In group 1 there was one early death, resulting from aspiration, and one late death 4 years later, resulting from an unrelated cause. In this group, bronchomalacia was noted after the operation and resolved gradually in the year after the intervention. In group 2, one patient died of an aortobronchial fistula after placement of a bronchial stent. Group 3 patients had good postoperative results. Two of them are completely symptom-free and one has residual bronchomalacia and may need placement of a bronchial stent. (J Thorac Cardiovasc Surg 1996; 112 : 415 - 23...|$|E
