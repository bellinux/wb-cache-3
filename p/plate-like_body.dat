50|$|Trichoplax {{generally}} has a thinly flattened, <b>plate-like</b> <b>body</b> in cross-section around half a millimetre, occasionally {{up to two}} or three millimetres. The body is usually only about 25 µm thick. These colorlessly gray organisms are so thin they are transparent when illuminated from behind, and in most cases are barely visible to the naked eye. Like the single-celled amoebae, which they superficially resemble, they continually change their external shape. In addition, spherical phases occasionally form. These may facilitate movement to new habitats.|$|E
40|$|We {{study the}} impact of a rigid sphere on a {{circular}} elastic plate whose thickness is not small with respect to its diameter, so that Kirchhoff's theory cannot be applied. For plate-like bodies of this kind it is convenient to apply a theory proposed by Levinson [J. Elasticity 7 (1985) 283], which is a compromise between Kirchhoff's solution and that obtained by the integration of Lamé equation of three-dimensional elasticity. The pressure distribution and the extent of the (circular) area of contact of the sphere on the <b>plate-like</b> <b>body</b> is mathematically described by Hertz's theory. By combining these two theories in a dynamical framework, we derive a non-linear ordinary differential equation able to describe the normal slow impact of a rigid sphere against an elastic <b>plate-like</b> <b>body...</b>|$|E
40|$|We {{consider}} a micropolar, linearly elastic <b>plate-like</b> <b>body,</b> clamped on its boundary {{and subject to}} a system of distance loads. We characterize, by means of Γ-convergence, the limit behavior of the solutions of the equilibrium problem when the thickness of the body vanishes. We show that, for the special case of isotropic mechanical response, the equilibrium problem described by our Γ-limit coincides with a boundary-value problem obtained in a recent deduction of a theory for shearable plates from micropolar elasticity...|$|E
40|$|Study {{of living}} frog oocytes with the phase {{microscope}} {{has shown that}} the early yolk appears in two forms. One of these, the protein yolk, consists of thin, dense, <b>plate-like</b> <b>bodies</b> which in face view are almost always regular hexagons. The other form, the fatty yolk, occurs as clusters of globules of varying sizes. The <b>plate-like</b> <b>bodies</b> occur both singly and in clusters. As the oocytes mature these <b>plate-like</b> <b>bodies</b> grow in size while retaining their hexagonal outline. Mitochondria have been observed to increase in length and numbers as the oocytes mature; they are rods or filaments at all stages of growth up to an oocyte diameter of 300 microns. The oocyte cytoplasm gradually becomes packed with long mitochondria, <b>plate-like</b> <b>bodies,</b> and clusters of globules...|$|R

Crust lichens include crustose and aerolate lichens that are appressed to the soil substrate, squamulose lichens with scale- or <b>plate-like</b> <b>bodies</b> that are raised above the soils, and foliose lichens with more “leafy” structures that can {{be attached to the}} soil at only one portion. Lichens with algal symbionts can fix atmospheric carbon, while lichens with cyanobacterial symbionts can fix nitrogen as well. Lichens produce many pigments that help protect them from radiation.|$|R
40|$|International audienceWe {{discuss the}} general linear six-parametric theory of plates {{based on the}} direct approach. We {{consider}} the plate as a deformable surface. Each material point of the surface {{can be regarded as}} an infinitesimal small rigid body with six degrees of freedom. The kinematics of the plate is described by using the vector of translation and the vector of rotation as the independent variables. The relations between the equilibrium conditions of a three-dimensional micropolar <b>plate-like</b> <b>body</b> and the two-dimensional equilibrium equations of the deformable surface are established. Using the three-dimensional constitutive equations of a micropolar material we discuss the determination of the effective stiffness tensors appearing in the two-dimensional constitutive equations...|$|E
40|$|A module is {{described}} with a receiver having a solar energy acceptance opening {{and supported by}} a mounting ring along the optic axis of a parabolic mirror in coaxial alignment for receiving solar energy from the mirror, and a solar flux modulator plate for varying the quantity of solar energy flux received by the acceptance opening of the module. The modulator plate is characterized by an annular, <b>plate-like</b> <b>body,</b> the internal diameter of which is equal to or slightly greater than {{the diameter of the}} solar energy acceptance opening of the receiver. Slave cylinders are connected to the modulator plate for supporting the plate for axial displacement along the axis of the mirror, therby shading the opening with respect to solar energy flux reflected {{from the surface of the}} mirror to the solar energy acceptance opening...|$|E
40|$|We {{consider}} a residually stressed <b>plate-like</b> <b>body</b> having {{the shape of}} a cylinder of cross-section Ï 8 ̆ 9 and thickness hÎµ, subjected to a system of loads proportional to a positive multiplier Î». We look for the smallest value of the multiplier such that the plate buckles, the so-called critical multiplier. The critical multiplier is computed by minimizing a functional whose domain of definition is a collection of vector fields defined in the three-dimensional region Î© Îµ =Ï 8 ̆ 9 Ã 9 ̆ 7 (-Îµh/ 2,+Îµh/ 2). We let Îµ â 8 ̆ 69 ̆ 2 0 and we show that if the residual stress and the incremental stress induced by the applied loads scale with Îµ in a suitable manner, then the critical multiplier converges to a limit that can be computed by minimizing a functional whose domain is a collection of scalar fields defined on the two-dimensional region Ï 8 ̆ 9. In the special case of null residual stress, the Euler-Lagrange equations associated to this functional coincide with the classical equations governing plate buckling...|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT. Massive {{stratiform}} and stratabound sulphide {{bodies in}} the central Appalachians exhibit {{a wide variety of}} metamorphic features which are typical of similar deposits world-wide. The ores occur as lens- to <b>plate-like</b> <b>bodies</b> which are concordant with the enclosing meta-sediments and volcanics and are interpreted as products of Late Precambrian to Early Palaeozoic submarine volcanism. Sulphide mineralization ranges from pyritic to pyrrhotinic bodies with variable, but Zn- and Cu-dominant, base-metal contents. The deposits have been subjected tometamorphism ranging from greenschist to amphibolite grade. The metamorphism has been pervasive and has resulted in thorough recrystallization f most ores and intense deformation f pyrrhotinic ores, but {{does not appear to have}} significantly altered original sulphid...|$|R
40|$|A {{closed form}} {{solution}} for the aeroelastic response of an aircraft swept wing made of advanced composite materials and exposed to a time-dependent thermal field is presented. The thermal field {{is supposed to be}} generated by a laser beam impacting the upper surface of the wing, and, within this context, an uncoupled thermo-elastic model is adopted. The wing structure is modeled as a <b>plate-like</b> <b>body</b> with appropriate internal constraints (in the sense that no thickness extension is permitted into the model) and including warping effects. Although considered in a linearized context, the structural model of the wing incorporates the transverse shear effects, the anisotropy of the constituent materials, as well as the sweep angle. It is supposed that the wing is immersed in a subsonic incompressible flow whose speed is below the flutter critical speed of the system. The solution of the problem has been obtained analytically in a double Laplace transform domain, where both the space and time co-ordinates are converted to their Laplace variable space counterparts. Within this approach, the problem is reduced to the solution of an algebraic problem in the transformed kinematical unknowns. Although this paper is confined {{to the study of the}} dynamic aeroelastic response in the subcritical flight speed regime, the approach of the dynamic response in the time domain provides important information on the occurrence of the flutter instability when the wing is exposed to a time-varying thermal field.

40|$|In {{the present}} work we study {{acceleration}} waves in <b>plate-like</b> <b>bodies</b> using the balance laws for the time-dependent von Karman equations presented in [P. A. Djondjorov and V. M. Vassilev, Conservation Laws and Group-Invariant Solutions of the von Karman Equations, Int. J. Nonlinear Mech. 31 (1), pp. 73 - 87, (1986) ]. Two of these balance laws {{correspond to the}} time-dependent von Karman equations themselves. They are used to define acceleration waves in thin isotropic elastic plates as discontinuity solutions with finite jumps of second derivatives of the displacement field at a certain curve - the wave front. These two balance laws lead through Hadamard's lemma and Kotchin's theorem {{to a set of}} jump conditions on the wave front. Similarly, the other balance laws lead to additional and independent jump conditions on the curve of discontinuity. Several examples are given to illustrate the effect of involving jump conditions of that kind in analysis of acceleration waves in plates. The examples are composed on the basis of three families of group-invariant solutions to the time-dependent von Karman equations. They present three kinds of waveforms pertaining to the class of the so-called relatively undistorded progressive waves. We analyze the propagation of this special kind of acceleration waves into a known state of plate motion. Comment: 6 pages. see [URL]...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. We use a mixed 3 -dimensional variational {{principle}} to derive 2 -dimensional equations for an anisotropic <b>plate-like</b> piezoelectric <b>body</b> and one-dimensional equations for an anisotropic beam-like piezoelectric body. The formulation accounts for double forces without moments which {{may change the}} thickness of the plate and deform the cross-section of the rod. The dependence of the bending rigidities of a transversely isotropic plate upon the angle between the normal to the midsurface and the direction of transverse isotropy is exhibited. The plate equations are used to study the cylindrical deformations of a transversely isotropic plate due to equal and opposite charges applied to its top and bottom surfaces. It is also found that a piezoelectric circular rod with axis of transverse isotropy not coincident with its centroidal axis and subjected to electric charges at the end faces is deformed into a non-prismatic body.
