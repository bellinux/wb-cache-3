50|$|The Circle, Hammersmith & City and Metropolitan {{lines of}} the Underground system all use {{platforms}} 1 and 2, which are through platforms. For terminating trains at busy times, there are platforms 3 and 4 which are west-facing bays. Adjacent to these are platforms 5 and 6 of the former Thameslink trains service from Bedford and Luton. These are disused following {{the closure of the}} Moorgate branch from Farringdon junction as part of the Thameslink Programme and are now used for the storage of <b>permanent</b> <b>way</b> <b>material.</b>|$|E
5000|$|In 1864 a local {{newspaper}} reported that [...] "The Castella Colliery of Dr Lloyd is nearly exhausted." [...] and when serviceable <b>permanent</b> <b>way</b> <b>materials</b> were urgently {{needed to keep the}} main lines going at a time of great financial pressure, the track of the branch was taken up, some time after 31 January 1867.|$|R
50|$|On 16 May 2011, the <b>permanent</b> <b>way</b> <b>materials</b> for {{the level}} {{crossing}} arrived and a donation scheme {{had been set}} up {{for the remainder of the}} money needed. Funds raised through this scheme have since been used to purchase barriers and traffic signals for the crossing ready for installation. In August 2012, trial holes were dug to locate services under the road surface ready for the crossing installation to take place.|$|R
25|$|The war created severe {{shortages}} of <b>permanent</b> <b>way</b> <b>materials</b> {{and a number}} of little used sidings were lifted for the materials they yielded. It was also necessary to resort to using sleepers made from home-grown timber rather than the imported Baltic variety. Steel boiler tubes replaced copper and brass in locomotives for economy and a different pattern of uniform overcoat had to be sourced since the government had commandeered the wool crop.|$|R
50|$|Another branch {{further to}} the north crossed over Ranelagh Road to a {{headshunt}} and then served a warehouse. This was built circa 1920 and was at one time {{going to be a}} new route into Ipswich docks avoiding the level crossing on the other branch. The warehouse served a number of companies including Boots, J Lyons & Co, McFarLanes Biscuits, and Swift and Co. The site was also used to dump redundant <b>permanent</b> <b>way</b> <b>materials</b> and in the 1970s travelling circuses used the site.|$|R
50|$|Fox then {{entered into}} {{partnership}} with the contractor Francis Braham to form the company Braham, Fox and Co., which when Braham retired became Fox, Henderson and Co., of London, Smethwick, and Renfrew. The company specialised in railway equipment, including wheels, bridges, roofs, cranes, tanks and <b>permanent</b> <b>way</b> <b>materials.</b> It also experimented with components for suspension and girder bridges, with Fox reading a paper before the Royal Society in 1865. The company was responsible for many important station roofs including Liverpool Tithebarn Street, (1849-50), Bradford Exchange (1850), Paddington and Birmingham New Street.|$|R
50|$|An {{attempt to}} reopen {{part of the}} line by the Border Union Railway Company, a private concern in which Tomorrow's World {{presenter}} Bob Symes was involved, failed {{due to lack of}} finance. British Rail had been asking for between £745,000 and £960,000 for the freehold of the line, £125,000 annually for running powers into Edinburgh and Carlisle, £85,000 for works in Carlisle, £10,000 towards their administrative costs and £495,000 for the value of the <b>permanent</b> <b>way</b> <b>materials.</b> A deposit of £250,000 had to be paid by 1 December 1969.|$|R
50|$|The N&BJR {{extended}} its line to Cockley Brake, approaching Banbury, on 1 June 1872 (authorised by a further Bill in 1870). Goods traffic {{had been carried}} as far as Helmdon since August 1871. The extension was 15 miles in length, and was constructed using very light <b>permanent</b> <b>way</b> <b>materials,</b> which caused difficulties later. The junction at Cockley Brake was over five miles from Banbury, and running powers over the Buckinghamshire Railway were necessary to reach that place. The company was able to operate a passenger service from Blisworth through Towcester, Wappenham, Helmdon and Cockley Brake to Banbury. It worked the line itself with second hand engines acquired from the LNWR until 1875, from which time they were hired from that company throughout the remaining lifetime of the N&BJR.|$|R

In this paper, management information system of railway <b>permanent</b> <b>way</b> safety risks and comprehensive evaluation is built through the integration of existing resources of the railway <b>permanent</b> <b>way</b> department, to achieve scientific and standardized management.

5000|$|In early 2000, {{attention}} {{turned back}} to the <b>permanent</b> <b>way</b> from Woody Bay - Haste Hill. A plan of major track renewals was formulated, to gradually upgrade the entire RLR <b>permanent</b> <b>way</b> to the modern standard seen on stage 3.|$|R
5000|$|The <b>permanent</b> <b>way</b> is the {{elements}} of railway lines: generally the pairs of rails typically laid on the sleepers ("ties" [...] in American parlance) embedded in ballast, intended to carry the ordinary trains of a railway. It is described as <b>permanent</b> <b>way</b> because in the earlier days of railway construction, contractors often laid a temporary track to transport spoil and materials about the site; when this work was substantially completed, the temporary track was taken up and the <b>permanent</b> <b>way</b> installed.|$|R

40|$|Purpose. The {{deficit of}} <b>permanent</b> <b>way</b> (PW) <b>material</b> {{elements}} {{leads to a}} revision of the re-use of old serviceable object after their replacement or repair. As {{an example is the}} following fact, that after the wear in the under-rail area of wooden sleepers and beams, or other defects that prevent their further exploitation, there is an acute issue of their planned replacement. Usually, the required minimum margin of sleepers is always in the track service brigades. As for the wooden beams the length of which in the turnouts is up to 5 m, there is not always possible quickly replace them {{due to the lack of}} size in the short term. Therefore, the geometric dimensions of the connect elements of the two halves of the beams or sleepers in a single rigid structure were proposed and justified and its characteristics do not differ from solid beam. Methodology. The authors considered the calculation algorithm of wooden elements connection and mathematical models that describe the elastic properties of base. The most adequate technique that fully characterizes the interactions beam in the form of a beam of finite length on the ballast was determined. Findings. The qualitative and quantitative verification of the results showed a very good agreement between the values of bending moments, shear forces and deflections that were obtained by the finite difference method (FDM) and the analytical method. It gives the reason to believe that the received geometric dimensions of nag connection can be recommended to employees of track facilities to connect the wooden sleepers on the switches and crossovers. Originality. The nag connection geometrical sizes of two wooden sleepers in the beam for using on switches were substantiated. Practical value. The proposed joint design allows re-using of renovated old wooden sleepers and bars. This design can be applied not only for the connection of conventional wooden sleepers in the beam of desired length, but also to create the halves of a single sleeper designs for lightly loaded sections of the station and access routes...|$|R
