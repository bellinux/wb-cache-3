40|$|Abstract There is {{a growing}} {{interest}} in management of MSW through micro-treatment of organic fraction of municipal solid wastes (OFMSW) in many cities of India. The OFMSW fraction is high (> 80 %) in many pockets within South Indian cities like Bangalore, Chikkamagalur, etc. and is largely represented by vegetable, fruit, packing and garden wastes. Among these, the last three have shown problems for easy decomposition. Fruit wastes are characterized by a large pectin supported fraction that decomposes quickly to organic acids (becomes pulpy) that eventually slow down anaerobic and aerobic decomposition processes.

40|$|Fermentable {{components}} of municipal solid wastes (MSW) such as {{fruit and vegetable}} wastes (FVW), leaf litter, paddy straw, cane bagasse, cane trash and paper are generated in large quantities at various pockets of the city. These form potential feedstocks for decentralized biogas plants to be operated in the vicinity. We characterized the fermentation potential of six of the above MSW fractions for their suitability to be converted to biogas and anaerobic compost using the solid-state stratified bed (SSB) process in a laboratory study. FVW and leaf litter (papermulberry leaves) decomposed almost completely while paddy straw, sugarcane trash, sugarcane bagasse and <b>photocopying</b> <b>paper</b> decomposed to a lower extent. In the SSB process between 50 - 60 % of the biological methane potential (BMP) could be realized. Observations revealed that the SSB process needs to be adapted differently {{for each of the}} feedstocks to obtain a higher gas recovery. Bagasse produced the largest fraction of anaerobic compost (fermentation residue) and has the potential for reuse in many ways...|$|E
40|$|There is {{a growing}} {{interest}} in management of MSW through micro-treatment of organic fraction of municipal solid wastes (OFMSW) in many cities of India. The OFMSW fraction is high (> 80 %) in many pockets within South Indian cities like Bangalore, Chikkamagalur, etc. and is largely represented by vegetable, fruit, packing and garden wastes. Among these, the last three have shown problems for easy decomposition. Fruit wastes are characterized by a large pectin supported fraction that decomposes quickly to organic acids (becomes pulpy) that eventually slow down anaerobic and aerobic decomposition processes. Paper fraction (newsprint and <b>photocopying</b> <b>paper)</b> as well as paddy straw (packing), bagasse (from cane juice stalls) and tree leaf litter (typical garden waste and street sweepings) are found in reasonably large proportions in MSW. These decompose slowly due to poor nutrients or physical state. We have examined the suitability of these substrates for micro-composting in plastic bins by tracking decomposition pattern and physical changes. It was found that fruit wastes decompose rapidly to produce organic acids and large leachate fraction such that it {{may need to be}} mixed with leachate absorbing materials (dry wastes) for good composting. Leaf litter, paddy straw and bagasse decompose to the tune of 90, 68 and 60 % VS and are suitable for composting micro-treatment. Paper fractions even when augmented with 10 % leaf compost failed to show appreciable decomposition in 50 days. All these feedstocks were found to have good biological methane potential (BMP) and showed promise for conversion to biogas under a mixed feed operation. Suitability of this approach was verified by operating a plug-flow type anaerobic digester where only leaf litter gathered nearby (as street sweepings) was used as feedstock. Here only a third of the BMP was realized at this scale (0. 18 m(3) biogas/kg VS 0. 55 m(3) /kg in BMP). We conclude that anaerobic digestion in plug-flow like digesters appear a more suitable micro-treatment option (2 - 10 kg VS/day) because in addition to compost it also produces biogas for domestic use nearby...|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{the present}} study was to {{characterize}} the enzymatic deinking of various types of waste paper. Studies on the optimization of enzymatic deinking have been performed previously using commercially available enzyme preparations containing cellulase and hemicellulase. The enzymatic deinking of different types of waste paper demonstrated a high efficiency of 86. 6 % on laser-printed paper, but a low deinking efficiency of 12. 9 % was obtained with newspaper. All enzymatic treatments significantly improved the drainage rate of the deinked waste paper. Enzymatic deinking increased the tensile index of magazine paper but reduced the tensile index of bubble jet-printed <b>paper,</b> <b>photocopy</b> <b>paper</b> and newspaper. Enzymatic hydrolysis caused a 21. 1 % reduction in the tear index for bubble jet-printed paper, but a 3. 1 % increase in the tear index was obtained for laser-printed paper relative to respective blank. In addition, enzymatic hydrolysis increased the burst index by 4. 7 % relative to blank for laser-printed <b>paper.</b> However, <b>photocopy</b> <b>paper</b> showed the highest reduction (8. 3 %) in the burst index relative to blank. Taken together, these results suggest that enzymatic hydrolysis is both advantageous and detrimental to the mechanical properties of deinked paper. Thus, the proper regulation of enzymatic hydrolysis is crucial to improve the quality of recycled paper...|$|R

Significant differences in these measurements were registered among investigators and were of major importance (p < 0. 001). This finding illustrates the difficulty in comparing mean values from different studies and emphasizes the difficulties in applying limits for a normal QTcinterval to data obtained by different observers.

Results showed the method to be robust to alterations in reagent addition, but not to significant concentration changes. The presence of all components was found to be desirable for distinguishable development of fingerprint detail.

Finally, the use of malic acid gave equivalent fingerprint development but higher background in comparison to maleic acid...|$|R
50|$|Until December 2007 the {{technology}} behind {{the process of}} preparing each issue was unsatisfactory. Due to lack of funds, each page was prepared by hand; the infrastructure installed in the newspaper's office consisted of a 486 microprocessor-based PC, an inkjet printer and one photocopy machine. Text was written and printed, and then cut in a rectangle shape of physical width matching that of the newspaper's column. All the rectangles assembling the final columns would then be glued to a thin sheet A2 sized paper which would be photocopied and become the master copy for that page. The process would be repeated {{for each of the}} four daily pages of the newspaper, which would then be outsourced to a modern printing facility to be photographed and printed using a photo-offset printing method. Because of the use of <b>photocopy</b> <b>paper</b> (as opposed to using a film), the resulting contrast was too poor to allow any detail to be seen in photographs, thus banning them from the final print. After December 2007 and because of the widespread access to technology the newspaper's budget allowed the renewal of the equipment, and it is now being issued using modern digital methods.|$|R

40|$|Based on {{preliminary}} researches, {{stem and}} branchwood of Paraserianthes falcataria L. Nielsen were suitable {{as raw material}} for pulp and paper manufacture. For the whole tree the highest proportion of bark was found in branches {{and the top of}} the tree with a value ranging 20 â€“ 35 %. Up to now, the pulp industries have spent money to remove bark of P. falcataria branch before pulping. The objective {{of this study was to}} know the suitability of branches including bark as raw material for pulp and paper manufacture. Samples were determined for fiber dimension and its derivation. Screened chips were cooked with the Kraft process. Liquor-to-wood-ratio was 4 : 1. Chemical charge was 13. 3 % NaOH and 6. 7 % Na 2 S. The temperature was raised from room temperature to 170 oC for 90 min and kept at this temperature for 90 min. Pulp was washed; then kappa number, screened and rejected pulp, residual of black liquor were determined. Research results showed that pulp branchwood with bark has the values of screened pulp yield, alkali consumption, and kappa number 46. 91 %; 9, 57; and 25. 63, respectively.
