5|$|As governor, Seward {{incurred}} considerable <b>personal</b> <b>debt</b> {{not only}} {{because he had to}} live beyond his salary to maintain the lifestyle expected of the office, but also because he could not pay down his obligation from the land company purchase. At the time he left office, he owed $200,000. Returning to Auburn, he absorbed himself in a profitable law practice. He did not abandon politics, and received former president Adams at the Seward family home in 1843.|$|E
5|$|The Almost Nearly Perfect People {{is divided}} into five {{sections}} for Denmark, Iceland, Norway, Finland and Sweden. Beginning with Denmark, Booth explains the Danish concept of hygge ("cosy times"), which he sees as conformism. He criticises the Danish population's environmental footprint and notes that their taxation rate and levels of <b>personal</b> <b>debt</b> are {{among the highest in}} the world. Moving to Iceland, Booth details the banking practices that led to the collapse of the country's largest banks in the 2008 financial crisis, as well as the popular belief among Icelanders in the existence of Huldufólk (elves).|$|E

25|$|The early 1980s saw {{the country}} facing a {{difficult}} period {{of structural adjustment}} caused by declining demand for its traditional products, deteriorating economic performance, and neglected structural reform. Consequently, the 1980–82 recession shook Belgium to the core—unemployment mounted, social welfare costs increased, <b>personal</b> <b>debt</b> soared, the government deficit climbed to 13% of GDP, and the national debt, although mostly held domestically, mushroomed.|$|E
25|$|Unlike {{those in}} many other countries, US medical {{students}} typically finance their education with <b>personal</b> <b>debt.</b> In 1992, the average debt of a medical doctor after residency was $25,000. For the class of 2009, the average debt of a medical student is $157,990 and 25.1% of students had debt in excess of $200,000 (prior to residency). For the past decade the cost of attendance has increased 5-6% each year (roughly 1.6 to 2.1 times inflation).|$|E
25|$|The {{controversy}} over Article 23 began in mid-2002 when Qian Qichen, Vice Premier of the State Council, expressed Beijing's desire for Hong Kong {{to pass the}} required legislation quickly. This prompted the Chief Executive of Hong Kong Tung Chee Hwa {{to begin the process}} of drafting the said legislation. Many in Hong Kong believe that Tung's responsiveness to this request, in contrast to what is commonly perceived to be his lack of desire, was due in part to the fact that Tung himself owes a <b>personal</b> <b>debt</b> to the PRC government: his family's shipping conglomerate Orient Overseas was bailed out for the sum of US $110 million by Chinese government-owned companies in the 1980s.|$|E

25|$|In {{the closing}} {{years of the}} {{politically}} and socially unstable Late Republic, any aristocratic owner of gladiators had political muscle at his disposal. In 65 BC, newly elected curule aedile Julius Caesar held games that he justified as munus to his father, who {{had been dead for}} 20 years. Despite an already enormous <b>personal</b> <b>debt,</b> he used three hundred and twenty gladiator pairs in silvered armour. He had more available in Capua but the Senate, mindful of the recent Spartacus revolt and fearful of Caesar's burgeoning private armies and rising popularity, imposed a limit of 320 pairs as the maximum number of gladiators any citizen could keep in Rome. Caesar's showmanship was unprecedented in scale and expense; he had staged a munus as memorial rather than funeral rite, eroding any practical or meaningful distinction between munus and ludi.|$|E
25|$|With Chase Manhattan Bank {{demanding}} repayment, Trump sold {{controlling interest}} of the project to a consortium of Hong Kong- and China-based investors called Polylinks in June 1994. The Hong Kong and China consortium Polylinks International Ltd., represented by real estate broker Susan Cara, paid $82 million to Chase to obtain the property, after renegotiating both Trump's business and <b>personal</b> <b>debt</b> down from $300 million. This joint venture finally put in motion the largest private development project in New York City history. Trump remained as {{the public face of}} the group, as he has on many other projects, but he lost control. Due to the weak economy, as well as significant community opposition, construction was delayed for several years as lawsuits were resolved and the new investors sought public financing. Trump was accused of political payoffs to Republican State Senate Majority Leader Joseph Bruno in return for the latter's prospective approval of a state low-interest mortgage for the project. The state mortgage was never granted.|$|E
500|$|The German {{nature of}} [...] "Metzengerstein" [...] {{and other stories}} in the {{collection}} Tales of the Grotesque and Arabesque was mentioned in a review by Joseph C. Neal in the Pennsylvanian on December 6, 1839: [...] "These grotesque and arabesque delineations are full of variety, now irresistibly quaint and droll, and again marked with all the deep and painful interest of the German school". Rudyard Kipling was an admirer of Poe and once wrote, [...] "My own <b>personal</b> <b>debt</b> to Poe is a heavy one".

500|$|Prokofiev {{had time}} to write his postwar Sixth Symphony and his Ninth Piano Sonata (for Sviatoslav Richter) before the {{so-called}} [...] "Zhdanov Decree". In early 1948, following a meeting of Soviet composers convened by Andrei Zhdanov, the Politburo issued a resolution denouncing Prokofiev, Dmitri Shostakovich, Myaskovsky, and Khachaturian {{of the crime of}} [...] "formalism", described as a [...] "renunciation of the basic principles of classical music" [...] in favour of [...] "muddled, nerve-racking" [...] sounds that [...] "turned music into cacophony". Eight of Prokofiev's works were banned from performance: The Year 1941, Ode to the End of the War, Festive Poem, Cantata for the Thirtieth Anniversary of October, Ballad of an Unknown Boy, the 1934 piano cycle Thoughts, and Piano Sonatas Nos 6 and 8. Such was the perceived threat behind the banning of the works that even works that had avoided censure were no longer programmed: by August 1948, Prokofiev was in severe financial straits, his <b>personal</b> <b>debt</b> amounting to 180,000 rubles.|$|E

2500|$|At {{the same}} time, however, Webster, like Clay, opposed the {{economic}} policies of Andrew Jackson, {{the most famous}} of those being Jackson's campaign against the Second Bank of the United States (1816–1841) in 1832, an institution that held Webster on retainer as legal counsel and of whose Boston Branch he was the director. Clay, Webster, {{and a number of other}} former Federalists and National Republicans united as the Whig Party, in defense of the Bank against Jackson's intention to replace it. There was an economic panic in 1837, which converted Webster's heavy speculation in midwestern property into a <b>personal</b> <b>debt</b> from which Webster never recovered. His debt was exacerbated by his propensity for living [...] "habitually beyond his means", lavishly furnishing his estate and giving away money with [...] "reckless generosity and heedless profusion", in addition to indulging the smaller-scale [...] "passions and appetites" [...] of gambling and alcohol.|$|E

2500|$|Flora Rheta Schreiber, {{the author}} of the bestselling book, Sybil, {{interview}}ed Kallinger in jail in 1976. The interview was the basis for a book on the case which was published by Simon & Schuster under the title, The Shoemaker: The Anatomy of a Psychotic in 1983. This book was later part of a Son of Sam lawsuit brought by one of the victim's families as Kallinger received royalties for the book. A judge awarded the family earnings from not only Kallinger, but Schreiber and Simon & Schuster as well, leaving Schreiber nearly $100,000 in <b>personal</b> <b>debt</b> due to expenses of the book's research (including phone calls to Kallinger in prison which totaled $1200 per month for several years). A later appellate panel awarded only Kallinger's royalties to the families. Michael Korda, editor at Simon & Schuster, said that for many years he received a Christmas card from Kallinger from jail. [...] Schreiber herself grew very close to Kallinger during the writing process, and the two exchanged regular letters and phone calls until Schreiber's death in 1988.|$|E
2500|$|In the United States, {{the protests}} have helped shift {{the focus of}} {{national}} dialogue from {{the federal budget deficit}} to economic problems many ordinary Americans face, such as unemployment, the large amount of student and other <b>personal</b> <b>debt</b> that burdens middle class and working class Americans, and other major issues of social inequality, such as homelessness. The movement appears to have generated a national conversation about income inequality, as evidenced by the fact that print and broadcast news mentioned the term [...] "income inequality" [...] more than five times more often during the last week of October 2011 than during the week before the occupation began. Longer term effects are much less clear, as according to Google search trends, in the years since 2012 interest has waned. Occupy movement raised awareness regarding what organizers consider undeserved wealth and lack of fairness in American society. Labor unions have become bolder in the tactics they employ and have been using digital social media more effectively thanks to the Occupy movement. In New York City, the Occupy Wall Street protest has also provided hundreds of protesters to help in picket actions conducted by labor unions.|$|E
