5|$|Over time, {{the company}} reformulates various {{products}} {{in an attempt}} to boost sales of the product or to improve the taste, appearance, or physical consistency of the product. One such example of this is the BK Big Fish, the company's fish sandwich offering in North America. Burger King's original fish sandwich, introduced as early as the late 1960s in some markets, was called the Whaler; it was a smaller fish sandwich made with tartar sauce and lettuce served on the small sesame seed roll BK used for their hamburgers. When Burger King introduced its broiled chicken sandwich in 1990, the BK Broiler, it changed the fish sandwich's breading to a panko style, began serving it on an oatmeal-dusted roll that was used for the broiled chicken sandwich, and renamed the product the Ocean Catch sandwich. When BK reformulated the BK Broiler, the company also reformulated the Ocean Catch as the BK Big Fish in its current configuration. The sandwich was again briefly reformulated after the <b>phase-out</b> of the Baguette sandwiches, and was reintroduced as the Big Fish in 2005.|$|E
5|$|The {{second part}} of the chain is {{composed}} of the Northwestern Hawaiian Islands, collectively referred to as the Leeward isles, the constituents of which are between 7.2 and 27.7million years in age. Erosion has long since overtaken volcanic activity at these islands, {{and most of them are}} atolls, atoll islands, and extinct islands. They contain many of the most northerly atolls in the world; one of them, Kure Atoll, is the northern-most atoll in the world. On June 15, 2006, U.S. President George W. Bush issued a proclamation creating Papahānaumokuākea Marine National Monument under the Antiquities Act of 1906. The national monument, meant to protect the biodiversity of the Hawaiian isles, encompasses all of the northern isles, and is one of the largest such protected areas in the world.

30|$|Most {{countries}} operate gradual benefit <b>phase-outs</b> {{for individuals}} who manage to earn only limited amounts (e.g., by working a few hours while looking for a higher-paying job). Disregarding {{a certain amount of}} earnings in the income test, or ignoring marginal working hours in the eligibility test of out-of-work benefits, can provide strong incentives to supplement benefit income {{with a small amount of}} earnings and to seek or maintain at least some link with the labour market, e.g., in the form of marginal employment of a few hours a week. But, often, they do not provide a genuine incentive to increase employment incomes further; steep benefit <b>phase-outs</b> further up the earnings scale, combined with relatively high tax or social contribution burdens for non-marginal workers can mean that earning more “does not pay” (for instance, OECD calculations indicate that the net income of a German single parent is about the same whether she earns 15 % or 60 % of the average wage). 5 In this way, it is possible that in-work benefits can act as a disincentive for low-wage workers to work longer hours or invest in their human capital.|$|R

40|$|There is {{a growing}} {{interest}} related to the theoretical analysis of Free Trade Agreements (FTAs). Nevertheless, there has been as yet very little empirical research on the topic, in particular, on the negotiating dynamics {{of these types of}} agreements. This paper attempts to make a contribution in this direction examining {{the relationship between the two}} most important market access instruments in the case of NAFTA negotiations: the preferential tariff <b>phase-outs</b> and the accompanying rules of origin (RoO). The traditional literature has viewed market access negotiations solely in terms of tariff (and non-tariff) negotiations. From an analytical point of view, the role of RoO, that is the rules that are designed to determine the origin of products in international trade, has usually been restricted to a "secondary" or "supportive" function. As such, RoO were seen to assist in the application or implementation of other "primary" instruments. In the case of preferential RoO, they help to determine when a particular good will be granted preferential tariff treatment. Using a newly constructed data set this paper estimates a simultaneous equation model where the endogenous variables are the preferential tariff <b>phase-outs</b> between Mexico and the United States and the RoO under the NAFTA agreement. The empirical findings of this paper support the view that in accordance with recent literature, the NAFTA RoO were used as an independent commercial policy instrument with a "primary" market access function as it is the case with the traditional preferential tariffs...|$|R

40|$|The {{objective}} of this thesis was to evaluate the environmental trade-offs inherent in multi-criteria objectives of an integrated environmental policy. A probabilistic multi-attribute impact pathway analysis (MAIPA) was formulated to assess the environmental damages of US commercial aircraft operations from 1991 - 2003. The initial contribution of this work was demonstrating the feasibility of, and identifying requirements for, the FAA Aviation-environmental Portfolio Management Tool (APMT), an integrated assessment capability for US regulatory decision-making. Non-aircraft sources {{have been found to}} dictate marginal emissions costs. The implication is that aviation emissions reductions influence neither the magnitudes nor trends in per-unit marginal damages. In contrast, noise mitigation is the dominant influence on the value of per-unit marginal damages. Trends in sum damages were found to depend on the growth rates of air transport relative to other source emissions. Growth in air transport emissions outpaced non-aircraft sources from 1991 - 2003. Because growth in marginal costs is nonlinear over this period, aviation emissions damages grow faster than inventories. Applying methods similar to MAIPA to estimate damages for future scenarios suggests that stemming climate impacts is fast becoming the priority. A reassessment of the environmental benefits derived from mandated <b>phase-outs</b> of noisy aircraft during the 1990 's has been carried out. Previous studies estimated a - 80 % reduction in population exposure. In contrast, the reassessment estimates a ~ 2 % reduction, providing benefits 17 - 20 times lower than published estimates of abatement costs. (cont.) The primary environmental benefit of the noise <b>phase-outs</b> was found to be related to reductions in particulate matter inventories. One way to avoid trade-off inefficiencies is to identify options that bundle benefits. This action provides such an example, where the <b>phase-outs</b> led to reductions in both noise and air quality emissions. Other contributions in the thesis include the following: a treatment of air transport particulate matter emissions, environmental fate, and health impacts of particulate matter; identification that the major source of reducible uncertainty in emissions damages stems from the assumed extent of ozone and particulate matter production in the engine exhaust plume; and quantification of the environmental tradeoffs in decisions specifying aircraft performance for the technology in the US commercial fleet from 1991 - 2003. by Stephen P.
