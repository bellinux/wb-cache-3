5|$|A {{number of}} Welsh writers have {{drawn on the}} lives of the quarrymen for their material, for example the novels of T. Rowland Hughes. Chwalfa, {{translated}} into English as Out of their night (1954), has the Penrhyn Quarry dispute as a background, while Y cychwyn, translated as The beginning (1969), follows the apprenticeship of a young quarryman. Several novels by Kate Roberts, the daughter of a quarryman, give a <b>picture</b> <b>of</b> the area around Rhosgadfan, where the slate industry was on a smaller scale and many of the quarrymen were also smallholders. Her novel Traed mewn cyffion (1936), translated as Feet in chains (2002), gives a vivid <b>picture</b> <b>of</b> the struggles of a quarrying family in the period between 1880 and 1914. Y Chwarelwr ("The Quarryman") produced in 1935 was the first Welsh-language film. It showed various aspects of a slate quarryman's life at Blaenau Ffestiniog.|$|E

5|$|Adler's memoirs were {{published}} in the New York socialist Yiddish-language newspaper Die Varheit in 1916–1919, and briefly resumed in 1925 in an unsuccessful revival of that paper; his granddaughter Lulla Rosenfeld's English translation was published only in 1999. The 1916–1919 portion of the memoir gives a detailed <b>picture</b> <b>of</b> his Russian years. The 1925 portion gives a comparably detailed <b>picture</b> <b>of</b> his time in London, although with some evasions around the relative timing of his relationships with his wife Sonya and with Jennya Kaiser and Dinah Shtettin. It contains only a relatively fragmentary description of his New York career. In the English-language book of these memoirs, Rosenfeld attempts to fill the gaps with her own commentary.|$|E

40|$|We {{designed}} our experimental {{task based}} on previous experience with behavioral tasks in the intraoperative en-vironment [1] raised the concern that patients would suffer a lack of motivation during a study if a complicated reward-learning paradigm was attempted. In previous DBS surgeries, we found that single unit activity recorded from the ventral striatum is minimal unless patients are prompted to contemplate pleasant thoughts, specifically pleasant images or sensations. We therefore designed a study in which the participant played a simple video game {{in order to receive}} reward stimuli. During her pre-operative consultation, the participant performed a task in which her preferences for different categories of visual stimuli were assessed. The goal was to identify the most and least preferred categories of stimuli to insure that the images used as reward stimuli during the intraoperative task were salient to the individual, and therefore more likely to elicit a response in reward-sensitive cells in the ventral striatum. Eleven categories were selected, and 120 different images from each category were compiled from the International Affective Picture System (IAPS) database and supplemented from additional internet image archives [2]. The categories were selected in an attempt to appeal to a range of aesthetic tastes. The eleven categories were: <b>pictures</b> <b>of</b> attractive men, <b>pictures</b> <b>of</b> attractive women, <b>pictures</b> <b>of</b> celebrities <b>of</b> both sexes, <b>pictures</b> <b>of</b> beautiful nature scenery, <b>pictures</b> <b>of</b> beautiful urban/structure scenery, <b>pictures</b> <b>of</b> savory foods, <b>pictures</b> <b>of</b> sweet foods, <b>pictures</b> <b>of</b> smoking/cigarette paraphernalia, <b>pictures</b> <b>of</b> alcoholic beverages and alcohol paraphernalia, picture...|$|R
