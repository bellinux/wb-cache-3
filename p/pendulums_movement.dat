40|$|This paper {{describes}} the behaviour of deadweight force standard machines of 100 kN and 1 MN at the Physikalisch-Technische Bundesanstalt(PTB). A build-up system {{was used to}} measure the dynamic behaviour of the deadweight force standard machines. The oscillating signals from the force-transducers in a build-up system are much larger than those from a single force-transducer. This is because the force-transducers in a build-up system are located several tens of millimeters from the centre of the force-standard machine. Hence, small movements of the deadweight result in changes in the reaction forces of the build-up system, which are amplified by the lever mechanism. The frequency and the trajectory of the <b>pendulum’s</b> <b>movements</b> are investigated. The trajectories of the <b>pendulum’s</b> <b>movements</b> are estimated by using force signals from the build-up system. In addition to that, the major and minor radii, direction of the elliptic motion and the rotational direction as functions of time are estimated to interpret the <b>pendulum’s</b> <b>movements</b> more meaningfully. The two machines show somewhat different dynamic behaviour. 1...|$|R

40|$|Precision {{engineering}} tasks require active isolation {{systems that}} are efficient especially at low frequencies. The limitations of such control systems include {{the resolution of the}} sensor used and the magnetic coupling between the sensor and the actuator. In order to bypass these limitations, inertial sensors using Michelson interferometer are being developed. A first prototype has been built and tested. It has been shown that it has a sub-nanometer resolution over a large frequency range, extending from 0. 1 Hz to 100 Hz. To further improve the resolution, a new optical design will be presented in this paper. The elements of the setup are chosen to lower the noise of the whole system. Actually, two main sources of noise can be reduced. The first one is due to the optical components, inducing a phase shift which is converted into a displacement error. The second is a consequence of the <b>pendulum</b> <b>movement</b> of the piece/spring holding the moving mass. It couples the vertical translation and the rotation. By choosing correctly the optical components, the first source can be diminished. The resolution reached is compared with that predicted by the optical model implemented on MATLAB. With the best optical resolution of the setup achieved, the interferometer had been integrated into a STS 1 seismometer to reduce the <b>pendulum</b> <b>movement.</b> The optical sensor replaces the conventional capacitive sensor of the device without disturbing the mechanical parts.

40|$|This {{research}} examined three {{explanations for}} the "superstitious" behavior of pigeons under frequent fixed-time delivery of food: accidental response-reward contingency, stimulus substitution, and elicited species-typical appetitive behavior. The behavior observed in these studies consisted of occasional postfood locomotion away from the food hopper, and a predominant pattern of activity directed toward the hopper wall (wall-directed behavior), including approaching, stepping side to side, scratching with the feet, bumping with the breast, <b>pendulum</b> <b>movements</b> of the extended neck, and head bobbing, though not pecking. The consistency of these behavior patterns argued against explanation by accidental response contingencies, and the complexity of behavior was incompatible with the classic stimulus-substitution account. These studies also showed that: (1) response contingencies and prior stimulus experience can modify wall-directed behavior, but within definable limits; (2) pecking sometimes can be obtained in birds of specific strains, and by providing extended training; (3) placing the hopper in the floor {{at the center of}} a large chamber replaces wall-directed behavior with circling in a manner that resembles ground foraging for food. We conclude that superstitious behavior under periodic delivery of food probably develops from components of species-typical patterns of appetitive behavior related to feeding.

In synchronous-successive judgment paradigms, the curve indicating {{the proportion of}} 2 ̆ 2 synchronous 2 ̆ 2 responses is thus not symmetric around physical synchrony, but centers around a certain positive delay (audio following video), called the point of subjective simultaneity (PSS). Here we report an investigation of whether the causal interpretation of the audio-visual event by the observer influences synchrony perception. We estimated the PSS for an animation of Newton’s Cradle, showing a left-to-right <b>pendulum</b> <b>movement,</b> with three visual conditions: (1) the entire stimulus, (2) the left half, or (3) the right half.

Using a procedure with ‘audio first,’ ‘video first,’ and ‘synchronous’ response alternatives, conditions 1 and 2 yielded positive PSSs, whereas for condition 3, perceptual synchrony coincided with physical synchrony. Such a shift in synchrony responses is in line with the interpretation that PSSs found in synchrony judgment experiments are influenced at least partially by the apparent causal relation between auditory and visual stimulus components...|$|R

A importÃncia de se estudar o fenÃmeno dos movimentos pendulares, especificamente dos trabalhadores, se faz devido Ã difusÃo das tendÃncias urbanas ocorridas nos grandes centros e pelo grande potencial que esse fenÃmeno tem em se alastrar pelo territÃrio nacional e, fundamentalmente, em razÃo do crescimento das cidades de porte mÃdio no interior do paÃs. Preliminarmente, foram levantadas as abordagens teÃricas sobre a questÃo urbana, principalmente das redes e hierarquias urbanas, pois estas sÃo fundamentais para a funcionabilidade dos movimentos urbanos. Logo apÃs, foram feitas algumas consideraÃÃes sobre as migraÃÃes internas e movimentos pendulares. A pesquisa metodolÃgica priorizou dois pontos, os quais sÃo: a anÃlise da literatura disponÃvel e a pesquisa de campo com os usuÃrios do Ãnibus metropolitano na regiÃo estudada. Para tanto, se adotou como critÃrio para as cidades de porte mÃdio os municÃpios com uma populaÃÃo entre 100 mil e 500 mil habitantes no Brasil. Nos resultados foi traÃado um perfil socioeconÃmico da populaÃÃo que utiliza o Ãnibus metropolitano como meio de transporte para o deslocamento intermunicipal entre as cidades de Cascavel e Toledo. Dessa forma, observou-se que 70, 33 % dos entrevistados estavam empregados e que a grande maioria (58, 75 %) apresentavam ter o ensino mÃdio completo ou superior, como nÃvel de escolaridade. Outra evidencia foi de que 54, 67 % dos entrevistados tinham uma faixa de atÃ 4 salÃrios mÃnimos como renda familiar. Em seguida foram analisadas as informaÃÃes relacionadas aos trabalhadores pendulares nos sentidos Cascavel-Toledo e Toledo-Cascavel, indicando caracterÃsticas, como sexo, idade, escolaridade, salÃrio, renda salarial, setor de ocupaÃÃo, tempo mÃdio despendido no movimento pendular e, tambÃm, a freqÃÃncia desses movimentos. ApÃs o perfil dos trabalhadores pendulares observou-se que esses apresentaram fatores econÃmicos como motivaÃÃo para realizar tais movimentos e fatores sociais como motivos para nÃo migrarem para as cidades que estavam trabalhando. Dessa forma, tais dados evidenciaram algumas tendÃncias e particulares daqueles que utilizam o Ãnibus metropolitano como deslocamento intermunicipal.

The central {{objective of}} this work {{was to examine the}} phenomenon of <b>pendulum</b> <b>movements</b> between the medium size towns of Cascavel and Toledo, located in the West Mesoregion of the State of ParanÃ. The importance of studying the phenomenon of <b>pendulum</b> <b>movements,</b> specifically of the commuters, is due to the diffusion of the urban tendencies in the great centers and for the great potential that the phenomenon has in spreading out across the national territory and, fundamentally {{as a result of the}} growth of the medium towns in the country. First, the theoretical approaches about the urban subject were collected, mainly of the nets and urban hierarchies, as they are fundamental for the function of the urban movements. After that, some considerations about the internal migrations and <b>pendulum</b> <b>movements</b> were made. The methodological research prioritized two points: the analysis of literature and field research developed with the metropolitan bus passengers. For this purpose, it was adopted as criterion for the medium towns, the municipal districts with a population between one thousand to five thousand inhabitants in Brazil. In the results, a socioeconomic profile of the population that uses the metropolitan bus as means of transportation for the commuting between the towns of Cascavel and Toledo was drawn. It was possible to observe that 70, 33 % of the interviewees was employed and that the great majority (58, 75 %) had upper or secondary education levels. Another evidence was that 54. 67 % of the interviewed ones received up to 4 minimum wages as familiar income. Thus, the information related to the commuters to Cascavel-Toledo and Toledo-Cascavel were analyzed, indicating characteristics such as sex, age, education, wage, income, sector of occupation, expended average time in commuting and, also, the frequency of these movements. After the analysis of the commutersâ profile, it was observed that they presented economic factors, such as motivation, to commute and social factors as reasons for not to migrate to the cities they were working. Therefore, such data has evidenced some particular trends and specific uses of the metropolitan bus as an inter-municipal movement. It was confirmed the hypothesis that a flow of commuters between the medium provincial towns of Cascavel and Toledo, such as those presented by the urban trends in the great centers and in the metropolitan regions are occurring in small country towns...|$|R

Using the ankle musculature, subjects balanced a large inverted pendulum. The equilibrium of the pendulum is unstable and quasi-regular sway was observed like that in quiet standing. By giving full attention to minimising sway subjects could systematically reduce <b>pendulum</b> <b>movement.</b> The <b>pendulum</b> position, the torque generated at each ankle and the soleus and tibialis anterior EMGs were recorded. Explanations about how the human inverted pendulum is balanced usually {{ignore the fact that}} balance is maintained over a range of angles and not just at one angle. Any resting equilibrium position of the pendulum is unstable and in practice temporary; movement to a different resting equilibrium position can only be accomplished by a biphasic ‘throw and catch’ pattern of torque and not by an elastic mechanism. Results showed that balance was achieved by the constant repetition of a neurally generated ballistic-like biphasic pattern of torque which can control both position and sway size. A decomposition technique revealed that there was a substantial contribution to changes in torque from intrinsic mechanical ankle stiffness; however, by itself this was insufficient to maintain balance or to control position. Minimisation of sway size was caused by improvement in the accuracy of the anticipatory torque impulses. We hypothesise that examination of centre of mass and centre of pressure data for quiet standing will duplicate these results...|$|R

30|$|The {{inverted}} pendulum is {{the model}} of the most balanced control and the lack of driving control system, which is widely used in teaching and theoretical research. Therefore, for many years, people have been working on the problem of inverted pendulum control in theory and function. The theory of control operation and the method of control will have a great promotion and positive significance for the industrial production. Automatic control is a highly theoretical subject and it is a very important engineering technology. The engineering technology theory mentioned in the literature [1] was “automatic control theory.” In the scope of the improvement of the control theory, it is not feasible to use the theory in reality without proving the correctness of a theory. It is necessary to design the controller according to its theory in order to achieve the true value of the theory [2, 3]. In literature [4], it was pointed out that the inverted pendulum, as a target of experiment, is a system with multiple variables, rapid transformation, nonlinearity, and poor stability. We can add a control algorithm to increase its stability to prove the processing ability of the control method for complex, unstable, and nonlinear systems. At the same time, how this method embodies the difficult problems in a series of automatic control categories, such as robustness, stabilization, and tracking in the process of controlling the system, could also be reflected in the process of controlling the inverted <b>pendulum</b> <b>movement.</b> Therefore, it was concerned by the scientists. Using different control algorithms, different types of inverted pendulum control have become a worldwide research topic with high research value [5, 6].|$|R

40|$|The pendulum, the gap, and the clinic. Leendert Bouman (1869 - 1936) and the ‘psychological turn’ in Dutch {{psychiatry}} In recent historical literature, the Dutch psychiatrist Leendert Bouman (1869 - 1936) {{is named}} ‘the godfather of psychological psychiatry’. He {{is regarded as}} one of the exponents of a shift or ‘pendulum’ movement from a biological-materialistic to a psychological, phenomenological orientation in the Dutch psychiatry of the Interbellum. As a professor of the orthodox calvinist Vrije Universiteit of Amsterdam, he explicitly opposed a ‘soul-less’, biological-reductionist psychiatry. In addition, he played an important part in the introduction and spread of new ‘psychological’ theories and especially Karl Jaspers’ phenomenology in the Netherlands. It is one-sided and misleading, however, to refer to Bouman as a ‘psychological’ psychiatrist. Most of his scientific work was of a neurological and biological nature. He did not see biological (or nomothetic) and psychological (or idiographic) approaches as mutually exclusive, but as necessarily complementary. In this he followed Jaspers’ distinction between and complementary use of the causal connections of psychic life (explanatory psychology) and meaningful psychic connections (psychology of meaning). Boumans pluralist orientation was rooted in his fundamentally clinical attitude toward psychiatry. In his view, a psychiatrist was in the first place a clinician. In the clinic, he stressed, a psychiatrist has to view and examine each individual patient in his bio-psycho-social totality. The case of Bouman illustrates that the history of psychiatry is by far richer and more complicated than is suggested by the standard account of that history being characterized by a <b>pendulum</b> <b>movement</b> and a one-dimensional struggle between ‘somatic’ and ‘psychological’ schools. It also suggests that the interaction between theory and clinical practice should be emphasized as an important dynamic factor in the history of psychiatry – next to or even above the dichotomy between ‘biology’ and ‘psychology’. </p...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{discusses}} {{about the}} dynamic monitoring of stability (tilt measurement) of bearing pillar of high-rise building using the electronic measuring system. The electronic measuring system consists of Libela 2800 tilt sensor, input/output device for the AE 2 DN tilt sensor, measuring amplifier {{and also the}} Spider 8 analog/digital converter and the registration equipment (notebook). The basic part of uniaxial tilt sensor creates a frame, on which is among damping plates hung a pendulum (ferromagnetic kernel). The tilt value is determined on a principle of electromagnetic induction by changing the position of ferromagnetic kernel in the reel. The range of <b>pendulum</b> <b>movement</b> is ± 2, 5 mm/m and {{the accuracy of the}} tilt determination is 0, 001 mm/m. The monitored building represents, from the point of constructional view, a ferro-concrete rectangular sceleton, which consists of vertical bearing pillars, on which are guyed longitudinal and transverse girders. The building ground-plan is rectangular with the dimensions of 75 m (distance) and 12 m (width). The building has two underground and six above the ground floors with constructional high of 3, 40 m. Whole highth of the above ground part of building is 20, 4 m. The pillar tilt was measured in the transverse direction of the building {{at the level of the}} second floor using the Libela 2800 electronic sensor. The sensor was situated on the metallic console (L-profile), which was assembled on a lateral side of the circuit bearing pillar at the highth of 8, 3 m above the ground level. Together with the tilt monitoring, the outside air temperature in the close area of pillar was measured. The tilt measurement was carried out continuously for 168 hours with the recording frequency of 1 Hz (1 measurement/second). The file of the measured data with 603 950 records was reduced to the file with 1006 records, which corresponds to the record of the ever...|$|R
40|$|A parallel-plate system {{collects}} {{data used}} to determine viscosity. A first plate is coupled to a translator so that the first plate can be moved along a first direction. A second plate has a pendulum device coupled thereto such that the second plate is suspended above and parallel to the first plate. The <b>pendulum</b> device constrains <b>movement</b> of the second plate to a second direction that is aligned with the first direction and is substantially parallel thereto. A force measuring device is coupled to the second plate for measuring force along the second direction caused by movement of the second plate...|$|R
