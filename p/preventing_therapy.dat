This study aimed at discussing actions for monitoring, diagnosing and managing adverse effects common to those drugs. CONTENTS:This article addresses diagnosis and management of common opioid adverse effects, as well as abuse and chemical dependence, discussing the frequency of such alterations, the pharmacological and complementary management, risks associated to therapy and most relevant recommendations. CONCLUSION:Several are the effects of acute or chronic opioid administration. A recommended strategy is to monitor, diagnose the occurrence and adequately treat effects {{so that there is}} no damage for patients needing such substances, thus <b>preventing</b> <b>therapy</b> interruption...|$|E
40|$|The {{advent of}} Mycobacterium {{tuberculosis}} strain genotyping has allowed differentiation between disease relapse and exogenous re-infection. We report here a remarkable case of multiply recurrent tuberculosis {{in a patient}} living with HIV. Between 1995 and 2009, a young HIV-infected intravenous drug user, who was reluctant to comply with anti-retroviral treatment, underwent at least five tuberculosis episodes caused by three distinct M. tuberculosis strains sharply differentiated by drug susceptibility profile, genotype and infectious source. Eventually, the patient died during a relapse of tuberculos{{is due to a}} notorious multidrug-resistant outbreak-strain, which infected him during a prolonged hospitalization in the epicentre of such outbreak. Whether recurrent tuberculosis is due to a new infection or to reactivation of a previous one is a century-long controversial question. In our patient, both conditions alternated throughout his 15 years of living with HIV. Cases such as this might not be exceptional in certain underprivileged suburban areas of Argentina and should raise concern over three pending issues in tuberculosis control policies, namely secondary <b>preventing</b> <b>therapy,</b> institutional infection control and patient follow-up throughout the health network system...|$|E
40|$|One of the {{important}} reasons for adverse drug reaction(ADR) is caused by drug abuse which {{is the main reason}} of drug dependence(addiction or habituation). Drug dependence will bring psychological and economical heavy burden to individuals and families. Hong Kong special administrative region have taken multiple methods to reduce drug abuse and get remarkable achievement in past years. Along with Chinese medicine validated in Hong Kong,the role and prospect of Chinese Medicine on prevent and cure drug abuse in Hong Kong will be an important topic and be discussed between experts in fields of Chinese medicine and drug abuse. It rarely occurs that Chinese medicine has drug dependence and some reports showed that Chinese medicines may have effect against drug dependence. How to exert Chinese medicine on prevent and cure of drug abuse in Hong Kong? What is its future? We believe that some work should be done in order to answer the questions: 1. To establish control system for ADR including drug abuse and ADR of combination of Chinese herbs and Western drugs. 2. To integrate Chinese medicine and Western medicine in treating drug abuse and drug dependence. For example,to evaluate drugs such as the effective Chinese herbs(such as Fu kang Tablet) of its effect in treating drug addiction;to exam the different syndrome and individual therapy of TCM in treating drug addiction;to provide <b>preventing</b> <b>therapy</b> according to TCM constitute classification after abstaining from drug addiction. 3.

40|$|Abstract: Alcohol {{dependence}} {{is correlated}} {{with a wide}} spectrum of medical, psychological, behavioral, and social problems. Acute alcohol abuse causes damage to and functional impairment of several organs affecting protein, carbohydrate, and fat metabolism. Mitochondria participate with the conversion of acetaldehyde into acetate and the generation of increased amounts of NADH. Prenatal exposure to ethanol during fetal development induces {{a wide spectrum of}} adverse effects in offspring, such as neurologic abnormalities and pre- and post-natal growth retardation. Antioxidant effects have been described due to that alcoholic beverages contain different compounds, such as polyphenols as well as resveratrol. This review analyzes diverse topics on the alcohol consumption effects in several human organs and demonstrates the direct participation of mitochondria as potential target of compounds {{that can be used to}} <b>prevent</b> <b>therapies</b> for alcohol abusers...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Alcohol abuse {{produces}} damaging {{effects on}} the CNS that leads to several types of disorders. When consumed during pregnancy, alcohol may cause craniofacial malformations, growth retardation and brain damage in offspring. These symptoms are grouped by the term fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS). FAS {{is the most common}} cause of non-genetic mental retardation in the western world. Substantial efforts to elucidate the molecular basis of these impairments are currently in progress. Whereas FAS is totally preventable by avoiding alcohol intake during pregnancy, efficient <b>therapies</b> to <b>prevent</b> or mitigate the effects of prenatal alcohol exposure are still not available but many pharmacological treatments have been developed to avoid alcohol intake and dependence in adults.

40|$|Rituximab is an {{effective}} treatment for CD 20 [*]+[*]B-cell malignancies and autoimmune disorders. However, adverse drug reactions (ADRs) may occur after rituximab infusion, causing, in rare cases, its discontinuation. In this multicenter, retrospective study, among 374 patients treated with rituximab i. v., 23. 5 % experienced ADRs. Mean follow-up was 20. 6 months (range 8 - 135). Overall, ADRs were significantly more frequent in non-Hodgkin lymphomas (NHL) and chronic lymphocytic leukemias (25 - 35. 9 %), than in autoimmune diseases (9. 4 - 17. 5 %) (p[*]<[*]. 0001). Grade 3 - 4 toxicity was observed in eight patients (2. 1 %), and in four of them (1 % of all patients) definitive drug discontinuation was necessary.

40|$|Asymmetric dimethylarginine (ADMA) reduces {{nitric oxide}} (NO), thus causing hypertension. ADMA is metabolized by dimethylarginine dimethylaminohydrolase (DDAH), {{which can be}} {{inhibited}} by oxidative stress. N-Acetylcysteine (NAC), an antioxidant, can facilitate glutathione (GSH) synthesis. We aimed to determine whether NAC can prevent hypertension by regulating the ADMA-DDAH pathway in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR). Rats aged 4 weeks were assigned into 3 groups (n= 8 /group) : control Wistar Kyoto rats (WKY), SHR, and SHR receiving 2 % NAC in drinking water. All rats were sacrificed at 12 weeks of age. SHR had higher blood pressure than WKY, whereas NAC-treated animals did not. SHR had elevated plasma ADMA levels, which was <b>prevented</b> by NAC <b>therapy.</b> SHR had lower renal DDAH activity than WKY, whereas NAC-treated animals did not.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{describe}} fatal {{cases of}} gestational trophoblastic neoplasia (GTN) over four decades and evaluate whether treatment was given {{according to the}} protocol and reveal possible implications for future management. DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study. SETTING: The Netherlands. POPULATION: Women who died from GTN from 1971 to 2011. METHODS: Records from the Dutch Central Registry for Hydatidiform Moles and the Working Party on Trophoblastic Disease were used to identify fatal cases of GTN. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Disease extent, risk classification, treatment regimens and cause of death. RESULTS: Twenty-six women died from GTN. In five cases GTN developed after a hydatidiform mole and in 19 cases following term pregnancy. Half of the women died between 1971 and 1980, when women were not yet classified as having low-risk or high-risk disease and were therefore not yet treated accordingly. A major {{decline in the number}} of deaths was seen after the first decade, with a further decrease from 1981 to 2011. Early death occurred in nine women. In four of these women, death was treatment-related. Women who died more than 4 weeks after the start of treatment mostly died from metastatic tumour (n = 14).

40|$|Septic shock is characterised by vasodilation, {{myocardial}} {{depression and}} impaired microcirculatory blood flow, resulting in redistribution of regional blood flow. Animal and human {{studies have shown}} that gastrointestinal mucosal blood flow is impaired in septic shock. This is consistent with abnormalities found in many other microcirculatory vascular beds. Gastrointestinal mucosal microcirculatory perfusion deficits have been associated with gut injury and a decrease in gut barrier function, possibly causing augmentation of systemic inflammation and distant organ dysfunction. A range of techniques have been developed and used to quantify these gastrointestinal perfusion abnormalities. The following techniques have been used to study gastrointestinal perfusion in humans: tonometry, laser Doppler flowmetry, reflectance spectrophotometry, near-infrared spectroscopy, orthogonal polarisation spectral imaging, indocyanine green clearance, hepatic vein catheterisation and measurements of plasma D-lactate. Although these methods share the ability to predict outcome in septic shock patients, it is important to emphasise that the measurement results are not interchangeable. Different techniques measure different elements of gastrointestinal perfusion. Gastric tonometry is currently the most widely used technique because of its non-invasiveness and ease of use. Despite all the recent advances, the usefulness of gastrointestinal perfusion parameters in clinical decision-making is still limited. Treatment strategies specifically aimed at improving gastrointestinal perfuision have failed to actually correct mucosal perfusion abnormalities and hence not shown to improve important clinical endpoints. Current and future treatment strategies for septic shock should be tested for their effects on gastrointestinal perfusion; to further clarify its exact role in patient management, and to <b>prevent</b> <b>therapies</b> detrimental to gastrointestinal perfusion being implemented...|$|R
