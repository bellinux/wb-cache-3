5|$|Delayed gratification, or {{deferred}} gratification, is {{the ability}} to resist the temptation for an immediate reward and wait for a later reward. Generally, delayed gratification is associated with resisting a smaller but more immediate reward in order to receive a larger or more enduring reward later. A growing body of literature has linked the ability to delay gratification to a host of other <b>positive</b> <b>outcomes,</b> including academic success, physical health, psychological health, and social competence.|$|E

The increased efforts in the areas of taxation and maintenance of the military forces made possible the <b>positive</b> <b>outcomes</b> of some of the armed conflicts that took place during Sigismund's reign.|$|E
5|$|Each {{of these}} <b>positive</b> <b>outcomes</b> {{requires}} some ability to forgo short-term reward {{in favor of}} a higher payoff in the future. The ability to delay gratification also appears to be a buffer against rejection sensitivity (the tendency to be anxious when anticipating interpersonal rejection). In a 20-year follow-up of the marshmallow experiment, individuals with vulnerability to high rejection sensitivity who had shown strong delay of gratification abilities as preschoolers had higher self-esteem and self-worth and more adaptive coping skills, in comparison to the individuals who had high rejection sensitivity but low delay of gratification as four-year-olds. These compelling longitudinal findings converge with other studies showing a similar pattern: The ability to resist temptation early in life translates to persistent benefits across settings.|$|E

Chi square test and descriptive analysis were conducted. A total of 237 trials were included. Out of 188 pharmacotherapy trials, 164 (88 %) reported a <b>positive</b> <b>outcome.</b> Out of 49 psychotherapy trials, 44 (90 %) reported a <b>positive</b> <b>outcome.</b> The difference between above reported population was not statistically significant on chi-square test (p= 0. 626).

40|$|The {{present study}} {{examined}} the role of <b>positive</b> <b>outcome</b> expectancy {{in the relationship between}} peer/parental influence and Internet gaming addiction (IGA) among adolescents in Taiwan. Two thousand, one hundred and four junior high students completed the Chen Internet Addiction Scale for IGA, Parental Influence for IGA, peer influence for IGA, and <b>Positive</b> <b>Outcome</b> Expectancy of Internet Gaming Questionnaire. Results showed that the three types of peer influences (positive attitudes toward Internet gaming, frequency of Internet game use, and invitation to play) and <b>positive</b> <b>outcome</b> expectancy were significantly and positively correlated with IGA. Moreover, peer influence was also positively correlated with <b>positive</b> <b>outcome</b> expectancy. On the other hand, <b>positive</b> <b>outcome</b> expectancy and parental influences had a low correlation. Structural equation modeling analysis revealed that <b>positive</b> <b>outcome</b> expectancy did not mediate the relationship between either type of parental influences and IGA, and only the parent 2 ̆ 7 s invitation to play Internet games directly predicted IGA severity. However, peers 2 ̆ 7 positive attitude or the frequency of peers 2 ̆ 7 Internet game use positively predicted IGA and was fully mediated through <b>positive</b> <b>outcome</b> expectancy of Internet gaming. In addition, the frequency of peers 2 ̆ 7 invitation to play Internet games directly and indirectly predicted IGA severity through a partial mediation of <b>positive</b> <b>outcome</b> expectancy of Internet gaming. The overall fit of the model was adequate and was able to explain 25. 0 percent of the variance. The findings provide evidence in illuminating the role of peer influences and <b>positive</b> <b>outcome</b> expectancy of Internet gaming in the process of why adolescents may develop IGA...|$|R

40|$|Personality and {{cognitive}} processes are both related to alcohol use and misuse. A recent model of hazardous drinking referred, the 2 -CARS model, postulates two major pathways to hazardous drinking. One pathway primarily involves {{the association between}} Reward Drive and <b>Positive</b> <b>Outcome</b> Expectancies, the second involves the association between Rash Impulsiveness and Drinking Refusal Self-Efficacy. In previous tests of the model, Drinking Refusal Self-Efficacy {{was found to have}} the most proximal impact on drinking, being directly influenced by Rash Impulsiveness, and indirectly influenced by Reward Drive through <b>Positive</b> <b>Outcome</b> Expectancies. The aim of the current study was to test the 2 -CARS model in a larger independent sample. Results found that individuals with a strong Reward Drive showed higher <b>Positive</b> <b>Outcome</b> Expectancies, while individuals high in Rash Impulsiveness {{were more likely to report}} reduced Drinking Refusal Self-Efficacy. The present results also showed a theoretically unexpected pathway with a direct association between Rash Impulsiveness and <b>Positive</b> <b>Outcome</b> Expectancies. However, overall the results support the view that a greater understanding of hazardous drinking can be achieved by investigating the relationship between these personality {{and cognitive}} variables.

These expectations are, for the most part, illusory. In order to counteract these expectations, we designed cigarette package warning labels that contradicted common <b>positive</b> <b>outcome</b> expectancies. We investigated the effectiveness of our new warning labels in two experiments. We first measured smokers' implicit attitudes toward smoking using an affective priming method and found that our new warning labels changed positive attitudes into ambivalent attitudes. We then tested whether our warning labels changed smokers' self-reported <b>positive</b> <b>outcome</b> expectancies and smoking behavior. Smokers presented with the new warning labels immediately associated <b>positive</b> <b>outcome</b> expectancies less strongly with smoking and reported smoking fewer cigarettes in the 24 hours following the experiment.
