5000|$|<b>Psychonomics</b> {{describes}} {{an approach to}} psychology that aims at discovering the laws (Greek: 'nomos') that govern {{the workings of the}} mind (Greek: 'psyche'). The field is directly related to experimental psychology. The word is used most prominently by the Psychonomic Society, a society of experimental psychologists in the United States and around the world.|$|E
5000|$|The Psychonomic Society {{is one of}} {{the primary}} {{societies}} for general scientific experimental psychology in the United States. It is open to international researchers, and almost 40% of members are based outside of North America. Although open to all areas of experimental and cognitive psychology, its members typically study areas such as learning, memory, attention, motivation, perception, categorization, decision making, and psycholinguistics. Its name is taken from the word <b>psychonomics,</b> meaning [...] "the science of the laws of the mind".|$|E

40|$|The {{arbitrary}} mapping hypothesis {{assumes that}} age-of-acquisition (AoA) effects on oral reading {{depend on whether}} phonology can be predicted from orthography. One prediction that follows is that AoA effects will be larger for written words with inconsistent rime spellings than for written words with consistent rime spellings. An alternative hypothesis is that AoA effects on oral reading depend on the family resemblance between lexical items that share orthography-to-phonology mappings. The results from a multiple regression study show {{that the effects of}} written AoA on oral reading interact with the number of words containing the rime. Specifically, written AoA has a larger effect on the oral reading of consistent words with few family members than on that of inconsistent words with many family members. The conclusion from these results is that a binary distinction between predictable and unpredictable mappings is not sufficient to explain effects of written AoA on oral reading.

40|$|Research has {{identified}} a pupil old/new effect: Our pupils dilate {{to a greater}} extent when we are presented with previously studied (old) items, as compared with new items. It is not yet clear what specific memory processes give rise to this effect. Using the remember–know procedure, we found that the effect was greater for items that were consciously recollected, as opposed to those that were known. We replicated the effect for auditory stimuli, ruling out any explanation of the effect based purely on visual processing. In addition, the pupil old/new effect was greatest for items that were initially encoded with a semantic orienting instruction, as compared with those encoded with a more surface orienting instruction. Using a modified Deese/Roediger–McDermott task, pupil size also increased when participants made false old responses. We conclude that the pupil old/new effect reflects a combined strength of memory signal. The 50 th Annual Meeting of the <b>Psychonomics</b> Society, Boston, MA., 19 - 22 November 2009.

40|$|In 2012 the Psychonomic Society adopted new {{guidelines}} on statistical issues. We examined {{all of the}} empirical papers published in the Society’s journals in 2013 to discover how much needs to change to meet the guidelines. The Guidelines call for authors to consider statistical power and sample size, but only a tiny proportion of papers did so. The Guidelines {{emphasize the importance of}} reporting appropriate measures of variability “e. g., confidence intervals around means and/or around standardized effect sizes”, but the reporting of variability was patchy. Nearly half the papers failed to report effect sizes and almost none discussed them. Effect size estimates were mostly limited to partial eta squared and Cohen’s d, rather than population estimates.

40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{longitudinal}} {{study was to investigate}} differences in interests, personality, and cognitive abilities between students majoring in the six specialties of psychology at the University of Amsterdam. Results show that students at Social Psychology and Work and Organizational Psychology were on average more extraverted than students of other specializations, that students of Psychological Methods and <b>Psychonomics</b> were relatively more open to experience, and that students at Clinical Psychology were on average more neurotic. Differences in cognitive ability were small, but significant, with the highest scores among students of the more research-oriented specialties. With discriminant analyses on the basis of nine interest scales, 53 % of the students were correctly categorized in the specialization chosen two or years after interests were measured. Interest profiles of the specialties follow differences in interest in helping people, abstract vs. concrete topics, and technical issues.

40|$|The {{most crucial}} {{aspect of a}} building's safety {{in the face of}} fire is the {{possibility}} of safe escape. An important precondition is that its fire safety facilities enable independent and adequate fire response performances by the building's occupants. In practice, it appears that the measures currently required by law do not always provide the support that people in burning buildings need. Consequently, understanding how individuals behave in the case of fire and fire evacuation is essential if we are to bring fire safety measures into line with occupants' needs during an incident. This paper contains a review of the available literature on human behaviour in a fire so far as building safety is concerned. The findings are presented as an overview of the critical factors which determine occupants' fire response performances, namely the characteristics of fire, human beings and buildings. The study highlights that some of the assumptions about the existing paradigm of fire safety in buildings are not consistent with the knowledge set out in the literature. The key observation is that <b>psychonomics</b> appear to have significant influence on occupants' fire response performances. Accordingly, the traditional approach to fire safety will have to be supplemented by scientific knowledge from this field. Hence, {{there is a need for}} a new approach to fire safety design in buildings, which is set out herein. © 2009 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|E
40|$|Interval {{estimates}} – {{estimates of}} parameters that include an allowance for sampling uncertainty – {{have long been}} touted as {{a key component of}} statistical analyses. There are several kinds of interval estimates, but the most popular are confidence intervals (CIs) : intervals that contain the true parameter value in some known proportion of repeated samples, on average. The width of confidence intervals is thought to index the precision of an estimate; the parameter values contained within a CI are thought to be more plausible than those outside the interval; and the confidence coefficient of the interval (typically 95 %) is thought to index the plausibility that the true parameter is included in the interval. We show in a number of examples that CIs do not necessarily have any of these properties, and generally lead to incoherent inferences. For this reason, we recommend against the use of the method of CIs for inference. “You keep using that word. I do not think it means what you think it means. ” Inigo Montoya, The Princess Bride (1987) The development of statistics over the past century has seen the proliferation of methods designed to make infer-ences from data. Methods vary widely in their philosophical foundations, the questions they are supposed to address, and their frequency of use in practice. One popular and widely-promoted class of methods are interval estimates, which in-clude frequentist confidence intervals, Bayesian credible in-tervals and highest posterior density (HPD) intervals, fiducial intervals, and likelihood intervals. These procedures differ in their philosophical foundation and computation, but infor-mally are all designed to be estimates of a parameter that ac-count for measurement or sampling uncertainty by yielding a range of values for the parameter instead of a single value. Of the many kinds of interval estimates, the most popular is the confidence interval (CI). Confidence intervals are intro-duced in almost all introductory statistics texts; they are rec-ommended or required by the methodological guidelines of many prominent journals (e. g., <b>Psychonomics</b> Society, 2012...|$|E
40|$|Visual probe tasks {{continue}} to show promise {{as a tool}} with which to clarify biases in selective attention to threat in child and adolescent anxiety. Research to date has revealed considerable evidence of greater vigilance to lexical and pictorial threat (e. g. affective images and emotional facial expressions) in anxious children, with evidence of avoidance more likely in children who have experienced extreme levels of threat (physical abuse) and/or are tested in potentially anxiogenic environments [i. e. withinmagnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scanner]. While evidence in anxious children is broadly consistent with findings in adult samples and appears consistent with predictions from cognitive models of threat processing in anxiety, future studies need to clarify the development, component processes and time course of attentional bias in child and adolescent populations. To this end, studies in children should me mindful of developments in the adult literature, particularly regarding the <b>psychonomics</b> of visual probe indices of selective attention. Mechanisms that underlie the development and regulation of attentional bias to threat throughout childhood remain unclear, and longitudinal studies are necessary to test predictions from original developmental models and extend promising initial evidence that supports verbal learning pathways to cognitive bias. In doing so, interactions between environmental and genetic risk factors that modulate neural and cognitive mechanisms that underlie bias in selective attention should be explored. The clinical utility of attention retraining techniques for child and adolescent anxiety {{has yet to be}} realized; however, evidence from visual probe training paradigms in adult anxiety and initial findings in children identify attentional bias as a mechanism through which anxiety may emerge and resolve. Convergent evidence from concurrent eye tracking and event-related potentials will help clarify the time course of attention allocation to threat in children, particularly younger children forwhommanualRTdata alonemay prove insensitive to individual differences, while continued integration of visual probe paradigms with functional imaging (e. g. fMRI) techniques will further delineate the neural structures and functional connectivity involved in the activation and control of selective attention to threat. This data should inform recent connectionist network models of attentional bias within visual probe tasks (e. g. Frewen et al., 2008) with a view to providing biologically plausible dynamic models of selective attention to threat and its developmen...|$|E
