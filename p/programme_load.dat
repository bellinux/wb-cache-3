40|$|BACKGROUND: In high-income countries, viral load is {{routinely}} measured to detect failure of antiretroviral therapy (ART) and guide switching to second-line ART. Viral load monitoring is not generally available in resource-limited settings. We examined switching from nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI) -based first-line regimens to protease inhibitor-based regimens in Africa, South America and Asia. DESIGN AND METHODS: Multicohort study of 17 ART programmes. All sites monitored CD 4 cell count and {{had access to}} second-line ART and 10 sites monitored viral load. We compared times to switching, CD 4 cell counts at switching and obtained adjusted hazard ratios for switching (aHRs) with 95 % confidence intervals (CIs) from random-effects Weibull models. RESULTS: A total of 20 113 patients, including 6369 (31. 7 %) patients from 10 programmes with access to viral load monitoring, were analysed; 576 patients (2. 9 %) switched. Low CD 4 cell counts at ART initiation were associated with switching in all programmes. Median time to switching was 16. 3 months [interquartile range (IQR) 10. 1 - 26. 6] in <b>programmes</b> with viral <b>load</b> monitoring and 21. 8 months (IQR 14. 0 - 21. 8) in <b>programmes</b> without viral <b>load</b> monitoring (P < 0. 001). Median CD 4 cell counts at switching were 161 cells/microl (IQR 77 - 265) in <b>programmes</b> with viral <b>load</b> monitoring and 102 cells/microl (44 - 181) in <b>programmes</b> without viral <b>load</b> monitoring (P < 0. 001). Switching was more common in <b>programmes</b> with viral <b>load</b> monitoring during months 7 - 18 after starting ART (aHR 1. 38; 95 % CI 0. 97 - 1. 98), similar during months 19 - 30 (aHR 0. 97; 95 % CI 0. 58 - 1. 60) and less common during months 31 - 42 (aHR 0. 29; 95 % CI 0. 11 - 0. 79).

40|$|Abstract — Robotics and {{automation}} engrosses {{designing and}} implementation of prodigious machines which {{has the potential to}} do work too tedious, too precise, and too dangerous for human to perform. It also pushes the boundary on the level of intelligence and competence for many forms of autonomous, semi- autonomous and tele-operated machines. Intelligent machines have assorted applications in medicine, defence, space, under water exploration, disaster relief, manufacture, assembly, home automation and entertainment. Prime motive behind this project is to design and implement in hardware, a mobile controlled robotic system for maneuvering DC motors and remotely controlling the electric appliances. Mobile platform is to be {{in the form of a}} robot capable of standard locomotion in all directions. The robot can be operated in two ways; either by a call made to the mobile phone mounted on the robot or by communication with a computer through a wireless module. Signals from the receiver mobile phone are transformed into digital outputs with the assistance of a decoder. Microcontroller processes these decoded outputs and generates required signal to drive the DC motors. Outputs from the microcontroller are processed by the motor driver to get sufficient current for smooth driving of DC motors and electronic equipments. Consequently, motion of the robot can be regulated and the electric appliances can be controlled from a remote locality. Various levels of automation can be attributed to the robot by suitably modifying the <b>programme</b> <b>loaded</b> on the microcontroller chip...|$|R

The bridge {{is located in a}} zone of high seismic activity. The rock slopes are composed of a heavily jointed rock mass and the spacing, dip and dip direction of joint sets are varying at different locations. Geological mapping was carried out to characterize all discontinuities present along the slopes. Laboratory and field investigations were conducted to assess the geotechnical properties of the intact rock, rock mass and joint infill. Stability analyses of these rock slopes were carried out using numerical <b>programmes.</b> <b>Loads</b> from the foundations resting on the slopes and seismic accelerations estimated from site-specific ground response analysis were considered. The proposed slope profile with several berms between successive foundations was simulated in the numerical model. An equivalent continuum approach with Hoek and Brown failure criterion was initially used in a finite element model to assess the global stability of the slope abutments. In the second stage, finite element analysis of rock slopes with all joint sets with their orientations, spacing and properties explicitly incorporated into the numerical model was taken up using continuum with joints approach. It was observed that the continuum with joints approach was able to capture the local failures in some of the slope sections, which were verified using wedge failure analysis and stereographic projections. Based on the slope deformations and failure patterns observed from the numerical analyses, rock anchors were designed to achieve the target factors of safety against failure while keeping the deformations within the permissible limits.

We will also determine the safety and acceptability of each exercise training mode. Intervention group responses will be compared with those of a self-selected, non-randomised control sample of sex-matched and age-matched men who will follow their usual lifestyle activities for 8 [*]months. Methods and analysis: Apparently healthy men over 50 years with low bone mass, screened for medical conditions and medications known to adversely affect bone health, will be recruited. Eligible participants will be randomly allocated to 8 [*]months of either exercise programme with block randomisation based on presence or absence of osteoporosis medications. A twice-weekly, 30 -minute, supervised exercise programme will be conducted for both groups. The primary outcome will be change in femoral neck areal bone mineral density determined by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA). Secondary outcomes, assessed at baseline and 8 [*]months, will include: DXA-derived whole-body, bilateral proximal femur and lumbar spine areal bone mineral density; proximal femur bone geometry and volumetric density extracted using three-dimensional hip analysis software; anthropometry; body composition; kyphosis; vertebral fracture assessment; physical function; safety (adverse events and injuries); and compliance.

The influence of microstructure evolution on the elastoplastic response of the material is analysed. A brief introduction to the self-consistent modelling is presented. The comparison of the numerical results with the experimental data available from literature reveals a good agreement between the calculated and measured evolution of yield surface. From the three parameters describing the internal structure of the material, the grain shape evolution is neglected in this study. The remaining two are internal stresses and crystallographic texture. The influence of these parameters on subsequent yield surfaces is analysed. When compared with the second-order residual stresses, the role of crystallographic texture in hardening of polycrystals appears to be insignificant.

40|$|The {{deployment}} of new communication services is currently restricted by slow standardisation, {{the difficulties of}} adding new capabilities to existing equipment, and {{the complexity of the}} existing network. It has been proposed [1] that these difficulties could be overcome by adding programmes to packet headers which are intended to run on network devices the packet encounters. However service operators will never permit third party programmes to run on their equipment without prior testing, and a strong guarantee that the programme will not degrade performance for other users. Since it will be extremely hard to create interesting programmes, in a language which is simple enough to enable termination guarantees, we regard this approach as unrealistic. A somewhat different flavour of active networking in which the packets do not carry programmes, but flags indicating the desirability of running a programme has also been proposed [2]. This would enable the service operator to choose a <b>programme</b> to <b>load,</b> which matches the indicated need, but is sourced from his own database of tested programmes. We believe that this second approach may be valuable in the long term, however in order not to degrade router performance the number of flags will need to be small and the number of possible programmes will thus also be small. In addition it will not resolve the immediate need for increased flexibility, as it will require standardisation, and will thus take time. We therefore propose a third alternative, which we call application layer networking [3]. In this system the network is populated with application level entities we refer to as service nodes, or dynamic proxy servers. These could be thought of as equivalent to th...|$|R
