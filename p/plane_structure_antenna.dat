40|$|In {{wireless}} communication systems, multipath interference {{has a significant}} impact on system design and performance. Fast fading is caused by the coherent summation of one or more echoes from many reflection points reaching the receive antenna. Antenna diversity can be used to mitigate multipath fading. The main challenge of antenna diversity in practical application is the integration of multiple antennas on a small ground <b>plane.</b> Two-element <b>antenna</b> <b>structure</b> based on coupling element antenna concept for diversity application has been studied in previous work and it has shown to be feasible for low frequency diversity application with stable and low envelope correlation across wide frequency range.

The envelope correlation is less than 0. 1 and the diversity gain is equal to 10. 2 dB at 99 % reliability level using selection combining technique across simulation and both measurement methods.

In comparison with traditional rigid antennas, membrane antennas can easily achieve larger scale with lighter weight, smaller stowage volume, and lower cost. At present, {{there are two}} main kinds of space-borne membrane antenna structures: parabolic and planar membrane <b>antenna</b> <b>structures.</b> These membrane <b>antenna</b> <b>structures</b> generally involve a membrane surface, support structures, and a tensioning system. Since 1970, a series of explorations of membrane antennas have been carried out in the United States, Europe, Japan, etc. Some progress has also been made in this domain over the past 10 years in China. However, up until now, no membrane antennas have been applied in space, except an American inflatable antenna with a diameter of 14 m that had space flight experience in 1996. It is obvious that applications of large membrane antennas in space still face many difficulties and challenges. In order to promote membrane antenna progress, it is necessary to review the development of deployable membrane <b>antenna</b> <b>structures</b> and provide guidance for space membrane-antenna researchers. Creative design and analysis of some deployable structures and mechanisms were presented in Refs. [1 – 11], but deployable membrane <b>antenna</b> <b>structures</b> were not considered.
