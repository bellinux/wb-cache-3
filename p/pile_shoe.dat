Some of the about 18,000 coins originate from the Eastern Gaul, others are of the Zürich type, that were assigned to the local Helvetii, and date to around 100 BC. The find is so far unique, and the scientific research assumes that the melting down of the lumps was not completed, therefore the aim was to form cultic offerings.

50|$|The lead pile {{section is}} fitted with an {{appropriate}} <b>pile</b> driving <b>shoe.</b> For friction <b>piles</b> {{this is a}} conical grout point and for end bearing piles it a standard driving shoe or end plug. In normal unobstructed soils a flat shoe is used to form an end plug. For soils that contain obstructions {{that are to be}} penetrated a steel end plug with a rock point may be considered. The piles can also be driven with an open end. When driven in this manner, approximately 1.5 m of the lead section will be filled with soil during driving.The end plug seals the pile against water and soil infiltration into the pile. With the base sealed the grout can be used to provide additional structural capacity and limits the corrosion exposure to the outside face of the pile.For friction grouted piles a patented conical grout shoe is fitted onto the lead section.|$|R

40|$|Shoes, {{like other}} objects, can {{illuminate}} {{specific aspects of}} the past. Through their survival, and material appearance – their texture, weight and design, they can convey abstract historical concepts, and also by their human associations and suggestions of physicality. For example, consider {{the images of the}} <b>piles</b> of <b>shoes</b> belonging to the millions of Jews killed in concentration camps. How powerfully the humble mismatched shoes stand for the presence of persons whose dignity and humanity have been erased. But a shoe produced and worn at a specific time also embodies the values, ideals and aesthetic choices of an era. Shoes can tell us a lot about an individual, but they also convey messages that are understood across society: high heels stand for an exaggerated femininity; red shoes for pleasure and desire; and sneakers for modern pace in the city, leisure and relaxation. The story of shoes in the longue durée is characterized by themes of morality, mobility and extremism as we shall see...|$|R

On the other day, 8 December, she was also removed from the ghetto and was forced to march with thousands of others to Rumbula. However, she escaped being murdered by throwing herself into the snow when approaching the site of the massacre. She then pretended to be dead.

Akhavan has exhibited work at the Western Front in Vancouver, the Delfina Foundation in London, the Bergen Museum in Norway, and ABC Art Berlin Contemporary. Kathleen Ritter writes about his site-specific audio project Landscape: for the birds at the Vancouver Art Gallery in 2009: [...] "an extension of Akhavan's previous projects, where he has, for example, places a <b>pile</b> of <b>shoes</b> {{at the foot of a}} gallery's door, hung a white sheet from a gallery's window, planted a live wall of hedges inside gallery and blocked off a gallery's entrance with a wall of sandbags resembling a military blockade. The installations reinterpret the gallery entrance as a site of special significance , drawing attention to the threshold between expected and unexpected sites of cultural activity.".

Simply {{a pile of}} decaying leather <b>shoes</b> <b>piled</b> against a bare, gray concrete wall the exhibit relies heavily on the emotional, sensory response the viewer will naturally through this use metonymic technique. This exhibition design intentionally signifies metonymically the nameless and victims themselves. This metaphysical link to the victims through the deteriorating and aged shoes stands as a surviving vestige of the individual victim. This technique, employed properly, {{can be a very}} powerful one as it plays off the real life experiences of the viewer while evoking the equally unique memory of the victim. Metonymy, however, Jennifer Hansen-Glucklich argues, is not without its own problems. Hansen-Glucklich explains, [...] "...when victims' possessions are collected according to type and displayed en masse they stand metonymically for the victims themselves ... Such a use of metonymy contributes to the dehumanization of the victims as they are reduced to a heap of indistinguishable objects and their individuality subsumed by an aesthetic of anonymity and excess." ...|$|R
40|$|Anderson {{created a}} series of four 5 -minute films {{exploring}} abstract journeys {{as part of a}} more substantial branded window display. The installed films varied in content and function. The first film was of a man using an industrial guillotine to cut up <b>piles</b> of training <b>shoes.</b> Anderson reinvents the brand as a postmodernist homage to the product’s history. This theme carries through to other product developments including the design of plastic and sticker coded bags to house the sliced shoes which were then displayed on a large-scale as part of the Puma Covent Garden store launch. This approach led to a second film which instructed the onlooker how, by putting together the codes to form words such as ter-rain, spr-int gra-vel can-ter combined with numbers 1 - 14 (1 being the toe of the shoe 14 the heel), one could build and invent new shoes and new styles. Both informational and instructional structure breaks with conventional film narratives. The other two films are based around the theme of an abstract journey - one in particular was projected onto the floor creating an optical illusion of a moving terrain changing floor with a 500 -metre drop in the middle. The films formed part of the window installation made out of a wall of trainers - selected colour placements were designed to make an anti-nationalist statement. This referenced positively the way in which people form non-geographical nations, grouped around particular interests, hobbies or fashions. The result was a large flag that filled the entire window space, creating a ‘Puma sports nation’. The shoes were later cut up and recycled into new artwork for the Puma concept store launch...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Accumulation {{of matter}} {{is one of}} the most {{recognizable}} signs of poverty. The poor lives close to the earth, this is his only property and he will use it to build his shelters, his rooms, or his utensils. The clay or mud constructions, moulded with a great amount of material, are found in primitive villages, but any situation of extreme poverty tends to be associated with an accumulation of matter whatever its origin. A situation of poverty not related with the accumulation of matter seems inconceivable and this is particularly evident in our developed societies, where a beggar is recognized in any street by his <b>pile</b> of clothes, <b>shoes,</b> and any sort of personal property. It is a significant fact that many intellectual discourses on modernity identify the concept of modernity with that of a classless society and that, at the same time, they invoke poverty as a distinct mark of the new man. This new poverty is sober and cold as human habitation is open and transparent, almost naked, and it is equal for any man whatever his social strata. In this way, modern poverty is tied to material, to the new materials, but it is a chosen condition, nor an imposed one, or at least it is accepted as inevitable by the new man. Both accumulative poverty and ascetic poverty coexist in the discourses and works of 20 th century avant-gardes. And in some contemporary works, we find either an accumulation of shapeless and hand-worked matter or an exhibition of bare and cold materials industrially produced. In both cases, poverty is invoked as the ultimate reference for those works, intended to be a true expression of their epoch.

5000|$|She related her {{experience}} at Belsen to the BBC in 2001: [...] "I didn't {{go at the}} very beginning - I wasn't there at its liberation which was quite horrific and which we know well from our screens and from testimonies. I went there some months later after camp one, which we saw on the screens, had been burnt down. It had been burnt because of typhus and raging disease. ... By the time I got there, there were mounds - people had been buried in great numbers in ditches. But the survivors, the displaced persons, as they then became called, were herded into what had been the German Panzer Division's barracks. These were stone, very dour, very dark and cold buildings in which people lived many to a room without any facilities. She recounts, [...] "saw [...] awful sights, amputees, gangrene, festering sores. People still looked terribly emaciated … sometimes when you were searching through things you were reminded of the enormity of it: once we came across a vast <b>pile</b> of <b>shoes,</b> sorted according to sizes, including children’s, all neatly lined up; you were never safe from that kind of confrontation. She said that survivors [...] "would dig their fingers into your arms and hold on to you to get to you the horror of what had happened. Above all else, there was a need to tell you everything, {{over and over and over}} again. And this was the most significant thing for me, realizing that you had to take it all." [...] She spoke of what she thought of as her essential role: [...] "After a while I began to realise the most important role for me there was to bear witness. Bearing witness to the vulnerability of humanity." [...] "Their's wasn’t so much grief as a pouring out of some ghastly vomit like a kind of horror.” [...] She described her work by saying, [...] "Sometimes I found it necessary to say to people who I knew were not going to live: 'You are giving me your testimony and I will hold it for you and I will honour it and I will bear witness to what has happened to you.'" [...] Part of her motivation for her journey to Belsen was about overcoming her own fears: [...] "I felt I had to face something, the fear in myself. I had to understand other people's fear, and I had to understand something about overcoming fear - living. How does one live with the knowledge of atrocity?" [...] She remained in Germany for two and a half years, negotiating the evacuation to Switzerland of a group of young survivors suffering from tuberculosis.|$|R
