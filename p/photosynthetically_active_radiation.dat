25|$|Primary {{production}} from phytoplankton {{is a function}} of two different factors: growth rates and accumulation (Fig. 1). Although the LSZ is a sink for high concentrations of nutrients from urban and agricultural sources, phytoplankton production rates are quite low. Nitrate is optimally used by phytoplankton for growth, but ammonium (largely derived from sewage outfalls) has a suppressive effect on growth rate. Thus, while not nutrient limited, phytoplankton tend to grow more slowly due to the kinds of nitrogen present. Another suppressive factor on growth rate is the high turbidity of the estuary, which limits the ability of <b>photosynthetically</b> <b>active</b> <b>radiation</b> (PAR) to penetrate beyond the top few centimeters of the water column. This limits phytoplankton photosynthesis to a relatively shallow photic zone. Thus, when the water column is stratified, turbidity is high, and ammonium is present, the growth rate of phytoplankton is typically suppressed.|$|E

This study aimed at investigating to what extent soil nitrogen capture in interaction with light availability drives the early establishment of competition between oak (Quercus petraea (Matt.)

Two-year-old oak was grown in 20 l pots, alone or in combination with Molinia, for two levels of light availability (11 and 55 % of incident <b>photosynthetically</b> <b>active</b> <b>radiations)</b> in a greenhouse. Leaf photosynthesis measurements and soil 15 N-labelling were used to monitor changes in carbon assimilation and soil nitrogen uptake between and within species under well-watered conditions. Presence of Molinia hadno significant effect on short-term oak seedling growthregardless of the light availability. However, increase in incident light resulted in the rise of both nitrogen uptake and photosynthesis capacityin Molinia. Meanwhile, N taken up by oak grown with Molinia under unshaded environment hardly changed but photosynthesis capacity strongly decreased when compared to shady conditions. In conclusion, these results pointed out a short-term response of photosynthesis and N capture in mixture of Molinia – oak seedlings in unshaded conditions (i. e. after forest canopy opening), which might partly result from a larger nitrogen capture by Molinia...|$|R

We compared the effects of a light-diffusing plastic film and a clear plastic film on growth of Batavia lettuce (Lactuca sativa L.) in two greenhouses during five growth periods. Lettuce grown under the light-diffusing film were smaller (up to 36 %) than control plants grown under the clear film, due to the fewer leaves per plant (up to 22 %) and lower mean values of individual leaf area (up to 29 %). The <b>photosynthetically</b> <b>active</b> <b>radiations</b> use efficiency was sometimes lower (up to 23 %) in lettuces grown under the light-diffusing film. The pigment contents tended to be lower in plants grown under the light-diffusing plastic. The total macroelement contents of the lettuces grown under the light-diffusing plastic were up to 10 % higher than in the lettuces grown under clear plastic, mainly {{as a result of}} higher leaf K contents (up to 19 % higher).

The experiment was conducted in a greenhouse, using a completely randomized experimental design, in a uniform scheme composed of 10 evaluation times (from 8 am to 5 pm, with an interval of 1 h between evaluations) and three replications. Each replicate consisted of three evaluation plants, totaling nine seedlings, which were arranged on a double border. The following characteristics were evaluated: leaf temperature (ºC), <b>photosynthetically</b> <b>active</b> solar <b>radiation</b> ((mol S- 1 m- 2), stomatal resistance (S cm- 1), and transpiration (mmol H 2 O s- 1 m- 2) over a typical day, using a LI- 1600 LI-COR digital porometer. The temperature and relative humidity were measured inside the greenhouse, using a thermohygrograph. The evaluations were performed at 244 days after sowing, between 8 : 00 and 17 : 00, with an interval of 60 minutes, totaling 10 evaluations.

40|$|Light {{interception}} is a {{major contributor}} to biomass accumulation of crops. Beer's law has been extensively used to estimate the amount of light intercepted by a plant at canopy level. This method, based {{on the use of the}} leaf area index (LAI), is designed for well-developed crops where the canopy is assumed to be a turbid medium (Jones, 1992). However this assumption is seldom verified and in most situations canopies are strongly heterogeneous, as for example in perennial crops such as vineyards and orchards (e. g. Louarn et al., 2007) or in row crops during the first developmental stages or when leaf senescence occurs. We propose here to test a method based on 3 D modelling to quantify the local light environment of plants in different situations, including artificial conditions. 3 D virtual plants built from architectural measurements (Barczi JF et al., 1997) were used with a radiative balance model (Dauzat and Eroy, 1997) to characterise plant-environment interactions. A multi-directional approach was chosen to take into account direct and diffuse <b>photosynthetically</b> <b>active</b> <b>radiations</b> (PAR) which have a major influence on the plant radiative balance. Under natural conditions, when there was no obstacle to light, the direct-diffuse PAR ratio was derived from a single measurement of solar radiation above the canopy. In artificial conditions such as growth chambers or greenhouses, because of the presence of various occulting and reflecting materials and artificial light supplies, this ratio is more difficult to estimate. PAR sensors were specifically designed to measure the directional radiations received by plants in such environments. The effective radiation climate was mimicked by different virtual light sources whose characteristics were estimated from the directional measurements. The method was tested in sunflower and in the rosette of Arabidopsis thaliana, in canopy or isolated plants, from plant germination to the end of the vegetative period (Fig. 1). Experiments were carried out in natural (field), semi-controlled (greenhouse) and totally artificial (growth chamber) light environments. Various light levels were imposed and different genotypes were used to test the model relevance to environmental and genetic variations in the plant architecture. This approach was evaluated using measurements on light interception efficiency (Fig. 2) and it was compared to classical approaches (Beer's law for sunflower; leaf area x incident PAR for Arabidopsis) in the different situations. The model was particularly relevant to quantify light interception for crops in early growth stages, isolated plants or artificial environments. It was also able to characterise the local environment of different genotypes and to quantify the impact of architectural modifications on light interception. This 3 D virtual plant approach is proposed as a tool to analyse the genotype-environment interactions and identify new selection criteria to improve light interception which is directly related to biomass production and yield...|$|R
40|$|Terrestrial plant {{productivity}} tends to increase under increasing but non-saturating <b>photosynthetically</b> <b>active</b> solar <b>radiation</b> when water, temperature and nutrients are not limiting. However, {{studies have shown}} that photosynthesis can also be higher under enhanced diffuse light despite a decrease in total irradiance. Clouds and atmospheric aerosols are two important variables that determine the total and proportion of diffuse light reaching the surface and thereby the rate of photosynthesis and carbon accumulation in plants. In addition to these factors, the response of plants to diffuse radiation is also dependant on plant characteristics such as functional types, leaf physiology, leaf area, leaf inclination, canopy structure and shape (i. e. clumping). Local environmental conditions (i. e. temperature, soil moisture, vapour pressure deficit, etc.) then modulate these plant responses. Changes in solar radiation as a consequence of clouds and aerosols thus can modify the carbon balance of terrestrial ecosystems. Therefore, understanding the role of solar radiation in terrestrial carbon processes {{has become one of the}} goals in terrestrial carbon cycle studies. It can help to identify the control and mechanisms of carbon processes and determines the geographical and temporal distribution of the major pools and fluxes in the global carbon cycle.
