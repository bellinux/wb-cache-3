50|$|Storage {{was one of}} {{the main}} needs of the South Burnett peanut growers. Silos were {{necessary}} to hold the nuts in dry storage, treat them if affected by damp, protect them from pests and allow controlled distribution so that the market was not flooded one year and short the next. Initially, the Peanut Board leased local barns and nuts were treated in the Railway's Grain Shed in the Railway Yard at Kingaroy. Realising that more permanent arrangements were required it was decided to build a block of silos, complete with treatment plant and machinery. The Board imposed a <b>levy</b> <b>of</b> ¼ pence/pound on peanuts delivered to the Board to cover the cost. In order to build the silos the growers formed the Queensland Peanut Growers' Cooperative Association Ltd. The Association issued shares to the growers in lieu <b>of</b> the <b>levy</b> received from the Board. In this way the growers themselves became the owners of any assets bought or built with the <b>proceeds</b> <b>of</b> their <b>levy.</b>|$|R

The agreement specifies {{an increase in}} the export levy on Norwegian salmon entering the EU from 0. 75 % to 3. 00 % ad valorem. The <b>proceeds</b> <b>of</b> the <b>levy</b> are to be used by the Norwegian Seafood Export Council in cooperation with the Scottish Salmon Board and the Irish Salmon Growers Association for generic advertising of atlantic salmon in the European markets, the so called Pan-European Salmon Marketing Campaign. Over the Agreement’s five-year life, an estimated $ 30 million is expected to be invested in salmon promotion in Europe. Despite the relatively large sums being spent on these and related programs, {{little is known about the}} effects of generic advertising on consumers purchase frequency. A purpose of this research is to contribute to the understanding of these effects by examining in detail the generic advertising of atlantic salmon in Germany and France in 1998 / 99. By using a recursive econometric model linking awareness of the advertising in the first stage to the level of at-home consumption of salmon in the final stage the economic impact of the Pan-European campaign is investigated. 1.

40|$|As the {{fluctuations}} of {{the internal}} bioelectricity of nervous system is various and complex, the external electromagnetic radiation induced by magnet flux on membrane can be described by the non-Gaussian type distribution <b>of</b> <b>Lévy</b> noise. Thus, the electrical activities in an improved Hindmarsh-Rose model excited by the external electromagnetic radiation <b>of</b> <b>Lévy</b> noise are investigated and some interesting modes of the electrical activities are exhibited. The external electromagnetic radiation <b>of</b> <b>Lévy</b> noise leads to the mode transition of the electrical activities and spatial phase, such as from the rest state to the firing state, from the spiking state to the spiking state with more spikes, and from the spiking state to the bursting state. Then the time points of the firing state versus Lévy noise intensity are depicted. The increasing <b>of</b> <b>Lévy</b> noise intensity heightens the neuron firing. Also the stationary probability distribution functions of the membrane potential of the neuron induced by the external electromagnetic radiation <b>of</b> <b>Lévy</b> noise with different intensity, stability index and skewness papremeters are analyzed. Moreover, through the positive largest Lyapunov exponent, the parameter regions of chaotic electrical mode of the neuron induced by the external electromagnetic radiation <b>of</b> <b>Lévy</b> noise distribution are detected...|$|R

In this paper, {{the study of}} fluctuations in a gene transcriptional regulatory system is extended to the case <b>of</b> <b>Lévy</b> noise, a kind of non-Gaussian noises which can describe unpredictable jump changes of the random environment. The stationary probability density is given to explore the key roles <b>of</b> <b>Lévy</b> noise in the gene regulatory networks. The results demonstrate that the parameters <b>of</b> <b>Lévy</b> noise, including noise intensity, stability index and skewness parameter can induce switches between distinct gene-expression states. A further concern is the switching time (from the high concentration state to the low concentration one or from the low concentration state to the high concentration one), which is a random variable and {{often referred to as}} the mean first passage time. The effects <b>of</b> <b>Lévy</b> noise in expression time and degradation time is studied by computing the mean first passage time in two directions and a number of different peculiarities <b>of</b> non-Gaussian <b>Lévy</b> noise compared with Gaussian noise are observed.

From practical standpoint, both time-homogeneous and time-inhomogeneous functionals <b>of</b> <b>Lévy</b> processes are considered. Several expansions {{and rates of}} convergence are established.

As an application of this decomposition <b>of</b> <b>Lévy</b> trees according to their diameter, we characterize the joint law of the height and the diameter <b>of</b> stable <b>Lévy</b> trees conditioned by their total mass; we also provide asymptotic expansions of the law of the height and of the diameter of such normalised stable trees, which generalises the identity due to Szekeres (1983) in the Brownian case...|$|R

40|$|Lévy {{processes}} and infinitely divisible distributions are increasingly {{defined in terms}} <b>of</b> their <b>Lévy</b> measure. In order to describe the dependence structure <b>of</b> a multivariate <b>Lévy</b> measure, Tankov (2003) introduced Lévy copulas on. (For an extension to R -super- ""m"", see Kallsen & Tankov, 2006.) Together with the marginal Lévy measures they completely describe multivariate Lévy measures on. In this article we show that any such Lévy copula defines itself a Lévy measure with one-stable margins, in a canonical way. A limit theorem is obtained, characterizing convergence <b>of</b> <b>Lévy</b> measures with the aid <b>of</b> <b>Lévy</b> copulas. Homogeneous Lévy copulas are considered in detail. They correspond to Lévy processes which have a time-constant Lévy copula, and a complete description <b>of</b> homogeneous <b>Lévy</b> copulas is obtained. A general scheme to construct multivariate distributions having special properties is outlined, for distributions with prescribed margins having the same properties. This makes use <b>of</b> <b>Lévy</b> copulas and <b>of</b> certain mappings of Upsilon type. The construction is then exemplified for distributions in the Goldie-Steutel-Bondesson class, the Thorin class and for self-decomposable distributions.
