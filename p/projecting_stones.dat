25|$|Annery limekiln has a ramp {{facing the}} river, three kilns (or burning 'pots'), seven {{entrance}} doorways and nine lower apertures {{for the removal}} of the calcined limestone. The arrangement of the kilns gives an L-shaped compact structure. Some of the entrances led to arched lobbies or 'eyes', at the back of which were the grates and separate 'poking holes' to insert metals rods for 'working' the charge and helping with aeration. A 'lean-to' slated roof may have slotted beneath part of the drip course of <b>projecting</b> <b>stones,</b> which runs around the exterior walls of the kiln. The arched entrances to the kiln allowed for the sheltered and safe collection of the quicklime, which reacted violently to water.|$|E
500|$|<b>Projecting</b> <b>stones</b> on {{the south}} wall of the kitchen block, known as tuskings, and four pointed-arched windows in the south curtain wall, suggest that further ranges of {{buildings}} were planned. The large, eastern-most window, may have been intended for a chapel, and it is recorded that a chapel dedicated to the 8th-century monk Saint Fillan was located at Doune Castle, {{but the lack of}} foundations suggest that there was no large building {{in this part of the}} castle. The foundations which do exist were excavated in September 2002, revealing a structure which was interpreted as a kiln or oven against the south wall. The central well is around [...] deep.|$|E
500|$|The four-storey tower {{house was}} named the Stirling Tower after the {{original}} lords of Edzell, the Stirlings of Glenesk, {{although it is not}} old enough to have been built by them. It is [...] high, and measures [...] by [...] on plan. The walls are over [...] thick at the basement, narrowing to [...] on the first floor. The tower house is entered from the north, via a door protected by [...] "inverted keyhole" [...] shaped gun holes. A slot adjacent to the door would have held a draw-bar, to reinforce the entry, and several mason's marks remain around the door. The hall occupies the first floor, above two vaulted cellars. Marks in the wall show the position of a minstrels' gallery and a timber screen, which concealed a serving area accessed via a narrow stair from the cellar. The broad main spiral stair led up to three further storeys of private chambers, before reaching a caphouse, a small rooftop chamber giving access to a parapet walk. The four corners of the tower have bartizans, or open turrets, and similar projections occur halfway along each wall. The parapet is supported on <b>projecting</b> <b>stones,</b> or corbels, arranged in a pattern of two tiers which alternate, rendering the lower tier purely decorative. Edzell represents an early occurrence of this style, known as chequered corbelling, which became more widespread later in the 16th century.|$|E
50|$|Plain granite pilasters {{mark the}} corners. The portico {{features}} four Corinthian columns and a classical entablature. Other decoration includes <b>projecting</b> <b>stone</b> belt-courses, granite rectangles between the windows, vertical stretchers above windows and granite aprons below.|$|R
50|$|Constructed of brick, the 900 ft bridge has 8 arches, each {{spanning}} 70 ft {{and rising}} 17 ft. The supporting piers are hollow and tapered, rising to <b>projecting</b> <b>stone</b> cornices that {{held up the}} arch centring during construction.|$|R
60|$|Harry {{could not}} swim, {{but he had}} grasped {{the edge of a}} <b>projecting</b> <b>stone</b> near which he had fallen, and when his {{strength}} had failed, and he had sunk below the surface, his hand still retained its grasp.|$|R
60|$|Richard {{watched for}} an {{opportunity}} of speaking to Harry, which did not at once occur, as the boy spent very little of his time at home, and, as if by tacit consent, he and Norman came in later every evening. At last, on Thursday, in the additional two hours' leisure allowed to the boys, when the studious prepared their tasks, and the idle had some special diversion, Richard encountered him running up to his own room to fetch a newly-invented instrument for <b>projecting</b> <b>stones.</b>|$|E
60|$|Now to the right, {{and now to}} the left, ran {{the narrow}} path that wound its way in the {{thickness}} of the mighty wall, which towered so high above them that they walked almost in darkness, and at each turn of it were recesses; and above these <b>projecting</b> <b>stones,</b> where archers could stand for its defence. At length this path ended in a cul-de-sac, for in front of them was nothing but blank masonry. Whilst Rachel and Noie stared at it wondering whither they should go now, a large stone in this wall turned, leaving a narrow doorway through which they passed, whereon it shut again behind them, though by what machinery they could not see.|$|E
6000|$|... "It {{was only}} forgetfulness, my dear!" [...] said the worthy man, putting his hat quite meekly {{on the back}} of his head, and pushing forward in order to avoid further remarks. Coming to a hollow of the road, they found that it was {{submerged}} a foot deep by the river, which had been swollen into a small lake at that spot. There was much trouble here. McAllister, with native gallantry, offered to carry the ladies over in his arms; but the ladies would not listen to the proposal, with the exception of Tilly, who at once accepted it gladly. The rest succeeded in scrambling along by the <b>projecting</b> <b>stones</b> at the base of the wall that ran alongside of the road, and gained the other side, after many slips, much alarm, and sundry screams.|$|E

60|$|He let fall Tito's hand, {{and going}} {{backwards}} a little, first rested his arm on a <b>projecting</b> <b>stone</b> in the wall, and then sank {{again in a}} sitting posture on the straw. The outleap of fury in the dagger-thrust had evidently exhausted him.|$|R
60|$|They {{sat down}} a few moments on the {{circular}} seat, {{and looked at the}} pretty scene of this quiet little village, clustered round the old church as a centre; a collection of houses, mostly thatched, though there were one or two, with rather more pretension, that had roofs of red tiles. Some of them were stone cottages, whitewashed, but the larger edifices had timber frames, filled in with brick and plaster, which seemed to have been renewed in patches, and to be a frailer and less durable material than the old oak of their skeletons. They were gabled, with lattice windows, and picturesquely set off with <b>projecting</b> <b>stones,</b> and many little patchwork additions, such as, in the course of generations, the inhabitants had found themselves to need. There was not much commerce, apparently, in this little village, there seeming to be only one shop, with some gingerbread, penny whistles, ballads, and such matters, displayed in the window; and there, too, across the little green, opposite the church, was the village alehouse, with its bench under the low projecting eaves, with a Teniers scene of two wayfaring yeomen drinking a pot of beer and smoking their pipes.|$|E
60|$|Wet {{weather was}} the worst; the cold, damp, clammy wet, that wrapped him {{up like a}} moist great-coat—the only kind of great-coat Toby owned, or could have added to his comfort by {{dispensing}} with. Wet days, when the rain came slowly, thickly, obstinately down; when the street’s throat, like his own, was choked with mist; when smoking umbrellas passed and re-passed, spinning round and round like so many teetotums, as they knocked against {{each other on the}} crowded footway, throwing off a little whirlpool of uncomfortable sprinklings; when gutters brawled and waterspouts were full and noisy; when the wet from the <b>projecting</b> <b>stones</b> and ledges of the church fell drip, drip, drip, on Toby, making the wisp of straw on which he stood mere mud in no time; those were the days that tried him. Then, indeed, you might see Toby looking anxiously out from his shelter in an angle of the church wall—such a meagre shelter that in summer time it never cast a shadow thicker than a good-sized walking stick upon the sunny pavement—with a disconsolate and lengthened face. But coming out, a minute afterwards, to warm himself by exercise, and trotting up and down some dozen times, he would brighten even then, and go back more brightly to his niche.|$|E
6000|$|... 67. Fig. 7, a, b and c are English chimneys. They are distinguishable, we think, at a glance, {{from all}} the rest, by a downright serviceableness of appearance, a substantial, unaffected, decent, and chimney-like deportment, in the contemplation of which we {{experience}} infinite pleasure and edification, particularly {{as it seems to}} us to be strongly contrasted with an appearance, in all the other chimneys, of an indefinable something, only to be expressed by the interesting word [...] "humbug." [...] Fig. 7 a is a chimney of Cumberland, and the north of Lancashire. It is, as may be seen at a glance, only applicable at the extremity of the roof, and requires a bent flue. It is built of unhewn stones, {{in the same manner as}} the Westmoreland cottages; the flue itself being not one-third the width of the chimney, as is seen at the top, where four flat stones placed on their edges form the termination of the flue itself, and give lightness of appearance to the whole. Cover this with a piece of paper, and observe how heavy and square the rest becomes. A few <b>projecting</b> <b>stones</b> continue the line of the roof across the center of the chimney, and two large masses support the projection of the whole, and unite it agreeably with the wall. This is exclusively a cottage chimney; it cannot, and must not, be built of civilized materials; it must be rough, and mossy, and broken; but it is decidedly the best chimney of the whole set. It is simple and substantial, without being cumbrous; it gives great variety to the wall from which it projects, terminates the roof agreeably, and dismisses its smoke with infinite propriety.|$|E
50|$|Constructed of {{engineering}} brick, the 886 ft viaduct has eight semi-elliptical arches, each spanning 70 ft and rising 17.5 ft. It is 55 ft wide.

60|$|They sank wearily {{down upon}} a <b>projecting</b> <b>stone.</b> The moss was restful to their tired limbs. Opening the pack they found food {{with which to}} satisfy the demands of hunger.

60|$|The trapper, {{though he}} was not deceived as {{to the state of}} Dr. Battius' mind, was, however, greatly in error as to the {{exciting}} cause. While imitating the movements of his companions, and toiling his way upward with the utmost caution, and not without great inward tribulation, the eye of the naturalist had caught a glimpse of an unknown plant, a few yards above his head, and in a situation more than commonly exposed to the missiles which the girls were unceasingly hurling {{in the direction of the}} assailants. Forgetting, in an instant, every thing but the glory of being the first to give this jewel to the catalogues of science, he sprang upward at the prize with the avidity with which the sparrow darts upon the butterfly. The rocks, which instantly came thundering down, announced that he was seen; and for a moment, while his form was concealed in the cloud of dust and fragments which followed the furious descent, the trapper gave him up for lost; but the next instant he was seen safely seated in a cavity formed by some of the <b>projecting</b> <b>stones</b> which had yielded to the shock, holding triumphantly in his hand the captured stem, which he was already devouring with delighted, and certainly not unskilful, eyes. Paul profited by the opportunity. Turning his course, with the quickness of thought, he sprang to the post which Obed thus securely occupied, and unceremoniously making a footstool of his shoulder, as the latter stooped over his treasure, he bounded through the breach left by the fallen rock, and gained the level. He was followed by Middleton, who joined him in seizing and disarming the girls. In this manner a bloodless and complete victory was obtained over that citadel which Ishmael had vainly flattered himself might prove impregnable.|$|E
6000|$|... 97. Florence {{meanwhile}} {{was fighting}} with herself, {{for her own}} amusement. She was nominally {{at the head of}} the Guelphic League in Tuscany; but this only meant that she hated Siena and Pisa, her southern and western neighbours. She had never declared openly against the Emperor. On the contrary, she always recognized his authority, in an imaginative manner, as representing that of the Caesars. She spent her own energy chiefly in street-fighting,--the death of Buondelmonti in 1215 having been the root of a series of quarrels among her nobles which gradually took the form of contests of honour; and were a kind of accidental tournaments, fought to the death, because they could not be exciting or dignified enough on any other condition. And thus the manner of life came to be customary, which you have accurately, with its consequences, pictured by Shakspeare. Samson bites his thumb at Abraham, and presently the streets are impassable in battle. The quarrel in the Canongate between the Leslies and Seytons, in Scott's 'Abbot,' represents the same temper; and marks also, what Shakspeare did not so distinctly, because it would have interfered with the domestic character of his play, the connection of these private quarrels with political divisions which paralyzed the entire body of the State.--Yet these political schisms, in the earlier days of Italy, never reached the bitterness of Scottish feud, [1] because they were never so sincere. Protestant and Catholic Scotsmen faithfully believed each other to be servants of the devil; but the Guelph and Ghibelline of Florence each respected, in the other, the fidelity to the Emperor, or piety towards the Pope, which he found it convenient, for the time, to dispense with in his own person. The street fighting was therefore more general, more chivalric, more good-humoured; a word of offence set all the noblesse of the town on fire; every one rallied to his post; fighting began at once in half a dozen places of recognized convenience, but ended in the evening; and, on the following day, the leaders determined in contended truce who had fought best, buried their dead triumphantly, and better fortified any weak points, which the events of the previous day had exposed at their palace corners. Florentine dispute was apt to centre itself about the gate of St. Peter, [2] the tower of the cathedral, or the fortress-palace of the Uberti, (the family of Dante's Bellincion Berti and of Farinata), which occupied the site of the present Palazzo Vecchio. But the streets of Siena seem to have afforded better barricade practice. They are as steep as they are narrow--extremely both; and the <b>projecting</b> <b>stones</b> on their palace fronts, which were left, in building, to sustain, on occasion, the barricade beams across the streets, are to this day important features in their architecture.|$|E

In the north east corner, opposite the bridge, stored stones are witness to a project to build a keep, never completed. Three materials were used in the construction. Basalt was used for the centre of the surrounding walls, all of the upper parts and for the external enceinte. The basalt came from the digging of the moat. Volcanic breccia, a conglomerate, was used for the parts of walls above a height of 7 m. This rock was taken from a quarry on the east flank of the hill.
