40|$|It {{has been}} argued that the opaqueness of {{structured}} bonds, such as mortgage-backed securities, asset-backed securities and collateral debt obligations, was one of the major causes of the recent financial crisis that started in late 2007. We analyse the evolving nature of information asymmetry inherent in various types of structured bonds by examining the U. S. insurers’ assets. We show that, prior to 2004, structured bonds were not associated with greater information asymmetry; however, holding more multi-class structured bonds, especially <b>privately</b> <b>placed</b> bonds, increased the information asymmetry when evaluating insurers’ assets post- 2004. The effect of information asymmetry was more significant with life insurers than with non-life insurers. In addition, by investigating the rating grades of such structured bonds, we find that the market views higher-grade, <b>privately</b> <b>placed,</b> multi-class structured bonds as having the highest information asymmetry among all types of structured bonds post 2004, an effect which is, again, more significant with life insurers. This result shows that structuring complexities and unreliable ratings make structured bonds more opaque than just securitisation itself...|$|R

The results suggest no effect for firms with a public debt rating and offsetting effects for firms without a public debt rating. If the private placement appears to reduce monitoring for a firm without a debt rating, it produces a significantly negative price response.

40|$|In this paper, {{we examine}} how and {{what types of}} Japanese small and {{medium-sized}} enterprises (SMEs) use the private placement market, exploring factors behind their choice between private placement bonds and bank loans as a means of raising capital. <b>Privately</b> <b>placed</b> corporate bonds tend to have a medium- to long-term maturity period and are often guaranteed by banks. The typical profile of an issuer of <b>privately</b> <b>placed</b> bonds is a medium-sized firm that is fairly profitable and has relatively low financial leverage. Meanwhile, poorly performing medium-sized enterprises - i. e., those posing a serious information asymmetry problem - and smaller firms tend to opt for bank loans. As compared to issuers of private placement bonds, firms relying on long-term bank loans generally have a higher fixed-to-total assets ratio. That is, smaller firms and information-problematic medium-sized firms tend to borrow from banks. We argue that issuing private placement bonds offers greater advantages to those firms capable of doing so, namely, profitable and medium sized firms with relatively low financial leverage because it enables them to secure medium- to long-term financing and thus avoid frequent bank interference with their business management. Furthermore, they can build a track record of successful bond issuance. These findings have important policy implications regarding SMEs' choice of financing. Meanwhile, firms show less of a tendency to issue bonds when their main creditor bank is saddled with more bad loans. This suggests that the credit crunch is not a reason for opting for private placement bonds. ...|$|R

We present {{a model of the}} choice between these two methods. We view a rights issue as similar to the type of issue envisaged by Myers and Majiluf (1984), in which information asymmetry persists until after the shares are sold. In contrast, the placement process is assumed to enable potential placees to investigate the value of the issuer and to reveal the true value via the placement price, as in Hertzel and Smith (1993). The model yields several testable predictions which are strongly supported by evidence from a large sample of seasoned equity offers...|$|R
40|$|Despite the {{importance}} of renegotiation in affecting loan terms of bank debt, little {{work has been done}} investigating factors influencing renegotiation of <b>privately</b> <b>placed</b> debt. We find that renegotiation is more likely to occur in good economic times as measured by lower unemployment, lower public credit spreads, and outside of economic recessions. Moreover, renegotiated loan terms are more favorable for the borrower in business cycle upswings. Changes to debt covenants are very weakly correlated with the broader economy, suggesting that covenant amendments may be more driven by discovery of firm-specific information. Finally, we find that a healthier commercial banking sector not only significantly increases the probability of renegotiation, but also leads to more favorable terms for the borrower...|$|R

In effect, hedge funds use {{their knowledge of the}} borrowing and short-sale market to hedge themselves while distributing equity exposure to a large number of well-diversified investors through their short positions. The authors argue that many “would-be” equity issuers that would otherwise pay high costs in a secondary equity issue choose instead to issue convertible debt to hedge funds that in turn distribute equity exposure to institutional investors. This allows companies to receive “equity-like” financing today at lower cost than a secondary equity offering.

40|$|We {{examine the}} wealth {{effects of the}} {{announcement}} of issues {{of different types of}} convertible securities by UK firms and find significant negative effects on shareholder wealth. We however, also find that when the sample is partitioned by method of <b>issue,</b> <b>privately</b> <b>placed</b> convertible bonds, in contrast to previous research, exhibit a negative impact on firm wealth. Further, we also find negative wealth effects for firms that issue convertible securities to refinance previous debt or finance specific acquisitions. However announcements of convertible bond issues, for the purpose of financing capital expenditure schemes, show significant positive wealth effects. Finally, we find mixed support for testable predictions of the main theoretical models relating cross-sectional firm characteristics of convertible bond issuers to abnormal returns.

40|$|Abstract__ The {{financial}} {{world does not}} have the best reputation. One of the problems is the perceived lack of integrity of financial markets, which is fuelled by examples of financial misconduct. I argue that with financial data becoming more widely available and constantly improving, financial researchers could help in identifying suspicious behavior in financial markets. I will provide examples of potentially fraudulent behavior surrounding executive compensation and security issuance. Allegedly, companies have backdated executives’ stock options and as such have increased executives’ effective compensation, and there might be widespread insider trading before the announcements of <b>privately</b> <b>placed</b> securities. Systematic analyses of the available data could detect these examples of misconduct. Overall, forensic finance has the potential to detect suspicious behavior and as such could {{play an important role in}} understanding and improving the integrity of the {{financial world}}...|$|R

40|$|India’s {{financial}} and capital market reforms {{since the early}} 1990 s have had {{a positive impact on}} both the banking sector and capital markets. Nevertheless, the capital markets remain shallow, {{particularly when it comes to}} differentiating high-quality firms from low-quality ones (and thus lowering capital costs for the former compared with the latter). While some high-quality firms (e. g., large firms) have substituted bond finance for bank loans, this has not occurred to any significant degree for many other types of firms (e. g., old, export-oriented and commercial paper-issuing ones). This reflects the fact that most bonds are <b>privately</b> <b>placed,</b> exempting issuers from the stringent accounting and disclosure requirements necessary for public issues. As a result, banks remain major financiers for both high- and low-quality firms.

Contrary to results reported in real estate transactions of this sort in the past, we find that announcement-period shareholder returns are significantly positive in the aggregate.

30|$|The {{monetary}} union by removing exchange rate risk, {{allowed for the}} possibility of large external imbalances to develop and indeed the size of foreign capital flows into Spain was unprecedented. Two pieces of evidence on this will serve to make the point. First the Memoria de Supervisión Bancaria for the years 2003 – 2007 reports the volume of the Spanish securitizations in the hands of foreigners. As it is well known Spanish securitizations came in two types, the standard one in other jurisdictions which involves transfer of the underlying asset to a special purpose vehicle funded through the issuance of liabilities with waterfall structures, and a second one akin to a securitization of a liability, a single-certificate <b>privately</b> <b>placed</b> covered bond (cédulas hipotecarias). As reported by these Memorias the stock of both types of securitization was slightly above € 300 bn by 2007. Of these more than € 200 bn were in the hands of foreigners. This evidence is important because it confirms the existence of a direct link between international capital flows and the real estate bubble.|$|R
