25|$|Cryptorchidism is {{the absence}} of one or both testes from the scrotum. It is the most common birth defect of the male genital. About 3% of full-term and 30% of <b>premature</b> <b>infant</b> boys are born with at least one undescended testis. However, about 80% of cryptorchid testes descend by the first year of life (the {{majority}} within three months), making the true incidence of cryptorchidism around 1% overall. Cryptorchidism may develop after infancy, sometimes as late as young adulthood, but that is exceptional.|$|E
25|$|In {{terms of}} FASD, growth {{deficiency}} {{is defined as}} significantly below average height, weight or both due to prenatal alcohol exposure, and can be assessed {{at any point in}} the lifespan. Growth measurements must be adjusted for parental height, gestational age (for a <b>premature</b> <b>infant),</b> and other postnatal insults (e.g., poor nutrition), although birth height and weight are the preferred measurements. Deficiencies are documented when height or weight falls at or below the 10th percentile of standardized growth charts appropriate to the population.|$|E

40|$|The study explores mothers’ of <b>premature</b> <b>infants</b> {{experience}} of how health centers especially adapted {{for families with}} <b>premature</b> <b>infants</b> can help them to cope with everyday life after discharge from a neonatal intensive care unit. Background: Premature children are at higher risk for {{physical and mental health}} problems, which makes parenting demanding. The transition between hospital and home is a challenging period where parents may need extra support to cope with everyday life. Method: Nine mothers of <b>premature</b> <b>infants</b> receiving follow-up care at a health center especially adapted for families with <b>premature</b> <b>infants</b> were interviewed. Data were analyzed by Kvale and Brinkmann’s guidelines for text analysis. Findings: The study revealed that mothers of <b>premature</b> <b>infants</b> need to adapt to a daily life with both challenges and joys. Mothers’ sense of coping in everyday life is affected by the public health nurse’s knowledge of and experience with <b>premature</b> <b>infants.</b> Conclusion: Mothers of <b>premature</b> <b>infants</b> experience a challenging daily life after discharge from neonatal intensive care unit. A health center especially adapted for families with <b>premature</b> <b>infants</b> can help mothers cope with everyday life after discharge through availability, flexibility, expertise, facilitating a social network and focusing on mothers’ own {{experience of}} their daily life...|$|R

25|$|Caffeine {{can have}} both {{positive}} and negative health effects. It can treat and prevent the <b>premature</b> <b>infant</b> breathing disorders bronchopulmonary dysplasia of prematurity and apnea of prematurity. Caffeine citrate is on the WHO Model List of Essential Medicines. It may confer a modest protective effect against some diseases, including Parkinson's disease. Some people experience insomnia or sleep disruption if they consume caffeine, especially during the evening hours, but others show little disturbance. Evidence of a risk during pregnancy is equivocal; some authorities recommend that pregnant women limit consumption to the equivalent of two cups of coffee per day or less. Caffeine can produce a mild form of drug dependence– associated with withdrawal symptoms such as sleepiness, headache, and irritability– when an individual stops using caffeine after repeated daily intake. Tolerance to the autonomic effects of increased blood pressure and heart rate, and increased urine output, develops with chronic use (i.e., these symptoms become less pronounced or do not occur following consistent use).|$|E
25|$|Multimodal {{stimulation}} and music: By combining music, such as lullabies, and multimodal stimulation, premature infants were {{discharged from}} the NICU sooner, than those infants who did not receive therapy. Multimodal stimulation (MMS) includes the applications of auditory, tactile, vestibular, and visual stimulation that helps aid in <b>premature</b> <b>infant</b> development. The combination of music and MMS helps premature infants sleep and conserve vital energy required to gain weight more rapidly. Studies have shown that girls respond more positively than boys during multimodal stimulation. While the voice is a popular choice for parents looking to bond with their premature infants, other effective instruments include the Remo Ocean Disk and the Gato Box. Both are used to stimulate {{the sounds of the}} womb. The Remo Ocean Disk, a round musical instrument that mimics the fluid sounds of the womb, has been shown to benefit decreased heart rate after therapeutic uses, as well as promoting healthy sleep patterns, lower respiratory rates and improve sucking behavior.|$|E

40|$|Background: Anthropometric {{indicators}} {{are difficult to}} interpret in very low birth weight (VLBW) <b>premature</b> <b>infants,</b> including both appropriate for gestational age (AGA) and small for gestational age (SGA) infants. Therefore, {{the purpose was to}} describe the anthropometric indicators of growth and nutritional status in VLBW <b>premature</b> <b>infants</b> AGA and SGA, hospitalized in a neonatal intensive care unit (NICU). Study design: The descriptive and prospective study design included 114 preterm infants, adequate for gestational age/small for gestational age hospitalized in the intensive care unit. Head, thigh, mid upper arm circumference, skin-fold measurements and weight/age, length/ age, and weight/length indices were obtained. Correlations were made among the anthropometric indices, and a multivariate regression analysis with weight/age as dependent variable was performed. Results: Weight/age in AGA <b>premature</b> <b>infants</b> had high number of significant anthropometric correlations. The SGA <b>premature</b> <b>infants</b> had few and weak correlations. The regression analysis showed that anthropometric indices better explain changes in the weight/age index in adequate for gestational age <b>premature</b> <b>infants.</b> Conclusion: Weight/age in the VLBW/AGA <b>premature</b> <b>infants</b> could reflect growth, nutritional status and energy stored as fat, but in the VLBW/SGA <b>premature</b> <b>infants,</b> thigh circumference and mid arm circumference would be better indicators just of nutritional status...|$|R

40|$|Aim: To {{determine}} the {{morbidity and mortality}} of <b>premature</b> <b>infants</b> born with oesophageal atresia (OA) and to evaluate historical changes in morbidity and mortality over time. Methods: Retrospective analysis {{of morbidity and mortality}} of all patients admitted for OA, with or without tracheo-oesophageal fistula, between 1982 and 2002. Results: The study group consisted of 197 consecutive patients, of whom 55 (28 %) were premature and 21 (11 %) very premature. Type A atresia was found more often in very <b>premature</b> and <b>premature</b> <b>infants</b> than in those born at term (p = 0. 02). Type E atresia was not found in the premature group (p = 0. 004). At least one associated congenital anomaly was also present in 121 patients (61 %). Postoperative complications developed more often in very <b>premature</b> and <b>premature</b> <b>infants</b> than in those born at term (p < 0. 001). Gastro-oesophageal reflux was diagnosed in 32 / 76 <b>premature</b> <b>infants</b> and in 41 / 121 term infants (p = 0. 001). Mortality among very <b>premature</b> and <b>premature</b> <b>infants</b> was higher than among those born at term (p = 0. 003). Withdrawal of treatment was the most frequent cause of death. Conclusion: <b>Premature</b> <b>infants</b> with OA have a higher morbidity and mortality than term infants with OA. The complications of prematurity contribute significantly to morbidity and mortality in <b>premature</b> <b>infants</b> with OA. There is no reason to refrain from the standard treatment of OA in <b>premature</b> <b>infants</b> with no severe associated congenital anomalie...|$|R

40|$|Background: Free {{radicals}} {{have been}} implicated in the pathogenesis of some complications among pre-mature infants. Even though ascorbate is an important anti-oxidant in human plasma, it can also act as a pro-oxidant at high concentrations {{in the presence of}} metal ions, which causes oxidative damage in prema-ture infants. Objective: To determine plasma ascorbate and ceruloplasmin levels in <b>premature</b> <b>infants</b> (and their mothers) and full-term infants and to compare between groups. Material and Method: Premature (n = 27) and full-term infants (n = 24) and the mothers of the <b>premature</b> <b>infants</b> (n = 13) admitted to Srinagarind Hospital, Khon Kaen University, Thailand, were enrolled in the study.
