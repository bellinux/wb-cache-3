40|$|We {{have adapted}} the {{neutral red uptake}} assay for {{quantitative}} assessment of injury to fibroblast cultures by potential phototoxins. Tetracycline derivatives, quinolone derivatives, and chlorpromazine were used as model compounds for development of the assay. Human fibroblasts Were incubated with potential phototoxins, the cell cultures irradiated with UV, and the capacity for neutral red uptake determined. Demeclocycline and doxycycline, two known photosensitizers, showed a 94 % and 95 % decrease of neutral red uptake, respectively, indicating photo-induced cytotoxicity. Minocycline, a non-photosensitizing tetracycline derivative, showed no decrease in uptake. Tetracycline, a weak <b>phototoxin,</b> showed minor (10 %) decrease at equivalent concentrations (20 μg/ml). Microscopic observation of neutral red uptake and cell damage paralleled the spectrophotometric findings. Chlorpromazine, a non-tetracycline, <b>phototoxin,</b> showed 91 % decrease. An additional group of phototoxic drugs, quinolone antibacterials, were studied. Nalidixic acid, ofloxacin, ciprofloxacin, and norfloxacin all demonstrated phototoxicity, with nalidixic acid showing the greatest decrease in neutral red uptake.

40|$|The {{breast cancer}} {{resistance}} protein (BCRP/ABCG 2) {{is a member}} of the ATP-binding cassette family of drug transporters and confers resistance to various anticancer drugs. We show here that mice lacking Bcrp 1 /Abcg 2 become extremely sensitive to the dietary chlorophyll-breakdown product pheophorbide a, resulting in severe, sometimes lethal phototoxic lesions on light-exposed skin. Pheophorbide a occurs in various plant-derived foods and food supplements. Bcrp 1 transports pheophorbide a and is highly efficient in limiting its uptake from ingested food. Bcrp 1 (-/-) mice also displayed a previously unknown type of protoporphyria. Erythrocyte levels of the heme precursor and <b>phototoxin</b> protoporphyrin IX, which is structurally related to pheophorbide a, were increased 10 -fold. Transplantation with wild-type bone marrow cured the protoporphyria and reduced the <b>phototoxin</b> sensitivity of Bcrp 1 (-/-) mice.

40|$|Phototoxicity {{occurs when}} a {{substance}} is toxic only under the action of light, and can, depending on the mechanism of toxic action, be divided into type I and type II phototoxicity. Other types are sometimes recongnized, and sometimes toxicity occurs through more than one mechanism. Plants often use <b>phototoxins</b> for their defense. They may be harmful to man, but also exploited for medical treatments. On the other hand, drugs selected for other properties may show unwanted phototoxicity. Some fungi produce <b>phototoxins.</b> Due to other kinds of poisoning or to disease even the human or animal body may produce <b>phototoxins</b> and be harmed by them. Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), widespread environmental contaminants, have a potential to become toxic or acquire increased toxicity when they inter-act with natural or simulated sunlight. Because of their chemical structure numerous PAHs absorb energy in the UV waveband. Phototoxicity of PAHs occurs mainly via photosensitiza-tion and/or photomodification reactions: photosensitization reactions of bioaccumulated PAHs in biological matrices are regarded as important mechanisms for phototoxicity, but PAHs may also be photomodified into more toxic form e. g. via photooxidation. Phototoxicity of PAHs has been demonstrated {{in a variety of}} aquatic organisms, responses ranging from acute lethality to chronic effects. However, a variety of factors affecting the exposure of organisms to PAHs and to UV radiation, as well as interactions between multiple environ-mental factors and stressors present in natural conditions complicate the risk assessment for phototoxicity...|$|R

We show that SOR 1 is essential in pyridoxine (vitamin B 6) synthesis in C. nicotianae and Aspergillus flavus, although it shows no homology to previously identified pyridoxine synthesis genes identified in Escherichia coli. Sequence database analysis demonstrated that organisms encode either SOR 1 or E. coli pyridoxine biosynthesis genes, but not both, suggesting that there are two divergent pathways for de novo pyridoxine biosynthesis in nature. Pathway divergence appears to have occurred during the evolution of the eubacteria. We also present data showing that pyridoxine quenches singlet oxygen at a rate comparable to that of vitamins C and E, two of the most highly efficient biological antioxidants, suggesting a previously unknown role for pyridoxine in active oxygen resistance...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{determine}} the toxicity of the <b>phototoxin,</b> phenylheptatriyne (PHT) to acute lymphoblastic leukemia cells (ALL) under attenuated light conditions and when exposed to ultraviolet-A light (UVA). The potential of PHT to increase sensitivity of ALL cells to the anti-cancer drug doxorubicin hydrochloride also was evaluated. An in vitro multi-drug resistance model was used consisting of the parental cell line CCRF-CEM and its p-glycoprotein (pgp- 170) expressing variant CEM/VLB 100. Cytotoxicity was measured using the tetrazolium bromide (MTT) reduction assay and the annexin-V-FITC / propidium iodide (PI), flow cytometric assay. The results indicate that PHT is more toxic, when not photoexcited, to the CEM/VLB 100 cell line (P = 0. 006). There was a significant interaction between UVA dose and PHT concentration (P 3 ̆c 0. 001).

40|$|Photo-unstable {{chemicals}} sometimes {{behave as}} <b>phototoxins</b> in skin, inducing untoward clinical side-effects {{when exposed to}} sunlight. Some drugs, such as psoralens or fluoroquinolones, can damage genomic DNA, thus increasing the risk of photocarcinogenesis. Here, lomefloxacin, an antibiotic from the fluoroquinolone family known {{to be involved in}} skin tumor development in photoexposed mice, was studied using normal human skin cells in culture: fibroblasts, keratinocytes, and Caucasian melanocytes. When treated cells were exposed to simulated solar ultraviolet A (320 – 400 nm), lomefloxacin induced damage such as strand breaks and pyrimidine dimers in genomic DNA. Lomefloxacin also triggered various stress responses: heme-oxygenase- 1 expression in fibroblasts, changes in p 53 status as shown by the accumulation of p 53 and p 21 proteins or the induction of MDM 2 and GADD 45 genes, and stimulation of melanogenesis by increasing the tyrosinase activity in melanocytes. Lomefloxacin could also lead to apoptosis in keratinocytes exposed to ultraviolet A: caspase- 3 was activated and FAS-L gene was induced. Moreover, keratinocytes were shown to be the most sensitive cell type to lomefloxacin phototoxic effects, in spite of the well-established effectiveness of their antioxidant equipment. These data show that the phototoxicity of a given drug can be driven by different mechanisms and that its biologic impact varies according to cell type...|$|R
40|$|The ecophysiological {{importance}} of <b>phototoxins</b> (PTs), {{a group of}} plant light-activated secondary compounds toxic {{to a wide range}} of organisms, was investigated in the context of plant-insect relationships. The efficiency of PTs in protecting plants against herbivores was investigated in the field by measuring the herbivory damage on a series of ten plant species having different levels of phototoxic activity. Regression analyses performed between the herbivory level and the phototoxic activity of plants indicated a lower number of herbivore attacks per leaf and a higher leaf area removed per attack on the most phototoxic plants. There was, however, no effect of the phototoxic activity of plant tissues on the total area per leaf removed by herbivores or the percent of leaf area consumed. Field observations also revealed that specialist insects typically occurred on highly phototoxic plants whereas generalist insects were predominantly restricted to the least phototoxic plants. Thus PTs do not reduce the total herbivory pressure experienced by plants, although they restrict the range of herbivores attacking plants to specialist herbivores, that is those that are likely to have evolved some adaptation. The purported adaptations of insects to PTs present in their host plants were investigated in a group of specialist and generalist herbivorous insects feeding on the phototoxic foliage of either Hypericum perforatum (Guttiferae) or Viguiera annua (Asteraceae). This comparative approach identified distinct behavioral and biochemical adaptations that are used by generalist and specialist phytophagous insects to circumvent phototoxicity. Generalist insects, three long-horned grasshoppers collected on H. perforatum in the southwest of France, were observed to selectively feed between the glands located on leaves of Hypericum perforatum that contain the PT hypericin. On the other hand, specialist insects, three leaf beetles and one noctuid, all relied on light-avoidance behavioral strategies to prevent photosensitization. Glands containing the PT hypericin were indeed acting as a feeding stimulant to larvae of Cloantha perspicillaris, a specialist noctuid on St John's-wort. Some differences between specialist and generalist insects were also observed in the activities of antioxidant enzymes which are a major biochemical adaptation for insects to tolerate the oxidative stress induced by PTs. Generalist insects relied on high constitutive activities of antioxidant enzymes (glutathione reductase and glutathione S-transferase) whereas insects specialized on phototoxic plants had lower, but PT-inducible activities of antioxidant enzymes. Some important ecophysiological constraints for plants relying on phototoxic defenses were also identified. It was furthermore confirmed that these environmentally-mediated variations in the production of defensive traits in plants affected the performance of herbivorous insects under both laboratory and field conditions. Inconsistencies between the results that were obtained in the present study and predictions based on the classical theory of coevolutionary interactions between host plants and their associated herbivorous insects, led me to propose a modified evolutionary scheme referred to as plant integrated chemical defenses (PICDs). It is suggested that PICDs may have evolved in phototoxic plants to specifically counter the ecophysiological drawbacks associated with phototoxic chemical defenses.

40|$|Photodynamic therapy (PDT) is an {{established}} anticancer treatment employing a <b>phototoxin</b> (photosensitizer), visible light and oxygen. The latter is photochemically converted into reactive oxygen species, which are highly toxic to the cells. Hypericin, a natural pigment of hypericum plants, is prominent among photosensitizers. The unique perylenequinone structure of hypericin {{is responsible for}} its intriguing multifaceted photochemical cytotoxicity. The diverse photodynamic action of hypericin targets a range of subcellular organelles most importantly the mitochondria and the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) -Golgi complex. Hypericin exerts its phototoxicity through intricate mechanisms, implicating key proteins, vital enzymes, organelle membranes and changes in cellular homeostasis. This, depending on drug and light administration conditions, leads to cell death, which occurs mainly by the induction of apoptosis and/or necrosis. Cell photosensitization with hypericin is also associated with the stimulation of macroautophagy, which may promote cell demise when the apoptotic machinery is defective. Herein, we aim to integrate the most important findings with regard to hypericin photocytotoxicity, into a unified scenario, detailing its potential in cancer photomedicine...|$|E
40|$|Many {{secondary}} plant compounds {{are capable}} of photoactivation resulting {{in the production of}} toxic species of oxygen. One mechanism of defense for insects feeding on phototoxic plants may be the presence of antioxidant enzymes such as superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), glutathione peroxidase (GPOX), and glutathione reductase (GR). The activities of these enzymes were examined in larvae of three lepidoptera: Ostrinia nubilalis, Manduca sexta, and Anaitis plagiata. Highest levels of antioxidant enzyme activity were found in A. plagiata, a specialist feeder on Hypericum perforatum, which contains high levels of the <b>phototoxin</b> hypericin. Larvae of A. plagiata fed leaf discs treated with hypericin exhibited a short-term, concentration-dependent decline in enzyme activity. Longer term studies with A. plagiata fed either the phototoxic H. perforatum, or the closely related but non phototoxic H. calycinum, resulted in increased CAT and GR activity in larvae fed the phototoxic plant whereas superoxide dismutase activity was not significantly different. These results suggest that CAT and GR may be inducible defenses against phototoxins. Other insect defenses against phototoxins include specific biochemical defenses such as antioxidants. These antioxidant defenses eliminate or quench the deleterious singlet oxygen and free radicals formed by these phototoxins. We examined the role of dietary antioxidants in protecting the phototoxin-sensitive insect herbivore M. sexta. Elevated dietary levels of the lipid-soluble antioxidants beta-carotene and vitamin E resulted in a concentration-dependent reduction in the mortality associated with treatment of larvae with the phototoxic thiophene α-T. Elevated levels of dietary ascorbic acid had no effect whereas reduced levels greatly increased the toxicity of α-T. Tissue levels of antioxidants were shown to increase substantially in larvae fed antioxidant-supplemented diets. The results suggest that the ability to absorb and utilize plant-derived antioxidants could be an important defense against photo-activated plant secondary compounds and may have allowed some insects to exploit phototoxic plants. The effects of oxidative stress induced by α-T at the biochemical level and the protective effect of antioxidants and antioxidant enzymes were also examined. The <b>phototoxin</b> α-T strongly induced lipid peroxidation (LPO) in midgut tissues of the phototoxin-sensitive M. sexta in a UV-dependent manner, however this LPO was prevented when the compound was administered to larvae raised on high vitamin E diets. In the absence of UV, α-T caused a significant increase in GPOX, GR, and non-GSH-dependent PER activity over 72 h. However in the presence of UV, α-T strongly inhibited GPOX and GR and prevented the increase in PER. α-T also affected cellular thiol status with approximately a 50...|$|E

The diamagnetic cobalt(III) complexes show an irreversible Co(III) -Co(II) redox response and a quasireversible curcuminoid-based reduction near - 1. 45 and - 1. 74 V SCE, respectively, in DMF/ 0. 1 M (Bu 4 N) -Bu-n](ClO 4). The complexes exhibit a curcuminimitocurcumin-based absorption band near 420 nm. Complex 1 was structurally characterized by X-ray crystallography. The structure contains the metal in a CoN 2 O 4 distorted octahedral coordination arrangement with curcumin binding {{to the metal}} in its enolic form. Binding to cobalt(III) increases the hydrolytic stability of curcumin. Complex 2, having a dicationic curcuminoid, shows significant cellular uptake and photoinduced cytotoxicity compared to its curcumin analogue 1. The dicationic cobalt(III) complex 2 has significantly better cellular uptake and bioactivity than the neutral species 1. Complex 2 with mitochondrial localization releases the mitocurcumin dye upon exposure to visible light (400 - 700 nm) in human breast cancer MCF- 7 cells through photoreduction of cobalt(III) to cobalt(II). Complex 2 displays a remarkable photodynamic therapy (PDT) effect, giving an IC 50 value of similar to 3. 9 mu M in visible light (400 - 700 nm) in MCF- 7 cells while being much less toxic in the dark (> 50 mu M).
