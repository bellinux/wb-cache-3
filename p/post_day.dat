Using inoculation with live attenuated influ-enza virus (LAIV) as an infection model, we have recently shown that ingestion of sulforaph-ane-containing broccoli sprout homogenates (BSH) reduces markers of viral load in the nose. To investigate the systemic effects of short-term BSH supplementation in the context of LAIV-inoculation, we examined peripheral blood immune cell populations in non-smoking subjects from this study, with a particular focus on NK cells. We carried out a randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled study measuring the effects of BSH (N = 13) or placebo (alfalfa sprout homogenate, ASH; N = 16) on peripheral blood mononuclear cell responses to a stan-dard nasal vaccine dose of LAIV in healthy volunteers.

Twenty-four males performed short- term HA (STHA; five sessions) and long-term HA (LTHA; STHA plus further five sessions) utilizing fixed- intensity (FIXED; workload = 50 % V O 2 peak), continuous isothermic HA [ISOCONT; target rectal temperature (Trec) = 38. 5 °C], or progressive isothermic HA (ISOPROG; target Trec = 38. 5 °C for STHA then target Trec = 39. 0 °C for LTHA).

The use of bedside diaphragmatic US to evaluate motion abnormalities {{was reported in}} small series of children. To evaluate the role of bedside US performed in PCICU by intensivist in detecting occult diaphragm dysfunction after cardiac surgery in children. MethodsProspective analysis of diaphragm US performed from June 2014 till September 2014, in pilot group of children admitted to PCICU after cardiac surgery with CXR not suggesting of diaphragm abnormalities. The initial screening was performed by PCICU intensivists and verified by independent blind radiologists. ResultsDuring the study period, 31 PCICU patients were selected to have bedside focus US to assess diaphragm motion. Their average age 15 months and average <b>post</b> <b>day</b> was 5 ± 2 days. Out of 31 selected pilot cases: 4 / 31 had occult diaphragm paresis (12 %). 2 / 31 had Right diaphragm paresis after sternotomy, 1 / 31 Left diaphragm paresis after left thoracotomy, 1 / 31 bilateral diaphragm paresis after redo-sternotomy. Bedside diaphragm US of performed by intensivists was highly sensitive and reliable. ConclusionsBed side critical care US assessment of diaphragms is a simple tool {{that can be easily}} learn and performed by PCICU intensivist. The tool can help in early detection of diaphragm motion abnormality related to cardiac surgery. Early detection can help putting management plan that may involve need for surgery or require prolong positive invasive and non-invasive ventilator support...|$|E
40|$|Chronic aquatic {{treadmill}} (ATM) exercise {{has previously}} been shown to offer similar benefits in cardiovascular health as traditional land treadmill (LTM) exercise with {{the added benefit of}} reduced blood pressure (BP) reactivity and increased skeletal muscle endothelial nitric oxide synthase content. The {{purpose of the present study}} was to determine the acute vascular effects of ATM and LTM exercise on resting, post-exercise, ambulatory BP, flow-mediated dilation (FMD), plasma nitrates/nitrites (NO), and carotid-femoral pulse wave velocity (PWV) in physically untrained, pre-hypertensive men. Following BP screening and a graded exercise test, 19 subjects completed the study (32 ? 12 years, 180 ? 7 cm, 91. 9 ? 24. 4 kg, 38. 2 ? 8. 4 ml?kg^- 1 ?min^- 1, 29. 5 ? 9. 9 % fat, 130 / 78 ? 7 / 8 mmHg). Subjects completed 2, 3 -day acute exercise sequences, one for each exercise mode with 1 - 2 weeks between modes. Whether subjects began with ATM or LTM was randomized and counterbalanced. Each 3 -day sequence included the following: day 1 exercise, day 2 exercise, and day 3 follow-up (3 F). For each exercise day the following measurements were made: pre-exercise ? BP, FMD, PWV, blood; immediately post-exercise (IPE) ? blood; 1 -hour post-exercise ? blood, FMD, PWV. BP was measured following 10 -minutes of seated rest prior to exercise and every 10 minutes from 20 - 60 minute post-exercise. Ambulatory BP was measured following each exercise session. Day 3 F involved only BP, blood, FMD, and PWV measures. A 2 -way repeated measures ANOVA was the primary model of statistical analysis. The specific analyses used for each dependent variable were as follows: 1) resting BP ? 2 (Mode: ATM vs. LTM) x 3 (Day: 1, 2, 3 F); 2) post-exercise blood pressure change and ambulatory blood pressure ? 2 (Mode) x 2 (Day); 3) FMD and PWV ? 2 (Mode) x 5 (Time point: Day 1 Pre, Day 1 <b>Post,</b> <b>Day</b> 2 Pre, Day 2 <b>Post,</b> <b>Day</b> 3 F); 4) change in FMD and PWV ? 2 (Mode) x 3 (Time point: 1, 24, 48 hours post-exercise); 5) plasma nitrates/nitrites ? 2 (Mode) x 7 (Time point: Day 1 Pre, 1 IPE, 1 1 hr, Day 2 Pre, 2 IPE, 2 1 hr, Day 3 F); 6) plasma volume change ? 2 (Mode) x 6 (Time point: Day 1 IPE, 1 1 hr, Day 2 Pre, 2 IPE, 2 1 hr, Day 3 F). While there was a main effect for mode for resting diastolic BP (DBP) and mean arterial pressure (MAP) across the 3 days, these differences existed prior to the first exercise session. There were no differences in the reduction in resting systolic BP, DBP, and MAP (~ 2. 5 mmHg) between modes across the 3 days. There was a main effect for day on resting DBP (Day 1 : 74. 2 mmHg, Day 2 : 72. 2 mmHg, Day 3 F: 72. 0 mmHg) and MAP (Day 1 : 91. 5 mmHg, Day 2 : 90. 3 mmHg, Day 3 F: 89. 5 mmHg), indicating a reduction in resting BP following the exercise sessions. Neither ambulatory BP (136 / 78 mmHg) nor post-exercise BP (~ 2 mmHg reduction in SBP) differed between mode or exercise day. There was a trend for a mode specific difference (p = 0. 076) for a greater FMD response for ATM. FMD increased from ATM 1 pre-exercise (6. 5 ? 3. 9 %) to ATM 1 1 -hour post-exercise (7. 4 ? 4. 7 %) and ATM 1 24 -hour post-exercise (7. 4 ? 4. 3 %), although there were no differences in plasma nitrates/nitrites. Overall these results demonstrate that acute ATM exercise offers similar BP benefits as LTM exercise with the potential for enhanced FMD and improved endothelial function. These data support the efficacy of ATM as an exercise modality to benefit cardiovascular health and mitigate disease risk...|$|E
40|$|Genetic {{selections}} currently {{utilized in}} the poultry industry have been highly successful in promoting broiler growth rate and yield. However, these selections {{may have come}} at the expense of broiler physiology, as evidenced by an increase in physiological disorders. To address this experimentation was undergone to develop a novel method of selection to promote growth with minimal physiological impact and to assess how a new embryonic technique affects growth in broiler lines exhibiting different growth rates. In the first experiment, a random bred control (RAN) broiler line was divergently selected for four-day relative breast yield (BY 4) resulting in the high (HBY 4) and low (LBY 4) BY 4 lines. Selection resulted in clear divergence in BY 4 of the HBY 4 and LBY 4 lines over four generations. This was made possible by the high heritabilities calculated for breast weight relative to live weight in both the HBY 4 and LBY 4 lines. Furthermore, BY 4 selections were capable of impacting embryonic development. In the second experiment, multiple hatches were obtained from selected generation three broiler breeders from the HBY 4, LBY 4 and unselected RAN lines. Hatches were used to examine correlated responses to selection during a traditional growout period. Results indicate that selection for BY 4 was capable of promoting breast percentage at processing age with the HBY 4 having a greater breast yield than the LBY 4 at 42 and 56 days of age. Furthermore, this change occurred at minimal expense to broiler fitness and with no impact on broiler meat quality at processing age. In the third experiment, the effects of thermal manipulation (TM) on broiler embryos from two broiler strains expressing differing rates of growth. TM was effective in promoting early growth in both strains compared to their control counterparts, but <b>post</b> <b>Day</b> 35 no difference in body weight was shown between TM and CTRL strains. However, at Day 42 differences in breast percentage between TM and CTRL strains approached significance with TM strains having a greater breast percentage than their CTRL counterparts at 60 days of age. The improved body composition was not accompanied by changes in meat quality parameters between CTRL and TM broilers. Results indicate that TM can be used to improve body composition without impacting meat quality...|$|E
