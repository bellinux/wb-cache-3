5|$|Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) allows data <b>packets</b> to be {{used for}} {{synchronous}} voice communications. The data <b>packets</b> are marked as voice type <b>packets</b> and can be prioritized by the network administrators so that the real-time, synchronous conversation is less subject to contention with other types of data traffic which can be delayed (i.e. file transfer or email) or buffered in advance (i.e. audio and video) without detriment. That prioritization is fine when the network has sufficient capacity for all the VoIP calls taking {{place at the same time}} and the network is enabled for prioritization i.e. a private corporate style network, but the Internet is not generally managed in this way and so there can be a big difference in the quality of VoIP calls over a private network and over the public Internet.|$|E
5|$|At the {{transport}} layer, most communication adopts either the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) or the User Datagram Protocol (UDP). TCP is used {{when it is}} essential every message sent is received by the other computer whereas UDP is used when it is merely desirable. With TCP, <b>packets</b> are retransmitted if they are lost and placed in order before they are presented to higher layers. With UDP, <b>packets</b> are not ordered or retransmitted if lost. Both TCP and UDP <b>packets</b> carry port numbers with them to specify what application or process the packet should be handled by. Because certain application-level protocols use certain ports, network administrators can manipulate traffic to suit particular requirements. Examples are to restrict Internet access by blocking the traffic destined for a particular port or to affect the performance of certain applications by assigning priority.|$|E
30|$|In {{heterogeneous}} networks, {{the outgoing}} <b>packet</b> type {{might be different}} from the incoming <b>packet</b> type. <b>Packet</b> conversion occurs when an outgoing <b>packet</b> must be transmitted to a neighbor that is associated with a different <b>packet</b> type. When <b>packet</b> conversion is required, the <b>packet</b> facade is used to create a new <b>packet</b> of the correct type. Next, the <b>packet</b> facade extracts all <b>packet</b> attributes from the original <b>packet</b> (thus dismantling the original <b>packet).</b> Finally, the <b>packet</b> facade is used to add all extracted <b>packet</b> attributes to the newly created <b>packet.</b> The conversion process is fully transparent for the network protocols: the network protocols cannot distinguish the new <b>packet</b> from the original <b>packet.</b>|$|R

The detectives contacted nearby Earl May stores to find if any employees remembered selling castor beans, which are out of season in the fall. A clerk in Missouri recalled that in September a woman had ordered ten <b>packets</b> of the out-of-season seeds and explained that she needed them for schoolwork. The clerk gave a description of the buyer that corresponded to Green, and tentatively identified her in a photo line-up as the buyer.

40|$|A {{system and}} method manages Radio Access Network (RAN) {{resources}} to service <b>packet</b> data transmissions at Service Quality Levels (SQL) commensurate with <b>packet</b> data network SQLs. A <b>Packet</b> Data Serving Node (PDSN) receives a data <b>packet</b> from a coupled <b>packet</b> data network.

30|$|We use {{bi-directional}} network coding at {{the center}} node, where network coding is applied for two bi-directional packets—a header <b>packet</b> in the queue of the center node and an opposite <b>packet.</b> The opposite <b>packet</b> is sent by the opposite node of the header <b>packet’s</b> transmitter. For example, when node n 1 and n 5 are bi-directional pair, node n 1 sends <b>packet</b> X 1 to the center node in time slot 1, node n 5 sends <b>packet</b> X 5 to the center node in time slot 2, and the center node broadcasts coded <b>packet</b> (X 1 XOR X 5) in time slot 3.
