5|$|Cartilaginous fish (sharks and rays) {{have a more}} {{advanced}} immune system. They have three specialized organs that are unique to Chondrichthyes; the epigonal organs (lymphoid tissue similar to mammalian bone) that surround the gonads, the Leydig's organ {{within the walls of}} their esophagus, and a spiral valve in their intestine. These organs house typical immune cells (granulocytes, lymphocytes and <b>plasma</b> <b>cells).</b> They also possess an identifiable thymus and a well-developed spleen (their most important immune organ) where various lymphocytes, <b>plasma</b> <b>cells</b> and macrophages develop and are stored.|$|E
5|$|Activated B cells {{differentiate}} {{into either}} antibody-producing cells called <b>plasma</b> <b>cells</b> that secrete soluble antibody or memory cells that {{survive in the}} body for years afterward {{in order to allow}} the immune system to remember an antigen and respond faster upon future exposures.|$|E
5|$|In the jawless fish (lampreys and hagfish), true lymphoid {{organs are}} absent. These fish rely on regions of lymphoid tissue within other organs to produce immune cells. For example, erythrocytes, macrophages and <b>plasma</b> <b>cells</b> are {{produced}} in the anterior kidney (or pronephros) and {{some areas of the}} gut (where granulocytes mature.) They resemble primitive bone marrow in hagfish.|$|E

50|$|Terms such as <b>plasma</b> <b>cell</b> gingivostomatitis, {{atypical}} gingivostomatitis and idiopathic gingivostomatitis {{are sometimes}} {{a synonym for}} <b>plasma</b> <b>cell</b> gingivitis, or specifically {{to refer to a}} severe form of <b>plasma</b> <b>cell</b> gingivitis.|$|R
5|$|The viral {{infection}} that causes croup leads to {{swelling of the}} larynx, trachea, and large bronchi due to infiltration of white blood cells (especially histiocytes, lymphocytes, <b>plasma</b> <b>cells,</b> and neutrophils). Swelling produces airway obstruction which, when significant, leads to dramatically increased work of breathing and the characteristic turbulent, noisy airflow known as stridor.|$|E
5|$|Antibodies are protein {{components}} of an {{adaptive immune system}} whose main function is to bind antigens, or foreign substances in the body, and target them for destruction. Antibodies can be secreted into the extracellular environment or anchored in the membranes of specialized B cells known as <b>plasma</b> <b>cells.</b> Whereas enzymes are limited in their binding affinity for their substrates by the necessity of conducting their reaction, antibodies have no such constraints. An antibody's binding affinity to its target is extraordinarily high.|$|E
5|$|Antibodies are {{secreted}} by B {{cells of}} the adaptive immune system, mostly by differentiated B cells called <b>plasma</b> <b>cells.</b> Antibodies can occur in two physical forms, a soluble form that is secreted from the cell to be free in the blood plasma, and a membrane-bound form that {{is attached to the}} surface of a B cell and {{is referred to as the}} B-cell receptor (BCR). The BCR is found only on the surface of B cells and facilitates the activation of these cells and their subsequent differentiation into either antibody factories called <b>plasma</b> <b>cells</b> or memory B cells that will survive in the body and remember that same antigen so the B cells can respond faster upon future exposure. In most cases, interaction of the B cell with a T helper cell is necessary to produce full activation of the B cell and, therefore, antibody generation following antigen binding. Soluble antibodies are released into the blood and tissue fluids, as well as many secretions to continue to survey for invading microorganisms.|$|E
50|$|<b>Plasma</b> <b>cell</b> {{gingivitis}} {{is a rare}} condition, {{appearing as}} generalized erythema (redness) and edema (swelling) of the attached gingiva, occasionally accompanied by cheilitis (lip swelling) or glossitis (tongue swelling). It is called <b>plasma</b> <b>cell</b> gingivitis where the gingiva (gums) are involved, <b>plasma</b> <b>cell</b> cheilitis, where the lips are involved, and other terms such as <b>plasma</b> <b>cell</b> orifacial mucositis, or <b>plasma</b> <b>cell</b> gingivostomatitis where several sites in the mouth are involved.

5|$|In the 1920s, Michael Heidelberger and Oswald Avery {{observed}} that antigens could be precipitated by antibodies {{and went on}} to show that antibodies are made of protein. The biochemical properties of antigen-antibody-binding interactions were examined in more detail in the late 1930s by John Marrack. The next major advance was in the 1940s, when Linus Pauling confirmed the lock-and-key theory proposed by Ehrlich by showing that the interactions between antibodies and antigens depend more on their shape than their chemical composition. In 1948, Astrid Fagreaus discovered that B cells, in the form of <b>plasma</b> <b>cells,</b> were responsible for generating antibodies.|$|E
5|$|A B cell {{identifies}} pathogens when antibodies on {{its surface}} bind to a specific foreign antigen. This antigen/antibody complex is {{taken up by the}} B cell and processed by proteolysis into peptides. The B cell then displays these antigenic peptides {{on its surface}} MHC class II molecules. This combination of MHC and antigen attracts a matching helper T cell, which releases lymphokines and activates the B cell. As the activated B cell then begins to divide, its offspring (<b>plasma</b> <b>cells)</b> secrete millions of copies of the antibody that recognizes this antigen. These antibodies circulate in blood plasma and lymph, bind to pathogens expressing the antigen and mark them for destruction by complement activation or for uptake and destruction by phagocytes. Antibodies can also neutralize challenges directly, by binding to bacterial toxins or by interfering with the receptors that viruses and bacteria use to infect cells.|$|E
5|$|Ferraro {{had felt}} unusually tired {{at the end}} of her second senate campaign. In , she was {{diagnosed}} with multiple myeloma, a form of blood cancer where <b>plasma</b> <b>cells</b> secrete abnormal antibodies known as Bence-Jones proteins, which can cause bones to disintegrate and dump toxic amounts of calcium into the bloodstream. She did not publicly disclose the illness until , when she went to Washington to successfully press in Congressional hearings for passage of the Hematological Cancer Research Investment and Education Act. A portion of the Act created the Geraldine Ferraro Cancer Education Program, which directs the U.S. Secretary of Health and Human Services to establish an education program for patients of blood cancers and the general public. Ferraro became a frequent speaker on the disease, and an avid supporter and honorary board member of the Multiple Myeloma Research Foundation.|$|E
40|$|Primary <b>plasma</b> <b>cell</b> leukemia (PCL) {{is a rare}} <b>plasma</b> <b>cell</b> disorder, {{and current}} {{knowledge}} regarding survival in this disease is limited to small series of patients.

The incidence of adverse prognostic factors is significantly higher in PCL versus MM. Although similar,PCL exhibits distinct clinical,immunophenotypic and cytogenetic features that distinguish it from MM.

25|$|The high {{prevalence}} of IgA in mucosal areas {{is a result}} of a cooperation between <b>plasma</b> <b>cells</b> that produce polymeric IgA (pIgA), and mucosal epithelial cells that express an immunoglobulin receptor called the polymeric Ig receptor (pIgR). pIgA is released from the nearby activated <b>plasma</b> <b>cells</b> and binds to pIgR. This results in transportation of IgA across mucosal epithelial cells and its cleavage from pIgR for release into external secretions.|$|E
25|$|<b>Plasma</b> <b>cells</b> are {{short-lived}} cells (2–3 days) that secrete antibodies. These antibodies bind to antigens, {{making them}} easier targets for phagocytes, and trigger the complement cascade. About 10% of <b>plasma</b> <b>cells</b> survive to become long-lived antigen-specific memory B cells. Already primed to produce specific antibodies, these cells {{can be called}} upon to respond quickly if the same pathogen re-infects the host, while the host experiences few, if any, symptoms.|$|E

25|$|The {{production}} of free immunoglobulin light chains in normal individuals is approximately 500mg/day from bone marrow and lymph node cells. There is approximately 40% excess immunoglobulin light-chain production over immunoglobulin heavy-chain synthesis. Possibly {{this is simply}} to allow proper conformation of the intact immunoglobulin molecules, but an immunological role for the free light chains has also been proposed. There are approximately twice as many kappa-producing <b>plasma</b> <b>cells</b> as lambda <b>plasma</b> <b>cells.</b> Kappa free-light chains are normally monomeric, while lambda free-light chains tend to be dimeric, joined by disulphide bonds.

40|$|STAT {{family members}} have been implicated in {{regulating}} the balance between B cell lymphoma (BCL) 6 and B lymphocyte induced maturation protein (BLIMP) 1 to control <b>plasma</b> <b>cell</b> differentiation. We previously showed that STAT 5 induces BCL 6 to block <b>plasma</b> <b>cell</b> differentiation and extend {{the life span of}} human B cells. The heterogeneity in STAT activation by cytokines and their effects on B cell differentiation prompted us to investigate the effect of STAT 3 activation in <b>plasma</b> <b>cell</b> differentiation. First stimulation with IL- 21, which promotes <b>plasma</b> <b>cell</b> differentiation, induced robust and prolonged STAT 3 activation in primary human B cells. We then investigated effects of direct STAT 3 activation on regulation of <b>plasma</b> <b>cell</b> genes, cellular phenotype, and Ig production. Activation of a tamoxifen-regulated STAT 3 -estrogen receptor fusion protein triggered BLIMP 1 mRNA and protein up-regulation, <b>plasma</b> <b>cell</b> phenotypic features, and Ig secretion. When STAT 3 was activated by IL- 21 in B cells ectopically expressing BCL 6, BLIMP 1 was up-regulated, but only partial <b>plasma</b> <b>cell</b> differentiation was achieved. Lastly, through coexpression of BCL 6 and STAT 3 -ER, we verified that STAT 3 activation functionally mimicked IL- 21 treatment and that STAT 3 -mediated BLIMP 1 up-regulation occurred despite high BCL 6 expression levels indicating that BCL 6 is not the dominant repressor of BLIMP 1. Thus, up-regulation of BLIMP 1 alone is not sufficient for differentiation of primary human B <b>cells</b> into <b>plasma</b> cells; concomitant down-regulation of BCL 6 is absolutely required for completion of the <b>plasma</b> <b>cell</b> differentiation progra...|$|R

25|$|The {{antibodies}} to tissue transglutaminase follow a complex pathway of generation. For most antigens, T-cells specific to those antigens develop; for autoimmunity, either autoreactive T-cells are not suppressed, or antigens escape the protective process.
