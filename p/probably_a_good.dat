When Tiana accidentally ruins her costume, Charlotte is kind enough to replace it with one of her own. Out of desperation, Tiana wishes on a star, only to be greeted by a talking frog, who claims to be Prince Naveen. Mistaking her for a princess because of her costume, Naveen {{promises}} to give Tiana the money she needs if she turns him human again by kissing him. After some persuasion, Tiana succumbs, but becomes a frog instead.|$|E
25|$|Pike {{make use}} of the lateral line system to follow the {{vortices}} produced by the perceived prey, and the whirling movement of the spinner is <b>probably</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> way to imitate or exaggerate these. Jerkbaits are also effective and can produce spectacular bites with pike attacking these erratic-moving lures at full speed. For trolling, big plugs or softbaits can be used. Spoons with mirror finishes are very effective when the sun is at a sharp angle to the water in the mornings or evenings because they generate the vibrations previously discussed and cause a glint of reflective sunlight that mimics the flash of white-bellied prey. Most fishermen tend to use small lures, but often that is not advisable because pike have a preference for large prey. When fishing in shallow water for smaller pike, lighter and smaller lures are frequently used. The humble 'woolly bugger' fly is a favourite lure among keen fly fisherman of the southern hemisphere.|$|E

The [...] "fantasy noir", written by Gosling, stars Christina Hendricks, Ben Mendelsohn, and Matt Smith. The film received largely unfavorable reviews. Peter Bradshaw of The Guardian found it [...] "insufferably conceited" [...] and remarked that Gosling had lost [...] "any sense of proportion or humility."

500|$|In {{contrast}} to the acclaim lavished on the song, some of Wilson's pop and rock contemporaries have been tempered in their praise of [...] "Good Vibrations". When asked about the song in 1990, Paul McCartney responded: [...] "I {{thought it was a}} great record. It didn't quite have the emotional thing that Pet Sounds had for me. I've often played Pet Sounds and cried. It's that kind of an album for me." [...] Pete Townshend of the Who was quoted in the 1960s as saying, [...] "'Good Vibrations' was <b>probably</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> record but who's to know? You had to play it about 90 bloody times to even hear what they were singing about." [...] Townshend feared that the single would lead to a trend of overproduction. In a 1966 issue of Arts Magazine, Jonathan King said: [...] "With justification, comments are being passed that 'Good Vibrations' is an inhuman work of art. Computerized pop, mechanized music. Take a machine, feed in various musical instruments, add a catch phrase, stir well, and press seven buttons. It is long and split. ... impressive, fantastic, commercial—yes. Emotional, soul-destroying, shattering—no." [...] In the 2000s, record producer Phil Spector criticized the single for depending too much on tape manipulation, negatively referring to it as an [...] "edit record ... It's like Psycho is a great film, but it's an 'edit film.' Without edits, it's not a film; with edits, it's a great film. But it's not Rebecca ... it's not a beautiful story." ...|$|E
500|$|No Ripcord's Gary McGinley {{stated that}} Femme Fatale [...] "is so synth-led that hearing the simple guitar lines on Criminal and He's About To Lose Me (from the Deluxe Edition) is refreshing." [...] Natalie Shaw of the BBC Online commented that [...] "Criminal" [...] "with its teenage lyrics [...] {{on top of}} a fairytale flute melody and a rhythm so summery it manages to {{completely}} set itself free {{from the rest of the}} album." [...] David Buchanan of Consequence of Sound found that Femme Fatale [...] "is entirely rescued by backtracking to Circus-style material, with Rihanna-esque 'Gasoline', and the Ray Of Light-era Madonna influence in closing song 'Criminal'. Katherine St Asaph of Popdust said that as [...] "a bad-boy track, it at least makes a bit more lyrical sense than 'Judas' and is more vulnerable than her past few singles, which is <b>probably</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> career move." [...] Keith Caufield of Billboard commented that [...] "while some of the lyrics are a teensy clunky at times – [...] is a fitting closer to a nearly-completely excellent album." [...] Los Angeles Times writer Carl Wilson stated that the album's momentum [...] "flags only on the closing 'Criminal', with its formless Renaissance fair flute line and a tempo [...] joyless". Thomas Conner of the Chicago Sun-Times considered [...] "Criminal", along with [...] "Inside Out", [...] "weak mid-tempo fare" [...] songs. Eric R. Danton of the Hartford Courant deemed the song as [...] "an eye-rolling homage to those oh-so-attractive bad boys that good girls lust for in spite of themselves." [...] Stephen Thomas Erlewine, senior editor of Allmusic, called it [...] "a lousy song".|$|E

This is usually something of an inconvenience as Prentiss is met by Archie Hilditch (Tony Gardner, Alex Lowe), a faceless member of the Government, in a deserted location (such as Frank Dobson's campaign headquarters), and told he needs to ruin the popularity of the organisation that he has spent half the programme building up. For example, in one episode they're employed by the government to increase the popularity of the European Union, while also being employed by the Eurosceptic newspaper The Sun to increase sales.
