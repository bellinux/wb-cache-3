30|$|The bench {{tests were}} {{conducted}} at the INPEs’ Aerospace Engineering Division (DEA) laboratory with an Agilent E 8362 B network analyzer, adjusted with a calibration offset to remove {{the effect of the}} cables and their connectors. The measurements of S parameters (basically insertion <b>loss</b> and <b>return</b> <b>loss</b> of the ports) were conducted in two steps. First, we measured the impedance match of the 3 -step circular-to-square waveguide transition using a circular waveguide-to coax adapter with a SMA probe in the place of the Multiple Injector Noise Source Assembly (MINSA) assembly shown in Fig.  2. A <b>return</b> <b>loss</b> of about − 40  dB was found within 200  MHz of the proposed center frequency of 5  GHz. This <b>return</b> <b>loss</b> was accounted for as an additional calibration offset during the measurement of the overall <b>return</b> <b>loss</b> of the OMT. Second, using the above measurement as a calibration offset, we obtained a <b>return</b> <b>loss</b> below − 30  dB for the entire OMT. The measurements for port 1 at 4.9, 5.0, and 5.1  GHz are plotted in Fig.  5 together with simulated profiles for the two possible polarization modes (labelled as S 11 and S 22). Similar <b>return</b> <b>losses</b> were obtained at the SMA probes of the rectangular waveguide-to-coax adapters labelled 10 in Fig.  2. During the tests, all open ports were filled with microwave absorbers. The experimental points became indistinguishable from the simulation curves for these two polarization modes once the tuning back-short was properly adjusted through several iterative steps.|$|R
50|$|One {{measure of}} cable {{manufacturing}} and installation quality is how closely the characteristic impedance adheres to the nominal impedance along its length. Impedance {{changes can be}} caused by variations in geometry along the cable length. In turn, these {{can be caused by}} a faulty manufacturing process or by faulty installation (such as not observing limits on bend radii). Unfortunately, there is no easy, non-destructive method of directly measuring impedance along a cable's length. It can, however, be indicated indirectly by measuring reflections, that is, <b>return</b> <b>loss.</b> <b>Return</b> <b>loss</b> by itself does not reveal much, since the cable design will have some intrinsic <b>return</b> <b>loss</b> anyway due to not having a purely resistive characteristic impedance. The technique used is to carefully adjust the cable termination to obtain as close a match as possible and then to measure the variation of <b>return</b> <b>loss</b> with frequency. The minimum <b>return</b> <b>loss</b> so measured is called the structural <b>return</b> <b>loss</b> (SRL).
