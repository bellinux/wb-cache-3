40|$|At the Iggesund mill {{there are}} several methods and {{equipments}} in laboratory scale that simulate the offset printing process in order to evaluate mottle tendency or ink tack for instance. However, {{it is not possible}} to study the effect of <b>pre-damping</b> prior to printing on these properties, which mostly is the case in industrial printing. The purpose of this work was therefore to develop a method for <b>pre-damp</b> application used prior to laboratory offset printing in order to learn more about the ink/fountain solution/substrate interaction. This method was used to study the effect of <b>pre-damp</b> on ink tack measurements and on water interference mottle tendency in laboratory scale. The initial trials were focused on ink tack measurements without <b>pre-damp</b> in order to achieve knowledge about this type of measurement. The effect of different parameters used within the ink tack measurements was also investigated. The ink tack measurements were rather sensitive to the method of ink distribution procedure, the positioning of the tack disc and the fastening of the paperboard sample. Additionally, the printing speed, the printing pressure and the hold time affected the measurements. However, measurements in the cross direction and the machine direction of the paperboard were compared, and did not show a significant difference. Different levels of tackiness of the ink were also tested. For instance, an ink that previously had caused delamination failure in industrial offset printing showed a relatively high ink tack. Four different paperboard qualities were also compared. The small differences in ink tack between the samples were explained by the differences in coating characteristic resulting in different ink absorption. The same paperboard qualities were also used in an inter-comparison between different laboratories measuring ink tack (Iggesund, STFI and Imerys). The same machine settings and the same type of ink was used in the investigation. Although the four qualities always were ranged in the same order, both the level and the shape of the ink tack curve differed in between the three laboratories. One explanation given was that different tack discs were used in the investigation. The method developed for <b>pre-damp</b> application was based on condensation of a water film on a cooled down metal disc. The effect of the temperature on the metal disc surface (inside a fridge), the dwell time inside a desiccator and the time for condensation in a conditioned room on the amount of water developed on the disc surface was investigated. The amount of water developed and transferred could be related to the resulting print density or transferred ink amount. A lower print density or transferred ink amount implied a larger amount of water applied to the sample. The experiments showed that this procedure is rather uncertain and that the tests are difficult to reproduce. However, a lower temperature of the damp disc inside the fridge in general resulted in a larger amount of water developed onto the disc surface. The <b>pre-damp</b> application was used prior to printing and ink tack measurements. The maximum and the shape of the ink tack curve only changed slightly when using <b>pre-damp</b> in comparison to the measurements without pre- damp. In general, the ink tack curve in the later phase was lowered when using <b>pre-damp,</b> indicating a faster ink setting and drying. This may be attributed to that the viscosity of the ink decreases when blended with water. Another explanation given was that penetration of water into the substrate leads to swelling and consequently a rougher surface and a lower ink tack. A lower amount of ink transferred in some cases may be another explanation. The <b>pre-damp</b> was also applied prior to printing in Prüfbau in mottle evaluations, creating water interference mottle. Two paperboard samples with different levels of performance in industrial printing were compared. The sample with less good performance also appeared worse in this investigation with respect to mottle, both with and without <b>pre-damp</b> before printing. This sample had lower coat weight according to burn out pictures and also a lower contact angle in comparison to the better sample. A correlation was also achieved between the water interference mottle tendency obtained in laboratory printing and in a full scale printing trial, respectively. Only three qualities were included in this investigation. Further experiments must be performed to really see the correlation between these two methods. Validerat; 20101217 (root...|$|R

40|$|A e+/e- linear collider, the Compact Linear Collider (CLIC) {{is under}} design at CERN, aiming {{to explore the}} terascale {{particle}} physics regime. The collider has been optimized at 3 TeV center of mass energy and targets a luminosity of 1034 cm- 2 s- 1. In order to achieve this high luminosity, high intensity bunches with ultra low emittances, in all three planes, are required. The generation of ultra low emittance is achieved in the Damping Rings (DR) complex of the collider. The large input beam emittances, especially the ones coming from the positron source, and the requirement of ultra low emittance production in a fast repetition time of 20 ms, imply that the beam damping is done in two stages.

Recently, a five layer prototype has been built and measurements have commenced. The parasitic elements of the primary and secondary circuits of the prototype have also been measured and these values are compared with predictions. In this paper, initial results of the measurements are described and conclusions are drawn concerning the design of the prototype inductive adder...|$|R
40|$|The Compact Linear Collider (CLIC) {{study is}} {{exploring}} the scheme for an electron-positron collider with high luminosity (10 - 34 – 10 - 35 cm- 2 s- 1) and a nominal centre-of-mass energy of 3 TeV: CLIC would complement LHC physics in the multi-TeV range. The CLIC design relies on <b>Pre-Damping</b> Rings (PDR) and Damping Rings (DR) {{to achieve the}} very low emittance, through synchrotron radiation, needed for the luminosity requirements of CLIC. To limit the beam emittance blow-up due to oscillations, the pulse power modulators for the DR kickers must provide extremely flat, high-voltage pulses: the 2 GHz specification called for a 160 ns duration flat-top of 12. 5 kV, 250 A, with a combined ripple and droop of not more than ± 0. 02 %. In order to meet these demanding specifications, a combination of broadband impedance matching, optimized electrical circuit layout and advanced control techniques is required. A solid-state modulator, the inductive adder, is the most promising approach to meeting the demanding specifications; this topology allows the use of both digital and analogue modulation. This report describes the preliminary design of the inductive adder {{and the use of}} active-filtering control algorithms for achieving the required pulse waveform. The report introduces the components of the inductive adder and presents equations and reasoning for selecting the main components: semiconductor switches, storage capacitors and transformer cores. Dimensioning of the adder stack structure is also covered, for achieving good impedance matching between the adder stack and the load...|$|R
40|$|A {{storage ring}} with tunable {{momentum}} compaction {{has the advantage}} of allowing different RMS bunch lengths to be achieved with similar RF capacity. This is potentially useful for many applications, such as a linear collider damping ring and <b>pre-damping</b> ring where the injected beam has a large energy spread and a large transverse emittance. A tunable bunch length also makes it easier to manipulate single bunch instabilities in commissioning and fine tuning. This paper presents a compact ring design based on a supercell that achieves momentum compaction tunability while maintaining a large dynamic aperture. OVERVIEW Storage rings based on alternating gradient or strong focusing are widely used, and several focusing configurations having been invented and some applied in real ring construction and operation. These include separatedfunction FODO cell, combined function FD-cell, doublebend achromat (DBA), triple-bend achromat (TBA) [1] and theoretical minimum emittance (TME) [2] lattices. In an electron storage ring, an electron will lose energy due to synchrotron radiation in the bending elements. Since synchrotron radiation energy loss is compensated by the RF cavities in the ring, there is a damping effect on the synchrotron oscillation with a corresponding damping time. The synchrotron radiation energy loss {{is in the form of}} randomly emitted photons, and the random quantum excitations, together with the previously mentioned synchrotron radiation damping effect, result in the single-particle equilibrium energy spread and emittance. The equilibrium transverse emittance is achieved when radiation damping is equal to the quantum excitation. The equilibrium transverse emittance in terms of the radiation integrals is given by the following expression (assuming there are only bending magnets in horizontal plane) ...|$|R
40|$|In the {{framework}} of the design study of Future Linear Colliders, the Compact Linear Collider (CLIC) aims for electron-positron collisions with high luminosity at a nominal centre-of-mass energy of 3 TeV. To achieve the luminosity requirements, <b>Pre-Damping</b> Rings (PDRs) and Damping Rings (DRs) are required: they reduce the beam emittance before the beam is accelerated in the main linac. Several injection and extraction systems are needed to inject and extract the beam from the PDRs and DRs. The work of this Thesis consists of the design, fabrication and laboratory tests of the first stripline kicker prototype for beam extraction from the CLIC DRs, although the methodology proposed can be extended to stripline kickers for any low emittance ring. The excellent field homogeneity required, as well as a good transmission of the high voltage pulse through the electrodes, has been achieved by choosing a novel electrode shape. With this new geometry, it has been possible to benefit from all the advantages that the most common shapes introduce separately. Furthermore, a detailed study of the different operating modes of a stripline kicker allowed the beam coupling impedance to be fully characterized at low frequencies. The optimum design of the striplines and their components has been based on studies of impedance matching, field homogeneity, power transmission, beam coupling impedance and manufacturing tolerances. Other studies concerning higher order modes and electrodes heating have been done. The striplines have been manufactured by the spanish company Trinos Vacuum Projects, and laboratory tests without beam have been carried out in order to characterize the striplines. The following tests have been done: power reflection, longitudinal and transverse beam coupling impedance and RF breakdown. Finally, new ideas for further improvement of the performance of future striplines are reported...|$|R
