After Steiger's performance in The <b>Pawnbroker</b> in 1964, in which he played an embittered Jewish Holocaust survivor working as a <b>pawnbroker</b> in New York City, he portrayed an opportunistic Russian politician in David Lean's Doctor Zhivago (1965). In the Heat of the Night (1967) won five Academy Awards, including Best Picture and Best Actor for Steiger, who was lauded for his performance as a Mississippi police chief who learns to respect an African-American officer (Poitier) as they search for a killer. The following year, he played a serial killer of many guises in No Way to Treat a Lady.|$|E

5|$|Patricia Erens {{would use}} the film still of the <b>pawnbroker,</b> claimed by Mirsalis to be Lon Chaney, {{as an example of}} the common depictions of the Jews in her book The Jew in American Cinema. The film is now {{considered}} lost. It is unknown when the film was lost, but if it was in Universal's vaults it would have been deliberately destroyed along with the remaining copies of Universal's silent era films in 1948.|$|E
5|$|Crime and Punishment {{focuses on}} the mental anguish and moral {{dilemmas}} of Rodion Raskolnikov, an impoverished ex-student in Saint Petersburg who formulates and executes a plan to kill an unscrupulous <b>pawnbroker</b> for her cash. Raskolnikov, {{in an attempt to}} defend his actions, argues that with the pawnbroker's money he can perform good deeds to counterbalance the crime, while ridding the world of a vermin. He also commits the murder to test a theory of his that dictates some people are naturally capable of such actions, and even have the right to perform them. Several times throughout the novel, Raskolnikov compares himself with Napoleon Bonaparte and shares his belief that murder is permissible in pursuit of a higher purpose.|$|E
5|$|In 1584 Skarga was {{transferred}} to the new Jesuit College at Kraków. On 26 March 1587 he founded the Polish version of the Mount of Piety, a <b>pawnbroker</b> run as a charity and called in Polish the Bank Pobożny (lit. the Pious Bank). In 1588 the newly elected King Sigismund III Vasa established the new post of court preacher, and Skarga became the first priest to hold it. Skarga became a valued adviser to the King, and Sigismund became so fond of him that when the priest considered retirement, Sigismund rejected this, requesting that he remain at court for as long as possible.|$|E
50|$|Under the old <b>Pawnbrokers</b> Act of 1994, unredeemed pawned items {{would be}} put up for auction by <b>pawnbrokers.</b> Should the auction sale price be higher than the item's valuation, the excess went to the person that pawned the item. The new <b>Pawnbrokers</b> Act repeals the 1994 edition, {{requiring}} <b>pawnbrokers</b> to maintain a minimum paid-up capital of S$2 million for each first branch, and S$1 million for each subsequent branch. A higher security deposit is required with every branch, up from S$20,000.|$|R
50|$|<b>Pawnbrokers</b> {{have often}} been {{associated}} with fencing, though in many jurisdictions, government identification must be shown in order to pawn an item and police regularly check pawnshops for stolen goods and repossess any stolen items. While <b>pawnbrokers</b> do not like this characterization of their business, police efforts have indicated that some <b>pawnbrokers</b> are involved in fencing. Money laundering {{could be described as}} the fencing of currency.|$|R
50|$|While growing up, Pursehouse {{supported}} Sheffield Wednesday. He {{featured on}} Channel 4 television show Posh <b>Pawnbrokers</b> (broadcast 8 May 2015), selling two Krugerrands {{given to him}} by his great uncle to London Road <b>Pawnbrokers</b> in Sheffield for £1,550.|$|R
5|$|The film's {{cast and}} credits were {{unbilled}} {{and very few}} details emerged, but the film has been claimed to have featured Lon Chaney by two scholars. Jon Mirsalis states that Lon Chaney has an unbilled part as a <b>pawnbroker.</b> Michael Blake also notes that Lon Chaney {{had a role in}} the film, but Blake also states that the film had only one reel and lists the production code as 0119. Blake's claim that it was a single reel is the subject of dispute because the release was originally as a two reel production in publications and many advertisements for the film.|$|E
5|$|The role of Mapache went to Emilio Fernández, the Mexican film director, writer, {{actor and}} friend of Peckinpah. Among those {{considered}} to play Dutch Engstrom were Charles Bronson, Jim Brown, Alex Cord, Robert Culp, Sammy Davis Jr., Richard Jaeckel, Steve McQueen, and George Peppard. Ernest Borgnine was cast based on his performance in The Dirty Dozen (1967). Robert Blake was the original choice to play Angel, but he asked for too much money. Peckinpah had seen Jaime Sánchez in Sidney Lumet's film adaptation of The <b>Pawnbroker,</b> was impressed, and demanded he be cast as Angel.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, the Creeper {{goes to a}} pawn {{store to}} buy a brooch for Helen, and kills the <b>pawnbroker</b> (Charles Wagenheim) {{following}} a fight. He later brings the brooch to Helen, who he realizes {{for the first time}} is blind. Hal learns she needs $3,000 for surgery that would restore her eyesight. When Helen tries to touch his face, Hal angrily storms out. He then goes to the Scott residence and demands money from Clifford and Virginia, whom he blames for his disfigurement. Clifford draws a gun and shoots Hal twice in the stomach, but the weakened Hal manages to strangle Clifford to death before escaping with Virginia's jewels. He brings them to Helen, who is concerned about Hal's injuries, but he flees before she can learn he is shot.|$|E

5|$|Raskolnikov's dreams have a {{symbolic}} meaning, which suggests a psychological view. The {{dream of the}} mare being whipped has been suggested as the fullest single expression of the whole novel, symbolizing gratification and punishment, contemptible motives and contemptible society, depicting the nihilistic destruction of an unfit mare, the gratification therein, and Rodion's disgust and horror, {{as an example of}} his conflicted character. Raskolnikov's disgust and horror is central to the theme of his conflicted character, his guilty conscience, his contempt for society, his rationality of himself as an extraordinary man above greater society, holding authority to kill, and his concept of justified murder. His reaction is pivotal, provoking his first taking of life toward the rationalization of himself as above greater society. The dream is later mentioned when Raskolnikov talks to Marmeladov. Marmeladov's daughter, morally chaste and devout Sonya, must earn a living as a prostitute for their impoverished family, the result of his alcoholism. The dream is also a warning, foreshadowing an impending murder and holds several comparisons to his murder of the <b>pawnbroker.</b> The dream occurs after Rodion crosses a bridge leading out of the oppressive heat and dust of Petersburg and into the fresh greenness of the islands. This symbolizes a corresponding mental crossing, suggesting that Raskolnikov is returning to a state of clarity when he has the dream. In it, he returns to the innocence of his childhood and watches as a group of peasants beat an old mare to death. After Raskolnikov awakes, he reflects on it as a “such a hideous dream,” the same term he earlier used to describe his plot to kill the old woman (62). This diction draws a parallel between the two, suggesting that the child represents the part of him that clings to morality and watches horrified as another facet, represented by the peasants, is driven by hardship and isolation to become cold and unfeeling. The constant laughing of the peasants in the face of brutal slaughter reveals {{the extent to which they}} have been desensitized by their suffering, which is a reflection of Raskolnikov’s own condition. This interpretation is further supported by fact that the main peasant, Mikolka, feels that he has the right to kill the horse, linking his actions to Raskolnikov’s theory justifying murder for a select group of extraordinary men. The comparison between the cruel slaughter of the old mare and the plan to murder Alyona Ivanovna delineates the brutality of Raskolnikov’s crime, which is often downplayed by his habitual dehumanizing referral to the old woman as simply a “louse.” While awake, Raskolnikov’s view of the old woman is spiteful, defined by his tenacious belief in his extraordinary man theory. However, the dream acts as a conduit for Raskolnikov’s subconscious, and without the constraints of his theory the horrific nature of his crime becomes apparent. Therefore, in order for Raskolnikov to find redemption, he must ultimately renounce his theory.|$|E

25|$|After {{working in}} Shadwell for several years, Nicholson moved to Kensington. There he {{continued}} {{working as a}} <b>pawnbroker</b> until 1830. This occupation exposed him to many lower-class residents of London. In the early 1830s he opened a jewellry store on Regent Street near Leicester Square. He targeted Demimonde customers, whose penchant for conspicuous consumption caused them to frequently patronise jewellers. His business soon failed and he went bankrupt.|$|E
25|$|When his {{apprenticeship}} {{ended in}} 1848, Booth was unemployed {{and spent a}} year looking in vain for work. In 1849, Booth reluctantly left his family and moved to London, where he again found work with a <b>pawnbroker.</b> Booth tried to continue lay preaching in London, but {{the small amount of}} preaching work that came his way frustrated him, and so he resigned as a lay preacher and took to open-air evangelising in the streets and on Kennington Common.|$|E
