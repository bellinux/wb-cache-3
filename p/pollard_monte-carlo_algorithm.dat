40|$|This paper {{presents}} importance sampling <b>Monte-Carlo</b> <b>algorithms</b> for {{the calculation}} of belief functions combination. When {{the conflict between the}} evidence is not very high a simple <b>Monte-Carlo</b> <b>algorithm</b> can produce good quality estimations. For the case of highly conflicting evidences a Markov chain <b>Monte-Carlo</b> <b>algorithm</b> was also proposed. In this paper, a new class of importance sampling based algorithms is presented. The performance of them is compared by experimental tests. 1 INTRODUCTION One of the main drawbacks attributed to DempsterShafer theory [16, 18, 2, 24] is the complexity associated to calculating belief combination using Dempster's rule. The straight-forward application of it is exponential (where the parameters are the size of the frame of discernment and the number of evidences). In fact, the exact calculation is a #P -complete problem [12]. For above reasons it is reasonable to apply approximated algorithms to the problem of belief combination.

To solve the problem of fast adatom dynamics, we allow adatoms to take larger steps, effectively reducing the number of transitions required.

40|$|Several {{works have}} shown that it is {{possible}} to conceive non-linear <b>Monte-Carlo</b> <b>algorithms,</b> but these works have remained overlooked so far. It is commonly admitted that in non-linear physics it is necessary to start with a linearization step before then calling on the linear Monte-Carlo method. We show here how it is possible to avoid this linearization step in the particular case of the Boltzmann equation. Our method retains the exact character of the Monte-Carlo method (unbiased estimation with a reliable evaluation of its uncertainty). We also extend to non-linear transport a very strong property of <b>Monte-Carlo</b> <b>algorithms</b> in linear transport: the ability to perform probe calculus (evaluate a quantity at a given position and time without computing all the field at previous times). Another striking feature of this algorithm is its ability to focus on rare events, however scarce they may be, including very high energy events that are important from the applicative point of view.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we propose new {{algorithm}} to reduce autocorrelation in Markov chain <b>Monte-Carlo</b> <b>algorithms</b> for euclidean field theories on the lattice. Our proposing algorithm is the Hybrid <b>Monte-Carlo</b> <b>algorithm</b> (HMC) with restricted Boltzmann machine. We examine {{the validity of the}} algorithm by employing the phi-fourth theory in three dimension. We observe reduction of the autocorrelation both in symmetric and broken phase as well. Our proposing algorithm provides consistent central values of expectation values of the action density and one-point Green's function with ones from the original HMC in both the symmetric phase and broken phase within the statistical error. On the other hand, two-point Green's functions have slight difference between one calculated by the HMC and one by our proposing algorithm in the symmetric phase. Furthermore, near the criticality, the distribution of the one-point Green's function differs from the one from HMC. We discuss the origin of discrepancies and its improvement.

40|$|International audienceThe aim of {{the paper}} is to {{introduce}} and validate a <b>Monte-Carlo</b> <b>algorithm</b> for the prediction of an ensemble of colliding solid particles, or coalescing liquid droplets, suspended in a turbulent gas flow predicted by Reynolds Averaged Navier Stokes approach (RANS). The new algorithm {{is based on the}} direct discretization of the collision/coalescence kernel derived in the framework of a joint fluid–particle pdf approach proposed by Simonin et al. (2002). This approach allows to take into account correlations between colliding inertial particle velocities induced by their interaction with the fluid turbulence. Validation is performed by comparing the Monte-Carlo predictions with deterministic simulations of discrete solid particles coupled with Direct Numerical Simulation (DPS/DNS), or Large Eddy Simulation (DPS/LES), where the collision/coalescence effects are treated in a deterministic way. Five cases are investigated: elastic monodisperse particles, non-elastic monodisperse particles, binary mixture of elastic particles and binary mixture of elastic settling particles in turbulent flow and finally coalescing droplets.

40|$|International audienceIn this paper, {{we carry}} on {{investigating}} {{the line of}} research questioning the power of randomization {{for the design of}} distributed algorithms. In their seminal paper, Naor and Stockmeyer [STOC 1993] established that, in the context of network computing, in which all nodes execute the same algorithm in parallel, any construction task that can be solved locally by a randomized <b>Monte-Carlo</b> <b>algorithm</b> can also be solved locally by a deterministic algorithm. This result however holds in a specific context. In particular, it holds only for distributed tasks whose solutions that can be locally checked by a deterministic algorithm. In this paper, we extend the result of Naor and Stockmeyer to a wider class of tasks. Specifically, we prove that the same derandomization result holds for every task whose solutions can be locally checked using a 2 -sided error randomized <b>Monte-Carlo</b> <b>algorithm.</b> This extension finds applications to, e. g., the design of lower bounds for construction tasks which tolerate that some nodes compute incorrect values.
