2500|$|Normally, {{only one}} train or piece of {{equipment}} may occupy a given block at a time, and a train must release their authority in a block {{in order for the}} train dispatcher to authorize another train into that block. Barring human error, this ensures that no two trains are ever authorized on any given piece of track at the same time, thereby <b>preventing</b> <b>collisions.</b> (In certain circumstances, dispatchers will authorize more than one {{piece of equipment}}--as in the case of track maintenance vehicles--into the same block. When this occurs, the authority is marked as [...] "joint," [...] and all movements must be made at restricted speed, which allows stopping within half the range of vision.) Another key feature of DTC is that only one authority is in effect for any given train at any given time. When a dispatcher issues a new authority to a train, the previous authority becomes invalid and must not be used.|$|E
