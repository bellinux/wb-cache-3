The status or “health” of the inoculums {{has a great deal}} to do with the success of the production cycle. In this project, inoculums development for the production of monoclonal antibody against Congenital Adrenal Hyperplasia (CAH) was studied. The scopes focused were the age of inoculums (<b>passage</b> <b>number)</b> and inoculums density at different growth phases. A hybridoma cell line (Hybridoma 192) was cultivated in batch mode with varying inoculums cell densities and growth phases using Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM). The maximum viable cell densities and the average specific MAb production rate (rp) were found to dependent on the inoculums cell density and the growth phases. Inoculums with low cell density at 5 X 104 cells/ml and early log phase (t= 28 h) have the highest average specific MAb production rate but a low maximum viable cell density. Varying inoculums cell densites and growth phases did not affect the specific growth rate, maximum MAb titer and net production of MAb. Since the inoculums density in the range of 5 x 104 cells/ml to 5 x 105 cells/ml and growth phase do not affect the net production of MAb, it is wise to use high initial inoculums cell density at 5 x 105 cells/ml because the cell growth easily and faster compare low inoculums density. For the inoculums age, the average specific MAb production rate decreased when the <b>passage</b> <b>number</b> increased from PN (<b>Passage</b> <b>Number)</b> = 9 to PN= 30.

MIN 6 cells, a transformed b-cell line derived from a mouse insulinoma, retain GSIS and are a popular in vitro model for insulin secretion. However, in long-term culture, MIN 6 cells ’ GSIS capacity is lost. We previously isolated a subclone, MIN 6 clone 4, from the parental MIN 6 cells, that shows well-regulated insulin secretion in response to glucose, glybenclamide, and KCl, even after prolonged culture. To investigate the molecular mechanisms responsible for preserving GSIS in this subclone, we compared four groups of MIN 6 cells: Pr-LP (parental MIN 6, low <b>passage</b> <b>number),</b> Pr-HP (parental MIN 6, high <b>passage</b> <b>number),</b> C 4 -LP (MIN 6 clone 4, low <b>passage</b> <b>number),</b> and C 4 -HP (MIN 6 clone 4, high <b>passage</b> <b>number).</b> Based on their capacity for GSIS, we designated the Pr-LP, C 4 -LP, and C 4 -HP cells as ‘‘responder cells. ’ ’ In a DNA microarray analysis, we identified a group of genes with high expression in responder cells (‘‘responder genes’’), but extremely low expression in the Pr-HP cells. Another group of genes (‘‘non-responder genes’’) was expressed at high levels in the Pr-HP cells, but at extremely low levels in the responder cells. Some of the responder genes were involved in secretory machinery or glucose metabolism, including Chrebp, Scgn, and Syt 7. Among the non-responder genes were Car 2, Maf, and Gcg, which are not normally expressed in islet b cells. Interestingly, we found {{a disproportionate number of}} known imprinted genes among the responder genes. Our findings suggest that the global expression profiling of GSIS...|$|E

Previous experimental studies report that cell characteristics evolve as the <b>passage</b> <b>number</b> increases, and various cell lines can behave differently at high passage numbers. To {{provide insight into the}} putative mechanisms that might give rise to these differences, we perform in silico experiments using a random walk model to mimic the in vitro cell culture process.

To extend the model to investigate longer-term processes, primary cultures (P 0) were passaged for up to four generations (P 1 –P 4). hPT cells retained epithelial morphology and stained positively for cytokeratins through P 4, although cell growth and proliferation successively slowed with each passage. Necrotic cell death due to the model oxidants tert-butyl hydroperoxide (tBH) and methyl vinyl ketone (MVK) increased with increasing <b>passage</b> <b>number,</b> whereas that due to the selective nephrotoxicant S-(1, 2 -dichlorovinyl) -l-cysteine (DCVC) was modest and did not change with <b>passage</b> <b>number.</b> Mitochondrial activity was lower in P 2 –P 4 cells than in either P 0 or P 1 cells.

In the allogeneic studies, the degree of cytotoxicity was significantly influenced by the age in culture (<b>passage</b> <b>number)</b> of the synovial target cells (P less than 0. 001). When the <b>passage</b> <b>number</b> of the target cells was considered in the analysis, rheumatoid lymphocytes {{were found to have}} greater cytotoxic activity than normal lymphocytes against young cultures (low <b>passage</b> <b>number)</b> of both RA and non-RA synovial cells (P = 0. 0042).

Although the data demonstrated an increased cytotoxic activity of peripheral blood lymphocytes from some RA patients against allogeneic synovial cells, the fact that this reactivity was seen against both non-RA and RA synovial cells and was not demonstrated against autologous synovial cells argues against the presence of an immunospecific response of RA lymphocytes to RA synovial cell antigens...|$|E

Two hTERT-transduced placenta-derived MSC cell lines, CMSC 29 and DMSC 23 [derived from placental chorionic villi (CMSCs) and decidua basalis (DMSCs), respectively], were used to prepare dECM-coated substrates. These dECM substrates showed structural and biochemical differences.

Primary CMSCs cultured on the dECM-DMSC 23 exhibited a two-fold increase in cell number and increased osteogenic differentiation.

40|$|Introduction & Objective: Stem {{cells are}} {{determined}} by their unique features. One of them is high proliferation ability {{and the other is}} potency of differentiation to various tissues. The results of new works in various countries around the world including Iran show the growing momentum of works on stem cell therapy. Working with stem cells from different origins including the cells originated from fetal and adult origin (such as bone marrow, dental root, cord, etc) is in progress. The goal of this work was to clear the maintenance and stability of genetic materials of human mesenchymal stem cells through consecutive subcultures in our lab conditions in Hamadan Uni-versity of Medical Sciences. Materials & Methods: In an experimental work, human umbilical cord was used as a rich source of stem cells. Isolated stem cells, after proliferation phase, increased and filled the bottom of the flasks in consecutive passages. After some successive consecutive subcultures, stem cells aged and this may cause damages to genetic material that is evaluated in primary <b>passages</b> (<b>passages</b> <b>number</b> 1 - 5), middle <b>passages</b> (<b>passages</b> <b>number</b> 8 - 12) and late <b>passages</b> (<b>passages</b> <b>number</b> 15 - 18) by the single cell gel electrophoresis assay (comet assay). Also their karyotypes were ex-amined; Solid technique and G-banding staining for chromosome analysis in the stem cells were employed. Several microscopic slides from each passage were prepared. Then 20 cells were ran-domly selected from the slides related to each group. In all selected cells, damages were exam-ined and their degree of damages were scored based on the standard patterns, from 0 to 4. The averages were compared by Kruskal–Wallis test in different groups. Results: Average scores related to three studied cell groups, primary, middle and late passages, were 0. 4, 2. 8 and 3. 6, respectively. Prepared karyotypes from the cells belonging to passages 1 - 5 were normal but in the aged passages they were abnormal numerically and structurally. Our re-sults showed that the aging phenomenon and its consequences such as DNA damages should be considered in the work with consecutive passages of stem cells. Conclusion : We concluded that in our laboratory conditions, the stem cells taken from human umbilical cord blood are only usable for research purposes in early passages (below passage five). We recommend using passages more than five only for educational purposes in our labora-tory; and it is better to do the same work in such research centers.

[3 H]Thymidine incorporation and epidermal growth factor receptor (EGF-R) binding were measured as parameters related to the proliferative response of the cells. The secretion of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) and the mRNA expression of PSA, prostatic acid phosphatase (PAP), and diazepam-binding inhibitor (DBI) were used as parameters reflecting differentiated function. Marked differences were noted in the response of LP and HP cells to androgens. [3 H]Thymidine incorporation displayed a bell-shaped dose-response curve in both strains. The amplitude of the response, however, was much higher in HP cells and growth inhibition at high levels of R 1881 was only observed in LP cells. On the contrary, androgen induction of PSA secretion and PSA mRNA expression, {{as well as the}} expression of PAP was much more pronounced in LP cells, whereas DBI expression was not altered according to <b>passage</b> <b>number.</b> LP cells and HP cells also displayed striking differences in their response to atRA. An up to 6 -fold stimulation of [3 H]thymidine incorporation was observed in LP cells, whereas in HP cells the only significant effect was growth inhibition. VD 3, on the contrary, inhibited [3 H]thymidine incorporation to a comparable degree in LP and HP cells. Only marginal effects of atRA and VD 3 were observed on PSA secretion. In both LP and HP cells EGF-R levels were increased by androgens and to a slight extent also by atRA and VD 3. It is concluded that LP and HP LNCaP cells display markedly divergent responses not only to androgens but also to atRA. The proliferative rather than antiproliferative effects of atRA in some strains of LNCaP should caution against the uncontrolled use of these agents, or of drugs affecting their metabolism, in patients with prostate cancer. status: publishe...|$|E

High P-gp expressing Caco- 2 cells have been developed through stepwise selection of the cells with doxonibicin. This newly-developed cell line (hereafter referred to as Type I) possesses approximately twice as much P-gp protein than non-exposed cells, restricts the transepithelial transport of vincristine in the apical-to-basolateral direction whilst facilitating its transport in the reverse direction and accumulates less vincristine than non-exposed cells. There is no apparent evidence of the co-existence of the multidrug resistance protein (MIT) in Type I cells {{to account for the}} above-listed observations. Stopping the exposure for more than 28 days decreases the P-gp protein expression in previously doxorubicin-exposed Type I Caco- 2 cells and reduces the magnitude of vincristine transepithelial fluxes in both directions to the levels that are almost similar to those of non-exposed cells. Exposing Caco- 2 cells to 0. 25 JAM la, 25 -dihydroxyvitamin D 3 induces their expression of cytochrome P 450 3 A 4 protein to the level that is equivalent to that from isolated human jejunal cells.
