[...] Concerned that the marginalized sector should not be denied access to government frontline services and public meetings based on their attire, she sponsored the Open Door Policy Act (House Bill No. 6286), which prohibits government offices and agencies from implementing strict dress codes.|$|E

40|$|<b>Participatory</b> {{environmental}} <b>governance</b> {{is increasing}} worldwide. One area where such governance forms are apparent {{is in the}} management of water resources. For example, in the European Union the Water Framework Directive mandates several forms of involvement via its legal obligations. Under the Directive, implementing agencies should provide information on river basin management planning to the public, consult citizens and stakeholders during planning and actively involve interested parties in the plan process. Yet questions arise over the success of participatory processes on the ground in EU member states. In this study, participation was therefore evaluated in WFD river basin planning in England and Wales using process, community, output and outcome-related indicators. Research was conducted through extensive quantitative and qualitative data collection over a long temporal scale within case analyses of the Anglian, Humber and South West river basin districts. Results suggest that while the first phase of river basin management largely met legal requirements, the actual success of <b>participatory</b> water <b>governance</b> was mixed. On this basis, recommendations are made for enhancing participation in future river basin planning through national and EU policy...|$|R

40|$|Participatory {{arrangements}} {{have become}} a popular way of addressing modern challenges of urban governance but in practice face several constraints and can trigger deep tensions. Facilitative leadership can {{play a crucial role}} in enabling collaboration among local stakeholders despite plural and often conflictual interests. Surprisingly, this style of leadership has received limited attention within debates linking urban <b>governance</b> and <b>participatory</b> democracy. We summarize the main insights of the literature on facilitative leadership and empirically develop them in the context of <b>participatory</b> urban <b>governance</b> by comparing recent participatory processes in two Italian cities. Whereas in one city facilitative leadership gradually emerged and successfully transformed a deep conflict into consensual proposals, in the other city, participatory planning further exacerbated pre-existing antagonism, and local democratic culture was only later slowly reinvigorated through bottom-up initiative. These diverging pathways explain how facilitative leadership is: (1) important for making things happen; (2) best understood as situated practices; (3) an emergent property of the practices and interactions of a number of local actors and (4) a democratic capacity for dealing with continuous challenges. Key to this style of leadership is understanding <b>participatory</b> urban <b>governance</b> as an ongoing democratic process...|$|R

40|$|Brazilian {{cities have}} been the sites of {{significant}} experiments in <b>participatory</b> and deliberative <b>governance.</b> <b>Participatory</b> budgeting has to be singled out {{as one of the}} most important of these. After the landmark experience in Porto Alegre, participatory budgeting has been expanded to 170 Brazilian cities. Is the expansion of participatory budgeting equivalent to the expansion of the deliberative and distributive characteristics of the Porto Alegre experience? This article argues that the conditions that account for the emergence of participatory budgeting in Porto Alegre are unique to that city's social or political characteristics. It focuses on the role of existing civil society associations in the emergence of participatory budgeting, as well as in its institutional format. It also shows that the presence of civic associations is linked to the deliberative and distributive results of participatory budgeting and that these conditions may not be present in other participatory budgeting experiences.

The Government has planned several {{water resources}} development project and due to their complex technical, socio-economical, and environmental outcomes, comprehensive evaluation is needed. To select more adaptive and accountable projects, suitable group decision support systems are also required. In this research four proposed routes of water transfer schemes to the critical drying Lake Urmia in Iran are evaluated with respect to the different criteria. The criteria and their weights are obtained from an organization that is responsible for major water infrastructures in the basin. By using efficient group multi-criteria decision making method, the four alternatives are ranked and the most robust water transfer route is selected.
