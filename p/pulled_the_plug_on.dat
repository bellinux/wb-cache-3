25|$|In 1980, the TV program Barbara Mandrell and the Mandrell Sisters premiered on NBC. In {{addition}} to hosts Barbara, Louise, and Irlene, the show featured musical guests and comedy sketches. Each broadcast also {{closed with a}} gospel song, which led to Mandrell recording her own inspirational album, He Set My Life to Music (1982). As {{a result of her}} busy schedule, she began suffering from vocal strain, and on doctor's orders, <b>pulled</b> <b>the</b> <b>plug</b> <b>on</b> the television program in 1982. (Variety shows were also falling out of favor at the time; the series was NBC's last variety series to date.) She received one award (People's Choice) and two nominations (Golden Globe and TV Land Award) for her work on the show. In 1983, she premiered The Lady Is a Champ, a Las Vegas stage show.|$|E
25|$|Thompson was {{to provide}} Rolling Stone with {{coverage}} for the 1976 presidential campaign that would appear in a book published by the magazine. Reportedly, as Thompson was waiting for a $75,000 advance check to arrive, he learned that Rolling Stone publisher Jann Wenner had cancelled the assignment without informing him. Wenner then asked Thompson to travel to Vietnam to report on {{what appeared to be}} the closing of the Vietnam War. Thompson accepted, and left for Saigon immediately. He arrived with the country in chaos, just as South Vietnam was collapsing and other journalists were scrambling to find transportation out of the region. While there, Thompson learned that Wenner had <b>pulled</b> <b>the</b> <b>plug</b> <b>on</b> this excursion as well, and Thompson found himself in Vietnam without health insurance or additional financial support. Thompson's story about the fall of Saigon would not be published in Rolling Stone until ten years later. These two incidents severely strained the relationship between the author and the magazine, and Thompson contributed far less to the publication in later years.|$|E

25|$|In 1983, Scorsese {{began work}} on a long-cherished {{personal}} project, The Last Temptation of Christ, based on the 1951 novel written by Nikos Kazantzakis that retold the life of Christ in human rather than divine terms. Barbara Hershey recalls introducing Scorsese to the book while they were filming Boxcar Bertha. The film was slated to shoot under the Paramount Pictures banner, but shortly before principal photography was to commence, Paramount <b>pulled</b> <b>the</b> <b>plug</b> <b>on</b> the project, citing pressure from religious groups. In this aborted 1983 version, Aidan Quinn was cast as Jesus, and Sting was cast as Pontius Pilate. (In the 1988 version, these roles were played respectively by Willem Dafoe and David Bowie.) However, following his mid-1980s flirtation with commercial Hollywood, Scorsese made a major return to personal filmmaking with the project, which was ultimately released in 1988. Even prior to its release, the film (adapted by Taxi Driver and Raging Bull veteran Paul Schrader) caused a massive furor, with worldwide protests against its perceived blasphemy effectively turning a low-budget independent film into a media sensation. Most controversy centered on the final passages of the film, which depicted Christ marrying and raising a family with Mary Magdalene in a Satan-induced hallucination while on the cross.|$|E
500|$|In April 1969 Davies helped {{negotiate}} {{an end to}} the American Federation of Musician ban on the group, {{which allowed}} plans for a North American tour. Davies went into a state of depression, culminating in his onstage announcement that he was [...] "sick of it all" [...] at a gig in White City Stadium. A review of the concert published in Melody Maker stated: [...] "Davies swore on stage. He stood at The White City and swore that he was 'F...... sick of the whole thing'... He was 'Sick up to here with it'... and those that heard shook their heads. Mick just ventured a disbelieving smile, and drummer on through 'Waterloo Sunset. Davies proceeded to try to announce that the Kinks were breaking up, but this attempt was foiled by the group's publicity management, who <b>pulled</b> <b>the</b> <b>plug</b> <b>on</b> the microphone system.|$|E
500|$|Speculation {{arose in}} 2003 of a {{spin-off}} film concentrating on Jinx, which {{was scheduled for}} a November/December 2004 release. It was originally reported that MGM was keen {{to set up a}} film series that would be a [...] "winter olympics" [...] alternative to 'James Bond'. In the late 1990s, MGM had originally considered developing a spin-off film based on Michelle Yeoh's character, Wai Lin, in 1997's Tomorrow Never Dies. However, despite much speculation of an imminent movie, on 26 October 2003, Variety reported that MGM had completely <b>pulled</b> <b>the</b> <b>plug</b> <b>on</b> this project, to the dismay of Barbara Broccoli and Michael G. Wilson of Eon Productions, who were reported to be [...] "clearly furious" [...] about the decision. MGM was keen to instead move on with the next film, Casino Royale, which went on to feature several recycled ideas originally penned for the cancelled spin-off.|$|E

500|$|... "Worlds Apart" [...] {{received}} generally positive {{reviews from}} television critics. Entertainment Weekly writer Jeff Jensen noted {{that with the}} closing of the bridge, [...] "Fringe effectively <b>pulled</b> <b>the</b> <b>plug</b> <b>on</b> the creative idea that defined the best years of the show. [...] I don't think we can understate the passing of the parallel world premise." [...] While he said he would miss the lost characters, especially Fauxlivia, the series [...] "got the emotions [...] just right." [...] He added his hope that the characters would be revisited. In an interview, Pinckner said that they had spoken to Fox executives about closing off the bridge, to which one executive partner reportedly said, [...] "I was so sad. [...] I had tears in my eyes when we closed the door". The executive added that despite having initially thought the idea of doppelganger characters as a poor one, she admitted that she [...] "was so wrong".|$|E
500|$|Starting in 1984, Timex of Portugal {{developed}} and produced several Timex branded computers, including the Timex Computer 2048, highly {{compatible with the}} Sinclair ZX Spectrum 48K, which was very successful in both Portugal and Poland. An NTSC version was also made, initially intended for a United States release, but it was sold only in Chile and Argentina. Timex of Portugal also made a PAL version of the TS2068, called the Timex Computer 2068 (or TC2068 for short) which had different buffers for both the ULA and the CPU, which significantly increased the compatibility with ZX Spectrum software {{when compared to the}} North American model (the TS2068). The expansion port was also modified and made to be 100% compatible with the ZX Spectrum's, which bypassed the need for a [...] "Twister Board" [...] expansion that the TS2068 needed {{in order to make it}} compatibile with ZX Spectrum expansion hardware. It also had the AY sound output routed to the monitor/TV speakers instead of the internal twitter. The software developed for the TC2068 is completely compatible with the TS2068, since the ROMs weren't altered. Timex of Portugal also developed a ZX Spectrum [...] "emulator" [...] on cartridge form that mapped the first 16kB exactly like the earlier TC2048 computer did. Several other upgrades were made available, including a BASIC64 cartridge that enabled the TC2068 to use high resolution (512x192) modes. Despite having an AY-3-8912 sound chip, it's not connected in the same ports as in the ZX Spectrum 128K, rendering the TC2084 incompatible with the AY sound that the Spectrum 128K games produced. Due to all its advantages compared to the usual TS2068, a North American company, Zebra Systems, licensed the Timex TC2068 and sold it in the United States as the Zebra Silver Avenger. They also sold the FDD 3000 as the Zebra FDD 3000 in a silver case (as opposed to the European black cases) to match their colour scheme. Timex of Portugal was working on a successor to the TC2068 called the TC3256, using a Z80A CPU and featuring 256kB of RAM, which would feature a ZX Spectrum BASIC operating mode and a CP/M operating mode, but the company <b>pulled</b> <b>the</b> <b>plug</b> <b>on</b> its development since that by the end of 1989, the 8bit market was no longer profitable. Only one complete and fully working prototype of the TC3256 was made.|$|E

2500|$|A {{series of}} high-selling albums and world tours {{followed}} through the 1980s, eventually bringing about Ozzy's popularity. In 1996, Osbourne created the Ozzfest summer touring festival. It {{went on to}} become a regular rock occasion and celebrated a 10th anniversary in 2006. By 2007, the ticket prices had reached £76 ($150) and Osbourne announced that the tickets would be free to allow more people the opportunity to attend the concert. Prior to the founding of Ozzfest, Osbourne approached Lollapalooza, another rock/pop festival, to request that Ozzy play at that year's festival, only to be rejected and told that Ozzy was [...] "uncool" [...] and too drugged up. It was then that she decided to launch her own festival. Controversy ensued when she <b>pulled</b> <b>the</b> <b>plug</b> <b>on</b> Iron Maiden's set three times in one performance. She also harassed the singer, Bruce Dickinson, and threw eggs at the band.|$|E

On February 27, 1974, Maryland's Governor Mandel <b>pulled</b> <b>the</b> <b>plug</b> <b>on</b> the idea. Orioles owner Jerold Hoffberger was blunt: [...] "I will bow {{to the will of}} the people. They have told us what they want to tell us. First, they don't want a new park and second, they don't want a club." [...] Robert Irsay was willing to wait. [...] "It's not a matter of saying {{that there will be no}} stadium. It's a matter of getting the facts together so everybody is happy when they build the stadium. I'm a patient man. I think the people of Baltimore are going to see those new stadiums in New Orleans and Seattle opening in a year or two around the country, and they are going to realize they need a stadium ... for conventions and other things besides football." ...|$|E

2500|$|During 1977 and 1978, Rundgren {{attempted}} to tour with a true quadraphonic sound system, however it proved ultimately unworkable – despite successfully delivering high-quality sound in a concert setting – {{due to the}} enormous technical requirements involved. Since most concert arenas of the day were ill-equipped to host large towers of sound equipment {{in the rear of}} the halls, the speakers often had to be hung from the ceiling rigging. This installation could take up to two days to complete, meaning that it was necessary to send two separate sound systems, each with its own, complete set-up crew, out on the road, so that they could [...] "leapfrog" [...] and allow Rundgren to play dates on consecutive days, which would have otherwise been impossible. The system featured a then-new technology called [...] "signal analysis", which required white and pink noise to be pumped through the speakers, in order to set the active equalizers so as to minimize feedback and distortion. The pink and white noise analysis had to be performed twice: once with the hall empty, and then again with the audience present, which many concertgoers found annoying. Additionally, Rundgren's insistence on personally overseeing the acoustic set-up of the system left him exhausted and unable to continue, and he <b>pulled</b> <b>the</b> <b>plug</b> <b>on</b> the experiment.|$|E
2500|$|With {{no major}} {{sponsors}} Bodine received sponsorship from minor sponsors such as Wells Fargo, Timberland Pro, and Dura Lube. [...] Three races {{into the season}} Hooters was signed to a deal, although at this point Bodine's team was already well behind in development. [...] Several {{key members of the}} team, including the crew chief, had left due to worries about being able to run the full season. As part of the deal, Bodine fielded a car from Hooters original driver Kirk Shelmerdine, for a couple of races. But after the team failed to make a race, Shelmerdine and his team splintered. [...] Bodine missed four races during the season and finished 36th in the points. [...] Hooters returned in 2003, but with far less funding than the already small amount they had provided the previous season. Bodine became involved in a difficult time during a divorce from his wife and team co-owner Diane. The dispute lead Bodine to file a restraining order against his wife, whom he alleges hit and threatened to ruin him financially. The domestic violence protective order also required Diane Bodine to stay away from NASCAR tracks where her husband was scheduled to race. [...] At the same time Hooters withdrew sponsorship for the Bodine racing team. Bodine had planned to run a partial schedule, running six events until June, when Hooters <b>pulled</b> <b>the</b> <b>plug</b> <b>on</b> its sponsorship program. In the next race at Michigan, Bodine was seriously injured in a practice accident. [...] The impact was violent, and Bodine suffered a broken collar bone and damaged teeth. [...] He recovered from his injuries and tried again with a one race ride with the struggling Morgan-McClure Motorsports, but the car failed to make the field. [...] With no major sponsorship for his team and most of his employees laid off, Bodine attempted to run at Indy in a fan sponsored [...] "Brick Car" [...] where, for $500, fans would get their name on the car. [...] The program was a success, but Bodine failed to qualify for the race by [...]001 seconds. [...] Rumours of a sponsor for 2004 and beyond surfaced, but nothing panned out and the team was sold. [...] After all the recent events and struggles, he decided to retire from driving. [...] For his 18-year Winston Cup career Bodine started 480 races with 5 poles, 1 win, 16 top fives, and 61 top tens while winning over 13 million dollars in prize money.|$|E
