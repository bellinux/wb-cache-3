25|$|The engineer, Tom Harding, {{parked the}} train {{on the main}} line by setting the brakes and {{followed}} standard procedure by shutting down {{four of the five}} locomotives. Harding, who was the lone crew member under the MMA's work rules, which had been discussed with Transport Canada, could not park the train on the adjacent siding because MMA used it routinely to store empty boxcars for Tafisa, a <b>particleboard</b> factory in Lac-Mégantic's industrial park. The Nantes siding has a derail that could have stopped the train from accidentally departing. According to Transport Canada, it is unusual to leave an unattended train parked on a main line, but there were no regulations against it.|$|E
25|$|According {{to initial}} claims {{made by the}} railway, the {{engineer}} that left the train unattended went to the explosion zone and uncoupled the last 9 undamaged tank cars that {{were still on the}} tracks {{at the end of the}} derailment. After uncoupling the tank cars, he used a rail car mover to pull them away from the derailment site. This version of events has been disputed by Lac-Mégantic's fire chief, who indicated that a volunteer firefighter had used a rail car mover borrowed from a local factory to remove these cars from danger. It was later revealed that two employees of Tafisa (Serge Morin, Sylvain Grégoire), a firefighter (Benoît Héon), the MMA engineer (Tom Harding) and a member of the family-owned excavation company Lafontaine and Son (Pascal Lafontaine) had worked to move 9 tank cars away from the fire. Tafisa, a local <b>particleboard</b> industry that moves much of its product by rail, has a rail car mover which has the capability to deactivate the brakes on the cars it tows. Morin, aided by his colleague Grégoire, used the rail car mover to move the first 5 tank cars away from the fire. When they could not find a level crossing to move the rail car mover back to the disaster site, they used a loader to remove another 4 tank cars, 2 at a time. Because the loader lacked equipment to deactivate railcar brakes, Harding told the men to use the loader to break the air lines on cars to release the air brakes on each of these four cars. Lafontaine's workers hauled gravel to the site, created firebreaks and blocked manholes as burning oil spread into the town's storm sewer system.|$|E

Germany-grown cup-plant (Silphium perfoliatum L.), sunflower (Helianthusannuus L.) and topinambour (Helianthus tuberosus L.) were used as raw materials for <b>particleboards</b> produced at a conventional density of 600 kg/m 3. <b>Particleboards</b> were glued with two different adhesives, with methylene diphenyl diisocyanate (MDI) as well and urea formaldehyde (UF) resins. The physical and mechanical properties of prepared panels were measured according to standards. The raw materials were analyzed for their chemical composition; particle geometry was carefully monitored. It is shown that the obtained <b>particleboards</b> have acceptable performances, though properties were below those obtained from conventional spruce <b>particleboards.</b> Modulus of rupture of the alternative material <b>particleboards</b> {{were found to be}} lower than the spruce <b>particleboards.</b> Likewise, thickness swelling and water absorption of the agricultural residues made <b>particleboards</b> were higher than the compared spruce-made <b>particleboards.</b> The finding relevant for industrial applications was that the agricultural residue-produced <b>particleboards</b> bonded with MDI resins fully comply with the European standard EN 312 class P 1 (use in dry conditions).

Hemp offers characteristics {{that are similar to}} wood properties. In line with this research, three-layered <b>particleboards</b> under utilization of hemp material were developed. The hemp was used in combination with industrial produced particles to find out which amount of wood can be substituted by hemp and further to investigate which decreased densities can be realized by the use of hemp. Hemp can be used for the production of lightweight <b>particleboards</b> due to its lower bulk density compared to wood. All developed hemp/wood based <b>particleboards</b> were produced under industrial parameters in laboratory and pilot scale using conventional urea formaldehyde-resin, hardeners, and hydrophobic substances. The mechanical technological properties of all produced innovative <b>particleboards</b> and reference <b>particleboards</b> were determined according to current DIN/EN standards.

Compared to the produced reference <b>particleboards,</b> consisting only of wood particles, the developed hemp/wood <b>particleboards</b> possessed better mechanical-technological properties. Furthermore it was realized to produce <b>particleboards</b> with densities of 550 kg/m³ by using hemp due to its low bulk density which fulfills the given DIN/EN requirements.
