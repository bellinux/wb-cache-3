Similar to the Union of Subspaces (UOS) model where each data from each subspace is generated from a (unknown) basis, in the UOPC model each data from each cone is assumed to be generated from a finite number of (unknown) extreme rays. To cluster data under this model, {{we consider}} several algorithms - (a) Sparse Subspace Clustering by Non-negative constraints Lasso (NCL), (b) Least squares approximation (LSA), and (c) K-nearest neighbor (KNN) algorithm to arrive at affinity between data points. Spectral Clustering (SC) is then applied on the resulting affinity matrix to cluster data into different <b>polyhedral</b> <b>cones.</b> We show that on an average KNN outperforms both NCL and LSA and for this algorithm we provide the deterministic conditions for correct clustering. For an affinity measure between the cones it is shown that as long as the cones are not very coherent and as long as the density of data within each cone exceeds a threshold, KNN leads to accurate clustering. Finally, simulation results on real datasets (MNIST and YaleFace datasets) depict that the proposed algorithm works well on real data indicating the utility of the UOPC model and the proposed algorithm...|$|R
