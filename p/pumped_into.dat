At this point the Saturn V rocket's three stages were powered up and drinking water was <b>pumped</b> <b>into</b> the spacecraft. As the countdown began, the crew of Apollo 16 was participating in final training exercises {{in anticipation of a}} launch on April 16. The astronauts underwent their final preflight physical examination on April 11.

Of the 7,900families adversely affected by the hurricane, 4,325required assistance from the American Red Cross. Farmers in Texas, also affected by a major hurricane, requested growers in Florida wait 15days so they could sell their citrus crop that fell. The damaged dam near Tampa initially resulted in waters from the Hillsborough River being <b>pumped</b> <b>into</b> the city's water treatment plant, and a new dam was eventually built in 1944.|$|E
5|$|Commercial sashimi tuna steaks {{may have}} their {{coloration}} fixated {{by the use}} of flushing with carbon monoxide (CO), whereby CO is <b>pumped</b> <b>into</b> bags containing the tuna, which is then stored at 4° Celsius. The duration of time for color fixation to occur varies per the size of the meat. For example, a two-inch tuna steak takes twenty-four hours for color fixation to be completed using this process. When utilized, color fixation using CO occurs prior to the vacuum sealing of tuna steaks for storage. In Japan, color fixation using CO is prohibited.|$|E

5|$|At the {{beginning}} of the cardiac cycle, in early diastole, both the atria and ventricles are relaxed. Since blood moves from areas of high pressure to areas of low pressure, when the chambers are relaxed, blood will flow into the atria (through the coronary sinus and the pulmonary veins). As the atria begin to fill, the pressure will rise so that the blood will move from the atria into the ventricles. In late diastole the atria contract, pumping more blood into the ventricles. This causes a rise in pressure in the ventricles. As the ventricles reach systole, blood will be <b>pumped</b> <b>into</b> the pulmonary artery (right ventricle) or aorta (left ventricle).|$|E
5|$|In 1908, Erie started {{building}} a waterworks on Presque Isle to provide fresh {{water for the}} city. Water from Lake Erie was <b>pumped</b> <b>into</b> two reservoirs on the peninsula, where particulates in the water were allowed to settle, removing them from the lake water. After treatment, the water flowed into the waterlines of the city. In 1917 a pumphouse powered by a steam boiler and engine was built: this pumped the water from one basin into the other, then across Presque Isle Bay to Erie. This system of supplying drinking water for Erie operated until 1949. The pumphouse is now used for zebra mussel control and as a concession stand for bicycle and quadracycle-rentals within the state park.|$|E
5|$|In {{the left}} heart, oxygenated blood is {{returned}} to the left atrium via the pulmonary veins. It is then <b>pumped</b> <b>into</b> the left ventricle through the mitral valve and into the aorta through the aortic valve for systemic circulation. The aorta is a large artery that branches into many smaller arteries, arterioles, and ultimately capillaries. In the capillaries, oxygen and nutrients from blood are supplied to body cells for metabolism, and exchanged for carbon dioxide and waste products. Capillary blood, now deoxygenated, travels into venules and veins that ultimately collect in the superior and inferior vena cavae, and into the right heart.|$|E

5|$|The Patries {{design as}} a {{semi-rigid}} airship {{required that the}} pressure of both the lifting gas in the gas-bag and {{the air in the}} ballonet be sufficient to maintain the airship's overall shape. Sufficient hydrogen was <b>pumped</b> <b>into</b> the gas-bag to enable the airship to ascend to its intended maximum operating altitude of , at which height the ballonet would occupy approximately one-fifth of the total gas-bag volume. Descent was made by releasing hydrogen from the gas-bag and then pumping air into the ballonet to take up the volume of the released gas, a process which was repeated incrementally until the desired rate of descent or altitude had been achieved.|$|E
5|$|The {{process of}} pumping {{water from the}} mines {{introduces}} oxygen via aeration, thereby oxidising the rock's pyrite. Pyrite contains sulfur, and one consequence of its oxidation is the introduction of significant amounts of sulphates into mine water. This has had {{a negative impact on}} water quality in five lakes in the Kurtna Lake District. In some lakes, sulphate levels have increased tens of times compared to the pre-mining period. Suspended mineral matter in the mine water <b>pumped</b> <b>into</b> these lakes has changed the composition of the lakes' sediments. However, it has been found that this disturbance diminishes over time; studies show that sulphates and iron in mining water decrease to levels that meet drinking water quality standards about five years after mine closure.|$|E
5|$|These {{methods of}} steel {{production}} were rendered obsolete by the Linz-Donawitz process of {{basic oxygen steelmaking}} (BOS), developed in the 1950s, and other oxygen steel making methods. Basic oxygen steelmaking is superior to previous steelmaking methods because the oxygen <b>pumped</b> <b>into</b> the furnace limited impurities, primarily nitrogen, that previously had entered from the air used. Today, electric arc furnaces (EAF) are a common method of reprocessing scrap metal to create new steel. They {{can also be used}} for converting pig iron to steel, but they use a lot of electrical energy (about 440 kWh per metric ton), and are thus generally only economical when there is a plentiful supply of cheap electricity.|$|E
25|$|Around 1908, {{the first}} {{mechanical}} aquarium air pump was invented, powered by running water, instead of electricity. The {{introduction of the}} air <b>pump</b> <b>into</b> the hobby is considered by several historians of the hobby to be a pivotal moment in its development.|$|R

5|$|Air pollution, lack {{of proper}} waste {{management}} infrastructure and degradation of water bodies {{are the major}} environmental issues in Coimbatore. There is a sewage treatment plant at Ukkadam with the capacity to process 70 million litres of sewage water per day. Garbage is collected by the corporation and sewage is <b>pumped</b> <b>into</b> the water tanks and the Noyyal river through streams. This along with garbage dumping and encroachments has led to degradation of the water bodies and depletion in the groundwater table. The tanks are renovated by the city's environmental groups with their own fund-raising and the corporation. The corporation is responsible and involved in clearing encroachment of the tanks. Siruthuli, an environmental organisation founded by the city's industrial houses, undertakes de-silting of tanks and cleaning of the Noyyal river. Environment Conservation Group based {{out of the city}} is also involved in conservation of trees and wetlands, monitoring wildlife crime and conducting awareness sessions for students.|$|E
5|$|In {{the first}} half of the 19th century, Sleaford's {{population}} more than doubled from 1,596 in 1801 to 3,539 in 1851. Coinciding with this is the construction or extension of public buildings, often by the local contractors Charles Kirk and Thomas Parry. The gasworks opened in 1839 to provide gas lighting in the town. Sleaford's Poor Law Union was formed in 1836 to cater for the town and the surrounding 54 parishes. The workhouse was constructed by 1838 and could house 181 inmates. Despite these advances, the slums around Westgate were over-crowded, lacking sanitation and disease-ridden; the local administration failed to deal with the matter until 1850, when a report on the town's public health by the General Board of Health heavily criticised the situation and set up a Local Board of Health to undertake public works. By the 1880s, Lord Bristol had allowed clean water to be <b>pumped</b> <b>into</b> the town, but engineering problems and a reluctance to sell land to house the turbines had delayed the introduction of sewers.|$|E
5|$|Spring Brook {{experiences}} noticeable flow loss. As of 2009, it {{has high}} levels of sodium and alkalinity. Pittson Township and the borough of Moosic have permits to discharge stormwater into it. However, the water quality and habitat quality of the stream are relatively unimpacted. The stream has relatively high water quality even where it flows through a concrete channel. In {{a study by the}} Susquehanna River Basin Commission, it was found not to fail any water quality standards either during base flow or storm flow conditions. However, a study from the previous year found concentrations of sodium and alkalinity exceeding the threshold for concern. In the early 1900s, Spring Brook was a clear stream in its upper reaches. However, by the time it reached the property of the Du Pont Powder Company, it was affected by slush <b>pumped</b> <b>into</b> it by the Pennsylvania Coal Company.|$|E
5000|$|An {{ejection}} fraction (EF) is {{the fraction of}} blood ejected from a ventricle of the heart with each heartbeat. EF is readily compared with the ancient term Systole, understood as a [...] "Gathering" [...] of the heart's fibers. It is calculated by dividing the stroke volume by the end-diastolic volume, and is an inherent volumetric measure of the pumping efficiency of the heart.

5|$|The heart pumps blood with {{a rhythm}} {{determined}} {{by a group of}} pacemaking cells in the sinoatrial node. These generate a current that causes contraction of the heart, traveling through the atrioventricular node and along the conduction system of the heart. The heart receives blood low in oxygen from the systemic circulation, which enters the right atrium from the superior and inferior venae cavae and passes to the right ventricle. From here it is <b>pumped</b> <b>into</b> the pulmonary circulation, through the lungs where it receives oxygen and gives off carbon dioxide. Oxygenated blood then returns to the left atrium, passes through the left ventricle and is pumped out through the aorta to the systemic circulation−where the oxygen is used and metabolized to carbon dioxide. The heart beats at a resting rate close to 72 beats per minute. Exercise temporarily increases the rate, but lowers resting heart rate in the long term, and is good for heart health.|$|E
5|$|Attention {{to water}} quality was focused in South Florida in 1986 when a {{widespread}} algal bloom occurred in one-fifth of Lake Okeechobee. The bloom was discovered {{to be the}} result of fertilizers from the Everglades Agricultural Area. Although laws stated in 1979 that the chemicals used in the EAA should not be deposited into the lake, they were flushed into the canals that fed the Everglades Water Conservation Areas, and eventually <b>pumped</b> <b>into</b> the lake. Microbiologists discovered that, although phosphorus assists plant growth, it destroys periphyton, one of the basic building blocks of marl in the Everglades. Marl is one of two types of Everglades soil, along with peat; it is found where parts of the Everglades are flooded for shorter periods of time as layers of periphyton dry. Most of the phosphorus compounds also rid peat of dissolved oxygen and promote algae growth, causing native invertebrates to die, and sawgrass to be replaced with invasive cattails that grow too tall and thick for birds and alligators to nest in. Tested water showed 500parts per billion (ppb) of phosphorus near sugarcane fields. State legislation in 1987 mandated a 40% reduction of phosphorus by 1992.|$|E
5|$|In 2011, The Royal Park {{embarked}} on {{the restoration of}} the Serpentine to combat growing concerns about the status of the water {{and the quality of the}} aquatic environment. The project resulted in a substantial change to the hydrology of the lake, which had a turnover time of 10 years, and is now reduced to 4–5 months as a result of new borehole water being <b>pumped</b> <b>into</b> the lake. The three boreholes, drilled into the Upper Chalk, now supply the lake with up to 900,000 cubic metres of water per annum ensuring that the lake remains fresh and does not stagnate. In addition, the historically contaminated sediments have been treated and nutrients within the sediments chemically neutralised. Thirdly, the oxygen status of the water and the overall mixing of the lake is now controlled by a series of 24 aeration pumps fixed to the base of the lake. These ensure that the dissolved oxygen levels in the lake do not fall and result in chronic ecological stress. Finally, the overall ecology of the lake was reviewed and some of the large bream and carp were removed in February 2012 to reduce their disturbance of the sediment and vegetation of the lake. These measures were implemented over the period October 2011 to June 2012. The resultant water quality of the lake was excellent and proved to be an extremely popular venue for the swimming portion of the London 2012 Triathlon and the Marathon Swim events in August 2012.|$|E
