40|$|Structural health {{monitoring}} of existing infrastructure is currently an important field of research, where elaborate experimental programs and advanced analytical methods {{are used in}} identifying {{the current state of}} health of critical and important structures. The paper outlines two methods of system identification of beam-like reinforced concrete structures representing bridges, through static measure- ments, in a distributed damage scenario. The first one is similar to the stiffness method, re-cast and the second one to flexibility method. A least square error (LSE) based solution method is used for the estimation of flexural rigidities and damages of simply supported, cantilever and <b>propped</b> cantilever <b>beam</b> from the measured deformation values. The performance of both methods in the presence of measurement errors is demonstrated. An experiment on an un-symmetrically damaged simply supported reinforced concrete beam is used to validate the developed method. A method for damage prognosis is demonstrated using a generalized, indeterminate, <b>propped</b> cantilever <b>beam...</b>|$|R
40|$|YesFor {{composite}} beams {{with low}} degrees of shear connection, additional deflections occur due to slip in the shear connectors, {{which can be}} significant for beams with low degrees of shear connection. A design formula is presented for the effective stiffness of composite beams taking account of the stiffness of the shear connectors, which is compared to measured deflections of 6 symmetric beams and an 11 m span composite beam of asymmetric profile. It is shown that the comparison is good when using a shear connector stiffness of 70 kN/mm for single shear connectors and 100 kN/mm for pairs of shear connectors per deck rib. Results of push tests {{on a range of}} deck profiles confirm these initial elastic stiffnesses. To ensure that the slip at the serviceability limit state does not lead to permanent deformations of the beam, it is proposed that the minimum degree of shear connection should not fall below 30 % for un-propped beams and 40 % for <b>propped</b> <b>beams</b> of symmetric cross-section.

A portion of the decrepit building still stood revealed in its wretched old age; <b>propped,</b> partly by <b>beams</b> which reached from the thatched roof to the ground, and partly by the wall of a new cottage attached, presenting in yellow brick-work a hideous modern contrast to all that was left of its ancient neighbor.|$|R
40|$|We are {{interested}} in sandwich beams whose skins may be thick (as defined in the classical book of Allen) and whose core stiffness along the sandwich longitudinal axis may {{be large enough to}} influence the deflection (that is, we also account for non-antiplane sandwiches), whereas the core is such that it is allowed to disregard its deformability along its height (i. e., the direction of the applied load). For such sandwiches we are particularly interested in investigating the reliability of simple models, as the First-Order Shear Deformation models, for the accurate computation of the deflection in the linear elastic range. We therefore compare different theories on the basis of Finite Element simulations and focus on the case of a <b>propped</b> cantilever <b>beam</b> supporting a uniform load. In fact, this boundary value problem leads to slightly different conclusions than those previously drawn based on statically determinate cases such as the three-point bending. The analysis suggests that known models may be largely inaccurate in predicting the sandwich behaviour under bending and shear, depending on a peculiarity of the actual sandwich kinematics indirectly describing the interaction between skins and core, in turn due both to their material and geometrical properties and to the boundary conditions...|$|R
40|$|While a {{large number}} of {{investigations}} are available in respect of lateral-torsion buckling of beams, the available literature on distortional buckling of short span beams with mono-symmetric I-sections is limited. Hence the present investigation is aimed at studying distortional buckling in three types of mono-symmetric I-beams: (i) simply supported, (ii) propped cantilever, and (iii) braced cantilever, under three types of load: a point load, a uniformly distributed load and a uniform moment. Both the top and bottom flange loadings are considered for the first two types of load. In order to take into account distortional buckling in the finite element analysis using ABAQUS, quadratic shell elements are used to model the beam-sections which consider small strains but large rotations. Eigenvalue analyses are performed to determine the buckling loads. For simply supported and <b>propped</b> cantilever <b>beams,</b> moment modification factors are calculated and compared with the provisions given in SSRC Guidelines (see[1]). For braced cantilever beams, the effect of different types of brace and their positions along the beam span are investigated to find out the most effective bracing type and its location. A general observation based on the present investigation is that the distortional buckling has a significant effect on short length beams, at least for the types of beam considered. For simply supported beams it is seen that for a uniform moment case, the difference between the flexural-torsion bucklin...|$|R

40|$|For ease of {{construction}} steel–concrete composite beams are usually unpropped during construction, with the steel section alone supporting {{the weight of}} the concrete slab during casting. The subsequent applied loading is resisted by the composite action of the steel and concrete. This mode {{of construction}} results in significant stresses built into the steel section. A numerical method is presented for modelling the load–deformation behaviour of composite beams unpropped during construction and incorporating composite connections at the supports. The method accounts for the effect of dead load stresses built into unpropped beams. A 3 D moment–curvature–dead load stress relationship is defined, utilising the non-linear stress–strain properties of the steel and concrete. This relationship is used subsequently for calculating the distribution of curvature along the length of a beam. The curvature may be double integrated, using the support displacements as boundary conditions, to determine the deflected shape. The accuracy of the technique has been assessed experimentally using a 24 m long test frame incorporating unpropped composite beams and composite connections. The model predictions of end rotations and displacements are shown to be in good agreement with observed values. Standardised composite connection details are currently only available for use with <b>propped</b> composite <b>beams.</b> This work has been carried out to assess the conditions in which these details can be safely used with beams, which are unpropped during construction. The work is of particular interest to those attempting to model accurately the load–deformation response of unpropped composite beams. <br/...|$|R
60|$|In the meantime, he was vaguely {{conscious}} that Driscoll had saved his life.

Stooping in the low tunnel, he nerved himself for a tense effort and struck several furious blows. The prop quivered, groaned as it felt the pressure from above, moved an inch or two, and stood upright. Then Thirlwell dropped his ax and staggered back. He felt limp and exhausted, and wanted to get away. The beam would hold the roof for some minutes and might do so for a time.|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{investigates the}} {{behaviour}} of composite beams with partial shear interaction {{by means of}} the direct stiffness approach. A model is derived to describe the behaviour of m-layered composite beams in the linear-elastic range (where m is an integer {{greater than or equal to}} two). This model is then applied to the particular case of composite beams formed by two layers, as in the case of steel-concrete composite beams. Based on this model, the direct stiffness approach is formulated and closed form solutions are derived for particular structural cases, such as for simply supported <b>beams,</b> <b>propped</b> cantilevers and fixed ended beams, subjected to a uniformly distributed load. The direct stiffness formulation is extended to account for material nonlinearities and the proposed nonlinear modelling technique is validated against experimental data available in literature; the experiments considered include simply supported beams loaded in positive and negative bending subjected to a point load applied at mid-span and two-span continuous composite beams subjected to point loads. The behaviour of composite beams with partial shear interaction is then investigated accounting for time effects such as creep and shrinkage. The model derived in the linear-elastic range for two-layered composite beams is further developed to account for these time effects. In addition, the applicability of the direct stiffness approach is extended in the time domain based on this model and closed form solutions are derived for some structural systems, such as for simply supported <b>beams,</b> <b>propped</b> cantilevers and fixed ended beams, subjected to a uniformly distributed load and to shrinkage deformation. The use of the direct stiffness approach requires only one discretisation to be carried out, which occurs in the time domain, instead of the two (i. e. one discretisation in the time domain and one discretisation along the beam axis) required by modelling techniques available in literature. The time-dependent behaviour of the concrete is modelled by means of the algebraic methods, such as the age-adjusted effective modulus method and the mean stress method. The extension of the formulation to model the time-dependent behaviour of the concrete using the step-by-step procedure is also presented. ...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a {{comparative study of}} available displacement-based modelling techniques {{for the analysis of}} steel-concrete composite beams with partial shear interaction, which include the finite difference method, the finite element method, the direct stiffness method and the exact analytical model. Both shortand long-term analyses have been considered in order to provide an indication of how these affect the accuracy of the predictions. For the implementation of the finite difference method and of the finite element method, discretisations in both space and time domains are required, while only the time discretisation needs to be specified for the direct stiffness method and the exact analytical solutions. The time-dependent behaviour of the concrete has been modelled by means of the age-adjusted effective modulus method (AEMM) while the remaining materials at the cross-section have been assumed to behave in a linear-elastic manner. The results obtained using these formulations are qualitatively compared and their accuracy is estimated adopting the exact analytical model as a benchmark reference with the objective of establishing the minimum spatial discretisations required to keep the error within an acceptable tolerance. These comparisons are carried out for simply-supported <b>beams,</b> <b>propped</b> cantilevers and fixed-ended beams, from which the behaviour of these formulations in the modelling of continuous beams can also be deduced...|$|R

Houses were knocked down; streets broken through and stopped; deep pits and trenches dug in the ground; enormous heaps of earth and clay thrown up; buildings that were undermined and shaking, <b>propped</b> by great <b>beams</b> of wood. Here, a chaos of carts, overthrown and jumbled together, lay topsy-turvy {{at the bottom of}} a steep unnatural hill; there, confused treasures of iron soaked and rusted in something that had accidentally become a pond.

There were a hundred thousand shapes and substances of incompleteness, wildly mingled out of their places, upside down, burrowing in the earth, aspiring in the air, mouldering in the water, and unintelligible as any dream. Hot springs and fiery eruptions, the usual attendants upon earthquakes, lent their contributions of confusion to the scene.

40|$|Current dynamic {{testing methods}} can prove {{unrealistic}} {{due to the}} scale at which test components are modelled, {{the rate at which}} they are loaded or the boundary conditions to which they are subjected. A new test method, termed "Real-Time Sub-Structure Testing" seeks to provide a more realistic testing environment for energy dissipative components. The method tests structural components at full or large scale and in real-time. The physical test interacts with a computer model of the structure surrounding the test component. In this way, the in-situ behaviour of the test component is evaluated in relation to the overall structural response. The testing method requires fast and realistic modelling of the surrounding structure and a rapid interaction with the physical test specimen. For these reasons, a new non-linear finite element method has been proposed in order to model the surrounding structure behaviour efficiently. The method uses the Central Difference Method time stepping integration scheme together with a newly devised basis. The proposed basis consists of the structure’s elastic modes and additional Ritz vectors, which are calculated from the inelastic static displacement shapes of the structure. The displacement shapes correspond to the same static spatial distribution of loading as the intended dynamic excitation, and are intended to characterise the inelastic behaviour of the structure. The method has been validated against a Newmark event to event algorithm as well as Drain 2 DX. The non-linear dynamic response of a <b>propped</b> cantilever <b>beam</b> and portal frame structure was investigated. The response evaluated by the algorithm agrees closely with both validation analyses. The new algorithm was also shown to be faster than the Newmark procedure in simple benchmark tests. In addition, a numerical model of the testing apparatus has been developed in order to simulate complete tests for the purposes of testing procedure development and validation. The model is developed using Matlab Simulink. Parameters for the model are deduced from published data, experimental component tests and open loop step response calibrations. The model behaviour was found to be very sensitive to the parameters used. However, after calibration against open loop tests the model reproduces the observed laboratory behaviour to a good degree of accuracy. In an attempt to predict the behaviour of an actual test, the laboratory model has been coupled with the new structural solution algorithm to simulate a virtual test. The simulated results compare well with experimentally observed data demonstrating the usefulness of the overall simulation as a test modelling tool...|$|R
