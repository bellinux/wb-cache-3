25|$|Deficit between water {{tariffs and}} water charges. There are two {{problems}} with this charging system: First, the water charge is indexed to inflation and {{is supposed to be}} automatically increased every six months, while water tariff increases have to be approved by the City Council. In the aftermath of the East Asian Crisis, the City Council froze the water tariff, thus creating a deficit for the government-owned Asset Holding Company Perusahaan Daerah Air Minum Jakarta Raya (PAM Jaya) as early as the second half of 1998. Second, the more poor people were connected the lower the average tariff collected would become because of the tariff structure. The <b>public</b> <b>contract</b> partner of the private companies, PAM Jaya, however, receives higher revenues from commercial customers and wealthier residential customers since these pay higher tariffs than the poor residential customers. The more poor people are connected by the private operators, the greater the deficit of the public holding company would become, since for each new poor customer it had to pay a charge to the private companies than was higher than the tariff paid by the customer. PAM Jaya thus actually discourages the private companies to connect the poor to the network by seeking a “balanced composition of connections” in order not to further increase the burden on the budget of the province of Jakarta. Indeed, between 1998 and 2004 only 25% of TPJ's new connections were in the two poorest categories, while 60% of existing customers in 2003 were in these categories. As a result of these factors, PAM Jaya has not fully paid the charges to the operators and has accumulated arrears to them. These arrears could reach Rupiahs 18.2 trillion (1.9bn USD) {{until the end of the}} contracts in 2022, if the water tariff remains frozen from 2007 until 2022.|$|E

40|$|Public {{procurement}} {{according to}} the Act.

40|$|The {{fundamental}} {{feature of}} private contracting is its relational nature. When faced with unforeseen or unexpected circumstances, private parties, {{as long as}} the relation remains worthwhile, adjust their required performance without the need for costly renegotiation or formal recontracting. <b>Public</b> <b>contracting,</b> on the other hand, seems to be characterized by formalized, standardized, bureaucratic, rigid procedures. Common wisdom sees <b>public</b> <b>contracts</b> as generally more inflexible, requiring more frequent formal renegotiation, having a higher tendency to litigate, and providing weaker incentives. In sum, <b>public</b> <b>contracts</b> are perceived to be less "efficient. " In this paper I develop a theory of <b>public</b> <b>contracting</b> that accommodates these stark differences between private and <b>public</b> <b>contracting.</b> The thrust of the paper is that these differences arise directly because of the different hazards present in public and purely private contracts, which directly impact the nature of the resulting contractual forms. A fundamental corollary of this result is that the perceived inefficiency of <b>public</b> or governmental <b>contracting</b> is simply the result of contractual adaptation to different inherent hazards, and as such is not directly remediable. Finally, I apply the main insights from the general framework developed here to understand the characteristics of concession contracts. ...|$|R
