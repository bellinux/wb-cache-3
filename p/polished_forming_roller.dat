40|$|Splined Mandrel Flow Forming (SMFF) is an {{effective}} method for fabricating a variety of internally-ribbed cylindrical parts. The process is, however, prone to premature failure of the splined mandrels and this {{is thought to be}} related to the magnitude of the forming forces exerted by the <b>forming</b> <b>rollers</b> on the mandrel splines. In this thesis an experimentation-based approach is used to investigate the effects of critical process parameters; namely, Inter-roller offset of the X 1 -X 2 <b>forming</b> <b>rollers,</b> Oa, roller inclination angle, roller nose radius, r 0, <b>forming</b> <b>roller</b> feed rate and mandrel rotational speed, on forming forces exerted on an AISI 1020 steel work piece as it is flow formed over a splined mandrel. The combined effect of these parameters on the maximum forming forces, Fmax, the roller forceoscillation amplitude, ΔF, and the roller/ work piece contact area are examined for an X 1 <b>forming</b> <b>roller</b> during the third pass for SMFF tests performed under various process conditions...|$|R
50|$|A simple {{indication}} {{of the quality of}} a printing press is the number of distribution and <b>form</b> <b>rollers.</b> The greater the number of distribution rollers, the more accurate the control of ink uniformity. It is difficult to ink large solid areas on a plate with only one ink <b>form</b> <b>roller.</b> With three (generally the maximum), it is relatively easy to maintain consistent ink coverage of almost any image area on the plate. Business forms presses, which print very little coverage, usually only have one or two ink <b>form</b> <b>rollers.</b> Because of this, they cannot print large solid or screen images. Smaller, less sophisticated presses also have the same problem, however, many of the newer presses today are being equipped with larger, better inking systems to meet the growing print demands of the consumer.|$|R
40|$|AbstractAn {{experimental}} study of rotary splitting of circular disk was conducted to survey the effect of forming parametars on the metal flow in rotary spritting. It {{was found that the}} radial force Fr increases with the increase in the initial blank thickness t 0, the feed rate of roller v and the apex angle of <b>forming</b> <b>roller</b> α. It was also found that the length of the straight part of formed V-shaped profile ls increases with the increase in the initial blank thickness t 0 and the apex angle of <b>forming</b> <b>roller</b> α...|$|R

5000|$|Indirect {{dampening}} systems (or integrated dampening systems) {{feed the}} water directly {{into one of}} the ink <b>form</b> <b>rollers</b> (ink rollers that touch the offset plate) via a water <b>form</b> <b>roller</b> in contact with it. These systems are known as [...] "indirect" [...] since the water travels to the offset plate passing through the inking system and not directly to the offset plate as direct systems do. Some indirect systems will have the ability to feed the water into the inking system {{as well as to the}} offset plate. A fine emulsion of ink and water is then developed on the ink <b>form</b> <b>roller.</b> This is one reason printers need to know about [...] "water pickup" [...] or what percentage of water can be taken up by the ink. These systems are also known as [...] "integrated" [...] dampening systems as they are integrated into the inking system. One of the benefits of these systems, is that they do not use covers thus they react more quickly when dampening changes are made. One generally finds this type of dampening systems on newer and faster press equipment today.|$|R

40|$|In {{order to}} use CBN {{grinding}} wheels technologically and economically successful, their correct use preparation is of decisive importance. Systematic investigations when truing ceramic bonded CBN grinding wheels with a diamond <b>form</b> <b>roller</b> should show {{the influence of}} the process setting parameters and the contour inclination of the abrasive coating on the grinding result. Analogous considerations made it possible to carry out the tests using a single grinding wheel with a straight profile. In doing so, a loading of the abrasive coating was produced in axial direction by special grinding kinematics. The influence of the inclination angle on the coherence of the abrasive coating becomes clear particulary for the wear behaviour. A reason for this is the loading of the abrasive coating by an axial force component. What is more, {{the influence of the}} speed ratio on the performance of CBN grinding wheels was examined with a high-speed device for diamond <b>form</b> <b>rollers...</b>|$|R
50|$|The ink {{fountain}} stores {{a quantity of}} ink in a reservoir and feeds small quantities of ink to the distribution rollers from the {{ink fountain}} roller and the ink ductor roller. The ink ductor roller is a movable roller that moves {{back and forth between}} the ink fountain roller and an ink distribution roller. As the ductor contacts the ink fountain roller, both turn and the ductor is inked. The ductor then swings forward to contact an ink distribution roller and transfers ink to it. There are generally two types of ink distribution rollers: the ink rotating rollers (or ink transfer rollers), which rotate in one direction, and the ink oscillating rollers (or ink vibrating rollers), which rotate and move from side to side. The ink distribution rollers receive ink and work it into a semiliquid state that is uniformly delivered to the ink <b>form</b> <b>rollers.</b> A thin layer of ink is then transferred to the image portions of the lithographic plate by the ink <b>form</b> <b>rollers.</b>|$|R
