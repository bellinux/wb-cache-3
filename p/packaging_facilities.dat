Only one gluten-free variety of oats was analysed and it consistently provided negative results in all analyses.

This work thus focuses on studying materials allowing to securely and durably confine a large set of primary wastes.

These parameters were determined in experiments that took into account the likely configuration of a full-scale plant in the banana growing region of north Queensland. The digestion was conducted in a 200 -l reactor using fed-batch operation, relying entirely on the natural microbial consortia on the reject bananas to avoid reliance on external inocula such as sludge, an undesirable material around food <b>packaging</b> <b>facilities.</b> An enrichment culture was first established in a highly buffered 200 -l batch digestion unit. The fed-batch digester was then started by exchanging leachate with the mature batch reactor. Under loading conditions of 0. 6 kg VS m d over 70 days where the average working volume was 160 l, the digester produced 398 ± 20 l CH kg VS. Increasing the loading rate to 1. 6 kg VS m d resulted in a reduced methane yield of 210 l CH kg VS over 23 days of operation, with a concomitant accumulation of banana waste in the digester.

40|$|Poor produce {{quality and}} {{inconsistent}} supply currently impede smallholder vegetable growers in Fiji from accessing high-value domestic markets. One proposed option {{to overcome these}} constraints is to adopt a more centralised approach to product grading and storage, based around a network of regional ripening and <b>packaging</b> <b>facilities.</b> In terms of tomato growers, this would necessitate reconfiguring existing postharvest supply chains, removing the need for on-farm ripening, and transport of harvest-green mature fruit. This preliminary study was undertaken {{to determine whether the}} alternative transport of mature hard-green fruit would affect the incidence of bruising and impact damage. Fruits of four ripening stages were commercially transported to Suva municipal market, and then stored for seven days at 20 - 28 °C (ambient market storage conditions). Fruit deformation due to compression in the carton was significantly less in mature-hard green fruits. We found that mature hard-green stage was least susceptible to bruising (8 %) compared with turning stage tomatoes (12 %), commercially traded fruit (16 %) and light-red (21 %). For mature green tomatoes most damage (36 %) was in the middle inner level of the carton. Light red and turning tomatoes placed in the bottom inside layer displayed highest level of damage, 62 and 46 % respectively. Based on this preliminary trial, transporting hardgreen tomatoes is likely {{to reduce the risk of}} in-transit postharvest damage, compared to the current smallholder practices of transporting fully-ripe fruit...|$|E

In India, the Micro, Small, and Medium Enterprises Development (MSMED) Act 2006 defines MSMEs. It {{introduces}} {{the concept of}} enterprise {{as opposed to the}} earlier concept of industry. The overall contribution of small firms formal and informal?to the GDP and employment remain about the same across low, middle, and high-income group countries. As income increases, the share of the informal sector decreases and that of the formal SME sector increases. The main need is to generate large scale employment as countries develop the share of agriculture in providing employment and in GDP decreases. The MSME sector in India is heterogeneous, dispersed, and mostly unorganized. It includes diverse types of production units ranging from traditional crafts to high-tech industries. In this regard, the core challenges of MSMEs are the following; Inadequate Access to Credit and Working Capital, Dwindling of a Vibrant Sector, Non-Availability of Quality Raw Materials and <b>Packaging</b> <b>Facilities</b> on a Timely Basis, Insufficient Market Research, Linkages & Design Inputs, Rehabilitation of Sick SSI Units, Globalization, and Technology Upgradation and Achieving Economies of Scale.

40|$|The next {{revolution}} in silicon technology is presently {{due to the}} development of micro-electromechanical systems (MEMS). The power of the chips will not be limited simply to store and process the information. Incorporation of new type of functionality on the chip is making the structures to sense, act, and communicate as well. To fabricate MEMS devices, existing facilities for ICs fabrication is not sufficient, some more facilities have to be added, like bulk and surface micromachining, dry etching, integration of electronic, new type of <b>packaging</b> <b>facilities</b> and many others. Several devices are now produced and sold in very large quantities, for example, silicon accelerometers and pressure sensors for automotive.

For this reason, companies are taking qualified employees from other fields like mechanical, electrical and precision engineering to meet their demand for research and development. These engineers have to be trained on the job with regard to micro systems technology (MST) specific needs.

The educational institutions need to set up appropriate infrastructure, have trained teachers, fully equipped laboratories as well as training and teaching materials has to be made available.

40|$|Despite the {{development}} of new technologies, manual labour still continuous to play a large role within most modern agricultural operations, especially during harvest. Consequently, there is an increasing demand for new machines to reduce labour as a mean to limit costs, while increasing efficiency in a sustainable manner. This thesis concern itself with the design of a mechanism and control system for a robot arm that can substitute workers in logistical operations during strawberry harvest. More specifically, by lifting berry crates onto a robot platform and transporting them from the fields and to the <b>packaging</b> <b>facilities.</b> The robot arm is to be mounted on the platform composing a vehicle- manipulator system. As this thesis is connected to a general research project on agricultural robotics at the Norwegian University of Life Sciences, the chosen platform is the associated field robot Thorvald II. The thesis is divided into two parts, where Part I concerns the mechanical design of the robot arm, while Part II propose a system for controlling the mechanism. The design development process has involved assessments of available solutions before selecting components on the basis of controllability, mechanical properties and costs. The process of selection in Part II is however, based on finding solutions that are compatible with the robot platform’s network (Controller Area Network) and operating system (Robotic Operating System). Part I: Design and Mechanics The design of the robot arm presented in this thesis begun with a preliminary feasibility study conducted by Bjurbeck in September 2016. Following the assessment of this study, the robot arm is designed to have two degrees of freedom operating in the xz-plane. When mounted on the platform, the arm will be free to operate in a 3 -dimensional space, as the platform moves in x and y-direction, and rotates around the z-axis. The arm is assembled from two parallel link pairs made from rectangular aluminium tubes, and a revolute and prismatic joint. Both joints are actuated by LinAk LA 36 linear electric actuators. The end effector of the arm is a gripper head designed to grasp the handles of the strawberry crate. The gripper head is self-aligning with the crate’s orientation {{in order to reduce the}} precision of control needed to envelop and grasp the crate. The frame of the gripper head is made from aluminium angle profiles and sheet metal. A worm drive DC motor actuate the gripper claws via a double link mechanism. Part II: Modeling and Control The geometry of the design presented in Part I is modelled mathematically and the inverse kinematics solved analytically. The kinematics will be used in future implementation of a position control system. Two RoboteQ SDC 2160 dual-channel controllers are chosen to control all four actuator mo- tors. The linear actuators are controlled in closed loop position tracking mode with absolute feedback. The gripper motor is controlled in open loop mode with end stop switches detecting the position of the claws. Experiments was conducted to match the controllers with the actuator motors. The experiments revealed firmware issues with the controller. The experiments also affirmed the controller need a script to operate the actuators efficiently. The thesis provides the foundations to build a prototype and write an operating script to test the mechanical design and control system...|$|E
