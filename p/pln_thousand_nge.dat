40|$|Scientific studies {{state that}} a {{considerable}} {{part of the}} economic value of crop plant production should {{be attributed to the}} free services of pollinating insects. Such calculations are available for several EU and North American countries, and the present paper evaluates the value of pollination services to 19 important Polish crop plants. It is estimated that the market value of 19 entomogamous crops reaches the sum of approx. 7. 5 billion <b>PLN</b> (<b>thousand</b> million) (approx. 1. 8 billion EUR), 39 % of this may be attributed to the insect activities, the most important being bees (the service value of approx. 2. 5 billion PLN/ 0. 6 billion EUR) and dipterans (almost 0. 3 billion PLN/ 74 billion EUR). The paper discusses also the challenges and pitfalls of similar estimations and the need for conservation actions directed on crop plant pollinators...|$|R

The paper presents the level and structure of equipment of the selected organic farms with farm buildings and their replacement value and operating costs were calculated. The scope of research included 50 facilities located in the southern Poland, which were granted an organic farm certificate. The investigated facilities were the object of research within the development subsidy titled "Innovative influence of technology and information management supporting system on production efficiency in organic farms". The analysed data concerned 2012. For the purpose of comparative analysis the researched facilities were divided into two groups which specialize in plant and animal production. Average area of buildings was 314. 45 m 2 and was comparable in distinguished trend groups. In farms producing plants, storehouses prevailed and in case of animal farms – livestock buildings. Average annual replacement value of buildings was <b>PLN</b> 105. 78 <b>thousand</b> and was also comparable in trend groups. In the structure of replacement value, storehouses prevailed, which constituted at the average 43. 03 % and livestock buildings – 37. 68 %.

40|$|The {{market of}} organic {{products}} {{is now one}} of the fastest growing sectors of food production in the world and especially in the EU countries. The purpose of this article is to present the status of organic farming in Poland and in the EU countries and to show the impact of these products on sustainable consumption. The article uses data from FiBL, IFOAM and IJHARS. For the presentation of the data we used the time series, cluster analysis, and multidimensional clustering of features and objects. In Europe, in 2012, organic products were produced by approx. 320 thousand manufacturers with a total value of 22. 8 billion euros, of which 250 thousand in the EU and its value amounted to 20. 9 billion euros. In Poland 26 376 organic producers were registered and the value of organic products was valued at 650 <b>thousand</b> <b>PLN.</b> It is crucial for organic farming to invent capital into processing and distribution of organic products.

40|$|The article {{presents}} the results of research on the opportunity costs related to establishing nature reserves in four randomly-selected forest districts located in the Mazowieckie Province: Celestynów, Grójec, Płońsk and Zwoleń. Our analysis included calculation of profits forgone by forest districts due to the cessation of timber harvesting in nature reserves and an estimation of work places lost as a result of introduction of new limitations, as well as the expenses incurred by municipalities related to their establishment of forest tax concessions in nature reserves. The establishment of nature reserves incurred losses related to timber harvest of about 246 thousand m 3 during the period of 10 years, which is equivalent to between 4. 1 % and 19. 8 % of the planned timber harvest stated in the forest management plans of the studied forest districts. Total opportunity costs were equal to 25. 5 – 27. 2 million PLN during these 10 years or 1502 – 1605 PLN/ha of nature reserve annually. Annual opportunity costs calculated per unit of forest area were equal to 56 – 60 PLN/ha. The estimated loss in work places was 98. 8 working days annually per 1000 ha of forest area in forest districts. Total expenses incurred by municipalities related to establishment of forest tax concessions in nature reserves reached about 18. 1 <b>thousand</b> <b>PLN</b> in 2011. The research results show that the economic and social costs of nature protection activities are concentrated in their places of their origin. Those costs are felt the most by the owners of the affected forests and local communities. We recommend that possibilities are explored for the introduction of instruments to allow the mitigation of negative effects resulting from restrictions in forest use. Restructuring of forest and nature protection policy, {{to take into account the}} interests of all stakeholders would provide an improved model for the use of these forests...|$|R
40|$|Objective : The {{objective}} {{of the study was}} to analyse the prevalence of psoriatic arthritis (PsA) in Poland and to assess the costs generated by treatment of PsA patients in the system of public healthcare. Material and methods : The analysis was based on the database of the public payer, the National Health Fund (NFZ). PsA was defined by the diagnostic ICD- 10 codes M 07 (Enteropathic arthropathies) and L 40. 5 (Psoriatic arthropathies). The estimate of the costs was based on the reports submitted to the NFZ by health service providers. The prevalence rates were calculated using the NFZ data and the population estimates from the Central Statistical Office of Poland (GUS). Results : In 2015, the prevalence of PsA (ICD- 10 : L 40. 5 and M 07) in Poland was 3. 2 per 10 000 population (3. 7 in women and 2. 6 in men). In 2015, nearly 7. 3 thousand patients with the diagnosis of M 07 and 6. 3 thousand patients with the diagnosis of L 40. 5 received healthcare benefits. Women accounted for 60. 6 % of those patients. Nearly three fourths of PsA patients were aged 40 to 69 years with the median age of 54 years (56 years in women and 50 years in men). Between 2008 and 2015 the NFZ expenditure on the treatment of PsA increased from 6. 6 million Polish zloty (PLN) (1. 9 million EUR) to PLN 50. 8 million (12. 1 million EUR). In the same period, the number of PsA patients increased from 3. 4 thousand to 11. 9 thousand. In 2015, the mean cost of treatment per PsA patient was <b>PLN</b> 3. 8 <b>thousand.</b> Conclusions : The PsA prevalence rates estimated by the authors from the NFZ database are clearly lower than those derived from studies in other European countries, which may suggest that the actual number of PsA patients in Poland may be underestimated. Still the number of patients treated for PsA increased nearly 3. 5 -fold during 2008 – 2015, when the cost of PsA treatment rose more than 7 times...|$|R
40|$|O objetivo deste trabalho foi estudar o efeito de diferentes lâminas de água e do {{manejo de}} solo sobre componentes de rendimento e produtividade de cinco genótipos de trigo. Foram estabelecidos dois experimentos com delineamento {{experimental}} em três blocos ao acaso com o manejo de solo nas parcelas (com e sem incorporação de adubo verde no solo), os genótipos nas subparcelas (Aliança, Brilhante, BRS 254, PF 32 e PF 64) e as lâminas de água nas subparcelas. O sistema de irrigação foi o “line source”. Nas subparcelas do primeiro experimento, para avaliar a resposta de produtividade, foram aplicadas 14 lâminas de água (em mm) : 417; 400, 7; 402, 4; 361, 5; 361, 0; 306, 4; 271, 3; 226, 9; 258, 0; 136, 9; 93, 3; 59, 7; 42, 4 e 34, 8. No segundo experimento, foram aplicadas 4 lâminas de água (375, 1; 163, 5; 37, 2 e 33, 6) sendo avaliadas os seguintes componentes de produção: número de grãos por espiga (NGE), peso de mil grãos (PMG), grãos por espiga (GE), número de espigas por área (NE) e a produtividade (P 4). A produtividade média e alguns componentes apresentaram variação significativa em função da lâmina de água e do manejo de solo, dependendo da fonte de variação e das interações. Os resultados para a produtividade não foram conclusivos quanto à influência do manejo de solo. Mas foram quanto à interação genótipo e água. O genótipo que apresentou melhor eficiência de uso de água nas subparcelas com menor disponibilidade hídrica foi o Aliança (para os tratamentos com e sem revolvimento do solo). No entanto, o BRS 254 apresentou os melhores resultados em resposta à irrigação. Por fim, o número de espigas por metro quadrado foi o componente de rendimento que apresentou melhor correlação com a produtividade. _________________________________________________________________________________ ABSTRACTThe {{objective of this}} work was to study the effect of different water depths and soil tillageon yield components and yield of five wheat genotypes. Two experiments were conducted with experimental design in three blocks with the management of land plots(with and without incorporation of green manure in the soil), the genotypes as subplots(Alliance, Bright, BRS 254, 32 PF and PF 64) and water depths as subplots. The irrigation system was the "line source". In the subplots of the first experiment to evaluate the response of productivity, were applied 14 layers of water (in mm) : 417, 400. 7, 402. 4, 361. 5, 361. 0, 306. 4, 271. 3; 226. 9, 258. 0, 136. 9, 93. 3, 59. 7, 42. 4 and 34. 8. In the second experiment, we applied four layers of water (375. 1, 163. 5, 37. 2 and 33. 6) and evaluated the following yield components: number of grains per ear (<b>NGE),</b> <b>thousand</b> kernel weight (KW), grains per ear (GE), number of ears per area (NE) and productivity(P 4). The average productivity and some components varied significantly depending on water depth and soil management, depending on the source of variation and interactions. The results for productivity were inconclusive regarding {{the influence of the}} management of soil. But it was on the genotype and water. The genotype that showed the greatest efficiency of water use in subplots with less water availability was the Alliance (for treatments with and without soil disturbance). However, BRS 254 showed the best results in response to irrigation. Finally, the number of ears per square meter was the yield component that showed the best correlation with yield...|$|R
