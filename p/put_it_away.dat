25|$|Meanwhile, Annie and Dixon {{are going}} through rough times after their parents' divorce and attempt to keep the family close. Debbie deals {{with the realities of}} being a newly single mother. Annie has spent the summer on house arrest (in {{addition}} to being on probation and having a suspended license) after confessing to her hit-and-run. Annie and Liam have feelings for each other but think it best to <b>put</b> <b>it</b> <b>away</b> so it doesn't interfere with their relationships with others. Annie finds romance with a college student, Charlie, who turns out to be Liam's half-brother. Charlie and Annie {{have a lot in common}} and both are theater kids. Liam has a tumultuous relationship with Charlie due to their rocky past. Teddy and Silver are happy to be together, but in the earthquake Teddy injures his leg, which could possibly end his tennis career. Teddy is also struggling with his sexuality, after realizing that he drunkenly slept with another guy, Ian. After some discouraging behavior from Teddy, Silver breaks up with him. This discouraging behavior was a result of Teddy being so insecure with himself being gay. With all that going on in school, Adrianna is driving back from a summer of touring with the pop star, Javier. The two become a couple until Navid reveals to Adrianna that he has never stopped loving her, and she dumps Javier for Navid. Although he initially resolves to get her back, Javier becomes angered by this. He tells her that her singing career is over, before dying in a car crash, which Adrianna survives. She steals Javier's song book and performs one of his songs at his memorial service, which becomes a hit. She is then blackmailed by Javier's uncle, Victor, who becomes her manager and takes a huge portion of her earnings and forces her to do some things she finds uncomfortable, such as taking half naked photos and forming a snobby famous image that did not exist before. Navid, realizing the blackmail, asks Adrianna not to give in to the threats of Victor. Adrianna decides to take control of her career from Victor after seeing herself on the cover of a magazine. She begins to treat Victor badly and starts alienating Navid and her friends. Navid, however, begins to have family problems when he and Silver discover that his father has been employing underage girls to be in his porn films. Adrianna is oblivious to his problems, causing him and Silver to become closer.|$|E

Mulder decides to test his theories that noncompliance with the community rules is the motive by sticking a plastic flamingo in the yard, damaging the mailbox, among other antics. Mulder later finds a note in his mailbox that says, [...] "Be like the others... before it gets dark". After dark, Mulder brings out his basketball hoop, and Shroeder runs over to frantically argue with Mulder to <b>put</b> <b>it</b> <b>away.</b> Meanwhile, something {{comes out of the}} grass at Mrs. Shroeder, who screams.

500|$|Another {{instance}} of murder occurred on October 3, 1880, when Thomas Forrest stabbed Michael Carbis. Carbis, the foreman of the California mine, had fired Forrest {{the day before}} {{on account of his}} violent nature. The murder occurred near the Buckeye boarding house. Forrest initially had a pistol, but he <b>put</b> <b>it</b> <b>away</b> and drew a knife instead when he got within a few feet of Carbis. Carbis died soon after the stab wound was inflicted. Silver Reef's residents were angered by the murder and soon lynch threats were delivered. Forrest, who had been arrested soon after the murder had been committed, was transferred to the jail in St. George for his own safety. Prior to the moving of Forrest, a lynch mob gathered and followed the sheriff's escort to the St. George jail. Once there, they overpowered the sheriff, took Forrest out of his cell, and tried to hang him on a telegraph pole. When the pole broke, they took him to a cottonwood tree and hung him there. The residents of St. George were shocked at the sight of Forrest's hanging, and one man was reputed to have said, [...] "I have observed that tree growing there for the last 25 years.

500|$|When Deangelo Vickers (Will Ferrell) {{ends up in}} a coma on life support, Jo Bennett (Kathy Bates) makes Dwight Schrute (Rainn Wilson) {{the interim}} {{regional}} manager before they find a proper replacement, much to Jim Halpert's (John Krasinski) chagrin, as the office had actually functioned very smoothly during the manager hiatus. As Jim notes, everyone showed up, worked for the day with reasonable breaks, and were highly productive. Once appointed, Dwight establishes a strict management style {{in stark contrast to}} their previously relaxed style, from making the employees say the Pledge of Allegiance to setting up firewalls and long passwords to use the office's various machines and installing antique punch clocks. Jim, who had turned down the temporary manager position believing that they should not be assigned one at all, is especially unhappy with the changes, and begins pranking Dwight by suggesting that he is leading an uprising called [...] "The Fist". In order to impress Jo, Dwight buys a gun, though he is more excited when he receives a holster as a gift from a relative, and uses the gun to accessorize. Pam Halpert (Jenna Fischer) insists that he <b>put</b> <b>it</b> <b>away,</b> but Dwight accidentally fires the gun right by Andy Bernard (Ed Helms), causing him temporary hearing loss. Dwight attempts to bribe the office workers into silence with various favors, and Jim insists that Dwight do outlandish things (such as saying [...] "Shagedelic, baby") at certain promptings.|$|E

500|$|All Ballantyne's novels are, {{in his own}} words, [...] "adventure {{stories for}} young folks", and The Coral Island is no exception. It is a Robinsonade, a genre of fiction {{inspired}} by Daniel Defoe's Robinson Crusoe (1719), {{one of the most}} popular of its type, and one of the first works of juvenile fiction to feature exclusively juvenile heroes. Susan Maher, professor of English, [...] notes that in comparison to Robinson Crusoe such books generally replaced some of the original's romance with a [...] "pedestrian realism", exemplified by works such as The Coral Island and Frederick Marryat's 1841 novel Masterman Ready, or the Wreck of the Pacific. Romance, with its attention to character development, was only restored to the genre of boys' fiction with Robert Louis Stevenson's Treasure Island argues literary critic Lisa Honaker. The Coral Island, for all its adventure, is greatly occupied with the realism of domestic fiction (the domain of the realist novel); Ballantyne devotes about a third of the book to descriptions of the boys' living arrangements. The book exhibits a [...] "light-hearted confidence" [...] in its description of an adventure that was above all fun. As Ralph says in his preface: [...] "If there is any boy or man who loves to be melancholy and morose, and who cannot enter with kindly sympathy into the regions of fun, let me seriously advise him to shut my book and <b>put</b> <b>it</b> <b>away.</b> It is not meant for him." [...] Professor of English [...] has observed that [...] "the swift movement of the story from coastal England to exotic Pacific island is similar to the swift movement from the real world to the fantastic in children's fantasy".|$|E

2500|$|The Dodgers {{opened their}} next road trip with a 12–0 rout of the Reds in Cincinnati. Rafael Furcal had five {{hits in the}} game, which {{included}} a rain delay of two hours and 24 minutes {{in the top of}} the fifth inning. In the following game, Clayton Kershaw pitched 7 solid innings and Andre Ethier hit his first home run since coming off the disabled list as the Dodgers won 6–2. In the series finale, the Reds avoided the sweep as pitcher Bronson Arroyo clocked a three-run home run off Dodger starter John Ely in the Reds 7–1 victory. The Dodgers next traveled to Fenway Park to open an interleague series against the Boston Red Sox. The series was a bit of a curiosity because it marked the first return to Fenway by Manny Ramirez since his trade from the Red Sox two seasons before. Three of the Red Sox hit home runs off rookie Carlos Monasterios and the Dodgers fell 10–6 in the opener. Vicente Padilla [...] returned to the starting rotation in the second game, his first start since being placed on the DL in late April, but the Dodgers lost 5–4 on a walk-off single by Dustin Pedroia. Hiroki Kuroda pitched well in the finale, but Boston starter Clay Buchholz shut down the Dodgers 2–0 for the series sweep. The Dodgers losing streak reached five when they dropped the opener of their next series 6–3 at Anaheim. Bobby Abreu tied the game with a three-run homer off Kershaw in the sixth and Kevin Frandsen <b>put</b> <b>it</b> <b>away</b> with a two-run double in the seventh. The next day, a couple of base running blunders by Kemp and Russell Martin cost the Dodgers a chance to tie the game in the ninth and they dropped their sixth straight, losing to the Angels 2–1. The poor road trip finally reached an end with a 10–6 victory over the Angels, snapping the losing streak. A five-run fifth against Angels starter Scott Kazmir did most of the damage in a game in which every position player, other than Kemp, had at least one RBI.|$|E
2500|$|Although trusts do not, generally, {{require any}} {{formality}} to be established, formality {{may be required}} in order to transfer property the settlor wishes to entrust. There are six particular situations which have returned to the cases: (1) transfers of company shares require registration, (2) trusts and transfers of land require writing and registration, (3) transfers (or [...] "dispositions") of an equitable interest require writing, (4) wills require writing and witnesses, (5) gifts that are only to be transferred in the future require deeds, and (6) bank cheques usually need to be endorsed with a signature. The modern view of formal requirements is that their purpose is to ensure the transferring party has genuinely intended to carry out the transaction. As the American lawyer, Lon Fuller, put it the purpose is to provide [...] "channels for the legally effective expression of intention", particularly where there's a common danger in large transactions that people could rush into it without thinking. However, older case law saw the courts interpreting the requirements of form very rigidly. In an 1862 case, Milroy v Lord, a man named Thomas Medley signed a deed for Samuel Lord to hold 50 Bank of Louisiana shares on trust for his niece, Eleanor Milroy. But the Court of Appeal in Chancery held that this did not create a trust (and nor was any gift effective) because the shares had not finally been registered. Similarly, in an 1865 case, Jones v Lock, Lord Cottenham LC held that because a £900 cheque was not endorsed, it could not be counted as being held on trust for his son. This was so even though the father had said [...] "I give this to baby... I am going to <b>put</b> <b>it</b> <b>away</b> for him... he may do what he likes with it" [...] and locked it in a safe. However, the more modern view, starting with Re Rose was that if the transferor had taken sufficient steps to demonstrate their intention for property to be entrusted, then this was enough. Here, Eric Rose had filled out forms to transfer company shares to his wife, and three months later this was entered into the company share register. The Court of Appeal held, however, that in equity the transfer took place when the forms were completed. In Mascall v Mascall (1984) the Court of Appeal held that, when a father filled out a deed and certificate for the transfer of land, although the transfer had not actually been lodged with HM Land Registry, in equity it the transfer was irrevocable. The trend was confirmed by the Privy Council in T Choithram International SA v Pagarani (2000), where a wealthy man publicly declared he would donate a large sum of money to a charitable foundation he had set up, but died before any transfer of the money took place. Although a gift, which is not transferred, was traditionally thought to require a deed to be enforced, the Privy Council advised this was not necessary as the property was already vested in him as a trustee, and his intentions were clear. In the case of [...] "secret trusts", where someone has written a will but also privately told the executor that they wished to donate their some part of their property in other ways, this has long been held to not contravene the Wills Act 1837 requirements for writing, because it simply works as a declaration of trust before the will. The modern trend, then, has been that so long as the purpose of the formality rules will not be undermined, the courts will not hold trusts invalid.|$|E
