Initially, she is trapped in a glass box, and her kimono is billowing like a balloon. Three Gothic ballerinas eat fruit and then collapse. Aguilera then breaks free from the box by <b>pounding</b> <b>on</b> it until it shatters. She furiously removes three moth pins from her back, and then tosses aside her kimono. A tattered, white, moth-covered dress is revealed, symbolizing her metaphoric evolution from the larva to a pupa. In addition, her hair becomes white, and moths fly around her. Near the end, Aguilera wears an Elvira-type spider dress, again proclaiming {{that she is a}} [...] "fighter".|$|E
500|$|Against Harrison's wishes, Boyd had resumed her {{modelling}} {{career in}} May 1971, having long felt isolated by her husband's {{association with the}} Hare Krishna movement. His Concert for Bangladesh aid project had then united the couple, according to their friend Chris O'Dell, who recalls Harrison as [...] "attentive and affectionate" [...] towards Boyd while planning the concerts that summer. The project's subsequent business and legal issues became a source of frustration for Harrison, as {{he spent much of}} 1972 negotiating with government departments for the release of the funds raised for the refugees. In February 1972, Harrison and Boyd were injured in an automobile accident in England, after which, author Alan Clayson writes, [...] "her recovery was impaired by George's <b>pounding</b> <b>on</b> a drum-kit that he'd set up in the next room." ...|$|E

She ended the song by lying face down while <b>pounding</b> <b>on</b> the stage with her fists. She closed the set with [...] "Get Up".

500|$|The weak/strong grapple {{system from}} the past games was removed from WWE '12 onwards. Characters now perform {{different}} moves based on their opponent's current physical state. Players now have {{a window of opportunity}} to attack while still in a downed state and can also interrupt moves and Royal Rumble eliminations with attacks. Similarly, the pinning meter from the past games has been reworked to {{make it more difficult to}} kick out as a wrestler takes more damage. The game's artificial intelligence has also been adjusted to prevent players from overusing the same move. In addition, the ability to store finishing moves has returned. [...] "Dynamic Comebacks" [...] gives players on the verge of losing the opportunity to successfully hit a combination of moves to gain two finishing moves. New [...] "wake up taunts" [...] bring a downed opponent to their feet for a finishing move (such as <b>pounding</b> <b>on</b> the ground before RKO finishing maneuver). Players also have the ability to target specific limbs during matches and perform submissions through a [...] "Breaking Point" [...] submission minigame. OMG! moments were introduced to WWE '13. These are moves than can be performed in certain situations with certain superstars when a finisher is obtained. An example of this is Mark Henry superplexing the Big Show, making the ring break and the match stop. Better weight detection was implemented to WWE '13, so the smaller Rey Mysterio can't body slam the 500 pound Big Show. In fact, super heavyweights like [...] now have different frames to better capture their enormous size. Pinning is now not only influenced by damage, but the power of the move that was previously executed. In WWE '13 alongside selecting arenas, characters and the number of finishing moves available at the start of a match (a new option, which can range from 0 to Infinite), players will be able to adjust a setting called 'Match Experience'. Three settings – [...] "Quick", [...] "Normal" [...] and [...] "Epic" [...] – will affect the overall pacing of a fight, independent of AI difficulty. Factors such as momentum, damage, enemy aggressiveness and even kick out and reversal rates will be affected.|$|E

The Southern Poverty Law Center, which tracks extremist groups, described Francis as an important white nationalist writer known for his [...] "ubiquitous presence of his columns in racist forums and his influence over {{the general direction of}} right-wing extremism" [...] in the United States. Analyst Leonard Zeskind called Francis the [...] "philosopher king" [...] of the radical right, writing that [...] "By any measure, Francis's white nationalism was as subtle as an eight-pound hammer <b>pounding</b> <b>on</b> a twelve inch I beam."

2500|$|In April 2014, Corbyn {{wrote an}} article for the Morning Star {{attributing}} the crisis in Ukraine to {{the actions of the}} North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO). He said the [...] "root of the crisis" [...] lay in [...] "the US drive to expand eastwards" [...] and described Russia's actions as [...] "not unprovoked". He has said it [...] "probably was" [...] a mistake to allow former Warsaw Pact countries to join NATO: [...] "NATO expansion and Russian expansion– one leads to the other, and one reflects the other". Corbyn's views on Ukraine, Russia, and NATO were criticised by a number of writers, including Halya Coynash of the Kharkiv Human Rights Protection Group, Anne Applebaum in The Sunday Times, Ben Judah in The Independent, and Roger Boyes in The Times. Writing for The Daily Telegraph, Edward Lucas [...] saw Corbyn as having a [...] "desire to appease Russia by sacrificing Ukraine" [...] and [...] said that Corbyn's [...] "anti-imperialist sentiments did not stretch to understanding countries such as Ukraine". Lithuanian ambassador Asta Skaisgirytė disagreed with Corbyn's portrayal of NATO, saying her country was not [...] "forced or lured into NATO as part of an American global power grab.
