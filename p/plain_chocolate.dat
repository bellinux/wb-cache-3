Oliver was an anti-obesity campaigner {{and author of a}} [...] "Practical Essay on the Use and Abuse of warm Bathing in Gluty Cases". In more recent years, Oliver's efforts have been traduced by the introduction of a version of the biscuit with a <b>plain</b> <b>chocolate</b> coating.

40|$|Fat bloom means {{a serious}} quality defect to {{chocolate}} products. Cocoa butter crystals are growing due to OSTWALD's ripening, penetrate the dark chocolate surface {{and develop a}} visible grey layer. Fat bloom was analyzed by means of HPLC. For <b>plain</b> <b>chocolates</b> bloom consists of a cocoa butter fraction with the dominating triglycerides POP, POS and SOS. For chocolate products, filled with nougat, nuts, almonds, marzipan, bloom contains triolein OOO, in addition. There are different mechanisms of bloom formation, which are started during the production process or longer periods of storage...|$|R

50|$|The product itself {{consists}} of a small round shortbread base covered with a hemisphere of Italian meringue, a whipped egg white concoction similar to marshmallow. As this soft white fondant is based on egg white rather than gelatine, {{it is much more}} delicate than marshmallow. This is then coated in a thin layer of milk or <b>plain</b> <b>chocolate</b> and, in the case of Tunnock's, wrapped in a distinctive red and silver foil for the more popular milk chocolate variety, and a blue and gold wrapping for the <b>plain</b> <b>chocolate</b> type. Several competing brands to Tunnock's, such as Lees' Foods, also include jam in the centre of the teacake.In 2013 British café chain Costa Coffee introduced the giant marshmallow teacake, which is around 3 times the size of a standard teacake, with a chocolate biscuit base topped with marshmallow and raspberry jam in the centre.|$|E
50|$|Chocolate {{ice cream}} {{is used in}} the {{creation}} of other flavors, such as rocky road. Other flavors of ice cream contain chocolate chips mixed in with the ice cream. For example, (<b>plain)</b> <b>chocolate</b> chip ice cream is made with vanilla ice cream, chocolate chocolate chip (or double chocolate chip) ice cream is made with chocolate ice cream, and mint chocolate chip ice cream is made with mint ice cream.|$|E
50|$|Sweeter whiskies {{naturally}} go {{better with}} desserts, such as Mortlach, a Speyside whisky. Benromach (from Speyside) goes well with chocolate. The Macallan (another Speyside malt) also goes well with some desserts. Lagavulin generally pairs well with <b>plain</b> dark <b>chocolate.</b>|$|R

50|$|Thayer-Martin agar (or Thayer-Martin medium) is a Mueller-Hinton agar with 5% {{chocolate}} sheep {{blood and}} antibiotics. It {{is used for}} culturing and primarily isolating pathogenic Neisseria bacteria, including Neisseria gonorrhoeae and Neisseria meningitidis, as the medium inhibits the growth of most other microorganisms. When growing Neisseria meningitidis, one usually starts with a normally sterile body fluid (blood or CSF), so a <b>plain</b> <b>chocolate</b> agar is used. Thayer-Martin agar was initially developed in 1964, with an improved formulation published in 1966.|$|E
5000|$|Chocolate {{digestive}} biscuits {{are also}} available, coated {{on one side}} with milk, dark or white chocolate. Originally produced by McVitie's in 1925 in the UK as the Chocolate Homewheat Digestive, other recent varieties include the basic biscuit with chocolate shavings throughout (chocolate [...] "chips" [...] within the biscuit mix), or a layer of caramel, mint chocolate, orange-flavoured chocolate, or <b>plain</b> <b>chocolate.</b> American travel writer Bill Bryson described the chocolate digestive as [...] "a British masterpiece". The McVitie's chocolate digestive {{is the most popular}} biscuit in the UK to dunk into tea.|$|E

The finest, <b>plain</b> dark <b>chocolate</b> couvertures contain at least 70% cocoa (both solids and butter), whereas milk chocolate usually contains up to 50%. High-quality white chocolate couvertures contain only about 35% cocoa butter.|$|R
5000|$|A {{group of}} {{scientists}} are researching {{to find out what}} flavor of ice cream people enjoy the most out of chocolate, vanilla, strawberry, and mint chocolate chip. Thirty participants were chosen to be in the experiment, half male and half female. Each participant tasted 2 spoonfuls of each flavor. They then listed the flavors in order from best tasting to least favorable. At the end of the experiment, the scientist analyzed the data both holistically and by gender. They found that vanilla was highest rated favorable among all the participants. Interestingly, they found that men prefer mint chocolate chip to <b>plain</b> <b>chocolate</b> whereas women prefer strawberry to mint chocolate chip.|$|E
50|$|In 1970 the Irish and British {{parts of}} the Jacob’s company split into two firms. The Club biscuit had by this time become popular {{throughout}} Great Britain, and was marketed in five varieties. The original Club Milk (made with milk chocolate) was joined by a Club Plain (made with <b>plain</b> <b>chocolate).</b> The term “Club” was expanded for this new product, with a golf ball used to illustrate the wrapper, rather than the Club suit of cards. Two flavoured versions, Club Orange and Club Mint, were made by adding flavouring to the cocoa cream. The Club Fruit variant included raisins in the cocoa cream between the two biscuits. A further Club Honeycomb variety followed.|$|E

50|$|Lion Cereal {{is based}} on the Lion Bar, which {{comprises}} a filled wafer, caramel, and crisp cereal, covered in milk chocolate. The cereal consists of whole-grain cereal, with a caramel paste, and the same whole-grain cereal with cocoa. Lion Cereal is fortified with many vitamins, such as Vitamin B12, Vitamin B6, Vitamin B2, Vitamin B1, and niacin. This does not have any crisp cereal, as Lion Bars do, but instead has a flake-shaped whole-grain cereal in both <b>plain</b> and <b>chocolate</b> forms.|$|R

40|$|As {{migration}} induced {{fat bloom}} {{remains one of}} the major quality issues in compositeed chocolate products, this study investigated whether cocoa butter based diacylglycerols could delay or prevent this phenomenon. A model system consisting of a plastic cylinder filled with filling and chocolate was utilized for this purpose. Using an automated image analysis procedure, the surface of the chocolate was examined at regular time intervals to detect the presence of fat bloom crystals. The chocolate was cut into different layers and analysed by HPLC and Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC) to monitor the oil migration. It was noticed that the quality characteristics of the <b>plain</b> <b>chocolates</b> only slightly changed during the one year storage period. DSC thermograms demonstrated that the oil migration was a triggering factor for the re-crystallization to βVI crystals, protruding through the chocolate surface resulting in a greyer and duller appearance. The model based on Fickian diffusion with a constant diffusivity failed to accurately describe the migration of oil into chocolate. Non-Fickian behaviour occurs as besides migration, interaction between oil and cocoa butter can also play a major role. It was concluded that the presence of diacylglycerols did not delay oil migration, nor prevented the appearance of migration induced fat bloom...|$|R
