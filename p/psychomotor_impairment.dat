Despite increasing focus on the use of antidepressants and other agents for the treatment of anxiety, benzodiazepines have remained a mainstay of anxiolytic pharmacotherapy due to their robust efficacy, rapid onset of therapeutic effect, and generally favorable side effect profile. Treatment patterns for psychotropic drugs appear to have remained stable over the past decade, with benzodiazepines being the most commonly used medication for panic disorder.|$|E

40|$|Flumazenil is {{traditionally}} administered intravenously {{to reverse the}} adverse effects of over sedation with benzodiazepines. The {{aim of this study}} was to test postoperative cognitive and psychomotor recovery from midazolam conscious sedation, following reversal with orally administered flumazenil. It was hypothesised that when administered by the oral route, flumazenil may enhance recovery over a prolonged period, thus increasing safety. Eighteen patients requiring intravenous midazolam sedation for dental treatment completed a randomised, double-blind, crossover trial. Following treatment the patients' sedation was reversed using either flumazenil or saline (as placebo), administered orally, on alternate appointments. Assessment of mood and cognitive function were undertaken using ClinPhone. cdr®, a highly sensitive and specific computerised battery of cognitive tests administered by telephone prior to sedation and every hour for seven hours post reversal. Results indicate that within 20 min of administration, oral flumazenil is capable of partially reversing some cognitive and <b>psychomotor</b> <b>impairments</b> but the attentional and stimulus discrimination effects of midazolam sedation still remain...|$|R
40|$|ATR-X {{syndrome}} (OMIM# 30032) {{is a form}} {{of mental}} retardation that arises from mutations in the ATRX gene in humans. Affected individuals often exhibit severe mental retardation, unique facial dysmorphy, <b>psychomotor</b> <b>impairments</b> and urogential abnormalities. ATRX itself is a SWI/SNF-like chromatin remodeling protein whose role in development is not yet fully understood. To study the role of ATRX in the brain, a conditional forebrain knockout model is used. Reduced forebrain size, impaired development/disorganization of the cortex and enhanced apoptosis of cortical progenitors upon differentiation are observed in this Atrxnull model. In this study, we show that the conditional knockout of Atrx in the murine cortex results in the increased activation of Parp- 1, most strikingly during early corticogenesis. An increase in DNA damage, as determined by higher levels of gammaH 2 AX, is also present during this time. This is consistent with the well-characterized role of Parp- 1 activation in response to DNA damage. Furthermore, we demonstrate that there is a severe loss of layer V Er 81 + neurons in the Atrxnull cortex. Loss of Er 81 + neurons is associated with impaired motor skills, which is a common feature of ATR-X patients...|$|R

40|$|SummaryPatients {{recovered}} from Ebola virus infection may experience short- and long-term physical, neuropsychological and social sequelae, including arthralgia, musculoskeletal pain, ophthalmic inflammation, auditory problems, fatigue, confusion, insomnia, short-term memory impairment, anxiety, depression and anorexia, all lasting from {{two weeks to}} more than two years. Currently there are no treatments for post Ebola sequelae. We hypothesize that cannabidiol (CBD) may attenuate some of these post Ebola sequelae, several {{of which have been}} postulated to result from inflammation and/or an autoimmune response. CBD has anti-inflammatory actions in various animal models. Clinical studies have shown that oral administration of CBD, compared to placebo, significantly reduces anxiety, has antinociceptive and anticonvulsant actions, and may be therapeutic for insomnia. Overall, CBD has a number of pharmacological effects that may significantly improve the mental and somatic health of patients suffering from post Ebola sequelae. In humans, CBD, at therapeutic doses, does not: 1) elicit dependence or tolerance; 2) significantly alter heart rate or blood pressure; 3) affect gastrointestinal transit; 4) produce significant cognitive or <b>psychomotor</b> <b>impairments.</b> Mild sedation and nausea are the most commonly reported adverse effects associated with CBD. CBD, based on its pharmacological effects and favorable safety profile, should be considered as a treatment for individuals with post Ebola sequelae...|$|R
40|$|Aims This paper {{aimed to}} review how {{scientific}} {{knowledge about the}} human psychobiology of MDMA has developed over time. Methods In this paper, the empirical findings from earlier and later studies will be reviewed. Results When MDMA was a novel psychoactive substance', it was not seen as a drug of abuse, as it displayed loss of efficacy. However, recreational users display a unique pattern of increasing doses, deteriorating cost-benefit ratios, and voluntary cessation. MDMA increases body temperature and thermal stress, with cortisol levels increased by 800 % in dance clubbers. It can be extremely euphoric, although negative moods are also intensified. MDMA causes apoptosis (programmed cell death) and has been investigated for cancer therapy because of its anti-lymphoma properties. Recreational users show deficits in retrospective memory, prospective memory, higher cognition, problem solving, and social intelligence. Basic cognitive skills remain intact. Neuroimaging studies show reduced serotonin transporter levels across the cerebral cortex, which are associated with neurocognitive impairments. Deficits also occur in sleep architecture, sleep apnoea, complex vision, pain, neurohormones, and psychiatric status. Ecstasy/MDMA use during pregnancy leads to <b>psychomotor</b> <b>impairments</b> in the children.

40|$|Ketamine is a noncompetitive N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) antagonist. Given the pur-ported {{role of the}} NMDA {{receptor}} {{in long-term}} potentiation, {{the primary purpose of}} the present study was to further understand the dose-related effects of ketamine on memory. The study was also designed to provide information about the relative effects of ketamine on memory versus nonmemory effects and to more fully characterize ketamine’s overall pattern and time course of effects. Single intramuscular injections of ketamine (0. 2 mg/kg, 0. 4 mg/kg) were administered to 18 healthy adult volunteers using a double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover design. Word lists were used to evaluate episodic memory (free recall, recognition memory, source memory) and metamemory. Working memory, time estimation, psychomotor performance, and subjective effects were assessed repeatedly for 5 hours after drug administration. Ketamine selectively impaired encoding (as measured by free recall) while sparing retrieval, working memory while sparing attention, and digit symbol substitu-tion task speed while sparing accuracy. Ketamine did not significantly impair recognition or source memory, metamemory, or time estimation. There were no hallucinations or increases in mystical experiences with ketamine. Memory measures were less sensitive to ketamine effects than subjective or psychomotor measures. Subjective effects lasted longer than memory and most <b>psychomotor</b> <b>impairments.</b> Ketamine produces selective, transient, dose-and time-related effects. In conjunction with previous studies of drugs with different mech-anisms of actions, the observed selectivity of effects enhances the understanding of the pharmacological mechanisms underlying memory, attention, psychomotor performance, and subjective experience...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Methylphenidate (MPH) is {{the most}} {{commonly}} used drug to treat attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) in children effectively and safely. In spite of its widespread application throughout one of the most plastic and sensitive phases of brain development, very little is known to date about its long-term effects on brain structure and function. Hence, this short review updates the influence of MPH on brain development, since recent human and animal studies suggest that MPH alters the dopaminergic system with long-term effects beyond the termination of treatment. Animal studies imply that the effects of MPH may depend on the neural responder system: Whereas structural and functional parameters are improved by MPH in animals with <b>psychomotor</b> <b>impairments,</b> they remain unaltered or get worse in healthy controls. While recent behavioural studies do not fully support such a differential effect of MPH in ADHD, the animal studies certainly prompt for further investigation of this issue. Furthermore, the abuse of MPH, when (rarely) intravenously applied, may even impair the maturation of dopaminergic fibres in subcortical brain areas. This argues for careful clinical assessment and diagnostics of ADHD symptomatology not only in conjunction with the prescription of MPH. Hence, one should be assured that MPH is only given to children with clear ADHD symptomatology leading to psychosocial impairment. The animal data suggest that under these conditions MPH is supportive for brain development and the related behaviour in children with ADHD. </p...|$|R
40|$|Thyroid hormones are {{necessary}} for normal brain development during fetal and postnatal life. The stage at which {{the central nervous system}} becomes thyroid hormone sensitive, however, has not been clearly defined. There is increasing evidence from epidemiological studies and patient reports that these hormones arc already needed for orderly development during the first trimester, when the fetus is entirely dependent on the maternal transfer of thyroxine, the main substrate for intracellular generation of the more active 3, 5, 3 ′-triiodo-thyronine for binding to the nuclear hormone receptors. A decrease in maternal circulating thyroxine during the first trimester, whether or not accompanied by increased circulating thyroid-stimulating hormone, may well result in irreversible mental and <b>psychomotor</b> <b>impairments.</b> The very frequent cause of this is an iodine intake insufficient to meet the requirements of the pregnant woman. It appears urgent to ensure the use of iodine supplements from before or very early in pregnancy, and to screen all women for hypothyroxinemia as early as possible. Maternal thyroxine continues to be important for the exposure of fetal tissues to adequate amounts of this hormone during the second and, possibly, the third trimesters. Premature birth, which interrupts this transfer, results in neonatal hypothyroxinemia. This is more severe the earlier it occurs during develop-ment, and is an important cause of the poorer mental and neuromotor development of many preterm infants. The possibility of supplying them with thyroxine during the neonatal period is being seriously tested. © Freund Publishing House Ltd. Peer Reviewe...|$|R

40|$|When {{dealing with}} the duality of traffic {{accidents}} and road safety, smoking while driving {{is one of the}} factors that, despite the social beliefs and/or misconceptions, causes a large number of injuries and deaths worldwide. Although smoking is a well-known harmful behavior for people's health, it affects health and safety in many ways, perhaps more than some segments of the population can imagine. This is the specific case of drivers. The main objective {{of this study was to}} describe the behavioral and representational aspects of drivers that modulate the smoking-accidents relation. Specifically, it focuses in the frequency and reasons why drivers smoke while driving. On the other hand, it was also considered the perception of drivers regarding the probability of penalty, the penalties imposed, and their severity. Finally, drivers' opinion on the effectiveness of such penalty in order to change this behavior was also studied. A sample of 1100 Spanish drivers was obtained from a national sampling process. The results showed that approximately the 11 % of drivers circulate regularly smoking. Among the specific reasons, the most common is that constitutes a habit of the interviewed driver. Regarding punishment, drivers considered as limited the probability of being caught. Moreover, there has been no respondents who have been fined for this behavior while driving. In general, it seems that drivers are aware of the risk implied by this behavior. However, there are very few drivers who value this as a high-risk behavior. This agrees with the respondents' opinion that it is, in other words, driving under a low sense of responsibility. This, it results logical that the sanction that the respondents believe more appropriate for the behavior of smoking while driving is an economic penalty. As a conclusion, it has been remarked that there is a clear lack of correspondence between the risk perceived in this misbehavior and the frequency and motives argued to perform it while driving. It is worth mentioning that it makes important to improve the awareness and monitoring of this behavior among Spanish drivers as a manner to, first, promote healthy habits among key sectors of population, and, second, to prevent potential road crasher related to the <b>psychomotor</b> <b>impairments</b> that this behavior implies on driving performance...|$|R
