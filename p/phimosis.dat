5|$|<b>Phimosis</b> is the {{inability}} to retract the foreskin over the glans penis. At birth, the foreskin cannot be retracted due to adhesions between the foreskin and glans, and this is considered normal (physiological <b>phimosis).</b> Over time the foreskin naturally separates from the glans, {{and a majority of}} boys are able to retract the foreskin by age three. Less than one percent are still having problems at age 18. If {{the inability}} to do so becomes problematic (pathological <b>phimosis)</b> circumcision is a treatment option. This pathological <b>phimosis</b> may be due to scarring from the skin disease balanitis xerotica obliterans (BXO), repeated episodes of balanoposthitis or forced retraction of the foreskin. Steroid creams are also a reasonable option and may prevent the need for surgery including in those with mild BXO. The procedure may also be used to prevent the development of <b>phimosis.</b> <b>Phimosis</b> is also a complication that can result from circumcision.|$|E
5|$|Circumcision {{may be used}} {{to treat}} {{pathological}} <b>phimosis,</b> refractory balanoposthitis and chronic or recurrent urinary tract infections (UTIs). The World Health Organization promotes circumcision to prevent female-to-male HIV transmission in countries with high rates of HIV. The International Antiviral Society-USA also suggests circumcision be discussed with MSM who engage in primarily insertive anal sex, especially in areas where HIV is common.|$|E
5|$|Male {{circumcision}} is {{the removal}} of the foreskin from the human penis. In the most common procedure, the foreskin is opened, adhesions are removed, and the foreskin is separated from the glans. After that, a circumcision device may be placed and then the foreskin is cut off. Topical or locally injected anesthesia is used to reduce pain and physiologic stress. For adults and children, general anesthesia is an option and the procedure may be performed without a specialized circumcision device. The procedure is most often an elective surgery performed on babies and children for religious or cultural reasons. In other cases it may be done as a treatment for certain medical conditions or for preventative reasons. Medically it is a treatment option for problematic cases of <b>phimosis,</b> balanoposthitis that does not resolve with other treatments, and chronic urinary tract infections (UTIs). It is contraindicated in cases of certain genital structure abnormalities or poor general health.|$|E
25|$|<b>Phimosis</b> {{in older}} {{children}} and adults can vary in severity, with some able to retract their foreskin partially (relative <b>phimosis),</b> and some completely unable to retract their foreskin even when the penis is in the flaccid state (full <b>phimosis).</b>|$|E
25|$|While {{circumcision}} prevents <b>phimosis,</b> {{studies of}} the incidence of healthy infants circumcised for each prevented case of <b>phimosis</b> are inconsistent.|$|E
25|$|Circumcision is {{sometimes}} performed for <b>phimosis,</b> and is effective, {{but this was}} becoming less common as of 2012.|$|E
25|$|<b>Phimosis</b> {{may occur}} after {{other types of}} chronic {{inflammation}} (such as balanoposthitis), repeated catheterization, or forcible foreskin retraction.|$|E
25|$|<b>Phimosis</b> {{may also}} arise in {{untreated}} diabetics {{due to the}} presence of glucose in their urine giving rise to infection in the foreskin.|$|E
25|$|Tubal <b>phimosis</b> {{refers to}} a {{situation}} where the tubal end is partially occluded, in this case fertility is impeded, and the risk of an ectopic pregnancy is increased.|$|E
25|$|Date unknown: Hanaoka-shi chijitsu zushiki, a one-volume {{illustrated}} {{book that}} depicts his {{operations for the}} treatment of conditions such as <b>phimosis,</b> arthritis, necrosis, choanal atresia, and hemorrhoids.|$|E
25|$|Others have {{described}} incidences in adolescents and adults {{as high as}} 50%, though {{it is likely that}} many cases of physiological <b>phimosis</b> or partial nonretractility were included.|$|E
25|$|Physiologic <b>phimosis,</b> {{common in}} males 10 {{years of age}} and younger, is normal, and does not require intervention. Non-retractile {{foreskin}} usually becomes retractable during the course of puberty.|$|E
25|$|Pathological <b>phimosis</b> (as {{opposed to}} the natural non-retractability of the {{foreskin}} in childhood) is rare and the causes are varied. Some cases may arise from balanitis (inflammation of the glans penis).|$|E
25|$|David Reimer {{was born}} in Winnipeg, Manitoba. He was {{originally}} named Bruce, and his identical twin was named Brian. At {{the age of six}} months, after concern was raised about how both of them urinated, the boys were diagnosed with <b>phimosis.</b> They were referred for circumcision at the age of seven months. On April 27, 1966, a urologist performed the operation using the unconventional method of cauterization, but the procedure did not go as doctors had planned, and Bruce's penis was burned beyond surgical repair. The doctors chose not to operate on Brian, whose <b>phimosis</b> soon cleared without surgical intervention.|$|E
25|$|US {{president}} James Garfield {{was assassinated}} by Charles Guiteau in 1881. Guiteau's autopsy report {{indicated that he}} had <b>phimosis.</b> At the time, {{this led to the}} speculation that Guiteau's murderous behavior was due to phimosis-induced insanity.|$|E
25|$|If <b>phimosis</b> {{in older}} {{children}} or adults is not causing acute and severe problems, nonsurgical measures may be effective. Choice of treatment is often determined by whether circumcision {{is viewed as}} an option of last resort to be avoided or as the preferred course.|$|E
25|$|In {{some cases}} a cause {{may not be}} clear, {{or it may be}} {{difficult}} to distinguish physiological <b>phimosis</b> from pathological if an infant appears to be in pain with urination or has obvious ballooning of the foreskin with urination or apparent discomfort. However, ballooning does not indicate urinary obstruction.|$|E
25|$|Lichen sclerosus et atrophicus (thought to be {{the same}} {{condition}} as balanitis xerotica obliterans) is regarded as a common (or even the main) cause of pathological <b>phimosis.</b> This is a skin condition of unknown origin that causes a whitish ring of indurated tissue (a cicatrix) to form near the tip of the prepuce. This inelastic tissue prevents retraction.|$|E
25|$|<b>Phimosis</b> is a {{condition}} in which the foreskin of the penis cannot be pulled back past the glans. A balloon-like swelling under the foreskin may occur with urination. In teenagers and adults, it may result in pain during an erection, but is otherwise not painful. Those affected are at greater risk of inflammation of the glans, known as balanitis, and other complications.|$|E
25|$|In young children, it {{is normal}} {{to not be}} able to pull back the foreskin. In more than 90% of cases, this {{inability}} resolves by the age of seven, and in 99% of cases by age 16. Occasionally, <b>phimosis</b> may be caused by an underlying condition such as scarring due to balanitis or balanitis xerotica obliterans. This can typically be diagnosed by seeing scarring of the opening of the foreskin.|$|E
25|$|According to some accounts, <b>phimosis</b> {{prevented}} Louis XVI of France from impregnating {{his wife}} for the first seven years of their marriage. She was 14 and he was 15 when they married in 1770. However, the presence and nature of his genital anomaly is not considered certain, and some scholars (such as Vincent Cronin and Simone Bertiere) assert that surgical repair would have been mentioned in the records of his medical treatments if it had indeed occurred. It should be mentioned that non-retractile prepuce in adolescence is normal, common, and usually resolves with increasing maturity.|$|E
25|$|After he {{finished}} reading his poem, a black hood was {{placed over the}} smiling Guiteau's head and moments later the gallows trapdoor was sprung, the rope breaking his neck instantly with the fall. Guiteau's body was not returned to his family, as {{they were unable to}} afford a private funeral, but was instead autopsied and buried {{in a corner of the}} jailyard. Upon his autopsy it was discovered that Guiteau had the condition known as <b>phimosis,</b> an inability to retract the foreskin, which at the time was thought to have caused insanity that led him to assassinate Garfield.|$|E
500|$|Important {{risk factors}} for penile cancer include <b>phimosis</b> and HPV infection, {{both of which are}} mitigated by circumcision. [...] The {{mitigating}} effect circumcision has on the risk factor introduced by the possibility of <b>phimosis</b> is secondary, in that the removal of the foreskin eliminates the possibility of <b>phimosis.</b> [...] This can be inferred from study results that show uncircumcised men with no history of <b>phimosis</b> are equally likely to have penile cancer as circumcised men. [...] Circumcision is also associated with a reduced prevalence of cancer-causing types of HPV in men and a reduced risk of cervical cancer (which is caused by a type of HPV) in female partners of men. [...] As penile cancer is rare (and may become increasingly rare as HPV vaccination rates rise), and circumcision has risks, the practice is not considered to be valuable solely as a prophylactic measure against penile cancer in the United States.|$|E
500|$|Neonatal {{circumcision}} {{is generally}} safe when done by an experienced practitioner. The most common acute complications are bleeding, infection and {{the removal of}} either {{too much or too little}} foreskin. [...] These complications occur in approximately 0.12% of procedures, and constitute the vast majority of all acute circumcision complications in the United States. [...] Minor complications are reported to occur in three percent of procedures. Severe complications are rare. A specific complication rate is difficult to determine due to scant data on complications and inconsistencies in their classification. Complication rates are greater when the procedure is performed by an inexperienced operator, in unsterile conditions, or when the child is at an older age. Significant acute complications happen rarely, occurring in about 1 in 500 newborn procedures in the United States. Severe to catastrophic complications, including death, are so rare that they are reported only as individual case reports. Other possible complications include buried penis, chordee, <b>phimosis,</b> skin bridges, urethral fistulas, and meatal stenosis. These complications may be avoided with proper technique, and are most often treatable without requiring a hospital visit.|$|E
2500|$|A {{number of}} medical reports of <b>phimosis</b> {{incidence}} {{have been published}} over the years. They vary widely because of the difficulties of distinguishing physiological <b>phimosis</b> (developmental nonretractility) from pathological <b>phimosis,</b> definitional differences, ascertainment problems, and the multiple additional influences on post-neonatal circumcision rates in cultures where most newborn males are circumcised. [...] A commonly cited incidence statistic for pathological <b>phimosis</b> is 1% of uncircumcised males., When <b>phimosis</b> is simply equated with nonretractility of the foreskin after age 3 years, considerably higher incidence rates have been reported.|$|E
2500|$|Ventral slit (sub{{incision}}) is an incision {{along the}} lower {{length of the}} foreskin {{from the tip of}} the frenulum {{to the base of the}} glans, removing the frenulum in the process. [...] Often used when frenulum breve occurs alongside the <b>phimosis.</b>|$|E
2500|$|Topical steroid creams such as betamethasone, {{mometasone}} furoate and cortisone {{are effective in}} treating <b>phimosis</b> and may provide an alternative to circumcision. [...] It is theorized that the steroids work by reducing the body's inflammatory and immune responses, and also by thinning the skin.|$|E
2500|$|The most acute {{complication}} is paraphimosis. In this condition, the glans is {{swollen and}} painful, and the foreskin is immobilized by the swelling in a partially retracted position. The proximal penis is flaccid. [...] Some studies found <b>phimosis</b> to be {{a risk factor}} for urinary retention and carcinoma of the penis.|$|E
2500|$|Medical {{associations}} advise not {{to retract}} the foreskin of an infant, {{in order to}} prevent scarring. Some authors use the terms [...] "physiologic" [...] and [...] "pathologic" [...] to distinguish between these types of phimosis; others use the term [...] "non-retractile foreskin" [...] to distinguish this developmental condition from pathologic <b>phimosis.</b>|$|E
2500|$|Kellogg was {{a skilled}} surgeon, who often donated his {{services}} to indigent patients at his clinic. Although generally against unnecessary surgery to treat diseases, in his Plain Facts for Old And Young he advocated circumcision as {{a remedy for}} [...] "local uncleanliness" [...] (which he thought could lead to [...] "unchastity"), <b>phimosis,</b> and [...] "in small boys", masturbation.|$|E
2500|$|A {{man whose}} penis has {{suffered}} a blunt trauma, severe bend or other injury during intercourse or masturbation may, rarely, sustain a penile fracture or suffer from Peyronie's disease. <b>Phimosis</b> is [...] "a contracted foreskin (that) may cause trouble by hurting when an attempt is made to pull the foreskin back". In these cases, any energetic manipulation of the penis can be problematic.|$|E
2500|$|Suggestions that Louis {{suffered}} from <b>phimosis,</b> which was relieved by circumcision, have been discredited. [...] Nevertheless, following Joseph's intervention, {{the marriage was}} finally consummated in August 1777. Eight months later, in April 1778, it was suspected that the queen was pregnant, which was officially announced on May 16. Marie Antoinette's daughter, Marie-Thérèse Charlotte, Madame Royale, was born at Versailles on 19 December 1778. The child's paternity was contested in the libelles.|$|E
2500|$|Typically, it {{resolves}} without {{treatment by}} the age of three. Efforts to pull back the foreskin {{during the early years of}} a young male’s life should not be attempted. For those in whom the condition does not improve further time can be given or a steroid cream may be used to attempt to loosen the tight skin. If this method, combined with stretching exercises, is not effective, then other treatments such as circumcision may be recommended. A potential complication of <b>phimosis</b> is paraphimosis, where the tight foreskin becomes trapped behind the glans. The word is from the Greek phimos (φῑμός), meaning [...] "muzzle".|$|E
2500|$|Research by Øster (1968) {{found that}} with the onset and {{continuation}} of puberty, the proportion of boys able to pull back their foreskins increased. At ages 12–13, Øster found that only 60% of boys were able to retract their foreskins; this increased to 85% by ages 14–15, and 95% by 16–17. He also found that 1% of those unable to fully retract experienced <b>phimosis</b> at ages 14–17, the remainder were partially able to. The findings were supported by further research by Kayaba et al (1996) on a sample of over 600 boys, and Ishikawa and Kawakita (2004) found that by age 15, 77% of their sample of boys could retract their foreskins. [...] Beaugé (1997) reports that boys may assist the development of retractile foreskin by manual stretching.|$|E
