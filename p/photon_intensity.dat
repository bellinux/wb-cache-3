40|$|Decoy state method closes source {{security}} loophole {{in quantum}} key distribution (QKD) using laser source. In this method, accurate estimates of the detection rates of vacuum and single photon events plus the error rate of single photon events are needed to give a good enough lower bound of the secret key rate. Nonetheless, the current estimation method for these detection and error rates, which uses three types of <b>photon</b> <b>intensities,</b> is accurate up to about 1 % relative error. Here I report an experimentally feasible way that greatly improves these estimates and hence increases the one-way key rate of the BB 84 QKD protocol with unbiased bases selection by at least 20 % on average in realistic settings. The major tricks are the use of more than three types of <b>photon</b> <b>intensities</b> plus the fact that estimating bounds of the above detection and error rates is numerically stable although these bounds {{are related to the}} inversion of a high condition number matrix.

40|$|Abstract. Photon {{propagation}} in tissue can {{be calculated}} using the relationship described by the transport equation. For scattering tissue this relationship is often simplified and {{expressed in terms of}} the diffusion approximation. This approximation, however, is not valid for non-scattering regions, for example cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) below the skull. This study looks at the effects of a thin clear layer in a simple model representing the head and examines its effect on image reconstruction. Specifically, boundary <b>photon</b> <b>intensities</b> (total number of photons exiting at a point on the boundary due to a source input at another point on the boundary) are calculated using the transport equation and compared with data calculated using the diffusion approximation for both non-scattering and scattering regions. The effect of non-scattering regions on the calculated boundary <b>photon</b> <b>intensities</b> is presented together with the advantages and restrictions of the transport code used. Reconstructed images are then presented where the forward problem is solved using the transport equation for a simple two-dimensional system containing a non-scattering ring and the inverse problem is solved using the diffusion approximation to the transport equation. 1...|$|R

5000|$|The theory (for which {{empirical}} support {{has yet to}} be developed) states that in each functional module of the visual cortex, Fourier analysis is performed on the receptive field and the neurons in each module are thought to respond selectively to various orientations and frequencies of sine wave gratings. When all of the visual cortex neurons that are influenced by a specific scene respond together, the perception of the scene is created by the summation of the various sine-wave gratings. (This procedure, however, does not address the problem of the organization of the products of the summation into figures, grounds, and so on. It effectively recovers the original (pre-Fourier analysis) distribution of <b>photon</b> <b>intensity</b> and wavelengths across the retinal projection, but does not add information to this original distribution. So the functional value of such a hypothesized procedure is unclear. Some other objections to the [...] "Fourier theory" [...] are discussed by Westheimer (2001) [...] ). One is generally not aware of the individual spatial frequency components since all of the elements are essentially blended together into one smooth representation.

50|$|Therefore, {{while the}} mirrors may enforce nodes on the allowed {{electric}} fields {{to force a}} null result of the MM test, it remains possible that the velocity of propagation of the amplitude function (which is the velocity of energy propagation) within the apparatus travels at a speed of C {{with respect to a}} preferred frame only. A non-null result of a group velocity equivalent of the MM test is thus possible, and such a test is therefore a critical new test for space-time theory. A group velocity equivalent of the MM test is possible with the recently developed technology of ultrashort laser pulses One hundred and fifty femtosecond laser pulses of fundamental angular frequency &omega; can be split in two by a beam splitter, sent through two mutually perpendicular paths and recombined. The recombined pulse can be sent through a non-linear doubling crystal to produce second harmonic (2&omega;) photons, and then through a filter to eliminate the fundamental. (Here, the entire fringe pattern passes through the doubling crystal.) The 2&omega; <b>photon</b> <b>intensity</b> can be monitored over time. Since the number of 2&omega; photons produced in the doubling crystal is nonlinear, many more photons will be produced if the two pulses arrive at the crystal simultaneously than will be produced if the two pulses arrive separately. Thus by measuring the number of 2&omega; photons produced, it is possible to measure the relative arrival time of the two pulses. If the velocity of energy propagation is C with respect to the ether, as proposed here, rotation of the device will cause a shift in the relative arrival time (following the traditional MM arguments), and this will cause a change in the number of 2&omega; photons produced by the crystal. If the Einstein or Lorentz theory is more representative of nature, the relative arrival time of the pulses will not change during rotation, {{and there will be no}} change in the number of 2&omega; photons produced by the crystal. Since it is known that if the path lengths of the two apparatus arms are held fixed, no fringe shift is observed, this information can be used to lock the path lengths to a constant relative value by sending a continuous wave HeNe laser beam into the apparatus through a dichroic beam splitter, detecting the interference pattern of the HeNe beam, and using a piezoelectric spacer to lock the interference pattern onto a single fringe. Thus with such a locked apparatus, the Earth’s rotation can rotate the device. The phase of reflected light is dependent upon frequency, both in metallic and dielectric mirrors, but this effect can be overcome for the proposed test. Efforts in the last ten years on ultrafast laser pulse generation have relied on the development of mirrors that reflect ultrafast pulses without broadening them to any significant extent. The relevant point is that the mirrors have flat amplitude and phase response over the bandwidth of the pulses. Such mirrors have already been developed for the pulse lengths required for a group velocity equivalent of the MM test. Note that while the axioms presented herein do allow for a non-null result of a group velocity equivalent of the MM test, the axioms proposed herein do not require a non-null result. It is, of course, possible that the MM apparatus mirrors affect the group velocity of light as well. While it is best for theories to make firm predictions upon which they can be judged, in this case the theory proposed herein merely allows a non-null result of a group velocity equivalent of the MM test; no firm prediction can be made; the test is equivocal. But the Einstein and Lorentz theories do not allow a non-null result, so should a non-null result be experimentally obtained, it would be strong evidence that the best theory of space and time is that proposed herein.|$|E
