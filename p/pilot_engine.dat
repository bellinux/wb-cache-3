5|$|The final {{gradient}} from Camden Town to Euston {{involved a}} crossing over the Regent's Canal {{that required a}} gradient of over 1 in 68. Because steam trains at the time could not climb such an ascent, they were cable-hauled on the down line towards Camden until 1844, after which they used a <b>pilot</b> <b>engine.</b> The L's Act of Parliament prohibited the use of locomotives in the Euston area, following concerns of local residents about noise and smoke from locomotives toiling up the incline.|$|E
2500|$|Cornwall was a famously {{successful}} high-speed passenger {{express engine}} of its period. Charles Rous-Marten (cited in [...] ) reported an 1884 run from Crewe to Chester behind Cornwall (now far from new, and of antiquated design) {{at an average}} speed of 50.7mph, reaching 70mph down Whitmore bank. It remained in express service on the Liverpool-Manchester route until withdrawn in 1902 and became an inspection locomotive. In 1921 the locomotive was recorded as returning to Crewe from London as the <b>pilot</b> <b>engine</b> to a regular express. In 1925, Ahrons reports that {{it was still in}} service hauling the Mechanical Engineer's inspection coach.|$|E
5000|$|Further {{difficulties}} {{arise from}} the problem of fitting the <b>pilot,</b> <b>engines,</b> flight equipment, and payload all within {{the depth of the}} wing section.|$|R
50|$|A flying wing is a {{tailless}} design {{which also}} lacks a distinct fuselage, having the <b>pilot,</b> <b>engines,</b> etc. located directly in {{or on the}} wing.|$|R

2500|$|The S.21 was a low-wing {{cantilever}} monoplane of all-metal construction. It featured {{an inverted}} gull wing, with the aircraft's tail carried on twin booms. The compact fuselage nacelle carried the <b>pilot,</b> <b>engine</b> and the aircraft's armament. The pilot {{sat in a}} heavily glazed cockpit in {{the nose of the}} nacelle, with the engine, a Daimler-Benz DB 600Ga liquid-cooled inverted V12 engine rated at [...] for takeoff and at [...] at , driving a three-bladed propeller, was situated immediately behind the pilot. The engine was cooled by a radiator in the nose of the aircraft below the cockpit. A nosewheel undercarriage was fitted.|$|E
2500|$|To {{meet this}} goal, the Bearcat's {{fuselage}} was about [...] {{shorter than the}} Hellcat, and was cut down vertically behind the cockpit area. This allowed {{the use of a}} bubble canopy, the first to be fit to a US Navy fighter. The vertical stabilizer was the same height as the Hellcat's, but increased aspect ratio, giving it a thinner look. Similarly, the main wing had the same span, but having lower thickness, especially at the root. Structurally the fuselage used flush riveting as well as spot welding, with a heavy gauge 302W aluminum alloy skin suitable for carrier landings. Armor protection was provided for the <b>pilot,</b> <b>engine</b> and oil cooler.|$|E
2500|$|The line {{north of}} the {{junction}} at Stanley was single track, resulting in delays, especially after trains had waited for connections at Perth. From 1890, the signalling system using telegraph orders was replaced by electric tablets, later automatic tablet exchange systems were used. The [...] climb out of Inverness was doubled in 1898, and [...] of line widened over the Grampians between 1901 and 1909. Snow could close the line for days during the winter, and snow fences were erected beside the railway. The Highland had three types of snow plough; a small one that was fitted to locomotives, now capable of hauling trains through [...] drifts. If the snow was less than [...] deep, a <b>pilot</b> <b>engine</b> with a larger plough would precede the train. An even larger plough could be used {{with three or four}} locomotives coupled together. Dava Moor and the cuttings near Druimuachdar summit were troublesome, although the line over the summit improved after it had been doubled.|$|E
50|$|On 1 January 1876 the Bristol and Exeter Railway was amalgamated {{with the}} Great Western Railway, {{after which the}} {{locomotives}} were given new numbers. They were used as <b>pilot</b> <b>engines</b> at large stations and on other light duties shared with the GWR Hawthorn Class.|$|R
5000|$|Hawes Junction {{station was}} {{approximately}} 3.5 mi south of Ais Gill summit, {{the highest point}} on the steeply graded Settle and Carlisle line. The Midland Railway, who owned and operated the line, had a policy of using small engines only, and many trains (both northbound and southbound) required assistance from <b>pilot</b> <b>engines</b> to climb the [...] "big hump" [...] to Ais Gill summit. At Ais Gill summit the <b>pilot</b> <b>engines</b> were uncoupled and ran on the up (southbound) line to Hawes Junction, {{where there was a}} turntable {{at the end of the}} [...] "back platform road" [...] (a loop line and platform alongside the down main line). Having been turned, light engines were usually coupled together to return to their depots (usually Leeds to the south or Carlisle to the north).|$|R

2500|$|Nakajima's team {{considered}} the new requirements unachievable {{and pulled out}} of the competition in January. Mitsubishi's chief designer, Jiro Horikoshi, thought that the requirements could be met, but only if the aircraft were made as light as possible. Every possible weight-saving measure was incorporated into the design. Most of the aircraft was built of a new top-secret aluminium alloy developed by Sumitomo Metal Industries in 1936. Called [...] "extra super duralumin" [...] (ESD), it was lighter, stronger and more ductile than other alloys (e.g. 24S alloy) used at the time, but was prone to corrosive attack, which made it brittle. This detrimental effect was countered with an anti-corrosion coating applied after fabrication. No armour protection was provided for the <b>pilot,</b> <b>engine</b> or other critical points of the aircraft, and self-sealing fuel tanks, which were becoming common at the time, were not used. This made the Zero lighter, more maneuverable, and the longest-ranged single-engine fighter of World War II, which made it capable of searching out an enemy hundreds of kilometres away, bringing them to battle, then returning to its base or aircraft carrier. [...] However, that tradeoff in weight and construction also made it prone to catching fire and exploding when struck by enemy rounds.|$|E

5000|$|To {{prevent such}} collisions, {{the line was}} being worked by a <b>pilot</b> <b>engine</b> to escort every train through the length of single track. However, the <b>pilot</b> <b>engine</b> was being used for other duties and had waggons {{attached}} to it; moreover the distinctive small engine had been substituted for a larger one. The inexperienced pointsman saw a ballast train following the train from Glasgow and wrongly assumed {{it to be the}} <b>pilot</b> <b>engine</b> and so let the train through; just then, the Edinburgh train was approaching from the east.|$|E

50|$|A wing {{that is made}} {{deep enough}} to contain the <b>pilot,</b> <b>engines,</b> fuel, {{undercarriage}} and other necessary equipment will have an increased frontal area, when compared with a conventional wing and long-thin fuselage. This can actually result in higher drag and thus lower efficiency than a conventional design. Typically the solution adopted {{in this case is}} to keep the wing reasonably thin, and the aircraft is then fitted with an assortment of blisters, pods, nacelles, fins, and so forth to accommodate all the needs of a practical aircraft.|$|R
5000|$|Reflecting {{strongly}} prevailing cultural views {{across the}} papers across the generations, in 1952, the Sunday Pictorial ran a three-part series entitled [...] "Evil Men" [...] promising an [...] "end to the conspiracy of silence" [...] about homosexuality in Britain. [...] "Most people {{know there are}} such things - pansies - mincing, effeminate, young men who call themselves queers (...) but simple decent folk regard them as freaks and rarities." [...] The Sunday Pictorial compared homosexuality to a [...] "spreading fungus" [...] that had contaminated [...] "generals, admirals, fighter <b>pilots,</b> <b>engine</b> drivers and boxers".|$|R

50|$|The {{incident}} {{began at}} 12:36 am, when a down goods train from Bristol to Exeter, hauled by both a standard-gauge engine {{and a broad}} gauge <b>pilot</b> <b>engine,</b> arrived at Norton Fitzwarren to take on and put off stock. Another down goods train, which was not scheduled {{to stop at the}} station, was due at 1:17 am, and at 1:05 am the guard of the first goods train was told by the signalman to shunt his train clear of the down line, on to the up main, while the <b>pilot</b> <b>engine</b> was separately moved on to a branch line.|$|E
5000|$|In {{the wake}} of the train ran a <b>pilot</b> <b>engine,</b> to be ready in case of some mishap occurring, and the van at the tail of the coal train {{contained}} a number of short, stout bars of timber, to be used as sprags in case of emergency.|$|E
50|$|However, the {{gyroscopic}} {{effects of}} the heavy rotating engine produced handling problems in aircraft and the engines also consumed large amounts of oil since they used total loss lubrication, the oil being mixed with the fuel and ejected with the exhaust gases. Castor oil was used for lubrication, since it is not soluble in petrol, and the resultant fumes were nauseating to the <b>pilots.</b> <b>Engine</b> designers had always {{been aware of the}} many limitations of the rotary engine so when the static style engines became more reliable and gave better specific weights and fuel consumption, the days of the rotary engine were numbered.|$|R
5000|$|It {{was quite}} common for {{this class of}} engine to pull a typical Midland express {{weighing}} 200 and 250 LT which suited the Class 115 perfectly. Given a dry rail they could maintain a tight schedule with 350 LT. Speeds up to 90 mph were not uncommon {{and the sight of}} their whirring huge driving wheels earned them the nickname [...] "Spinners". Thanks to the Midland's practice of building low powered locomotives and relying on double-heading to cope with heavier trains many enjoyed working lives of up to 30 years. They made ideal <b>pilot</b> <b>engines</b> for the later Johnson/Deeley 4-4-0 classes.|$|R

Approaching Brantford, Ontario, 6077 was attached to a <b>pilot</b> <b>engine</b> when, sensing that the pilot locomotive engineer did not apply the brakes for a sharp bend up ahead, hit the emergency brakes. This caused all the wheels to lock up and skid which made the train much more rigid than if it had been rolling. As a result, both locomotives derailed and drop down an embankment. The <b>pilot</b> <b>engine</b> crewmen were seriously injured but all head-end crew of 6077 were killed. The passengers {{on the rest of the}} train were not harmed because the wreck had detached the engines from the passenger cars which rolled on and came to a stop at the station.|$|E
