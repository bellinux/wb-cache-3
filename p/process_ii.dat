50|$|Past cases {{involving}} tattooing and the First Amendment {{have used the}} Spence Test {{in order to determine}} whether or not the process of tattooing can be considered as having an expressive component. The Spence Test, described in Spence v. Washington states that conduct can be considered to be imbued with expressive elements of communication if the conduct is intended to communicate a message and the conduct is likely to be understood as being communicative by its intended audience. If the conduct is considered to be communicative, free speech protection may apply. However, the government has a freer hand in the regulation <b>process.</b> <b>ii</b> Regulations must follow the O’Brien Test. The O'Brien Test states that the government can regulate communicative conduct if it is within the government's constitutional right to do so, the regulation furthers an important governmental interest that is unrelated to the suppression of speech, and the regulation is narrowly tailored to prohibit no more speech than is essential to further that interest.|$|E
50|$|In 1985, Welch {{was invited}} to {{participate}} in the Construction in <b>Process</b> <b>II</b> exhibition in Munich and created the video The Voice of Clint Eastwood in Germany. For this project, Welch dialogued with German actors who dub English language films and shot additional video with sound engineers at the Bavaria Film Studio. While teaching at the University of Texas at Austin in 1990, Welch created photo portraits of elementary school children in Austin on the theme of what each wanted to be when they grew up and their visions of the future. The Austin Children series was exhibited at the Liverpool Gallery in Brussels in 1991. In the mid-1990s Welch made a series of photos with frames that structurally mimic the pose or movement of the subject. Of these works, his largest photo installation, The History of Design was completed in 2000 and exhibited at the Neuberger Museum of Art in Purchase, New York. The History of Design is a 48 ft. wide Parthenon-like pediment framing life-size photo images of young workers in the process of constructing a wall.|$|E

40|$|A new dual {{dipping process}} has been {{introduced}} for {{the increase in the}} fracture strength of casting mold through the effective glassification of inorganic binder precursors. Two different dipping processes have been employed to investigate the reactivity of the precursors. Process I is that the substrate was coated with a sodium oxide (Na 2 O) precursor through dipping in the solution, and then a silicon dioxide (SiO 2) precursor was coated onto the substrate coated with the Na 2 O precursor. <b>Process</b> <b>II</b> is the inverse coating sequence for process I. In the case of the mold prepared by process I, the glass phase converted from the precursors is uniformly observed at the surface of the particle and the interface between particles, compared with that by <b>process</b> <b>II,</b> inducing that the fracture strength of the mold prepared by process I is significantly improved. In addition, when the PDMS without a sol-gel reaction was used as the SiO 2 precursor, especially in <b>process</b> <b>II,</b> the glass phase is not absolutely observed at the surface of the particle owing to the evaporation of PDMS and Na ion during the heat treatment, resulting in the collapse of the mold sample after the heat treatment...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. We {{investigated}} two {{processes to}} fabricate unsaturated polyesters, UP, {{to serve as}} a stamp to emboss a microfluidic chip to apply to a peristaltic micropump. The mechanical properties of UP are great to apply to vibration type micro-actuators. However, it’s rarely discussed academically. As a result, we proposed two processes developed and compared macro- and micro-scopically. It was first observed that process I of traditional UP curing process and <b>process</b> <b>II</b> of modified process can both replicate the geometries of microfludic chips well macroscopically. In addition, the former one has macroscopic defaults like cracks, bend, and separation between vessel and UP molds, while the latter one doesn’t. Optical microscope and confocal microscope are also applied to verify the replication effects microscopically. Again, both processes illustrate good replication results with variation of both lengths and areas all less than 10 %, while <b>process</b> <b>II</b> has better geometries and lower deviation on different sites. The process I was proven that the averages of depth and widest width change rates for replication are- 1. 06 % (between- 4. 15 % and 2. 89 %) and- 2. 77 % (between- 6. 93 % and 0. 67 %), respectively. And, the replication results of <b>process</b> <b>II</b> shows also reasonable change and even smaller deviations that the averages of depth and widest width change rates are- 4. 77 % (between- 6. 33 % and- 3. 84 %) and 1. 53 % (between 1. 15 % and 2. 15 %), respectively. 1...|$|E

Payback times can be relatively short. Many FSS systems are installed with little data conversion and limited interfacing. In most cases, this is more than sufficient to achieve the benefits. In <b>Process</b> MRP <b>II</b> environments, the major benefit to the enterprise when FSS is fully implemented is that the FSS establishes clear set of requirements that the <b>Process</b> MRP <b>II</b> system must support.

40|$|Binary water {{mixtures}} usually display a water relaxation (<b>process</b> <b>II)</b> {{which can be}} studied by broadband dielectric spectroscopy (BDS) at subzero temperatures. In a large collection of binary {{water mixtures}}, a slight increase of the relaxation strength is observed for low water concentration, whereas a faster increase is seen above a critical concentration. The assumption behind this result is that at high water concentration self-associations of water molecules {{are present in the}} solutions. In this work, we have studied poly(propylene glycol) water solutions by means of broadband dielectric spectroscopy and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) using the attenuated total reflectance method (ATR) in the temperature range of 120 - 300 K. By combining both techniques, we found a critical water concentration x w = 0. 20 above which the relaxation strength of the water relaxation (<b>process</b> <b>II)</b> increases more rapidly than at low water concentration indicating the self-association of water molecules. © 2011 American Chemical Society.
