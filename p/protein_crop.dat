The most {{well-known}} species is Synchytrium endobioticum, a parasite of Solanaceae; {{it is the}} causal agent of black wart in potatoes. Synchytrium anemones can cause harm to anemone and thalictrum flowers. Synchytrium aureum infects many agricultural and horticultural plants. Synchytrium vaccinii creates galls on cranberry, azalea, chamaedaphne, gaultheira, and ledum. Synchytrium fragariae infects strawberry plants. Synchytrium trichosanthidis parasitizes an Indian curcubit, and S. sesamicola is responsible for losses in Indian crops of sesame (Sesamum indicum). [...] Synchytrium psophocarpi {{is one of the}} major diseases affecting winged bean (Psophocarpus tetragonolobus), which is important high <b>protein</b> <b>crop.</b> Synchytrium pogostemonis is the casual agent of budok (which translates as wart in a local Indonesian language), a disease of Patchouli (Pogostemon cablin). Synchytrium solstitiale parasitizes the yellow star thistle (Centaurea solstitialis), an important weed in the United States. For this reason, S. solstitiale is being considered as a biological control of the yellow star thistle in the United States. Another species being considered for biological control use is Synchytrium minutum, which occasionally parasitizes kudzu. However, S. minutum parasitizes cultivated kudzu patches more often wild patches and has also been reported from agricultural crops.|$|E

40|$|Global {{changes in}} food demand {{resulting}} from {{population growth and}} more meat-intensive diets require an increase in global <b>protein</b> <b>crop</b> production, not least as climate change and increasing scarcity of fresh water could restrict future production. In contrast to many other regions, in Finland climate change could open new opportunities through enabling more diverse cropping systems. It is justified to re-enquire whether the extent and intensity of <b>protein</b> <b>crop</b> production are optimized, resources are used efficiently and sustainably, cropping systems are built to be resilient and whether ecological services that protein crops provide are utilized appropriately. This paper aims to analyze in a descriptive manner the biological grounds for sustainable intensification of <b>protein</b> <b>crop</b> production in Finland. Production security is considered by evaluating the effects of and likelihood for constraints typical for northern conditions, examining historical and recent crop failures and estimating ecosystem services that more extensive introduction of protein crops potentially provide for northern cropping systems now and in a changing climate. There is an evident potential to expand <b>protein</b> <b>crop</b> production sustainably {{to a couple of}} times its current area. In general, variability in protein yields tends to be higher for protein crops than spring cereals. Nevertheless, protein yield variability was not necessarily systematically higher for Finland, when compared with other European regions, as it was for cereals. Protein crops provide significant ecological services that further support their expanded production. By this means protein self-sufficiency remains unrealistic, but increased production of protein crops can be achieved. The expansion of rapeseed and legumes areas also seems to be economically feasible. From the economic viewpoint, an increase in domestic protein supply requires that farmers have economic incentives to a) cultivate protein-rich crops instead of cereals, and b) use them as animal feed instead of imported sources of protein. Environmental sustainability is an argument to justify economic support for protein-rich crops and thus increase their cultivation...|$|E

The dependency of Europe on soya bean meal imports and the associated drivers are described and underline the need for change. The EIP Agri process resulted in the assessment of the present-day yield gap of protein crops using an approach based on the market values of the protein, starch and plant oil components. Oil-based protein crops seemed to be overall better positioned than starch based protein crops because the price of oil levels is higher than that of starch. Alfalfa was identified as being interesting for regions where drying cost are low. The process also resulted in the identification of opportunities and constraints to be encountered by the innovation process, combining the knowledge and physical infrastructure, market structure, co-operation and interaction and the influence of culturally determined values and beliefs.

40|$|The aim {{of organic}} farming husbandry, {{is to be}} entirely based on an {{organically}} produced diet. Shortage of organically produced <b>protein</b> <b>crops</b> for production of concentrates supplying the European market, and a contemporary ban {{on the use of}} fishmeal for ruminants in the EU has lead to an increased need for organically produced feedstuffs for production of concentrates in Norwegian organic husbandry. Pea is the most common cultivated protein-rich crop in organic agriculture in Norway. For ruminants, peas has a low bypass protein content compared to common protein supplements such as rape meal and soybean meal. Other high-protein crops with complementary properties are therefore needed to meet the demand in feed quality for ruminants, pigs and poultry. Oilseed crops, which are rich in both fat and protein, will become of considerable interest if problems related to their cultivation are solved. Currently, our experience with oilseed crops in organic agriculture is limited. In a four year research project "Organic protein feed and edible oil from oilseed crops" this experience will be extended and the feed quality of organically grown <b>protein</b> <b>crops</b> like rape, turnip rape and camelina will be evaluated. The project will provide knowledge about the rumen degradability of protein, starch and NDF (neutral detergent fibre) and intestine digestibility of protein and starch in organically grown protein-rich crops necessary for the production of concentrates with an optimal feed quality...|$|R
40|$|The cereal, oilseeds, and <b>protein</b> <b>crop</b> sector (COP) {{occupies}} a prominent {{position within the}} European Union's agricultural sector. Within Spain, the COP sector accounts for {{almost a third of}} total Agricultural Guidance and Guarantee Fund expenses, and half of the utilized agricultural area (UAA). The COP sector is not only relevant because of its physical and economic magnitude, but also because of the political attention it receives. The Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) reforms that occurred during the 1990 s paid special attention to this sector. This article aims to determine the impacts of Agenda 2000 on a sample of Spanish COP farmers' production decisions by using an output-oriented stochastic distance function. The distance function allows for an assessment of the reform-motivated changes on total output, input used, input composition, and crop mix. It also permits an assessment of the impacts of the reform on farms' technical efficiency. Copyright (c) 2009 International Association of Agricultural Economists. ...|$|E
40|$|Europe {{has become}} heavily {{dependent}} on soya bean imports, entailing trade agreements and quality standards that do not satisfy the European citizen’s expectations. White, yellow and narrow-leafed lupins are native European legumes that can become true alternatives to soya bean, given their elevated and high-quality protein content, potential health benefits, suitability for sustainable production, and acceptability to consumers. Nevertheless, lupin cultivation in Europe remains largely insufficient to guarantee a steady supply to the food industry, which in turn must innovate to produce attractive lupin-based protein-rich foods. Here, we address {{different aspects of the}} food supply chain that should be considered for lupin exploitation as a high-value protein source. Advanced breeding techniques are needed to provide new lupin varieties for socio-economically and environmentally sustainable cultivation. Novel processes should be optimized to obtain high-quality, safe lupin protein ingredients, and marketable foods need to be developed and offered to consumers. With such an integrated strategy, lupins can be established as an alternative <b>protein</b> <b>crop,</b> capable of promoting socio-economic growth and environmental benefits in Europe...|$|E
40|$|AbstractA novel {{putative}} SR protein, designated cisplatin resistance-associated overexpressed <b>protein</b> (<b>CROP),</b> {{has been}} cloned from cisplatin-resistant cell lines by differential display. The N-half of the deduced {{amino acid sequence}} of 432 amino acids of CROP contains cysteine/histidine motifs and leucine zipper-like repeats. The C-half consists mostly of charged and polar amino acids: arginine (58 residues or 25 %), glutamate (36 residues or 16 %), serine (35 residues or 15 %), lysine (30 residues, 13 %), and aspartate (20 residues or 9 %). The C-half is extremely hydrophilic and comprises domains rich in lysine and glutamate residues, rich in alternating arginine and glutamate residues, and rich in arginine and serine residues. The arginine/serine-rich domain is dominated {{by a series of}} 8 amino acid imperfect repetitive motif (consensus sequence, Ser-Arg-Ser-Arg-Asp/Glu-Arg-Arg-Arg), which has been found in RNA splicing factors. The RNase protection assay and Western blotting analysis indicate that the expression of CROP is about 2 – 3 -fold higher in mRNA and protein levels in cisplatin-resistant ACHN/CDDP cells than in host ACHN cells.
