METHODS: In the period between March 2004 and May 2008, 80 <b>penile</b> <b>prostheses</b> implantations have been performed. Any information regarding patients has been retrospectively collected consulting their case histories stored in our archive. Each patient was followed postoperatively, and surgical complications were recorded. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: All the patients entered in this study were contacted by phone by a single operator who asked for their consent to collect information regarding their operation, the use of the prostheses, and the couple satisfaction. Once the consent was obtained, a nine-point questionnaire was administered. RESULTS: Seventy-six patients (97...|$|R

40|$|AbstractErectile {{dysfunction}} (ED) {{is one of}} {{the most}} common sexual disorders in men, and the existence of an underlying cause should always be considered. It is also commonly and closely associated with age and risk factors for cardiovascular disease. Therefore, all men with ED should be screened for medical problems. Treatment of ED can enhance self-esteem, reduce psychological morbidity, and increase the emotional well-being of both partners. Today, unless contraindicated, user-friendly, effective, and safe therapies offered for the treatment of ED are lifestyle and risk factor modification (e. g., exercise and weight loss) and the use of oral phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitors, such as sildenafil, tadalafil, or vardenafil. Vacuum erection devices, intracavernous injection therapy, and <b>penile</b> <b>prostheses</b> are other options of treatment when oral medication fails.

40|$|The signal {{intensity}} of the corpora cavernosa of the penis at magnetic resonance (MR) imaging may vary {{from that of the}} corpus spongio-sum; this difference is dependent on the rate of blood flow within the cavernous spaces that constitute the corporal bodies.

40|$|Young men {{comprise}} {{the overwhelming majority}} of men with spinal cord injury (SCI), the incidence of which has been growing over the years. Due to advances in physical medicine and rehabilitation, remarkable improvements in survival rates have been reported, leading to life expectancies {{similar to those of the}} general population. However, many sexual and reproductive functions may be impaired due to erectile or ejaculatory dysfunction and semen abnormalities, characterised by low-sperm motility or viability in SCI males who have not become parents yet. Nevertheless, fatherhood is still possible through the introduction of specialised medical management, by using various medical, technical and surgical methods for sperm retrieval in combination with assisted reproductive techniques. Erectile dysfunction can be managed by the use of phosphodiesterase- 5 inhibitors, intracavernosal injections, vacuum devices and <b>penile</b> <b>prostheses.</b> Semen can be obtained from the vast majority of anejaculatory men by medically assisted ejaculation through the use of penile vibratory stimulation or electroejaculation and via prostate massage or surgical procedures.

40|$|Introduction : Autoinflation is a troublesomecomplication {{following}} penile prosthesisplacement {{that may}} be potentiated by prevesicalscarring following radical prostatectomy. Weevaluated the frequency of autoinflation andother complications following penile prosthesisplacement in radical prostatectomy patients andcontrols as a surrogate to establishing theutility of lockout reservoirs in preventingautoinflation. Methods : 139 prostheses (including 14 with lockout reservoirs) were placed in 132 men(including 35 post-prostatectomy patients) overa 5 1 / 2 year period at our institution. Outcomesassessed include postoperative complicationsand the need for revision or replacement of theprosthesis.

40|$|Our aim was {{to compare}} the {{outcomes}} and satisfaction rates of men undergoing <b>penile</b> <b>prostheses</b> implantation (PPI) secondary to radical prostatectomy (RP) and other causes of vasculogenic erectile dysfunction (ED). A total of 142 patients, of whom 60 underwent PPI due to ED following RP (Group 1) and 82 underwent PPI due to ED with other vasculogenic causes (Group 2) were included in this study. The preoperative erectile status was evaluated with the International Index of Erectile Function (IIEF). The satisfaction of patients and partners were evaluated by a telephone interview using Erectile Dysfunction Inventory of Treatment Satisfaction (EDITS) questionnaire and Erectile Dysfunction Inventory of Treatment Satisfaction Partner Survey. Preoperative mean IIEF scores were significantly lower in Group 1 (17. 5  ±  6. 4 vs. 24. 2  ±  5. 1, p =  0. 01). For Groups 1 and 2, the mean EDITS scores of the patients were 58  ±  10 and 71  ±  8, respectively, and that for the partners were 46  ±  8 and 65  ±  7, respectively. Group 1 had significantly lower scores both for the EDITS and the EDITS Partner Survey (p =  0. 03, p =  0. 01, respectively).

40|$|The {{mechanical}} reliability of AMS hydraulic <b>penile</b> <b>prostheses</b> implanted in 203 patients from April 1985 to June 1995 were evaluated. AMS Hydroflex prosthesis showed the highest incidence of mechanical failure (18. 8 %; 6 / 32 patients) during a mean follow-up period of 94. 5 (64 - 117) months. Mean functioning {{time of the}} prostheses until malfunction was 50 (0 - 100) months. Bilateral fractures at junction of rear reservior and inflation chamber were found in 3 patients. AMS Dynaflex had a failure rate of 2. 4 % (2 / 85 patients) {{for an average of}} 35. 3 (1 - 59) months. One patient showed complete fracture of silicone ball covering the proximal end of rear reservior onto which rear tip extenders are snapped. Regarding 3 -piece inflatable prosthesis, AMS 700, AMS 700 CX and AMS Ultrex had failure rates of 11. 1 % (1 / 9 patients), 10. 5 % (2 / 19 patients) and 4. 0 % (1 / 25 patients) during a mean follow-up period of 116. 4 (103 - 125), 79. 0 (60 - 94) and 44. 4 (22 - 57) months, respectively. The verified causes of the mechanical failures were a tiny rupture of the cylinder in one case of AMS 700, an incomplete fracture of input tube in one case of AMS 700 CX and a pump malfunction in one case of Ultrex. However, none of 33 cases of AMS 700 CXM showed mechanical failure for an average of 21. 3 (2 - 43) months. Therefore, AMS 700 CXM and Ultrex seem to be very reliable, and the reliability of AMS Dynaflex was much higher than that of AMS Hydroflex.

40|$|Context: Sexual {{function}} is the health-related {{quality of life}} (HRQOL) domain most commonly impaired after prostate cancer treatment; however, validated tools to enable personalized prediction of erectile dysfunction after prostate cancer treatment are lacking. Objective: To predict long-term erectile function following prostate cancer treatment based on individual patient and treatment characteristics. Design: Pretreatment patient characteristics, sexual HRQOL, and treatment details measured in a longitudinal academic multicenter cohort (Prostate Cancer Outcomes and Satisfaction With Treatment Quality Assessment; enrolled from 2003 through 2006), were used to develop models predicting erectile function 2 years after treatment. A community-based cohort (community-based Cancer of the Prostate Strategic Urologic Research Endeavor [CaPSURE]; enrolled 1995 through 2007) externally validated model performance. Patients in US academic and community-based practices whose HRQOL was measured pretreatment (N= 1201) underwent follow-up after prostatectomy, external radiotherapy, or brachytherapy for prostate cancer. Sexual outcomes among men completing 2 years' follow-up (n= 1027) were used to develop models predicting erectile function that were externally validated among 1913 patients in a community-based cohort. Main Outcome Measures: Patient-reported functional erections suitable for intercourse 2 years following prostate cancer treatment. Results: Two years after prostate cancer treatment, 368 (37 % [95 % CI, 34 %- 40 %]) of all patients and 335 (48 % [95 % CI, 45 %- 52 %]) of those with functional erections prior to treatment reported functional erections; 531 (53 % [95 % CI, 50 %- 56 %]) of patients without <b>penile</b> <b>prostheses</b> reported use of medications or other devices for erectile dysfunction. Pretreatment sexualHRQOLscore, age, serum prostate-specific antigen level, race/ethnicity, body mass index, and intended treatment details were associated with functional erections 2 years after treatment. Multivariable logistic regression models predicting erectile function estimated 2 -year function probabilities from as low as 10 % or less to as high as 70 % or greater depending on the individual's pretreatment patient characteristics and treatment details. The models performed well in predicting erections in external validation among CaPSURE cohort patients (areas under the receiver operating characteristic curve, 0. 77 [95 % CI, 0. 74 - 0. 80] for prostatectomy; 0. 87 [95 % CI, 0. 80 - 0. 94] for external radiotherapy; and 0. 90 [95 % CI, 0. 85 - 0. 95] for brachytherapy). Conclusion: Stratification by pretreatment patient characteristics and treatment details enables prediction of erectile function 2 years after prostatectomy, external radiotherapy, or brachytherapy for prostate cancer. © 2011 American Medical Association.
