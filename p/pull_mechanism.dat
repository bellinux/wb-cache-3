40|$|SummaryA male {{pronucleus}} migrates {{toward the}} center of an egg to reach the female pronucleus for zygote formation. This migration depends on microtubules growing from two centrosomes associated with the male pronucleus. Two mechanisms were previously proposed for this migration: a “pushing mechanism,” which uses the pushing force resulting from microtubule polymerization, and a “pulling mechanism,” which uses the length-dependent pulling force generated by minus-end-directed motors anchored throughout the cytoplasm. We combined two computer-assisted analyses to examine the relative contribution of these mechanisms to male pronuclear migration. Computer simulation revealed an intrinsic difference in migration behavior of the male pronucleus between the pushing and <b>pulling</b> <b>mechanisms.</b> In vivo measurements using image processing showed that the actual migration behavior in Caenorhabditis elegans confirms the <b>pulling</b> <b>mechanism.</b> A male pronucleus having a single centrosome migrated toward the single aster.

In fact, the Tagging Recognition and Acknowledgment of Informal Learning Experiences project proposes a framework to manage these types of learning, giving special attention to informal learning.

40|$|Infectious {{diseases}} {{are among the}} {{main causes of death}} and disability in developing countries, and they are a major reason for the health disparity between rich and poor countries. One of the reasons for this public health tragedy is a lack of lifesaving essential medicines, which either do not exist or badly need improvements. In this article, we analyse which of the push and <b>pull</b> <b>mechanisms</b> proposed in the recent literature may serve to promote research into neglected infectious diseases. A combination of push programmes that subsidise research inputs through direct funding and pull programmes that reward research output rather than research input may be the appropriate strategy to stimulate research into neglected diseases. On the one hand, early-stage (basic) research should be supported through push mechanisms, such as research grants or publicly financed research institutions.

40|$|In {{the funding}} of R&D, push mechanisms, such as {{research}} grants, subsidize research input, while <b>pull</b> <b>mechanisms,</b> such as innovation prizes, reward research output. By rewarding research output, <b>pull</b> <b>mechanisms</b> create strong incentives for researchers to devote non observable inputs to R&D.

In the presence of moral hazard, it might seem that push mechanisms generate weak incentives for non observable inputs from the researcher and, absent risk-sharing considerations, would be inferior to pull mechanisms; it is {{the aim of this}} paper to critically assess this hypothesis. I analyze a principal-agent model in which a funder encourages R&D activity through a push incentive (a grant) and/or a pull incentive (a prize); R&D input consists of both an observable and non observable component. In contrast to the stated hypothesis, it is shown that a grant may emerge as an optimal means of funding {{as a result of the}} interaction between adverse selection and moral hazard. The model also helps to explain the use of matching grants, it is shown that such grants serve as an effective sorting device in the presence of adverse selection...|$|R
