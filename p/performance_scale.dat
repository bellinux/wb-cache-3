Around that time, when a minor earthquake struck Los Angeles, she ran frightened into the kitchen and rapidly verbalized to some of the hospital cooks she had befriended, marking the first time she sought out comfort from another person and the first time she was so readily verbal.

25|$|In energy {{dispersive}} analysis, dispersion and detection are a single operation, {{as already mentioned}} above. Proportional counters or various types of solid-state detectors (PIN diode, Si(Li), Ge(Li), Silicon Drift Detector SDD) are used. They all share the same detection principle: An incoming X-ray photon ionises {{a large number of}} detector atoms with the amount of charge produced being proportional to the energy of the incoming photon. The charge is then collected and the process repeats itself for the next photon. Detector speed is obviously critical, as all charge carriers measured have to come from the same photon to measure the photon energy correctly (peak length discrimination is used to eliminate events that seem to have been produced by two X-ray photons arriving almost simultaneously). The spectrum is then built up by dividing the energy spectrum into discrete bins and counting the number of pulses registered within each energy bin. EDXRF detector types vary in resolution, speed and the means of cooling (a low number of free charge carriers is critical in the solid state detectors): proportional counters with resolutions of several hundred eV cover {{the low end of the}} performance spectrum, followed by PIN diode detectors, while the Si(Li), Ge(Li) and Silicon Drift Detectors (SDD) occupy the high end of the <b>performance</b> <b>scale.</b>|$|E

5000|$|The non-verbal <b>performance</b> <b>scale</b> {{was also}} a {{critical}} difference from the Binet scale. Since the [...] "early Binet scale had been persistently and consistently criticized for its emphasis on language and verbal skills," [...] Wechsler made an entire scale that allowed the measurement of nonverbal intelligence. This became known as a <b>performance</b> <b>scale.</b> Essentially, this scale required a subject to do something (such as [...] "copying symbols or point to a missing detail") rather than just answer questions. This was an important development as it attempted to overcome biases that were caused by [...] "language, culture, and education." [...] Further, this scale also provided an opportunity to observe {{a different type of}} behavior because something physical was required. Clinicians were able to observe how a participant reacted to the [...] "longer interval of sustained effort, concentration, and attention" [...] that the performance tasks required. While the Wechsler-Bellevue scale was the first to effectively use the <b>performance</b> <b>scale</b> (meaning that (1) there was a [...] "possibility of directly comparing an individual's verbal and nonverbal intelligence", and (2) that [...] "the results of both scales were expressed in comparable units"), the idea had been around for a while. The Binet scale did have performance tasks (although they were geared towards children) and there were entire tests that were considered supplements or alternatives (an example of such a performance test is the Leiter International <b>Performance</b> <b>Scale).</b>|$|E

Additionally, deaf children of deaf parents pass through language development stages earlier because the visual pathways are fully myelinated at an earlier age than the comparable auditory pathways.|$|E
40|$|Today’s large {{multi-core}} Internet servers support {{thousands of}} concurrent connections or flows. The computation ability of future server platforms {{will depend on}} increasing numbers of cores. The key to ensure that <b>performance</b> <b>scales</b> with cores {{is to ensure that}} systems software and hardware are designed to fully exploit the parallelism that is inherent in independent network flows. This paper identifies the major bottlenecks to scalability for a reference server workload on a commercial server platform. However, <b>performance</b> <b>scaling</b> on commercial web servers has proven elusive. We determined that on web server running a modified SPECweb 2005 Support workload, throughput scales only 4. 8 × on eight cores. Our results show that the operating system, TCP/IP stack, and application exploited flow-level parallelism well with few exceptions, and that load imbalance and shared cache affected performance little. Having eliminated these potential bottlenecks, we determined that <b>performance</b> <b>scaling</b> was limited by the capacity of the address bus, which became saturated on all eight cores. If this key obstacle is addressed, commercial web server and systems software are well-positioned to scale to a large number of cores...|$|R
50|$|Note {{that all}} of the above {{innovations}} for CPU power consumption preceded Barroso and Hölzle's paper on energy proportionality. However, most of them have contributed some combination of the two broad types of power management mentioned above, namely, idle power-down and active <b>performance</b> <b>scaling.</b> These innovations have made CPUs scale their power relatively well in relation to their utilization, making them the most energy-proportional of computer hardware components. Unlike CPUs, most other computer hardware components lack power management controls, especially those that enable active <b>performance</b> <b>scaling.</b> CPUs are touted as a good example of energy-proportional computer engineering that other components should strive to emulate.|$|R

5000|$|Frederick W.: An {{only child}} of two {{university}} graduates, Frederick was born May 23, 1936 in breech position and was referred to see Kanner in 1942 {{at the age of}} six. Described as being [...] "self-sufficient," [...] Frederick was capable of entertaining himself happily and was easily absorbed by objects, demonstrating [...] "good attention and perseverance" [...] in playing with toys. In turn, he paid little attention to other people, viewing them as [...] "unwelcome intruders," [...] ignoring them as much as possible in order to maintain his attention to his playthings. Furthermore, Frederick feared mechanical objects, such as vacuum cleaners and egg beaters, even running away at the sight of or hearing the things. Similar to Donald, Frederick liked a regimented lifestyle in which everything had to have been placed and arranged in the same fashion and pattern. Frederick had limited verbal interactions, ejaculating unintelligible sounds and responding to commands in [...] "echolalia fashion," [...] but he was able to sing twenty to thirty songs, including a French lullaby. Due to a lack of cooperation during the Grace Arthur <b>performance</b> <b>scale</b> diagnostic tests, Frederick's results were difficult to evaluate. He performed the best on the Seguin form board, which consisted of inputting variously shaped objects back into their respective form holes on a board, with a best time of 58 seconds. In the mare and foal test, it appeared that he put the pieces in the appropriate places based on their configuration because it did not matter to him whether the pieces were right side up or not. During the form board tests, he was very concentrated and determined, working on them in an interested manner, but between tests, he wandered about the room examining various objects, paying no attention the people in the room.|$|E

Cognitive outcome is another important factor {{in favor of the}} surgical decision. Aim. To investigate the correlation between seizure outcome and cognitive outcome after epilepsy surgery in a pediatric population. Patients and methods. A total of 59 pediatric patients were retrospectively assessed with the WISC-III (Full Scale, Verbal Scale and <b>Performance</b> <b>Scale)</b> before and, at least, 6 months after surgery. Patients were divided into two groups according whether or not improvement of seizure control after surgery. Data collected for each child included: epileptic syndrome, etiology, age at epilepsy onset, duration of epilepsy and seizure frequency. Results. Comparison using a MANOVA test revealed significant differences across pre-operative Full Scale, Verbal Scale and <b>Performance</b> <b>Scale</b> (p = 0. 01) with seizure reduction group performing better than no seizure reduction group. Seizure improvement group achieved significant <b>Performance</b> <b>Scale</b> improvement (p = 0. 01) and no seizure improvement group showed significant Verbal Scale worsened after surgery (p = 0. 01). Conclusions. Our results suggest that the success of the epilepsy surgery in childhood when the seizure control is achieved may also provide an improvement in the <b>Performance</b> <b>Scale</b> whereas the seizure maintenance may worsen the Verbal Scale...|$|E
