50|$|The Bell Act, {{particularly}} the <b>parity</b> <b>clause,</b> {{was seen by}} critics as an inexcusable surrender of national sovereignty. The pressure of the sugar barons, particularly those of President Roxas's home region of Western Visayas, and other landowner interests, however, was irresistible.|$|E
50|$|However, {{the program}} has {{received}} criticism for enforcing a launch date parity policy which means that developers can only release their titles on Xbox One if they haven't been released on other consoles first. Many developer have called for the policy to be dropped; Microsoft has since dropped the <b>parity</b> <b>clause.</b>|$|E
50|$|News {{regarding}} the game making {{an appearance on}} the Xbox One seems unhopeful due to Microsoft’s <b>parity</b> <b>clause,</b> which states that games must be released {{on the same day}} as rival consoles. Thus, this has created complications and the developers of the game are considering to not launch the game on the Xbox One, as of right now.|$|E
40|$|<b>Parity</b> <b>clauses,</b> {{also known}} as most-favoured-nation clauses, are {{designed}} to address the hold-up problem in vertical relations and facilitate investments and efficiencies by the downstream platform. However, when designed too broadly, they have the potential of undermining the dynamics of competition and reducing consumer welfare. This paper explores the welfare effects of <b>parity</b> <b>clauses</b> and reflects {{on the level of}} intervention they may call for. It reviews the possible theories of harm associated with <b>parity</b> <b>clauses</b> and draws a dividing line between the effects generated by narrow and wide parity...|$|R
50|$|In July 2015, the France {{became the}} first country in Europe to ban rate <b>parity</b> <b>clauses</b> in contracts, after the French National Assembly enacted the final vote of the ‘Law Macron’ and {{instructed}} the deletion of any rate <b>parity</b> <b>clauses</b> from contracts between hoteliers and Online Travel Agents. In Dec 2015, Germany's Bundeskartellamt court prohibited Booking.com from continuing to apply its BAR or 'best price' clauses and ordered the hotel booking portal to completely delete the clauses from its contracts and {{general terms and conditions}} as far as they affect hotels in Germany.|$|R
40|$|The Directorate General for Competition at the European Commission enforces {{competition}} {{law in the}} areas of antitrust, merger control, and state aids. This year’s article provides first a general presentation {{of the role of the}} Chief Competition Economist’s team and surveys the main achievements of the Directorate General for Competition over 2016 / 2017. The article then reviews the economic work undertaken in one merger case between Dow/DuPont, which raised specific issues related to innovation, as well as in an antitrust case on <b>parity</b> <b>clauses</b> related to Amazon e-books...|$|R
5000|$|Lanning {{has seen}} Microsoft take strides {{in a more}} {{positive}} direction since E3. He is aware that Microsoft have spoken to indie developers {{to get a better}} understanding of the sorts of policies that are healthy for developers and gamers, but is waiting to hear from those developers about the levels of friction involved in releasing a game in the Microsoft universe. Since those comments, Microsoft announced their ID@Xbox program, which allows independent developers to self-publish on the Xbox One. Lanning described the program as a [...] "bittersweet victory" [...] for the independent community, and Stewart Gilray has confirmed Just Add Water's application to register for the program and is just waiting on Microsoft's permission to allow them to develop for them because he does not want Oddworld fans on the Xbox One platform to miss out. However, he laments the way the program labels independent developers differently because they self-publish, compared to the major developers that team up with major publishers, whereas Nintendo and Sony identify all developers that want to release on their consoles as third party developer/publishers no matter how big or small. Before committing completely to making an Xbox One port of the game, Lanning wants to be sure that the game will still be allowed on the platform in the event that they miss submission, because [...] "we can’t absorb that loss" [...] financially, though he is confident conversations will work out. The ID@Xbox program does not extend to Xbox 360. On 10 June 2014, Lanning confirmed that New 'n' Tasty! will be released on the Xbox One before the end of 2014 after getting [...] "past" [...] the [...] "talks" [...] that were stalling it, and will not have to adhere to Microsoft's <b>parity</b> <b>clause</b> that demands the Xbox version be released at the same time as other platforms, crediting Microsoft for being nice and convenient about developing the Xbox version. The release was further delayed, but was made available to download from the Xbox One Games Store on March 27, 2015.|$|E
40|$|The City of Schenectady and City Fire Fighters Union, Local 28, which {{resulted}} in the first decision that parity clauses are not invalid per se, recognized that some <b>parity</b> <b>clause</b> arrangements can allow the employer and one or more unions to plan and execute long-range agreements; Two or more unions can agree among themselves that one union can implicate the others in a parity arrangement. This Note discusses the effect of on the negotiability of parity clauses in public sector employment contracts. The New York State 2 ̆ 2 Taylor Law 2 ̆ 2 governing public employees, and the New York courts 2 ̆ 7 analysis of parity clauses under the Taylor Law are also discussed. Finally, City of Schenectady will be analyzed for its effect on future <b>parity</b> <b>clause</b> enforcement in the courts, and the author suggests that the courts should follow City of Schenectady and uphold the validity of parity clauses where no union 2 ̆ 7 s right to freedom of bargaining is impinged...|$|E
40|$|One {{of the key}} {{concerns}} of competition authorities is the use by online platforms of some forms of Most Favoured Nation (MFN) clauses (also known as <b>parity</b> <b>clauses),</b> together with {{the adoption of the}} agency model. •	From recent investigations by several Member States on online travel agencies (OTAs) there emerges a general view in the EU that agreements including MFN clauses in their wide form violate competition law, whereas there is no unanimous approach to the narrow version of the same clauses. •	The application of Article 101 TFEU to these cases and the use of commitments decisions by many NCAs raise controversial questions...|$|R
40|$|We {{develop a}} {{flexible}} and tractable framework of (secret) vertical contracting between multiple upstream suppliers and downstream retailers. This framework does not put any restriction on the tari¤s {{that can be}} negotiated, and yet does {{take account of the}} impact of these tariffs on downstream firms'behavior. We show that equilibrium tariffs must be cost-based; as a result, retail prices are the same as with a multi-brand oligopoly. Interestingly, this finding is in line with the empirical analysis of a recent Norwegian merger. We then use this flexible framework to endogenize market structure as well as to analyze the e¤ects of various vertical restraints, such as resale price maintenance and retail price <b>parity</b> <b>clauses.</b> Finally, we show that our framework also applies to the agency relationships that characterize most online platforms...|$|R
