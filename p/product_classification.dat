The {{proliferation}} of ERP systems naturally {{leads to an}} intriguing question of <b>products</b> <b>classification.</b> In this paper, a framework for analyzing ERP systems is proposed. This framework includes various IT infrastructures that can be incorporated in the n-tier architecture. By using cluster analysis, different groups of ERP systems are classified to verify the correctness of the framework. The results may be useful for ERP vendors to improve their products strategy and help companies to evaluate most suitable ERP products to satisfy their requirements...|$|R
