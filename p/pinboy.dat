2500|$|In bowling, a pinsetter, or pinspotter, was {{originally}} {{a person who}} manually reset bowling pins to their correct position, cleared fallen pins, and returned bowling balls to players. [...] Probably {{due to the nature}} of the work (low-paid, often part-time, manual labor that most frequently took place evenings), many pinsetters were teenage boys, and thus <b>pinboy</b> is another name used to describe the job. In 1936, Harry Franklin invented the mechanical pinsetter while with the AMF firm, which largely did away with pinsetting as a manual profession, although a small number of bowling alleys still use human pinsetters. [...] While humans usually no longer set the pins, a pinchaser, or in slang 'pin monkey', often is stationed near the equipment to ensure that it is clean and working properly, and to clear minor jams.|$|E
5000|$|In August 1965, {{soon after}} {{recording}} the song, when questioned by Nora Ephron and Susan Edmiston about {{the identity of}} Mr. Jones, Dylan was deadpan: [...] "He's a real person. You know him, but not by that name... I saw him {{come into the room}} one night and he looked like a camel. He proceeded to put his eyes in his pocket. I asked this guy who he was and he said, 'That's Mr. Jones.' Then I asked this cat, 'Doesn't he do anything but put his eyes in his pocket?' And he told me, 'He puts his nose on the ground.' It's all there, it's a true story." [...] At a press conference in San Francisco in December 1965, Dylan supplied more information about Mr. Jones: [...] "He's a <b>pinboy.</b> He also wears suspenders." ...|$|E
50|$|In 1952 American Machine and Foundry (AMF) of Brooklyn, N.Y. began {{marketing}} automatic Pinsetter machines, {{eliminating the}} need for <b>pinboys</b> and causing bowling to rocket in popularity, making the 1950s the Decade of the Bowler.|$|R
50|$|<b>PinBoys</b> is a Danish pop punk/pop {{rock band}} that {{was formed in}} September 2002. The band {{consists}} of Jacob (vocalist/bass), Anne (vocalist), Simon (guitar) and Emil (drums). They released their first indie album Teenage Wasteland on March 15, 2007.|$|R
50|$|At {{the time}} of its closure, the {{facility}} was showing its age. The original pinsetters were still operational (although, at first the pins were set manually by <b>pinboys)</b> and scores were still being taken by paper and pencil. The wooden lanes has been sanded down to the nails. Still a popular attraction for youths and bowling leagues, the Wal-Lex didn't shut its doors due to lack of business, rather because the facility had simply become a victim of its own age.|$|R
