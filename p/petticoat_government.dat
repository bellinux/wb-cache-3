Author David Green noted, [...] "Hers was not, as used to be supposed, <b>petticoat</b> <b>government.</b> She had considerable power; yet time and time again she had to capitulate." [...] Gregg concluded that Anne was often able to impose her will, even though, as a woman in an age of male dominance and preoccupied by her health, her reign was marked by an increase in the influence of ministers and a decrease in the influence of the Crown. She attended more cabinet meetings than any of her predecessors or successors, and presided over an age of artistic, literary, economic and political advancement that was made possible by the stability and prosperity of her reign. In architecture, Sir John Vanbrugh constructed Blenheim Palace and Castle Howard. Queen Anne style architecture and Queen Anne style furniture were named after her. Writers such as Daniel Defoe, Alexander Pope and Jonathan Swift flourished. Henry Wise laid out new gardens at Blenheim, Kensington, Windsor and St James's. The union of England and Scotland, which Anne had fervently supported, created Europe's largest free trade area.

The old man seemed more under <b>petticoat</b> <b>government</b> than any other, for the threat of the char-woman produced greater effect upon him than the more formidable displeasure of Nigel. He withdrew grumbling and muttering, and Lord Glenvarloch heard him bar a large door at the nearer end of the gallery, which served as a division betwixt the other parts of the extensive mansion, and the apartment occupied by his guest, which, as the reader is aware, had its access from the landing-place {{at the head of the}} grand staircase.|$|E
60|$|From that check he {{had since}} then {{partially}} recovered.

In these days of <b>petticoat</b> <b>government</b> feminine protection was the chief leverage for advancement; Irène, however, could do nothing for her husband without outside help; conscious of her own powers of fascination, she had cast about for the most likely prop on which she could lean gracefully whilst helping Gaston to climb upward.|$|E

His object was to instigate a little rebellion {{on the part of the}} bishop. He thought that such a state of things would be advisable, not only in respect to Messrs.

Mr. Slope was by no means of opinion that Dr. Proudie was fit to rule, but he conscientiously thought it wrong that his brother clergy should be subjected to <b>petticoat</b> <b>government.</b> He therefore made up his mind to infuse a little of his spirit into the bishop, sufficient to induce him to oppose his wife, though not enough to make him altogether insubordinate.|$|E

Frau Ilsé (or Frow Ilsy, as it was pronounced) had accompanied him in his various migrations from Germany to England, and from England to the province; managing his establishment and himself too: ruling him, it is true, with a gentle hand, but carrying a high hand with all the world beside. How she had acquired such ascendency, I do not pretend to say. People, it is true, did talk--but have not people been prone to talk ever since the world began? Who can tell how women generally contrive to get the upper hand? A husband, it is true, may now and then be master in his own house; but who ever knew a bachelor that was not managed by his housekeeper? ...|$|E
6000|$|As I have fancied I {{could read}} the French {{character}} in the national palace of the Tuileries, so I have pictured to myself some of the traits of John Bull in his royal abode of Windsor Castle. The Tuileries, outwardly a peaceful palace, is in effect a swaggering military hold; while the old castle, on the contrary, {{in spite of its}} bullying look, is completely under <b>petticoat</b> <b>government.</b> Every corner and nook is built up into some snug, cozy nestling place, some [...] "procreant cradle," [...] not tenanted by meager expectants or whiskered warriors, but by sleek placemen; knowing realizers of present pay and present pudding; who seem placed there not to kill and destroy, but to breed and multiply. Nursery maids and children shine with rosy faces at the windows, and swarm about the courts and terraces. The very soldiers have a pacific look, and when off duty may be seen loitering about the place with the nursery-maids; not making love to them in the gay gallant style of the French soldiery, but with infinite bonhomie aiding them {{to take care of the}} broods of children.|$|E
60|$|The clanjamfrie, as Mrs. Halfpenny called it, mustered strong, and Gillian's heart leapt at the {{resumption}} of the tumultuous family life, as she beheld the collection of girls, boys, dogs, and donkeys awaiting her in the approach; and, {{in spite of the}} two governesses' presence, her mind misgave her as to the likelihood of regard to the hint that her mother had given that she hoped the elder ones would try to be sober in their ways, and not quite forget what week it was. It was in their favour that Jasper, now in his last term at school, was much more of a man and less of a boy than hitherto, and was likely to be on the side of discretion, so that he might keep in order that always difficult element, Wilfred, whose two years of preparatory school as yet made him only more ingenious in the arts of teasing, and more determined to show his superiority to <b>petticoat</b> <b>government.</b> He had driven Fergus nearly distracted by threatening to use all his mineralogical specimens to make ducks and drakes, and actually confusing them together, so that Fergus repented of having exhibited them, and rejoiced that Aunt Jane had let them continue in her lumber-room till they could find a permanent home.|$|E
60|$|As to Wilhelmus Kieft, having {{dispatched}} his proclamation to the frontiers, {{he put on}} his {{cocked hat}} and corduroy small clothes, and, mounting a tall, raw-boned charger, trotted out to his rural retreat of Dog's Misery. Here, like the good Numa, he reposed from the toils of state, taking lessons in government, not from the nymph Egeria, but from the honored wife of his bosom, who was one of that class of females, sent upon the earth a little after the flood, as a punishment for the sins of mankind, and commonly known by the appellation of knowing women. In fact, my duty as an historian obliges me to make known a circumstance which was a great secret at the time, and consequently was not a subject of scandal at more than half the tea tables in New Amsterdam, but which, like many other great secrets, has leaked out in the lapse of years; and this was, that Wilhelmus the Testy, though one of the most potent little men that ever breathed, yet submitted at home to a species of government, neither laid down in Aristotle or Plato; in short, it partook of the nature of a pure, unmixed tyranny, and is familiarly denominated <b>petticoat</b> <b>government.</b> An absolute sway, which, although exceedingly common in these modern days, was very rare among the ancients, if we may judge from the rout made about the domestic economy of honest Socrates, which is the only ancient case on record.|$|E

5000|$|The phrase [...] "petticoat government" [...] has {{referred}} to women running government or domestic affairs. The phrase is usually applied in a positive tone welcoming female governance of society and home, but occasionally is used to imply a threat to appropriate government by males, as was mentioned in several of Henry Fielding's plays. An Irish pamphlet <b>Petticoat</b> <b>Government,</b> Exemplified in a Late Case in Ireland was published in 1780. The American writer Washington Irving used the phrase in his Rip Van Winkle (1819) Frances Trollope wrote Petticoat Government: A Novel in 1850.

50|$|She {{received}} more attention during her lifetime for what are considered several strong novels of social protest: Jonathan Jefferson Whitlaw (1836) {{was the first}} anti-slavery novel, influencing the American Harriet Beecher Stowe's Uncle Tom's Cabin (1852). Michael Armstrong: Factory Boy began publication in 1840 {{and was the first}} industrial novel to be published in Britain. Other socially conscious novels included The Vicar of Wrexhill (1837 / Richard Bentley, London, 3 volumes), which took on corruption in the Church of England and evangelical circles. Possibly her greatest work is the Widow Barnaby trilogy (1839-1855); although Michael Sadleir considered the skilful set-up of <b>Petticoat</b> <b>Government</b> 1850, with its cathedral city, clerical psychology and domineering female, as something of a formative influence on her son's Barchester Towers and especially Mrs Proudie.|$|E
5000|$|The Duchess of Marlborough [...] "unduly disparaged" [...] Anne in her memoirs, and her prejudiced {{recollections}} persuaded many biographers that Anne was [...] "a weak, irresolute woman {{beset by}} bedchamber quarrels and deciding high {{policy on the}} basis of personalities". The Duchess wrote of Anne: She certainly meant well and was not a fool, but nobody can maintain that she was wise, nor entertaining in conversation. She was ignorant in everything but what the parsons had taught her when a child ... Being very ignorant, very fearful, with very little judgement, it is easy to be seen she might mean well, being surrounded with so many artful people, who at last compassed their designs to her dishonour. Modern historians view Anne more favourably. In his biography of 1980, Edward Gregg presents the Queen as a woman of invincible stubbornness, who was the central figure of her age. Gregg's argument depicts her reign as: [...] a period of significant progress for the country: Britain became a major military power on land, the union of England and Scotland created a united kingdom of Great Britain, and the economic and political base for the golden age of the 18th century was established. However the Queen herself has received little credit for these achievements and has long been depicted as a weak and ineffectual monarch, dominated by her advisers. In the opinion of historians, traditional assessments of Anne as fat, constantly pregnant, under the influence of favourites, and lacking political astuteness or interest may derive from male chauvinist prejudices against women. Author David Green noted, [...] "Hers was not, as used to be supposed, <b>petticoat</b> <b>government.</b> She had considerable power; yet time and time again she had to capitulate." [...] Gregg concluded that Anne was often able to impose her will, even though, as a woman in an age of male dominance and preoccupied by her health, her reign was marked by an increase in the influence of ministers and a decrease in the influence of the Crown.

40|$|Though Frances Milton Trollope was notorious {{among her}} contemporaries {{as a writer}} of crudeness and vulgarity today we {{remember}} little more about her than her mothering Anthony Trollope and writing a travel book which treated the Americans with little tenderness. In this thesis I examine Mrs. Trollope's work {{in order to determine}} the place which belongs to her in early Victorian letters. Her travel books, with the exception of The Domestic Manners of the Americans, show her ready to profit by the vogue for such journalism, but they give no grounds for the shabbiest literary reputation, for they are pretentious and gossiping but no more. The majority of her novels she wrote in an artificial, theatrical fashion which made it possible for her to produce thirty-four novels but made it difficult for her to write in the realistic vein which proved her most congenial. Despite the limits of her theatrical convention, in The Widow Bamaby, <b>Petticoat</b> <b>Government,</b> and a few other of her novels Mrs. Trollope wrote books as good as some of the best minor fiction of her time, books with something of her own buoyancy and an attention to the revelation of character in petty domestic situations. Far less adept than her social comedies, her polemical no show a social concern which, with her attempts at serial publication, make her very much a writer of her time. Her reception was often hostile, largely because Mrs Trollope described meanness and vulgarity better than anything else, but also because she maintained provocative attitudes on political and religious issues. Her contemporary reputation and the greater fame of her son have unduly diminished Mrs. Trollope 's stature: it is time we restore her to a position among the better minor writers of the early Victorian period...|$|E
