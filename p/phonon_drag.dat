5000|$|<b>Phonon</b> <b>drag</b> is an {{increase}} in the effective mass of conduction electrons or valence holes due to interactions with the crystal lattice in which the electron moves. As an electron moves past atoms in the lattice its charge distorts or polarizes the nearby lattice. This effect leads to a decrease in the electron (or hole, as may be the case) mobility, which results in a decreased conductivity. However, as the magnitude of the Seebeck coefficient increases with <b>phonon</b> <b>drag,</b> it may be beneficial in a thermoelectric material for direct energy conversion applications. The magnitude of this effect is typically appreciable only at low temperatures (<200 K).Phonons are not always in local thermal equilibrium; they move against the thermal gradient. They lose momentum by interacting with electrons (or other carriers) and imperfections in the crystal. If the phonon-electron interaction is predominant, the phonons will tend to push the electrons to one end of the material, losing momentum in the process. This contributes to the already present thermoelectric field. This contribution is most important in the temperature region where phonon-electron scattering is predominant. This happens for ...|$|E

Since the optical-phonons in III-V materials have a considerably larger coupling to electrons than acoustic phonons (which are the dominant drag mechanism at low T and large separations) {{it might be}} expected that the optical phonons will give a large effect high temperatures. The two key differences between optical and acoustic <b>phonon</b> mediated <b>drag</b> are: (1) the optical phonon mediated interlayer interaction is short-ranged due to their negligible group velocity at the Brillouin zone center; and (2) the typical momentum transfer for an optical phonon mediated scattering is relatively large.

30|$|In {{the case}} of {{perpendicular}} alignment, {{a significant decrease in}} the induced voltage was observed as well when herringbone grooves were included. At a flow rate of 1, 000  μL/min, the voltage decreased by fourfold, from 0.057  mV (type 2) to 0.013  mV (type 4). At a flow rate of 10, 000  μL/min, the induced voltage dropped from 0.15  mV (type 2) to 0.03  mV (type 4). At a glance, this result may be surprising because one may think that the increased transverse flow along the y-direction would induce a stronger <b>phonon</b> <b>dragging</b> effect. However, simulation data revealed that the flow velocity in the y-direction along the electron path between the electrodes was appreciably small compared to that in the x-direction. As a result, any added electron dragging effect due to the increase in transverse flow was buried in the effect of the overall flow momentum decrease due to the decrease in x-directional flow velocity in Figure  3 b. Moreover, the increased vorticity seems to interfere with the out-of-plane phonon mode, minimizing the momentum transfer from the fluid flow in Figure  3 c. In summary, the significant decrease in the induced voltage in the presence of herringbone grooves is because of the overall flow momentum decrease due to the decrease in x-directional flow and increased vorticity.|$|R

During the last decade much attention was given to a mechanism of current/voltage induction between two isolated systems (in the sense that momentum trans-fer via particles exchange is prohibited) made possible through Coulomb interaction between carriers at each of them. Such mechanism has been called Coulomb Drag (CD). The predictions made by Progrebinskii [1] and Price[2], have been conrmed later by Solomon et al [3] and, more recently, {{by a series of}} experiments involving quasi-two-dimensional systems in semicon-ductor double quantum wells [4, 5]. Placing two 2 D-dimensional electron systems close to each other, and separated by a potential barrier, when an electromotive force is applied in one of them, an induced voltage is observed in the other in an open circuit condition, or an induced current will appear, in the case of closed circuit.

For Joule heat in the metallic (10, 10) tube, the theoretical results for the breakdown bias voltage is quite comparable with the experimental value. It is found that the Joule heat can be greatly enhanced by increasing the chemical potential, while the role of the temperature is not so important for Joule heat. In zigzag (10, 0) tube, the Joule heat is smaller than the armchair tube, resulting from nonzero band gap in the electron band structure. For the electronic conductance G_e and electron thermal conductance σ_el, the EPI has important effect at higher temperature or higher chemical potential. Compared with ballistic transport, there is an opposite tendency for G_e to decrease with increasing temperature after EPI is considered.

40|$|Abstract. The basic dynamic {{behavior}} of martensitic interfaces has been analyzed {{within the framework}} of lattice dislocation dynamics. Two limiting cases of the martensitic interface structure have been considered: (a) the case when the interface can be appropriately described in terms of an array of non-interacting (well-spaced) interfacial dislocations and; (b) the case when the interfacial dislocations are so closely spaced that the interface can be approximated by a continuous distribution of dislocations. In the first case, it was demonstrated that, after the inclusion of a “chemical ” driving force in the equation of motion, the dynamics of lattice dislocations can be directly applied to analyze the interfacial dynamics. In the second case, on the other hand, while the lattice dislocation dynamics is still quite relevant, several parameters in the equation of motion have to be redefined to reflect the fact that the interface now acts as a planar defect. For both of the cases of interfacial dislocation structure, we have analyzed the two basic modes of interfacial motion: (a) the continuous mode in which the motion is controlled by various energy-dissipative processes (e. g., <b>phonon</b> and electron <b>drag)</b> and; (b) the discontinuous or jerky mode in which the motion is controlled by the thermal activation of the interface/obstacle interactions...|$|R
40|$|Metal cutting {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{frequently}} used forming processes in the manufacturing industry. Extensive effort is made to improve its process and simulation has become an integrated part, not only in the product development process but also in the customer relations. However, simulation of metal cutting is complex both from numerical as well as physical point of view. Furthermore, modelling the material behaviour has shown to be crucial. Errors in the material model cannot be reduced by the numerical procedures. The magnitudes of strain and strain rate involved in metal cutting may reach values of 1 - 10 and 103 - 106 s- 1. The dissipative plastic work together with the chip tool friction also leads to locally high temperatures. These extreme ranges of conditions imply that a diversity of physical phenomena is involved and it is a challenge to develop a material model with adequate accuracy over the whole loading range. Furthermore, this intense and severe deformation represents thermo-mechanical behaviour far from what is generated from conventional material compression and tension testing. A highly desirable feature is also a material model that can be extrapolated outside the calibration range. This is not trivial since materials exhibit different strain hardening and softening characteristics at differentstrains, strain rates and temperatures. Models based on modelling some aspects of the underlying physical process, e. g. the generation of dislocations, are expected to have a larger range of validity than engineering models. Though, engineering models are the far most common models used in metal cutting simulations. The scope of this work includes development of validated models for metal cutting simulations of AISI 316 L stainless steel. Particular emphasis is placed on the material modeling and high strain rate plasticity phenomena. The focus has been on a physically based material model. The approach has been to review the literature about flow stress models and phenomena and particularly at high strain rates. A previous variant of a dislocation density model has thereafter been extended into high strain rate regimes by applying different mechanisms. Some of the models have been implemented in commercial finite element software for orthogonal cutting simulations. Experimental measurements and evaluations that include SHPB-measurements, cutting force measurements, quick-stop measurements and some microstructural examinations has been conducted for calibration and validation. The compression tests, within a temperature and strain rate range of 20 - 950 °C and 0. 01 - 9000 s- 1 respectively, showed that the flow stress increased much more rapidly within the dynamic loading range and hence depends on the strain rate. The dynamic strain aging (DSA) that has been observed at lower strain rates is non-existent at higher strain rates. The temperature and strain-rate evolution is such that the DSA is not necessary to include when modelling this process. Furthermore the magnetic balance measurements indicate that the martensite transformation-strengthening effect is insignificant within the dynamic loading range. In the present work the concept of motion of dislocations, their resistance to motion and substructure evolution are used as underlying motivation for description of the flow stress. A coupled set of evolution equations for dislocation density and mono vacancy concentration is used rendering a formulation of a rate-dependent yield limit in context of rate-independent plasticity. Dislocation <b>drag</b> due to <b>phonon</b> and electron <b>drag,</b> a strain rate dependent model of the subcell formation, a strain rate and temperature dependent recovery function and a structural dependent thermally activated stress component have among others been considered. Best predictability was obtained with a strain rate dependent subcell formulation. Dislocation drag did not improve the predictability within the measured testing range. Although showed to has a greater influence outside the range of calibration when extrapolated. It has been shown that extrapolation is uncertain. Results from experiments and modelling of material behaviour and metal cutting together with the literature indicate that the predictability of the material behaviour within and outside the measured testing range can be further tuned by implementing models of the phenomenon mechanical twining and recrystallization.

Here we report, {{for the first time}} to our knowledge, success in first-principles computation of the <b>phonon</b> <b>drag</b> effect-a coupling phenomenon between electrons and nonequilibrium phonons-in heavily doped region and its optimization to enhance the Seebeck coefficient while reducing the phonon thermal conductivity by nanostructuring. Our simulation quantitatively identifies the major phonons contributing to the <b>phonon</b> <b>drag,</b> which are spectrally distinct from those carrying heat, and further reveals that although the <b>phonon</b> <b>drag</b> is reduced in heavily doped samples, a significant contribution to Seebeck coefficient still exists. An ideal phonon filter is proposed to enhance zT of silicon at room temperature by a factor of 20 to ∼ 0. 25, and the enhancement can reach 70 times at 100 K. This work opens up a new venue toward better thermoelectrics by harnessing nonequilibrium phonons. United States.
