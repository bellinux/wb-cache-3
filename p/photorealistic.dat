5|$|To create 2,000 Hun {{soldiers}} {{during the}} Huns' attack sequence, the production team developed crowd simulation software called Attila. This software allows thousands of unique characters to move autonomously. A {{variant of the}} program called Dynasty {{was used in the}} final battle sequence to create a crowd of 3,000 in the Forbidden City. Pixar's <b>photorealistic</b> open API RenderMan was used to render the crowd. Another software developed for this movie was Faux Plane, which was used to add depth to flat two-dimensional painting. Although developed late in production progress, Faux Plane was used in five shots, including the dramatic sequence which features the Great Wall of China, and the final battle sequence when Mulan runs to the Forbidden City. During the scene in which the Chinese are bowing to Mulan, the crowd is a panoramic film of real people bowing. It was edited into the animated foreground of the scene.|$|E
5|$|Karas {{impressed}} its reviewers {{with its}} animated imagery. Mania Entertainment affirmed its lush imagery {{are enough to}} hook viewers, and certain 2D-3D scenes matched <b>photorealistic</b> standards. They felt Karas could rival or beat live-action films in the visual department. DVD Talk commented they saw evidence {{a lot of effort}} went into merging the 2D and 3D animations. They, however, felt setting the scenes in darkness and obscuring points of interest with smoke or other effects marred the high quality imagery. Anime News Network stated the richly detailed images; fast moving action scenes; and visual effects of collapsing buildings, explosions, and blood made Karas one of the best action animation. Reviewers praised the fight scenes between the CG generated karas and mikuras, declaring them realistic, tasteful and stunning. DVD Talk, however, complained the camera jerked and moved all over the place never showing fights cleanly. Mania stated the fights in the later half failed to match those in the first half in terms of beauty, intensity, and variety; the overlaying of characters' face onto their armored forms in the finale detracted from their viewing experience.|$|E
25|$|In {{the early}} {{half of the}} 2010s, CGI is nearly {{ubiquitous}} in video, pre-rendered graphics are nearly scientifically <b>photorealistic,</b> and real-time graphics on a suitably high-end system may simulate photorealism to the untrained eye.|$|E
25|$|Vermeer's {{painting}} {{techniques have}} long {{been a source of}} debate, given their almost <b>photorealistic</b> attention to detail, despite Vermeer's having had no formal training, and despite only limited evidence that Vermeer had created any preparatory sketches or traces for his paintings.|$|E
25|$|Although it does handle {{interreflection}} {{and optical}} effects such as refraction accurately, traditional ray tracing {{is also not}} necessarily <b>photorealistic.</b> True photorealism occurs when the rendering equation is closely approximated or fully implemented. Implementing the rendering equation gives true photorealism, as the equation describes every physical effect of light flow. However, this is usually infeasible given the computing resources required.|$|E
25|$|Working in California in the 1960s, Vija Celmins' early work, {{generally}} in <b>photorealistic</b> painting and pop-inspired sculpture, was representational. She recreated commonplace {{objects such as}} TVs, lamps, pencils, erasers, and the painted monochrome reproductions of photographs. A common underlying theme in the paintings was violence or conflict, such as war planes, handguns and riot imagery. A retrospective of the 1964–1966 work was organized by the Menil Collection {{in cooperation with the}} Los Angeles County Museum of Art in 2010. She has cited Malcolm Morley and Jasper Johns as influences in this period.|$|E
25|$|The filmmakers shot {{many of the}} {{internal}} scenes at Pinewood Studios; the opening sequence in the cavernous 007 Stage at Pinewood Shepperton, where {{the interior of the}} Louvre was recreated. In this sequence, Hanks' character is taken by French police to the Louvre, where a dead body has been discovered. David White of Altered States FX, a prosthetics and special makeup effects company, was tasked with creating a naked <b>photorealistic</b> silicone body for the scene. Lighting effects were utilized to obscure the body's genitalia, a technique also used on television programs such as NCIS.|$|E
25|$|The field {{began to}} see the first {{rendered}} graphics that could truly pass as <b>photorealistic</b> to the untrained eye (though they could not yet do so with a trained CGI artist) and 3D graphics became far more popular in gaming, multimedia, and animation. At the end of the 1980s {{and the beginning of the}} nineties were created, in France, the very first computer graphics TV series: La Vie des bêtes by studio Mac Guff Ligne (1988), Les Fables Géométriques (1989-1991) by studio Fantôme, and Quarxs, the first HDTV computer graphics series by Maurice Benayoun and François Schuiten (studio Z-A production, 1990–1993).|$|E
25|$|In {{the late}} 1960s through the 1970s, she {{abandoned}} painting, {{and focused on}} working in graphite pencil, creating highly detailed <b>photorealistic</b> drawings, based on photographs of natural elements such as the ocean's or moon's surface, the insides of shells, and closeups of rocks. Critics frequently compare her laborious approach to contemporaries Chuck Close and Gerhard Richter, and she has cited Giorgio Morandi, {{a master of the}} pale grey still life, as a major influence. These works also share with Richter's an apparent randomness and thus apparently dispassionate attitude. It is as if any photograph would do as a source for a painting, and the choice is apparently unimportant. This is of course not the case, but the work contains within it the impression that the image is chosen at random from an endless selection of possible alternative images of similar nature.|$|E
25|$|Google Earth shows 3D {{building}} {{models in}} some cities, including <b>photorealistic</b> 3D imagery. The first 3D buildings in Google Earth were created using 3D modeling {{applications such as}} SketchUp and, beginning in 2009, Building Maker, and were uploaded to Google Earth via the 3D Warehouse. In June 2012, Google {{announced that it would}} be replacing user-generated 3D buildings with an auto-generated 3D mesh. This would be phased in, starting with select larger cities, with the notable exception of cities such as London and Toronto which required more time to process detailed imagery of their vast number of buildings. The reason given is to have greater uniformity in 3D buildings, and to compete with Nokia Here and Apple Maps, which were already using this technology. The coverage began that year in 21 cities in four countries. By early 2016, 3D imagery had been expanded to hundreds of cities in over 40 countries, including every U.S. state and encompassing every continent except Antarctica.|$|E

500|$|Final Fantasy: The Spirits Within is a 2001 American computer-animated {{science fiction}} film {{directed}} by Hironobu Sakaguchi, {{creator of the}} Final Fantasy series of role-playing video games. It was the first <b>photorealistic</b> computer-animated feature film and remains the most expensive video game-inspired film of all time. It features the voices of Ming-Na Wen, Alec Baldwin, Donald Sutherland, James Woods, Ving Rhames, Peri Gilpin and Steve Buscemi.|$|E
500|$|The art in Ōkami {{is highly}} {{inspired}} by Japanese watercolor and wood carving {{art of the}} Ukiyo-e style, such {{as the work of}} Hokusai. Ōkami was originally planned to be rendered in a more <b>photorealistic</b> 3D style. However, Clover Studio determined that the more colorful sumi-e style allowed them to better convey Amaterasu's association with nature and the task of restoring it. The change was also influenced by limitations in the PS2 hardware to render the <b>photorealistic</b> 3D graphics. As a result of the switch to the watercolor style, the idea of the Celestial Brush came about. Atsushi Inaba, CEO of Clover, noted that [...] "Once we fixed ourselves on a graphical style and got down to the brushwork, we thought 'Wouldn't it be great if we could somehow get the player involved and participate in this artwork instead of just watching it?' That's how the idea of the Celestial Brush was born". Original concepts for enemies included the use of dinosaurs, but the designs settled onto more demon-like characters.|$|E
500|$|A {{number of}} {{innovative}} visual effects techniques were used during production.

500|$|Square Pictures {{rendered}} the film {{using some of}} the most advanced processing capabilities available for film animation at the time. A render farm consisting of 960 workstations was tasked with rendering each of the film's 141,964 frames. It took a staff of 200 about four years to complete The Spirits Within. Square intended to make the character of Aki Ross into the world's first <b>photorealistic</b> computer-animated actress, with plans for appearances in multiple films in different roles.|$|E
500|$|Nine {{companies}} {{handled the}} visual effects for Edge of Tomorrow under VFX supervisor Nick Davis. Davis {{worked with the}} crew of The Third Floor on the film's previsualization process. Sony Pictures Imageworks (SPI) worked {{on the first two}} acts of the film and created over , including <b>photorealistic</b> environments, battle scenes, and computer-generated creatures and characters. One major shot involved covering London Heathrow Airport with military troops, vehicles, and aircraft; SPI split some of the work with RodeoFX. Cinesite joined late in the production and developed [...] for ten key sequences, with 189 appearing in the final cut.|$|E
500|$|In {{designing}} the characters, the artists aimed for {{a style that}} was <b>photorealistic.</b> The creators envisaged the main protagonist, Nathan Drake, as more of an everyman character than Lara Croft, shown as clearly under stress in the game's many fire fights, with no special training and constantly living {{at the edge of}} his abilities. Director Amy Hennig felt a heavily armored, [...] "tough as nails" [...] protagonist with a large weapon was not a suitable hero, and decided a [...] "tenacious and resourceful" [...] character would portray more human qualities. Supporting characters (Elena Fisher and Victor Sullivan) were included to avoid a dry and emotionless story. Fisher's character underwent changes during development; in early trailers for the game, the character had dark brown hair, but ultimately the color changed to blonde and the style was altered.|$|E
500|$|Square Enix has {{expanded}} the Final Fantasy series into various media. Multiple anime and computer-generated imagery (CGI) films {{have been produced}} that are based either on individual Final Fantasy games or on the series as a whole. The first was an original video animation (OVA) titled , a sequel to Final FantasyV. The story was set in the same world as the game, although 200 years in the future. It was released as four 30-minute episodes, first in Japan in 1994 {{and later in the}} United States by Urban Vision in 1998. In 2001, Square Pictures released its first feature film, [...] The film is set on a future Earth invaded by alien life forms. The Spirits Within was the first animated feature to seriously attempt to portray <b>photorealistic</b> CGI humans, but was considered a box office bomb and garnered mixed reviews.|$|E
500|$|The [...] "heightened realism" [...] of Raymond's <b>photorealistic</b> {{style has}} been [...] "chastised for making his {{pictures}} too realistic, too gorgeous {{for its own}} sake", although many commentators believe that this very method [...] "plunges the reader into the story". Raymond's work has a [...] "timeless appeal," [...] many aspects of which—including the use of feathering (a shading technique in which a soft series of parallel lines helps to suggest the contour of an object)—have inspired generations of cartoonists, his work becoming [...] "the raw material for the swipe files of future generations". His work on Rip Kirby is especially noted for its use of [...] "sophisticated black spotting", a technique Raymond used from c.1949 [...] "for pacing" [...] reasons. Fellow-cartoonist Stan Drake recalled that Raymond called his black areas [...] "pools of quiet", serving as they did [...] "as a pause for the viewer, something to slow the eye across the strip's panels".|$|E
500|$|Critics {{praised the}} game's {{graphics}} and sound. Schneider (IGN) found the game unpretentious {{in comparison to}} video game trends of <b>photorealistic</b> rendering and cartoonish art. He likened the slick vehicle animations and metallic elements to Micro Machines and Rare's R.C. Pro-Am, but felt that Blast Corps explosions were not as robust as those in [...] Schneider praised the game's texture maps, which made the night scenes and houses look realistic, and the canyons breathtaking. He also liked the detail in the vehicles' skid marks and gradual building disintegration. He wrote that the game's 3D programming was errorless, and was particularly pleased about the game's lack of fog, usually used to cover developer limitations. EGM echoed Schneider's praise of the deep landscapes, which the magazine called [...] "incredible". Scott McCall (AllGame) praised the game's realistic polygonal models and technical prowess, and Steve Polak (The Weekend Australian) wrote that Blast Corps showcased the console's graphics capabilities. Schneider (IGN) described the soundtrack as between [...] "70s pop, disaster movie score, and Country Bear Jamboree". He praised the range of engine, tire screeching, and crashing sound effects. Reviewers disliked the country music tracks with jaw harp, though IGN {{thought it was a}} matter of taste.|$|E

[...] Bevil interviewed several park guests; comments included [...] "I thought it [...] was really cool" [...] and [...] "it's beautiful", and some described it as better than the attractions it replaced. Barbara Nefer of Examiner.com said that guests would love Puck, the ride's central character. She preferred the wild version of the ride, describing it as [...] "actually still very family friendly" [...] and saying that the exhibit was a [...] "huge highlight" [...] of the attraction. Robert Niles of Theme Park Insider agreed that {{the highlight of the}} attraction was the penguin exhibit. Niles described the dispatch procedure as crucial to the ride: [...] "if SeaWorld can dispatch a quartet of ride vehicles every minute or so, as designed, fans will find this a fun ride". In a later article Niles highlighted some guests' criticisms of the ride, describing it as [...] "lacking an engaging story and not delivering enough on-ride views of the attraction's stars -- SeaWorld's penguins". However, he argues that SeaWorld's promotions were too <b>photorealistic</b> creating [...] "expectations for an experience that the ride did not deliver, perhaps setting up many of those visitors for disappointment".|$|E
500|$|From early on, it {{had been}} decided that The Spirits Within would be filmed entirely in English. The {{original}} script, written by Sakaguchi, was titled Gaia. The screenplay was written by Al Reinert and Jeff Vintar. The film was co-directed by Motonori Sakakibara, with Jun Aida and Chris Lee both serving as producers. Lee compared The Spirits Within, the first full-length <b>photorealistic</b> animated film, to Walt Disney's Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs, the first full-length cel animated film. In {{order to keep the}} film in line with Hironobu Sakaguchi's vision as director, several script rewrites took place, most in the initial stages of production. Sakaguchi stated he was pleased with the film's final cut, saying he would not have changed anything if given the chance. The film had high cost overruns towards the end of filming. New funds had to be sourced to cover the increasing production costs while maintaining staff salaries. The film's final cost of $137 million, which included about $30 million spent on marketing by the film's distributor Columbia Pictures, escalated from an original budget rumored to be around $70 million. $45 million alone was spent on the construction of Square's studio in Hawaii. It was Columbia Pictures' first animated feature film since [...] in 1986.|$|E
500|$|Pip, a {{chipmunk}} who {{can talk}} in the 2D world of Andalasia, loses his ability to communicate through speech {{in the real world}} so he must rely heavily on facial and body gestures. This meant the animators had to display Pip's emotions through performance as well as making him appear like a real chipmunk. The team at Tippett began the process of animating Pip by observing live chipmunks which were filmed in motion from [...] "every conceivable angle", after which they created a <b>photorealistic</b> chipmunk through the use of 3D computer graphics software, Maya and Furrocious. When visual effects supervisor Thomas Schelesny showed the first animation of Pip to director Kevin Lima, he was surprised that he was a looking at a CG character and not reference footage. To enhance facial expressions, the modelers gave Pip eyebrows, which real chipmunks do not have. During the filming of scenes in which Pip appears, a number of ways were used to indicate the physical presence of Pip. On some occasions, a small stuffed chipmunk with a wire armature on the inside was placed in the scene. In other situations, a rod with a small marker on the end or a laser pointer would be used to show the actors and cinematographer where Pip is.|$|E
500|$|Minority Report was {{the first}} film to have an entirely digital {{production}} design. Termed [...] "previz", as an abbreviation of previsualization (a term borrowed from the film's narrative), production designer Alex McDowell said the system allowed them to use Photoshop in place of painters, and employ 3-D animation programs (Maya and XSI) to create a simulated set, which could be filled with digital actors then used to block out shots in advance. The technology also allowed the tie-in video game and special effects companies to cull data from the previs system before the film was finished, which they used to establish parameters for their visuals. When Spielberg quickly became a fan, McDowell said [...] "t became pretty clear that [...] wouldn't read an illustration as a finished piece, but if you did it in Photoshop and created a <b>photorealistic</b> environment he focused differently on it." [...] Filming took place from March 22 to July 18, 2001, in Washington, D.C., Virginia, and Los Angeles. Film locations included the Ronald Reagan Building (as PreCrime headquarters) and Georgetown. The skyline of Rosslyn, Virginia is visible when Anderton flies across the Potomac River. During production, Spielberg made regular appearances on a video-only webcam based in the craft services truck, both alone and with Tom Cruise; together they conferenced publicly with Ron Howard and Russell Crowe via a similar webcam {{on the set of}} [...] "A Beautiful Mind" [...] in New York.|$|E

The space has up to [...] ceilings, and the underside of each level of apartments is covered in aluminium painted in a distinctive colour scheme of psychedelic hues which, {{as a tribute to}} Danish 1960s and '70s furniture designer Verner Panton, are all exact matches of the colours he used in his designs. The colours move, symbolically, from green for the earth over yellow, orange, dark orange, hot pink, purple to bright blue for the sky. The northern and western facades of the parking garage depict a [...] <b>photorealistic</b> mural of Himalayan peaks. The parking garage is protected from wind and rain by huge shiny aluminium plates, perforated to let in light and allow for natural ventilation. By controlling the size of the holes, the sheeting was transformed into the giant rasterized image of Mount Everest. Completed in October 2008, it received the World Architecture Festival Housing Award (2008), Forum AID Award (2009) and the MIPIM Residential Development Award at Cannes (2009). Dwell magazine has stated that the Mountain Dwellings [...] "stand as a beacon for architectural possibility and stylish multifamily living in a dense, design-savvy city." ...|$|E
500|$|To {{create a}} {{commercial}} for Mya, Motorola hired the McCann Erickson company, who in turn hired Digital Domain to create the character. The design {{was described as a}} [...] "big-budget" [...] production, though Digital Domain were only given three months to complete the project. Mya's physical representation: a tall, thin, blonde, blue-eyed white female, was created in the likeness of a human model, Michelle Holgate. The initial inspiration for Mya came from vintage pin-up girls. The first representation of Mya had a very small waist and large breasts, and was said to resemble Jessica Rabbit, which did not impress either Motorola or McCann Erickson. Motorola asked Digital Domain to make Mya look as human as possible yet still be obviously artificial. The first completed iteration of Mya was so realistic that Motorola asked for her to be made more obviously digital. Viewers were reportedly not impressed with Mya because they thought she was a real person. Digital Domain visual effects supervisor and animation director, Fred Raimondi, decided to remodel Mya's appearance to be [...] "just to the left of real". [...] Mya's hair was changed from brunette to bleach blonde. Her short spiky hair style was said to resemble that of Serena Altschul. According to Digital Domain, giving Mya hair that was longer than ear-length was not possible in the time they had been given, due to the difficulties of creating digital <b>photorealistic</b> hair. Mya's final body shape was an almost exact copy of the original model's measurements. Mya was typically seen wearing a silver pantsuit but also appeared in halter tops in some shots and dressed in an evening gown for her debut. While Digital Domain staff wanted Mya to appear in a knee-length skirt with high boots, Motorola and McCann chose the pantsuit, due to its contemporary look.|$|E

2500|$|During the 20th and 21st centuries, {{the notion}} of the still life has been {{extended}} beyond the traditional two dimensional art forms of painting into video art and three dimensional art forms such as sculpture, performance and installation. Some mixed media still-life works employ found objects, photography, video, and sound, and even spill out from ceiling to floor and fill an entire room in a gallery. Through video, still-life artists have incorporated the viewer into their work. Following from the computer age with computer art and digital art, {{the notion of}} the still life has also included digital technology. Computer-generated graphics have potentially increased the techniques available to still-life artists. 3D computer graphics and 2D computer graphics with 3D <b>photorealistic</b> effects are used to generate [...] still life images.

The , released in 2001, was the first fully computer-generated feature film to use <b>photorealistic</b> CGI characters and be fully made with motion capture. The film was not a box-office success, however. Some commentators have suggested this may be partly because the lead CGI characters had facial features which fell into the [...] "uncanny valley".
