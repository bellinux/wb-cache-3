40|$|Thesis (MSc (Chemistry and Polymer Science)) [...] University of Stellenbosch, 2005. In {{this study}} several {{potential}} polymerisation catalysts were synthesised. This {{was accomplished by}} coordinating α-diimine ligands such as N,N'-diferrocenyldiazabutadiene (DFDAB), N,N'-dimesityldiazabutadiene (DMDAB) {{as well as the}} bidentate amine N,N,N',N'-tetramethylethylenediamine (TMEDA), to several transition metals. The multi-step synthesis of N,N'-diferrocenyldiazabutadiene (DFDAB) from ferrocene involved the use of lithiated ferrocene, iodoferrocene, N-ferrocenylphthalimide and aminoferrocene; the latter three were characterised. This ligand was coordinated to the transition metal ions iron(II) and zinc(II) to form Fe(DFDAB) Cl 2 and Zn(DFDAB) Cl 2 respectively. 1 H and 13 C NMR, FT-IR and mass spectrometry revealed that the expected product had been synthesised in a useful form. 2, 4, 6 -Trimethylaniline reacted with glyoxal to form N,N'-dimesityldiazabutadiene (DMDAB). The DMDAB ligand was coordinated to the transition metal ions zinc(II) and silver(I) to form Zn(DMDAB) Cl 2 and Ag(DMDAB) 2 respectively. Characterisation now also include molecular and crystallographic structural determinations by means of X-ray diffractometry. Another N-donor complex, Cr(CO) 4 (TMEDA), was also prepared by coordinating N,N,N',N'-tetramethyl ethylenediamine (TMEDA) to Cr(CO) 5 (THF). This was done to give an indication of the activity of low oxidation state complexes in the catalysis <b>of</b> olefin <b>polymerisation.</b> The metal-α-diimine complexes mentioned above were employed in the <b>polymerisation</b> <b>of</b> the monomers <b>ethylene</b> and 1 -pentene probably according to a cationic mechanism. High density, high molar mass polyethylene products with narrow polydispersities were obtained. The chromium(TMEDA) complex produced polyethylene exhibiting ultra-high molar mass (> 10 000 kg/mol). The <b>polymerisation</b> <b>of</b> 1 -pentene, using the Fe(DFDAB) Cl 2 complex, afforded oligo-pentene with a molar mass of ~ 800 g/mol. After an unsuccessful attempt to prepare the (CO) 5 Cr=C(OZrCp 2 Cl) (ferrocenyl) modified Fischer-type carbene complex, the (CO) 5 Cr=C(OMe) (ferrocene) complex was eventually insolated. Elucidation of its molecular structure was accomplished by X-ray diffractometry. Finally, the DFDAB-ligand was coordinated to Fe 2 (CO) 9 to generate Fe(CO) 3 (DFDAB) in another attempt to investigate the role of carbonyl groups and also low oxidation state metals in polymerisation reactions [compare to Cr(CO) 4 (TMEDA) unit above].

In the corresponding reaction of complex [Ni(η 5 -C 5 H 5) (Mes-BIAN) ][PF 6] (1), an unusual paramagnetic complex incorporating a cationic trinuclear α-diimine Ni cluster (5), containing five bridging Cl ligands and a [AlCl 4]- anion, was also isolated and fully characterised, in which the cyclopentadienyl ligand was absent.

Chapter 2 {{describes the}} preparation of several potentially tetradentate proligands via the Mannich reaction. The ligands presented have various combinations of donors, chain length and substituents on the phenyl backbone. The synthesis and characterisation of several novel main group complexes (K, Ca and Al) using these ligands is presented. The calcium bis-chelate complexes are shown to be highly active in the ring opening polymerisation of lactide. Chapter 3 introduces a new family of zinc species stabilised by these ligands. The coordination chemistry of zinc alkyls and alkoxides is shown to be dependent on ligand structure, most notably on the choice of heteroatom donor and phenolate backbone substituent. The zinc alkoxides are efficientinitiators in the polymerisation of rac-lactide, with the catalytic activity influenced by the choice of coordinated ligand. The highest activity is observed with ligands containing two neutral oxygen donors in combination with bulky phenolate substituents.
