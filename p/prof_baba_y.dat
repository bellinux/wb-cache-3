40|$|The {{hepatitis}} B {{virus genome}} carries the surface antigen (SAg) gene {{and an open}} reading frame that encodes two SAg-related polypeptides: SAg with a 55 -amino-acid N-terminal extension polypeptide and SAg with a 174 -amino-acid N-terminal extension polypeptide. These are termed middle S and large S, respectively. These polypeptides or their glycosylated derivatives have been detected in Dane particles, but their chemical and biological properties have remained largely unknown because of their limited availability. We attempted to produce these proteins in Saccharomyces cerevisiae by placing the coding regions {{under the control of}} the promoter of the yeast glyceraldehyde- 3 -phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) gene. Yeast cells carrying middle S and large S coding sequences produced 33, 000 - and 42, 000 -dalton products, respectively, each of which reacted with anti-S antibody and bound to polymerized human serum albumin, in accordance with the known properties of pre-S proteins from particles in human sera (K.

40|$|AbstractA {{consequence}} of the acrosome reaction is to expose the inner acrosomal membrane (IAM), which is a requirement for the sperm's ability to secondarily bind to and then penetrate the zona pellucida (ZP) of the mammalian oocyte. However, the proteins on the IAM responsible for binding and presumably penetrating the zona have not been identified. This issue can be resolved if direct information is made available on {{the composition of the}} IAM. For this purpose, we devised a methodology in order to obtain a sperm head fraction consisting solely of the IAM bound to the detergent-resistant perinuclear theca. On the exposed IAM surface of this fraction, we defined an electron dense protein layer that we termed the IAM extracellular coat (IAMC), which was visible on sonicated and acrosome-reacted sperm of several mammalian species. High salt extraction removed the IAMC coincident with the removal of a prominent 38 kDa polypeptide, which we termed IAM 38. Antibodies raised against this polypeptide confirmed its presence in the IAMC of intact, sonicated and acrosome-reacted sperm. By immunoscreening of a bovine testicular cDNA library and sequencing the resulting clones, we identified IAM 38 as the equivalent of porcine Sp 38 [Mori, E., Kashiwabara, S., <b>Baba,</b> T., Inagaki, <b>Y.,</b> Mori, T., 1995.

The blockage of IVF {{at the level of the}} zona with anti-IAM 38 antibodies and the retention of IAM 38 after sperm passage through the zona support its involvement in secondary sperm–zona binding.

If R is a right QF- 3 and right generalized uniserial ring, then R is a right co-H ring (hence left H-ring). 2. If R is a right QF- 3 and right generalized uniserial ring, so is the factor ring R/Socle(R_R). But there is a gap in the proof of second lemma. And K. Oshiro himself admits it.

40|$|SSCI-VIDE+ECI 2 D:ING+ZBU:DBI:SLOInternational {{audience}} 1. Introduction Bio-alcohols dehydration is {{of prominent}} relevance because {{it represents a}} sustainable alternative route for olefins production. However, water present in bio-alcohols and generated by their dehydration often gives rise to structural, textural and acidity modifications of heterogeneous catalysts [1]. A full understanding of each effect is required to synthesize efficient catalysts {{in the presence of}} water. Nevertheless, contradictions {{can be found in the}} literature because most of studies on water effects are achieved ex situ. In this work, a method based on in situ techniques has been developed to understand the water effects on heterogeneous catalysts used for conversion of isobutanol into linear butenes. In particular, the improvement of catalytic activity when water was added to the feed was explained by in situ acidity measurements achieved in flowing water vapor at the reaction temperatures. 2. Experimental Catalysts preparation: TiO 2 /SiO 2 oxide catalysts (named Ti/SiO 2) were prepared by a grafting method using Ti(OiPr) 2 (OC 5 H 10) as precursor and H 4 SiW 12 O 40 /SiO 2 (named HSiW/SiO 2) were synthetized by wetness impregnation with H 4 SiW 12 O 40 aqueous solutions, followed by drying and thermal treatment in flowing air at 698 K and 573 K respectively. Both oxides were supported on a pure silica provided by Evonik (Grace, BET surface area 557 m²/g, BJH pores volume 0. 82 cm 3 /g). Characterizations: The catalysts structures were determined by XRD, Raman spectroscopy and TEM, their textures by BET, BJH measurements and their acidity properties by FTIR-pyridine, acetonitrile and CO adsorption. Furthermore, in situ-FTIR acidity measurements were achieved on self-supporting disks in a specially design short path length (~ 2. 2 mm) IR cell reactor [2]. In brief, it allowed relevant data in the temperature range 293 - 800 K under controlled gas mixture flow rate (without and with water up to 3 %) to be obtained. Heats of adsorption for NH 3 and H 2 O adsorbed species were determined using the AEIR method [3]. Catalytic measurements: Catalytic tests were conducted in a fixed-bed reactor at atmospheric pressure between 450 and 573 K. Conversions and products yields were determined with both on-line and off-line gas chromatographs equipped with FID detectors. Reaction parameters such as the contact time, the time on stream and feed water addition were investigated. 3. Results and discussionFor each catalytic system, the metal loading was maximized whilst amorphous and well dispersed supported oxides were maintained. After checking the absence of acidity on the support by FTIR spectra of adsorbed probes, it was shown that Ti/SiO 2 catalysts possess mostly moderate Lewis acid sites whereas strong Brønsted acid sites mainly compose HSiW/SiO 2 catalysts (Table 1). Table 1. BET surfaces areas of oxides catalysts and acidity densities determined by FTIR spectra of adsorbed pyridine. CatalystS BET[m²/g]Brønsted density[µmol/m²]Lewis density[µmol/m²]Lewis/Brønsted 21. 4 %TiO 2 /SiO 23817. 6 x 10 - 31. 5 x 10 - 120. 620. 9 %H 4 SiW 12 O 40 /SiO 23759. 1 x 10 - 24. 1 x 10 - 2 0. 4 The catalytic activity and selectivity to linear butenes were better on HSiW/SiO 2 than on Ti/SiO 2 confirming that Brønsted acid are more active in isobutanol dehydration and that high strength is required for isomerization. Moreover, C 5 + secondary products were formed on HSiW/SiO 2 which was not the case on Ti/SiO 2. Both catalysts deactivated with time on stream but Ti/SiO 2 deactivated more slowly. This was shown to arise from coke formation but not from structural or textural modifications. For Ti/SiO 2 catalysts, addition of water to the feed significantly increased the conversion especially at high contact time (Fig. 1 a) whereas the selectivity was unchanged. The comparison of apparent activation energies revealed that the strength of the acid sites and the mechanisms involved in the reaction are unchanged by water addition. Similar positive effects of water on conversion were obtained for HSiW/SiO 2 catalyst but to a lesser extent. In parallel, in situ FTIR acidity measurements were achieved by NH 3 adsorption in presence of water from room temperature to 720 K. For Ti/SiO 2 catalyst, spectra have revealed that the number of Brønsted acid sites increased by a factor of 4 when 3 % H 2 O was added to the NH 3 /He gas mixture in the temperature range (473 - 573 K) while the Lewis sites remained unchanged (Fig. 1 b). It clearly showed that the increase in catalytic activity does not arise from conversion of Lewis acid sites into Brønsted acid sites as frequently mentioned in the literature. Furthermore, heats of adsorption were determined according to the AEIR method. On Ti/SiO 2 catalyst (Fig. 1 c), it has been shown that the heats of adsorption of (a) the NH 3 adsorbed species on the Lewis acid sites (IR band at 1606 cm- 1) and (b) the NH 4 + species protonated by Brønsted sites (IR band at 1442 cm- 1) follow the Temkin adsorption model with a linear decrease from (E(0)) to (E(1)) at low and high coverages. Results have showed the presence of two Lewis species and two Brønsted species with different strength. Focusing on adsorbed species in the reaction temperature range (shaded area on the Fig. 1 c), the values comparison clearly demonstrated that NH 3 interaction with Lewis and Brønsted sites was not hindered by water, water having much weaker heat of adsorption. Finally, as bridged OH groups were shown to be formed under water at the reaction temperatures and to correspond to Brønsted sites, it was concluded that the activity improvement arises from such bridged OH sites. For HSiW/SiO 2 catalysts, the number of Brønsted sites also increased under water vapor. In this case, the improvement of Brønsted sites density could be induced by a redistribution of the H 4 SiW 12 O 40 units on the surface under water.

ConclusionsTiO 2 and H 4 SiW 12 O 40 oxides highly dispersed over SiO 2 have been synthesized and tested in conversion of isobutanol into linear butenes. Brønsted acid sites are active for the dehydration step whereas strong sites are required for isomerization. For both oxides, the catalytic activity was enhanced by the addition of water into the feed and this feature was not due to change in the structural and textural properties of the solid. In situ FTIR measurements under flowing NH 3 and H 2 O at the reaction temperatures have showed that it arises from a large increase in the density of Brønsted acid sites whereas their strength was unmodified. Moreover, the addition of H 2 O does not change the amount of Lewis sites. The heats of adsorption of the NH 3 and H 2 O adsorbed species revealed that H 2 O does not compete with NH 3.
