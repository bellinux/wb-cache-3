40|$|The 7 S/ 11 S {{glycinin}} equilibrium {{as found}} in Lakemond et al. (J. Agric. Food Chem. 2000, 48, xxxx-xxxx) at ambient temperatures influences heat denaturation. It is found that the 7 S form of glycinin denatures at a lower temperature than the 11 S form, as demonstrated {{by a combination of}} calorimetric (DSC) and circular dichroism (CD) experiments. At pH 7. 6, at which glycinin is mainly present in the 11 S form, the disulfide bridge linking the acidic and the basic polypeptides is broken during heat denaturation. At pH 3. 8, at which glycinin has dissociated partly into the 7 S form, and at pH 5. 2 this disruption does not take place, as demonstrated by solubility and gel electrophoretic experiments. A larger exposure of the acidic polypeptides (Lakemond et al., 2000) possibly correlates <b>with</b> a higher <b>endothermic</b> <b>transition</b> temperature and <b>with</b> the appearance of an exothermic transition as observed with DSC. Denaturation/aggregation (studied by DSC) and changes in secondary structure (studied by far-UV CD) take place simultaneously.

In this study, we have analyzed the temperature-dependent dynamic properties of native surfactant membranes and membranes reconstituted from two surfactant hydrophobic fractions (i. e., all the lipids plus the hydrophobic proteins SP-B and SP-C, or only the total lipid fraction). These preparations show micrometer-sized fluid ordered/disordered phase coexistence, associated <b>with</b> a broad <b>endothermic</b> <b>transition</b> ending close to 37 °C. However, both types of membrane exhibit uniform lipid mobility when analyzed by electron paramagnetic resonance with different spin-labeled phospholipids. A similar feature is observed with pulse-field gradient NMR experiments on oriented membranes reconstituted from {{the two types of}} surfactant hydrophobic extract. These latter results suggest that lipid dynamics are similar in the coexisting fluid phases observed by fluorescence microscopy. Additionally, it is found that surfactant proteins significantly reduce the average intramolecular lipid mobility and translational diffusion of phospholipids in the membranes, and that removal of cholesterol has a profound impact on both the lateral structure and dynamics of surfactant lipid membranes. We believe that the particular lipid {{composition of}} surfactant imposes a highly dynamic framework on the membrane structure, as well as maintains a lateral organization that is poised at the edge of critical transitions occurring under physiological conditions...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} the present work is the elucidation of two <b>endothermic</b> <b>transitions</b> at 74 and 90 degreesC, respectively, {{observed}} during differential scanning calorimetry of glassy itraconazole. Modulated temperature DSC (MTDSC), hot-stage microscopy (HSM), HPLC and high temperature X-ray diffraction (HT-X ray) were used to examine the thermal properties of glassy itraconazole. It was found that the preparation mode of the glass does not seem to influence the appearance of both <b>endothermic</b> <b>transitions</b> since they were present during heating of glassy itraconazole which was prepared by cooling the melt or by rapid solvent evaporation of an itraconazole solution. These observations suggest that the appearance of the two <b>endothermic</b> <b>transitions</b> require the liquid state prior to glass formation. The transitions are not due to impurities in the starting material, nor are they caused by thermal decomposition. This was further confirmed by HPLC-analysis. HSM showed structure formation following cooling of the melt, at approximately 87 degreesC; cooling the product further showed a second change in optical contrast. HT-X ray confirmed and identified the formation of a nematic mesophase. The appearance of the two endothermic signals during scanning of glassy itraconazole points to the formation of a mesophase. Due to the nature of itraconazole, it appears as a chiral nematic phase of which the mobility is frozen into a glass upon cooling below 59 degreesC thereby impeding further crystallization. status: publishe...|$|R

The 114 degrees C transition was identified with coat proteins, and the 56 degrees C transition was identified with heat inactivation. Thermograms of the germinated spores and vegetative cells were much alike, including an <b>endothermic</b> <b>transition</b> attributable to DNA. The ascending part of the main endothermic 100 degrees C transition in the dormant-spore thermograms corresponded to a first-order reaction and was correlated with spore death; i. e., greater than 99. 9 % of the spores were killed when the transition peak was reached. The maximum death rate of the dormant spores during calorimetry, calculated from separately measured D and z values, occurred at temperatures above the 73 degrees C onset of thermal denaturation and was equivalent to the maximum inactivation rate calculated for the critical target. Most of the spore killing occurred before the release {{of most of the}} dipicolinic acid and other intraprotoplast materials. The exothermic 119 degrees C transition was a consequence of the endothermic 100 degrees C transition and probably represented the aggregation of intraprotoplast spore components.

40|$|In {{recent years}} Proton Exchange Membrane Fuel Cells (PEMFCs) have drawn {{considerable}} interest {{from both the}} scientific community and the industry due to: a) a high energy conversion efficiency; b) a low environmental impact; and c) the possibility of applications ranging from portable electronics to the automotive sector. The heart of a PEMFC is its proton exchange membrane (PEM). The most widely used PEMs consist of perfluorinated polymer electrolytes such as Nafion. These systems have drawbacks such as their low proton conductivity at temperatures higher than 90 °C and at low relative humidity which severely limits their large-scale commerciol use. In order to overcome these limitations, PEMs composed of perfluorinated ionomers doped with proton-conducting ionic liquids (PCILs) were recently proposed due to their high conductivity under anhydrous conditions, large electrochemical stability window and good thermal stability. Here, we report the investigation of triethylammonium-methanesulfonate (MST) and triethylammonium-perfluorobutanesulfonate (PFBuT) PCILs by techniques such as Thermogravimetric Analysis (TGA), Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC) and Broadband Electric Spectroscopy (BES).

Specifically, {{we consider the}} assembly of cagelike (MO) 12 clusters exhibiting particularly high gas phase stability, leading to new <b>polymorphs</b> <b>with</b> energetic stabilities rivaling (and sometimes higher) than those of known MO polymorphs...|$|R
50|$|The {{serpentine}} {{group of}} minerals are polymorphous, {{meaning that they}} have the same chemical formulae, but the atoms are arranged into different structures, or crystal lattices. Chrysotile, which has a fiberous habit, is one polymorph of serpentine {{and is one of the}} more important asbestos minerals. Other polymorphs in the serpentine group may have a platy habit. Antigorite and lizardite are the <b>polymorphs</b> <b>with</b> platy habit.|$|R
40|$|Eugenol and {{isoeugenol}} {{were investigated}} {{by means of}} thermal analysis. It was observed that eugenol and isoeugenol have one characteristic endothermic effect at 260 ~ and 290 ~ respectively, and two exothermic effects in the temperature intervals 270 ~ 176 The DTA curves of the benzoyl esters of eugenol and isoeugenol begin <b>with</b> <b>endothermic</b> effects at 70 ~ and 95 ~ respectively, which coincide with the melting points of these compounds...|$|R
50|$|The poly(dialkylstannane)s {{were found}} to be thermotropic and {{displayed}} first-order phase transitions from one liquid-crystalline phase into another or directly to the isotropic state, depending on the length of the side groups. More specifically, poly(dibutylstannane) for example showed an <b>endothermic</b> phase <b>transition</b> at ~0 °C from a rectangular to a pure nematic phase, as determined by X-ray diffraction.|$|R
40|$|In {{the present}} study the {{structural}} properties of potato protease inhibitor 1 (PI- 1) were studied {{as a function of}} temperature to elucidate its precipitation mechanism upon heating. A cDNA coding for PI- 1 from cv. Bintje was cloned and expressed in Pichia pastoris. Using the recombinant PI- 1 it was suggested that PI- 1 behaves as a hexameric protein rather than as a pentamer, as previously proposed in the literature. The recombinant protein seems either to have a predominantly unordered structure or to belong to the -II proteins. Differential scanning calorimetry analysis of PI- 1 revealed that its thermal unfolding occurs via one <b>endothermic</b> <b>transition</b> in which the hexameric PI- 1 probably unfolds, having a dimer instead of a monomer as cooperative unit. The transition temperature for the recombinant PI- 1 was 88 C. Similar results were obtained for a partially purified pool of native PI- 1 from cv. Bintj...|$|R
40|$|International audienceTransgenically-produced amylose-only (AO) starch {{was used}} to {{manufacture}} bioplastic prototypes. Extruded starch samples were tested for crystal residues, elasticity, glass transition temperature, mechanical properties, molecular mass and microstructure. The AO starch granule crystallinity was both of the Band Vh-type, while the isogenic control starch was mainly A-type. The first of three <b>endothermic</b> <b>transitions</b> was attributed to gelatinization at about 60 • C. The second and third peaks were identified as melting of the starch and amylose-lipid complexes, respectively. After extrusion, the AO samples displayed Vh-and B-type crystalline structures, the B-type polymorph being the dominant one. The AO prototypes demonstrated a 6 -fold higher mechanical stress at break and 2. 5 -fold higher strain at break compared to control starch. Dynamic mechanical analysis showed {{a significant increase in}} the storage modulus (E) for AO samples compared to the control. The data support the use of pure starch-based bioplastics devoid of non-polysaccharide fillers...|$|R
40|$|The {{synthesis}} of alternating poly(amide urethane) s 5 a–d {{was performed in}} three steps using ε-caprolactone, diamines, and diphenyl carbonate as starting materials. The microstructure {{and nature of the}} end groups of the poly(amide urethane) s were determined by means of 1 H NMR spectroscopy, which reveals an alternating sequence of amide and urethane linkages in a linear chain with hydroxy and phenyl urethane end groups. The molecular weight and polydispersity of the polymers obtained (5700 <¯Mn< 7900, 1. 25 <¯Mw/¯Mn< 1. 38) were determined by means of gel permeation chromatography. The thermal properties determined by means of DSC show that the poly(amide urethane) s 5 a–d are semicrystalline materials having one or two <b>endothermic</b> <b>transitions</b> similar to the poly(amide urethane) s 10 a–d prepared from ε-caprolactam, amino alcohols, and diphenyl carbonate. Thermogravimetric analysis of poly(amide urethane) s 5 a–b shows a single step decomposition, while poly(amide urethane) s 10 a–c decompose in two steps indicating that different degradation mechanisms are operating. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{multiple}} thermal transitions of acid-hydrolyzed and heat-moisture treated {{corn starch}} samples in excess water were measured using {{differential scanning calorimetry}} (DSC) and interpreted using a polymer swelling and dissolution theory. The dual treatment of acid hydrolysis (AH) and heat-moisture treatment (HMT) with different extent of reaction generates starches with various degrees of residual crystalline structure. Multiple <b>endothermic</b> <b>transitions</b> (G and M 1) were firstly observed in DSC traces even in excess water. In this study, the G and M 1 endotherms were proposed to be related with the energy consumption associated with granule swelling and crystallites dissolution respectively. In contrast, only a single M 1 endotherm transition from a broad to a sharp and narrow endotherm upon HMT was consistently observed for starch samples acid hydrolyzed for 48 and 72 h, which testified the dominance of rearrangement over the destruction upon HMT. This novel theory describing the multiple phase transition was also evidenced by the variation of swelling power and relative crystallinity...|$|R
