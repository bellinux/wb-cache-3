The females can selectively fertilise future eggs with the sperm stored to produce diploid workers or lay unfertilized haploid eggs to produce drones. The first workers to hatch are known as nanitics, and are weaker and smaller than later workers, but they begin to serve the colony immediately. They enlarge the nest, forage for food, {{and care for the}} other eggs. Species that have multiple queens may have a queen leaving the nest along with some workers to found a colony at a new site, a process akin to swarming in honeybees.|$|E

The Vietnamese areas were established around Milam Street, Webster Street, Fannin Street, and San Jacinto Street.

2500|$|Imperial's chief geologist, Ted Link, {{was among}} those who {{believed}} oil could be found at a much greater depth and had already met with success drilling at Norman Wells in the Northwest Territories. He had his staff determine the best location for the new well. [...] The majority of the team favoured a triangular area that stretched between Calgary and Edmonton in central Alberta, up to Grande Prairie in the northwest. [...] The company then set out to acquire surface lease rights to tracts of land in the region. [...] Imperial acquired rights to over 200,000 acres of land southwest of Edmonton by the end of spring and began surveying the area for the best <b>place</b> <b>to</b> <b>begin</b> drilling. [...] Seismic tests produced two possible candidates: one near the village of Leduc and another farther to the southwest near Pigeon Lake. [...] Though the Pigeon Lake spot was viewed by geologists as a more promising location, the team chose Leduc due to the location's proximity to major roadways and the North Saskatchewan River. [...] This decision proved fortuitous, as a later effort by Imperial to drill at Pigeon Lake resulted in another dry hole.|$|E

He went on slowly through them, with his eyes fixed on the ground, towards some trees which marked the limits of the churchyard; looking out for a <b>place</b> <b>to</b> <b>begin</b> his search in, where the graves might be {{comparatively}} few, and where his head might not get confused at the outset. Such a place he found at last, in a damp corner under the trees. About this spot the thin grass languished; the mud distilled into tiny water-pools; and the brambles, briars, and dead leaves lay thickly and foully between a few ragged turf-mounds. Could they have laid her here? Could this be the last refuge to which Mary ran after she fled from home? ...|$|E
60|$|In Robert Louis Stevenson (1850-1894) we {{have the}} spirit of romance personified. His novels, such as Kidnapped and David Balfour, are stories of {{adventure}} written in a very attractive style; but he is more widely known, among young people at least, by his charming Child's Garden of Verses and his Treasure Island (1883). This last {{is a kind of}} dime-novel of pirates and buried treasure. If one is to read stories of that kind, there is no better <b>place</b> <b>to</b> <b>begin</b> than with this masterpiece of Stevenson. Other works by the same versatile author are the novels, Master of Ballantrae, Weir of Hermiston and Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde; various collections of essays, such as Virginibus Puerisque and Familiar Studies of Men and Books; and some rather thin sketches of journeying called An Inland Voyage and Travels with a Donkey.|$|E
60|$|Nimble as a cat, Tashtego mounts aloft; {{and without}} {{altering}} his erect posture, runs straight out upon the overhanging mainyard-arm, {{to the part}} where it exactly projects over the hoisted Tun. He has carried with him a light tackle called a whip, consisting of only two parts, travelling through a single-sheaved block. Securing this block, so that it hangs down from the yard-arm, he swings {{one end of the}} rope, till it is caught and firmly held by a hand on the deck. Then, hand-over-hand, down the other part, the Indian drops through the air, till dexterously he lands on the summit of the head. There--still high elevated above the rest of the company, to whom he vivaciously cries-- he seems some Turkish Muezzin calling the good people to prayers from the top of a tower. A short-handled sharp spade being sent up to him, he diligently searches for the proper <b>place</b> <b>to</b> <b>begin</b> breaking into the Tun. In this business he proceeds very heedfully, like a treasure-hunter in some old house, sounding the walls to find where the gold is masoned in. By the time this cautious search is over, a stout ironbound bucket, precisely like a well-bucket, has been attached to one end of the whip; while the other end, being stretched across the deck, is there held by two or three alert hands. These last now hoist the bucket within grasp of the Indian, to whom another person has reached up a very long pole. Inserting this pole into the bucket, Tashtego downward guides the bucket into the Tun, till it entirely disappears; then giving the word to the seamen at the whip, up comes the bucket again, all bubbling like a dairy-maid's pail of new milk. Carefully lowered from its height, the full-freighted vessel is caught by an appointed hand, and quickly emptied into a large tub. Then remounting aloft, it again goes through the same round until the deep cistern will yield no more. Towards the end, Tashtego has to ram his long pole harder and harder, and deeper and deeper into the Tun, until some twenty feet of the pole have gone down.|$|E
