5|$|In Japan, {{health care}} is {{provided}} by national and local governments. Payment for personal medical services is offered through a universal health insurance system that provides relative equality of access, with fees set by a government committee. People without insurance through employers can participate in a national health insurance program administered by local governments. Since 1973, all elderly <b>persons</b> <b>have</b> been covered by government-sponsored insurance. Patients are free to select the physicians or facilities of their choice.|$|E
5|$|Genital herpes {{can be more}} {{difficult}} to diagnose than oral herpes, since most HSV-2-infected <b>persons</b> <b>have</b> no classical symptoms. Further confusing diagnosis, several other conditions resemble genital herpes, including fungal infection, lichen planus, atopic dermatitis, and urethritis. Laboratory testing is often used to confirm a diagnosis of genital herpes. Laboratory tests include culture of the virus, direct fluorescent antibody (DFA) studies to detect virus, skin biopsy, and polymerase chain reaction to test for presence of viral DNA. Although these procedures produce highly sensitive and specific diagnoses, their high costs and time constraints discourage their regular use in clinical practice.|$|E
5|$|There {{have been}} 108 {{individuals}} who have won it, and three teams. The trophy has been won by women on two occasions; in 1999, the 1998 U.S. Olympic Women's Ice Hockey Team was presented the trophy along with Harry Sinden, and in 2007, Cammi Granato individually won the trophy. Granato was {{also a member of}} the 1998 U.S. Olympic Women's Ice Hockey Team that won the trophy in 1998. No person individually has won the award twice; however, <b>persons</b> <b>have</b> won with a team and by themselves separately, as is the case with Cammi Granato, because she was adjudged worthy to be personally awarded the trophy.|$|E

25|$|The US Headache Consortium has {{guidelines}} for neuroimaging of non-acute headaches. Most old, chronic headaches {{do not require}} neuroimaging. If a <b>person</b> <b>has</b> the characteristic symptoms of a migraine, neuroimaging is not needed as it is very unlikely the <b>person</b> <b>has</b> an intracranial abnormality. If the <b>person</b> <b>has</b> neurological findings, such as weakness, on exam, neuroimaging may be considered.|$|R
50|$|If the SIRS {{criteria}} are negative {{it is very}} unlikely the <b>person</b> <b>has</b> sepsis; if they are positive, there is just a moderate probability that the <b>person</b> <b>has</b> sepsis.|$|R
30|$|Second, {{we include}} two {{entrepreneur}} individual trait variables in our regression. The two variables are whether {{at least one}} controlling <b>person</b> <b>has</b> experience of studying overseas (OVERSEAS_STUDY) and whether at least one controlling <b>person</b> <b>has</b> experience of working overseas (OVERSEAS_WORK), respectively. If a <b>person</b> <b>has</b> experience of studying or working overseas, he/she {{is more likely to}} apply for and obtain foreign residency rights.|$|R

50|$|Each <b>person</b> <b>has</b> {{two copies}} of all {{chromosomes}}, except the sex chromosomes in males. For each SNP, the combination of alleles a <b>person</b> <b>has</b> is called a genotype. Genotyping refers to uncovering what genotype a <b>person</b> <b>has</b> at a particular site. The HapMap project chose a sample of 269 individuals and selected several million well-defined SNPs, genotyped the individuals for these SNPs, and published the results.|$|R
25|$|Chronic diseases. Some older <b>persons</b> <b>have</b> {{at least}} one chronic {{condition}} and many have multiple conditions. In 2007–2009, the most frequently occurring conditions among older persons in the United States were uncontrolled hypertension (34%), diagnosed arthritis (50%), and heart disease (32%).|$|E
25|$|According to the Human Rights Watch (HRW), {{hundreds}} of civilians were killed, more than 10,000 houses burned and approximately 212,000 <b>persons</b> <b>have</b> fled {{their homes to}} live in desperate conditions deep in the bush in northern Central African Republic.|$|E
25|$|Current {{dialectology}} upholds Pskov and Polotsk as the {{two cities}} where the Tale was most likely written. Numerous <b>persons</b> <b>have</b> been proposed as its authors, including Prince Igor and his brothers. Other authors consider the epic to have emerged in Southern Rus', with many elements corresponding to modern Ukrainian language.|$|E
50|$|If {{a police}} officer has a {{reasonable}} suspicion that a <b>person</b> <b>has</b> alcohol {{in his or her}} body, and that he or she has been operating or has had care or control of a vehicle within the past three hours, the police officer can demand that person provide a suitable sample into an approved screening device. These devices are usually calibrated to display fail if a <b>person</b> <b>has</b> a BAC above 0.1 percent, warn or caution if a <b>person</b> <b>has</b> a BAC between 0.05 and 0.1 percent, and a numerical value if the <b>person</b> <b>has</b> a BAC below 0.05 percent.|$|R

Likewise, 401 <b>persons</b> <b>have</b> not declared their ethnicity.|$|E
25|$|The best-known {{cases of}} {{assassination}} attempts involve famous historical figures. Deaths of famous <b>persons</b> <b>have</b> sometimes {{been attributed to}} assassination by ninja, but the secretive natures of these scenarios {{have been difficult to}} prove. Assassins were often identified as ninja later on, but {{there is no evidence to}} prove whether some were specially trained for the task or simply a hired thug.|$|E
25|$|In December 2016, Jatupat “Pai” Boonpattararaksa, a {{rights group}} member {{was accused of}} lèse majesté for sharing BBC Thai {{biography}} of Thailand's new king Vajiralongkorn. He {{was the only person}} to be arrested even though more than 2,600 people also shared the story. As of January 2017, at least 68 <b>persons</b> <b>have</b> been charged with lèse majesté since the latest coup.|$|E
50|$|If the offence {{has been}} {{actually}} committed--it is lawful for {{any person who}} believes on reasonable ground that another <b>person</b> <b>has</b> committed the offence to arrest that person without warrant, whether that other <b>person</b> <b>has</b> committed the offence or not.|$|R
5000|$|If a <b>person</b> <b>has</b> an {{equitable}} interest in property, {{this implies that}} some other <b>person</b> <b>has</b> the legal interest in that property. If one <b>person</b> <b>has</b> both the legal and equitable interest in the relevant property, {{he or she has}} no ‘equitable interest’ in that property as such. “If one <b>person</b> <b>has</b> both the legal estate and the entire beneficial interest in the land he holds an entire and unqualified legal interest and not two separate interests, one legal and the other equitable”. As stated by Brennan J in DKLR Holding Co (No 2) Pty Ltd v Commissioner of Stamp Duties (NSW), [...] "{{an equitable}} interest is not carved out of a legal estate but impressed upon it".|$|R

25|$|Non-government {{bodies and}} <b>persons</b> <b>have</b> also {{undertaken}} their own investigations. For example, in 2005, a South Korean freelance journalist, Jung Soo-woong, located in Japan some descendants {{of people involved}} in the 1895 assassination of Empress Myeongseong (Queen Min). The assassination was conducted by the Genyōsha, perhaps {{under the auspices of the}} Japanese government, because of the Empress's involvement in attempts to reduce Japanese influence in Korea. Jung recorded the apologies of the persons.|$|E
25|$|Among other things, Stackpole {{argued that}} Hitler {{could not have}} legally {{transferred}} his right to a copyright in the United States to Eher Verlag in 1925, {{because he was not}} a citizen of any country. Houghton Mifflin v. Stackpole was a minor landmark in American copyright law, definitively establishing that stateless <b>persons</b> <b>have</b> the same copyright status in the United States that any other foreigner would. In the three months that Stackpole's version was available it sold 12,000 copies.|$|E
25|$|Beginning in 2014, {{employers}} of {{more than}} 100 persons were required to have 3 percent of their workforce be persons with disabilities, though enforcement of this quota was limited. Disabled <b>persons</b> <b>have</b> lower rates of employment, and often work part-time for low wages. The advocacy organization Bizchut stated that Arab citizens with disabilities were employed at half the rate of Jews with disabilities, and that shortages of funding for Arab municipalities adversely affected the disabled of these communities.|$|E
50|$|At no {{time can}} one <b>person</b> <b>have</b> {{in his or}} her {{possession}} the combinations or keys to gain lone access to a security container or cryptographic equipment containing COMSEC material.
