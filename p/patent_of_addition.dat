40|$|University {{patenting}} {{has been}} drawing attention of researchers studying university-industry relations, technology transfer mechanisms, changing research motives of the academe and consequences on their scientific performance. This study aims {{to develop a}} methodology for comprehensive analysis <b>of</b> university <b>patents</b> as the milestone of commercialization process of scientific knowledge produced by the academe, and evaluates preliminary findings for Turkey. For this purpose, patent applications at the Turkish Patent Institute are analyzed and a relational database is designed for storing university and researcher (academic inventor) characteristics, as well as industrial classification information <b>of</b> <b>patents.</b> In <b>addition,</b> interviews are conducted with academics in inventors list <b>of</b> <b>patent</b> applications to gather qualitative information about research activities and commercialization <b>of</b> <b>patents.</b> Results indicate that university patenting in Turkey is extremely low in number and commercialization is at its early stages. However, the results are based on very limited information, and with the aim developing a methodology, this study is open for further improvement in information gathering, as well as consistency in analyses.

40|$|Fluctuations in {{patenting}} {{frequency and}} propensity to patent have caught increasing interest, {{not the least}} since {{the emergence of a}} worldwide pro-patent era. In this paper, fluctuations in Swedish patent frequency are described and analysed, based on statistics and questionnaire survey studies among large and small patentees as well as among IP consultancy firms, complemented with interviews. The results confirm the importance of size of R&D and size <b>of</b> <b>patenting</b> resources for both large and small firms and for both positive and negative growth <b>of</b> <b>patenting.</b> In <b>addition,</b> some new determinants were found, of which some also discriminated between large and small firms. A shift to more quality-oriented patenting strategies with more selective patenting led to decreased patenting propensity and frequency, especially among large firms. As to propensity to patent using different routes, national first filings are declining in the longer run on average for small countries like Sweden and Finland, as especially large companies internationalise their IP operations and increasingly use the PCT route...|$|R
