40|$|BackgroundPeripherally {{inserted}} central catheters (PICCs) removed prematurely for unconfirmed {{infection or}} thrombosis lead to subsequent reinsertions and associated complications. To improve clinical quality, a mandatory electronic communication tool (MECT) based on clinical practice guidelines was mandated for all inpatient adult PICCs in an academically affiliated tertiary medical center. This MECT facilitated early communication and specialized evaluation with the PICC team for any complications related to PICCs. MethodsA historical cohort study was conducted. Quality and cost measurements for 200 PICCs postinstitution of a MECT {{were compared with}} 200 PICCs 12 months prior. PICC removal and complication rates were compared for the 2 cohorts. ResultsSignificant outcomes included a central-line associated blood stream infection rate that changed from 1. 38 / 1, 000 catheter days to 0 / 1, 000 catheter days, 0 provider-led <b>premature</b> PICC <b>removals,</b> an overall 84 % decrease in <b>premature</b> PICC <b>removals</b> (from 16 %- 2. 5 %; P[*]<[*]. 0001), {{a decrease in the}} total complication rate from 45. 5 %- 24 % (P[*]<[*]. 0001), and 25 % reduction in radiology costs.

The total number of CVC days was 19, 328 (median: 122 days, range: 1 - 385). The overall rate of complications was 6. 2 / 1000 CVC days, i. e., 4. 5 / 1000 and 1. 7 / 1000 CVC days for mechanical and infectious complications, respectively. Interestingly, only two CVC-related cases of septicemia and no thrombotic events were documented. At {{the end of the}} study period, 38 of 129 CVC (29. 5 %) had been removed: 20 due to CVC-related complications (dislocation 18, rupture 2), 10 due to the patient's death, and 8 due to completion of therapy.

5000|$|The Court {{ruled that}} because {{subject-matter}} jurisdiction {{existed at the}} time of judgment, the jurisdictional defect had been cured, and the Sixth Circuit erred in ruling otherwise. But Lewis had preserved his objection to federal jurisdiction by filing a motion to remand the case to state court and then by raising the issue on appeal. Shouldn't the plaintiff be rewarded for his diligent effort to preserve his choice to try the case in state court? Lewis argued that to allow Caterpillar to benefit from the district court's mistake would encourage defendants to seek removal more often in the hopes that the district court will make a mistake they might exploit. [...] "These arguments are hardly meritless but they run up against an overriding consideration. Once a diversity case has been tried in federal court, with rules of decision supplied by state law under the regime of Erie Railroad Co. v. Tompkins, , considerations of finality, efficiency, and economy become overwhelming." [...] If the Court were to require that a case that had proceeded through trial to judgment had to be dismissed afterward for lack of jurisdiction, there would be a tremendous waste of judicial resources.

This is followed by a period of consolidation to allow the regenerate bone to become structurally competent and therefore tolerate axial load in weight bearing. <b>Premature</b> <b>removal</b> of the external fixator is associated with a risk of fracture or deformation of the regenerate bone with a reported incidence of between 3.6 and 24  % [5, 6, 7, 8].|$|E
30|$|In our study, {{titanium}} mesh exposure occurred in 33 % of the augmented sites. However, a <b>premature</b> <b>removal</b> of these exposed meshes {{was not necessary}} {{in any of these}} cases. In addition, exposure of the mesh did not affect the final outcome of the augmentation as implant insertion was possible in all cases in the desired position, indicating a success rate of 100 % for the augmentation technique. The {{titanium mesh}} exposure is a common complication, with reported exposure rates between 0 and 80 % in the international literature [11, 17]. Sumida et al. investigated custom-made titanium devices for bone augmentation compared to conventional titanium meshes in 26 patients [15]. Mucosal rupture occurred in a patient in the custom-made group (7.7 %) and 3 in the conventional group (23.1 %), indicating better results for the individualized mesh, however, neither statistically nor clinically significant. In a further clinical study investigating a conventional titanium mesh, exposure occurred in 6 of the 17 patients (35 %) [22]. Two of them were early exposures (within 2  weeks) and 4 of them late exposures. Corinaldesi et al. showed an exposure rate of 14.8 % [23]. These cases necessitated <b>premature</b> <b>removal</b> of the titanium mesh. In these exposed sites, reduction in mean bone regeneration was observed compared to mesh-retained sites in patients who received simultaneous augmentation and implant placement. A critical point discussed in the international literature is the time elapsed between augmentation procedure and exposure. An early exposure within the first weeks showed a negative impact on bone regeneration in contrast to a late exposure [12, 23 – 25]. To prevent such an exposure, an accurate soft tissue handling in terms of tension-free flaps over the mesh is mandatory.|$|E

40|$|Summary: Given the {{constraints}} of a short metaphyseal fragment and adjacent growth plates, there are limited options for operative fixation of metadiaphyseal fractures of the femur in children. This article outlines the surgical technique and reports early results of metadiaphyseal pediatric femur fractures treated with an Ilizarov external fixator by a single surgeon. Ten skeletally immature males with 5 proximal and 5 distal metadiaphyseal femur fractures un-derwent closed reduction and application of an Ilizarov external fixator. Time in the fixator averaged 138 (range, 104 – 180) days. At a mean follow-up of 26 months, there were no cases of loss of reduction, refracture, malalignment, leg length inequality, or loss of knee and hip mobility.

30|$|Ilizarov {{frames are}} {{increasingly}} utilised {{for the treatment}} of lower limb trauma and deformity. Determining bone union and the timing of frame removal can be difficult, and currently no gold standard method exists [1]. Current practice is to assess healing clinically and by serial radiographs and, sometimes, computed tomography [2]. These methods {{have been shown to be}} inaccurate and correlate poorly with fracture union and the development of complications [3]. Frames are cumbersome and difficult to live with; patients therefore prefer them removed as soon as possible. Prolonged time in a frame limits rehabilitation and can result in joint stiffness [4, 5]. Fixation elements present a potential source of infection [6], and unnecessary prolonged frame time increases complication rates [7]. Direct and indirect healthcare costs are further increased as patients are often unable to return to work with the frame in place, will attend more outpatient appointments and undergo a higher number of investigations with prolonged frame time. Thus, timely removal is desirable. However, <b>premature</b> frame <b>removal</b> before the fracture has fully consolidated can result in serious complications and treatment failure, particularly re-fracture, non-union and deformity [8]. It is desirable to investigate alternative methods to assess fracture union that could be as an adjunct to current methods.|$|R

40|$|Aims To {{determine}} sacral neuromodulation {{battery life}} and the patient and provider risk factors for early explantation in a population‐based sample. Methods A 5 % sample of Medicare beneficiaries from 1997 to 2007 served as the data source. All patients who had a sacral neuromodulation device implanted in that time period were included. Variables included in a multivariate analysis of risk factors for removal included gender, age, race, diagnosis, type of test phase, provider specialty, and volume. The number of device reprogramming events was also recorded in this time period. Results Mean follow‐up was 60. 5 months. Patients on average had 2. 15 reprogramming episodes in their first year, with that number decreasing over subsequent years. Out of the 558 batteries implanted 63 (11. 3 %) were explanted. Of the 19 implanted individuals who carried the diagnosis of interstitial cystitis (IC), 11 (57. 9 %) had the battery removed. This was the only variable that predicted early removal, with an odds ratio of explantation of 10. 5 (95 % CI: 3. 9 – 28. 4).
