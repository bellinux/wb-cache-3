40|$|AIM: To {{compare the}} {{short-term}} efficacy {{of domestic and}} imported prostaglandins(PGs) for patients first diagnosed as primary open angle glaucoma. METHODS: This study was a prospective positive drug control trial and 338 patients diagnosed as primary open angle glaucoma at the first time. According to patients' wills, they were divided into the experiment group(181 cases) and the control group(157 cases). Domestic latanoprost eye drops with 0. 05 g/L was used for 3 mo {{in the experimental group}} while imported travoprost eye drops with 0. 04 g/L was used in the control group for 3 mo. All patients were typically treated at 21 : 00 every day within a 3 mo period. Intraocular pressure(IOP) was measured before <b>treatments</b> and <b>post</b> <b>treatments</b> at 1, 2 and 3 mo respectively, in each group. RESULTS: For the experimental group, IOP was 28. 32 ± 5. 72, 21. 84 ± 4. 63, 19. 53 ± 4. 04 and 18. 15 ± 3. 35 mmHg before <b>treatments</b> and <b>post</b> <b>treatments</b> at 1, 2 and 3 mo respectively, showing a significant difference among various time points(F = 370. 019, P = 0. 000),and the IOPs were markedly lower <b>post</b> <b>treatments</b> than those before treatments(all P F = 306. 052, P = 0. 000),and the IOP were markedly lower <b>post</b> <b>treatments</b> than those before treatments(all P P = 0. 144, 0. 456, 0. 051). CONCLUSION: Domestic latanoprost eye drops can reduce IOP effectively, with a suitable price, and it {{can be used as a}} first choice for primary open angle glaucoma patients in the basic-level hospitals...|$|R
