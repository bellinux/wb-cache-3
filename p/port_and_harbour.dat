After the Queen's Rangers were disbanded, the family moved {{around the country in}} search of work and eventually settled in York (now Toronto), where MacNab was educated at the Home District Grammar School.|$|E

25|$|By 1800, {{the canal}} {{was in a}} poor condition, and another £57,000 of public money was spent {{refurbishing}} it over the following ten years. Closures during the refurbishment resulted {{in a loss of}} traffic, which did not fully recover. In 1829, both canals were transferred to a private company, who spent £80,000 on improvements over the next twenty years. The ship canal was enlarged in 1884, to allow ships of 5,000 tons to reach Newry. It reverted to public ownership in 1901, when the Newry <b>Port</b> <b>and</b> <b>Harbour</b> Authority was created. The canal closed in 1936 and most of it was officially abandoned in 1949, with some in 1956. The ship canal closed in 1966 and the Authority was wound up in 1974.|$|E
25|$|Scotland is the EU's largest {{petroleum}} producer, {{with the}} discovery of North Sea oil transforming the Scottish economy. Oil was discovered in the North Sea in 1966, with the first year of full production taking place in 1976. With the growth of oil exploration during that time, as well as the ancillary industries needed to support it, the city of Aberdeen became the UK's centre of the North Sea Oil Industry, with the <b>port</b> <b>and</b> <b>harbour</b> serving many oil fields off shore. Sullom Voe in Shetland is the site of a major oil terminal, where oil is piped in and transferred to tankers. Similarly the Flotta Oil Terminal in Orkney is linked by a 230km long pipeline to the Piper and Occidental oil fields in the North Sea. Grangemouth is at the centre of Scotland's petrochemicals industry. The oil related industries are a major source of employment and income in these regions. It is estimated that the industry employs around 100,000 workers (or 6% of the working population) of Scotland.|$|E

2500|$|In 1884, {{the company}} carried out its last major {{engineering}} project, when {{the upper reaches}} of Carlingford Lough and the lower Newry River were made deeper, and the navigable channel widened to [...] This allowed ships of up to 5,000 tons to reach Newry. The project cost £55,000, and was authorised by the Newry Navigation Act. There were plans to extend the Clogher Valley Railway to Newry in 1900, but those proposing the scheme realised that the Newry Navigation Company would object to the scheme, and relationships between the Canal company and Newry Urban Council were already strained. The railway scheme was thus dropped, after which the promoters and council jointly approached the Canal company, with a plan to buy out the company and create a public corporation, in which the interests of the town and port would be adequately represented. The Newry <b>Port</b> <b>and</b> <b>Harbour</b> Trust was established in 1901, and the Newry Canal made a small profit until the First World War. Afterwards, maintenance costs swamped any income received, and the last recorded commercial traffic was in 1936. The Northern Ireland administration had no interest in canals, and a warrant of abandonment was issued on 7 May 1949, which covered all but the Newry town section, which was similarly abandoned on 21 March 1956. Soon the swing bridges in Newry were replaced by fixed bridges, cutting off the canal from the sea, and the ship canal was closed in 1966 when Warrenpoint replaced the port of Newry. The Newry <b>Port</b> <b>and</b> <b>Harbour</b> Trust was wound up in 1974.|$|E
