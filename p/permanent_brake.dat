40|$|Abstract — Current paper {{contains}} three reviewed {{research papers}} on the electro-magnetic braking. Electro-magnetic braking is now taking a good pace in the applications on the day to day stuffs like cars, machine stopper and as motion retarder as well. Rather than a conventional contact friction braking, this system are more efficient, quick in the response and has no wear so it has good durability. So three different papers are reviewed and summarized here to know the principles, applicability and future scope of electro-magnetic braking system. Key words: electro-magnetic <b>braking,</b> <b>Permanent</b> magnet; Magnetic <b>braking,</b> FEM of electromagnetic braking...|$|R
50|$|Both {{power off}} brakes are {{considered}} to be engaged when no power is applied to them. They are typically required to hold or to stop alone {{in the event of a}} loss of power or when power is not available in a machine circuit. <b>Permanent</b> magnet <b>brakes</b> have a very high torque for their size, but also require a constant current control to offset the permanent magnetic field. Spring applied brakes do not require a constant current control, they can use a simple rectifier, but are larger in diameter or would need stacked friction disks to increase the torque.|$|R
5000|$|Power off brakes stop or hold a load when {{electrical}} power is either accidentally lost or intentionally disconnected. In the past, {{some companies have}} referred to these as [...] "fail safe" [...] brakes. These brakes are typically used on or near an electric motor. Typical applications include robotics, holding brakes for Z axis ball screws and servo motor brakes. Brakes are available in multiple voltages and can have either standard backlash or zero backlash hubs. Multiple disks {{can also be used}} to increase brake torque, without increasing brake diameter. There are 2 main types of holding brakes. The first is spring applied brakes. The second is <b>permanent</b> magnet <b>brakes.</b>|$|R
5000|$|The bulk {{of these}} {{features}} are concentrated {{at the base of}} the attraction; foremost among these is the tower's <b>permanent</b> magnet <b>braking</b> system. Using the principles of magnetism, these brakes slow down the falling gondola gently, yet rapidly, without actually contacting the gondola. These magnets do not require electricity to produce their magnetic fields, and as such they are able to function even in the event of a total power failure. Lastly, pneumatic plungers [...] "catch" [...] the slowly descending gondola and allow it to settle to the tower base. Like the magnetic brakes, these plungers do not require power to function properly. Acrophobia requires the rider to be at least fifty-four inches tall.|$|R
50|$|Permanent magnet type - A <b>permanent</b> magnet holding <b>brake</b> {{looks very}} similar to a {{standard}} power applied electromagnetic brake. Instead of squeezing a friction disk, via springs, it uses permanent magnets to attract a single face armature. When the brake is engaged, the permanent magnets create magnetic lines of flux, which can in turn attract the armature to the brake housing. To disengage the brake, power {{is applied to the}} coil which sets up an alternate magnetic field that cancels out the magnetic flux of the permanent magnets.|$|R
5000|$|Coasting with {{a vehicle}} not in gear is {{prohibited}} by law in most U.S. states. An example is Maine Revised Statutes Title 29-A, Chapter 19, §2064 [...] "An operator, when traveling on a downgrade, may not coast with the gears {{of the vehicle}} in neutral". Some regulations differ between commercial vehicles not to disengage the clutch for downgrade, and passenger vehicles to set the transmission to neutral. This regulations point on how drivers operate a vehicle. Not using the engine on longer precipitous downgrade roads or <b>permanent</b> using the <b>brake</b> might cause a failure due overheating brakes.|$|R
40|$|Road {{and rail}} {{vehicles}} and aircraft rely mainly or solely on friction brakes. These brakes pose several problems, especially in hybrid vehicles: significant wear, fading, complex and slow actuation, lack of fail-safe features, increased fuel consumption due to power assistance, and requirement for anti-lock controls. To solve these problems, a contactless magnetic brake has been developed. This concept includes a novel flux-shunting structure {{to control the}} excitation flux generated by <b>permanent</b> magnets. This <b>brake</b> is wear-free, less-sensitive to temperature than friction brakes, has fast and simple actuation, and has a reduced sensitivity to wheel-lock. The present dissertation includes an introduction to friction braking, a theory of eddy-current braking, analytical and numerical models of the eddy-current brake, its excitation and power generation, record of experimental validation, investigation and simulation of {{the integration of the}} brake in conventional and hybrid vehicles...|$|R
40|$|AbstractDevelopment of {{the device}} for {{diagnostics}} of electromechanical friction brakes is relevant due to a wide application of the latter in the robotics industry, machine tool, lift and carry machine and aircraft building as well as various automated systems and process facilities. The paper specifies {{advantages and disadvantages of}} the known contact and non-contact methods of control of friction electromagnetic permanent magnet devices. It proposes a simple technical solution for control of friction electromagnetic permanent magnet devices. It peculiarity is in change of electric impedance of the controlled circuit that considers a closed and opened state of the disk armature as well as external and internal poles of the coil flux guide of electromechanical friction brakes. To improve operational performance {{of the device}} for control of the <b>permanent</b> magnet friction <b>brakes,</b> a complex of researches has been carried out based on which its most sustainable scheme has been obtained. It does not require complicated circuits for protection against false triggering...|$|R
