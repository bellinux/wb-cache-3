5|$|As {{tensions}} rose, Croatia declared independence on 25 June 1991; {{however, the}} full implementation of declaration only came into effect on 8 October 1991. In the meantime, tensions escalated into overt war when the Yugoslav People's Army (JNA) and various Serb <b>paramilitary</b> <b>groups</b> attacked Croatia. By {{the end of}} 1991, a high-intensity conflict fought along a wide front reduced Croatia to control of only about two-thirds of its territory. The various Serb <b>paramilitary</b> <b>groups</b> then began pursuing a campaign of killing, terror and expulsion against the non-Serb population in the rebel territories, killing thousands of Croat civilians and forcing at least 170,000 from their homes.|$|E
5|$|By {{the end of}} 1987, {{the militant}} youth groups had fought not only the Sri Lankan {{security}} forces and the Indian Peace Keeping Force also among each other, with the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) eventually eliminating most of the others. Except for the LTTE, many of the remaining organisations transformed into either minor political parties within the Tamil National Alliance or standalone political parties. Some also function as <b>paramilitary</b> <b>groups</b> within the Sri Lankan military.|$|E

5|$|The 298 LT vz. 35 {{tanks were}} {{assigned}} to the armoured regiments belonging to the four Mobile (Rychlá) Divisions between 1936—39. Each regiment was supposed to detach three-tank platoons to support the infantry divisions and border areas in times of crisis. These platoons were heavily used suppressing the protests and violence instigated by Konrad Henlein's Sudeten German Party (Sudetendeutsche Partei - SdP) and the Sudetendeutsche Freikorps (<b>paramilitary</b> <b>groups</b> trained in Germany by SS-instructors) between May and October 1938.|$|E
5|$|After the Omagh bombing, the RIRA {{leadership}} {{were unwilling}} to launch a full-scale campaign in Northern Ireland due {{to the possibility of}} civilians being killed. Instead they decided to launch a series of attacks in England, in particular London, which they hoped would attract disenchanted Provisional IRA members to join the RIRA. On 1 June 2000 a bomb damaged Hammersmith Bridge; a symbolic target for Irish republican <b>paramilitary</b> <b>groups.</b> The bridge had been targeted by the Irish Republican Army on 29 March 1939 as part of its Sabotage Campaign, and by the Provisional IRA on 24 April 1996.|$|E
5|$|As groups {{supporting}} {{autonomy and}} independence began campaigning, {{a series of}} pro-integration <b>paramilitary</b> <b>groups</b> of East Timorese began threatening violence—and indeed committing violence—around the country. Alleging pro-independence bias {{on the part of}} UNAMET, the groups were seen working with and receiving training from Indonesian soldiers. Before the May agreement was announced, an April paramilitary attack in Liquiça left dozens of East Timorese dead. On 16 May 1999, a gang accompanied by Indonesian troops attacked suspected independence activists in the village of Atara; in June another group attacked a UNAMET office in Maliana.|$|E

They were, seemingly, murdered by state-sponsored <b>paramilitary</b> <b>groups</b> led by Cherkes Ahmet, and lieutenants Halil and Nazım, at a locality called Karacaören shortly before arriving at Diyarbakır. Marzbed, another deportee, was dispatched to Kayseri to appear before a court martial on 18 May 1915.|$|E
5|$|Within {{hours of}} the results, <b>paramilitary</b> <b>groups</b> had begun attacking people and setting fires around the capital Dili. Foreign journalists and {{election}} observers fled, {{and tens of thousands}} of East Timorese took to the mountains. Islamic gangs attacked Dili's Catholic Diocese building, killing two dozen people; the next day, the headquarters of the ICRC was attacked and burned to the ground. Almost one hundred people were killed later in Suai, and reports of similar massacres poured in from around East Timor. The UN withdrew most of its personnel, but the Dili compound had been flooded with refugees.|$|E
5|$|In {{the three}} decades {{following}} 1969, {{the army was}} heavily deployed in Northern Ireland's Operation Banner to support the Royal Ulster Constabulary (later the Police Service of Northern Ireland) in their conflict with republican <b>paramilitary</b> <b>groups.</b> The locally recruited Ulster Defence Regiment was formed, becoming home-service battalions of the Royal Irish Regiment in 1992 before it was disbanded in 2006. Over 700 soldiers were killed during the Troubles. Following the 1994–1996 IRA ceasefires and since 1997, demilitarisation {{has been part of}} the peace process and the military presence has been reduced. On 25 June 2007 the 2nd Battalion of the Princess of Wales's Royal Regiment left the army complex in Bessbrook, County Armagh, ending the longest operation in British Army history.|$|E

The first post-Sun City military law {{appears to have been}} passed on 12 November 2004, which formally created the new national Forces Armées de la République Démocratique du Congo (FARDC). Included in this law was article 45, which recognized the incorporation of a number of armed groups into the FARDC, including the former government army Forces Armées Congolaises (FAC), ex-FAZ personnel also known as former President Mobutu's 'les tigres', the RCD-Goma, RCD-ML, RCD-N, MLC, the Mai-Mai, as well as other government-determined military and <b>paramilitary</b> <b>groups.</b>|$|E
5|$|Roughly 49% of {{diamonds}} originate from Central and Southern Africa, although significant {{sources of the}} mineral have been discovered in Canada, India, Russia, Brazil, and Australia. They are mined from kimberlite and lamproite volcanic pipes, which can bring diamond crystals, originating from deep within the Earth where high pressures and temperatures enable them to form, to the surface. The mining and distribution of natural diamonds are subjects of frequent controversy such as concerns over the sale of blood diamonds or conflict diamonds by African <b>paramilitary</b> <b>groups.</b> The diamond supply chain is controlled by {{a limited number of}} powerful businesses, and is also highly concentrated in a small number of locations around the world.|$|E
5|$|The Bijeljina {{massacre}} {{involved the}} killing of between 48 and 78 civilians by Serb <b>paramilitary</b> <b>groups</b> in Bijeljina on 1–2 April 1992 during the Bosnian War. The majority of those killed were Bosniaks (or Bosnian Muslims). Members of other ethnicities were also killed, such as Serbs deemed disloyal by the local authorities. The killing was committed by a local paramilitary group known as Mirko's Chetniks and by the Serb Volunteer Guard (SDG, also known as Arkan's Tigers), a Serbia-based paramilitary group led by Željko Ražnatović (aka Arkan). The SDG were {{under the command of}} the Yugoslav People's Army (JNA), which was controlled by Serbian President Slobodan Milošević.|$|E

5|$|Tuđman's {{programme}} {{was opposed}} by {{many members of}} Croatia's Serb minority, towards whom he was overtly antagonistic. The Serb Democratic Party (SDS) of Croatia, supported by Milošević, denounced the HDZ as a reincarnation of the nationalist-fascist Ustaše movement, which had massacred {{hundreds of thousands of}} Serbs during the Second World War. From mid-1990, the SDS mounted an armed rebellion in Serb-inhabited areas of Croatia and set up the self-declared Serbian Autonomous Oblast of Krajina with covert support from the Serbian government and Serbian <b>paramilitary</b> <b>groups.</b> The Croatian government rapidly lost control of large areas of the republic. In February 1991, the Krajina Serbs declared independence from Croatia and announced that they would unite with Serbia. Other Serb communities around Croatia also announced that they would secede and established their own militias.|$|E
5|$|On September 7, 1874, the new {{constitution}} was completed and signed {{by a majority of}} delegates. The entire electorate, including the disenfranchised Confederates and the Freedmen, voted. The election not only was for ratification of the {{new constitution}} but also for state officials that would be elected if the constitution was indeed ratified. The Republicans actually took the same position that the Democrats had taken earlier, believing that the election was illegal they nominated no candidates. Conservative Democrats and allied <b>paramilitary</b> <b>groups</b> suppressed black voting, using a combination of intimidation, blocking blacks from the polls, and outright assassinations. The new constitution was ratified on October 13, 1874 and Democratic officials elected almost unanimously, including new Democratic Governor Augustus H. Garland who was inaugurated November 12, 1874, and Baxter left office after only serving two years of a four-year term.|$|E
5|$|The Battle of Vukovar was an 87-day {{siege of}} Vukovar in eastern Croatia by the Yugoslav People's Army (JNA), {{supported}} by various paramilitary forces from Serbia, between August and November 1991. Before the Croatian War of Independence the Baroque town was a prosperous, mixed community of Croats, Serbs and other ethnic groups. As Yugoslavia {{began to break}} up, Serbia's President Slobodan Milošević and Croatia's President Franjo Tuđman began pursuing nationalist politics. In 1990, an armed insurrection was started by Croatian Serb militias, supported by the Serbian government and <b>paramilitary</b> <b>groups,</b> who seized control of Serb-populated areas of Croatia. The JNA began to intervene in favour of the rebellion, and conflict {{broke out in the}} eastern Croatian region of Slavonia in May 1991. In August, the JNA launched a full-scale attack against Croatian-held territory in eastern Slavonia, including Vukovar.|$|E

5|$|The largest {{numbers of}} Catholic {{refugees}} {{came from the}} two northern dioceses with {{the highest percentage of}} Catholics in Vietnam. These were Phát Diêm and Bùi Chu, mainly located in modern-day Ninh Bình and Nam Định Provinces respectively. The bishops of the dioceses, had been strident opponents of the communists, and both had organised Catholic <b>paramilitary</b> <b>groups</b> that fought against the Viet Minh, which had long identified Catholics with colonial collaborationism. When the communists had gained the upper hand in the north, many Catholics had already begun making preparations to move to the south, where the communists were less influential, and large movements began immediately when news of the partition came through. After the defeat of French Union forces at Dien Bien Phu, French officers had evacuated their troops from Bui Chu and Phat Diem to reinforce the area between Hanoi and Haiphong which they still controlled, making it very easy for the communists to progress through the Catholic strongholds.|$|E
5|$|In Wings of Liberty, Mengsk {{and his son}} Valerian {{find the}} Dominion opposed by several rebel and <b>paramilitary</b> <b>groups,</b> {{including}} those loyal to Raynor. Arcturus suffers compound setbacks during the game, initially due to the mass invasion of Dominion space by Zerg forces which catches the Dominion military and Mengsk unprepared, and later from Raynor's Raiders who capture and broadcast proof of Mengsk's war crimes during the events of StarCraft. Despite these setbacks Arcturus manages to overcome these hardships, maintaining his position as Emperor of the Dominion {{for the remainder of}} the game. During the events of Heart of the Swarm, Mengsk tries to have Kerrigan killed on several occasions, including issuing an obituary about Raynor. Kerrigan however, successfully reunites the Zerg Swarm and storms the Dominion capital of Augustgrad on the planet Korhal with help from Raynor's Raiders. After a showdown with Acturus Mengsk inside his Palace, Kerrigan manages to gain the upper hand with help from James Raynor, and kills Acturus by overloading his body with psychic energy, causing him to explode spectacularly. In the wake of his death, Valerian ascends to the throne vacated by Arcturus.|$|E
5|$|The wolf is a {{frequent}} charge in English armory. It is illustrated as a supporter on the shields of Lord Welby, Rendel, and Viscount Wolseley, {{and can be found}} on the coat of arms of Lovett and the vast majority of the Wilsons and Lows. The demi-wolf is a common crest, appearing in the arms and crests of members of many families, including that of the Wolfes, whose crest depicts a demi-wolf holding a crown in its paws, in reference to the assistance the family gave to Charles II during the battle of Worcester. Wolf heads are common in Scottish heraldry, particularly in the coats of Clan Robertson and Skene. The wolf is the most common animal in Spanish heraldry, and is often depicted as carrying a lamb in its mouth, or across its back. The wolf is featured on the flags of the Confederated Tribes of the Colville Reservation, the Oneida Nation of Wisconsin and the Pawnee. In modern times, the wolf is widely used as an emblem for military and <b>paramilitary</b> <b>groups.</b> It is the unofficial symbol of the spetsnaz, and serves as the logo of the Turkish Grey Wolves. During the Yugoslav Wars, several Serb paramilitary units adopted the wolf as their symbol, including the White Wolves and the Wolves of Vučjak.|$|E
