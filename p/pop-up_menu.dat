500|$|The G2 {{ships with}} Android 4.2.2 [...] "Jelly Bean" [...] with a custom {{interface}} and software. It contains {{a number of}} features {{that are designed to}} [...] "learn" [...] from users by predicting future actions, and allow for flexibility and customization. The G2 retains features from previous LG models such as the Optimus G and G Pro, including QuickMemo (which allows users to write notes on top of a screenshot), QuickRemote (a feature which allows the device to serve as a universal remote), QSlide pop-up apps, and Voice Mate. New features introduced by the G2 include TextLink, which analyzes text messages to detect content such as addresses and times that can be passed to other apps (such as the calendar, a note, or Google Maps), a <b>pop-up</b> <b>menu</b> of relevant apps triggered when plugging in headphones or a USB cable (Plug & Pop), the ability to answer a phone call by holding the phone to the user's head (AnswerMe), Slide Aside, a multitasking feature which allows users to [...] "slide" [...] away apps onto cards with a three-finger gesture, the Clip Tray (which collects content that had been copied to the clipboard), and Guest Mode. The G2 uses on-screen buttons; users can change their background color (which includes black and white options, either solid colored or with a gradient), customize the order of the buttons, or add additional buttons for opening QuickMemo or the notification shade. The G2's default music player supports the playback of WAV and FLAC files with 24-bit/192kHz audio.|$|E
500|$|The Start screen {{received}} several enhancements on Windows 8.1, including an extended [...] "All Apps" [...] view with sort modes (accessed by clicking a new down arrow button or swiping upward), small and extra-large sizes for tiles, and colored tiles for desktop program shortcuts. Additional customization options were also added, such as expanded color options, new backgrounds (some of which incorporate animated elements), {{and the ability}} for the Start screen to use the desktop background instead. Applications are no longer added to the Start screen automatically when installed, and all applications now have colored tiles (desktop programs were previously shown in a single color). The app snapping system has also been extended; up to four apps can be snapped onto a single display depending on screen size, apps can be snapped to fill half the screen, and {{can also be used}} on any display in a multi-monitor configuration. Apps can also launch other apps in a snapped view to display content; for example, the Mail app can open a photo attachment in a picture viewer snapped to another half of the screen. Improved support is also provided by apps for using devices in a portrait (vertical) orientation. The lock screen offers the ability to use a photo slideshow as its backdrop, and a shortcut to the Camera app by swiping up. The on-screen keyboard has an improved autocomplete mechanism which displays multiple word suggestions, and allows users to select from them by sliding on the spacebar. The autocomplete dictionary is also automatically updated using data from Bing, allowing it to recognize and suggest words relating to current trends and events. Similarly to Windows Phone, certain apps now display a narrow bar with three dots on it to indicate the presence of a <b>pop-up</b> <b>menu</b> accessible by swiping, clicking on the dots, or right-clicking.|$|E

50|$|Computer-based editing {{can involve}} very {{frequent}} use of cut-and-paste operations. Most software-suppliers provide several methods for performing such tasks, and this can involve (for example) key combinations, pulldown <b>menus,</b> <b>pop-up</b> <b>menus,</b> or toolbar buttons.|$|R
50|$|The {{method is}} not only limited to the {{response}} to imperative button presses and mouse clicks - <b>pop-up</b> <b>menus</b> can be pruned and/or altered, or a web search can focus results based on previous searches.|$|R
50|$|Each MGR window had {{support for}} both {{character}} terminal operations {{as well as}} basic graphics operations. It was controlled by mousing <b>pop-up</b> <b>menus,</b> by keyboard interaction, and by escape sequences written on pseudo-terminals by client software.|$|R

50|$|DESQview was {{released}} in July 1985, four months before Microsoft introduced {{the first version of}} Windows. It was widely thought to be the first program to bring multitasking and windowing capabilities to DOS, but in fact there was a predecessor, IBM's TopView, which shipped March 1985, from which DESQview inherited the <b>pop-up</b> <b>menu.</b>|$|E
50|$|Interface Builder {{provides}} palettes, or collections, of {{user interface}} objects to an Objective-C developer. These user interface objects contain items like text fields, data tables, sliders, and <b>pop-up</b> <b>menus.</b> Interface Builder's palettes are completely extensible, meaning any developer can develop new objects and add palettes to Interface Builder.|$|R

40|$|Wearable {{computing}} {{technology offers}} tremendous possibilities to support users in performing {{a variety of}} tasks that go beyond traditional desk-based computer interaction. Recent wearable systems share many capabilities with desk-based workstations, but often differ in the way user input is acquired and processed. This paper investigates four commercially available pointing devices and four on-screen menu configurations to assess which are most appropriate for performing menu selection tasks using a wearable computer system in a mobile and stationary scenario. We conducted a controlled user study to compare a trackball, touchpad, gyroscopic mouse and Twiddler 2 in combination with pull-down, linear (fixed and pop-up) and pie <b>pop-up</b> <b>menus.</b> Our results indicate that pie <b>pop-up</b> <b>menus</b> are the most effective menu structure irrespective of the input device used, and that the trackball device outperforms the remaining devices in terms of speed and error rate. 1...|$|R

50|$|Commandos 3 was {{relatively}} well received. However, {{it was also}} criticized for being difficult to play on account of having fewer hotkeys than its predecessors. The player has to control the commandos using the buttons in the <b>pop-up</b> <b>menu</b> {{at the bottom of}} the screen. Also, the game is locked at an 800x600 resolution which {{was relatively}} low at the time of release.|$|E

40|$|We {{investigate}} {{menu selection}} in circular and rectangular <b>pop-up</b> <b>menus</b> using stylus-driven direct input on {{horizontal and vertical}} display surfaces. An experiment measured performance in a target acquisition task in three different conditions: direct input on a horizontal display surface, direct input on a vertical display and indirect input to a vertical display. The third condition allows comparison of direct and indirect techniques commonly used for vertical displays. The {{results of the study}} show that both left-handed and right-handed users demonstrate a consistent, but mirrored pattern of selection times that is corroborated by qualitative measures of user preference. We describe a menu placement strategy for a tabletop display that detects the handedness of the user and displays rectangular <b>pop-up</b> <b>menus.</b> This placement is {{based on the results of}} our study. Key words: Pen-input devices, horizontal display, vertical display, direct input, indirect input, handedness, tabletop display. ...|$|R
50|$|An AWE {{application}} {{can enhance}} the interactive console window menu items {{that can be used}} to execute program units and exit, providing a GUI for an interactive application. The program units can operate using <b>pop-ups,</b> <b>menus,</b> and display windows, so that the traditional console I/O is not used at all, and thus providing an all-Fortran GUI driven application on all three supported platforms.|$|R
50|$|The {{printing}} dialog in Tiger now {{features a}} {{drop down menu}} for creating PDFs, sending PDFs to Mail, and other PDF related actions. However, the user interface {{has been criticized for}} creating a hybrid widget that looks like a plain button but acts like a <b>pop-up</b> <b>menu.</b> This is one of only three places in the entire Mac OS X interface where such an element appears.|$|E
50|$|Firefox 55.0.1 was {{released}} on August 10, 2017 for desktop only, {{just two days after}} its initial launch, fixing some issues including a regression of the tab restoration process.

50|$|Fluxbox is a {{stacking}} {{window manager}} for the X Window System, which started as a fork of Blackbox 0.61.1 in 2001, with the same aim to be lightweight. Its user interface has only a taskbar, a <b>pop-up</b> <b>menu</b> accessible by right-clicking on the desktop, and minimal support for graphical icons. All basic configurations are controlled by text files, including the construction of menus and the mapping of key-bindings. Fluxbox has high compliance to the Extended Window Manager Hints specification.|$|E
5000|$|With some {{katakana}} or hiragana text {{selected by}} highlighting it, the user may choose the [...] "Convert to related character" [...] option on the drop-down menu. The highlighted word is now shown underlined. Clicking on the underlined word presents a <b>pop-up</b> <b>menu</b> with four options. These are the hiragana, katakana, full-width rÅmaji and half-width rÅmaji equivalents {{of the selected}} word. Choosing the first option, for example, converts the selected word to the hiragana equivalent [...] "crane" [...] (tsuru).|$|E
50|$|The {{integrated}} Archive Manager plugin supports numerous {{data compression}} file formats such as ZIP files. Furthermore, a support for metadata {{systems such as}} Exif, IPTC and ID3-Tags for audio and video files, and other documents (e.g. pdf) is integrated. This metadata {{can be used for}} example by means of an extended tool for renaming files. It is possible to define actions depending on certain file extensions and to start these actions via a <b>pop-up</b> <b>menu</b> by right-clicking on the file.|$|E
50|$|The OpenGL Utility Toolkit (GLUT) is {{a library}} of {{utilities}} for OpenGL programs, which primarily perform system-level I/O with the host operating system.

Routines for drawing a number of geometric primitives (both in solid and wireframe mode) are also provided, including cubes, spheres and the Utah teapot. GLUT also has some limited support for creating <b>pop-up</b> <b>menus.</b>|$|R
25|$|In 1990 Iwai's {{solo show}} Machine for Trinity {{exhibited}} at the Laforet Museum in Tokyo; some of the works shown there demonstrated that computer graphics could be generated and combined in real-time with live action images. The TV director Shinji Fukuhara visited the exhibition and shortly afterward contracted Iwai to create concepts and a virtual set for a weekly half-hour science news show Einstein TV (Fuji TV, 1990â91). Created on the Amiga, the virtual set included GUI-like <b>pop-up</b> <b>menus.</b>|$|R
50|$|Context menus first {{appeared}} in the Smalltalk environment on the Xerox Alto computer, where they were called <b>pop-up</b> <b>menus.</b> The NEXTSTEP operating system further developed the idea, incorporating a feature whereby the right or middle mouse button brought the main menu (which was vertical and automatically changed depending on context) to the location of the mouse, thereby eliminating the need to move the mouse pointer {{all the way across the}} large (for the time) NextStep screen.|$|R
