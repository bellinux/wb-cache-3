2500|$|Agent's {{station with}} a <b>passing</b> <b>siding</b> and a {{southbound}} spur serving a potato warehouse. [...] The original station was a covered design with doors {{at either end}} to allow the train to pass through; but this was replaced in the early 1900s with a newer design similar to those constructed on the Winslow branch. [...] There was a covered water tank south of the station.|$|E
2500|$|Initial {{equipment}} {{consisted of}} two wood-burning locomotives from Hinkley Locomotive Works and two box cars, fourteen flat cars, and a combination from Laconia Car Company. [...] The main line was promptly extended down a five percent grade to the Monson Slate Company approximately [...] beyond the Monson village depot. [...] A car shed for the combination and a two-stall engine house were built near the depot with a <b>passing</b> <b>siding</b> and a turntable. [...] The turntables were a bit small for the locomotives, although they proved useful when a wedge snowplow arrived a few years later. [...] Monson train crews found it much more convenient to run the locomotive in reverse for six miles than to wrestle it around on the turntables.|$|E
2500|$|This {{station has}} one 12-car-long {{high-level}} side platform, {{north of the}} track. The Port Jefferson Branch has one track at this location. Directly before the station and lasting until the track runs adjacent to Bellrose Avenue School, a <b>passing</b> <b>siding</b> spurs off from the mainline and runs adjacent to it. The switches are maintained by two position light signals next to the switches. Just east of the station is a siding that is well in use, part of [...] Just east of Larkfield Road, the siding turns south and runs parallel to the main. The siding is used on occasion for train meets, where an eastbound and westbound trains to pass. The second track would eliminate this. DUKE interlocking ends at a switch back to the main.|$|E

2500|$|In March 1875, {{the entire}} {{structure}} was strengthened {{and the track}} gauge was set to [...] to carry standard passenger cars, and interchange freight cars. The line was closed down a short time while 200 men changed the wheel sets on the trucks of the rolling stock and relaid (moved) the rails on cross-ties. A <b>passing</b> <b>siding</b> at Franklin Street was also installed. On November 5, 1875, service was extended to 42nd Street at Ninth Avenue, and the Bethune Street station at Greenwich Street was opened. On January 18, 1876, single-track operation was extended to 61st Street, with stations at 50th Street and 55th Street and an incline was installed at 61st Street for equipment delivery. The line was then [...] in length. On April 15, 1877, the first double-track el structure from Morris Street through Battery Park to the South Ferry Terminal station at Whitehall Street was opened.|$|E
2500|$|The {{introduction}} of new coaches allowed for improvements in service on the Dover Plains Branch. The first peak through service since the 1970s was inaugurated in October 1991. At the same time, a Sunday night through train was added. The reduced travel times made the line more attractive to commuters. In 1994, Metro-North conducted a train movement analysis of service on the branch to determine whether trains would pass one another based on speeds and the condition of tracks. As a result, a new [...] <b>passing</b> <b>siding</b> was constructed at Wingdale, increasing service flexibility and allowing for increased service in 1996. Also around this time, 447 additional parking spaces were added to stations on the Branch. In 1996, four car length high-level platforms with heated shelters were built at Patterson, Pawling, Harlem Valley–Wingdale and Dover Plains, replacing low-level platforms that could only accommodate two cars. These platforms were made {{to be compliant with}} the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990. Travel times could be reduced further as it would take less time for passengers to exit and board the trains.|$|E
2500|$|The DL {{was one of}} {{the most}} {{profitable}} corporations in the U.S. when it built the Cut-Off. That profitability declined sharply after World War II, leading to the 1960 merger with the Erie Railroad. DL single-tracked the Cut-Off in 1958 in anticipation of the Erie merger. The westbound track was removed, leaving a [...] <b>passing</b> <b>siding</b> at Greendell and shorter sidings at Port Morris and Slateford. After the merger, most freight traffic shifted to the Erie's mainline through Port Jervis, New York. With the cessation of passenger service in 1970, the Cut-Off became relatively quiet for several years. [...] In 1972, the CNJ abandoned operations in Pennsylvania, causing through freights to be run daily between Elizabeth, New Jersey, and Scranton, using the Cut-Off and the CNJ's High Bridge Branch. (This arrangement with the CNJ would end on April 1, 1976, with the creation of Conrail). [...] As such, when Penn Central closed its Maybrook, New York Yard in 1970, the original reason for using the [...] "Erie side" [...] suddenly no longer existed. [...] As a result, the EL looked to upgrade the [...] "Scranton side", and by 1974 nearly all EL freights had been re-routed to the Scranton Division via the Cut-Off.|$|E

2500|$|The {{remainder}} of the line was built over the next month between Annadale and Pleasant Plains as a single-track line (there was a <b>passing</b> <b>siding</b> at Huguenot), passing through mosquito infested-land laced with peat bogs and quicksand. This area was known by the locals as Skunk's Misery. It {{took a lot of}} time and wood to built the sub-roadbed with logs. It likely wasn't viewed as a worthwhile investment to double track the line due to the low passenger volume south of New Dorp. South of Pleasant Plains, the line continued as a double-tracked line. The line was extended to Annadale on May 14, 1860, and the line was completed to Tottenville on June 2, 1860, with a formal opening of the railroad. The completion of the line to Tottenville allowed passengers to transfer to a ferry, which crossed the Arthur Kill, and allowed passengers to go to Perth Amboy, New Jersey. Initially, service made eleven stops between Vanderbilt's Landing and Tottenville. Many stations were named after nearby large farms, such as Garretson's or Gifford's. There were more elaborate structures put in place at Eltingville and Annadale, as their namesakes, the Eltings and Anna Seguine, were influential in paying for the construction of the rail line. The arrival of the railroad gave dignity to some locations on Staten Island without any of it. [...] "Poverty Hollow" [...] was renamed Rosebank, Heights was added to Oakwood, and various other places were renamed with the coming of the railroad.|$|E
