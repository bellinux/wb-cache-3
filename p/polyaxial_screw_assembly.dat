40|$|AbstractObjectiveIn {{pedicle screw}} fixation, {{the heads of}} {{monoaxial}} screws need to be directed in the same straight line to accommodate the rod placement by backing out during operation, which decreases the insertional torque and internal fixation strength. While <b>polyaxial</b> <b>screws</b> facilitate the <b>assembly</b> of the connecting rod, but its ball-in-cup locking mechanism reduces the static compressive bending yield strength as compared with monoaxial screws. Our study aimed to assess the mechanical performance of a modified pedicle screw. MethodsIn this study, {{the tail of the}} screw body of the modified pedicle screw was designed to be a cylinder-shaped structure that well matched the inner wall of the screw head and the screw head only rotated around the cyclinder. Monoaxial screws, modified <b>screws</b> and <b>polyaxial</b> <b>screws</b> were respectively assembled into 3 groups of vertebrectomy models simulated by ultra high molecular weight polyethylene (UHMWPE) blocks. This model was developed according to a standard for destructive mechanical testing published by the American Society for Testing Materials (ASTM F 1717 – 04). Each screw design had 6 subgroups, including 3 for static tension, load compression and torsion tests, and the rest for dynamic compression tests. In dynamic tests, the cyclic loads were 25 %, 50 %, and 75 % of the compressive bending ultimate loads respectively. Yield load, yield ultimate load, yield stiffness, torsional stiffness, cycles to failure and modes of failure for the 3 types of screws were recorded. The results of modified screws were compared with those of monoaxial and <b>polyaxial</b> <b>screws.</b> ResultsIn static tests, results of bending stiffness, yield load, yield torque and torsional stiffness indicated {{no significant differences between the}} modified and monoaxial screws (P> 0. 05), but both differed significantly from those of <b>polyaxial</b> <b>screws</b> (P< 0. 05). In dynamic compression tests, both modified and monoaxial screws showed failures that occurred at the insertion point of screw body into the UHMWPE block, while the <b>polyaxial</b> <b>screw</b> group showed screw body swung up and down the screw head because of loosening of the ball-in-cup mechanism. ConclusionsThe modified screw is well-designed and biomechanically improved. And it can provide sufficient stability for segment fixation as monoaxial screws...|$|R

30|$|The Goel technique, {{in which}} C 1 – 2 intraarticular spacers are used, may be {{performed}} to restore stability to a disrupted atlantoaxial complex by placing <b>polyaxial</b> <b>screws</b> and plates [22].

We therefore developed a novel, low profile pedicle screw using grooving and blasting treatment that {{is able to}} resist a high compression bending load. Methods: We evaluated the compression bending force to displacement and yield loads for seven different screw head types that differed {{with regard to their}} groove intervals {{and whether or not they}} had been blasted. Results: The rank order of screw types that had the greatest compression bending force to displacement was as follows: (1) universal polyaxial, (2) low polyaxial with 0. 1 mm grooves and blasting, (3) low polyaxial with blasting, (4) low polyaxial with 0. 15 mm grooves and blasting, (5) low polyaxial with 0. 05 mm grooves and blasting, (6) low polyaxial with 0. 05 mm grooves, (7) and low <b>polyaxial.</b> Low <b>polyaxial</b> <b>screws</b> with 0. 1 mm grooves and blasting had the maximum yield load and highest compression bending force to displacement of all seven <b>polyaxial</b> <b>screw</b> head systems evaluated.

40|$|Abstract Background Lumbosacral fusion is a {{relatively}} common procedure that {{is used in the}} management of an unstable spine. The anterior interbody cage has been involved to enhance the stability of a pedicle screw construct used at the lumbosacral junction. Biomechanical differences between polyaxial and monoaxial pedicle screws linked with various rod contours were investigated to analyze the respective effects on overall construct stiffness, cage strain, rod strain, and contact ratios at the vertebra-cage junction. Methods A synthetic model composed of two ultrahigh molecular weight polyethylene blocks was used with four titanium pedicle screws (two in each block) and two rods fixation to build the spinal construct along with an anterior interbody cage support. For each pair of the construct fixed with <b>polyaxial</b> or monoaxial <b>screws,</b> the linked rods were set at four configurations to simulate 0 °, 7 °, 14 °, and 21 ° lordosis on the sagittal plane, and a compressive load of 300 N was applied. Strain gauges were attached to the posterior surface of the cage and to the central area of the left connecting rod. Also, the contact area between the block and the cage was measured using prescale Fuji super low pressure film for compression, flexion, lateral bending and torsion tests. Results Our main findings in the experiments with an anterior interbody cage support are as follows: 1) large segmental lordosis can decrease the stiffness of monoaxial pedicle <b>screws</b> constructs; 2) <b>polyaxial</b> <b>screws</b> rather than monoaxial screws combined with the cage fixation provide higher compression and flexion stiffness in 21 ° segmental lordosis; 3) <b>polyaxial</b> <b>screws</b> enhance the contact surface of the cage in 21 ° segmental lordosis. Conclusion <b>Polyaxial</b> <b>screws</b> system used in conjunction with anterior cage support yields higher contact ratio, compression and flexion stiffness of spinal constructs than monoaxial screws system does in the same model when the spinal segment is set at large lordotic angles. <b>Polyaxial</b> pedicle <b>screw</b> fixation performs nearly equal percentages of vertebra-cage contact among all constructs with different sagittal alignments, therefore enhances the stabilization effect of interbody cages in the lumbosacral area. </p...|$|R
40|$|Background: Use of a {{pedicle screw}} {{at the level}} of fracture, also known as an {{intermediate}} screw, has been shown to improve clinical results in managing lumbar fracture, but there is a paucity of biomechanical studies to support the claim. The aim {{of this study was to}} evaluate the effect of adding intermediate pedicle screws {{at the level of}} a fracture on the stiffness of a short-segment pedicle fixation using monoaxial or <b>polyaxial</b> <b>screws</b> and to compare the strength of monoaxial and <b>polyaxial</b> <b>screws</b> in the calf spine fracture model. Materials and Methods: Flexibility of 12 fresh-frozen calf lumbar spine specimens was evaluated in all planes. An unstable burst fracture model was created at the level of L 3 by the pre-injury and dropped-mass technique. The specimens were randomly divided into monoaxial pedicle <b>screw</b> (MPS) and <b>polyaxial</b> pedicle <b>screw</b> (PPS) groups. Flexibility was retested without and with intermediate screws (MPSi and PPSi) placed at the level of fracture in addition to standard screws placed at L 2 and L 4. Results: The addition of intermediate screws significantly increased the stability of the constructs, as measured by a decreased range of motion (ROM) in flexion, extension, and lateral bending in both MPS and PPS groups (P 0. 05), but there was a significant difference between MPS and PPS in flexion and extension in the short-segment fixation group (P < 0. 05). Conclusions: The addition of intermediate screws at the level of a burst fracture significantly increased the stability of short-segment pedicle screw fixation in both the MPS and PPS groups.

40|$|The orthobiom™ non-fusion {{scoliosis}} correction system {{consists of}} two longitudinal rods, <b>polyaxial</b> pedicle <b>screws,</b> mobile and fixed connectors and a cross-connector.

The {{aim of this study}} was to determine the effects of different features of this novel implant on intervertebral rotations, to calculate the movement of the mobile connectors along the rods for different loading cases and to compare the results with those of a rigid implant construct. A finite element analysis was performed using six versions (M 1 –M 6) of a three-dimensional, nonlinear model of a spine ranging from T 3 to L 2. The models were loaded with pure moments of 7. 5  N m in the three main anatomical planes. First, the validated intact model (M 1) was studied. Then, the orthobiom™ implant system was inserted, bridging the segments between T 4 and L 1 (M 2). The effect of pedicle screws only in every second vertebrae was investigated (M 3). For comparison, three connection variations of screws and rods were investigated: (1) an implant with rigid screws and mobile connectors (M 4), (2) an implant with non-locking <b>polyaxial</b> <b>screws</b> and fixed connectors (M 5) and (3) a completely rigid implant construct (M 6). For flexion, extension and lateral bending, intervertebral rotation was reduced at all implant levels due to the implants. A rigid implant construct (M 6) and an implant with non-locking <b>polyaxial</b> <b>screws</b> and fixed connectors (M 5) led to the strongest reduction of intervertebral rotation. The orthobiom™ non-fusion implant system (M 2, M 3) allowed much more intervertebral rotation than a rigid implant (M 6). Differences in intervertebral rotations were small when <b>polyaxial</b> <b>screws</b> were placed at every second level only (M 3) instead of at every level (M 2). For axial rotation, intervertebral rotation was strongly reduced by a rigid implant construct (M 6) and by an implant with rigid screws and mobile connectors (M 4). For rotation, an implant with non-locking <b>polyaxial</b> <b>screws</b> (M 2, M 3, M 5) led to nearly the same intervertebral rotations as in an intact spine without an implant (M 1). The predicted maximum translation of the mobile connectors along the rod was 4. 2  mm for extension, 3. 1  mm for lateral bending, 1. 6  mm for flexion and 0. 8  mm for axial rotation. The movement of the connectors was highest for those closest to the ends of the rods. With rigid screws, the maximum translation was significantly reduced. This study, conducted under a load-controlled loading protocol, showed that intervertebral rotation was reduced much less by the non-fusion orthobiom™ system than by a rigid implant. The mobile connectors moved considerably along the rod when the spine was bent. It can be expected that the connectors also move along the rod as the adolescent grows, possibly leaving the discs intact until the patient is fully grown...|$|R

40|$|SummaryBackgroundPedicle screw {{constructs}} for spinal instrumentation {{in patients}} with adolescent idiopathic scoliosis (AIS) are effective in providing coronal plane correction but can result in loss of kyphosis, which in turn can lead to loss of lordosis. Hybrid constructs have been found superior over pedicle screw constructs in terms of thoracic kyphosis restoration. In this study, our objective was to compare outcomes with monoaxial versus <b>polyaxial</b> <b>screws</b> in an AIS population treated with hybrid constructs. HypothesisMonoaxial screws provide better correction in the coronal plane but result in loss of thoracic kyphosis, whereas thoracic kyphosis is preserved when <b>polyaxial</b> <b>screws</b> are used. Material and methodsWe retrospectively analysed data from 60  patients (mean age, 15 years) with Lenke 1, 2, or 3 AIS treated using a hybrid construct with self-retaining bilaminar hook claws cranially, pedicle screws between the last instrumented vertebra and T 11 caudally, and sublaminar universal clamps between the two extremities of the construct. Monoaxial screws {{were used in the}} first 30  patients (MS group) and <b>polyaxial</b> <b>screws</b> in the next 30  patients (PS group). Student's t test was performed to compare the two groups in terms of thoracic Cobb angle correction and T 4 -T 12 kyphosis 3 months after surgery. ResultsNo significant preoperative {{differences were found between the}} two groups. At last follow-up, the residual Cobb angle was significantly greater in the PS group than in the MS group (20. 3 ° versus 15 °) with a percentage of correction of 72. 1 % in the MS group versus 64. 8 % in the PS group. In the sagittal plane, the thoracic kyphosis was significantly greater in the PS group than in the MS group (26. 6 ° versus 23 °). DiscussionThis preliminary study shows that, even within a population managed using hybrid constructs, which are associated with less iatrogenic hypokyphosis, differences exist according to the technique used. The importance of sagittal spinal balance has been abundantly documented in the literature, and sagittal malalignment, particularly due to iatrogenic factors, is associated with poorer clinical outcomes in adults with spinal deformities. Therefore, there is a critical need to determine whether the treatment priority is optimal correction in the coronal plane or in the sagittal plane. We believe that the main focus should be sagittal plane correction, even at the expense of a slight decrease in coronal plane correction. Long-term studies are needed to confirm our preliminary findings. Level of evidenceIV, retrospective case-series study...|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVES: No {{studies have}} {{compared}} monoaxial and <b>polyaxial</b> pedicle <b>screws</b> {{with regard to}} the von Mises stress of the instrumentation, intradiscal pressures of the adjacent segment and adjacent segment degeneration. METHODS: Short-segment monoaxial/polyaxial pedicle screw fixation techniques were compared using finite element methods, and the redistributed T 11 -L 1 segment range of motion, largest maximal von Mises stress of the instrumentation, and intradiscal pressures of the adjacent segment under displacement loading were evaluated. Radiographic results of 230 patients with traumatic thoracolumbar fractures treated with these fixations were reviewed, and the sagittal Cobb&# 39;s angle, vertebral body angle, anterior vertebral body height of the fractured vertebrae and adjacent segment degeneration were calculated and evaluated. RESULTS: The largest maximal values of the von Mises stress were 376. 8 MPa for the pedicle screws in the short-segment monoaxial pedicle screw fixation model and 439. 9 MPa for the rods in the intermediate monoaxial pedicle screw fixation model. The maximal intradiscal pressures of the upper adjacent segments were all greater than those of the lower adjacent segments. The maximal intradiscal pressures of the monoaxial pedicle screw fixation model were larger than those in the corresponding segments of the normal model. The radiographic results at the final follow-up evaluation showed that the mean loss of correction of the sagittal Cobb&# 39;s angle, vertebral body angle and anterior vertebral body height were smallest in the intermediate monoaxial pedicle screw fixation group. Adjacent segment degeneration was less likely to be observed in the intermediate <b>polyaxial</b> pedicle <b>screw</b> fixation group but more likely to be observed in the intermediate monoaxial pedicle screw fixation group.

The NCB DF combines conventional plating technique with <b>polyaxial</b> <b>screw</b> placement and angular stability. DESIGN: Prospective cohort study. SETTING: A single level- 1 trauma center. PATIENTS: From May 2003 to December 2005, a total of 24 patients with periprosthetic femur fractures were treated. The NCB DF femur plate was used in all cases. The average follow-up period was 12 months (3 - 31 months). Twelve patients had a periprosthetic fracture after total knee replacement (TKA) and 12 patients after total hip replacement (THA). The mean period from primary joint replacement to periprosthetic fracture was 8. 2 years for the THA group and 7. 2 years for the TKA group. INTERVENTION: A combined conventional/locking surgical technique was performed in all the cases. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Union, non-union, mal-union, duration of surgery, range of motion, postoperative mobility, subjective patient satisfaction and complications. RESULTS: The union rate was 90 %, the mal-union rate 5 % and the re-operation rate 15 %. Postoperative mobility reached the preoperative level in all but for two patients. Three complications occurred relating to the implant or the procedure: one fatigue failure of the plate (non-union), one screw breakage, and one wound infection.

30|$|Another {{issue is}} {{equipment}} and its availability. There {{are now a}} number of different systems available on the market for MIS techniques, but virtually all rely on tubes attached to the pedicle screws to guide and seat the rods allowing reduction into the pedicle screw. These systems all have a disadvantage, because they can only be used with <b>polyaxial</b> <b>screws</b> to allow for pedicle screw angle variation. This is because a tube attached to the screw head magnifies this variation, and polyaxiality is therefore required to align the screws/tubes to allow passage of the rod. This means that with these systems, the pedicle screw itself cannot be used as a vehicle to reduce a fracture or deformity. Our techniques do not have this disadvantage, because we have adapted a system designed for open surgery directly for MIS techniques. The reduction is carried out directly into the screw head {{on the surface of the}} bone, which means that we can use monoaxial or solid screws. When the reduction clamps are applied, this allows the unit to behave like a Schanz pin/screw, thereby permitting strong reliable active correction of the fracture and deformity with the pedicle screw.|$|R
40|$|Introduction. <b>Polyaxial</b> <b>screws</b> {{had been}} only tested {{according}} to the ASTM standards (when they were perpendicularly positioned to the rod). In this study, effects of the pedicle screws angled fixation to the rod on the mechanical properties of fixation were investigated. Materials and Method. 30 vertically fixed screws and 30 screws fixed with angle {{were used in the}} study. Screws were used in three different diameters which were 6. 5 [*]mm, 7. 0 [*]mm, and 7. 5 [*]mm, in equal numbers. Axial pull-out and flexion moment tests were performed. Test results compared with each other using appropriate statistical methods. Results. In pull-out test, vertically fixed screws, in 6. 5 [*]mm and 7. 0 [*]mm diameter, had significantly higher maximum load values than angled fixed screws with the same diameters (P< 0. 01). Additionally, vertically fixed screws, in all diameters, had significantly greater stiffness according to corresponding size fixed with angle (P< 0. 005). Conclusion. Fixing the pedicle screw to the rod with angle significantly decreased the pull-out stiffness in all diameters. Similarly, pedicle screw instrumentation fixed with angle decreased the minimum sagittal angle between the rod and the screw in all diameters for flexion moment test but the differences were not significant...|$|R
40|$|Purpose. Comparison of {{monoaxial}} and <b>polyaxial</b> <b>screws</b> {{with the}} use of subcutaneous anterior pelvic fixation. Methods. Four different groups each having 5 constructs were tested in distraction within the elastic range. Once that was completed, 3 components were tested in torsion within the elastic range, 2 to torsional failure and 3 in distraction until failure. Results. The pedicle screw systems showed higher stiffness (4. 008 ± 0. 113 [*]Nmm monoaxial, 3. 638 ± 0. 108 [*]Nmm Click-x; 3. 634 ± 0. 147 [*]Nmm Pangea) than the exfix system (2. 882 ± 0. 054 [*]Nmm) in distraction. In failure testing, monoaxial pedicle screw system was stronger (360 [*]N) than exfixes (160 [*]N) and polyaxial devices which failed if distracted greater than 4 [*]cm (157 [*]N Click-x or 138 [*]N Pangea). The exfix had higher peak torque and torsional stiffness than all pedicle systems. In torsion, the yield strengths were the same for all constructs. Conclusion. The infix device constructed with polyaxial or monoaxial pedicle screws is stiffer than the 2 pin external fixator in distraction testing. In extreme cases, the use of reinforcement or monoaxial systems which do not fail even at 360 [*]N is a better option. In torsional testing, the 2 pin external fixator is stiffer than the pedicle screw systems...|$|R
50|$|The {{effort to}} {{establish}} an American standard for Ball Screws began in July 1971 out of a need to obtain a consensus opinion relative to proposals for standardization of ball <b>screw</b> <b>assemblies</b> within the ISO/TC39 sub-committee Working Group 7. Out of this, the subcommittee TC43 was organized with members representing manufacturers, users of ball screws, and others of general interest. TC43 produced ANSI B5.48, which was approved as an American National Standard and published in 1977.|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Objective: Locking plates {{have become}} a {{standard}} implant {{in the treatment of}} distal femoral fractures. Newer designs allow <b>polyaxial</b> <b>screw</b> placement as well as the ability to lock the lag screws. Methods: The consecutive multi-centre study cohort consists of all distal femoral fractures treated with the NCB ® Distal Femur plate (Zimmer, Warsaw, USA) and a minimum follow-up of twelve months. Fracture classification according the AO / OTA system and the trauma mechanism radiological evaluation and complications were documented. Clinical evaluation consisted of the Short Form SF 12 questionnaire (SF 12), the Hospital for Special Surgery Score (HSS) and clinical assessment of range of motion. Results: Twenty-five patients with twenty-six fractures were available for follow-up with a minimum required follow-up of twelve months. 81 % of the fractures were intra-articular. 48 % of the patients were multi-traumatised, 38 % having open fractures. All except two went to union (92 %) with the primary procedure. The HSS Score was 79 (32 - 99) and the SF 12 (physical and mental) 40 (19 - 57) and 54 (21 - 66) at follow-up. There were five patients requiring surgical revision (19 %). Conclusion: These fractures are often combined with concomitant injuries. Using modern locked implants high union rates can be achieved with a good function and patient satisfaction when respecting biologic and biomechanical principles...|$|R

50|$|Low {{friction}} in ball screws yields high {{mechanical efficiency}} compared to alternatives. A typical ball screw may be 90 percent efficient, versus 20 to 25 percent efficiency of an Acme lead screw of equal size. Lack of sliding {{friction between the}} nut and screw lends itself to extended lifespan of the <b>screw</b> <b>assembly</b> (especially in no-backlash systems), reducing downtime for maintenance and parts replacement, while also decreasing demand for lubrication. This, combined with their overall performance benefits and reduced power requirements, may offset the initial costs of using ball screws.|$|R
