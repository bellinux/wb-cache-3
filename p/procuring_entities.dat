The study revealed that <b>procuring</b> <b>entities</b> do not conduct market survey for establishing cost estimates, inadequate users cooperation with PMU staff and poor solicitation documents due to inadequate technical specifications, schedule of requirements, and drawings and poor terms and conditions of contract. The weak evaluation critieria and inadequate tender evaluations, and delays in contract awards are hampering efficient procurement process which results to ineffective procurement system. Furthermore weak controls in procurement contracts for payments to delivery of substandard goods or services and delays of due payments to suppliers or contractors and generally poor contract management were noted.

However, an assessment of the benefits of the combinatorial mechanism, based on the observed package discounts, is likely to overstate the true cost savings generated by the mechanism. The option for a firm to submit bids on bundles of contracts gives rise to a strategic effect because a firm’s stand-alone bids compete with its package bids. Therefore, bidders might find it profitable to inflate their stand-alone bids in order to favour their package bids. Using data from first-price procurement auctions of single and multiple contracts, with and without the option to submit package bids, we find that firms inflate their stand alone bids in the combinatorial auctions compared to their corresponding bids in standard first-price procurement auctions.

40|$|When {{government}} entities procure {{goods or}} services, they generally consider and award contracts only to bidders who {{complied with the}} specifications and conditions of tender as laid down in the tender invitation. Tenders received must in other words be conforming, compliant or responsive. This enables <b>procuring</b> <b>entities</b> to compare tenders {{on an equal footing}} and ensures equal treatment amongst bidders. In South Africa the extent to which bidders must comply with tender specifications and conditions is a thorny issue in practice. In 2008 the Supreme Court of Appeal in Millennium Waste Management (Pty) Ltd v Chairperson, Tender Board: Limpopo Province confirmed the views of the courts in South Africa regarding compliance with tender conditions and the amendment of tenders before award. The recent 2013 decision of the Supreme Court of Appeal in Dr JS Moroka Municipality v The Chairperson of the Tender Evaluation Committee of the Dr JS Moroka Municipality, however, has moved public procurement regulation in South Africa to a point where <b>procuring</b> <b>entities</b> have very limited discretionary powers when evaluating compliance with tender specifications and conditions.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{report is}} submitted in partial {{fulfillment of the}} requirements for the degree of Masters in Procurement and Supply Management, 2013. Cataloged from PDF version of thesis report. Includes bibliographical references (page 64). The PPR – 2008, WB guidelines and ADB Guidelines are basically prepared for the proper guidance of the procurement {{at the same time}} it also provide legal support and a restrictive boundary for the parties involved in procurement. This dissertation mainly deals with the comparison of these three guidelines regarding evaluation procedure of the Intellectual and Professional services contract. In the evaluation it covers EOI evaluation, Technical Evaluation, Financial Evaluation and Combined evaluation. It also mainly describes the QCBS method and other methods are not described in detail. This comparison is done by reviewing the three guidelines thoroughly and specific points are taken into account. In ADB Guidelines there is a provision of long listing while EOIs are being evaluated. After that a final short list is prepared. On the contrary in WB guidelines and in PPR – 2008 there is no provision for long listing. In case of ADB the participants must me of ADB member countries and not more than one firm from same country and the total number of the shortlisted firms should six. Similarly WB guidelines also suggest the total number is six but the difference is not more than two firms from the same country. However PPR – 2008 suggests that the number shortlisted firms should not be less than four and at the same time not more than seven. In case of technical evaluation it is mentioned in ADB guidelines that the total score should be 1000 and on the other hand this total score is 100 for WB guidelines and PPR – 2008. There are also some differences in the allocation of points although the calculation procedures of points or scores are same. In case of financial evaluation ADB point out about two things one is maximum contract budget and the other is estimated budget. If GEFP of consultants exceeds maximum contract budget then the financial proposal is not considered for evaluation on the other hand if GEFP exceeds the estimated budget then the proposal is not discarded and taken under consideration. ADB also evaluates financial proposals based on NEEPs. On the contrary WB guidelines and PPR – 2008 evaluate their proposal based on total offered price. The approving authority in ADB funded projects is ADB officials and for WB funded projects are WB officials. In both cases no objection certificate is to be collected by the <b>procuring</b> <b>entity</b> at every step for clearance. In case of PPR – 2008 the approving authority is HOPE or the delegated person depending upon the financial power. It is mentioned in PPR – 2008 that PPR will not be functional when development partners are involved and their guidelines will prevail in that case. And at last it can be said that the maximum guidance in the three guidelines are almost same and there are some minor difference in some specific cases and this similarity eventually helps the <b>procuring</b> <b>entity</b> to be accustomed easily with all the guidelines.

40|$|Summary Europe’s public {{authorities}} are influential consumers. If {{they spend their}} money on greener products and services they can make {{an important contribution to}} the work towards a sustainable development. Green public procurement can thereby significantly improve the take-up of new environmental technologies. Through the effects of economies of scale, production costs be lowered and better equip us to fight environmental problems. The EU’s new Public Procurement Directives of 2004 was implemented in the Swedish legislation in January 2008. The new legislation makes clear that public purchasers can include environmental criteria in their tender documents. The legislation mainly consists of a codification of case law and has not significantly increased the allowance of environmental award criteria. According to practicing procurers the changes in the legal framework however contribute to transparency legality when using environmental criterions. However, major barriers to green public procurement still exist. Because of legal uncertainty and the <b>procuring</b> <b>entities</b> lack of knowledge, environmental criterions are often poorly formulated. The main task of this essay is to describe and analyze to what extent <b>procuring</b> <b>entities</b> may use environmental award criteria. One of the main problems with environmental standards in public procurement is the inconsistency that may rise with fundamental European community principles such as non-discrimination and free movement. The public procurement legal framework is written with a strictly economical approach with aiming to maximize the utility for the procuring entity, and thereby the tax payers. At the same time the legislation aims to increase the competition between potential dealers in the market. Since public funds finances the procurement the idea is that the bid which is that the economically most advantageous bid shall be awarded. However, the doctrine and the legal framework has developed in order to adapt to the increased environmental awareness in society and enable for <b>procuring</b> <b>entities</b> to show environmental considerations. Even though economical liberalism is the foundation of the European Union, environmental protection and consideration must be respected. The ECJ has made clear that {{public authorities}} can use environmental criterions in their public procurement. As long as the criterions are well formulated the procuring great room exists to use environmental award criteria. Especially when the purpose of the award criteria is to reach an environmental goal set up by the union. Because of the lack of a precise procurement framework the courts have the power to decide upon the final limits and allowance of environmental award criteria...|$|E

40|$|This thesis investigates how {{competition}} {{effects in}} government procurement auction {{are affected by}} the risk distribution between the procurer and the winning bidder. The risk distribution is linked to the conditions of payment which is assumed to be largely determined by the procurer. Thus, by investigating whether competition effects are different dependent on the risk distribution, this thesis contributes to the previous literature which almost exclusively model competition effects to be determined exogenous sources of uncertainty and characteristics of the market. There is a previous literature on the effects of various payment conditions in auctions but it mostly considers ex post moral hazard issues, and not effects on the competitive behavior at the bidding stage. An econometric analysis is conducted on auctions of infrastructure construction contracts held by the Swedish Transport Administration between 2010 and 2013. The results suggest that the choice of risk distribution can shift an auction from having no competition effects in bidding to strong bid-reducing competition effects. Seemingly, the procurer appears to face a trade-off between avoiding risk and enjoying bid-reducing competition effects. The difference in competition effects between contracts with fixed and more flexible payment conditions is found to increase with the auctioned project’s expected duration. In terms of government procurement policy, the results suggest that it can be cost-efficient for the <b>procuring</b> <b>entity</b> to share the risk with the contractor in risky projects instead of avoiding risk with fixed price contracts. Whilst this may contradict some common notions regarding government procurement, it is in line with the wide use of flexible payment conditions in private-sector procurement. Arguably, the recent decade’s increased ambitions regarding innovation and sustainability in government procurement adds even further weight to these policy considerations for the risk management of procurers...|$|R
40|$|The {{public sector}} has become {{increasingly}} dependent on information technology (IT) services. However, the tendering process can cause great challenges for both the <b>procuring</b> <b>entity</b> {{as well as the}} IT vendor, since this process is rigidly regulated by law. To ensure success in this process, IT vendors {{need to be able to}} recognize the most crucial steps in the tendering process and to develop best practices for their sales operations. Therefore, the aim of this thesis was to develop a framework for guiding the efforts of vendor sales teams prior to and during the tendering process. The framework was based on Osterwalder’s Business Model Canvas and was constructed using a constructive research approach combined with participant observation, theme interviews and analysis of customers’ tender documents in the public sector. The framework was designed for a specific case company and was taken into use by the case company’s sales teams as a sales tool. The framework identified seven focus areas specific to the case company: the tenderer-customer relationship, evaluation criteria for bids, relevant customer references, pricing strategy, special qualifications required from the vendor, the scope of the procured services and the vendor’s technical solution. One benefit of using this framework is that it enables the vendor to assess their chances of winning the bid, thus avoiding the use of time and money on futile tenders. Furthermore, the framework would allow sales team members not only to more effectively direct their sales efforts, but also to improve internal communication. Future work should focus on validating this framework by training the salesforce in using the framework, more widely implementing it and comparing the benefits gained against those of other tools currently used in the case company...|$|R
40|$|In December 2014, the ESA Council at Ministerial {{level has}} {{decided to go ahead}} with the Ariane 6 and Vega-C {{development}} programmes. The overarching aim of Ariane 6 is to provide guaranteed access to space for Europe at a competitive price. ESA has the role of <b>Procuring</b> <b>entity</b> and Launch System Architect (LSA). As Launch System Architect, ESA ensures the coherence on the Launcher System and the Launch base in the elaboration of the operational concept. The ambitious High Level Requirements of Ariane 6 Project lead to design the Launch System for efficient operations. In this frame, operations are taken “end-to-end”: • From manufacturing until end of Launch Service, • All over the lifecycle of the Launch System, • Encompassing the Launcher System & Launch Base & across the whole Launch System • Including the Launch Service Customer’s / payload The operational concept describes how the Launch System will be operated all over the Ariane 6 lifecycle. This approach leads to drive the Launch System design, development, initial operations and ramp-up up to full operational capability. Given the short development time for Ariane 6 (decision to start development in dec- 2014 for a maiden flight in 2020), it has been decided to follow a concurrent engineering approach between ESA acting as Launch System Architect and the two prime contractors (ASL and CNES) in the elaboration of the Operational Concept. The joint teams iteratively evaluate alternative solutions until convergence on the targeted recurring cost induced by the operational concept. At each step, impact on the Launch Base requirements and their running costs (operations and maintenance) are evaluated. Interface requirements are kept updated and design elements are capitalized to reduce the slack between requirements finalization and preliminary design completion. This process allows the system to freeze in parallel the requirement, the process and product design. The paper presents concurrent engineering methods and tools applied within Ariane 6 project related to the elaboration of the operational concept with the prime contractors.

Cataloged from PDF version of thesis report. Includes bibliographical references (page 45). Sustainable procurement (SP) is procurement {{that is consistent with}} the principles of sustainable development. Sustainable procurement is an approach that takes economic, environmental and social sustainability into account when making any purchasing decision. Public procurement is concerned with how public sector organizations spend tax payers’ money. Public procurement is guided by principles of transparency, accountability, and achieving value for money for citizens and tax payers. Public Works Department (PWD) {{is one of the biggest}} public procuring agencies for government in Bangladesh. The current scenario of sustainable procurement practice in the public sector has been studied through interviews with mid level procurement professionals from Public Works Department (PWD) addressing three aspects of sustainability. The analyses indicate that although there are a few cases where some sustainability issues are in practice, these are not very common as a whole in the public sector. Existing tendering system in public sector in Bangladesh is still based on the lowest price approach and whole life costing approach is rarely considered. Hardly any <b>procuring</b> <b>entity</b> has any provision as such an environmental management system. The study indicates that at present there is virtually no mechanism in our public procurement system to check the environmental performance of contractors/ suppliers. Sustainability criteria should be embedded in the tendering system. Knowledge and awareness at the individual procurement professional level seem important in order to make suitable sustainable procurement choices. The study reveals that the respondents are lacking in such knowledge and they are not trained enough. A clear commitment is necessary from the very top of government and down through the ministries and authorities formulating a sustainable procurement policy and to align the public procurement framework with the policy. Awareness campaign should be arranged focusing on how to take account of nonmonetary benefits of sustainable procurement. Finally, there is scope to further study about the sustainability issues in procurement. Advanced research needs to be conducted in order to get a deeper insight into the sustainability issue in relation to the public procurement. Mohammad Abul Kalam AzadM.
