5|$|The law {{established}} four {{tiers of}} coverage: bronze, silver, gold and platinum. All categories offer the essential health benefits. The categories {{vary in their}} division of <b>premiums</b> <b>and</b> out-of-pocket costs: bronze plans have the lowest monthly <b>premiums</b> <b>and</b> highest out-of-pocket costs, while platinum plans are the reverse. The percentages of health care costs that plans are expected to cover through premiums (as opposed to out-of-pocket costs) are, on average: 60% (bronze), 70% (silver), 80% (gold), and 90% (platinum).|$|E

5|$|In 1971, Nixon {{proposed}} {{health insurance}} reform—a {{private health insurance}} employer mandate, federalization of Medicaid for poor families with dependent minor children, and support for health maintenance organizations (HMOs). A limited HMO bill was enacted in 1973. In 1974, Nixon proposed more comprehensive health insurance reform—a private health insurance employer mandate and replacement of Medicaid by state-run health insurance plans available to all, with income-based <b>premiums</b> <b>and</b> cost sharing.|$|E

5|$|In 2010, the Obama {{administration}} {{passed the}} Affordable Care Act, {{which made the}} most sweeping reforms to the nation's healthcare system in nearly five decades, including mandates, subsidies and insurance exchanges. The law caused {{a significant reduction in}} the number and percentage of people without health insurance, with 24 million covered during 2016, but remains controversial due to its impact on healthcare costs, insurance <b>premiums,</b> <b>and</b> economic performance. Although the recession reached its trough in June 2009, voters remained frustrated with the slow pace of the economic recovery. The Republicans, who stood in opposition to Obama's policies, won control of the House of Representatives with a landslide in 2010 and control of the Senate in 2014.|$|E
5|$|The agency's Small Investment Program aims {{to promote}} FDI into {{specifically}} small and medium enterprises. The program offers standard MIGA coverage types except {{it does not}} cover breaches of contract. Under the program, small and medium enterprises may take advantage of discounted insurance <b>premiums</b> <b>and</b> no application fees, which are not available to larger investors. To qualify an investment for the Small Investment Program, MIGA defines small and medium enterprise projects as having 300 or fewer employees, total assets not to exceed $15million and annual revenues not to exceed $15million. MIGA limits the request amount for the investment guarantee to $10million, and will guarantee only up to 10years with a possible 5-year extension.|$|E
5|$|The {{empirical}} {{rejection of}} the unbiasedness hypothesis is a well-recognized puzzle among finance researchers. Empirical evidence for cointegration between the forward rate and the future spot rate is mixed. Researchers have published papers demonstrating empirical failure of the hypothesis by conducting regression analyses of the realized changes in spot exchange rates on forward <b>premiums</b> <b>and</b> finding negative slope coefficients. These researchers offer numerous rationales for such failure. One rationale centers around the relaxation of risk neutrality, while still assuming rational expectations, such that a foreign exchange risk premium may exist that can account for differences between the forward rate and the future spot rate.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{studies the}} {{connection}} between the capital market and the real estate market. Empirically, we find that positive real house price shocks lower the external finance <b>premium</b> <b>and</b> stimulate nonresidential investment and real GDP. Our theoretical framework is able to mimic the volatility of the external finance premium, the relative price of real estate and capital, and the investment in real estate and capital. It also captures the cyclicality of the external finance <b>premium</b> <b>and</b> of real estate prices. The contribution of real estate price fluctuations to the variability of the external finance <b>premium</b> <b>and</b> the GDP is confirmed to be significant. ...|$|R
5|$|In February 1974, President Nixon {{proposed}} {{more comprehensive}} health insurance reform—an employer mandate to offer {{private health insurance}} if employees volunteered to pay 25 percent of premiums, replacement of Medicaid by state-run health insurance plans available to all with income-based <b>premiums</b> <b>and</b> cost sharing, and replacement of Medicare with a new federal program that eliminated the limit on hospital days, added income-based out-of-pocket limits, and added outpatient prescription drug coverage. In April 1974, Kennedy and Mills introduced a bill for near-universal national health insurance with benefits identical to the expanded Nixon plan—but with mandatory participation by employers and employees through payroll taxes—both plans were criticized by labor, consumer, and senior citizen organizations because of their substantial cost sharing. In August 1974, after Nixon's resignation and President Ford's call for health insurance reform, Mills tried to advance a compromise based on Nixon's plan—but with mandatory participation by employers and employees through premiums to private health insurance companies—but gave up when unable to get more than a 13–12 majority of his committee to support his compromise plan.|$|E
5|$|Bormann took a {{job with}} Der Nationalsozialist, a weekly paper edited by NSDAP member Hans Severus Ziegler, who was deputy Gauleiter (party leader) for Thuringia. After joining the NSDAP in 1927, Bormann began duties as {{regional}} press officer, but his lack of public-speaking skills made him ill-suited to this position. He soon put his organisational skills to use as business manager for the Gau (region). He moved to Munich in October 1928, where {{he worked in the}} SA insurance office. Initially the NSDAP provided coverage through insurance companies for members who were hurt or killed in the frequent violent skirmishes with members of other political parties. As insurance companies were unwilling to pay out claims for such activities, in 1930 Bormann set up the Hilfskasse der NSDAP (NSDAP Auxiliary Fund), a benefits and relief fund directly administered by the party. Each party member was required to pay <b>premiums</b> <b>and</b> might receive compensation for injuries sustained while conducting party business. Payments out of the fund were made solely at Bormann's discretion. He began to gain a reputation as a financial expert, and many party members felt personally indebted to him after receiving benefits from the fund. In addition to its stated purpose, the fund was used as a last-resort source of funding for the NSDAP, which was chronically short of money at the time. After the NSDAP's success in the 1930 general election, where they won 107 seats, party membership grew dramatically. By 1932 the fund was collecting 3 million Reichsmarks per year.|$|E
25|$|In {{determining}} <b>premiums</b> <b>and</b> {{premium rate}} structures, insurers consider quantifiable factors, including location, credit scores, gender, occupation, marital status, and education level. However, {{the use of}} such factors is often considered to be unfair or unlawfully discriminatory, and the reaction against this practice has in some instances led to political disputes {{about the ways in which}} insurers determine <b>premiums</b> <b>and</b> regulatory intervention to limit the factors used.|$|E

25|$|On November 25, 2008, a {{new federal}} rule was passed that allows states to charge <b>premiums</b> <b>and</b> higher co-payments to Medicaid participants. This rule will enable states to take in greater revenues, {{limiting}} financial losses associated with the program. Estimates figure that states will save $1.1 billion while {{the federal government will}} save nearly $1.4 billion. However, this means that the burden of financial responsibility will be placed on 13 million Medicaid recipients who will face a $1.3 billion increase in co-payments over 5 years. The major concern is that this rule will create a disincentive for low-income people to seek healthcare. It is possible that this will force only the sickest participants to pay the increased <b>premiums</b> <b>and</b> it is unclear what long-term effect this will have on the program.|$|E

30|$|Using <b>premium</b> <b>and</b> {{second best}} {{varieties}} sourced {{from the national}} programs of nine rice-growing countries around the world, the first objective {{of this study was}} to determine if there are distinguishable differences in the sensory properties of premium varieties, compared with one from the same country with identical grain quality, as defined by our current suite of tools, but which does not reach the superior classification. The second objective was to determine whether identified differences are common to premium varieties. The third objective was to identify the most important descriptors of sensory quality that distinguished each <b>premium</b> <b>and</b> second best pair and to determine if there was any correlation with traits of quality that are currently measured. <b>Premium</b> <b>and</b> second best varieties were determined by each national rice institute using data on crop growth, persistence of premium varieties, adoption rates of second best varieties, and market prices of each of the <b>premium</b> <b>and</b> second best varieties.|$|R
