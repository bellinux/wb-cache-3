5|$|Portraits of Mary {{show that}} she had a small, oval-shaped head, a long, graceful neck, bright auburn hair, hazel-brown eyes, under heavy lowered eyelids and finely arched brows, smooth <b>pale</b> <b>skin,</b> a high forehead, and regular, firm features. She was {{considered}} a pretty child and later, as a woman, strikingly attractive. At some point in her infancy or childhood, she caught smallpox, but it did not mark her features.|$|E
5|$|For example, in {{the common}} {{cuttlefish}} the display consists of flattening the body, making the skin pale, showing a pair of eyespots on the mantle, dark eye rings, and a dark line on the fins, and dilating the pupils of the eyes. The common octopus similarly displays <b>pale</b> <b>skin</b> and dark eye rings with dilated pupils, but also curls its arms and stretches out the web between the arms as far as possible, and squirts out jets of water. Other octopuses such as Atlantic white-spotted octopus turn bright brownish red with oval white spots all over in a high contrast display. The paper nautilus can rapidly change its appearance: it suddenly withdraws the shining iridescent web formed by its first pair of arms from its shell.|$|E
5|$|Raised in Cabra, Dublin, {{he began}} his career at Home Farm, before {{spending}} two years with Glentoran from 1965 to 1967.

He was sold to English First Division club Stoke City in March 1967 for a fee of £15,000, and went to on to help Stoke to win the League Cup in 1972. In total he spent 12 years with Stoke, scoring 67 goals in 333 league and cup appearances. He was a popular figure with Stoke fans due to his creative flair and dribbling ability, as well as his distinctive <b>pale</b> <b>skin,</b> bright ginger hair and sideburns.|$|E

They are voiced by Russ Abbott.|$|R
5|$|The Smiths {{saw the man}} {{at around}} 22:00 on Rua da Escola Primária, 500 yards (457 m) from the McCanns' apartment, {{walking away from the}} Ocean Club and toward Rua 25 de Abril and the beach. He was {{carrying}} a girl aged 3–4 years. She had blonde hair and <b>pale</b> <b>skin,</b> was wearing light-coloured pyjamas, and had bare feet. The man was mid-30s, 5ft 7in–5ft 9in (1.75–1.80 m), slim-to-normal build, with short brown hair, wearing cream or beige trousers. He did not look like a tourist, according to the Smiths, and had seemed uncomfortable carrying the child. E-fits based on the Smiths testimony were first created in 2008 by Oakley International, private investigators hired by the McCanns, and were publicized in 2013 by Scotland Yard on Crimewatch.|$|E
25|$|Other {{signs and}} {{symptoms}} include feeling tired, dizziness, and <b>pale</b> <b>skin</b> color.|$|E

50|$|Mattel's Barbie doll, which {{appeared}} in March 1959, was based on Bild Lilli dolls that co-founder Ruth Handler had acquired in Hamburg. Barbie was made of softer plastic, wore less makeup, had <b>paler</b> <b>skin,</b> and the doll had rooted hair and non-moulded shoes and earrings—apart from {{that she was a}} lookalike of Lilli.|$|R
5000|$|Boum-Boum: A <b>pale</b> <b>skinned,</b> bald {{character}} who wears boxing gloves. Enjoys {{screaming at the}} audience and walking away proudly, but will run away if an audience member screams back. He is aggressive and physically fit, yet extremely lifeless. It is as though his body lives on only because his soul refuses to leave it.|$|R
5000|$|Glam, as {{her name}} implies, is the fashionista of the group. She has the <b>palest</b> <b>skin</b> of the Dolls in the line. The first edition [...] "Glam" [...] had {{changeable}} hot pink and blue wigs, {{and wore a}} reversible zebra-print mini skirt, (a possible reason for {{the addition of the}} molded panties later) and silver platform boots.|$|R

25|$|Originally, <b>pale</b> <b>skin</b> was {{considered}} most attractive. However, tanned skin became increasingly popular after Coco Chanel showed off a tan after a holiday – it suggested {{a life of}} leisure, without the onerous need to work. Women wanted to look fit, sporty, and, above all, healthy.|$|E

50|$|These {{versions}} add peculiar {{incidents that}} {{add to the}} grisliness of the crime. Lamkin and the nursemaid collect the baby's blood in a basin which, along {{with the idea that}} the name Lamkin or Lammikin indicates the murderer was <b>pale</b> <b>skinned</b> and, therefore, perhaps a leper who sought to cure himself by bathing in the blood of an innocent collected in a silver bowl, a medieval cure.|$|R
25|$|After he regains {{his body}} in the fourth book, Rowling {{describes}} Voldemort as having <b>pale</b> <b>skin,</b> a chalk-white, skull-like face, snake-like slits for nostrils, red eyes and cat-like slits for pupils, a skeletally thin body and long, thin hands with unnaturally long fingers. As mentioned in {{the first chapter of}} the seventh book, he also has no hair or lips. Earlier in life, as seen through flashbacks contained in the second and sixth books, Tom Marvolo Riddle was handsome and tall with <b>pale</b> <b>skin,</b> jet black hair, and dark brown eyes. He could charm many people with his looks. The transformation into his monstrous state {{is believed to have been}} the result of creating his Horcruxes and becoming less human as he continued to divide his soul. In the films, Voldemort's eyes are blue with round pupils.|$|E
25|$|The {{preferred}} {{skin tone}} varies by culture and has varied over time. A number of indigenous African groups, {{such as the}} Maasai, associated <b>pale</b> <b>skin</b> with being cursed or caused by evil spirits associated with witchcraft. They would abandon their children born with conditions such as albinism and showed a sexual preference for darker skin.|$|E
25|$|The Others {{resurface}} at {{the beginning}} of A Game of Thrones after the War for the Dawn, which led to the construction of the Wall. They appear as tall, gaunt, graceful humanoids with glowing blue eyes and <b>pale</b> <b>skin.</b> They wear armor that shifts in color with every step, and wield thin crystal swords capable of shattering steel.|$|E
50|$|Vineans are of <b>pale</b> blue <b>skin,</b> but {{otherwise}} very closely resemble humans. No reasons are given in-universe for this extreme similarity of two species that evolved {{millions of years}} (and two galaxies) apart, and neither is this matter ever raised in the novels. However, it is understood throughout the series that Vineans cannot sunburn because their <b>pale</b> blue <b>skin</b> is more resilient than that of humans.|$|R
5000|$|The sun - {{symbol of}} the great wealth of nature within the poverty of man, was a primary social force in this Germany. Thousands of people went to the open-air {{swimming}} baths or {{lay down on the}} shores of the rivers and lakes, almost nude, and sometimes quite nude, and the boys who had turned the deepest mahogany walked amongst those people with <b>paler</b> <b>skins</b> like kings among their courtiers.|$|R

25|$|Thalassemias are {{inherited}} {{blood disorders}} characterized by abnormal hemoglobin production. Symptoms {{depend on the}} type and can vary from none to severe. Often there is mild to severe anemia (low red blood cells). Anemia can result in feeling tired and <b>pale</b> <b>skin.</b> There may also be bone problems, an enlarged spleen, yellowish skin, dark urine, and among children slow growth.|$|E
25|$|Dances which parody Europeans, {{especially}} rich hacienda owners, {{are most}} commonly performed for Carnival. One {{of the most}} widespread {{of these is the}} Chinelos, danced in the State of Morelos. In Tlaxcala, for the Dance of the Catrines (Dandies), performers wear masks with <b>pale</b> <b>skin</b> tones, and hold up umbrellas as a petition for rain. Wearing top hats and coats, they also make fun of wealthy landowners.|$|E
25|$|B12 {{deficiency}} {{is often}} associated with pernicious anemia, as it is the most common cause. Pernicious anemia results from an autoimmune disorder which destroys the cells that produce intrinsic factor within the stomach lining, thereby hindering B12 absorption. B12 absorption is important for the subsequent absorption of iron, thus, people with pernicious anemia often present with typical symptoms of anemia, such as <b>pale</b> <b>skin,</b> dizziness, and fatigue.|$|E

25|$|Pee-wee Herman's {{signature}} gray glen plaid {{suit was}} originally a custom-made suit that Reubens had {{borrowed from the}} Groundlings director, Gary Austin; the small red bow tie was {{given to him by}} an acquaintance. Pee-wee's later checkered clothing and persona were largely lifted from manic 1950s children's TV host Pinky Lee. Also incorporated into the look were short black hair, <b>pale</b> <b>skin</b> with red rouge and red lipstick.|$|E
25|$|He met {{the first}} serious love of his life, Russian poet Anna Akhmatova, in 1910, when he was 26. They had studios in the same building, and {{although}} 21-year-old Anna was recently married, they began an affair. Anna was tall (as Modigliani was only 5 foot 5inches) with dark hair (like Modigliani's), <b>pale</b> <b>skin</b> and grey-green eyes, she embodied Modigliani's aesthetic ideal and the pair became engrossed in each other. After a year, however, Anna returned to her husband.|$|E
25|$|Like Muscat of Hamburg, Muscat Ottonel is a {{relatively}} recent addition to the Muscat family, being bred in the Loire Valley wine region of France in the 1850s. The grape is a cross of the Swiss wine grape Chasselas and Muscat d'Eisenstadt (also known as Muscat de Saumur). Of {{all of the major}} Muscat varieties, Muscat Ottonel has the most <b>pale</b> <b>skin</b> color, and tends to produce the most neutral wines and is also the grape variety that ripens the earliest.|$|E
50|$|His {{appearance}} {{presented a}} strong {{contrast to his}} ‘intramural enemy’ Robert Liston (1794-1847), F.R.C.S. (Edinburgh, 1818), F.R.S. (1841), the University College’s Professor of Clinical Surgery, {{one of the fastest}} surgeons of all time (on one occasion Liston amputated a leg, mid-thigh, in 25 seconds), who was <b>pale</b> <b>skinned,</b> and at least 6 ft 2in (188 cm) tall. Liston was fiercely opposed to Elliotson’s ‘contamination’ of the hospital with his demonstrations of ‘higher states’ of mesmerism (i.e., rather than its ‘medical’ applications).|$|R
5000|$|Zachary Gray [...] - [...] Extremely {{affluent}} but directionless, Zachary vacillates {{between his}} desires for redemption and self-destruction, {{especially in this}} book, his second appearance, where he half-heartedly attempts suicide as the story opens. He is described as being, [...] "gorgeous", <b>pale</b> <b>skinned,</b> and with [...] "velvety black" [...] hair. He {{appears to have a}} heart condition. Charming, exciting, unpredictable and emotionally needy, Zach brings out both the best and worst in Vicky, and eventually deserts her in a moment of crisis.|$|R
50|$|Underside Creamy-white, {{sometimes}} with grey mottling along lower jaw on throat and on hind part of abdomen. Thighs and groin often <b>pale</b> yellow. <b>Skin</b> smooth.|$|R
