5|$|The understrength Turkish {{battalion}} {{entrusted with}} its defence doggedly held out with great courage {{and in so}} doing fulfilled its obligation. They held up two English cavalry divisions for six hours and had <b>prevented</b> <b>them</b> <b>from</b> expanding their outflanking manoeuvres around the Beersheba-Hebron road.|$|E

5|$|Lawyers for The Progressive voluntarily {{underwent}} {{security reviews}} and were granted Q clearances {{that allowed them}} to access restricted nuclear information. Morland and The Progressives editors declined to obtain clearances, as {{they would have had to}} sign non-disclosure agreements that would have <b>prevented</b> <b>them</b> <b>from</b> publishing the article. This resulted in the lawyers being restricted in their communications with their clients.|$|E
50|$|Respondents {{were also}} asked to {{identify}} specific groups of people whose attitudes <b>prevent</b> <b>them</b> <b>from</b> participating in society as much as they would like to. The majority of respondents (83%) said that no one <b>prevents</b> <b>them</b> <b>from</b> participating fully in society. The most common group identified by respondents as <b>preventing</b> <b>them</b> <b>from</b> taking part in society was strangers (as identified by 9% of respondents) followed by acquaintances/work colleagues/classmates/neighbours/people in the community (5%) and then immediate family (4%).|$|R

5|$|Much of {{the area}} around the lake remains undeveloped and empty. Original plans {{included}} large recreation areas on both the eastern and western end of the lake complete with golf courses, campgrounds, swimming lakes, water parks and other amenities. The MWD still plans on building the additional recreation facilities, but lack of funding and lack of support from developers has <b>prevented</b> <b>them</b> <b>from</b> doing so.|$|E
5|$|October 20, 1639 – Two Spanish ships {{ground out}} in a hurricane; the {{occupants}} are brought ashore, and charged monthly accommodation fees until their departure the following February.

5|$|The North Koreans, in the meantime, were {{suffering}} serious logistics problems which <b>prevented</b> <b>them</b> <b>from</b> supplying their troops effectively with ammunition, food, and medical care. At the same time, {{elements of the}} division, including thousands of people forcibly conscripted from South Korea, were becoming increasingly hard to keep in place. The division was having difficulty strengthening its position at Haman.|$|E
5|$|The {{following}} year Scotland, again inspired by Baxter and Law, beat England 1–0, and only poor finishing <b>prevented</b> <b>them</b> <b>from</b> scoring a bigger win. In 1966, sixteen {{months after his}} leg had been broken, Baxter {{was not able to}} inspire his teammates, and Scotland lost 4–3 to England.|$|E
5|$|With an 8–1 conference record, the Sooners {{once again}} won {{a share of}} the Big 12 Championship; however, their loss to the Kansas State Wildcats <b>prevented</b> <b>them</b> <b>from</b> {{reaching}} the 2013 Fiesta Bowl spot. In addition, the non-AQ Northern Illinois Huskies completed the qualifications to go to the 2013 Orange Bowl, leaving the Sooners out of the Bowl Championship Series (BCS).|$|E

5|$|Despite this surrender, leaving Dawes {{standing}} awkwardly holding seven swords, {{the fighting}} continued for minutes more and numerous Confederates {{were able to}} escape back to Herr Ridge. The three Union regiments lost 390440 of 1,184 engaged, but they had blunted Davis's attack, <b>prevented</b> <b>them</b> <b>from</b> striking {{the rear of the}} Iron Brigade, and so overwhelmed the Confederate brigade that it was unable to participate significantly in combat {{for the rest of the}} day. The Confederate losses were about 500 killed and wounded and over 200 prisoners out of 1,707 engaged.|$|E
5|$|During {{the initial}} {{development}} {{stages of the}} film, Pixar revisited their work from the original Toy Story and found that, although they could open the old computer files for the animated 3D models, error messages <b>prevented</b> <b>them</b> <b>from</b> editing the files. This necessitated recreating the models from scratch. To create the chaotic and complex junkyard scene near the film's end, {{more than a year}} and a half was invested on research and development to create the simulation systems required for the sequence.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the success}} of Cauldron, Palace {{employee}} Steve Brown began work on a sequel. To provide fans of the original title with a new experience, a very different gameplay was implemented for the sequel, although several minor features retained connections to the first. Inspired by the bouncing pumpkin character in Cauldron, Brown designed the game around the character's movement. The bouncing mechanic proved problematic for the programmers who were unable to perfect its implementation. Technical limitations also <b>prevented</b> <b>them</b> <b>from</b> implementing certain animations, such as turning pages of a book.|$|E

5|$|The Nino Bixio {{class was}} a pair of {{protected}} cruisers built for the Italian Regia Marina (Royal Navy) in the 1910s. The two ships, , and , were built in Castellammare between 1911 and 1914. They were intended to serve as scouts for the main Italian fleet, and as such required a high top speed. They were overweight as built, which <b>prevented</b> <b>them</b> <b>from</b> reaching their intended maximum speed. They were a disappointment in service, especially compared to the earlierand fastercruiser , which cut their careers short.|$|E
5|$|The Royal Navy {{launched}} the Operation Goodwood series in late August. Goodwood I {{took place on}} 22 August, with 38 bombers and 43 fighters from five carriers. The attackers failed to score any hits. Goodwood III followed two days later, with 48 bombers and 29 fighters from , Furious, and Indefatigable. The bombers made two hits on the ship, which did only minor damage. The last Royal Navy operation, Goodwood IV, followed on 29 August. Thirty-four bombers and 25 fighters, launched from Formidable and Indefatigable, attacked the ship, though fog <b>prevented</b> <b>them</b> <b>from</b> scoring any hits.|$|E
5|$|The Vietnamese {{attempted}} {{to reclaim the}} citadel by sending reinforcements. Vĩnh Long and Mỹ Tho sent 1,800 and 800 troops respectively, but French shelling <b>prevented</b> <b>them</b> <b>from</b> reaching the scene. This left the 5,800-strong local self-defence militia to combat the French. These militia engaged in ambushing French patrols near the citadel, as well as evacuating local inhabitants, {{in order to create}} an open space close to their target. The local militia were supported by wealthy southern landowners, who supplied them with food and resources.|$|E

Since Ireland possessed such a court, the English Divisional Court could not act. Hastings attempted to argue that the writ could be issued against the Home Secretary but this also failed, since the Home Secretary did not actually possess O'Brien.|$|E
5|$|The {{next major}} Japanese {{reinforcement}} effort failed during the Naval Battle of Guadalcanal, undertaken as Shōji and his troops struggled to reach friendly lines near the Matanikau. Although most of Shōji's troops had escaped from Koli Point, {{the inability of}} the Japanese to keep their forces on Guadalcanal adequately supplied or reinforced <b>prevented</b> <b>them</b> <b>from</b> contributing effectively to {{what turned out to be}} Japan's ultimately unsuccessful effort to hold the island or retake Henderson Field from Allied forces.|$|E
