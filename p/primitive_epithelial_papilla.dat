40|$|BACKGROUND—The {{response}} of the oesophagus to refluxed gastric contents is likely to depend on intact neural mechanisms in the oesophageal mucosa. The epithelial innervation has not been systematically evaluated in health or reflux disease.  AIMS—To study oesophageal epithelial innervation in controls, and also inflamed and non-inflamed mucosa in patients with reflux oesophagitis and healed oesophagitis.  PATIENTS—Ten controls, nine patients with reflux oesophagitis, and five patients with healed oesophagitis.  METHODS—Oesophageal epithelial biopsy specimens were obtained at endoscopy. The distribution of the neuronal marker protein gene product 9. 5 (PGP), and the neuropeptides calcitonin gene related peptide (CGRP), neuropeptide Y (NPY), substance P (SP), and vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) were investigated by immunohistochemistry. Density of innervation was assessed by the proportion of papillae in each oesophageal epithelial biopsy specimen containing immunoreactive fibres (found in the subepithelium and <b>epithelial</b> <b>papillae,</b> but not penetrating the epithelium).  RESULTS—The proportion of papillae positive for PGP immunoreactive nerve fibres was significantly increased in inflamed tissue when compared with controls, and non-inflamed and healed tissue. There was also {{a significant increase in}} VIP immunoreactive fibres within <b>epithelial</b> <b>papillae.</b> Other neuropeptides showed no proportional changes in inflammation.  CONCLUSIONS—Epithelial biopsy specimens can be used to assess innervation in the oesophagus. The innervation of the oesophageal mucosa is not altered in non-inflamed tissue of patients with oesophagitis but alters in response to inflammation, where there is a selective increase (about three- to fourfold) in VIP containing nerves. ...|$|R

40|$|Human palatine tonsils are oropharyngeal lymphoid tissues {{containing}} multiple invaginations (crypts) {{in which}} {{the continuity of the}} outer surface epithelium is disrupted and the isolated epithelial cells intermingle with other cell types. We now show that <b>primitive</b> <b>epithelial</b> cells detectable in vitro in 2 D colony assays and in a 3 D culture system are CD 44 +NGFR+ and present in both surface and crypt regions. Transcriptome analysis indicated a high similarity between CD 44 +NGFR+ cells in both regions, although those isolated from the crypt contained a higher proportion of the most primitive (holo) clonogenic cells. Lentiviral transduction of CD 44 +NGFR+ cells from both regions with human papillomavirus 16 -encoded E 6 /E 7 prolonged their growth in 2 D cultures and caused aberrant differentiation in 3 D cultures. Our findings therefore reveal a shared, site-independent, hierarchical organization, differentiation potential, and transcriptional profile of normal human tonsillar epithelial progenitor cells. They also introduce a new model for investigating the mechanisms of their transformation...|$|R

Surgical specimens of vaginal tissue (n = 10) from pre- and postmenopausal women were fixed and processed for immunohistochemistry of peptides and NOS and for histochemistry of NADPH-diaphorase. SP-immunoreactive nerves were very sparse, being absent from 9 of the 10 tissue samples. For other peptides and NOS, the innervation of the deep arteries and veins was greater than that of blood vessels in the propria. Capillaries in the <b>epithelial</b> <b>papillae</b> also appeared to be innervated by nerves containing NOS, CGRP, NPY and VIP. Beneath the epithelium nerve fibres formed a subepithelial plexus; no nerve cell bodies were seen. The relative density of innervation by immunoreactive fibres was PGP- 9. 5 > NPY > VIP >> NOS > CGRP > SP. These results imply that nerves that utilise nitric oxide or NPY, VIP or CGRP as a neurotransmitter {{may play a role in}} controlling blood flow and capillary permeability in the human vagina. The origin and function of all these nerves is discussed...|$|R

Clumps of protodifferentiated cells were frequently seen in the epithelium {{as well as in the}} subepithelial regions of the deficient oviduct, whereas they were less frequent in the normal controls. Mitosis could not be detected in the vitamin A-deficient magnum, whereas it was frequently encountered in the control birds. The luminal side of the epithelium as well as the secretions of the oviduct into the lumen showed very strong PAS- and alcian blue-pos. reactions in the deficient tissue, whereas these reactions were very faint in the normal controls.

40|$|The {{diagnosis}} {{and the treatment}} of the ovarian tumors grading don’t present always significant correlations with the surviving chance. From this reason, the authors have proposed to study the proliferative activity in the main types of <b>primitive</b> <b>epithelial</b> tumors of the ovary (benign, borderline and malign) by computerized quantitative methods and to establish the significance of the quantified parameters in establishing the degree of tumor risk. It was used an interactive video digital quantitative program estimating the proliferative activity by stereological methods. The results were processed statistically and it was appreciated the degree of correlation with the tumor evolution. In the studied types of ovarian epithelial tumors, the proliferative activity represents an expressive indicator in establishing the malignancy degree. The comparative study of all types of EOT was allowed to establish some reference values for assessment of risk degree. The increase of mitotic activity index over 8 mitosis / 10 hpf represents a criterion of high-risk in borderline EOT, and over 30 mitosis / 10 hpf attests doubtlessly the malignancy. The index of the mitotic activity is a method which can be used in the routine examination of the epithelial tumors of the ovary, firstly because is significant, but and rapid and easy to apply...|$|R

In this study, we have investigated the interaction between intestinal mesenchymal and epithelial cells at the cellular level in vitro. Fetal rat intestinal epithelial cell colonies explanted in vitro on the 15 th day of gestation, which failed to mature in plain monocultures, were reassociated in coculture with three different types of mesenchyme:fetal skin, gastric and intestinal mesenchyme. Only fetal epithelial cells cocultured with intestinal (homologous) mesenchyme acquired definite signs of differentiation within three to six days. These <b>primitive</b> <b>epithelial</b> cells were shown by electronmicroscopy to become highly polarized, connected by tight junctions and covered with a regular brush border. Three brush border enzymes were strongly expressed in homologous cocultures and their activity was sensitive to dexamethasone.

Compensatory growth (CG) is utilised worldwide in beef production systems as a management approach to reduce feed costs. However the underlying biology regulating {{the expression of}} CG remains to be fully elucidated. The objective {{of this study was}} to examine the effect of dietary restriction and subsequent re-alimentation induced CG on the global gene expression profile of ruminal <b>epithelial</b> <b>papillae.</b> Holstein Friesian bulls (n = 60) were assigned to one of two groups: restricted feed allowance (RES; n = 30) for 125 days (Period 1) followed by ad libitum access to feed for 55 days (Period 2) or (ii) ad libitum access to feed throughout (ADLIB; n = 30). At the end of each period, 15 animals from each treatment were slaughtered and rumen papillae harvested. mRNA was isolated from all papillae samples collected. cDNA libraries were then prepared and sequenced. Resultant reads were subsequently analysed bioinformatically and differentially expressed genes (DEGs) are defined as having a Benjamini-Hochberg P value of < 0. 05. During re-alimentation in Period 2, RES animals displayed CG, growing at 1. 8 times the rate of their ADLIB contemporary animals in Period 2 (P < 0. 001). At the end of Period 1, 64 DEGs were identified between RES and ADLIB, with only one DEG identified at the end of Period 2. When analysed within RES treatment (RES, Period 2 v Period 1), 411 DEGs were evident. Genes identified as differentially expressed in response to both dietary restriction and subsequent CG included those involved in processes such as cellular interactions and transport, protein folding and gene expression, as well as immune response. This study provides an insight into the molecular mechanisms underlying the expression of CG in rumen papillae of cattle; however the results suggest that the role of the ruminal epithelium in supporting overall animal CG may have declined by day 55 of re-alimentation...|$|R
40|$|Malignant rhabdoid tumours of {{the kidney}} are rare {{childhood}} neoplasms. Extra-renal rhabdoid tumours {{are known to}} have a distinctive biological behaviour and do not always occur in the paediatric age group. As the histogenesis of rhabdoid tumours, and their apparent relationship to nephroblastoma is still unclear, careful assessment of new cases is required. This investigation illustrates diverse ultrastructural, light microscopic and immunohistochemical findings. These features are related {{to each other and to}} the biological behaviour of renal rhabdoid tumours, and six extra-renal lesions with rhabdoid features obtained from the Pathology Archives of the Red Cross Children's Hospital and Groote Schuur Hospital. In this series <b>primitive</b> <b>epithelial</b> elements are a dominant feature, but ultrastructural features of one renal rumour suggest diverse differentiation. The extra-renal lesions investigated include three undifferentiated rhabdoid lesions, a primitive neuro-ectodermal tumour, a malignant epithelioid Schwannoma and a possible undifferentiated hepatocellular carcinoma; all showing areas of extensive rhabdoid differentiation. Pseudo-rhabdoid cells in an additional two cases were also examined. These particular tumours were a nephroblastoma and a fibro-lamellar carcinoma of the liver. These rhabdoid tumour mimics were ultrastructurally different from true rhabdoid cells. Strong immunohistochemical co-expression of Vimentin and cytokeratin in rhabdoid tumour cell inclusions has been noted by previous investigators. (Vogel, 1984) (Gansler, 1991), (Berry, 1992). We speculate that the predominant line of differentiation in renal rhabdoid tumours is epithelial although, as in nephroblastoma multiple lines of differentiation may occur. The extra-renal lesions appear to represent more than one entity, but once again epithelial or neuro-epithelial differentiation appears to be present. Ultrastructural examination is a more useful investigation than immunohistochemistry because of inherent non-specific uptake of antibodies by the filamentous cytoplasmic inclusions...|$|R
40|$|The thymus is a bilobed {{lymphoid organ}} the {{morphology}} of which varies considerably with age {{as a result}} of a process of fatty infiltration occurring after puberty. Although several diseases can arise in the thymic parenchyma, including germ cell and neuroendocrine tumours, <b>primitive</b> <b>epithelial</b> neoplasms (thymomas) are the most common neoplasms and account for almost 10 % of mediastinal masses. Thymomas are usually benign but can be locally invasive. Up to 30 % of patients with a thymoma have myasthenia gravis, which is more commonly associated with thymic hyperplasia. The latter results in a symmetric diffuse enlargement of the thymus. However, thymic hyperplasia can be histologically found in up to 50 % of normal-sized thymuses on computed tomography (CT). CT is much more accurate in detecting thymomas than it is in detecting thymic hyperplasia, although CT findings may be unspecific. CT can be exhaustive in the case of an encapsulated thymoma (65 % of all thymomas), which appear as a solid homogeneous mass with a slight contrast enhancement and a well-defined surrounding fat plane. These tumours rarely recur after surgery. CT can also accurately detect a spread through the capsule into the adjacent mediastinal fat, which characterizes invasive thymomas (35 %). These, however, are best evaluated by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). On T 1 -weighted MR scans the thymus is well delineated against the mediastinal fat, whereas marked inhomogeneity of the signal may appear on T 2 -weighted images {{as a result of}} areas of cystic degeneration in the tumour mass. The superior contrast resolution of MRI and the multiplanar images that can be produced with it are well suited for documenting the mediastinal spread of invasive thymomas. MRI depicts accurately pleural and/or pericardial implants as well as the involvement of great vessels, offering considerable aid in the planning of surgery...|$|R
40|$|At {{hatching}} the gut of sole Solea solea was a <b>primitive</b> <b>epithelial</b> tube {{which showed}} vigorous cellular proliferation but only initial regionalization, and no secretory cells. By contrast, {{at this stage}} lateral muscle already consisted of a clearly distinct superficial monolayer of parvalbumin-negative fibres, and a deeper layer of parvalbumin-positive (presumptive fastwhite) fibres. There were no very small-diameter fibres present and very few proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) -positive nuclei, indicating that new fibres were not being produced at this time. The gut consisted of a distinct pharynx, oesophagus, stomach and intestine by 12 days, further differentiation of the anterior and posterior intestine was seen at 21 days, and morphological differentiation was complete at 2. 5 months. Goblet cells containing acidic glycoconjugates were present at 12 days in the pharynx, oesophagus and anterior intestine, and increased in number at later ages. Neutral glycoconjugates first appeared in absorptive (not goblet) cells at 21 days. From 2. 5 months neutral glycoconjugates were found in secretory cells throughout {{all parts of the}} gut except the stomach and the oesophagus, and by the adult stage the neutral glycoconjugates were the predominant type in the intestinal goblet cells. The difference in parvalbumin expression between the superficial (negative) and deep (positive) muscle layers seen at hatching persisted at all ages, and from 21 days immunostaining for slow isoforms of myosin gave a positive reaction in the superficial monolayer and subsequent slow muscle layer. Hypertrophic growth continued up to the largest subject examined, by posthatching myogenesis occurred in two distinct and relatively brief phases. The distribution of very small diameter muscle fibres and PCNA-positive nuclei indicated that muscle hyperplasia occurred initially in apical areas of the myotomes (at 12 and 21 days), but this was followed (at 2. 5 months) by a second ‘mosaic’ phase of myogenesis as new fibres appeared scattered throughout the deep muscle layer.

However, wildtype and N-cadherin null ES cells intermixed and did not segregate, a situation that {{may be explained by}} Albert Harris' modified principle, which incorporates the unique properties of living cells. Furthermore, in chimeric embryoid bodies composed of N-cadherin and E-cadherin null ES cells, the two weakly interacting cell types segregated but did not envelop one another. Lastly, the most consistent and striking observation was that differentiated cells sorted to the surface and formed an enveloping layer, regardless of the relative cell adhesive affinity of any cell combination, supporting the hypothesis that the ability of the differentiated cells to establish apical polarity is the determining factor in surface sorting and positioning...|$|R

These ovarian tumours comprise 7.5 – 15 % of all epithelial ovarian neoplasms. It is important to separate them from the invasive tumours because of their superior prognosis. The overall 5 -year survival rate for patients with borderline tumours is 86.2 %, compared with 46.1 % in patients with invasive disease [2]. Survival for patients with stage I borderline neoplasms is 99 %, while survival for advanced-stage disease without invasive implants is 92 % [3]. Frank malignant transformation appears to occur in less than 1 % of borderline tumours [3]. This rate is similar to the rate quoted for the malignant transformation of fibroids (0.2 – 0.7 %), and the latter are not even considered tumours with low malignant potential (LMP).

We show that, although {{the variation in}} the percentages of expressed genes did not exceed 14 % among the primary human hepatocyte populations, huge interindividual differences in the transcript levels of many genes were observed. These genes were related to various functions; in addition to drug metabolism, they mainly concerned carbohydrate, amino acid, and lipid metabolism.

The embryonic vasculature is essential in regulating endochondral ossification; however, its role during intramembranous ossification remains poorly understood, and in vivo studies are lacking. Previous research from our lab {{on the development of}} the intramembranous scleral ossicles has demonstrated an intriguing pattern of vascular development in which the areas of future osteogenesis remain avascular until after bone induction has occurred. Such avascular zones are located directly beneath each of the conjunctival <b>papillae,</b> <b>epithelial</b> structures which provide osteogenic signals to the underlying mesenchyme. Here we provide a high-resolution map of the developing vasculature from the time of ossicle induction to mineralization using a novel technique. We show that vegfa is expressed by the papillae and nearby mesenchymal tissue throughout HH 34 – 37, when vascular growth is taking place, and is down-regulated thereafter. Localized inhibition of Vegf results in expansion of the avascular zone surrounding the implanted papilla and mispatterning of the scleral ossicles.

Co-grafting of human keratinocytes derived from neonatal foreskins with murine DPE produced hair follicle-like structures consisting of multiple epidermal cell layers with a well-keratinized innermost region. Those structures expressed hair follicle-specific markers including hair keratin, and markers expressed during developmental stages. However, the lack of regular hair structures indicates abnormal folliculogenesis. Similar hair follicle-like structures were also generated with cultured human keratinocytes after the first passage, or with keratinocytes derived from adult foreskins, demonstrating that epidermal cells even at a mature stage can differentiate in response to inductive signals from DP cells.

Moreover, the number of mast cells, major histocompatibility complex class II+, or CD 11 b+ immunocytes in the skin mesenchyme was increased, and essentially no subcutis developed. Therefore, in contrast to their epidermal counterparts, pilosebaceous unit stem cells depend on a functional ETC.

Furthermore, metastasis of this tumor is ex-tremely rare in rats. The incidence of nephroblastoma has been reported to be around 0. 1 % or less. Nephroblastoma occurs in both male and female rats and is considered to rep-resent malignant neoplasms 1 – 6. It is known that nephroblas-toma has been induced chemically in rats by direct-actin...|$|R
40|$|Salivary gland cystadenomas are cystic {{neoplasms}} {{with diverse}} architecture and cytology. Cystadenomas {{may have a}} considerable intracystic epithelial component, but an epithelial proliferation in small ducts and cysts resembling atypical ductal hyperplasia of breast has not been documented. The patient was a 68 -year-old man with a slow growing right submandibular mass. He has no recurrence 13  months after resection. The tumor was polycystic and measured 3. 0  ×  2. 5  ×  2. 5  cm. The epithelium of the larger cysts was composed of flat, cuboidal, columnar, and apocrine-like cells. Many of the larger cysts showed “Roman bridges”, <b>epithelial</b> tufting, and <b>papillae.</b> The smaller cysts and ducts had apocrine-like cells forming secondary glandular lumens. The ductal cells were surrounded by clear myoepithelial cells. Nuclear pleomorphism and hyperchromasia {{was seen in the}} apocrine-like cells. Adjacent to the larger cysts, there was an adenomatoid proliferation of small ducts surrounded by myoepithelial cells. No mitotic activity, necrosis, or stromal invasion was identified. The ductal cells were diffusely positive for keratin 7 and androgen receptors with focal expression of keratin 19 and high-molecular weight keratin. S- 100, estrogen and progesterone receptors, and BRST- 2 were negative in the ductal cells. Recognition of a prominent intraductal epithelial component in cystadenomas is important to avoid a misdiagnosis of cystadenocarcinoma or low-grade salivary duct carcinoma. Cystadenomas join the list of salivary gland lesions with microscopic similarities to primary lesions of the breast...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Nicotinic {{acetylcholine}} receptors (nAChRs) are ligand-gated ion channels {{comprised of}} five similar subunits that influence signal transduction and cell turnover. α 5 is a structural subunit detected in many non-neuronal tissues; however, its function during pulmonary development is unknown. Results α 5 {{was assessed by}} immunohistochemistry and RT-PCR in mouse lungs from embryonic day (E) 13. 5 to post-natal day (PN) 20. From E 13. 5 to E 18. 5, α 5 expression was primarily observed in <b>primitive</b> airway <b>epithelial</b> cells while mesenchymal expression was faint and sporadic. α 5 expression was detected throughout the proximal lung at PN 1 and extensively expressed in the peripheral lung at PN 4, {{an early stage of}} murine alveologenesis. An interesting shift occurred wherein α 5 expression was almost undetectable in the proximal lung from PN 4 -PN 10, but significant localization was again observed at PN 20. Transcriptional control of α 5 was determined by assessing the activity of reporters containing 2. 0 -kb and 850 -bp of the mouse α 5 promoter. Because perinatal expression of α 5 was abundant in bronchiolar and alveolar epithelium, we assessed transcriptional control of α 5 in Beas 2 B cells, a human bronchiolar epithelial cell line, and A- 549 cells, an alveolar type II cell-like human epithelial cell line. Thyroid Transcription Factor- 1 (TTF- 1), a key transcription regulator of pulmonary morphogenesis, significantly increased α 5 transcription by acting on both the 2. 0 -kb and 850 -bp α 5 promoters. Site-directed mutagenesis revealed that TTF- 1 activated α 5 transcription by binding specific TTF- 1 response elements. Exogenous TTF- 1 also significantly induced α 5 transcription. Conclusions These data demonstrate that α 5 is specifically controlled in a temporal and spatial manner during pulmonary morphogenesis. Ongoing research may demonstrate that precise regulation of α 5 is important during normal organogenesis and misexpression correlates with tobacco related lung disease. </p...|$|R
40|$|Anterior-posterior (A-P) axis {{specification}} requires signalling from a specialised extraembryonic tissue {{called the}} anterior visceral endoderm (AVE). AVE precursors are induced at the distal {{tip of the}} pre-gastrulating mammalian embryo {{and move to the}} prospective anterior. This movement is essential in correctly positioning the A-P axis. Firstly, the contribution of proliferation to AVE movements has been tested. Previous studies have suggested that differential proliferation within the visceral endoderm (VE) is required to determine its direction by passive displacement. High-resolution imaging and embryo culture experiments have been used to assess the distribution and requirements of proliferation during AVE movements. Differential proliferation was not observed along the A-P axis of the VE. However, proliferation within the epiblast was found to be required for correct AVE movements in a Nodal-dependant manner. Secondly, to address the function of the AVE in vivo, this tissue was genetically ablated. Diphtheria toxin A was knocked-in to the Hex locus (an early AVE marker) by homologous recombination in embryonic stem cells. Depending on the time of ablation the AVE or its precursors could be ablated as demonstrated by AVE marker analysis. Ablation of the AVE precursors prior to 5. 5 dpc resulted in embryos that displayed greatly disturbed patterning and were unable to gastrulate. AVE ablation between 5. 5 - 6. 5 dpc resulted in delayed formation of the <b>primitive</b> streak, <b>epithelial</b> to mesenchymal transition defects and a mispatterning of the anterior primitive streak. A decrease in Nodal signalling was found to be a likely cause for the defects observed in these ablated embryos, indicating that AVE maintains Nodal signalling levels in the epiblast. Together these experiments find a role for epiblast proliferation in AVE migration and identify a novel role for the AVE in patterning the primitive streak. Therefore this investigation provides a critical insight into how the A-P axis is established in mammals. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceMedical Research CouncilGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R
40|$|For homeostasis, lingual taste papilla organs require {{regulation}} of epithelial cell survival and renewal, with sustained innervation and stromal interactions. To investigate {{a role for}} Hedgehog/GLI signaling in adult taste organs we used a panel of conditional mouse models to manipulate GLI activity within epithelial cells of the fungiform and circumvallate papillae. Hedgehog signaling suppression rapidly led to taste bud loss, papilla disruption, and decreased proliferation in domains of papilla epithelium that contribute to taste cells. Hedgehog responding cells were eliminated from the epithelium but retained in the papilla stromal core. Despite papilla disruption and loss of taste buds that are {{a major source of}} Hedgehog ligand, innervation to taste papillae was maintained, and not misdirected, even after prolonged GLI blockade. Further, vimentin-positive fibroblasts remained in the papilla core. However, retained innervation and stromal cells were not sufficient to maintain taste bud cells in the context of compromised epithelial Hedgehog signaling. Importantly taste organ disruption after GLI blockade was reversible in papillae that retained some taste bud cell remnants where reactivation of Hedgehog signaling led to regeneration of papilla epithelium and taste buds. Therefore, taste bud progenitors were either retained during epithelial GLI blockade or readily repopulated during recovery, and were poised to regenerate taste buds once Hedgehog signaling was restored, with innervation and papilla connective tissue elements in place. Our data argue that Hedgehog signaling is essential for adult tongue tissue maintenance and that taste <b>papilla</b> <b>epithelial</b> cells represent the key targets for physiologic Hedgehog-dependent {{regulation of}} taste organ homeostasis. Because disruption of GLI transcriptional activity in taste papilla epithelium is sufficient to drive taste organ loss, similar to pharmacologic Hedgehog pathway inhibition, the findings suggest that taste alterations in cancer patients using systemic Hedgehog pathway inhibitors result principally from interruption of signaling activity in taste papillae...|$|R
40|$|As {{an injury}} heals, an embryo develops, or a {{carcinoma}} spreads, epithelial cells systematically change their shape. In {{each of these}} processes cell shape is studied extensively, whereas variation of shape from cell-to-cell is dismissed most often as biological noise. But where do cell shape and variation of cell shape come from? Here we report that cell shape and shape variation are mutually constrained through a relationship that is purely geometrical. That relationship is shown to govern maturation of the pseudostratified bronchial epithelial layer cultured from both non-asthmatic and asthmatic donors as well as formation of the ventral furrow in the epithelial monolayer of the Drosophila embryo in vivo. Across these and other vastly different epithelial systems, cell shape variation collapses to a family of distributions that is common to all and potentially universal. That distribution, in turn, is accounted for quantitatively by a mechanistic theory of cell-cell interaction showing that cell shape becomes progressively less elongated and less variable as the layer becomes progressively more jammed. These findings thus uncover a connection between jamming and geometry that is generic -spanning jammed living and inert systems alike- and demonstrate that proximity of the cell layer to the jammed state is the principal determinant of the most <b>primitive</b> features of <b>epithelial</b> cell shape and shape variation.

40|$|Summary A {{paucity of}} {{information}} {{exists on the}} regulation of gene expression in the undifferentiated intestine. The intestinal epithelium {{is one of the}} few normal tissues expressing the multidrug resistance (MDR) genes that confer the multidrug resistant phenotype to a variety of tumours. Expression of mdr 1 a has been observed in the <b>primitive</b> rat intestinal <b>epithelial</b> cell line, IEC- 18. It is hypothesized that characterization of MDR gene expression in IEC- 18 cells will provide insight into gene regulation in undifferentiated intestinal cells. A series of hamster mdr 1 a promoter deletion constructs was studied in IEC- 18 and a region with 12 – 13 -fold enhancer activity was identified. This region was shown to function in an orientation- and promoter context-independent manner, specifically in IEC- 18 cells. Unexpectedly, Northern probing revealed a greater expression of mdr 1 b than mdr 1 a in IEC- 18 cells. A quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction assay was used to compare the relative expression of MDR genes in IEC cells, fetal intestine, and in the undifferentiated and differentiated components of adult intestinal epithelium. MDR transcript levels in IEC cells were found to resemble those of fetal intestine and small intestinal crypts, where a conversion from mixed mdr 1 a/mdr 1 b to predominantly mdr 1 a expression occurs as cells mature. This work describes two contributions to the field of gene regulation in the undifferentiated intestine – first, the initial characterization of a putative mdr 1 a enhancer region with specificity for primitive intestinal cells and secondly, the first report of mdr 1 b detection in the intestine and its expression in primitive cell types...|$|R
