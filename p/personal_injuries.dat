500|$|Denning {{gave the}} leading {{judgment}} in Letang v Cooper [...] 2 All ER 929 in 1964. EWCA Civ 5 (15 June 1964) |publisher=BAILII|accessdate=6 May 2009}} Mrs Letang, on holiday in Cornwall, decided {{to lie down}} and rest in grass outside a hotel. Cooper drove into the hotel car park and, not seeing Letang, ran over her legs. More than {{three years after the}} events, Letang brought a tort case against Cooper, claiming damages for her injuries. The standard tort for <b>personal</b> <b>injuries</b> is that of negligence, which has a three-year statute of limitations, and Letang instead claimed damages under the tort of Trespass to the Person. In his judgment, Denning stated that the tort of Trespass could only be used if the injury was inflicted intentionally; if it was unintentionally, only negligence could be used.|$|E
500|$|Although some {{perceive}} the settlement as {{an admission of}} guilt, the settlement agreement specifically stated that Jackson admitted no wrongdoing and no liability and legally, a settlement cannot be used as evidence of guilt in future civil and criminal cases. The settlement payment was [...] "for alleged <b>personal</b> <b>injuries</b> arising out of claims of negligence and not for claims of intentional or wrong acts of sexual molestation." [...] In the settlement, both parties agreed they would not speak about the case details in public {{but it did not}} prevent the Chandlers from testifying in a criminal trial or sharing information with authorities in a criminal investigation. The settlement document adamantly states there is no admission of wrongdoing on Jackson's part and no admission of molestation or immodesty and that under no circumstances shall any payment be withheld from the complainants, even if they were to testify against Jackson.|$|E
500|$|Private {{nuisance}} {{was defined}} in Bamford v Turnley, where George Wilshere, 1st Baron Bramwell defined it as [...] "any continuous activity or {{state of affairs}} causing a substantial and unreasonable interference with a [...] land or his use or enjoyment of that land". Private nuisance, unlike public nuisance, is only a tort, and damages for <b>personal</b> <b>injuries</b> are not recoverable. Only {{those who have a}} legal interest in the affected land can sue; an exception was made in Khorasandjian v Bush, where the Court of Appeal held that a woman living in her mother's house was entitled to an injunction to prevent telephone harassment despite having no legal interest in the property. In Hunter v Canary Wharf Ltd, however, the House of Lords rejected this development, arguing that to remove the need for an interest in the affected property would transform the tort of nuisance from a tort to land into a tort to the person. The liable party under private nuisance is the creator, even if he is no longer in occupation of the land or created a nuisance on somebody else's land. In Sedleigh-Denfield v O'Callaghan, it was held that the defendant was liable for a nuisance (a set of water pipes) even though he had not created it, because he had used the pipes and thereby [...] "adopted" [...] the nuisance.|$|E

500|$|Public {{nuisance}} concerns {{protecting the}} public, unlike private nuisance, which protects an individual. As such {{it is not}} only a tort but also a crime. In Attorney-General v PYA Quarries Ltd, it was defined by Romer LJ as any act or omission [...] "which materially affects the reasonable comfort and convenience of life of a class of Her Majesty's subjects". Because of the wide definition given, there are a large range of issues which can be dealt with through public nuisance, including picketing on a road, as in Thomas v NUM, blocking a canal, as in Rose v Miles, or disrupting traffic by queuing in a road, as in Lyons v Gulliver. A significant difference between private and public nuisance is that under public, one can claim for <b>personal</b> <b>injuries</b> as well as damage to property. Another difference is that public nuisance is primarily a crime; it only becomes a tort if the claimant can prove that they suffered [...] "special damage" [...] over and above the effects on the other affected people in the [...] "class". The test for the required size of a [...] "class" [...] was also discussed in Attorney-General v PYA Quarries Ltd, with the court concluding that the test was whether the nuisance was [...] "so widespread in its range or so indiscriminate in its effect {{that it would not be}} reasonable to expect one person to take proceedings on his own responsibility to put a stop to it, but that it should be taken on the responsibility of the community at large".|$|E

2500|$|Priestley v Fowler [...] {{is an old}} English {{tort law}} case, which [...] {{introduced}} the old rule of common employment (or [...] "fellow servant rule" [...] in the United States).

The rule was removed in its entirety in the United Kingdom by the Law Reform (<b>Personal</b> <b>Injuries)</b> Act 1948.|$|E
2500|$|While in the UK, {{this rule}} is {{strictly}} [...] "a remedy for damage to land or interests in land" [...] and [...] "damages for <b>personal</b> <b>injuries</b> are not recoverable under the rule", in India, {{the courts have}} developed this rule into a separate area of absolute liability rule, where an enterprise is absolutely liable, without exceptions, to compensate everyone affected by any accident resulting from the operation of hazardous activity. This differs greatly from the UK approach as it includes all kinds of resulting liability other than damage to land.|$|E
2500|$|There is {{evidence}} {{that much of the}} code was taken from pre-existing customary practice transmitted orally.

Likewise, the section on <b>personal</b> <b>injuries,</b> which contains most of the code's provisions, begins with hair {{at the top of the}} body and ends with the toenail.

2500|$|The {{ruling in}} the Corby toxic waste case, {{delivered}} in July 2009, found Corby Borough Council liable in negligence, public nuisance and {{a breach of}} statutory duty for its reclamation of a steel works and the resulting atmospheric contamination. The case against the council cited: [...] "The Defendant's urban land reclamation programme and the presence of poisonous waste presented a significant risk to health. The poisonous waste was ultra hazardous and various sites contained substantial quantities of contaminated waste and toxic materials that were likely to cause <b>personal</b> <b>injuries</b> to persons in the surrounding area in the event of their escape." [...] While recognising that there was insufficient epidemiological data to establish whether the victims' injuries arose from a [...] "common cause", or from airborne contamination or from the reclamation works, the judge ruled that there was a [...] "statistically significant cluster" [...] of birth defects in Corby which needed [...] "explanation other than chance": it was not the court's purpose to establish whether the victims were individually exposed to contaminants from the reclamation, rather to determine whether any relevant breach of duty had the ability to cause injuries of the type complained of. The judge also ruled that it was [...] "reasonably foreseeable that the local population might be exposed to hazardous or contaminated substances" [...] {{as a result of the}} council's clean-up programme.|$|E
