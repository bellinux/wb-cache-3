5|$|Choctaw dyers use maple (Acer sp.) for a grey dye. Navajo weavers create black from mineral {{yellow ochre}} mixed with pitch from the <b>piñon</b> tree(Pinus edulis) and the three-leaved sumac (Rhus trilobata). They also produce a cool grey dye with blue flower lupine {{and a warm}} grey from Juniper {{mistletoe}} (Phoradendron juniperinum).|$|E
5|$|Mesa Verdeans {{supplemented}} {{their diet}} by gathering {{the seeds and}} fruits of wild plants, searching large expanses of land while procuring these resources. Depending on the season, they collected <b>piñon</b> nuts and juniper berries, weedy goosefoot, pigweed, purslane, tomatillo, tansy mustard, globe mallow, sunflower seeds, and yucca, as well as various species of grass and cacti. Prickly pear fruits provided a rare source of natural sugar. Wild seeds were cooked and ground up into porridge. They used sagebrush and mountain mahogany, along with <b>piñon</b> and juniper, for firewood. They also smoked wild tobacco. Because the Ancestral Puebloans considered all material consumed and discarded by their communities as sacred, their midden piles were viewed with reverence. Starting during the Basketmaker III period, , Mesa Verdeans often buried their dead in these mounds.|$|E

5|$|<b>Pinon</b> and Ron Perlman {{were cast}} by Alien: Resurrection {{director}} Jean-Pierre Jeunet {{largely due to}} the director's practice of casting recurring collaborators in unconventional, marginal roles. In Deleuze and Film: A Feminist Introduction, Teresa Rizzo explores Alien: Resurrection hybridization theme; the dynamic between Vriess and his wheelchair share a synergy of flesh and prosthetic with Number 8 and her Alien composition.|$|E
5|$|By {{the middle}} of the century, the palette had {{expanded}} to include red, black, green, yellow, and gray which signifies different aspects of the earth as defined by different locations of the reservation. Navajo used indigo to obtain shades from pale blue to near black and mixed it with indigenous yellow dyes such as the rabbit brush plant to obtain bright green effects. Red was the most difficult dye to obtain locally. Early Navajo textiles use cochineal, an extract from a Mesoamerican beetle, which often made a circuitous trade route through Spain and England {{on its way to the}} Navajo. Reds used in Navajo weaving tended to be raveled from imported textiles. The Navajo obtained black dye through <b>piñon</b> pitch and ashes.|$|E

5|$|Chacoan flora typifies that of North American high deserts: {{sagebrush}} {{and several}} species of cactus are interspersed with dry scrub forests of <b>piñon</b> and juniper, the latter primarily on the mesa tops. The canyon is far drier than other parts of New Mexico located at similar latitudes and elevations, and it lacks the temperate coniferous forests plentiful to the east. The prevailing sparseness of plants and wildlife was echoed in ancient times, when overpopulation, expanding cultivation, overhunting, habitat destruction, and drought may have led the Chacoans to strip the canyon of wild plants and game. It {{has been suggested that}} even during wet periods the canyon was able to sustain only 2,000 people.|$|E

50|$|Experts {{say that}} Strawberry Crater is {{relatively}} young {{compared to other}} craters in the United States. It was formed from volcanic eruptions around 800 and 1604 B.C. There were several volcanic periods, during which multi-colored rocks were deposited on Earth's surface. Nine-hundred-year-old Sinagua ruins in the vicinity include evidence of gardens that used volcanic cinders as a water-retaining mulch. There are many different paths leading to the crater, but {{there is only one}} trail that is marked. Surrounding the crater, there are rolling cinder-strewn hills with a variety of different plants from <b>pinons</b> to junipers.|$|R
60|$|Sierra Blanca is the prodigious triple-turreted tower {{which stands}} at the {{southern}} elbow of the Sangre de Cristo range. It is a massive but symmetrical mountain, with three peaks so nearly of the same altitude that the central dome seems the lowest of them all, though it is actually fourteen thousand four hundred and eighty feet above the sea. On the west and south this great mass rises from the flat, dry floor of the San Luis Valley in sweeping, curving lines, and the <b>piñons</b> cover these lower slopes like a robe of bronze green.|$|R
50|$|Loghill is {{primarily}} covered in large Ponderosa Pine trees, <b>piñons</b> and junipers. Wildlife is abundant on the Mesa {{with a fairly}} large population of Mule Deer, Elk, Bobcats, Lynxes, Black Bears (of various colors), wild turkeys and an occasional siting of mountain lions. Almost 1,000 feet higher than Ridgway, the types and sizes of flora vary greatly. For example, Aspen trees are seen here and there on the mesa, {{as opposed to the}} lower Ridgway valley where they are scarce. Aspens can be seen more abundantly in the foothills and mid mountain areas of the San Juan Mountains and Cimarrons.|$|R
25|$|The ground down to {{the forests}} of <b>Pinon</b> and Rosay, which covered most of the uneven plain south of the marshes around the Ailette, {{comprised}} numerous ravines which in places were still wooded. The sides of the ravines wound around, facing all directions {{and could not be}} swept from end to end by artillery-fire. On the western flank, the Vauxaillon valley ran along most of the western and eastern slopes of the ridge and plateau above Laffaux. The Mont des Singes Spur was to its east and the Vauxaillon valley, which narrowed to the Allemant ravine, went round and then northwards, joining a ravine which curved round the Allemant plateau west of <b>Pinon.</b> The Allemant plateau was cut from south to north by the narrow St. Guillain ravine and other ravines lay below the crest of the Chemin-des-Dames ridge. From Vaudesson a ravine descended northwards to the west of Chavignon, where it met the western of two gullies, at the head of which was Malmaison Farm; Fort de la Malmaison was on the plateau above the eastern gully. The plateau was separated from the Filain and Pargny-Filain area on the east of the French attack front, by a valley into which the eastern or Bois de la Garenne gully opened, just south of Chavignon.|$|E
25|$|In 1978, he {{completed}} his examinations at the Escola Tècnica Superior d'Arquitectura (ETSAB) in Barcelona. From 1973 to 1978 {{he worked in}} the architect's office of Albert Viaplana and Helio <b>Piñón.</b> Whilst there—among other things—he was involved {{in the construction of the}} Plaça dels Països Catalans, the forecourt for the Estació de Sants. In 1984 after several architectural competition awards, he formed his own office in Barcelona with his first wife Carme Pinós, which they led together until 1991. Within the rising Spanish architecture scene of the late 1980s following the death of Francisco Franco, their unusual buildings attracted international attention. As a result, they received numerous commissions from Spain and overseas. After their separation, Miralles and Pinós continued to work in separate offices.|$|E
25|$|By her own account, {{she was not}} {{initially}} {{a supporter of the}} French Revolution; her uncle was a firm, if discreet, royalist, and she feared her best friend, a drummer-boy in the Swiss Guard, had been killed during the overthrow of the monarchy, when the National Guard stormed the Tuileries Palace. She joined the counter-revolutionary Federalist uprising in 1793, in a unit of volunteer artillery led by her uncle, now a captain. Captured by the forces of the Republican government, she was encouraged to change sides, and on 9 July 1793, the nineteen-year-old girl enlisted as a cavalry trooper in the Légion des Allobroges under Colonel <b>Pinon.</b> Quickly earning the nickname le petit Sans-Gêne, she saw her first real battle in the siege of Toulon, where she was wounded for the first time, and first met Napoleon, then a young artillery commander.|$|E
60|$|Passing rapidly {{through the}} two villages, Two Horns {{turned to the}} left and entered upon a road which climbed diagonally up the side of a long, low ridge. This {{involved}} plodding, {{and by the time they}} reached the summit the sun met them full-fronted. In the smaller valley, which lay between this ridge and the foot-hills, a rough trail led towards the mountains. This way Two Horns took, driving rapidly and silently, and soon entered the pines and <b>pinons</b> which form the lower fringe of the vast and splendid robe of green which covers the middle heights of the Rocky Mountains.|$|R
60|$|At eight {{thousand}} {{feet above the}} sea these suave lines become broken. The <b>piñons</b> give place to pine and fir, and the somber cañons begin to yawn. It was just here, where the grassy hills began to break into savage walls, that Bidwell made his camp beside a small stream which fell away into Bear Creek to the south. From this camp he could look far out on the violet and gold of the valley, and see the railway trains pass like swift and monstrous dragons. He could dimly see the lights of Las Animas also, and this led him to conceal his own camp-fire.|$|R
60|$|No dust or heat next morning! The desert floor {{appeared}} {{clean and}} damp, with fresh gray sage and shining bunches of cedar. We {{climbed into the}} high cedars, {{and then to the}} <b>piñons,</b> and then to the junipers and pines. Climbing so out of desert to forestland was a gradual and accumulating joy to me. What contrast in vegetation, in air, in color! Still the forest consisted of small trees. Not until next day did we climb farther to the deepening, darkening forest, and at last to the silver spruce. That camp, the fifth night out, was beside a lake of surface water, where we had our first big camp-fire.|$|R
25|$|On {{the left}} of XIV Corps, the 28th Division quickly {{defeated}} the Germans in Moisy Farm and the Laffaux Mill {{at the tip of}} the salient; then took the intermediate trenches and pillboxes on the summit of Laffaux ridge. A defensive flank was established from Moisy Farm across the plateau, to prevent a counter-attack from the Mont des Singes. On the right flank, from Laffaux Mill to Mennejean Farm, the 27th Division and XXI Corps to the east of the farm, attacked the southern face of the salient. Mennejean Farm and the first line trenches fell quickly and Fruty Quarry was surrounded by battalions of the 75th Regiment.. The French infantry reached the edge of the Laffaux–Pinon ravine, at the junction with the Allemant ravine, which ran downwards to the west of <b>Pinon.</b> The 28th Division arrived almost simultaneously at the western edge of the Allemant ravine, which forced many German soldiers back into both hollows with many casualties.|$|E
25|$|The {{flanking}} {{divisions of}} XXI Corps were then to descend {{on the final}} objectives, Vaudesson village, Bois de la Belle Croix, Montparnasse Quarry, {{the west end of}} Chavignon village and the Bois des Hoinets, a northern continuation of Bois de la Belle Croix. If successful, the centre of the Sixth Army would be in a salient but west of Vaudesson a deep ravine from north of Laffaux Mill to the east of <b>Pinon,</b> commanded from the west by the 27th Division in Giraffe Trench, would protect the left flank of XXI Corps from counter-attacks. On the right flank, in the XI Corps area, the 38th Division would co-operate with the 43rd Division on the right of XXI Corps, to capture the Bohery Quarry, Fort de la Malmaison, Orme Farm on the plateau {{to the north of the}} fort, Bois de la Garenne in the ravine to the west, Many Farm east of the Pargny-Filain–Chavignon road, due east of Garenne Wood and the east end of Chavignon village. With the 43rd Division, it was to secure the north end of the Malmaison Plateau, the slopes and the ravines descending from it to Chavignon.|$|E

60|$|Camp {{that evening}} {{was in a}} valley with stately pines straggling down to the level. On the other slope the pines came down in groups. The rim of this {{opposite}} slope was high, rugged, iron-colored, with cracks and holes. Before supper I walked up the slope back of our camp, to come upon level, rocky ground for a mile, then pines again leading to a low, green mountain with lighter patches of aspen. The level, open strip was gray in color. Arizona color and Arizona country! Gray of sage, rocks, pines, cedars, <b>piñons,</b> heights and depths and plains, wild and open and lonely--that was Arizona.|$|R
50|$|The Tübatulabal's {{traditional}} homelands {{extended over}} 1300 square miles including the Kern and South Fork Kern Rivers drainages (located in the Kern Valley area of California) extending from very high mountainous terrain {{in the north}} to about 41 miles below the junction of the two rivers in the south. The high mountains in the north (2,500 to 14,500 feet) are interspersed with lakes and meadows. The southern area (2,500 to 3,000 feet) has three connected valleys: Kern Valley, South Fork Kern Valley, and Hot Springs Valley, where summers are hot and winters cold and rainy. The valleys are grasslands and chaparral with cacti, scrub oaks, willows, elderberry, and cottonwoods as primary vegetation with some joshua trees, junipers, <b>piñons,</b> oaks, and sugar pines.|$|R
6000|$|After {{leaving the}} Grande River the road winds up a pretty high divide before {{plunging}} down into Ute Park, {{as they call}} all that region lying between the Continental Range on {{the east and the}} Bear Tooth plateau on the west. It was a big spread of land, and very far from an Eastern man's conception of a park. From Dome Peak it seems a plain; but, in fact, when clouds shut off the high summits to the west, this [...] "valley" [...] becomes a veritable mountain land, a tumbled, lonely country, over which an occasional horseman crawls, a minute but persistent insect. It is, to be exact, a succession of ridges and ravines, sculptured (in some far-off, post-glacial time) by floods of water, covered now, rather sparsely, with <b>pinons,</b> cedars, and aspens, a dry, forbidding, but majestic landscape.|$|R

It can also be located along woodland edges, <b>piñon,</b> dry desert bushland and areas within its region where cacti are present. [...] If there is an adequate amount of desert vegetation near human habitation, along with feeders, the curve-billed can adapt within these environments.|$|E
500|$|Many {{artifacts}} from Mesa Verde are now located in museums and private collections in the USA {{and across the}} world. A representative selection of pottery vessels and other objects, for example, {{is now in the}} British Museum in London. In 1906, President Theodore Roosevelt approved creation of the Mesa Verde National Park and the Federal Antiquities Act of 1906. The park was an effort to [...] "preserve the works of man" [...] and was the first park created to protect a location of cultural significance. The park was named with the Spanish term for green table because of its forests of juniper and <b>piñon</b> trees.|$|E
500|$|Chaco Canyon {{lies within}} the San Juan Basin, atop the vast Colorado Plateau, {{surrounded}} by the Chuska Mountains to the west, the San Juan Mountains to the north, and the San Pedro Mountains to the east. Ancient Chacoans drew upon dense forests of oak, <b>piñon,</b> ponderosa pine, and juniper to obtain timber and other resources. The canyon itself, located within lowlands circumscribed by dune fields, ridges, and mountains, is aligned along a roughly northwest-to-southeast axis and is rimmed by flat massifs known as mesas. Large gaps between the southwestern cliff faces—side canyons known as rincons—were critical in funneling rain-bearing storms into the canyon and boosting local precipitation levels.

She won a César Award for Most Promising Actress for her performance. In a review for Variety, Ronnie Scheib praised Laurent and wrote that she, [...] "makes her vibrant character’s downward spiral totally believable without indulging in moody sullenness". That same year, she and Belgian actor Jérémie Renier were awarded France's Romy Schneider and Jean Gabin Prizes for most promising actor and actress. Laurent then starred in the Franco-Belgian Dikkenek, a comedy directed by Olivier Van Hoofstadt that has attained a cult film over the years owing to its Belgian-style humour, in which she co-starred alongside Marion Cotillard, Jérémie Renier, Jean-Luc Couchard and Dominique <b>Pinon.</b> For her performance in the film, Laurent won the Étoiles d'Or for Best Female Newcomer.|$|E
