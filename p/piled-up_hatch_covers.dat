5000|$|The No. 1 <b>hatch</b> <b>cover</b> {{was entirely}} inside the No. 1 hatch and showed {{indications}} of buckling from external loading. Sections of the coaming {{in way of}} the No. 1 hatch were fractured and buckled inward. The No. 2 <b>hatch</b> <b>cover</b> was missing and the coaming on the No. 2 hatch was fractured and buckled. Hatches Nos. 3 and 4 were covered with mud; one corner of <b>hatch</b> <b>cover</b> No. 3 {{could be seen in}} place. <b>Hatch</b> <b>cover</b> No. 5 was missing. A series of 16 consecutive <b>hatch</b> <b>cover</b> clamps were observed on the No. 5 hatch coaming. Of this series, the first and eighth were distorted or broken. All of the 14 other clamps were undamaged and in the open position. The No. 6 hatch was open and a <b>hatch</b> <b>cover</b> was standing on end vertically in the <b>hatch.</b> The <b>hatch</b> <b>covers</b> were missing from hatches Nos. 7 and 8 and both coamings were fractured and severely distorted. The bow section abruptly ended just aft of hatch No. 8 and the deck plating was ripped up from the separation to the forward end of hatch No. 7.|$|R
500|$|Regulations {{regarding}} <b>hatch</b> <b>covers</b> {{have evolved}} since the investigation following {{the loss of}} the [...] The Load Line Conference of 1966 imposed a requirement that <b>hatch</b> <b>covers</b> be able to withstand load of 1.74tons/m2 due to sea water, and a minimum scantling of 6mm for the tops of the <b>hatch</b> <b>covers.</b> The International Association of Classification Societies then increased this strength standard by creating its Unified Requirement S21 in 1998. [...] This standard requires that the pressure due to sea water be calculated as a function of freeboard and speed, especially for <b>hatch</b> <b>covers</b> located on the forward portion of the ship.|$|R
500|$|As {{recently}} as the 1950s, <b>hatches</b> had wooden <b>covers</b> that would be broken apart and rebuilt by hand, rather than opened and closed. [...] Newer vessels have hydraulic-operated metal <b>hatch</b> <b>covers</b> that can often be operated by one person. [...] <b>Hatch</b> <b>covers</b> can slide forwards, backwards, or to the side, lift up or fold up. It is essential that the <b>hatch</b> <b>covers</b> be watertight: unsealed hatches lead to accidental cargo hold flooding, which has caused many bulkers to sink.|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT: According to the {{increase}} of the operating cost and material cost of a ship due to the change of international oil price, a demand for the lightening of the ship weight is being made from various parties such as shipping companies, ship owners, and shipyards. To satisfy such demand, many studies for a light ship are being made. As one of them, an optimal design method of an existing hull structure, that is, a method for lightening the ship weight based on the optimization technique was proposed in this study. For this, we selected a <b>hatch</b> <b>cover</b> of a bulk carrier as an optimization target and formulated an optimization problem {{in order to determine}} optimal principal dimensions of the <b>hatch</b> <b>cover</b> for lightening the bulk carrier. Some dimensions representing the shape of the <b>hatch</b> <b>cover</b> were selected as design variables and some design considerations related to the maximum stress, maximum deflection, and geometry of the <b>hatch</b> <b>cover</b> were selected as constraints. In addition, the minimization of the weight of the <b>hatch</b> <b>cover</b> was selected as an objective function. To solve this optimization problem, we developed an optimization program based on the Sequential Quadratic Programming (SQP) using C++ programming language. To evaluate the applicability of the developed program, it was applied to a problem for finding optimal principal dimensions of the <b>hatch</b> <b>cover</b> of a deadweight 180, 000 ton bulk carrier. The result shows that the developed program can decrease the <b>hatch</b> <b>cover's</b> weight by about 8. 5 %. Thus, this study will be able to contribute to make energy saving and environment-friendly ship in shipyard...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe {{application}} of composites {{as an alternative}} material for marine steel <b>hatch</b> <b>covers</b> {{is the subject of}} this study. Two separate approaches are considered; weight reduction approach and strengthening approach. For both approaches Finite Element Analysis (FEA) was performed using ANSYS software. Critical design parameters of the composite <b>hatch</b> <b>cover</b> and FEA are discussed in details. Regarding the weight reduction approach; steel <b>hatch</b> <b>covers</b> of a bulk carrier were replaced by composite covers and a weight reduction of 44. 32 % was achieved leading to many benefits including fuel saving, Deadweight Increment and lower center of gravity of the vessel. For the strengthening approach; the foremost <b>hatch</b> <b>cover</b> was strengthened to withstand 150 % of the load required by IACS for safer navigation while no change in weight was made between the steel and composite covers. Results show that both approaches are feasible and advantageous...|$|R

5|$|A hatch or {{hatchway}} is {{the opening}} {{at the top of}} a cargo hold. The mechanical devices which allow hatches to be opened and closed are called <b>hatch</b> <b>cover.</b> In general, <b>hatch</b> <b>covers</b> are between 45% and 60% of the ship's breadth, or beam, and 57% to 67% of the length of the holds. To efficiently load and unload cargo, hatches must be large, but large hatches present structural problems. Hull stress is concentrated around the edges of the hatches, and these areas must be reinforced. Often, hatch areas are reinforced by locally increasing the scantlings or by adding structural members called stiffeners. Both of these options have the undesired effect of adding weight to the ship.|$|R
