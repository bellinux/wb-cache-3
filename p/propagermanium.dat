40|$|<b>Propagermanium,</b> a {{synthetic}} organic compound of germanium {{is known as}} β- or biscarboxyethylgermanium sesquioxide or Ge- 132. It is found in some plants such as shelf fungus, ginseng, garlic, and Aloe vera. Ge- 132 {{plays an important role}} for the pharmacological effects of the plants. The solubility of <b>propagermanium</b> at a certain pH is not exactly known yet. Until now, the analytical methods for the analysis of Ge- 132 so far have the shortcoming and the <b>propagermanium</b> as germanium metal in the sample, so that improvement for <b>propagermanium</b> analysis was necessary to be conducted, primarily to be used for solubility assay.

The results showed that validation parameters for analysis by using HPLC method e. i accuracy, precision, and linearity, have met to the quantitative analysis requirements. Increasing the pH causes increasing the solubility of <b>propagermanium</b> in the pH range of 3. 0 - 3. 6. The solubility result was 9. 8514; 10. 4204; 12. 5446 mg/mL on pH 3. 0; 3. 3; 3. 6...|$|E
40|$|Obese {{patients}} with chronic inflammation in white adipose tissue (WAT) have {{an increased risk of}} developing non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). The C-C chemokine receptor- 2 (CCR 2) has {{a crucial role in the}} recruitment of immune cells to WAT and liver, thereby promoting the inflammatory component of the disease. Herein, we examined whether intervention with <b>propagermanium,</b> an inhibitor of CCR 2, would attenuate tissue inflammation and NASH development. Male C 57 BL/ 6 J mice received a high-fat diet (HFD) for 0, 6, 12 and 24 weeks to characterize the development of early disease symptoms of NASH, i. e. insulin resistance and WAT inflammation (by hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp and histology, respectively) and to define the optimal time point for intervention. In a separate study, mice were pretreated with HFD followed by <b>propagermanium</b> treatment (0. 05 % w/w) after 6 weeks (early intervention) or 12 weeks (late intervention). NASH was analyzed after 24 weeks of diet feeding. Insulin resistance in WAT developed after 6 weeks of HFD, which was paralleled by modest WAT inflammation. Insulin resistance and inflammation in WAT intensified after 12 weeks of HFD, and preceded NASH development. The subsequent CCR 2 intervention experiment showed that early, but not late, <b>propagermanium</b> treatment attenuated insulin resistance. Only the early treatment significantly decreased Mcp- 1 and CD 11 c gene expression in WAT, indicating reduced WAT inflammation. Histopathological analysis of liver demonstrated that <b>propagermanium</b> treatment decreased macrovesicular steatosis and tended to reduce lobular inflammation, with more pronounced effects in the early intervention group. <b>Propagermanium</b> improved the ratio between pro-inflammatory (M 1) and anti-inflammatory (M 2) macrophages, quantified by CD 11 c and Arginase- 1 gene expression in both intervention groups.

40|$|Abstract. Examined were CCR 2 -deficient mice {{to clarify}} the {{contribution}} of macrophages via monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 (MCP- 1 or CCL 2) /CCR 2 signaling to the pathogenesis of renal ischemia-reperfusion injury. Also evaluated was the therapeutic effects via the inhibition of MCP- 1 /CCR 2 signaling with <b>propagermanium</b> (3 -oxygermylpropionic acid polymer) and RS- 504393. Renal artery and vein of the left kidney were occluded with a vascular clamp for 60 min. A large number of infiltrated cells and marked acute tubular necrosis in outer medulla after renal ischemia-reperfusion injury was observed. Ischemia-reperfusion induced the expression of MCP- 1 mRNA and protein in injured kidneys, followed by CCR 2 -positive macrophages in interstitium in wild-type mice. The expression of MCP- 1 was decreased in CCR 2 deficient mice compared with wild-type mice. The number o...|$|E
40|$|Alport {{syndrome}} is a {{glomerular basement membrane}} (GBM) disease caused by mutations in type IV collagen genes. A unique irregular thickening and thinning of the GBM characterizes the progressive glomerular pathology. The metabolic imbalances responsible for these GBM irregularities are not known. Here we show that macrophage metalloelastase (MMP- 12) expression is > 40 -fold induced in glomeruli from Alport mice and is markedly induced in glomeruli of both humans and dogs with Alport syndrome. Treatment of Alport mice with MMI 270 (CGS 27023 A), a broad spectrum MMP inhibitor that blocks MMP- 12 activity, results in largely restored GBM ultrastructure and function. Treatment with BAY- 129566, a broad spectrum MMP inhibitor that does not inhibit MMP- 12, had no effect. We show that inhibition of CC chemokine receptor 2 (CCR 2) receptor signaling with <b>propagermanium</b> blocks induction of MMP- 12 mRNA and prevents GBM damage. CCR 2 receptor is expressed in glomerular podocytes of Alport mice, suggesting MCP- 1 activation of CCR 2 on podocytes may underlie induction of MMP- 12. These data indicate that the irregular GBM that characterizes Alport syndrome may be mediated, in part, by focal degradation of the GBM due to MMP dysregulation, in particular, MMP- 12. Thus, MMP- 12 /CCR 2 inhibitors may provide a novel and effective therapeutic strategy for Alport glomerular disease...|$|E
40|$|Fibrosis is a {{hallmark}} of progressive organ diseases. Monocyte chemoattractant protein (MCP) - 1, also termed as macrophage chemotactic and activating factor (MCAF/CCL 2) and its receptor, CCR 2 are presumed to contribute to progressive fibrosis. However, the therapeutic efficacy of MCP- 1 /CCR 2 blockade in progressive fibrosis remains to be investigated. We hypothesized that blockade of CCR 2 {{may lead to the}} improvement of fibrosis. To achieve this goal, we investigated renal interstitial fibrosis induced by a unilateral ureteral obstruction in CCR 2 gene-targeted mice and mice treated with <b>propagermanium</b> or RS- 504393, CCR 2 inhibitors. Cell infiltrations, most of which were F 4 / 80 -positive, were reduced in CCR 2 knockout mice. In addition, dual staining revealed that CCR 2 -positive cells were mainly F 4 / 80 -positive macrophages. Importantly, CCR 2 blockade reduced renal interstitial fibrosis relative to wild-type mice. Concomitantly, renal transcripts and protein of MCP- 1, transforming growth factor-β, and type I collagen were decreased in CCR 2 -null mice. Further, this CCR 2 -dependent loop for renal fibrosis was confirmed by treatment with CCR 2 antagonists in a unilateral ureteral obstruction model. These findings suggest that the therapeutic strategy of blocking CCR 2 may prove beneficial for progressive fibrosis via the decrease in infiltration and activation of macrophages in the diseased kidneys...|$|E
