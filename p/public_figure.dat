5|$|After his censure, McCarthy {{continued}} senatorial duties {{for another}} {{two and a half}} years, but his career as a major <b>public</b> <b>figure</b> had been unmistakably ruined.

40|$|As a {{study of}} {{diffusion}} of law, this paper analyzes {{the ways in which}} the US legal concept of <b>public</b> <b>figures</b> spread in China. In New York Times v. Sullivan, the US Supreme Court made it clear that when it comes to libel cases involving public officials, the Court casts the balance strongly in favor of freedom of expression by requiring that public officials show that the newspaper acted with actual malice. This principle was later extended to <b>public</b> <b>figures.</b> In addition to the intrinsic value of freedom of expression, the rational for introducing the doctrine of <b>public</b> <b>figures</b> is the need to rebalance the unequal power relationship the fact that <b>public</b> <b>figures</b> have greater power and greater access to the media than private figures. As the idea of <b>public</b> <b>figures</b> migrated into China, several local courts adopted this concept in their rulings to define the limits of the right to reputation. Due to the power of public officials in China, there is some risk that the right to reputation can be used to silence critics. Questions of equality arise with respect to the actual power of the parties as well as whether <b>public</b> <b>figures</b> should be expected to be more tolerant of public criticism, even when it could harm reputation. This paper examines the development of the right to reputation in China and the diffusion of <b>public</b> <b>figures</b> in the broad context of citizenship construction, a process started in China with a nation-wide discussion of equality before the law in the late 1970 s. By investigating the channels, levels, and agents of diffusion, the paper demonstrates that the concept of <b>public</b> <b>figures</b> has been accepted locally but not nationally for both institutional and ideational reasons. Institutionally judges find themselves in a vulnerable position as they apply the concept to cases involving public officials. Ideationally, the concept of <b>public</b> <b>figures</b> calls for sufficient justification that fits the current legal thinking of the recipient country. One such justification is the need to address the inequality in the actual power of parties and, therefore, a renewed discussion of equality before the law may facilitate the acceptance of <b>public</b> <b>figures</b> at higher levels...|$|R
40|$|This Comment {{reflects}} {{an attempt to}} distill the Supreme Court 2 ̆ 7 s thematic intent from over thirty years of defamation case law. The Comment then evaluates current definitions of public officials and <b>public</b> <b>figures</b> {{to determine whether they}} are consistent with the theme. Washington courts have already addressed these definitions, but this Comment posits that Washington law on public officials and <b>public</b> <b>figures</b> is inconsistent with the Supreme Court 2 ̆ 7 s intent and suggests alternative defining tests for public officials and <b>public</b> <b>figures...</b>|$|R
5|$|Clinton has {{identified}} two influential moments in his life, both occurring in 1963, {{that contributed to}} his decision to become a <b>public</b> <b>figure.</b> One was his visit as a Boys Nation senator to the White House to meet President John F. Kennedy. The other was watching Martin Luther King Jr.'s 1963 I Have a Dream speech on TV, which impressed him enough that he later memorized it.|$|E
5|$|Once {{he was a}} civilian, Mitchell {{assumed a}} {{prominent}} role in the “Save the Argylls” campaign.

5|$|A quietly spoken athlete, he {{frequently}} states that his victories are {{a tribute to}} his country. Eritrea is one of Africa's newest and least populous countries, and Zersenay's achievements on the world athletics stage have {{made him one of}} the country's most identifiable sportsmen. He is a popular <b>public</b> <b>figure</b> in his home country; 2500 guests attended his wedding to Merhawit Solomon, which was broadcast live on Eritrean television. His brother, Kidane Tadese, is also a professional distance runner who has competed at the World Cross Country Championships and the 2008 Summer Olympics.|$|E
5|$|Also, {{the museum}} has a unique {{collection}} of various works by Ukrainian philologist P. Zhitetsky, Arabist and professor of the Kiev University T.

Janovsky and D. Popov, and other prominent local figures.|$|E
5|$|As a <b>public</b> <b>figure,</b> Pitt {{has been}} cited {{as one of the}} most {{influential}} and powerful people in the American entertainment industry. For a number of years, he was cited as the world's most attractive man by various media outlets, and his personal life is the subject of wide publicity. Divorced from actress Jennifer Aniston after five years of marriage, he married actress Angelina Jolie in 2014. They have six children together, three of whom were adopted internationally. In 2016, Jolie filed for a divorce from Pitt, which is currently pending.|$|E
5000|$|In {{protection}} terms, FTAC’s {{activities are}} said to benefit {{the families of the}} fixated individuals and the general public as much as the <b>public</b> <b>figures</b> that they are hounding. This is because those close to the fixated are more regularly exposed to their irrational and threatening behaviour than the <b>public</b> <b>figures</b> they target. This finding is similar to that made in the USA by Dietz and Martell in a report prepared for the National Institute of Justice: “The persons most at risk of violence from the individual mentally ill person who pursues <b>public</b> <b>figures</b> are not the <b>public</b> <b>figures</b> or those that protect them - assuming they have the necessary security arrangements - but rather the private citizens who are the family members and neighbours of the mentally disordered subject.” ...|$|R

5|$|As an {{important}} <b>public</b> <b>figure,</b> Reitz was honoured and remembered in different ways. In 1923 Reitz the University of Stellenbosch bestowed on him an honorary doctorate in law for his public services. Already in 1889, a village {{was named after}} him in the Orange Free State. In 1894 one also named a village after his second wife, Cornelia. A ship named after him, the President Reitz, sank off Port Elizabeth in 1947. The Jubilee Diamond, found in the Free State village of Jagersfontein in 1895 was originally named the Reitz Diamond, but renamed in honour of the sixtieth anniversary of the coronation of Queen Victoria in 1897.|$|E
5|$|Because of his long-running {{television}} {{career and}} eccentric demeanour, Moore was widely recognised {{and became a}} popular <b>public</b> <b>figure.</b> In 1976 {{it was used to}} good effect for an April Fools' Day spoof on BBC Radio 2, when Moore announced a once-in-a-lifetime astronomical event that meant that if listeners could jump at that exact moment, 9.47 a.m. they would experience a temporary sensation of weightlessness. The BBC received many telephone calls from listeners alleging they experienced the sensation. He was a key figure in the establishment of the International Birdman event in Bognor Regis, which was initially held in Selsey.|$|E
5|$|In 1861 Sophia Ripley died. George Ripley remarried, to Louisa Sclossberger, in 1865, {{and was a}} part of the Gilded Age New York {{literary}} {{scene for}} the remainder of his life. Because of his convivial nature, he was careful to avoid the city's rampant literary feuds at the time. He became a <b>public</b> <b>figure</b> with a national reputation and, known as an arbiter of taste, he helped establish the National Institute of Literature, Art, and Science in 1869. In his later years, he began suffering frequent illnesses, including a bout with influenza in 1875 which prevented him from traveling to Germany. He also suffered from gout and rheumatism.|$|E

5|$|In late October, Andrić {{left for}} Belgrade. He became {{involved}} in the city's literary circles and soon acquired the distinction of being one of Belgrade's most popular young writers. Though the Belgrade press wrote positively of him, Andrić disliked being a <b>public</b> <b>figure,</b> and went into seclusion and distanced himself from his fellow writers. At the same time, he grew dissatisfied with his government job and wrote to Alaupović asking for a transfer to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. On 20 February, Andrić's request was granted and he was assigned to the Foreign Ministry's mission at the Vatican.|$|E

He explained that this {{did not apply to}} Eiland-Hall's website even if it was knowingly inaccurate, because the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in Hustler Magazine v. Falwell that no proof is needed for an absurd statement made in the context of satire.|$|E
5|$|Samuel Adams {{emerged as}} an {{important}} <b>public</b> <b>figure</b> in Boston soon after the British Empire's victory in the French and Indian War (1754–1763). The British Parliament found itself deep in debt and looking for new sources of revenue, and they sought to directly tax the colonies of British America for the first time. This tax dispute {{was part of a}} larger divergence between British and American interpretations of the British Constitution and the extent of Parliament's authority in the colonies.|$|E
5|$|Beatrice was the shyest {{of all of}} Queen Victoria's children. However, {{because she}} {{accompanied}} Queen Victoria almost wherever she went, she became among the best known. Despite her shyness, she was an able actress and dancer {{as well as a}} keen artist and photographer. She was devoted to her children and was concerned when they misbehaved at school. To those who enjoyed her friendship, she was loyal and had a sense of humour, and as a <b>public</b> <b>figure</b> she was driven by a strong sense of duty. She was Patron of the Isle of Wight Branch of the Royal National Lifeboat Institution from 1920 until her death. Music, a passion that was shared by her mother and the Prince Consort, was something in which Beatrice excelled, and she played the piano to professional standards. Like her mother, she was a devout Christian, fascinated by theology until her death. With her calm temperament and personal warmth, the princess won wide approval.|$|E
