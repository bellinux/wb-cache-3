[...] No progress was achieved on addressing the problems with the territorial system as a variety of bills dealing with the issue were introduced but failed to pass. The session did however grant a fifteen-year tax exemption to new water development projects while new railroads received a ten-year exemption.|$|R

5000|$|Something Else {{received}} widespread acclaim from critics. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to {{reviews from}} mainstream publications, the album received an average score of 85, based on five reviews. David Jeffries of AllMusic said, [...] "Building on the pop and polish of his 2011 release All 6's and 7's, this 2013 effort from Tech N9ne finds the angry and angsty rapper bringing {{back some of}} the horror show rap of his early days, which is good, because now his nightmares are not only vivid, but incredibly well-funded." [...] Arasia Graham of HipHopDX said, [...] "Something Else in all of its intense, loud, confusing and obnoxious glory is fluid in its musical movement and sincere in its content. The album is <b>contradictory</b> <b>in</b> subject <b>matter</b> and sound yet speaks to the idealistic and free flowing approach Tech takes when creating music. Tech N9ne sounds sharp over complicated production that has many layers to peel back. And he took big risks that will pay off, as Something Else will surely be a contender for album of the year. There are a few holes—the project's length and forgettable appearances (Wiz Khalifa on [...] "See Me")—but overall, it's an incredible album that will keep that hint of burgundy in the sky." [...] Erin Lowers of Exclaim! said, [...] "While 18 full tracks is a bold move, it's not the best. Songs like [...] "Dwamn", [...] "Strange 2013" [...] and [...] "Meant to Happen" [...] fall by the wayside, and ultimately break the record's power. Nevertheless, the standout numbers are potent enough to carry this from start to finish." [...] Steve Jones of USA Today said, [...] "The Kansas City rapper explores facets of his personality - fire, water, earth - using a variety of flows and eclectic beats. He harnesses a prodigious guest list (Cee Lo, Kendrick Lamar, Serj Tankian, T-Pain, The Doors) to create something unconventional." ...|$|R

40|$|This is {{a conference}} paper. There {{is little doubt}} that design work {{provides}} a natural focus for Information Technology (IT) activities and that both profile components of National Curriculum Technology are intended to be centred upon real applications and real situations. Despite a plethora of computer software applications which might be considered relevant in the context of Design and Technology work, few are rarely designed {{to meet the needs of}} pupil learners and so it is not surprising that few are used effectively. If IT is to become an effective tool in education, there is an urgent need to consider how pupils and students learn through interaction with computer media, and ways in which the teacher’s role might be developed. These issues are quite different from, but no less important than, those considered by the software engineer, who is predominantly concerned with providing elegant program code and sophisticated program facilities. This paper discusses how these two sets of, often <b>contradictory,</b> <b>matters</b> may be corporately considered to provide more effective software design. In particular, it considers how research, development and evaluation, concerned with computer applications, might take more effective account of educationalists’ views, teachers’ requirements and pupils’ needs...|$|R
