40|$|Personalized Web portals are {{becoming}} more and more popular. What is unsatisfying with existing sites is that the scope of the personalized content they provide is typically that of the underlying site. Providers of such personalized content typically develop their own, proprietary personalized Web portal. To use different personalization features of different sites users have to hop from one personalized site to another and provide different user profile information there. Therefore, we propose a flexible architecture in which a personalization mediator acts as a broker of modular <b>personalization</b> <b>services</b> between providers of personalized content and users that are interested in such personalized content. In this architecture, the providers of personalized content publish their <b>personalization</b> <b>services</b> via a unified interface to this mediator. A user provides its profile information to the mediator which in turn finds and calls the most suitable service which finally delivers the most targeted personalized content. The benefit of our approach is that users get an easier and unified access to a notional unlimited collection of <b>personalization</b> <b>services</b> by the mediator. For the providers, the approach allows different sites with different personalization capabilities to embed their <b>personalization</b> <b>services</b> in a generic infrastructure for applications like personalized Web portals...|$|R

To this end, the CDS Invenio software is being developed and used as a complete digital library system for the storage, preservation, management and distribution of CERN’s scientific work. The software is being constantly refined and improved {{in order to meet}} the bibliographic needs of researchers and scientists alike. One of the its current objectives is the collaboration of respective digital libraries, maintained by organizations of similar research interests. Within such a collaboration, searching and <b>personalization</b> <b>services</b> on a distributed network of cooperative digital libraries are being planned. In this thesis, we first examined in depth the basic principles and features of CDS Invenio. On this basis, we made a proposal and its respective implementation that allows for searching and <b>personalization</b> <b>services</b> on a distributed network of cooperative digital libraries. We thoroughly described all the necessary adjustments and additions in achieving our goal. Hosted collections are the core of our design, which refer to different record collections belonging to the members of the distributed network. A range of classes and functions handle the searching of these collections fetching the data, using the hypertext transfer protocol, and then analyzing it. The <b>personalization</b> <b>services,</b> such as personal record collections and personalized notifications about newly added records, are implemented in a similar way for hosted collections. In the course of our work we addressed the presumed uncertainty of network resources’ availability and respective network delays, by maintaining a highly acceptable response time. We also dealt with the inherent drawback of distributed searching, namely the lack of control over the different indexing and ranking capabilities of each member of the distributed network. We concluded that the proposed architecture is an integrated solution for searching and <b>personalization</b> <b>services</b> on a distributed network of cooperative digital libraries, offering commensurate quality with the one of an autonomous digital library. It is also open to extensions and improvements, which may be the subject of future work...|$|R

School of Business and Economics at Linnaeus University, Course Code 2 FE 21 E, 2017.   Title: Likelihood of Using Online Personalization Services: An Explanatory Study Authors: Avesta Diliwi, Christopher Ullberg and Johanna Jevinger Supervisor: Michaela Sandell Examiner: Åsa Devine Background: Online {{personalization}} is {{the result}} of the rapid technological and digital development where consumers are provided products, services and content based on their individual preferences. Various research has been conducted regarding what factors influence the utilization and acceptance of personalization but does not provide a holistic view on the unified relationship of the recurrent variables of value for personalization, concern for privacy and trust building factors towards likelihood of using online <b>personalization</b> <b>services.</b> Purpose: The purpose of this research is to explain the relationship of value for personalization, concern for privacy, and trust building factors with the likelihood of using online <b>personalization</b> <b>services.</b> Methodology: This research replicated Chellappa and Sin’s (2005) research by modifying their theoretical model and testing it in another context. An explanatory, deductive, quantitative research approach and cross-sectional research design were utilized within this research, where self-completed questionnaires were distributed online with a number of 228 valid responses collected. Findings: The findings demonstrate that the new theoretical model is significant and that it explains the likelihood of using online <b>personalization</b> <b>services</b> with 62, 3 %. Value for personalization and concern for privacy are considered highly significant and are thus accepted hypotheses, while trust building factors is not considered significant and therefore rejected. Conclusion: This research provides an insight into consumers’ usage decision in regards to likelihood of using personalization. It also provides a furthering on prior research in regards to a theoretical development, the modified model tested in a new context, but also in the findings in how the three independent variables affect the dependent variable. In addition, this research provides support for practitioners of online <b>personalization</b> <b>services</b> to understand which factors actually affect consumers’ usage decision, and can potentially develop strategies accordingly.

40|$|Online <b>personalization</b> <b>services</b> {{belong to}} a class of {{economic}} goods with a "no free disposal" (NFD) property where consumers do not always prefer more services to less because of the privacy concerns. These concerns arise from the revelation of information necessary {{for the provision of}} <b>personalization</b> <b>services.</b> We examine vendor strategies in a market where consumers have heterogeneous concerns about privacy. In successive generalizations, we allow the vendor to offer a fixed level of personalization, variable levels of personalization, and monetary transfers (coupons) to the consumers that depend on the level of personalization chosen. We show that a vendor offering a fixed level of personalization does not offer a coupon unless his marginal value of information (MVI) is sufficiently high, and even when personalization is costless, the vendor does not cover the market. Under a fixed services offering, the vendor serves the same market with or without couponing. Next, we demonstrate that in the absence of couponing, the vendor's optimal variable <b>personalization</b> <b>services</b> contract maximizes surplus for all heterogeneous consumers, which is in contrast to standard results from monopolistic screening. When the vendor can offer coupons that vary according to personalization levels, the optimal contract is not fully revealing unless his MVI is high and he will not offer coupons when this MVI is low. However, a vendor with a moderate MVI (between certain thresholds) offers a bunched contract, wherein consumers with low privacy concerns receive a variable services-coupon contract, those with moderate privacy concerns receive a fixed services-coupon contract, and those with high privacy concerns do not participate in the market. The coupon value is decreasing in privacy sensitivity of consumers. incentives, mechanism design, personalization, privacy, no free disposal...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{describes}} the relationship between, {{on the one}} hand, operations performed by a user while browsing a Web page that seem to indicate interest in the content and, on the other hand, the user’s real interest or {{lack of interest in}} that page. One way of acquiring information from a mountain of information is to use a <b>personalization</b> <b>service</b> that provides information tailored for each user. The system on which such a service is based has to learn what a user is interested in. We examined some user operations that seem to indicate interest. The results of our investigation can be used in the system in <b>personalization</b> <b>service</b> to learn about a user’s degree of interest. In a preliminary survey of users ’ operations during Web browsing, we observed five users while they were browsing the Web and asked 26 users to complete a questionnaire about their operations during Web browsing. This preliminary survey clarified which operations indicate interest. We discuss a prototype system that detects DOM (Document Object Model) operation events in a Web browser and extracts interest-indicating operations from operation events. The prototype also estimates the user’s degree of interest in a page. To evaluate the prototype, we carried out an experiment, in which 15 users participated. The results of this experiment show (1) the extracted interest-indicating operations are related to the users ’ actual degree of interest and (2) the estimated degree of interest to a page also reflects the user’s actual degree of interest to some extent...|$|E
