During his 22-year tenure at Georgia Tech, Brittain was credited with doubling student enrollment, establishing what is now the second largest aerospace engineering faculty in the United States, and playing an influential role in securing Georgia Tech's position as a leading technical institute and research university. After his retirement, Brittain wrote The Story of Georgia Tech (1948), a history of the Institute published shortly before his death in 1953.|$|E

Pettit has also received credit for shifting Georgia Tech back to its roots with regards to providing assistance with economic development within the state of Georgia. In the decades known for the Vietnam War and the launch of Sputnik, research at Georgia Tech and the Georgia Tech Research Institute had become so tied with NASA and the Department of Defense that local industrial development had been largely forgotten.|$|E

Brittain {{was born in}} Georgia and, aside from a brief stint at the University of Chicago for graduate school, {{spent most of his}} life serving the educational community there. After receiving a Bachelor of Arts degree from Emory College in 1886, Brittain worked his way up the ranks from principal of an Atlanta high school to superintendent of education for the entire state of Georgia.|$|E

John Young walked on the moon as the commander of Apollo 16, first commander {{of the space shuttle}} and is the only person to have piloted four different classes of spacecraft. Georgia Tech has its fair share of noteworthy engineers, scientists, and inventors. Nobel Laureate Kary Mullis developed the polymerase chain reaction, Herbert Saffir developed the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale, and W. Jason Morgan made significant contributions to the theory of plate tectonics and geodynamics. In computer science, Krishna Bharat developed Google News, and D. Richard Hipp developed SQLite. Architect Michael Arad designed the World Trade Center Memorial in New York City.|$|E

He returned to academic administration, first as {{superintendent of the}} Fulton County School System (1900–1910) and later, at the appointment of Joseph Mackey Brown, the education system for {{the entire state of}} Georgia (1910–1922). In this role, Brittain became well known for fighting corruption and generally improving the education system. Throughout this time, Brittain earned LL.D. degrees from Mercer University (1919), and, later, the University of Georgia (1927) and Emory University (1928). He was also <b>president</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Georgia</b> Education Association in 1906, of the Southern Education Association in 1913, and of the Council of State School Superintendents of the United States in 1917.
