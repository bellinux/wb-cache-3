However, the magnitude of poverty rise is not homogeneous geographically or by household types – e. g., the poorest or less educated households were more badly affected than the wealthier or educated households. We suggest 'demographic targeting' or 'geographical targeting' as a policy option that selects and supports poor households by demographic characteristics or by geographical areas according {{to the degree of}} vulnerability. Protecting those households from food price shocks would be still important now given that rising and volatile food prices have continued due to erratic climate patterns and demand and supply conditions along with economic and financial crisis.

40|$|Although {{fundamental}} {{factors were}} clearly responsible for shifting {{the world to}} a higher food price equilibrium in the years leading up the 2008 food crisis, {{there is little doubt}} that when food prices peaked in June of 2008, they soared well above the new equilibrium price. Numerous arguments have been proposed to explain overshooting, including financial speculation, depreciation of the United States (US) dollar, low interest rates, and reductions in grain stocks. However, observations that international rice <b>prices</b> <b>surged</b> in response to export restrictions by India and Vietnam suggested that trade-related factors could be an important basis for overshooting, especially given the very tangible link between export volumes and export prices. In this paper, we revisit the trade story by closely examining monthly data from Thailand (the largest exporter of rice), and the United States (the largest exporter of wheat and maize and the third largest exporter of soybeans). In all cases except soybeans, we find that large surges in export volumes preceded the <b>price</b> <b>surges.</b> The presence of these large demand surges, together with back-of-the-envelope estimates of their price impacts, suggests that trade events played a much larger and more pervasive role than previously thought.

40|$|The food <b>price</b> <b>surges</b> {{of recent}} years have created much misery and raised once again the Malthusian specter. Increases in the demand for food in the {{emerging}} economies, particularly China and India, have frequently been identified as the dominant factor behind a perceived shock on the demand side. Use of crops for biofuels was listed as an additional, though less important, factor. Yet global cereals utilization without biofuels has been growing at slowly decelerating rates, as in the past. It is the addition of biofuels {{that has resulted in}} its growing faster than in the past. In parallel, global production had been falling behind utilization for several years, leading to declining stocks. Weather shocks, depreciation of the dollar, and turbulence in the financial markets were added to these fundamentals of the supply-demand balance to generate the <b>price</b> <b>surges.</b> If energy <b>prices</b> remain high and/or rising and pro-biofuel policies remain in place, the diversion of crops to biofuels is likely to continue. This could prevent the current commodity cycle from unfolding in the "normal" way over the short to medium term with prices trending back toward their pre-surge levels. Conclusions are drawn about how these developments should influence the way we assess long-term food and agriculture prospects. Copyright (c) 2008 The Population Council, Inc [...] ...|$|R

50|$|It {{was also}} {{noticed that a}} copper price bubble was {{occurring}} {{at the same time}} as the oil bubble. Copper traded at about $2,500 per metric tonne from 1990 until 1999, when it fell to about $1,600. The price slump lasted until 2004 which saw a <b>price</b> <b>surge</b> that had copper reaching $9,000 per tonne in the May 2006, but it eventually fell down to $7,040 per tonne in early 2008. When the slump came, it hit some copper mining countries like the Democratic Republic of the Congo (D.R.C.) very hard. Mining authorities announced on 10 December 2009, that the Dikulushi mine, which is situated in the D.R.C.’s Katanga Province, would close due to poor copper prices. It reopened in July 2010. The price rose again to over $10,000 in early 2011 but soon fell to below $8,000, around where it was fairly stable during 2012. Unfortunately the high prices have caused a heavy increase in theft of copper cables, causing interruptions in electrical supply. During 2013-2014 there has been a slow decline to below $7000.|$|E

40|$|Food <b>prices</b> <b>surge</b> during 2007 - 08 has induced an {{enormous}} impact on the whole world, especially on the Sub-Saharan African countries. The factors that caused the food <b>prices</b> <b>surge</b> during 2007 - 08 have influenced food prices in different levels. The factors can be analyzed by demand and supply model. On the demand side, the factors include biofuel conversion effects, speculative effects, and the food consumption structure changes in China and India. On the supply side, the factors include export restrictions effects and livestock feeding effects. However, none of the factors could be ignored, since there are psychological impacts that can enlarge the effects. Conflicts, especially riots and the armed conflicts, intrastate conflicts, non-state conflicts and one-sided violence have been occurred in many Sub-Saharan African countries during 2007 - 08. Hendrix, et al. (2009) stated that “relative deprivation” hypothesis combined economic and psychological factors. The hypothesis focused on the factors that related to people’s basic needs, perceived entitlement and expectations. Relative deprivation based on economic grievances that related to economic growth, inflation and the changes in the international market prices of major trade products, the level of income and the income change. Conflicts might be onset once people could not achieve what they desired or when their “relative deprivation” increased. The case study in this thesis related to 32 low-income Sub-Saharan African countries (excluding oil countries). In order to investigate economic grievances, I separate these 32 countries into importing countries and exporting countries. I focus on the eight riots’ countries – Senegal, Mozambique, Mauritania, Guinea, Ethiopia, Cote d’Ivoire, Burkina Faso and Madagascar. Findings of this thesis are that in the countries with low speed economic growth and high inflation, low-income people can be easily affected by international food prices shocks. Psychology is a powerful tool, which may enlarge the relative deprivation and the factors that causing international food <b>prices</b> <b>surge</b> during 2007 - 08. In order to avoid conflict onset in Sub-Saharan African countries, to avoid international food prices shock is necessary, especially for food importing countries that have to be vigilant on the international food market. The food availability and stability are important for a country to remain its peace. Asiasanat:food price, conflict, Sub-Saharan Africa, riot, deprivation, grievance, psycholog...|$|R
