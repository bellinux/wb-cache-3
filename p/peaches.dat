40|$|Abstract. <b>Peach</b> is an edible, sweet, juicy {{fruit and}} is widely {{consumed}} throughout the world. <b>Peach</b> flavor {{is a very}} sweet and delightful fruity flavor {{which can be used}} in many products. Therefore, developing a <b>peach</b> flavor is of significant interests. This article deals with developing a fresh <b>peach</b> flavor. According to the odor <b>peach</b> fruit, the notes of <b>peach</b> were identified. Proper chemical ingredients were selected to imitate the odor of <b>peach</b> and to create a <b>peach</b> flavor. A fresh <b>peach</b> flavor formula was obtained. The functions and the odors of raw materials in the <b>peach</b> flavor were discussed.

40|$|The cultivated/domesticated <b>peach</b> (Prunus persica var. persica; Rosaceae, {{subgenus}} Amygdalus; synonym: Amygdalus persica) {{originated in}} China, but its wild ancestor, {{as well as}} where, when, {{and under what circumstances}} the <b>peach</b> was domesticated, is poorly known. Five populations of archaeological <b>peach</b> stones recovered from Zhejiang Province, China, document <b>peach</b> use and evolution beginning ca. 8000 BP. The majority of the archaeological sites from which the earliest <b>peach</b> stones have been recovered are from the Yangzi River valley, indicating that this is where early selection for favorable <b>peach</b> varieties likely took place. Furthermore, <b>peach</b> stone morphology through time is consistent with the hypothesis that an unknown wild P. persica was the ancestor of the cultivated <b>peach.</b> The oldest archaeological <b>peach</b> stones are from the Kuahuqiao (8000 - 7000 BP) and Tianluoshan (7000 - 6500 BP) sites and both stone samples segregate into two size groups, suggesting early selection of preferred types. The first <b>peach</b> stones in China most similar to modern cultivated forms are from the Liangzhu culture (ca. 5300 to 4300 BP), where the <b>peach</b> stones are significantly larger and more compressed than earlier stones.

5|$|Following the {{surrender}} of Thickety Fort, Shelby joined a band of partisans under Lieutenant Elijah Clarke. This unit was pursued by British Major Patrick Ferguson. On the morning of August 8, 1780, some of Shelby's men were gathering <b>peaches</b> from an orchard when they were surprised by some of Ferguson's men on a reconnaissance mission. Shelby's men quickly readied their arms and drove back the British patrol. Soon, however, the British were reinforced and the colonists fell back. The pattern continued, with one side being reinforced and gaining an advantage, followed by the other. Shelby's men were winning the battle when Ferguson's main force of 1,000 men arrived. Outmanned, they retreated to a nearby hill where British musket fire could not reach them. Now safe, they taunted the British, and Ferguson's force withdrew from the area. Thus ended the Battle of Cedar Springs.|$|E

5|$|The town {{began to}} develop after the {{completion}} of the Okanogan Irrigation Project, which was designed to facilitate farming. At this time, many farmers came to Omak looking for homes.

Omak served as a census-designated place (CDP) in 1910, and incorporated as a city on February 11, 1911. Omak and Okanogan have shared a rivalry in high school sports. During the Great Depression of 1933, several residents of Omak were forced to work in nearby communities. As a result, the United States Bureau of Reclamation promoted work which was available as part of an improvement project at Grand Coulee Dam in nearby Coulee Dam, which employed approximately 5,000 people between 1933 and 1951 when the megaproject ended.

While some farmers of a few kinds of native crops do bring in honey bees to help pollinate, none specifically need them, and when honey bees are absent from a region, there is a presumption that native pollinators may reclaim the niche, typically being better adapted to serve those plants (assuming that the plants normally occur in that specific area).|$|E
