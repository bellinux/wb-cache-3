5000|$|On November 14, 2013, Constitutional Court in a 13-0 {{statement}} {{sent to the}} State Election Commission {{stated that}} there is no constitutional obstacle to hold a 2013 referendum on defining marriage as a union between men and a woman, in the same time pointing out that the referendum revealed numerous problems in the Referendum law and opened a number of legal questions that required answers. Nevertheless, the Court stressed that decision on the referendum was passed by a majority of 104 MPs and that since it was made with more votes than the majority needed to even change the Constitution itself, the referendum should be held. In addition, the Court asked Croatian Parliament to [...] "provide a stable regulatory framework of the referendum process that meets the standards of a democratic society as soon as possible". The Court also decided that [...] "any amendments to the Constitution which would define marriage as being union {{between a man and a}} woman should not have any effect on the further development of the legal framework of the institution of same-sex unions in accordance with the constitutional requirement that everyone in Croatia has the right to be respected and right of legal protection of their personal and family life and human dignity". The Court pointed out that it had never received any request or <b>proposal</b> <b>to</b> <b>review</b> the constitutionality of the provisions of the Family Law that regulated marriage as a union between a man and woman, or provisions of the Law on Same-Sex Unions. The Court therefore considered that the referendum on the definition of marriage is not a referendum on the right to respect for family life, because it is constitutionally guaranteed to all persons, regardless of sex and gender, and is under the direct protection of both, the Constitutional Court itself and the European Court of Human Rights. In conclusion, the Court warned that [...] "incorporation of legal institutes in the constitution shouldn't become a systemic phenomenon" [...] and that exceptional individual cases must be justified by being connected, for example, with deep-rooted social and cultural characteristics of the society.|$|E
40|$|I {{have long}} {{maintained}} {{that in the}} unfolding of exciting lines of research, seldom can one plan how to achieve a cooperative program. “Planned science,” more often than not, is forced science and not particularly productive. Far more significant {{is the role of}} serendipity in defining an exciting and innovative line of research, i. e., a truly stimulating cooperation. Fundamental advances simply cannot be planned for; one has to flow with the current. Thus it was that serendipity brought together the research group in Experimental Embryology of Prof. dr. J. A. M. van den Biggelaar at the University of Utrecht, and my own group in Systematics and Zoogeography at the University of Amsterdam. Several years ago I had received a grant <b>proposal</b> <b>to</b> <b>review</b> from the Dutch science research council (NWO).

40|$|AbstractIn 1968, the agar {{dilution}} method was developed {{as an independent}} Japanese method for measuring the minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) of antimicrobial agents. As this method differed in a few respects from the MIC measurement methods used in other countries, it was revised in 1981, by a committee headed by Susumu Mitsuhashi, and the revised method (Chemotherapy 29 : 76 - 79, 1981) has been used since then. In 1979, an agar {{dilution method}} for measuring the MIC of anaerobes was developed by a committee chaired by Nozomu Kosakai (Chemotherapy 27 : 559 - 561, 1979). In 1990, a committee headed by Sachiko Goto approved a broth microdilution method for nonfastidious bacteria (Chemotherapy 38 : 102 - 105, 1990). Later, a committee headed by Atsushi Saito examined media that would be suitable for nonfastidious bacteria and fastidious bacteria, and they endeavored to prepare a broth microdilution method for anaerobic bacteria. In this context, a new broth microdilution method was proposed at the 40 th Annual Meeting of the Japanese Society of Chemotherapy (JSC) in Nagoya in 1992, and the proposal was adopted as the standard JSC method after some modification (Chemotherapy 41 : 183 - 189, 1993). The agar dilution method has remained unrevised for approximately 20 years. A <b>proposal</b> <b>to</b> <b>review</b> this method was recently made, and the 2007 Committee on Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing was formed, comprising the JSC members listed below.

40|$|In 2009 Unitec and Te Rau Matatini {{entered into}} a {{partnership}} agreement to deliver the GDNFPM to scholarship recipients from the Māori Mental Health sector (as a separate stream from the generic course intake). Te Rau Matatini scholarship criteria are that the recipient is Māori and is actively employed in the sector. Te Rau Matatini sought out Unitec as the preferred provider to work with these emerging leaders within the Māori Mental Health sector. Te Rau Matatini liked the content and its value, and they had received positive feedback about the teaching style (thought to be suitable for Māori learners). The agreement specified a 3 year period (2009 ‐ 2012) to appoint a Māori tutor, increase the Māori content and literature of the course and {{increase the number of}} Māori teaching staff to assist with the programme being revamped to create a best fit for the Māori learner. The majority of students who were enrolled in the cohort that became known as Te Rau Matatini were in fact bursars of Te Rau Matatini funding, however some had not been eligible for the Te Rau Matatini criteria but were Māori and managed to gain District Health Board scholarships to enable them to participate. This challenge was taken on by Unitec and with the appointment of a Māori tutor in the second year of this agreement it was essential that the GDNFPM initiate a way of examining their performance and how effective this had been {{at the end of this}} period. GDNFPM staff supported a <b>proposal</b> <b>to</b> <b>review</b> the delivery to this cohort by interviewing students, Te Rau Matatini, employees of the participating students and themselves as the tutors. 2011 was the last year of Te Rau Matatini sponsored students on the GDNFPM. Te Rau Matatini were consulted on a research funding proposal outlining the project and invited to provide their comments on the Ethics Application draft as partners, prior to an ethics application being submitted. Some verbal feedback was received and noted. The only concern that was raised by the CEO at the time was to ensure that the project was not in any way focused on critiquing any participants on the programme who were Mental Health consumers. In August 2011 Te AkoWhaiora (the name given to the research) was approved by the Unitec Research Ethics Committee...|$|E

40|$|In this essay, I {{discuss the}} meaning of ten {{empirical}} studies of judicial review of agency actions that have been published over the last twenty years. The most robust findings are: a court’s choice among the six deference doctrines courts now use {{has no effect on}} the outcome of cases; the ideological preferences of judges and Justices explain about 30 % of their votes; members of politically mixed panels indulge their ideological preferences about half as often as do members of politically homogenous panels; and, the D. C. Circuit is consistently less deferential than other circuits. I conclude by endorsing David Zaring’s <b>proposal</b> <b>to</b> simplify <b>review</b> doctrine by replacing the present six doctrines with a single doctrine - a reviewing court should uphold any reasonable agency decision.

An initiation project typically involves a single investigator. The purpose of the project is to undertaken pilot work, lasting no more than one year, which will lead to the successful submission of an externally-funded proposal or the development of a collaborative cluster project.

As a computational problem, it involves matching a set of candidate reviewers with a paper or <b>proposal</b> <b>to</b> be <b>reviewed.</b> A common deficiency of all existing work on solving this problem is that they do not consider the multiple aspects of topics or expertise and all match the entire document <b>to</b> be <b>reviewed</b> with the overall expertise of a reviewer.

The Sami people are generally depicted with the hut and the reindeer management in majority of the reviewed schoolbooks.
