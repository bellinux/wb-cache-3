In order to determine these assignments, questionnaire was administered to two hundred and fifth-six male and female college students. First, the scale of experience in <b>physical</b> <b>education</b> <b>class</b> for each term (elementary school, junior high school and high school). As a result of factor analysis, three main factors were extracted respectively; “Pleasure”, “Activity frustration”, “Interpersonal frustration”. These scales include 25 - 27 items and α-coefficients were enough high to support the high reliability of each factor. Second, the results of analyses of variance on the degree of fan about <b>physical</b> <b>education</b> <b>class</b> in the scale of experience in <b>physical</b> <b>education</b> <b>class</b> for each term revealed that the subjects who answered Like showed higher in “Pleasure”, the subjects who answered Dislike showed higher in “Activity frustration” and “Interpersonal frustration”. And the results of analysis of variance on the degree of fan about participation in sport revealed much the same. Finally, the significance of the study about <b>physical</b> <b>education</b> <b>class</b> given consideration from the viewpoint of sport independence was discussed...|$|R
40|$|The {{present study}} aims at {{investigating}} the obstacles face <b>physical</b> <b>education</b> at schools in Al Madenah Al Munawarah, {{in addition to}} examining <b>physical</b> <b>education</b> obstacles at schools according to the variables of: years of experience, education qualification, and school’s geographic location.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to examine the effects of <b>physical</b> <b>education</b> <b>class</b> {{applying}} experiential learning method on intrinsic motivation, perceived physical competence, and enjoyment of students. The subjects were 99 college students who enrolled in mandatory <b>physical</b> <b>education</b> <b>class.</b> We applied experiential learning method to the experimental group (n= 50), while the control group (n= 49) took part in normal <b>physical</b> <b>education</b> <b>class.</b> Intrinsic motivation of students was assessed using the Children's Perceived Competence Scale and Children's Self-Determination Scale developed by Sakurai (1993), and Children Acceptance by Significant Others Scale developed by Takano et al. (1992). We utilized Perceived Physical Competence Scale developed by Okazawa et al. (1996) to evaluate perceived physical competence of the students. Flow State Scale developed by Jackson et al. (1996) was adapted at the end of every <b>physical</b> <b>education</b> <b>class</b> to rate the enjoyment of the class. The data-analysis indicated that the classes applying experiential learning method significantly damaged a sense of self-determination in the experimental group. On the other hands, feeling of control in the experimental group significantly improved after the <b>physical</b> <b>education</b> <b>class.</b> There were significant difference in peer and teacher acceptance between the experimental and control groups. There were no significant changes in sense of competence, sense of acceptance by significant others, perceived physical competence, and enjoyment.

The problems of getting facilities for women's sports like netball is still difficult because of Zulu gender constructions, where men are the dominant cultural force. Some schools in coloured areas do not offer <b>physical</b> <b>education</b> <b>classes.</b> To address this need, they have school teams.

In order to carry out this study, a questionnaire was administered to 231 first-year students. The main results were as follows: 1. Students who played sports activities during the summer vacation were below half. 2. Students spent watching television and video rather than participating sports activities during the summer vacation. 3. Relation between taking part-time job and sports activities was not found. It is not because students are taking at a part-time job that they do not have time to play sports. Students do not seem to be sports-minded. 4.

At eighteen they served in the army and were instructed on how to bear arms. Physical education was very intense and many of the boys ended up becoming true athletes. In addition to these compulsory lessons, the students had the chance to discuss and learn from the great philosophers, grammarians and orators of the time. Some poor people had to stay at home and help their parents. However Aristophanes and Socrates, though they were poor, became famous and successful.|$|E

The study includes 690 students, 387 of whom are girls and 303 of whom are boys. In order to determine the level of <b>physical</b> <b>education</b> <b>class</b> climate, self-efficacy and perception of success of the students, <b>Physical</b> <b>Education</b> <b>Class</b> Climate Scale, General Self-Efficacy Scale and Children Version of Perception of Success Inventory were used. In the assessment of data, Pearson correlation analysis, multiple regression analysis and structural equation modeling analysis were used. As a result, it was observed that <b>Physical</b> <b>Education</b> <b>Class</b> Climate Scale had a significant and positive relation between the other sub-dimensions except for the sub-dimension of ‘worries about the mistakes’. Furthermore, there was also a moderate, positive and significant relation between sub-dimensions of self-efficacy and perception of success of the students. It was determined that sense of self-efficacy has a mediator effect on task and ego orientation. It has been observed that while the mediator effect of self-efficacy of performance climate on task orientation is clear, the direct effect of self-efficacy on ego orientation is much more than its mediator effect...|$|R
