5|$|Another kind of <b>piezoelectric</b> {{transducer}} has the <b>piezoelectric</b> material sandwiched in longitudinally, usually {{into the}} resonator itself. This kind {{is good for}} torsional vibration modes and is called a torsional transducer.|$|E
5|$|One type of <b>piezoelectric</b> {{transducer}} is the Langevin type, {{named after}} a transducer used by Paul Langevin in early sonar research. This is good for longitudinal modes of vibration. It {{can also be used}} on resonators with other modes of vibration if the motion can be mechanically converted into a longitudinal motion. The transducer consists of a layer of <b>piezoelectric</b> material sandwiched transversally into a coupling rod or resonator.|$|E
5|$|<b>Piezoelectric</b> {{crystals}} {{are also}} sometimes used in mechanical filter designs. This {{is especially true}} for resonators that are also acting as transducers for inputs and outputs.|$|E
5|$|Among the tetrahedrally bonded semiconductors, it {{has been}} stated that ZnO has the highest <b>piezoelectric</b> tensor, {{or at least one}} {{comparable}} to that of GaN and AlN. This property makes it a technologically important material for many piezoelectrical applications, which require a large electromechanical coupling.|$|E
5|$|The term titanates usually {{refers to}} titanium(IV) compounds, as {{represented}} by barium titanate (BaTiO3). With a perovskite structure, this material exhibits <b>piezoelectric</b> properties and {{is used as a}} transducer in the interconversion of sound and electricity. Many minerals are titanates, e.g. ilmenite (FeTiO3). Star sapphires and rubies get their asterism (star-forming shine) from the presence of titanium dioxide impurities.|$|E
5|$|Electronic cigarette: Hon Lik, a Chinese pharmacist, is {{credited}} with {{the invention of the}} modern electronic cigarette. In 2003, he {{came up with the idea}} of using a <b>piezoelectric</b> ultrasound-emitting element to vaporise a pressurized jet of liquid containing nicotine diluted in a propylene glycol solution.This design produces a smoke-like vapour that can be inhaled and provides a vehicle for nicotine delivery into the bloodstream via the lungs. He also proposed using propylene glycol to dilute nicotine and placing it in a disposable plastic cartridge which serves as a liquid reservoir and mouthpiece.|$|E
25|$|Detection of {{pressure}} {{variations in the}} form of sound is the most common sensor application, e.g. <b>piezoelectric</b> microphones (sound waves bend the <b>piezoelectric</b> material, creating a changing voltage) and <b>piezoelectric</b> pickups for acoustic-electric guitars. A piezo sensor attached to the body of an instrument is known as a contact microphone.|$|E
25|$|A <b>piezo{{electric}}</b> motor or piezo motor {{is a type}} {{of electric}} motor based upon the change in shape of a <b>piezoelectric</b> material when an electric field is applied. <b>Piezoelectric</b> motors make use of the converse <b>piezoelectric</b> effect whereby the material produces acoustic or ultrasonic vibrations in order to produce a linear or rotary motion. In one mechanism, the elongation in a single plane is used to make a series stretches and position holds, similar to the way a caterpillar moves.|$|E
25|$|<b>Piezoelectric</b> {{materials}} {{also show}} the opposite effect, called the converse <b>piezoelectric</b> effect, where {{the application of}} an electrical field creates mechanical deformation in the crystal.|$|E
25|$|Currently, {{industrial}} and manufacturing {{is the largest}} application market for <b>piezoelectric</b> devices, followed by the automotive industry. Strong demand also comes from medical instruments {{as well as information}} and telecommunications. The global demand for <b>piezoelectric</b> devices was valued at approximately US$14.8billion in 2010. The largest material group for <b>piezoelectric</b> devices is piezocrystal, and piezopolymer is experiencing the fastest growth due to its low weight and small size.|$|E
25|$|The <b>piezoelectric</b> {{effect is}} {{understood}} as the linear electromechanical interaction between the mechanical and the electrical state in crystalline materials with no inversion symmetry. The <b>piezoelectric</b> effect is a reversible process in that materials exhibiting the direct <b>piezoelectric</b> effect (the internal generation of electrical charge resulting from an applied mechanical force) also exhibit the reverse <b>piezoelectric</b> effect (the internal generation of a mechanical strain resulting from an applied electrical field). For example, lead zirconate titanate crystals will generate measurable piezoelectricity when their static structure is deformed by about 0.1% of the original dimension. Conversely, those same crystals will change about 0.1% of their static dimension when an external electric field {{is applied to the}} material. The inverse <b>piezoelectric</b> effect is used in the production of ultrasonic sound waves.|$|E
25|$|<b>Piezoelectric</b> {{crystals}} or fibers {{generate a}} small voltage whenever they are mechanically deformed. Vibration from engines can stimulate <b>piezoelectric</b> materials, as can {{the heel of}} a shoe, or the pushing of a button.|$|E
25|$|Late in his life, Face became {{interested}} in <b>piezoelectric</b> technology, which led to his company's development of the Lightning Switch and other improvements and applications of <b>piezoelectric</b> actuators, generators and sensors... and Transoner transformers.|$|E
25|$|Common bells are {{mechanically}} struck, while MEMS resonators are electrically driven. There are two base technologies used {{to build}} MEMS resonators that differ in how electrical drive and sense signals are transduced from the mechanical motion. These are electrostatic and <b>piezoelectric.</b> All commercial MEMS oscillators use electrostatic transduction while MEMS filters use <b>piezoelectric</b> transduction. <b>Piezoelectric</b> resonators have not shown sufficient frequency stability or quality factor (Q) for frequency reference applications.|$|E
25|$|The use of {{piezoelectricity}} in sonar, and {{the success}} of that project, created intense development interest in <b>piezoelectric</b> devices. Over the next few decades, new <b>piezoelectric</b> materials and new applications for those materials were explored and developed.|$|E
25|$|<b>Piezoelectric</b> motors: <b>Piezoelectric</b> {{elements}} apply a directional {{force to}} an axle, {{causing it to}} rotate. Due to the extremely small distances involved, the piezo motor {{is viewed as a}} high-precision replacement for the stepper motor.|$|E
25|$|Zinc oxide (ZnO)–Wurtzite structure. While single {{crystals}} of ZnO are <b>piezoelectric</b> and pyroelectric, polycrystalline (ceramic) ZnO with randomly oriented grains exhibits neither <b>piezoelectric</b> nor pyroelectric effect. Not being ferroelectric, polycrystalline ZnO {{cannot be}} poled like barium titanate or PZT. Ceramics and polycrystalline thin films of ZnO may exhibit macroscopic piezoelectricity and pyroelectricity {{only if they}} are textured (grains are preferentially oriented), such that the <b>piezoelectric</b> and pyroelectric responses of all individual grains do not cancel. This is readily accomplished in polycrystalline thin films.|$|E
25|$|A <b>piezoelectric</b> {{potential}} can {{be created}} in any bulk or nanostructured semiconductor crystal having non central symmetry, such as the Group III–V and II–VI materials, due to polarization of ions under applied stress and strain. This property is common to both the zincblende and wurtzite crystal structures. To first order, {{there is only one}} independent <b>piezoelectric</b> coefficient in zincblende, called e14, coupled to shear components of the strain. In wurtzite, there are instead three independent <b>piezoelectric</b> coefficients: e31, e33 and e15.|$|E
25|$|Development of <b>piezoelectric</b> {{devices and}} {{materials}} in the United States was kept within the companies doing the development, mostly due to the wartime beginnings of the field, and {{in the interests of}} securing profitable patents. New materials were the first to be developed— quartz crystals were the first commercially exploited <b>piezoelectric</b> material, but scientists searched for higher-performance materials. Despite the advances in materials and the maturation of manufacturing processes, the United States market did not grow as quickly as Japan's did. Without many new applications, the growth of the United States' <b>piezoelectric</b> industry suffered.|$|E
25|$|In recent years, several {{attempts}} at the macro-scale {{application of the}} <b>piezoelectric</b> technology have emerged to harvest kinetic energy from walking pedestrians. The <b>piezoelectric</b> floors have been trialed {{since the beginning of}} 2007 in two Japanese train stations, Tokyo and Shibuya stations. The electricity generated from the foot traffic is used to provide all the electricity needed to run the automatic ticket gates and electronic display systems. In London, a famous nightclub exploited the <b>piezoelectric</b> technology in its dance floor. Parts of the lighting and sound systems in the club can be powered by the energy harvesting tiles. However, the <b>piezoelectric</b> tile deployed on the ground usually harvests energy from low frequency strikes provided by the foot traffic. This working condition may eventually lead to low power generation efficiency.|$|E
25|$|The <b>piezoelectric</b> effect {{converts}} {{mechanical strain}} into electric current or voltage. This strain {{can come from}} many different sources. Human motion, low-frequency seismic vibrations, and acoustic noise are everyday examples. Except in rare instances the <b>piezoelectric</b> effect operates in AC requiring time-varying inputs at mechanical resonance to be efficient.|$|E
25|$|<b>Piezoelectric</b> {{systems can}} convert motion {{from the human}} body into {{electrical}} power. DARPA has funded efforts to harness energy from leg and arm motion, shoe impacts, and blood pressure for low level power to implantable or wearable sensors. The nanobrushes are {{another example of a}} <b>piezoelectric</b> energy harvester. They can be integrated into clothing. Multiple other nanostructures have been exploited to build an energy-harvesting device, for example, a single crystal PMN-PT nanobelt was fabricated and assembled into a <b>piezoelectric</b> energy harvester in 2016. Careful design is needed to minimise user discomfort. These energy harvesting sources by association affect the body. The Vibration Energy Scavenging Project is another project that is set up to try to scavenge electrical energy from environmental vibrations and movements. Microbelt can be used to gather electricity from respiration. Besides, as the vibration of motion from human comes in three directions, a single <b>piezoelectric</b> cantilever based omni-directional energy harvester is created by using 1:2 internal resonance. Finally, a millimeter-scale <b>piezoelectric</b> energy harvester has also already been created.|$|E
25|$|Automotive engine {{management}} systems use <b>piezoelectric</b> transducers to detect Engine knock (Knock Sensor, KS), {{also known as}} detonation, at certain hertz frequencies. A <b>piezoelectric</b> transducer is also used in fuel injection systems to measure manifold absolute pressure (MAP sensor) to determine engine load, and ultimately the fuel injectors milliseconds of on time.|$|E
25|$|Barium {{titanate}} (BaTiO3)—Barium titanate was {{the first}} <b>piezoelectric</b> ceramic discovered.|$|E
25|$|The Curies, however, did {{not predict}} the {{converse}} <b>piezoelectric</b> effect. The converse effect was mathematically deduced from fundamental thermodynamic principles by Gabriel Lippmann in 1881. The Curies immediately confirmed {{the existence of}} the converse effect, and went on to obtain quantitative proof of the complete reversibility of electro-elasto-mechanical deformations in <b>piezoelectric</b> crystals.|$|E
25|$|Generally, {{there are}} 230 space groups among which 32 {{crystalline}} classes {{can be found}} in crystals. There are 21 non-centrosymmetric classes, within which 20 are <b>piezoelectric.</b> Among the <b>piezoelectric</b> classes, 10 have a spontaneous electric polarization, that varies with the temperature, therefore they are pyroelectric. Among pyroelectric materials, some of them are ferroelectric.|$|E
25|$|<b>Piezoelectric</b> {{materials}} {{are used in}} single-axis and dual-axis tilt sensing.|$|E
25|$|<b>Piezoelectric</b> microbalances {{are used}} as very {{sensitive}} chemical and biological sensors.|$|E
25|$|In this case, {{locating}} {{high traffic}} areas {{is critical for}} optimization of the energy harvesting efficiency, {{as well as the}} orientation of the tile pavement significantly affects the total amount of the harvested energy. A density flow evaluation is recommended to qualitatively evaluate the <b>piezoelectric</b> power harvesting potential of the considered area {{based on the number of}} pedestrian crossings per unit time. In X. Li's study, the potential application of a commercial <b>piezoelectric</b> energy harvester in a central hub building at Macquarie University in Sydney, Australia is examined and discussed. Optimization of the <b>piezoelectric</b> tile deployment is presented according to the frequency of pedestrian mobility and a model is developed where 3.1% of the total floor area with the highest pedestrian mobility is paved with <b>piezoelectric</b> tiles. The modelling results indicate that the total annual energy harvesting potential for the proposed optimized tile pavement model is estimated at 1.1MWh/year, which would be sufficient to meet close to 0.5% of the annual energy needs of the building. In Israel, there is a company which has installed <b>piezoelectric</b> materials under a busy highway. The energy generated is adequate and powers street lights, billboards and signs.|$|E
25|$|A <b>piezoelectric</b> {{transducer}} {{was used}} in the penetrometer instrument on the Huygens Probe.|$|E
25|$|<b>Piezoelectric</b> {{elements}} {{are also used}} in the detection and generation of sonar waves.|$|E
25|$|A strong shear <b>piezoelectric</b> {{activity}} {{was observed in}} self-assembled diphenylalanine peptide nanotubes (PNTs), indicating electric polarization directed along the tube axis. Comparison with LiNbO3 and lateral signal calibration yields sufficiently high effective <b>piezoelectric</b> coefficient values of at least 60pm/V (shear response for tubes of ≈200nm in diameter). PNTs demonstrate linear deformation without irreversible degradation in {{a broad range of}} driving voltages.|$|E
25|$|<b>Piezoelectric</b> {{ceramic fiber}} {{technology}} {{is being used}} as an electronic damping system on some HEAD tennis rackets.|$|E
25|$|A <b>piezoelectric</b> {{transformer}} {{is a type}} of AC voltage multiplier. Unlike {{a conventional}} transformer, which uses magnetic coupling between input and output, the <b>piezoelectric</b> transformer uses acoustic coupling. An input voltage is applied across a short length of a bar of piezoceramic material such as PZT, creating an alternating stress in the bar by the inverse <b>piezoelectric</b> effect and causing the whole bar to vibrate. The vibration frequency is chosen to be the resonant frequency of the block, typically in the 100kilohertz to 1megahertz range. A higher output voltage is then generated across another section of the bar by the <b>piezoelectric</b> effect. Step-up ratios of more than 1,000:1 have been demonstrated. An extra feature of this transformer is that, by operating it above its resonant frequency, it can be made to appear as an inductive load, which is useful in circuits that require a controlled soft start. These devices can be used in DC–AC inverters to drive cold cathode fluorescent lamps. Piezo transformers {{are some of the most}} compact high voltage sources.|$|E
25|$|An {{important}} {{ferroelectric material}} for applications is {{lead zirconate titanate}} (PZT), {{which is part of}} the solid solution formed between ferroelectric lead titanate and anti-ferroelectric lead zirconate. Different compositions are used for different applications; for memory applications, PZT closer in composition to lead titanate is preferred, whereas <b>piezoelectric</b> applications make use of the diverging <b>piezoelectric</b> coefficients associated with the morphotropic phase boundary that is found close to the 50/50 composition.|$|E
25|$|Since 2006, {{there have}} also been a number of reports of strong non linear <b>piezoelectric</b> effects in polar semiconductors.|$|E
