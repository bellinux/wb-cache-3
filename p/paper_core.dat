40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{critical}} buckling loads {{for various}} core densities and materials of honeycomb composite panels are experimentally and numerically investigated in this study. The surface plates of honeycomb composite panels are of polyester/glass fiber composite. Polyester resin-impregnated paper or aluminum {{is used as}} the honeycomb core material. Honeycomb panels with different cell sizes, but approximately the same volume, are produced {{and the effect of}} the honeycomb core density on the critical buckling load is investigated by compression tests. The critical buckling load of <b>paper</b> <b>core</b> panels is determined to be higher than that of aluminum core panels. It is seen that the buckling strength of the specimens increases by the increase of core density. As the critical buckling load exceeds a certain limit, regional core cell buckling and core crushing are seen in aluminum core panels. In <b>paper</b> <b>core</b> panels, regional cracks are seen, in addition to these failures. The study also calculates the numeric buckling loads of the panels using theANSYS finite element analysis program. The achieved experimental and numerical results are compared with each other and the results are provided in tables.

The plant located in Union Gap, Washington currently has two production lines operating 24 / 7 managed by 2 to 3 people. The heavy line produces 5000 to 10000 revolutions per roll. This production line has a three part system that automatically feeds the <b>paper</b> <b>cores</b> to the spool shafts {{to roll the}} films.

The drive of this project was to design and manufacture a similar Core Feeder that would automatically feed the cores to the table.

We demonstrate that the HICP sometimes seems to be a misleading indicator for monetary policy in the euro area.

In addition we provide evidence that our measure is a coincident indicator of HICP inflation. Assessing the robustness of our core inflation measure we carefully conclude that it seems to be quite reliable.

In this <b>paper,</b> <b>core</b> migration is performed on the varying size network graph model. The nodes within this ad hoc arrangement take on the values of the edge (W e) and node (W) randomly. With the varying numbers of iterations done on the core migration algorithm, every node and every edge picks up different random values. The migration of core node in wireless ad hoc network has been achieved by modeling the network in two different platform independent high-level languages viz. C++ and JAVA. Further, various techniques are proposed for the migration of core if needed. Keywords Core-based multicast, mobile ad hoc network, core based tree, core selection, core migration 1...|$|E
40|$|In recent years, the UK, {{like many}} other English first-language-speaking countries, has {{encountered}} a steady and continuous increase {{in the numbers of}} non-native English-speaking learners entering state primary and secondary schools. A significant proportion of these learners has specific language and subject learning needs, many of which can only be addressed by: (a) specialized teacher training courses and (b) the use of academically appropriate, context- and language-specific materials. At present, such materials are largely non-existent for use in primary school contexts across the country. This article addresses this gap and proposes a set of innovative classroom-based and take-home materials aiming to support the teaching and learning of science at Key Stage 2 of the English National Curriculum. The materials were developed as part of an intervention research project conducted over a period of 24 months (2013 – 2015) in four state primary schools in Sheffield with a varied density of English non-native-speaking learners. The materials were piloted with nearly 400 learners over a period of 10 months; the teachers were trained in using the materials prior to their trial. In this <b>paper</b> <b>core</b> features of the materials will be highlighted and their main functions discussed. Specific emphasis will be put on the following aspects: (a) support for language development, (b) support for subject knowledge development, (c) use of the first language in learning through the medium of a second language, (d) development of learner autonomy, and (f) promoting learning outside the classroom – making use of parental resources. The article will also argue that the proposed materials can be used equally effectively with non-native and native English-speaking learners...|$|E
