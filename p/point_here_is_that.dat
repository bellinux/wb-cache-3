Satisfying regulatory requirements will obviously take longer if the business lacks information or is unable to follow up promptly.

25|$|For example, if E is a vector bundle over X, {{then there}} is a bundle E* over X, called the dual bundle, whose fiber at x ∈ X is the dual vector space (Ex)*. Formally E* can be defined as the set of pairs (x, φ), where x ∈ X and φ ∈ (E'x)*. The dual bundle is locally trivial because the dual space of the inverse of a local trivialization of E is a local trivialization of E*: the key <b>point</b> <b>here</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> the {{operation}} of taking the dual vector space is functorial.|$|E
25|$|Generalizing from static {{electricity}} to electromagnetism, {{we have a}} second potential, the magnetic vector potential A, which can also undergo gauge transformations. These transformations may be local. That is, rather than adding a constant onto V, one can add a function that takes on different values {{at different points in}} space and time. If A is also changed in certain corresponding ways, then the same E and B fields result. The detailed mathematical relationship between the fields E and B and the potentials V and A is given in the article Gauge fixing, along with the precise statement {{of the nature of the}} gauge transformation. The relevant <b>point</b> <b>here</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> the fields remain the same under the gauge transformation, and therefore Maxwell's equations are still satisfied.|$|E

Since outputs become inputs, and inputs become outputs, critics alleged that unless input values are transformed in the calculation as well, the absurd mathematical effect in the model <b>is</b> <b>that</b> capitalist producers selling a good obtain a sale price that differs from the price paid by capitalist producers buying the same good.|$|R

2500|$|Scale and pitch: The {{standard}} pitch has varied widely over history, {{and this}} has affected how flutes are made. Although the standard concert pitch today is A4=440Hz, many manufacturers optimize the tone hole size/spacings for a higher pitch options such as A4=442Hz or A4=444Hz. (As noted above, adjustments to the pitch of one note, usually the A4 fingering, {{can be made by}} moving the headjoint {{in and out of the}} headjoint tenon, but the <b>point</b> <b>here</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> the mechanical relationship of A4 to all other pitches is set when the tone holes are cut. However, small deviations from the objective 'mechanical' pitch (which is related to acoustic impedance of a given fingering) can be made on the fly by embouchure adjustments.) ...|$|E

They cannot be wished away, which means that traditional societies {{are faced with a}} crucial choice: to adjust, to adapt or to risk steady decline and perhaps ultimate disappearance. Given this daunting paradigm, the genuine enthusiasm for America shown by our 21 Muslim guests was a heartening sign. They seemed impressed with the depth of our national commitment to human freedom and individual opportunity, and the stability of our institutions, both governmental and private. Several declared that exposure to America had reinforced their determination to work for social change in their own countries. Two Pakistani women, both law students, said they planned to devote their lives to fighting for broader women's rights at home. One young man said it was his ambition to become his country's prime minister.|$|E

As a matter of fact, it was a priory, and shared the fate of most priories--that is, the Tudor gentleman with the plumes simply stole it by brute force and turned it into his own private house; he did worse things, as you shall hear. But the <b>point</b> <b>here</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> this is how the trick works, and the trick works in the same way in {{the other part of the}} tale.

6000|$|But the {{converse}} need {{by no means}} be true. There {{is nothing in the}} nature of things to prevent an emigration of Turks increasing and multiplying on the plains where the Red Indians wandered; there is nothing to necessitate the Turks being extremely rare. The Red Indians, alas, are likely to be rarer. And as I much prefer Red Indians to Turks, not to mention Jews, I speak without prejudice; but the <b>point</b> <b>here</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> America, partly by original theory and partly by historical accident, does lie open to racial admixtures which most countries would think incongruous or comic. That is why it is only fair to read any American definitions or rules in a certain light, and relatively to a rather unique position. It is not fair to compare the position of those who may meet Turks in the back street with that of those who have never met Turks except in the Bab Ballads. It is not fair simply to compare America with England in its regulations about the Turk. In short, it is not fair to do what almost every Englishman probably does; to look at the American international examination paper, and laugh and be satisfied with saying, 'We don't have any of that nonsense in England.' ...|$|E
60|$|I {{could prove}} by many {{practical}} instances that even my illustrations are not exaggerated, by many placid proposals I have heard for the vivisection of criminals, {{or by the}} filthy incident of Dr. Neisser. But I prefer here to stick to a strictly logical line of distinction, and insist that whereas in all previous persecutions the violence was used to end our indecision, the whole <b>point</b> <b>here</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> the violence is used to end the indecision of the persecutors. This is what the honest Eugenists really mean, so far as they mean anything. They mean {{that the public is}} to be given up, not as a heathen land for conversion, but simply as a pabulum for experiment. That is the real, rude, barbaric sense behind this Eugenic legislation. The Eugenist doctors are not such fools as they look in the light of any logical inquiry about what they want. They do not know what they want, except that they want your soul and body and mine in order to find out. They are quite seriously, as they themselves might say, the first religion to be experimental instead of doctrinal. All other established Churches have been based on somebody having found the truth. This is the first Church that was ever based on not having found it.|$|E
60|$|A final instance, {{which can}} be sketched much more briefly, {{can be found in}} this general fact: that the {{definition}} of almost every crime has become more and more indefinite, and spreads like a flattening and thinning cloud over larger and larger landscapes. Cruelty to children, one would have thought, was a thing about as unmistakable, unusual and appalling as parricide. In its application it has come to cover almost every negligence that can occur in a needy household. The only distinction is, of course, that these negligences are punished in the poor, who generally can't help them, and not in the rich, who generally can. But that is not the point I am arguing just now. The <b>point</b> <b>here</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> a crime we all instinctively connect with Herod on the bloody night of Innocents has come precious near being attributable to Mary and Joseph when they lost their child in the Temple. In the light of a fairly recent case (the confessedly kind mother who was lately jailed because her confessedly healthy children had no water to wash in) no one, I think, will call this an illegitimate literary exaggeration. Now this is exactly as if all the horror and heavy punishment, attached in the simplest tribes to parricide, could now be used against any son who had done any act that could colourably be supposed to have worried his father, and so affected his health. Few of us would be safe.|$|E

6000|$|In short, the English ruler {{is always}} {{appealing}} {{to a nation}} of sportsmen and concentrating all his efforts on preventing them from having any sport. The Imperialist is always pointing out with exultation that the common Englishman can live by adventure anywhere on the globe, but if the common Englishman tries to live by adventure in England, he is treated as harshly as a thief, and almost as harshly as an honest journalist. This is hypocrisy: the magistrate who gives his son [...] "Treasure Island" [...] and then imprisons a tramp is a hypocrite; the squire who is proud of English colonists and indulgent to English schoolboys, but cruel to English poachers, is drawing near that deep place wherein all liars have their part. But our <b>point</b> <b>here</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> the baseness is {{in the idea of}} bewildering the tramp; of leaving him no place for repentance. It is quite true, of course, that in the days of slavery or of serfdom the needy were fenced by yet fiercer penalties from spoiling the hunting of the rich. But in the older case there were two very important differences, the second of which is our main subject in this chapter. The first is that in a comparatively wild society, however fond of hunting, it seems impossible that enclosing and game-keeping can have been so omnipresent and efficient as in a society full of maps and policemen. The second difference is the one already noted: that if the slave or semi-slave was forbidden to get his food in the greenwood, he was told to get it somewhere else. The note of unreason was absent.|$|E
6000|$|Remember, however, {{that to be}} {{breakable}} is not {{the same}} as to be perishable. Strike a glass, and it will not endure an instant; simply do not strike it, and it will endure a thousand years. Such, it seemed, was the joy of man, either in elfland or on earth; the happiness depended on NOT DOING SOMETHING which you could at any moment do and which, very often, it was not obvious why you should not do. Now, the <b>point</b> <b>here</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> to ME this did not seem unjust. If the miller's third son said to the fairy, [...] "Explain why I must not stand on my head in the fairy palace," [...] the other might fairly reply, [...] "Well, if it comes to that, explain the fairy palace." [...] If Cinderella says, [...] "How is it that I must leave the ball at twelve?" [...] her godmother might answer, [...] "How is it that you are going there till twelve?" [...] If I leave a man in my will ten talking elephants and a hundred winged horses, he cannot complain if the conditions partake of the slight eccentricity of the gift. He must not look a winged horse in the mouth. And it seemed to me that existence was itself so very eccentric a legacy that I could not complain of not understanding the limitations of the vision when I did not understand the vision they limited. The frame was no stranger than the picture. The veto might well be as wild as the vision; it might be as startling as the sun, as elusive as the waters, as fantastic and terrible as the towering trees.|$|E
6000|$|... (4) Don't say, [...] "There is no true creed; {{for each}} creed {{believes}} itself {{right and the}} others wrong." [...] Probably one of the creeds is right {{and the others are}} wrong. Diversity does show that most of the views must be wrong. It does not by the faintest logic show that they all must be wrong. I suppose there is no subject on which opinions differ with more desperate sincerity than about which horse will win the Derby. These are certainly solemn convictions; men risk ruin for them. The man who puts his shirt on Potosi must believe in that animal, and each of the other men putting their last garments upon other quadrupeds must believe in them quite as sincerely. They are all serious, {{and most of them are}} wrong. But one of them is right. One of the faiths is justified; one of the horses does win; not always even the dark horse which might stand for Agnosticism, but often the obvious and popular horse of Orthodoxy. Democracy has its occasional victories; and even the Favourite has been known to come in first. But the <b>point</b> <b>here</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> something comes in first. That there were many beliefs does not destroy the fact that there was one well-founded belief. I believe (merely upon authority) that the world is round. That there may be tribes who believe it to be triangular or oblong does not alter the fact that it is certainly some shape, and therefore not any other shape. Therefore I repeat, with the wail of imprecation, don't say that the variety of creeds prevents you from accepting any creed. It is an unintelligent remark.|$|E
