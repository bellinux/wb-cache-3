25|$|The {{aldehyde}} or ketone {{group of}} a straight-chain monosaccharide will react reversibly with a hydroxyl group {{on a different}} carbon atom to form a hemiacetal or hemiketal, forming a heterocyclic ring with an oxygen bridge between two carbon atoms. Rings with five and six atoms are called furanose and <b>pyranose</b> forms, respectively, and exist in equilibrium with the straight-chain form.|$|E
25|$|Sugar can be {{characterized}} by having reducing or non-reducing ends. A reducing end of a carbohydrate is a carbon atom that can be in equilibrium with the open-chain aldehyde (aldose) or keto form (ketose). If the joining of monomers takes place at such a carbon atom, the free hydroxy group of the <b>pyranose</b> or furanose form is exchanged with an OH-side-chain of another sugar, yielding a full acetal. This prevents opening of the chain to the aldehyde or keto form and renders the modified residue non-reducing. Lactose contains a reducing end at its glucose moiety, whereas the galactose moiety forms a full acetal with the C4-OH group of glucose. Saccharose {{does not have a}} reducing end because of full acetal formation between the aldehyde carbon of glucose (C1) and the keto carbon of fructose (C2).|$|E

40|$|This {{project is}} based on the {{chemical}} synthesis of fluorosaccharide end-products, which could be used potentially as substrates for the combinatorial biosynthesis of novel complex structures like antibiotics. Although fluorine is the most abundant halogen in the earth's crust, the incidence of fluorinated natural products is extremely low. There are no examples of fluorosaccharide end-product molecules in nature, so novel architecture will result from their incorporation within oligosaccharides or complex antibiotics. Introducing fluorine into pharmaceutical compounds can increase the biological activity and stability to metabolism. Enantiomerically enriched and racemic 6 -fluoro and racemic 6, 6 -difluoro analogues of amicetose and rhodinose have been synthesized successfully using different and scaleable strategies from commercially available starting materials. The equilibria between furanoses and <b>pyranoses</b> favoures the smaller rings, due to the inductive electron withdrawing effects of fluorine, so it was necessary to use protection to deliver <b>pyranoses</b> exclusively. Two very efficient new fluorinating methods have been developed, one with in situ cis/trans-isomerisation of a double bond with a mixture of TBAI and TBAF, and another one with high regioselective epoxides ring-opening with a mixture of KHF 2 and TBAF.
