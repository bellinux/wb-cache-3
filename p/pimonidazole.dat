METHODS: Biopsies were collected from individual tumors between approximately 3 and 25 hours after the intravenous injection of (64) Cu-ATSM and <b>pimonidazole.</b> (64) Cu-ATSM autoradiography and <b>pimonidazole</b> immunostaining was performed on sectioned biopsies. Acquired (64) Cu-ATSM autoradiography and <b>pimonidazole</b> images were rescaled, aligned and their distribution patterns compared. (64) Cu-ATSM and (18) FDG PET/CT scans were performed in a concurrent study and uptake characteristics were obtained for tumors where available. RESULTS: Maximum <b>pimonidazole</b> pixel value and mean <b>pimonidazole</b> labeled fraction was found to be strongly correlated to (18) FDG PET uptake levels, whereas more varying results were obtained for the comparison to (64) Cu-ATSM. In the case of the latter, uptake at scans performed 3 h post injection (pi) generally showed strong positive correlated to <b>pimonidazole</b> uptake. Comparison of distribution patterns of <b>pimonidazole</b> immunohistochemistry and (64) Cu-ATSM autoradiography yielded varying results. Significant positive correlations were mainly found in sections displaying a heterogeneous distribution of tracers. CONCLUSIONS: Tumors with high levels of <b>pimonidazole</b> staining generally displayed high uptake of (18) FDG and (64) Cu-ATSM (3 h pi.).

40|$|PURPOSE: To {{detect and}} {{quantify}} hypoxia in colorectal adenocarcinomas {{by use of}} <b>pimonidazole</b> and iododeoxyuridine (IdUrd) as extrinsic markers and carbonic anhydrase IX (CA IX), microvessel density (MVD), epidermal growth-factor receptor (EGFR), and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) as intrinsic markers of hypoxia. METHODS AND MATERIAL: Twenty patients with an adenocarcinoma of the left colon and rectum treated by primary surgery were injected with <b>pimonidazole</b> and IdUrd. Serial sections of tumor biopsies were single stained for VEGF, EGFR, Ki 67, and double stained for blood vessels in combination with either <b>pimonidazole,</b> IdUrd, or CA IX. Percentage of expression was scored as well as colocalization of <b>pimonidazole</b> with CA IX. RESULTS: The median percentage of hypoxia, as judged by <b>pimonidazole</b> staining, was 16. 7 % (range, 0 - 52. 4 %). The expression of <b>pimonidazole</b> correlated inversely with the total MVD and endothelial cord MVD (R = - 0. 55, p = 0. 01; R = - 0. 47, p = 0. 04). Good colocalization was found between <b>pimonidazole</b> and CA IX in only 30 % of tumors, with no correlation overall between <b>pimonidazole</b> and CA IX, VEGF, or EGFR or between the different intrinsic markers. Cells around some vessels (0. 08 - 11 %) were negative for IdUrd but positive for Ki 67, which indicated their lack of perfusion {{at the time of}} injection. CONCLUSION: Chronic and acute hypoxic regions are present in colorectal tumors, as shown by <b>pimonidazole</b> and IdUrd staining. Only in a minority of tumors did an association exist between the areas stained by <b>pimonidazole</b> and those positive for CA IX. <b>Pimonidazole</b> also did not correlate with expression of other putative intrinsic hypoxia markers (VEGF, EGFR) ...|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Hypoxia is {{a strong}} {{negative}} prognostic factor for all three major treatment modalities for cancer. The bioreductive drug <b>pimonidazole</b> is currently under clinical investigation as a hypoxia marker. In human head and neck tumors, in addition to staining patterns typical of chronic hypoxia, staining was seen specifically around areas of keratinization, raising {{the question of whether}} this is hypoxia-related. This could influence quantitative hypoxia estimates using this marker. We investigated here whether the differentiation-related staining was caused by locally high reductive enzyme levels. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The nitrotetrazolium compound NBT was used, which is reduced by nitroreductases to yield a blue color. The assay was validated on three genetically related MDA 231 human mammary carcinoma cell lines: wildtype, overexpressing DT-diaphorase (DT 1), and overexpressing cytochrome p 450 reductase (R 4). Increased NBT staining under normoxia was indeed seen for both R 4 and DT 1 lines. <b>Pimonidazole</b> staining under normoxia was only seen in the R 4 line. RESULTS: Frozen tumor sections from 20 patients with head and neck cancer injected with <b>pimonidazole</b> were incubated with NBT. Parallel sections were stained for <b>pimonidazole.</b> Staining patterns were then compared on matched images, and areas of keratinization scored for {{the presence or absence of}} <b>pimonidazole</b> and NBT. <b>Pimonidazole</b> staining was seen in 56 % of keratinized areas, and of these, 78 % showed increased NBT staining, indicating that high reductase levels are not a necessary requirement for differentiation-associated <b>pimonidazole</b> staining. In a second series, frozen sections of tumors from 15 patients not receiving <b>pimonidazole</b> were incubated with NBT and compared with staining after incubation with <b>pimonidazole</b> under both oxic and hypoxic conditions. <b>Pimonidazole</b> staining of some keratinizing areas under oxic conditions was seen. Of these areas, only a proportion (70 %) showed increased NBT staining, confirming the lack of correspondence between keratin-associated <b>pimonidazole</b> staining and reductase levels. CONCLUSION: Hypoxia-independent <b>pimonidazole</b> staining can occur in more differentiated head and neck tumors, necessitating caution in hypoxia quantification. These data argue against a causative role for locally high reductase levels in differentiation-associated staining. DT-diaphorase appears to play no role in <b>pimonidazole</b> reductio...|$|E
40|$|PURPOSE: Tumor hypoxia {{measured}} by microelectrodes {{has been shown}} to indicate poor patient outcome. Here we investigated four potentially more widely applicable immunohistochemical parameters of tumor oxygenation and perfusion in human head-and-neck tumors. METHODS: Twenty patients with squamous cell carcinomas {{of the head and neck}} treated with primary surgery were injected with <b>pimonidazole</b> and IdUrd the evening before operation. Consecutive paraffin-embedded sections were stained for blood vessels, <b>pimonidazole,</b> IdUrd, and HIF- 1 alpha. IdUrd labeling and Ki- 67 labeling around individual blood vessels were scored. The spatial relationship between HIF- 1 alpha and <b>pimonidazole</b> was studied, as well as the distribution of both markers as a function of distance from the nearest blood vessel. RESULTS: Measurement of all four parameters (diffusion-limited fraction, <b>pimonidazole</b> fraction, HIF- 1 alpha fraction, IdUrd-negative vessels) was feasible, and a significant difference between tumors was found for all parameters. IdUrd-labeled cells were absent around some vessels, indicating lack of perfusion, because these regions were positive for Ki- 67. There was a positive correlation between diffusion-limited fraction and <b>pimonidazole</b> area for all images from all tumors, although no correlation for mean values per tumor. Colocalization of <b>pimonidazole</b> and HIF- 1 alpha was low (0. 02 %- 25 %). Most expression profiles showed a more homogenous distribution for HIF- 1 alpha than <b>pimonidazole.</b> There was no significant correlation between the <b>pimonidazole</b> and HIF- 1 alpha fractions in the 10 tumors studied. CONCLUSIONS: Simultaneous immunohistochemical measurements related to hypoxia and perfusion are feasible (and easily applicable) in resected human tumors. The different geographic distributions of HIF- 1 alpha and <b>pimonidazole</b> indicate that HIF- 1 alpha might not be suitable as a marker for chronic hypoxia. Each parameter will be correlated with outcome in a larger ongoing study on head-and-neck tumors treated with surgery with or without postoperative radiotherap...|$|E

Positron emission tomography using (18) F-labeled misonidazole ([(18) F]FMISO) is a non-invasive method of imaging tumor hypoxia. Aim of this study was to validate [(18) F]FMISO against the clinically most widely used hypoxic cell marker <b>pimonidazole</b> under different oxygenation conditions. MATERIALS AND METHODS: One human head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (SCCNij 3) and two human glioblastoma (E 102 and E 106) xenograft tumor lines were studied after injection of [(18) F]FMISO and <b>pimonidazole.</b> Control mice were compared with a second group breathing carbogen to reduce tumor hypoxia and with a third group with clamped tumors to increase hypoxia. Tumor sections were analyzed on a phosphor imaging system and consecutively stained immunohistochemically (IHC) for visualization of <b>pimonidazole.</b> Pixel-by-pixel analysis was performed and the hypoxic fraction, obtained after segmentation of the <b>pimonidazole</b> signal, was related to the mean optical density of [(18) F]FMISO and <b>pimonidazole.</b> RESULTS: A moderate pixel-by-pixel correlation between [(18) F]FMISO autoradiography and <b>pimonidazole</b> IHC was found for the control tumors, after carbogen breathing and after clamping for SCCNij 3. For E 102 and E 106, mean signal intensities for <b>pimonidazole</b> significantly decreased after carbogen breathing and increased after clamping, mean [(18) F]FMISO signal intensities increased significantly after clamping and a significant correlation between the hypoxic fractions and the mean [(18) F]FMISO signal intensities was found. CONCLUSIONS: [(18) F]FMISO autoradiography and <b>pimonidazole</b> immunohistochemistry can both be used to visualize treatment induced changes in tumor hypoxia.

40|$|Hypoxia, or low oxygen concentration, is a {{key factor}} {{promoting}} tumor progression and angiogenesis and resistance of cancer to radiotherapy and chemotherapy. 2 -Nitroimidazole-based agents {{have been widely used}} in pathological and nuclear medicine examinations to detect hypoxic regions in tumors; in particular, <b>pimonidazole</b> is used for histochemical staining of hypoxic regions. It is considered to accumulate in hypoxic cells via covalent binding with macromolecules or by forming reductive metabolites after reduction of its nitro group. However, the detailed mechanism of its accumulation remains unknown. In this study, we investigated the accumulation mechanism of <b>pimonidazole</b> in hypoxic tumor tissues in a mouse model by mass spectrometric analyses including imaging mass spectrometry (IMS). <b>Pimonidazole</b> and its reductive metabolites were observed in the tumor tissues. However, their locations in the tumor sections were not similar to the positively stained areas in pimonidazole-immunohistochemistry, an area considered hypoxic. The glutathione conjugate of reduced <b>pimonidazole,</b> a low-molecular-weight metabolite of <b>pimonidazole,</b> was found in tumor tissues by LC-MS analysis, and our IMS study determined that the intratumor localization of the glutathione conjugate was consistent with the area positively immunostained for <b>pimonidazole.</b> We also found complementary localization of the glutathione conjugate and reduced glutathione (GSH), implying that formation of the glutathione conjugate occurred in the tumor tissue.

40|$|PURPOSE: To assess {{diffusion}} limited hypoxia {{in human}} tumors using image analysis of vasculature and {{to compare it}} with the bioreductive marker <b>pimonidazole</b> as an independent method. MATERIALS AND METHODS: To set up the method, nine rectal adenocarcinomas and ten squamous cell carcinomas were analyzed. To validate the method, ten squamous cell carcinomas of the cervix were analyzed from patients who were injected with <b>pimonidazole</b> and biopsied approximately 24 h later. Sections of the rectal and esophageal tumors were stained for vasculature, while cervix tumor sections were double stained for vasculature and <b>pimonidazole.</b> Tumor areas were delineated on digitized images, {{and the proportion of}} tumor tissue greater than a fixed distance from the nearest blood vessel (called diffusion limited fraction, DLF) was then calculated. The proportion of tumor area stained for <b>pimonidazole</b> was also measured. RESULTS: There was a wide variation between tumors in both the vascular-derived DLF and in the pimonidazole-stained fraction. Average DLFs varied between 1. 5 and 92 % for different tumors, with significant differences between them. The area stained by <b>pimonidazole</b> was significantly smaller than DLF for all tumors. The correlation between <b>pimonidazole</b> area and DLF was significant in three of seven tumors containing > or = 3 images. When images from all tumors (n= 123) were analyzed together, the correlation was highly significant (r= 0. 47, P< 0. 0001).

40|$|BACKGROUND: Intratumoral hypoxia {{plays an}} {{important}} role with regard to tumor biology and susceptibility to radio- and chemotherapy. For further investigation of hypoxia-related changes, areas of certain hypoxia must be reliably detected within cancer tissues. <b>Pimonidazole,</b> a 2 -nitroimindazole, accumulates in hypoxic tissue and can be easily visualized using immunohistochemistry. MATERIALS AND METHODS: To improve detection of highly hypoxic versus normoxic areas in prostate cancer, immunoreactivity of <b>pimonidazole</b> and a combination of known hypoxia-related proteins was used to create computational oxygen supply maps of prostate cancer. <b>Pimonidazole</b> was intravenously administered before radical prostatectomy in n = 15 patients, using the da Vinci robot-assisted surgical system. Prostatectomy specimens were immediately transferred into buffered formaldehyde, fixed overnight, and completely embedded in paraffin. <b>Pimonidazole</b> accumulation and hypoxia-related protein expression were visualized by immunohistochemistry. Oxygen supply maps were created using the normalized information from <b>pimonidazole</b> and hypoxia-related proteins. RESULTS: Based on <b>pimonidazole</b> staining and other hypoxia. related proteins (osteopontin, hypoxia-inducible factor 1 -alpha, and glucose transporter member 1) oxygen supply maps in prostate cancer were created. Overall, oxygen supply maps consisting of information from all hypoxia-related proteins showed high correlation and mutual information to the golden standard of <b>pimonidazole.</b> Here, we describe an improved computer-based ex vivo model for an accurate detection of oxygen supply in human prostate cancer tissue. CONCLUSIONS: This platform can be used for precise colocalization of novel candidate hypoxia-related proteins in a representative number of prostate cancer cases, and improve issues of single marker correlations.

40|$|<b>Pimonidazole</b> {{is finding}} {{increasing}} use in histochemical analyses of hypoxia in tumours. Whether it can identify every hypoxic cell in a tumour, {{and whether the}} usual subjective criteria used to define ‘positive’ cells are optimal, are less certain. Therefore, {{our aim was to}} develop an objective flow cytometry procedure for quantifying <b>pimonidazole</b> binding in tumours, and to validate this method by using a more direct indicator of radiobiologic hypoxia, the comet assay. SCCVII tumours in C 3 H mice were analysed for <b>pimonidazole</b> binding using flow cytometry and an iterative curve-fitting procedure, and the results were compared to the comet assay for the same cell suspensions. On average, cells defined as anoxic by flow analysis (n = 43 tumours) bound 10. 8 ± 0. 95 times more antibody than aerobic cells. In samples containing known mixtures of aerobic and anoxic cells, hypoxic fractions as low as 0. 5 % could easily be detected. To assess the flow cytometry assay under a wider range of tumour oxygen contents, mice were injected with hydralazine to reduce tumour blood flow, or allowed to breathe various gas mixtures during the 90  min exposure to <b>pimonidazole.</b> Hypoxic fraction estimated by the <b>pimonidazole</b> binding method agreed well with the hypoxic fraction measured using the comet assay in SCCVII tumours (r 2 = 0. 87, slope = 0. 98), with similar results in human U 87 glioma cells and SiHa cervical carcinoma xenografts. We therefore conclude that this objective analysis of <b>pimonidazole</b> labelling by flow cytometry gives a convenient and accurate estimate of radiobiological hypoxia.

There were three treatment groups: unrestrained controls, sham-treated and LTH treated mice. LTH had minimal effects on the acute toxicity (LD 50 / 7 d) of <b>pimonidazole</b> with {{no significant difference between}} the three treatment groups. Pharmacokinetic studies were carried out at the maximum tolerated dose (MTD; approximately 60 % LD 50) of 437 micrograms g- 1 i. v. in plasma, brain and tumour. Sham tumour treatment consistently increased plasma drug concentrations compared to unrestrained controls but had minimal effects on the elimination t 1 / 2. The AUC 0 -infinitive was increased by 35 % and the plasma clearance decreased by 26 %. By contrast, LTH had minimal effects on these parameters compared to sham treatment. Brain <b>pimonidazole</b> concentrations were increased in restrained mice (sham and LTH treatments) compared to unrestrained controls, but average brain/plasma ratios were similar in all three groups at between 400 and 500 %. Sham tumour treatment markedly reduced peak tumour <b>pimonidazole</b> concentrations compared to unrestrained controls giving a 29 % lower AUC 0 - 180 min.

40|$|BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: To {{evaluate}} erythropoietin receptor (EPOR) {{expression in}} human {{head and neck}} squamous cell carcinomas and correlate this {{to the presence of}} tumor hypoxia and treatment outcome. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Eighty-five patients with locally advanced tumors {{of the head and neck}} were included. Of these, 34 were given the hypoxia marker <b>pimonidazole</b> i. v. 2 h prior to biopsy taking. Contiguous paraffin embedded biopsies were stained for EPOR expression and, if administered, for <b>pimonidazole</b> binding. Immunohistochemical staining for EPOR was interpreted semiquantitatively according to a composite scale, ranging from 0 to 200. <b>Pimonidazole</b> positivity was quantitatively analyzed in a semiautomatic way. RESULTS: Diffuse weak-to-moderate cytoplasmic and membrane EPOR immunostaining was observed in 80 of 85 biopsies (94 %) and staining scores ranged from 0 to 198 (median 100). No correlations were found between EPOR expression, and the primary tumor site, T-stage or N-stage. Also, There was no association between EPOR expression and treatment outcome. The degree of tumor hypoxia represented by the relative area of <b>pimonidazole</b> binding varied between 0 and 26 % (median 7 %). Contiguous biopsy sections showed a lack of colocalization between EPOR and <b>pimonidazole</b> binding. CONCLUSION: EPOR expression was demonstrated in the majority of the head and neck tumors. No colocalization was found between EPOR expression and <b>pimonidazole</b> binding indicating that the presence or absence of hypoxia did not necessarily indicate a distinct pattern of EPOR expression.

40|$|Hypoxia {{is thought}} to be {{critical}} in regulating physiological processes within the female reproductive system, including ovulation, composition of the fluid in the oviductal/uterine lumens and ovarian follicle development. This study examined the localisation of exogenous (<b>pimonidazole)</b> and endogenous [hypoxia inducible factor 1 ? and 2 ? (HIF 1 ?, - 2 ?), glucose transporter type 1 (GLUT 1) and carbonic anhydrase 9 (CAIX) ] hypoxia-related antigens within the oviduct and uterus of the rat reproductive tract. The extent to which each endogenous antigen co-compartmentalised with <b>pimonidazole</b> was also assessed. Female Wistar Furth rats (n = 10) were injected intraperitoneally with <b>pimonidazole</b> (60 mg/kg) 1 h prior to death. Reproductive tissues were removed immediately following death and fixed in 4 % paraformaldehyde before being embedded in paraffin. Serial sections were cut (6 - 7 ?m thick) and antigens of interest identified using standard immunohistochemical procedures. The mucosal epithelia of the ampulla, isthmus and uterus were immunopositive for <b>pimonidazole</b> in most sections. Co-compartmentalisation of <b>pimonidazole</b> with HIF 1 ? was only expressed in the mucosa of the uterus whilst co-compartmentalisation with HIF 2 ? was observed in the mucosa of the ampulla, isthmus and uterus. Both GLUT 1 and CAIX were co-compartmentalised with <b>pimonidazole</b> in mucosa of the isthmus and uterus. This study confirms that mucosal regions of the rat oviduct and uterus frequently experience severe hypoxia and there are compartment specific variations in expression of endogenous hypoxia-related antigens, including the HIF isoforms.

40|$|Tumour hypoxia as {{driving force}} in tumour {{progression}} and treatment resistance has been well established. Assessment of oxygenation status of tumours may provide important prognostic information and improve selection of patients for treatment. In this study, a large homogenous group of 103 laryngeal carcinomas has been investigated {{in the presence of}} hypoxia by <b>pimonidazole</b> binding and the usefulness of Carbonic anhydrase IX (CA-IX) and vascular parameters as surrogate markers of hypoxia. These parameters are further related to clinical and biological characteristics. One hundred and three patients with T 2 -T 4 larynx carcinoma were included. They were given the hypoxia marker <b>pimonidazole</b> intravenously (i. v.) 2 h prior to taking a biopsy. Expression of all the parameters was examined by immunohistochemistry, excluding large necrotic areas. Among tumours a large variation in <b>pimonidazole</b> positivity (hypoxic fraction based on <b>pimonidazole,</b> HFpimo) (range 0 - 19 %) and CA-IX expression (hypoxic fraction based on CA-IX staining, HFCA-IX) (range 0 - 34 %) was observed. In 67 % of the tumours, hypoxia involved 1 % of the viable tumour area. HFpimo and HFCA-IX correlated significantly albeit weak (p= 0. 04). Both parameters showed weak inverse correlations with the relative vascular area (RVA) (p= 0. 01). HFpimo was further associated with histopathological grade, with poorly differentiated tumours being more hypoxic. The fraction of the tumour area positive for both <b>pimonidazole</b> and CA-IX correlated significantly with N stage. From these results, it was concluded that CA-IX and RVA have only limited value for measuring hypoxia and are not as robust as <b>pimonidazole,</b> probably due to the influence of other factors in the microenvironment.

Expression of all markers was compared with expression of <b>pimonidazole</b> and micro-vessel density (MVD) and with disease free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS). Results: No correlation {{was found between the}} different intrinsic hypoxia markers tested and <b>pimonidazole.</b> A trend for high MCT 1 expression in biopsies with low CA-IX expression was found (R=- 0. 45, p= 0. 06) and also the expression of MCT 1 was higher in tumours with a high MVD (R= 0. 49, p= 0. 04). The more advanced tumours showed a higher expression of GLUT- 1 (p= 0. 03). A low CA-IX expression in the tumour correlated with better DFS (p= 0. 03) and related to better OS (p= 0. 07).

40|$|We {{describe}} our {{preliminary studies}} {{on the development of}} methods to measure hypoxia in standard paraffin sections of human tumors. Three parameters were investigated. First, image analysis of tumor vascularity yielded the parameter diffusion limited fraction (DLF), which is the amount of tumor tissue greater than a fixed distance from the nearest blood vessel. Secondly, the amount of tumor tissue stained with antibodies against bound reduced products of the bioreductive marker <b>pimonidazole</b> was assessed. Finally, the fraction of blood vessels showing no surrounding tumor tissue labeled with lUdR, a cell kinetic marker, was measured. DLF and <b>pimonidazole</b> monitor primarily chronic hypoxia, while it is hypothesized that the IUdR-negative fraction monitors acute hypoxia. Feasibility was demonstrated in a series of 10 esophageal and 10 rectal tumors (no drug administration), 10 cervix tumors (<b>pimonidazole)</b> and 14 head and neck tumors (<b>pimonidazole</b> and lUdR). Significant differences between tumors were found for all parameters. DLF correlated significantly with the <b>pimonidazole</b> fraction when all images of all tumors were included, although mean values per tumor showed no correlation. The IUdR-negative fraction did not correlate with either of the other two parameters. We conclude that it is feasible to measure hypoxia-related, and possibly perfusion-related, parameters on paraffin sections for predictive purposes, although each method needs further validation.

40|$|Summary We have {{investigated}} the effects of localised tumour hyperthermia (LTH; 43. 5 °C x 30 min) on the acute toxicity and pharmacokinetics of the hypoxic cell sensitizer <b>pimonidazole</b> (Ro 03 - 8799) in mice. There were three treatment groups: unrestrained controls, sham-treated and LTH treated mice. LTH had minimal effects on the acute toxicity (LD 5 o/ 7 d) of <b>pimonidazole</b> with {{no significant difference between}} the three treatment groups. Pharmacokinetic studies were carried out at the maximum tolerated dose (MTD;- 60 % LD 50) of 437 pgg- 1 i. v. in plasma, brain and tumour. Sham tumour treatment consistently increased plasma drug concentrations compared to unrestrained controls but had minimal effects on the elimination t 1 / 2. The AUC 0 _ was increased by 35 % and the plasma clearance decreased by 26 %. By contrast, LTH had minimal effects on these parameters compared to sham treatment. Brain <b>pimonidazole</b> concentrations were increased in restrained mice (sham and LTH treatments) compared to unrestrained controls, but average brain/plasma ratios were similar in all three groups at between 400 and 500 %. Sham tumour treatment markedly reduced peak tumour <b>pimonidazole</b> concentrations compared to unrestrained controls giving a 29 % lower AUCo- 180 min. Average tumour/plasma ratios were reduced from 236 to 129 %. The most important finding was that LTH further reduced <b>pimonidazole</b> tumour concentrations, giving a 31 % lower AUCo- 180 mi...|$|E
40|$|The endothelin- 1 antagonist, atrasentan (ABT- 627) {{was used}} to modify {{perfusion}} in the human tumor xenograft model, HT 29, growing in nude mice. Atrasentan produced {{a significant increase in}} perfusion, as measured in vivo by Gd-DTPA DCE-MRI. Changes in tumor hypoxia were assessed by comparing the binding of two hypoxia tracers, <b>pimonidazole</b> and EF 5 given before and after Atrasentan administration. In vehicle-treated controls, the distribution of EF 5 and <b>pimonidazole</b> was very similar. However, Atrasentan treatment was associated with decreased uptake of the second hypoxia tracer (EF 5), relative to the first (<b>pimonidazole).</b> Although Atrasentan had no independent effect on the growth of HT 29 tumors, Atrasentan combined with 20 Gy radiation led to a modest but significant increase in tumor growth delay compared to radiation alone. close 2...|$|E
40|$|Nitroimidazole {{markers of}} tumour hypoxia bind to normoxic liver and the {{question}} has been raised whether {{this is due to}} low oxygen concentration or microregional activity of specialised nitroreductases. To answer this question, the binding patterns of the 2 -nitroimidazole, <b>pimonidazole,</b> were compared following perfusion of surgically isolated rat livers in anterograde and retrograde directions. Perfusion at low flow rates in anterograde or retrograde directions can be used intentionally to alter oxygen gradients without altering enzyme distributions. Perfusion by means of the portal vein (anterograde direction) produced <b>pimonidazole</b> binding in the pericentral region of liver similar to that observed for <b>pimonidazole</b> binding in vivo. A complete reversal of this binding pattern occurred when the isolated liver was perfused by way of the central vein (retrograde direction). In this case, <b>pimonidazole</b> binding occurred in the periportal region. The extent and intensity of binding in the periportal region during perfusion in the retrograde direction was similar to that in the pericentral region during perfusion in the anterograde direction. It is concluded that low oxygen concentration rather than the non-homogeneous distribution of nitroreductase activity is the primary determinant of 2 -nitroimidazole binding in liver...|$|E

40|$|An early but {{transient}} {{decrease in}} oxygen availability occurs during experimentally induced seizures. Using <b>pimonidazole,</b> which probes hypoxic insults, {{we found that}} by increasing the duration of pilocarpine-induced status epilepticus (SE) from 30 min to 120 min, counts of pimonidazole-immunoreactive neurons also increased (P < 0. 01, 120 vs 60 and 30 min). All the animals exposed to SE were immunopositive to <b>pimonidazole,</b> but a different scenario emerged during epileptogenesis when a decrease in <b>pimonidazole</b> immunostained cells occurred from 7 to 14 days, so that only 1 out of 4 rats presented with pimonidazole-immunopositive cells. Pimonidazole-immunoreactive cells robustly reappeared at 21 days post-SE induction when all animals (7 out of 7) had developed spontaneous recurrent seizures. Specific neuronal markers revealed that immunopositivity to <b>pimonidazole</b> was present in cells identified by neuropeptide Y (NPY) or somatostatin antibodies. At variance, neurons immunopositive to parvalbumin or cholecystokinin were not immunopositive to <b>pimonidazole.</b> Pimonidazoleimmunopositive neurons expressed remarkable immunoreactivity to hypoxia-inducible factor 1 α (HIF- 1 α). Interestingly, surgical samples obtained from pharmacoresistant patients showed neurons co-labeled by HIF- 1 α and NPY antibodies. These interneurons, along with parvalbumin-positive interneurons that were negative to HIF- 1 α, showed immunopositivity to markers of cell damage, such as high-mobility group box 1 in the cytoplasm and cleaved caspase- 3 in the nucleus. These findings suggest that interneurons are continuously endangered in rodent and human epileptogenic tissue. The presence of hypoxia and cell damage markers in NPY interneurons of rats and patients presenting with recurrent seizures indicates a mechanism of selective vulnerability in a specific neuronal subpopulation...|$|E
40|$|Hypoxia is {{associated}} with tumor aggressiveness and is an important cause of resistance to radiation treatment. Assays of tumor hypoxia could provide selection tools for hypoxia-modifying treatments. This study correlated the exogenous 2 -nitroimidazole hypoxia marker 1 -[(2 -hydroxy- 3 -piperidinyl) propyl]- 2 -nitroimidazole hydrochloride (<b>pimonidazole)</b> with the endogenous hypoxia-related marker carbonic anhydrase 9 (CA 9) and with vascular parameters using immunohistochemical techniques and a computerized image analysis system. Tumor biopsies were obtained from patients with head and neck carcinomas that were potential candidates for a Phase II trial with accelerated radiotherapy combined with carbogen and nicotinamide (ARCON). If, after completion of the diagnostic workup, the eligibility criteria were met and informed consent was obtained, patients were treated with ARCON. Those patients that were not eligible or refused ARCON were treated with radiotherapy, surgery, or a combined modality. Forty-three biopsies were analyzed, {{and the results were}} related with treatment outcome. The distribution patterns of <b>pimonidazole</b> and CA 9 were similar, although the CA 9 signal was generally observed already at shorter distances from blood vessels. There was a weak but significant correlation between the relative tumor areas positive for <b>pimonidazole</b> binding and areas with CA 9 expression. Locoregional tumor control was significantly lower for patients who had hypoxic tumors or tumors with low vascular density. The 2 -year control rates were 48 versus 87 % for tumors with high and low <b>pimonidazole</b> binding levels (stratified by median, P = 0. 01) and 48 and 88 % for tumors with low and high vascular density (stratified by median, P = 0. 01). These associations disappeared in the subgroup of patients treated with ARCON. There was no relationship between the level of CA 9 expression and treatment outcome. It is concluded that <b>pimonidazole</b> binding and vascular density can predict treatment outcome in head and neck cancer and may be useful as selection tools for hypoxia-modifying treatments. <b>Pimonidazole</b> and CA 9 demonstrate concordant staining patterns, but the latter is a less specific marker for hypoxia...|$|E
40|$|Hypoxia {{in solid}} tumors occurs when {{metabolic}} demands in tumor cells surpass {{the delivery of}} oxygenated blood. We hypothesize that the 18 F-fluorodeoxyglucose (18 F-FDG) metabolism and tumor blood flow mismatch would correlate with tumor hypoxia. Liver perfusion computed tomography (CT) and 18 F-FDG positron emission tomography (PET) imaging were performed in twelve rabbit livers implanted with VX 2 carcinoma. Under CT guidance, a fiber optic probe was inserted into the tumor to measure the partial pressure of oxygen (pO 2). Tumor blood flow (BF) and standardized uptake value (SUV) were measured to calculate flow-metabolism ratio (FMR). Tumor hypoxia was further identified using <b>pimonidazole</b> immunohistochemical staining. Pearson correlation analysis was performed to determine {{the correlation between the}} imaging parameters and pO 2 and <b>pimonidazole</b> staining. Weak correlations were found between blood volume (BV) and pO 2 level (r = 0. 425, P = 0. 004), SUV and pO 2 (r = - 0. 394, P = 0. 007), FMR and <b>pimonidazole</b> staining score (r = - 0. 388, P = 0. 031). However, there was stronger correlation between tumor FMR and pO 2 level (r = 0. 557, P < 0. 001).

40|$|Introduction: As most tumors, HNSCC (Head and Neck Squamous Cell Carcinoma) arises as a {{consequence}} of multiple cumulative genetic alterations. This genomic instability is partly induced by the tumoral micro-environment of which hypoxia is a characteristic pathophysiologic parameter. Hypoxia can be measured by extrinsic markers like <b>pimonidazole.</b> Genomic instability is, amongst others, characterized by MSI (microsatellite instability) and LOH (loss of heterozygosity). MSI arises as {{a consequence}} of a deficient DNA MMR (mismatch repair) system leading to an accelerated accumulation of nucleotide mutations and changes in length of short, repetitive microsatellite sequences which are spread throughout the entire genome. LOH is another feature of genomic instability, being a mechanism to inactivate tumor suppressor genes. The aim of the project was to find out if a correlation exists between MSI/LOH and <b>pimonidazole</b> and to evaluate the prognostic value of both parameters. Materials and methods: 57 patients with HNSCC were included so far, of which 27 are already evaluated. For the evaluation of tumoral hypoxia, we used immunohistochemical stainings for <b>pimonidazole</b> on paraffin embedded material coming from the resection specimen. Multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR) with 14 fluorescence-labeled forward primers selected from literature was used to assess MSI and LOH. The obtained fragments were analyzed by the ABI PRISM 3100 genetic analyzer. Results: We found LOH in 1 marker in 11. 1 % of all patients (3 / 27). LOH in two or more markers was found in 29. 6 % (8 / 27). MSI in 1 marker was found in 14. 8 % of all patients (4 / 27), while MSI in 2 or more markers was found in 7. 4 % (2 / 27). There was a correlation between <b>pimonidazole</b> and N-stage (p = 0. 020) and disease-stage (p = 0. 047). LOH was significantly associated with N-stage (p = 0. 034) and disease-stage (p = 0. 044). No correlation was found between <b>pimonidazole</b> and outcome. Patients expressing either MSI or LOH had a poorer outcome than patients without these genomic alterations (NS). Finally, patients with either MSI or LOH tended to have higher <b>pimonidazole</b> values (NS). Conclusion: In this prospective study on genomic instability in 27 patients with HNSCC treated by surgery we could see a trend for a correlation between MSI/LOH and outcome, and MSI/LOH and <b>pimonidazole.</b> We will try to validate these findings in a total of 57 patients. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|Hypoxyprobe TM staining. Hypoxyprobe TM (<b>pimonidazole</b> {{hydrochloride}} [1]) staining {{was performed}} {{according to the}} manufacturer's instruction (60 mg/kg body, Chemicon).

Methods: 20 biopsies of advanced head and neck carcinomas were immunohistochemically stained and analyzed. All patients were given the hypoxia marker <b>pimonidazole</b> intravenously 2 h prior to biopsy taking.

40|$|Two {{mechanisms}} of radiotherapy resistance of major importance in {{head and neck}} cancer are tumour cell repopulation and hypoxia. Hypoxic tumour cells that retain their clonogenic potential can survive radiation treatment and lead to local recurrences. The {{aim of this study}} was to quantify this cellular population in a cohort of human head and neck carcinomas and to investigate the prognostic significance. The proliferation marker iododeoxyuridine (IdUrd) and the hypoxia marker <b>pimonidazole</b> were administered intravenously prior to biopsy taking in patients with stage II-IV squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck. Triple immunohistochemical staining of blood vessels, IdUrd and <b>pimonidazole</b> was performed and co-localization of IdUrd and <b>pimonidazole</b> was quantitatively assessed by computerized image analysis. The results were related with treatment outcome. Thirty-nine biopsies were analyzed. Tumours exhibited different patterns of proliferation and hypoxia but generally the IdUrd signal was found in proximity to blood vessels whereas <b>pimonidazole</b> binding was predominantly at a distance from vessels. Overall, no correlations were found between proliferative activity and oxygenation status. The fraction of IdUrd-labelled cells positive for <b>pimonidazole</b> ranged from 0 % to 16. 7 % with a mean of 2. 4 % indicating that proliferative activity was low in hypoxic areas and occurring mainly in the well-oxygenated tumour compartments. IdUrd positive cells in hypoxic areas made up only 0. 09 % of the total viable tumour cell mass. There were no associations between the magnitude of this cell population and local tumour control or survival. Co-localization between proliferating cells and hypoxia in head and neck carcinomas was quantified using an immunohistochemical triple staining technique combined with a computerized simultaneous analysis of multiple parameters. The proportion of cells proliferating under hypoxic conditions was small and no correlation with treatment outcome could be found...|$|E

(99 m) Tc-BRU 59 - 21 was administered intravenously (mean dose 824 MBq, range 780 - 857 MBq) to ten head and neck cancer patients scheduled for primary surgery, and whole-body images and SPET scans were then obtained. Uptake of radioactivity in the regions of interest was determined and tumour to normal tissue ratios were calculated after correlative evaluation with MRI/CT. Twelve to 16 h before surgery (up to 2 weeks after the scan), patients received <b>pimonidazole</b> intravenously. Tumour sections were stained immunohistochemically for <b>pimonidazole</b> binding. No serious adverse events were reported. In five patients there were ten adverse events, which were mild in intensity and resolved completely without intervention. Uptake of (99 m) Tc-BRU 59 - 21 was observed in eight of the ten primary tumours. Tumour to normal tissue ratios on the SPET scans for primary tumour and lymph nodes increased from 1. 8 (range 0. 9 - 2. 7) to 2. 1 (range 0. 8 - 3. 7) between 30 min and 3 h post injection. Tumour to normal tissue ratios in the primary tumour were significantly correlated with <b>pimonidazole</b> staining for SPET scans performed 30 min and 3 h post injection (P= 0. 016 and P= 0. 037, respectively).

40|$|PURPOSE: Hypoxia is {{detected}} in most solid tumors and {{is associated with}} malignant progression and adverse treatment outcomes. However, the oxygenation status of malignant salivary gland tumors has not been previously studied. The {{aim of this study}} was to investigate the potential clinical relevance of hypoxia in this tumor type. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Twelve patients scheduled for surgical resection of a salivary gland tumor were preoperatively injected with the hypoxia marker <b>pimonidazole</b> and the proliferation marker iododeoxyuridine. Tissue samples of the dissected tumor were immunohistochemically stained for blood vessels, <b>pimonidazole,</b> carbonic anhydrase-IX, glucose transporters- 1 and - 3 (Glut- 1, Glut- 3), hypoxia-inducible factor- 1 alpha, iododeoxyuridine, and epidermal growth factor receptor. The tissue sections were quantitatively assessed by computerized image analysis. RESULTS: The tissue material from 8 patients was of sufficient quality for quantitative analysis. All tumors were negative for <b>pimonidazole</b> binding, as well as for carbonic anhydrase-IX, Glut- 1, Glut- 3, and hypoxia-inducible factor- 1 alpha. The vascular density was high, with a median value of 285 mm(- 2) (range, 209 - 546). The iododeoxyuridine-labeling index varied from < 0. 1 % to 12. 2 % (median, 2. 2 %). Epidermal growth factor receptor expression levels were mostly moderate to high. In one-half of the cases, nuclear expression of epidermal growth factor receptor was observed.
