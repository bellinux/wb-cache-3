25|$|Resonance {{is simple}} to {{understand}} if {{the spring and}} mass are viewed as energy storage elements – with the mass storing kinetic energy and the spring storing potential energy. As discussed earlier, when the mass and spring have no external force acting on them they transfer energy back and forth at a rate equal to the natural frequency. In other words, to efficiently <b>pump</b> <b>energy</b> into both mass and spring requires that the energy source feed the energy in at a rate equal to the natural frequency. Applying a force to the mass and spring is similar to pushing a child on swing, a push is needed at the correct moment to make the swing get higher and higher. As {{in the case of}} the swing, the force applied need not be high to get large motions, but must just add energy to the system.|$|E
25|$|Dense {{wavelength}} division multiplexing (DWDM) refers originally to optical signals multiplexed {{within the}} 1550nm band so as to leverage the capabilities (and cost) of erbium doped fiber amplifiers (EDFAs), which are effective for wavelengths between approximately 1525–1565nm (C band), or 1570–1610nm (L band). EDFAs were originally developed to replace SONET/SDH optical-electrical-optical (OEO) re-generators, which they have made practically obsolete. EDFAs can amplify any optical signal in their operating range, regardless of the modulated bit rate. In terms of multi-wavelength signals, {{so long as the}} EDFA has enough <b>pump</b> <b>energy</b> available to it, it can amplify as many optical signals as can be multiplexed into its amplification band (though signal densities are limited by choice of modulation format). EDFAs therefore allow a single-channel optical link to be upgraded in bit rate by replacing only equipment at the ends of the link, while retaining the existing EDFA or series of EDFAs through a long haul route. Furthermore, single-wavelength links using EDFAs can similarly be upgraded to WDM links at reasonable cost. The EDFA's cost is thus leveraged across as many channels as can be multiplexed into the 1550nm band.|$|E

50|$|The {{gain medium}} of a laser is {{normally}} a material of controlled purity, size, concentration, and shape, which amplifies the beam {{by the process}} of stimulated emission described above. This material can be of any state: gas, liquid, solid, or plasma. The gain medium absorbs <b>pump</b> <b>energy,</b> which raises some electrons into higher-energy ("excited") quantum states. Particles can interact with light by either absorbing or emitting photons. Emission can be spontaneous or stimulated. In the latter case, the photon is emitted {{in the same direction as}} the light that is passing by. When the number of particles in one excited state exceeds the number of particles in some lower-energy state, population inversion is achieved and the amount of stimulated emission due to light that passes through is larger than the amount of absorption. Hence, the light is amplified. By itself, this makes an optical amplifier. When an optical amplifier is placed inside a resonant optical cavity, one obtains a laser oscillator.|$|E

40|$|Minimization of <b>pumping</b> <b>energy</b> is a {{major concern}} for {{designing}} sustainable water supply in buildings. Modular designs of tree-shaped water supply piping system, such as 2 by N array include water cisterns of water closet in public toilets, washbasin taps in schools are commonly found in building complexes. Potable water demands in water systems serving built environment are unsteady, random and intermittent. However, the existing statistical Hunter-based probabilistic approaches to pipe sizing, however, do not consider the minimization of <b>pumping</b> <b>energy</b> for water distribution through proper selection of pipe radii. This paper demonstrates a pipe sizing method with probabilistic demands for optimizing pipe friction energy loss constrained by the fixed pipeline volume.

Compared with the Hunter’s based probabilistic approach in sizing an 8 -section tree-shape water supply network for demand of probabilities 0. 1 and 0. 2, the proposed method offers reduction potentials of pipe friction energy loss of 12 % and 43 % respectively.

It is now well established that leakage is directly proportional to the pressure at the leak point in a pipe such that a pressure drop is inevitable. In order to compensate this drop in pressure, the <b>pumping</b> <b>energy</b> required to supply demand at a constant pressure has to be increased. How much more energy is required depends on the type and extent of the leak. For the 3 types of simulated leaks namely: orifice, circumferential and longitudinal slits with the same area of discharge, it is found that the excess <b>pumping</b> <b>energy</b> required for a circumferential crack in the pipe is the highest, followed by the orifice and then longitudinal slit {{as a result of the}} discharge to sustain customer demand and pressure head.
