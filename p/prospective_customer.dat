5|$|As the Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-21 {{became more}} common, the U.S. Air Force {{initiated}} the International Fighter Aircraft (IFA) program {{to provide an}} equivalent to allies. The USAF desired a light weight fighter with competitive performance to the MiG, inexpensive when purchased in large numbers, and with reasonable operating costs for <b>prospective</b> <b>customer</b> nations. Although numerous companies entered designs, Northrop's existing F-5 {{put them in a}} leading position. They submitted an upgrade, the F-5E Tiger II, with the AN/APQ-153 radar and other changes to allow the AIM-9 Sidewinder missile to be fired from wing-tip rails. On 20 November 1970, Northrop's entry was announced as the IFA winner. Northrop produced a total of 1,399 F-5E/F Tiger IIs by the time manufacturing ended in 1986.|$|E
25|$|Sodium carbonate, {{also known}} as soda ash, is an {{effective}} industrial alkali. The manufacture of sodium carbonate from common salt was first developed in France in the 1790s and known as the Leblanc process. Muspratt was attracted towards manufacturing it, but could not raise the capital for the relatively expensive Leblanc plant and also considered that Dublin was not a suitable location for this. He perceived Merseyside as better because of the neighbouring coal fields, the proximity to the salt district of Cheshire, and the proximity to glassmaking industry. The glassmakers were the main <b>prospective</b> <b>customer</b> base for the sodium carbonate alkali.|$|E

Page Field was the closest airport to GALC's Cape Coral residential development (which <b>prospective</b> <b>customers</b> accessed by complimentary bus transfers from the airport). From 1958, GALC also began contracting US supplemental carrier Modern Air to fly <b>prospective</b> <b>customers</b> from the Northeast and Midwest into Miami, where they transferred between Modern Air's Curtiss C-46s and Gulf American Airlines' DC-3s en route to and from Fort Myers. These flights formed part of Gulf American Land's free sales pitch and were free for <b>prospective</b> <b>customers,</b> who were also served a free meal on board the aircraft on each leg of their journey. GALC's business eventually accounted for 25% of Modern Air's total business.|$|R
