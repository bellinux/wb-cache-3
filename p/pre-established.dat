Unlike Manekshaw, who was conferred the rank just before his retirement, Cariappa was already retired in 1953, and since a field marshal never retires, therefore retired officers cannot be given the rank. But as a token of gratitude for the exemplary service rendered by him to the nation, the Government of India overruled the <b>pre-established</b> criteria, and conferred the rank of field marshal on him on 28 April 1986 at a special investiture ceremony held at Rashtrapati Bhavan.|$|E
5|$|In 1163 Henry {{returned}} to England, intent on reforming {{the role of}} the royal courts. He cracked down on crime, seizing the belongings of thieves and fugitives, and travelling justices were dispatched to the north and the Midlands. After 1166, Henry's exchequer court in Westminster, which had previously only heard cases connected with royal revenues, began to take wider civil cases on behalf of the king. The reforms continued and Henry created the General Eyre, probably in 1176, which involved dispatching a group of royal justices to visit all the counties in England over a given period of time, with authority to cover both civil and criminal cases. Local juries were used occasionally in previous reigns, but Henry made much wider use of them. Juries were introduced in petty assizes from around 1176, where they were used to establish the answers to particular <b>pre-established</b> questions, and in grand assizes from 1179, where they were used to determine the guilt of a defendant. Other methods of trial continued, however, including trial by combat and trial by ordeal. After the Assize of Clarendon in 1166, royal justice was extended into new areas through the use of new forms of assizes, in particular novel disseisin, mort d'ancestor and dower unde nichil habet, which dealt with the wrongful dispossession of land, inheritance rights and the rights of widows respectively. In making these reforms Henry both challenged the traditional rights of barons in dispensing justice and reinforced key feudal principles, but over time they greatly increased royal power in England.|$|E

50|$|Men {{have been}} perplexed in well-nigh every age by a sophism which the ancients called the 'Lazy reason', because it tended towards doing nothing, {{or at least}} towards being careful for nothing, and only {{following}} inclination {{for the pleasure of}} the moment. For, they said, if the future is necessary, that which must happen will happen, whatever I may do. Now the future (so they said) is necessary, whether because the Divinity foresees everything, and even <b>pre-establishes</b> it by the control of all things in the universe; or because everything happens of necessity, through the concatenation of causes; or finally, through the very nature of truth, which is determinate in the assertions that can be made on future events, as it is in all assertions, since the assertion must always be true or false in itself, even though we know not always which it is. And all these reasons for determination which appear different converge finally like lines upon one and the same center; for there is a truth in the future event which is pre-determined by the causes, and God <b>pre-establishes</b> it in establishing the causes.|$|R
25|$|Predeterminism is {{the idea}} that all events are {{determined}} in advance. Predeterminism is the philosophy that all events of history, past, present and future, have been decided or are known (by God, fate, or some other force), including human actions. Predeterminism is frequently taken to mean that human actions cannot interfere with (or have no bearing on) the outcomes of a pre-determined course of events, and that one's destiny was established externally (for example, exclusively by a creator deity). The concept of predeterminism is often argued by invoking causal determinism, implying that there is an unbroken chain of prior occurrences stretching back to the origin of the universe.

25|$|Psycho-physical {{parallelism}} is a {{very unusual}} view about the interaction between mental and physical events which was most prominently, and perhaps only truly, advocated by Gottfried Wilhelm von Leibniz. Like Malebranche and others before him, Leibniz recognized the weaknesses of Descartes' account of causal interaction taking place in a physical location in the brain. Malebranche decided that such a material basis of interaction between material and immaterial was impossible and therefore formulated his doctrine of occasionalism, stating that the interactions were really caused by the intervention of God on each individual occasion. Leibniz's idea is that God has created a <b>pre-established</b> harmony such that it only seems as if physical and mental events cause, and are caused by, one another. In reality, mental causes only have mental effects and physical causes only have physical effects. Hence the term parallelism is used to describe this view.|$|E

30|$|To {{address the}} above issues, in this paper, we design a virtual queue-based {{back-pressure}} routing and scheduling algorithm (called VBR) for {{wireless sensor networks}} (WSN). VBR is designed to <b>pre-establish</b> a virtual queue-based gradient for nodes in a WSN. In VBR, back-pressure-based scheduling is performed according to the queue length which {{is the sum of}} real queue length and virtual queue length (i.e., gradient value) at each node. The gradient associated with a node is a function of traffic arrival rate, network link rate, and its distance to sink, in order to be adaptive to different network and application environments while achieving high packet delivery performance. We prove that VBR maintains back-pressure’s throughput optimality. Simulation result shows that VBR can obtain significant performance improvement in terms of packet delivery ratio, average E 2 E delay, and average per-node queue length as compared with existing work.|$|R

25|$|E20 {{contains}} 20% ethanol and 80% gasoline, while E25 contains 25% ethanol. These blends {{have been}} widely used in Brazil since the late 1970s. As a response to the 1973 oil crisis, the Brazilian government made mandatory the blend of ethanol fuel with gasoline, fluctuating between 10% to 22% from 1976 until 1992. Due to this mandatory minimum gasoline blend, pure gasoline (E0) is no longer sold in Brazil. A federal law was passed in October 1993 establishing a mandatory blend of 22% anhydrous ethanol (E22) in the entire country. This law also authorized the Executive to set different percentages of ethanol within <b>pre-established</b> boundaries, and since 2003, these limits were fixed at a maximum of 25% (E25) and a minimum of 20% (E20) by volume. Since then, the government has set the percentage on the ethanol blend according to the results of the sugarcane harvest and ethanol production from sugarcane, resulting in blend variations even within the same year.|$|E
25|$|Systems {{of colonial}} rule {{can be broken}} into the binary classifications of direct and {{indirect}} rule. During the era of colonisation, Europeans were faced with the monumental task of administrating the vast colonial territories around the globe. The initial {{solution to this problem}} was direct rule, which involves the establishment of a centralized European authority within a territory run by colonial officials. In a system of direct rule, the native population is excluded from all but the lowest level of the colonial government. Mamdani defines direct rule as centralized despotism: a system where natives were not considered citizens. By contrast, indirect rule integrates <b>pre-established</b> local elites and native institutions into the administration of the colonial government. Indirect rule maintains good pre-colonial institutions and fosters development within the local culture. Mamdani classifies indirect rule as “decentralized despotism,” where day-to-day operations were handled by local chiefs, but the true authority rested with the colonial powers.|$|E
30|$|K-means {{is one of}} the {{simplest}} algorithms used to solve the clustering problem. This clustering algorithm can be applied to extract key-frames from short video sequences or shots, but its application to longer video sequences must be done with care taking into account the large processing time and memory requirements of the algorithm. To reduce the number of frames used by the clustering algorithm some authors pre-sample the original video, as proposed in [24]. The quality of the summaries may not be affected by this operation but the sampling rate must be chosen carefully. Although K-means is a popular and well-known clustering algorithm it has some limitations such as the need to <b>pre-establish</b> the number of clusters desired priori {{and the fact that the}} sequential order of the key-frames may not be preserved. Huang et al. [18] used the K-means clustering algorithm for extracting a set of 3 D key-frames to be compared with the output of their key-frame extraction method.|$|R
40|$|As Cloud {{software}} (Software-as-a-Service) {{become more}} and more ubiquitous, the scale and performance expectations become an important factor impacting architectural decisions for security protocol adoption. WS-Trust[6] and WS-Federation[7] are enterprise scale protocols but lacked wide adoption due to complexity. OAuth 1. 0 emerged as an industry standard for unifying identity management for major SaaS players. However, OAuth 1. 0 soon was proven to fail performance criteria for enterprise adoption. With the introduction of OAuth 2. 0 some of the performance concerns were addressed. This paper proposes an optimization to OAuth 2. 0 for enterprise adoption. This optimization is achieved by introducing manageability steps to <b>pre-establish</b> trust amongst the client and the protected resource server. In this model, the client needs to set up trust with the protected resource server {{as well as with the}} authorization server. These clients are called highly trusted clients.

40|$|Complex Event Processing (CEP) is one {{technique}} {{used to the}} handling data flows. It allows <b>pre-establishing</b> conditions through rules and firing events when certain patterns {{are found in the}} data flows. Because the rules for defining such patterns are expressed with specific languages, users of these technologies must understand the underlying expression syntax. To reduce the complexity of writing CEP rules, some researchers are employing Domain Specific Modeling Language (DSML) to provide modelling through visual tools. However, existing approaches are ignoring some user design techniques that facilitate usability. Thus, resulting tools eventually has become more complexes for handling CEP than the conventional usage. Also, research on DSML tools targeting CEP does not present any evaluation around usability. This article proposes a DSML combined with visual notations techniques to create CEP rules with a more intuitive development model adapted for the non-expert user needs.

In return, Louis XIV kept the major city of Lille on his northern border, but he ceded Furnes, Ypres, Menin, and Tournai to the Spanish Netherlands; he also agreed to the permanent demilitarisation of the naval base at Dunkirk. The Dutch received their restricted Barrier – with French amendments – in the Spanish Netherlands, and a share of the trade in the region with Britain; Prussia gained Upper Guelders, and international recognition of the disputed Orange succession lands of Moers, Lingen, and Neuchâtel; and Portugal won minor concessions in Brazil against encroachments on the Amazon from French Guiana. Nice and the Duchy of Savoy was restored to Victor Amadeus who, at British insistence, also acquired Sicily to act as a counter-weight to the Habsburg's political and commercial dominance in Italy. Louis XIV also ceded the district of Pragelato and the fortresses of Exilles and Fenestrelle to act as part of an alpine barrier; to compensate, Amadeus ceded the Barcelonnette valley to France.
