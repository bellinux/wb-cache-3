40|$|Graduation date: 1975 The usual {{approach}} to {{calculation of the}} ultimate bearing capacity of <b>plastic</b> <b>silt</b> is to assume no porewater drainage occurs during the loading period. The coefficient of permeability of <b>plastic</b> <b>silt</b> is generally significantly larger than clay; therefore, partial drainage of porewater may occur during the loading period. This study evaluates {{the validity of the}} no porewater drainage assumption as it applies to a particular <b>plastic</b> <b>silt.</b> A series of plate load tests were performed on three circular footings of different sizes, placed on the bottom of a shallow excavation. Ultimate bearing capacity for each footing is interpreted from load-settlement curves. Samples were taken from the test pit and the shear strength was evaluated by laboratory testing. The shear strength is used in the Terzaghi, Meyerhof, and Hansen bearing capacity equations. Bearing capacities calculated using the no porewater drainage assumption and local shear failure conditions yield the best correlation with load test data...|$|E
40|$|Presentation given during thesis defense {{regarding}} {{an evaluation}} of shear resistance of reinforced cob. Four specimens were created: two with the <b>plastic</b> <b>silt</b> cob mixture (one specimen containing chicken wire reinforcement) and two with the pure kaolinite cob mixture (one specimen containing chicken wire reinforcement). The samples were tested in a simple shear box. Load, deformation, and image analysis data were collected. Analysis shows {{that there is a}} trend that reinforcement has an effect on the ductility of the cob material. Cob, similar to adobe, is an earthen building material made of soil, sand, and straw. Although cob was used to build homes in England centuries ago, it has reemerged as a sustainable and relatively inexpensive, alternative building material. A possible solution for housing in impoverished nations, cob needs to be studied more in order to provide reliable strength data so that the material can be codified. The {{purpose of this study was}} to determine if the use of chicken wire as reinforcement in a cob wall had an effect on the shear strength of the cob wall. Using two types of soil (a <b>plastic</b> <b>silt</b> and a pure kaolinite), four cob wall panels were created, with one of each soil type being reinforced with chicken wire. The wall panels were tested in a shear box to simulate earthquake loading. The results of this study indicated that the kaolinite specimens showed a trend that the reinforced cob wall panel required a greater load than the unreinforced cob panel in order to deform the same amount. Reinforcement also appeared to increase the toughness of the cob panel. Trends regarding the reinforcement of the silt cob panel were unable to be determined due to the unknown orientation of the chicken wire reinforcement and incomplete data collection...|$|E
40|$|Soils are {{three-phase}} {{composite materials}} that consist of soil, solid particles, and voids {{filled with water}} and/or air. Based on the particle-size distribution, they are generally classified as fine-grained (clays and <b>plastic</b> <b>silts)</b> and coarse-grained soils (nonplastic silts, sand, and gravel). Soil's resistance to external loadings is mainly derived from friction between particles and cohesion. Friction resistance is due to particles' surface-to-surface friction, interlocking, crushing, rearrangement, and dilation (or expansion) during shearing. Cohesion can be due to chemical cementation between particles, electrostatic and electromagnetic forces, and soil-water reaction and equilibrium. The basic factor responsible for the strength of coarse-grained soils is friction. Cohesion can be ignored. This educational brief focuses on measuring shear strength of sands (typical example of coarse-grained soils) where, for the same material, packing density is a main factor to be considered when one asks about the shear strength value. As the external load is applied, the soil's resistance is attained through shearing resistance, which causes the soil volume to increase (expand) or decrease (compress) depending on the initial packing density...|$|R
40|$|Summary The paper shows a {{case study}} {{concerning}} the liquefaction potential assessment of deposits which mainly consist of non <b>plastic</b> <b>silts</b> and sands. The site under study has been characterized by means of in situ tests (CPTU, SPT and DPSH), boreholes and laboratory tests on undisturbed samples. Liquefaction susceptibility has been evaluated by means of several standard procedures prescribed by codes or available in technical literature. The evaluation of liquefaction potential {{has been carried out}} by means of different standard procedures based on in situ and laboratory tests. A qualitative estimation of possible damages to shallow structures has been obtained on the basis of indication contained in TC 4 -ISSMGE [1993]. In addition, quantitative effects of minor liquefaction phoenomena on shallow structures have been studied by means of simplified soil-foundation interaction. The main scope of the paper is to show that application of standard procedures for liquefaction susceptibility or liquefaction potential in areas of medium – low seismicity can lead to overemphasize the liquefaction problem. In addition, any liquefaction study should consider, at least in a simplified way, the effects of possible liquefaction on the shallow structures. In addition useful information about the liquefaction strength of silty sands is provided...|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 2011 Different {{specimen}} {{preparation methods}} such as moist tamping, dry funnel deposition, slurry deposition, dry air pluviation {{have been reported in}} the literature to investigate the undrained behavior of silty sands. Similarly, different means have been used to densify the soils prepared with such methods. However, the influence of the densification technique, utilized within a particular deposition method, on undrained behavior (e. g. change in initial peak deviator stress and instability angle) was not known. Therefore, a new densification technique is developed for the dry funnel deposition method, which avoids tamping, vibrating or mold tapping. This new method of densification is thought to create a much consistent soil fabric for different amounts of densification than other specimen densification techniques. The experimental results show that the change in undrained behavior with increasing density produced by densification is much less pronounced when compared to the other densification methods reported in the literature. Prior research efforts regarding the effect of non <b>plastic</b> <b>silts</b> on the liquefaction behavior of sands mainly focused on the influence of fines content, confining stress, and depositional techniques. However, there is no consensus in the literature regarding the influence of fines content on the undrained behavior of silty sands. Strain-controlled monotonic undrained triaxial compression tests were performed on a single base sand mixed with three different essentially nonplastic silts. First, silt size effects are investigated while other factors like fines content (20...|$|R
40|$|Empirical {{relationships}} are developed for estimating the undrained critical shear strength based on experimental triaxial tests under monotonic loadings. The effect of fines content on the {{undrained shear strength}} is analyzed for different combinations of density states. The parametric study indicates {{that in terms of}} the soil void ratio and fines content properties, the undrained critical shear strength may increase, or decrease as the amount of finescontent increases, consequently showing vulnerability to liquefaction influenced by the fines content percentage. A series of monotonic undrained triaxial tests have been undertaken on a reconstituted saturated sand-silt mixtures specimen. Beyond 30 % of fines content, it is shown that a fraction of silt participates in the soil skeleton chain force. In this context,the concept of the equivalent intergranular void ratio may be an appropriate parameter to express the critical shear strength of the soil under investigation. This parameter is able to control the undrained shear strength of non <b>plastic</b> <b>silt</b> and sand mixtures for different density states...|$|E
40|$|The {{effects of}} the initial state of the samples and the {{saturation}} evaluated in termsof Skempton's pore pressure B {{on the behavior of}} Chlef sand were studied in this article. For this purpose, the results of two series of undrained monotonic compression tests onmedium dense sand (RD= 50 %) are presented. In the first test series, the influence of thespecimens’ fabric and confining pressure is studied. Triaxial specimens containing Chlefsand with 0. 5 % non <b>plastic</b> <b>silt</b> content were isotropically consolidated to 50 kPa, 100 kPaand 200 kPa. The specimens were formed using both dry funnel pluviation and wetdeposition. The results indicate that the confining pressure and the method of samplepreparation have a significant influence on the liquefaction resistance of the sand. In thesecond series of tests, the saturation influence on the resistance to the sand liquefaction isrealized on samples at an effective stress of 100 kPa for Skempton's pore pressurecoefficient varying between 32 % and 90 %. It was found that an increase in the Skempton' Spore pressure coefficient B reduces the soil dilatancy and amplifies the phase ofcontractancy...|$|E
40|$|Stabilization using {{lime and}} cement is a {{widespread}} technique that provides civil engineering applications for soils with poor geotechnical performance. This article describes {{the effects of a}} combined lime+cement treatment on both the characteristics and properties of a <b>plastic</b> <b>silt.</b> A multi-scale approach was implemented and themechanical, microstructural and physicochemical changeswere investigated. To carry out these tasks, unconfined compressive strength measurements were conducted. The modifications caused by this treatment on the microstructure could be characterized by means of scanning electron microscope (SEM) observations of the soil composition, through element distribution maps and mercury intrusion porosimetry (MIP) analyses. The physicochemical evolution has beenmonitored by X-ray diffraction (XRD) analyses. Within the silt, clay particles surround the coarsest particles in order to formmillimeter-sized agglomerates, aroundwhich binders are deposited. During the curing period, the formation of C-(A) -S-H becomes readily apparent. These phases are detected {{in the form of a}} gel that provides continuity throughout the material; as such, the material displays a “honeycomb” type of microstructure. The mechanical properties of the treated soil are indeed affected by this microstructural organization. The post-treatment improvement in mechanical performance therefore proves to be significant...|$|E
50|$|Silt is {{granular}} material {{of a size}} between sand and clay, whose mineral origin is quartz and feldspar.

It may also exist as soil deposited {{at the bottom of a}} water body, like mudflows from landslides.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Earth flows are mass {{movements}} of fine-grained soils {{that range from}} slow flows with velocities {{on the order of}} meters or less per year to rapid flows that have velocities as high as several meters per second. Slow earth flows form in deposits of fine-grained <b>plastic</b> clay or <b>silt</b> and move episodically or by sustained, relatively steady movement. Most slow earth flows move primarily by sliding on a basal shear surface, accompanied by internal deformation. Coulomb plastic-flow models may be used to describe the mechanics of slow earth flows. Most rapid earth flows form in highly sensitive clay deposits and usually progress to completion {{in a matter of minutes}} to hours by a sequence of smaller failures that spontaneously liquefy and flow out of the source area. Rapid earth flows may be modeled as non-Newtonian fluids...|$|R
