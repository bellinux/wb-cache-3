40|$|The 5160 {{spring steel}} is mainly used to endure fatigue and since its Mf is below room temperature, {{retained}} austenite is usually present after conventional quenching, which is detrimental from a fatigue point of view. To {{reduce the amount}} of retained austenite, a <b>partial</b> <b>decarburization</b> was promoted (to increase the Ms and Mf, respectively) by austenitizing the steel at different temperatures and times in air, prior to performing an interrupted quenching in an accelerated media (brine) instead of the conventional oil quenching. The same quenching conditions with <b>partial</b> <b>decarburization</b> and without decarburization are compared. In addition, conventional oil quenching was performed as reference. Results showed that with a controlled <b>partial</b> <b>decarburization,</b> it is possible to increase the fatigue limit compared to the conditions without decarburization (both interrupted quenching and oil quenching). Fatigue experiments were carried out in a rotating bending fatigue type tester. Cooling curves, decarburization profiles, fraction of martensite plots, and fatigue data are discussed...|$|E
40|$|A compositionally-graded steel {{composed}} of martensite with 0. 4 %C on the centre and bainite with 0. 1 %C {{on the surface}} was manufactured by <b>partial</b> <b>decarburization.</b> It is reported that the as quenched material can be cold rolled up to an equivalent strain of 1. 5 without cracks. The mechanical properties of the cold-rolled material exhibits up to 2. 5 GPa strength and ductility. A simple mechanical model is developed to predict the stress state after rolling of the graded structure explaining the good ductility of the present high strength materials...|$|E
