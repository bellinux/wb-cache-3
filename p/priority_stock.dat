Any economic advantage of heavy lambs is realised by extra weight and not price. Both genetic and on-farm factors contribute to extra weight gain. Firstly, lamb weight and growth is correlated to its mature size and lambs from larger parents grow faster and reach heavier weights, but also have greater feed requirements. Secondly, stocking and reproductive rate account for the majority of variation in whole-farm profit, but increasing these also increases feed requirements. The production of heavy lambs is therefore a trade-off with maximising stocking and reproductive rate within the pool of available feed resources.

In particular, ownership diversification leads to greater emphasis on market based objectives (shareholder value). However, in general volatile market-based objectives are given relatively low <b>priority</b> perhaps because <b>stock</b> prices are more volatile (low signal noise ratio).

40|$|Background: As farmers do {{not often}} keep {{a record of}} the {{expenditures}} for rearing, an economic tool that provides insight into the cost of rearing is useful. In the Netherlands, an economic tool (Jonkos) has been developed that can be used by farmers to obtain insight into the cost of rearing on their farm. The first objective {{of this study is to}} calculate the total cost of rearing young stock in Dutch dairy herds using Jonkos. The second objective is to compare the calculated total cost of rearing with the farmers' own estimation of the cost of rearing (the perceived cost). Findings: Information was available for 75 herds that reared their own young stock and who had used the Jonkos tool. The perceived cost of rearing young stock was only available for 36 herds. In the 75 herds, the average herd size was 100 dairy cows. The average calculated total cost of rearing a heifer was € 1, 790. The average perceived total cost of rearing a heifer (including labour and housing costs) was € 1, 030. Conclusion: Most Dutch farmers in the study underestimated the total cost of rearing. The Jonkos economic tool has the advantage that herd-specific information can be entered as input values. The output of the tool can improve the awareness of farmers about the total costs of rearing. This awareness can lead to a higher <b>priority</b> of young <b>stock</b> rearing and consequently to an improved quality of young stock rearing. </p...|$|R
40|$|Purpose – This paper aims {{to assess}} the {{financial}} performance of firms that adopted or deferred the adoption of SSAP 20 “Foreign Currency Translation”. The focus {{of the study is}} to examine the impact of certain accounting issues, such as liquidity, hedging, foreign currency loans, managerial compensation, pre- and post SSAP 20 treatment of translation differences, etc, on the behaviour of firms. Design/methodology/approach – The paper follows the positive accounting theory context and utilises parametric (logistic regression) and non-parametric (Kruskal–Wallis test) tests to form and test theoretical hypotheses and relations between groups of firms with different financial characteristics. Findings – The study provides evidence that the implementation of SSAP 20 has overall strengthened the financial position of adopters. Adopters that used different translation methods prior to adoption tend to exhibit different financial characteristics (e. g. higher leverage) in the pre-actual adoption period. In contrast, they present no substantial differences in the actual adoption period. The findings show that adopters give <b>priority</b> to their <b>stock</b> market picture and tend to distribute higher dividend to their shareholders even if this leads to lower management payout. Research limitations/implications – Firstly, for the period under investigation, the availability of accounting and financial data and the disclosure of accounting information in the financial statements were to some extent limited. Secondly, {{it is difficult to see}} through managers’ inner intentions, and as a result managers’ behaviour and motives may not always be clear and conceivable to outsiders. Originality/value – This study has significant implications for accounting standard setting bodies and investors. It provides insight about firms’ objectives and potential attitude and reaction to the issue of accounting regulation. This study also formulates the basis for studying firms’ behaviour and reaction with regard to other accounting standards and financial issues.

40|$|Angling for Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar L.) is {{a popular}} {{recreational}} activity and provides income for Norwegian landowners holding fishing rights. Abundance and distribution of salmon have however declined markedly during the last 30 years. The recreational salmon fishery is a highly interesting meeting place for natural resources management, delegation of rights and responsibilities, and economic development in rural areas. Landowners are key actors in this regard by having {{a wide range of}} roles being farm owners, holders of fishing rights, suppliers of angling, tourist hosts, owners and managers of salmon habitat, and comanagers of salmon stocks through statuary river owner organizations. Landowners have limited angling tourism resources, and share salmon management responsibilities, making collective-action by the landowner group important. The recreational salmon fishery which both salmon and landowners are parts of {{can be viewed as a}} social-ecological system where there is reciprocity between salmon as a resource and landowners regarding angling tourism,management and conservation of salmon stocks. The main objectives of the thesis were 1) to identify constraints and 2) make recommendations about management of salmon stocks and development of angling tourism in Norway with an emphasis on private small scale landowners. Secondary objectives were to: a) reveal landowners’ objectives and which variables influence these objectives; b) analyze landowners’ profit efficiency; c) analyze risk sources in angling tourism and landowners’ risk management strategies; d) identify different types of landowners, their priority of management actions to strengthen salmon stocks and attitudes to river owner organizations’ work. The objectives were addressed through a study of the recreational salmon fishery in four major salmon rivers in the Trondheim fjord region of mid-Norway. Empirical results were based on a postal questionnaire survey sent landowners in the Gaula, Orkla, Stjørdal and Verdal rivers. Data analyses included use of multiple regressions, factor analysis, binary logistic regression, cluster analysis, and a stochastic profit frontier function. The study revealed a heterogeneous landowner group regarding quality of the fishing rights, farm and landowner characteristics, and objectives about the fishing right. Heterogeneity is generally a problem for cooperation and coordination. Several distinct landowner types were identified: the passive owner, the recreationist, the multiobjective owner, and the economist. Marginalization of angling income reduces profit efficiency in supply of angling tourism. The ongoing trend with more landowners taking off-farm work or not living on the farm may lead to future landowners emphasizing the recreational function of the fishing right and other farm resources rather than the business function. Thereby, profit efficiency would decrease and less fishing could be available for anglers and have consequences for rural tourism. Policies should therefore facilitate development of specialized fishing tourism enterprises by making it easier to rent and acquire fishing rights. Thus could be done by e. g. legislating a minimum period for lease of rights. Mandatory organization of landowners in river owner organizations and introducing a minimum size for beats could also reduce some of the problems caused by heterogeneity in the landowner group. Reduced angling season and changes in strength of salmon runs salmon were seen as having the largest impact on future income from salmon angling tourism. Measures to strengthen salmon stocks might therefore be the most important measure to promote angling tourism, as this ensures that angling can take place and reduces landowners’ investment risk. Landowners used a multiple of strategies to secure household income. Salmon related strategies were least important probably because of the overall limited profit from angling (average NOK 30, 000 per landowner), and the top risk sources being beyond individual landowner control. Reduce problems from salmon farming and stop the spread of the Gyrodactylus salaris (Malmberg) parasite were seen as the biggest threats to salmon stocks. The river owner organizations have little influence over unfavorable conditions in the ocean. Landowners could maximize natural smolt production in the rivers to mitigate these effects and show that they take their share of salmon conservation. Management of habitat and regulation of the fishery to ensure enough spawners are key issues. The high <b>priority</b> of <b>stocking</b> and low <b>priority</b> of catch and release show the apparently irrationality of landowners in prioritizing management actions to secure stocks. This demonstrates a need for knowledge building in the landowner group and for improved communication between scientists, government, river owner organizations and landowners about the effects of stocking and other management actions. The many landowners being negative to the net fishery lease might be due to a lack of information from the river owner organization but also the unfamiliarity with paying for conservation, a concept being new for landowners that historically may have taken salmon for granted. The results from this study might be useful also for understanding how landowners view other natural resources on their farm and the effects on resource management, conservation and economic development...|$|R
40|$|Anthropogenic metal cycles today confront three {{interconnected}} large challenges: {{an increasing}} global demand due to rising population and escalating industrialization and urbanization, a profound {{change of the}} global supply chain induced by globalization process, and growing pressures on climate change mitigation in a carbon constraint world. For example, the global demand for aluminum, the currently second most used metal worldwide, is anticipated to triple by 2050, by which time global greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions are advised to be cut by 50 %- 85 % to avoid catastrophic climate impacts. Process efficiency improvement and recycling can contribute to reducing emissions per material output; however, long-term material demand and scrap availability for recycling depend fundamentally on the dynamics of societies’ stocks of products in use. Meanwhile, on a country level, growing trade of aluminum products leads to cross-boundary leakages of both GHG emissions and secondary materials. This thesis aims to address these interconnected sustainability challenges using a systems approach that characterizes material flows both along their technological life cycle and across national boundaries, that enables an integrated analysis of the materialenergy- emissions nexus, and that considers both system feedbacks and time lags. We are essentially rolling out the anthropogenic aluminum cycles to understand their dynamics from a temporal perspective, to explore the trade links and interdependencies of individual country cycles from a geographical perspective, and to investigate the environmental consequences and mitigation strategies from a GHG emissions perspective. We endeavor to support industry and government in strategic decisionmaking related to aluminum production, trade, and climate change mitigation. Simulation {{results show that the}} contemporary global aluminum stock in use (0. 6 Gt or 90 kg/capita) has reached about 10 % of that in known bauxite reserves and represents an embodied energy amount that is equivalent to three quarters of the present global annual electricity consumption. The largest proportions of in-use stock are located in the U. S. (28 %), China (15 %), Japan (7 %), and Germany (6 %) and in sectors of building and construction (40 %) and transportation (27 %). Industrialized countries have shown similar patterns of aluminum in-use stock growth: once the per-capita stocks have grown to a threshold level of 50 kg, they kept a near linear annual growth of 5 - 10 kg/capita; no clear signs of saturation can be observed yet. The present aluminum stocks in use vary widely across countries: approximately 100 - 600 kg/capita in industrialized countries and below 100 kg/capita in developing countries. The growing global aluminum in-use stock has significant implications on future aluminum demand and provides important recycling opportunities that will be critical for GHG emissions mitigation in the aluminum industry in the coming decades. The trade-linked multilevel contemporary global aluminum cycle reveals several important features of the aluminum production, trade, and use patterns. (i) While the Southern hemisphere is the main primary resource supplier, aluminum production and consumption concentrate in the Northern hemisphere, where we thus also find the largest potential for recycling; (ii) The varying magnitudes of aluminum stocks and flows at the country level strongly reflect the availability of resources, the state of development, the structure of industry and economy, and the wealth and lifestyle of the country; (iii) The global aluminum cycle depends substantially on international trade of aluminum in all forms, but trade patterns vary significantly by commodity and country; (iv) The major industrialized countries tend to have a substantial and increasing presence throughout the stages from aluminum production on, while developing countries rarely create value added in later stages after bauxite refining; (v) A small group of countries {{play a key role in}} the global redistribution of aluminum and in the connectivity of the network. These results provide potential insights to inform government and industry policies in resource and supply chain security, value chain management, and cross-boundary environmental impacts mitigation. Strategies to decarbonize the anthropogenic aluminum cycle can be divided into process technology improvements (e. g., best available technology, new technologies such as inert anode and wetted cathode) and system-wide improvements (e. g., electricity decarbonization, improvement of post-consumer scrap recycling and processing and manufacturing yield). Taking the U. S. aluminum cycle for example, the reduction potentials that may be theoretically achieved for all process technology improvements add up to a 61 % reduction relative to the baseline in 2006, the majority of which lies within the smelting process. Low emission energy, which implies that all electricity and fuels for the aluminum cycle can be produced with near-zero emissions, shows the highest theoretical reduction potential (83 %) of all system-wide strategies. If we can recover the aluminum lost in landfills, scrap export, and obsolete product stock accumulation and export, significant reductions (in territorial emissions) can be achieved (81 %, 47 %, and 15 %, respectively). Maximizing yield of semi-manufacturing and manufacturing processes (i. e., yield loss completely eliminated) can each reduce emissions by about 10 %. However, combination of these strategies does not lead to additive reductions due to system interactions; challenges are likely to arise while approaching these theoretical potentials in practice. The global model results show that future aluminum in-use stock patterns set essential boundary conditions for future emission pathways and mitigation <b>priorities.</b> Higher <b>stock</b> saturation levels result in higher aluminum demand and higher emissions, and earlier saturation times lead to earlier emission peaks and higher cumulative emissions until 2050. If developing countries follow industrialized countries in their aluminum stock patterns, a 50 % emission reduction by 2050 below 2000 levels cannot be reached even under very optimistic recycling and technology assumptions. The target can only be reached if future global per-capita aluminum stocks saturate at a level much lower than that in current major industrialized countries (200 kg/capita). As long as global inuse stocks are growing rapidly, radical new technologies in primary production (e. g., inert anode and carbon capture and storage) have the greatest impact in emission reduction; however, their ‘window of opportunity’ is closing once the stocks begin to saturate and the largest reduction potential shifts to post-consumer scrap recycling.

40|$|As use {{of nuclear}} energy is {{expected}} to expand {{in different parts of}} the world, several codes that describe the nuclear fuel cycle system are currently under development, featuring a range of capabilities and different levels of flexibility and automation. Such codes model the addition or retirement of reactors, the demand for fresh fuel, and the need for spent fuel storage and recycling facilities as the production of nuclear energy varies with time. The codes enable analysis of various scenarios for the evolution of the nuclear energy system, and the timing of deployment of new facilities. Outputs may also include fuel material mass flows, economic analysis and metrics related to spent fuel or waste assessment. The study reported here is the first attempt for benchmarking the MIT code CAFCA against three independently developed fuel cycle simulation codes. It is also among the first publicly available benchmark exercises. Some reviews of the existing codes were previously reported, but focused mostly on their theoretical capabilities. Benchmarking studies, generally involving two or three codes, have been done over the last few years, but most remain unpublished. The codes included in this study are: CAFCA (developed at MIT), COSI (developed at CEA, France), DANESS (developed at ANL) and VISION (developed by DOE laboratories for the AFCI program). The purpose of this benchmark study is to evaluate the degree of convergence of the current versions of these codes and to compare their basic methodologies. This benchmark is not a comprehensive analysis of all the codes’ capabilities but constitutes a first step towards a more complete benchmark study. In order to compare all 4 codes, only the common capabilities were considered and assessed. Those capabilities are essentially those of CAFCA, as it is the simplest code. Consequently, some of the advanced capabilities of the other codes were disabled, and their complete features were not reflected in this benchmark study. In addition, economic evaluation of the fuel cycles was not considered, even though it is a capability common to the four codes. Furthermore, the initial runs showed that a degree of freedom should be removed to ease the comparison. For that reason reprocessing capacity profiles were provided by CAFCA and used as input by the other codes. Following a description of the codes, the report presents the four scenarios selected as the benchmark cases, including initial conditions. The time period of the simulation covers the 21 st century. Those scenarios differ from each other in either the nuclear energy supply growth rate (0 %, 1. 5 % or 3 %) or the type of advanced technology introduced in the midterm. The options for advanced reactors were: the “self-sustaining” fast reactor (with a fissile conversion ratio of one), fast burners of transuranics (TRU), or a combination of plutonium recycling (as mixed oxide) in the thermal light water reactors (LWRs) and fast burners. The scenarios, and hence the results, are for benchmarking purposes only and should not be considered realistic for policy studies or forecasts about the future of nuclear power. The set of constraints specified is minimal and only intended to provide a common framework for the simulations. The results are presented and commented on for each case. The first case, characterized by a very constraining zero energy growth rate, shows an excellent agreement among the codes, with identical ratios of fast reactors/thermal reactors over time. This excellent agreement was the iv result of the particular efforts made in order to get very close results (several iterations were performed to allow for adjustments). This case eventually shows how the models can produce very close results if sufficiently tuned to adhere to the same basic assumptions. This case also allowed us to identify a number of minor apparent discrepancies and explain them. In particular, it made obvious differences in results between COSI, which was tuned to track fuel batches (“discrete-flow code”) and CAFCA, DANESS and VISION, which deal with annual mass flows (”continuous-flow codes). The treatment of discrete batches of fuel by COSI, instead of timeaveraged quantities in the other codes, result in somewhat oscillatory flows and inventories of materials. Another factor leading to discrepancies among the codes is the time assumed to exist between the separation of transuranics and the manufacturing of fast reactor fuels. CAFCA speeds up the fuel manufacturing, to avoid the presence of separated transuranics in large quantities, while the other codes do not (as Pu-containing fuel has a very limited shelf-life at the initial fissile content due to Pu 241 decay with a half life of about 14. 4 years). Unlike the first cases, there was in the three other cases no attempt, beyond the common set of assumptions, to iterate to get the results of the other cases to converge. Therefore, these three cases are more a reflection of how the codes actually operate and show the level of variation in results that should be considered normal. These three cases were of great interest for comparing the different strategies for fast reactor deployment and their dependence for fuel on available TRU from the operation of light water reactors. Overall, the benchmark shows that, although the codes exhibit reassuring consistency, both internally and among themselves, differences still exist. The fact that reprocessing capacity profiles were externally provided may have disturbed some of the codes designed to internally calculate this variable. Although limitations inherent in the codes exist, the differences in the results generally do not reveal major flaws, but rather reflect differing assumptions and constraints embedded in the methods and approximations of the calculations. This benchmark reveals (or reminds us) that there is no single profile for a fuel cycle scenario but several profiles that depend on industrial practices with regards to manufacturing, storage and reprocessing of nuclear fuels. These practices may aim at differing <b>priorities</b> of reducing <b>stocks</b> of stored spent fuel, avoiding the presence of separated TRU to reduce proliferation risks, ensuring sufficient supply of fresh fuel for advanced reactors and spent fuel for reprocessing plants, and minimizing some costs. Such choices can either be intrinsic to the code (through built-in assumptions) or through user choices (for example, the level of conservatism in the algorithm ensuring fuel supply for fast reactors is a user input). Moreover, the parameters left to the user’s discretion are generally not the same from one code to another, or are expressed in different terms. Finally, complete consistency between the codes is difficult to obtain. Two major conclusions can be drawn from this benchmark. First, the overall results show good consistency and similar trends. Hence, utilization of various codes is likely to lead to similar conclusions. Second, one must not expect the various fuel cycle system simulation codes to provide identical outputs. Therefore, users must keep in mind that, although the results are internally consistent and meet each code’s set of requirements, they do not project unique scenarios for meeting such requirements.
