50|$|Proponents of deliberative {{democracy}} {{believe that the}} ideal democracy allows individuals to participate equally in discussions. In Fishkin's vision of {{deliberative democracy}}, interest groups or parties do not dominate a discussion. Fishkin acknowledges difficulties in achieving mass participation: people view their opinions as statistically insignificant, and they are often uneducated about political topics and easily influenced by the media. In modern democracies, most citizens avoid discussing politics with people they disagree with, which limits the potential for conciliation and compromise.

We address this issue by exploiting a database listing more than 1000 firms having collaborated with the University Louis Pasteur between 1990 and 2002. First, using multi-correspondence analysis, we derive a four-classes typology of collaborative behaviours, each of them presenting a strong internal coherence. We obtain four distinct collaboration <b>patterms,</b> for which the frequency of interactions and the exclusive vs. open character of the relationships are discriminating features. Second, using a multinomial logit estimation, we show how this diversity is connected to some individual attributes of the firms: size, legal status, industrial sector and geographic distance from the public partner.

In 1994, Morrison et al. stuidied {{the correlation between the}} bone density and gene polymorphism (BB, Bb, bb) digested with Bsm 1 restriction enzyme and reported a significant decrease of the maximum bone density in order of BB, Bb and bb types. So we performed these experiments in order to study the receptor gene polymorphism in patients with OPLL. The subjects of the present study included 27 patients with OPLL of the cervical spine and 56 healthy volunteers. Our results of healthy volunteers, unlike theirs that showed the Caucasian <b>patterm,</b> demonstrated the dominance of bb type and the extremely limited unmber of BB type. this finding agreed with the results of other studies perfomed in some other institutes in Japan. In the OPLL group, most of the patients, except one who belonged to Bb type, werw classified into bb type. It is quite natural that many OPLL patients who have higher bone density than healthy volunteers are classified into bb type of the gene with higher bone density. However, we have to admit the fact that bb typoe is frequecy detected in Japanese. Therefore we should not regard the high frequency of bb type as the causative factor of OPLL but should regard BB type with lower bone density as inhibitory factor for the development of OPLL. The racial background that the incidence of OPLL is high in Asiancountries is probably related to the recoal difference in the polymorphism of the vitamin D receptor gene...|$|E

40|$|We {{make two}} {{contributions}} to the debate on aid-effectiveness, illustrating that for impact on poverty what matters {{is not just the}} level but also the composition and stability of aid. One specific implication of this for aid policy is that aid most effectively reduces poverty if it supports public (and other) expenditures which are supportive of agricultural development – these, our regression analysis confirms, are not only direct expenditure on agriculture, but also education and infrastructure, and military expenditure has a negative impact. Three factors appear to be particularly conducive to the development of stable pro-poor expenditure <b>patterms</b> (and in particular pro-agriculture expenditure patterns). These are expenditure strategies which protect the poor against risk, the development of stable relations between governments and aid donors, and long-term political commitment to pro-poor strategies by government. The argument is pursued partly by panel-data econometric analysis of developing countries as a whole, and partly by case studies of sustained and non-sustained green revolutions in heavily aid-dependent countries in Africa. ...|$|R

It's often the {{used to make}} desserts, baking ingredients, cold food…etc. Many factors affect quality the processes of adzuki food products, where color {{is one of the}} factors to influence the quality factor. In the study, the No. 6 adzuki bean of Pin-tong is used as the raw materials, investigating the changes in color cooking of adzuki bean. The various solvents were employed to extract anthocyanin, to idenlify the isolation and purification of adzuki bean peel anthocyanin, conferring to the stability of the adzuki beans during different processes. Adzuki beans were heated at various temperatures to determine the kinetic parameter. Different concentration of sucrose, vitamin C and amino acid in model system were to investigate their influences on the color quality and anthocyanin patterns of adzuki beans, hoping to establish related information, to provide related research and product deullopment, to be made as references for improving the quality. The results were as follows. During the cooking process of whole adzuki beans, seed coat and cotyledon, the heating temperature and time showed influences on the pigment reveals the influence. The pigment mainly come from adzuki bean seed coat, pigment loss in adzuki bean peel steadily increases with the increases of heating temperature and time, which to influence quality of products. During heating, the pigment production Millard reaction its bright red color. The various solvent extracted adzuki bean anthocyanin and methanol containing 0. 1 % HCl showed the highest extract. Effect of pH values on absorbance in adzuki bean anthocyanin, which pH 1. 0 was the most absorbance. The Fe 2 + reacted with anthocyanin to produce with hyperchromic effects, which favored the stability of pigment. Heating temperature increase, there is a loss of solids in the product anthocyanin, causing the anthocyanin to degrade. The activation energies (Ea) were 33. 44 kJ mol_ 1 at 60 ~ 90 ℃, and 56. 12 kJ mol_ 1 at 100 ~ 121 ℃. Heating the pH 3. 0 model system at 100 ℃ concentrations of 10 % sucrose hyperchromic effects, favoring the heat stability of pigment, while vitamin C did not show hypercheromic effect, which was not biracial to the heat stability of pigment. Monomeric ACN increased before heating and polymeric increased after heating, due to the presence of sucrose or vitamin C. Monomeric ACN was found to the highest with the addition of 10 % sucrose. Heating the pH 3. 0 model system at 100 ℃, the DI is the highest, after adding lysine and sucrose, and Monomeric ACN increased before heating and polymeric increased after heating. 紅豆（adzuki bean）其表面呈現亮麗紅色、平滑特性及特殊豆香味，深受東亞國家消費者喜愛，經常被製成甜點、糕點、餡料及冰品等，色澤常是成品品質判定因子之一。本研究利用紅豆（屏東 6 號）為材料，探討烹煮過程中色澤變化，再利用不同溶劑萃取紅豆色素萃取並進行花青素分離及純化，另探討不同加工處理對紅豆花青素之安定性。紅豆花青素熱降解動力學及探討模擬系統中探討添加不同濃度蔗糖、維生素C和胺基酸對紅豆花青素顏色品質及聚合型態之影響，期待能建立相關資訊，提供相關研究及產品研發，品質改進之參考。結果顯示如下： 以整粒紅豆、種皮及子葉進行烹煮實驗時，烹煮溫度及時間對紅豆色素有顯著影響，紅豆色素主要來自種皮，種皮之色素隨著加熱溫度及時間增加而溶出愈多；子葉則呈現破損、組織崩裂；另在加熱過程中湯汁會因梅納反應而呈現褐紅色，而影響製品品質及外觀。以不同溶劑萃取紅豆花青素，實驗中以酸性甲醇萃取率為最佳，其次酸性乙醇，以去離子水之萃取率最差。在花青素安定性方面，隨著pH值提高吸光值有下降趨勢；以pH 3. 0 裂解指數（DI）最低呈現較佳之穩定性；添加鐵離子會與花青素產生向紅效應（hyperchromic effect）具有促進花青素顏色保存。在熱裂解動力學方面，花青素會因高溫影響致使產品產生濃縮效應，其固形物溶出，造成花青素降解，在 60 ~ 90 ℃部分活化能為 33. 44 KJmol- 1 ，在 100 ~ 121 ℃部分活化能為 56. 12 KJmol- 1 。在紅豆色素安定性模擬系統方面，發現添加 10 %蔗糖濃度具有濃色效應（bathochromic effect），可減少熱裂解之作用亦有減緩色素降解效果；而添加維生素C保色效果並不明顯，且隨著添加濃度愈高而有熱降解的作用，兩者在加熱前花青素單體（monomeric ACN）較多，加熱後花青素聚合體（polymeric ACN）會增加，其中花青素單體（monomeric ACN）以添加 10 %蔗糖為最高。添加不同胺基酸方面，離胺酸（lysine）與糖於紅豆花青素模擬系統中花青素降解指數（DI）值較高，褐變較高，兩者在加熱前花青素單體（monomeric ACN）較多，加熱後花青素聚合體（polymeric ACN）會增加。中文摘要……………………………………………………………… [...] .

40|$|The {{architecture}} of inflorescence {{refers to the}} spatio-temporal arrangement of flowers on the reproductive branches. Flowering plants have evolved great diversity in such branching systems. Among which, the showy capitulum type inflorescence in the large Compositae (Asteraceae) species {{is regarded as a}} prerequisite factor for their wide spreading around the world. Different from the simple raceme and cyme, capitulum compresses hundreds of individual florets on its receptacle, but overall resembles a single, solitary flower. The ontogeny of capitulum also bears resemblance to a single flower, with regard to the meristem determinacy, floral sequence and histological configurations. Recent molecular studies have revealed that a plant specific transcription factor LEAFY (LFY), is required for both the floral initiation and floral patterning, the two essential steps to form an inflorescence. 			 The thesis elaborates Gerbera hybrida as a model to elucidate functions of the LFY ortholog during the development of inflorescence/flower in a capitulum background. In addition to the conserved functions in regulating floral meristem identity and floral patterning, three specified functions were revealed by transgenic Gerbera with down-regulated expression of GhLFY. Firstly, GhLFY is involved in the regulating the floral initiation of marginal ray florets. Down regulation of GhLFY resulted the marginal ray florets revert into a branching <b>patterm</b> that shown on the capitulum of Calyceraceae, the close relatives of Asteraceae. Secondly, the determinacy of IM is disrupted when GhLFY loses its functions, suggesting that GhLFY may function at both the flower and inflorescence interfaces. Thirdly, different flower types show specific responses to GhLFY down-regulation in floral patterning, indicating that there exist a potential genetic gradient among different flower types. At protein level, the LFY functions are specified by formation of versatile protein complexes with its transcriptional co-regulators. In Gerbera, GhLFY proteins tend to form homodimers and they were also capable to interact with a conserved transcriptional co-regulator, the UNUSUAL FLORAL ORGANS (UFO) ortholog GhUFO. Taken advantage of the forward Y 2 H library screening, 6 additional proteins were identified to interact with GhLFY, including several novel potential co-regulators of LFY that has not yet been identified in other species. Additionally, a bimolecular fluorescence complementation assay (BiFC) was optimized to verify the GhLFY self-interaction in planta...|$|E

Dab- 1 transcription analysis showed a pattern of high levels during the peak (5 weeks) and low levels at the nadir (20 weeks) of the critical period in normally reared animals with opposite transcription levels in dark reared animals (the 2 ̆ 2 plasticity 2 ̆ 2 pattern). Munc 13 - 3 showed the opposite pattern with low levels of transcription at the peak of the critical period and high levels at the nadir in normally reared and opposite pattern in dark reared animals (2 ̆ 2 anti-plasticity 2 ̆ 2 <b>patterm).</b> This project extended the mRNA findings on Western blot analysis to study protein expression of both genes in the visual cortex during the critical period in both cats and mice. This analysis confirmed both Dab- 1 and Munc 13 - 3 as candidate plasticity genes showing 2 ̆ 2 plasticity 2 ̆ 2 and 2 ̆ 2 anti-plasticity 2 ̆ 2 patterns of protein expression, respectively, in visual cortex. Immunohistochemical labeling of Dab- 1 in cat visual cortex revealed a consistent developmental decline in density of immunopositive cells across all cortical lamina from birth through the critical period. Comparisons of Dab- 1 immunohistochemistry in normal and dark reared cats at the peak and nadir of the critical period showed staining patterns consistent with the results of the total protein expression studies. There was a greater immunopositive cell density in normal vs. dark reared animals at the peak of the critical period and greater cell density in dark reared than normal at the nadir of the critical period. Through the use of genetic mutants lacking the Dab- 1 gene, additional Western blot analyses were performed to assess potential relationships between Dab- 1 and expression of NMDA receptor subunits during the visual critical period. An inverse relationship was found between mutant and wild-type mice in the ratio of expression of NR 2 A and NR 2 B subunits between normal and dark-reared animals indicating a strong relationship between the proteins. While future experiments need to be conducted to further elucidate more details on the specific functions of both genes, this research provides substantial evidence that Munc 13 - 3 and Dab- 1 are both genes with significant roles in the critical period of visual cortical development...|$|E
40|$|This {{study was}} carried out in the Blue Nile area in central Sudan. This area {{comprises}} Sinnar and Blue Nile states; it is situated between longitude 32 ° and 36 °East and latitude 12 ° and 14 ° North. The total area is about 79, 180 square Km. The main objective of this work {{study was to determine the}} prevailing conditions of the production systems, husbandry practices, and production constrains. The Blue Nile area varies in natural resources including climate, land, water, vegetation cover and animal resources. It is more eligible and qualified for leading an enormous agricultural industrial and social revolution than other States. The study {{was carried out}} by well designed questionnaires. The questionnaire for cattle owners covered two hundred cattle owners from twenty villages scattered in the two states [...] The questionnaire was designed to obtain information on general household xii characteristics, livestock and herd structure, herd management, breeding practices, prevalence, production objectives, feeding management and production constraints. Another structured questionnaire was prepared and used to collect information from a total of twenty sheep owners. On the other hand; a survey was conducted through a questionnaire and guided interviews with camel owners in selected regions in the Blue Nile area. The SPSS statistical computer software was used to analyze the data. The results were represented mainly in the form of descriptive tabular summaries. All the cattle owners were males, and most of them had " Khalwa " education, while only few joined elementary schools. The majority of cattle owners were farmers and livestock owners, while very few were small businessmen. The results showed that the main type of farming system was extensive system then partial grazing while few of cattle owner were adopted stall feeding. This study showed that all the cattle owners uses veterinary services like vaccination and diseases treatments. The most prevalent diseases in the study region were trypanosomiasis, pneumonia, sheep box, babesiasis and heart water. On the other hand, camel owners revealed that the livestock breeding was their main activity. They breed camels with other animal species (cattle, sheep and goat). The sedentary management system was the main production system for camels in the Blue Nile area followed by a traditionally nomadic system, while transhumant system was not adopted. The camels maintained regular <b>patterm</b> of seasonal north-south movements in search of water and pasture and to escape the Tse Tse beet zone and other insects. Camel owners stated that the disease prevalence was the most important limiting factor of productivity of their xiii camels. However, Lack of feeds and water supply were important factors in the production of their camels. The study showed that the herd population is continuously increasing due to the security, extensive natural vegetation, plenty of agricultural and industrial by-products such as sorghum stover and hulls, cotton by-products, oil cakes, baggass, molasses, wheat stover and bran, guar by-products and fodder production between 2002 - 2006. The study also showed different markets for various livestock species, some markets specialized in sheep others in camels and cattle. From the findings, covering the period 2002 - 2006, the study conclude and confirmed that the Blue Nile area has an excellent potential for investment in livestock production than other States in the Sudan. xi...|$|E
40|$|Proterozoic banded metasiltstones in the Manzano Mountains {{of central}} New Mexico are a {{distinctive}} structural marker in the Capilla Peak Quadrangle. These rocks {{are important because}} they preserve a record of early history of the Manzano thrust belt. The rocks are newly interpreted as mylonitized metasiltstones with a volcanic source based on bulk composition (~ 70 % SiO 2, ~ 15 % Al 2 O 3). The orientation of the rocks and the map pattern suggest refolded folds that produced “mushroom-style” interference <b>patterms</b> (van der Pluijm and Marshak, 1997). Mylonitic stretching lineations (L 1) from an earlier deformation were later folded by F 2. The shear sense during S 1 mylonitization of metasiltstones was top to the west-northwest. Petrologic analysis shows grain size reduction via crystal plastic deformation (mylonitization). This rock is interpreted {{to be part of}} a wide zone of shearing related to the Monte Largo thrust zone, where amphibolite-grade rocks to the southeast were thrust west and north on top of greenschist-grade rocks to the north (top to the northwest). Thrusting probably took place between 1. 656 billion years and 1. 427 billion years ago, as shown by available geochronology in the Monte Largo thrust zone. This thesis involves field and analytical work. GeologyMastersUniversity of New Mexico. Dept. of Earth and Planetary SciencesKarlstrom, KarlCrossey, Laur...|$|R
40|$|Objective: This study {{sought to}} {{determine}} the presence of diagnosis suggestive of binge eating disorder in individuals with type 2 diabetes mellitus, and to evaluate the influence of such disorder on the metabolic control. Methods: sixty-three patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and registered  at the Diabetes and Hypertension Program of a Health Unit {{in the town of}} Balneário Camboriú, Santa Catarina, Brazil, were evaluated. The diagnosis of binge eating disorder was made by analysis of the Questionnaire on Eating and Weight <b>Patterms</b> – Revised. For the evaluation of metabolic control, 10 ml of blood was collected, and the serum glucose, glycated hemoglobin, tryglicerides, cholestrol and fractions were determined. Weight and height were determined for evaluation of national nutritional state, according to the body mass index. Rresults: Among the evaluated individuals, 29 % presented a diagnosis suggestive of binge eating disorder, with higher prevalence among females. The individuals with diagnosis suggestive of binge eating disorder presented a higher average body mass index value than the group without diagnosis. The serum concentrations of glycated hemoglobin (p = 0. 02) and triglicerides (p = 0. 03) were statistically higher in the group with diagnosis suggestive of binge eating disorder. Cconclusions: Based on the results of this study, it is possible to conclude that the presence of binge eating disorder in individuals with type 2 diabetes mellitus favors an increase in body weight and has a negative influence on metabolic control, contributing to the early emergence of complications related to the disease...|$|R
