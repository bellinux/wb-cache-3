40|$|The rare-earth {{elements}} (REEs) {{have been}} identified as critical raw materials, due to their crucial role in green technology combined with their high supply risk, which is a consequence of China’s quasi-monopoly of REE mining and manufacturing of consumer products. Therefore, more and more interest and efforts are put in urban mining, which is the recovery of REEs from end-of-life products, such as permanent magnets or lamp phosphors from compact fluorescent lamps. However, as a consequence of their electron configuration, REEs have very similar chemical properties in solution. In their most stable trivalent oxidation state, it is difficult to efficiently separate a REE mixture into pure fractions. Current industrial separation techniques lack selectivity and are therefore time-consuming and energy intensive. The aim of this dissertation was to explore a new and innovative separation technique, namely photochemical reduction of europium, in order to recover europium from rare-earth mixtures. The typical redox behavior of europium was exploited, by irradiating solutions within the characteristic europium charge transfer bands, to trigger an electron transfer. The CT bands triggering the photochemical reduction of europium are the result of the interaction between europium(III) ions and their ligands, either the solvent and/or anions present in the solution. The energy at which the CT bands occur, is dependent on the type of solvent or anion. This allowed to selectively alter the properties of europium, creating an opportunity to efficiently remove these ions from the solution. The selectively arises from the fact that only europium can adopt a divalent oxidation state in aqueous and certain non-aqueous solutions. Subsequently, via precipitation of the divalent europium ions (as EuSO 4 in water or as EuCl 2 in organic solutions), europium is isolated from the other trivalent REEs, establishing an efficient recovery of europium from rare-earth mixtures. The emphasis was put on binary mixtures of europium and yttrium, which is a rare-earth combination found in red lamp phosphors of compact fluorescent lamps. The REE content in this application is sufficiently high and the composition of the red lamp phosphor is very simple, consisting entirely of yttria, which is doped for 5 - 10 at% with europium ions (Y 2 O 3 :Eu 3 +). Moreover, both elements score {{high on the list of}} critical REEs and are therefore valuable compounds. The main goal was to investigate the parameters that influence the selectivity and efficiency of the europium recovery, and to optimize both chemical and light source parameters. Firstly, it has been proven that photochemical recovery of europium from aqueous europium/yttrium solutions is feasible. The chemical parameters playing a key role in this process, such as pH, type of radical scavenger, rare-earth composition and sulfate concentration have been optimized in order to achieve a selectivity of 98. 5 % with recovery efficiencies up to 99 %. The use of isopropanol as a scavenger, rather than the more conventional formic acid, allowed to work at higher pH values. The optimal pH was determined at a value of 4, resulting in a significant reduction of the required illumination time (up to 88 %). Furthermore, isopropanol is less toxic than formic acid, and in terms of moles added the required amount of scavenger is halved when using isopropanol. Moreover, leachates of actual red lamp phosphors have been tested and europium has successfully been isolated with high purity, underlining the potential for lamp phosphor recycling. In a next step, the effect of the light source on the photoreduction has been investigated into detail. A crucial parameter to consider with this regard is irradiance, expressing the light energy per surface area (expressed in mW. cm- 2). For linear light sources, used in this dissertation, the irradiance is proportional to the inverse of the distance. A higher irradiance results in a shorter induction time, which is a period where no europium removal is detected. Moreover, the removal rate subsequent to this induction time increased with increasing irradiance. Therefore, the combined effect of a higher irradiance is a much shorter illumination time to obtain the same level of europium recovery. For the highest irradiance of 11. 6 mW. cm- 2 compared to the minimal threshold irradiance of 2. 7 mW. cm- 2, the induction time was 6 h and 28 h, while the time needed to complete the removal of europium was observed to be 14 h and 43 h respectively. An efficient way to shorten the induction time and total illumination time is by decreasing the depth of the reactor, resulting in more absorbed photons per unit of volume. In principle, a very thin liquid film would induce the fastest reaction but then the absolute yield (or throughput) is compromised. There is a trade-off between reaction rate and production volume. In a case study by Leblebici et al., a depth of 25 mm proved to be the optimal value for this particular reaction and set-up. UV LEDs have been tested to assess the applicability of energy-efficient monochromatic light sources. The proof-of-principle was established, separating europium from equimolar Eu/Y mixtures with high efficiency (97 %) and selectivity (96. 3 %). However, no reproducible results could be obtained to further deepen these results, due to problems related to evaporation. Therefore, in future work adequate cooling should be applied to gather more information regarding the use of UV LEDs in this context. Besides aqueous solutions, organic solutions have been tested in order to generate CT band at longer wavelengths than the water-to-europium CT band (at 188 nm). Alcohols are a good choice, with CT bands at around 230 nm and sufficiently high solubility of trivalent REEs. Moreover, in alcohols the attraction between anions and europium ions is stronger, creating an extra CT band of chloride anions to europium around 271 nm. Furthermore, since divalent europium forms solids with chlorides (EuCl 2) in most alcohols, the reduced species can be separated from the ions in solution. It has been observed that the type of alcohol plays a crucial role in the reaction. EuCl 2 is too soluble in methanol, prohibiting the precipitation formation after the reduction. On the other hand, ethanol and isopropanol are able to remove divalent europium via EuCl 2 precipitation, with higher yields in isopropanol. High water contents (> 1 wt%) had to be avoided, since then even in ethanol and isopropanol precipitation formation was inhibited. Interestingly, a solvent mixture of 50 / 50 v/v ethanol/isopropanol showed the fastest europium removal versus illumination time, because of its higher photon absorption in the wavelength region of the CT bands. The reaction rate could be increased even further by adding extra chloride ions, both intensifying the chloride-to-europium CT band and decreasing the EuCl 2 solubility at the same time. For Eu/Y mixtures an excess of yttrium contributed to a faster europium removal, which is attributed to the introduction of extra chloride ions (originating from YCl 3) and the fact that yttrium can coordinate up to eight water molecules per ion, lowering the free water content in the solution. Purities of higher than 99. 5 % could be obtained with a recovery efficiency up to 95 %. Photochemical techniques are considered green technology, since massless photons carry the energy for the chemical transition. Therefore, the amount of chemicals needed for the reaction is decreased significantly, while the selectivity is very high resulting in a highly efficient one-step process. Hence, <b>photochemical</b> <b>separation</b> of europium from rare-earth mixtures is a promising method to recover europium, particularly showing great potential for the recycling of red lamp phosphor waste streams. Challenges that remain for future work are the design of an energy-efficient reactor with an optimal geometry, preferentially a milliflow reactor using LEDs as a light source. Furthermore, exploring the use of other organic solvents could create opportunities to further shift the energy of the CT bands towards the visible wavelength region and to apply this technique on other REEs like Sm and Yb.

40|$|ABSTRACT: <b>Photochemical</b> charge generation, <b>separation,</b> and {{transport}} at nano-crystal interfaces {{are central to}} photoelectrochemical water splitting, a pathway to hydrogen from solar energy. Here, we use surface photovoltage spectroscopy to probe these processes in nanocrystal films of HCa 2 Nb 3 O 10, a proven photocatalyst. Charge injection from the nanoparticles into the gold support can be observed, as well as oxidation and reduction of methanol and oxygen adsorbates on the nanosheet films. The measured photovoltage depends on the illumination intensity and substrate material, and it varies with illumination time and with film thickness. The proposed model predicts that the photovoltage {{is limited by the}} built-in potential of the nanosheet−metal junction, that is, the difference of Fermi energies in the two materials. The ability to measure and understand these light-induced charge separation processes in easy-to-fabricate films will promote the development of nanocrystal applications in photoelectrochemical cells, photovoltaics, and photocatalysts.

The TRDL method has the advantage of being sensitive to charge separation occurring in both oriented and unoriented films of purple membranes. One disadvantage is that the water content of the samples must be minimized, however, there is some absorbed water present in our electrodeposited solid film samples. To the best of our knowledge, TRDL measurements have not been reported previously for <b>photochemical</b> charge <b>separation</b> in biological membranes. It is significant that an early decay component of TRDL in the 20 -microseconds time domain corresponds to the relaxation of the negative charge displacement photocurrent in oriented samples of purple membranes.

In this work the mechanism of electron conduction across the highly tractable Rhodobacter sphaeroides reaction centre is characterized by conductive atomic force microscopy. We find, using engineered proteins of known structure, that {{only one of the}} two cofactor wires connecting the positive and negative termini of this reaction centre is capable of conducting unidirectional current under a suitably oriented bias, irrespective of the magnitude of the bias or the applied force at the tunnelling junction. This behaviour, strong functional asymmetry in a largely symmetrical protein-cofactor matrix, recapitulates the strong functional asymmetry characteristic of natural <b>photochemical</b> charge <b>separation,</b> but it is surprising given that the stimulus for electron flow is simply an externally applied bias.

40|$|AbstractAlthough {{the amino}} acid {{sequence}} of the 9 kDa (phospho) protein of chloroplasts has been determined, the function of this thylakoid membrane protein in photosynthetic electron transport {{and the reason for}} its physiological control remains unclear. In this paper, I briefly review the evidence which indicates that the phosphorylation of the 9 kDa protein results in a partial inhibition of photosynthetic oxygen evolution by increasing the stability of the semiquinone bound to QA the primary, plastoquinone-binding site of photosystem II (PS II). I propose that in its dephosphorylated state, the 9 kDa thylakoid membrane protein may serve PS II to ensure efficient <b>photochemical</b> charge <b>separation</b> by aiding the transfer of reducing equivalents out of the reaction centre to the attendant plastoquinone pool. This function is analogous to that proposed for the H-subunit of the reaction centre of photosynthetic eubacteria.

40|$|ABSTRACT: The charge {{transfer}} properties of interfaces {{are central to}} the function of photovoltaic and photoelectrochemical cells and photocatalysts. Here we employ surface photovoltage spectroscopy (SPS) to study photochemical {{charge transfer}} at a p-silicon/n-BiVO 4 particle interface. Particle films of BiVO 4 on an aluminum-doped p-silicon wafer were obtained by drop-coating particle suspensions followed by thermal annealing at 353 K. <b>Photochemical</b> charge <b>separation</b> of the films was probed as a function of layer thickness and illumination intensity, and in the presence of methanol as a sacrificial electron donor. Electron injection from the BiVO 4 into the p-silicon is clearly observed to occur and to result in a maximum photovoltage of 150 mV for a 1650 nm thick film under 0. 3 mW cm− 2 illumination at 3. 5 eV. This establishes the BiVO 4 −p-Si interface as a tandem-like junction. Charge separation in the BiVO 4 film is limited by light absorption and by slow electron transport to the Si interface, based on time-dependent SPS measurements.

40|$|Nuclear {{magnetic}} resonance (NMR) spectroscopy and time-resolved diffuse reflectance (TRDR) have been combined {{to study the}} effects of constrained rotational motion on the rates of photoinduced electron-transfer reactions within zeolites. By synthesizing tris(2, 2 ′-bipyridine) ruthenium (II) [Ru(bpy) 32 +] within the large cages of zeolites Y and EMT, it was possible to directly investigate the effect of zeolite cage size on molecular motion of Ru(bpy) 32 + and the influence of the cage size on the rate of intrazeolitic electron transfer. Deuterium solid-state NMR shows that zeolite Y imposes restraint on molecular rotation of Ru(bpy) 32 +, while zeolite EMT allows for motion. Temperature-dependent studies show the ability to freeze or induce motion of Ru-(bpy) 32 + within zeolite EMT while motion within zeolite Y remains unaffected, even at elevated temperatures. For zeolite EMT, an increase in the rate of the photoinduced forward and back electron transfer from Ru-(bpy) 32 + to methyl viologen was noted and correlated with access, rotational motion, and favorable orbital overlap.

40|$|AbstractThe {{reorganization}} energy (λ) for {{electron transfer}} {{from the primary}} electron donor (P*) to the adjacent bacteriochlorophyll (B) in photosynthetic bacterial reaction centers is explored by molecular-dynamics simulations. Relatively long (40 ps) molecular-dynamics trajectories are used, rather than free energy perturbation techniques. When the surroundings of the reaction center are modeled as a membrane, λ for P*B → P+B− {{is found to be}} ∼ 1. 6 kcal/mol. The results are not sensitive to the treatment of the protein's ionizable groups, but surrounding the reaction center with water gives higher values of λ (∼ 6. 5 kcal/mol). In light of the evidence that P+B− lies slightly below P* in energy, the small λ obtained with the membrane model is consistent with the speed and temperature independence of <b>photochemical</b> charge <b>separation.</b> The calculated reorganization energy is smaller than would be expected if the molecular dynamics trajectories had sampled the full conformational space of the system. Because the system does not relax completely on the time scale of electron transfer, the λ obtained here probably is more pertinent than the larger value that would be obtained for a fully equilibrated system...|$|R

Self-assembled phthalocyanine-multifullerene donor-acceptor conjugates have been formed by crown ether-ammonium cation dipole-ion binding {{strategy}} to probe the <b>photochemical</b> charge <b>separation.</b> To achieve this, phthalocyanine is functionalized to possess four 18 -crown- 6 moieties on the macrocycle periphery, whereas fullerene is functionalized to possess an alkyl ammonium cation of short and long chain lengths. Stable donor-acceptor conjugates accommodating multifullerene entities have been obtained by the crown ether-ammonium cation inclusion complexation. From the efficient fluorescence quenching of the zinc phthalocyanine by the bound fullerene entities, the rate constants of charge separation are evaluated to be slightly larger for closely held via shorter alkyl chain length fullerene, which are also larger compared to the earlier reported analogous zinc porphyrin-multifullerene conjugate. Nanosecond transient absorption studies yielded spectral signatures corresponding to both the phthalocyanine radical cation and fullerene radical anion at the same time, providing evidence of light-induced electron transfer within the conjugates.

40|$|AbstractTwo {{functional}} {{electron transfer}} (ET) chains, related by a pseudo-C 2 symmetry, {{are present in}} the reaction center of photosystem I (PSI). Due to slight differences in the environment around the cofactors of the two branches, there are differences in both the kinetics of ET and the proportion of ET that occurs on the two branches. The strongest evidence that this is indeed the case relied on the observation that the oxidation rates of the reduced phylloquinone (PhQ) cofactor differ by an order of magnitude. Site-directed mutagenesis of residues involved in the respective PhQ-binding sites resulted in a specific alteration of the rates of semiquinone oxidation. Here, we show that the PsaA-F 689 N mutation results in an ∼ 100 -fold decrease in the observed rate of PhQA− oxidation. This is the largest change of PhQA− oxidation kinetics observed so far for a single-point mutation, resulting in a lifetime that exceeds that of the terminal electron donor, P 700 +. This situation allows a second <b>photochemical</b> charge <b>separation</b> event to be initiated before PhQA− has decayed, thereby mimicking in PSI a situation that occurs in type II reaction centers. The results indicate that the presence of PhQA− does not impact the overall quantum yield and leads to an almost complete redistribution of the fractional utilization of the two functional ET chains, in favor of the one that does not bear the charged species. The evolutionary implications of these results are also briefly discussed...|$|R
40|$|We have {{examined}} the photophysics of energy migration and trapping in photosystem I by investigating the spectral and temporal properties of the fluorescence from the core antenna chlorophylls {{as a function of}} the antenna size. Time-correlated single photon counting was used to determine the fluorescence lifetimes in the isolated P 700 chlorophyll a-protein complex and in a mutant of Chlamydomonas reinhardtii that lacks the photosystem II reaction center complex. The fluorescence decay in both types of sample is dominated by a fast (15 - 45 psec) component that is attributed to the lifetime of excitations in the photosystem I core antenna. These excitations decay primarily by an efficient photochemical quenching on P 700. The measured lifetimes show a linear relationship to the core antenna size. A linear dependence of the excitation lifetime on antenna size was predicted previously in a lattice model for excitation migration and trapping in arrays of photosynthetic pigments [Pearlstein, R. M. (1982) Photochem. Photobiol. 35, 835 - 844].

Cells were grown under physiological conditions at 500 millimoles per square meter per second (control) and under irradiance-stress conditions at 1700 millimoles per square meter per second incident intensity (high light, HL). In control cells, the light-harvesting antenna of photosystem I (PSI) contained 210 chlorophyll a/b molecules. It was reduced to 105 chlorophyll a/b in HL-grown cells. In control cells, the dominant form of photosystem II (PSII) was PSIIα(about 63 % of the total PSII) containing > 250 chlorophyll a/b molecules. The smaller antenna size PSIIβ centers (about 37 % of PSII) contained 135 ± 10 chlorophyll a/b molecules. In sharp contrast, the dominant form of PSII in HL-grown cells accounted for about 95 % of all PSII centers and had an antenna size of only about 60 chlorophyll a molecules.

40|$|The {{fluorescence}} yield for 694 nm excitation in a Photosystem I- 200 particle is {{significantly lower than}} that for 665 nm excitation. This supports the previous suggestion, based on thermodynamic analysis of absorption and emission spectra, that thermal equilibration in the 690 - 700 nm spectral interval is perturbed, presumably by primary photochemistry [Croce et al. (1996) Biochem 35 : 8572 - 8579]. This equilibrium perturbation {{was used in the}} present study as a novel fit parameter in numerical simulations aimed at describing the kinetic/thermodynamic properties of exciton flow and primary photochemistry in PSI. To this end a four energy level scheme was developed which satisfactorily described all the fit parameters, including that of the equilibrium perturbation. An important characteristic which distinguished this model from other model studies is the presence of a number of chlorophyll molecules with absorption maximum near 695 nm, tightly coupled to P 700. The main conclusions are: (I) about six chlorophyll molecules absorbing near 695 nm are tightly coupled to P 700, in close agreement with the recent crystallographic structure for the Photosystem I core [Krauss et al. (1996); Nature Struct Biol 3 : 965 - 973]; (II) energy transfer from the bulk pigments to the P 700 core pigments is slow; (III) analysis of the most physically straightforward model indicates that the primary <b>photochemical</b> charge <b>separation</b> rate is very high (k(pc) ≤ 2. 5 ps- 1), thought it is possible to simulate the equilibrium perturbation with lower k(pc) values assuming a large free energy decrease in the excited state of P 700; (IV) the red spectral forms slow down reaction centre trapping by a 2 - 3 fold factor...|$|R

These bacteria possess multi- component photosystems composed of a variety of pigment-proteins. In all characterized purple photosynthetic bacteria a reaction centre (RC), whose function is <b>photochemical</b> charge <b>separation,</b> is surrounded by an LH 1 light harvesting pigment-protein to form a core RC-LH 1 complex. In some species additional light harvesting is provided by one or more peripheral light harvesting pigment-proteins. In the best characterized purple photosynthetic bacterium, Rhodobacter sphaeroides, the RC-LH 1 core complex is present in either a monomeric or dimeric form, in which either one or two RCs are surrounded by a C- or S-shaped LH 1 antenna, respectively. One aim of the work described in this thesis was to carry out the first systematic analysis of how environmental (growth) conditions, changes in carotenoid composition and genetic manipulation (gene deletion and complementation in trans) affects the composition of the Rhodobacter sphaeroides photosystem, with particular focus on the compositions and relative amounts of the monomeric and dimeric forms of the RC-LH 1 complex. The composition of the photosystem assembled in range of Rhodobacter species was also explored. Subsequent work focused on the influence of the LH 1 and PufX components on the assembly of the dimeric form of the RC-LH 1 complex.

40|$|Photosystem I of the {{cyanobacterium}} Synechococcus elongatus {{contains two}} spectral pools of chlorophylls called C- 708 and C- 719 that absorb at longer wavelengths than the primary electron donor P 700. We investigated the relative quantum yields of <b>photochemical</b> charge <b>separation</b> and fluorescence {{as a function}} of excitation wavelength and temperature in trimeric and monomeric photosystem I complexes of this cyanobacterium. The monomeric complexes are characterized by a reduced content of the C- 719 spectral form. At room temperature, an analysis of the wavelength dependence of P 700 oxidation indicated that all absorbed light, even of wavelengths of up to 750 nm, has the same probability of resulting in a stable P 700 photooxidation. Upon cooling from 295 K to 5 K, the nonselectively excited steady-state emission increased by 11 - and 16 -fold in the trimeric and monomeric complexes, respectively, whereas the quantum yield of P 700 oxidation decreased 2. 2 - and 1. 7 -fold. Fluorescence excitation spectra at 5 K indicate that the fluorescence quantum yield further increases upon scanning of the excitation wavelength from 690 nm to 710 nm, whereas the quantum yield of P 700 oxidation decreases significantly upon excitation at wavelengths longer than 700 nm. Based on these findings, we conclude that at 5 K the excited state is not equilibrated over the antenna before charge separation occurs, and that approximately 50 % of the excitations reach P 700 before they become irreversibly trapped on one of the long-wavelength antenna pigments. Possible spatial organizations of the long-wavelength antenna pigments in the three-dimensional structure of photosystem I are discussed...|$|R
40|$|Coral bleaching, {{the process}} in which corals expel their {{photosynthetic}} symbionts (Genus Symbiodinium), is caused by high temperature and irradiance stress. The synergistic effect of each stressor is the generation of damaging reactive oxygen and nitrogen species (ROS and RNS), which are normally mitigated physiologically by antioxidant enzyme activity. Antioxidant enzymes require iron, copper, manganese and zinc in their structure and the limited nature of these trace metals in reef environments may enhance ROS production under elevated temperature and irradiance. The hypothesis tested within this thesis was that a limited availability of the trace metals Fe, Mn, Cu and Zn would cause increases in intracellular ROS and RNS load of the symbiotic dinoflagellates of corals isolated from the Great Barrier Reef (GBR), Australia, under conditions of temperature and irradiance stress. Pulse amplitude fluorometry, flow cytometery and fluorescent ROS and RNS probes were utilized to measure <b>photochemical</b> efficiency (charge <b>separation</b> at PSII) and intracellular ROS and RNS levels. Trace metal limitation experiments on Stylophora pistillata collected from various GBR locations showed that Fe limitation under elevated temperature directly reduced PSII photochemical efficiency and increased protective pigments of symbiotic dinoflagellates in hospite. Increases in intracellular ROS were not detected, however, and decreases or an absence of change in intracellular ROS occurred under Fe limited conditions. Culture experiments on Symbiodinium Strains were then employed to understand this phenomenon and cells were grown under Fe-replete and deplete conditions in continuous culture and subject to heat and irradiance stress. Enhanced intracellular ROS and RNS were detected within Symbiodinium Strains 831 and 2432 in culture under Fe-deplete conditions at high temperature and irradiance. This thesis illustrates the intricate role of Fe in Symbiodinium photochemistry and oxidative stress in culture and in hospite, providing insight to the physiology behind coral bleaching...|$|R
40|$|Active {{chlorophyll}} a fluorescence is {{an essential}} tool for understanding photosynthetic activity within cnidarian/dinoflagellate symbioses. Fluorescence measurement is typically achieved by utilizing a blue or red monochromatic excitation light source. However, algal photosynthetic pigments can differ in their absorption spectra, potentially leading to excitation wavelength dependent measurements of maximal and light acclimated PSII photosynthetic quantum yield (Fv/Fm or Fq′/Fm′) and functional absorption cross section (σPSII or σPSII′). Here we utilized an open source hardware development platform to construct a multispectral excitation fluorometer to assess spectrally dependent differences in photochemistry within four different Symbiodinium species (two of each ITS 2 -type A 4 and B 1). Multivariate analysis of light acclimated <b>photochemical</b> signatures showed <b>separation</b> between most alga types. These spectrally dependent differences in light acclimated PSII efficiency and PSII functional absorption cross section likely reflect changes in light harvesting compounds, their connectivity to the PSII reaction centers and the balance between photochemical and non-photochemical fluorescence quenching. Additionally, acclimation to low (20 μmol photons m− 2 s− 1) and high (200 μmol photons m− 2 s− 1) light conditions was examined in two of these symbionts types (ITS- 2 type A 4 and B 1) As expected, chlorophyll a cell− 1 decreased under high light acclimation in both symbionts. However, only A 4 saw a subsequent reduction in absorbance whereas cellular volume decreased in the B 1 (S. minutum) symbiont. In response to high light acclimation, Fv/Fm was significantly lower at all excitation wavelengths for the B 1 symbiont where as efficiencies remained the same for A 4. However, high-light acclimated Fq′/Fm′ levels decreased in both symbionts, but only when measured using the 615 or 625 nm excitation wavelengths. Non-photochemical quenching within the antennae bed was downregulated under high light acclimation in the A 4 symbiont, but only when measured using the 505 and 530 nm excitation wavelengths. Such changes in Fq′/Fm′ and antennae bed quenching highlight the benefits of spectrally resolved photochemical measurements. Additionally, the utilization of Arduino and Bitscope hardware exemplifies the potential of open source development platforms for construction of highly customizable instrumentation for photosynthetic research...|$|R
