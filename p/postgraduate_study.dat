5|$|Throughout {{the next}} decade, Amanullah Khan instituted {{a number of}} social and {{constitutional}} reforms which had first been advocated by the Niedermayer-Hentig expedition. The reforms were instituted under a ministerial cabinet. An initial step was made towards female emancipation when women {{of the royal family}} removed their veils; educational institutions were opened to women. The education system was reformed with a secular emphasis and with teachers arriving from outside Afghanistan. A German school that opened in Kabul at one point offered the von Hentig Fellowship, devoted to <b>postgraduate</b> <b>study</b> in Germany. Medical services were reformed and a number of hospitals were built. Amanullah Khan also embarked on an industrialisation drive and nation-building projects, which received substantial German collaboration. By 1929, Germans were the largest group of Europeans in Afghanistan. German corporations like Telefunken and Siemens were amongst the most prominent firms involved in Afghanistan, and the German flag carrier Deutsche Luft Hansa became the first European airline to initiate service to Afghanistan.|$|E

However, as with gaining a postgraduate degree from another university, once incepted and promoted to a Master, the graduate no longer wears the academic dress or uses the post-nominal letters pertaining to a Bachelor of Arts, being no longer of that rank: i.e. the Master of Arts degree is not awarded separately (for instance, in addition to that of Bachelor of Arts), but rather the new rank is rather treated as a conversion of one degree to another.|$|E

He joined the United States Army Dental Corps when the United States entered World War I, and served as a lieutenant from 1917 to 1919. After <b>postgraduate</b> <b>study</b> at Northwestern University in 1920, Hunt resumed his practice in Lander.

He then {{attended}} the University of Otago in New Zealand, where he studied medicine (1942 to 1945). He never finished his medical studies, because his great-uncle and mentor, Ratu Sir Lala Sukuna (who was then regarded as Fiji's paramount chief), seeking to groom him for future leadership of the nation, arranged for him to study history at Wadham College, Oxford in the United Kingdom. Mara was distressed to abandon his medical studies, but, dependent on Ratu Sukuna for financial support, followed his orders without question, and graduated with an MA in 1949. In 1961, he returned to the United Kingdom to pursue <b>postgraduate</b> <b>study</b> at the London School of Economics for a Diploma in Economics and Social Administration, which he was awarded in 1962.

In late 1973 her first scholarly article, [...] "Children Under the Law", {{was published in the}} Harvard Educational Review. Discussing the new children's rights movement, the article stated that [...] "child citizens" [...] were [...] "powerless individuals" [...] and argued that children should not be considered equally incompetent from birth to attaining legal age, but instead that courts should presume competence except when there is evidence otherwise, on a case-by-case basis. The article became frequently cited in the field.|$|E
500|$|In 1927, Garran {{had moved}} {{from his home in}} Melbourne, Victoria to the newly {{established}} capital Canberra, one of the first public officials to do so (many government departments and their public servants did not move to Canberra until after World War II). He also worked within the Government to facilitate housing in Canberra for officials moving from other cities, and was involved in establishing cultural organisations in the city. In 1928 he was the inaugural President of the Canberra Rotary Club. In 1929, he formed the Canberra University Association in order to promote the formation of a university in Canberra, and in 1930 organised the establishment of Canberra University College (essentially a campus of the University of Melbourne) which taught undergraduate courses, chairing its council for its first twenty-three years. Throughout the 1920s and 1930s, Garran [...] "consistently advocated the establishment of what he prophetically called 'a National University at Canberra' [...] ", which would be primarily for specialist research and <b>postgraduate</b> <b>study,</b> in areas particularly relating to Australia, such as foreign relations with Asia and the Pacific region. This vision was evidently influential on the establishment of the Australian National University (ANU) in 1946, the only research-only university in the country (although in 1960 it amalgamated with Canberra University College to offer undergraduate courses).|$|E
500|$|John Bradley Hirst, [...] (9 July 1942 – 3 February 2016) was an Australian {{historian}} and commentator. He has [...] {{been described as}} an [...] "historian, public intellectual, and active citizen". Born in Adelaide, Hirst attended Unley High School and undertook his undergraduate and <b>postgraduate</b> <b>study</b> at the University of Adelaide. Abandoning an early desire to become a Methodist Minister, in 1968 he was appointed a [...] lecturer at Melbourne's new La Trobe University, where he remained {{until the end of}} his career. His wife and fellow-student Christine accompanied him to Melbourne. They had two children, Catherine and David. Hirst was subsequently head of department and Reader in History at La Trobe. He retired in 2006, and was an Emeritus Scholar at La Trobe until his death. Hirst had a distinguished career [...] "in teaching, supervision and research. He developed new subjects and methodologies to teach them. In addition to those concerning Australian history there was his pioneering subject designed to inform students about Australia's European cultural heritage." [...] This work was published as The Shortest History of Europe and has been translated into nine languages (Swedish, Greek, Chinese,Arabic, Spanish, German, Portuguese, Russian, Turkish and Korean). Hirst was seconded to the University of Melbourne to edit Historical Studies, Australia's leading historical journal, from 1977 to 1980. In retirement, he travelled regularly to Sydney to instruct, without remuneration, groups of post-graduate students in thesis writing.|$|E
