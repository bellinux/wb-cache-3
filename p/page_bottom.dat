40|$|We {{extend the}} basic {{concepts}} of Street's formal theory of monads from {{the setting of}} 2 -categories to that of double categories. In particular, we introduce the double category Mnd(C) of monads in a double category C and define {{what it means for}} a double category to admit the construction of free monads. Our main theorem shows that, under some mild conditions, a double category that is a framed bicategory admits the construction of free monads if its horizontal 2 -category does. We apply this result to obtain double adjunctions which extend the adjunction between graphs and categories and the adjunction between polynomial endofunctors and polynomial monads.

5000|$|The label [...] "infotainment" [...] is {{emblematic of}} concern and {{criticism}} that journalism is devolving from a medium which conveys serious information about issues affecting public interest, into a form of entertainment which happens to have fresh [...] "facts" [...] in the mix.
