40|$|International audienceLittle {{is known}} about factors {{associated}} with perceptions of susceptibility to sport-related injuries. The {{purpose of the present}} study was to examine <b>previous</b> <b>experiences</b> with injury and personality factors as predictors of rugby players' perceived susceptibility to injury. In line with an individual-based approach, it was hypothesized that neuroticism and global self-esteem would be related to perceived susceptibility to sport injuries over and above <b>previous</b> <b>experiences</b> with injuries. Rugby players (N = 235) were asked to report about <b>previous</b> <b>experiences</b> with injury and were administered measures of neuroticism and global selfesteem. Multiple regression analysis revealed that <b>previous</b> <b>experiences</b> with injury were positively related to perceived susceptibility to sport-related injuries. Analyses also supported that neuroticism and global self-esteem are of crucial importance in colouring perceptions of susceptibility to sport-related injury, while statistically controlling for previous injuries. Of particular interest, neuroticism predicted perceived susceptibility, over and above global self-esteem and <b>previous</b> <b>experiences</b> with injury. This study is the first to focus on determinants of perceived susceptibility to sport-related injury and supports the potential role of personality factors and individual dispositions in shaping perceived susceptibility to health problems...|$|R

5|$|In neuroscience, a {{great deal}} of effort has gone into {{investigating}} how the perceived world of conscious awareness is constructed inside the brain. The process is generally thought to involve two primary mechanisms: (1) hierarchical processing of sensory inputs, and (2) memory. Signals arising from sensory organs are transmitted to the brain and then processed in a series of stages, which extract multiple types of information from the raw input. In the visual system, for example, sensory signals from the eyes are transmitted to the thalamus and then to the primary visual cortex; inside the cerebral cortex they are sent to areas that extract features such as three-dimensional structure, shape, color, and motion. Memory comes into play in at least two ways. First, it allows sensory information to be evaluated in the context of <b>previous</b> <b>experience.</b> Second, and even more importantly, working memory allows information to be integrated over time so that it can generate a stable representation of the world—Gerald Edelman expressed this point vividly by titling one of his books about consciousness The Remembered Present. In computational neuroscience, Bayesian approaches to brain function have been used to understand both the evaluation of sensory information in light of <b>previous</b> <b>experience,</b> and the integration of information over time. Bayesian models of the brain are probabilistic inference models, in which the brain takes advantage of prior knowledge to interpret uncertain sensory inputs in order to formulate a conscious percept; Bayesian models have successfully predicted many perceptual phenomena in vision and the nonvisual senses.|$|E
