40|$|Enabling the {{widespread}} deployment of PEVs requires significant charging infrastructure. The difficulty {{and cost of}} PEV charger installation {{has resulted in a}} persistent shortage of plug points for charging. WINSmartEVTM is a novel network system of PEV charging stations that connects multiple PEVs to a given circuit by sharing the energy resource. By significantly increasing the number of <b>plugs</b> per <b>circuit,</b> and thereby decreasing the cost per plug point installation, an increase in access to charging for PEVs is achieved. An incremental {{increase in the number of}} <b>plugs</b> per <b>circuit</b> causes an incremental decrease in the amount of energy that a user can receive during a given charging session. Dividing a circuit is a zero sum game between the number of <b>plugs</b> per <b>circuit</b> and fulfilling the users’ needs and expectations. By focusing a charge scheduling system on the users’ needs, it is possible to maximize any combination of users’ needs and expectations, and number of <b>plugs</b> per <b>circuit.</b> A scheduling system was created that maximizes the number of PEVs that can be adequately charged from a given circuit by accounting for both users’ needs and expectations. Objective formulation was created to quantify users’ needs and expectations using multi-objective optimization. The formulation quantified 8 user needs and expectations functions categorized by 2 independent variables. Six needs were quantified as SOC based utility functions and 2 expectations were quantified as time based utility functions. The energy allocation scheduling problem was solved using the model predictive control method. The utility functions were fit to a state space model. However, the SOC utility function and feedback functions are non-linear so a closed form solution was not attempted. The scheduling system was simulated in Matlab and compared to the default charging algorithms. The system was validated using data from 3 separate energy sharing chargers that divide energy between 4 plugs each, over an 8 months period. The results show that this scheduling system significantly shifts to the right the graph of BEVs leaving with insufficiency charge for a given number of <b>plugs</b> on a <b>circuit.</b> Therefore, for any given number of <b>plugs</b> the <b>circuit</b> is sharing, a BEV user is significantly less likely to leave with insufficient charge. Furthermore, the likelihood of BEVs leaving with insufficient charge can be kept the same while significantly increasing the number of plugs supplied from the circuit...|$|R

50|$|If a three-conductor plug is {{connected}} to a two-conductor socket, normally the result is to leave the ring of the <b>plug</b> unconnected (open <b>circuit).</b> In the days of vacuum tubes this was also potentially dangerous to equipment but most solid-state devices tolerate this condition well. A three-conductor socket could be wired as an unbalanced mono socket to ground the ring in this situation, but the more conventional wiring is to leave the ring unconnected, exactly simulating a mono socket.|$|R

This paper examines the influence of fiber orientation and fiber length on electrical properties of PALF reinforced Bisphenol-A composite and explores the potential of using PALF as reinforcing material for electrical applications such as terminals, connectors, motor body cover, industrial and household <b>plugs</b> and <b>circuit</b> boards. The resistance and inductance of resin material is increased by 24. 19 % and 24. 13 % respectively after reinforcement of PALF in different orientations and its value increased by 37. 93 % and 37. 81 % respectively after reinforcement of PALF in different lengths. Similarly, Capacitance and Dielectric constant of resin material decreased by 19. 44 % and 19. 39 % respectively after reinforcement of PALF in different orientations and its value decreased by 27. 67 % and 27. 50 % respectively after reinforcement of PALF in different lengths.

40|$|It is a {{pleasure}} to be here to help celebrate Mike Boardman’s 60 th birthday. 1 I have just finished writing a history of stable algebraic topology from the end of World War II through 1966 [18]. The starting point was natural enough. The paper of Eilenberg and Mac Lane [6] that introduced the categorical language we now all speak appeared in 1945, and so did the paper of Eilenberg and Steenrod [7] that announced the axiomatic treatment of homology and cohomology. The ending point was more artificial, at first dictated by constraints of time and energy and the fact that Steenrod’s compendium of Mathematical Reviews in topology contained all reviews published through 1967 and thus all papers published through 1966. It also made it easy for me to be modest and impersonal. Although I got my PhD in 1964, I only <b>plugged</b> into the <b>circuit</b> and began to know what was going on when I arrived at Chicago, at the end of 1966. Mike also got his PhD in 1964. Since he is two years older than I am, I guess he was a little slow. But then, his thesis was a lot more important than mine was, although people at the time didn’t seem to understand that. Its results became available in a mimeographed summary in 1966. So maybe 1966 wasn’t such a bad stopping point mathematically. It is amazing how much we didn’t know then, how many familiar names had not yet made their mark. In fact, a complete list of the people who made sustained and important contributions to the development of stable algebraic topology in the years 1945 through 1966 would have no more than around 40 names on it. On the other hand, the caliber of the people working in the field was extraordinary...|$|R
40|$|This {{paper is}} focused on characterising small waste {{electric}} and electronic equipment, specifically small household appliances, from two different points of views: disassembly properties and material identification. The sample for this characterisation was obtained from a selective collection campaign organised in Castellón de la Plana (Spain). A total amount of 833. 7 kg (749 units) of small waste electric and electronic equipment was collected, of which 23. 3 % by weight and 22. 4 % by units belonged to the subcategory household equipment. This subcategory, composed of appliances such as vacuum cleaners, toasters, sandwich makers, hand blenders, juicers, coffee makers, hairdryers, scales, irons and heaters, was first disassembled in order to analyse {{different aspects of the}} disassembly process for each equipment type: type of joints, ease of identification of materials, ease of access to joints for extracting components, ease of separation of components from the whole, uniformity of tools needed for the disassembly process and possibility of reassembly after disassembly. Results show that the most common joints used in these equipment types are snap-fits and screws, although some permanent joints have also been identified. Next, the material composition of each component of each appliance belonging to each equipment type was identified visually and with additional mechanical trials and testing. It can be observed that plastic and electric/electronic components are present in all the equipment types analysed and are also the material fractions that appear with higher percentages in the material composition: 41. 1 wt% and 39. 1 wt% for the plastic fraction and electric/electronic components, respectively. The most common plastics are: polypropylene (PP), acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS) and polycarbonate (PC), while the most common electric/electronic components are: cable, <b>plug</b> and printed <b>circuit</b> boards. Results also show that disassembly properties and material characterisation vary widely from one equipment type to another. The authors wish to thank all the schools and families who collaborated during the campaign for the selective collection of domestic small waste electrical and electronic equipment, and the company Reciplana Recuperacions S. L. for their assistance during the stages of transportation and final treatment of the sample after its characterisation.
