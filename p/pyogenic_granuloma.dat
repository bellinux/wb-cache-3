Sporadically, mucocele and <b>pyogenic</b> <b>granulomas</b> can be present. Aim: To describe GVHD oral manifestations in eight allogenic BMT patients, and discuss GVHD and drug-immunosuppresion associated lesions diagnosis and treatment. Study design: For a year, we examined the oral mucosa of eight consecutive allogenic BMT patients attending the Dermatology outpatient clinic at the Instituto Nacional de Cancerología (National Institute of Oncology) in Mexico City, looking for oral mucosa lesions. Results: Patients were five men and three women, ages 24. 8 ± 9. 7 years. Four had a BMT because of chronic granulocytic-, two for acute myeloblastic-, one for acute lymphoblastic- leukemia, and one for aplastic anemia. Three patients developed acute GVHD, with reticular oral mucosa lesions, erythema and mucositis; and all eight developed chronic GVHD, with reticular oral lesions, erythema, and ulcerations. A Patient had tongue and cheek <b>pyogenic</b> <b>granulomas.</b> Six reported xerostomía. Other oral lesions, associated to drug-immunosuppression, were candidiasis and herpes simplex. Conclusions: Patients with GVHD frequently develop oral lesions, some of which interfere with normal feeding; timely diagnosis and treatment are therefore essential {{to improve the quality}} of life of affected patients.

40|$|Introduction. Although <b>pyogenic</b> <b>granulomas</b> (PG) {{are common}} and benign {{vascular}} proliferations {{of the skin}} and mucous membranes, they are relatively rare on the vulva. Case Presentation. A 57 -year-old G 7 P 7 postmenopausal woman presented with a 3 -year history of a foul smell and bleeding lesions in the genital region. A gynecologic examination revealed multiple large papillomatous, pedunculated, and lobulated lesions that were cherry-red and infective in appearance. There was a 2 -cm lesion at the upper intersection of the labia majora, a 2 -cm lesion on the right labium majus, and a 4 -cm lesion on the clitoris. The patient complained of itching, and the lesions were asymptomatic, except for occasional bleeding. All lesions were excised and sent for histopathological examination, which revealed an ulcerated polypoidal structure with extensive proliferation of vascular channels lined by a single layer of endothelium. The histopathological features were consistent with PG. Conclusion. The present case is the first case of multiple <b>pyogenic</b> <b>granulomas</b> on the vulva in a postmenopausal woman...|$|R
40|$|AbstractObjective(s) The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} the expressions of two angiogenic immune-markers (CD- 31 and VEGF), and one proliferative immune-marker (Ki- 67) in oral <b>pyogenic</b> <b>granulomas</b> (PG), hemangiomas (Hem) and inflammatory gingivitis (IG). Materials and MethodsSixty cases of PG, Hem and IG (twenty cases each) were examined. Immunohistochemical (IHC) staining was performed based on routine techniques. The microvessel density (MVD) index was also evaluated. ResultsThe male to female ratio was 1 : 2. The mean age was 33. 3 years old (± 20. 52). The reactivity percentages for all three markers (CD- 31, VEGF and Ki- 67) were significantly higher in PG compared to Hem (56. 8 %, 13. 8 % and 23. 0 % vs. 28. 3 %, 7. 0 % and 5. 4 %, respectively). The mean MVD in PG was also significantly higher than in Hem (26. 1 ± 0. 11 vs. 13. 6 ± 0. 08). There was no statistically significant difference between PG and IG. ConclusionThe current study supports the common nature of <b>pyogenic</b> <b>granulomas</b> and inflammatory gingivitis...|$|R
50|$|Prognosis {{is usually}} good, however {{recurrence}} may happen with rate up to 16%. Presence of myxoid {{structures in the}} <b>pyogenic</b> <b>granuloma</b> may be {{the main cause of}} recurrence.|$|E
50|$|One {{study has}} {{suggested}} {{a correlation between}} pyogenic granulomas and Bartonella seropositivity. However, this association has been questioned by others. The microscopic appearance of a <b>pyogenic</b> <b>granuloma</b> consists of highly vascular granulation tissue. Inflammation is present. The lesion may have a fibrous character if it is older, and the surface may have ulcerations. Pyogenic granulomas rarely occur in the conjunctiva, cornea or connective tissue of the eye following minor local trauma. Grossly these mass lesions resemble those occurring at more common sites. The relationship of these lesion to lobular capillary hemangiomas of skin and oropharyngeal mucosa {{commonly referred to as}} <b>pyogenic</b> <b>granuloma</b> is uncertain.|$|E
50|$|The {{appearance}} of <b>pyogenic</b> <b>granuloma</b> {{is usually a}} color ranging from red/pink to purple, and can be smooth or lobulated. Younger lesions {{are more likely to}} be red because of the high number of blood vessels. Older lesions begin to change into a pink color. Size commonly ranges from a few millimeters to centimeters, though smaller or larger lesions may occur. A <b>pyogenic</b> <b>granuloma</b> can be painful, especially if located in an area of the body where it is constantly disturbed. Pyogenic granulomas can grow rapidly and will often bleed profusely with little or no trauma. They may exude an oil like substance, causing the surface to be damp. This is especially true if the granuloma is located on the scalp.|$|E
40|$|Erlotinib {{is a small}} {{molecule}} {{tyrosine kinase}} inhibitor that is used as an anticancer agent. Most patients develop a pustular facial dermatitis within {{the first week of}} treatment. <b>Pyogenic</b> <b>granulomas</b> of the nail folds are another typical adverse event occurring in about 10 - 15 % of cases. We report on a patient who developed a generalized dermatitis characterized by neutrophilic spongiosis. Neutrophilic inflammation has been observed in several drugs that interfere with EGFR signaling, suggesting a class effect. The present case may be yet another manifestation of this particular reaction pattern...|$|R
40|$|Simple {{surgical}} excision {{is associated}} with a low risk of recurrence, but often leaves a visible scar. Curettage or shave excision, with cautery, is more likely to succeed in 1 session than cryotherapy; both may leave a smaller scar than surgery. Laser therapy, which may require multiple sessions, and sclerotherapy may be least likely to cause visible scarring (strength of recommendation [SOR]: C, small cohort studies and case series). Untreated <b>pyogenic</b> <b>granulomas</b> regress spontaneously within 6 to 18 months with some risk of scarring (SOR: C, a subset of patients in a retrospective cohort study) ...|$|R
50|$|An eccrine poroma {{specifically}} {{refers to}} a tumor derived specifically from the most apical portion of eccrine sweat gland (acrosyringium). They are most commonly found on acral distribution (on palms & soles), and most commonly in adults. They are described as <1-2 cm pink/red shiny, exophytic lesions that can be pigmented and are clinically very similar to <b>pyogenic</b> <b>granulomas.</b> Histologically, the cells as PAS-positive and clearly surrounded by normal keratinocytes. These tumors are surgically excised usually without complication or recurrence, although malignant porocarcinomas can recur and metastasize to local lymph nodes.|$|R
50|$|Neoplasms of the nailbed {{may often}} present with paronychia, ingrown nail, onycholysis, <b>pyogenic</b> <b>granuloma,</b> nail-plate dystrophy, {{longitudinal}} erythronychia, bleeding, and discolorations. There are various benign and malignant neoplasms {{that may occur}} in or overlying the nail matrix and in the nailbed, and symptoms may include pain, itching, and throbbing.|$|E
50|$|The {{differential}} for OSSN includes pterygium, pingueculum, papilloma, solar keratosis, lipoma, lymphoma, chronic blepharoconjunctivitis, inflammation, melanoma, ocular pannus, <b>pyogenic</b> <b>granuloma,</b> kaposi sarcoma, keratocanthoma, mucoepidermoid carcinoma, pseudoepitheliomatous hyperplasia, and adenocarcinoma. While confocal microscopy can be {{used for}} diagnosis, biopsy is considered the standard, especially before treatment with a cytotoxic medication.|$|E
5000|$|Also {{termed a}} [...] "pregnancy tumor" [...] or [...] "granuloma gravidarum", this lesion is {{identical}} to a <b>pyogenic</b> <b>granuloma</b> in all respects apart {{from the fact that}} it occurs exclusively in pregnant females. There is usually pregnancy gingivitis also. Pregnancy epulis commonly occurs during the third trimester of pregnancy.|$|E
50|$|This type of epulis {{is neither}} pyogenic ("pus producing") nor a true granuloma, {{but it is}} a {{vascular}} lesion. About 75% of all <b>pyogenic</b> <b>granulomas</b> occur on the gingiva, although they may also occur elsewhere in the mouth or {{other parts of the body}} (where the term epulis is inappropriate). This common oral lesion is thought to be a reaction to irritation of the tissues and poor oral hygiene. It is more common in younger people and in females, and appears as a red-purple swelling and bleeds easily.|$|R
40|$|Granuloma gravidarum and {{pregnancy}} tumor are terms used {{to describe}} <b>pyogenic</b> <b>granulomas</b> that occur during pregnancy.

50|$|Peripheral ossifying fibroma “a gingival nodule {{which is}} {{composed}} of a cellular fibroblastic connective tissue stroma which {{is associated with the}} formation of randomly dispersed foci of mineralised products, which consists of bone, cementum-like tissue, or a dystrophic calcification. The lesion is considered part of an ossifying fibroma, but that is usually considered to be a gnathic tumor. Because of its overwhelming incidence on the gingiva, the condition is associated with two other diseases, though not because they occur together. Instead, the three are associated with each other because they appear frequently on gingiva: <b>pyogenic</b> <b>granuloma</b> and peripheral giant cell granuloma. Some researchers believe peripheral ossifying fibromas to be related to pyogenic fibromas and, in some instances, are the result of a <b>pyogenic</b> <b>granuloma</b> which has undergone fibrosis and calcification.|$|E
50|$|There are two types, {{longitudinal}} and transverse melanonychia. Longitudinal melanonychia {{may be a}} sign of subungual melanoma (acral lentiginous melanoma), {{although there}} are other diagnoses such as chronic paronychia, onychomycosis, subungual hematoma, <b>pyogenic</b> <b>granuloma,</b> glomus tumour, subungual verruca, mucous cyst, subungual fibroma, keratoacanthoma, carcinoma of the nail bed, and subungual exostosis.|$|E
40|$|<b>Pyogenic</b> <b>granulomas</b> (PGs) in {{the oral}} cavity present as an {{inflammatory}} hyperplasia usually caused by trauma, hormonal imbalance, chronic irritation, or as the response {{to a wide variety}} of drugs. PGs with atypical presentation and behavior may clinically mimic malignant tumors. Thus, histological examination is required to rule out cancer development. Lesions {{in the oral}} cavity have been described to be either an isolated entity or present in multiple forms and with multiple recurrences. Conservative surgical excision is the standard choice of treatment in almost every scenario. However, the severity of the lesions and the affected sites often challenge surgical treatment. In this report, we describe the clinical scenario of a recurrent PG, where surgical excision of the lesion was questioned. As an alternative, we describe a noninvasive approach with lesional steroid injections...|$|R
40|$|Intravascular {{papillary}} endothelial hyperplasia (IPEH) or reactive vascular endothelial lesion {{is a rare}} benign {{condition and}} {{is also known as}} Masson's hemangioma.
