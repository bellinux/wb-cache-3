5000|$|When {{incumbent}} Republican Representative Fred Baldwin {{announced his}} retirement {{to run for the}} Wyoming Senate, Crank declared his candidacy. He faced candidates Scott Heiner, Zem Hopkins, Kevin Simpson, and Lyle Williams in the Republican <b>primary.</b> <b>Crank</b> initially won the primary by 42 votes, but primary voters in one Sweetwater County precinct received the wrong ballot, leading Wyoming Secretary of State Ed Murray to call a special election. [...] While candidate Scott Heiner won the most votes in the special election, it was not enough {{to make up for the}} deficit, making Crank the winner with 32% of the vote. [...] Crank defeated Democratic nominee Michele Irwin in the general election with 80% of the vote.|$|E
