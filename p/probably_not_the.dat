5|$|The Chronicles {{version of}} events makes it appear that Baldred was driven out shortly after the battle, but this was <b>probably</b> <b>not</b> <b>the</b> case. A {{document}} from Kent survives which gives the date, March 826, as being {{in the third year}} of the reign of Beornwulf. This makes it likely that Beornwulf still had authority in Kent at this date, as Baldred's overlord; hence Baldred was apparently still in power. In Essex, Ecgberht expelled King Sigered, though the date is unknown. It may have been delayed until 829, since a later chronicler associates the expulsion with a campaign of Ecgberht's in that year against the Mercians.|$|E
5|$|The {{carousel}} {{was commissioned}} by William Hubbs, who had it installed in White City Amusement Park in 1917. Built on a Mangel-Illions mechanism, it used animals carved by the Dentzel carousel company of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, sometime before 1900. The carousel was assembled by the William F. Mangels carousel company in 1917. It was <b>probably</b> <b>not</b> <b>the</b> first carousel in the park, as there are indications of a previous ride that came from Hartford, Connecticut.|$|E
5|$|The {{expedition}} {{headed by}} Louis Jolliet and Jacques Marquette in 1673, though <b>probably</b> <b>not</b> <b>the</b> first Europeans {{to visit the}} area, are the first recorded to have crossed the Chicago Portage and travelled along the Chicago River. Marquette returned in 1674, camped a few days {{near the mouth of}} the river, then moved on to the portage, where he stayed through the winter of 1674–75. Joliet and Marquette did not report any Indians living near the Chicago River area at this time, though archaeologists have since discovered numerous Indian village sites elsewhere in the Chicago area. Two of La Salle's men built a stockade at the portage in the winter of 1682/1683.|$|E

5|$|Early {{use of the}} NS-10 among {{engineers}} include Bob Clearmountain, Rhett Davies, and Bill Scheniman in the US, and Nigel Jopson in the UK. Clearmountain, then {{a rising}} star in record production, is often credited for {{the popularity of the}} NS-10; Phil Ward, writing in Sound on Sound, suggested that Clearmountain was <b>probably</b> <b>not</b> <b>the</b> earliest, but was certainly the most influential early adopter. It became a legend that Clearmountain had chosen it because it was the worst speaker he could find. He was one of a new breed of creative freelance recording engineers and producers who would travel from studio to studio equipped with their own gear that included microphones, and a pair of Yamaha NS-10, as a reference.|$|E
5|$|In 1977 Barsbold {{suggested}} that oviraptorids fed on molluscs, but Longrich and colleagues {{rejected the idea}} that they practised shell-crushing altogether, since such animals tend to have teeth with broad crushing surfaces. Instead, the shape of the dentary bones in the lower jaws of oviraptorids suggests they had a sharp-edged beak used for shearing tough food, not for cracking hard food items such as bivalves or eggs. The symphyseal shelf {{at the front of the}} dentary may have given some ability for crushing, but as this was a relatively small area, it was <b>probably</b> <b>not</b> <b>the</b> main function of the jaws. The fact that most oviraptorids have been found in sediments that are interpreted as having been xeric and arid or semi-arid environments also argues against them having been specialised eaters of shellfish and eggs, as it is unlikely there would have been enough of these items under such conditions to support them.|$|E

25|$|A {{much more}} {{plausible}} {{theory is that}} the templon models, in both form and content, the decorative wall of the Torah screen in Jewish synagogues of the 2nd and 3rd centuries. These, too, had three main divisions: a central door leading to the altar, smaller flanking passages, and a distribution of parts similar to a templon. The Torah screen was <b>probably</b> <b>not</b> <b>the</b> direct prototype of the templon; it probably derives from the imitation of the Torah screen in the altar of a typical Syrian pagan temple.|$|E
25|$|The Jews, {{with the}} {{sanction}} of the king, {{had their own}} organizations and secretaries or representatives appointed by themselves. The following are frequently mentioned as acting in that capacity {{in the first half}} of the 14th century: Abraham Malaquin, Hayum Cohen, Jucef Barqui, Vital and Judah Cresques, Jacob Cohen, Rafael Dayen, the families Natgar, Sasportas, Xulelli, Moses Ramon, Sadon (Sadoc) b. Dahut (David). The last is <b>probably</b> <b>not</b> <b>the</b> same as the Sayd b. David who was publicly burned (Aug. 12, 1381) for incontinence with a nun.|$|E
25|$|On 25 June 1879, however, Stout {{resigned}} {{both from}} cabinet and from parliament, citing {{the need to}} focus on his law practice. His partner in the practice was growing increasingly ill, and the success of his firm was important to the welfare of both Stout and his family. Throughout his career, Stout found the cost of participating in politics a serious worry. His legal career, however, was <b>probably</b> <b>not</b> <b>the</b> only contributing factor to his resignation, with a falling out between Stout and George Grey having occurred shortly beforehand.|$|E

25|$|The Gospel of Mark is anonymous. Early Christian {{tradition}} ascribes it to John Mark, {{a companion}} and interpreter of the apostle Peter. Hence its author {{is often called}} Mark, even though most modern scholars are doubtful of the Markan tradition and instead regard the author as unknown. It was probably written c. AD 66–70, during Nero's persecution of the Christians in Rome or the Jewish revolt, as suggested by internal references to war in Judea and to persecution. The author {{used a variety of}} pre-existing sources, such as conflict stories (Mark 2:1–3:6), apocalyptic discourse (4:1–35), and collections of sayings (although not the Gospel of Thomas and <b>probably</b> <b>not</b> <b>the</b> Q source).|$|E
25|$|When Lillywhite {{headed off}} to New Zealand he left Melbourne cricketer John Conway to arrange the match for their return. Conway ignored the cricket {{associations}} in each colony and selected his own Australian team, negotiating directly with the players. Not only was the team he selected of doubtful representation {{but it was also}} <b>probably</b> <b>not</b> <b>the</b> strongest available as some players had declined to take part for various reasons. Demon bowler Fred Spofforth refused to play because wicket-keeper Billy Murdoch was not selected. Paceman Frank Allan was at Warnambool Agricultural Show and Australia’s best all-rounder Edwin Evans could not get away from work. In the end only five Australian-born players were selected.|$|E
25|$|Notes: 1) The {{story has}} some {{parallels}} to {{the legend of}} John Henry. 2) In this story it is learned that England's American colonies broke off into a new nation - the Federated Commonwealths of America - in 1738, and westward expansion began much sooner than in our history, {{due to the lack}} of indigenous humans in the regions to be colonized. 3) The character Trevithick is American rather than British, and appears to be 20 years older than his historic age, so he is <b>probably</b> <b>not</b> <b>the</b> historical figure but an analog. In Turtledove works, it is common for historic figures to have fictitious offspring (as with Edward Wingfield's daughter and her own great-grandson Thomas Kenton above) as a result of the butterfly effect.|$|E

25|$|After the {{negotiations}} with Nasser ended, the Syrian {{government tried to}} maintain the illusion that they were continuing. On 2 May, Bitar's government issued a decree calling for the nationalization of all Syrian banks. According to historian Itamar Rabinovich, this was <b>probably</b> <b>not</b> <b>the</b> first step to establish a state-owned economy. Rabinovich said that this move was intended to deceive the Egyptians and the Nasserites; Nasser had previously told Bitar that {{the first step to}} revolutionary change was the nationalization of the banking sector. Bitar's policy statements at the time were moderate and did not explain the 2 May decree, but planning minister Zuhur stated that the reason for the decree was that the banks were too powerful, were exploiting people, and had too strong an influence within the political system.|$|E
25|$|Louis Jolliet and Jacques Marquette, though <b>probably</b> <b>not</b> <b>the</b> first Europeans {{to visit}} the area, are the first {{recorded}} to have visited the Chicago River in 1673, when they wrote of their discovery of the geographically vital Chicago Portage. Marquette returned in 1674, camped a few days {{near the mouth of}} the river, then moved on to the Chicago River–Des Plaines River portage, where he stayed through the winter of 1674–75. The Fox Wars effectively closed the Chicago area to Europeans {{in the first part of}} the 18th century. The first non-native to re-settle in the area may have been a trader named Guillory, who might have had a trading-post near Wolf Point on the Chicago River in around 1778. In 1823 a government expedition used the name Gary River (phonetic spelling of Guillory) to refer to the north branch of the Chicago River.|$|E

He was also <b>probably</b> <b>not</b> <b>the</b> founder of the Bishopric of Mortlach-Aberdeen.

500|$|W. L.

Chrimes agrees that Glanvill was <b>probably</b> <b>not</b> <b>the</b> author, and feels that Walter likely was, although he could not be certain. If he was the author, he composed what Chrimes called a [...] "great literary memorial of Henry II's government". Neither of Walter's two modern biographers, however, feel that he was the author of the Tractatus, and the historian Ralph Turner agrees. The historian Michael Clanchy says of Walter [...] "The proliferation of documents was a European and a continuing phenomenon, yet if it were to be associated in England with one man, he would be Hubert Walter." ...|$|E
500|$|A {{woman named}} Mărușca (or Mărica) most {{probably}} {{gave birth to}} Stephen's first recognized son, Alexandru. Historian Ioan-Aurel Pop describes Mărușca as Stephen's first wife, but other researches note that {{the legitimacy of the}} Stephen–Mărușca marriage is uncertain. According to Jonathan Eagles, Alexandru either died in childhood, or survived infancy and became his father's co-ruler. This older Alexandru died in July 1496, not before marrying a daughter of Bartholomew Drágfi, the Transylvanian Voivode. He is <b>probably</b> <b>not</b> <b>the</b> same Alexandru who, in 1486, was sent by Stephen as a voluntary hostage to Istanbul, where he married a Byzantine noblewoman. This Alexandru was still alive {{by the end of his}} father's rule and beyond, when he became a pretender to the throne, and ultimately a contested prince. A 1538 letter by Fabio Mignanelli describes the surviving Alexandru, or [...] "Sandrin", as a posthumous son of Stephen, but this is likely an error.|$|E

[...] "He doesn't appear as if he's supremely self-assured. [...] He's more of a regular kid who can take on the complexities of the role and become a hero". Perry was amazed by Sawa's vulnerability in acting, describing him as [...] "a very distinctive actor. He's very loose and he's kind of a cut-up when he's not on camera, but the moment the camera's on, I'd never seen anybody to completely slide right through the moment".|$|E
