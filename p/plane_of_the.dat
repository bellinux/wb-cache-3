5|$|The {{orbit of}} Pallas was {{determined}} by Gauss, who found the period of 4.6 years {{was similar to the}} period for Ceres. Pallas has a relatively high orbital inclination to the <b>plane</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> ecliptic.|$|E
5|$|A {{limitation}} of the radial velocity method used to discover the planet is that only a lower limit on the mass can be obtained. Further astrometric observations with the Hubble Space Telescope on the outer planet 55 Cancri d suggest that planet is inclined at 53° to the <b>plane</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> sky; but innermost b and e are inclined at 85°. Planet c's inclination is unknown.|$|E
5|$|Also, because real tires have {{a finite}} contact patch {{with the road}} surface that can {{generate}} a scrub torque, and when in a turn, can experience some side slipping as they roll, they can generate torques about an axis normal to the <b>plane</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> contact patch.|$|E

50|$|The Forgotten Realms {{cosmology}} {{was originally}} {{the same as}} that of a standard Dungeons & Dragons campaign. The cosmology for <b>the</b> 3rd edition <b>of</b> D&D was altered substantially so that it contained twenty-six Outer Planes, arranged in a tree-like structure around <b>the</b> central 'trunk' <b>of</b> <b>the</b> material <b>plane</b> <b>of</b> Toril. Unlike <b>the</b> Outer <b>Planes</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> standard D&D cosmology which were heavily alignment-based, <b>the</b> Outer <b>Planes</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Forgotten Realms cosmology were faith-based. <b>The</b> <b>planes</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Forgotten Realms were retooled in the 4th edition to match the new default cosmology, with many <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>planes</b> or realms being relocated to the Astral Sea, and a handful now located in the Elemental Chaos.|$|R
5|$|Astrometric {{observations}} {{made with}} the Hubble Space Telescope suggest that the outer planet 55 Cancri d is inclined at 53° {{with respect to the}} <b>plane</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> sky. The inner planets b and e are inclined at 85°. The inclination of f is unknown.|$|E
5|$|In 1998 the {{discovery}} of a possible dust disk around 55 Cancri A was announced. Calculations gave the disk radius at least 40AU, similar to the Kuiper belt in the Solar System, with an inclination of 25° with respect to the <b>plane</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> sky. However, {{the discovery}} could not be verified and was later deemed to be spurious, caused instead by background galaxies.|$|E
5|$|In 2001, {{preliminary}} astrometric measurements {{made by the}} Hipparcos probe {{suggested the}} orbit of 47 UMa b is inclined at an angle of 63.1° to the <b>plane</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> sky, implying the planet's true mass is around 2.9 times that of Jupiter. However, subsequent analysis suggested the Hipparcos measurements were not precise enough to accurately determine the orbits of substellar companions, and the inclination and true mass remain unknown.|$|E

5|$|Lipid bilayers exhibit {{high levels}} of {{birefringence}} where the refractive index in the <b>plane</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> bilayer differs from that perpendicular {{by as much as}} 0.1 refractive index units.

5|$|Most {{asteroid}}s {{within the}} asteroid belt have orbital eccentricities of less than 0.4, and an inclination of less than 30°. The orbital distribution of the asteroids reaches a maximum at an eccentricity of around 0.07 and an inclination below 4°. Thus although a typical asteroid has a relatively circular orbit and lies near the <b>plane</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> ecliptic, some asteroid orbits can be highly eccentric or travel well outside the ecliptic plane.|$|E
5|$|Most of {{the major}} bodies of the Solar System orbit the Sun in nearly the same plane. This is likely due {{to the way in}} which the Solar System formed from a protoplanetary disk. Probably the closest current {{representation}} of the disk is known as the invariable <b>plane</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Solar System. Earth's orbit, and hence, the ecliptic, is inclined a little more than 1° to the invariable plane, and the other major planets are also within about 6° of it. Because of this, most Solar System bodies appear very close to the ecliptic in the sky. The ecliptic is well defined by the motion of the Sun. The invariable plane is defined by the angular momentum of the entire Solar System, essentially the summation of all of the orbital motions and rotations of all the bodies of the system, a somewhat uncertain value that requires precise knowledge of every object in the system. For these reasons, the ecliptic is used as the reference <b>plane</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Solar System out of convenience.|$|E

In order to perform the collision detection fast, side <b>planes</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> spatula model are excluded from colliding planes. Thus, the algorithm can only detect collision on <b>the</b> largest two <b>planes</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> spatula.|$|R

5|$|Pallas's {{surface is}} most likely {{composed}} of a silicate material; its spectrum and estimated density resemble carbonaceous chondrite meteorites. With an orbital inclination of 34.8°, Pallas's orbit is unusually highly inclined to the <b>plane</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> asteroid belt, and its orbital eccentricity is nearly as large as that of Pluto, making Pallas relatively inaccessible to spacecraft.|$|E
5|$|The 10 man command group {{proceeded}} to drive vehicles to LZ Hotel, purposely disabling them to block vehicle access from {{any part of}} the city, other than the road from the Embassy to the LZ.

5|$|The Moon's {{orbit around}} the Earth is {{inclined}} at an angle of just over 5 degrees to the <b>plane</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Earth's {{orbit around the}} Sun (the ecliptic). Because of this, {{at the time of}} a new moon, the Moon will usually pass to the north or south of the Sun.

5|$|The {{dynamical}} {{effects of}} Planet Nine would explain five {{aspects of the}} Solar System: the clustering of the orbits of extreme trans-Neptunian objects (eTNOs); the high perihelia of objects like Sedna that are detached from Neptune's influence; the high inclinations of eTNOs with orbits roughly perpendicular to the <b>plane</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Solar System, high inclination Kuiper belt objects with semi-major axis less than 100 AU, and the obliquity, or tilt, of the Sun's axis relative to the <b>plane</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Solar System. While other mechanisms have been offered {{for many of these}} peculiarities the gravitational influence of Planet Nine {{is the only one that}} explains all five. The dynamical effects of Planet Nine also excite the inclinations of scattering objects, which in numerical simulations leaves the inclination distribution of short-period comets with a broader distribution than is observed.|$|E
