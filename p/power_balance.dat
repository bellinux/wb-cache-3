5|$|On September 26, 1964, Nguyễn Khánh and {{the senior}} {{officers}} in his military junta created a semblance of civilian rule by forming the High National Council (HNC), an appointed advisory body akin to a legislature. This came after lobbying by American officials—led by Ambassador Maxwell Taylor—in Vietnam, as they placed great value in the appearance of civilian legitimacy, which they saw as vital to building a popular base for any government. Khánh put his rival General Dương Văn Minh—who he had deposed in a January 1964 coup—in charge of picking the 17 members of the HNC, and Minh filled it with figures sympathetic to him. The HNC then made a resolution to recommend a political model with a powerful head of state, which would likely be Minh, given their sympathy towards him. Khánh did not want his rival taking power, so he and the Americans convinced the HNC to dilute {{the powers of the}} position to make it unappealing to Minh, who was then sent on an overseas diplomatic goodwill tour to remove him from the political scene. However, Minh was back in South Vietnam after a few months and the <b>power</b> <b>balance</b> in the junta was still fragile.|$|E
5|$|Militarily {{weaker than}} NATO, Khrushchev wanted to install Soviet R-12 MRBM nuclear {{missiles}} on Cuba {{to even the}} <b>power</b> <b>balance.</b> Although conflicted, Castro agreed, believing it would guarantee Cuba's safety and enhance the cause of socialism. Undertaken in secrecy, only the Castro brothers, Guevara, Dorticós and security chief Ramiro Valdés knew the full plan. Upon discovering it through aerial reconnaissance, in October the U.S. implemented an island-wide quarantine to search vessels headed to Cuba, sparking the Cuban Missile Crisis. The U.S. saw the missiles as offensive; Castro insisted they were for defense only. Castro urged Khrushchev to threaten a nuclear strike on the U.S. should Cuba be attacked, but Khrushchev was desperate to avoid nuclear war. Castro was {{left out of the}} negotiations, in which Khruschev agreed to remove the missiles in exchange for a U.S. commitment not to invade Cuba and an understanding that the U.S. would remove their MRBMs from Turkey and Italy. Feeling betrayed by Khruschev, Castro was furious and soon fell ill. Proposing a five-point plan, Castro demanded that the U.S. end its embargo, withdraw from Guantanamo Bay Naval Base, cease supporting dissidents, and stop violating Cuban air space and territorial waters. Presenting these demands to U Thant, visiting Secretary-General of the United Nations, the U.S. ignored them, and in turn Castro refused to allow the U.N.'s inspection team into Cuba.|$|E
5|$|The <b>power</b> <b>balance</b> {{began to}} change after King Rajendra came of age and his grandmother, Tripurasundari, died on 26 March 1832 due to cholera. Bhimsen lost his main support and the court became a stage for a power struggle, which even though started off {{as an attempt to}} assert the King's {{authority}} from the Mukhtiyar, spread to various aristocratic clans and their attempt to secure total authority. It was no secret that Bhimsen was able to maintain his supremacy due to the large standing army under his and his family's command; and in the subsequent years, different factions would attempt to increase their influence based on the strength of the number of battalions under their grip. After Tripurasundari's death, the royal seal by which government orders were approved naturally went {{into the hands of the}} senior queen Samrajya Laxmi, who knew all too well of its powers and wanted to emulate the queens of the past by establishing her own regency. Sensing Samrajya Laxmi's ambition, Ranbir Singh started to stroke her dislike of Bhimsen in the hopes of becoming the mukhtiyar himself. Getting a whiff of this matter, Bhimsen strongly reprimanded Ranbir Singh which caused him to resign from his General's position and live in retirement in his house at Sipamandan. However, Bhimsen later managed to placate his brother, by giving him the title of Chota (Little) General, and send him to Palpa as its governor. Since he could find nobody that he could trust to keep watch over the royal palace, Bhimsen from then on started to live in an ordinary rented house located near the palace premise.|$|E

40|$|Electricity {{generation}} in Denmark {{is undergoing a}} gradual transition from taking place in a few large power-plants to taking place at many small and geographically scattered CHP (combined heat and power) and wind-power plants. A new situation is thus being created for the transmission grid. From a mainly unidirectional flow from the few large power plants to the scattered consumption points, the flow is changing to a bidirectional flow subject to scattered electricity production. In this article, {{the requirements of the}} transmission grid are analysed in (a) a year 2020 situation with <b>power</b> <b>balancing</b> (matching production and consumption) as it is now on the few large power plants, and (b) a year 2020 situation with geographically-scattered <b>power</b> <b>balancing</b> using e. g.

40|$|Electric power {{generated}} by wind power stations is unstable {{and difficult to}} use;both by connecting to the network or to the devices working in the micro network. In order to reduce power fluctuations in the electrical system, the power fluctuations generated by the wind power station can be balanced by using a supercapacitor energy storage system. In this study, the model of <b>power</b> <b>balancing</b> of wind <b>power</b> station consists of a wind turbine, the alternative current load and wind <b>power</b> <b>balancing</b> system. In order to clearly identify operating principles of this model, we consider that the load is stable and unchanging, and the voltage is constant. Thewind <b>power</b> <b>balancing</b> system operating principle {{is based on the}} first Kirchofo rule and consists of the system of supercapacitors and an AC/DC three-phase controlled rectifier. An AC/DC three-phase controlled rectifier has six insulated gate bipolar transistors, which are controlled by pulse width modulated signal. This signal is generated by comparing the data values of wind {{power generated}} current and reference current. The Energy storage system consists of a series of supercapacitors connected in series and parallel. The Theoretical model of wind <b>power</b> capacity <b>balancing</b> is based on computerized mathematical modeling software „Matlab“.

However, the outcomes of the wind <b>power</b> <b>balancing</b> system are affected by the current measurement data sampling time duration. Increasing themeasurement sample time duration results in the decrease of the data curve ripple of output result, but it also reduces the amount of balanced energy in comparison to the data deduction values. The Wind <b>power</b> <b>balancing</b> system investment costs account for only sixteen percent of the wind power station installation price.
