50|$|Front Row was a {{media center}} {{software}} application for Apple's Macintosh computers and Apple TV for navigating and viewing video, <b>photos,</b> <b>podcasts,</b> and music from a computer, optical disc, or the Internet through a 10-foot user interface (similar to Windows Media Center and Kodi). The software relies on iTunes and iPhoto and {{is controlled by}} an Apple Remote or the keyboard function keys. The first version was released October 2005, with two major revisions since. Front Row was removed and discontinued in Mac OS X 10.7.|$|R
50|$|This release {{came with}} many new {{applications}} mainly focused on enhanced security and user friendliness. The distribution includes over 12,800 new packages, {{for a total}} of over 37,493 packages. Most of the software in the distribution has been updated: over 20,160 software packages (this is 70% of all packages in Savir). BOSS 5.0 supports Linux Standard Base (LSB) version 4.1.

50|$|Aiming {{to improve}} {{on the design of}} the {{original}} Zune, the Zune 80 is 3.6 millimeters thinner and 31 grams lighter. It also has a slightly larger screen (3.2 inches instead of 3) and higher battery life (up to 24 hours for music, versus up to 14). The D-pad of the original has been replaced by the patented Zune Pad, which supplements 5-way clicking using a capacitive touchpad similar to the iPod Click Wheel and only responding to human touch. The Zune 80 shipped with a newer firmware version than the original Zune, but a firmware update for the original restored parity. The Wi-Fi antenna can be used for buying music on the device, playing others in games via Wi-Fi, wireless synchronization and to share <b>photos,</b> <b>podcasts,</b> and music with other Zunes, although shared songs may only be played three times on the receiving Zune.|$|R

50|$|Building brand {{awareness}} and credibility {{is a key}} implication of good public relations. In some cases, great hype is built about new designers' collections before they are released into the market, due to the immense exposure generated by practitioners. Social media, such as blogs, micro blogs, <b>podcasts,</b> <b>photo</b> and video sharing sites have all become increasingly important to fashion public relations. The interactive nature of these platforms allows practitioners to engage and communicate with publics in real time, and tailor their clients’ brand or campaign messages to the target audience.

40|$|With a {{volatile}} economy and perceived indeterminate futures, Japanese companies {{are being forced}} by circumstances {{to change the way}} they recruit university graduates. One particular recruitment strategy currently being promoted at companies is to ask applicants to present a future strategy for the company. Unfortunately, Japanese universities are not preparing students to carefully analyse and strategise perceptions of the future leaving students poorly equipped to conceptualise alternative future possibilities and dangers. Given this background, one Multimedia Communication course at a techno- logy university in Japan adopted a Futures Studies & Thinking approach. The aim was to provide Complex Systems students (n= 79) with a theory driven Futures Toolbox to design and present digitally enabled futures images (DEFI) of their university. The 15 -week, 45 -hour core course was split into explicitly teaching a Futures Studies Toolbox which included the Futures Triangle Analysis (FTA), scenario building, SWOT analysis, backcasting and Lasswells’ Communication Formula, in conjunction with practical multimedia skills such as movie editing and enhanced Podcast development. The challenge was how to communicate new ideas, derived from strategically applying the Futures Toolbox, in a creative, innovative way. Student teams were provided with an iPod Touch. Two iPod Touch applications in particular were used to develop the presentations: Strip Designer and StoryKit. These linked to students’ previously created <b>photos</b> and <b>Podcasts</b> synchronized on each iPod Touch. The students added text and recorded voice-overs to support their futures images. The originality of this paper resides firstly in the synergies produced by combining Futures Studies as praxis with the creation of digitally enabled futures images (DEFI), and secondly in the critical and self-reflexive nature of the unit of analysis: the Future University itself, whose very name, and cultural contexts, have not been critically examined before by its students...|$|R
40|$|Users {{increasingly}} {{store data}} collections such as digital photographs on multiple personal devices, {{each of which}} typically presents the user with a storage management interface isolated from the contents of all other devices. The result is that collections easily become disorganized and drift out of sync. This thesis presents Eyo, a novel personal storage system that provides device transparency: a user can {{think in terms of}} "file X", rather than "file X on device Y", and will see the same set of files on all personal devices. Eyo allows a user to view and manage the entire collection of objects from any of their devices, even from disconnected devices and devices with too little storage to hold all the object content. Eyo separates metadata (application-specific attributes of objects) from the content of objects, allowing even storage-limited devices to store all metadata and thus provide device transparency. Fully replicated metadata allows any set of Eyo devices to efficiently synchronize updates. Applications can specify flexible placement rules to guide Eyo's partial replication of object contents across devices. Eyo's application interface provides first-class access to object version history. If multiple disconnected devices update an object concurrently, Eyo preserves each resulting divergent version of that object. Applications can then examine the history and either coalesce the conflicting versions without user direction, or incorporate these versions naturally into their existing user interfaces. Experiments using Eyo for storage in several example applications-media players, a <b>photo</b> editor, <b>podcast</b> manager, and an email interface-show that device transparency can be had with minor application changes, and within the storage and bandwidth capabilities of typical portable devices. by Jacob Alo Strauss.

As a result, collections become disorganized and drift out of sync. This paper presents Eyo, a novel personal storage system that provides device transparency: a user can think in terms of “file X”, rather than “file X on device Y ”, and will see the same set of files on all personal devices. Eyo allows a user to view and manage the entire collection of objects from any of their devices, even from disconnected devices and devices with too little storage to hold all the object content.
