Due to its simple struc-ture, a wide-area power floor of 3. 52 m 2 (1. 6 m × 2. 2 m) could be fabricated as a prototype. Three pickups with evenly displaced angle and space are adopted, considering the limited bottom area of the free-moving mobile robot.

This magnet, {{referred to as}} a B 0 magnet, {{is one of the key}} elements of a time-focusing device for ultra-cold neutrons (UCNs) based on a radio frequency gradient flipper – a so-called rebuncher. The magnet generates a guide and a potential field that interacts with the magnetic moment of UCNs and its main body comprises a C-shaped yoke made from iron. A field gradient is generated by a <b>pole</b> <b>arrangement</b> that includes an anisotropic inter-pole, which causes the fringe field to be uniform in the longitudinal direction even when the pole gap distance changes. The designed magnet has the following properties: (1) a maximum B-field of 10 kGauss, decreasing to 2 kGauss at a longitudinal distance of 25 cm, with a gradient of less than 400 Gauss/cm, (2) variations in the fringe field along the y direction is less than 4 % over a range of− 3 cm≤ y ≤ 3 cm at any z position in the spin-flipping region.

40|$|This {{doctoral}} thesis presents {{a study on}} the development of a liquid-cooled frame salient pole permanent-magnet-exited traction machine for a four-wheel-driven electric car. The emphasis of the thesis is put on a radial flux machine design in order to achieve a light-weight machine structure for traction applications. The design features combine electromagnetic and thermal design methods, because traction machine operation does not have a strict operating point. Arbitrary load cycles and the flexible supply require special attention in the design process. It is shown that accurate modelling of the machine magnetic state is essential for high-performance operation. The saturation effect related to the cross-saturation has to be taken carefully into account in order to achieve the desired operation. Two prototype machines have been designed and built for testing: one totally enclosed machine with a special magnet module <b>pole</b> <b>arrangement</b> and another through-ventilated machine with a more traditional embedded magnet structure. Both structures are built with magnetically salient structures in order to increase the torque production capability with the reluctance torque component.

40|$|Fractional pitch slot / <b>pole</b> <b>arrangements</b> are {{commonly}} used in permanent magnet synchronous motors (PMSMs) to significantly reduce cogging torque, however, maximum benefit depends on accurate stator and rotor manufacturing and alignment. This thesis presents a method of identifying the sources of manufacturing induced cogging torque. Decoupling of cogging caused by stator and rotor manufacturing variation is possible due to stator and rotor affected harmonics being independent of one another. A hybrid FEA / analytical method was developed to simulate cogging torque with multiple manufacturing faults induced which proved to be 6 orders of magnitude faster than FEA alone. The new method utilises a library of FEA derived pole transition over single stator slot waveforms which are then assembled in the correct order and phased corresponding to the slot / pole interactions for a given PMSM. Angular and eccentric misalignment can be identified by investigating the presence of first and second order sidebands about the pole and slot harmonics. Static angular misalignment induces first order sidebands around the slot harmonics while dynamic angular misalignment induces sidebands about the pole harmonics. Static eccentricity induces both first and second order sidebands around the slot harmonics, while dynamic eccentricity has {{the same effect on}} the pole harmonics. A ‘Fault Diagnosis Flow Chart’ is presented to identify the manufacturing sources of additional harmonics. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, all combinations of 10 production stators and 10 rotors of 24 slots and 10 poles in an axial flux configuration were experimentally measured and analysed. The stator slot variation and pole misplacement were found to be the largest contributors to unexpected cogging torque. Pole strength variation and static angular misalignment had minor contributions while dynamic angular, static eccentricity and dynamic eccentricity were found to not {{have a significant impact on}} the motors tested...|$|R

Sister chromatids are glued together by cohesin such that their kinetochores face opposing <b>poles.</b> This <b>arrangement</b> might thus prevent both chromatids from attaching to spindle microtubules from the same pole. But Tanaka’s group shows that even when geometry fails, a tension-sensitive mechanism fixes any mistakes. The authors messed with the usual geometry in two ways. First, they confronted yeast cells with a nonreplicating dicentric minichromosome. Its two kinetochores are not held in any fixed relative orien-tation, yet were efficiently attached to opposing poles. Second, normal chromosomes in cohesin mutants (which have attachment defects), were roughly linked by inhibiting topoisomerase II. This restored bipolar attachments. Thus, any connection that can produce tension is enough to ensure biorientation. The tension-sensitive correction depends on the Ipl 1 kinase, whose mammalian homo-logue, Aurora B, prevents monopolar attachments. This suggests that Ipl 1 activity knocks off attachments until tension somehow stops it—perhaps by turning off the kinase, turning on a counteracting phosphatase, or pulling substrates away from the kinase...|$|R

Most spiralians undergo equal spiral cleavage, although some undergo unequal cleavage (see below). [...] This group includes annelids, molluscs, and sipuncula. Spiral cleavage can vary between species, but generally the first two cell divisions result in four macromeres, also called blastomeres, (A, B, C, D) each representing one quadrant of the embryo. These first two cleavages are oriented in planes that occur at right angles parallel to the animal-vegetal axis of the zygote. At the 4-cell stage, the A and C macromeres meet at the animal pole, creating the animal cross-furrow, while the B and D macromeres meet at the vegetal pole, creating the vegetal cross-furrow. With each successive cleavage cycle, the macromeres give rise to quartets of smaller micromeres at the animal pole. The divisions that produce these quartets occur at an oblique angle, an angle that is not a multiple of 90°, to the animal-vegetal axis. Each quartet of micromeres is rotated relative to their parent macromere, and the chirality of this rotation differs between odd and even numbered quartets, meaning that there is alternating symmetry between the odd and even quartets. In other words, the orientation of divisions that produces each quartet alternates between being clockwise and counterclockwise with respect to the animal pole. The alternating cleavage pattern that occurs as the quartets are generated produces quartets of micromeres that reside in the cleavage furrows of the four macromeres. When viewed from the animal <b>pole,</b> this <b>arrangement</b> of cells displays a spiral pattern.|$|R

This polytope is called the partition polytope of $a$. If $a$ is integral, this polytope contains a finite set of lattice points corresponding to nonnegative integral linear combinations. The partition polytope associated to an integral $a$ is a rational convex polytope, and any rational convex polytope can be realized canonically as a partition polytope. We consider the problem of {{counting the number of}} lattice points in partition polytopes, or, more generally, computing sums of values of exponential-polynomial functions on the lattice points in such polytopes. We give explicit formulae for these quantities using a notion of multi-dimensional residue due to Jeffrey-Kirwan.

Terao {{has shown}} that the {{structure}} of the module of (rational) differential forms with at most logarithmic <b>poles</b> at an <b>arrangement</b> of hyperplanes (as defined by K.

In this paper we demonstrate how the existence of rational logarithmic forms with poles of high order depends on the existence of highly degenerate (“special position”) subarrangements. The associated combinatorial structures are studied. First a strong version of K. Saito's “Preparation Lemma” for logarithmic forms leads to a new, simple proof of Terao's celebrated “Addition-Deletion Theorem” for hyperplane arrangements with free module of logarithmic 1 -forms (“free arrangements”). Then structural characterizations are developed in two extreme cases for the generation of the module of logarithmic differential 1 -forms: this module has a triangular basis iff the arrangement is supersolvable (strictly linearly fibered), and it is generated by forms of degree — 1 iff the arrangement is generic in codimension 3. Both conditions on the geometry of the arrangement are combinatorial in a very strong sense (determined by restricted data on the lattice of intersections of the hyperplanes.) However, examples show that the cardinality and degree sequence of a minimal set of generators for the module of lógarithmic 1 -forms are not in general determined by this intersection lattice...|$|R

40|$|Reliable {{techniques}} {{for the living}} cell culture and correlative light and electron microscopy (EM) of meiotic pollen mother cells (PMCs) of Iris spuria, Allium triquetrum and Tradescantia flumenensis are described in detail. Living PMCs were successfully cultured in a slide chamber on agar/sucrose medium. Cells were covered with an inert oil to prevent their dehydration, and some cells were cultured from metaphase I to tetrad cell formation over a 20 hour period. Other PMCs were fixed with glutaraldehyde and flat embedded using a modification of the agar sandwich technique of Mole-Bajer and Bajer (1968). This technique was developed to permit the preselection of PMCs at known meiotic stages, for subsequent EM examination. Serial thin sections were cut at known planes of section; and 3 -D reconstructions of MT distribution, and MT counts from transverse sections were completed. It was also possible to examine sections of an Iris anaphase I PMC which had been previously studied in life. Anaphase I and II chromosome velocities were analysed in the three species. Mean velocities were approximately 0. 5 mu m/min with some variation from cell to cell and between sister half-spindles. In Allium anaphase I there was also variation in chromosome velocity within the half-spindle; and this variation was found not {{to be related to}} chromosome position on the metaphase I plate. Spindle elongation was zero in Allium anaphase I and in Iris anaphase II, but was detectable in Allium anaphase II (40 %) and in "Iris anaphase I (l 5 %). The extent of spindle elongation in Tradescantia could not be determined. The kinetochore region in the first meiotic division consisted of two closely appressed, but structurally (and functionally) distinct, sister kinetochores. At meiosis II, the two sister kinetochores were separate from each other and faced opposite <b>poles.</b> The kinetochore <b>arrangement</b> probably changes from side-by-side (meiosis I) to back-to-back (meiosis II) during chromosome recondensation at prophase II in these cells. Bundles of non-kinetochore microtubules (nkMTs) span the interzone between sister chromosome units at metaphase I and II and anaphase II. Bundles of kinetochore MTs (kMTs) do not increase in divergence at any stage of meiosis studied; there was little interaction between nkMTs and kMTs, and MT-MT cross bridges were rare. These observations are not consistent with models of chromosome movement based on MT sliding or zipping. No relationship was found between nkMT distribution and spindle elongation, and the several different nkMT distributions which have been reported for other cell types may be variations on a structural theme. Spindle endoplasmic reticulum (ER) in meiosis II was found to be derived largely from invaginations and evaginations of the nuclear envelope. Growth of existing spindle ER was proposed to account for the doubling in the amount of ER observed between interphase and prometaphase II. Randomly oriented elements of ER, in early prometaphase II spindles may become passively aligned along the interpolar axis and then actively transported polewards at later stages of prometaphase II and metaphase II.
