5000|$|Bubble lights {{have been}} made in two {{different}} lamp base sizes — E10 (C6) 15 volt, and E12 (C7). The original design used a miniature screw base (E10), such as those used on C6 cone-shaped Christmas lamps. For 120 V power, these early designs were nominally designed to operate with eight on one string, in series, at 15 volts each. However, they were often packaged with a nine-socket string to extend the life of the bulbs. Bubble lights could also be purchased individually for use in existing light strings.

5000|$|All of the {{teachers}} who service the ELLs have ESL credentials. Teachers of the self-contained ESL classes in Grades K-2 have NYS ESL certificates. The <b>push-in</b> ESL teacher is a licensed Spanish Bilingual teacher with ancillary ESL certification. A Special Education teacher’s ESL certification is pending. This allows her to service the ELLs in her self-contained classroom.The self-contained classrooms have many Beginner/Intermediate ELLs and some Advanced ELLs, {{most of whom are}} in second grade.

50|$|Two {{other models}} of {{instruction}} include the <b>push-in</b> {{program and the}} pull-out program. The <b>push-in</b> program includes the English teacher coming into the classroom to help the English language learner. Many classroom teachers welcome the English teacher into their classrooms and view this as a positive experience for all children. However, other teachers have not viewed it as a positive choice of instruction because the two teachers may not {{see eye to eye}} within the teaching and learning in the classroom. The English teacher also is not able to focus on the basic language skills which is important for English language learners. The pull-out program consists of the English teacher pulling the ELL out of the classroom to learn English language skills. The pull out program means that the child will miss out on what happens within their classroom and this can provide a disadvantage for that student because they are missing out from having the community feeling and being left out of some activities as a class. Also, the teacher might be frustrated that the child is being pulled out at important times such as at a test or literacy activity. However, the pull out program can help the student to gain more individualized time in smaller groups. English language learners can also have one on one time to learn more basic English language skills with no interruptions from the teacher or students within the class. The English teacher also does not need to co plan with the classroom teacher on what activities the class will be learning. The teacher will have their own time to plan their lessons accordingly.|$|E

50|$|The <b>push-in</b> ESL {{program is}} {{designed}} to foster social and academic language acquisition while it supports the academic program. In grades 3 through 5 most of the ELLs are clustered in one class on each grade. The program in each grade is driven by the curriculum and the needs of the ELLs. Reading and Writing workshops are scheduled for 90-minute blocks. The ESL teacher pushes into each of these classes for at least one period during the literacy blocks. Collaborative planning aligns the ESL teacher’s goals with the classroom programs. The ESL teacher is incorporated into the Reading workshop in grades 3 and 4 for one period each day: giving mini-lessons, leading Guided Reading groups, providing small group lessons and conferring with ELLs. Ongoing assessment drives the selection of strategy-based teaching points. Reading and language acquisition levels determine Guided reading group placement. Each group is scheduled for regular lessons. In fifth grade, where the bulk of the ELLs are long term ELLs, the emphasis is on academic language acquisition and the development of written language skills. Content area writing and projects are incorporated into the writing block to further develop spoken and written academic language. Revision and editing are scaffolded to develop standard grammar and syntax in written work.|$|E
5000|$|For {{the first}} time, shutter {{information}} was displayed via an internal {{liquid crystal display}} (LCD) inside the viewfinder. Aperture information was relayed through Nikon's [...] "ADR" [...] (Aperture Direct Readout) which was a window at the top center of the viewfinder that got its information from a micro-prism that read small numbers {{at the top of}} the mounted lens, of which type 'AI' (Aperture Indexing) or 'AIS' (Aperture Indexing Shutter Priority) lenses had printed behind the normal aperture numbers. Though widely used today, LCDs were very hi-tech at the time. They proved somewhat difficult to see at night, so Nikon installed a button-operated light for use at night. The LCD is one of the few problem areas of the F3 design, since with age, LCDs lose contrast, blur, and become inoperative after a number of years. Fortunately, unlike modern autofocus cameras with LCD 'Command Center' panels, malfunction of the F3's LCD viewfinder display does not prevent full operation of the camera, since this is accomplished with manual dials and indicators. Many F3 cameras built in the 1980s were never used professionally, and therefore are still in perfect working order, including the LCD. On early production models the autoexposure lock button, originally a simple <b>push-in</b> part, is often missing; Nikon later redesigned this part so it was securely attached from inside the body. The later part can be fitted to early bodies but a partial stripdown is required.|$|E
40|$|This tudy {{examined}} the 3 -D kinematics {{of the field}} hockey penalty corner <b>push-in,</b> in order to to formulate coaching recommendations for optimal <b>push-in</b> performance. Male hockey players (N= 17) who were experienced (n= 8) or novice (n= 9) <b>push-in</b> performers participated in the study. It was expected that 1) experienced <b>push-in</b> performers would demonstrate greater accuracy and resultant ball velocity than novice performers, 2) kinematic parameters would differ between the two groups, and 3) stance width would correlate to resultant ball velocity. Two 50 Hz video cameras recorded transverse and longitudinal views of accurate <b>push-in</b> trials. Kinematic analysis provided data for <b>push-in</b> accuracy, resultant ball velocity, stance width, drag distance, drag time, average drag velocity, center of gravity displacement, and segment and stick angular displacements and velocities.

40|$|The aims of {{the study}} were to {{determine}} those variables that significantly affect <b>push-in</b> execution and thereby formulate coaching recommendations specific to the <b>push-in.</b> Two 50 Hz video cameras recorded transverse and longitudinal views of <b>push-in</b> trials performed by eight experienced and nine inexperienced male <b>push-in</b> performers. Video footage was digitized for data analysis of ball speed, stance width, drag distance, drag time, drag speed, centre of massy displacement and segment and stick displacements and velocities. Experienced <b>push-in</b> performers demonstrated a significantly greater (p < 0. 05) stance width, a significantly greater distance between the ball and the front foot {{at the start of the}} <b>push-in</b> and a significantly faster ball speed than inexperienced performers. In addition, the experienced performers showed a significant positive correlation between ball speed and playing experience and tended to adopt a combination of simultaneous and sequential segment rotation to achieve accuracy and fast ball speed.

40|$|Several methods, such as pull-out, {{microbond}} and push-in/push-out tests, {{have been}} developed to test interfacial adhesion in composite materials. Some of them can only be applied to single-fibre matrix composites, like the microbond test, and others are difficult to perform on brittle fibres due to premature fracture of the fibre. <b>Push-in</b> tests, consisting of pushing the fibre with a micro- or nanoindenter on a bulk specimen, constitute a powerful technique that can be applied directly to composite laminates. However, the interfacial adhesion values obtained from different tests (microbond, <b>push-in)</b> often differ and even the results from one type of test are subjected to a large scatter. This might be {{due to the fact that}} the existing analytical solutions that are typically used to interpret the experimental data take into account the constraining effect of the surrounding fibres on a simplified manner. To study interfacial adhesion and the effect of the constraint of the neighbouring fibres, a micromechanical model of the <b>push-in</b> test was developed, coupled with experimental adhesion testing in a glass fibre-reinforced epoxy matrix composite.

40|$|Under {{uniaxial}} compression (tension), auxetic materials would shrink (expand) laterally. It {{has been speculated}} that the auxetic property {{could be used to}} design superior nails for easier <b>push-in</b> and harder pull-out. In this study, the first auxetic nails are designed, fabricated and experimentally investigated. Pine timber and medium-density fibreboard are selected as testing materials. The <b>push-in</b> and pull-out performance of auxetic and non-auxetic nails is compared by using two key parameters of the maximum compressive force and the maximum tensile force. It is found that the auxetic nails do not always exhibit superior mechanical performance to non-auxetic ones. Also, the small auxetic deformation of one typical designed auxetic nail is revealed by the experimentally validated finite element model. The experimental and numerical results illustrate the limitations of exploiting the auxetic property in the nail application. Some suggestions are provided for more effective designs of future auxetic nails...|$|E
40|$|Dental {{implants}} {{are widely}} used and are a predictable treatment in various edentulous cases. Occlusal overload may be causally related to implant bone loss {{and a loss of}} integration.

Cell proliferation and ALP activity in the cells grown on prepared surfaces were similar for the Ti-Nb-Sn alloy and for cpTi in all the experiments. A comparison between the Ti-Nb-Sn alloy implant and the cpTi implant revealed that no significant difference was apparent for the <b>push-in</b> test values.

40|$|SiC fiber-reinforced ceramic matrix {{composites}} {{are being}} developed for high-temperature advanced jet engine applications. Obtaining a strong, tough composite material depends critically on optimizing the mechanical coupling between the reinforcing fibers and the surrounding matrix material. This has usually been accomplished by applying a thin C or BN coating {{onto the surface of}} the reinforcing fibers. The performance of these fiber coatings, however, may degrade under cyclic loading conditions or exposure to different environments. Degradation of the coating-controlled interfacial behavior will strongly affect the useful service lifetime of the composite material. Cyclic fiber <b>push-in</b> testing was applied to monitor the evolution of fiber sliding behavior in both C- and BN-coated small-diameter (15 -mm) SiC-fiber-reinforced ceramic matrix composites. The cyclic fiber <b>push-in</b> tests were performed using a desktop fiber push-out apparatus. At the beginning of each test, the fiber to be tested was aligned underneath a 10 - mm-diameter diamond punch; then, the applied load was cycled between selected maximum and minimum loads. From the measured response, the fiber sliding distance and frictional sliding stresses were determined for each cycle. Tests were performed in both room air and nitrogen. Cyclic fiber <b>push-in</b> tests of C-coated, SiC-fiber-reinforced SiC showed progressive increases in fiber sliding distances along with decreases in frictional sliding stresses for continued cycling in room air. This rapid degradation in interfacial response was not observed for cycling in nitrogen, indicating that moisture exposure had a large effect in immediately lowering the frictional sliding stresses of C-coated fibers. These results indicate that matrix cracks bridged by C-coated fibers will not be stable, but will rapidly grow in moisture-containing environments. In contrast, cyclic fiber <b>push-in</b> tests of both BN-coated, SiC-fiber-reinforced SiC and BNcoated, SiC-fiber-reinforced barium strontium aluminosilicate showed no significant changes in fiber sliding behavior with continued short-term cycling in either room air or nitrogen. Although the composites with BN-coated fibers showed stable short-term cycling behavior in both environments, long-term (several-week) exposure of debonded fibers to room air resulted in dramatically increased fiber sliding distances and decreased frictional sliding stresses. These results indicate that although matrix cracks bridged by BNcoated fibers will show short-term stability, such cracks will show substantial growth with long-term exposure to moisture-containing environments. Newly formulated BN coatings, with higher moisture resistance, will be tested in the near future...|$|E
40|$|The role {{of various}} {{parameters}} governing bond behavior is investigated {{in this paper}} {{taking advantage of a}} simple but efficient finite-element model, whose fundamental aspects are briefly recalled. Several well-documented test results on bond are examined in order to clarify the relevance of some aspects of bond phenomenological behavior, and to study a few bond situations where testing has been scarce in the past, {{as in the case of}} <b>push-in</b> tests. Parametric studies are performed as well, with reference to the loading mode (pull-out and <b>push-in),</b> to bar elastic and strain-hardening moduli, to steel yield strength and to bar lateral contraction/expansion, both in the elastic and in the plastic domain. Beside contributing to a better understanding of the role of the above-mentioned parameters, the paper confirms at the same time the uniqueness of the local bond stress-slip law, and the necessity of introducing a corrective factor, in order to take care of the damage to bond caused by the cone-shaped microcracks radiating from the bar close to the transverse cracks in tension ties and to the flexural cracks in R/C beams subjected to bending...|$|E

40|$|We {{performed}} thin carbonate-containing apatite (CA) coating on titanium (Ti) by an aqueous {{spray coating}} (ASC) method {{that consisted of}} a Ca-CO 3 -PO 4 complex. Two different CA coatings were produced by two different spray amounts and were heat-treated after spraying. We evaluated three-dimensional structures, adhesiveness to Ti, and durability of the CA film. In addition, we performed immersion experiments in simulated body fluid (SBF), and bone responses were evaluated after implantation into a femoral bone defect in rats. The bonding ability of ASC-coated implant into the bone was examined by <b>push-in</b> tests. Unique network structures with small particles were identified on CA coatings.

Crystal formation progressed on CA-coated specimens, and the sample placement direction influenced crystal formation and growth in SBF immersion. Animal implantation experiments revealed significantly greater bone-to-implant contact ratio and bone mass in both cortical and bone marrow, respectively, four weeks after implantation. <b>Push-in</b> tests suggested that the bonding of the CA coating to Ti is clinically acceptable.
