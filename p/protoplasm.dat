5|$|Prior to this, {{other terms}} {{were used for}} the cell fluid, not always synonymously, as its nature was not very clear (see <b>protoplasm).</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{cell nucleus}} was {{discovered}} by Robert Brown in 1831. Demonstration of the cellular composition of all organisms, with each cell possessing all the characteristics of life, is attributed to the combined efforts of botanist Matthias Schleiden and zoologist Theodor Schwann (1810–1882) in the early 19th century although Moldenhawer had already shown that plants were wholly cellular with each cell having its own wall and Julius von Sachs had shown the continuity <b>protoplasm</b> between cell walls.|$|E
5|$|The protoplasmodium, a microscopic, {{undifferentiated}} granular {{mass with}} a slime sheath, is transparent and colourless. A single sporangiophore (the fruiting structure) is produced from the semispherical protoplasmodium, which is approximately {{one and a}} half times the diameter of mature sporangia. It acquires dark spots as it matures and the centre of the <b>protoplasm</b> later becomes dark. Then, the transparent and milk-white protoplasmodium climbs along the stem to the top, where first the capillitium and peridium and finally the spores are produced. At room temperature, this process lasts roughly one day.|$|E
5|$|Once a neuron is in place, {{it extends}} {{dendrites}} and an axon {{into the area}} around it. Axons, because they commonly extend a great distance from the cell body and need to reach specific targets, grow in a particularly complex way. The tip of a growing axon consists of a blob of <b>protoplasm</b> called a growth cone, studded with chemical receptors. These receptors sense the local environment, causing the growth cone to be attracted or repelled by various cellular elements, and thus to be pulled in a particular direction at each point along its path. The result of this pathfinding process is that the growth cone navigates through the brain until it reaches its destination area, where other chemical cues cause it to begin generating synapses. Considering the entire brain, thousands of genes create products that influence axonal pathfinding.|$|E
5|$|From 1870 to 1880 {{it became}} clear that cell nuclei are never formed anew but always derived from the {{substance}} of another nucleus. In 1882 Flemming observed the longitudinal splitting of chromosomes in the dividing nucleus and concluded that each daughter nucleus received half of each of the chromosomes of the mother nucleus: then by the early 20th century {{it was found that the}} number of chromosomes in a given species is constant. With genetic continuity confirmed and the finding by Eduard Strasburger that the nuclei of reproductive cells (in pollen and embryo) have a reducing division (halving of chromosomes, now known as meiosis) the field of heredity was opened up. By 1926 Thomas Morgan was able to outline a theory of the gene and its structure and function. The form and function of plastids received similar attention, the association with starch being noted at an early date. With observation of the cellular structure of all organisms and the process of cell division and continuity of genetic material, the analysis of the structure of <b>protoplasm</b> and the cell wall as well as that of plastids and vacuoles – what is now known as cytology, or cell theory became firmly established.|$|E
25|$|Some {{criticisms of}} the {{membrane}} theory developed in the 1930s, based on observations {{such as the ability}} of some cells to swell and increase their surface area by a factor of 1000. A lipid layer cannot stretch to that extent without becoming a patchwork (thereby losing its barrier properties). Such criticisms stimulated continued studies on <b>protoplasm</b> as the principal agent determining cell permeability properties. In 1938, Fischer and Suer proposed that water in the <b>protoplasm</b> is not free but in a chemically combined form, and that the <b>protoplasm</b> represents a combination of protein, salt and water. They demonstrated the basic similarity between swelling in living tissues and the swelling of gelatin and fibrin gels. Dimitri Nasonov (1944) viewed proteins as the central components responsible for many properties of the cell, including electrical properties.|$|E
25|$|Since the {{invention}} of the microscope in the seventeenth century it has been known that plant and animal tissue is composed of cells : the cell was discovered by Robert Hooke. The plant cell wall was easily visible even with these early microscopes but no similar barrier was visible on animal cells, though it stood to reason that one must exist. By the mid 19th century, this question was being actively investigated and Moritz Traube noted that this outer layer must be semipermeable to allow transport of ions. Traube had no direct evidence for the composition of this film, though, and incorrectly asserted that it was formed by an interfacial reaction of the cell <b>protoplasm</b> with the extracellular fluid.|$|E
25|$|The word robot was {{introduced}} to the public by the Czech interwar writer Karel Čapek in his play R.U.R. (Rossum's Universal Robots), published in 1920. The play begins in a factory that uses a chemical substitute for <b>protoplasm</b> to manufacture living, simplified people called robots. The play does not focus in detail on the technology behind the creation of these living creatures, but in their appearance they prefigure modern ideas of androids, creatures who can be mistaken for humans. These mass-produced workers are depicted as efficient but emotionless, incapable of original thinking and indifferent to self-preservation. At issue is whether the robots are being exploited and the consequences of human dependence upon commodified labor (especially after a number of specially-formulated robots achieve self-awareness and incite robots all around the world to rise up against the humans).|$|E
25|$|OsO4 is {{a widely}} used {{staining}} agent used in transmission electron microscopy (TEM) to provide contrast to the image. As a lipid stain, it is also useful in scanning electron microscopy (SEM) {{as an alternative to}} sputter coating. It embeds a heavy metal directly into cell membranes, creating a high electron scattering rate without the need for coating the membrane with a layer of metal, which can obscure details of the cell membrane. In the staining of the plasma membrane, osmium(VIII) oxide binds phospholipid head regions, thus creating contrast with the neighbouring <b>protoplasm</b> (cytoplasm). Additionally, osmium(VIII) oxide is also used for fixing biological samples in conjunction with HgCl2. Its rapid killing abilities are used to quickly kill live specimens such as protozoa. OsO4 stabilizes many proteins by transforming them into gels without destroying structural features. Tissue proteins that are stabilized by OsO4 are not coagulated by alcohols during dehydration. Osmium(VIII) oxide is also used as a stain for lipids in optical microscopy. OsO4 also stains the human cornea (see safety considerations).|$|E
500|$|The hyphae of basidiomycetous fungi are {{partitioned}} by cross-walls called septa, {{and these}} septa have pores that permit {{the passage of}} cytoplasm or <b>protoplasm</b> between adjacent hyphal compartments. In an effort to determine ultrastructural characters useful for systematic and phylogenetic analyses of the Agaricomycotina, Gail Celio and colleagues used electron microscopy to examine both {{the structure of the}} septal pore, and nuclear division in A.vulgare. They determined that septa found in hyphae of the hymenium have bell-shaped pore [...] "caps" [...] with multiple perforations. Each cap extends {{along the length of the}} septum, along with a zone surrounding the pore that is free of organelles. Due to the scarcity of similar data from other Agaricomycotina species, it is unknown whether the extended septal pore cap margins of A.vulgare are phylogenetically informative. [...] Regarding nuclear division, the process of metaphase I of meiosis is similar to the metaphase of mitosis. Spherical spindle pole bodies containing electron-opaque inclusions are set within gaps on opposite ends of the nuclear membrane. This membrane has occasional gaps but is largely continuous. Fragments of endoplasmic reticulum occur near the spindle pole bodies, but do not form a cap.|$|E
2500|$|The {{technique}} of printing his more popular lectures in periodicals which {{were sold to}} the general public was extremely effective. A good example was The physical basis of life, a lecture given in Edinburgh on 8 November 1868. Its theme— that vital action is nothing more than [...] "the result of the molecular forces of the <b>protoplasm</b> which displays it"— shocked the audience, though that was nothing compared to the uproar when it was published in the Fortnightly Review for February 1869. John Morley, the editor, said [...] "No article that had appeared in any periodical for a generation had caused such a sensation". The issue was reprinted seven times and <b>protoplasm</b> became a household word; Punch added 'Professor Protoplasm' to his other soubriquets.|$|E
2500|$|Low-salinity salt ponds {{mirror the}} {{ecosystem}} of the bay, with fish and fish-eating birds in abundance. [...] Mid-salinity ponds support dense populations of brine shrimp, which provide a rich food source {{for millions of}} shorebirds. Only salt-tolerant micro-algae survive in the high salinity ponds, and impart a deep red color to these ponds from the pigment within the algae <b>protoplasm.</b>|$|E
2500|$|A {{growth cone}} {{is a big}} actin-supported {{extension}} of a developing or regenerating neurite seeking its synaptic target. Their existence was originally proposed by Spanish histologist Santiago Ramón y Cajal based upon stationary images he observed under the microscope. He first described the growth cone based on fixed cells as [...] "a concentration of <b>protoplasm</b> of conical form, endowed with amoeboid movements" [...] (Cajal, 1890). Neuronal growth cones are situated on the very tips of nerve cells on structures called axons and dendrites. The sensory, motor, integrative, and adaptive functions of growing axons and dendrites are all contained within this specialized structure.|$|E
2500|$|The modern {{mainstream}} consensus {{model of}} cellular membranes {{is based on}} the fluid-mosaic model that envisions a lipid bilayer separating the inside from the outside of cells with associated ion channels, pumps and transporters giving rise to the permeability processes of cells. [...] Alternative hypotheses were developed in the past that have largely been rejected. [...] One of these opposing concepts developed early within the context of studies on osmosis, permeability, and electrical properties of cells was that of Gilbert Ling. The modern idea holds that these properties all belonged to the plasma membrane whereas Ling's view was that the <b>protoplasm</b> was responsible for these properties.|$|E
2500|$|At the time, {{there was}} {{considerable}} scientific debate over {{the question of how}} an embryo developed. Following Wilhelm Roux's mosaic theory of development, some believed that hereditary material was divided among embryonic cells, which were predestined to form particular parts of a mature organism. Driesch and others thought that development was due to epigenetic factors, where interactions between the <b>protoplasm</b> and the nucleus of the egg and the environment could affect development. Morgan was in the latter camp; his work with Driesch demonstrated that blastomeres isolated from sea urchin and ctenophore eggs could develop into complete larvae, contrary to the predictions (and experimental evidence) of Roux's supporters. [...] A related debate involved the role of epigenetic and environmental factors in development; on this front Morgan showed that sea urchin eggs could be induced to divide without fertilization by adding magnesium chloride. Loeb continued this work and became well known for creating fatherless frogs using the method.|$|E
2500|$|Bacteriophages are {{the viruses}} that infect and {{replicate}} in bacteria. They {{were discovered in}} the early 20th century, by the English bacteriologist Frederick Twort (1877–1950). But before this time, in 1896, the bacteriologist Ernest Hanbury Hankin (1865–1939) reported that something {{in the waters of}} the River Ganges could kill Vibrio cholerae – the cause of cholera. Whatever it was in the water could be passed through filters that remove bacteria but was destroyed by boiling. Twort [...] discovered the action of bacteriophages on staphylococci bacteria. He noticed that when grown on nutrient agar some colonies of the bacteria became watery or [...] "glassy". He collected some of these watery colonies and passed them through a Chamberland filter to remove the bacteria and discovered that when the filtrate was added to fresh cultures of bacteria, they in turn became watery. He proposed that the agent might be [...] "an amoeba, an ultramicroscopic virus, a living <b>protoplasm,</b> or an enzyme with the power of growth".|$|E
2500|$|Precipitated by an {{unhealthy}} weight, dehydration, bad eating habits, {{and a recent}} relapse on the Grateful Dead's first stadium tour, Garcia collapsed into a diabetic coma in July 1986, waking up five days later. He later spoke about this period of unconsciousness as surreal: [...] "Well, I had some very weird experiences. My main experience was one of furious activity and tremendous struggle {{in a sort of}} futuristic, space-ship vehicle with insectoid presences. After I came out of my coma, I had this image of myself as these little hunks of <b>protoplasm</b> that were stuck together kind of like stamps with perforations between them that you could snap off." [...] Garcia's coma {{had a profound effect on}} him: it forced him to have to relearn how to play the guitar, as well as other, more basic skills. Within a handful of months, he had recovered, playing with the Jerry Garcia Band and the Grateful Dead again later that year.|$|E
2500|$|The {{scientific}} study {{of the nervous system}} has increased significantly {{during the second half of}} the twentieth century, principally due to advances in molecular biology, electrophysiology, and computational neuroscience. This has allowed neuroscientists to study the nervous system in all its aspects: [...] how it is structured, how it works, how it develops, how it malfunctions, and how it can be changed. For example, it has become possible to understand, in much detail, the complex processes occurring within a single neuron. Neurons are cells specialized for communication. They are able to communicate with neurons and other cell types through specialized junctions called synapses, at which electrical or electrochemical signals can be transmitted from one cell to another. Many neurons extrude long thin filaments of <b>protoplasm</b> called axons, which may extend to distant parts of the body and are capable of rapidly carrying electrical signals, influencing the activity of other neurons, muscles, or glands at their termination points. A nervous system emerges from the assemblage of neurons that are connected to each other.|$|E
60|$|What {{has been}} said of the animal world is no less true of plants. Embedded in the <b>protoplasm</b> at the broad, or attached, end of the nettle hair, there lies a {{spheroidal}} nucleus. Careful examination further proves that the whole substance of the nettle {{is made up of}} a repetition of such masses of nucleated <b>protoplasm,</b> each contained in a wooden case, which is modified in form, sometimes into a woody fibre, sometimes into a duct or spiral vessel, sometimes into a pollen grain, or an ovule. Traced back to its earliest state, the nettle arises as the man does, in a particle of nucleated <b>protoplasm.</b> And in the lowest plants, as in the lowest animals, a single mass of such <b>protoplasm</b> may constitute the whole plant, or the <b>protoplasm</b> may exist without a nucleus.|$|E
60|$|All living bodies contain {{substances}} of closely similar {{physical and}} chemical composition, which constitute the physical basis of life, known as <b>protoplasm.</b> So far as our present knowledge goes, this takes its origin only from pre-existing <b>protoplasm.</b>|$|E
60|$|Perhaps {{it would}} not yet be {{safe to say that}} all forms of <b>protoplasm</b> are {{affected}} by the direct action of electric shocks; and yet the number of cases in which the contraction of <b>protoplasm</b> is shown to be affected by this agency increases every day.|$|E

60|$|Thus, {{the animal}} can only raise the complex {{substance}} of dead <b>protoplasm</b> {{to the higher}} power, as one may say, of living protoplasm; while the plant can raise the less complex substances--carbonic acid, water, and ammonia--to the same stage of living <b>protoplasm,</b> if not to the same level. But the plant also has its limitations. Some of the fungi, for example, appear to need higher compounds to start with; and no known plant can live upon the uncompounded elements of <b>protoplasm.</b> A plant supplied with pure carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, and nitrogen, phosphorus, sulphur, and the like, would as infallibly die as the animal in his bath of smelling-salts, though it would be surrounded by all the constituents of <b>protoplasm.</b> Nor, indeed, need the process of simplification of vegetable food be carried so far as this, in order {{to arrive at the}} limit of the plant's thaumaturgy. Let water, carbonic acid, and all the other needful constituents be supplied with ammonia, and an ordinary plant will still be unable to manufacture <b>protoplasm.</b>|$|E

60|$|But {{it will be}} observed, {{that the}} {{existence}} of the matter of life depends on the pre-existence of certain compounds; namely, carbonic acid, water, and ammonia. Withdraw any one of these three from the world and all vital phænomena come to an end. They are related to the <b>protoplasm</b> of the plant, as the <b>protoplasm</b> of the plant is to that of the animal. Carbon, hydrogen, oxygen and nitrogen are all lifeless bodies. Of these, carbon and oxygen unite, in certain proportions and under certain conditions, to give rise to carbonic acid; hydrogen and oxygen produce water; nitrogen and hydrogen give rise to ammonia. These new compounds like the elementary bodies of which they are composed, are lifeless. But when they are brought together, under certain conditions they give rise to the still more complex body, <b>protoplasm,</b> and this <b>protoplasm</b> exhibits the phenomena of life.|$|E
60|$|But {{it will be}} observed, {{that the}} {{existence}} of the matter of life depends on the pre-existence of certain compounds; namely, carbonic acid, water, and certain nitrogenous bodies. Withdraw any one of these three from the world, and all vital phaenomena come to an end. They are as necessary to the <b>protoplasm</b> of the plant, as the <b>protoplasm</b> of the plant is to that of the animal. Carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, and nitrogen are all lifeless bodies. Of these, carbon and oxygen unite in certain proportions and under certain conditions, to give rise to carbonic acid; hydrogen and oxygen produce water; nitrogen and other elements give rise to nitrogenous salts. These new compounds, like the elementary bodies of which they are composed, are lifeless. But when they are brought together, under certain conditions, they give rise to the still more complex body, <b>protoplasm,</b> and this <b>protoplasm</b> exhibits the phaenomena of life.|$|E
60|$|If {{scientific}} language is {{to possess a}} definite and constant signification whenever it is employed, {{it seems to me}} that we are logically bound to apply to the <b>protoplasm,</b> or physical basis of life, the same conceptions as those which are held to be legitimate elsewhere. If the phaenomena exhibited by water are its properties, so are those presented by <b>protoplasm,</b> living or dead, its properties.|$|E
60|$|But these changes, {{whatever}} {{be their}} extent, have not rendered it incompetent to resume its old functions as matter of life. A singular inward laboratory, which I possess, will dissolve a certain {{portion of the}} modified protoplasm; the solution so formed will pass into my veins; and the subtle influences to which it will then be subjected will convert the dead <b>protoplasm</b> into living <b>protoplasm,</b> and transubstantiate sheep into man.|$|E
60|$|Hence {{it appears}} to be a matter of no great moment what animal, or what plant, I lay under {{contribution}} for <b>protoplasm,</b> and the fact speaks volumes for the general identity of that substance in all living beings. I share this catholicity of assimilation with other animals, all of which, so far as we know, could thrive equally well on the <b>protoplasm</b> of any of their fellows, or of any plant; but here the assimilative powers of the animal world cease. A solution of smelling-salts in water, with an infinitesimal proportion of some other saline matters, contains all the elementary bodies which enter into the composition of protoplasm; but, as I need hardly say, a hogshead of that fluid would not keep a hungry man from starving, nor would it save any animal whatever from a like fate. An animal cannot make <b>protoplasm,</b> but must take it ready-made from some other animal, or some plant--the animal's highest feat of constructive chemistry being to convert dead <b>protoplasm</b> into that living matter of life which is appropriate to itself.|$|E
