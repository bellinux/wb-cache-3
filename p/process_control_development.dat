40|$|The <b>process</b> <b>control</b> {{industry}} is bracing {{for the third}} generation control systems. Influenced by the latest development in this Internet era, many new paradigm shifts occur in <b>control</b> system <b>development.</b> In this paper, we describe the evolution of <b>process</b> <b>control</b> systems {{over the years and}} list challenges ahead. We share some of our thoughts drawn from both the experiences in participating in the development of these third generation control systems and the observation of this industry as a whole. We believe the everincreasing time-to-market pressure not only changes the world of conventional non-real-time system development, but also has profound impact on <b>process</b> <b>control</b> system <b>development.</b> The time pressure inevitably leads to software/hardware reuse, which may not yet be well object/component-oriented. We shall talk about the challenges of component reuse in this paper. While real-time system development is considered mostly different from non-real-time system development, we believe they are not as dissimilar as we thought.

40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} is to setup a {{simulation}} environment that prepares the ground for Multiple Hearth Furnace (MHF) advanced <b>process</b> <b>control</b> <b>development</b> based on Economic Model Predictive Control (EMPC) and/or MPC techniques. Additionally, the interest is to design an Economic MPC for the Multiple Hearth Furnace, aiming to minimize energy consumption of the furnace while maintaining the specified product quality. The implementation of the EMPC requires a dynamic model which is simplified from a previously developed mechanistic model of the MHF. The simplified model is developed {{in the form of}} a nonlinear Hammerstein-Wiener model, which is linearized at every sampling time to carry out the state estimation and MPC optimization tasks. As the accuracy of the simplified process model is crucial for performance of the EMPC, the thesis aims to compare the simulation results of the mechanistic model and the simplified one. The comparison of the models show that the simplified model follows accurately the mechanistic model in all cases. A description of the process of interest is given, with an emphasis in outlining the overall control strategy currently implemented. Next the components of the EMPC design are illustrated, including the overall strategy, the cost function and the necessary models of the process. Afterwards an implementation algorithm is provided comprising all the elements of the design, in order to obtain the optimal control of the MHF. Finally, practical problems regarding industrial implementations of temperature control in the hearth 4 are discussed and further research items outlined...|$|E
40|$|The {{operation}} of a chemical process plant has become more complex {{with the addition of}} process integration and intensification. A greater emphasis on producing goods with the lowest product variability in the safest manner possible and stringent environmental regulation limiting the quantity of effluent release have all put more constraints on the physical and economic performance of the chemical plant. The performance of a plant is quantified by the ability of the process system to achieve its objectives, which is governed by its process design and control. The conventional approach to process design and control selection starts sequentially by proposing a process flowsheet for the plant. The selection criteria for a flowsheet are normally based only on its environmental impact and economic merits. It is after a process flowsheet is deemed financially suitable that <b>process</b> <b>control</b> <b>development</b> commences. However, a more integrated approach to process design and control stage may thus lead to a plant that has better achievable performance. The aim of this project is to provide a new approach to quantitative dynamic controllability analysis for integration of process design and control by using the concept of passivity and passive systems. Passivity is an input/output property of processes. Passive processes are stable and minimum phase and therefore very easy to control. For a given process, its shortage of passivity, which reflects destabilizing effects of factors such as time delays and Right-Half Plane (RHP) zeros, can be used to indicate its controllability. The project focuses in developing the proposed controllability analysis by combining the idea of passivity and IMC invertibility, which is then formulated into an optimization problem that can be solved by either using Semi-Definite Programming or Non-Linear Optimization. The achievable performance of the plant is quantified in terms of the sensitivity function of the open-loop process. The selection of a process from four different heat-integrated distillation column schemes was used as a case study and the result had clearly shown that the passivity-based controllability analysis was able to select a process based on the plant achievable performance under the constraint of passivity and design parameters...|$|E

40|$|The {{development}} of bottom simulating reflectors (BSRs) {{and the gas}} hydrate stability zone (GHSZ) in continental margins is related to recent depositional and tectonic processes. This interrelation is important for understanding the potential resource of gas hydrate deposits. The {{purpose of this study}} is to understand the influence of such activity on the marine gas hydrate system of the seaward extension of the Trujillo Basin, Peru Margin. Here, we analyze near-seafloor heat flow probe data, high-resolution multichannel seismic (MCS) profiles, swath bathymetry and ocean floor observation system (OFOS) images. Based on our results, we identify three main physiographical subregions in the study area: (1) an area with turbidites, continuous BSRs and low-to-moderate near-seafloor heat flow (7 - 33 mW/m** 2), (2) an area with sediment waves of turbidity origin, a mix of continuous and patchy BSRs, and moderate near-seafloor heat flow (26 - 39 mW/m** 2), (3) an area with extensional faulting, patchy BSRs and moderate-to-high near-seafloor heat flow (52 - 110 mW/m** 2). We conclude that sediment flow processes are the result of recent depositional controls, and faulting is the result of recent tectonic activity. Near-seafloor heat flow around chemoherms is moderate. Estimates of BSR-derived heat flow show differences to near-seafloor heat flow. This difference points to advection of fluids occurring at the seafloor. Alive Calyptogena and tube worms were observed in these venting zones. Based on our analysis, we conclude that: (1) recent depositional <b>processes</b> <b>control</b> the <b>development</b> of continuous BSRs and may restrict heat transfer through the GHSZ in the form of fluid venting at the seafloor, (2) recent tectonic <b>processes</b> <b>control</b> the <b>development</b> of patchy BSRs and allow heat transfer through the GHSZ along faults, which is manifested as fluid venting at the seafloor...|$|R

A suite of nested geomorphological and geophysical methods have been applied to characterise the functioning of rock cliffs and shore platforms influenced by lithological <b>control</b> and geomorphic <b>processes</b> driven by polar coast environments. Electrical resistivity tomosgraphy (ERT) surveys have been used to investigate permafrost control on rock coast dynamics and reveal the strong interaction with marine processes in High Arctic coastal settings. Schmidt hammer rock tests, demonstrated strong spatial control on the degree of rock weathering (rock strength) along High Arctic rock coasts. Elevation controlled geomorphic zones are identified and linked to distinct processes and mechanisms, transitioning from peak hardness values at the ice foot through the wave and storm dominated scour zones to the lowest values on the cliff tops, where the effects of periglacial weathering dominate. Observations of rock surface change using a traversing micro-erosion meter (TMEM) indicate that significant changes in erosion rates occur at the junction between the shore platform and the cliff toe, where rock erosion is facilitated by frequent wetting and drying and operation of nivation and sea ice processes (formation and melting of snow patches and icefoot complexes). The results are synthesised to propose a new conceptual model of High Arctic rock coast systems, with the aim of contributing towards a unifying concept of cold region landscape evolution and providing direction for future research regarding the state of polar rock coasts...|$|R
