5|$|The Indian {{independence}} movement developed {{roots in the}} city when Mahatma Gandhi established two ashrams– the Kochrab Ashram near Paldi in 1915 and the Satyagraha Ashram (now Sabarmati Ashram) {{on the banks of}} the Sabarmati in 1917– which would become centres of nationalist activities. During the mass protests against the Rowlatt Act in 1919, textile workers burned down 51 government buildings across the city in protest at a British attempt to extend wartime regulations after the First World War. In the 1920s, textile workers and teachers went on strike, demanding civil rights and better pay and working conditions. In 1930, Gandhi initiated the Salt Satyagraha from Ahmedabad by embarking from his ashram on the Dandi Salt March. The city's administration and economic institutions were rendered inoperative in the early 1930s by the large numbers of <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>took</b> to the streets in peaceful protests, and again in 1942 during the Quit India Movement. Following independence and the partition of India in 1947, the city was scarred by the intense communal violence that broke out between Hindus and Muslims in 1947, Ahmedabad was the focus for settlement by Hindu migrants from Pakistan, who expanded the city's population and transformed its demographics and economy.|$|E

MDMA also interacts with drugs which inhibit CYP450 enzymes, like ritonavir (Norvir), particularly CYP2D6 inhibitors.

Severe overdose resulting in death has also been reported in <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>took</b> MDMA in combination with certain monoamine oxidase inhibitors, such as phenelzine (Nardil), tranylcypromine (Parnate), or moclobemide (Aurorix, Manerix).|$|E

25|$|Corvettes {{commissioned}} by the Royal Canadian Navy during the Second World War were named after communities for the most part, to better represent the <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>took</b> part in building them. This idea was put forth by Admiral Percy W. Nelles. Sponsors were commonly associated with the community for which the ship was named. Royal Navy corvettes were designed as open sea escorts, while Canadian corvettes were developed for coastal auxiliary roles, as exemplified by their minesweeping gear.

25|$|A 2014 Cochrane review found eight {{clinical}} trials examining garlic {{as a treatment}} for the common cold; it excluded seven due to methodological flaws. The remaining trial, having moderate quality of evidence, concluded that <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>took</b> garlic (dietary supplement with 180 milligrams of allicin content) daily over a three-month period had fewer colds. The review indicated there is insufficient evidence {{to determine the effects of}} garlic in preventing or treating the common cold.

The <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>took</b> the side of Kim became known as 'Easterners', because Kim's house was in Geoncheondong (now Inhyeon) {{to the east of}} Seoul, while the supporters of Sim, who lived in Jeongreungbang to the west of Seoul, became known as 'Westerners'.
