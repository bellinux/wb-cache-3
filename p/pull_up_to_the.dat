5|$|The storm made {{launching}} the lifeboats almost impossible. At about 3:00am, Captain Pearce ordered the two port lifeboats lowered, each with four crew on board. While being passed astern {{one of the}} boats broke the painter and became adrift. Her crew tried hard to <b>pull</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> ship's side, {{but it was impossible}} in the heavy squall. The other was accidentally let go and both boats, in heavy seas, were unable to be retrieved.|$|E
5|$|The video {{begins with}} Carey driving up {{to a large}} movie theater, the Los Angeles Theatre in {{downtown}} Los Angeles, with several of her female friends. As they <b>pull</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> front doors, they tell Carey that her boyfriend is inside with another woman, leading her {{to try to convince}} them to abort the plan of confrontation. After convincing her, they enter the theater and begin a series of small dance routines alongside some of the theater employees. As the music begins, scenes of them dancing and Carey entering the movie projection room inter-cut. Carey sits behind her boyfriend (played by Jerry O'Connell) and the woman he is cheating with, and spy on them in a comedic way with her female lackeys. Soon after, the still unidentified woman walks towards the bathroom, prompting Carey to follow her during a short interlude in the video. After running into each other by the washroom, the woman appears to be Carey sporting a short brown wig and red seductive clothing. Carey pokes her, starting a large brawl in between the two women. Afterwards, Carey appears to have defeated the woman named Bianca, and heads back towards the movie room. During this scene, Jay-Z's rap verse is played, while an animated clip of Jay-Z and Carey is projected onto the screen. Later a version of the video leaked where Jay-Z was rapping his verse in a jacuzzi. During the verse, Carey's friends begin throwing popcorn and other candies at O'Connell, prompting a small food fight in between them. As they halt their attack on him, Carey walks towards O'Connell's seat and acts as though she is Bianca. After she sits next to him and he notices who it is, Carey spills a large soda on his lap and bids him farewell, leaving the theater with her friends smiling.|$|E
25|$|The {{roads of}} St. Mary's County were largely unpaved and {{notoriously}} treacherous until the 1930s, and so water transportation {{was the best}} way to access the county. The school also received its mail and supplies by boat. Steamboats would <b>pull</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> school dock, just below the old Statehouse grounds, as often as twice a week. For a fee they would also carry students and faculty on outings over to Piney Point, or to Virginia.|$|E

25|$|The stop {{is located}} at the {{midpoint}} of a single track unidirectional turning loop around Belmore Park. The stop consists of two platforms. Trams stop at the first platform to allow passengers to alight, then <b>pull</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> second platform to allow boarding. The use of the loop avoids having to terminate the vehicles and the removes the need for the driver to change ends. This loop was not new; it had been used until 1957 as a route on the former Sydney tramway system, but in the opposite direction. The covered area in which the light rail stop is located was previously used as a staff car-park and bus interchange. The stop received an upgrade during January 2017 when the city section of the line was closed for works at the George and Hay Streets intersection.|$|E

The express locomotive, GWR 4000 Class number 4063 [...] "Bath Abbey", was derailed and badly damaged, with several coaches also being damaged. The incident was blamed on signalman A. H. Toop of the Lawrence Hill signal box, with contributing factors including lax working standards and the driver of the goods train, W. G. Atkins, failing to <b>pull</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> signal box as required.|$|E

60|$|We had {{originally}} intended {{to go on to}} Magna Charta Island, a sweetly pretty part of the river, where it winds through a soft, green valley, and to camp in one of the many picturesque inlets to be found round that tiny shore. But, somehow, we did not feel that we yearned for the picturesque nearly so much now as we had earlier in the day. A bit of water between a coal-barge and a gas-works would have quite satisfied us for that night. We did not want scenery. We wanted to have our supper and go to bed. However, we did <b>pull</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> point—“Picnic Point,” it is called—and dropped into a very pleasant nook under a great elm-tree, to the spreading roots of which we fastened the boat.|$|E

60|$|The men {{pulled at}} the hawser, and shoved might and main with the oars. They succeeded in getting out of {{immediate}} danger, but still could not <b>pull</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> anchor in teeth of wind and tide. The coxswain then saw plainly that there was but one resource left--to cut the cable and drive right across the Goodwin Sands. But there was not yet sufficient water on the Sands to float them over; so they held on, intending to ride at anchor until the tide, which had turned, should rise. Very soon, however, the anchor began to drag. This compelled them to hoist sail, cut the cable sooner than they had intended, and attempt to beat off the Sands. It was in vain. A moment more, and they struck with tremendous force. A breaker came rolling towards them, filled the boat, caught her up like a plaything on its crest, and, hurling her a few yards onwards, let her fall again with a shock that well-nigh tore every man out of her. Each successive breaker treated her in this way.|$|E

Used {{to go out and}} leave his register open, and I'd come in here just before dinner and find this place as cold as a barn. We had a running fight of it all winter. The man who got his register open first in the morning got all the heat for the day, for it never turned the other way when it started in one direction. Used to almost suffocate--warm, muggy days--maintaining my rights. Some piano-pounder in there this winter, it seems. Hear? And she hasn't lost any time in learning the trick of the register.
