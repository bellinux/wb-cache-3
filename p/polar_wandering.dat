5000|$|MacDonald's early {{skepticism}} regarding {{plate tectonics}} stemmed from his detailed study, with Walter Munk, of {{the rotation of}} the Earth. Since small polar motions are readily detectable on human time scales, the possibility of explaining paleomagnetic data by <b>polar</b> <b>wandering</b> seemed, for a time, to be a viable possibility; plate tectonic motions are now considered to be the correct explanation.|$|E
50|$|Paleomagnetic evidence, both {{reversals}} and <b>polar</b> <b>wandering</b> data, {{was instrumental}} in verifying the theories of continental drift and plate tectonics in the 1960s and 1970s. Some applications of paleomagnetic evidence to reconstruct histories of terranes have continued to arouse controversies. Paleomagnetic evidence is also used in constraining possible ages for rocks and processes and in reconstructions of the deformational histories of parts of the crust.|$|E
5000|$|In reality, the {{relative}} polar movement {{can either be}} <b>polar</b> <b>wandering</b> or continental drift (or a combination of both). [...] Data {{from around the globe}} are needed in order to isolate or distinguish between the two. Nevertheless, the magnetic poles rarely stray far from the geographic poles of the planet. Therefore, the concept of apparent polar wander is very useful in plate tectonics, since it can retrace {{the relative}} motion of continents, as well as the formation and break-up of supercontinents.|$|E

50|$|Paleomagnetism is used {{to create}} tectonic plate reconstructions by finding the paleolatitude of a {{particular}} site. This paleolatitude is affected both by true <b>polar</b> <b>wander</b> and by plate tectonics. To reconstruct plate tectonic histories, geologists must obtain a number of dated paleomagnetic samples. Because true <b>polar</b> <b>wander</b> is a global phenomenon but tectonic motions are specific to each plate, multiple dates allow them to separate the tectonic and true <b>polar</b> <b>wander</b> signals.|$|R
50|$|True <b>polar</b> <b>wander</b> {{represents}} {{the shift in}} the geographical poles relative to Earth’s surface, after accounting for {{the motion of the}} tectonic plates. This motion is caused by the rearrangement of the mantle and the crust in order to align the maximum inertia with the current rotation axis (fig.1). This is similar to a spinning top; when its rotation is disturbed, it slowly recovers and it will realign its rotation axis to its position of maximum inertia. The difference is that unlike Earth, the spinning top’s mass distribution is constant through its volume over time. Evidence for true <b>polar</b> <b>wander</b> has been observed from the study of large apparent <b>polar</b> <b>wander</b> datasets which, when corrected for the motion of the magnetic pole, display this <b>polar</b> <b>wander.</b> Modern <b>polar</b> <b>wander</b> can be evaluated from precise measurement using stars or satellite measurements, however filtering to remove the wobble of the Earth is required. The formation of supercontinents could initiate a faster <b>polar</b> <b>wander.</b> That is, because the supercontinent creates an extra mass concentration where they are located, the planet tries to re-orient the supercontinent towards the equator.|$|R
50|$|Nubian {{sandstone}} ranges in {{age from}} the Cambrian to Upper Cretaceous eras. Positioning of the paleoequator and paleolatitude at 20° S was derived from paleomagnetic data showing Nubian sandstone was originally deposited in the paleoequatorial to subequatorial zone. These paleomagnetic results corroborated previous studies suggesting there was no <b>polar</b> <b>wandering</b> and continental drift in Africa during 210 to 110 million years and extended this period to 85 million years. Nubian sandstone is deposited under a tropical to subtropical climate and is formed {{under a variety of}} continental conditions, excluding eolian merging intermittently into shallow marine.|$|E
5000|$|The daily {{rotation}} of the Earth is irregular (see ΔT) and constantly slows; therefore the atomic clocks constitute a much more stable timebase. On 1 January 1972, GMT was superseded as the international civil time standard by Coordinated Universal Time, maintained by an ensemble of atomic clocks around the world. Universal Time (UT), a term introduced in 1928, initially represented mean time at Greenwich determined in the traditional way to accord with the originally defined universal day; from 1 January 1956 (as decided by the IAU at Dublin, 1955, at the initiative of William Markowitz) this [...] "raw" [...] form of UT was re-labeled UT0 and effectively superseded by refined forms UT1 (UT0 equalised {{for the effects of}} <b>polar</b> <b>wandering)</b> and UT2 (UT1 further equalised for annual seasonal variations in earth rotation rate).|$|E
5000|$|While {{his ideas}} {{attracted}} a few early supporters such as Alexander Du Toit from South Africa, Arthur Holmes in England [...] and Milutin Milanković in Serbia for whom continental drift theory was the premise in investigating <b>polar</b> <b>wandering,</b> the hypothesis was initially met with skepticism from geologists who viewed Wegener as an outsider, and were resistant to change. The one American edition of Wegener's work, published in 1925, {{which was written}} in [...] "a dogmatic style that often results from German translations", was received so poorly that the American Association of Petroleum Geologists organized a symposium specifically {{in opposition to the}} continental drift hypothesis. The opponents argued, as did the Leipziger geologist Franz Kossmat, that the oceanic crust was too firm for the continents to [...] "simply plough through".|$|E
40|$|We reexamined the Late CretaceousÐearly Tertiary {{apparent}} <b>polar</b> <b>wander</b> {{path for}} the PaciÞc plate using 27 paleomagnetic poles from seamounts dated by 40 Ar/ 39 Ar geochronology. The path shows little motion from 120 to 90 {{million years ago}} (Ma), northward motion from 79 to 39 Ma, and two groups of poles separated by 16 to 21 degrees with indistinguishable mean ages of 84 6 2 Ma. The latter phenomenon may represent a rapid <b>polar</b> <b>wander</b> episode (3 to 10 degrees per million years) whose timing is not adequately resolved with existing data. Similar features in other <b>polar</b> <b>wander</b> paths imply that the event was a rapid shift of the spin axis relative to the mantle (true <b>polar</b> <b>wander),</b> {{which may have been}} related to global changes in plate motion, large igneous province eruptions, and a shift in magnetic Þeld polarity state.

40|$|True <b>polar</b> <b>wander</b> {{would be}} {{recognized}} paleomagnetically as identical apparent <b>polar</b> <b>wander</b> paths for all surface elements. The apparent <b>polar</b> <b>wander</b> paths for the Late Ordovician-Late Devonian interval for Laurentia, Baltica and Gondwana have nearly identical looping shapes {{that can be}} brought into superposition. The paths of these continents are well documented, but even the less well known paths of South China and Siberia reveal similar lengths. The resulting reconstruction places the northern Andean margin of South America opposite the Appalachian margin of Laurentia, with Baltica and Laurentia adjoined in the fit of Bullard and colleagues. Siberia and South China would be {{to the north of}} Africa, if their paleopoles are taken at face value. For middle Paleozoic time, there is of course no information about oceanic domains, but it is interesting that all continental elements, insofar as is known, appear to have similar apparent <b>polar</b> <b>wander</b> tracks that can be plausibly superimposed without causing overlap in the positions of the continents. Albeit speculatively, {{because of the lack of}} information about the oceanic elements, it is suggested in this study that true <b>polar</b> <b>wander</b> may have occurred with a cumulative magnitude of about 75 [deg] during a 75 Ma interval, and may have been of greater magnitude than the apparent <b>polar</b> <b>wander</b> due to relative motions during the middle Paleozoic.

50|$|After {{a period}} in radar {{research}} during the World War II, he joined the Physics Department at the University of Manchester where he did research on aspects of the Earth's magnetic field, taking his Ph.D. under Patrick Blackett in 1949. This led to his interest in palaeomagnetism, {{the study of the}} magnetism of rocks, which he pursued first at the Geophysics Department at the University of Cambridge and later at Newcastle University, where he was appointed to the chair of Physics in 1956. At Newcastle Runcorn developed a strong research group in geophysics, and made substantial contributions to various fields, including convection in the Earth and Moon, the shape and magnetic fields of the Moon and planets, magnetohydrodynamics of the Earth's core, changes in the length of the day, <b>polar</b> <b>wandering,</b> continental drift and plate tectonics.|$|E
5000|$|Paleomagnetic {{study of}} {{apparent}} <b>polar</b> <b>wandering</b> paths also support {{the theory of}} a supercontinent. Geologists can determine the movement of continental plates by examining the orientation of magnetic minerals in rocks; when rocks are formed, they take on the magnetic properties of the Earth and indicate in which direction the poles lie relative to the rock. Since themagnetic poles drift about the rotational pole with a period {{of only a few}} thousand years, measurements from numerous lavas spanning several thousand years are averaged to give an apparent mean polar position. Samples of sedimentary rock and intrusive igneous rock have magnetic orientations that are typically an average of the [...] "secular variation" [...] in the orientation of magnetic north because their remanent magnetizations are not acquired instantaneously. Magnetic differences between sample groups whose age varies by millions of years is due to a combination of true polar wander and the drifting of continents. The true polar wander component is identical for all samples, and can be removed, leaving geologists with the portion of this motion that shows continental drift and can be used to help reconstruct earlier continental positions.|$|E
50|$|Conversations with Wegener, {{the author}} of {{continental}} drift theory, got Milanković interested {{in the interior of}} the Earth and the movement of the poles, so he told his friend that he would investigate <b>polar</b> <b>wandering.</b> In November 1929, Milanković received an invitation from Professor Beno Gutenberg of Darmstadt to collaborate on a ten volume handbook on geophysics and to publish his views on the problem of the secular variations of the Earth’s rotational poles. Wegener, in his scientific work presented numerous empirical evidence which went to the account of the ‘great events’ during of the Earth's past. However, one of the main evidences that especially preoccupied Wegener and then Milankovitch was the discovery of big coal reserves on the Svalbard Islands, in the Arctic Ocean, which could not form at the present latitude of these islands. In the meantime, Wegener died (from hypothermia or heart failure) in November 1930 during the fourth expedition to Greenland. Milanković became convinced that the continents ‘float’ on a somewhat fluid subsurface and that the positions of the continents with respect to the axis of rotation affect the centrifugal force of the rotation and can throw the axis off balance and force it to move.|$|E
50|$|While {{there are}} reputable {{studies showing that}} true <b>polar</b> <b>wander</b> has {{occurred}} at various times in the past, the rates are much smaller (1° per million years or slower) than predicted by the pole shift hypothesis (up to 1° per thousand years). Analysis of the evidence does not lend credence to Hapgood's hypothesized rapid displacement of layers of the Earth.Data indicate that the geographical poles have not deviated by more than about 5° over the last 130 million years, contradicting the hypothesis of a cataclysmic <b>polar</b> <b>wander</b> event.More rapid past possible occurrences of true <b>polar</b> <b>wander</b> have been measured: from 790 to 810 million years ago, true <b>polar</b> <b>wander</b> of approximately 55° may have occurred twice.

However, in what is known as true <b>polar</b> <b>wander,</b> the solid Earth can rotate with respect to a fixed spin axis. Research shows that during the last 200 million years a total true <b>polar</b> <b>wander</b> of some 30° has occurred, but that no super-rapid shifts in the Earth's pole were found during this period. A characteristic rate of true <b>polar</b> <b>wander</b> is 1° or less per million years.

The lecture on the apparent shift of poles was held at a congress of Balkan mathematicians in Athens in 1934 (True polar wander).

In Chapter 1, advantages of using the mode in analysis of paleomagnetic vectors are discussed, and a computer technique is described for contouring and precisely locating the modes of vector distributions that may be highly skewed. In contrast to conventional determinations of the mode, unit vectors from a given data set are treated not as discrete points, but as identical Fisherian probability density functions defined (at an angle θ from the unit vector) by: p=exp(sk(cos θ- 1)), where k is the estimate of the Fisherian concentration parameter, and s is an arbitrarily assigned "smoothing parameter. " A grid, representing the cumulative probability distribution of the total sample of vectors, is contoured to provide a graphical display of the distribution around the most probable value, the mode. By repeatedly contouring the same sample of vectors with successively larger values of s, and by treating the mode as a vector with length given by the total probability value at the mode, "progressive modal diagrams" can be constructed, to aid in determining the stable position of the mode of skewed distributions. In addition, a new statistic, "β_(95) " is suggested as an error estimator for the mode.
