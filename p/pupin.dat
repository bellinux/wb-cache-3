In 1891 Hutin and Leblanc patented an FDM scheme for telephone circuits using resonant circuit filters. Rival patents were filed in 1892 by Michael <b>Pupin</b> and John Stone Stone with similar ideas, priority eventually being awarded to <b>Pupin.</b> However, no scheme using just simple resonant circuit filters can successfully multiplex (i.e. combine) the wider bandwidth of telephone channels (as opposed to telegraph) without either an unacceptable restriction of speech bandwidth or a channel spacing so wide as to make the benefits of multiplexing uneconomic.|$|E

He moved to Columbia University, where he became I. I. Rabi Visiting Professor of Science and Human Relations in 1979, Michael I. <b>Pupin</b> Professor of Physics in 1980, and Emeritus Professor in 1982.

5|$|The {{discovery}} of the neutron by James Chadwick in 1932, followed by that of nuclear fission in uranium by the German chemists Otto Hahn and Fritz Strassmann in 1938, and its theoretical explanation (and naming) by Lise Meitner and Otto Frisch soon after, opened up {{the possibility of a}} controlled nuclear chain reaction with uranium. At the <b>Pupin</b> Laboratories at Columbia University, Enrico Fermi and Leo Szilard began exploring how this might be achieved. Fears that a German atomic bomb project would develop atomic weapons first, especially among scientists who were refugees from Nazi Germany and other fascist countries, were expressed in the Einstein-Szilard letter. This prompted preliminary research in the United States in late 1939.|$|E
5|$|The {{scientists}} at Columbia {{decided that they}} should try to detect the energy released in the nuclear fission of uranium when bombarded by neutrons. On 25 January 1939, {{in the basement of}} <b>Pupin</b> Hall at Columbia, an experimental team including Fermi conducted the first nuclear fission experiment in the United States. The other members of the team were Herbert L. Anderson, Eugene T. Booth, John R. Dunning, G. Norris Glasoe, and Francis G. Slack. The next day, the Fifth Washington Conference on Theoretical Physics began in Washington, D.C. under the joint auspices of George Washington University and the Carnegie Institution of Washington. There, the news on nuclear fission was spread even further, which fostered many more experimental demonstrations.|$|E
5|$|In 1939, the <b>Pupin</b> Physics Laboratories at Columbia where Zinn worked {{were the}} center of {{intensive}} research into the properties of uranium and nuclear fission, which had recently been discovered by Lise Meitner, Otto Hahn and Fritz Strassmann. At Columbia, Zinn, Enrico Fermi, Herbert L. Anderson , John R. Dunning and Leo Szilard investigated whether uranium-238 fissioned with slow neutrons, as Fermi believed, or only the uranium-235 isotope, as Niels Bohr contended. Since pure uranium-235 was not available, Fermi and Szilard chose to work with natural uranium. They were particularly interested in whether a nuclear chain reaction could be initiated. This would require more than one neutron to be emitted per fission on average {{in order to keep}} the chain reaction going. By March 1939, they established that about two were being emitted per fission on average. The delay between an atom absorbing a neutron and fission occurring would be the key to controlling a chain reaction.|$|E
5|$|In {{order for}} a chain {{reaction}} to occur, fissioning uranium atoms had to emit additional neutrons to keep the reaction going. At Columbia University in New York, Enrico Fermi, John Dunning, Herbert L. Anderson, Eugene T. Booth, G. Norris Glasoe, and Francis G. Slack conducted the first nuclear fission experiment in the United States on 25 January 1939. Subsequent work confirmed that fast neutrons were indeed produced by fission. Szilard obtained permission {{from the head of}} the Physics Department at Columbia, George B. Pegram, to use a laboratory for three months, and persuaded Walter Zinn to become his collaborator. They conducted a simple experiment on the seventh floor of <b>Pupin</b> Hall at Columbia, using a radium-beryllium source to bombard uranium with neutrons. They discovered significant neutron multiplication in natural uranium, proving that a chain reaction might be possible.|$|E

25|$|Tired of {{administrative}} work, which kept {{him away from}} his research, Pegram asked Butler to relieve him {{of the position of}} dean in 1930. This request was accepted, in spite of Pegram's demonstrated ability as an administrator. His achievements included the construction of the <b>Pupin</b> Physics Laboratories. Pegram was intimately involved in its design, insisting on a structure without load bearing internal walls, so that it could be reconfigured over time, and with large two-storey lecture theatres. He attempted to expose his physics students to ideas from Europe, inviting Hendrik Lorentz, Larmor, Planck, Max Born and Werner Heisenberg to visit Columbia.|$|E
25|$|The {{discovery}} of nuclear fission by Otto Hahn and Fritz Strassmann, followed by its explanation by Lise Meitner and Otto Frisch in December 1938, ignited {{a flurry of}} activity, with nearly one hundred articles on the subject published {{by the end of}} 1939. At Columbia, Fermi and Dunning were quick to verify Hahn's and Strassmann's results, and there was a lively debate over whether uranium-235 or its more abundant uranium-238 isotope was primarily responsible. Two groups began working at Columbia on attempting to create a nuclear chain reaction in natural uranium. Both were in the <b>Pupin</b> Physics Laboratories, but working independently, at least initially, and on different floors: Fermi and Anderson in the basement, and Szilard and Zin on the seventh floor.|$|E
25|$|Dunning closely {{followed}} {{the work of}} Ernest Lawrence on the cyclotron. Dunning wanted a more powerful neutron source and the cyclotron appeared as an attractive tool to achieve this end. Government funding was not available for such projects in those days, and university budgets were tight. Nonetheless, during 1935 and 1936 he was able construct a cyclotron using many salvaged parts to reduce costs and funding from industrial and private donations. It was announced in 2007 that Columbia University has decided to junk a 70-year-old atom smasher, which is the nation’s oldest artefact of the nuclear era. After being decommissioned in 1965, the machine sat {{in the basement of}} <b>Pupin</b> Hall, home of Columbia's physics department. It was scrapped in 2008, although some components are in the Smithsonian Institution in Washington, DC.|$|E
25|$|A {{sympathetic}} administrator proved {{vital to}} {{building up the}} physics department at Columbia. Pegram hired Isidor Isaac Rabi as a theoretical physicist on Heisenberg's advice. Rabi would later succeed Pegram {{as chairman of the}} physics department. When Pegram heard that Nobel Prize-winning physicist Enrico Fermi wanted to emigrate to the United States with his family to escape Italian Racial Laws that affected his Jewish wife Laura, Pegram was quick to offer a position at Columbia. Recruiting Fermi was a coup; he had offers from four other universities, and Pegram was on the wharf to greet Fermi on his arrival in New York on January 2, 1939. Pegram supported the work of Leo Szilard, granting him access to facilities and laboratory space in the <b>Pupin</b> Physics Laboratories. Other scientists working at Columbia in 1939 included Herbert L. Anderson, Eugene T. Booth, G. Norris Glasoe, Francis G. Slack and Walter Zinn, {{making it one of the}} world's most important centers for nuclear physics.|$|E
25|$|Even {{before it}} was published, Meitner’s and Frisch’s {{interpretation}} {{of the work of}} Hahn and Strassmann crossed the Atlantic Ocean with Niels Bohr, who was to lecture at Princeton University. Isidor Isaac Rabi and Willis Lamb, two University of Columbia physicists working at Princeton, heard the news and carried it back to Columbia. Rabi said he told Fermi; Fermi gave credit to Lamb. Bohr soon afterwards went from Princeton to Columbia to see Fermi. Not finding Fermi in his office, Bohr went down to the cyclotron area and found Anderson. Bohr grabbed him by the shoulder and said: “Young man, let me explain to you about something new and exciting in physics.” It was clear to scientists at Columbia that they should try to detect the energy released in the nuclear fission of uranium from neutron bombardment. On January 25, 1939, Anderson {{was a member of the}} experimental team at Columbia University that conducted the first nuclear fission experiment in the United States, which was conducted in the basement of <b>Pupin</b> Hall; the other members of the team were Eugene T.

25|$|News {{spread quickly}} {{of the new}} discovery, which was {{correctly}} seen as an entirely novel physical effect with great scientific—and potentially practical—possibilities.

The experiment involved placing uranium oxide inside of an ionization chamber and irradiating it with neutrons, and measuring the energy thus released. The results confirmed that fission was occurring and hinted strongly that it was the isotope uranium 235 in particular that was fissioning. The next day, the Fifth Washington Conference on Theoretical Physics began in Washington, D.C. under the joint auspices of the George Washington University and the Carnegie Institution of Washington. There, the news on nuclear fission was spread even further, which fostered many more experimental demonstrations.|$|E

With the help of the mathematician Karl P. Cohen, they built a twelve-stage pilot gaseous diffusion plant at the <b>Pupin</b> Laboratories. Initial tests showed that the stages were not as efficient as the theory would suggest, [...] and that they would need about 4,600 stages to enrich to 90 percent uranium-235.|$|E
500|$|Szilard and Zinn {{conducted}} a simple experiment {{on the seventh}} floor of <b>Pupin</b> Hall at Columbia, using a radium-beryllium source to bombard uranium with neutrons.

Szilard later described the event: [...] "We turned the switch and saw the flashes. We watched them for a little while and then we switched everything off and went home." [...] He understood the implications and consequences of this discovery, though. [...] "That night, there was very little {{doubt in my mind that}} the world was headed for grief".|$|E
500|$|Rainwater then {{chose to}} {{undertake}} postgraduate studies at Columbia University. At {{the time this}} was an unusual move for a scholar from California, as Columbia was not then renowned for its physics; but this had recently changed. George B.

Fermi was engaged in neutron moderator studies {{that would lead to}} the construction of the first nuclear reactor, while Dunning and Eugene T.

500|$|After {{the end of}} the war in August 1945, Wu {{accepted}} an offer of a position as an associate research professor at Columbia.

In 1949, Yuan joined the Brookhaven National Laboratory, and the family moved to Long Island. After the communists came to power in China that year, Wu's father wrote urging her not to return. Since her passport had been issued by the Kuomintang government, she found it difficult to travel abroad. This eventually led to her decision to take out US citizenship in 1954. She would remain at Columbia for the rest of her career. She became an associate professor in 1952, a full professor in 1958, and the Michael I. <b>Pupin</b> Professor of Physics in 1973. Her students called her the Dragon Lady, after the character of that name in the comic strip Terry and the Pirates.|$|E
