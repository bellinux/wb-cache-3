This alarm, along with higher than normal temperatures on the <b>pilot-operated</b> relief valve discharge line and unusually high containment building temperatures and pressures, were clear indications {{that there was an}} ongoing loss-of-coolant accident, but these indications were initially ignored by operators. At 4:15am, the relief diaphragm of the pressurizer relief tank ruptured, and radioactive coolant began to leak out into the general containment building.

25|$|The {{design of}} the <b>pilot-operated</b> relief valve {{indicator}} light was fundamentally flawed. The bulb was simply connected in parallel with the valve solenoid, thus implying that the <b>pilot-operated</b> relief valve was shut when it went dark, without actually verifying the real position of the valve. When everything was operating correctly, the indication was true and the operators became habituated to rely on it. However, when things went wrong and the main relief valve stuck open, the unlighted lamp was actually misleading the operators by implying that the valve was shut. This caused the operators considerable confusion, because the pressure, temperature and coolant levels in the primary circuit, so far as they could observe them via their instruments, were not behaving {{as they would have}} if the <b>pilot-operated</b> relief valve were shut. This confusion contributed to the severity of the accident because the operators were unable to break out of a cycle of assumptions that conflicted with what their instruments were telling them. The problem was not correctly diagnosed until a fresh shift came in who did not have the mindset of the first shift of operators. By this time major damage had occurred.|$|E
25|$|The {{accident}} {{began with}} {{failures in the}} non-nuclear secondary system, followed by a stuck-open <b>pilot-operated</b> relief valve in the primary system, which allowed large amounts of nuclear reactor coolant to escape. The mechanical failures were compounded by the initial failure of plant operators to recognize the situation as a loss-of-coolant accident due to inadequate training and human factors, such as human-computer interaction design oversights relating to ambiguous control room indicators in the power plant's user interface. In particular, a hidden indicator light led to an operator manually overriding the automatic emergency cooling system of the reactor because the operator mistakenly believed that {{there was too much}} coolant water present in the reactor and causing the steam pressure release.|$|E
25|$|The Kemeny Commission {{noted that}} Babcock & Wilcox's <b>pilot-operated</b> relief valve had {{previously}} failed on 11occasions, {{nine of them}} in the open position, allowing coolant to escape. More disturbing, however, {{was the fact that the}} initial causal sequence of events at TMI had been duplicated 18months earlier at another Babcock & Wilcox reactor, the Davis-Besse Nuclear Power Station owned at that time by Toledo Edison. The only difference was that the operators at Davis-Besse identified the valve failure after 20minutes, where at TMI it took 80 minutes, and the Davis-Besse facility was operating at 9% power, against TMI's 97%. Although Babcock engineers recognized the problem, the company failed to clearly notify its customers of the valve issue.|$|E
25|$|Decay heat {{accidents}} are where the heat {{generated by the}} radioactive decay causes harm. In a large nuclear reactor, a {{loss of coolant accident}} can damage the core: for example, at Three Mile Island a recently shutdown (SCRAMed) PWR reactor was left for a length of time without cooling water. As a result, the nuclear fuel was damaged, and the core partially melted. The removal of the decay heat is a significant reactor safety concern, especially shortly after shutdown. Failure to remove decay heat may cause the reactor core temperature to rise to dangerous levels and has caused nuclear accidents. The heat removal is usually achieved through several redundant and diverse systems, and the heat is often dissipated to an 'ultimate heat sink' which has a large capacity and requires no active power, though this method is typically used after decay heat has reduced to a very small value. The main cause of release of radioactivity in the Three Mile Island accident was a <b>pilot-operated</b> relief valve on the primary loop which stuck in the open position. This caused the overflow tank into which it drained to rupture and release large amounts of radioactive cooling water into the containment building.|$|E
2500|$|The {{operators}} had {{not been}} trained to understand the ambiguous nature of the <b>pilot-operated</b> relief valve indicator and to look for alternative confirmation that the main relief valve was closed.

This temperature indicator, however, {{was not part of the}} [...] "safety grade" [...] suite of indicators designed to be used after an incident, and the operators {{had not been}} trained to use it.

It was not until 165 minutes after the start of the problem that radiation alarms activated as contaminated water reached detectors; by that time, the radiation levels in the primary coolant water were around 300times expected levels, and the general containment building was seriously contaminated.|$|E

2500|$|The loss of heat {{removal from}} the primary loop {{and the failure of}} the {{auxiliary}} system to activate caused the primary loop pressure to increase, triggering the <b>pilot-operated</b> relief valve [...] {{at the top of the}} pressurizera pressure active-regulator tankto open automatically. The relief valve should have closed when the excess pressure had been released, and electric power to the solenoid of the pilot was automatically cut, but the relief valve stuck open because of a mechanical fault. The open valve permitted coolant water to escape {{from the primary}} system, and was the principal mechanical cause of the primary coolant system depressurization and partial core disintegration that followed.|$|E
2500|$|As the {{pressure}} in the primary system continued to decrease, reactor coolant continued to flow, but it was boiling inside the core. First, small bubbles of steam formed and immediately collapsed, known as nucleate boiling. As the system pressure decreased further, steam pockets began to form in the reactor coolant. This {{departure from nucleate boiling}} (DNB) into the regime of [...] "film boiling" [...] caused steam voids in coolant channels, blocking the flow of liquid coolant and greatly increasing the fuel cladding temperature. The overall water level inside the pressurizer was rising despite the loss of coolant through the open <b>pilot-operated</b> relief valve, as the volume of these steam voids increased much more quickly than coolant was lost. Because of the lack of a dedicated instrument to measure the level of water in the core, operators judged the level of water in the core solely by the level in the pressurizer. Since it was high, they assumed that the core was properly covered with coolant, unaware that because of steam forming in the reactor vessel, the indicator provided misleading readings. Indications of high water levels contributed to the confusion, as operators were concerned about the primary loop [...] "going solid," [...] (i.e. no steam pocket buffer existing in the pressurizer) which in training they had been instructed to never allow. This confusion was a key contributor to the initial failure to recognize the accident as a loss-of-coolant accident, and led operators to turn off the emergency core cooling pumps, which had automatically started after the <b>pilot-operated</b> relief valve stuck and core coolant loss began, due to fears the system was being overfilled.|$|E

50|$|A {{safety valve}} is a valve {{that acts as}} a {{fail-safe}} in a thermal-hydraulics plant.

50|$|There {{are many}} {{different}} approaches to controlling surge relief equipment. It all starts with the technology used in the specific application.

50|$|In 1799, he {{set down}} {{the concept of the}} modern {{aeroplane}} as a fixed-wing flying machine with separate systems for lift, propulsion, and control. On a small silver disc dated that year, he engraved on one side the forces acting on an aircraft and on the other a sketch of an aircraft design incorporating such modern features as a cambered wing, separate tail comprising a horizontal tailplane and vertical fin, and fuselage for the pilot suspended below the center of gravity to provide stability.

50|$|Hydraulic surges {{are created}} when the {{velocity}} of a fluid suddenly changes and becomes unsteady or transient.

Surge relief systems absorb and limit high-pressure surges, preventing the pressure surge from traveling through the hydraulic system.
