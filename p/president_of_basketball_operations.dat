50|$|Things {{got worse}} in 1996-97 as the Celtics lost a {{franchise}} record 67 games, setting an unwanted NBA record winning only once against other Atlantic Division teams and just fifteen victories overall despite {{the emergence of}} 1st-round draft pick Antoine Walker. With Carr's coaching stint deemed a failure, he stepped aside to another job in the organization when owner Paul Gaston convinced star college coach Rick Pitino to join the franchise as the team's <b>president,</b> director <b>of</b> <b>basketball</b> <b>operations,</b> and head coach. Pitino's appointment as team president was controversial as Auerbach, who had filled that role for more than 25 years, first heard about this change from local media people. Unfortunately for the franchise, Pitino was not the savior everyone expected him to be. Auerbach bore the insult of being elbowed out with dignity, even as the team failed to improve.|$|R

5|$|On February 21, 2017, media sources {{reported}} that the Los Angeles Lakers of the National Basketball Association (NBA) were set to hire Pelinka to serve as general manager {{as part of a}} management shakeup that included the hiring of Magic Johnson as executive vice <b>president</b> <b>of</b> <b>basketball</b> <b>operations</b> in place of Jim Buss and dismissing former GM Mitch Kupchak.

500|$|Some {{fans and}} columnists have accused Reinsdorf of {{breaking}} up the championship Bulls team after their third straight title and sixth in eight years, claiming the Bulls could have competed for more titles with Michael Jordan, Scottie Pippen and good support {{from the rest of}} the team that in the eight-year span included Dennis Rodman, Horace Grant, Toni Kukoč, Ron Harper, BJ Armstrong, and coach Phil Jackson. [...] Some accounts claim that because Jackson feuded with both Reinsdorf and Krause and because both Jordan and Pippen were linked to Jackson, the team was broken up. [...] Forbes describes the scenario as an example of owner greed. [...] Many note that Phil Jackson's decision not to return as coach and Jordan's retirement during the 1998–99 NBA season lockout impacted the decisions of several players on whether to return to Chicago. [...] Krause and Reinsdorf had held out hope that they could convince Jackson and Jordan to return and thus had introduced Tim Floyd as <b>President</b> <b>of</b> Chicago Bulls <b>Basketball</b> <b>Operations</b> instead <b>of</b> head coach. [...] Reinsdorf had made it clear to Jackson that he was wanted back.|$|R

5|$|Dick Versace, the Grizzlies' <b>president</b> <b>of</b> <b>basketball</b> <b>operations,</b> {{stated in}} the final Vancouver season {{that the company was}} losing US$40million per season. These numbers were {{questioned}} by Richard Peddie, CEO of the Raptors, as the Grizzlies had a salary cap of US$48million. Retrospectively, Heisley stated that he lost US$87million on owning the Grizzlies, although that included a US$30million relocation fee to the NBA. Versace stated that he felt that the team did not get sufficient support from the business community. Colin Jones, University of Victoria professor in sports economics, stated that it was difficult to attract corporate sponsors as long as the team was losing so many games; the Grizzlies lack of good draft picks lead to the team failing to win, thus losing revenue. He also noted that the team never sought help in the general business community regarding management issues.|$|E
5|$|With Phil Jackson's {{contract}} expiring, {{the pending}} departures of Scottie Pippen and Dennis Rodman looming, {{and being in}} the latter stages of an owner-induced lockout of NBA players, Jordan retired {{for the second time}} on January 13, 1999. On January 19, 2000, Jordan returned to the NBA not as a player, but as part owner and <b>President</b> <b>of</b> <b>Basketball</b> <b>Operations</b> for the Washington Wizards. Jordan's responsibilities with the Wizards were comprehensive. He controlled all aspects of the Wizards' basketball operations, and had the final say in all personnel matters. Opinions of Jordan as a basketball executive were mixed. He managed to purge the team of several highly paid, unpopular players (such as forward Juwan Howard and point guard Rod Strickland), but used the first pick in the 2001 NBA draft to select high schooler Kwame Brown, who did not live up to expectations and was traded away after four seasons.|$|E
5|$|On September 30, 2013, Sims {{signed with}} the Boston Celtics. He {{was one of four}} nonguaranteed {{training}} camp invites (along with Damen Bell-Holter, Kammron Taylor and Chris Babb), vying for the final roster spot after accounting for the 14 guaranteed contracts. He was one of three small forwards invited to camp, along with Jeff Green, Gerald Wallace. On October 26, 2013, he was waived by the Celtics who waived all four nonguaranteed invitees reducing their roster to 14. After waiving the four players, Celtics <b>president</b> <b>of</b> <b>basketball</b> <b>operations</b> Danny Ainge said all four were welcome to join the team's D-League affiliate, Maine Red Claws, if they were willing to accept the low paying salary instead of higher paying offers overseas. Sims {{was the only one of}} the four who did not sign with the Red Claws by the end of the month. That year, he went on to sign with Hapoel Gilboa Galil of the Israeli Basketball Super League. In August 2014, he signed with Jeonju KCC Egis of the Korean Basketball League.|$|E
