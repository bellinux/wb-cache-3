Gerald Touch, originally from the Clarendon Laboratory, converted the EMI receiver to this wavelength by using the existing set as the intermediate frequency (IF) stage of a superheterodyne circuit. The original 45MHz frequency would remain the IF setting for many following radar systems. On its first test on 17 August, Anson K6260 with Touch and Keith Wood aboard immediately detected shipping in the English Channel at a range of [...] The team later increased the wavelength slightly to 1.5m to improve sensitivity of the receiver, and this 200MHz setting would be common to many radar systems of this era.|$|E

50|$|A <b>push-pull</b> <b>amplifier</b> {{produces}} less distortion than a single-ended one. This {{allows a}} class-A or AB <b>push-pull</b> <b>amplifier</b> {{to have less}} distortion for the same power as the same devices used in single-ended configuration. Class AB and class B dissipate less power for the same output than class A; distortion can be kept low by negative feedback and by biassing the output stage to reduce crossover distortion.|$|E
5000|$|High {{efficiency}} Class B+ <b>push-pull</b> <b>amplifiers</b> {{operate at}} higher bias points (near zero or even positive values).

50|$|Many {{symmetrical}} {{electronic circuits}} reduce {{the magnitude of}} even harmonics generated by the non-linearities of the amplifier's components, by combining two signals from opposite halves of the circuit where distortion components that are roughly the same magnitude but out of phase.

50|$|Semiconductor power {{amplifiers}} {{do not have}} the severe limitations on output power imposed by thermionic devices; accordingly loudspeaker design has evolved in the direction of smaller. more convenient, loudspeakers, trading off power efficiency for small size, giving speakers of similar quality but smaller size which require much greater power for the same loudness than hitherto. In response, many modern valve <b>push-pull</b> <b>amplifiers</b> are more powerful than earlier designs, reflecting the need to drive inefficient speakers.|$|R

The phase-splitter {{stage is}} usually another vacuum tube but a transformer with a center-tapped secondary winding was occasionally {{used in some}} designs. Because these are essentially square-law devices, the comments regarding distortion cancellation mentioned above apply to most push-pull tube designs when operated in class A (i.e. neither device is driven to its non-conducting state).|$|R

50|$|In a class B <b>push-pull</b> <b>amplifier,</b> {{output valve}} current {{which must be}} {{provided}} by the power supply ranges from nearly zero for zero signal to a maximum at maximum signal.

50|$|The 12AU7 is a medium-mu dual triode {{often found}} in the driver / phase {{inverter}} stage of a <b>push-pull</b> power <b>amplifier</b> and also results in significant non-linearity {{in the middle of}} its dynamic operating curve.|$|R
40|$|In this paper, {{we compare}} the {{performance}} of the newly introduced distributed active transformer (DAT) structure to that of conventional on-chip impedance-transformations methods. Their fundamental power-efficiency limitations in the design of high-power fully integrated amplifiers in standard silicon process technologies are analyzed. The DAT is demonstrated to be an efficient impedance-transformation and power-combining method, which combines several low-voltage <b>push-pull</b> <b>amplifiers</b> in series by magnetic coupling. To demonstrate the validity of the new concept, a 2. 4 -GHz 1. 9 -W 2 -V fully integrated power-amplifier achieving a power-added efficiency of 41 % with 50 -Ω input and output matching has been fabricated using 0. 35 -μm CMOS transistor...|$|R
50|$|In <b>push-pull</b> <b>amplifiers</b> and in CMOS, {{the even}} {{harmonics}} of both transistors just cancel. Experiment {{shows that a}} square wave can be generated by those amplifiers. Theoretically square waves consist of odd harmonics only. In a class-D amplifier, the output filter blocks all harmonics; i.e., the harmonics see an open load. So even small currents in the harmonics suffice to generate a voltage square wave. The current is in phase with the voltage applied to the filter, but the voltage across the transistors is out of phase. Therefore, there is a minimal overlap between current through the transistors and voltage across the transistors. The sharper the edges, the lower the overlap.|$|R
50|$|A class - B <b>push-pull</b> <b>amplifier</b> is more {{efficient}} than a class-A power amplifier because each output device amplifies only half the output waveform and is cut off during the opposite half. It can be shown that the theoretical full power efficiency (AC power in load compared to DC power consumed) of a push-pull stage is approximately 78.5%. This compares with a class-A amplifier which has efficiency of 25% if directly driving the load {{and no more than}} 50% for a transformer coupled output. A <b>push-pull</b> <b>amplifier</b> draws little power with zero signal, compared to a class-A amplifier that draws constant power. Power dissipation in the output devices is roughly one-fifth of the output power rating of the amplifier. A class-A amplifier, by contrast, must use a device capable of dissipating several times the output power.|$|E
50|$|A {{so-called}} ultra-linear <b>push-pull</b> <b>amplifier</b> uses either pentodes or tetrodes {{with their}} screen grid fed from {{a percentage of}} the primary voltage on the output transformer. This gives efficiency and distortion that is a good compromise between triode (or triode-strapped) power amplifier circuits and conventional pentode or tetrode output circuits where the screen is fed from a relatively constant voltage source.|$|E
5000|$|A <b>push-pull</b> <b>amplifier</b> is more {{efficient}} than a single-ended [...] "class-A" [...] amplifier. The output power {{that can be achieved}} is higher than the continuous dissipation rating of either transistor or tube used alone and increases the power available for a given supply voltage. Symmetrical construction of {{the two sides of the}} amplifier means that even-order harmonics are cancelled, which can reduce distortion. DC current is cancelled in the output, allowing a smaller output transformer to be used than in a single-ended amplifier. However, the <b>push-pull</b> <b>amplifier</b> requires a phase-splitting component that adds complexity and cost to the system; use of center-tapped transformers for input and output is a common technique but adds weight and restricts performance. If the two parts of the amplifier do not have identical characteristics, distortion can be introduced as the two halves of the input waveform are amplified unequally. Crossover distortion can be created near the zero point of each cycle as one device is cut off and the other device enters its active region.|$|E

50|$|Class-A {{amplifiers}} can {{be designed}} to have good linearity in both single ended and <b>push-pull</b> topologies. <b>Amplifiers</b> of classes AB1, AB2 and B can be linear only when a tuned tank circuit is employed, or in the push-pull topology, in which two active elements (tubes, transistors) are used to amplify positive and negative parts of the RF cycle respectively. Class-C amplifiers are not linear in any topology.|$|R
5000|$|A {{single-ended}} triode (SET) is {{a vacuum}} tube electronic amplifier {{that uses a}} single triode to produce an output, {{in contrast to a}} <b>push-pull</b> <b>amplifier</b> which uses a pair of devices with antiphase inputs to generate an output with the wanted signals added and the distortion components subtracted. Single-ended amplifiers normally operate in Class A; push-pull amplifiers can also operate in Classes AB or B [...] without excessive net distortion, due to cancellation.|$|E
5000|$|Push-pull {{amplifiers}} use two nominally identical gain devices [...] "back to back". One {{consequence of}} this is that all even-order harmonic products cancel, allowing only odd order distortion. This is because a <b>push-pull</b> <b>amplifier</b> has a symmetric (odd symmetry) transfer characteristic. It is worthwhile to acknowledge that almost all power amplifiers are of the push-pull type {{in order to avoid the}} great inefficiency of class A amplifiers, which are otherwise required for single-ended linear amplification.|$|E
50|$|The {{difficulty}} of removing harmonics from an amplifier {{will depend on}} the design. A <b>push-pull</b> <b>amplifier</b> will have fewer harmonics than a single ended circuit. A class A amplifier will have very few harmonics, class AB or B more, and class C the most. In the typical class C amplifier, the resonant tank circuit will remove most of the harmonics, but in either of these examples, a low pass filter will likely be needed following the amplifier.|$|E
40|$|A novel on-chip {{impedance}} matching and power-combining method, the distributed active transformer is presented. It combines several low-voltage <b>push-pull</b> <b>amplifiers</b> efficiently with their outputs in series {{to produce a}} larger output power while maintaining a 50 -Ω match. It also uses virtual ac grounds and magnetic couplings extensively to {{eliminate the need for}} any off-chip component, such as tuned bonding wires or external inductors. Furthermore, it desensitizes the operation of the amplifier to the inductance of bonding wires making the design more reproducible. To demonstrate the feasibility of this concept, a 2. 4 -GHz 2 -W 2 -V truly fully integrated power amplifier with 50 -Ω input and output matching has been fabricated using 0. 35 -μm CMOS transistors. It achieves a power added efficiency (PAE) of 41 % at this power level. It can also produce 450 mW using a 1 -V supply. Harmonic suppression is 64 dBc or better.

50|$|An {{uncommon}} way {{of driving}} an electrostatic speaker without a transformer is {{to connect the}} plates of a <b>push-pull</b> vacuum tube <b>amplifier</b> directly to the stators, and the high voltage supply between the diaphragm and ground.|$|R
50|$|In analog <b>push-pull</b> power <b>amplifiers</b> the two {{output devices}} operate in {{antiphase}} (i.e. 180° apart).

Symmetrical push-pull circuits must cancel even order harmonics, like f2, f4, f6 and therefore promote odd order harmonics, like (f1), f3, f5 when driven into the nonlinear range.|$|R
