40|$|What do {{you think}} about these statements? - Research is more {{important}} than teaching - Veterinary clinical research is more important than basic research - Academic freedom is an anachronism Of course you do not agree, certainly not with all of them, and one or the other may even have irritated you. Bumper sticker one-liners like these do not only seduce the modest mind. In the Netherlands, a political murder was their indirect consequence, when an environmental/animal rights activist assassinated the populist <b>Pim</b> <b>Fortuyn.</b> This politician <b>s</b> tactics were to reduce complex political issues to commandments the man in the street would comprehend, by removing any modifier and nuance. Generalizations seem to have this effect inducing a mental patellar reflex, causing an instant agree/reject reaction before rational analysis kicks in. Only then and only in some does introspection begin. The pros and cons are weighed, pondered, judged. Emotions reign even where one would expect analysis, insight and wisdom. I start to wonder when I read that President George Bush is angry. I hope he is not; it could affect his reason...|$|R

50|$|Livable Rotterdam (Leefbaar Rotterdam) {{is a local}} {{political}} party in the municipality of Rotterdam in the Netherlands, which was founded by Ronald Sørensen in 2001. It won the council elections of March 2002 due to the charismatic leadership of <b>Pim</b> <b>Fortuyn.</b> This made it the city's largest political party, a position which for the previous thirty years had been held by the Labour Party. Livable Rotterdam started as a spin-off of the national party Livable Netherlands but is commonly seen as the local party of the LPF (<b>Pim</b> <b>Fortuyn</b> List), the national party of <b>Pim</b> <b>Fortuyn</b> which was founded just after <b>Pim</b> <b>Fortuyn</b> was fired as lijsttrekker of the Livable Netherlands party in spring 2002.|$|R

50|$|<b>Pim</b> <b>Fortuyn</b> is {{credited}} with changing the Dutch political landscape and culture with his ideology, which {{came to be known}} as Fortuynism. The 2002 elections were marked by large losses for the liberal People's Party for Freedom and Democracy and the social democratic Labour Party. Both parties replaced their leaders shortly after the election. The <b>Pim</b> <b>Fortuyn</b> List and the Christian Democratic Appeal made significant gains.

50|$|The <b>Pim</b> <b>Fortuyn</b> List (Lijst <b>Pim</b> <b>Fortuyn,</b> LPF) was {{a right-wing}} populist {{political}} {{party in the}} Netherlands. The eponymous founder of the party was <b>Pim</b> <b>Fortuyn,</b> a charismatic former university professor and political columnist who initially had planned to contest the 2002 general election {{as leader of the}} Livable Netherlands (LN) party. He was however dismissed as party leader in February 2002 due to controversial remarks he made in a newspaper interview on immigration-related issues, and instead founded LPF a few days later. After gaining support in opinion polls, Fortuyn was assassinated on 6 May 2002, nine days before the election.

In Holland radical right-wing populist parties failed despite that the political and economic situation during the 1990 s were characterized by some of the factors usually depicted as crucial for the emergence of radical right-wing populist parties elsewhere.

50|$|The {{coalition}} cabinet which formed {{after the}} election of the Christian Democratic Appeal, <b>Pim</b> <b>Fortuyn</b> List and People's Party for Freedom and Democracy fell after three months, due to conflicts between <b>Pim</b> <b>Fortuyn</b> List members. In the following elections, the <b>Pim</b> <b>Fortuyn</b> List returned eight seats in the House of Representatives (out of 150) and did not form part of the new government. However, political commentators speculated that there was still a sizable number of discontented voters who might have voted for a non-traditional party, if a viable alternative was available. In recent times, the right-wing Party for Freedom, which has a strong stance on immigration and integration, won nine (out of 150) seats in the 2006 elections and 24 in the 2010 elections.|$|R
