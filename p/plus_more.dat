25|$|The Apprentice was so {{successful}} that, according to Trump, he earned $214 million from 14 seasons of the show, <b>plus</b> <b>more</b> from related product licensing as his name as a brand became more valuable. As {{the popularity of the}} series grew, {{more and more of the}} tasks began to be tied to specific companies. For example, sales tasks would require a team to take over a brand-name storefront or restaurant and operate it; and marketing tasks would require teams to prepare a marketing material (e.g. a jingle or flyer) or campaign for an established company. In later series, the launches of specific products would be tied to the airing of episodes of the series. Several companies have appeared multiple times on the show.|$|E

Blockbuster's move to follow the business pattern with its online rentals as was established by Netflix prompted Netflix to sue Blockbuster for patent infringement. Blockbuster counter sued with a counterclaim alleging deceptive practices with its patent which it alleged was designed to maintain an illegal monopoly. The suits were eventually settled, and while the terms were not disclosed it was later reported that Netflix recorded a settlement payment from Blockbuster of $4.1 million in the second quarter of 2007.|$|E

25|$|The 11th Regiment's last {{action was}} the Battle of Monmouth on 28 June 1778. On 22 June, Washington ordered each brigade {{in the army}} to detach one officer and 25 sharpshooters to join a corps led by Daniel Morgan. On 24 June, Morgan was {{directed}} to annoy the right flank and rear of Sir Henry Clinton's retreating British army. Washington also sent a 1,500 detachment of picked men from the entire army under Charles Scott to harass the British left flank. Another 1,000 picked men led by Wayne were sent out on 25 June. The various detachments <b>plus</b> <b>more</b> units were placed {{under the command of}} Charles Lee. The 2nd Pennsylvania Brigade under the acting command of Francis Johnston had 53 officers, 13 staff, 115 non-commissioned officers, and 647 privates, or a total strength of 828 men. However, the detachments to Lee's advance guard reduced the brigade's numbers to 35 officers, 51 sergeants, and 401 rank and file, or 487 men. The rump of the 11th Pennsylvania was led by Humpton. Of the four 360-man detachments under Scott, one was under the leadership of a Pennsylvanian, that of Richard Butler. Of the three 350-man detachments under Wayne, one was under Pennsylvanian Walter Stewart.|$|E
25|$|The {{new season}} started with Delio Rossi still {{in charge of}} the club: Simon Kjær and Edinson Cavani left the club, and a few more {{promising}} youngsters were signed (most notably Argentine Ezequiel Muñoz and the Slovene duo of Armin Bačinović and Josip Iličić), <b>plus</b> <b>more</b> experienced acquisitions such as forwards Massimo Maccarone and Mauricio Pinilla. The 2010–11 season also marked Palermo's return into continental football {{in the form of the}} UEFA Europa League. Palermo reached their third Coppa Italia finals after defeating Milan 4–3 on aggregate on 10 May 2011, losing 3–1 to Internazionale in the final. For the 2011–12 season, Delio Rossi was replaced by former Chievo boss Stefano Pioli, who was, however, sacked before the Serie A kickoff after being eliminated by Swiss minnows FC Thun in the Europa League third preliminary round. In a somewhat surprise move, Pioli was replaced by under-19 team coach Devis Mangia, with no managerial experience other than at youth team and minor league level; despite that, Mangia turned Palermo fortunes by leading the Rosanero in fifth place thanks to an impressive string of six consecutive home wins, thus deserving a long-term deal at the club. A string of poor results, however, led Palermo to three consecutive defeats, including elimination from the Coppa Italia and a disappointing loss in the Sicilian derby, persuading Zamparini to replace Mangia with the more experienced Bortolo Mutti. Palermo arrived 16th in that season.|$|E

The Simpsons writers Al Jean and Mike Reiss, who were show runners during the previous two seasons, {{came up with the}} idea for the episode. They left the idea with David Mirkin, who took over the job as show runner during this season. Mirkin said he was [...] "very excited and intrigued" [...] with the idea of the episode. Soon thereafter, he assigned Daniels to write the script because he knew that Daniels would [...] "step up" [...] and [...] "throw himself into it". In an interview with the Chicago Tribune, Mirkin stated that when he took over the show, he wanted to [...] "bring it back" [...] to character and story, unlike the previous season which got [...] "so fast-moving and so full of cutaway gags". Mirkin added: [...] "I explored the characters a little more, took them a little further. I had one of the first episodes where Homer was really tempted by another woman, [...] "The Last Temptation of Homer", and Bart having a girlfriend even nastier than himself, [...] "Bart's Girlfriend", <b>plus</b> <b>more</b> of a focus on side characters. We did the first episode to really feature Apu as a main character. Those were my goals." [...] Kirkland said he was grateful that he got to work with a [...] "wonderful crew" [...] on the episode, including Bob Anderson, who he thought was a [...] "wonderful" [...] director. Kirkland said that Anderson assisted him on the episode and did [...] "fine animation throughout".|$|E
500|$|The Sega Genesis {{has often}} been {{considered}} among the best video game consoles ever produced. In 2009, IGN named it the fifth best video game console, citing its edge in sports games and better home version of Mortal Kombat, and lauding [...] "what some {{consider to be the}} greatest controller ever created: the six button." [...] In 2007, GameTrailers named the Sega Genesis as the sixth best console of all time in their list of top ten consoles that [...] "left their mark on the history of gaming," [...] noting its great games and solid controller, and writing of the [...] "glory days" [...] of Sonic the Hedgehog. In January 2008, technology columnist Don Reisinger proclaimed that the Sega Genesis [...] "created the industry's best console war to date," [...] citing Sonic the Hedgehog, superior sports games, and backward compatibility with the Sega Master System. GamingExcellence also gave the Sega Genesis sixth place in 2008, declaring [...] "one can truly see the Genesis for the gaming milestone it was." [...] At the same time, GameDaily rated it ninth of ten for its memorable games. In 2014, USgamer's Jeremy Parish wrote that [...] "If the Atari generation introduced video games as a short-lived '70s fad... and the NES generation established it into an enduring obsession for the young, Sega's Genesis began pushing the medium toward something resembling its contemporary form", expounding that the system served as [...] "the key incubator for modern sports franchises", made [...] "consoles truly international" [...] by providing Western third-parties previously put at a disadvantage by Nintendo's restrictive licensing policies with a more profitable alternative, created [...] "an online subscription service" [...] that foreshadowed [...] "PlayStation <b>Plus</b> <b>more</b> than 15 years early" [...] with the Sega Channel, and [...] "played a key role in ensuring the vitality and future of the games industry by breaking Nintendo's near-monopolistic hold on the U.S. and awakening the U.K. to the merits of television gaming." [...] For his part, Kalinske highlighted Sega's role in developing games for an older demographic and pioneering [...] "the concept of the 'street date'" [...] with the simultaneous North American and European release of Sonic the Hedgehog 2. John Sczepaniak of Retro Gamer noted [...] "It was a system where the allure was born not only of the hardware and games, but the magazines, playground arguments, climate, and politics of the time." ...|$|E
