The plant was finished in 1972, being fourth-largest in the world at the time (according to the staff at the power plant). It was a big collaboration project between Yugoslavia and Romania.

The percentage of evergreen species increases towards the southeast part of the investigated area. Conifer taxa {{are supposed to be}} of prevailing importance in mountainous forests. Arguments for either xeromorphic mediterranean-like vegetation or for steppe-like conditions (extensive dry grassland) are scarce and probably invalid.

Oklahoma Native <b>Plant</b> <b>Record</b> Journal of the Oklahoma Native Plant Society One hundred eighty-one species of vascular plants were collected from 144 genera and 63 families. The families with the greatest number of species were the Asteraceae (25), Poaceae (22), and Fabaceae (18). Fifty-seven species were annuals, four biennials, and 120 were perennials. Thirty-nine woody plant species were present. Twenty-one species exotic to North America were collected representing 11. 6 % of the flora. Azolla caroliniana was the only species tracked by the Oklahoma Natural Heritage Inventory found. This study reports 148 species previously not documented in Wagoner County...|$|E
40|$|The Fernbank interglacial site, on {{the west}} side of Cayuga Lake, New York, has been {{recently}} subjected to more detailed study. To a lengthened mollusc list are added ostracodes, insects, fish, pollen, and plant macrofossils. Of these, plants are well preserved and diverse, whereas other groups are poorly preserved and incomplete. Nevertheless, all support the interglacial assignment (Sangamon), which is further supported by minimum age radiocarbon dates (> 50, 000 14 C yr BP) and a TL date of 81 ± 11 ka. In the <b>plant</b> <b>record</b> near the top of the sequence, abundant tree charcoal indicates forest fires. Like the Toronto interglacial record, the plants show a declining July mean temperature from 24 to 18 °C (according to transfer functions) through the sequence, from mixed deciduous forest to boreal forest...|$|E

C. kentuckiense is considered a rare species throughout its range, but is not currently protected under the United States Endangered Species Act. The objectives {{of this study were}} to (1) determine whether known populations of C. kentuckiense were persisting in Oklahoma and (2) characterize habitat structure. Twelve sites were surveyed in 2001 and 2002 for populations of C. kentuckiense, but only three persistent populations were found.
