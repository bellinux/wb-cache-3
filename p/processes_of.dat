5|$|In recent years, {{this latter}} {{argument}} has been fortified by {{the theory of}} connectionism.

5|$|Living organisms must {{obey the}} laws of thermodynamics, which {{describe}} the transfer of heat and work. The second law of thermodynamics states that in any closed system, the amount of entropy (disorder) cannot decrease. Although living organisms' amazing complexity appears to contradict this law, life is possible as all organisms are open systems that exchange matter and energy with their surroundings. Thus living systems are not in equilibrium, but instead are dissipative systems that maintain their state of high complexity by causing a larger increase in the entropy of their environments. The metabolism of a cell achieves this by coupling the spontaneous <b>processes</b> <b>of</b> catabolism to the non-spontaneous <b>processes</b> <b>of</b> anabolism. In thermodynamic terms, metabolism maintains order by creating disorder.|$|E
