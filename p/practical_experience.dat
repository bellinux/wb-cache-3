40|$|This {{study was}} {{directed}} at investigating the need for <b>practical</b> <b>experiences</b> in the undergraduate education of secondary school teachers in Greece. The judgement concerning such a need {{was based on the}} conclusions drawn from the examination of international practices in the field of <b>practical</b> <b>experiences</b> and from the perceptions of first year Greek teachers regarding the need for such experiences. The education of Greek secondary school teachers was compared with the education of similar teachers in France, Germany and the United. States. The perceptions of Greek teachers concerning the need for <b>practical</b> <b>experiences</b> were assessed through their response to a questionnaire. Of the 350 beginning teachers contacted, 180 responded. The questionnaire consisted of 20 items which described skills identified through the literature as outcomes of <b>practical</b> <b>experiences.</b> The twenty skills were classified under the following seven subcategories: 1. Classroom management 2. Planning for instruction 3. Application of learning theories 4. Teacher awareness of his/her strengths and weaknesses 5. Awareness of student needs 6. Student evaluation 7. Awareness of the multiple duties of the teacherUsing a four-point, agree-disagree scale, the respondents rated each skill first as to its importance and then as to the adequacy of their training with regard to the skill. The relative importance and adequacy score for each skill was determined by calculating the percentage of respondents who rated the skill important or their preparation adequate. Demographic information on the teachers was collected for the description of the sample and to serve as independent variables in the analysis of the data [...] One-way analyses of variance were performed to investigate the significance of the selected variables on the degree of importance and adequacy of each subscale. On the basis of the one-way analyses of variance, two independent variables were selected for a multi-analyses of variance. The following conclusions were based on the findings of the comparative examination of teacher education systems and on the analyses of the survey data. 1. In all systems except that of Greece the importance of <b>practical</b> <b>experiences</b> has been recognized and ways have been devised to incorporate <b>practical</b> <b>experiences</b> in the education of secondary school teachers. 2. In the French, the German, and the American systems, there was a discernible trend toward improving education courses offered in universities by strengthening the <b>practical</b> <b>experiences</b> component. 3. The analysis of the survey data indicated that more than 84 °,%% of the Greek teachers felt that the skills were important, but less than 37 % considered their training in these skills adequate. 4. Greek teachers' perceptions {{of the importance of the}} classroom management skills differed significantly depending on the university from which they had graduated. 5. Greek teachers' perceptions of the importance of skills for the application of learning theories differed significantly depending on the kind of pre-service teaching experience the respondents had. Those teachers with substitute teaching experience rated these skills more important. 6. Teachers who had not received any kind of <b>practical</b> <b>experiences</b> during their education rated the adequacy of their preparation in classroom management skills as less adequate. 7. Math/science teachers, more than any other subject matter teacher, considered classroom management skills important. They also perceived their preparation regarding these skills as least adequate. International developments regarding <b>practical</b> <b>experiences</b> in teacher education and the need for such experiences expressed by Greek teachers strongly suggest that some form of <b>practical</b> <b>experiences</b> be incorporated into the education of secondary school teachers in Greece.

This paper presents findings from a qualitative study of ten students {{who engaged in}} experiential learning of evaluation. A grounded theory approach was used to understand what and how students learn about evaluation through these opportunities. This study is important because there is strong support for <b>practical</b> <b>experiences</b> in teaching evaluation and documented success of the strategy in other fields, yet little empirical research on experiential learning specific to evaluation exists (Trevisan, 2004). Findings suggest that students develop technical skills, soft skills, and learn about evaluation context via <b>practical</b> <b>experiences.</b> In addition, <b>practical</b> <b>experiences</b> help students gain confidence and refine their ideas about who they are as evaluators. Peer learning provides {{an important source of}} support for students, and mentorship is also important, although a tricky balance exists between providing enough support and providing sufficient room for autonomy...|$|R

He emigrated to the United States in 1884, where he would become a naturalized citizen. He worked for a short time at the Edison Machine Works in New York City before he struck out on his own. With the help of partners to finance and market his ideas, Tesla set up laboratories and companies in New York to develop a range of electrical and mechanical devices. His alternating current (AC) induction motor and related polyphase AC patents, licensed by Westinghouse Electric in 1888, earned him a considerable amount of money and became the cornerstone of the polyphase system which that company would eventually market.|$|E
5|$|In 1118, Henry {{returned}} north {{over the}} Alps into Germany to suppress fresh rebellions, leaving Matilda as his regent to govern Italy. There are few records of her rule {{over the next}} two years, but she probably gained considerable <b>practical</b> <b>experience</b> of government. In 1119, she returned north to meet Henry in Lotharingia. Her husband was occupied in finding a compromise with the Pope, who had excommunicated him. In 1122, Henry and probably Matilda were at the Council of Worms. The council settled the long-running dispute with the Church when Henry gave up his rights to invest bishops with their episcopal regalia. Matilda attempted to visit her father in England that year, but the journey was blocked by Charles I, Count of Flanders, whose territory she would have needed to pass through. Historian Marjorie Chibnall argues Matilda had intended to discuss the inheritance of the English crown on this journey.|$|E
5|$|The 1986 SQL {{standard}} basically adopted Codd's proposal {{after an}} implementation prototype in IBM System R. Although Don Chamberlin recognized nulls (alongside duplicate rows) {{as one of}} the most controversial features of SQL, he defended the design of Nulls in SQL invoking the pragmatic arguments that it was the least expensive form of system support for missing information, saving the programmer from many duplicative application-level checks (see semipredicate problem) while at the same time providing the database designer with the option not to use Nulls if he so desires; for example, in order to avoid well known anomalies (discussed in the semantics section of this article). Chamberlin also argued that besides providing some missing-value functionality, <b>practical</b> <b>experience</b> with Nulls also led to other language features which rely on Nulls, like certain grouping constructs and outer joins. Finally, he argued that in practice Nulls also end up being used as a quick way to patch an existing schema when it needs to evolve beyond its original intent, coding not for missing but rather for inapplicable information; for example, a database that quickly needs to support electric cars while having a miles-per-gallon column.|$|E
