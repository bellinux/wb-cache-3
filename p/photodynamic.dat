25|$|Type I Photosensitivity {{occurs when}} the <b>photodynamic</b> {{compounds}} need not undergo metabolism to be activated and so may accumulate under the skin directly following ingestion. Examples of plants producing Type I Photosensitivity include Buckwheat and St John's wort (Hypericum perforatum). Certain drugs such as phenothiazine or its derivatives may also lead to photosensitivity reactions, commonly in sheep. Phenothiazine is converted by the body into the <b>photodynamic</b> compound phenothiazine sulfoxide.|$|E
25|$|Other {{innovations}} include harnessing sunlight {{for space}} communications and meteorological information; controlling light-dependent chemical reactions; and developing <b>photodynamic</b> cancer therapy.|$|E
25|$|Photosensitivity is an {{abnormal}} skin reaction to direct sunlight exposure. It is unrelated to a sunburn. These reactions {{are due to}} photosensitization, the accumulation of photosensitive compounds beneath the skin. In some cases, the <b>photodynamic</b> substances come from ingested plants or drugs, after being metabolized or not. In other cases, the <b>photodynamic</b> substances may be produced in the body itself due to inborn errors in pigment metabolism, especially those involving the heme synthesis. Photosensitivity reactions are usually seen in herbivorous or omnivorous animals, though such reactions are not uncommon among carnivores.|$|E
25|$|<b>Photodynamic</b> therapy {{may have}} promise in {{treating}} mucosal dysplasia and small {{head and neck}} tumors. Amphinex is giving good results in early clinical trials for treatment of advanced head and neck cancer.|$|E
25|$|Forms of {{endoscopic}} therapy {{have been}} used for stage 0 and I disease: endoscopic mucosal resection (EMR) and mucosal ablation using radiofrequency ablation, <b>photodynamic</b> therapy, Nd-YAG laser, or argon plasma coagulation.|$|E
25|$|<b>Photodynamic</b> therapy (PDT) is {{generally}} a non-invasive treatment {{using a combination}} of light and a photosensitive drug, such as 5-ALA, Foscan, Metvix, Tookad, WST09, WST11, Photofrin, or Visudyne. The drug is triggered by light of a specific wavelength.|$|E
25|$|<b>Photodynamic</b> {{compounds}} are {{activated by}} sunlight, which excites {{them to a}} higher energy state. They immediately release the excess energy and transfer it to the surrounding acceptor molecules, such as enzymes or free radicals. These molecules are thus activated and cause the skin reaction.|$|E
25|$|Photosensitivity {{reactions}} {{are characterized by}} severe {{inflammation of the skin}} with depigmentation and ulceration. In some cases (Type I), pigments are excreted through urine or deposited in hard tissues such as bones and teeth, causing discolouration. Affected animals should be protected from direct sunlight until the <b>photodynamic</b> compounds have been completely eliminated from the body or the appropriate treatments have been given.|$|E
25|$|For {{low-risk}} disease, {{radiation therapy}} (external beam radiotherapy or brachytherapy), topical chemotherapy (imiquimod or 5-fluorouracil) and cryotherapy (freezing the cancer off) can provide adequate {{control of the}} disease; all of them, however, may have lower overall cure rates than certain type of surgery. Other modalities of treatment such as <b>photodynamic</b> therapy, topical chemotherapy, electrodesiccation and curettage {{can be found in}} the discussions of basal-cell carcinoma and squamous-cell carcinoma.|$|E
25|$|Laser {{therapy is}} the use of high-intensity light to destroy tumor cells while {{affecting}} only the treated area. This is typically done if the cancer cannot be removed by surgery. The relief of a blockage can help with pain and difficulty swallowing. <b>Photodynamic</b> therapy, a type of laser therapy, involves the use of drugs that are absorbed by cancer cells; when exposed to a special light, the drugs become active and destroy the cancer cells.|$|E
25|$|While past cancer {{research}} has involved radiation therapy, <b>photodynamic</b> therapy {{is important to}} study because breakthroughs in treatments for tumor cells will give more options to patients with different conditions. Recent experiments using HeLa cells in {{cancer research}} involves {{the development of new}} photosensitizers with increased ability to be absorbed by cancer cells and still trigger cell death. It is also important that a new photosensitizer does not stay in the body {{for a long time to}} prevent unwanted cell damage.|$|E
25|$|Long-term {{complications}} of SEMS {{may be related}} to the underlying tumour being treated: the tumour may grow into the stent wall (tumour ingrowth) or over the end of the stent (tumour overgrowth), leading to obstruction. These complications may be limited by the use of coated stents. Tumour ingrowth or overgrowth can be additionally palliated by the placement of a second stent through the lumen of the first, through electrocautery or argon plasma coagulation of the tumour tissue in the stent, or through the use of <b>photodynamic</b> therapy.|$|E
25|$|Proton pump {{inhibitor}} {{drugs have}} not been proven to prevent esophageal cancer. Laser treatment is used in severe dysplasia, while overt malignancy may require surgery, radiation therapy, or systemic chemotherapy. Additionally, a recent five-year random-controlled trial has shown that <b>photodynamic</b> therapy using photofrin is statistically more effective in eliminating dysplastic growth areas than sole use of a proton pump inhibitor. There is presently no reliable way to determine which patients with Barrett esophagus {{will go on to}} develop esophageal cancer, although a recent study found the detection of three different genetic abnormalities was associated with as much as a 79% chance of developing cancer in six years.|$|E
500|$|Light {{therapy is}} a {{treatment}} method that involves delivering certain specific wavelengths {{of light to}} an area of skin affected by acne. Both regular and laser light have been used. [...] When regular light is used immediately following {{the application of a}} sensitizing substance to the skin such as aminolevulinic acid or methyl aminolevulinate, the treatment is referred to as <b>photodynamic</b> therapy (PDT). PDT has the most supporting evidence of all light therapies. Many different types of nonablative lasers (i.e., lasers that do not vaporize the top layer of the skin but rather induce a physiologic response in the skin from the light) have been used to treat acne, including those that use infrared wavelengths of light. Ablative lasers (such as CO2 and fractional types) have also been used to treat active acne and its scars. When ablative lasers are used, the treatment {{is often referred to as}} laser resurfacing because, as mentioned previously, the entire upper layers of the skin are vaporized. Ablative lasers are associated with higher rates of adverse effects compared with nonablative lasers, with examples being postinflammatory hyperpigmentation, persistent facial redness, and persistent pain. Physiologically, certain wavelengths of light, used with or without accompanying topical chemicals, are thought to kill bacteria and decrease the size and activity of the glands that produce sebum. [...] As of 2012, evidence for various light therapies was insufficient to recommend them for routine use. Disadvantages of light therapy can include its cost, the need for multiple visits, time required to complete the procedure(s), and pain associated with some of the treatment modalities. [...] Various light therapies appear to provide a short-term benefit, but data for long-term outcomes, and for outcomes in those with severe acne, are sparse; it may have a role for individuals whose acne has been resistant to topical medications. Typical side effects include skin peeling, temporary reddening of the skin, swelling, and postinflammatory hyperpigmentation.|$|E

2500|$|Type III (aka hepatic {{photosensitivity}}) is {{the most}} common type of photosensitivity reaction seen in animals. [...] In this type, the <b>photodynamic</b> substance is phylloerythrin, a derivative of chlorophyll produced in the body. [...] Normally, phylloerythrin is secreted into the intestine by the biliary system and excreted through the feces. [...] In Type III Photosensitivity, damage to the biliary transport mechanism prevents the excretion of phylloerythrin, allowing the <b>photodynamic</b> substance to enter the circulatory system and accumulate under the skin. [...] This condition is exacerbated by the presence of hepatic parasites.|$|E
2500|$|Fullerenes {{have been}} {{extensively}} used for several biomedical applications including {{the design of}} high-performance MRI contrast agents, X-Ray imaging contrast agents, <b>photodynamic</b> therapy and drug and gene delivery, summarized in several comprehensive reviews.|$|E
2500|$|Silver ions {{have been}} shown to react with the thiol group in enzymes and {{inactivate}} them, leading to cell death. [...] These ions can inhibit oxidative enzymes such as yeast alcohol dehydrogenase. [...] Silver ions have also been shown to interact with DNA to enhance pyrimidine dimerization by the <b>photodynamic</b> reaction and possibly prevent DNA replication.|$|E

2500|$|Porphyrins {{have been}} {{evaluated}} {{in the context of}} <b>photodynamic</b> therapy since they strongly absorb light, which is then converted to energy and heat in the illuminated areas. This technique has been applied in macular degeneration using verteporfin. [...] Bacteria have been shown to produce porphyrins endogenously as byproducts in heme biosynthesis, and these can be used in phototherapy to treat bacterial infections, such as acne.|$|E
2500|$|Since {{prostate}} cancer is generally a multifocal disease, the traditional prostatectomy eliminates all local lesions {{by removing the}} entire prostate. However, it has been hypothesized that an [...] "index lesion" [...] might be responsible for disease progression. Therefore, focal therapy targeted towards the index lesion might effectively treat {{prostate cancer}} while preserving {{the remainder of the}} gland. Interventional radiologists have started to treat prostate cancer with minimally invasive therapies such as cryoablation, HIFU, radiofrequency ablation, and <b>photodynamic</b> therapy that permit focal therapy by utilizing image guidance. [...] These therapies are still in beginning or experimental stages; however, because they preserve tissue, they can potentially reduce adverse treatment outcomes such as impotence and incontinence. [...] A small prospective study published in European Urology in February 2015 assessed the focal treatment of index lesions with HIFU in patients with multifocal prostate cancer and found that the majority of men returned to baseline genitourinary function and 86% of men were free of clinically significant prostate cancer at one year. Small, nonrandomized cohort studies with a median range follow-up 17â€“47 months have shown that cryoablation, HIFU, and phototherapy are associated with low rates of adverse effects and early disease control rates of 83%-100% based on negative biopsies.|$|E
