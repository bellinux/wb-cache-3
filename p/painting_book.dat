She is depicted in one of the four well known endpapers of the Potter books, and was featured on a Christmas card for the Invalid Children's Aid Association. She became the principal character in an unpublished <b>painting</b> <b>book</b> describing the livestock at Hill Top, and appeared in Peter Rabbit's <b>Painting</b> <b>Book</b> and Tom Kitten's <b>Painting</b> <b>Book</b> before being given her own <b>painting</b> <b>book,</b> Jemima Puddle-Duck's <b>Painting</b> <b>Book</b> in 1925, composed grudgingly in response to public demand for yet another book.|$|E
5|$|Potter {{intended}} to follow Mrs. Tittlemouse with a tale about a pig {{in a large}} format book similar to the original Ginger and Pickles. On one occasion, she passed an hour sketching inside the pig sty at Hill Top while the pig nibbled at her boots. She abandoned the pig book after fruitless attempts to make progress on it, and, instead, occupied the winter of 191011 with supervising the production of Peter Rabbit's <b>Painting</b> <b>Book,</b> and the composition of The Tale of Timmy Tiptoes.|$|E

5|$|The {{book was}} hugely popular. Spinoff {{merchandise}} included a soft Jemima doll in bonnet and shawl, a Jemima <b>painting</b> <b>book</b> in 1925, and illustrated fabric placemats hand-fashioned by Potter and distributed to friends. Critically, {{the book is}} considered one of Potter's best. In 1971, the tale became a segment in the Royal Ballet film, The Tales of Beatrix Potter, and, in 1992, it was telecast as an episode on the animated BBC anthology series, The World of Peter Rabbit and Friends.|$|E
5|$|The <b>painting</b> <b>book</b> {{displays}} Potter's {{willingness to}} exploit the commercial possibilities of her characters and tales. The purchaser was alerted {{to the existence of}} other Potter books on the inside front cover and directed to a list of books on the back cover. Other merchandise included sets of linen or silk placemats painted by Potter for friends with an abridged text and 12 of the illustrations. In 1910, Potter patented a design for a soft toy duck based on her model of Jemima in a Paisley handkerchief shawl and bonnet. A soft Jemima doll was manufactured by J. I. Farnell of Acton.|$|E
25|$|Drafted in March 1940, Denis McLoughlin {{served with}} the Royal Artillery's 101st Light Anti-Aircraft (Ack-Ack) and Anti-Tank Regiment (later the 1st Armoured Brigade). He managed to {{practice}} his art by painting a rhino insignia on the regiment's vehicles and by painting at least 37 murals of different sizes in various military buildings. His unofficial position of regimental painter gained Denis much greater freedom than the common soldier and allowed him several opportunities to practice his art. In the beginning, he painted officer's portraits for 5/- each. Soon, however, a London publisher, Wells Gardner, Darton & Co., offered him work <b>painting</b> <b>book</b> covers {{at the rate of}} £5 each. The first of these covers was for Frank Gruber's Navy Colt which appeared in 1943. Other covers followed for Wells Gardner, Darton & Co. which eventually recommended McLoughlin to Boardman Books. Having no work, however, Boardman passed Denis on to Australian owned Kangaroo Books.|$|E
