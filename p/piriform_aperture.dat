40|$|SUMMARY: The sex {{determination}} of human skeletons {{is important in}} forensic and anthropological research. It {{can be carried out}} through qualitative or quantitative analysis of morphological parameters of dimorphism. The shape of the <b>piriform</b> <b>aperture</b> is one of the classic indicators of sexual dimorphism since it describes differences between males and females according to strong population-specific behavior. The {{purpose of this study was}} to analyze the presence of sexual dimorphism in the size of the <b>piriform</b> <b>aperture</b> and its relationship with individual skin color. We used 90 human skulls from the Collection of the Federal Universidad de Sao Paulo (UNIFESP), with registered data on sex, age and skin color (classified as white, black and brown). The dimensions studied were: height, upper width and lower width of <b>piriform</b> <b>aperture.</b> All dimensions were greater in males than females, however, only the <b>piriform</b> <b>aperture</b> height was found to be significant with p < 0. 01. By analyzing differences and grouping them according skin color, the <b>piriform</b> <b>aperture</b> height was found to be significantly higher (p < 0. 05) in white, black and brown males. In the group of black individuals skulls, we found significant differences in the upper width (p < 0. 05). The main differences, related to the <b>piriform</b> <b>aperture</b> height and the low influence of skin color in the presence of sexual dimorphism in the <b>piriform</b> <b>aperture</b> size, are in contrast with what has been reported in the literature and justify the revision of the classic indicators used for diagnosis of sex in specific populations.

40|$|Sexual {{dimorphism}} in {{the human}} craniofacial system is an important feature of intraspecific variation in recent and fossil humans. Although several studies have reported different morphological patterns of sexual dimorphism in different populations, this study searches for common morphological aspects related to functional anatomy of the respiratory apparatus. 3 D geometric morphometrics were {{used to test the}} hypothesis that due to higher daily energy expenditure and associated greater respiratory air consumption as well as differences in body composition, males should have absolutely and relatively greater air passages in the bony cranial airways than females. We measured 25 3 D landmarks in five populations (N = 212) of adult humans from different geographic regions. Male average cranial airways were larger in centroid sizes than female ones. Males tended to show relatively taller <b>piriform</b> <b>apertures</b> and, more consistently, relatively taller internal nasal cavities and choanae than females. Multivariate regressions and residual analysis further indicated that after standardizing to the same size, males still show relatively larger airway passages than females. Because the dimensions of the choanae are limiting factors for air transmission towards the noncranial part of the respiratory system, the identified sex-specific differences in cranial airways, possibly shared among human populations, may be linked with sex-specific differences in body size, composition, and energetics. These findings may be important to understanding trends in hominin facial evolution. © 2011 Wiley-Liss, Inc. Peer Reviewe...|$|R

40|$|Body: Rationale: Upper airway and nasal airflow {{resistance}} {{are significant}} in infancy, {{due to the}} fact that infants are nasal breathers in early life, and that obstructive nasal diseases are frequent at this age. Nasal flow resistance is closely determined by anatomy, which rapidly changes with growth. The goal of this study was to assess standardized measurements of the nasal cavity dimensions in the first 2 years of life. Methods: 34 head CT scans of infants aged 4. 13 ± 4. 08 months (range: 0. 07 to 19. 4, 17 male, 17 female) available in the Amiens University Hospital Dept. of Radiology database were retrospectively analyzed. Infants with craniofacial deformities were excluded. Images were 3 D reconstructed, axially oriented and the nasal cavity was segmented by density thresholding from nares to vocal cords. Surface areas of the <b>piriform</b> and choanal <b>apertures</b> were automatically computed in the coronal plane, in standardized positions based on bony reference points. Results:Piriform surface area measured (mean±SD) : 54. 3 ± 13. 8 mm 2 (range: 29. 1 - 83. 9), and was significantly correlated to age (R= 0. 59, p< 0. 001), and height (R= 0. 57, p< 0. 001). Choanal aperture surface area: 81. 3 ± 28. 1 mm 2 (range: 38. 0 – 164. 7), and was significantly correlated to age (R= 0. 74, p< 10 - 6), and height (R= 0. 71, p< 10 - 5). Conclusions: These data suggest that the nasal cavity anterior and posterior apertures grow rapidly during the first 2 years of life, and that their dimensions are closely correlated to age and height. Further investigation will focus on how the anatomic growth of the nasal cavity in early life affects airflow resistance...|$|R

Fifty-five Indian skulls from the Department of Anatomy CSM Medical University were examined. The 110 sides (left and right) of the skulls were analyzed by measuring the infraorbital foramina distances from infraorbital margin and the <b>piriform</b> <b>aperture</b> on both sides. The vertical and horizontal dimensions were also measured. All measurements were taken with a compass transferred to calipers and analyzed statistically.

Two hundred ninety-five skulls were used (590 sides), located in the Frankfurt Plane through a craniostat. The measurements were collected by two distinct operators, with a dry tip compass and carried to a caliper. The general mean obtained between the infraorbital foramen and the infraorbital margin was 6. 37 mm (± 1. 69 mm), with a mean of 6, 28 mm (± 1. 79 mm) on the right side and 6. 45 mm (± 1. 76 mm) on the left side.

The dissection should be within the subperichondrium plane to prevent injury to the overlying musculature and blood vessels of the nose. Elevation extended laterally to the nasomaxillary sutures and superiorly to the glabella. Retraction of the freed soft tissues allowed sharp incision to be made with a scalpel or with sharp periosteal elevators through the periosteum at the inferior edge of the nasal bones.

40|$|The {{inclusion}} of maxillary canines {{is a very}} common condition. The intraoral approach to the canine extraction can be buccal or palatal depending on {{the position of the}} tooth.

The aim of this article was to describe a novel transnasal endoscopically assisted approach for the extraction of high palatal/paranasal impacted canines. Thirty-seven maxillary canines have been extracted in 29 patients. The surgical approaches were buccal in 5 cases, palatal in 24 cases, and transnasal endoscopically assisted in 8 cases. Patients treated with the transnasal approach required the least amount of pain killers in the postoperative period, and the average of the operative time was shorter than that of the transoral extraction.

40|$|The Krapina facial remains are {{associated}} with the Neandertals based on a number of descriptive morphological traits, but the degree to which these fossils correspond to the morphology of other Neandertals has largely been assumed rather than explicitly examined. One reason initially was the dearth of an ontogenetic series of Neandertal nonadults. Since Gorjanović- Kramberger discovered Krapina over 100 years ago, additional Neandertal fossils in Israel, France, Belgium, Italy and Uzbekistan have been recovered. Here the Krapina remains are compared to a large ontogenetic series of Neandertal adults, subadults, juveniles and infants (n = 41). Growth trajectories of Neandertal lower facial traits are used to assess the absolute growth of traits at Krapina. Principal components analyses, done separately for the lower maxilla and mandible, demonstrate some relationships between Krapina fossils and other Neandertals based on multiple traits. The results demonstrate that, compared to other Neandertals, Krapina nonadults exhibit long palates, and adults exhibit both tall and short mandibular symphyses, thickened mandibular corpora, short to mid-range ascending rami and relatively long mandibles. The alveolar process and lower <b>piriform</b> <b>aperture</b> are within the range of other Neandertals.

40|$|INTRODUÇÃO: a deficiência {{transversal}} da maxila é caracterizada pela atresia maxilar, palato ogival, apinhamento e rotação dos dentes, além da mordida cruzada posterior (uni ou bilateral). O tratamento dos pacientes com esta deficiência consiste no alargamento das bases ósseas maxilares. Nos pacientes com maturidade esquelética, a expansão da maxila é obtida através de procedimentos ortocirúrgicos (conhecidos como expansão de maxila cirurgicamente assistida - EMCA) que podem gerar efeitos sobre a cavidade e sobre o septo nasal. OBJETIVO: avaliar o comportamento do septo nasal frente aos procedimentos de EMCA. METODOLOGIA: foram avaliadas radiografias cefalométricas em norma póstero-anterior e radiografias oclusais totais de maxila, obtidas pela técnica convencional e posteriormente digitalizadas, de 16 pacientes submetidos à EMCA pela técnica de osteotomia Le Fort I subtotal. As radiografias foram obtidas no período pré-operatório (inicial) e pós-operatório mediato ou ao final da expansão e foram digitalizadas e mensuradas utilizando o programa DIGORA. Foram medidas, ainda, as distâncias entre os dentes (caninos, primeiro pré-molares, segundo pré-molares, primeiros molares e segundos molares). RESULTADOS: após a análise estatística pode-se constatar o aumento das distâncias interdentárias e intermaxilares, além do aumento da largura da porção basal da abertura piriforme e das distâncias entre a parede lateral da porção basal da abertura piriforme e o septo nasal. CONCLUSÃO: a EMCA é um procedimento eficaz, capaz de alargar a porção basal da abertura piriforme, que parece não influenciar no posicionamento do septo nasal. INTRODUCTION: Maxillary transversal deficiency {{is characterized}} by constricted maxillary arch, dental crowding and rotation, along with posterior uni or bilateral crossbite. The treatment of this deficiency {{is based on the}} widening of maxillary bone. In skeletal mature patients the maxillary expansion is achieved by means of surgical-orthodontic procedures (known as surgically assisted maxillary expansion - SAME) that can cause some effects on the nasal cavity and septum. AIM: To evaluate the behavior of the nasal septum after the procedures of SAME. METHODS: Post-anterior cephalometric and maxillary occlusal radiographs, taken by conventional technique and therefore digitalized, were analyzed from 16 patients undergone SAME. For all patients, the SAME technique consisted of subtotal Le Fort I osteotomy. The radiographs were taken before the surgical procedure, right after (mediate post-operatory time) or after the expansion, and thereafter digitalized and measured using DIGORA program. Also, the distances between teeth (canines, first premolars, second premolars, first molars and second molars) were registered. RESULTS: The statistical treatment showed an increase in interdental and intermaxillary distances, along with an increase in the width of the base of <b>piriform</b> <b>aperture</b> and in the distances between the base of lateral wall of the <b>piriform</b> <b>aperture</b> and nasal septum.

30|$|However, ASO {{also has}} adverse effects such as {{necrosis}} of the anterior fragment, {{increase of the}} nasal base width, counter-clockwise rotation of the nasal tip, tooth root cutting, and spasticity of the canine, cleavage of the osteotomy segment, and discordance between the canine and the occlusal plane of the premolar tooth [35]. Several approaches have been attempted to overcome these limitations. Since the introduction of maxillary ASO by Cohn-stock in 1921, it has been performed using three methods in general, namely the Wassmund method, the Wunderer method, and the Cupar and Epker method [36]. The surgical method {{used in the present}} study was a modified Wassmund method (Lee’s method). After the placement of labial vertical incisions in the region of the premolars on both sides and a vertical incision in the median segment, tunneling was performed, followed by the osteotomy from both premolar regions up to the <b>piriform</b> <b>aperture.</b> Horizontal osteotomy was performed via a palatal approach through the region of the labial osteotomy. In particular, since it was difficult to access to the center of the labial segment via the conventional Wassmund method, we placed a labial vertical incision in the maxillary median segment to facilitate access, and blood supply to the labial and palatal mucosa was maintained. Through these methods, avascular necrosis of the segmental osteotomy region was prevented.|$|E

The other methods, all derived by a process of regression calculations, were shown to perform with variable accuracy on this sample, despite the age range and ethnicity of this sample closely resembling that of the samples from which these methods were derived...|$|E
40|$|The cranial airways are in {{the center}} of the human face. Therefore {{variation}} in the size and shape of these central craniofacial structures could have important consequences for the surrounding midfacial morphology during development and evolution. Yet such interactions are unclear because one school of thought, based on experimental and developmental evidence, suggests a relative independence (modularity) of these two facial compartments, whereas another one assumes tight morphological integration. This study uses geometric morphometrics of modern humans (N = 263) and 40 three-dimensional-landmarks of the skeletal nasopharynx and nasal cavity and outer midfacial skeleton to analyze these questions in terms of modularity. The sizes of all facial compartments were all strongly correlated. Shape integration was high between the cranial airways and the outer midfacial skeleton and between the latter and the anterior airway openings (skeletal regions close to and including <b>piriform</b> <b>aperture).</b> However, no shape integration was detected between outer midface and posterior airway openings (nasopharynx and choanae). Similarly, no integration was detected between posterior and anterior airway openings. This may reflect functional modularization of nasal cavity compartments related to respiratory physiology and differential developmental interactions with the face. Airway size likely relates to the energetics of the organism, whereas airways shape might be more indicative of respiratory physiology and climate. Although this hypothesis should be addressed in future steps, here we suggest that selection on morphofunctional characteristics of the cranial airways could have cascading effects for the variation, development, and evolution of the human face. © 2013 Wiley PeriodicalsPeer Reviewe...|$|E
40|$|Background: Anterior {{segmental}} osteotomy {{has become}} an established surgical technique to achieve functional occlusion and improve the facial profile {{in the treatment of}} maxillary protrusion. Postoperative nasal changes, however, are somewhat unpredictable. The here presented subapical anterior maxillary segmental osteotomy has been developed to avoid such unintended nasal changes. Patients and Methods: Thirty-two patients (29 women and 3 men; age range, 18 - 40 y; mean age, 22 y) with maxillary protrusion underwent subapical anterior maxillary segmental osteotomy. A horizontal osteotomy was carried out between the apices of the anterior teeth and the <b>piriform</b> <b>aperture,</b> maintaining a distance of approximately 2 to 3 mm to the apices. Lateral to both canines, this horizontal osteotomy was connected with vertical osteotomies carried out along the alveolar socket of the first premolar on the right and left sides. Lateral cephalograms and lateral and en face photographs were taken preoperatively and postoperatively for analysis. All patients were followed up for at least 6 months. Results: Significant changes were observed in hard tissue parameters except the anterior nasal spine. The nasal tip, the alar base, and the lip width remain to have no significant change. The ratio of the upper lip to the maxillary incisor retraction was 0. 64 : 1. Whereas both the nasolabial angle and the philtrum length were significantly increased, the protrusion of the upper incisors and the vermilion length presented decreased. The intraoperative and postoperative courses were uneventful during the entire follow-up period. Conclusions: Subapical anterior maxillary segmental osteotomy provides a suitable option in the treatment of maxillary protrusion. It provides improvement of the aesthetic profile without nasal changes. © 2010 by Mutaz B. Habal, MD. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E
40|$|INTRODUCTION: The {{objective}} is to report a rare tumour of the sinonasal tract and conduct a literature review. Malignant triton tumour is a subtype of malignant schwannoma with rhabdomyoblastic differentiation. It is a very rare tumour, with only 15 reported cases involving the sinonasal region. PRESENTATION OF CASE: Forty-seven years old female presented with a right-sided epistaxis, progressive right sided nasal obstruction and anosmia and a visible mass in the right nasal cavity. Imaging studies showed a mass extending from the <b>piriform</b> <b>aperture</b> to the nasopharynx {{in contact with the}} dura and the orbital content. The mass was biopsied and the result was consistent with malignant triton tumour. The patient refused the surgery at first so chemotherapy with MAID protocol was started. After the fourth course of chemotherapy the treatment was stopped due to patient intolerance and a thrombosis of the jugular vein. Patient then underwent surgery with frontal craniotomy and dural excision, endoscopic control was done at the end to insure a complete removal. The patient received Radiotherapy in the postoperative period (56 Greys). At 5 years of follow up the patient is doing fine with no signs of recurrence and normal ophthalmological findings. DISCUSSION: Sixteen cases, including our case, have been reported to date in the literature. The mean age at presentation is 61 years. None of cases were associated with neurofibromatosis type 1. Eight patients were reported to be alive 5 years post-treatment, and 2 patients were reported to have died of the disease. The prognosis for triton tumours in the sinonasal tract is better than that for triton tumours in other locations. CONCLUSION: Malignant triton tumour is a rare malignancy of the sinonasal tract. Otolaryngologists should be aware of this disease. The optimal treatment should include radical resection of the tumour...|$|E
40|$|Distraction osteogenesis (DO) is a {{minimally}} invasive surgical technique to achieve skeletal expansion {{and has become}} the standard treatment method for many facial deformities. The technique offers unique clinical benefits, which include the possibility of large magnitudes of bone advancement, simultaneous soft-tissue histogenesis and decreased risk of damaging adjacent nerves and tooth buds. Furthermore, DO is less invasive compared to standard Orthognathic surgery, requires shorter operating time, and eliminates donor site morbidity. A limitation of DO is the lengthy treatment protocols. Additional information {{will allow us to}} develop strategies to improve {{the quantity and quality of}} bone formed during distraction osteogenesis of the maxilla. The clinical benefit will be to have improved healing with a shorter treatment time. The purpose of this study was to establish a porcine model for midface distraction, to study the DO biology of the maxilla and to document the sequence of bone formation in the distraction wound. Nine female Yucatan minipigs of mixed dentition were used in the study. All minipigs underwent bilateral maxillary DO under general anesthesia. A Le Fort I (LFI) osteotomy, modified by creation of a posterior vertical osteotomy between the molars rather than separation between the tuberosity and the pterygoid plates, was performed through a standard vestibular incision. A unidirectional, semiburied LFI distractor (Synthes Maxillofacial, Paoli, PA) was used. A protocol of 0 -day latency, 1 mm/day rate of distraction for 12 days, and 24 days of fixation was followed. To study the serial healing of the wound, maxillae (n= 9) were harvested at end-DO (n= 3), mid-fixation (n= 3) and end fixation (n= 3). These were examined clinically and radiographically. The harvested maxillae were divided in two (between the central incisors) and each of the specimens was further divided into 2 areas of interest (<b>piriform</b> <b>aperture,</b> zygomatic buttress) resulting in a total of 12 specimens at each time point. All harvested specimens (n= 36) were fixed, decalcified, divided in 2 (for coronal and sagittal examination) and embedded in paraffin. All the specimens were sectioned at 5 -μm intervals, mounted on fisher-frost slides, and stained with Hematoxyline/Eosin (H&E), TRAP (osteoclasts), collagen II (cartilage), CD 34 (endothelial cells) and PCNA (proliferating cells). Stained slides were examined with light and fluorescence microscopy and images at magnifications x 20, x 40 and x 100 and x 200 were taken. Computer histomorphometric analysis was performed using the H&E slides to determine percent surface area of fibrous tissue, proliferating cells, osteoblasts, vessels, mature and immature bone in all groups. In total, 648 photographs (n= 216 in each group) were analyzed. Statistical analysis was performed with the two-sample t-test. A porcine model of DO of the maxilla was developed and established. Animals tolerated the procedure, the distraction and consolidation period very well. There were no infections, and no distractors were removed prematurely. Bone formation at the end of fixation period was complete based on clinical, radiographic and histological examination in all specimens. At end-DO group, more cells were noticed close to the natural bone and in the centre of the regenerate. The position of fibrous tissue, new bone islands and cells was parallel to the vector of distraction. By the end of the distraction period there was active proliferation of pro-osteblasts and formation of bone trabeculae in continuation with the edges of the natural bone. At end fixation there was bony union across the gap with few areas of fibrous tissue. Fibrous tissue decreased sequentially in the end-DO, mid-fixation, and end-fixation groups. PCNA index and vessel density were higher at the end-DO group compared to mid-fixation and end-fixation groups. Osteoclasts were more prominent at the end-fixation group. No cartilaginous tissue was revealed in the regenerate with collagen II immunohistochemistry in any group. There was a significantly higher percentage of bone formation in periosteal versus non-periosteal regions at mid-DO and end-DO groups. The anterior half of the distraction wound appeared to have a higher percentage of bone formation than the posterior half in all groups. As with the mandibular wound, intramembranous bone formation seems to be the main mechanism in the maxillary DO: fibrous tissue formation and pro-osteoblast-osteoblast appearance, followed by progressive disappearance of the fibrous tissue and eventual replacement by bone. DO can be performed successfully in the maxilla with zero latency...|$|E
