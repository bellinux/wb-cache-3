40|$|Abstract. With the {{development}} of the economy, the positive influences of traditional beliefs on the biodiversity conservation have been ignoring and the traditional beliefs have been meeting the serious challenges since 80 ’s of the last century. At the same time, the biodiversity, dependent on the traditional beliefs, have been declining dramatically. From 2008 to 2009, we adopted the main research methods such as semi-structured interviews and structured interviews, collection and analysis of historical and literature, and <b>picture</b> <b>recording</b> in Dalai Lake Biosphere Reserve to carry out the research on the relationship between the biodiversity conservation and the traditional beliefs of the native people in Dalai Lake Biosphere Reserve. The results revealed that the traditional beliefs, the traditional practices and the traditional ecological knowledge have the positive influences on biodiversity conservation. Around the Dalai Lake area, most of the native people belong to the Barga-Mongolian. Most of them have the traditional beliefs of the Shamanism and Lamaism. Before the 80 ’s of the last century they led the nomadic life harmoniously.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} a newly developed measuring {{system based on}} Digital Speckle Pattern Interferometry (DSPI) that provides a field of strain data with high accuracy. An all-fiber optic arrangement has been designed yielding a small-sized, convenient device. The work aimed for sensitivity and resolution comparable with common strain gauges. Pure in-plane sensitivity of the speckle pattern is achieved by dual-beam illumination. Two such dual-beam interferometers are put together to provide strain in orthogonal directions. To avoid any mechanical components in the measuring head, two laser diodes have been chosen as switchable light sources and are directly connected to the interferometer by a fiber pigtail. Beam splitting and phase shifting equipment is integrated into the fiber optics as well so that miniaturization becomes possible. A small CCD camera is added {{to pick up the}} speckle pattern of the laser illuminated object. The measuring principle consists in the automatic evaluation of speckle correlation fringes obtained from two different states of loading. The paper explains the fringe evaluation by image processing algorithms especially designed for strain analysis. As a result, the plane strain tensor components E sub xx, E sub xy, E sub yy are calculated for each of the 512 x 512 picture elements. The evaluation takes 3 minutes from the <b>picture</b> <b>recording</b> to the presentation of results. Using this strain tensor data, other mechanical quantities, such as principal strain and stress, can be easyly derived. Measurable strain depends on the object size and ranges between 10 and 800 myE for an area of 10 x 10 qmm for example. A stepby-step loading procedure allows to measure strain values as high as desired...|$|E

40|$|Analysis of X-ray Images {{processing}} Film was {{the original}} recording medium used for recording X-ray images. It was then replaced by a film-foil system. Digital recording systems are currently replacing the film systems throughout the Czech Republic. The manufacturers of X-ray equipment are actively promoting this conversion. In sharp contrast with other branches of technology, {{the basic principles of}} X-ray technology have not changed much since its invention more than 100 years ago. It is possible to scan a digital recording directly by using large screen detectors or indirectly with the help of recording foils. The archival system is also an integral part. Digital X-rays have many advantages. Among them are: high quality pictures developed nearly instantaneously, the ability to immediately check them, the possibility of adjusting them afterwards, the possibility of archiving them, the possibility of transferring the data through a computer network, lower operating cost (provided the archiving is digital only) and sequencing. The disadvantages are the initial cost of acquisition and the added expense of archiving if the records are maintained in film form {{as well as on the}} server. The direct digitalizing of an X-ray picture is based on recording the picture with the help of scanning detectors. Flat panel detectors which transform a picture originated by X-ray exposure directly onto a <b>picture</b> <b>recording,</b> are used for the detection. The indirect digitalizing of an X-ray picture is based on recording a picture on memory foils which are stored in special cassettes, similar in size and shape to the cassettes for film materials. After exposure the cassette is read into a digitalizer, which produces a similar digital recording. Photographic documentation is made and archived, almost always using the DICOM format which makes full compatibility possible on a worldwide basis. The foil is reusable and the recorded picture is deleted with intense light...|$|E

40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] Boston UniversityA {{method has}} been devised for {{determination}} of the hemorrhagic tendency in vivo. Cottonmouth moccasin snake venom (Agkistrodon piscivorus piscivorus) {{is used as a}} quantitative test to measure the petechial susceptibility of blood vessels in the cheek pouch and mesoappendix of the golden hamster (Mesocricetus auratus). The test has been applied under Nembutal anesthesia to more than 330 hamsters treated in groups of 10 or more with beta and gamma irradiations, the hemostatic agent Adrenosem, rutin, cortisone, calcium; free Ringer's solution, hyaluronidase, antihyaluronidase, and nor-epinephrine. As applied to the cheek pouch, the venom test consisted of the intrapouch injection of. 02 cc. of a standard test solution (0. 01 percent moccasin venom in mammalian Ringer's solution) by means of a Krogh-Keyes syringe pipette. Exact petechial counts were made at 30 -minute intervals for periods of 2 hours or less. The response to be expected in normal hamsters was established in a group of 50 animals. An average of 80 petechiae (standard deviation 36) formed within 1 hour following application of venom. Within 2 hours 150 or more petechial hemorrhages developed. This figure was therefore considered as the end-point value and used as a basis for comparison with experimental groups. As applied to the mesentery, the venom test consisted of irrigating the preparation with pre-heated venom for 25 seconds. Observations were made at 15 -minute intervals for a period of 1 hour. The end-point count in the mesoappendix of the normal hamster was established as 50 petechiae at 1 hour. The mechanism involved in petechial formation was studied by Kodachrome motion <b>picture</b> <b>recording</b> of the actual process at 900 magnifications. Erythrocytic extravasation occurred without apparent rupture of the vessel wall and ceased abruptly without platelet plug or fibrin clot formation. Petechiae occurred principally at venous junctions. The effect of snake venom was local and transitory, resolution of the hemorrhages usually being complete within 24 to 48 hours. Various vascular effects in addition to the hemorrhagic phenomenon were observed. Within 1 to 3 minutes after application of the venom, the erythrocytes appeared packed and swollen. This pre-petechiation phase was designated as the period of "beaded flow". An increase occurred in the numbers of leukocytes adhering to the venular endothelium. Also arteriolar vasoconstriction and vasomotion were often encountered. An increased bleeding tendency in x-irradiated hamsters was shown by the moccasin venom test. At 5 days after total body x-irradiation with 1200 r, an average of 117 petechiae (standard deviation 30) were counted in the cheek pouch within 1 hour. Increased petechial susceptibility was also demonstrated in the blood vessels of the mesoappendix after similar treatment with x-irradiation as shown by an average of 92 petechiae (standard deviation 20) at 15 minutes following application of venom. No change in petechial susceptibility was detected on the 2 nd post-irradiation day. However, a marked increase in susceptibility was observed in hamsters in a near-terminal condition at 7 to 9 days following 1200 r total body x-irradiation. Petechial counts averaged 146 (standard deviation 5) at 1 hour. X-irradiation of the total cheek pouch with 500 r produced an immediate increase in petechial susceptibility, as indicated by an average of 145 hemorrhages at 1 hour (standard deviation 7). Dosages of 50 r delivered to the total pouch produced no significant immediate effects, but on the 2 nd day after irradiation petechial counts at 90 minutes averaged 129 {{with a standard deviation of}} 31. Intrapouch implantations of Sr 90 (141 microcurie bead; 24 to 48 hour exposure) and Co 60 (92 microcurie needle; 4 weeks exposure) resulted in an increased petechial response to topically applied moccasin venom. End-point counts were obtained within 45 minutes and 90 minutes respectively, following application of the venom. Adrenosem (1. 5 mg. intramuscularly) administered shortly before topical application of the snake venom test solution increased the resistance of cheek pouch and mesenteric blood vessels to the action of venom. Petechial counts in the cheek pouch averaged 72 (standard deviation 47) at 2 hours. Ten petechiae (standard deviation 3) were counted at 1 hour in the mesentery. Pre-irradiation treatment with Adrenosem effectively reduced the petechial susceptibility of the blood vessels of the cheek pouch to snake venom applied on the 5 th day after x-irradiation (lOOOr and 1200 r). An average of 48 hemorrhages (standard deviation 36) was recorded 2 hours after application of moccasin venom. The protective value of pre-irradiation treatment with Adrenosem was not as great in the mesentery. Petechial counts averaged 89 (standard deviation 8) 1 hour after application of the venom test solution. Treatment with 25 mg. of rutin before intrapouch administration of moccasin venom proved ineffectual in decreasing the petechial susceptibility of the blood vessels. At 2 hours the mean petechial value was 146 with a standard deviation of 8. However, rutin gave protection against hemorrhaging when administered prior to total body x-irradiation with 1200 r as demonstrated in hamsters tested with moccasin venom solution on the 5 th post-irradiation day. The average count at 1 hour was 83 petechiae (standard deviation 17). This response was essentially the same as that determined for the non-irradiated control group, although significantly lower than the mean value obtained at 1 hour in unprotected irradiated animals. The effect of prolonged treatment with cortisone upon the petechial susceptibility of blood vessels in the cheek pouch was studied. Ten daily injections of cortisone acetate (5 mg. subcutaneously) were administered before intrapouch application of the snake venom test. The petechial response did not differ materially from that of the control group. Average petechial counts of 147 (standard deviation 9) were recorded at 2 hours. No demonstrable modification occurred in the resistance of cheek pouch blood vessels in hamsters treated with calcium-free mammalian Ringer's solution. Intrapouch and intravenous injections of this solution alone were almost wholly ineffective in eliciting a petechial response as indicated by average 2 -hour counts of 1. 7 (standard deviation 2. 4) and 5 (standard deviation 2) respectively. Intrapouch injection of calcium-free Ringer's solution and moccasin venom combined, resulted in the formation of 140 petechiae (standard deviation 12) in 2 hours. A similar response was also observed in animals which were treated with intravenously administered calcium-free Ringer's solution and intrapouch injections of moccasin venom. The counts at 2 hours were comparable with those in the control group, averaging 146 petechiae (standard deviation 6). Topically-applied hyaluronidase (75 TR units) was ineffective in producing petechiae in the cheek pouch, but intra-pouch injection of a combination of only 7. 1 TR units of hyaluronidase and. 02 cc. of 0. 01 percent moccasin venom solution produced a marked increase in petechial formation. End-point counts of 150 or more petechiae were recorded at 1 hour in all 10 hamsters comprising this group. In the mesoappendix 75 TR units of hyaluronidase were only slightly effective. An average petechial count of 7 (standard deviation 3) was obtained at 1 hour. Three experimental antihyaluronidase solutions (SN 40 -B; SC- 4892; SC- 5345, G. D. Searle, Inc.) produced no significant change in the petechial susceptibility of cheek pouch blood vessels as compared with the control group. Simultaneous intrapouch injections of nor-epinephrine (. 03 cc. of a. 001 percent solution) and the standard amount of the venom test solution produced an average of 14 S petechial hemorrhages (standard deviation 4) in 2 hours. Intravenous injection of a vasoconstrictor dose of norepinephrine produced a very significant increase in petechial formation. The mean petechial count at 1 hour was 108 (standard deviation 32). The effects of intramuscular and intravascular administrations of venom were also studied. Intramuscular (flank) injections of. 2 cc. of a concentrated solution of moccasin venom (1 percent) did not produce petechiae in the cheek pouch although arteriolar constriction and beaded flow were prevalent. Similar results were obtained with intravascular administration of moccasin venom accomplished by cannulating the external maxillary artery and perfusing the cheek pouch with approximately 2 cc. of a 1 percent venom solution over a period of 2 hours...|$|E
