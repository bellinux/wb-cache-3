40|$|The {{location}} of a residential property in a city directly affects its market price. Each location represents different values in variables such as accessibility, neighbourhood, traffic, socio-economic level and proximity to green areas, among others. In addition, that location {{has an influence on}} the choice and on the offer <b>price</b> <b>of</b> each residential property. The development of artificial intelligence, allows us to use alternative tools to the traditional methods of econometric modelling. This has led us to conduct a study of the residential property market in the city of Valencia (Spain). In this study, we will attempt to explain the aspects that determine the demand for housing and the behaviour <b>of</b> <b>prices</b> in the urban space. We used an artificial neutral network as a price forecasting tool, since this system shows a considerable improvement in the accuracy of ratings over traditional models. With the help of this system, we attempted to quantify the impact on residential property <b>prices</b> <b>of</b> <b>issues</b> such as accessibility, level of service standards of public utilities, quality of urban planning, environmental surroundings and other locational aspects. ...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{develops}} a formal {{model of the}} timing and <b>pricing</b> <b>of</b> new equity <b>issues,</b> assuming that managers are better informed than new investors {{about the quality of}} the firm. Firms will prefer to issue equity when the market is most informed {{about the quality of the}} firm. This implies that equity issues tend to follow information releases, such as earnings announcements. The model also predicts a relation between the timing and <b>pricing</b> <b>of</b> equity <b>issues.</b> The <b>price</b> drop at the time <b>of</b> the equity <b>issue</b> announcement should increase in the time since the last information release, and the price drop at issue should increase with the time since the last information release or issue announcement. We test the predictions of the theory on a sample of NYSE, AMEX and OTC firms who issued equity over the period 1978 - 1983. We find evidence that there is a clustering <b>of</b> equity <b>issues</b> following earnings announcements and annual reports, and also that the price drop at the time <b>of</b> the equity <b>issue</b> is increasing in the time since the announcement <b>of</b> the <b>issue.</b> ...|$|R

40|$|This article {{inquires}} {{into the}} factors that affect the <b>pricing</b> <b>of</b> new <b>issues</b> <b>of</b> corporate tax-exempt bonds backed by {{standby letter of credit}} of U. S. and foreign commercial banks. Previous literature suggests that U. S. banks possess superior certifying ability in this market due to their unique access to low-cost private information. This article also examines the extent to which such information is priced by the market. The results indicate that <b>pricing</b> <b>of</b> these bonds depends primarily {{on the quality of the}} commercial bank issuing the standby letter of credit irrespective of where the bank is domiciled. The quality influence on yield occurs indirectly through its significant effect on the issue’s bond rating (JEL G 21) ...|$|R
40|$|This paper shows, using a {{standard}} CAPM model <b>of</b> security <b>prices</b> {{in a world}} market, that even small countries can affect the <b>price</b> <b>of</b> domestically <b>issued</b> risky securities, while large countries can affect the <b>prices</b> <b>of</b> all securities. As a result, countries have the incentive to set tax rates such that in equilibrium investors specialize in domestic securities, and net capital flows between countries are restricted. Each country does this to increase the utility of domestic residents, taking as given the tax policies of other governments, but the net outcome is a reduction in world efficiency and likely {{a reduction in the}} utility of all individuals. ...|$|R

Some war events that are generally considered crucial are clearly reflected in government bond prices.

This suggests that the popularity of Treasury bonds directly a. ects their value. ...|$|R
