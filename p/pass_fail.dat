40|$|Research into mental {{toughness}} {{has largely}} been confined to elite sport but should theoretically be important across other performance domains. We examined mental toughness in 161 first year sport students at a UK university using a self-report questionnaire (MTQ 48). A measure of achievement (year grade) and progression (<b>pass,</b> <b>fail,</b> or re-sit) was also obtained for each participant. Significant and positive correlations were found between total mental toughness, grades, and progression. Results suggest that the MTQ 48 may be a useful screening device to identify students at risk of failing and dropping out of their program.

40|$|Abstract—Ballistic {{test and}} {{evaluation}} of body armor is of great priority for the US Army to meet current operational needs. The current experimental design process centers on standardized threat level classifications and a baseline ballistic limit velocity, V 50; both measures originate from the National Institute of Justice circa 1979. The measures are complex, statistical in nature, and yield large quantities of data. A methodology incorporating response surface techniques improves ballistic test and evaluation from a <b>pass</b> <b>fail</b> analysis of data to iterative, directional experiments with design intelligence. Without this mathematical direction, {{it is extremely difficult}} to analyze the multitude of factors and their interaction effects in order to attain product improvement. We provide a ballistic experimental design example to demonstrate the usefulness of this methodology and identify the potential for its application in future armor developments...|$|E
40|$|Performance-based Maintenance Contracts (PBMCs) are {{increasingly}} being used for roadway maintenance {{as an alternative to}} method-based specifications. However, this technique is still relatively new and several issues have not been adequately addressed in the literature. The paper provides a systematic process for developing quality assurance measures to be used within these contracts. The process addresses key issues, including the development of performance standards and targets, a method for monitoring the roadside performance, and a methodology for developing pay adjustment factors. The developed performance standards presented in the paper are easily measured and assigned grades of <b>pass,</b> <b>fail,</b> or not applicable. The required sample size {{is a function of the}} project characteristics, including performance variability along the project, required confidence level, and allowable tolerance. Finally, the pay adjustment curves are a function of the initial project LOS, the target LOS, and the maintenance cost to achieve the target LOS...|$|E

40|$|The {{predictive}} validities of the DLR - {{ab initio}} controller selection for EUROCONTROL were determined. Criteria of training success (<b>pass</b> <b>fail,</b> instructor ratings, written, oral, and practical exams) {{were obtained from}} the Institute of Air Navigation Services (IANS) in Luxembourg and the Upper Area Control Centre (UAC) in Maastricht (NL). Based on the successful validation of essentially the same battery for the national DFS Deutsche Flugsicherung GmbH it was expected that the failure rate would drop significantly below 40 %. However, for the first 5 years of cooperation the overall failure rate remained at 42 %. Multiple regression analyses revealed that the battery was quite successful to predict training outcome at a late training phase (pass/fail and instructor ratings at UAC), but failed to predict outcome at the earlier IANS phases.

40|$|A {{technique}} is demonstrated for accelerated stress corrosion testing of high strength aluminum alloys. The method offers better precision and shorter exposure times than traditional <b>pass</b> <b>fail</b> procedures. The approach uses data from tension tests performed on replicate groups of smooth specimens after various lengths {{of exposure to}} static stress. The breaking strength measures degradation in the test specimen load carrying ability due to the environmental attack. Analysis of breaking load data by extreme value statistics enables the calculation of survival probabilities and a statistically defined threshold stress applicable to the specific test conditions. A fracture mechanics model is given which quantifies depth of attack in the stress corroded specimen by an effective flaw size calculated from the breaking stress and the material strength and fracture toughness properties. Comparisons are made with experimental results from three tempers of 7075 alloy plate tested by the breaking load method and by traditional tests of statistically loaded smooth tension bars and conventional precracked specimens...|$|E
40|$|Objective: Transition {{from further}} to higher {{education}} is typically reported as stressful and requiring psychological adjustment. One important trait linked to better coping and successful outcomes across performance domains is mental toughness (MT). We aimed to test relationships between MT, achievement, and progression in first-year University students. Design: MT was measured using the Mental Toughness Questionnaire 48 (MTQ 48). Results for academic achievement (end of year grade), and progression (<b>pass,</b> <b>fail,</b> or re-sit) were obtained from University records. Pearson correlations were conducted between total MT, achievement, and progression. Linear regression tested relations between MT subscales and achievement, while two-way ANOVA tested for gender differences in MT, and between students who passed, failed, or had to re-sit. Methods: First-year sports students (n = 161) at a UK University completed the MTQ 48 and gave permission for data to be used concerning academic results. Ethical approval {{was obtained from the}} University. Results: Total MT and achievement were significantly and positively related (r =. 31, p <. 01).

40|$|Two {{datasets}} {{of points}} of known spatial positions and an associated absorbed dose value are often compared for quality assurance purposes in External Beam Radiation Therapy (EBRT). Some problems usually arise regarding the <b>pass</b> <b>fail</b> criterion to accept both datasets as {{close enough for}} practical purposes. Instances {{of this kind of}} comparisons are fluence or dose checks for intensity modulated radiation therapy, modelling of a treatment unit in a treatment planning system, and so forth. The gamma index is a figure of merit that can be obtained from both datasets; it is widely used, as well as other indices, as part of a comparison procedure. However, it is recognized that false negatives may take place (there are acceptable cases where a certain number of points do not pass the test) due in part to computation and experimental uncertainty. This work utilizes mathematical methods to analyse comparisons, so that uncertainty can be taken into account. Therefore, false rejections due to uncertainty do not take place and {{there is no need to}} expand tolerances to take uncertainty into account. The methods provided are based on the rules of uncertainty propagation and help obtain rigorous pass/fail criteria, based on experimental information...|$|E
