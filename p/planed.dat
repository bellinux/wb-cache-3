5|$|Medieval {{construction}} was seasonal, work on site being undertaken {{only in the}} spring and summer, when the light was good and the weather more reliable. Each autumn, all exposed surfaces were covered and lagged against frost damage. The architects worked over winter in the tracing house (that of York has both a fireplace and a privy) to prepare designs for the next season's campaign. They translated the designs into sets of <b>planed</b> oak cross-sectional templates, which were given to the stone-cutters. Construction of cathedrals and major churches almost invariably started at the eastern arm, and then proceeded westwards, with towers erected last.|$|E
5|$|Most of {{the early}} {{industrial}} development in Minneapolis was tied to St. Anthony Falls and the power it provided. Between 1848 and 1887, Minneapolis {{led the nation in}} sawmilling. In 1856, the mills produced 12 million board feet (28,000 m³) of lumber. That total had risen to about 91,000,000 board feet (215,000 m³) in 1869, and 960,000,000 board feet (2,270,000 m³) in 1899. During the peak of this activity, at least 13 sawmills were operating on the falls. The sawmills also supported related industries such as mills that <b>planed</b> and smoothed the lumber; factories that built sashes, doors, and windows; and manufacturers of shingles and wooden buckets.|$|E
25|$|A small tablet, not fluted, of Pacific {{rosewood}} (Orliac 2005), 22 × 6.8 × 1.8cm. One end is chipped off, but no glyphs are missing. However, {{there appears}} to have been reworking, with the glyphs of line r5 <b>planed</b> off and the adjacent line v1 cut into the <b>planed</b> edge. Fischer also notes underlying hair-line glyphs which suggest to him that K may be a palimpsest. The later, deeper cuts may have been made with a steel blade. These glyphs are rather crude, of about the quality of side b of Echancrée.|$|E

It opens into a central hall with a stone wall {{on the north side}} and a partition wall and enclosed staircase to the basement and attic on the south.

There is a large living room to the north, and two smaller rooms to the south.|$|E
25|$|The grain {{direction}} {{can be determined}} {{by looking at the}} edge or side of the work piece. Wood fibers can be seen running out to the surface that is being <b>planed.</b> When the fibers meet the work surface it looks like the point of an arrow that indicates the direction. With some very figured and difficult woods, the grain runs in many directions and therefore working against the grain is inevitable. In this case, a very sharp and finely-set blade is required.|$|E

This bell can sometimes be muted, the mute being either detachable, or built into the instrument. The outside of the instrument can also be covered in leather, like the cornett.|$|E

25|$|While the Carpenters disdained {{industrial}} unionism, {{they were}} willing to accept mass production workers into their own union, albeit as second-class members. The Carpenters had fought with the Wood Workers union chartered by the AFL for decades, claiming that any workers who <b>planed</b> wood products that were subsequently used in construction, such as doors, sashes, mouldings and the like, were performing carpenters' work and must be brought within its union. While the Carpenters had never made similar claims on work performed by sawmill workers, much less tried to organize them, the union successfully insisted that the AFL assign the newly created Sawmill and Timber Workers’ Union to it in 1935. That forced marriage was not successful, as most of these workers soon bolted to form the International Woodworkers of America and to join the CIO several years later after a recognition strike.|$|E
25|$|Incumbent {{president}} Miloš Zeman {{is running}} for reelection. He {{is expected to be}} supported by Freedom and Direct Democracy and Dawn - National Coalition. Independent candidate Michal Horáček was considered his main rival in early 2017. The Social Democratic Party said it will hold a presidential primary in November 2017 to choose their candidate but finally they did not organize them. ANO 2011 also <b>planed</b> to hold a presidential primary but decided to not. It was speculated that both parties may select Zeman as their candidate, but ČSSD leader Bohuslav Sobotka announced that his party probably would not support Zeman due to his actions during the Czech government crisis in May 2017. It was reported that ČSSD planned to nominate Lubomír Zaorálek who decided to not run. Drahoš is running with the support of TOP 09, and the Christian and Democratic Union (KDU-ČSL) and Mayors and Independents are also expected to support his candidacy.|$|E
25|$|As {{the result}} of an 1879 article about the Confederate cent printed in a New York City newspaper, Benjamin F. Taylor, M.D. (Chief Coiner, New Orleans Mint, CSA) {{contacted}} coin dealer Ebenezer Mason. Taylor informed Mason of the existence of the Confederate half dollar and the die. Mason bought the die and coin from Taylor and sold them to J.W. Scott Co. of New York City, a coin and stamp dealer. Scott bought 500 1861 United States half dollars from a New York bank that were supposedly struck at the New Orleans Mint. Scott had the reverse of the half dollars <b>planed</b> down and performed a one-sided strike using the Confederate half dollar die. The Seated Liberty obverse of the coins were flattened some because of the one-sided strike. In addition, Scott struck 500 half dollar sized tokens in white metal using the Confederate die and a newly made die to commemorate the restrikes of the Confederate half dollars. The Confederate half dollar die went missing during the 1920s and has not been seen since.|$|E

500|$|The {{wooden panel}} {{measures}} 163by110centimetres(64by43inches) and {{is composed of}} five vertical deals (softwood planks) reinforced by two horizontal dovetail battens. The battens, together with the rough scrub <b>planed</b> back, have effectively reduced warping to a minimum and the artwork is well preserved, with only insignificant fissures and attacks by insects. [...] A dendrochronological examination of the panel by doctor Peter Klein at the Institute für Holzbiologie in Hamburg determined that it is made of pine deals (Pinus silvestris), the annual rings of which date from various periods ranging from the 1480s to around 1618. The painting can therefore date no further back than around 1620. This {{is consistent with the}} year 1636 given on the frame and mentioned in the parish accounts.|$|E
500|$|The {{airport was}} largely used {{to fly to}} Longyearbyen, {{although}} {{a limited number of}} flights [...] were undertaken to the mainland.

Services were originally operated by Ski- og Sjøfly, but were later taken over by Svalbard-Fly, both of which had their [...] Cessna 185 aircraft stationed in Ny-Ålesund. On 3 June 1970, a miner with a fractured skull was transported by ship from Longyearbyen to Ny-Ålesund and sent on board a Piper PA-31 Navajo to the mainland for treatment. After the telemetry station closed in 1974, the airport was taken over by Kings Bay. During this period, Longyearbyen was served by a <b>planed</b> section of tundra in Adventdalen.|$|E

500|$|Gradual {{improvement}} {{began to}} be made in the 1880s and 1890s; the later police barracks lost the title of [...] "fort" [...] and were professionally assembled, made from <b>planed</b> lumber, often prefabricated in the east, and fitted with modern technology and iron beds. Canteens, reading rooms and sporting facilities were introduced at the larger barracks. Nonetheless, living conditions on the prairies remained difficult and spartan, and mosquitoes, lice and bed bugs were major irritants. When the force deployed to the far north, the police were once again living in extremely basic conditions, in a very dangerous climate; a network of small shelters had to be built to protect units out on patrol, although these did not prevent the well-publicised deaths of the [...] "Lost Patrol" [...] of Inspector Francis Fitzgerald during the winter of 1910–11.|$|E
500|$|Mechanization was {{gradually}} introduced to make most {{aspects of the}} industry more efficient, particularly at Blaenau Ffestiniog where the Ordovician slate was less brittle than the Cambrian slate further north, and therefore easier to work by machine. The slate mill evolved between 1840 and 1860, powered by a single line shaft running along the building and bringing together operations such as sawing, planing and dressing. In 1859, John Whitehead Greaves invented the Greaves sawing table to produce blocks for the splitter, then in 1856 introduced a rotary machine to dress the split slate. The splitting of the blocks to produce roofing slates proved resistant to mechanization, and continued {{to be done with}} a mallet and chisel.
