40|$|<b>Potato</b> <b>granules</b> from {{different}} sources were found, on extrusion, to produce potato snacks of variable quality. In some instances strip formation was unsatisfactory, {{in other instances}} blistering of the snack occurred on frying. In total, about 20 - 25 batches of <b>potato</b> <b>granules</b> were examined and classified in relation to these two phenomena. The amylose/amylopectin ratios of these samples of <b>potato</b> <b>granules</b> were determined by the semi-micro potentiometric iodine titration technique, but {{it was found that}} there was no significant differences in the amylose/amylopectin ratio in relation to the extrusion behaviour of the granules. The determination of the amount of free starch present outside the <b>potato</b> <b>granules</b> also did not show any clear differences between the satisfactory and unsatisfactory <b>potato</b> <b>granules,</b> though the extract from the unsatisfactory <b>potato</b> <b>granules</b> tended to indicate that they contained more lipid than the satisfactory ones. The unsatisfactory <b>potato</b> <b>granules</b> yielded a higher amount of total extractable soluble starch than their satisfactory counterpart, for the same variety of <b>potato</b> <b>granules.</b> The amount of soluble starch increased on extrusion and it was also found {{to be related to the}} breaking strength of the extrudate and their blistering behaviour. A stronger strip which gave a higher amount of soluble starch possessed a greater tendency to blister. Addition of PSA additives to <b>potato</b> <b>granules</b> prior to extrusion increased the soluble starch content, but the degree of blistering was suppressed. Gel permeation chromatography experiments showed that the starches extracted from inside the <b>potato</b> <b>granules</b> consisted of mostly high molecular weight macromolecules (very similar to that of amylopectin) and a smaller quantity of low molecular weight macromolecules similar to amylose. The soluble starch extracted from the outside of <b>potato</b> <b>granules</b> also consisted of a greater amount of high molecular weight macromolecules whereas, after extrusion, a greater quantity of smaller molecular weight macromolecules was found to be present which presumably had been expressed from the granules and was assisting in forming the network, binding the <b>potato</b> <b>granules</b> together to form a coherent strip.

The model is used to help explain phenomena involved during hydration, gelatinisation, plasticisation, freezing, and morphogenesis. The new technique of scanning microfocus X-ray diffraction is used to study double helix orientation and the tilt of the lamellae.

40|$|It is {{well known}} from light {{microscope}} studies of potato starch that the granules formed in a constant environment (of light and temperature) have a ring formation indistinguishable fi'om that of granules formed under field conditions. Electron microscope studies have confirmed that normal potato starch granules have a fine shell structure not usually resolved by the light microscope, and also that shells do not develop in barley granules grown in a constant environment. The paper presented here reports a further study of the dependence of shell formation on environment. Potatoes were grown in a constant environment and starch granules from the newly formed tubers were examined in the light microscope, and in the electron microscope after corrosion by acid. No difference between these granules and normal granules was observed; both wide (light microscope) rings and fine lamellae developed in both granules. Parallel studies were made on wheat starch granules. In this case, shells were not differentiated in granules that developed in a constant environment, but they could be produced at will by imposing a dark period. Thus, shell formation in <b>potato</b> <b>granules</b> must be controlled by an endogenous rhythm, whereas in wheat granules it must be controlled by external environment...|$|E

Alternatively, two narrow size fractions of <b>potato</b> starch acetate <b>granules</b> were surface-peeled by chemical gelatinization in 5 M CaCl 2, and the remaining cores were analyzed for acetyl content at different peeling levels.

Î²-Cyclodextrin production was carried out using the purified CGTase enzyme from an alkaliphile Microbacterium terrae KNR 9 with different starches in raw as well as gelatinized form. Cyclodextrin production was confirmed using thin layer chromatography. Six different starch substrates, namely, soluble starch, potato starch, sago starch, corn starch, corn flour, and rice flour, were tested for CD production. Raw <b>potato</b> starch <b>granules</b> were found to be the best substrate giving 13. 46 [*]gm/L of cyclodextrins after 1 [*]h of incubation at 60 Â°C.

40|$|Starch is {{the main}} energy store of major {{agricultural}} crops such as corn, potato, rice and wheat. Various amylase type enzymes are used to convert cooked starch to glucose that goes into bioethanol fermentation. Only a few amylase type enzymes have been described that can act on the starch granule itself. Granular starch has a complex crystalline structure that prevents most amylases to directly act on it. In this PhD thesis the action of several amylases on native granular starch was studied in detail. From the wastewater treatment plant of a potato starch factory of AVEBE, a microbial strain specialized in the degradation of <b>potato</b> starch <b>granules</b> was isolated. This isolate possesses a multi domain amylase with several starch binding and fibronectin modules, enabling a rapid degradation of <b>potato</b> starch <b>granules.</b> Deletion of multiple domains resulted {{in a loss of}} the granule degrading capacity of this amylase. The modular organization was not found in an amylase obtained from a microbial strain living in a sea anemone from Jellyfish lake, Kakaban Island, Indonesia. This amylase showed very little activity towards granular starch, which is not surprising as this lake has no starch. The substrate for this amylase enzyme is very likely glycogen present in the sea anemone. These results demonstrate that starch granules are inert and require specialized amylase enzymes to be completely degraded. Such special amylase enzymes could be used in a non-cooking starch conversion process, reducing the amount of energy required in the production of glucose syrups for bioethanol fermentation...|$|R

The crystalline structure and birefringence were also affected. Moreover, the polymorphic transformation (B â A + B) could be related to dehydration, whereas the decrease in the degree of crystallinity might be resulted from the rupture of hydrogen bonds. Interestingly, amylose could act as the backbone of the aggregation structures of potato starch to provide resistance to HMT, but phosphate monoester could promote the destruction during HMT. In addition, compared with amylose, phosphate monoester played a more significant role in changing the average repeat distance of semi-crystalline lamellae (long period) during HMT...|$|R
40|$|Mechanistic {{relations}} between {{the evolution of the}} starch/flour structure, dough rheology and bread quality were investigated using the most common flours and starches in gluten-free bread-making. Micrographs showed that the small wheat starch granules filled the spaces of the big granules, forming a uniform starch-hydrocolloid matrix. This granular advantage decreased the consistency and increased the uniformity of wheat-starch based doughs throughout fermentation, as shown by micrographs and the higher critical strain. The viscoelastic properties of the different doughs strongly influenced the bread volume and the crumb texture. Thus, starch-based breads showed higher specific volume and lower hardness, especially those made with wheat starch, whose lower pasting temperature also reinforced the continuous phase of the crumb. On the other hand, the large <b>potato</b> starch <b>granules</b> did not form a continuous starch-hydrocolloid matrix, resulting in breads with the lowest specific volume, elasticity, cohesiveness and resilience, and the highest hardness...|$|R

The molecular, crystalline, and granular structures of native waxy maize, normal maize, high-amylose maize, and normal <b>potato</b> starch <b>granules</b> were monitored using SEC, XRD, DSC, and SEM. The amylose and amylopectin molecules of all four starches were hydrolyzed to smaller dextrins, with some having linear molecular structure. Neither the A- nor B-type crystallinity was resistant to enzyme hydrolysis. Starch crystallites with melting temperature above 120 Â°C appeared in waxy and normal maize starches after digestion, suggesting that the linear dextrins retrograded into thermally stable crystalline structure. These crystallites were also observed for high-amylose maize starch before and after digestion, contributing to its low enzyme digestibility. On the contrary, the enzyme-resistant granular structure of native normal potato starch was responsible for its low susceptibility to enzyme hydrolysis...|$|R

The surface weighted mean diameter[D(3, 2) ] of separated granules was in good agreement with predictions from Stokes 2 Ì 7 law of sedimentation. In vitro digestion of fractionated starches by alpha-amylase was well fitted by first-order kinetics, with the digestion rate coefficient (K) showing an inverse square relation with granule size, consistent with either a diffusion-controlled or surface-controlled mechanism. Apparent diffusion coefficients of alpha-amylase obtained by fitting the size dependence were 7. 40 (maize starch) and 1. 35 (potato starch) x 10 (- 10) cm(2) s(- 1) respectively. A correlation between K and specific granule surface area was also obtained for both starches, consistent with a role for surface area in controlling amylase digestion rates. Differences in K values are consistent with electron microscopy of partially digested granules, suggesting that an external surface-controlled mechanism may be operating for potato starch, and that the effective surface area of maize starch is greater than predicted from granule diameter due to surface pores and channels.

Storage stability of the radicals depended on the level of the granule destruction implying various ways of the radical annihilation. In addition, the kinetic data of the process are presented and the inter-radical transformations causing unexpected growth of the amount of thermally generated radicals at the initial stage of the starch storing are discussed...|$|R
40|$|The {{bacterium}} Microbacterium aurum strain B 8. A, originally {{isolated from}} a potato plant waste water facility, {{is able to}} degrade different types of starch granules. Here we report the characterization of an unusually large, multi-domain M. aurum B 8. A Î±-amylase enzyme (MaAmyA). MaAmyA is a 1417 amino acid protein with a predicted molecular mass of 148 kDa. Sequence analysis of MaAmyA shows that its catalytic core is a family GH 13 _ 32 Î±-amylase with the typical ABC domain structure, followed by a Fibronectin (FNIII) domain, two Carbohydrate Binding Modules (CBM 25) and another three FNIII domains. Recombinant expression and purification yielded an enzyme {{with the ability to}} degrade wheat and <b>potato</b> starch <b>granules</b> by introducing pores. Characterization of various truncated mutants of MaAmyA revealed a direct relation between the presence of CBM 25 domains and the ability of MaAmyA to form pores in starch granules, while the FNIII domains most likely function as stable linkers. At the C-terminus, MaAmyA carries a novel 300 aa domain which is uniquely associated with large multi-domain amylases; its function remains to be elucidated. We conclude that M. aurum B 8. A employs a novel multi-domain enzyme system to initiate degradation of starch granules via pore formation...|$|R
40|$|The {{microstructure}} {{of potato}} starch pastes and gels in the concentration range 5 - 10 % (w/w) was studied {{as a function}} of shear and heat treatment usi. ng light microscopy. Heating induced extensive swelling of <b>potato</b> starch <b>granules,</b> and the swollen granules filled the whole volume of the starch pastes that were subjected to a minimum of shear. The volume of the aqueous phase outside and {{in the center of the}} swollen granules is practically negligible compared to the volume occupied by the walls of the swollen granules. The granules with the lowest gelatinization temperatures swelled quickly without restrictions, so that less water was available for the leakage of amylose and for the swelling of the granules with higher gelatinization temperatures. The swelling and the contents of amylose and amylopectin differed between granules of different gelatinization temperatures. Shearing during heating altered the structure completely. The granules were broken down into fragments, and an extensive solubilization of the granules took place. Amylopectin, as well as amylose, was solubilized and formed a continuous phase containing dispersed fragments of granules. Demixing of amylose and amylopectin was observed within the phase of starch in macromolecular solution. The separation into amylopectin-rich and amylose-rich domains within the solubilized starch increased with the heating time...|$|R
40|$|The pulsed field {{gradient}} stimulated echo NMR {{technique is}} applied to the study of water diffusion in biological porous materials (a sheet of wood cellulose fibers and a packed bed of <b>potato</b> starch <b>granules)</b> consisting of randomly oriented domains with an anisotropic supermolecular organization. Expressions are presented for the probability distribution of apparent diffusion coefficients due to two- and three-dimensional powder distributions of domain orientations. The distributions are converted to echo attenuation curves with a method taking cross relaxation between the water and the solid matrix into account, Using a model in agreement with the structure and domain orientation known from other experimental techniques, it is found that the mean diffusion coefficient and degree of anisotropy (ratio between water diffusivity parallel and perpendicular to the structure director) at a level of hydration corresponding to approximately 90 %, relative humidity are (1. 68 +/- 0. 03) x 10 (- 11) m(2) /s and 6. 4 +/- 0. 9 for cellulose and (7. 8 +/- 0. 1) x 10 (- 12) m(2) /s and 2. 5 +/- 0. 3 for starch, respectively. A systematic examination of different models for the diffusion coefficient distribution shows that the chosen models are not unique in describing the data. For the estimation of anisotropy, a physically correct model is required. The average diffusion coefficient can be determined with any reasonable model. not necessarily physically correct...|$|R
40|$|A medium was {{developed}} to obtain maximum yields of extracellular amylase from Bacteroides amylophilus 70. Crude enzyme preparation, obtained by ammonium sulfate precipitation of cell-free broth, contained six amylolytic isoenzymes that were detected by isoelectric focusing and polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. One of these amylases was purified by diethylaminoethyl-Sephadex A- 50 ion-exchange chromatography and Sephadex G- 200 gel filtration techniques. Some properties of the purified extracellular alpha-amylase were: optimum pH, 6. 3; optimum temperature, 43 degrees C: PH stability range, 5. 8 to 7. 5; isoelectric point, pH 4. 6; molecular weight, 92, 000 (by sodium dodecyl sulfatedisc gel electrophoresis); and sugars causing inhibition, cyclomaltoheptaose, cyclomaltohexaose, and alpha-d-phenylglucoside. In addition, Ca 2 + and Co 2 + were strong activators,and Hg 2 + was a strong inhibitior; all other cations were slightly stimulatory. Dialysis against 0. 01 M ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid caused a 58 % loss of activity that was restored to 92 % of the original {{by the addition of}} 0. 04 M Ca 2 +. The enzyme affected a blue-value-reducing-value curve characteristic of alpha-type amylases. The relative rates of hydrolysis of amylose, soluble starch, amylopectin, and dextrin were 100, 97, 92, and 60 %, respectively; Michaelis constants for these substrates were 18. 2, 18. 7, 18. 2, and 16. 7 mumol of d-glucosidic bond/liter, respectively.

40|$|Starch {{granules}} both {{isolated from}} plants {{and used in}} foods or other products have typically been dried. Common food laboratory and industry practices include oven (heat), freeze, and ethanol (solvent-exchange) drying. Starch granules isolated from maize (A-type polymorph) and potato (B-type polymorph) were used to understand the effects of different dehydration methods on starch structure and in vitro digestion kinetics. Oven and ethanol drying do not significantly affect the digestion properties of starches compared with their counterparts {{that have never been}} dried. However, freeze-drying results in {{a significant increase in the}} digestion rate of potato starch but not maize starch. The structural and conformational changes of starch granules after drying were investigated at various length scales using scanning electron microscopy, confocal laser scanning microscopy, X-ray diffraction, FTIR spectroscopy, and NMR spectroscopy. Freeze-drying not only disrupts the surface morphology of <b>potato</b> starch <b>granules</b> (B-type polymorph), but also degrades both short- and long-range molecular order of the amylopectin, each of which can cause an increase in the digestion rate. In contrast to A-polymorphic starches, B-polymorphic starches are more disrupted by freeze-drying, with reductions of both short- and long-range molecular order. We propose that the low temperatures involved in freeze-drying compared with oven drying result in greater chain rigidity and lead to structural disorganization during water removal at both nanometer and micrometer length scales in B-type polymorphic starch granules, because of the different distribution of water within crystallites and the lack of pores and channels compared with A-type polymorphic starch granules...|$|R
