5000|$|The microplane {{constitutive}} model for damage in concrete evolved since 1984 {{through a series}} of progressively improved models labeled M0, M1, M2, ..., M7. It was also extended to fiber composites (woven or braided laminates), rock, jointed rock mass, clay, sand, foam and metal. The microplane model has been shown to allow close fits of the concrete test data for uniaxial, biaxial and triaxial loadings with <b>post-peak</b> softening, compression-tension load cycles, opening and mixed mode fractures, tension-shear and compression-shear failures, axial compression followed by torsion (i.e., the vertex effect) and fatigue. The loading rate effect and long-term aging creep of concrete have also been incorporated. Models M4 and M7 have been generalized to finite strain. The microplane model has been introduced into various commercial programs (ATENA, OOFEM, DIANA, SBETA,...) and large proprietary wavecodes (EPIC, PRONTO, MARS,...). Alternatively, it is often being used as the user's subroutine such as UMAT or VUMAT in ABAQUS.|$|E

Based on Hoek-Brown strength criterion and evolutional behavior of strength parameters, choosing major principal strain É 1 as strain softening parameter, this paper presents the method of solving <b>post-peak</b> stress-strain relationship. In numerical case, the <b>post-peak</b> stress-strain curves of some rock masses are obtained. The effect of evolutional law of strength parameters Ïc,m, s and a to <b>post-peak</b> stress-strain curve is discussed, and it's concluded that the greater the residual values of Ïc,m, s are and the smaller the residual value of a is; the greater the residual strength is and the <b>post-peak</b> stress-strain curve falls more gently...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Gradient-dependent {{plasticity}} where {{a characteristic}} length is involved into yield function is adopted {{to calculate the}} thickness of shear band (SB) {{and the distribution of}} plastic shear strain in SB. The characteristic length reflecting the heterogeneous extent of texture only controls SBâs thickness. The local plastic shear strain in SB is highly non-uniform. The total fracture energy is the sum of pre-peak and <b>post-peak</b> fracture energies. The pre-peak part is described by the nonlinear Scott model and depends on the height of specimen. The <b>post-peak</b> part is calculated through the derived <b>post-peak</b> relative stress-plastic deformation curve. If the inclination angle of SB is not influenced by the height, then the slope of <b>post-peak</b> relative stress-plastic deformation curve and the <b>post-peak</b> fracture energy are independent of the height. The total fracture energy is linearly size-dependent as the pre-peak fracture energy is linearly related to the height. The slope of <b>post-peak</b> relative stress-plastic deformation and the total fracture energy are verified through previous experiments for normal concrete in uniaxial compression...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: The {{deformation}} {{and failure}} process of four classes of double-layer rock plates were researched experimentally {{with the new}} loading device under concentrated load based on MTS-AE system. The force-displacement curves and the force-time-acoustic emission event rate curves were obtained through the experiments. The results showed that there were three failure modes of beam fracture, arch destruction and plate fracture damage in the upper plate of the double-layer rock plates; all the lower plates of the four classes of rock plates produced the beam fracture damage. There were four distinct mechanical response stages in the force-displacement curves; three types of mechanical behavior of the double-layer rock plates arose after the second load peak, which were <b>post-peak</b> yielding, <b>post-peak</b> hardening and <b>post-peak</b> softening; the bearing capacity of the double-layer rock plates is usually {{greater than that of}} the single-layer rock plate.

40|$|The {{complete}} stressâstrain {{characteristics of}} sandstone specimens were investigated {{in a series}} of quasi-static monotonic uniaxial compression tests. Strain patterns development during pre- and <b>post-peak</b> behaviours in specimens with different aspect ratios was also examined. Peak stress, <b>post-peak</b> portion of stressâstrain, brittleness, characteristics of progressive localisation and field strain patterns development were affected at different extents by specimen aspect ratio. Strain patterns of the rocks were obtained by applying three-dimensional (3 D) digital image correlation (DIC) technique. Unlike conventional strain measurement using strain gauges attached to specimen, 3 D DIC allowed not only measuring large strains, but more importantly, mapping the development of field strain throughout the compression test, i. e. in pre- and <b>post-peak</b> regimes. Field strain development in the surface of rock specimen suggests that strain starts localising progressively and develops at a lower rate in pre-peak regime. However, in <b>post-peak</b> regime, strains increase at different rates as local deformations take place at different extents in the vicinity and outside the localised zone. The extent of localised strains together with the rate of strain localisation is associated with the increase in rate of strength degradation. Strain localisation and local inelastic unloading outside the localised zone both feature <b>post-peak</b> regime...|$|E
40|$|Code {{procedures}} for the seismic design of reinforced concrete structures are increasingly incorporating performance-based criteria, with âpush-over â analyses becoming an accepted means of demonstrating sufficient energy-absorbing capacity. Hence, in concrete frame structures containing shear-critical structural elements, the <b>post-peak</b> load-deformation response of these members becomes of practical importance. A series of shear-critical beams was tested recently, patterned after the classic set of beams tested by Bresler and Scordelis forty years ago. In the current tests, particular {{attention was paid to}} capturing the <b>post-peak</b> response. The details and results of these beams are presented, providing data useful in testing and calibrating analytical procedures. Nonlinear finite element analyses were undertaken to determine current ability to accurately model <b>post-peak</b> ductility in shear-critical members. Results indicate that current procedures are of marginally acceptable accuracy, and that further developmental work is warranted. A case study, involving a large concrete frame structure built in a high seismic region and containing shear-deficient members, is discussed. This case underscores the importance of accurately calculating the <b>post-peak</b> ductility of shear-critical beams...|$|E
