40|$|While metacognitive mastery {{seems to}} be closely linked to general {{functioning}} in persons with psychosis, little is known of metacognitive capacity of family members, who often {{play an important role}} in recovery and often report high levels of distress. We gathered assessments of metacognitive mastery from persons with first-episode psychosis and their mothers. We found that relatively higher overall mean mastery levels among the dyads, was related to less negative caregiver experiences, and less caregiver criticism. Greater levels of mastery were related to decreased duration of untreated psychosis. Clinical implications in terms of family intervention <b>programmes</b> <b>repertoire</b> are discussed...|$|R

40|$|The {{politics}} and policies of late colonialism in the Portuguese empire {{were characterized by}} a repressive developmentalism, a particular combination of enhanced coercive (symbolic and material) repertoires of rule, programmed developmental strategies of political, economic and sociocultural change, and processes of engineering of socio-cultural differentiation. At its core, as Frederick Cooper noted, was a 'repressive version of the developmentalist colonial state. The late imperial and colonial states aimed to co-ordinate policies of imperial resilience {{in a context of}} widespread evolving colonial and international pressures which were contrary to their existence, or pressing for their substantial reform. 2 They were the institutional loci in which the entangled policies of repressive developmentalism evolved, in which there was a coalescence between idioms, <b>programmes,</b> and <b>repertoires</b> of colonial social control and coercion (for instance, the schemes of resettlement, civil and military, of the African population and the strategies of counter-insurgency) - related, but not reducible, to the colonial wars and to the militarization of colonial societies; idioms, <b>programmes,</b> and <b>repertoires</b> of colonial development and modernization (for instance, the developmental plans of the 1950 s and 1960 s); and idioms, projects, and repertoires of imperial and colonial social engineering (for instance, tllre indigennto regime or the nationalized version of the doctrine of welfare colonialism and its languages and programmes of native welfare and native social promotion) ...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{looks at}} the role of 'miscellany' in concert programmes. In The Great Transformation of Musical Taste, William Weber {{identifies}} the use of miscellany as an inclusive organizing principle for eighteenth-century European concert programmes. He goes on to discuss the shift {{that took place in}} the nineteenth century to more homogeneous and exclusive programmes. This paper investigates the ways in which the miscellany principle might be observed in community concert programmes in a colonial city. This study focuses on Newcastle, NSW, during a period of rapid immigration - the 1870 s. Through archival research, community concert programmes, newspaper reports and reviews from 1870 to 1879 are analyzed from the perspective of <b>programme</b> structure, <b>repertoire,</b> performers and function. In particular, there is a focus on the use of Weber's miscellany concept and its potential for building community through inclusivity. This was important for a transplanted community whose origins were a class-structured society that linked taste in music to social standing. This paper will show how, by using the older framework of miscellany and its inherent potential for compromise, collegiality and collaboration, the community could promote itself as thriving, respectable and democratic...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{illustrates}} {{the interaction of}} folk culture and popular culture in Newfoundland in the mid-twentieth century, mainly the 1930 s and 1940 s, through three case studies. One of these studies examines the occupational narratives of a man whose adult life was spent as an announcer on local and regional radio. These folklife narratives are interpreted {{in terms of the}} impression management of a local celebrity. [...] The second study focusses on a category of radio programme, the message programme, which {{played an important role in}} the conveyance of information in and among Newfoundland outport communities from the 1930 s to the 1960 s. In particular, the Gerald S. Doyle News Bulletin is examined in detail. This programme was influenced not only by the sensibilities of its creators and "gatekeepers," but also by its listeners. This led to its being a flexible form of folk communication. [...] The third study scrutinizes the radio serial, Irene B. Mellon, which was popular in and around St. John's from 1934 to 1941. This serial combined adventure fiction and regional music with much traditional context. In particular an annotative study of the <b>programme's</b> song <b>repertoire</b> is presented. [...] Together these studies display the array of materials available to the student of Newfoundland folklore and the mass media. Oral history, folklore, radio programming, archival materials and published sources are drawn together to provide the resource base for the thesis...|$|R
40|$|The {{practices}} of experimental and community group music are compared on {{a social and}} musical level. The similarities, differences and compatibility of these forms are explored through contextual analysis and personal reflection. The main themes assessed are {{in terms of the}} level of inclusivity and ‘freedom’ in the music itself and the socio-political background of each musical context. To assess this compatibility, I led four music groups for varying periods of time. Two of the groups I led would typically be classed as ‘community music’ groups’; one is an experimental music ensemble that is established in the field of contemporary music performance; and one is a 6 th form college music group that performs experimental and improvised music, and is aimed at all abilities. In each group a similar <b>programme</b> of <b>repertoire</b> was followed, primarily featuring four composers/practitioners in the experimental music tradition and supplemented by ideas from recognised community musicians The reflections of this programme are assessed in two segments. The first segment analyses the effect of community music leadership and models of behaviour on each group, and the second focuses primarily on the effect of the repertoire itself on promoting an inclusive, ‘community music-style’ ethos in the groups. The conclusions, based on both the contextual analysis and the personal reflections, are that the nature of a community musician is someone who places more weight on a positive approach to facilitation than on repertoire, but that a use of experimental music can help achieve an informal, facilitative leadership style. The socialist background and attitude of a community musician should inform their practice as much as a desire to increase inclusivity and participation. My own leadership style is similar to a typical, facilitative approach of a community musician and is based on mutuality between leader and group, which generally has a positive outcome in all groups, with a need to adapt and change as required...|$|R
40|$|This {{dissertation}} is {{the first}} study devoted solely {{to the history of}} an orchestral tradition in Christchurch. Within a timeframe stretching {{from the beginning of the}} local settlement to the establishment of the first “national” orchestra in 1939, it provides detailed portrayals of all facets of amateur and professional orchestral activity. This includes the histories of all orchestral bodies, their membership, a chronology of concerts, <b>repertoire,</b> <b>programme</b> structure and critical reception. This dissertation explains the advance of orchestral tradition that is at times tentative and at times bold, until it is securely entrenched as a mainstream musical activity in Christchurch. A preliminary narration, which begins in 1857, ends in 1906 with the International Exhibition. This is then discussed as a landmark event for orchestral music in Christchurch. A series of case studies for the period of 1908 to 1939, covers each of the five major orchestral groups that flourished in this period. The case studies also include the footprints of development, the “incidental” music performed by the cinema orchestras, and the “studio only” performances of many broadcasting groups. The role played by minor orchestral groups as an “alternative” music culture is included, along with the impact of orchestras associated with visiting opera companies. The final section is a detailed analysis of the <b>repertoire</b> and <b>programme</b> construction, and a discussion of the people who played an influential role in the development of an orchestral tradition. Numerous tables and illustrations are provided. A number of appendices are also attached: a chronology of orchestral concerts in Christchurch; some significant orchestra personnel lists; an extensive set of source readings discussing the formation of a permanent orchestra; a chronology of orchestral activity for a selection of Christchurch musicians; a timeline of visiting opera companies, and a selection of concert programmes...|$|R
40|$|In this thesis, I {{challenge}} assumptions underlying my {{discipline of}} enterprise architecture {{that led to}} two choices facing practitioners: either to work with tools and techniques which predict and control changes towards predetermined ends or to accept informal processes that are unpredictable and wasteful. Orthodox enterprise architecture defines an enterprise as an organisation, which is a system, and prescribes methods that seek to provide control over the transformation of an organisation into a desired state of affairs by achieving complete knowledge of the system before initiating the desired transformation. Drawing on complexity sciences, I offer a different perspective on organisation and claim that organising {{what we do is}} an aspect of doing what we do. Organising is process. I furthermore claim {{that the people who are}} organising what we do can act spontaneously and surprise both themselves and others, but often they act habitually. Habitual ways of acting allow us to anticipate to some extent how others are likely to respond to us and, as we grow up, we learn how to behave ourselves, that is, how to adjust our behaviour to what we judge socially acceptable to increase the likelihood of being able to garner support and collaboration. I posit that social control is exercised in this way as mutual self-adjustment that forms what is normal and valued conduct. In other words, our shared social norms and values thus paradoxically and simultaneously form individuals and their conduct and are formed by individuals and their conduct. I claim that in this way we have partial, but never full, knowledge of how others generally respond to certain behaviour of ours. We can ever have only partial knowledge of that which is???in the words of Mannheim???in the process of becoming. I therefore reject the central assumptions upon which orthodox enterprise architecture is based. In organisations, we engineer and exploit mechanical mechanisms that can conduct certain action more effectively and efficiently than people can. Materiality, objects in the world, can resist attempts to shape them to suit our needs but do so without intentionality or spontaneity. Accommodating material resistance is thus repeatable. Enterprise architecture as a discipline grew out of engineering of physical mechanisms and assumes a similar repeatability and predictability when working with the social, which I find to be an unwarranted assumption. I argue against the claim of orthodox enterprise architecture that we can bring about a pre-determined state in a controlled fashion and against the claim that without such control we have informal processes that are inevitably unpredictable and wasteful. I posit that what emerges is paradoxically stable instabilities of socially enabled and constrained recognisable patterns of behaviour. When devising a mechanism in a physical object, such as a software <b>programme,</b> a <b>repertoire</b> of scripted action is transcribed into it which remains constant until transcription is renewed. Transcription has a tendency to render action less fluid. Some members of an organisation may judge particular scripted action to be awkward or detrimental while others may judge the same scripted action to be efficient and beneficial. Thus, determining which scripted action to transcribe into mechanisms is a highly political decision which attracts the attention of skilful political players. Enterprise architects can have a valuable role to play, since we have a better than average partial knowledge about technology, and since technology is increasingly important for many enterprises. I posit that becoming more aware of power and power plays, developing a feel for the game, and becoming more detached about our involvement will allow us to play into what is emerging socially with more political awareness and expertise...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{the present}} study is the {{investigation}} of the learning strategies that young Muslim learners in Thrace employ in order to facilitate and enhance their learning in English as a foreign language. The experimental part of our study delineated the results of a large-scale research that was conducted with the 4 th, 5 th and 6 th grade EFL Muslim students of three Primary Schools in the prefecture of Xanthi (totally 68 students), aiming at the exploration of their language learning strategies on one hand, and at the examination of the influence of an Intervention Programme on the enrichment of learners’ repertoire of strategies, on the other. Data were elicited through the distribution of a questionnaire (based mainly on Oxford's SILL, with some modifications) to 300 Muslim students of Thrace. The variables under investigation were the learners' gender and age, the location of the schools, the possession of another foreign language and the proficiency level in English. The research was based on O’Malley and Chamot’s typology (1990), according to which learning strategies are classified into three main categories: 1) the metacognitive, 2) the cognitive and 3) the social/affective strategies. According to the research findings: 1) The girls employ more metacognitive and cognitive strategies than the boys, while no statistically significant differences between them were testified {{in the use of the}} social/affective strategies. 2) The learners who already possess another foreign language have been proved to use more metacognitive strategies, compared to their fellow students who do not, but no significant difference has emerged, as far the cognitive and the social/affective strategies are concerned. 3) The students who live in the urban area of Xanthi use more metacognitive and social/affective strategies, compared to the students of the rural areas. 4) The students of the 4 th, the 5 th and the 6 th Grade use equally often the metacognitive and the cognitive strategies; however, the students of the 5 th Grade seem to employ even more often the social/affective ones. 5) The learners of a higher proficiency level in English were found to possess the same strategy repertoire with the learners of a lower proficiency level. As far as the influential role of Intervention Programmes is concerned, it was found that, after the completion of the specific <b>Programme,</b> the learners’ <b>repertoire</b> of strategies was remarkably enriched, and their performance in English was improved. ...|$|R
