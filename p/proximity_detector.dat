For some years the technology had problems from lack of power and motor resonance. These problems were solved with the advent of rare-earth hybrid motors, high voltage micro-stepping drives and incremental encoder feedback. The robots calibrate themselves by driving each axis slowly to a target sensed by a <b>proximity</b> <b>detector.</b> Incremental optical encoders then track along with the motors to check for errors. This is called closed loop control which differs from servo control in that the stepping motors run essentially an open loop — the loop is only closed {{at the end of each}} movement of the arm.

The inputs to the Kohonen network are the analog output signals from eight infrared detectors arranged along a semi-circle {{on the front of the}} vehicle. By letting the network self-organise while a beacon is moved from one side to the other in front of the sensors a linear mapping of angles on neurons emerges. The mapping is robust against alignment errors, differences in sensitivity and even total failure of some sensors.

40|$|The Ohio State University radio{{telescope}} is {{the second}} largest radio telescope in the United States, equivalent in collecting area (2200 sq m) to a 175 -foot diameter dish. For the past 17 years it has been dedicated fulltime to SETI, {{and it is now}} being considered by NASA for selection as the NASA dedicated SETI observatory. The telescope was originally designed, optimized, and used as an all-sky survey instrument to create detailed maps and catalogs of the radio astronomical sky. For the SETI Program, some re-optimizations are required. Right ascension tracking for one to two hours (depending on the declination) was achieved by exploiting the exceptionally large f/d ratio of the telescope. The feed horns were mounted on a large moveable, rubber-tired cart which is capable of a total motion of 100 feet. The cart can carry many horns, making possible simultaneous observations at many sky directions and frequency ranges. Rapid declination movement and its automation will be accomplished through simplification of the existing braking system, and replacement of older mechanical sensors by modern electronic inclinometers and <b>proximity</b> <b>detectors.</b> Circular polarization capability will be achieved through {{an increase in the number}} of horizontal wires in the reflector mesh, or addition of a finer mesh on top of the existing one. The telescope has great inherent resistance to radio frequency interference, due to its ground-mounted feed horns and shielding by the large reflectors of half the horizon.

40|$|Abstract: We are {{developing}} a non-invasive procedure for measuring contractile responses of both adult and neonatal mam-malian cardiocytes. This method can be em-ployed to quantify pharmacological effects of drugs on myocytes. Methods for quantifying neonatal cell contraction reported in the lit-erature have required the use of elaborate equipment such as a <b>proximity</b> <b>detector</b> or an atomic force microscope (to measure the increase in cell elevation as a cardiocyte con-tracts), and typically interfere with simulta-neous optical recording of cell signals. Such contraction quantification methods are ex-pensive due to the equipment needed. Our approach to contractile measurement is be-ing developed with the goal to be a practical and relatively inexpensive method. Our approach uses two different image processing procedures {{that allow us to}} pro-duce contractility records of both adult and neonatal cardiocytes. In our first procedure we analyze neonatal myocytes. Contraction curves generated from neonatal cells with our new method exhibit a very similar pro-file and time course to those produced by more sophisticated and expensive methods [11, 15]. Our second image processing procedure is an application that allows measurement of the adult cardiocytes area in each frame. Application of our two dimensional quan-tification technique to the study of adult cardiocytes produces contraction vs. time records virtually identical in time course and shape to records obtained from traditional one dimensional, cell boundary tracking pro-cedures [12]. The contractility graphs created by the two image processing procedures are consis-tent with the expected results and graphs re-sulting from past studies performed on my-ocytes [10]. This new non-invasive approach to contractile quantification will be useful in the analysis of the myocyte contractile dy-namics in the presence of drugs...|$|E

The {{first is a}} set of sonars individually mounted on servo motors. These sensors ’ angular coverage allows for effective obstacle avoidance, but does not provide precise surface placement due to sonar’s well-understood conical response window. An inexpensive laser range finder based on a web camera and servo-mounted laser pointer provides a much more precise, but narrower, <b>proximity</b> <b>detector.</b> Taken together, this sensor suite cost less than $ 300, but demonstrated its considerable capabilities for reactive and deliberative spatial reasoning at the 2005 AAAI mobile robot scavenger hunt competition. Laptop-based robots offer powerful platforms for research and education at a price and maintainance level much lower than systems now in common use. Advantages of a laptop robot include a gentle learning curve in interacting with the software, the ability for students to program and use their own computers, and the capability to investigate topics on a physical agent that are less easily supported on other lowcost platforms. Also, any software, including OpenCV, Matlab, and other specialized packages, can be used onboard. We have been among the first to put laptop robots to a public test. The venue for this was the AAAI 2005 Scavenger Hunt Competition.

40|$|State-of-the-art {{smartphones}} and tablets {{have evolved}} {{to the level of}} having feature-rich applications comparable to those of interactive desktop programs, providing high- quality visual and auditory experiences. Furthermore, mobile processors are becoming increasingly complex in order to respond to this more diverse and demanding application base. Many mobile processors, such as the Qualcomm Snapdragon 800, have begun to include features such as multi-level data caches, complex branch prediction, and multi-core architectures. The high-performance mobile processor domain is unique in a number of ways. The mobile software ecosystem provides a central repository of robust applications that rely on device-specific framework libraries. These devices contain numerous sensors, such as accelerometers, GPS, and <b>proximity</b> <b>detectors.</b> They are always-on and always-connected, continuously communicating and updating information in the background, while also being used for periods of intensive computational tasks like playing video games or providing interactive navigation. The peak performance that is demanded of these devices rivals that of a high-performance desktop, while most of the time a much lower level of performance is required. Given this, heterogeneous processor topologies have been introduced to handle these large swings in performance demands. Additionally, these devices need to be compact and able to easily be carried on a person, so challenges exist in terms of area and heat dissipation. Given this, many of the microarchitectural hardware structures found in these mobile devices are often smaller or less complex than their desktop equivalents. This thesis develops a novel three-pronged optimization framework. First, the compiler-device interface is enhanced to allow more high-level application information to be relayed onto the device and underlying microarchitecture. Second, application-specific information is gleaned and used to optimize program execution. Lastly, the microarchitecture itself is augmented to dynamically detect and respond to changes in program execution patterns. The high-level goal of these three approaches is to extend the continuum of the heterogeneous processor topology and provide additional granularity to help deliver the necessary performance for the least amount of power during execution. The proposed optimization framework is shown to improve a broad range of structures, including branch prediction, instruction and data caches, and instruction pipeline...|$|R
