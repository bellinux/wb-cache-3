40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{ascertain}} the risk of non-melanocytic skin cancer (NMSC) in simultaneous pancreas kidney transplant recipients (SPKTRs) compared with kidney transplant recipients (KTRs) in relation to other potential risk factors of skin cancer. In a cohort study, 208 SPKTRs were compared with 1, 111 KTRs who were transplanted during the same time period. The effects of age, sex, country of origin, time period after transplantation, HLA matching, immunosuppressive regimen, and rejection treatments on the risk of NMSC were investigated in multivariable Cox's proportional hazard models. In SPKTRs, the incidence of NMSC increased from 19 to 36 %, respectively, 10 and 15 years after transplantation, which was significantly higher compared with that in KTRs (6 and 10 %, respectively). After adjustment for age and sex, SPKTRs had a 6. 2 (3. 0 – 12. 8) increased risk of squamous-cell carcinoma (SCC) compared with KTRs. An additional adjustment for maintenance immunosuppression decreased the hazard ratio to 3. 1 (1. 3, 7. 2), which indicates <b>partial</b> <b>confounding</b> by the immunosuppressive regimen. Adjustment for induction and rejection therapy or HLA mismatching did not change the hazard ratio significantly. SPKTRs have an increased risk of SCC compared with KTRs, despite <b>partial</b> <b>confounding</b> by the immunosuppressive regimen...|$|E

40|$|It is {{essential}} to define the objectives of an investigation carefully at the outset, to delineate management units and biologically different populations within it, and finally to provide response information {{in a form that}} allows forest managers to forecast long-term yields. For most trials other than preliminary investigations factorial layouts of simple balanced designs are advocated, as is <b>partial</b> <b>confounding</b> in incomplete blocks or completely randomised single-tree plots. Soil and foliar analyses are considered to be useful aids for delineating populations and choosing fertiliser treatments. In turn, results from fertiliser trials can be used for refining the calibration of these diagnostic methods. Measurements taken should be appropriate to the aims of the experiment and to the variability among and within trees. Intensive measurement of a small representative sample is preferred to coarse measurement or indirect estimation of many individuals. Precautions to be taken in checking the apparent reliability of individual measurements and in adopting appropriate statistical techniques to avoid misleading results are briefly discussed...|$|E
40|$|Models for {{genome-wide}} prediction and association studies usually {{target a}} single phenotypic trait. However, in {{animal and plant}} genetics {{it is common to}} record information on multiple phenotypes for each individual that will be genotyped. Modeling traits individually disregards {{the fact that they are}} most likely associated due to pleiotropy and shared biological basis, thus providing only a <b>partial,</b> <b>confounded</b> view of genetic effects and phenotypic interactions. In this article we use data from a Multiparent Advanced Generation Inter-Cross (MAGIC) winter wheat population to explore Bayesian networks as a convenient and interpretable framework for the simultaneous modeling of multiple quantitative traits. We show that they are equivalent to multivariate genetic best linear unbiased prediction (GBLUP) and that they are competitive with single-trait elastic net and single-trait GBLUP in predictive performance. Finally, we discuss their relationship with other additive-effects models and their advantages in inference and interpretation. MAGIC populations provide an ideal setting for this kind of investigation because the very low population structure and large sample size result in predictive models with good power and limited confounding due to relatedness.

40|$|An {{indirect}} {{estimate of}} consumable food and probability of acquiring {{food in a}} blowfly species, Chrysomya putoria, is presented. This alternative procedure combines three distinct models to estimate consumable food {{in the context of}} the exploitative competition experienced by immature individuals in blowfly populations. The relevant parameters are derived from data for pupal weight and survival and estimates of density-independent larval mortality in twenty different larval densities. As part of this procedure, the probability of acquiring food per unit of time and the time taken to exhaust the food supply are also calculated. The procedure employed here may be valuable for estimations in insects whose immature stages develop inside the food substrate, where it is difficult to <b>partial</b> out <b>confounding</b> effects such as separation of faeces. This procedure also has the advantage of taking into account the population dynamics of immatures living under crowded conditions, which are particularly characteristic of blowflies and other insects as well...|$|R
40|$|A {{two-stage}} {{approach has}} recently been proposed to assess confounding by copollutants or other variables in time–series epidemiology studies for airborne particulate matter (PM), using independent series from different cities. In {{the first stage of}} the proposed method, two regression models are fitted for each city in the analysis. The first relates the health effect to the putative causal variable such as PM without including any copollutant or confounder. The other first-stage model relates a putative confounding variable to PM. In the second stage of the analysis, the estimated city-specific regression slopes for the health-effect-versus-PM model are regressed against the estimated city-specific regression slopes for the confounder-versus-PM model. Under the proposed method, a nonzero intercept estimate in the second-stage regression would be interpreted as indicating a direct pathway from PM to the health effect, and a nonzero slope estimate would be interpreted as indicating at least <b>partial</b> <b>confounding</b> of PM with the putative confounder. A simple counterexample using an additional copollutant variable shows that inferences based on this method could be misleading.

40|$|ObjectivesThe goal of {{this study}} was to assess the {{associations}} between renal artery calcification (RAC) and mortality in a healthy outpatient cohort with no known cardiovascular disease (CVD). BackgroundStudies in individuals with known diabetes and kidney disease have suggested that RAC confers additional mortality risk independent of coronary artery calcification, but this hypothesis has not been explored in healthier populations. MethodsRAC was assessed by using computed tomography scan in healthy outpatients with no known CVD. Cox proportional hazards models were used to examine the association of RAC with mortality. ResultsThe mean age of participants was 57 years; 42. 6 % were women. RAC was present in 622 (14 %) of 4, 450 participants. Over a median follow-up of 8. 2 years, there were 178 deaths. After adjustment for age, sex, diabetes, smoking, cholesterol, and family history of CVD, the presence of RAC conferred a > 60 % increased hazard for all-cause mortality (hazard ratio [HR]: 1. 63 [95 % confidence interval (CI) : 1. 17 to 2. 29]). Adjustment for calcification in other vascular beds attenuated this association (HR: 1. 40 [95 % CI: 0. 99 to 1. 97]). Adjustment for hypertension, a potential mediator of the association, did not substantially change the results (HR: 1. 44 [95 % CI: 1. 02 to 2. 03]). Adding RAC to a model including Framingham risk and coronary artery calcification improved the predictive ability of the model, from 0. 73 to 0. 77 (p = 0. 0002); the net reclassification index was 14. 4 % for the addition of RAC. Results for cardiovascular mortality were not significant and were limited by the small number of cardiovascular deaths. ConclusionsRAC was associated with an increased risk of subsequent all-cause mortality in healthy outpatient individuals, independent of traditional cardiac risk factors. The risk was modestly attenuated by adjustment for vascular calcification in other vascular beds, suggesting <b>partial</b> <b>confounding</b> by systemic calcified atherosclerosis. The effect did not seem to be mediated by hypertension...|$|E
40|$|This {{dissertation}} contains several projects, each addressing different {{questions with}} different techniques. In chapter 1, I {{argue that they}} are unified thematically by their goal of 'scaling up psycholinguistics'; they are all aimed at analyzing large datasets using tools that reveal patterns to propose and test mechanism-neutral hypotheses about the brain's language processing architecture. In chapter 2, I investigate the well-known phenomenon that words which are more predictable in context are read faster than words which are not. I suggest that this is best understood as a special case of a phenomenon whereby more predictable events, whether linguistic or not, are in general processed more quickly than unpredictable ones, and propose a general model of why this happens. When combined with the constraints imposed by language's incrementally processed serial structure, this model predicts a logarithmic relationship between word probability and reading time, and I show that this in fact holds in two large data sets. In chapter 3, I turn {{to the question of}} how the brain produces fine- grained quantitative predictions; computationally, this seems impossible given the sparsity of the data it has available. This suggests it uses some kind of learning biases to guide generalization (a classic poverty of the stimulus argument), and I propose to study these biases by comparing subjective (cloze) probability with objective corpus probabilities. In Experiment 1, I find a number of candidate biases; in a series of follow-up experiments, I argue that some are probably artifactual, but others may in fact give clues to the brain's mechanisms for generating linguistic expectations from experience. Chapters 4 and 5 develop a methodology for extending ERP analysis to handle continuously varying stimulus attributes, <b>partial</b> <b>confounding,</b> and overlapping brain responses to events occurring in quick succession. These techniques are motivated by the desire to analyze EEG recorded in more naturalistic language paradigms (which contain all of the above challenges), but they are not specific to language studies, and have many potential applications for EEG/MEG research more generall...|$|E

40|$|This fMRI study {{aimed to}} {{identify}} the neural mechanisms underlying the recognition of Chinese multi-character words by <b>partialling</b> out the <b>confounding</b> effect of reaction time (RT). For this purpose, a special type of nonword-transposable nonword-was created by reversing the character orders of real words. These nonwords were included in a lexical decision task along with regular (non-transposable) nonwords and real words. Through conjunction analysis on the contrasts of transposable nonwords versus regular nonwords and words versus regular nonwords, the confounding effect of RT was eliminated, and the regions involved in word recognition were reliably identified. The word-frequency effect was also examined in emerged regions to further assess their functional roles in word processing. Results showed significant conjunctional effect and positive word-frequency effect in the bilateral inferior parietal lobules and posterior cingulate cortex, whereas only conjunctional effect {{was found in the}} anterior cingulate cortex.

We aimed to reveal the partial volume effect in absolute values of kinetic parameters for [11 C]PiB, in terms of spillover from white matter. Dynamic data acquired in [11 C]PiB PET scans with five healthy volunteers and eight patients with Alzheimer's disease were corrected with region-based and voxel-based partial volume corrections. Binding potential (BPND) was estimated using the two-tissue compartment model analysis with a plasma input function. Partial volume corrections significantly decreased cortical BPND values. The degree of decrease in healthy volunteers (− 52. 7 ± 5. 8 %) was larger than that in Alzheimer's disease patients (− 11. 9 ± 4. 2 %). The simulation demonstrated that white matter spillover signals due to the partial volume effect resulted in an overestimation of cortical BPND, with {{a greater degree of}} overestimation for lower BPND values. Thus, an overestimation due to partial volume effects is more severe in healthy volunteers than in Alzheimer's disease patients. Partial volume corrections may be useful for accurately quantifying Aβ deposition in cortical regions...|$|R
40|$|Studies {{suggest that}} {{executive}} functions {{in patients with}} schizophrenia are markedly impaired as compared with normal controls. Most previous studies employed tests of executive functions adopted from frontal lobe neuropsychological paradigms based on lesion studies. This study employed several more recently developed theory-driven tests of executive functions addressing the construct of the supervisory attentional system. We explore the pattern of executive function impairment using factor analysis and subsequently investigate the relationships between these executive function factors and the clinical features {{in a sample of}} chronic schizophrenic patients. A total of 51 patients with chronic schizophrenia were recruited. The Sustained Attention Response to Task (SART), Six Elements Test (SET) and Hayling Sentence Completion Test (HSC) were used to assess executive functions. Three factors were identified within the executive function tests: 1) The "semantic inhibition factor" comprised items in the HSC, 2) the "action/attention inhibition" factor comprised the SART commission error and the SET rule-breaking score and 3) the"output generation factor" comprised the SET raw score and the correct SART response. Significant relationships were found between these derived factors and clinical features after <b>partialling</b> out the <b>confounding</b> effect of age, education and illness duration. The three theory-based tests of executive function were shown to have good construct validity among the group of chronic schizophrenic patients. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R

One popular index of holistic processing (HP) –the alignment effect used in the <b>partial</b> design–is <b>confounded</b> with response biases, whereas a different measure–the congruency × alignment effect used in the complete design–produces a more valid measure of HP. Because the two measures can yield different conclusions, we re-visit the role of HP in two phenomena where the complete design {{has not yet been}} used: the face-inversion effect (FIE) and the other-race effect (ORE). Recognition of inverted faces (Yin, 1969) or upright faces of an unfamiliar race (Meissner & Brigham, 2001) is often impaired, with a reduction in HP posited as the basis of reduced performance (Rhodes et al., 1989; Hole, 1994). However, support for this claim has been mixed (Sekuler et al., 2004; Stokes et al., VSS 2010) and composite studies of these effects have only used the partial design. Here we obtain categorically different conclusions regarding the contributions of HP to the FIE and ORE depending on how HP is measured. When investigating the FIE via the composite paradigm using the partial design, HP was only observed for upright but not inverted faces. With the complete design, however, inverted faces were also processed holistically at longer exposure durations. Similarly, when Caucasian and Asian participants were tested with same- and other-race faces, the partial design failed to capture an ORE in HP. In contrast, a significant ORE was observed using the complete design. Additionally, in both experiments, only partial design measures correlated with response bias. HP was reduced but not abolished for other-race faces and delayed for inverted faces, which is consistent with reduced processing efficiency when objects of expertise depart from familiar conditions. link_to_OA_fulltextThe 11 th Annual Meeting of the Vision Sciences Society, Naples, FL., 6 - 11 May 2011.
