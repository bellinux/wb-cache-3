50|$|Public <b>Key</b> <b>Cryptography</b> is {{a common}} form of a forward {{anonymous}} system. It is used to pass encrypted messages, preventing any information about the message from being discovered if the message is intercepted by an attacker.

The <b>Private</b> <b>key</b> is not well known, and is used to decrypt cyphertext. Public <b>key</b> <b>cryptography</b> is known as an asymmetric decryption algorithm because of different keys being used to perform opposing functions. Public <b>key</b> <b>cryptography</b> is popular because, while it is computationally easy to create a pair of keys, {{it is extremely difficult}} to determine the <b>private</b> <b>key</b> knowing only the public key. Therefore, the public key being well known does not allow messages which are intercepted to be decrypted.

40|$|Abstract — Elliptic curve {{cryptography}} (ECC) is {{an approach}} to public-key cryptography based on the algebraic structure of elliptic curves over finite fields. In public key cryptography each user or the device {{taking part in the}} communication generally have a pair of keys, a public key and a private key, and a set of operations associated with the keys to do the cryptographic operations. Only the particular user knows the private key whereas the public key is distributed to all users taking part in the communication. Some public key algorithm may require a set of predefined constants to be known by all the devices taking part in the communication. ‘Domain parameters ’ in ECC is an example of such constants. Public key cryptography, unlike <b>private</b> <b>key</b> <b>cryptography,</b> does not require any shared secret between the communicating parties but it is much slower than the <b>private</b> <b>key</b> <b>cryptography.</b> This paper discusses the current trend of ECC with traditional cryptography methods. ECC is emerging as an attractive public-key cryptosystem for mobile/wireless and other environments. Compared to traditional cryptosystems like RSA, ECC offers equivalent security with smaller key sizes, which results in faster computations; lower power consumption, as well as memory and bandwidth savings...|$|E

Because of their memory and computational restrictions, public key cryptography (PKC) systems are not suited for sensor nodes to provide security. Instead, <b>private</b> <b>key</b> <b>cryptography</b> is preferred {{to be used with}} sensor networks and there has been considerable work in this area, but there still exist problems with <b>private</b> <b>key</b> <b>cryptography</b> because of memory restrictions of sensor nodes. Number of keys that can be deployed into a sensor node is determined by the available memory of that node which is limited even private key cryptographic techniques are applied. So, new key distribution mechanisms are required to decrease number of pairwise keys that are deployed into a sensor node. Random key pre-distribution mechanisms have been proposed to overcome memory restrictions of sensor nodes. These mechanisms are widely accepted for sensor network security. Simply, these schemes try do decrease the number of keys to be deployed in each sensor node in a sensor network and provide reasonable security for the sensor network. Random key pre-distribution schemes proposed until now have some deficiencies. Some of these schemes are too complicated and too difficult to be applied. Schemes that seem deployable involve unrealistic assumptions when real world scenarios are considered. In this thesis, we propose random key pre-distribution mechanisms that are simple and easily deployable. In this thesis, we first developed a generalized random key pre-distribution scheme. Then we proposed three random key pre-distribution mechanisms based on this generalized scheme and we provided their simulation results and their comparison to well-known random key pre-distribution schemes in the literature. Our generalized scheme allows different systems to be derived according to deployment needs. It offers simple, easily deployable distribution mechanisms and provides reasonable connectivity and resiliency with respect to its simplicity...|$|E
