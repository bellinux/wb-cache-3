Based on the same Roman civil law that is behind much European law, the procedure of a canonical court is more akin to the inquisitorial system, with the judges leading the investigation. As a general rule, the defendant has the favorable <b>presumption</b> <b>of</b> <b>law,</b> {{which means that the}} defendant will win by default unless a majority of the judges is convinced with moral certainty of the petitioner's case (can. 1608). This presumption also applies in penal cases (can. 1728). There are few exceptions to this rule; in those cases, the burden shifts to the defendant.|$|E

Therefore, when I find the regulations broken,--when I find farms given of more than a lac of rupees,--when I find them given to the Governor-General's own banian, contrary to the principle of the regulation, contrary, I say, in the strongest way to it,--when I find that he accumulates farms beyond the regulated number,--when I find all these things done, and besides that the banian has great balances of account against him,--then, by the <b>presumption</b> <b>of</b> <b>law,</b> I am bound to believe that all this was done, not for the servants, but for the master.|$|E

They agreed to the <b>presumption</b> <b>of</b> <b>law</b> as to the making of improvements; to compensation for improvements, retrospective and prospective; to the right of new tenants at will to compensation on eviction.

Mr. Gladstone wrote a long argumentative letter to Lord Granville to be shown to Lowe, and it was effectual.

60|$|In {{ancient times}} it has {{happened}} to the law of England (as in pleading, so in matter of evidence) that a rigid strictness in the application of technical rules has been more observed than at present it is. In the more early ages, as the minds of the Judges were in general less conversant in the affairs of the world, as the sphere of their jurisdiction was less extensive, and as the matters which came before them were of less variety and complexity, the rule being in general right, not so much inconvenience on the whole was found from a literal adherence to it as might have arisen from an endeavor towards a liberal and equitable departure, for which further experience, and a more continued cultivation of equity as a science, had not then so fully prepared them. In those times that judicial policy was not to be condemned. We find, too, that, probably from the same cause, most of their doctrine leaned towards the restriction; and the old lawyers being bred, according to the then philosophy of the schools, in habits of great subtlety and refinement of distinction, and having once taken that bent, very great acuteness of mind was displayed in maintaining every rule, every maxim, every <b>presumption</b> <b>of</b> <b>law</b> creation, and every fiction of law, with a punctilious exactness: and this seems to have been the course which laws have taken in every nation.[50] It was probably from this rigor, and from a sense of its pressure, that, at an early period of our law, far more causes of criminal jurisdiction were carried into the House of Lords and the Council Board, where laymen were judges, than can or ought to be at present.|$|E

40|$|Some jurisdictions allow a {{civil claim}} {{to be based on}} foreign law. Those jurisdictions that {{consider}} the foreign law to be a question of fact need to decide the legal result of the claimant 2 ̆ 7 s failure to prove the contents of the applicable foreign law. Conventional doctrine usually assigns the burden to prove the contents <b>of</b> foreign <b>law</b> (in the sense of persuasion) to the party whose claim is based upon that law, and thus failure to meet that burden ends in the claim being dismissed. The only two exceptions are cases in which the <b>presumption</b> <b>of</b> an identity <b>of</b> <b>laws</b> (<b>presumption</b> <b>of</b> similarity) is evoked or cases in which failure to prove foreign law straighforwardly prompts the court to apply local law as subsidiary law. In these exceptional cases, the application <b>of</b> the <b>law</b> <b>of</b> the forum results in the burden of proof shifting onto the opponent of the claim. Against this backdrop, I propose a new approach for assigning the burden of persuasion regarding the contents of an applicable foreign law. I argue that when foreign law is treated as fact, its unique features as such should be recognized by lawmakers. As a fact, foreign law usually necessitates expert witness testimony, but is relatively easy to ascertain (that is, evidence can always be found). On the other hand, foreign law is also expensive to prove and occasionally more accessible to one litigant than to the other. Moreover, litigants cannot argue that they were surprised by the reassignment of the persuasion burden. Thus, I argue that while the burden to persuade the court as to the content <b>of</b> foreign <b>law</b> ordinarily should rest on the litigant who asserts a claim based in foreign law, the burden should also shift more easily to the other party to promote cost-efficient truth-discovering. The normative part of the paper starts by arguing that the persuasion burden should shift in cases in which the rationales supporting the <b>presumption</b> <b>of</b> identity <b>of</b> <b>laws</b> or the straighfforward application <b>of</b> local <b>law</b> as subsidiary law apply, notwithstanding the contents <b>of</b> the <b>law</b> <b>of</b> the forum and whether or not applying it would benefit the party attempting to prove an applicable foreign law. Such an approach is justified at least on grounds of coherence, as the persuasion burden already shifts whenever the <b>law</b> <b>of</b> the forum is applied instead of the applicable foreign law. Indeed, the contents <b>of</b> the <b>law</b> <b>of</b> the forum, per se, should not become a factor in the decision on how to allocate the persuasion burden. The paper then moves on to develop a broader argument. As a general rule, it is suggested that the burden of persuasion with regard to the contents of an applicable foreign law shift f the opposing litigant enjoys a clear comparative advantage in providing proof as to the content <b>of</b> that foreign <b>law,</b> while the costs of providing such proof should be assigned on a 2 ̆ 2 loser pays 2 ̆ 2 basis...|$|R
60|$|It is {{not true}} that in all {{voluntary}} association between two people, one of them must be absolute master: still less that the law must determine which of them it shall be. The most frequent case of voluntary association, next to marriage, is partnership in business: {{and it is not}} found or thought necessary to enact that in every partnership, one partner shall have entire control over the concern, and the others shall be bound to obey his orders. No one would enter into partnership on terms which would subject him to the responsibilities of a principal, with only the powers and privileges of a clerk or agent. If the law dealt with other contracts as it does with marriage, it would ordain that one partner should administer the common business as if it was his private concern; that the others should have only delegated powers; and that this one should be designated by some general <b>presumption</b> <b>of</b> <b>law,</b> for example as being the eldest. The law never does this: nor does experience show it to be necessary that any theoretical inequality of power should exist between the partners, or that the partnership should have any other conditions than what they may themselves appoint by their articles of agreement. Yet it might seem that the exclusive power might be conceded with less danger to the rights and interests of the inferior, in the case of partnership than in that of marriage, since he is free to cancel the power by withdrawing from the connexion. The wife has no such power, and even if she had, it is almost always desirable that she should try all measures before resorting to it.|$|E

5000|$|There {{are several}} sub-varieties of <b>presumption</b> <b>of</b> <b>law.</b> The {{foundation}} of these legal presumptions {{is to be}} sought in the natural conclusions drawn from the ordinary happenings of common life and the consideration of the motives that usually sway men in given circumstances.

As to effects, when there is question of presumption juris, it abstracts from the necessity of proof; not so presumption hominis. A judge can follow the first in civil cases even when doubt remains, not so the second. The former places the burden of proof on the adversary, but the latter does not.

5000|$|Lincoln was {{involved}} {{in at least two}} cases involving slavery. In an 1841 Illinois Supreme Court case, Bailey v. Cromwell, Lincoln successfully prevented the sale of a woman who was alleged to be a slave, making the argument that in Illinois [...] "the <b>presumption</b> <b>of</b> <b>law</b> was ... that every person was free, without regard to color." [...] In 1847 Abraham Lincoln defended Robert Matson, a slave owner who was trying to retrieve his runaway slaves. Matson brought slaves from his Kentucky plantation to work on land he owned in Illinois. The slaves were represented by Orlando Ficklin, Usher Linder, and Charles H. Constable. The slaves ran away because they believed that once they were in Illinois they were free, since the Northwest Ordinance forbade slavery in the territory that included Illinois. In this case, Lincoln invoked the right of transit, which allowed slaveholders to take their slaves temporarily into free territory. Lincoln also stressed that Matson did not intend to have the slaves remain permanently in Illinois. Even with these arguments, judges in Coles County ruled against Lincoln and the slaves were set free. Donald notes, [...] "Neither the Matson case nor the Cromwell case should be taken as an indication of Lincoln's views on slavery; his business was law, not morality." [...] The right of transit was a legal theory recognized by some of the free states that a slaveowner could take slaves into a free state and retain ownership as long as the intent was not to permanently settle in the free state.|$|E
