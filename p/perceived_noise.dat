40|$|Noise {{concerns}} frequently pose {{a barrier}} to widespread implementation of wind turbines and while the perception of noise from large turbines has been investigated, there is a relative gap in the research for small and micro wind turbines. This paper presents findings from interdisciplinary research linking noise measurements from small wind installations with {{an investigation into the}} effect of individual personality traits and noise perception. A survey distributed to households living close to one of 12 micro or small turbine sites, coupled with environmental noise measurements was analysed. The survey showed that the most commonly <b>perceived</b> <b>noises</b> are ‘swooshing’ and ‘humming’, the presence of which may be inferred from the measured frequency spectra. Exploration of survey results showed individuals with a more negative attitude to wind turbines <b>perceive</b> more <b>noise</b> from a turbine located close to their dwelling and those <b>perceiving</b> more <b>noise</b> report increased levels of general symptoms. Individuals' personality also affected attitudes to wind turbines, noise perception from small and micro turbines and symptom reporting...|$|R

Any aircraft that fell under the Town's classification of “noisy” (aircraft with an Effective <b>Perceived</b> <b>Noise</b> in Decibels EPNdB approach level of 91.0 or greater) was forbidden from taking off or landing from 8:00PM to 9:00AM all year and was limited to one landing and one takeoff per week.

50|$|EPNdB, or Effective <b>Perceived</b> <b>Noise</b> {{level in}} decibels, {{is a measure}} of the {{relative}} loudness of an individual aircraft pass-by event. Separate ratings are stated for takeoff, overflight and landing phases, and represent the integrated sum of loudness over the period within which the noise from the aircraft is within 10 dB of the maximum noise (usually at the point of closest approach.) It is defined in Annex 16 of the Convention on International Civil Aviation and in Part 36 of the US Federal Aviation Regulations. The scaling is such that the EPNdB rating represents the integrated loudness over a ten-second period; EPNdB of 100 dB means that the event has the same integrated loudness as a 100 dB sound lasting ten seconds.|$|E
5000|$|Noise shaping in audio is most {{commonly}} applied as a bit-reduction scheme. The most basic form of dither is flat, white noise. The ear, however, is less sensitive to certain frequencies than others at low levels (see Fletcher-Munson curves). By using noise shaping we can effectively spread the quantization error around {{so that more}} of it is focused on frequencies that we can't hear as well and less of it is focused on frequencies that we can hear. The result is that where the ear is most critical the quantization error can be reduced greatly and where our ears are less sensitive the noise is much greater. This can give a <b>perceived</b> <b>noise</b> reduction of 4 bits compared to straight dither. [...] While 16-bit audio is typically thought to have 96 dB of dynamic range (see quantization distortion calculations), it can actually be increased to 120 dB using noise-shaped dither.|$|E

In all the industries, only one had equivalent continuous noise level below 85 dBA. The results of the physical measurements showed that the noise was predominantly broad-band, continuous and steady state. Noisiness and <b>perceived</b> <b>noise</b> levels were obtained from the results of the physical measurements. The result showed that <b>perceived</b> <b>noise</b> levels were not more than 2 dB higher than their corresponding equivalent continuous noise levels implying that the human ear perceives noise (2 dB maximally) higher than that measured by a sound level meter on A-weighting scale. For noise levels at 90 dB and above small increase would result to higher noisiness increase. However, noise level and <b>perceived</b> <b>noise</b> level have continuous and steady dependence at all values.

40|$|Although {{environmental}} noise from entertainment and leisure activities is causing {{a growing number}} of complaints from EU population, this noise issue is not covered by the current EU initiatives on {{environmental noise}} management. This noise problem is difficult to tackle strategically and technically – no specific standards have yet been established for measurements, methods and indicators, and the practical remedies are still limited. This paper reviews nightlife noise and more specifically how the presence of tourists influences the variation of the noise. Several case studies were conducted in some Spanish locations by the seasonal tourist incursion, mainly in the summer months. Variations in the nightlife noise in recreational zones during the weekends and “working days” are compared. This research also discusses data from different years and seasonal periods and reinforced with data obtained through surveys specifically designed for foreign tourists. These surveys reveal practical information about how tourists <b>perceive</b> <b>noise,</b> and their behaviour and reactions to it.

40|$|During {{the process}} of European {{integration}} the question arose how a standard could be created to assess qualitative and quantitative effects deriving from the development of transport infrastructures. The issue gets an even higher emphasis in case of valuation the development of large projects which impact several countries. The main {{aim of the research}} was to determine how much people are bothered, disturbed or annoyed by noise, and then to establish a correlation between this and their willingness to pay, and the absolute noise levels. This paper summarizes the survey and its results. Noise influences people´s well being and standard of living. It is the only environmental pollution where it is not a polluting material that effects the body adversely - {{as it is in the}} case of air or water pollution -, but the danger is created by an energy overdose reaching the sensory and data processing organs. Here we talk about nervous processes and this characteristic distinguishes noise pollution from all the other contaminating factors. It has also got to be mentioned that <b>perceiving</b> <b>noise</b> is very subjective. The reaction of people is largely predetermined by how they relate to the noise source. Noise annoyance can be determined by socio-acoustical studies. The essence of these is that they do not only take into account decibel levels, but attach so called annoyance levels to the given sound pressure levels...|$|R
40|$|Methods {{developed}} at the NASA Lewis Research Center for predicting the noise contributions from various aircraft noise sources have been incorporated into a computer program for predicting aircraft noise levels either in flight or in ground test. The noise sources accounted for include fan inlet and exhaust, jet, flap (for powered lift), core (combustor), turbine, and airframe. Noise propagation corrections {{are available in the}} program for atmospheric attenuation, ground reflections, extra ground attenuation, and shielding. The capacity to solve the geometrical relationships between an aircraft in flight and an observer on the ground has been included in the program to make it useful in evaluating noise estimates and footprints for various proposed engine installations. The program contains two main routines for employing the noise prediction routines. The first main routine consists of a procedure to calculate at various observer stations the time history of the noise from an aircraft flying at a specified set of speeds, orientations, and space coordinates. The various components of the noise are computed by the program. For each individual source, the noise levels are free field with no corrections for propagation losses other than spherical divergence. The total spectra may then be corrected for the usual effects of atmospheric attenuation, extra ground attenuation, ground reflection, and aircraft shielding. Next, the corresponding values of overall sound pressure level, <b>perceived</b> <b>noise</b> level, and tone-weighted <b>perceived</b> <b>noise</b> level are calculated. From the time history at each point, true effective <b>perceived</b> <b>noise</b> levels are calculated. Thus, values of effective <b>perceived</b> <b>noise</b> levels, maximum <b>perceived</b> <b>noise</b> levels, and tone-weighted <b>perceived</b> <b>noise</b> levels are found for a grid of specified points on the ground. The second main routine is designed to give the usual format of one-third octave sound pressure level values at a fixed radius for a number of user-selected angles, such as would simulate the ground acoustic testing of an engine.

40|$|The {{augmentor wing}} concept is being studied as one means of {{attaining}} short takeoff and landing (STOL) performance in turbofan powered aircraft. Because of the stringent noise requirements for STOL operation, the acoustics of the augmentor wing are undergoing extensive research.

The augmentor was not acoustically treated, although the compressor supplying the high pressure primary air was treated to allow the measurement of only the augmentor noise. Installing the augmentor flap and shroud on the slot primary nozzle caused the acoustic dependence on jet velocity to change from eighth power to sixth power. Deflecting the augmentor at constant power increased the <b>perceived</b> <b>noise</b> level in the forward quadrant. The effect of airspeed was small. A small aft shift in <b>perceived</b> <b>noise</b> directivity was experienced with no significant change in sound power.

40|$|BackgroundNoise {{exposures}} {{are associated}} with a host of adverse health effects, yet these exposures remain inadequately characterized in many industrial operations, including paper mills. We assessed noise at four paper mills using three measures: 1) personal noise dosimetry, 2) area noise measurements, and 3) questionnaire items addressing several different aspects of <b>perceived</b> <b>noise</b> exposure. MethodsWe assessed exposures to noise characterized using the three measures and compared the relationships between them. We also estimated the validity of each of the three measures using a novel application of the Method of Triads, which {{does not appear to have}} been used previously in the occupational health literature. ResultsWe collected 209 valid dosimetry measurements and collected <b>perceived</b> <b>noise</b> exposure survey items from 170 workers, along with 100 area measurements. We identified exposures in excess of 85 dBA at all mills. The dosimetry and area noise measurements assigned to individual subjects generally showed good agreement, but for some operations within mill, large differences between the two measures were observed, and a substantial fraction of paired measures differed by > 5 dB. <b>Perceived</b> <b>noise</b> exposures varied greatly between the mills, particularly for an item related to difficulty speaking in noise. One <b>perceived</b> <b>noise</b> exposure item related to difficulty hearing due to noise showed strong and significant correlations with both dosimetry and area measurements. The Method of Triads analysis showed that dosimetry measures had the highest estimated validity coefficient (0. 70), and that the best performing perceived exposure measure had validity that exceeded that of area measurements (0. 48 vs. 0. 40, respectively). ConclusionsWorkers in Swedish pulp mills have the potential for exposures to high levels of noise. Our results suggest that, while dosimetry remains the preferred approach to exposure assessment, <b>perceived</b> <b>noise</b> exposures can be used to evaluate potential exposures to noise in epidemiological studies.
