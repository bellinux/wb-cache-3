30|$|Beyond {{unemployment}} effects we find {{negative effects}} of the <b>population</b> <b>variable</b> for the home district. We argue that {{an increasing number of}} young adults of the same age increases the competitive pressure and decreases training chances. Also, we find significant effect for the time variable. This can be interpreted as additional indirect evidence for the importance of the macro-economic situation for individual chances of entering training. One explanation for the time effect is the general relaxation of the labour and training market in recent years (see Fig.  3). These cyclical trends lead to an increasing total net supply of training positions (BMBF 2012). The time effect remains significant even when controlling for unemployment on several levels, suggesting that there might be more indicators than just regional unemployment as predictors for the economic situation.|$|E
