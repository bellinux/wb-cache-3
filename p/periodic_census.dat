50|$|Where {{the total}} number of regnal years for a given ruler is not known, Egyptologists have {{identified}} two indicators to provide that total number: for the Old Kingdom, the number of cattle censuses; and for later periods, the celebration of a sed festival. A number of Old Kingdom inscriptions allude to a <b>periodic</b> <b>census</b> of cattle, which experts at first believed took place every second year; thus records of as many as 24 cattle censuses indicate Sneferu had reigned 48 years. However, further research has shown that these censuses were sometimes taken in consecutive years, or after two or more years had passed. The sed festival was usually celebrated on the thirtieth anniversary of the Pharaoh's ascension, thus rulers who recorded recording one could be assumed to have ruled at least 30 years. However, once again, {{this may not be the}} usual practice in all cases.|$|E

The findings are less than conclusive because of marked errors in the census populations. Methods using intercensal survival perform very poorly, giving rise to results {{that are hard to}} interpret. Methods using the distribution of deaths by age and rates of change of the population by age appear to work better, but still give rise to substantially different results. Simulations suggest that a combination of two methods appears to work well. In the Guatemala case, survival of mother appears to over-estimate female adult mortality, whereas survival of siblings appears to underestimate adult mortality. A new method for analyzing intercensal changes in cohort proportions with surviving mother, presented in the paper, gives results broadly consistent with estimates based on adjusted registered deaths. ...|$|R

40|$|Farming in Wisconsin has {{undergone}} considerable {{change in the}} last few decades. U. S. Census statistics suggest that the state lost almost 13 percent of its farms and over 10 percent of its farmland between 1987 - 1997. The decline in farm numbers was particularly severe for mid-sized commercial livestock farms. During this period, the number of hog farms dropped by almost 60 percent, dairy farms fell by 40 percent, and farms with any harvested cropland declined by more than 20 percent (Buttel, 1999). Meanwhile, when dairy and hog farm number declines are removed from the equation, census results show that there was actually significant growth in part-time and hobby farm numbers during the 1990 s in Wisconsin. While the <b>periodic</b> <b>Census</b> of Agriculture provides some key insights into the long-term trends in the Wisconsin farm sector, the Census asks relatively few questions about a number of important topics. Specifically, there is little information gathered about the use of different agricultural technologies or management practices. In addition, despite the fact that most Wisconsin farms are run as family businesses, there is virtually no information collected about members of the farm household (other than the lead operator) or the household’s involvement in off-farm as well as farming activities. Finally, the Census asks no questions about the opinions or views of Wisconsin farmers concerning important public policy questions...|$|E

40|$|A National Census of Mentally Handicapped Persons in the Republic of Ireland {{was carried}} out in 1981 by the Medico-Social Research Board. The Board had earlier decided that for various reasons, {{information}} derived from <b>periodic</b> <b>censuses</b> would prove easier to obtain and be less expensive than setting up a central national register of mentally handicapped persons. The first national Census of the Mentally Handicapped took place in 1974 and 1981 was considered an appropriate time for repeating the census because a national Census of Population was being undertaken that year. The methods employed {{in the collection of the}} latest Census data were broadly similar to those used in 1974. Information was sought primarily through Directors of Community Care and public health nurses in respect of the mentally handicapped living at home, and from· the management and nursing staff of various centres in respect of the mentally handicapped in residential care. The main objective of the Census was to obtain a true prevalence rate for moderate, severe and profound levels of handicap and an "administrative prevalence""for mild handicap. Persons with a mild or borderline degree of handicap were only included therefore if receiving a mental handicap service, that is, either attending such a service or receiving state allowances because of a mental handicap diagnosis. No effort was made to locate all mildly mentally handicapped persons. The 1974 Census had attempted to ascertain the mildly mentally handicapped in residential care only but the 1981 Census went further by including also the mildly mentally handicapped living at home...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} extent to which the {{differential}} urbanisation model is applicable to Botswana by using empirical data obtained from <b>periodic</b> <b>censuses,</b> supportive documentary information and observations from personal on-going research on urbanisation and migration. Differential urbanisation refers to the cyclic spatio-temporal growth trends that the elements of human settlement hierarchies undergo, in response to migration. Empirical studies have verified the validity of differential urbanisation in the United States, Europe, India and South Africa. These areas, unlike Botswana, have longer histories of urbanisation, larger population sizes, denser population distributions, and higher levels of economic development. Current research interest is focused on investigating the theoretical applicability of the differential urbanisation model to those countries at the lower end of the economic development spectrum. The rationale and thrust of this paper is to therefore investigate the relevance of differential urbanisation under unique environmental, demographic and socio-economic conditions that pertain to Botswana. Evidence from the paper shows that urbanisation in Botswana has occurred in sequenced phases that, in general, resemble those suggested by the differential urbanisation model in the following ways. First, there has been concentration in the primate city due to mainstream migration. Secondly, there has been fission leading to the fast growth of the adjacent intermediate settlements, partly as a result of deglomeration economies at the primate core accompanied by substream migration. Third, the peripheral regional and rural centres appear to be now growing relatively rapidly, in response to the implementation of decentralisation policies.

40|$|Abstract The {{long-term}} {{variation in}} phytoplankton bio-volume {{in the northern}} basin of Lake Biwa was analyzed using <b>periodic</b> phytoplankton <b>census</b> data from January 1979 to December 2009. Population densities obtained from cen-sus data were transformed into biovolumes, and phyto-plankton species were categorized into three size fractions: net phytoplankton (C 4, 000 lm 3 cell- 1, Cca. 20 lm in diameter), large nanophytoplankton (100 – 4, 000 lm 3 cell- 1, ca. 6 – 20 lm in diameter), and small nanophytoplankton (00 lm 3 cell- 1,. 6 lm in diameter). Although the annual total biovolume gradually decreased over time, the total biovolumes in winter and spring were found to increase. Furthermore, {{a decrease in the}} biovolume of net phyto-plankton and an increase in that of small nanophytoplankton were observed. Because of succession in the phytoplankton community, the average cell volume of the phytoplankton community decreased from 269 lm 3 cell- 1 in the 1980 s to 56 lm 3 cell- 1 in the 2000 s. Lake warming accompanied with the intensification of thermal stratification and the augmentation of wind speed were observed at Lake Biwa over the study period. Serial analysis correcting for auto-correlation revealed that oligotrophication in the epilimnion, induced by lake warming and limitation of light available for phytoplankton growth by wind-induced water mixing, was a potential factor in the succession of the phytoplankton community...|$|R
40|$|Measurement studies {{published}} in the literature have, for the most part, ignored the population of hosts. While many hosts are hidden behind firewalls and in private address space, {{there is much to}} be learned from examining the population of visible Internet hosts—one can better understand network growth and accessibility and this understanding can help to assess vulnerabilities, deployment of new technologies, and improve network models. This paper is, to our knowledge, the first attempt to measure the population of visible Internet edge hosts. We measure hosts in two ways: via <b>periodic</b> Internet <b>censuses,</b> where we query all accessible Internet addresses every few months, and via surveys of {{a small fraction of the}} responsive address space, probing each address every 11 minutes for one week. These approaches are complementary: a census is effective at evaluating the Internet as a whole, while surveys validate the census and allow observation of the lifetime of typical address occupancy. We find that only 3. 6 % of allocated addresses are actually occupied by visible hosts, and that occupancy is unevenly distributed, with a quarter of responsive / 24 subnets less than 5 % full, and only 9 % of subnets more than half full. We establish an upper-bound on the number of servers in the Internet at 36 million, about 16 % of the responsive addresses. Many firewalls are visible and we observe significant diversity in the distribution of firewalled block size. While the absolute number of firewalled blocks appears stable, the ratio of coverage of visible firewalls to the number of visible addresses is declining, perhaps suggesting increasing use of invisible firewalls. ...|$|R
40|$|Although {{the genetic}} and {{ecological}} effects of population declines in endangered {{species have been}} well studied, little is known of the social consequences. Changes in signaling behavior may result in disrupted communication and affect both reproductive and conflict-resolution activities. The North Island Kōkako (Callaeas wilsoni) is an endangered, duetting (i. e., alternating, coordinated singing by mated pairs) songbird endemic to New Zealand temperate rain forests. Scattered populations (approximately 1500 individuals in 13 surviving and 11 translocated populations) in isolated conservation areas of different sizes have been rescued from extirpation and are currently recovering. We examined key song attributes of the Kōkako to assess whether population size or growth rate are related to song complexity, the reduction of which may compromise effective communication. We analyzed song repertoire size and phrase-type sharing (i. e., Jaccard index of similarity), vocal performance (singing rates, song switching rates, and diversity of phrase types), and song syntactical characteristics (i. e., unpredictability in sequences of phrase types) in surviving and translocated populations (populations of approximately 19 – 250 territorial individuals). Population size {{was positively correlated with}} a population's song repertoire, song diversity, and switching of song phrase types and negatively correlated with shared phrase types and variation in syntactical structure of songs. Population growth rate correlated positively with pair repertoire size, population repertoire size, and singing rates during song bouts. As for solo-singing species in fragmented landscapes, songs in the fragmented populations of Kōkako appear to be undergoing microevolution as occurs in island colonization events. Our results suggest that vocal changes in small populations could affect population establishment and growth, particularly in multiple-source translocations. We believe measurement of vocal behavior {{could be used as a}} supplement to <b>periodic</b> population <b>censuses</b> to allow more frequent monitoring of population size...|$|R
40|$|This report {{contains}} {{the most recent}} and comprehensive statistics available [...] for 2010 [...] on the incidence of teenage pregnancy, birth and abortion for the United States {{as a whole and}} for individual states. At the national level, we show trends since 1972. For states, we present trends since 1988. The report concludes with a discussion of the methodology and sources used to obtain the estimates. Our previously published statistics for national- and state-level estimates through 2008 were published in two separate reports. Counts of pregnancies include births, abortions, miscarriage and stillbirths. The National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS) provides annual counts of teen births in the United States, as reported in the National Vital Statistics System (via birth certificates). The estimates we present for 2010 are part of the Guttmacher Institute's ongoing surveillance of teen pregnancy in the United States. Our national- and state-level teen pregnancy report is generally updated every two years and {{contains the}} only available estimates of teen pregnancy for all 50 states using counts of abortions from the Guttmacher Institute's <b>periodic</b> national <b>census</b> of abortion providers. This census is widely recognized as the most accurate count of abortions performed annually in the United States. Through a collaborative agreement with NCHS, we also provide abortion data for the calculation of teen pregnancy rates at the national level for use in NCHS vital statistics reports. A demographic rate is defined as the number of events (in this case, pregnancies, births or abortions) divided by the number of individuals who could experience the event [...] the "population. " The pregnancy rate is composed of the rates of pregnancy outcomes (births, abortions and miscarriages) and is not synonymous with the birthrate. Trends in rates of births, abortions and pregnancies can move in different directions and may be affected by different social and economic factors. Unless otherwise indicated, in this report, the words "teenagers" and "teens" refer to women aged 15 [...] 19. The report also includes numbers, and in some cases rates, shown separately for women aged 14 and younger, 15 [...] 17 -year-olds, 18 [...] 19 -year-olds and all women younger than 20. We also present statistics by race and ethnicity when the data are sufficient to provide these estimates...|$|R
