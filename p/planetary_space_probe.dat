40|$|In {{cooperation}} between Hungarian universities we began constructing experimental university <b>planetary</b> <b>space</b> <b>probe</b> robot models {{in order to}} develop both electronics and informatics, and planetary-science/space-science education. Two forms of robot models were prepared: fix standing type landers, named Hunveyor (Hungarian UNiversity SURVEYOR) and moving robotic rovers, named Husar (Hungarian University Surface Analyser Rover) at Eötvös University, Budapest, Pécs University, Pécs, and Óbuda University, Alba Regia Center, Székesfehérvár. We report some basic instrumentations: a) minimal space probe energetics and electronic system, b) some basic instrumental assemblage (spectrometer, thermometer, Nürnbergian scissor type arm and the cameras), c) rover units, c) test-fields and testing experiments for soil strength analysis...|$|E
40|$|Studies are {{considered}} {{of the planets}} Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune. The era of precise planetary polarimetry began {{with the work of}} Lyot (1929). The investigations in this field were continued by Dollfus (1957), who added detailed studies of planetary regions. A new breakthrough came with the availability of photoemissive detectors, which led to extensive measurements of the wavelength dependence of the polarization of planets. Two very recent developments have been the inclusion of photoelectric polarimeters on <b>planetary</b> <b>space</b> <b>probes</b> and the development of precise polarimeters for the measurement of elliptical polarization...|$|R

40|$|Experience in {{exploring}} our own solar system {{has shown that}} direct investigation of <b>planetary</b> bodies using <b>space</b> <b>probes</b> invariably yields scientific knowledge not otherwise obtainable. In the case of exoplanets, such direct investigation {{may be required to}} confirm inferences made by astronomical observations, especially with regard to planetary interiors, surface processes, geological evolution, and possible biology. This will necessitate transporting sophisticated scientific instruments across interstellar space, and some proposed methods for achieving this with flight-times measured in decades are reviewed. It is concluded that, {{with the possible exception of}} very lightweight (and thus scientifically limited) probes accelerated to velocities of ~ 0. 1 c with powerful Earth-based lasers, achieving such a capability may have to wait until the development of a space-based civilization capable of leveraging the material and energy resources of the solar system.

40|$|The {{planetary}} {{radio occultation}} technique {{is one of}} the earliest suggested and achieved methods to detect the planetary atmosphere, and has been conducted by almost every deep <b>space</b> <b>planetary</b> <b>probe.</b> The principles, modules, inversion results and primary analysis of the SHAO Planetary Occultation observation Processing system (SPOPs) are presented in this paper. Utilizing open-loop and closed-loop Doppler residual data of the Mars Express radio occultation experiment provided by ESA PSA and NASA PDS, the temperature, pressure, molecular number density profiles of Martian atmosphere and electron density profiles of the ionosphere are successfully retrieved, and the results are validated by the released radio science level 04 products of the ESA MaRS group. This system can also process the atmosphere radio occultation observations of other planets and theirs natural satellites. The implementation of the planetary radio occultation technique is of significance to China&# 39;s YH- 1 Mars exploration project, as well as for future planetary exploration missions from China...|$|R
40|$|Recent {{years have}} seen a renewed {{interest}} in exploration of the interior of the solar system. A number of missions are currently under way, in planning as well as in space, with the primary goal to expand our knowledge on the planets Mercury and Venus. Chemical propulsion missions to Mercury in particular require an extended cruise phase prior to arrival at their destination, usually involving multiple planetary fly-by manoeuvres and many revolutions in heliocentric orbit. The difficulties in discovering and tracking small objects interior to Earth’s orbit, mainly due to unfavourable viewing geometry as well as atmospheric interference, have long been noted by the solar system science and <b>planetary</b> defence communities. <b>Space</b> <b>probes</b> in the interior of the solar system {{are in a position to}} observe objects near or interior to Earth’s orbit in favourable opposition geometry. They are also usually free from planet-related interference, at least while in cruise, and often can be while in planetary eclipse. Dedicated search and survey missions to look for Near and Inner Earth Objects (NEO, IEO) from the vicinity of Earth or low Earth orbit are being planned. In this article, the ad-hoc available as well as near-term planned in-situ capabilities of the optical instrument payloads of <b>space</b> <b>probes</b> to Venus and Mercury are compiled from publications by the respective instrument teams. The small-object detection capabilities of cameras and spectrographs in opposition geometry are estimated by a common method, using data from comparable instruments to supplement missing Information where necessary. The on-board cameras are classified according to their small-object detection potential in a technology demonstration of asteroid detection from a heliocentric orbit substantially interior to Earth’s...|$|R
40|$|Currently, rockets {{are used}} to change the {{trajectory}} of <b>space</b> ships and <b>probes.</b> This method is very expensive and {{requires a lot of}} fuel, which limits the feasibility of space stations, interplanetary <b>space</b> ships, and <b>probes.</b> Sometimes <b>space</b> <b>probes</b> use the gravity field of a planet However, there am only nine planets in the Solar System, all separated by great distances. There are tons of millions of asteroids in outer space. This paper offers a revolutionary method for changing the trajectory of <b>space</b> <b>probes.</b> The method uses the kinetic or rotary energy of asteroids, comet nuclei, meteorites or other space bodies (small planets, natural <b>planetary</b> satellites, <b>space</b> debris, etc.) to increase (to decrease) ship (probe) speed up to 1000 m/sec (or more) and to achieve any new direction in outer space.
