25|$|Some <b>pistol</b> <b>shrimp</b> species share burrows with goby fishes in a {{symbiotic}} relationship. The burrow is built and tended by the <b>pistol</b> <b>shrimp,</b> and the goby provides protection by {{watching out for}} danger. When both {{are out of the}} burrow, the shrimp maintains contact with the goby using its antennae. The goby, having the better vision, alerts the shrimp of danger using a characteristic tail movement, and then both retreat into the safety of the shared burrow. So far this association has been observed in species that inhabit coral reef habitats.|$|E
25|$|Alpheidae is {{a family}} of caridean {{snapping}} shrimp characterized by having asymmetrical claws, the larger of which is typically capable of producing a loud snapping sound. Other common names for animals in the group are <b>pistol</b> <b>shrimp</b> or alpheid shrimp.|$|E
25|$|There {{are many}} {{variations}} in the ways different types of shrimp look and behave. Even within the core group of caridean shrimp, the small delicate Pederson's shrimp (above) looks and behaves quite unlike the large commercial pink shrimp or the snapping <b>pistol</b> <b>shrimp.</b> The caridean family of <b>pistol</b> <b>shrimp</b> are characterized by big asymmetrical claws, the larger of which can produce a loud snapping sound. The family is diverse and worldwide in distribution, consisting of about 600 species. Colonies of snapping shrimp are {{a major source of}} noise in the ocean and can interfere with sonar and underwater communication. The small emperor shrimp has a symbiotic relationship with sea slugs and sea cucumbers, and may help keep them clear of ectoparasites.|$|E

25|$|The impact {{can also}} produce {{sonoluminescence}} from the collapsing bubble. This {{will produce a}} very small amount of light within the collapsing bubble, although the light is too weak and short-lived to be detected without advanced scientific equipment. The light emission probably has no biological significance but is rather a side-effect of the rapid snapping motion. <b>Pistol</b> <b>shrimp</b> produce this effect in a very similar manner.|$|E
25|$|<b>Pistol</b> <b>shrimp</b> {{have also}} been noted {{for their ability to}} reverse claws. When the {{snapping}} claw is lost the missing limb will regenerate into a smaller claw and the original smaller appendage will grow into a new snapping claw. Laboratory research has shown that severing the nerve of the snapping claw induces the conversion of the smaller limb into a second snapping claw. This phenomenon of claw symmetry in snapping shrimp has only been documented once in nature.|$|E
500|$|Encountered singly or in [...] "social" [...] groups, {{the common}} {{stingray}} appears to segregate by sex {{to some degree}} and may be more active at night, tending to bury itself in sediment during daytime. It feeds {{on a wide variety}} of bottom-dwelling organisms, including crustaceans, cephalopods, bivalves, polychaete worms, and small bony fishes. It is reportedly does great damage to cultured shellfish beds. One study in the Gulf of İskenderun off Turkey found that crustaceans comprised some 99% of its diet, with fish prey becoming increasingly important with age. Another study off the coast of Tarsus, Turkey, found the most important dietary component to be the penaeid shrimp Metapenaeus stebbingi, followed by the <b>pistol</b> <b>shrimp</b> Alpheus glaber and the swimming crab Charybdis longicollis; cephalopods were relatively important for males, while fishes were important for females. Common stingrays have been observed closely following each other in the presence of food, possibly to take advantage of other individuals' foraging success.|$|E
