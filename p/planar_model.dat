5000|$|The {{essential}} {{property of}} an ovoidal Möbius plane is {{the existence of}} a space model via an ovoid. An ovoid in a 3-dimensional projective space is a set of points, which a) is intersected by lines in 0, 1, or 2 points and b) its tangents at an arbitrary point covers a plane (tangent plane). The geometry of an ovoid in projective 3-space is a Möbius plane, called ovoidal Möbius plane. The point set of the geometry consists of the points of the ovoid and the curves (cycles) are the plane sections of the ovoid. A suitable stereographical projection shows: For any ovoidal Möbius plane there exists a plane model. In the classical case the plane model is the geometry of the circles and lines (any line is completed by a point [...] ). The bundle theorem has a planar and a spatial interpretation. In the <b>planar</b> <b>model</b> there may be lines involved. The proof of the bundle theorem is performed within the spatial model.|$|E

The nonbirefringent <b>planar</b> <b>model,</b> obtained from the dimensional reduction of the CPT-even gauge sector of the standard model extension, is composed of a gauge and a scalar fields, being affected by Lorentz-violating (LIV) coefficients encoded in the symmetric tensor κ_μν. The propagator of the gauge field is explicitly evaluated and expressed in terms of linear independent symmetric tensors, presenting only one physical mode. The same holds for the scalar propagator. A consistency analysis is performed based on the poles of the propagators. The isotropic parity-even sector is stable, causal and unitary mode for 0 ≤κ_ 00 < 1.

The {{aim of this}} study was to determine the relative importance of vessel planarity, a potential geometric risk factor for atherogenesis, in determining the local hemodynamics. A combination of computational fluid dynamics and magnetic resonance imaging was used to reconstruct the subject-specific hemodynamics for three subjects. <b>Planar</b> <b>models</b> were then constructed by translating the centroids of the lumen contours onto a plane defined by the centroids of the vessel branches near the bifurcation apex.

40|$|In this dissertation, I {{pursue the}} idea {{suggested}} in Chomsky (1982) that coordination {{should be treated}} as an object with three dimensions. I propose a <b>planar</b> <b>model</b> to account for the longstanding problems of coordination. The types of phenomena studied here are related to Phrasal Coordinations, Gapping, Verb Phrase Deletion, and Right-Node Raising. I claim that a coordinate sentence, unlike a simple one, is too expansive a domain for the Principles of Universal Grammar (UG) to hold. The relevant domain for the application of UG principles is each separate "component part" of the coordinate sentence. The "component parts", referred to here as planes, are elements of the coordinate sentence which have the same formal properties as simple sentences. Thus, under the <b>planar</b> <b>model,</b> a coordinate sentence has a number of "simple sentences" or planes. Intuitively, a plane, like a simple sentence, {{can be thought of as}} a complete functional complex in which all grammatical functions compatible with its head are realized. Given this, I argue that the well-formedness of a coordinate structure depends on whether or not each of its planes obeys the principles of UG. The <b>planar</b> <b>model</b> adopts the idea that conjuncts or disjuncts in coordination are based generated at D-Structure. It is claimed that no deletions or empty nodes exists in any type of coordinate structures. I show that the absence of some elements in coordination, e. g. a verb in Gapping, is a phonetic phenomenon, which occurs only as a result of the linearization process. At the other levels of representation, such as D-Structure, S-Structure, and Logical Form, all materials are present in each plane; thus, under the <b>planar</b> <b>model,</b> we do not need to invoke a deletion rule or the existence of some empty node in those levels of representation. Given this model, I show that the principles and parameters approach of GB can in fact give a unified treatment of coordination. I demonstrate that this can be done without recourse to construction-specific stipulation...|$|E
40|$|The color Doppler {{proximal}} isavelocity {{surface area}} (PISA) method accurately estimates {{volume flow rate}} (Q) across a planar surface in vitro. This method has been applied clinically to estimating valvular regurgitant flow using a hemispherical formula requiring measurement of a single axial radius. However, since cardiac valves may approximate convex shape, the most accurate PISA formula for calculating Q across a valve should be different from that for a <b>planar</b> <b>model.</b> We evaluated variations of PISA formula in a <b>planar</b> <b>model</b> and two convex-shaped models. MethodsThree circular orifice diameters (Ø= 5. 2, 8, 12 mm) on hemispherical bails (diameter, D= 38 and 58 mm) and one <b>planar</b> <b>model</b> were studied in a constant flow system (Fig. 1). The radii (A and B) of PISA were measured in axial and transverse views. Flow velocity and actual Q across orifices were varied from 0. 3 – 7. 7 m/s and 0. 9 – 8. 6 l/min, respectively. Results 1) B/A ratios were dependent on actual Q and orifice sizes. 2) B/A ratios were significantly larger for convex models than for a <b>planar</b> <b>model</b> at actual Q below 5 l/min (p< 0. 001) (Fig. 2 shows data for orifice Ø= 8 mm at aliasing velocity between 15 and 30 cm/s). 3) In a convex model (D= 38 mm), B/A ratios for orifices Ø= 5. 2, 8, 12 mm at actual Q= 1. 5 l/min were 1. 35 ± 0. 07, 1. 62 ± 0. 07 and 1. 85 ± 0. 08, respectively (p< 0. 001). The D= 58 mm convex model demonstrated similar results. ConclusionThe shape of PISA for a convex surface is less hemispherical than for a planar surface. Decreased axial radius is partially compensated for by increased transverse radius. Since precise orifice geometry is often unknown clinically, measurement of both PISA axial and transverse radii is important to minimize under-estimation of regurgitant or stenotic flo...|$|E

Chapter 2 introduces the process of electroporation, the technique widely employed to engineer cells and introduced therein foreign materials, {{with the help of an}} electrical treatment. In particular, the most accepted theory to explain the process of pore formation process, the so-called transient aqueous pore model, is presented. The limitations of both the technique and conventional set-ups are also discussed: its low success rate, and the need to employ high-voltage sources. Potential approaches to remediate this are finally proposed. Firstly, microfluidic systems can be used instead of conventional mL-capacity set-ups to enhance both the control on the electroporation process and its yield, while employing milder electrical conditions.
