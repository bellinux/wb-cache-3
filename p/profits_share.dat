5000|$|Because {{the manager}} is {{compensated}} with a profits {{interest in the}} fund, the bulk of its income from the fund is taxed, not as compensation for services, but as a return on investment. Typically, when a partner receives a profits interest (commonly {{referred to as a}} [...] "carried interest"), the partner is not taxed upon receipt, due to the difficulty of ascertaining the present value of an interest in future profits. Instead, the partner is taxed as the partnership earns income. In the case of a hedge fund, this means that the partner defers taxation on the income that the hedge fund earns, which is typically ordinary income (or possibly short-term capital gains), {{due to the nature of}} the investments most hedge funds make. Private equity funds, however, typically invest on a longer horizon, with the result thatincome earned by the funds is long-term capital gain, taxable to individuals at a maximum 20% rate. Because the 20% <b>profits</b> <b>share</b> typically is the bulk of the manager’s compensation, and because this compensation can reach, in the case of the most successful funds, enormous figures, concern has been raised, both in Congress and in the media, that managers are taking advantage of tax loopholes to receive what is effectively a salary without paying the ordinary 39.6% marginal income tax rates that an average person would have to pay on such income. [...] To address this concern, Congressman Sander M. Levin introduced , which would eliminate the ability of persons performing investment adviser or similar services to partnerships to receive capital gains tax treatment on their income. However, the Treasury Department has suggested, both in testimony before the Senate FinanceCommittee and in public speaking engagements, that altering the tax treatment of a single industry raises tax policy concerns, and that changing the way partnerships in general are taxed is something that should only be done after careful consideration of the potential impact.|$|E

40|$|Specifying {{the labour}} theory {{of value in}} a way that distinguishes both {{productive}} from unproductive labour, and production workers from supervisory workers, this paper considers distributive shares in the US economy between 1964 and 2001. Trends in productive and unproductive labour are explored in full-time equivalents, hours and money. After 1979, there was a large shift of money value (not matched by a shift in either hours or employment) from the wages paid to productive labour to those paid to supervisory labour. Since the wage share in money value added of non-supervisory labour in unproductive sectors was approximately constant, the 1980 s and 1990 s also saw the <b>profits</b> <b>share</b> squeezed by the rising wage share of supervisory workers. Some implications of this are explored in the construction of a class rather than a factor approach to distributive shares. Copyright 2006, Oxford University Press. ...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{argues that}} prior studies {{investigating}} {{the determinants of}} <b>profit</b> <b>sharing</b> plan adoption fail to consider the effect of current earnings changes on future expected compensation payments under <b>profit</b> <b>sharing</b> that underlie the success of <b>profit</b> <b>sharing</b> in motivating employees. When current earnings changes are caused by factors that make earnings too volatile then the payments under <b>profit</b> <b>sharing</b> are volatile and their predictability is reduced. In this situation, <b>profit</b> <b>sharing</b> {{is not expected to}} be successful in motivating employees and would not be a preferred means of compensation. In contrast, if earnings changes are caused by factors that produce more sustainable effects on earnings, rendering them more reliable and predictable, then compensation payments under <b>profit</b> <b>sharing</b> will be more predictable and representative of employees' efforts. In this case, <b>profit</b> <b>sharing</b> would be more successful in motivating employees and {{is more likely to be}} adopted as a preferred compensation scheme. Accordingly, it is hypothesized that a positive association exists between the level of permanence of current earnings changes and the adoption of <b>profit</b> <b>sharing</b> plans. Permanence of earnings changes is measured by the level of earnings persistence which is computed using two alternative time-series models: IMA (1, 1) and ARIMA (2, 1, 0). A Logit model is used to evaluate the effect of earnings persistence and control variables on the probability of adoption of employee <b>profit</b> <b>sharing</b> plans. <b>Profit</b> <b>sharing</b> data is extracted from the U.

40|$|This article {{addresses}} {{an important}} trend in contemporary income inequality—a decline in labor’s share of national income and {{a rise in}} capitalists ’ <b>profits</b> <b>share.</b> Since the late 1970 s, labor’s share declined by 6 percent across the U.

As I will show, this overall decline was due to a large decline (5 to 14 percent) in construction, manufacturing, and transportation combined with an increase, albeit small (2 to 5 percent), in labor’s share within finance and services industries. To explain the overall decline and the diverse trends across industries, I argue that the main factor leading to the decline in labor’s share was the erosion in workers ’ positional power, and this erosion was partly an outcome of classbiased technological change, namely computerization that favored employers over most employees. I combine data from several sources to test for the independent effects of workers’ positional power indicators (i. e., unionization, capital concentration, import penetration, and unemployment) and the direct and indirect effects of computer technology on changes in labor’s share within 43 nonagricultural private industries and 451 manufacturing industries between 1969 and 2007.

(Financial Management) Although {{general studies}} have been {{conducted}} on the agency problem, such studies have not focused on the relationship between executive remuneration and company performance. Many of the studies conducted abroad have focused on quantitative methods using regression analysis to understand the relationships between diverse financial performance measures and a variety of performance appraisal techniques. This study aims at establishing the relationship between executive remuneration and company financial performance on the basis of 20 of the largest companies listed on the Johannesburg Stock Exchange Ltd (JSE). It has been observed that JSE-listed South African companies have almost a standard governance framework for determining salary structures of CEOs and directors. Furthermore {{it can be seen that}} most performance-linked payouts for CEO's and directors are based on measurement criteria established which are based on actual performance levels achieved. For this reason, it may be concluded that short-term targets are crucial to keeping a business going, to ensure positive cash flows, manage working capital, and achieve year-on-year growth of revenues and profits. However, to ensure survival and sustainability of the business in the changing global and local environments, long-term strategies should be formulated and various steps should be taken by CEOs, supported by other executive and non-executive directors. This research focuses on short-term goals and their influence on executive remuneration for CEOs and CFOs. The performance measures selected for this study were revenues, <b>profits,</b> <b>share</b> price and net asset value.

Using nationally representative German establishment panel data, we find that firms introducing <b>profit</b> <b>sharing</b> do not reduce base wages thus implying a supplementary character of <b>profit</b> <b>sharing.</b> To account for selection on observable as well as unobservable characteristics, we apply a matched difference-in-differences approach...|$|R
40|$|Recent {{policies}} {{designed to}} promote <b>profit</b> <b>sharing</b> in Great Britain are surveyed. Evidence {{on the extent of}} <b>profit</b> <b>sharing</b> in Britain is presented, and the economic impact of such schemes is assessed. It is found that there is little strong evidence to support the notion that <b>profit</b> <b>sharing</b> significantly improves either employment, profitability, productivity, investment or remuneration...|$|R
40|$|Examinations on the {{determinants}} of <b>profit</b> <b>sharing</b> usually focus on objective firm characteristics. Using data from manufacturing firms in Germany, this study shows that managers' subjective attitudes towards <b>profit</b> <b>sharing</b> also {{play an important role}} in the adoption and termination of this payment scheme. Positive management attitudes are associated with an increased likelihood of adopting <b>profit</b> <b>sharing.</b> While to some extent this entails failed experimentation, positive managerial attitudes also substantially contribute to a sustained use of <b>profit</b> <b>sharing.</b> The pattern of results holds even when controlling for a variety of objective firm characteristics...|$|R
40|$|Using panel {{data from}} a large sample of Canadian establishments, the authors examine whether there is any link between {{adoption}} of an employee profit-sharing plan and subsequent employee earnings. Overall, growth in employee earnings during the five-year period subsequent to adoption of <b>profit</b> <b>sharing</b> was significantly higher in establishments that had adopted <b>profit</b> <b>sharing,</b> as compared with those establishments that had not done so. Employees in establishments that paid high wages before <b>profit</b> <b>sharing</b> adoption appeared to benefit more than employees in other establishments, although employees in other establishments did eventually benefit from <b>profit</b> <b>sharing...</b>|$|R
