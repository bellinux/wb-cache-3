2500|$|Chicago Union Station {{is a major}} {{railroad}} station that opened in 1925 in Chicago, Illinois, replacing an earlier station built in 1881. [...] It is the only remaining intercity rail terminal in Chicago, {{as well as being}} the city's <b>primary</b> <b>terminal</b> for commuter trains. [...] The station stands {{on the west side of}} the Chicago River between West Adams Street and West Jackson Boulevard, just outside the Chicago Loop. Including approach and storage tracks, it is about nine and a half city blocks in size. [...] Its facilities are mostly underground, buried beneath streets and skyscrapers.|$|E
2500|$|By the 1990s {{several miles}} of routes and {{facilities}} were abandoned or sold to regional rail companies. GTW would eliminate {{all of the}} former Pontiac Oxford and Northern line north of General Motors' Lake Orion manufacturing plant by 1985. In 1987 the former Cincinnati, Saginaw, and Mackinaw and the former Detroit, Grand Haven, and Milwaukee routes north of Durand were sold to the Central Michigan Railway. [...] Elsdon Yard, GTW's <b>primary</b> <b>terminal</b> and rail yard in Chicago had been downsized and closed by 1990. It had also sold almost the entire route of the Detroit, Toledo and Ironton in 1997 to the shortline rail operator Railtex. By 1998 it had abandoned the entire former Michigan Air Line route except for a portion in Oakland County, Michigan it sold to Coe Rail. With the end of SEMTA commuter rail service to Downtown Detroit in 1983 GTW abandoned and sold its trackage from the Milwaukee Junction area to downtown Detroit. That line was the former route to Brush Street Station and its railcar ferry dock on the Detroit River. It {{is known as the}} Dequindre Cut which has been transformed into an urban greenway rail trail. By the year 2000 engine terminals and maintenance facilities had also been eliminated or downsized in Chicago, Detroit, Durand, Pontiac, Port Huron and Battle Creek.|$|E
60|$|As far as I {{could make}} out, the bifid {{processes}} are {{developed in the}} same manner as the quadrifids, excepting that the two <b>primary</b> <b>terminal</b> cells never become divided, and only increase in length. The glands on the valve and collar appear at so early an age that I could not trace their development; but we may reasonably suspect that they are developed from papillae like those on the outside of the bladder, but with their terminal cells not divided into two. The two segments forming the pedicels of the glands probably answer to the conical protuberance and short footstalk of the quadrifid and bifid processes. I am strengthened in the belief that the glands are developed from papillae like those on the outside of the bladders, from the fact that in Utricularia amethystina the glands extend along the whole ventral surface of the bladder close to the footstalk.|$|E

5000|$|Synchronous Data Link Control (SDLC) was {{originally}} designed to connect one computer with multiple peripherals. The original [...] "normal response mode" [...] is a master-slave mode where the computer (or <b>primary</b> <b>terminal)</b> gives each peripheral (secondary terminal) permission to speak in turn. Because all communication is either to or from the <b>primary</b> <b>terminal,</b> frames include only one address, that of the secondary terminal; the <b>primary</b> <b>terminal</b> is not assigned an address. There is no strong distinction between commands sent by the primary to a secondary, and responses sent by a secondary to the primary. Commands and responses are in fact indistinguishable; {{the only difference is}} the direction in which they are transmitted.|$|E

40|$|Sensory {{information}} {{transmitted to}} the spinal cord dorsal horn is modulated by a complex network of excitatory and inhibitory interneurons. The two main inhibitory transmitters, GABA and glycine, control the flow of sensory information mainly by regulating the excitability of dorsal horn neurons. A presynaptic action of GABA has also been proposed as an important modulatory mechanism of transmitter release from sensory <b>primary</b> afferent <b>terminals.</b> By inhibiting the release of glutamate from <b>primary</b> afferent <b>terminals,</b> activation of presynaptic GABA receptors could {{play an important role}} in nociceptive and tactile sensory coding, while changes in their expression or function could be involved in pathological pain conditions, such as allodynia...|$|R

30|$|Since polarimetric {{diversity}} {{does not}} allow a perfect orthogonality between primary and secondary nodes' transmissions, its use is possible under {{the application of a}} so-called underlay paradigm [10, 22, 23]. This means that both cognitive and <b>primary</b> <b>terminals</b> carry out communications, provided that the capacity loss caused by cognitive users does not degrade communication quality for primary users. For this purpose, we can further characterize the underlaid paradigm by requiring that the primary system must be guaranteed a minimum (transmission) capacity during a large fraction of time. As will be shown, this can, in turn, be formulated as a probabilistic coexistence problem under the constraint of a limited outage probability in the primary network.|$|R
40|$|The {{amino acid}} {{glutamate}} is today {{regarded as the}} main fast excitatory neurotransmitter in {{the central nervous system}} and a large body of evidence support that glutamate serves as a neurotransmitter in <b>primary</b> afferent <b>terminals</b> in the spinal cord. Previous evidence also suggests that the closely related amino acid aspartate may serve a similar role in some <b>primary</b> afferent <b>terminals.</b> However, the present quantitative analysis of aspartate immunogold labeling show that <b>primary</b> afferent <b>terminals</b> in both the superficial and deep laminae of the dorsal horn contain only low levels of aspartate. Further, whereas glutamate immunogold labeling density demonstrated a positive correlation with synaptic vesicle density in <b>primary</b> afferent <b>terminals,</b> no such correlation was evident in aspartate immunogold labeled sections. Thus, aspartate is likely to serve a metabolic role but not a neurotransmitter role in <b>primary</b> afferent <b>terminals.</b> Immunolabeling of spinal cord sections with antisera against the vesicular glutamate transporters VGLUT 1 and VGLUT 2 showed distribution patterns of immunolabeled varicosities consistent with an expression of mainly VGLUT 2 in small caliber primary afferent fibers and of mainly VGLUT 1 in large caliber primary afferent fibers. The latter suggestion was confirmed by demonstration of VGLUT 1 in anterogradely labeled varicosities originating from large caliber primary afferent fibers. VGLUT 1 was also detected in fibers of the corticospinal tract and in small varicosities in the spinal grey matter likely to originate from these fibers. VGLUT 2 immunolabeled varicosities were distributed throughout the spinal gray matter. In addition to an origin from small caliber primary afferent fibers, such varicosities are likely to originate from intraspinal and bulbospinal neurons. The signals transmitted by <b>primary</b> afferent <b>terminals</b> are relayed through projections neurons via the thalamus to the cerebral cortex. In the context of pain, the trigeminal projection to the thalamic nucleus submedius is of particular interest, as it in contrast to other spino- an trigeminothalamic projections in rats include a significant component originating in lamina I. Glutamate and aspartate immunogold labeling demonstrate that the terminals of the trigeminal projection to the nucleus submedius are enriched in glutamate but contain only low levels of aspartate. Further, the glutamate signal in these terminals, but not that of aspartate, is positively correlated with the synaptic vesicle density. Thus, glutamate is likely to serve as a neurotransmitter in trigeminothalamic tract terminals in the nucleus submedius, whereas aspartate presumably serves metabolic functions in the same terminals. A neurotransmitter role of glutamate in these terminals is also substantiated by the localization of VGLUT 2 in most such terminals. VGLUT 1 in the nucleus submedius is primarily located in terminals likely to originate in the ventral lateral orbital cortex...|$|R
