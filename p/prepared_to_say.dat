25|$|Stevens, in {{his initial}} draft, {{expressed}} great {{concern with the}} possibility that an individual might be liable for copyright infringement for copying a single program in his own home, and for his own use. At the same time, Justice Brennan was wavering on affirming based {{on the presence of}} non-infringing uses of the technology—but Brennan was not <b>prepared</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> that making home copies for repeated personal use did not constitute an infringement. Justice White, noting Brennan's position, suggested that Stevens shift the basis of his opinion away from arguments about whether home-use was, in fact, an infringement. White pointed out that the issue need not be resolved, because the suit was not against home-users, but against the producers of the technology that enabled them.|$|E

Stories about child molesters and his own experiences as a parent inspired series writer Don McGill to write the episode.|$|R
25|$|Traditional phonics {{instruction}} {{can also}} have the unintended consequence of promoting dysfluency. The difficulty lies in the coarticulated nature of speech; speech sounds are overlapping, while print is discrete and sequential. This can be appreciated if one shapes the mouth in position to begin to produce the word cat compared to the word cot. The initial hard c is colored by the subsequent vowel even before speech begins, i.e., the smiling position as one <b>prepares</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> cat, and the more limp position as one <b>prepares</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> cot. As early readers work from left to right, beginning with the onset consonant, they typically {{do not yet know}} the vowel with which it must be coarticulated. The vowel sound itself cannot be known until the remaining rime (the portion of the syllable beginning with the vowel and extending to its end: e.g. ight in right) is fully encountered. For these reasons, teaching reading through orientation to rime first and then adding the onset (ought-bought) can be helpful in promoting fluency through supporting the phonological problems of coarticulation. Emphasis on the rime also supports the development of an intuitive, and therefore more fluent, awareness of orthographic patterns.|$|R

Over the summer of 1977 he continued to warn that insistence on capitulation to the Patriotic Front would produce a white backlash and put negotiations back.|$|E

Tito Gobbi said, [...] "Now she was not only supremely gifted both musically and dramatically—she was a beauty too. And her awareness of this invested with fresh magic every role she undertook.

2500|$|In January 2008, it was {{announced}} that Lords had been cast in Kevin Smith's comedy Zack and Miri Make a Porno (2008). She said that at first she wanted to refuse but changed her mind after reading the script. [...] "It was really great that in taking the movie, because I didn't plan on going back to work right away, but I was dying to work with Kevin. I never thought it would be on something called Zack and Miri Make a Porno. What? So I went and I read the script at his house and I was <b>prepared</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> no. I thought I have the perfect out. I just had a kid. No one is going to blame me if I say I just can't do this right now. But it made me laugh out loud and it made me just literally cry.

Katie Morgan, another former pornographic actress, also appeared in the film.|$|E
2500|$|The leading Defence counsel Sir Frederick Geoffrey Lawrence, QC, {{had been}} briefed by the Medical Defence Union with the {{additional}} task of obtaining a ruling on whether medical treatments that might shorten {{the life of a}} terminally ill patient were legal. Lawrence, a [...] "specialist in real estate and divorce cases [...] a relative stranger in criminal court", who was defending his first murder trial, convinced the jury that {{there was no evidence that}} a murder had been committed, much less that a murder had been committed by Adams. He emphasised that the indictment was based mainly on testimonies from the nurses who tended Morrell – and that none of the witnesses' evidence matched the others'. Then, on the second day of the trial, he produced notebooks written by the nurses, detailing Adams' treatment of Morrell. The prosecution claimed never to have seen these notebooks (even though they are recorded in pretrial lists of evidence). These differed from the nurses' recollection of events, and showed that smaller quantities of drugs were given to the patient than the prosecution had thought, based on Adams' prescriptions. Furthermore, the prosecution's two expert medical witnesses gave differing opinions: Arthur Douthwaite was <b>prepared</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> that murder had definitely been committed (though he changed his mind in the middle of his testimony regarding the exact date), but Michael Ashby was more reticent. The defence witness and physician John Harman was adamant that Adams's treatment, though unusual, was not reckless. Finally, the prosecution was wrong-footed by the defence not calling the loquacious Adams to give evidence, and thereby avoiding him [...] "chatting himself to the gallows". This was unexpected, shocking the prosecution and the press, and even surprising the judge.|$|E

However, picture naming latencies were not affected by beliefs about what one's partner said, as {{it did not matter}} whether participants believed their partner produced the same utterance, or an utterance that differed by ordering (Experiments 1 and 2) or lexical content (Experiments 3 and 4).

50|$|Father Drumgoole used {{to divide}} {{his time between}} the Mission's {{facilities}} in Manhattan and at Mount Loretto. On Sunday, March 11, 1888, he boarded a Staten Island Rapid Transit train at the Pleasant Plains station, very near the orphanage, and rode it to the ferry to Manhattan at St. George. Upon arriving he found that no ferries were running, because the Great Blizzard of 1888 had begun and was causing wind gusts that may have exceeded 80 miles per hour in some places. To return to Mount Loretto, he hired a horse and gig and drove through blizzard. Though he arrived safely, he soon developed a cold that later progressed to pneumonia, even though he continued to work.
