40|$|Indonesia {{has a lot}} of {{potential}} oil and gas, from all wells contained at least 125 oil fields. Crude oil production process produces CO 2 emission which can increase pollution in the atmosphere. CO 2 emission in the atmosphere can be reduced with CCS or Carbon Capture and Storage. CCS is an application to reduce CO 2 emission and greenhouse effect. CCS is a useful application of technology to reduce CO 2 emissions in the atmosphere. CO 2 injected into the injection wells to push oil trapped productive wells. CCS consists of three main stages: (1) capturing process of CO 2 from its sources; (2) transporting the compressed CO 2 through <b>pipes,</b> <b>trucks,</b> and ships; (3) storage stage or storing CO 2 which is injected into subsurface rock formation or using unproductive wells. CO 2 produced in the combustion process can be used in Enhanced Oil Recovery (EOR). EOR is a technology used to increase oil production in oil field production decreased. EOR itself, consists of several processes including all methods that use energy sources and other useful materials to increase oil production that are no longer manufactured, economically. EOR consists of 4 main methods that waterflooding, Thermal Methods, Chemical Methods, and miscible Methods. In injection process, CO 2 can be monitored in post- injection using Microgravity Method to prevent leakage and groundwater pollution, and to know density difference from each layer regularly. Based on the result of literature study about CCS and EOR, so that this method is very proper to be applied in Indonesia. Especially with the presence of refinery which produce CO 2 emission and the presence of old wells which can be used as storage place. It is expected as way to decrease environmental impacts and to increase hydrocarbon productivity...|$|R

40|$|Ennis-McMillan (2006 : 129) {{refers to}} fresh water as “a {{resource}} that countries {{can no longer}} take for granted”. An inadequate water supply, {{commonly referred to as}} waterscarcity, {{is the result of a}} complex, causal relationship between the environment and human water consumption. The interactions between the two can generate water pollution, water scarcity, and unequal water distribution on a global scale (Ennis- McMillan 2006). Jordan has repeatedly been labelled a water-scarce nation (Allan 2001; bint Talal 2004; Faruqui 2001; Gleick 1993; Iskandarani 2001). Strategies to overcome water-scarcity in Jordan have included demand management policies and international aid development projects. This thesis is based on the follow-up study of Project Rainkeep; a small-scale development pilot project intended to be a solution to water-scarcity with the reintroduction of rainwater collection in cisterns for domestic use. The project brought physical enhancements to existing cisterns and encouraged households to once again rely on rainwater collection to support their domestic water budget. The orientation guiding the research has been to ask: Did a development project alleviate suffering from water-scarcity and alter household water-management practices with the re-introduction of rainwater harvesting in village homes in Jordan? In short, the development project did not affect that which it sought to alleviate, in part because waterscarcity was not seen as a problem for households due to a cultural of water-sharing, but there were other positive outcomes for households. In the exploration into the affects of Project Rainkeep, ‘regional political ecology’ has been adopted as the meta-theory. The research has been further broken down into three key areas of investigation: little traditions such as local level water-management, expert knowledge such as the state and Islam, and water-scarcity. Some of the main research questions have been: v 1. How does a household negotiate access to and usage of a necessary but scarce resource? 2. What roles do great traditions of the state, development and Islam play in watermanagement? 3. How does knowledge about water availability affect the practice of watermanagement? Data has been collected qualitatively through the use of semi-structured interviews conducted at the local level from project households and at the national level from watermanagement professionals. In addition, a literature review of key concepts such as local and expert knowledge, state water-management, the role of Islam, globalization and development, and water-scarcity has been conducted. Some of the principal findings have been that coping with water-scarcity at the household level incorporated a threefold strategy to access water publicly, privately and locally through <b>pipes,</b> water <b>trucks</b> and rainwater harvesting. From a cultural perspective, the importance of sharing, generosity and hospitality were values that led to a willingness to distribute water in the villages. In addition, the traditional gap between development aid and the recipients’ perception of that aid existed. While those who worked to implement the project were unsatisfied with the project results and deemed Project Rainkeep a failure those who had their domestic cistern restored expressed gratitude and hope for future aid. It has been difficult to ascertain whether or not Islam played a role in water-management. </p...|$|R
40|$|Includes bibliographical references. The {{shortage}} {{of water in}} the Middle East is currently not acute, but it is expected to be more acute in the following twenty years, as water resources are limited, compared to the projected number of population. Consequently, if solutions to the water problems are not reached at this time, conflicts over water are likely to increase tension and create wars in the future. In the past, all plans which have been submitted to the disputing parties from different sources have failed because the riparian states were at war with one another, and henceforth a benefit to one was invariably regarded as a loss to the other. Then, Arab states and Israel started to implement their own water projects in an attempt to protect their rights in using their water resources. These attempts made the situation worse, and among other repercussions, caused the outbreak of the 1967 Arab-Israeli war. As a result, Israel annexed more lands and increased its water supply by forty percent. However, the indications from the on-going peace negotiations between the Arabs and the Israelis show potentials for the settlement of the water conflict as it is evident in the case of Jordan and Israel. Despite its small size compared to other international rivers, the Jordan River and its tributaries were subject to conflict between Syria, Jordan, Lebanon, Israel, and the Palestinians. The Jordan water constituted an important source to the livelihood of the Palestinian and the Israeli farmers. While the Israelis considered agriculture and water {{as an integral part of}} the economic ideology in Zionist thought to attach and incite the jews to return to their homeland, the Palestinians felt that they were being denied on purpose the lands to which they were tied. In fact, the Zionist policy to bring Jewish immigrants from Europe, Asia, Africa, and America to Israel was largely successful. Water is not important to the Israelis and the Palestinians only, but also to the Syrians, the Jordanians, and the Lebanese. The 1967 war had dramatic effects on Jordan. Hundreds of thousands of Palestinian refugees settled in the East Jordan Valley causing a sharp increase in demand for water in Jordan. While some specialists in water issues believe that Lebanon has surplus water that should be distributed to other countries, others contradicted these beliefs and reported that Lebanon is really in need of its water to produce electricity and to increase the irrigated land in the South and the Beqaa. Syria depended heavily on the waters of the Euphrates River. But, as a result of its conflict with Turkey, Syria had to depend more on the waters of the Jordan River as the water situation in the country was becoming more critical. Israel has been accused on many occasions of stealing the waters of the Litany River through canals, <b>pipes,</b> and by <b>trucks.</b> Such accusations, however, were not verified at all times. Other charges were leveled at Israel, accusing it of tying its withdrawal from the Golan Heights, West Bank, Gaza Strip, and South Lebanon with water concessions from concerned Arab states. Questions regarding the legality of diverting water outside the basins of the Jordan River were debatable from an international law point of view. In contrast to the Jordan River, the Litani River was recognized as a national and domestic river. Still, Israeli water experts reported that the basin of the Litani River is connected underground to that of the Hasbani River which is one of the tributaries of the Jordan River. Thus, the Litani River, according to the Israelis, should form part of the Jordan River. There are indications that the disputing parties may move towards an overall solution to the Middle East water problem. With the achievement of peace, it is expected that the riparian states would increase water resources by resorting to modem scientific methods such as desalination, collection and re-use of wastewaters, brackish water for irrigation, damming of seasonal streams, and importation of water from humid regions. However, when all is said and done about the improvement, distribution, and the utilization of water resources, the fact remains that the Middle East is a semi-arid region, and that ultimately, if the problems of water resources are to be resolved, the explosion of the population has to be controlled. Such control would mean a lower birth rate among the Arabs and a limitation to immigration to Israel. 1 bound copy: 112 p.; map available at RNL...|$|R
