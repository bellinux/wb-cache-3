40|$|Increasing {{importance}} is {{being placed on}} gas and particulate emissions to the atmosphere from livestock production systems. These emissions include ammonia, small particulates (<PM 2. 5), volatile organics, hydrogen sulfide, and the greenhouse gases, methane and nitrous oxide. Livestock systems are estimated to produce over 70 % of the ammonia entering the atmosphere as well as major portions of the other emissions. With <b>price</b> <b>tags</b> <b>of</b> many billions being placed on cost of these emissions to society, efforts at minimization by the industry are prudent.

50|$|In 2007, Postilio was at {{the center}} of a story that made {{international}} headlines about the astronomical pricing for parking spaces in New York City. Based on the sale and waiting list for parking spaces in the basement of a boutique luxury condominium project at 246 West 17th Street in Manhattan's pricey Chelsea neighborhood, the record <b>price</b> <b>tags</b> <b>of</b> $275,000 were compared to the cost of cars, home values, and income levels around the world. Still, the cost of such spaces was justified as valuable by residents and industry economists based on the lack of available parking in the city and a decline in the number of parking garages in New York City. As of late 2014, prices for some parking spaced in Manhattan have exceeded $1 million.|$|R

A comparison of the mean values showed that yellow <b>price</b> <b>tags</b> influence the reference price and, moreover, a yellow <b>price</b> <b>tag</b> increased the reference price.

30|$|Although many {{traffic flow}} {{patterns}} could exist, {{it is widely}} believed that people seek to minimize their individual travel cost/time which results in a user equilibrium (UE) traffic pattern. Unfortunately, the UE is not the best pattern as far as the total costs of the transport system (the entire road network) are concerned. The “best” traffic pattern is the one at which the costs of the entire transport system are minimized, referred to as the system optimal (SO). The traffic congestion can be defined and formulated as “minimization {{of the cost of the}} system” that is to forcing the traffic pattern from UE to SO. To do so, congestion pricing is a plausible approach. It is mathematically proved [16] that the <b>price</b> <b>tags</b> <b>of</b> the roads are their respective marginal costs. Accordingly, the UE turns to the SO. The marginal cost can represent some externality costs such as pollutions and inequity [17]. From a mathematical point of view, it is easy to identify the marginal costs of the roads [16].|$|R
