5|$|Copper {{is one of}} a few {{metallic}} elements with {{a natural}} color other than gray or silver. <b>Pure</b> <b>copper</b> is orange-red and acquires a reddish tarnish when exposed to air. The characteristic color of copper results from the electronic transitions between the filled 3d and half-empty 4s atomic shells – the energy difference between these shells corresponds to orange light.|$|E
5|$|The cent was {{the first}} {{official}} United States coin to be struck at the Philadelphia Mint in 1793. These pieces, today known as large cents, were made of <b>pure</b> <b>copper</b> and were {{about the size of}} a half dollar. They were struck every year, except 1815 due to a shortage of metal, but were slow to become established in commerce. Worn Spanish colonial silver pieces were then commonly used as money throughout the United States. At the time, both gold and silver were legal tender there, but copper coins were not; the federal government would not redeem them or take them in payment of taxes.|$|E
5|$|John Lavender of {{the local}} Red House Museum noted {{evidence}} of small iron-ore smelting hearths on Warren Hill, while green vitreous slag has been also found on the Head. In his 1911 to 1912 excavations, Bushe-Fox found evidence for working of lead, copper and silver; two ingots discovered at this time revealed that raw materials would have been imported to the area. One ingot was of nearly <b>pure</b> <b>copper,</b> while the other, which weighed 8.6kg, was roughly 50/50 copper-silver alloy with around one percent gold. Argentiferous (i.e. silver-bearing) copper was refined to produce silver at the Head. There are also indications that gold was worked at Hengistbury. One excavation produced part of a torc, twisted together with a small gold bracelet and another fragment in a manner suggesting it was scrap; a different site produced a streaked touchstone indicating use in gold testing.|$|E
50|$|A copper mine {{opened on}} Temagami Island in 1954 called Temagami Mine. It {{produced}} 34,000,000 dollars Canadian {{and was considered}} to mine the <b>purest</b> <b>copper</b> ore in Canada. The mine closed in 1972.|$|R
5000|$|It was {{important}} to find a name that retained the acronym [...] "MCM" [...] after privatization, because MCM is the London Metal Exchange listed name for copper produced at Mufulira Refinery. Mufulira copper is considered amongst the <b>purest</b> <b>copper</b> in the world.|$|R
25|$|Whitehouse {{still felt}} able to ignore Thomson's many {{suggestions}} and proposals. It {{was not until}} Thomson convinced the board that using <b>purer</b> <b>copper</b> for replacing the lost section of cable would improve data capacity, that he first made a difference to {{the execution of the}} project.|$|R
5|$|After her obverse {{design was}} approved, Goodacre visited the Philadelphia Mint {{engraving}} department {{six times in}} order to finalize the designs. Rogers' reverse design was also modified before production began. In his original proposal, mountainous scenery was depicted beneath the flying eagle; this was removed and the positions of other reverse design features were altered before Rubin gave final approval. The composition selected for the new coin included a cladding of manganese brass (containing about 77% copper, 12% zinc, 7% manganese, and 4% nickel) over a <b>pure</b> <b>copper</b> core. This composition was chosen because it would give the coin a distinctive golden color while being electromagnetically identical to its predecessor, the copper-nickel Susan B. Anthony dollar. The first official striking of the Sacagawea dollar took place on November 18, 1999, during a ceremony in which dignitaries and other invited guests each struck individual examples of the coins. Because the coins were struck before 2000, it was not legal to release them during the first strike ceremonies. Instead, the coins were saved and later sent to the dignitaries who struck them. Full-scale production began shortly after the ceremonial strikings.|$|E
25|$|Secondly, it {{is capable}} of greater {{work-hardening}} than is the case with <b>pure</b> <b>copper,</b> so that it performs better when used for cutting or chopping. There is an increase in work-hardening capability with increasing percentage of arsenic, and it can be work-hardened over a wide range of temperatures without fear of embrittlement. Its improved properties over <b>pure</b> <b>copper</b> can be seen with as little as 0.5 to 2wt% As, giving a 10 to 30% improvement in hardness and tensile strength.|$|E
25|$|<b>Pure</b> <b>copper.</b> Unlike other metals, copper is {{frequently}} used in its pure (99.9% Cu) unalloyed form for sheet and strip applications in roofing, exterior cladding, and flashing.|$|E
50|$|The {{conductivity}} {{of commercial}} conductors is often expressed {{relative to the}} International Annealed Copper Standard, according to which the <b>purest</b> <b>copper</b> wire available in 1914 measured around 100%. The <b>purest</b> modern <b>copper</b> wire is a better conductor, measuring over 103% on this scale. The gains are from two sources. First, modern <b>copper</b> is more <b>pure.</b> However, this avenue for improvement seems at an end. Making the <b>copper</b> <b>purer</b> still makes no significant improvement. Second, annealing and other processes have been improved. Annealing reduces the dislocations and other crystal defects which are sources of resistance. But the resulting wires are still polycrystalline. The grain boundaries and remaining crystal defects are responsible for some residual resistance. This can be quantified and better understood by examining single crystals.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Pure</b> {{metallic}} <b>copper</b> {{produces a}} very dark red, opaque glass, which is sometimes used {{as a substitute for}} gold in the production of ruby-colored glass.|$|R
50|$|The initial {{product of}} copper {{smelting}} was impure black copper, {{which was then}} repeatedly melted to purify it, alternately oxidizing and reducing it. In one of the melting stages, lead was added. Gold and silver preferentially dissolved in this, thus providing a means of recovering these precious metals. To produce <b>purer</b> <b>copper</b> suitable for making copper plates or hollow-ware, further melting processes were undertaken, using charcoal as fuel. The repeated application of such fire-refining processes was capable of producing copper that was 99.25% pure.|$|R

25|$|High {{levels of}} both copper {{particles}} and arsenic {{were found in}} Ötzi's hair. This, along with Ötzi's copper axe blade, which is 99.7% <b>pure</b> <b>copper,</b> has led scientists to speculate that Ötzi was involved in copper smelting.|$|E

40|$|International audienceMechanistic {{cutting force}} {{modelling}} generally involves coefficients identification from machining tests. In {{order to develop}} multi-material cutting force models avoiding identification, several studies have tried to link cutting forces to mechanical properties from databases, whose relevance remains questionable. In this study, the cutting coefficients obtained by inverse identification from turning tests are compared with properties obtained from several mechanical tests. The correlations show that cutting forces can be estimated, without cutting tests, using hat-shaped shear tests. The originality of the approach is the behaviour proximity of the five machined materials used: thermal and mechanical treated <b>pure</b> <b>coppers,</b> brass and bronze...|$|R
40|$|Pseudopotential {{formalism}} is used {{to construct}} an ionic effective potential (ion-ion potential screened by electrons). Molecular Dynamics is {{used in conjunction with}} the constructed effective potential to get the atomic structure factor of the <b>pure</b> components <b>copper</b> and tin which are compared to the experimental ones. We selected the Shaw Optimized Model Potential having proved that it adequately describes the atomic structure, we used it to calculate the velocity autocorrelation function and to deduce the self diffusion of <b>pure</b> metals: <b>copper,</b> tin and the diffusion coefficient of copper in the Sn 95, 6 %Cu 4, 4 %...|$|R
50|$|The ancient {{lava flows}} of the Keweenaw Peninsula were {{produced}} during the Mesoproterozoic Era {{as a part}} of the Midcontinent Rift. This volcanic activity produced the only strata on Earth where large-scale economically recoverable 97 percent <b>pure</b> native <b>copper</b> is found.|$|R
25|$|For certain applications, {{copper alloy}} {{conductors}} are preferred instead of <b>pure</b> <b>copper,</b> especially when higher strengths or improved abrasion and corrosion resistance properties are required. However, relative to <b>pure</b> <b>copper,</b> the higher strength and corrosion resistance benefits that are offered by copper alloys are offset by their lower electrical conductivities. Design engineers weigh {{the advantages and}} disadvantages of the various types of copper and copper alloy conductors when determining which type to specify for a specific electrical application. An example of a copper alloy conductor is cadmium copper wire, which is used for railroad electrification in North America. In Britain the BPO (later Post Office Telecommunications) used cadmium copper aerial lines with 1% cadmium for extra strength; for local lines 40lb/mile (1.3mm dia) and for toll lines 70lb/mile (1.7mm dia).|$|E
25|$|Brasses, {{which were}} {{frequently}} used for doorknobs and push plates in decades past, also demonstrate bactericidal efficacies, {{but within a}} somewhat longer time frame than <b>pure</b> <b>copper.</b> All nine brasses tested were almost completely bactericidal (over 99.9% kill rate) at 20°C within 60–270 minutes. Many brasses were almost completely bactericidal at 4°C within 180–360 minutes.|$|E
25|$|A well-preserved mummy {{of a man}} {{who lived}} around 3,200 BCE found in the Ötztal Alps, popularly known as Ötzi, showed high levels of both copper {{particles}} and arsenic in its hair. This, along with Ötzi's copper axe blade, which is 99.7% <b>pure</b> <b>copper,</b> has led scientists to speculate that he was involved in copper smelting.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Pure</b> {{metallic}} <b>copper</b> {{produces a}} very dark red, opaque glass. Glass created in this manner is generally [...] "flashed" [...] (laminated glass).

For brazing copper, brass, nickel alloys, Monel, medium and high carbon steels chromium alloys, titanium, zirconium, hafnium.|$|R
60|$|Indeed, Jasper {{was quite}} the caballero. The brig herself was then all black and enigmatical, and very dirty; a {{tarnished}} gem of the sea, or, rather, a neglected work of art. For {{he must have}} been an artist, the obscure builder who had put her body together on lovely lines out of the hardest tropical timber fastened with the <b>purest</b> <b>copper.</b> Goodness only knows in what part of the world she was built. Jasper himself {{had not been able to}} ascertain much of her history from his sententious, saturnine Peruvian--if the fellow was a Peruvian, and not the devil himself in disguise, as Jasper jocularly pretended to believe. My opinion is that she was old enough to have been one of the last pirates, a slaver perhaps, or else an opium clipper of the early days, if not an opium smuggler.|$|R
25|$|The wheat cent was {{mainstream}} {{and common}} during its time. Some dates are rare, but many {{can still be}} found in circulation. This is partially {{due to the fact}} that unlike the formerly silver denominations (dollar, half, quarter, dime), the composition of the pre-1982 cent, nearly <b>pure</b> <b>copper,</b> is not so much more valuable over face value for it to be hoarded to the extreme extent of the silver denominations.|$|E
25|$|Arsenical bronze {{has seen}} little {{use in the}} modern period. It appears that the closest {{equivalent}} {{goes by the name}} of arsenical copper, being defined as copper with under 0.5wt% As, below the accepted percentage in archaeological artefacts. The presence of 0.5wt% arsenic in copper lowers the electrical conductivity to 34% of that of <b>pure</b> <b>copper,</b> and even as little as 0.05wt% decreases it by 15%. Therefore, there is no demand for copper containing arsenic in electric wires etc., one of the major modern uses of copper and steam engine boilers are no longer made from it, leading to no modern use.|$|E
25|$|Copper-plated zinc, 1982–present. In mid-1982, the coin's {{composition}} {{was changed}} again, {{this time to}} copper-plated zinc. The last mostly-copper cents (95% copper metal composition) were produced by the Denver Mint on October 22, 1982. The copper-plated zinc cent coins are still being produced today. They are composed of an inner core alloy of 99.2% zinc and 0.8% copper with an outer plating of <b>pure</b> <b>copper,</b> for an overall composition of 97.5% zinc and 2.5% copper, and are minted on blanks produced for the Mint by an outside manufacturer (Jarden Zinc Products). Except for the new lighter total coin weight of 2.5grams each, these newer coins are identical in diameter and thickness, and nearly in appearance, to the mostly copper (95%) cents issued before mid-1982, which weighed 3.11grams each. A few pennies were struck by error in brass dated 1983 and are extremely rare.|$|E

60|$|On the 24th of February {{my friend}} Mr. Geach left Timor, having finally {{reported}} that no minerals worth working {{were to be}} found. The Portuguese were very much annoyed, having {{made up their minds}} that copper is abundant, and still believing it to be so. It appears that from time immemorial <b>pure</b> native <b>copper</b> has been found at a place on the coast about thirty miles east of Delli.|$|R
25|$|In {{an effort}} to gain {{acceptance}} for the new composition, the Mint distributed approximately three dozen examples to {{various members of the}} House Banking and Currency Committee and the Senate Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs Committee. Nine congressmen and four senators received examples, along with some Treasury officials. Additional specimens were given out by then Mint Director Mary Brooks. Ultimately, the proposal was rejected in Congress, due mainly to the efforts of the copper-mining and vending machine industries, which felt the coins would cause mechanical problems. Opposition also came from pediatricians and pediatric radiologists who pointed out the radiodensity of the metal inside the respiratory and gastrointestinal tracts was close to that of soft tissue, and therefore would be difficult to detect in X-ray imaging. In addition, the price of copper declined enough that making copper cents would again be economically viable, and conversely made hoarding pointless. The idea of changing the composition of the cent would not be explored again until the 1980s. In 1982, the composition of the coin was changed to the current 99.2% zinc and 0.8% copper core alloy with a plating of <b>pure</b> <b>copper,</b> resulting in a 20% weight reduction.|$|E
500|$|Copper is a {{chemical}} element with symbol Cu (from [...] ) and atomic number 29. It is a soft, malleable, and ductile metal with very high thermal and electrical conductivity. A freshly exposed surface of <b>pure</b> <b>copper</b> has a reddish-orange color. Copper {{is used as}} a conductor of heat and electricity, as a building material, and as a constituent of various metal alloys, such as sterling silver used in jewelry, cupronickel used to make marine hardware and coins, and constantan used in strain gauges and thermocouples for temperature measurement.|$|E
500|$|The Treasury {{conducted}} extensive research, and in May 1965 {{concluded that}} the nation could not go on using so much silver in its coinage. [...] It decided on clad coinage, with copper-nickel faces and a <b>pure</b> <b>copper</b> core, as the most desirable replacement material. [...] Such a composition would work in place of silver in vending machines, which would not require wholesale adjustment. [...] Copper and nickel were readily available, and the melt value of the new coins would be much under face value. The material was hard, allowing the designs to remain recognizable for long periods, and other nations, such as the United Kingdom, had transitioned from silver to copper-nickel coins. The Mint conducted lengthy test runs, and did not experience production problems.|$|E
