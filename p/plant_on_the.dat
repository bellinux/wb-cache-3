5|$|A 2009 {{study of}} tansy beetle {{occupancy}} amongst 1305 patches (stems separated by {{no more than}} 50cm) of the tansy <b>plant</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> banks of the River Ouse (York, UK) intended to establish data on the distribution of tansy plants and relate this to existing tansy beetle populations in order to contribute to the conservation effort of the species. The results were analysed using generalised additive models to conclude that the tansy patches should be managed towards volumes of 3m and that these patches should be targeted within 200m of existing beetle subpopulations on the same river bank in order to help the beetle population disperse and survive.|$|E

The farm crisis of the 1980s hit Davenport {{and the rest of}} the Quad Cities hard, with high unemployment and financial hardships. 35,000 workers lost their jobs throughout the entire Quad Cities area. The Caterpillar <b>Plant</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> cities north side closed, causing many jobs to be lost.|$|E
5|$|Most of North Island is {{dominated}} by chenopod shrubs, generally less than a metre (3ft) high. The beach vegetation is largely Spinifex longifolius (beach spinifex), Salsola kali (prickly saltwort), Atriplex cinerea (grey saltbush) and naturalised Cakile maritima (sea rocket). Stable dunes are vegetated by Atriplex paludosa (marsh saltbush), Scaevola crassifolia (thick-leaved fan-flower), Olearia axillaris (coastal daisy-bush), Myoporum insulare (blueberry tree) and Exocarpos sparteus (broom ballart). Sheltered areas behind dunes support Salsola kali and Myoporum insulare and also Nitraria billardierei (nitre bush), the last of these being the only <b>plant</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> island to grow over m (5ft) high. In areas where limestone {{is close to the}} surface, the vegetation consists of Pimelea microcephala (shrubby rice-flower), Spyridium globulosum (basket bush) and Acanthocarpus preissii.|$|E

5|$|Now {{returning}} to its pre-Kensington route, NY33 follows a six-lane, divided Genesee Street past the airport {{on one side}} and numerous associated businesses such as hotels and fast food restaurants on the other. The large aerospace contractor Calspan has its headquarters here, and Westinghouse once operated a large industrial lathe <b>plant</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> airport side of the road (it was torn down when the airport was rebuilt in the late 1990s). Beyond the airport, the divider ends, the travel lanes are reduced to four and, after a short curve and minimal descent, NY33 intersects Transit Road (NY78) and enters the town of Lancaster. After this junction, the highway becomes a two-lane route once again through the small hamlet of Bowmansville, where it crosses Ellicott Creek near some rapids.|$|E
5|$|The Hampshire Review {{newspaper}} {{occupied the}} building's second floor with its offices and printing plant from 1884 to 1895. John J. Cornwell, {{who later became}} West Virginia's governor, and his brother William B. Cornwell purchased the newspaper in 1890. The newspaper continued to operate from {{the second floor of}} the Wirgman Building until 1895, when the Cornwell brothers relocated the Hampshire Review office and printing plant to the first floor of their new brick building on West Main Street. In the newspaper's printing <b>plant</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> second floor of the Wirgman Building, the Hampshire Review was printed by a hand-operated Benjamin Franklin printing press.|$|E
5|$|Fishermen of the Canary Islands had {{to return}} to and remain in port for several days while {{weathering}} the storm, and this disruption was blamed for a 10–15% reduction of the islands' tuna catch. Tropical Storm Delta also had some further-reaching effects. The political opposition Popular Party challenged that the impact of Tropical Storm Delta proved the need for the island to prepare an emergency plan to deal with natural and man-made disasters. Only five of the island's many municipalities had an emergency plan, and there was no coordination across the entire island chain. Delta also served to highlight the islands' aging power grid, prompting the regional director general of industry and energy to consider building another power <b>plant</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> archipelago. The storm sparked a vigorous debate on the island about the effects of global climate change, how they will affect the islands, and how these effects can be avoided.|$|E

5|$|In 1995, Dammasch State Hospital {{was closed}} {{by the state}} of Oregon, and the site was then {{proposed}} as a location for what became the Coffee Creek Correctional Facility, which opened in 2001 at a different site {{to the north of the}} old hospital grounds. In protest of the construction of the prison, specifically the effect on property values, Larry Eaton began erecting school buses on his property. The former grounds of the state hospital are, as of 2009, under development as Villebois, a primarily residential complex. Also in 1995, Wilsonville High School opened as part of the West Linn-Wilsonville School District, the first high school in the city's history. In 1998, lack of an adequate long-term water supply forced the city to suspend adding any new developments to the city. A new water treatment <b>plant</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Willamette River opened in 2002 to address this need.|$|E
5|$|Solar {{evaporation}} ponds at {{the edges}} of the lake produce salts and brine (water with high salt quantity). Minerals extracted from the lake include: sodium chloride (common salt), used in water softeners, salt lick blocks for livestock, and to melt ice on local roadways (food-grade salt is not produced from the lake, as it would require further costly processing to ensure its purity); potassium sulfate, used as a commercial fertilizer; and magnesium-chloride brine, used in the production of magnesium metal, chlorine gas, and as a dust suppressant. US Magnesium operates a <b>plant</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> southwest shore of the lake, which produces 14 percent of the worldwide supply of magnesium, more than any other North American magnesium operation. Mineral-extraction companies operating on the lake pay royalties on their products to the State of Utah, which owns the lake.|$|E
5|$|Some doubt {{exists as}} to whether the current {{classification}} accurately represents relationships within the Banksia spinulosa complex. B.spinulosa var.collina is a form of inland gorges and tablelands in central Queensland, but is a coastal <b>plant</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> New South Wales central and north coast. B.spinulosa var.spinulosa, on the other hand, is coastal in central Queensland and in New South Wales south of Sydney. Similarly, B.spinulosa var.cunninghamii is widely separated between New South Wales and Victorian forms (where the longer leaved form was originally called B.prionophylla by Meissner). Notably both B.spinulosa var.spinulosa and B.spinulosa var.collina in northern Queensland have old spikes bare as opposed to them having persistent old flower parts in New South Wales and Victoria. Mast listed B.spinulosa var.collina and B.spinulosa var.neoanglica as sister clades in 1998, with B.spinulosa var.spinulosa and B.spinulosa var.cunninghamii flanking these. Alex George also reports that the taxon should be reviewed. A molecular study with specimens of each subspecies from the three mainland eastern states they occur would shed light on this matter.|$|E

5|$|The Environment Agency is {{responsible}} for monitoring water quality on the river and its tributaries, which have been divided into seventeen separate water bodies. In 2013, seven water bodies were assessed as having good quality and ten as being moderate. The reasons for not achieving good status included pollution from waste water, pollution from agriculture and physical modifications. The physical modifications include dredging work on the lower reaches, near the junction with the Parrett to increase the channel flow to reduce flooding. The use and storage of the dredged material in bank restoration may also have an impact. In 1998 improvements were sought to treatment works and surface water outfalls to improve water quality. A vegetable washing <b>plant</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Chelston stream at Wellington was also identified {{as a source of}} pollution. The waters of the Upper Tone have been classified as having good ecological status, whereas the section from Wellington to Taunton and downstrean of Taunton are rated as moderate.|$|E
5|$|The Shinano River {{system has}} a long history of {{hydroelectric}} power generation, with the first hydroelectric power plant in Japan being located in the system. During the construction of a <b>plant</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Shinano River in the Niigata Prefecture in July 1922, it was reported at the time that Korean workers were being mistreated and murdered. The Shinano River incident involved 1,200 workers, approximately 600 of whom were Korean, who were subjected to regular mistreatment by their Japanese foremen. The mistreatment included malnutrition, forced labour up to sixteen hours a day and severe beatings for those who tried to escape. News articles at the time alleged that up to 100 Koreans were killed during construction and that local farmers had reported seeing bodies floating down river. This incident occurred following the annexation of Korea by Japan and was partially responsible for the development of trade unions for Korean workers in Japan.|$|E
5|$|The city's {{industrial}} base {{continued to grow}} in the post-war era partly assisted by the area's first agency entirely devoted to industrial development, the RIDC. Jones and Laughlin Steel Company expanded its <b>plant</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Southside. H.J. Heinz, Pittsburgh Plate Glass, Alcoa, Westinghouse, U.S. Steel and its new division, the Pittsburgh Chemical Company and many other companies also continued robust operations through the 1960s. 1970 marked the completion of the final building projects of Renaissance I: the U.S. Steel Tower and Three Rivers Stadium. In 1974, with the addition of the fountain {{at the tip of the}} Golden Triangle, Point State Park was completed. Although air quality was dramatically improved, and Pittsburgh's manufacturing base seemed solid, questions abound about the negative effects Urban Renewal continues to have on the social fabric of Pittsburgh. Pittsburgh, however, was about to undergo one of its most dramatic transformations.|$|E

5|$|The first {{hydropower}} plant {{was built in}} 1904 by a local entrepreneur. It was located {{in a small town}} outside of Reykjavík and produced 9 kW of power. The first municipal hydroelectric plant was built in 1921, and it could produce 1 MW of power. This plant single-handedly quadrupled the amount of electricity in the country. The 1950s marked the next evolution in hydroelectric plants. Two plants were built on the Sog River, one in 1953 which produced 31 MW, and the other in 1959 which produced 26.4 MW. These two plants were the first built for industrial purposes and they were co-owned by the Icelandic government. This process continued in 1965 when the national power company, Landsvirkjun, was founded. It was owned by both the Icelandic government and the municipality of Reykjavík. In 1969, they built a 210 MW <b>plant</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Þjórsá River that would supply the southeastern area of Iceland with electricity and run an aluminum smelting plant that could produce 33,000tons of aluminum a year.|$|E
