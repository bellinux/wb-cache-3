5|$|For Carlotta Grisi's {{performances}} as Giselle {{with the}} Imperial Ballet in St. Petersburg, Perrot commissioned the composer Cesare Pugni {{to score a}} new <b>pas</b> de cinq for the ballerina that {{was added to the}} first tableau. This <b>pas</b> was only retained for Grisi's performances and never performed again after her departure from St. Petersburg. Marius Petipa would also commission an additional piece for the first tableau of the ballet. This was a <b>pas</b> de deux from the composer Ludwig Minkus that was added to the choreographer's 1884 revival for the ballerina Maria Gorshenkova. As with Pugni's 1850 <b>pas</b> de cinq for Grisi, Gorshenkova's 1884 <b>pas</b> de deux by Minkus never became part of the performance tradition of Giselle.|$|E
5|$|Immediately {{following}} the first répétition générale of Giselle {{on the stage}} of the Paris Opéra, the danseuse Nathalie Fitz-James used her influence as the mistress of an influential patron of the theatre to have a <b>pas</b> inserted for herself into the ballet. Jean Coralli was required to quickly arrange a number for Fitz-James, which was arranged by Coralli as a <b>pas</b> de deux with the danseur Auguste Mabille serving as Fitz-James's partner. Coralli's original intentions were to have the ballet's composer Adolphe Adam supply the music for Fitz-James's <b>pas,</b> but by this time Adam was unavailable. In light of this, Coralli chose a suite by the composer Friedrich Burgmüller's titled Souvenirs de Ratisbonne to fashion music for Fitz-James's required <b>pas.</b> This <b>pas</b> de deux, which was dubbed the <b>Pas</b> des paysans (or Peasant <b>pas</b> de deux), became part of the ballet's performance tradition.|$|E

5|$|Alarmed by {{the raids}} on St Nazaire and Dieppe in 1942, Hitler ordered the {{construction}} of fortifications all along the Atlantic coast, from Spain to Norway, to protect against an expected Allied invasion. He envisioned 15,000 emplacements manned by 300,000 troops, but due to shortages, particularly of concrete and manpower, most of the strongpoints were never built. As the expected site of an Allied invasion, <b>Pas</b> de Calais was heavily defended. In the Normandy area the best fortifications were concentrated at the port facilities at Cherbourg and Saint-Malo.|$|E

5|$|Four {{sites were}} {{considered}} for the landings: Brittany, the Cotentin Peninsula, Normandy, and the <b>Pas</b> de Calais. As Brittany and Cotentin are peninsulas, {{it would have been}} possible for the Germans to cut off the Allied advance at a relatively narrow isthmus, so these sites were rejected. With the <b>Pas</b> de Calais being the closest point in continental Europe to Britain, the Germans considered it to be the most likely initial landing zone, so it was the most heavily fortified region. But it offered few opportunities for expansion, as the area is bounded by numerous rivers and canals, whereas landings on a broad front in Normandy would permit simultaneous threats against the port of Cherbourg, coastal ports further west in Brittany, and an overland attack towards Paris and eventually into Germany. Normandy was hence chosen as the landing site. The most serious drawback of the Normandy coast—the lack of port facilities—would be overcome through the development of artificial Mulberry harbours. A series of specialised tanks, nicknamed Hobart's Funnies, were created to deal with conditions expected during the Normandy Campaign, such as scaling sea walls and providing close support on the beach.|$|E

The northern terminus of <b>PA</b> 339 was cut back to <b>PA</b> 115 (now <b>PA</b> 254) south of Benton in the 1930s, with <b>PA</b> 115 replacing the route north of there. <b>PA</b> 342 was extended southeast to <b>PA</b> 45 (now <b>PA</b> 54) in Mahanoy City in the 1930s. In the 1940s, a southern extension of <b>PA</b> 44 replaced <b>PA</b> 342. In the 1960s, <b>PA</b> 339 was shifted to its current alignment. <b>PA</b> 339 replaced the section of <b>PA</b> 44 between Mahanoy City and Mainville while a southern extension of <b>PA</b> 487 replaced the former <b>PA</b> 339 between Bloomsburg and Benton.|$|R
50|$|The proofs are elementary. Recall that <b>P(A</b> ∨ B) = <b>P(A)</b> + P(B) &minus; <b>P(A</b> & B), {{which implies}} <b>P(A)</b> + P(B) &minus; <b>P(A</b> ∨ B) = <b>P(A</b> & B). Because all probabilities are {{no bigger than}} 1, we know <b>P(A</b> ∨ B) ≤ 1, which implies that <b>P(A)</b> + P(B) &minus; 1 ≤ <b>P(A</b> & B). Because all probabilities are also {{positive}} we can similarly say 0 ≤ <b>P(A</b> & B), so max(0, <b>P(A)</b> + P(B) &minus; 1) ≤ <b>P(A</b> & B). This gives the lower bound on the conjunction.|$|R
5|$|From {{the early}} 1830s {{until the late}} 1840s Her Majesty's Theatre played host to {{the heyday of the}} era of the romantic ballet, and the theatre's {{resident}} ballet company was considered the most renowned in Europe, aside from the Ballet du Théâtre de l'Académie Royale de Musique in Paris. The celebrated ballet master Jules Perrot began staging ballet at Her Majesty's in 1830. Lumley appointed him Premier Maître de Ballet (chief choreographer) to the theatre in 1842. Among the works of ballet that he staged were Ondine, ou La Naïade (1843), La Esmeralda (1844), and Catarina, ou La Fille du Bandit (1846), as well as the celebrated divertissement <b>Pas</b> de Quatre (1845). Other ballet masters created works for the ballet of Her Majesty's Theatre throughout the period of the romantic ballet, most notably Paul Taglioni (son of Filippo Taglioni), who staged ballets including Coralia, ou Le Chevalier inconstant (1847) and Electra (1849, the first production of a ballet to make use of electric lighting). Arthur Saint-Léon staged such works as La Vivandière (1844), Le Violin du Diable (1849), and Le Jugement de Pâris (1850), which was considered a sequel of sorts to <b>Pas</b> de Quatre.|$|E
