5000|$|Arroyo Burro has a {{reputation}} as a [...] "dog beach", and is a popular location for dog owners to walk their <b>pets</b> off <b>leash,</b> though Arroyo Burro itself is actually on-leash (the off-leash area is just east below the Wilcox Property Douglas Family Preserve). Surfers also frequent the beach's waters, and outdoor showers facilitate the sport. The beach's other recreational features include a grassy area with picnic tables and barbecue grills, the Arroyo Burro County Park building which houses a restaurant and snack bar with outdoor and indoor seating, and a building constructed out of recycled and reclaimed materials that houses an ecological education center known as the [...] "Watershed Resource Center". The park officially opens at 8:00 am and closes at sunset, at which time entrance to the (free) parking lot is prohibited. However, vehicles parked before sunset can remain into the evening hours.|$|R
50|$|The 71 mi {{of trails}} offer the full {{spectrum}} of landscapes from the Douglas-fir forests on the Inverness Ridge to the sandy beaches, rocky headlands and salt marshes near the ocean and estuaries. Cross-country travel is allowed but caution is advised as there is poison oak, stinging nettles, unstable cliffs and fragile meadows. Several miles of trail are open to bicycles and horseback riders and at least one trail allows <b>leashed</b> <b>pets.</b> The legislation that created the wilderness contains special provisions, one of which allows mechanized vehicles on four trails or closed roads within the wilderness boundaries.|$|R
50|$|Skidaway Island State Park is a {{state park}} near Savannah, Georgia. The park borders Skidaway narrows, a part of Georgia’s intracoastal waterway. Trails wind through {{maritime}} forest and past salt marsh, leading to a boardwalk and observation tower. Visitors can watch for deer, fiddler crabs, raccoon, egrets and other wildlife. Inside the park’s interpretive center, birders will find binoculars, reference books and a window where they can look for migrating species such as Painted Buntings. A scenic campground is nestled under live oaks and Spanish moss, and some RV sites have sewer hookups. <b>Leashed</b> <b>pets</b> are allowed. Groups can enjoy privacy in their own pioneer campgrounds. Open-air picnic shelters and an enclosed group shelter are popular spots for parties, reunions and other celebrations.|$|R

5000|$|... • After the disaster, <b>leash</b> <b>pets</b> when going outside. Maintain close contact, as pets may be {{confused}} due to changes on {{what used to}} be familiar landmarks and scents. • Keep an eye out for snakes or other animals that might have been brought into the area by flood waters. Be aware that wildlife has likely been affected and displaced - Raccoons, gophers, deer and other wild animals might confront pets. • Monitor pet behavior. Normally quiet and friendly pets may become aggressive or defensive after an emergency situation. Remember that emergency services might have been interrupted - Be aware that in case of injury it may take days for services to be fully restored and available• If pets cannot be found after a disaster, contact the local animal control office to find out where lost animals can be recovered. Bring along a picture for identification purposes, if available.|$|R
5000|$|The {{concept for}} the 100 cm x 170 cm size {{painting}} was based by Luna on ancient Roman history. It depicted a domestic scene in ancient Roman life, portraying two women {{lying on the}} steps of a house. The hand of one woman was holding the reins of two pet dogs or hunting dogs, in order to prevent them from scaring away some doves. [...] The doves symbolized divinity [...] The background of the painting presented a shelf of artifacts. To the left of the shelf was a shrine with a pediment shaped like a triangle. In front of the pediment was a burner with a smoking incense. There are three major elements of Las Damas Romanas, namely the women, the dogs, and the doves. Roman life involved having dogs because they were employed by the ancient Romans for hunting activities, guardians of the home and their property, and as pets. In Luna's painting, the <b>leashed</b> <b>pet</b> dogs were acting as companions of women. Doves, on the other hand, were animals that connote eroticism. [...] In relation to one of the women, there was a suggestion that the woman on the right with dark hair could be Maria de la Paz Pardo de Tavera. The notion was discarded because Luna was unmarried when he painted Las Damas Romanas.|$|R
40|$|Coyote {{attacks on}} humans and pets have {{increased}} {{within the past}} 5 years in California. We discuss documented occurrences of coyote aggression and attacks on people, using data from USDA Wildlife Services, the California Department of Fish & Game, and other sources. Forty-eight such attacks on children and adults were verified from 1998 through 2003, compared to 41 attacks during the period 1988 through 1997; most incidents occurred in Southern California near the suburban-wildland interface. Attack incidents are typically preceded by a sequence of increasingly bold coyote behaviors, including: nighttime coyote attacks on pets; sightings of coyotes in neighborhoods at night; sightings of coyotes in morning and evening; attacks on pets during daylight hours; attacks on <b>pets</b> on <b>leashes</b> and chasing of joggers and bicyclists; and finally, mid-day sightings of coyotes in and around children’s play areas. In suburban areas, coyotes can lose their fear of humans {{as a result of}} coming to rely on ample food resources including increased numbers of rabbits and rodents, household refuse, pet food, available water from ponds and landscape irrigation run-off, and even intentional feeding of coyotes by residents. The safe environment provided by a wildlife-loving general public, who rarely display aggression toward coyotes, is also thought to be a major contributing factor. The termination or reduction of predator management programs adjacent to some urban areas has also served to contribute to coyotes’ loss of fear of humans and to a dependency on resources in the suburban environment. Corrective action can be effective if implemented before coyote attacks on pets become common. However, if environmental modification and changes in human behavior toward coyotes are delayed, then removal of offending predators by traps or shooting is required in order to resolve the threat to human safety. We note the failure of various non-lethal harassment techniques to correct the problem in situations where coyotes have become habituated to human-provided food resources. Coyote attacks on humans in suburbia are preventable, but the long-term solution of this conflict requires public education, changes in residents’ behavior, and in some situations, the means to effectively remove individual offending animals...|$|R
30|$|Although we did {{not measure}} human {{disturbance}} directly, other {{studies have found that}} birds are disturbed several times per hour on recreational beaches in southern California (Lafferty 2001). Studies that have failed to find real-time negative associations between birds and human activity on beaches have assumed that disturbances are too random in time and space for birds to adjust to (McCrary and Pierson 2000; Lafferty 2001; Yasue 2006; Neuman et al. 2008). Our data are consistent with McCrary and Pierson’s (2000) interpretation that long-term average human use leads to broad-scale, but difficult to detect, changes in average bird distributions among beaches, so that sites with many humans have low richness and abundance of shorebirds. Similarly, Lafferty et al. (2006) found that birds moved into a small area where human disturbance was excluded. We did not separate effects of dogs and humans, but birds are known to respond to dogs at greater distances than humans, perhaps because birds instinctively view dogs as predators (Lafferty 2001). Most of the beaches in our study receive substantial human use and this will only increase with time due to continued growth of coastal populations in southern California (population along the Pacific Coast has increased from 47 million in 1960 to 87 million in 2008). Some management actions might reduce disturbance to birds on beaches. One of the most obvious options is to <b>leash</b> <b>pets</b> on beaches as some dogs will actively chase birds (Lafferty 2001). California law specifically prohibits off-leash pets on beaches, but these laws are not commonly posted or enforced. Even when posted, dog owners often ignore the laws because local law enforcement agencies consider leashing a low priority. Another management action that can reduce disturbance to birds on beaches is to rope off areas where birds concentrate, such as near the mouths of estuaries (Ikuta and Blumstein 2003; Lafferty et al. 2006). Surveys of beach users in Australia indicate that most beach users support protecting birds on beaches so long as walking is not prohibited along the wet sand (Glover et al. 2011).|$|R
