5|$|In the maximal clique listing problem, {{the input}} is an undirected graph, and the output {{is a list}} of all its maximal cliques. The maximum clique <b>problem</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> solved using as a {{subroutine}} an algorithm for the maximal clique listing problem, because the maximum clique must be included among all the maximal cliques.|$|E
5|$|The closure problem {{takes as}} input a {{directed}} acyclic graph with weights on its vertices and seeks the minimum (or maximum) weight of a closure, a set of vertices with no outgoing edges. (The <b>problem</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> formulated for directed graphs without the assumption of acyclicity, but with no greater generality, because {{in this case it}} is equivalent to the same problem on the condensation of the graph.) It may be solved in polynomial time using a reduction to the maximum flow problem.|$|E

25|$|The rise in infestations {{has been}} hard to track because bed bugs are not an easily {{identifiable}} problem. Most of the reports are collected from pest-control companies, local authorities, and hotel chains. Therefore, the <b>problem</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> more severe than is currently believed.|$|E
25|$|Computational {{complexity}} theory is {{a branch of}} the theory of computation that focuses on classifying computational problems according to their inherent difficulty, and relating those classes to each other. A computational problem is understood to be a task that is in principle amenable to being solved by a computer, which is equivalent to stating that the <b>problem</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> solved by mechanical application of mathematical steps, such as an algorithm.|$|E
25|$|High {{emissions}}. As {{unburnt fuel}} {{is in the}} exhaust stream, emissions requirements are difficult to meet. This <b>problem</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> overcome by implementing direct fuel injection into the combustion chamber. The Freedom Motors Rotapower Wankel engine, which is not yet in production, met the ultra low California emissions standards. The Mazda Renesis engine, with both intake and exhaust side ports, suppressed the loss of unburned mix to exhaust formerly induced by port overlap.|$|E

25|$|Economic {{security}} – Economic security {{requires an}} assured basic income for individuals, usually from productive and remunerative work or, {{as a last}} resort, from a publicly financed safety net. In this sense, only {{about a quarter of}} the world’s people are presently economically secure. While the economic security <b>problem</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> more serious in developing countries, concern also arises in developed countries as well. Unemployment problems constitute an important factor underlying political tensions and ethnic violence.|$|E
25|$|In Newtonian mechanics, two {{extreme cases}} of this <b>problem</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> {{distinguished}} yielding mathematics of minimum complexity: (1) The two bodies rebound {{from each other}} in a completely elastic collision. (2) The two bodies stick together and continue moving as a single particle. This second case is the case of completely inelastic collision. For both cases (1) and (2), momentum, mass, and total energy are conserved. However, kinetic energy is not conserved in cases of inelastic collision. A certain fraction of the initial kinetic energy is converted to heat.|$|E
25|$|In part this {{is because}} the {{underlying}} hip <b>problem</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> mild or severe, may be worsening or stable, and the body may be more or less able to keep the joint in repair well enough to cope. Also, different animals have different pain tolerances and different weights, and use their bodies differently, so a light dog who only walks, will have a different joint use than a more heavy or very active dog. Some dogs will have a problem early on, others may never have a real problem at all.|$|E

50|$|Some <b>problems</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> {{treated as}} {{belonging}} to either of the categories, depending on the context. For example, consider the following problem.|$|R
25|$|At each node or edge, {{there are}} at most 2k sets S for which we need to {{calculate}} these values, so if k is a constant then the whole calculation takes constant time per edge or node. The size of the maximum independent set is the largest value stored at the root node, and the maximum independent set itself can be found (as is standard in dynamic programming algorithms) by backtracking through these stored values starting from this largest value. Thus, in graphs of bounded treewidth, the maximum independent set <b>problem</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> solved in linear time. Similar algorithms apply to many other graph problems.|$|E
25|$|Studies {{have sought}} additional, visible and easily definable {{indicators}} {{of pain and}} in particular the high level of pain detected in babies when hungry, compared to pain levels in further developed children. Combinations of crying with facial expressions, posture and movements, aided by physiological measurements, have been tested and found to be reliable indicators. A number of such observational scales have been published and verified Even with noticeable responses from an infant, the underlying <b>problem</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> hidden. Due to the inability to speak or the side effects of the illness, {{it may be difficult to}} receive a proper diagnosis, causing infant diagnosis to be one of the hardest to do in the medical field.|$|E
25|$|Shift {{workers who}} work {{throughout}} the night {{have been known to}} have far more accidents as opposed to daytime workers. This can be attributed to several factors, including fewer staff and fatigue; however, part of the <b>problem</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> the workers poor working memory and poor performance skills due to poor memory consolidation. Both implicitly learned tasks and explicitly learned tasks improve by roughly 20% after a full nights sleep. Without an adequate nights sleep between learning a new task and performance of that task, performance fails to improve. Shift workers who are not given an adequate amount of sleep, particularly in the NREM stage, between learning and performance of a task will not perform as well as workers who maintain a standard sleep routine.|$|E

25|$|While {{concrete}} {{figures are}} difficult to determine, the International Labour Organization (ILO) recently reported that {{there are at least}} 600,000 children involved in forced begging. The <b>problem</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> much more extensive, however, with China's Ministry of Civil Affairs reporting that as many as 1.5 million children are forced into begging. Additionally, a recent study done in Senegal by Human Rights Watch projected that a minimum of 50,000 children within the country and neighboring nations have been trafficked for the purposes of begging. Begging is often the primary source of income for street children in a number of countries, with a current study conducted by UNICEF finding that 45.7% of children who work on the streets of Zimbabwe engaged in begging, though {{there is no way of}} knowing whether it was through forced means.|$|E
25|$|Open shop {{scheduling}} is {{a problem}} of scheduling production processes, in which there are a set of objects to be manufactured, each object has a set of tasks to be performed on it (in any order), and each task must be performed on a specific machine, preventing any other task that requires the same machine from being performed at the same time. If all tasks have the same length, then this <b>problem</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> formalized as one of edge coloring a bipartite multigraph, in which the vertices {{on one side of the}} bipartition represent the objects to be manufactured, the vertices on the other side of the bipartition represent the manufacturing machines, the edges represent tasks that must be performed, and the colors represent time steps in which each task may be performed. Since bipartite edge coloring may be performed in polynomial time, the same is true for this restricted case of open shop scheduling.|$|E
25|$|However, in planar graphs, the Maximum-Cut Problem is dual to {{the route}} {{inspection}} problem (the problem {{of finding a}} shortest tour that visits each edge of a graph at least once), {{in the sense that}} the edges that do not belong to a maximum cut-set of a graph G are the duals of the edges that are doubled in an optimal inspection tour of the dual graph of G. The optimal inspection tour forms a self-intersecting curve that separates the plane into two subsets, the subset of points for which the winding number of the curve is even and the subset for which the winding number is odd; these two subsets form a cut that includes all of the edges whose duals appear an odd number of times in the tour. The route inspection <b>problem</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> solved in polynomial time, and this duality allows the maximum cut problem to also be solved in polynomial time for planar graphs. The Maximum-Bisection problem is known however to be NP-hard.|$|E

50|$|Although {{formally}} equivalent, different <b>problems</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> solved {{more easily}} in the Fokker-Planck equation or the path integral formulation. The equilibrium distribution for instance <b>may</b> <b>be</b> obtained more directly from the Fokker-Planck equation.|$|R
25|$|In fiber-optic communication, {{the path}} {{coloring}} {{problem is the}} problem of assigning colors (frequencies of light) to pairs of nodes that wish to communicate with each other, and paths through a fiber-optic communications network for each pair, subject to the restriction that no two paths that share a segment of fiber use the same frequency as each other. Paths that pass through the same communication switch but not through any segment of fiber are allowed to use the same frequency. When the communications network is arranged as a star network, with a single central switch connected by separate fibers to each of the nodes, the path coloring <b>problem</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> modeled exactly as a problem of edge coloring a graph or multigraph, in which the communicating nodes form the graph vertices, pairs of nodes that wish to communicate form the graph edges, and the frequencies that may be used for each pair form the colors of the edge coloring problem. For communications networks with a more general tree topology, local path coloring solutions for the star networks defined by each switch in the network may be patched together to form a single global solution.|$|E
25|$|These {{barriers}} {{have also}} led some computer scientists {{to suggest that}} the P versus NP <b>problem</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> independent of standard axiom systems like ZFC (cannot be proved or disproved within them). The interpretation of an independence result could be that either no polynomial-time algorithm exists for any NP-complete problem, and such a proof cannot be constructed in (e.g.) ZFC, or that polynomial-time algorithms for NP-complete problems may exist, but it is impossible to prove in ZFC that such algorithms are correct. However, if it can be shown, using techniques of the sort that are currently known to be applicable, that the problem cannot be decided even with much weaker assumptions extending the Peano axioms (PA) for integer arithmetic, then there would necessarily exist nearly-polynomial-time algorithms for every problem in NP. Therefore, if one believes (as most complexity theorists do) that not all problems in NP have efficient algorithms, it would follow that proofs of independence using those techniques cannot be possible. Additionally, this result implies that proving independence from PA or ZFC using currently known techniques is no easier than proving the existence of efficient algorithms for all problems in NP.|$|E
