50|$|An {{entry-level}} model, the plastic-bodied 2xi {{features a}} program mode (P-mode), Shutter <b>priority</b> <b>mode</b> (S-mode), aperture <b>priority</b> <b>mode</b> (A-mode), and fully manual mode (M-mode). There {{is also a}} self-timer feature, a manual / auto focus switch for use with the series of auto focus lenses, hot shoe mount compatible with i and xi flashes, and a tripod mount.|$|E
50|$|Edge {{and level}} {{interrupt}} trigger modes {{are supported by}} the 8259A. Fixed priority and rotating <b>priority</b> <b>modes</b> are supported.|$|R
50|$|The F10's sibling, the FinePix F11, {{which was}} not {{released}} in the United States except {{in the state of}} Hawaii, added aperture and shutter <b>priority</b> <b>modes</b> but still did not provide full manual control. It also had a slightly improved LCD screen and a few other minor improvements to the F10.|$|R
50|$|Like {{aperture}} <b>priority,</b> this <b>mode</b> {{allows for}} partial automation thus decreasing {{the need for}} total concentration.|$|R

50|$|Aperture <b>priority</b> <b>mode</b> (commonly {{abbreviated}} to Av) gives the photographer manual {{control of the}} aperture, whilst the camera automatically adjusts the shutter speed to achieve the exposure specified by the TTL meter. Shutter <b>priority</b> <b>mode</b> (commonly {{abbreviated to}} TV) gives manual shutter control, with automatic aperture compensation. In each case, the actual exposure level is still determined by the camera's exposure meter.|$|E
50|$|Cameras {{can perform}} autobracketing by {{adjusting}} either the shutter speed (typically in aperture <b>priority</b> <b>mode,</b> sometimes also in manual or program mode) or the aperture setting (typically in shutter <b>priority</b> <b>mode).</b> In programmed exposure mode, many cameras will alter both parameters {{at the same}} time. Some cameras allow to swap the parameter used for shifting in manual mode. Digital cameras may also alter the ISO setting if auto-ISO is enabled.|$|E
5000|$|Fujifilm {{introduced}} a full line of twenty X-Fujinon lenses {{in this new}} mount (as well as some Fujinar lenses, not described here) :The [...] "no-DM" [...] lens cannot be used for program and shutter <b>priority</b> exposure <b>modes</b> of AX-3, AX5 SLR aperture <b>priority</b> and manual <b>mode</b> will work.|$|R
50|$|In {{addition}} to its ISO capability, the F10's success was also fueled by its excellent battery life, speedy shooting, and overall picture quality. One of the camera's weaknesses, however, was manual shooting. Lacking aperture and shutter speed <b>priority</b> <b>modes,</b> the F10 was mostly a point and shoot camera. Other criticisms included the proprietary dongle needed to make any connections to the camera and a relatively high level of purple fringing.|$|R

5000|$|On some modern cameras, bulb is a mode {{available}} {{as an option}} on the LCD menu only, if possible at all. On others, including many Digital SLR cameras, bulb is typically available from the manual exposure mode and - rarely - also from shutter <b>priority</b> <b>mode.</b>|$|E
50|$|Other {{advanced}} {{features of}} the 950 included shutter and aperture <b>priority</b> <b>modes</b> {{and the ability to}} custom-preset white balance. The 950 included a flash-sync socket for use with various Nikon external flash units (no shoe-mount was provided, however). As with all 9xx series, the lens movement during focusing and zooming was all internal, resulting in superior weather and dust resistance. The 950 shared with other 9xx series cameras the 28 mm filter threads and shared numerous Nikon and 3rd-party filters and diopter filters.|$|R

With the {{development}} of society and economy of China, levels in urbanization and motorization levels are in a rapid growth, triggering a series of problems in socio-economic efficiency {{and the quality of}} residents, resulting in the relative lack of supply capacity. From this point, a analytic hierarchy process based on the acquisition of the economic attributes in the whole city's main transport was used to clarify the structure of urban traffic optimization goals ordered by <b>priority</b> <b>modes</b> of transportation in the evaluation system...|$|R

50|$|As an image's {{depth of}} field is {{inversely}} proportional {{to the size of}} the lens's aperture, aperture <b>priority</b> <b>mode</b> is often used to allow the photographer to control the focus of objects in the frame. Aperture priority is therefore useful in landscape photography, for example, where it may be desired that objects in foreground, middle distance, and background all be rendered crisply, while shutter speed is immaterial. To obtain this large {{depth of field}}, a narrow aperture (identified by a high f-number, e.g. f/16 or f/22) is necessary. Aperture <b>priority</b> <b>mode</b> also finds use in portrait photography, where a wide aperture (identified by a low number, e.g. f/1.4 or f/2.8) and therefore smaller depth of field may be desired to throw the background out of focus and make it less distracting.|$|E
50|$|The MZ-30/ZX-30, MZ-50/ZX-50, MZ-60/ZX-60, the *ist {{series and}} the K100D/K110D lack the {{mechanical}} stop-down coupler/indicator. In these cameras - in aperture <b>priority</b> <b>mode</b> - the aperture is set by a dial {{on the camera}} body, and {{no longer on the}} lens. Pre-A lenses can only be used in manual stop down metering mode and manual flash mode.|$|E
50|$|The camera {{offers a}} fully {{automatic}} mode, several scene modes, and a manual mode {{which is more}} of an aperture <b>priority</b> <b>mode.</b> This gives the user control over the sharpness, flash strength, white balance, and exposure compensation. The shutter speed ranges from 1/1500 to 2 seconds. It can make videos in 320×240 or 640×480 sizes. Sound cannot be recorded in video mode.|$|E

50|$|The EOS-1Ds Mark III {{features}} a 21-megapixel sensor. It {{has a higher}} pixel count than the 16.7 megapixel sensor seen in the Canon EOS-1Ds Mark II. The CMOS sensor incorporates a new pixel design with on-chip noise reduction circuitry. It can shoot in 3200 ISO when necessary. The 1Ds Mark III also features Highlight Tone <b>Priority</b> <b>mode,</b> which boosts the dynamic range for highlights.|$|E
5000|$|The camera had two modes: {{aperture}}-priority {{and full}} manual. The shutter speeds ranged from 4 to 1/2000 seconds (steplessly) in aperture <b>priority</b> <b>mode</b> and 2 to 1/2000 seconds in manual mode, {{in addition to}} a [...] "bulb" [...] mode. The shutter was controlled electronically in both modes; and was a Seiko electromagnetic metal focal plane shutter. A multiple exposure switch was also incorporated into the camera, alongside a 5 or 10 second self-timer.|$|E
50|$|Shutter {{speed is}} {{critical}} to catching motion, thus sports photography is often done in shutter <b>priority</b> <b>mode</b> or manual. A frequent goal is to capture an instant with minimal blur, in which case a minimal shutter speed is desired, but in other cases a slower shutter speed is used so that blur shows to capture the motion, not simply the instant. A particular technique is panning, where the camera uses an intermediate shutter speed and pans with the subject, yielding a relatively sharp subject and a background blurred {{in the direction of}} motion, yielding a sense of speed - compare speed lines.|$|E
50|$|The K10D {{featured}} a pentaprism viewfinder (instead of the slightly dimmer pentamirror on some previous models), full programmed, aperture and shutter <b>priority</b> <b>modes,</b> {{and a new}} Sensitivity-priority mode where the rear dial adjusts light sensitivity and the camera adjusts shutter speed and aperture to maintain correct exposure. Power contacts on the lens mount were introduced to enable Pentax's SDM (Supersonic Drive Motor) for silent focusing. The power contacts also provide the power zoom function in some FA lens that Pentax introduced in the 1990s. In addition, the K10D could write JPEGs and two versions of RAW files (PEF, and the Adobe specification DNG).|$|R

50|$|Another {{common use}} of {{aperture}} <b>priority</b> <b>mode</b> is to indirectly affect shutter speed for a desired effect. In landscape photography, a user might select a small aperture when photographing a waterfall, {{so that the}} camera will select a slow shutter speed (to allow a sufficient amount of light to reach the film or sensor for proper exposure), thereby causing the water to blur through the frame. When shooting a portrait in dim lighting, the photographer might choose to open the lens to its maximum aperture in hopes of getting enough light for a good exposure while maintaining the shortest possible shutter speed to reduce blur.|$|E
50|$|In 1977, Minolta {{introduced}} the XD-11, the first multimode 35 mm compact SLR to include both aperture and shutter priority {{in a single}} body. It {{was also the first}} camera to employ a computerised chip, which in shutter <b>priority</b> <b>mode</b> overrode the chosen speed if necessary to give a correct exposure, thus offering the first-ever 'programmed mode'. The XD-11 is {{considered by many to be}} the best manual-focus 35 mm SLR Minolta ever produced, and the last serious attempt by Minolta to enter the professional and semiprofessional 35 mm SLR market until the Maxxum 9 in 1998. Elements of the XD-11 design (called the XD-7 in Europe) were utilized by Leitz for the Leica R4 camera.|$|E
50|$|In manual mode, {{the camera}} is {{completely}} mechanical in operation, and only requires batteries for the light metering information system. In aperture <b>priority</b> <b>mode,</b> the batteries continued to power the meter, but are also utilized for shutter timing and the exposure control electronics. The FM3A's metering information system consisted of a match-needle system using two needles pointing along a vertical shutter speed scale {{on the left side}} of the viewfinder to indicate the readings of the built-in 60/40% centerweighted silicon photodiode light meter versus the actual camera settings. This system can be traced back to the Nikkormat EL (Nikomat EL in Japan) of 1972. The viewfinder also has Nikon's fully interchangeable bright focus screen with various options for focus.|$|E
