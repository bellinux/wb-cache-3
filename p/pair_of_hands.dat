25|$|Jadeja was {{a regular}} in the Indian cricket team between 1992 and 2000, playing 15 Test matches and 196 One Day Internationals. He was {{regarded}} as one of the best fielders in the Indian team in his time. One of his most memorable innings was his cameo in the 1996 Cricket World Cup quarter-final In Bengaluru against arch rivals Pakistan when he blasted 45 off 25 balls, including 40 from the final two overs by Waqar Younis. Jadeja, along with Mohammed Azharuddin, holds the record for the highest one day partnership record for the 4th and 5th wicket, set against Zimbabwe and Sri Lanka respectively. Jadeja was also renowned for his remarkable fielding, and was considered one of the safest <b>pair</b> <b>of</b> <b>hands</b> in the Indian team during his tenure.|$|E
25|$|The great England wicket-keeper Godfrey Evans was on {{his fourth}} tour of Australia, having visited before in 1946-47, 1950–51 and 1954-55. He was chosen in part for his batting, having made centuries against the West Indies and India, but his loud and {{enthusiastic}} wicketkeeping was a joy to watch and considered {{by far the best}} in the world. When he returned to England in 1959 he missed three stumpings in fifteen minutes against India and retired from Test cricket as he no longer met his own exacting standards, but his record number of dismissals in Test cricket remained unbeaten for eighteen years. The Marylebone Cricket Club preferred to rotate their reserve wicket-keepers and in 1958-59 it was the turn of the reserve Surrey keeper Roy Swetman. He was by far the shortest man in the team and looked only 17, but was in fact 25. Although a good man behind the stumps and a decent lower order batsman he was not Evans and lost his England place in 1960. In 1956 England had out-fielded and out-caught Australia and they were still a strong fielding team. Colin Cowdrey would be the first slip fielder to take 100 Test catches, Peter May and Tom Graveney were good slips and Ted Dexter an athletic cover. Fred Trueman was a good close field and Tony Lock was considered the greatest backward short leg in the world and one of the safest <b>pair</b> <b>of</b> <b>hands</b> in cricket. Peter Richardson, Willie Watson and Trevor Bailey were good all round fielders, though the latter two were slowing {{down at the end of}} their careers.|$|E

25|$|When Lindsay Hassett {{retired after}} the 1953 Ashes Series his vice-captain Arthur Morris was not {{appointed}} {{to succeed him}} because he was not a state captain. In 1954-55 Australia had not played a Test series since and the selectors were divided as to who should be captain. As with everything else down under cricket was divided between the power centres of Sydney, New South Wales and Melbourne, Victoria. The fast bowling all-rounder Keith Miller was captain of New South Wales and the winner of the 1954-55 Sheffield Shield. He had the obvious advantage of being an automatic selection for the Australian team, and was a charismatic and inspirational leader on the field. Against him was his cavalier approach to the game and that he was little inclined to enforce discipline. His rival was the captain of Victoria, the off-spinner Ian Johnson. Johnson had been little used on the 1948 tour and was left behind in 1953 and was not an automatic selection for the Test team. However, {{he was the son of}} the Test selector William Johnson, had attended the elite Wesley College. Lindsay Hassett and the chairman of selectors Don Bradman favoured Johnson and he was appointed captain by the A.C.B.. Unlike Miller he was seen as a safe <b>pair</b> <b>of</b> <b>hands</b> and he was an astute captain and a fine ambassador for Australian cricket, but not everybody was happy with the choice. Frank Tyson reckoned that his innings victory in the First Test cost Australia the series as it confirmed Johnson in the captaincy, whereas Miller might have won the next three vital Tests. As it was vice-captain Arthur Morris was blamed for the defeat in Sydney and (strangely) Melbourne and the selectors stuck by Johnson. He went on to captain the successful Australian tour of the West Indies in 1954-55, where his diplomacy ensured that he did not suffer the same problems as Len Hutton in 1953-54, and his captaincy was considered to be equal to that of Richie Benaud. He retired after the Australian tour of England, Pakistan and India in 1956, where he again failed to regain the Ashes after being 1-0 up in the series.|$|E
500|$|The church {{used to be}} {{decorated}} with paper garlands. [...] This tradition was noted in the 18th century, when a writer thought that they symbolised the [...] "hymeneal union" [...] (i.e. marriage) of parishioners, because the garlands each had a <b>pair</b> <b>of</b> <b>hands</b> in the centre. In 1833, another writer said that the garlands marked the death of unmarried women, but the tradition was no longer observed.|$|E
500|$|The flukes (lobes of the tail) and {{dorsal fin}} are formed of dense {{connective}} tissue and do not contain bone or muscle. The dorsal fin usually shows phenotypic variations that help discriminate among populations. The animal propels itself by moving the flukes up and down. The pectoral flippers (at {{the sides of the}} body) are for steering; they contain bones homologous to the forelimbs of land mammals. A bottlenose dolphin discovered in Japan has two additional pectoral fins, or [...] "hind legs", at the tail, {{about the size of a}} human's <b>pair</b> <b>of</b> <b>hands.</b> Scientists believe a mutation caused the ancient trait to reassert itself as a form of atavism.|$|E

500|$|At {{the start}} of his career, Boycott was a below average fielder, having {{received}} no coaching on this from Yorkshire and with little inclination to rectify it when concentrating on his batting. A fellow Yorkshire batsman Ken Taylor worked with Boycott, who was [...] "limited in [...] ability, [...] " [...] but had [...] "tremendous determination". With further help from his two brothers Boycott's fielding improved. He became a safe <b>pair</b> <b>of</b> <b>hands</b> generally at cover point, though he continued to lack power and pace in the field, never taking more than two catches in a Test innings, and averaging 0.170 dismissals per innings with 33 career catches in all. He would remark in his autobiography that his usual fielding positions depended not on the tactical situation but on whether the captain was one of Boycott's critics, who would therefore banish him to a remote part of the field.|$|E
500|$|Artists of the sōsaku-hanga ("creative prints") {{movement}} {{took control}} of {{every aspect of the}} printmaking process—design, carving, and printing were by the same <b>pair</b> <b>of</b> <b>hands.</b> [...] Kanae Yamamoto (1882–1946), then a student at the Tokyo School of Fine Arts, is credited with the birth of this approach. In 1904, he produced Fisherman using woodblock printing, a technique until then frowned upon by the Japanese art establishment as old-fashioned and for its association with commercial mass production. [...] The foundation of the Japanese Woodcut Artists' Association in 1918 marks the beginning of this approach as a movement. [...] The movement favoured individuality in its artists, and as such has no dominant themes or styles. [...] Works ranged from the entirely abstract ones of Kōshirō Onchi (1891–1955) to the traditional figurative depictions of Japanese scenes of Un'ichi Hiratsuka (1895–1997). [...] These artists produced prints not because they hoped to reach a mass audience, but as a creative end in itself, and did not restrict their print media to the woodblock of traditional ukiyo-e.|$|E
500|$|In the panel, {{the relief}} shows a headdress (double-folded) with two pleats draped towards the female head (Parvati) {{and the right}} side (Shiva) {{depicting}} curled hair and a crescent.

500|$|Rasmussen and Metallica did {{not manage}} to {{complete}} the mixtapes as planned. Instead, the multitracks were sent in January 1986 to Michael Wagener, who finished the album's mixing. The cover was designed by Metallica and Peter Mensch and painted by Don Brautigam. It depicts a cemetery field of white crosses tethered to strings, manipulated by a <b>pair</b> <b>of</b> <b>hands</b> in a blood-red sky. Ulrich explained that the artwork summarized the lyrical content of the album—people being subconsciously manipulated. The original artwork was sold at Rockefeller Plaza, New York City for $28,000 in 2008. The band mocked the warning stickers promoted by the PMRC with a facetious Parental Advisory label on the cover: [...] "The only track you probably won't want to play is 'Damage, Inc.' due to the multiple use of the infamous 'F' word. Otherwise, there aren't any 'shits', 'fucks', 'pisses', 'cunts', 'motherfuckers', or 'cocksuckers' anywhere on this record". The album was recorded with the following equipment: Hammett's guitars were a black 1974 Gibson Flying V, a black Jackson Randy Rhoads, and a black Fernandes Stratocaster-inspired model nicknamed [...] "Edna"; Hetfield used a Jackson King V played through a Mesa Boogie Mark C+ amplifier modified as a pre-amp; Burton played an Aria Pro II SB1000 through Mesa Boogie amplifier heads and cabinets; Ulrich played Tama drum equipment, and borrowed a rare S.L.P. Black Brass from Def Leppard drummer Rick Allen, who had lost his arm in a car accident.|$|E
500|$|The promotional {{music video}} for [...] "Ice Hockey Hair" [...] was {{directed}} by Daf Palfrey and appears on the DVD version of the band's 'greatest hits' album [...] The video begins with silent footage of five characters, who appear in a small white rectangle in {{the centre of the}} screen against a black background.

[...] "Ice Hockey Hair" [...] begins playing approximately 17 seconds into the video. Each character is again seen in a white rectangle in the centre of the screen followed by a shot of a <b>pair</b> <b>of</b> <b>hands</b> holding a strip of photos of that particular person during which red text is displayed showing the character's name. A woman with short blonde hair and a red top, seen holding {{her head in her hands}} is introduced as [...] "The wife"; a bald man with blood on his head is [...] "The husband"; a woman in a white jacket with a blonde mullet hairstyle is [...] "The mistress"; a man with thick-rimmed glasses, a white jacket, and red polo neck sweater is [...] "The voyeur"; and a man in a red and black tracksuit top with a large scar running from his left eye to right cheek is [...] "The stalker". The five characters are all seen singing along to the track individually, again framed in a white rectangle in the centre of the screen. [...] "The wife" [...] is twice shown ripping a photograph of her and [...] "The husband", while [...] "The mistress" [...] is seen sitting on the lap of [...] "The husband" [...] in two shots. After 1 minute and 6 seconds the Super Furry Animals are shown playing along to the track on a rotating dancefloor surrounded by photo booths and several dancers in dark clothes. During an instrumental break in the song, at 1 minute 38 seconds, two masked men are shown playing table tennis on another rotating dancefloor with two large fluorescent purple circles in the background. The five characters are then seen walking around the band and stepping into the photo booths that surround them. The text [...] "Act 1: The kiss" [...] is shown, after which footage of the Super Furry Animals playing along to the track is intercut with shots of the characters. [...] "The husband" [...] and [...] "The mistress" [...] kiss while a strip of photos is seen being passed through a <b>pair</b> <b>of</b> <b>hands</b> and [...] "The voyeur" [...] is shown using a video camera. The characters move to different photo booths and the title [...] "Act 2: The stalking" [...] is displayed. Shots of [...] "The stalker" [...] and [...] "The wife" [...] are then intercut with shots of the band. The characters again change booths and the title [...] "Act 3: The murder" [...] is shown. After quick jump cuts between shots of the band, the masked men playing table tennis and the five characters, [...] "The voyeur" [...] is shown pointing his video camera at the motionless body of [...] "The mistress" [...] which is laid in a bathtub covered in film stock. More footage of the band follows before [...] "The husband" [...] is shown motionless of the floor, surrounded by a white tape outline. The video ends with more jump cuts between the band, the masked table tennis players and the five named characters.|$|E
500|$|Terence Stamp's {{name was}} {{deliberately}} {{kept out of}} the opening credits {{in order to keep the}} secret he was voicing Jor-El. Stamp originally portrayed General Zod in the first two Superman films, starring Christopher Reeve. Gough and Millar wanted to provide answers for certain aspects of the Superman mythology, so at the start of season three they tied Jonathan's heart condition to Jor-El, where Jonathan makes a deal with Jor-El to be given the power to bring Clark back. This power ultimately puts a strain on Jonathan's heart. The refusal by the film department to allow Smallville to cast a body as a physical representation of Jor-El forced the special effects crew to come up with a creative way to display some sort of aid to help the audience visualize this disembodied voice which was supposed to be talking to Jonathan in season three's [...] "Exile". They decided to create a force field around whoever was speaking to Jor-El, which acted as Jor-El's voice, rippling as he spoke. To save money on this effect, the crew filmed John Schneider on a black backdrop, and Entity FX digitally added the force field around him. Wind machines and a spot light were added to help synthesize the atmosphere in the force field. At the time of season three's [...] "Memoria", where a scene depicting Jor-El and Lara placing baby Kal-El into his ship before the destruction of Krypton was scripted, Warner Bros. was working on a new Superman film, and it was going to be an origin story, and as a result was still banning Smallville from showing Jor-El. Millar was forced to take inspiration from comic book scribe Jeph Loeb. In one of Loeb's book, Jor-El and Lara are depicted as just a <b>pair</b> <b>of</b> <b>hands</b> holding on to each other after they place Kal-El into his spaceship. In season nine, the producers were able to provide the character with a physical appearance, and Julian Sands was cast for the role.|$|E
