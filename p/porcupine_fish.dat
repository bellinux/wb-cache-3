2500|$|Tetrodotoxin (TTX) is {{a poison}} {{produced}} by organisms {{belonging to the}} Tetradontidae order, which includes the puffer fish, ocean sunfish, and <b>porcupine</b> <b>fish.</b> Within the puffer fish, which is a common delicacy especially in Japan, TTX {{is found in the}} liver, gonads, ovaries, intestines, and skin. TTX can be fatal if consumed, and has become a common form of poisoning in many countries. Common symptoms of TTX consumption include paraesthesia (often restricted to the mouth and limbs), muscle weakness, nausea, and vomiting and often manifest within 30 minutes of ingestion. The primary mechanism by which TTX is toxic is through the inhibition of sodium channel function, which reduces the functional capacity of neuron communication. This inhibition largely affects a susceptible subset of sodium channels known as TTX-sensitive (TTX-s), which also happens to be largely responsible for the sodium current that drives the depolarization phase of neuron action potentials. [...] TTX-resistant (TTX-r) is another form of sodium channel which has limited sensitivity to TTX, and is largely found in small diameter axons such as those found in nociception neurons. When significant levels of TTX is ingested, it will bind sodium channels on neurons and reduce their membrane permeability to sodium. This results in an increased effective threshold of required excitatory signals in order to induce an action potential in a postsynaptic neuron. The effect of this increased signaling threshold is a reduced excitability of postsynaptic neurons, and subsequent loss of motor and sensory function which can result in paralysis and death. Though assisted ventilation may increase the chance of survival after TTX exposure, there is currently no antitoxin. The use of the acetylcholinesterase inhibitor Neostigmine or the muscarinic acetylcholine antagonist Atropine (which will inhibit parasympathetic activity), however, can increase sympathetic nerve activity enough to improve the chance of survival after TTX exposure.|$|E

These included four species of haemogregarines (Adeleorina, Haemogregarinidae) and a species of trypanosome (Trypanosomatina, Trypanosomatidae) located in <b>Porcupine</b> Seabight <b>fishes.</b> Also present were Haemohormidium-like structures of uncertain status found in samples from this location and from the Cape Verde Islands. Although material was limited, two of the haemogregarines were provisionally named Desseria harriottae sp. n. from Harriotta raleighana Goode et Bean (Chimaeriformes, Rhinochimaeridae), and Haemogregarina bathysauri sp. n. from Bathysaurus ferox Günther (Aulopiformes, Bathysauridae). The two remaining haemogregarines were identified as Desseria marshalllairdi (Khan, Threlfall et Whitty, 1992) from Halosauropsis macrochir (Günther) (Notacanthiformes, Halosauridae), and Haemogregarina michaeljohnstoni (Davies et Merrett, 2000) from Cataetyx laticeps Koefoed (Ophidiformes, Bythitidae). The name H. michaeljohnstoni was proposed to replace Haemogregarinajohnstoni Davies et Merrett, 2000 from C. laticeps and to avoid confusion with Hepatozoon johnstoni (Mackerras, 1961) Smith, 1996 from varanid lizards, originally named Haemogregarina johnstoni Mackerras, 1961. The trypanosome formed a mixed parasitaemia with D. harriottae in H. raleighana and was provisionally named Trypanosoma harriottae sp. n. No blood parasites had been described previously from cartilaginous fishes of the Holocephali, making the finds in H. raleighana unique.

40|$|The Marine Institute {{with the}} {{collaboration}} of the National University of Galway conducted a multidisciplinary deepwater survey along the continental {{slope of the}} Northeast Atlantic. At three selected sites northwest of Ireland and on the northern slopes of the <b>Porcupine</b> Bank, <b>fishing</b> transects were carried out at four depth strata (500 m, 1000 m 1500 m and 1800 m) during the day, while oceanographic measurements and plankton and benthic invertebrate sampling was carried out during the night. Data from CTD and ADCP measurements showed following distribution of water masses: The top 700 m was occupied by that of Eastern North Atlantic Water (ENAW) origin which is a basic feature of the upper layer hydrography in the Rockall Trough; small salinity maxima indicated the region associated with {{the core of the}} shelf edge current (SEC). At Area 6, immediately north of Porcupine Bank, a salinity maximum at a depth of 900 - 1000 m indicated the presence of Mediterranean Outflow Water (MOW) with the presence Labrador Sea Water (LSW) at 1800 - 2000 m. The SEC was identified in both CTD and ADCP transects and was characterised by a number of relatively narrow filaments evident in the salinity data. In terms of benthic invertebrate data, a total of 104 taxa were identified with a maximum number of 33 invertebrate taxa identified per haul (these values were recorded at two 1500 m hauls in 2006 and 2007, in Areas 5 and 2, respectively). Overall, no clear relationship between the number of invertebrate species and depth was apparent, however there was some indication that the number of species appears to be more variable in deeper waters. Several species occurred in very large numbers; these were the echinoderms, Cidaris cidaris, Benthegone rosea and Stichopus tremulus and the bivalve, Pseudammusium septemradii. Fisheries data revealed distinct deepwater fish communities that changed with depth {{and to a lesser extent}} with area. The number of species increased with depth at all sites to reach a maximum at 1500 m before decreasing again at 1800 m. At 500 m depth the fish community was mainly composed of rabbit fish and rattails with some shelf species present such as hake, ling and silver pout. The 1000 m depth strata presented a transition of species composition. The most abundant species overall was Roundnose grenadier which had is highest abundance at 1500 m in all three areas but could also be found in the 1000 and 18000 m depth strata. Other species of high abundance which also had their highest number of individuals at 1500 m were Baird’s smoothhead and other species of grenadiers. Cluster analysis revealed that Roundnose grenadier was a distinct species grouping as was that of Baird’s smoothhead. Species occurrences were similar in all three areas with some regional differences; in area 2, Phycis blennoides, greater forkbeard,occurred among the ten most abundant species while in area 5, species, such as Black Scabbard, Aphanopus carbo, and cut throat eel, Synaphobranchus kaupi, were being caught here in larger numbers while present in the other areas in low numbers. Seven comparative tows were carried out with the Scottish research vessels RV Scotia and indicated that overall similar numbers of species and total number of fish were caught. Size distribution also compared well between the two different vessels, however for some species the numbers or size ranges of fish caught differed.

Anastomoses were found to originate from a variety of different primary blood vessels, many of which have not been previously identified as giving rise to secondary vessels. Segmental arteries derived from the dorsal aorta and supplying body musculature were major sites of origin of the SVS, although there was considerable variation in where, in the hierarchy of arterial branching, the anastomoses occurred. The degree of investment in a SVS was species specific, with more active species having a higher degree of secondary vascularisation. This difference was quantified using an absolute count of iaas between Anguilla reinhardtii and Trachinotus baillonii. A range of general features of the SVS is also described. No evidence of iaas was found on the coeliac, mesenteric or renal circulation in any species. Evidence of interarterial anastomoses were lacking in the dipnoan (Sarcopterygii) and chondrichthyan species examined, suggesting that a SVS is restricted to actinopterygian fishes. The presence and distribution of a secondary vascular system {{does not appear to be}} exclusively linked to phylogenetic position, but rather to the physiological adaptation of the species. Histological sections of primary segmental arteries and associated interarterial anastomoses and secondary vessels from the long-finned eel, Anguilla reinhardtii, were examined by light and transmission electron microscopy. Secondary vessels were found to originate from the primary vasculature as depressions through the tunica intima and media, from where they ran perpendicularly to the adventitial layer, before coiling extensively. From here the anastomoses travelled a relatively linear path in the outer margin of the adventitia to re-anastomose with a secondary vessel running in parallel with the primary counterpart. Secondary vessels had a structure quite similar to that of primary vessels; they were lined by endothelial cells on a continuous basement membrane, surrounded by single layer of smooth muscle cells surrounding the vessel. Smooth muscle cells were also found in the vicinity of interarterial anastomoses in the adventitia, but these were more longitudinally orientated. The presence of smooth muscle cells on all aspects of the secondary circulation suggests that this vascular system is regulated in a similar manner as the primary vascular system. Because interarterial anastomoses are structurally integrated with the primary vessel from which they originate, it was anticipated that flow through secondary vessels would to some extent be affected by an increase in primary vascular tone. Immunohistochemical studies showed that primary segmental arteries displayed moderate immunoreactivity to antibodies against 5 -hydroxytryptamine and substance P, while interarterial anastomoses and secondary vessels showed dense immunoreactivity. Secondary vessels were followed to the surface of the animal through consecutive sections, where they eventually give rise to capillary beds overlying the scales. Secondary capillary beds were found to supply chloride cells in the skin, suggesting that this vascular system may be involved in cutaneous ionic exchange. Branchial vascular casts from two species of Tetraodontiformes showed that the vessels previously reported as nutrient vessels are with certainty part of the secondary vascular system. In the three-barred <b>porcupine</b> <b>fish,</b> Dicotylichthys punctulatus, interarterial anastomoses originated at high densities from efferent filamental and the efferent branchial arteries, from where they formed progressively larger secondary vessels. Small branches of this vascular system entered the filament body, where it gave rise to numerous side-vessels along the way. Large secondary vessels running in parallel with the efferent branchial arteries were found to constitute an additional arterio-arterial pathway, in that they exited the branchial basket in company with the afferent mandibular artery, the carotid artery and the efferent branchial arteries, from where they gave rise to vascular beds immediately after exit. The secondary vessels in this species were not found to supply the filament musculature; rather this vascular system was supplied by a single vessel derived from the efferent branchial artery, running in parallel with the afferent branchial artery. Secondary vessels were not found on any branchial component in the banded toadfish, Marylina pleurosticta, but in all other aspects the branchial vascular anatomy was similar to that of D. punctulatus. It is proposed that four independent vascular pathways may be present in the teleostean gill. The blood volume and flow rates of the primary (PVS) and secondary vascular system (SVS) were examined in the catadromous euryhaline teleost Lates calcarifer in order to determine whether any of these parameters were subject to change in individuals acclimated to seawater, compared to a group acclimated to freshwater. There was no significant difference in any measured parameter for the two groups. The volumes of the SVS were 0. 67 b 0. 13 and 0. 76 b 0. 13 mL 100 g- 1 body mass for FW and SW acclimated animals respectively. This constituted approximately one-third of the total blood volume in both groups. Turnover times for the SVS ranged from 21. 0 to 25. 2 minutes, demonstrating in accordance with previous publications, that this system is considerably more dynamic than previously assumed...|$|E
