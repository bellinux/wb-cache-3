5000|$|... #Caption: The Far East used a {{different}} method of sawing logs than the West's method of <b>pit-sawing</b> with a saw pit: The concept {{is the same}} but as shown here the log is angled and no pit is used.|$|E
5000|$|The name [...] "Gwennap" [...] {{originates}} from Hancock's {{birthplace of}} Gwennap, Cornwall. At {{the age of}} 16 his family emigrated to Australia. They arrived in Sydney on 1 November 1856. Josias' father, Thomas, the elder brother of local builder William Hancock, moved to Queensland in 1864 and eventually established a <b>pit-sawing</b> business at Pine Mountain, later purchasing timber mills at Rosewood and Ipswich.|$|E
40|$|The Kakamega Forest lies 150 {{kilometres}} {{west of the}} Rift Valley in Kenya at {{an altitude}} of 1600 metres. It is the only surviving rain forest in Kenya and the eastern-most fragment of the Guinea-Congolian rainforest, which once stretched from Kenya across Uganda, Central Africa, and the West African Coast. Covering an area of 230 square kilometres, the forest is home to a considerable variety of habitat, including rainforest, swamp and riverine forest, colonising forest, disturbed forest, forestry plantations, natural glades, and recent clearings made for <b>pit-sawing</b> and charcoal burning [...] . ...|$|E
5000|$|When {{used for}} {{different}} purposes may have other {{names such as}} for converting logs into lumber they are also called a <b>pit-saw</b> or whipsaw and for sawing veneer may simply be called a veneer saw. It is unknown how early framed <b>pit-saws</b> came into use however there is an Italian fresco from [...] depicting their use.|$|R
50|$|In 1849, Joseph Logue {{arrived in}} the area and farmed at nearby Cookernup. He was {{followed}} by W.J. Eastcott, who used to collect red gum bark and <b>pit-sawn</b> timber for other settlers, and John Bancells in 1886.|$|R
50|$|It is a rare, early 1880s rural {{general store}} in north Queensland {{retaining}} original <b>pit-sawn</b> cedar chamfers; {{and the interior}} offers rare illustration of a highly intact 19th century drapery store with early shelving, counter and seating.|$|R
40|$|Timber is an {{important}} commodity in African towns. This paper reports the findings from research into the supply of timber to Dar es Salaam and Mwanza (Tanzania). Tanzania has reserves of hardwood timber in the natural forest and softwood timber in plantations. Information gathered from consumers, producers and traders was used to estimate consumption, analyse changing patterns of supply and assess sustainability. Analysis of the hardwood supply system (presented as a sub-sector diagram) {{found it to be}} ‘slippery’, evolving in response to diminishing resources and a cumbersome and ineffective regulatory regime. With the advent of <b>pit-sawing</b> and other changes, control over the cutting of timber in the natural forest has been lost. Regaining control is unlikely unless effective local community participation can be established. Sustainable management in the plantations is achievable and offers the best chance of ensuring a supply of timber to meet future demands...|$|E
50|$|Fairview, {{constructed}} in 1907 of local Beech sp. cut, <b>pit-sawn</b> and dressed on the property, {{is important in}} demonstrating the early development of Maleny as an agricultural settlement {{and the expansion of}} dairying in Queensland in the early 1900s.|$|R
6000|$|... "I can't {{say that}} I have," [...] {{answered}} the interpreter, with a matter-of-fact frown at the ground, [...] "but I {{have noticed that}} the <b>pit-saw</b> they was usin' yesterday {{has been allowed to}} saw into the holdin'-irons and damaged half o'--" ...|$|R
50|$|Talgai Homestead {{was built}} of {{sandstone}} and covered sixty squares. The original roof was of shingles and the verandahs of hand and <b>pit-sawn</b> spotted gum, with cedar doors and architraves. Unlike the usual design for that period, {{the kitchen was}} attached to the main house.|$|R
6000|$|... "Lumley," [...] said I, [...] "it {{has often}} {{occurred}} to me that it takes a terrible deal of time to cut trees into planks with our <b>pit-saws,</b> and occupies far too much of the time of two men who might be much more profitably employed." ...|$|R
50|$|The {{windows are}} between {{uprights}} of bush timber, {{as are the}} doors. The floors are of <b>pit-sawn</b> boards fastened to the bearers in places with large rectangular wooden pegs cut from pieces of <b>pit-sawn</b> timber. The sawpit is still visible close behind the building, though it has been filled in for safety reasons. Some sections originally open have been built in. The front wall, most interior walls and the ceilings of the main section are clad with beaded boards. The main room is lined with wide plain boards and has a stencilled dado on the end walls. The upper wall is pale blue and the lower wall pinkish grey, divided by a pink line and a grey/pink stencilled anthemion pattern above. Some boards which carried part of this design have been removed.|$|R
50|$|Boyette Slave House is a {{historic}} home located near Kenly, Johnston County, North Carolina. It is a small one-room log dwelling. It is built of hewn and <b>pit-sawn</b> plans and features a gable end stick and mud chimney. The building measures 16 feet by 12 feet and 8 feet tall.|$|R
50|$|Due {{to the age}} and intactness of the place, in {{particular}} the house clad in iron bark slabs and <b>pit-sawn</b> timbers and the mature trees of the garden, Gracemere Homestead {{has the potential to}} yield information through historical and archaeological research that will contribute to an improved understanding of Queensland's history.|$|R
50|$|At {{an early}} date, Jack sold his {{share in the}} Great Northern to {{merchant}} and mining entrepreneur John Moffatt, and set up Herberton's first store, in a small bark hut. Jack probably did not erect the more substantial premises of <b>pit-sawn</b> cedar chamfers until after he purchased the store site in October 1881.|$|R
5000|$|Wallcliffe House was a {{heritage}} listed two-storey stone, shingle and corrugated iron homestead located near Prevelly and {{the mouth of}} the Margaret River in Western Australia. [...] It was built by Alfred and Ellen Bussell (née Heppingstone) between 1857 and 1865 in the Victorian-Georgian style, using limestone quarried on the property and <b>pit-sawn</b> jarrah.|$|R
50|$|On arrival, {{the party}} went first to Cawarral, where Mary and the {{children}} remained until the first bark and slab huts were erected at Raspberry Creek. These huts were about three miles from the site finally selected and were later moved. The present homestead was built using <b>pit-sawn</b> timber for the walls and shingles for the roof.|$|R
50|$|This single-skin timber {{building}} is clad in deep, <b>pit-sawn</b> chamferboard and features timber pilasters to the Grace Street shop fronts. Both shops have central entrances {{and a recent}} shop has been built on the lower {{side of the building}} to the northwest boundary. This shop has a timber gable parapet and a street awning to mimic the original shops.|$|R
50|$|The little slab cottage next to {{the shop}} was built around this time and was later used to store produce for the shop. The cottage-like {{appearance}} is more recent and had resembled a barn {{for most of its}} life. It was built of <b>pit-sawn</b> vertical slabs and given a snow roof, typical of the buildings of that time and altitude.|$|R
5000|$|A pit saw was {{a two-man}} rip saw. In parts of early colonial North America, {{it was one of}} the {{principal}} tools used in shipyards and other industries where water-powered sawmills were not available. It was so-named because it was typically operated over a saw pit, either at ground level or on trestles across which logs that were to be cut into boards. The pit saw was [...] "a strong steel cutting-plate, of great breadth, with large teeth, highly polished and thoroughly wrought, some eight or ten feet in length" [...] with either a handle on each end or a frame saw. A <b>pit-saw</b> was also sometimes known as a whipsaw. It took 2-4 people to operate. A [...] "pit-man" [...] stood in the pit, a [...] "top-man" [...] stood outside the pit, and they worked together to make cuts, guide the saw, and raise it. <b>Pit-saw</b> workers were among the most highly paid laborers in early colonial North America.|$|R
50|$|The {{western wall}} has deep chamferboards {{which may be}} <b>pit-sawn.</b> The {{verandah}} has been closed in with flyscreen, but retains its splayed, chamfered verandah posts. The eastern verandah has been extended out to the east to form {{part of a large}} living room; the verandah posts, also splayed and chamfered, are now in the centre of this room, which links the original homestead remains {{to the rest of the}} later additions.|$|R
60|$|Another {{piece of}} work that Lumley gave me to superintend at this time was the {{construction}} of a water-wheel and dam to drive our <b>pit-saw.</b> You see, I had a turn for mechanics, and {{was under the impression that}} my powers in that way were greater than they afterwards turned out to be. We were sitting at tea alone in our hall at the time the subject was mooted.|$|R
5000|$|The {{main house}} is a two-room high-set {{timber-frame}} building clad with corrugated galvanised iron. The building is elevated on bush timber stumps of a local ironwood. Two upstairs bedrooms form a central core with enclosed verandahs on three sides. The upstairs floor is of <b>pit-sawn</b> boards on a <b>pit-sawn</b> frame. Upstairs rooms are externally clad with wide horizontal chamferboards, beaded on the inside at joints to give a narrow pattern on the interior. The rooms are internally clad with narrower horizontal boards that also form the ceiling. Internal cross-wall partitions are clad in corrugated iron on sawn timber studs. Bays of timber louvre shutters enclose the front and sides of the upstairs verandah area above the former handrail. Corrugated iron cladding has been added below the handrail. The verandah area also contains corrugated iron push-out shutters. A gable hip roof clad with corrugated iron covers the central core of the building. Roof rafters are of sapling bush timber. Original purlins are pit sawn, with some milled timber purlins introduced [...] and in 1986.|$|R
50|$|The Johnsontown Tobacco Barn No. 2 is a {{historic}} tobacco barn in Charles County, Maryland, near La Plata. The barn was built c. 1820, and provides evidence of early use of fire in the tobacco curing process. The framing of the barn is hand-hewn timbers secured by wooden pegs, with <b>pit-sawn</b> secondary framing members. The exterior is sheathed in vertical board siding, although {{there is evidence that}} it was originally sheathed in horizontal siding.|$|R
5000|$|Hope was {{influential}} {{in establishing the}} sugar industry in Queensland, producing the colony's first commercially milled sugar at Ormiston in 1864. [...] The land on which St Andrews Church stands was purchased by Hope from Thomas Lodge Murray-Prior in mid-1863. [...] The chapel {{is believed to have}} been constructed by James Yorston, a Scottish employee on Hope's estate. The timber was cut at Ormiston, <b>pit-sawn</b> to size, and dressed and shaped with an adze.|$|R
2500|$|In 1829 Stirling {{selected}} [...] {{of land in}} Harvey {{and called}} it the [...] "Harvey River Settlement". [...] However, the only improvement made was a convict built cottage {{on the banks of}} the Harvey River. [...] The cottage featured a shingled roof and <b>pit-sawn</b> jarrah walls with hexagonal-shaped paving blocks fitted together to form firm flooring. [...] A replica cottage known as Stirling's Cottage has been built on the site and includes one of the original paving blocks in its history room.|$|R
60|$|The {{openings}} {{between the}} logs {{of the houses}} were caulked {{with a mixture of}} mud and moss, and left in that condition in the meantime, until the <b>pit-saw</b> could be set to work to produce boards for the better protection of the walls without and within. The window and door frames were also made, and covered temporarily with parchment, until the arrival of the ship should enable them to fill the former with glass and the latter with broad panels.|$|R
50|$|It is a {{rectangular}} timber structure set on low stumps with a gabled roof clad in corrugated iron. The roof over the rear section is angled {{down from the}} main roof, suggesting it was a verandah that had been extended and built in. The floor joists, studs and rafters are split and adze dressed. An open verandah runs along {{the front of the}} building supported on plain timber posts. The building shows evidence of being constructed in stages, the walls containing examples of split slabs, hand dressed chamferboards, <b>pit-sawn</b> weatherboards and machine-sawn boards.|$|R
5000|$|Developed {{with the}} earlier Spanish {{settlements}} in the Caribbean and Mexico, the Spanish Colonial style in the United States {{can be traced back}} to St. Augustine, Florida, the oldest established city in the country, founded in 1565. The early type of dwelling in Spanish Florida was the [...] "board house", a small one-room cottage constructed of <b>pit-sawn</b> softwood boards, typically with a thatched roof. During the 18th century, the [...] "common houses" [...] were whitewashed in lime mortar with an oyster shell aggregate. Typically two-story, the houses included cooling porches to accommodate the Florida climate.|$|R
60|$|Soon a <b>pit-saw</b> {{which we}} had brought with us was set to work, and planks began to multiply. Henri Coppet and his men swung their great axes, and trees began to fall around, and to take unwonted shapes. The ring of Marcelle Dumont's anvil was heard from morn till eve, echoing through the wild-woods; and {{powerful}} bands, and nuts, and screws, of varied size and form, were evolved from our bundle of iron bars. Thus the whole party wrought with untiring energy, and our future abode began to grow.|$|R
5|$|In 1857 he {{returned}} to architecture and entered into a business partnership with his sister Susannah's new husband, Isaac Luck. Mountfort's career received a fillip when he was commissioned to design the St John's Anglican church at Waikouaiti in Otago. A small timber structure in the Gothic style, it was completed on 19 December 1858 on land donated by the ex-whaler Johnny Jones. It is still in use as a church, the oldest such structure in southern New Zealand. Now {{within the boundaries of}} the city of Dunedin its simple <b>pit-sawn</b> timber interior successfully conjures a sense of spirituality.|$|R
50|$|The 1878 {{building}} provided bedrooms for {{the expanding}} Grigor family, and a kitchen for the accommodation house, and {{was connected to}} the 1868 building by a covered walkway. It was built on timber stumps, out of <b>pit-sawn</b> timber. The eastern, southern and western external walls used beech, with exposed studs on the east and west sides under the two verandahs. Hardwood weatherboards were used on the north side, which also had an attic window. Beech was also used for the internal walls and ceilings, and cedar was used for the doors and windows. The high-pitched gabled roof was clad in corrugated iron.|$|R
50|$|During the 1890s, {{most of the}} Mapleton {{settlers}} {{resided in}} slab huts while they established their farms and orchards. DJ Williams reputedly {{was the first to}} erect a <b>pit-sawn</b> timber house, in 1895. By August 1897, when WJ Smith was applying for a title to his selection, the family was still residing in a 22 x 18 feet, 4-roomed split timber dwelling with a shingled roof, valued at £20. They had about 8 acres of their 160 acres cleared and planted with fruit trees, 2 acres partly cleared and under grass, and 6 acres felled. Having fulfilled the conditions of selection, title was issued to WJ Smith in January 1898.|$|R
50|$|It is a modest, single-storeyed, exposed-frame timber building, {{constructed}} of <b>pit-sawn</b> and hand-dressed local beech and wall and ceiling linings, red cedar joinery, tallowwood and wall plates and hardwoods (wall framing and roof structure), and set on low timber stumps. It has a steeply pitched roof, with corrugated iron covering the original shingle battens, and two dormer {{windows on the}} southwest side, opening from an attic space. The four-roomed core is surrounded by verandahs with simple chamfered posts supporting the verandah roofs, which extend from the main roof at a different pitch. These are unlined, and the early shingle battens are visible. French doors open from each room onto the verandahs.|$|R
50|$|After {{a decade}} of {{extension}} (ca. 1854) the Collins's slab hut became essentially the homestead that stands today (the Old Homestead). The outer walls consist of <b>pit-sawn</b> local cedar. Wide verandas exemplify the residences of the period. An outside cooking shed was erected {{to reduce the risk}} of fire. The eldest sons, Robert and William, helped introduce cattle (sheep were moved to properties further west when they proved unsuitable for coastal country). Another homestead, built on the property in 1915 by the Fraser family—descendants of the Collins, burnt down in 1939. The Old Homestead is still inhabited by the Fraser family, who continue to run the property which occupied just over 3000 ha in 2011.|$|R
50|$|The kitchen {{house is}} located {{to the south}} of the {{residence}} and is linked via a covered walkway. It has a corrugated iron gable roof with verandahs to three sides, the southeast wall being of weatherboard and containing a stove recess. The building has both timber and concrete stumps, with a timber batten skirt to the perimeter. The northeast verandah has weatherboard infill below the hand rail, with timber rail balustrade to the northwest and southwest. The verandah soffits are unlined and the southern corner has been enclosed to form a bathroom. The northwest wall of the kitchen house is constructed of split logs laid vertically, and the southwest wall is of <b>pit-sawn</b> vertical boards.|$|R
