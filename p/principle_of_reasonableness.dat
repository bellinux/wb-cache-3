40|$|Rights are, {{without a}} doubt, the most {{outstanding}} feature of contemporary legal systems. It {{can be argued that}} since the middle of the past century we are immersed in a culture of rights. Neoconstitutionalism is one among other such concepts that has been used to designate and study this phenomenon. The hypothesis we will attempt to address in this paper {{is that some of the}} central characters of our culture of rights, here termed as “neoconstitutionalism,” cannot be explained consistently without an explicit reference to natural law. We will specifically examine the connection between the assertion that there exist natural law principles of justice and the following characteristics of our culture of rights: a) the recognition of rights; b) the reference of state or national legal systems to supranational legal systems; c) constitutions as a result of a network of principles and rules; d) the principle of proportionality; and e) the <b>principle</b> <b>of</b> <b>reasonableness.</b> While the first three characteristics constitute the structure of any neo-constitutional practice, the two latter ones are features of the processes of legal reception and legal allocation of rights in such a legal practice. This paper aims to show that, ultimately, identifying, explaining, and understanding each and all of these five characteristics of contemporary legal culture depends upon the existence of a normative resort that goes beyond the legal culture itself.

The {{purpose of}} this mini-dissertation is to {{investigate}} the possibility of applying the turquand-rule as well as lifting the corporate veil in the law of trusts. Usually the turquand-rule is only applicable in the Company law. This theory, however was threatened after the decision in Man Truck & Bus (SA) Ltd v Victor en Andere 2001 2 SA 562 (NK) and those cases that followed it. In this case {{the court ruled that}} the turquand-rule can also be applied in the law of trust. II based its decision on the <b>principles</b> <b>of</b> <b>reasonableness</b> and fairness. Critics have not been shy to give their opinion about the ruling, It is generally felt that the turquand-rule as well as the lifting the corporate veil cannot be applied in the South African law of trust because of two main issues, namely the fact that juristic personality does not vest in trusts and the fact that trustees must act together at all times. The validity of this critique will be placed under the microscope and all aspects concerning this issue will be separately dealt with. One of these aspects is the abuse of the trust that is taking place in South Africa. Trusts are used to manipulate family members, evade creditors and to obtain other advantages, like tax benefits. This is a concern to both academics and the man on the street. Some kind of remedy is thus needed to solve this dilemma. In my opinion it can be validly found in applying the turquand-rule and the llfting of the corporate veil also in the law of trusts. Master...|$|R

40|$|Sama riječ “jednakost” ima prilično snažnu i uvjerljivu retoričku snagu i to ne samo zbog stvari na koje se odnosi, nego i s obzirom na vrstu riječi. Ona ujedinjuje dvije paradoksalne značajke: čini se da je jedna stvar svim ljudima, a ipak različita za različite ljude. Izričaj Ustava Italije, kao i tumačenja Ustavnog suda Italije, otkrivaju shvaćanje da jednakost nikada ne djeluje samostalno i kao apstraktni koncept, već ju valja pojmiti u potpunosti i kompleksnosti životnog konteksta u potrazi za razumijevanjem što to znači puni razvoj osobnosti građana. Interpretativno oruđe, načelo razumnosti, komparatori i samostalni testovi primjenjuju se uz posredovanje st. 2. čl. 3. i ostalih ustavno zajamčenih ljudskih prava. Upravo posebne ustavne odredbe daju nam naslutiti kritične točke talijanskog društva u odnosu na načelo jednakosti: položaj žena, jezičnih manjina i međuvjerski odnosi. Significance {{attributed}} {{to the principle of}} equality in contemporary constitutional democracies of the national, supranational (EU) and international level (UN, CoE) is self-evident. Some of the most significant moral crusades in history have been fought and won in the name of “equality”: abolishment of slavery, elimination of feudal privilege, the spread of universal suffrage, the outlawing of racial discrimination, the emancipation of women, etc. The mere word “equality” has quite a powerful and persuasive rhetorical force not only because of what it refers to but also due to its very nature. It combines two paradoxical features: although it appears to have universal meaning, it seems to mean different things to different people. It is not the intention of this paper to analyse the equality principle in abstract terms, but rather to discuss the constitutional order of Italy, primarily through relevant constitutional case-law. The first chapter is an overview of the Italian constitutional framework within which the equality principle operates. The second part is dedicated to the case law of the Constitutional Court of the Republic of Italy from its beginnings until today. A special emphasis is given to the <b>principle</b> <b>of</b> <b>reasonableness,</b> the use of comparators, and the limits to the Court’s adjudication. The third part looks in detail at the relationship between paragraphs 1 and 2 of Article 3 of the Italian Constitution, i. e., the relationship between the concepts of formal and substantive equality. Special attention is paid to affirmative action programmes and particular interpretative techniques developed {{in the context of the}} concept of substantive equality. Both the wording of the Italian Constitution and the Constitutional Court’s interpretation disclose a belief that equality never stands alone as an abstract concept; instead it should be put in the full context of life, pursuing an understanding of what it means to be a full and flourishing person. The specific equality provisions of the Constitution point to the critical areas in the Italian society: the position of women, language minorities and inter-religious relations...|$|E
40|$|The {{debate over}} {{the scope of the}} concept of {{reasonableness}} - its application and use in testing the legality of normative conduct - is of long standing. Recently, {{it has been suggested that}} reasonableness be substituted for both legal and moral rightness. I go further in this Article and suggest reasonableness incorporates the goal of economic efficiency and that it is tested or shaped by a simple cost-benefit model that has its legal etiology in the equitable principle of balancing that, in turn, has its roots in the principle of Sic utere tuo ut alienum non laedas, or So use your own property as not to injure your neighbor. Here is to be found the guiding standard that seeks to unify and bind the law, that I submit operates as a fundamental truth at both trial and appellate levels of decisonmaking. Lower or trial courts are confronted almost daily with the need to make determinations for which no broad, discernible general principle of law is available. Thus, the totality of circumstances test regarding the reasonableness of a particular situation becomes the standard by which a factual determination is made. A counter argument suggests appellate judges should resist, whenever possible, application of the totality of circumstances and balancing tests because they are expositors of the law, not lower court fact finders; and because at the appellate level, the Rule of Law or, the law of rules, should be extended as far as the nature of the question allows. Such an argument fails to recognize the inextricable connection or relationship between balancing and its application in initial decisionmaking by the consumer through all phases of judicial and legislative analysis. Balancing of one form or other - be it of facts, rules or results - is to be found as an inherent part of the analytical process in all legal decisionmaking. If the word, balancing, is off-putting, it should be regarded as but a synonym for consider or take into account. The key should be to avoid semantic exercises which unduly obfuscate the primary goal for the courts of reaching reasonable decisions, or stated otherwise, those that are just, fair and wealth maximizing (e. g., efficient). A study of the law of nuisance serves as a paradigmatic focus for a consideration of the morphogenic or evolutionary exposition and development of the <b>principle</b> <b>of</b> <b>reasonableness</b> realized through application of the balancing of utilities, conveniences or costs, versus benefits, in specific reference to the revised doctrine of sic utere. Indeed, it is within the crucible of nuisance law that the practical foundations and the tests of reasonableness and economic efficiency are realized in both their original development and contemporary application. Stated otherwise, it is within nuisance law where the seedtime of economic jurisprudence flowers. There is a symbiotic, if not an inextricable or binding, relationship between both. In cases that challenge or test the degree to which one has acted reasonably in the use of his property, to achieve fairness (and thus efficiency), modern courts should, consistent with the Restatement (Second) of Torts, balance the relative hardships of the parties, substantively and procedurally, in deciding the initial characterization of whether the actions are a nuisance, and then, determine procedurally whether injunctive relief or damages are to be awarded. Stated otherwise, what is considered or balanced by a judge in every legal action is, essentially, the value of what is obtained (by holding for the plaintiff) versus the value of what is sacrificed to obtain it. And, again, it is seen clearly that practical reasoning dictates the use of the balancing principle...|$|E
40|$|The {{decision}} of a State regarding the stay {{of an individual}} {{who is not a}} citizen in its territory is subject to norms of International Law; nevertheless, those norms can have different recipients and ratio, and they may often end up being in mutual competition, so that one’s satisfaction means the other’s partial or total detriment. On one hand, States are allowed by International Law to freely determine their own population; on the other hand, migrants are beneficiaries of rights whose protection, due by the State, often limits its discretionary power: the difficult balance between interests of migrants and of the State’s (society) is hard to strike, and does not always result in the same outcome. This work mainly focuses on analyzing this tension, in order to study its possible future developments. The issue is dealt considering also the debate regarding “conflicts of norms” of International Law. After setting out the theoretical framework for this discussion, in light of the conflict between principle of protection of human dignity and principle of state sovereignty, we take into account those theories on the current structure of International Law, especially its unity and normative cohesion, and address them in the privileged perspective of International Migration Law. Many of those who endorse a unitary vision of International Law consider that the interpretive criteria for normative conflict resolution expressed in the Vienna Convention on the law of treaties (lex specialis, lex posterior, principles of hierarchy and of harmonization) are suited to solve the above-mentioned conflicts of norms; this is chiefly also the stance of the ILC, as well as of international jurisprudence. Nevertheless, this conclusion doesn’t appear to be fully satisfying/satisfactory. Alternative theories have been therefore examined; namely, those purporting the the fragmentation of International Law, and those suggesting a gradual change of focus in International Law, favouring the protection of human dignity at the expenses of State sovereignty. This would imply either the modification of sovereignty or, more radically, its reduction or elimination – which consequently would result in subordinating sovereignty to the principle of human rights protection. After a critical analysis of all those theories, this work attempts to identify the one that best describes the relation among norms of migrant protection and principle of State sovereignty, and best forecast its future developments. The attempt is pursued, firstly, by analysing the characteristic of a State’s power to exclude foreigners from its own territory (its nature, its forms and the place where it may be applied, possible exceptions), and by investigating its limits. The ius escludendi is limited by international norms as the principle of good faith, the prohibition of abuse of rights and of arbitrary acts and the <b>principle</b> <b>of</b> <b>reasonableness,</b> which may be invoked by interested States (notably, by the State of nationality of the individual in the exercise of diplomatic protection). However it hasn’t frequently happened in practice. More often, the obligation to admit foreigners or stateless persons stems from International Human Rights Law, which is related to the fulfilment of different international principles (the principle of protection of human dignity) and focuses on the wellness of human being. In general, we can observe {{an increase in the number}} of cases in which the State is internationally bound to choose in favour of the migrant’s interest, owed to the broadening scope of international human rights norms, as interpreted by international tribunals. Meanwhile, current events confirm the strong political pressure to broaden State discretion regarding the choice on the entrance and stay of migrants on their territories. All this contributes to the growth of the tension described above. In the light of the foregoing, the author favours solutions promoting the “verticalization” of State sovereignty, which should be exercised by fully considering the interests of the non-nationals who deal, in any way whatsoever, with States’ organs. ...|$|E
50|$|Chartier {{offers an}} {{understanding}} of property rights as contingent but tightly constrained social strategies—reflective {{of the importance of}} multiple, overlapping rationales for separate ownership and <b>of</b> natural law <b>principles</b> <b>of</b> practical <b>reasonableness,</b> defending robust but non-absolute protections for these rights {{in a manner similar to}} that employed by David Hume. This account is distinguished both from Lockean and neo-Lockean views which deduce property rights from the idea of self-ownership and from consequentialist accounts that might license widespread ad hoc interference with the possessions of groups and individuals. Chartier uses this account to ground a clear statement of the natural law basis for the view that solidaristic wealth redistribution by individual persons is often morally required, but as a response by individuals and grass-roots networks to particular circumstances rather than as a state-driven attempt to achieve a particular distributive pattern. He advances detailed arguments for workplace democracy rooted in such natural law principles as subsidiarity, defending it as morally desirable and as a likely outcome of the elimination of injustice rather than as something to be mandated by the state. He discusses natural law approaches to land reform and to the occupation of factories by workers. He objects on natural-law grounds to intellectual property protections, drawing on his theory of property rights more generally. And he develops a general natural law account of boycotts.|$|R

Generally, the internal logic of social networking sites like Facebook (sharing personal information with a broad range of ‘friends’) is contrary to the logic of health care systems (keeping breaches of confidentiality to a minimum). Social networking sites (SNS) could justifiably be used for contract tracing, provided that such use complies with the well-established norms of health care systems...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{concerns}} paragraph 30, 31 and 32 of the Consumer Insurance Act. The Consumer Insurane Act {{was adopted}} in 1981. It is applicable to combined insurance policies covering fire, burglery, liability, and certain other risks when the insured {{party is a}} consumer. In these cases, the Consumer Insurance Act is applicable to motor vehicle-, yachting- and travelling insurance contracts as well. Paragraph 30 - 32 deals with what may be called the secondary duties of the insured, meaning misrepresentation and non-disclosure {{at the time of}} taking out the insurance, failure to comply with safety regulations or to minimize loss, intentional or negligent causing of the event insured, increase of risk and failure to give notice to the insurer of the occurance of the event insured. The rules concerning these duties are mainly mandatory, and they provide that the insured shall not lose any of the indemnity to which he is entitled under the insurance contract, unless he has acted at least negligently. The consequence of a relevant breach of a duty is reduction of the indemnity so far as it is reasonable considering all the circumstances in the case. Special importance is to be given to the influence of the breach on the occurence and the extent of the loss and the degree of fault. Paragraph 30 - 32 also deals with the insurer's right to invoke contravention of an incidental obligation by persons other than the insured such as family-members or a person in charge of the damaged property (identification). The broad <b>principles</b> <b>of</b> <b>reasonableness</b> that are laid down in the rules of reduction should be regarded as a general guide for the formation of insurance conditions, in which more precise norms are supposed to be confirmed. This is meant {{to make it easier to}} predict the result of the interpretation of the rules. This dissertation has two purposes. Firstly it aims to describe and elucidate the interpretation of the rules of reduction. Secondary it deals with the process of the implementation of these rules. The study of how the law ought to be interpreted is based on traditional juridical method, while the examination of the process of the implementation is based on studies of insurance contracts and conclusions from The Public Complaints Board during the period of 1981 - 01 - 01 to 1995 - 11 - 30. In the dissertation it is shown that, after an introductory period of uncertainty, nowadays there is more or less consensus concerning how the reduction rules should be used. It is also argued that these rules has contributed to strenghten the position of the consumers, but it is also pointed out that it still is the insurance companies that have the power to decide what risks the insurance should include...|$|R
40|$|Socialiniai tinklai viešojoje erdvėje pasirodė 2005 m. – 2007 m. Nuo jų viešo pasirodymo internete praėjo septyneri metai, tačiau jų populiarumas vis dar auga. Pasaulyje priskaičiuojama apie 150 aktyviai veikiančių socialinių tinklų iš kurių net 13 turi daugiau nei po šimtą milijonų naudotojų. Socialinių tinklų veikimas paremtas informacijos sklaida t. y. įgyvendinant saviraiškos laisvės, informacijos laisvės bei teisės į informaciją nuostatas. Tačiau saviraiškos laisvė nėra absoliuti. Asmens saviraiška naudojantis informacijos laisve yra galima tiek, kiek tai nepažeidžia kito asmens teisių. Deja, ne visi socialinių tinklų naudotojai tuo vadovaujasi ir neretai nutinka taip, jog kitų asmenų teisės vis tik būna pažeistos. Teisės normomis įtvirtinta, kad žalą atsiradusią dėl kitų asmenų neteisėtų veiksmų, privalu atlyginti. Tiek romėnų teisėje, tiek ir įvairių valstybių civiliniuose kodeksuose numatyta, kad žalą atlygina teisės pažeidėjas asmeniškai arba asmuo, kuris yra atsakingas už teisės pažeidėjo veiksmus. Atsižvelgiant į šias teisės nuostatas bei tai, jog internetinėje erdvėje ne visuomet galima nustatyti tikruosius teisės pažeidėjus, kyla klausimas, ar socialinio tinklo valdytojas gali atsakyti už šio tinklo naudojo neteisėtais veiksmais padarytą žalą? Atlikus teisės aktų bei teismų praktikos analizę, buvo padarytos išvados, jog socialinių tinklų valdytojų atsakomybės klausimus teismai sprendžia vadovaudamiesi precedentais, kurie buvo priimti prieš du dešimtmečius, arba teisės aktais, kurie buvo sudarinėjami prieš daugiau nei dešimtmetį. Atsižvelgiant į sparčią informacinių technologijų kaitą, minimos teisės normos gali būti pasenę, neatitinkančios esamos situacijos. Dėl šios priežasties sprendžiant socialinių tinklų valdytojų atsakomybės klausimus, tais atvejais, kai dėl tinklų naudotojų neteisėtų veiksmų kyla grėsmė žmonių prigimtinėms teisėms, teismai privalo atsižvelgti į esamą situaciją ir vadovautis {{inter alia}} protingumo bei teisingumo principais. Pabrėžtina, kad teisėtumas nelaikytinas priežastimi pateisinant bet kokį elgesį ar jį formuojančią ideologiją. Socialinio tinklo valdytojas privalo elgtis taip, kad savo veika nepadarytų kitam asmeniui žalos. Būdamas rūpestingas, jis turi pasirinkti tą veikos alternatyvą, kurios tinkamų atsargumo priemonių našta būtų mažesnė negu žala pagal jos atsiradimo tikimybę. Social {{networks}} {{appeared in the}} public domain in 2005 - 2007. It has been seven years since their public appearance on the Internet; however their popularity is still growing. There are about 150 active social networks worldwide, out of which as much as 13 have over one hundred million users. Among other social networks, Facebook is distinguished for the number of its users, since in the beginning of 2012 it announced that it had more than 900 million users. In the light of such an extent of social networks, {{there is no doubt about}} their importance in the society. At the same time, such massive prevalence of social networks in the society means that the likelihood of various offenses grows with the growing number of users of social networking services. In this case, warnings that the use of social networking sites is dangerous are no longer effective, since they amount to warnings about the dangers of driving a car. Most people know it, but cannot imagine their everyday lives without motor transport. The situation is similar with social networks. During 2009 - 2012, they have become part of everyday lives of many people. Operation of social networks is based on the dissemination of information, i. e. implementation of provisions of freedom of expression, freedom of information and the right to information. However, freedom of expression which includes freedom of information and the right to information is not absolute. In this case, one should recall the phrase of the early twentieth century American Supreme Court Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes: "The right to swing my fist ends where the other man's nose begins". Thus, freedom of information can be equaled to “swinging of a fist”; personal self-expression through freedom of information is possible to the extent it does not violate another persons’s rights. Unfortunately, not all users of social networks follow this rule and the rights of others are often violated. When using a social network, business reputation of others, the right of natural persons to personal data, dignity and honour, person’s image, private life and its secrecy, intellectual property laws may be violated. Such illegal actions as organization of riots, threats of assault, espionage, online bullying and harassment of individuals are distinguished. These forms of illegal behaviour are especially dangerous, because by means of technologies persons are available 24 hours a day. Such accessibility enables the stalkers to attack their victims continually. Unfortunately, due to unique characteristics of the Internet, it is not easy to prove the guilt of the offender, since the person who can be associated with a particular IP address may not necessarily be the actual offender. In the absence of identified offender, the damage is not compensated. Law provides that the damage caused by illegal actions of others must be compensated. Both the Roman law and civil codes of various countries provide that the damage is compensated by the offender in person or by a person who is responsible for the actions of the offender. In the light of these provisions as well as the fact that it is not always possible to identify the actual offenders in the online space, the question arises whether a social network provider is responsible for a damage caused by illegal actions of the users? Therefore, the aim of the article is to determine, whether a social network provider is responsible for a damage caused by illegal actions of the users. Following the analysis of legislative acts and case law, it was concluded that, so far, there are no specialized legislative acts to regulate exclusively the activities of social networks; providers of these services follow the general legislative acts on information society services and electronic commerce. These legislative acts were compiled prior to the emergence of social networks, when the significance and the prevalence of social networks in the society had not been known. As a result, in the implementation of activities of social networks, large data flows that cannot be managed by mere human physical capabilities (this requires special software, automated systems) were not taken into account.  Legislative acts establish a general rule that social network providers are not obligated to monitor the activities taking place in the managed information system, i. e. types of information shared or stored, as well as to take active interest in facts and circumstances indicating unlawful activities. In cases where the social network provider has actual knowledge or becomes aware of unlawful activities, he must take immediate measures to remove the information or disable access to it. Inasmuch as there is no obligation to monitor the activities taking place in the information system managed by social networks, the legislative acts provide that social network provider is not to be held liable, if he has no knowledge of illegal actions of persons using the services. Case law of both USA and European courts indicates that social network providers are not to be held liable. When dealing with the issues of liability of social network providers, the USA courts take into account the circumstances of “knowing” and “not knowing”. If the social network provider has no knowledge of the published content and actions of the user, the liability shall not arise. If it is found that the social network provider was aware, or being careful enough must have been aware, of the actions of the user, including the content of the published information, then the provider is held liable. As a result, information service providers no longer take interest in the information published by the users. However, there have been no disputes so far dealing with cases where illegal actions of social network users caused damage to the society (e. g. organized riots) or illegal actions of social network users lead to the death of other persons. The courts decide the issues of liability of social network providers in accordance with the precedents that have been enacted two decades ago or legislative acts which were compiled over a decade ago. And even though in the legal theory this would be considered a short period of time, bearing in mind that some judicial precedents followed today have been enacted centuries ago, from the point of view of information technologies, several decades is a very long period of time. Phenomena considered exceptional in the 90 s, became part of everyday life in 2012. For this reason, when dealing with the issues of liability of social network providers in cases where illegal actions of social network users pose a threat to fundamental human rights, the courts must take into account the current situation and be guided by the <b>principle</b> <b>of</b> <b>reasonableness,</b> rather than merely by the case law developed in the eighties or legislative acts adopted in 1990 - 2000. It should be noted that legitimacy should not be considered a cause justifying any behaviour or the ideology that shapes it. Social network providers cannot rely solely on those laws which establish certain ways of behaviour. They must behave in a way that their actions (acts or omissions) do not harm other persons. Being careful, the social network provider must choose such mode of activities, the burden of adequate precautions of which would be lesser than the damage caused, according to the probability of its occurrence. It is the obligation of due care that implies the obligation of a social network provider to monitor the activities taking place in the managed information system, as well as obligation to take active interest in facts and circumstances indicating illegal activities, and upon detecting such activities – the obligation to take immediate measures to stop them. Artificial intelligence programs akin to the human mind the operation of which would be based on the appropriate codes of conduct could be useful for this purpose. Having breached the duty of due care, a social network provider is held liable for the damage caused by illegal actions of the network users. The article identifies two grounds for liability to be incurred: (i) a social network provider is to be held liable due to use contractual relationships; (ii) a social network provider is to be held liable due to a tort, considering the social network provider to be the manager of a potentially hazardous object...|$|E

40|$|Reasonableness is {{a common}} topic in the Philosophy for Children (P 4 C) literature. Nevertheless some {{important}} aspects regarding the inter-relationship among reasonableness, emotion and community of inquiry has not been theoretically addressed. Our thesis is that the emergence <b>of</b> <b>reasonableness</b> depends on the way emotions are fostered as crucial for the ethos {{of the community of}} inquiry because they {{play an important role in}} promoting the self-corrective and regulative aspects of thinking. We shows that just as thinking about thinking helps us to modify, correct and refine the activity of thinking for the continual growth <b>of</b> <b>reasonableness</b> in a community, so emotions about emotions help to modify, correct and refine the way we feel for deepening the sense <b>of</b> <b>reasonableness.</b> Thus, in the context of a community of philosophical inquiry, the growth <b>of</b> <b>reasonableness</b> can be acknowledged in self-evaluating moments because it enables participants to pay attention and regulate meta-emotions. This allows the community to foster deeper and more rigorous inquiry (cognition) and to acknowledge it (metacognition), turning thinking, feeling, acting and being like a community into a shared deliberate activity. info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersio...|$|R

We begin by setting out several reasons why we should devote our critical attention to the concept <b>of</b> <b>reasonableness.</b> We then justify our choice of the New York Times editorial page and describe our sample and analytic method. The body of the paper reports three results. First, the primary meanings of the concept are detailed. These include prudence, rationality, fairness, and appropriateness. Second, a distinction between an epistemic and a non-epistemic function of the concept was found in both the qualitative and quantitative analysis of the data. Moreover, {{we found that the}} vast majority of the editorials employ the non-epistemic function [...] a fact that we argue has significant consequences for argumentation theory. Finally, we found that the topoi <b>of</b> <b>reasonableness</b> primarily concern the legitimacy of applications of social and political power. We conclude that to explicate the meanings and functions <b>of</b> <b>reasonableness</b> is to explicate the rhetoric of power in libera...|$|R
