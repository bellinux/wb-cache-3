5|$|In 1993, Langan {{returned}} to London {{to work for}} Andy Harries at Granada's newly created comedy department, where she script-edited September Song, the television adaptation of An Evening with Gary Lineker, and the second series of Rik Mayall Presents. In 1995, she was associate producer on The <b>Perfect</b> <b>Match,</b> a one-off comedy drama written by former BBC radio producer Mike Bullen. The <b>Perfect</b> <b>Match</b> was broadcast in September 1995, and shortly afterwards, Harries asked Langan to develop more ideas from Bullen.|$|E
5|$|During {{the summer}} break, Jack's girlfriend CNBC host Avery Jessup (Elizabeth Banks) {{moved in with}} him. Avery decides to redecorate Jack's apartment. He is not keen on the idea, but not wanting to say no or give into Avery's demands, decides to employ the Fabian strategy—named after Fabius Maximus, a Roman general who {{employed}} a strategy of avoiding battles, instead wearing the enemy down by attrition. Jack is successful in avoiding redecorating the apartment; he agrees to knock down a wall instead. At {{the end of the}} episode, however, he realizes that Avery has emulated the military genius of Hannibal, outmaneuvering his Fabian strategy, and he ecstatically realizes they are a <b>perfect</b> <b>match,</b> far beyond the level of mere soul-mates.|$|E
5|$|In 1995 he {{commissioned}} a comedy drama on spec from Mike Bullen, a BBC radio producer and first-time writer. Like An Evening with Gary Lineker, The <b>Perfect</b> <b>Match</b> was based around football and received respectable reviews. Harries {{was interested in}} producing more comedy dramas, based {{on the success of}} American programmes like Thirtysomething, and assigned Granada producer Christine Langan to work with Bullen. Langan and Bullen developed Cold Feet, which was broadcast in 1997 and was commissioned for a full series in 1998. It won the British Academy Television Award for Best Drama Series in 2002, which Harries collected with Bullen and Spencer Campbell. Harries executive produced two more series of Bullen's; Life Begins (2004–2006) and All About George (2005).|$|E

If there is a <b>perfect</b> <b>matching</b> on the factor graph, then {{obviously}} there is a <b>perfect</b> <b>matching</b> on the graph. Surprisingly, the reversed is also true for amenable groups: if there is a <b>perfect</b> <b>matching</b> on the graph, there is also a <b>perfect</b> <b>matching</b> on the factor graph, i. e. a group invariant ("symmetric") <b>perfect</b> <b>matching</b> on the graph...|$|R
25|$|A <b>perfect</b> <b>{{matching}}</b> (a.k.a. 1-factor) is {{a matching}} which matches all vertices of the graph. That is, every vertex of the graph is incident to exactly one {{edge of the}} matching. Figure (b) above {{is an example of}} a <b>perfect</b> <b>matching.</b> Every <b>perfect</b> <b>matching</b> is maximum and hence maximal. In some literature, the term complete matching is used. In the above figure, only part (b) shows a <b>perfect</b> <b>matching.</b> A <b>perfect</b> <b>matching</b> is also a minimum-size edge cover. Thus, , that is, the size of a maximum matching is no larger than the size of a minimum edge cover.|$|R
40|$|It is {{a longstanding}} open problem whether {{there exists a}} {{polynomial}} size description of the <b>perfect</b> <b>matching</b> polytope. We give a partial {{answer to this question}} by proving the following result. The polyhedron defined by the constraints of the <b>perfect</b> <b>matching</b> polytope which are active at a given <b>perfect</b> <b>matching</b> can be obtained as the projection of a compact polyhedron. Thus there exists a compact linear program which is unbounded if and only if the <b>perfect</b> <b>matching</b> is not optimal with respect to a given edge weight. This result provides a simple reduction of the maximum weight <b>perfect</b> <b>matching</b> problem to compact linear programming...|$|R

Each eye is hand-painted to achieve a <b>perfect</b> <b>match</b> of the original. Real human hair is then inserted painstakingly strand by strand.|$|E
5|$|Prior to 1981, the {{gender-neutral}} {{category of}} Best Jazz Vocal Performance existed. The first award specifically for female performances {{was presented to}} Ella Fitzgerald in 1981 for the album A <b>Perfect</b> <b>Match.</b> The category remained unchanged until 1985, when it was combined with the award for Best Jazz Vocal Performance, Male and presented in the genderless category. Gender-specific awards were once again presented from 1986 until 1991. In 1992, the two categories were combined and presented as the category Best Jazz Vocal Performance. This category was later renamed to Best Jazz Vocal Album beginning in 2001. While the gender-specific award has not been presented since the category merge in 1992, an official confirmation of its retirement has not been announced.|$|E
5|$|Cold Feet {{began its}} first {{series with the}} six main cast members—James Nesbitt, Helen Baxendale, John Thomson, Fay Ripley, Hermione Norris and Robert Bathurst—who had {{appeared}} in the pilot. Thomson's character Pete Gifford was written specifically for him after his performance in The <b>Perfect</b> <b>Match</b> made a positive impression on Christine Langan. Norris originally auditioned for the part of Rachel but was cast as Karen because the role suited her social class. Nesbitt got an audition through a mutual friend of pilot director Declan Lowney, and read the part in his natural accent because he was keen to play a Northern Irish character in a contemporary drama unconnected to The Troubles. Baxendale was best known for her role in Cardiac Arrest and was hesitant to star as Rachel because she did not believe she could perform comedy. Bathurst was known to Langan for his starring role in Joking Apart. Ripley thought she would be auditioning for the part of Rachel, and had to put on an accent for her role as natural Mancunian Jenny. When the fourth series was commissioned, Ripley announced that she was leaving the show to broaden her career options. Kimberley Joseph was cast as Jo Ellison, a replacement character who remained on screen until Cold Feets conclusion. Bullen makes numerous Hitchcock-esque cameo appearances; he plays a neighbour and a husband in the first series and a workman in the third.|$|E

This unique <b>perfect</b> <b>matching</b> question has been answered positively by Kozen, Vazirani, and Vazirani for bipartite graphs. In this note, we give tighter bounds on the complexity of the unique <b>perfect</b> <b>matching</b> problem. We show that the problem for bipartite graphs is in C=L and in NL ⊕L, a subclass of NC 2. By a counterexample we show that the solution for the bipartite graphs can not be applied for non-bipartite graphs. We also consider the weighted version of the problem. We show that the unique minimum-weight <b>perfect</b> <b>matching</b> problem for bipartite graphs is in LC=L and in NL⊕L. Furthermore, we show that the unique <b>perfect</b> <b>matching</b> problem is hard for NL, even when restricted to bipartite graphs. ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. For planar graphs, {{counting}} {{the number of}} perfect matchings (and hence determining whether there exists a <b>perfect</b> <b>matching)</b> can be done in NC [4, 10]. For planar bipartite graphs, finding a <b>perfect</b> <b>matching</b> when one exists can also be done in NC [8, 7]. However in general planar graphs (when the bipartite condition is removed), no NC algorithm for constructing a <b>perfect</b> <b>matching</b> is known. We address a relaxation of this problem. We consider the fractional matching polytope P(G) of a planar graph G. Each vertex of this polytope is either a <b>perfect</b> <b>matching,</b> or a half-integral solution: an assignment of weights from the set { 0, 1 / 2, 1 } to each edge of G so that the weights of edges incident on each vertex of G add up to 1 [6]. We show that a vertex of this polytope can be found in NC, provided G has at least one <b>perfect</b> <b>matching</b> to begin with. If, furthermore, the graph is bipartite, then all vertices are integral, and thus our procedure actually finds a <b>perfect</b> <b>matching</b> without explicitly exploiting the bipartiteness of G. ...|$|R
25|$|One of the {{original}} goals of tone mapping was {{to be able to}} reproduce a given scene or image onto a display device such that the brightness sensation of the image to a human viewer closely matches the real-world brightness sensation. However, a <b>perfect</b> <b>match</b> for this problem is never possible and thus the output image on a display is often built from a tradeoff between different image features. Choosing between features is often based on the necessary application, and given appropriate metrics for the application, one possible solution is to treat the issue as an optimization problem.|$|E
