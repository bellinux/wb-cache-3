Financial sponsors usually react to this again by offering to compensate the management team for a lost deal fee if the <b>purchase</b> <b>price</b> is low. Another mechanisms to handle this problem are earn-outs (<b>purchase</b> <b>price</b> being contingent on reaching certain future profitabilities).|$|R

40|$|Using unique brand-level {{wholesale}} price data, {{this article examines}} how <b>purchase</b> <b>prices</b> of commodities for retailers are influenced by wholesale concentration. Compared with studies focusing on retail prices, little empirical work has measured the impact of wholesale concentration on {{wholesale price}}s. Economic theory suggests that the sensitivity of <b>purchase</b> <b>price</b> in response to degree of wholesale concentration is smaller for large retail formats than for small retail formats {{in the presence of}} intra-format retail competition. To test the validity of the theoretical implication, I measure the impact of the concentration on <b>purchasing</b> <b>prices</b> for retailers by format. Empirical findings support the hypothesis that the large retail format tends to draw advantageous <b>purchase</b> <b>prices</b> when wholesalers become increasingly oligopolistic. ...|$|R
40|$|I {{examine the}} {{negotiation}} of accounting rules in the <b>purchase</b> <b>price</b> adjustment clause of corporate acquisition agreements. <b>Purchase</b> <b>price</b> adjustments make the deal value contingent on the target's closing working capital or net worth. Some <b>purchase</b> <b>price</b> adjustments use "rigid" accounting and specify which measurement rules {{will be used to}} prepare the closing-date balance sheet. Many more use "flexible" accounting and require only GAAP compliance. I provide evidence that hidden action and adverse selection problems determine whether the buyer and seller use rigid or flexible accounting. I also provide evidence that this choice is associated with other features of the contract related to <b>purchase</b> <b>price</b> adjustment flexibility and to the prospect of hold-up. Estimates of the effect of rigid accounting on finalized <b>purchase</b> <b>price</b> adjustments are consistent with implications of the adverse selection and hold-up problems. by Derek Christopher Johnson.

50|$|When a JTWROS {{property}} is partitioned, the proceeds must be divided equally among tenants {{without regard to}} contribution to <b>purchase</b> <b>price</b> since a JTWROS deed is always taken in equal shares.

In drought areas of the country, however, crop yields substantially diverge from the average yield over several years depending on conditions. In this situation unalterable <b>purchase</b> <b>prices</b> would make it possible for collective farms to get unjustifiably high incomes in high-yield years, which would lessen the stimulating effect of prices on raising labor productivity and lowering production costs.
