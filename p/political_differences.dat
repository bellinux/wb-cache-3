5|$|Based on Henry VIII's {{desire for}} an {{annulment}} {{of his marriage}} (first requested of Pope Clement VII in 1527), the English Reformation was at the outset more of a political affair than a theological dispute. The reality of <b>political</b> <b>differences</b> between Rome and England allowed growing theological disputes {{to come to the}} fore.|$|E
5|$|Major <b>political</b> <b>differences</b> between Democrats and Republicans and wartime {{propaganda}} {{caused many}} Hoosiers to become suspicious of dissenters and fearful of potential insurrections, especially from secret societies {{sympathetic to the}} South. During the Indianapolis city election In May, the Democrats, who decided a fair election could not be held, withdrew their ticket. Only 14 votes were cast for Democratic candidates in the nine Indianapolis wards.|$|E
5|$|Breckinridge {{received}} 1,481 {{votes in}} the election, over 400 more than his nearest competitor, making {{it the first time}} that Fayette County had elected a Democrat to the state House of Representatives. Between the election and the legislative session, Breckinridge formed a new law partnership with Owsley's former Secretary of State, George B. Kinkead; his previous partner having died in a cholera epidemic earlier in the year. He also co-founded the Kentucky Statesman, a semi-weekly Democratic newspaper, and visited his cousin, Mary Todd, where he met her husband, Abraham Lincoln, for the first time; despite their <b>political</b> <b>differences,</b> they became friends.|$|E

50|$|From {{the late}} Middle Ages until the Renaissance, {{northern}} Italy was divided between factions supporting the rival political {{claims of the}} Holy Roman Emperor ("Ghibellines") and the Pope ("Guelfs"). Modena was Ghibelline; Bologna was Guelph. This <b>political</b> <b>difference</b> exacerbated the natural conflicts over border territories.|$|R
50|$|The {{inauguration of}} Singh as the 1st vice Jathedar of Akal Takht {{took place in}} December 19, 1937. He served {{alongside}} Mohan Singh Nagoke up to 1948 and later served as the Jathedar of Akal Takht from 1952 to February 15, 1955. He resign due to <b>political</b> <b>difference</b> with Master Tara Singh.|$|R
5|$|During her reign, Anne favoured {{moderate}} Tory politicians, {{who were}} more likely to share her Anglican religious views than their opponents, the Whigs. The Whigs grew more powerful {{during the course of the}} War of the Spanish Succession, until 1710 when Anne dismissed many of them from office. Her close friendship with Sarah Churchill, Duchess of Marlborough, turned sour as the result of <b>political</b> <b>differences.</b> The Duchess took revenge in an unflattering description of the Queen in her memoirs, which was widely accepted by historians until Anne was re-assessed in the late 20th-century.|$|E
5|$|Lame duck {{president}} John Quincy Adams nominated Crittenden to the U.S. Supreme Court on December 17, 1828 but Senators {{who supported}} president-elect Jackson voted to postpone confirmation until Jackson could nominate his own man. After his brief service as Kentucky Secretary of State, {{the state legislature}} elected Crittenden to the second of his four non-consecutive stints in the U.S. Senate. Upon his election as president, William Henry Harrison appointed Crittenden as Attorney General, but 5 months after Harrison's death, <b>political</b> <b>differences</b> prompted him to resign rather than continue his service under Harrison's successor, John Tyler.|$|E
5|$|President Hoover was {{defeated}} in the 1932 election by Franklin D. Roosevelt. MacArthur and Roosevelt had worked together before World War I and, despite <b>political</b> <b>differences,</b> remained friends. MacArthur supported the New Deal through the Army's operation of the Civilian Conservation Corps. He ensured that detailed plans were drawn up for its employment and decentralized its administration to the corps areas, which became {{an important factor in}} the program's success. MacArthur's support for a strong military, and his public criticism of pacifism and isolationism, made him unpopular with the Roosevelt administration.|$|E
40|$|The {{expansion}} of global {{trade in the}} post-war period is subject to various interpre-tations. Some stress the trade-promoting role of the novel features in the world economy; some insist {{on the role of}} traditional factors, such as geographic distance, <b>political</b> <b>difference</b> and cultural dissimilarity, in continuously depressing trade flows; others even argue that the importance of these traditional factors has been on the rise. To adjudicate the divergence, this article applies the gravity model to a large data set on global bilateral trade from 1950 through 2000. Although the global institutional factor does promote bilateral trade and global economic activity indeed becomes more trade-generating, the trade-depressing effects of geographic distance, <b>political</b> <b>difference</b> and cultural dissimilarity remain strong. Moreover, geographic and cultural proximity actually generates greater gravity over time that draws countries together, which may trigger fragmentation in global trade along geo-cultural lines...|$|R
50|$|There {{was little}} <b>political</b> <b>difference</b> between Turnbull and Smith, as both were {{independent}} Liberals with fairly similar views. Their only real point of {{difference was that}} Smith was a prohibitionist (although much more moderate than Tommy Taylor), whilst Turnbull was in favour of temperance. Charles Taylor, on the other hand, was a staunch advocate for labour interests.|$|R
5000|$|Hales and Chillingworth {{have been}} {{identified}} with an [...] "Oxford School of rational theology", containing also Christopher Potter and William Page. It has been said that, despite the <b>political</b> <b>difference</b> over the defence of episcopacy, {{there is no clear}} distinction between the Great Tew line and Laudianism in theology. Falkland, Hyde and Sir John Colepepper were leaders of the [...] "Country Alliance" [...] of 1640.|$|R
5|$|South Dakota can {{generally}} {{be divided into}} three regions: eastern South Dakota, western South Dakota, and the Black Hills. The Missouri River serves as a boundary in terms of geographic, social, and <b>political</b> <b>differences</b> between eastern and western South Dakota. The geography of the Black Hills, long considered sacred by Native Americans, differs from its surroundings {{to such an extent}} it can be considered separate from the rest of western South Dakota. At times the Black Hills are combined with the rest of western South Dakota, and people often refer to the resulting two regions divided by the Missouri River as West River and East River.|$|E
5|$|The Duke of Wellington was {{becoming}} unpopular as Prime Minister, {{particularly in the}} industrial north west of England, for continually blocking proposed reforms. Huskisson saw himself as well placed to unite the two wings of the Tory party should the Duke retire, or to lead the reforming faction of the party into a split from the Tories and a progressive alliance with the Whigs. He also saw himself as a natural ally for the Duke, despite their <b>political</b> <b>differences,</b> as a Tory popular in Liverpool and Manchester, {{both of which were}} traditionally hostile to the party. Newspapers were already beginning to report rumours that Huskisson and his supporters were to be invited back into the government.|$|E
5|$|There were {{tensions}} between Bute {{and the new}} industrialists around the region, including ironmasters such as John Guest, {{the master of the}} Dowlais Ironworks. Bute was a financial competitor or landlord with many of these men, and keen to drive as good a deal as possible in his negotiations with them. He also had <b>political</b> <b>differences,</b> seeing himself as a benevolent feudal lord in South Wales, and perceiving the local iron-masters as arrogant, power-hungry individuals, abusing their economic power towards communities and workers.|$|E
25|$|Squire married Susan Fey, a Labour Party activist, in 1981. Questioned {{about the}} marriage, Fey stated {{that she was}} on {{the right wing of the}} Labour Party and her husband was on the left of the Conservative Party.

The couple had two children (one son and one daughter) by Fey's previous marriage and divorced in 2007.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{examines}} disability {{arts and}} its role in identifying exclusion and barriers to participation within society. The work of selected writers, poets and musicians is presented and its value as a form of ideological critique is explored.

5|$|After serving her sentence, she was {{deported}} to Canada, something which left her feeling bitter. There, Max Hyatt, the gothi of the Asatru Alliance-affiliated group Wodan's Kindred, {{invited her to}} live {{at his home in}} Vancouver Island, British Columbia. However, after personal and <b>political</b> <b>differences</b> surfaced, Christensen left Hyatt's home and moved into an RV park in Parksville, Vancouver Island, where she lived in a small trailer. Despite being far less involved in Odinic activities than she had been previously, she set about trying to revive the Odinist Fellowship. In 1998 she began publication of Midgard Page, which was produced in both paper and electronic copies, the latter of which was housed on Hyatt's Wodansdaeg Press website. During her later years, she became more moderate in her views, encouraging a cultural change among Aryans rather than political actions. This contrasted with the more radical views of newer groups like Wotansvolk, who embraced militant action to bring about socio-political change. She died on May 4, 2005.|$|E
5|$|Christianity {{was a major}} unifying factor between Eastern and Western Europe {{before the}} Arab conquests, but the conquest of North Africa sundered {{maritime}} connections between those areas. Increasingly the Byzantine Church differed in language, practices, and liturgy from the Western Church. The Eastern Church used Greek instead of the Western Latin. Theological and <b>political</b> <b>differences</b> emerged, and by the early and middle 8th century issues such as iconoclasm, clerical marriage, and state control of the Church had widened {{to the extent that}} the cultural and religious differences were greater than the similarities. The formal break, known as the East–West Schism, came in 1054, when the papacy and the patriarchy of Constantinople clashed over papal supremacy and excommunicated each other, which led to the division of Christianity into two Churches—the Western branch became the Roman Catholic Church and the Eastern branch the Eastern Orthodox Church.|$|E
5|$|Due to <b>political</b> <b>differences</b> among {{factions in}} the Polish exile government, and in particular, SZP {{ties to the}} Sanacja regime which {{dominated}} the Polish government since mid-1920s, the SZP was reorganized into the Union of Armed Struggle (Związek Walki Zbrojnej, ZWZ) on 13 November 1939. Karaszewicz-Tokarzewski supported that move, aiming to include parties marginalized by the Sanacja regime, and supported {{the formation of the}} Main Political Council (Główna Rada Polityczna, GRP). Sikorski named General Kazimierz Sosnkowski the head of the ZWZ and Colonel Stefan Rowecki was appointed the commander of the ZWZ German occupation zone. Karaszewicz-Tokarzewski became the commander of the ZWZ Soviet zone, but was arrested in March 1940 by the Soviets when attempting to cross the new German-Soviet border. In June Sikorski appointed Rowecki as the commander of both zones.|$|E
50|$|Witbooi moved {{north on}} 16 May 1884, with a {{faction of the}} ǀKhowesin tribe. This was against the wishes of his father, Moses, who {{remained}} opposed to Hendrik's plans. As evidenced from his diaries (which contain {{a large portion of}} the surviving documents of Witbooi) he still admired his father greatly, in spite of their <b>political</b> <b>difference.</b> On 22 February 1887, Moses' chief rival, his subchief Paul Visser, had Moses killed and deposed.|$|R
50|$|The {{initiative}} soon {{spread to}} various other locations in Israel, with women standing weekly in main squares of cities or at junctions on inter-city highways. As was decided early on, the movement did not adopt any formal program other than {{opposition to the}} occupation. Local groups were autonomous in deciding such issues as {{whether or not to}} open participation to men as well as women, and there were many shades of <b>political</b> <b>difference</b> from one place to another.|$|R

This wholesale 'borrowing', 'quotation' and 'citation' raises the questions addressed in this article. What {{does it mean to}} engage in acts of appropriation now? And, more importantly, can such acts of appropriation draw on the spirit of the 'original' work to make a (<b>political)</b> <b>difference...</b>|$|R
5|$|In Paducah, Barkley {{worked as}} a law clerk for Charles K. Wheeler, an {{attorney}} and congressman for the district, accepting access to Wheeler's law library as payment for his services. Despite their <b>political</b> <b>differences</b> – Wheeler supported William Jennings Bryan and Free Silver, while Barkley identified with the Gold Democrats – he hoped that being acquainted with and taught by Wheeler would aid him in his future endeavors, but congressional duties frequently kept Wheeler away from the office. After two months, Barkley accepted an offer to clerk for Judge William Sutton Bishop and former congressman John Kerr Hendrick, who paid him $15 per month. He read law while completing his duties and {{was admitted to the}} bar in 1901. Barkley practiced in Paducah where a friend of Hendrick's appointed him reporter of the circuit court. He continued studying law in the summer of 1902 at the University of Virginia School of Law.|$|E
5|$|In Southeast Asia the {{continental}} area (Myanmar, Thailand, Laos, Cambodia and Vietnam) generally practices Theravada Buddhism. Most of insular Southeast Asia (namely Malaysia, Brunei and Indonesia) practices mostly Sunni Islam. The {{rest of the}} insular region (Philippines and East Timor) practices mostly Roman Catholic Christianity and Singapore practises mostly Mahayana Buddhism. Significant long-distance labor migration {{that occurred during the}} late 19th into the early 20th century provided many different types of ethnic diversity. Relations between the indigenous population of the region arose from regional variations of cultural and linguistic group. During this time immigrant minorities, especially the Chinese, developed as well. Although there were extreme <b>political</b> <b>differences</b> for each minority and religion, they were still legitimate members of political communities {{and there has been a}} significant amount of unity throughout history. This differs from both nearby East and South Asia.|$|E
5|$|In the 2001 {{parliamentary}} election the party lost the gains {{it had made}} according to opinion polling but maintained its position from the 1997 election, it got 14.6% and 26 members in the parliament. The election result allowed them to unseat the Labour Party government of Jens Stoltenberg {{and replace it with}} a three-party coalition led by Christian Democrat Kjell Magne Bondevik. However, the coalition continued to decline to govern together with the Progress Party as they considered the <b>political</b> <b>differences</b> too large. The Progress Party eventually decided to tolerate the coalition, as it promised to invest more in defence, open more private hospitals and open for more competition in the public sector. In 2002 the Progress Party again advanced in the opinion polls and for a while became the largest party.|$|E
40|$|The electoral {{success of}} the post-communist PDS has {{surprised}} politicians and academics alike. The PDS {{has been able to}} find a niche for itself within the German polity by articulating territorially salient <b>political</b> <b>difference.</b> The PDS has expanded its voter base beyond merely the politically disaffected and the former 'Dienstklasse' of the GDR, as it has developed into an effective articulator of eastern German interests. Western German parties have been unable to incorporate differences in eastern German attitudes and perceptions into their political platforms ¿ leaving space for a regionally concentrated political party (the PDS) to establish itself...|$|R
40|$|We examine {{two recent}} cases of {{relative}} Left success—the Battle of Seattle and Occupy Wall Street—and {{argue that in}} each case an effective dynamism between radical and reform wings drove gains. This analysis {{is not meant to}} deny <b>political</b> <b>difference</b> and hawk false unity. Instead we want to challenge the luxury of mutual dismissal with the actually existing benefits of movement dynamism. By dynamism we mean contributions arising from different activist wings and productively interacting to increase overall movement power. Our ultimate claim is that the North American Left will yield greater success by becoming more self-conscious about the concrete benefits of movement dynamism...|$|R
50|$|When {{the future}} MP Tom Watson and Rebecca Gray started their degrees at Hull in 1991, HULC was {{regarded}} as an insular irrelevance on campus and had experienced a bitter dispute over its nomination for the candidate of HUU president in the previous year. Within just a year, however, Watson and Gray, amongst others, turned HULC into a more significant, professional organisation attracting, at its height,some 230-250 members to its fold, a number perhaps surpassing any other Labour Club of any similarly-sized university at its time. Much like the old SocSoc, HULC built links with the community and increased its membership through a general tolerance of <b>political</b> <b>difference.</b>|$|R
5|$|Kennedy {{staged a}} tiring, dangerous, and {{high-profile}} trip to South Africa in January 1985. He defied both the apartheid government's wishes and militant leftist AZAPO demonstrators by spending {{a night in}} the Soweto home of Bishop Desmond Tutu and also visited Winnie Mandela, wife of imprisoned black leader Nelson Mandela. Upon returning, Kennedy became {{a leader in the}} push for economic sanctions against South Africa; collaborating with Senator Lowell Weicker, he secured Senate passage, and the overriding of Reagan's veto, of the Comprehensive Anti-Apartheid Act of 1986. Despite their many <b>political</b> <b>differences,</b> Kennedy and Reagan had a good personal relationship, and with the administration's approval Kennedy traveled to the Soviet Union in 1986 to act as a go-between in arms control negotiations with reformist Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev. The discussions were productive, and Kennedy also helped gain the release of a number of Soviet Jewish refuseniks, including Anatoly Shcharansky.|$|E
5|$|Crittenden began {{a college}} preparatory {{curriculum}} at Pisgah Academy in Woodford County. He was {{then sent to}} a boarding school in Jessamine County. Among his classmates were Thomas Alexander Marshall and Francis P. Blair. Crittenden became especially close friends with Blair, and later <b>political</b> <b>differences</b> did little to diminish their friendship. After a year at boarding school, Crittenden moved to the Lexington, Kentucky, home of Judge George M. Bibb to study law. He began his tertiary studies at Washington College (now Washington and Lee University) in Lexington, Virginia. During his brief tenure there, he studied mathematics and belles-lettres and became friends with Hugh Lawson White. Crittenden was dissatisfied with the curriculum at Washington College and matriculated to the College of William and Mary. He studied under St. George Tucker and became acquainted with John Tyler. Crittenden completed his studies in 1806, and {{was admitted to the}} bar the following year. He began his practice in Woodford County, but as central Kentucky was well already supplied with able lawyers, he moved to Logan County, Kentucky, on the then western frontier and opened his practice in Russellville. At age twenty-two, he was appointed by Governor Ninian Edwards of Illinois Territory as its attorney general. The following year, Edwards also made Crittenden his aide-de-camp.|$|E
5|$|In August 1996, Khmer Rouge leaders Pol Pot and Ieng Sary {{publicly}} split, {{with the}} former denouncing the latter in a radio broadcast. Ieng Sary responded by disassociating himself from the Khmer Rouge {{and went on to}} form his own political party, the Democratic National Union Movement. Pol Pot's announcement prompted Ranariddh and Hun Sen to briefly set their <b>political</b> <b>differences</b> aside to jointly seek a royal pardon for Ieng Sary, who had been sentenced to death by the People's Republic of Kampuchea (PRK) government in 1979. Subsequently, in October and December 1996, both Ranariddh and Hun Sen competed to win Ieng Sary's favour by separately visiting the leader at his fiefdom in Pailin. Hun Sen gained the upper hand, when he announced {{at the end of his}} visit that he had managed to convince Khmer Rouge soldiers under Ieng Sary's charge to join the CPP. When Ranariddh announced plans for a follow-up to visit Samlout, another town located within Ieng Sary's fiefdom, his soldiers threatened to shoot down Ranariddh's helicopter if he went there, prompting Ranariddh to cancel his visit.|$|E

[...] "I {{was supposed to be a}} Labour politician, and Graeme was supposed to be a Tory, but we didn't have to stay completely in character if we wanted to sort of shamelessly do gags," [...] recounts Hardy, who affected the far more absurdly right-wing of the two characters, an extremely wealthy aristocrat disdainful toward the voters and infrequently heard to advocate a coup.|$|R

40|$|Moral {{dilemmas}} pitting {{concerns about}} actions against concerns about consequences {{have been used}} by philosophers and psychologists to gauge “universal ” moral intuitions. Although these dilemmas contain no overt political content, we demonstrate that liberals are more likely than conservatives to be concerned about consequences, whereas conservatives are more likely than liberals to be concerned about actions. This effect is shown in two large, heterogeneous samples and across several different moral dilemmas. In addition, manipulations of dilemma aversiveness and order of presentation suggest that this <b>political</b> <b>difference</b> {{is due in part to}} different sensitivities to emotional reactions in moral decision-making: Conservatives are more likely to “go with the gut ” and let affective responses guide moral judgments, while liberals are more likely to deliberate about optimal consequences...|$|R
