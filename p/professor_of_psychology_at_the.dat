25|$|Devi {{travelled}} {{the world}} demonstrating her arithmetic talents, including {{a tour of}} Europe in 1950 and a performance in New York City in 1976. In 1988, she travelled to the US to have her abilities studied by Arthur Jensen, a <b>professor</b> <b>of</b> <b>psychology</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> University of California, Berkeley. Jensen tested her performance of several tasks, including the calculation of large numbers. Examples of the problems presented to Devi included calculating the cube root of 61,629,875 and the seventh root of 170,859,375. Jensen reported that Devi provided {{the solution to the}} above mentioned problems (395 and 15, respectively) before Jensen could copy them down in his notebook. Jensen published his findings in the academic journal Intelligence in 1990.|$|E
25|$|Morton Ann Gernsbacher, a <b>professor</b> <b>of</b> <b>psychology</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> University of Wisconsin–Madison, {{compares the}} {{orientation}} of toilet paper to {{the orientation of}} cutlery in a dishwasher, the choice of which drawer in a chest of drawers to place one's socks, and the order of shampooing one's hair and lathering one's body in the shower. In each choice, there is a prototypical solution chosen by the majority, and {{it is tempting to}} offer simplistic explanations of how the minority must be different. She warns that neuroimaging experiments—which as of 2007 were beginning to probe behaviors from mental rotation and facial expressions to grocery shopping and tickling—must strive to avoid such cultural bias and stereotypes.|$|E

All the while, Fromm maintained his own clinical practice and published a series of books.|$|E
25|$|Eysenck was <b>Professor</b> <b>of</b> <b>Psychology</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> Institute of Psychiatry, King's College London, from 1955 to 1983. He {{was a major}} {{contributor}} to the modern scientific theory of personality and a brilliant teacher who helped found treatment for mental illnesses. Eysenck also created and developed a distinctive dimensional model of personality structure based on empirical factor-analytic research, attempting to anchor these factors in biogenetic variation. In 1981, Eysenck became {{a founding member of the}} World Cultural Council. He was the founding editor of the international journal Personality and Individual Differences, and wrote about 80 books and more than 1600 journal articles. His son Michael Eysenck is also a noted psychology professor. Hans Eysenck died of a brain tumour in a London hospice in 1997. He was an atheist.|$|E
500|$|In 2004 Josephson criticized an {{experiment}} by the Committee for Skeptical Inquiry to test claims by Russian schoolgirl Natasha Demkina {{that she could}} see inside people's bodies using a special kind of vision. The experiment involved her being asked to match six people to their confirmed medical conditions (plus one with none); to pass the test she had to make five correct matches, but made only four. Josephson argued that this was statistically significant, and that the experiment had set her up to fail. One of the researchers, Richard Wiseman, <b>professor</b> <b>of</b> <b>psychology</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> University of Hertfordshire, responded that Josephson had no record of publishing on parapsychology. Keith Rennolis, professor of applied statistics at the University of Greenwich, supported Josephson's position, asserting that the experiment was [...] "woefully inadequate" [...] to determine any effect.|$|E

500|$|In the Cedillo case, {{her family}} claimed that Michelle was normal until {{receiving}} her vaccines, {{as evidenced by}} a number of videos of her between the age of 6 and 8 months. They also argued that thimerosal-containing vaccines degraded her immune system, which made it possible for the measles virus to infect her and cause autism and the other health problems from which she suffers, which include inflammatory bowel disease, glaucoma and epilepsy. The evidence presented for this consisted primarily of the detection of measles virus in Michelle Cedillo's GI tract. According to the testimony of Marcel Kinsbourne, a pediatric neurologist and <b>professor</b> <b>of</b> <b>psychology</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> New School, the vaccine strain of measles virus caused autism by [...] "...infect the gut and enter the brain, causing dysfunction of astrocytes and other brain cells, which in turn provokes high levels of the neurotransmitter glutamate, causing a state of overstimulation which manifests itself in the symptoms of autism." ...|$|E
500|$|In late 2009, Docter {{noticed his}} pre-teen daughter, Elie, exhibiting similar shyness. [...] "She started getting more quiet and reserved, and that, frankly, {{triggered}} {{a lot of}} my own insecurities and fears," [...] he said. He imagined what happens in the human mind when emotions set in. The idea to depict it through animation excited Docter, who felt it the ideal form to portray [...] "strong, opinionated, caricatured personalities." [...] He began researching information about the mind, alongside Jonas Rivera, a producer, and Ronnie del Carmen, a secondary director. They consulted Paul Ekman, a well-known psychologist who studies emotions, and Dacher Keltner, a <b>professor</b> <b>of</b> <b>psychology</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> University of California, Berkeley. Ekman had early in his career identified six core emotions—anger, fear, sadness, disgust, joy, and surprise. Docter found surprise and fear to be too similar, which left him with five emotions to build characters around. Other emotions considered for inclusion during the development process were schadenfreude, ennui, pride, and hope. Keltner focused on sadness being an emotion that strengthens relationships. Both emphasized how emotions organize social lives and the structuring of interpersonal interactions.|$|E

She died in 1979. In 1984, Davidson married for the third and last time, to philosopher Marcia Cavell. [...] Thomas Nagel elliptically eulogized him as [...] "deeply erotic".|$|E
2500|$|Christopher Peterson, a <b>professor</b> <b>of</b> <b>psychology</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> University of Michigan, classifies {{the choice}} of toilet paper {{orientation}} under [...] "tastes, preferences, and interests" [...] as opposed to either values or [...] "attitudes, traits, norms, and needs". Other personal interests include one's favorite cola or baseball team. Interests {{are an important part}} of identity; one expects and prefers that different people have different interests, which serves one's [...] "sense of uniqueness". Differences in interests usually lead at most to teasing and gentle chiding. For most people, interests don't cause the serious divisions caused by conflicts of values; a possible exception is what Peterson calls [...] "the 'get a life' folks among us" [...] who elevate interests into moral issues.|$|E

2500|$|Jens Förster (social psychology) – Fabricated data. Förster is a German social {{psychologist}} who held a chair as <b>professor</b> <b>of</b> <b>psychology</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> University of Amsterdam from 2007 to May 2014. An anonymous whistleblower alerted {{the university in}} 2012 to a strong regularity in data from studies published by Förster that was extremely unlikely for data obtained in the field. After examination of the evidence, an integrity committee at the university concluded that the patterns in the published data were [...] "practically impossible". One of the studies was retracted in November 2014, after Förster had already left for a prestigious appointment as Alexander von Humboldt Professor at Ruhr University Bochum in Germany. In April 2015, Ruhr University announced that Förster had withdrawn his candidacy for the professorship. A subsequent report by an investigative panel commissioned by the University of Amsterdam published in June 2015 found [...] "strong evidence for low veracity" [...] in eight further studies authored by Förster.|$|E
2500|$|In 1945, he {{was invited}} to set up a {{counseling}} center at the University of Chicago. In 1947 he was elected President of the American Psychological Association. While a <b>professor</b> <b>of</b> <b>psychology</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> University of Chicago (1945–57), Rogers helped to establish a counseling center connected with the university and there conducted studies to determine the effectiveness of his methods. His findings and theories appeared in Client-Centered Therapy (1951) and Psychotherapy and Personality Change (1954). One of his graduate students at the University of Chicago, Thomas Gordon, established the Parent Effectiveness Training (P.E.T.) movement. [...] Another student, Eugene T. Gendlin, who was getting his Ph.D. in philosophy, developed the practice of Focusing based on Rogerian listening. [...] In 1956, Rogers became the first President of the American Academy of Psychotherapists. He taught psychology at the University of Wisconsin, Madison (1957–63), during which time he wrote one of his best-known books, On Becoming a Person (1961). Carl Rogers and Abraham Maslow (1908–70) pioneered a movement called humanistic psychology which reached its peak in the 1960s. In 1961, he was elected a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences. Carl Rogers {{was also one of the}} people who questioned the rise of McCarthyism in 1950s.
