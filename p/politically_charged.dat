5|$|Since then, interpretations in {{successive}} eras {{have reflected}} the sensibilities of the time. Goya {{was seen as}} a proto-Romantic in the early 19th century, and the series' graphically rendered dismembered carcasses were a direct influence on Théodore Géricault, best known for the <b>politically</b> <b>charged</b> Raft of the Medusa (1818–19). Luis Buñuel identified with Goya's sense of the absurd, and referenced his works in such films as the 1930 L'Âge d'Or, on which he collaborated with Salvador Dalí, and his 1962 The Exterminating Angel.|$|E

Flocabulary has been praised by rapper Snoop Dogg, United Nations Secretary General Ban Ki-moon, and historian Howard Zinn, and the company's products have been generally well received by educators and the press. However, the project {{has been criticized for}} perceived cultural inauthenticity and <b>politically</b> <b>charged</b> material in some song lyrics.|$|E

5|$|Humans {{have lived}} for {{thousands}} of years in or around the Everglades. Plans arose in 1882 to drain the wetlands and develop the land for agricultural and residential use. As the 20th century progressed, water flow from Lake Okeechobee was increasingly controlled and diverted to enable explosive growth of the South Florida metropolitan area. The park was established in 1934, to protect the quickly vanishing Everglades, and dedicated in 1947, as major canal building projects were initiated across South Florida. The ecosystems in Everglades National Park have suffered significantly from human activity, and restoration of the Everglades is a <b>politically</b> <b>charged</b> issue in South Florida.|$|E
5|$|Initially, {{coverage}} of the assault in Bernas was slow. The murder had occurred {{too late in the}} evening to be covered in the 14 August edition, and head editor Kusfandhi– due to press censorship– was uncomfortable with covering a <b>politically</b> <b>charged</b> case. However, other staff members convinced him to give greater coverage, and {{the front page of the}} 15 August edition showed Udin covered in bandages and gave detailed information about the case. On 16 August, Udin died without having regained consciousness; on the morning of his death, a breathing tube had been inserted.|$|E

5|$|After her release, Sarumpaet {{continued}} {{to participate in}} pro-democracy movements; these actions led to her fleeing Indonesia after hearing rumours {{that she would be}} arrested for dissent. When she returned to Indonesia, Sarumpaet {{continued to}} write <b>politically</b> <b>charged</b> stageplays. She became head of the Jakarta Art Board in 2003; two years later she was approached by UNICEF and asked to write a drama to raise awareness of child trafficking in Southeast Asia. The resulting work served as the foundation for her 2009 feature film debut, Jamila dan Sang Presiden (Jamila and the President). This film was submitted to the 82nd Academy Awards for Best Foreign Language Film but not nominated. The following year, she released her first novel, Maluku, Kobaran Cintaku (Maluku, Flame of My Love).|$|E
5|$|On {{the night}} of 27–28 February 1917, Michael {{attempted}} to return to Gatchina from Petrograd, {{where he had been}} in conference with Rodzianko and from where he had telegraphed the Tsar, but revolutionary patrols and sporadic fire prevented his progress. Revolutionaries patrolled the streets, rounding up people connected with the old regime. Michael managed to reach the Winter Palace, where he ordered the guards to withdraw to the Admiralty, because it afforded greater safety and a better tactical position, and because it was a less <b>politically</b> <b>charged</b> location. Michael himself took refuge in the apartment of an acquaintance, Princess Putyatina, on Millionnaya street. In the neighbouring apartments, the Tsar's Chamberlain Nikolai Stolypin and the Procurator of the Holy Synod were detained by revolutionaries and in the house next door General Baron Staekelberg was killed when his house was stormed by a mob.|$|E
5|$|The most <b>politically</b> <b>charged</b> {{issue in}} Kentucky during Breckinridge's campaign, however, was the Old Court-New Court controversy. The Panic of 1819 had left many Kentuckians in dire {{financial}} straits. Legislators sought to relieve {{some of the}} financial burden by passing a law of replevin which favored debtors. The Kentucky Court of Appeals, (the highest court in the Commonwealth at the time,) declared the law unconstitutional. The next year, an incensed General Assembly passed legislation that dissolved the court {{and replaced it with}} a new court. Neither court acknowledged the other as valid, and a confused public lost respect for public authority in general. The issue was generally split along party lines, with Democrats generally favoring the New Court and Whigs favoring the Old Court.|$|E

50|$|The section titled “Denial of Fair Public Trial” noted: “The {{constitution}} {{provides for}} an independent judiciary; however, {{the government did not}} respect judicial independence in practice.

5|$|By {{the start}} of 1973, John Lennon began {{distancing}} himself from {{the political and social}} issues he had embraced in the previous 18 months. It was also around this time that he and his wife, Yoko Ono, were going through marital problems. As Ono was completing her fourth album, Feeling the Space, Lennon decided he also wanted to record a new album, and liked the studio musicians that their assistant and production coordinator May Pang had assembled for Ono's album. Shortly thereafter, he asked Pang to book them for his sessions. Wanting to produce an album that would be more accepted than his previous <b>politically</b> <b>charged</b> commercial flop Some Time in New York City, Lennon began writing and demoing a few songs for Mind Games in his Greenwich Village apartment. He began composing after a period of almost a year of not writing any material.|$|E
5|$|Only {{the most}} <b>politically</b> <b>charged</b> and {{detailed}} weapons effects information was censored during this period. The Hiroshima-based magazine, Chugoku Bunka for example, {{in its first}} issue published March 10, 1946, devotes itself to detailing the damage from the bombing. Similarly, there was no censorship of the factually written witness accounts, the book Hiroshima written by Pulitzer Prize winner John Hersey, which was originally published in article form in the popular magazine The New Yorker, on August 31, 1946, {{is reported to have}} reached Tokyo in English by January 1947, and the translated version was released in Japan in 1949. The book narrates the stories of the lives of six bomb survivors from immediately prior to, and months after, the dropping of the Little Boy bomb. Beginning in 1974 a compilation of drawings and artwork made by the survivors of the bombings began to be compiled, with completion in 1977 and under both book and exhibition format, it was titled The Unforgettable Fire.|$|E
5|$|In 1988, Public Enemy {{released}} {{their second}} album It Takes a Nation of Millions to Hold Us Back to critical and commercial success. Their music's dense textures, {{provided by the}} group's production team The Bomb Squad, exemplified a new production aesthetic in hip hop at the time. The controversial, <b>politically</b> <b>charged</b> lyrics by the group's lead rapper Chuck D, whose braggadocio raps contained references to political figures such as Assata Shakur and Nelson Mandela, as well as endorsements of Nation of Islam-leader Louis Farrakhan, intensified the group's affiliation with black nationalism and Farrakhan. It Takes a Nations success helped raise hip hop's profile as both art and sociopolitical statement, amid media criticism of the genre. It helped give hip hop a critical credibility and standing in the popular music community after it had been largely dismissed as a fad since its introduction {{at the turn of}} the 1980s. In promoting the record, Public Enemy expanded their live shows and performing dynamic. With the album's content and the group's rage-filled showmanship in concert, they became the vanguard of a movement in hip hop that reflected a new black consciousness and socio-political dynamic that were taking shape in America at the time.|$|E

5|$|The Morumbi Stadium {{failed to}} provide proof of funding for a R$630million {{renovation}} plan requested by FIFA to secure {{its status as a}} World Cup venue; the stadium was then excluded from the tournament on 16 June 2010. The Local World Cup Committee suggested to use Arena Corinthians instead. FIFA accepted the suggestion and confirmed the decision on 10 October 2011. Journalist Wagner Vilaron from O Estado de S. Paulo deemed the exclusion of the Morumbi Stadium from the World Cup and the subsequent choice of Arena Corinthians as a venue for the event to be <b>politically</b> <b>charged.</b> After receiving several negative responses from FIFA about the renovation project for Morumbi, then-CBF-president Ricardo Teixeira lost patience with São Paulo Futebol Clube officers; he considered that they were delaying the decision by purposely failing to meet the requirements to force the government to spend money on the construction. São Paulo's opposition to Teixeira in the now defunct Clube dos 13 electionwhich was won by ruling-side Fábio Koff, aligned with São Paulo's Juvenal Juvêncioirritated the CBF president. At the same time, an affinity between Teixeira and then-president of Corinthians, Andrés Sanchezwho was chosen as the head of delegation for the national team during the 2010 FIFA World Cup and on the same side on Clube dos 13's electionwas noticed.|$|E

50|$|Pakistan has {{supported}} {{the aims of the}} International Court and voted for the Rome Statute in 1998.
