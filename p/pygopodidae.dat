50|$|Burton’s legless lizard (Lialis burtonis) is {{a member}} of the genus Lialis within the family <b>Pygopodidae.</b> There are {{approximately}} 40 species in the family <b>Pygopodidae,</b> however, Burton’s legless lizard and another species (L. jicari) are the only species that fall within genus Lialis. Members in genus Lialis are considered analogous to macrostomatan snakes as these taxonomic groups have functionally similar adaptations such as the ability to swallow relatively large prey whole. Differences between legless lizards and snakes, however, are that legless lizards lack venom glands, cannot constrict prey, they have a fleshy tongue rather than a forked tongue, they have visible ear holes and they have remnant hind limbs. Furthermore, Burton’s legless lizard and the <b>Pygopodidae,</b> as a whole, are most closely related genetically and anatomically to geckos in the family Gekkonidae. This is despite the convergence and superficial resemblance of this species with snakes.|$|E

50|$|<b>Pygopodidae</b> (commonly {{known as}} legless lizards, snake-lizards, or flap-footed lizards) {{is a family}} of squamates with reduced or absent limbs, and are a type of gecko. There are at least 35 species in two subfamilies and eight genera. They have unusually long, slender bodies, giving them a strong {{resemblance}} to snakes. Like snakes and most geckos, they have no eyelids, but unlike snakes, they have external ear holes and flat, unforked tongues. They are native to Australia and New Guinea.|$|E
50|$|Legless lizard may {{refer to}} any of several groups of lizards that have {{independently}} lost limbs or reduced them {{to the point of}} being of no use in locomotion. It is the common name for the family <b>Pygopodidae,</b> but often refers to other groups, such as limbless anguids, depending on the region of the world. These lizards are often distinguishable from snakes on the basis of one or more of the following characteristics: possessing eyelids, possessing external ear openings, lack of broad belly scales, notched rather than forked tongue, and/or a very long tail (while snakes have a long body and short tail).|$|E
5000|$|<b>Pygopodidae</b> - all 44 species; {{they belong}} to the genera Aprasia, Delma, Lialis, Ophidiocephalus, Paradelma, Pletholax and Pygopus. All are endemic to Australia, except the two species of Lialis, which also occur in New Guinea, {{one of which is}} endemic to that island. Pygopodids are not {{strictly}} legless since, although they lack forelimbs, they possess hindlimbs that are greatly reduced to small digitless flaps, hence the often used common names of [...] "flap-footed lizards" [...] or [...] "scaly-foot". The pygopodids are considered an advanced evolutionary clade of the Gekkota, which also contains six families of geckos.|$|E
50|$|Many {{vertebrates}} {{have evolved}} limbless or limb-reduced forms. Reptiles {{have on a}} number of occasions evolved into limbless forms - snakes, amphisbaenia, and legless lizards (limb loss in lizards has evolved independently several times, examples include the families <b>Pygopodidae</b> and Dibamidae and species of Isopachys, Anguis, and Ophisaurus). The same is true of amphibians - caecilians, Sirenidae (a clade of salamanders that are limbless except for atrophied front limbs), Amphiumidae (a clade of salamander with extremely atrophied limbs that appear non-functional) and at least two extinct groups (Aïstopoda and Lysorophia). Legless forms of reptiles and amphibians probably evolved so as to be able to move underground or in water more easily.|$|E

40|$|Sex {{determination}} in reptiles shows astonishing {{diversity in}} comparison with other amniotes. It includes temperature-dependent sex determination (TSD) in many turtles, all crocodiles, the tuatara and many lizards, {{a wide variety of}} female heterogamety and male heterogamety sex chromo-somal forms including species with multiple sex chromo-somes, and species in which temperature and sex chromosomes combine influence to determine sex [1 - 5]. Nowhere is this evolutionary lability more evi-dent than that among the Gekkota, the oldest radiation of squamates. This infraorder includes species with XX/XY and ZZ/ZW modes of sex determination and TSD, with different sex determination forms even within the same family (Figure 1). The <b>Pygopodidae,</b> endemic to Australia and New Guinea [10], is Gondwanan in origin and sits together with Australian geckos from the families Carphodactyli-dae and Diplodactylidae, within the infraorder Gekkota [6, 9]. The three Australian Gekkota families diverged around 70 million years ago (Figure 1 A). Species within <b>Pygopodidae</b> are known as flap-footed lizards or legless lizard because they have no forelimbs but retain vestigial hind limbs in the form of small scaly flaps [11].

40|$|Aim: Gondwanan {{lineages}} are {{a prominent}} {{component of the}} Australian terrestrial biota. However, most squamate (lizard and snake) lineages in Australia appear {{to be derived from}} relatively recent dispersal from Asia ([*] 34 [*]Ma (pre-Oligocene) and basal splits among the Australian diplodactyloids occurred c. 70 [*]Ma. However, most extant generic and intergeneric diversity within diplodactyloid lineages appears to post-date the late Oligocene (<[*] 30 [*]Ma). Main conclusions: Basal divergences within the diplodactyloids significantly pre-date the final break-up of East Gondwana, indicating that the group {{is one of the most}} ancient extant endemic vertebrate radiations east of Wallace's Line. At least five Australian lineages of diplodactyloid gecko are each as old or older than other well-dated Australian squamate radiations (e. g. elapid snakes and agamids). The limbless <b>Pygopodidae</b> (morphologically the most aberrant living geckos) appears to have radiated before Australia was occupied by potential ecological analogues. However, in spite of the great age of the diplodactyloid radiation, most extant diversity appears to be of relatively recent origin, a pattern that is shared with other Australian squamate lineages.

40|$|Twelve {{species of}} lizards (Agamidae, Scincidae, <b>Pygopodidae)</b> and three species of frogs (Leptodac- tylidae) {{comprise}} the herpetofaunal community of a Banksia woodland under a mediterranean-type climate in Western Australia. The reptiles bred in September-November and laid eggs in early summer. The requirement of surface water for tadpole development {{for two of}} the frog species restricted their breeding time to winter and necessitated their migration from the study area, where no water was available. The third species of frog, Myobatrachus gouldii, lacks an aquatic stage. Its reproductive pattern coincided with neither that of the reptiles nor the other frogs. Collections of most species in the community were not equally divided between sexes. For reptiles, this possibly was owing to differential trapping of the sexes. The very high frequency of capture of female frogs, other than those of M. gouldii, was probably related to differential dispersal of the sexes from breeding areas. The distribution of the percentage frequency of snout-vent lengths for six species of lizards suggests that individuals did not breed until their second year...|$|E
40|$|Squamate autapomorphies seen in sperm of the Scincidae (e. g. Ctenotus robustus, Carlia pectoralis, Cryptoblepharus virgatus, and Lampropholis delicata) are {{penetration}} of the fibrous sheath of the axoneme into the midpiece, and the paracrystalline subacrosomal cone. Sphenomorphus group spermatozoa (e. g. Ctenotus) and the Egernia group (Tiliqua) differ from the more derived Eugongylus group (C. virgatus, L. delicata and C. pectoralis) in that the acrosome is elongate and apically depressed; the perforatorium is strongly oblique; the midpiece is relatively short, with four dense ring structures in longitudinal succession; mitochondria are columnar; and enlarged peripheral fibres 3 and 8 do not show the gross anterior enlargement seen in Carlia and Lampropholis. Heteronotia binoei (Gekkonidae) sperm have no epinuclear electron-lucent region; nuclear shoulders are smooth, as in sphenomorph but not Eugongylus group skinks; mitochondria are columnar; unlike skinks, the median surfaces of the mitochondria are indented by triangular, sometimes longitudinally, interconnected dense bodies. In Lialis burtonis (<b>Pygopodidae)</b> sperm, the perforatorium extends virtually {{to the tip of}} the fore-shortened apically domed acrosome; nuclear shoulders are absent; the mitochondria alternate singly or in groups with one or more dense bodies which also form an interrupted collar around the distal centriole. Spermatozoal ultrastructure suggests that a common ancestry of snakes and pygopods deserves consideration...|$|E
40|$|Pitfall {{trapping}} {{is a long}} established {{method for}} trapping terrestrial vertebrates globally. Many variations in bucket and drift fence arrays are used. Recent survey guidelines have been published for Queensland and the Northern Territory. In Queensland a “T” pattern is recommended, and we used data collected over five years to assess whether {{the use of this}} array, {{with the addition of a}} central bucket (Pit B), results in more captures, particularly in the central bucket. A total of 263 sites representing 1052 bucket samples were examined and the differences in capture abundance in bucket location was tested using analysis of variance. Pitfall bucket location significantly affected the captures of Dasyuridae, Muridae, Agamidae, <b>Pygopodidae,</b> Scincidae (P< 0. 1), and mean abundance was highest in the central Pit B except for Agamidae. There was also significant variation in abundance across habitat type for these families, excluding Dasyuridae, but including Gekkonidae. We conclude that having a central bucket where drift fences join can increase trap success, and this is a function of effective trapping area (i. e. catchment of animal activity and length of drift fence per bucket). Increased captures may have some relationship to habitat type (i. e. small mammals more abundant in grassland habitat). Though this particular array has some benefits in increasing trap success, the use of multiple survey techniques is recommended for any thorough fauna inventory...|$|E
40|$|Geckos are {{the most}} vocalizing animals among Squamata. Previously we {{discovered}} a contractile segment (the NAL, noncartilaginous abneural limbus), within the rigid periotic cochlear frame of the gecko Teratoscincus scincus [Ganeshina and Vorobyev, 2003]. Because this unusual cochlear specialization has not previously been described in the vertebrate hearing organs, we have hypothesized that the NAL has evolved within Gekkota as a specialization associated with vocalization and sound communication. Here we show that the NAL is present in ten other species belonging to four major Gekkota clades: Gekkoninae, Diplodactylinae, Eublepharinae and <b>Pygopodidae.</b> The NAL exhibits similar structural organization among the Gekkota species. It is composed of large, tightly packed cells enriched with a filamentous cytoskeleton and extensively interconnected via putative gap junctions. No relationship is found between the extent of development of the NAL and degree of vocalization. However, the species with relatively large body dimensions show larger absolute NAL area and structural peculiarities of the NAL that might affect its mechanical properties. A representative of the non-gekkonoid, non-vocalizing lizard, Pogona barbata (Iguania, Agamidae), possesses a similar cochlear specialization. This provides evidence that the NAL is not the exclusive feature of the Gekkota hearing organs. Our data are compatible with {{the hypothesis that the}} NAL appeared before the Gekkota separated from other Squamata groups as a mechanism involved in maintenance of the cochlear mechanical or ionic homeostasis...|$|E
40|$|Caudal {{autotomy}} is {{a common}} defense mechanism in lizards, where the animal may lose part or all of its tail to escape entrapment. Lizards show an immense variety {{in the degree of}} investment in a tail (i. e., length) across species, with tails of some species up to three or four times body length (snoutvent length [SVL]). Additionally, body size and form also vary dramatically, including variation in leg development and robustness and length of the body and tail. Autotomy is therefore likely to have fundamentally different effects on the overall body form and function in different species, which may be reflected directly in the incidence of lost/regenerating tails within populations or, over a longer period, in terms of relative tail length for different species. We recorded data (literature, museum specimens, field data) for relative tail length (n = 350 species) and the incidence of lost/regenerating tails (n = 246 species). We compared these (taking phylogeny into account) with intrinsic factors that have been proposed to influence selective pressures acting on caudal autotomy, including body form (robustness, body length, leg development, and tail specialization) and ecology (foraging behavior, physical and temporal niches), in an attempt to identify patterns that might reflect adaptive responses to these different factors. More gracile species have relatively longer tails (all 350 spp., P < 0. 001; also significant for five of the six families tested separately), as do longer (all species, P < 0. 001; Iguanidae, P < 0. 05; Lacertidae, P < 0. 001; Scindidae, P < 0. 001), climbing (all species, P < 0. 05), and diurnal (all species, P < 0. 01; <b>Pygopodidae,</b> P < 0. 01) species; geckos without specialized tails (P < 0. 05); or active-foraging skinks (P < 0. 05). We also found some relationships with the data for caudal autotomy, with more lost/regenerating tails for nocturnal lizards (all 246 spp., P < 0. 01; Scindidae, P < 0. 05), larger skinks (P < 0. 05), climbing geckos (P < 0. 05), or activeforaging iguanids (P < 0. 05). The selective advantage of investing in a relatively longer tail may be due to locomotor mechanics, although the patterns observed are also largely consistent with predictions based on predation pressure...|$|E
40|$|Extract] Paradelma orienralis is {{a member}} of the {{monophyletic}} and endemic family of Australian lizards, the <b>Pygopodidae</b> (Kluge 1974). Until relatively recently P. orientalis was known only from a small number of scattered localities exclusively within the central and southem Brigalow Belt region, east of the Great Dividing Range in south-central Queensland (Wilson and Knowles 1988; Cogger et al. 1993). New populations are now known for the southern, eastern and western extremes of this bioregion (Schulz and Eyre 1997; Tremul 1999). The eponymous common name implies P. orientalis has a strong association with the Brigalow Belt and this is certainly its core distribution (Covacevich et al. 1998). Habitat is generically reported as woodland consisting of, or associated with, Brigalow Acacia harpophylla vegetation (Wilson and Knowles 1988; Cogger er al. 1993; Sattler and Williams 1999), though a range of other Eucalyptus woodland associations without Brigalow have been recorded (Shea 1987; Wilson and Knowles 1988; Schulz and Eyre 1997; Tremul 1999). Many of these have a dense sub-canopy of other rough-barked species such as Callitris columellaris, Allocasuarina luehmanni and Acacia falciformis (Schulz and Eyre 1997; Tremul 1999). The biology of the species is poorly known. It is known to be oviparous, laying two eggs (Greer 1989), and detailed observations of a population on Boyne Island indicate it clearly noctural, active in temperatures generally above 19 °C, partly arboreal, and both a sap and invertebrate feeding species (Tremul 1999). Sap feeding is unreported for other Pygopodids (Tremul 1999), but has been observed for geckos (Couper et al. 1995). The Brigalow Belt is one of the most highly modified and poorly reserved bioregions in Queensland (Covacevich et al. 1998; Sattler and Williams 1999) and almost no baseline or detailed bioregional fauna survey was conducted in the Brigalow Belt prior to the onset of extensive land clearance schemes in the 1960 's (Gordon 1984; Covacevich et al. 1998). Twenty-seven reptiles are considered restricted to, or significantly distributed within, this bioregion, eighteen being of conservation significance (Covacevich et al. 1998). Paradelma orientalis is listed as vulnerable in Queensland under the Nature Conservation Legislation Amendment Regulation (No. 2) 1997 and Action Plan for Australian Reptiles (Cogger et al. 1993), though its continued appearance in new locations caused some authors to consider its conservation status requiring further investigation (Schulz and Eyre 1997). Habitat modification and conversion of native woodland to pasture and agriculture is considered to have had a severe impact on the pre-European distribution and abundance of this species (Gordon 1984; Cogger et al. 1993; Covacevich et al. 1998). This note reports new locality data for P. orientalis collected incidentally during large-scale vertebrate fauna surveys in the Desert Uplands and Northern Brigalow Belt. Habitat data and implications for conservation status are discussed...|$|E
