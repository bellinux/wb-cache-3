40|$|The main {{objective}} of this thesis has been to record the degree of efficiency in {{two different types of}} pot designs, both constructed for catching cod (Gadus morhua). The two types of technologies were a Canadian cod pot developed by Centre for Sustainable Aquatic Resources (CSAR) at the Fisheries and Marine Institute of Memorial University of Newfoundland Canada and a Norwegian two-chamber pot developed by the Norwegian Institute for Marine Research. For having the possibility of comparing catch rates and as an indicator of the amount of target species and possible by-catch available in trial areas, bottom gillnets were used. Our results show low catch rates in both types of pots, {{with a high degree of}} variation. The highest catch rates produced by the pots are caught inshore with low sea current conditions. Both pot types have interesting by-catch profiles and the quality of catch is superior.

40|$|Graduation date: 1976 Eleven cruises were {{conducted}} on the Oregon continental slope from April 1973 to March 1975 to assess the biology and ecology of the Tanner crab, Chionoecetes tanneri Rathbun. Bathymetric and seasonal analysis {{of the distribution of}} adult Tanner crabs west of Coos Bay, Oregon, revealed no segregation of sexes or seasonal migration. Relative abundance of adult crabs was greatest in the 500 - 700 m depth range. Juveniles were found throughout the adult depth range. Density estimates using a three meter beam trawl were 0 - 500 crabs/km² (mean = 56) for adult male C. tanneri and 0 - 1100 crabs/km² (mean = 164) for adult females. Stock estimates for the Oregon coast (500 - 700 m) and for the Oregon and Washington coasts (457 - 869 m) supported Pereyra's (1972) conclusion that a Tanner crab fishery would not be feasible at this time. Longline <b>pot</b> <b>fishing</b> was suggested as a better method of assessing the commercial potential of the Tanner crab stock.

Behavioural studies were also conducted with two different designs of the “Lofoten pot” (with a closed and an open lower chamber, respectiviely). Survival of cod caught in pots was studied by holding fish in tanks. Two-chamber pots that were floated 35 cm off the bottom gave highest catch rates for cod, 28 % and 43 % higher than bottom set pots and pots floated 95 cm off the bottom, respectively. Behavioural observations showed that cod searched close to the sea bed when approaching the pots. Cod were often observed swimming {{into and out of the}} lower chamber of the Lofoten pot with a closed chamber, and several fish swam into the upper chamber and were caught. For the Lofoten pot with an open lower chamber, fish were seldom seen approaching the entrance leading into the upper chamber, and few were caught. The survival rate of cod held in tanks was 74 %. Dead fish were floating, had gas bobbles in the blood, stiff body, distended gill covers and open mouth. Physiological parameters (pH, lactate, glucose) showed that the fish were less affected by the catching process compared with fish caught by Danish seine.

40|$|Background The {{objective}} {{of this research was}} to determine the association between LBP that limited or interrupted fishing work and ergonomic low back stress measured by (1) self-reported task and (2) two ergonomic assessment methods of low back stress. Methods Eligible participants were from a cohort of North Carolina commercial fishermen followed for LBP in regular clinic visits from 1999 to 2001 (n[*]=[*] 177). Work history, including crab pot and gill net fishing task frequency, was evaluated in a telephone questionnaire (n[*]=[*] 105). Ergonomic exposures were measured in previous study of 25 fishermen using two methods. The occurrence rate of LBP that limited or interrupted fishing work since last visit (severe LBP) was evaluated in a generalized Poisson regression model. Results Predictors of severe LBP included fishing with crew members and a previous history of severe LBP. Among crab pot and gill net fishermen (n[*]=[*] 89), running pullers or net reels, sorting catch, and unloading catch were associated with an increased rate of LBP. Percent of time in forces 3 ̆e 20 lb while in non-neutral trunk posture, spine compression 3 ̆e 3, 400 N, and National Institute of Occupational Safety and Health lifting indices 3 ̆e 3. 0 were associated with LBP. Conclusions Tasks characterized by higher (unloading boat and sorting catch) and lower (running puller or net reel) ergonomic low back stress were associated with the occurrence of severe LBP. History of LBP, addition of crew members, and self-selection out of tasks were likely important contributors to the patterns of low back stress and outcomes we observed.

40|$|Ecological {{field studies}} {{were carried out}} in situ on Modiolus {{modiolus}} biogenic reefs throughout the UK to quantify the functional importance of these habitats and the associated ecosystem services that they provide to society. Using a combination of techniques, including Underwater Visual Censuses (UVCs), video transects and <b>pot</b> <b>fishing,</b> the key species associated with M. modious reefs were found to be Buccinum undatum and Aequipecten opercularis. B. undatum catches were three times higher on the M. modiolus reefs compared to adjacent habitats and the UVCs showed that A. opercularis were five times more abundant on M. modiolus reef sites. By providing a habitat for these commercially important shellfish, M. modiolus reefs act as an Essential Fish Habitat and support sustainable livelihoods. M. modiolus are ecosystem engineers and can occur as dense aggregations, which form raised, three dimensional reef structures on the seabed. A new method was developed to measure M. modiolus biodeposition rates in situ and this provides the first evidence of the scale at which M. modiolus are able to enhance sedimentation and contribute to the downward flux of material to the seabed. M. modiolus biogenic reefs are recognised as biodiversity hotspots and protected in Marine Protected Areas. However, under controlled conditions when subject to seawater temperatures above those experienced in the wild, byssus thread production is compromised whilst biodeposition rates are modified also. M. modiolus reefs at the southern limit of their known distribution will continue to exist in the short term but with predicted increased seawater temperature, M. modiolus {{may not be able to}} function to their full ability. These habitats are vulnerable to physical impact from mobile fishing gear and the results presented here suggest that reef recovery through byssus attachment and clump formation would be limited, especially in southern populations. Management of protected reefs should take this into account and ensure that ecosystem resilience is maximised through well enforced management measures...|$|E

40|$|Finfish pots {{have emerged}} as a “responsible” gear, when used in {{combination}} with conservational and technical measures to sustain fisheries. Previous trials in Irish waters have offered no published reported data and so three designs tested {{in the current study}} provide new information on this gear. The most successful traps in terms of fish catch were rigid steel framed rectangular pots used to target Conger eel. Although commercial yield was low (0. 2 per trap haul), potential existed for a viable pot fishery. Deployment and storage of Norwegian floating pots was conducted with relative ease but performance in the water was poor resulting in loss of gear. Catch returns were notable even though effort was restricted as mega-faunal by-catch was a problem, which lead to ending this trial. From these initial trials it was evident that catch rates were low compared to established Norwegian fisheries (3. 6 cod per pot), which resulted in the utilisation of pots, already established in the crustacean fishery, to find species readily accessible to pot capture. Although fished and designed differently, these gears provided an opportunity to establish the benefits of <b>pot</b> <b>fishing</b> to fish quality and to determine the effects on by-catch. The fishing effects of three catching methods (pots, angling and trawl) and the effects of air exposure on the physiological status of a common by-catch, the lesser spotted dogfish Scyliorhinus canícula (L.) were examined using a range of physiological biomarkers (plasma catecholamine, glucose, lactate, muscle pH and muscle lactate). Physiological responses of fish to an emersion stress regime resulted in a significant metabolic disturbance in groups, but may not have weakened the overall health of these fish, as signified in the revival of some metabolites. Plasma glucose and lactate concentrations did not however recovery to baseline levels indicating that to achieve an accurate profile, responses should be determined by a suite of biomarkers. Responses did not demonstrate that samples from the pots were significantly less stressed than for the other two methods; angling and trawling, which are in contrast to many other studies. Employment of finfish potting therefore in Irish waters needs further consideration before further promotion as a more responsible method to supplement or replace established techniques...|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 2008 Recent {{observational}} {{programs to}} understand the coastal ocean, like the Oregon Coastal Ocean Observing System (OrCOOS) are under development (www. orcoos. org). A challenge in facing observing systems is achieving spatial and temporal coverage at scales that are useful for ocean modeling. Observational buoys are relatively few and towed arrays and gliders can only cover a small area of the ocean. As a result there are limited year round oceanographic records at sufficient spatial scale in the waters off Oregon to characterize the important physical processes that affect our coastal oceans. Therefore, {{the purpose of this}} research project was to assess the interest of Oregon commercial crab fishermen and test the long term feasibility of an ocean monitoring strategy. Commercial crab fishermen spend many, many days at sea each year. Their crab pots, each clearly positioned using GPS, cover much of Oregon’s coastal ocean from the near shore to the shelf break. Incorporating ocean observation gathered from instruments attached to crab pots has the potential to substantially increase the data available to the OrCOOS program and ocean researchers. The initial results of this research project are very encouraging. While little if any scientific conclusions may be drawn from the limited data set thus far, the concept of a cost effective partnership with local commercial crab fishermen and the application of small temperature logger technology has been demonstrated. The use of environmental sensors on crab pots for ocean research and monitoring applications documented several significant oceanographic events. It became obvious that multiple scales of variability could be captured including upwelling interrupted by warm events, relaxations, or reversals of the wind. Furthermore, this research project was set up to test the long-term feasibility of an oceanographic monitoring strategy using crab <b>pot</b> <b>fishing</b> gear and expectations of finding anything significant from crab catch during exploratory statistical analysis was low. However, there were some interesting weak to moderate significant correlations (spearman’s rho) between Dungeness crabs (males and females) with region fished, bottom temperature, and depth, respectively. This information could be used in partnership with the Oregon Crab Commission and State agencies to study adult crab biology and ecosystems for management planning and meet MSC criteria for sustainability certification...|$|E
40|$|The Common whelk, Buccinum undatum (L.) is a {{conspicuous}} benthic scavenger in Irish waters, {{and is a}} valuable fisheries resource in South East Ireland. B. undatum is fished {{in many parts of}} its range, and previous studies have shown that certain life history parameters, which vary with location, make this species vulnerable to overexploitation. This makes research into each exploited stock essential to ensure sustainable fisheries management of the species. In 2003, interest in B. undatum as a complementary species in the inshore fishery east of the Inishowen Peninsula, North West Ireland, initiated investigation into fisheries related biological and population aspects of the species in this region. The current study presents estimates of spatial variation and density of the stock, size at age and growth rates, size and age at onset of sexual maturity, and timing of reproductive events in the region of the North West Irish whelk fishery for the period of June 2003 to May 2004. Analysis of variance of the total shell length of whelk landings to the fishery was conducted over spatial scales of fishing <b>pot,</b> <b>fishing</b> string and landings to vessels. Landings varied significantly in shell length at the spatial scale at which whelks are attracted to baited pots, but did not vary significantly over larger spatial scales. Depletion estimates of stock density from fisheries derived Catch per Unit Effort data and a mark re-capture experiment estimate 0. 134 - 0. 227 whelks per m 2. Two independent methods of age determination found similar growth logistics functions for B. undatum. Modal analysis of length frequency distribution of landings to the fishery estimated symptotic length, Leo = 151. 64 mm and Brody growth coefficient, K = 0. 04. Analysis of the striae in individual opercula, where each stria was found to represent annual growth, estimated Loo = 137. 73 mm and K = 0. 12. Common whelks in the region of the North West Irish whelk fishery grow slowly and are long-lived, with 19 opercula striae recorded in one individual. Onset of sexual maturity is late, and no sex-specific differences in size or age at maturity were determined in the present study. Males were found to achieve sexual maturity at 83. 30 ± 10. 77 mm, and 8. 9 - 11. 1 years of age, and females at 82. 62 ± 10. 68 mm and 8. 8 to 11. 1 years of age. Systematic observations of reproductive events, including histological changes to the female ovary and male testis, and changes in the size and mass of body components, suggest that breeding occurred between the autumn and winter months of October and December 2003.

It has never studied to be clear the function changes in trap gear during operations. In the present study, the function changes in trap gear were studied with using material engineering and hydrodynamical methods. The results obtaind can be summarized as follows: 1. The breaking strength and elongation of netting twines after soaked in the sea more than three years were measured. Nylon and polyethylene netting twines having thickness of 220 - 1980 denier were used. The breaking strength and elongation were sharply decreased for the first 1 year after soaked in the sea, and became a constant during 2 - 3 years. The retained breaking strength and elongation after 3 years of all test netting twines were about 70 % and 40 - 60 %, respectivly. 2. An encrusted condition of marine foulings on nettings for set nets which consider influence to measure a drag on the fouled plane netting by marine foulings were measured. The test netings were soaked around a set net fishing ground during the periods from 15 to 60 days and some water depthes (1. 5 to 15 m). The test netting consisted of polyester multi-filaments (0. 85 mm in diameter and 17 mm in bar length), which is commonly used for the set net fishing gear. The main marine foulings are fine attaching materials so-called "Nuta", Amphipoda, a kind of hydrozoans Tubulalia mesembryanthemum and a kind of moss animals Bugula neritina. 3. The drag per 1 m² for each test net at the right attack angle and 0. 5 m/s in flow velocity was from 3. 7 kgw to 19. 3 kgw. The changing ratio of drag varied from 1. 4 times to 8. 5 times against the initial (unused) netting. The mean ratio of drag on each soaking period, however, peaked 6. 5 times of the 30 th day net and then it scarcely changed till 60 th day net. 3. The drag per 1 m 2 for each test net at the right attack angle and 0. 5 m/s in flow velocity was from 3. 7 kgw to 19. 3 kgw. The changing raito of the drag varied from 1. 4 times to 8. 5 times against the unused net. However, the mean raito og drag on each soaking period peaked 6. 5 times of 30 days in soaking periods and then it scarcely changed till 60 days. The porosity (β) of the nettings before and after fouling changed from 76 to 16 %. The drag coefficient (CD) of fouled nettings can be expressed by the following equation; CD= 35. 98 (Rh) ⁻⁰. ⁴³(1. 7 × 10 ²<Rh< 1. 8 × 10 ³), where Rh is Reynolds number based on hydraulic mean depth of a fouled netting. However, the drag coefficient may be rather influenced the porosity for Rh< 5 × 10 ². The drag coefficient (CD) of a fouled netting was determined to be 1. 3 at 0. 6 <β< 0. 8 and 2. 2 atβ< 0. 5, respectively. The results suggest that the drag coefficient of a fouled netting is determined by its porosity. 4. To evaluate the preferable fishing ground for cuttlefish basket traps from bottom condition and CPUE (kg/trap/day) at two different fishing grounds (off Ariake and off Fukae) in Shimabara sound. The Md φ of off Ariake and off Fukae weres - 0. 3 to 3. 0 and 1. 0 to 1. 5, which were limited range against the whole Shimabara Sound (- 5. 4 to 5. 6). CPUE of off Fukae was 2 -fold greater than that of off Ariake. The significance of differences in CPUE between two fishing grounds was verified by taken together Mann-Whitney test (p< 0. 05). The results suggest that the medium sandy se﻿a bottom is more preferable for capturing of golden cuttlefish by the cuttlefish basket trap. 5. Catches were high at water temperature between 12 - 14 ℃. Daily catches varied periodically due to the change in the lunar cycle, and it became maximum at neap tide, or ebb, and minimum at spring tide. In this region, water temperature seems to be an important long-term factor affecting the main fishing period, and tidal current seems to be an important short-term factor controlling daily catch. The amount of catch might be controlled by both water temperature and tidal current, which is therefore the important factors in the cuttlefish basket trap fishery...|$|E

The most commonly used was gill net or 'pante', followed by <b>fish</b> <b>pot</b> 'bubo', <b>fish</b> corral 'baklad', spear 'salapang', spear gun 'pana', fish trap 'patanga', encircling net 'takilis' and long line 'kitay'. Tilapia comprised 61 % of the total fish production of the lake, followed by therapon (16 %), goby (4 %) and mudfish (2 %). The other species caught were 'pla salid', catfish, mullet, carp, milkfish and shrimp, which contributed 17 % to the total production. Migratory fishes like the mullet and milkfish, on the other hand, showed a declining trend in production...|$|R
