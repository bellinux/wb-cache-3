40|$|The puzzling {{evidence}} of seemingly high momentum returns {{is related to}} an understanding of risk as a simple covariance. If we consider, however, risk in higher-order statistical moments, momentum returns appear less advantageous. Thus, a prospect-theoretical assessment of US stock momentum returns provides a possible direction for explaining this puzzle.

40|$|UnrestrictedThe {{purpose of}} this {{research}} work is to device a system that {{would be able to}} measure the minute changes in flow of viscous fluids that are being employed in Contour Crafting. We have chosen the method of image processing for measuring the flow rate. In normal circumstances, three dimensional image processing is a complex process, requiring heavy computations, but since our requirement includes supporting a real-time scenario, we need {{to come up with a}} customized solution. Such a solution would not only make processing fast but also, real-time. We divide the problem into two parts; first detecting the edge of the protruding material that would <b>provide</b> <b>us</b> with <b>the</b> horizontal width of the material and the other curve detection that would <b>provide</b> <b>us</b> <b>the</b> vertical width.
