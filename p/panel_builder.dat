Se realizó una programación visual y se analizaron las dimensiones de las barras cilíndricas, acrílicos y la abertura de las pinzas de los manipuladores, así como sus ángulos y espacios de trabajo para considerar nuevas materias primas. Para la configuración para la comunicación del protocolo Data Highway Plus y la compatibilidad con el protocolo Modbus Plus se utilizó un convertidor DL- 3500. El trabajo presentado en este artículo muestra la integración de nuevos materiales para el proceso de maquilado y el {{manejo de}} diferentes protocolos que se encuentran en las diferentes industrias. A Man-Machine Interface {{with the software}} <b>Panel</b> <b>Builder</b> 32, that interacts with Panel View 1000, to perform {{the control of the}} Pneumatics Station PN- 2800 is presented. This station provides raw material to an Integrated Manufacturing Center. Visual programming was used and the dimensions of the cylindrical bars, acrylic parts and the gap of the gripers of the manipulators, as well as their angles and spaces of work to consider new raw material. For the configuration of the communication protocol Dates Highway Plus and the compatibility with the protocol Modbus Plus a converter DL- 3500 was used. The work presented in this article shows the integration of new materials for the process of maquilado and the handling of different protocols that are found in different industries...|$|E

By creating a sealed leading edge tank, the fuel is {{moved away from the}} pilot for better crash survivability with the added benefit of more than doubling the fuel capacity.|$|R
40|$|Nowadays Information stealers are {{reaching}} {{high levels of}} sophistication. The number of families and variants observed increased exponentially in the last years. Furthermore, these trojans are sold on underground markets along with automatic frameworks that include web-based administration <b>panels,</b> <b>builders</b> and customization procedures. From a technical point of view such malware {{is equipped with a}} functionality, called WebInject, that exploits API hooking techniques to intercept all sensitive data in a browser context and modify web pages on infected hosts. In this paper we propose Prometheus, an automatic system that is able to analyze trojans that base their attack technique on DOM modifications. Prometheus is able to identify the injection operations performed by malware, and generate signatures based on the injection behavior. Furthermore, it is able to extract the WebInject targets by using memory forensic techniques. We evaluated Prometheus against real-world, online websites and a dataset of distinct variants of financial trojans. In our experiments we show that our approach correctly recognizes known variants of WebInject-based malware and successfully extracts the WebInject targets...|$|R

Thus for a simple project Flash Catalyst may even {{be used as the}} sole software for the entire authoring/programming steps.|$|R
