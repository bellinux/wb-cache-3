50|$|The main {{difference}} in 4-track cartridge design from 8-tracks is that 4-tracks lack a built-in <b>pinch</b> <b>roller</b> (usually {{made out of}} rubber or plastic) which would grip and help move the tape; a hole is left in the cartridge for a <b>pinch</b> <b>roller</b> to be inserted from inside the 4-track player itself. The large opening {{in the bottom of}} the 4-track cartridge, for admission of the <b>pinch</b> <b>roller,</b> leaves 4-track tapes more susceptible to trapping dirt and other substances besides those normally found inside cartridges, and requires a greater level of mechanical complexity in the player, as the <b>pinch</b> <b>roller</b> must be inserted and retracted vertically through the bottom of the cartridge.|$|E

5000|$|The [...] "melted" [...] rubber <b>pinch</b> <b>rollers</b> {{that can}} be found in many early 8-Track {{cartridges}} were the result of the rubber not being fully cured. After discovering this cause, later cartridges used only fully cured (hard) rubber <b>pinch</b> <b>rollers</b> that did not deteriorate as much over time.|$|R

5000|$|The capstan is a {{rotating}} spindle used to move recording tape through {{the mechanism of}} a tape recorder. The tape is threaded between the capstan and one or more rubber-covered wheels, called <b>pinch</b> <b>rollers,</b> which press against the capstan, thus providing friction necessary for the capstan to pull the tape. The capstan is always placed downstream (in the direction of tape motion) from the tape heads. To maintain the required tension against the tape heads and {{other part of the}} tape transport, a small amount of drag is placed on the supply reel. Tape recorder capstans have a function similar to nautical capstans, which however have no <b>pinch</b> <b>rollers,</b> the line simply being wound around them.|$|R
5000|$|Unlike {{the later}} consumer-marketed 8-track {{cartridge}} developed later in 1964 by Bill Lear {{which had the}} <b>pinch</b> <b>roller</b> integrated in the cartridge, the Fidelipac cartridge had {{a hole in the}} right-hand bottom front corner of the cartridge, where the <b>pinch</b> <b>roller,</b> built into the player instead, would swing up into place to support the tape up against the capstan. While later machines from ATC, ITC, Harris, and others had machines where the <b>pinch</b> <b>roller</b> would automatically engage into the cartridge when the play button was pressed (the capstan motor was already running when the cart was inserted), early machines such as Sparta, Spot-matic, and others made the operator physically push or pull a lever to get the <b>pinch</b> <b>roller</b> in place before playback could begin. However, the 8-track was slower in speed ( [...] ips compared to Fidelipac's [...] ips) and did not have adequate tape support pads, and thus were not [...] "broadcast quality." [...] The lower speed and narrower tracks in 8-track cartridges led to higher noise and poorer frequency response. The 8-track design also lacked a cue track.|$|E

5000|$|... † In modern {{automatic}} processing machines, the stop bath {{is replaced by}} mechanical squeegee or <b>pinching</b> <b>rollers.</b> These treatments remove much of the carried-over alkaline developer, and the acid, when used, neutralizes the alkalinity to reduce the contamination of the fixing bath with the developer.|$|R
50|$|A {{decrease}} {{in the quality of}} the parts used in the eight-track cartridge, that is, plastic <b>pinch</b> <b>rollers,</b> lubricant quality and quantity, etc., was another blow to the faltering format. As these problems further reduced the reliability, sound quality, and consistent tape speed, the eight-track eventually developed a reputation for being unreliable.|$|R
50|$|As {{time went}} on, these issues were {{compounded}} as later cartridges started using cheaper, lower quality materials, such as plastic <b>pinch</b> <b>rollers.</b> Another contributing factor {{was an effort}} by record companies {{to reduce the number}} of formats offered. In the late 1970s, when sales of eight-tracks slipped, they were quick to abandon the format.|$|R
50|$|The Lear Jet Stereo 8 track {{cartridge}} {{was designed}} by Richard Kraus while working under Bill Lear and for his Lear Jet Corporation in 1963. The major change was to incorporate a neoprene rubber and nylon <b>pinch</b> <b>roller</b> into the cartridge itself, rather than to make the <b>pinch</b> <b>roller</b> {{a part of the}} tape player, reducing mechanical complexity. Lear also eliminated some of the internal parts of the Eash cartridge, such as the tape-tensioning mechanism and an interlock that prevented tape spillage. By doubling the number of tracks from 4 to 8, the recording length doubled to 80 minutes.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>pinch</b> <b>roller</b> is a rubberized, free-spinning wheel {{typically}} used to press magnetic tape against a capstan shaft {{in order to}} create friction necessary to drive the tape along the magnetic heads (erase, write, read).|$|E
50|$|Pinch wheel or <b>pinch</b> <b>roller</b> was {{the name}} used for the plastic or rubber wheels in an 8-track cartridge, used to guide and align the {{magnetic}} tape. Rubber rollers were known to degrade over time, creating a maintenance issue.|$|E
5000|$|Nickels and Keane; {{they were}} to propel trains by pumping air into a {{continuous}} canvas tube; the train {{had a pair of}} <b>pinch</b> <b>rollers</b> squeezing the outside of the tube, and the air pressure forced the vehicle forward; the effect was the converse of squeezing a toothpaste tube. They claimed a successful demonstration in a timber yard in Waterloo Road.|$|R
50|$|The {{machines}} played continuously {{using an}} auto-reverse mechanism. As the tape reaches one end, the reverse mechanism activates and changes the drive direction. The tape head {{moves to the}} other side and the mechanism shifts <b>pinch</b> <b>rollers.</b> The design does not require the head to turn over; instead, the entire head changes position to play the tape at {{the other side of the}} tape path.|$|R
50|$|After {{exposure}} every {{photograph is}} taken through <b>pinch</b> <b>rollers</b> {{inside of the}} instant camera. Thereby the developer paste contained in the paper 'sandwich' distributes on the image. After a minute, the cover sheet just needs to be removed and one gets a single original positive image with a fixed format. With some systems it was also possible to create an instant image negative, from which then could be made copies in the photo lab. The ultimate development was the SX-70 system of Polaroid, in which a row of ten shots - engine driven - could be made without having to remove any cover sheets from the picture. There were instant cameras {{for a variety of}} formats, as well as cartridges with instant film for normal system cameras.|$|R
50|$|Most {{magnetic}} tape recorders use one capstan motor and one <b>pinch</b> <b>roller</b> located after the magnetic heads {{in the direction of}} the moving tape. However multiple pinch rollers may also be employed in association with one or more capstans. An example of the application of multiple pinch rollers is the Technics-RS1520 tape recorder, which utilizes two pinch rollers located on opposite sides of a single capstan shaft, providing a more stable transport across two sets of magnetic heads. Dual pinch rollers are also used (along with dual capstans) in auto-reverse cassette decks to drive the tape in both directions as needed. In this case, only one <b>pinch</b> <b>roller</b> is pressed against its corresponding capstan at a time.|$|E
50|$|A tape {{transport}} is {{the collection}} of parts of a magnetic tape player or recorder that the actual tape passes through. Transport parts include the head, capstan, <b>pinch</b> <b>roller,</b> tape pins, and tape guide. The tape transport {{as a whole is}} called the transport mechanism.|$|E
50|$|Modern {{professional}} recorders usually use a three-motor scheme. One motor with {{a constant}} rotational speed drives the capstan. This, usually {{combined with a}} rubber <b>pinch</b> <b>roller,</b> ensures that the tape speed does not fluctuate. The other two motors, which are called Torque Motors, apply equal and opposite torques to the supply and take up reels during recording and play back functions and maintain the tape's tension. During fast winding operations the <b>pinch</b> <b>roller</b> is disengaged and the take up reel motor is supplied with a higher voltage than the supply motor. The cheapest models use a single motor for all required functions; the motor drives the capstan directly and the supply and take-up reels are loosely coupled to the capstan motor with slipping belts or clutches. There are also variants with two motors, in which one motor is used for rewinding only.|$|E
2500|$|In the {{induction}} billet heater {{the whole of}} the billet or slug is heated. Normally for short billets or slugs a hopper or bowl is used to automatically present the billets in line to <b>pinch</b> <b>rollers,</b> chain driven tractor units or in some cases pneumatic pushers. The billets are then driven through the coil one behind the other on water cooled rails or ceramic liners are used through the coil bore which reduce friction and prevent wear. [...] The length of the coil {{is a function of the}} required soak time, the cycle time per component and the length of the billet. In high volume large cross section work it is not unusual to have 4 or 5 coils in series to give [...] of coil or more.|$|R
5000|$|In {{the process}} of {{whiteprint}} copying , [...] (essentially a diazotype process), a dynamic contact copier is used (similar to the manual action of exposing both sheets strongly bonded directly to the sunlight.). The exposition is made progressively as the twin rollers pull the two papers together (original and copy) against a source of ultraviolet light, typically a powerful black light lamp [...] The original plan (on a transparent support) and the diazo paper are introduced, in perfect contact, within the <b>pinch</b> <b>rollers</b> of the contact copier. The sensitized paper, has a photosensitive coating -an impregnation of diazo - covering {{the surface of the}} paper. Once exposed, the copied paper is immersed in a developer solution made from ammonia (or ammonia vapor) converting the parts of the paper not exposed to the light source to a characteristic dark violet colour (blue-line).|$|R

While waiting to test different components in the PTS, I was able to assist with testing for the Hose Management Assembly (HMA) {{and was able to}} work on a simulation in Labview. For the HMA, I was able to help with testing of a coating as well as to help test the durability of the <b>pinch</b> <b>rollers</b> in space. In Labview, I experimented with building a simulation for the PTS, to show where fluids and gases were flowing depending on which valves in the PTS were opened. Not all of the integrated parts required assembly level testing, which allowed me to test these parts individually by myself and document the results. I was also able to volunteer to assist project NEO, allowing me to gain some knowledge of cryogenic fluid systems...|$|R
50|$|In the Cousino, Eash, Muntz, and Lear {{cartridge}}s, {{tape was}} {{pulled from the}} center of the reel, passed across the opening at one end of the cartridge and wound back onto the outside of the same reel.

50|$|One problem {{occurs when}} iron oxide (or similar) {{particles}} from the tape itself become {{lodged in the}} playback head. As a result, the tape heads will require occasional cleaning to remove such particles. The metal capstan and the rubber <b>pinch</b> <b>roller</b> can become coated with these particles, leading them to pull the tape less precisely over the head; this in turn leads to misalignment of the tape over the head azimuth, producing noticeably unclear high tones, just as if the head itself were out of alignment.|$|E
40|$|International audienceThin {{steel discs}} {{can be used}} to make {{circular}} saw plates. The process of roll-tensioning is traditionally used to increase the stability of rotating discs at high rotation speed, and so dynamic properties and critical speed, which determines the maximum stable rotation speed of the disc. Roll-tensioning consists in introducing a residual stress state in the plate. The structure is locally deformed between two opposite <b>pinch</b> <b>rollers</b> in rotation which rotate the plate. This creates a plastic deformation along a circular zone at constant radius. Manufacturers are generally able to roll tension acceptably through know-how gained from experience. However, this is done, very often, without any scientific knowledge. In parallel, many efficient theories have been developed by several scientists to explain the dynamic phenomena which occur. Our principal target in this paper is to expose how we developed a reliable method to determine the critical speed in connection with the roll-tensioning process applied to the structure. This method is to allow the quantification of roll tensioning during the production process, in industrial situation...|$|R
50|$|Silver stain is {{a common}} problem in roller {{transporter}} processors, since the material (usually paper) is <b>pinched</b> between squeegee <b>rollers</b> to remove excess developer and brought into the fixing bath without intermediate rinse or stop. Developers for such applications usually contain an antistaining agent, usually soluble organic thiols that form soluble but non-reactive silver compounds with free silver ions.|$|R
50|$|The {{realized}} films had 300 to 700 transparent {{pictures of}} successive phases of moving figures with black backgrounds. The pictures were hand painted by Reynaud in aniline inks directly on 6 x 6 cm gelatin plates. The plates were coated with shellac and framed {{in a cardboard}} strip of which the sides were clad in fabric bands attached with split pins. The horizontal film strip could be up to 50 meters long, with black leader tape at the beginning. Central perforations in the cardboard between the images engaged with metal notches protruding from a large central turning wheel. The wheel transferred the strip between two copper 25 cm spools. The film was guided further by <b>pinch</b> <b>rollers</b> {{at the corners of}} the table and passed in front of a magic lantern. The magic lantern projected each image in turn towards one of the 36 rectangular mirrors {{at the center of the}} turning wheel. Each image was in turn reflected to another mirror, which reflected it through a focusing lens towards a movable mirror. The movable mirror could be adjusted to project the moving characters at the desired place within an immobile background image on the screen. The background was projected with a second magic lantern from a painted glass plate. Reynaud would manipulate the speed of the film by hand and repeat movements to produce a visual story that could last longer than 10 minutes. The projectionist operated the machine behind the screen, with only the projection visible to the audience.|$|R
50|$|The {{tape was}} {{coated with a}} {{slippery}} backing material patented by Cousino, usually graphite, to ease the continuous slip between the tape layers. This coating sometimes also caused the <b>pinch</b> <b>roller</b> to slip, leading to poor speed control and tape flutter. Due to these problems, 4-track cartridges were never popular with audiophiles. While the design allowed simple and cheap players, unlike a two-reel system it didn't permit winding of the tape in either direction. Some players offered a limited fast-forward by speeding up the motor while cutting off the audio but rewinding was impossible.|$|E
5000|$|After {{taking a}} ride with Muntz in a 4-track player-outfitted car, Bill Lear, maker of the Lear Jet, {{modified}} the 4-track technology to create the Stereo 8 cartridge, widely known as the 8-track. Most notably, eight tracks were squeezed onto the same ¼" [...] tape, reducing potential audio quality, but allowing twice as much music to be put onto the same length of tape. The <b>pinch</b> <b>roller</b> was also {{an integral part of}} the 8-track cartridge, although many early rubber rollers would suffer from deterioration because the rubber had not been fully cured. Once this was discovered, all later rubber pinch rollers were [...] "fully cured" [...] (hard) rubber, or plastic rollers (introduced by RCA in 1970) were used instead. Thanks to his connection to Motorola, which made radios for Ford Motors cars, Lear was able to ensure that 8-track players would be included in many Ford cars, and they became popular mainly during the early- to mid-1970s. 4-track tapes gradually faded away and were gone by late 1970, as most people switched to 8-tracks, although players compatible with both 4-track and 8-track tapes were sometimes made. Inexpensive adapters were available that permitted 4-track tapes to be played in 8-track players. The adapter was a rubber <b>pinch</b> <b>roller</b> attached to a small metal plate that would clip into the opening in the 4-track cartridge. 4-track tapes are still in-demand by collectors.|$|E
50|$|When EIAJ-1 was standardized, no Videocassette {{recorders}} had {{yet been}} introduced. One {{of the main}} drawbacks to the format was the need to carefully thread {{the end of the}} tape around the head drum, through a gap between the capstan and <b>pinch</b> <b>roller,</b> and around a variety of guides and tensioners. If the user made any errors in doing this, the machine would malfunction and the tape could become damaged. So, another version, EIAJ-2, was released later on that used a single-reel cartridge (with the take-up reel being built into the VTR) instead of an open take up reel. Otherwise, the recording specifications were exactly the same.|$|E

It was much less expensive than the previous flatbed design. It was very heavy but had 4 pens. The HP 7475 used a rotating carousel with six pens. That plotter was used in greeting card kiosks. This design was also scaled up for very large pen plotters. These were driven by the HP-GL plotter language which used ASCII commands such as PA 300, 4500;PD; ...|$|E
5000|$|In later years, an [...] "auto reverse" [...] feature {{appeared}} {{that allowed the}} deck to play (and, in some decks, record) {{on both sides of}} the cassette without the operator having to manually remove, flip, and re-insert the cassette. Most auto-reverse machines use a four channel head (similar to those on multitrack recorders), with only two channels connected to the electronics at one time, one pair for each direction. Auto-reverse decks employ a capstan and <b>pinch</b> <b>roller</b> for each side. Since these use the same opening in the cassette shell normally used for the erase head, such decks must fit the erase head (or two, one for each direction) into the center opening in the shell along with the record/play head.|$|E
50|$|A typical 9-track unit {{consisted}} of a tape transport—essentially all the mechanics that moved tape from reel to reel past the read/write and erase heads—and supporting control and data read/write electronics. The transport typically {{consisted of}} supply motor, take-up motor, hubs for locking the tape reels in place, a capstan motor (though not necessarily a <b>pinch</b> <b>roller,</b> see below), tape head assembly, miscellaneous rollers which kept the tape in a precise path during operation, and vacuum columns which prevented tape 'snatch'. Data could become corrupted by stretched tape or variations in tape speed, so the transport had to guide the tape through without damaging its edges, move it with minimal wow and flutter, {{and give it a}} tension that was low but sufficient to keep the tape in constant contact with the read/write head.|$|E
