5|$|Callisto's surface can {{be divided}} into several geologically {{different}} parts: cratered <b>plains,</b> light <b>plains,</b> bright and dark smooth <b>plains,</b> and various units associated with particular multi-ring structures and impact craters. The cratered <b>plains</b> constitute most of the surface area and represent the ancient lithosphere, a mixture of ice and rocky material. The light <b>plains</b> include bright impact craters like Burr and Lofn, as well as the effaced remnants of old large craters called palimpsests, the central parts of multi-ring structures, and isolated patches in the cratered <b>plains.</b> These light <b>plains</b> are thought to be icy impact deposits. The bright, smooth <b>plains</b> constitute a small fraction of Callisto's surface and are found in the ridge and trough zones of the Valhalla and Asgard formations and as isolated spots in the cratered <b>plains.</b> They were thought to be connected with endogenic activity, but the high-resolution Galileo images showed that the bright, smooth <b>plains</b> correlate with heavily fractured and knobby terrain and do not show any signs of resurfacing. The Galileo images also revealed small, dark, smooth areas with overall coverage less than 10,000km2, which appear to embay the surrounding terrain. They are possible cryovolcanic deposits. Both the light and the various smooth <b>plains</b> are somewhat younger and less cratered than the background cratered <b>plains.</b>|$|E
5|$|Once White <b>Plains</b> {{became the}} county seat of Westchester in 1759, the road between this village {{and the city of}} New York (then {{encompassing}} only Manhattan) became an important route and was established as the White <b>Plains</b> Post Road. Before 1797, the main road heading to points north and east out of Manhattan went via Kingsbridge along the old Boston Post Road. A new bridge over the Harlem River (the original Harlem Bridge) was opened in 1797, shortening the route out of Manhattan. This also relocated the Boston and White <b>Plains</b> Post roads to a new alignment along Third Avenue and Boston Road. The White <b>Plains</b> Post Road separated from the Boston Post Road in Bronxdale, with the road to Boston heading east and the road to White <b>Plains</b> heading north. The old White <b>Plains</b> Post Road roughly followed the alignment of modern-day White <b>Plains</b> Road, which was laid out in 1863. (The original post road was to the east of the modern-day avenue). The White <b>Plains</b> Post Road continued north through Olinville, Wakefield, and Mount Vernon, where the route shifted east to modern-day White <b>Plains</b> Post Road, going through Bronxville and Scarsdale to White <b>Plains.</b>|$|E

5|$|Horses, {{originally}} {{acquired from}} Spanish New Mexico, spread widely via native trade networks, reaching the Shoshone of the Snake River Plain by 1700. The Nez Perce, Cayuse, and Flathead people acquired their first horses around 1730. Along with horses came {{aspects of the}} emerging <b>plains</b> culture, such as equestrian and horse training skills, greatly increased mobility, hunting efficiency, trade over long distances, intensified warfare, the linking of wealth and prestige to horses and war, {{and the rise of}} large and powerful tribal confederacies. The Nez Perce and Cayuse kept large herds and made annual long-distance trips to the Great <b>Plains</b> for bison hunting, adopted the <b>plains</b> culture to a significant degree, and became the main conduit through which horses and the <b>plains</b> culture diffused into the Columbia River region. Other peoples acquired horses and aspects of the <b>plains</b> culture unevenly. The Yakama, Umatilla, Palus, Spokane, and Coeur d'Alene maintained sizable herds of horses and adopted some of the <b>plains</b> cultural characteristics, but fishing and fish-related economies remained important. Less affected groups included the Molala, Klickitat, Wenatchi, Okanagan, and Sinkiuse-Columbia peoples, who owned small numbers of horses and adopted few <b>plains</b> culture features. Some groups remained essentially unaffected, such as the Sanpoil and Nespelem people, whose culture remained centered on fishing.|$|E
5|$|Later {{morphological}} studies came to conflicting conclusions. A 1999 {{analysis of}} cranial measurements {{found that the}} quagga was as different from the <b>plains</b> zebra as the latter is from the mountain zebra. A 2004 study of skins and skulls instead suggested that the quagga was not a distinct species, but a subspecies of the <b>plains</b> zebra. In spite of these findings, many authors subsequently kept the <b>plains</b> zebra and the quagga as separate species.|$|E

5|$|The East <b>Plains</b> Trail {{followed}} the older routes of the West <b>Plains</b> Trail from Pembina to Breckenridge, Minnesota, then struck east {{by a variety}} of routes out of the Red River Valley across the upper valleys of the Pomme de Terre and Chippewa Rivers (tributaries of the Minnesota River), to Saint Cloud and Sauk Rapids on the Upper Mississippi. Soon however, a branch was added to connect the East <b>Plains</b> Trail with the Woods Trail. This link skirted the west slope of the Leaf Mountains and joined the East <b>Plains</b> routes at Elbow Lake or near the Otter Tail River. At times, this eastern connection may have been the better-travelled of the two variants.|$|E
50|$|The Punjab <b>Plain</b> {{is a large}} {{alluvial}} <b>plain</b> in Pakistan and the north-west of India.

5000|$|In 1972, the <b>Plain</b> Language Movement {{received}} practical political application, when President Richard Nixon {{decreed that}} the [...] "Federal Register {{be written in}} layman's terms". On March 23, 1978, U.S. President Jimmy Carter signed Executive Order 12044, which said that federal officials must see that each regulation is [...] "written in <b>plain</b> English and understandable to those who must comply with it". President Ronald Reagan rescinded these orders in 1981, but many political agencies continued to follow them. By 1991, eight states had also passed legislation related to <b>plain</b> language. <b>Plain</b> Language Association International (<b>PLAIN)</b> was formed in 1993 as the <b>Plain</b> Language Network. Its membership is international; it was incorporated as a non-profit organization in Canada in 2008. In June 1998, President Bill Clinton issued a memorandum that called for executive departments and agencies to use <b>plain</b> language in all government documents.

50|$|The Erie <b>Plain</b> begins {{just east}} of Auburn, New York, where the Onondaga Escarpment meets the Portage Escarpment. The Onondaga Escarpment sharply distinguishes the Erie <b>Plain</b> from the Huron <b>Plain</b> east of Buffalo. But along the {{southern}} side of Lake Erie west of Buffalo, the Onondaga Escarpment is so slight that the Huron <b>Plain</b> and Erie <b>Plain</b> are essentially the same. At Buffalo, the <b>plain</b> narrows to just 2 to 3 mi wide as the Portage Escarpment moves closer to the Lake Erie shoreline, and remains 2 to 4 mi wide in Erie County, Pennsylvania. From Erie, Pennsylvania, to Cleveland, the <b>plain</b> broadens to about 4 to 6 mi and is starkly defined by the Portage Escarpment, which rises in three terraces. The <b>plain</b> remains narrow until just west of Cleveland, where the Portage Escarpment moves to the south, and the definition between the <b>plain</b> and escarpment becomes much less distinct. The escarpment is broken in two places by the valleys of the Great Miami and Scioto rivers. The <b>plain</b> expands to 4 to 5 mi between the Cuyahoga River and the Rocky River, and to 17 mi west of the Rocky River around the southwest and western sides of Lake Erie. All told, the Erie <b>Plain</b> covers about one-fourth {{of the state of}} Ohio. The Erie <b>Plain</b> extends into Michigan where the Marshall Escarpment forms the inland boundary between the Erie <b>Plain</b> and the interior uplands. The Erie <b>Plain</b> also covers most of the Southern Ontario peninsula between Lake Erie and Lake Huron.

5|$|The {{park and}} the Athi-Kapiti <b>Plains</b> are linked by the migrations of wild {{herbivore}} populations. The <b>plains</b> {{to the south of}} the park are important feeding areas during the wet season. Before the city was established, herds of animals followed the rains and moved across the <b>plains</b> from Mount Kilimanjaro to Mount Kenya, a migration as great as the migration that takes place on the Serengeti. However, as the city grew the park became the northernmost limit of the animal's migration. Migrating animals can reach their southern pastures by travelling through the part of the Athi <b>plains</b> called the Kitengela. This land is very important to their migration routes, but growth in the human population and the accompanying need for land threaten to cut off this traditional migration route from the park to land further south. The park's migratory species are also threatened by changing settlement patterns, fencing, and their closeness to Nairobi and other industrial towns. These activities fragment their ecosystems and occupy their habitat.|$|E
