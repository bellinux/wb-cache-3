25|$|In 1872 German railway {{engineer}} Wilhelm von <b>Pressel</b> was {{retained by}} the Ottoman government to develop plans for railways in Turkey. However, private enterprise would not build the railway without subsidies, so the Ottoman Government had to reserve {{part of its}} revenues to subsidise its construction, thus increasing its debt to the European powers.|$|E
25|$|When Wie turned {{professional}}, {{she was not}} {{a member}} of any professional tour. LPGA Tour membership age requirements require a golfer to be 18, although some players such as Morgan <b>Pressel</b> and Aree Song have successfully petitioned for an exemption to join at age 17. Wie chose not to request an exemption and was thus only allowed to participate in a limited number of LPGA Tour events when given a sponsor's exemption from 2005 until 2008.|$|E

50|$|Muñoz notched {{her first}} LPGA Tour {{victory at the}} Sybase Match Play Championship in Gladstone, New Jersey with a 2 and 1 victory over Candie Kung. In the {{semifinal}} round of match play against Morgan <b>Pressel,</b> Muñoz trailed by two through 11 holes. <b>Pressel</b> appeared to have won the 12th hole, which would have given her a three-hole lead over Muñoz, but a slow-play penalty was ruled against <b>Pressel.</b> Muñoz ended up winning the semifinal match against <b>Pressel,</b> 2 and 1. The victory in May vaulted Muñoz from 27th to 19th in the world rankings and from tenth to second on the 2012 money list.|$|E
50|$|In 2005, <b>Pressel</b> won the North and South Women's Amateur at Pinehurst, and {{the most}} {{important}} amateur event, the U.S. Women's Amateur. <b>Pressel</b> also finished her amateur career as 2005 Girls Rolex Junior Player of the Year.|$|E
5000|$|In {{his short}} story [...] "Im Presselschen Gartenhaus" [...] ("In <b>Pressel’s</b> Garden-house", 1913), Hermann Hesse gives a {{touching}} {{picture of a}} visit to Hölderlin by Waiblinger and the poet Eduard Mörike, both young theology students in Tübingen, like Hölderlin himself decades before.|$|R
5000|$|Hölderlin {{moved into}} {{the first floor of}} Zimmer's {{residence}} the day after his release and lived there until his death in 1843. During Hölderlin's tower period, he often wrote under the pseudonym Scardanelli. He also received visitors from the neighboring Tübinger Stift, the school Hölderlin himself had once attended. A visit to the ill Hölderlin by Eduard Mörike and Wilhelm Waiblinger, figures both known for their relationship to Hölderlin, is documented by Hermann Hesse in his 1914 short story [...] "Im Presselschen Gartenhaus" [...] ("In <b>Pressel's</b> Garden-House").|$|R

50|$|Although the Ottoman government, the Porte, was financially {{unable to}} build what {{would later be}} the Baghdad Railway, <b>Pressel</b> succeeded in {{building}} Turkey's first railroad, which connected Istanbul to Izmit on the Marmara Sea. <b>Pressel</b> made it his goal to improve the antiquated methods of transportation available in the Ottoman Empire. However, the Porte declared bankruptcy in 1875, hindering his plans. In the late 1870s, <b>Pressel</b> succeeded in convincing Sultan Abdul Hamid II that the Baghdad Railway needed to be built. The sultan's concession was, in part, to improve morale after the crushing defeat by the Russians in 1877-78.|$|E

5000|$|At this time, <b>Pressel</b> {{endeavored}} {{to learn more}} about the culture of the Turks; rumors abounded of torture and barbarism, especially toward Ottoman Christians, a minority. He found these rumors to be true; the perpetrators of various crimes against the Christians were often government officials, so their plight seemingly had no end. As <b>Pressel</b> continued to learn about the Turks, he disliked Turkish officials more and more. The majority of Turks [...] "were honest and brave and treated their fellow Christian citizens 'with mildness and friendliness.'" [...] On the other hand, Turkish officials were caught between the modern and traditional, hypocritical, and soon came to disgust <b>Pressel.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Between 1883 and 1887, <b>Pressel</b> had {{accumulated}} enough capital {{to support the}} railroad, but the sultan rejected it because the capital came from too many sources. Soon, though, <b>Pressel</b> met Alfred von Kaulla, {{the director of the}} private Wurttemburger Vereinsbank, who introduced him to Georg von Siemens, director of the Deutsche Bank. Although Bismarck officially rejected the [...] "Pressel Project" [...] on behalf of the German government (although he personally approved of it), Kaulla and Siemens submitted their own bid to the sultan, who accepted.Pressel, though, felt that he had been betrayed and shunted off when Kaulla and Siemens took over; Siemens in particular hated <b>Pressel</b> for his humanitarian nature.|$|E
5000|$|Of European {{powers that}} {{included}} Britain and France, Germany provided {{the most significant}} foreign aid to the Ottoman Empire in its state of 19th and 20th century decline. <b>Pressel</b> and Colmar Freiherr von der Goltz, a military adviser, were the leaders of initiating contact to raise funds. They went as ambassadors to Istanbul {{in order to promote}} Turco-German collaboration. <b>Pressel</b> and Goltz spent time touring the country and learning its customs; after this, they made the Railway their top priority, believing that improving the state of the Turkish people would benefit both the Ottoman Empire and Germany. In 1871, <b>Pressel</b> was appointed director of the new Asian Ottoman Railway Company.|$|E
50|$|On April 26, 2015, <b>Pressel</b> came {{in second}} at the Swinging Skirts LPGA Classic in San Francisco.

50|$|In the 2012 Sybase Match Play Championship, <b>Pressel</b> was in {{contention}} for her third LPGA Tour {{victory in the}} semi-finals when she was 2 up after 11 holes to opponent Azahara Muñoz. <b>Pressel</b> won the 12th hole but a slow play penalty resulted {{in the loss of}} the hole instead.

Her second-place finish gave her a share of the low amateur honors with Brittany Lang. <b>Pressel</b> played in a total of seven LPGA events in 2005 and made the cut in all of them, with an impressive scoring average of 70.96 in 28 rounds.|$|E

5000|$|At this time, <b>Pressel</b> {{pressured}} both Berlin and Istanbul to get {{the railway}} project off the ground, even going to would-be financiers praising [...] "the richness of Anatolia". While many Europeans thought the Turks lazy, <b>Pressel</b> argued that their lack of productivity stemmed from lack of external transport, thus no outside market for goods. The railway would increase productivity by allowing Anatolian farmers to increase their harvest and export some of it.|$|E
