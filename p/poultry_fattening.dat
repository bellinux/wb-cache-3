As a result, income obtained from the selling of wood and wood products declined. In the same way, following the introduction of rice farming in the watershed the largest portion of wetlands has changed into agricultural land; due to this the common papyrus grass used by women for the making of household utensils both for their own use {{as well as a}} source of income disappeared from the area. As a result, people of the watershed who were previously engaged in selling of fire wood and charcoal, basketry work as well as crop production slowly changing their livelihood to daily labourer and in some cases to off-farm activities such as <b>poultry,</b> <b>fattening</b> of animals and selling of local drinks.|$|E
40|$|Poultry {{houses are}} {{generally}} considered to be a major source emitting various particles to the en-vironment, which greatly depends on the technol-ogy of animal keeping and housing. Besides other contaminants, dust and endotoxins are present in high concentrations in the air of poultry houses. Dust concentrations in broiler facilities range from 2 to 10 mg/m 3 (Wathes et al., 1997). Investigating the mean daily airborne dust concentrations in vari-ous animal houses in England and Netherlands, Takai et al.

40|$|The {{additive}} AGal-Pro, {{also named}} as Biogalactosidase BL and AlphaGal BL, is a preparation of alpha-galactosidase (galactosidase) {{produced by a}} genetically modified strain of Saccharomyces cerevisiae and of endo- 1, 4 -beta-glucanase (glucanase) produced by a non-genetically modified strain of Aspergillus niger. This product is authorised for use in chickens for fattening as a zootechnical additive, functional group of digestibility enhancers. The applicant seeks for {{the extension of the}} use of the additive to chickens reared for laying and to minor <b>poultry</b> species for <b>fattening</b> at a dose range of 50 to 100 alpha-galactosidase units and of 285 to 570 glucanase units per kg feed (corresponding to 50 to 100 mg additive/kg feed). In a previous evaluation the additive was shown to be safe in chickens for fattening at a dose of 100 galactosidase and 570 glucanase units per kg feed. The FEEDAP Panel considers that this conclusion can be extended to chickens reared for laying. Given the margin of safety established for the major species, these conclusions can be extrapolated to minor <b>poultry</b> species for <b>fattening.</b> The potential of the product to be efficacious when used in chickens for fattening was previously established at the dose of  50 U galactosidase and 285 U glucanase per kg feed. The FEEDAP Panel considers that this conclusion applies to chickens reared for laying. Since the mode of action of the galactosidase and glucanase can be reasonably assumed to be the same in all poultry species the conclusion on efficacy in chickens for fattening can be extrapolated to include the minor <b>poultry</b> species for <b>fattening...</b>|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to estimate the investment efficiency of the specialized agricultural projects considering different dimensions. These dimensions include: capital turnover, pay back period, return to investment, production safety ratio and price safety ratio. Data have been obtained from unpublished technical and economic feasibility studies recorded at the Saudi Arabian Agricultural Bank. Cross-section data covering the period 1982 / 1986 for 176 projects or about 20 % of the total specialized agricultural projects in the Kingdom has been utilized to represent the majority of the specialized agricultural projects in the Kingdom. Due to the non-availability of actual data on the productivities of projects, the average pay back ratio of every kind of projects was used as a base to calculate the criteria of investment efficiency. It is concluded that according to the return of capita, milk projects rank first among other activities practiced in the Kingdom. Broiler, wheat production, layers production, Iamb fattening, Iamb breeding and vegetable production in green houses all followed milk projects. The ranking was not the same for the financed agricultural projects till 1987.

40|$|Only {{two years}} after the great {{expansion}} of "AGROŽIV" company, it was evident that mycotoxins have great impact on all segments of poultry production. During that year we were for the first time faced up with problems in <b>poultry</b> <b>fattening.</b> It was not possible to explain the present problems only by bacterial and viral infections, so we assumed that there is another reason for the observed clinical picture. From that time we started to pay more attention on contamination of poultry feed with mycotoxins. In the four years' period, from 1988 to 2002, 57 samples were analyzed for the presence of mycotoxins. Mycotoxicological investigations revealed the presence of T- 2 toxin in 19 samples at concentrations less than 0. 3 mg/kg, in 18 samples at concentration of 0. 5 mg/kg, and in 3 samples 1. 0 mg/kg. Beside this, type A trichotecene DAS was found in 6 of tested samples, and ochratoxin A and in 1 sample. Clinical picture and damages varied depending on mycotoxins' concentrations and poultry age. To exceede this problem in animal production we tried to use the organic and anorganic mycotoxin adsorbents as additives of poultry feed, but the results were not satisfactory enough. So, we resumed that if we really want to resolve problem of mycotoxins we have to start from the field production of poultry feed components...|$|E
40|$|According to Chapter 1 oft the GlHV, dated December 3 rd, 1997 feedlots of <b>Poultry</b> <b>fattening</b> are {{required}} to collect Data from the housing conditions of the animals. Taking these fattening data into consideration during official veterinarian Examinations is designed to getting the best possible Information about the flock. Results of the ante mortem examination are to be examined or explained by its origination, {{to be able to}} determine the general health condition of a herd. This Research was done with the goal of tracing possible causes of Fibrinous Serositis, by taking into consideration the Information of the flock of origin as well as the corresponding data at slaughter. In Course of the Study, 48. 000 male Turkeys of the meat hybrids BIG- 6 were observed regularly every four weeks during the fattening and afterwards from the meat inspection. The 10 chosen Turkey feedlots were split into two groups due to occurred cases of Fibrinous Serositis to date. The Living Turkeys were monitored with an examination sheet, which was divided into three sections, called the farm record. In Terms of the operating data, the data of the management and other factors including a clinical examination, there were differences between the herds of Group 1 and Group 2 regarding Stables (Size, etc.) Caretakers, Hygiene (change of clothes, Desinfection, Cleanliness of feeding tins), time between fattening periods, control measure of Alphitobius diaperinus, Concentration of Ammonia in the air, number of animals that died in the fattening and weight of the individual animals. Often it was just one flock that tipped the scale and made the difference to the other group. During the meat inspection, the differences between the surveyed Herds were able to be determined. Differences were found during the following parameters: - Number of animals that died in the fattening - Carcasses unfit for human consumption - Percentage of the carcasses which are unfit in respect to the number of Animals in the origin flock - Percentage of Turkeys displaying Fibrinous Serositis - Number of the Animals with breast blisters The selection that was made in respect to the Fibrinous Serositis was maintained. Summing up the husbandry conditions and taking into consideration the determined code, there is an explicit difference between the two groups. Group 1 has much better results to Fibrinous Serositis than Group 2. Two feedlots whose results differed severely were compared to determine the differences. The following differences were determined, and they should, if necessary, be examined further in future investigations: - distance of Stable to cadaver place - habits of clothes - changing of the caretakers - cleanliness of feeding tins - stocking density This leads to the conclusion, that the meat inspection do confirm the circumstances of fattening. This makes clear, that the Hygienic circumstances of the keeping of the animals is influential. If the abattoir files too many negative reports, an intervention is recommended and regarded helpful. Due to the differences between the groups, it is possible to give parameters, that could be seen as ways to determine the origins of Fibrinous Serositis. The following points are of special interest, taking into consideration the parameters that have shown differences between the two groups: - human caretaking - Hygiene - Time between fattening periods - (Concentration of Ammonia in the air) - Number of animals that died in the fattening It was found out, that the smallest possible differences can "open a window", or cause the spreading of facultative pathogenic micro-organism. The Studies have shown, that the general standard of Hygiene alone cannot be held responsible for Fibrinous Serositis, but that bad hygienic circumstances are perhaps beneficial to the origins of the disease. <br...|$|E

40|$|In December 2010, a {{contamination}} of vegetable oils for animal feed {{was found in}} the federal German state of Schleswig-Holstein. Industrial fatty acids with high dioxin concentrations were mixed in with vegetable oils for animal feed and then used for feed production. Con-taminated feed was distributed to various <b>poultry</b> and pig <b>fattening</b> farms as well as laying hen and milk production farms and fed to animals. The control authorities of the Federal States have analysed the dioxin concentrations of meat, egg and milk samples from the farms in question. Only few samples of pork, meat of laying hens and eggs contained dioxin concentrations that exceed the maximum levels per-mitted by the European Union. In milk and meat of <b>fattening</b> <b>poultry</b> maximum levels were not exceeded. Based on its risk assessment, BfR concludes that neither acute nor long-term adverse health effects are expected for consumers even if eggs or pork with the highest measured concentrations are consumed {{over an extended period of}} time. In regard to dioxin, it is not the daily intake of dioxin that is critical for its effects on human health, but rather the amount present in the human body – the body burden. Dioxins accu-mulate in the human body over time. As a result of background exposure, every human be-ing takes in traces of dioxins through foods on a daily basis. Due to the fact that in recent decades the primary sources of dioxins in the environment were eliminated, the dioxin con-tamination of food has decreased considerably. Official controls in food and feed in regard to compliance with maximum levels are carried out on a regular basis. Information gained by the results of the official controls provides options and strategies for a reduction of the human dioxin body burden by identification and elimina-tion of the source of contamination...|$|R

Coast-cross fodder, kikuyu grass, and stylosanthes were planted in 33 -m 2 paddocks with two densities (m 2 /animal) : D 1 = 3 m 2 /animal and D 2 = 1 m 2 /animal. The design was a randomized complete block with a 3 x 2 factorial (three grasses and two densities) and three replications. Grass canopy height, grass mass, morphological composition (leaf, stem, and dead material), losses due to grazing, poultry weight gain and consumption, and concentrate {{feed conversion ratio}} and efficiency were evaluated. At {{the end of the}} experiment, forage and leaves masses were considered low to stylosanthes in D 2 (0. 28 to 0. 03 kg/m 2) and to kikuyu grass in D 1 (0. 13 to 0. 05 kg/m 2) and in D 2 (0. 11 and 0. 03 kg/m 2), respectively. In addition, the grass canopy height was considered low for stylosanthes (6. 50 cm) that could jeopardize the entry of new poultry lot. The three grass species had similar weight gain and revealed better results for 3 m²/ chicken (3. 20 kg/animal).

(1945) found 3, 4 dianisylhexene- 3 to be more efficient for <b>fattening</b> <b>poultry</b> than diethylstilbestrol when fed orally. Levels of 40 to 50 mgs. of dianisylhexene per pound of feed, fed for a 3 to 4 week fattening period, did not appear to affect growth rate but body fat was increased. Improvement in the market quality of birds was noted by Sykes et al. (1945) when the birds were fed diethylstilbestrol up to 12 weeks of age. No consistent dif-ference in feed consumption or feed utili-zation of the lots was reported by these workers. Glazener and Jull (1946) have shown that diethylstilbestrol fed for a three-week period improved dressing ap-pearance and rate of gain in male birds. Lorenz (1945 a) reported that subcu-taneous implantation of diethylstilbestrol pellets did not markedly affect growth but increased fat deposition. The feeding of diethylstilbestrol had no effect on the birds.

30|$|Commercial maize {{has lost}} its ability to release single kernels from the cob. Hence, single-maize kernels are rare in fields and {{spillage}} of them probably mainly traces back to seeding and harvest activities of farmers. Additional factors such as storm damage, poor stalk quality, insect damage and plant diseases can lead to kernel and ear losses which might result in volunteer maize {{in the following year}} [16]. Maize kernels are used as feed stuff for pigs, <b>poultry</b> or cattle <b>fattening.</b> Left overs reach the manure and in this way are dispersed into the environment during fertilisation. Feeding of game (e.g. wild boars) by hunters or fowl kept in an animal husbandry could be another source for the entry of single-maize kernels into semi-natural and natural habitats. For better feeding, the cobs are threshed into single components. This was probably also the case at the sampling site “Zitzmannsdorfer Wiesen”. No maize field was present in the surroundings of this ruderal habitat in the year of observation. Hence, {{it is likely that the}} feral plants originated from maize kernels used for game-feeding. Hunters sometimes cultivate fields for game browsing and protection against enemies. Single-maize plants are also part of this animal feed stuff. In a study in Korea [21], imported maize kernels were found to be usually processed and mixed with other components in the animal feed manufacturing plants, and finally consumed in the livestock barns.|$|R
40|$|Hostazym C is {{an enzyme}} {{preparation}} of endo- 1, 4 -beta-glucanase {{produced by a}} non-genetically modified strain of Trichoderma citrinoviride. The results of an in vitro chromosomal aberration test and of an in vivo comet assay indicate the presence of genotoxic activity in the product. The tolerance studies provided in target species did not indicate any adverse effect of the additive. However, due to the genotoxic hazard from the product, the FEEDAP Panel cannot conclude on {{the safety of the}} additive for the target species. The results obtained in a repeated-dose oral toxicity study did not indicate any concern for consumer safety. However, the identity and fate of the substance causing the genotoxic effect is unknown; therefore, the source of the risk to the consumer cannot be established. Thus, the FEEDAP Panel cannot conclude on the safety of the additive for the consumer. The product should be considered a potential skin and eye irritant, and a potential skin and respiratory sensitiser. Due to the presence of genotoxic activity in the product, any level of exposure to the additive by any route is considered hazardous. No risks to the environment are expected to result from the use of the additive in feed, and, therefore, no further environmental risk assessment is required. Based on the results obtained in the efficacy studies, the FEEDAP Panel concludes that the additive {{has the potential to be}} efficacious in chickens for fattening at a dose of 500 CU/kg feed and in weaned piglets at 350 CU/kg. Conclusions on the efficacy can be extrapolated to minor <b>poultry</b> species for <b>fattening...</b>|$|R
40|$|Over the years, Utah {{has enjoyed}} the {{advantage}} of having natural agricultural resources that favor the production of livestock. Sheep and beef cattle do well on the desert and high mountain ranges that cover much of the state, Dairy cattle and wintering beef cattle use the alfalfa and native hay along with some corn silage that is grown in the irrigated valleys. Feed grains are grown in rotation with forage crops on irrigated land and also on dry land. Before 1950, the quantities of feed grains produced had been sufficient {{to meet the needs}} of dairy, range livestock and poultry. However, with the realization that Utah had a natural market position in relation to the coast markets, there developed an extensive <b>poultry</b> and livestock <b>fattening</b> business.

40|$|Livestock {{production}} in Ethiopia has, for long, remained subsistence with limited market-orientation and poor institutional support. Farmers and pastoralists produce and keep animals for various valid reasons, with little market-orientation. However, producing {{for the market}} requires re-orientation of the production system and development of a knowledge based and responsive institutional support services. Institutional support services of extension, research, input supply, rural finance and marketing are key areas of intervention that can {{play a central role}} in the transformation of subsistence mode of {{production in}}. to market orientation. Livestock production systems in Ethiopia can be broadly categorized into crop-livestock mixed systems, pastoral and agro-pastoral system, urban and peri-urban production systems. The demand for institutional support services for livestock development in these production systems vary significantly. The way extension system is structured in Ethiopia may not be in the best interest of farmers and pastoralists and lacks the responsive capacity to the demands for livestock services. In fact, most often livestock development issues are left to development projects and NGOs that have limited scope, coverage and duration. The major inputs for livestock development include animal genetic resources, feeds and forages, veterinary drugs, vaccines, machinery equipment and utensils as well as knowledge. The experience so far has been the supply of improved (exotic?) animal genetic resources for dairy development, sheep production (meat and wool), improved poultry (broiler and egg production), supply of bee colonies, provision of forage seeds and planting material, dairy goats, provision of processing equipment and utensil (dairy, apiculture), drug supply and vaccination services. Most of these activities have been mainly supplied, by the government or government sponsored projects. Limited credit facilities to support livestock asset accumulation and development have been provided by microfinance institutions, food security projects, small-scale micro enterprises and NGOs. The contribution of the private sector in livestock input has been limited to supplies of veterinary drugs and services, roughage and concentrate feeds, and processing equipment and utensils. Recent trends show that there is an encouraging move to involve the private sector in input supplies such as production of beehives. Due to the recent increase demand for live animals and animal products in the domestic and export markets, there has been a renewed interest to promote market-oriented livestock production. As a result, a lot of interventions are happening to engage farmers and pastoralists in a more market-oriented livestock production in areas where the resources offer the opportunities. For example, a lot of activities are happening in apiculture production, small ruminants breeding and <b>fattening,</b> cattle <b>fattening,</b> <b>poultry</b> production and dairy production. Institutions such as microfinance, small-scale and micro enterprises, NGOs, women affairs office are involved in these activities with limited engagement of the Office of Agriculture and Rural Development at Woreda levels. The demand for input supply, particularly for improved animal genetic resources has increased substantially with poor response of the supply side. There is a gap in coordination of efforts and in basing livestock development interventions on scientific knowledge with the value chain in mind. The extension system has to be able to respond to the increasing demand for improved and market-oriented livestock development if farmers, pastoralists and the private commercial producers are to benefit themselves and contribute to the development of the national economy.
