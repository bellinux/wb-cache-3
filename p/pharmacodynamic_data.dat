5000|$|The {{main goal}} of a dose-ranging study is to {{estimate}} the response vs. dose given, so as to analyze the efficacy and safety of the drug. Although such a response will nevertheless be available from phase III or phase IV trials, {{it is important to}} carry out dose-ranging studies in the earlier phase I or phase II stages. There are some advantages by using healthy volunteers. They are in a steady-state condition showing no different stages of disease and no variation due to disease. In addition, it is easy to recruit and select volunteers among varying age, sex, race etc. under identical conditions in which the test can be repeated. The main reasons for this is to avoid trials in the later phases using doses that are significantly different from those that will subsequently be recommended for clinical use and also to avoid the need for modification of dosing schedules at later stages where a large amount of data has already been accumulated for a different dose range.The duration of action should be determined during dose-ranging study, as it will allow definition of the dosage schedule. Because it is hard to measure reliable pharmacodynamic parameter, {{it is difficult to determine}} the duration of action during early clinical trials. Other parameters instead are suggested as a tentative dosage, such as half-lives in plasma and urine in various test species and human, receptor binding in vitro, or <b>pharmacodynamic</b> <b>data</b> in vivo in animals.|$|E

Yet thus far, the cytokine has yielded only partial responses in solid cancer patients, and conditions for beneficial IL- 21 immunotherapy remain elusive. The current work aims to identify clinically-relevant IL- 21 regimens with enhanced efficacy, based on mathematical modeling of long-term antitumor responses. For this purpose, pharmacokinetic (PK) and <b>pharmacodynamic</b> (PD) <b>data</b> were acquired from a preclinical study applying systemic IL- 21 therapy in murine solid cancers. We developed an integrated disease/PK/PD model for the IL- 21 anticancer response, and calibrated it using selected "training" data. The accuracy of the model was verified retrospectively under diverse IL- 21 treatment settings, by comparing its predictions to independent "validation" data in melanoma and renal cell carcinoma-challenged mice (R(2) > 0. 90). Simulations of the verified model surfaced important therapeutic insights: (1) Fractionating the standard daily regimen (50 Âµg/dose) into a twice daily schedule (25 Âµg/dose) is advantageous, yielding a significantly lower tumor mass (45 % decrease); (2) A low-dose (12 Âµg/day) regimen exerts a response similar to that obtained under the 50 Âµg/day treatment, suggestive of an equally efficacious dose with potentially reduced toxicity. Subsequent experiments in melanoma-bearing mice corroborated both of these predictions with high precision (R(2) > 0. 89), thus validating the model also prospectively in vivo. Thus, the confirmed PK/PD model rationalizes IL- 21 therapy, and pinpoints improved clinically-feasible treatment schedules.

Our aim was to reconcile these data using a physiologically-based population recirculatory PK-PD model, with emphasis on achieving a meta-model that could simultaneously account for the arterial and venous (arm) concentrations of fentanyl, could relate PD effects (pain scores) to the CNS concentrations of fentanyl, and {{could account for the}} effect of body size and age on fentanyl kinetics. Data on the concentration gradients of fentanyl across brain, lung and muscle were used to develop sub-models of fentanyl kinetics in these organs. The sub-models were incorporated into a "whole body" recirculatory model by adding additional sub-models for a venous mixing compartment, the liver and gut, the kidney and the "rest of the body" with blood flows and organ volumes based on values for a Standard Man. Inter-individual variability was achieved by allometric scaling of organ size and blood flows, evidence-based assumptions about the effect of weight and age on cardiac output, and inter-individual variability in the free fraction in plasma and hepatic extraction of fentanyl. Post-operative pain scores were found to be temporally related to the predicted brain concentrations of fentanyl. We conclude that a physiologically-based meta-modelling approach was able to describe clinical PK-PD studies of fentanyl whilst providing a mechanistic interpretation of key aspects of its disposition.

40|$|Midazolam is {{the drug}} of choice for palliative {{sedation}} and is titrated to achieve the desired level of sedation. A previous pharmacokinetic (PK) study showed that variability between patients could be partly explained by renal function and inflammatory status. The goal {{of this study was}} to combine this PK information with <b>pharmacodynamic</b> (PD) <b>data,</b> to evaluate the variability in response to midazolam and to find clinically relevant covariates that may predict PD response. A population pharmacodynamic analysis using nonlinear mixed effect models was performed with data from 43 terminally ill patients. PK profiles were predicted by a previously described PK model and depth of sedation was measured using the Ramsay sedation score. Patient and disease characteristics were evaluated as possible covariates. The final model was evaluated using a visual predictive check (VPC). The effect of midazolam on the sedation level was best described by a differential odds model including a baseline probability, Emax model and inter individual variability (IIV) on the overall effect. The EC 50 value was 68. 7 ug/L for a Ramsay score of 3 - 5 and 117. 1 ug/L for a Ramsay score of 6. Co-medication with haloperidol was the only significant covariate. The VPC of the final model showed good model predictability. We were able to accurately describe the clinical response to midazolam. As expected there was large variability in response to midazolam. The use of haloperidol was associated with a lower probability of sedation.

40|$|BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The urocortin (Ucn) {{peptides}} {{are emerging}} as potential therapeutic targets for heart disease. However, pharmacokinetic (PK) and <b>pharmacodynamic</b> (PD) <b>data</b> are lacking. Therefore, we investigated the PK/PD {{for all three}} Ucns. EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH: Seven sheep received 1 Î¼gÂ·kg boluses of Ucn 1, Ucn 2 and Ucn 3. Population PK/PD models were developed to describe {{the time course of}} the haemodynamic effects. RESULTS: The population estimate for Ucn 1 clearance (0. 486 LÂ·h) was lower than that for Ucn 2 (21. 7 LÂ·h) and Ucn 3 (220 LÂ·h), while steady-state volumes of distribution were similar for Ucn 1 and Ucn 2 (âˆ¼ 8 L) but substantially larger for Ucn 3 (23. 5 L). Ucn 1 disposition was adequately described by a two-compartment model, with a one-compartment model required for Ucn 2 and Ucn 3. The half-life for Ucn 1 was 2. 9 h (Î± phase) and 8. 3 h (Î² phase), and 15. 7 and 4. 4 min for Ucn 2 and Ucn 3 respectively. All Ucns produced significant increases in heart rate, cardiac output and left ventricular systolic and mean arterial pressures, and decreases in left atrial pressure and peripheral resistance. Delayed-effect pharmacodynamic models best described the time course of haemodynamic responses, with effects more rapid and less prolonged for Ucn 2 and Ucn 3 than Ucn 1. Similar and physiologically plausible estimated baseline (E) effects were exhibited by all Ucns, whereas EC values were generally greater for Ucn 1. CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS: Relative to Ucn 1, both the PK and haemodynamic responses to Ucn 2 and Ucn 3 occurred more rapidly.

These new {{developments in}}clude: epidemiological studies; experimental studies of TCE carcinogenicity, metabolism and metabolite carcinogenicity; applications of new physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) models for TCE; and new <b>pharmacodynamic</b> <b>data</b> obtained for TCE and its rhetabolites. Following a review of previous assessments of TCE carcinogenicity, each of these new sets of developments is summarized. The new epidemiological data do not provide evidence of TCE carcinogenicity in humans, and the new <b>pharmacodynamic</b> <b>data</b> support the hypothesis that TCE carcinogenicity is caused by TCE-induced cytotoxicity. Based on this information, PBPK-based estimates for likely no-adverse effect levels (NOAELs) for human exposures to TCE are calculated to be 16 ppb for TCE in air respired 24 hr/day, and 210 ppb for TCE in drinking water. Cancer risks of zero are predicted for TCE exposures below these calculated NOAELs. For comparison, hypothetical cancer risks posed by lifetime ingestive and multiroute household exposures to TCE in drinking water, at the currently enforced Maximum Contaminant Level (MCL) concentration of 5 ppb are extrapolated from animal bioassay data using a conservative, linear dose-response model. These TCE-related risks are compared to corresponding ones associated with concentrations of chlorination by-products (CBP) in household water. It is shown that, from the standpoint of comparative hypothetical cancer risks, based on conservative linear dose-response extrapolations, there would likely be no health benefit, and more likely a possible health detriment, associated with any switch from a household water supply containing < 375 ppb TCE to one containing CBP at levels corresponding to the currently proposed 80 -ppb MCL for total trihalomethanes...|$|E

40|$|Achieving a {{theoretical}} foundation for malaria elimination {{will require a}} detailed understanding of the quantitative relationships between patient treatment-seeking behavior, treatment coverage, {{and the effects of}} curative therapies that also block Plasmodium parasite transmission to mosquito vectors. Here, we report a mechanistic, within-host mathematical model that uses pharmacokinetic (PK) and <b>pharmacodynamic</b> (PD) <b>data</b> to simulate the effects of artemisinin-based combination therapies (ACTs) on Plasmodium falciparum transmission. To contextualize this model, we created a set of global maps of the fold reductions that would be necessary to reduce the malaria R C (i. e. its basic reproductive number under control) to below 1 and thus interrupt transmission. This modeling was applied to low-transmission settings, defined as having a R 0 < 10 based on 2010 data. Our modeling predicts that treating 93 - 98 % of symptomatic infections with an ACT within five days of fever onset would interrupt malaria transmission for âˆ¼ 91 % of the at-risk population of Southeast Asia and âˆ¼ 74 % of the global at-risk population, and lead these populations towards malaria elimination. This level of treatment coverage corresponds to an estimated 81 - 85 % of all infected individuals in these settings. At this coverage level with ACTs, the addition of the gametocytocidal agent primaquine affords no major gains in transmission reduction. Indeed, we estimate that it would require switching âˆ¼ 180 people from ACTs to ACTs plus primaquine to achieve the same transmission reduction as switching a single individual from untreated to treated with ACTs. Our model thus predicts that the addition of gametocytocidal drugs to treatment regimens provides very small population-wide benefits and that the focus of control efforts in Southeast Asia should be on increasing prompt ACT coverage. Prospects for elimination in much of Sub-Saharan Africa appear far less favorable currently, due to high rates of infection and less frequent and less rapid treatment...|$|R

Compared with the normal controls, the flavonoids, alkaloids and iridoids in inflamed rats exhibited consistently changing trends of PK behaviors, such as higher bioavailability, slower elimination, delays in reaching the maximum concentration (Tmax) and longer substantivity. The HCR of iridoids was different from that of alkaloids and flavonoids in inflamed rats. Furthermore, excellent pharmacodynamic effects of HLJDD were observed in inflamed rats. The levels of tumor necrosis factor-Î± (TNF-Î±), interleukin- 6 (IL- 6), IL- 1 Î², IL- 10, and macrophage inflammatory protein- 2 (MIP- 2) and body temperature significantly decreased after the administration of HLJDD. Based on PK-PD modeling with the three-phase synchronous characterization of time-concentration-effect, flavonoids exhibited one mechanism of action in the anti-inflammatory process, while iridoids and alkaloids showed another mechanism of action. Taken together, the results demonstrated that HLJDD may restrain inflammation synergistically via its major constituents (alkaloids, flavonoids and iridoids). A correlation between the exposure concentration of different types of compounds and their anti-inflammatory effects in the body was shown. This study provides a comprehensive understanding of the anti-inflammatory activity of HLJDD...|$|R
40|$|International audienceLoxapine is an {{antipsychotic}} used in psychiatry {{for over}} 40 {{years with a}} well-established profile. Loxapine is a dibenzoxazepine tricyclic antipsychotic agent, available for oral, intramuscular and inhalatory administration. In {{the light of the}} recent approval by the regulatory agencies of inhaled loxapine for use in the acute treatment of mild-to-moderate agitation in adults affected with schizophrenia or bipolar disorder, this article aims to critically review the available literature on loxapine, irrespective of its formulation. This review examines the efficacy and tolerability of the various formulations of loxapine in the treatment of agitation and aggression in patients affected with schizophrenia, bipolar disorder and other psychiatric conditions. A comprehensive and systematic literature search of PubMed/MEDLINE was conducted, and relevant <b>pharmacodynamic</b> and pharmacokinetic <b>data</b> was included. The findings from the literature were critically reviewed and synthesized. The available data suggests that the antipsychotic efficacy of loxapine is similar to the efficacy of other typical or atypical antipsychotics, with an adverse effects profile comparable to that of the typical antipsychotics at high doses for chronic treatment. As an acute treatment in agitation associated with schizophrenia or bipolar disorder, inhaled loxapine was developed as an innovative and rapid option which appears to be efficacious and tolerable...|$|R
