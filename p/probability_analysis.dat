40|$|This {{document}} {{provides a}} detailed overview of <b>probability</b> bounds <b>analysis.</b> In the sections that follow, the conceptual {{background of the}} approach is briefly presented, followed by the mathematical derivation of probability bounds around parametric, non-parametric, empirical, and assumed or stipulated models. Computation with p-boxes is then described, and numerical examples of computations are provided. In the next section, <b>probability</b> bounds <b>analysis</b> is compared and contrasted with Monte Carlo simulation techniques. Methods used by Monte Carlo analysts for treating input variables, dependencies between input variables, and model uncertainty are compared to methods used in <b>probability</b> bounds <b>analysis.</b> Techniques for implementing microexposure event analysis models are also compared, along with methods for conducting sensitivity analysis. Finally, the use of <b>probability</b> bounds <b>analysis</b> within the tiered framework for conducting probabilistic risk assessments recommended by EPA is discussed...|$|R

50|$|This {{bounding}} approach permits {{analysts to}} make calculations without requiring overly precise assumptions about parameter values, dependence among variables, or even distribution shape. <b>Probability</b> bounds <b>analysis</b> {{is essentially a}} combination of the methods of standard interval <b>analysis</b> and classical <b>probability</b> theory. <b>Probability</b> bounds <b>analysis</b> gives the same answer as interval analysis does when only range information is available.

40|$|Composite {{airframes}} {{suffer from}} complex damage modes during operation. Many investigations {{tend to look}} into specific aspects of damage mechanisms but seldom take a systematic view. This paper introduces a new fault tree methodology to synthesize various damage modes of composite structures by identifying possible damage causes. Qualitative analysis is performed incorporating structure importance <b>analysis,</b> <b>probability</b> importance <b>analysis</b> and relative <b>probability</b> importance <b>analysis.</b> Quantitative analysis by Monte Carlo simulation is then conducted as a validation to demonstrate the feasibility of the fault tree for composite damages. A number of options addressing main damage causes are proposed to improve the reliability of composite structures. Engineers from airlines and manufacturers can use this method to prioritize the main damage causes in different situations as a failure preventative tool or damage evaluation. Also, this approach can be extended to provide valuable inputs to other advanced methodologies to perform better diagnosis and prognosis for composites...|$|R

50|$|The final {{decision}} to accept or reject a model hypothesis {{is based on a}} detailed probabilistic model. This method first computes the expected number of false matches to the model pose, given the projected size of the model, the number of features within the region, and the accuracy of the fit. A Bayesian <b>probability</b> <b>analysis</b> then gives the probability that the object is present based on the actual number of matching features found. A model is accepted if the final probability for a correct interpretation is greater than 0.98. Lowe's SIFT based object recognition gives excellent results except under wide illumination variations and under non-rigid transformations.|$|E
50|$|To avoid wasting scarce bombe time on menus {{that were}} likely to yield an {{excessive}} number of false stops, Turing performed a lengthy <b>probability</b> <b>analysis</b> (without any electronic aids) of the estimated number of stops per rotor order. It was adopted as standard practice only to use menus that were estimated to produce {{no more than four}} stops per wheel order. This allowed an 8-letter crib for a 3-closure menu, an 11-letter crib for a 2-closure menu and a 14-letter crib for a menu with only one closure. If there was no closure, at least 16 letters were required in the crib. The longer the crib, however, the more likely it was that turn-over of the middle rotor would have occurred.|$|E
50|$|Some of the {{advantages}} of this analysis are that it has minimum systemic errors, easy to perform by both beginners and expert dentists, it can be used for both the arches, can be performed on both casts or in mouth, and does not require any radiographic projections. Limitations of this analysis are that this is a <b>probability</b> <b>analysis,</b> does not account for tipping of incisors lingual or buccal and that maxillary tooth sizes are predicted by the mandibular tooth sizes. Other limitations of this analysis is that Moyer's never clarified which population this analysis was done on initially. Therefore, this analysis cannot be truly applied to different populations. This was confirmed by a systematic review which was performed in 2004.|$|E

50|$|Between {{the time}} of the {{previous}} analysis and June 2012, the rest of the radial-velocity measurements used in 2011 were made public, allowing them to be reduced using HARPS-TERRA. These were then analysed via a Bayesian <b>probability</b> <b>analysis,</b> which was previously used to discover HD 10180 i and j, which confirmed planet b and made a first characterisation of planet c, which was previously only described as a trend. After the first two signals were introduced, the next most powerful signal was at around 35.5 days, with an analytic false alarm probability of 0.156. Through 104 trials, the false alarm probability was found to be 0.44%, low enough for it to be included as a periodic, planetary signal. With a minimum mass of around 11 Earths, the planet lies at the accepted border between Super-Earths and gaseous, Neptune-like bodies of 10 Earths.After accepting the third signal, a strong peak at 3.6 days became apparent. With a false alarm probability much lower than that of the previously accepted body, it was immediately accepted. With a minimum mass of around 4.5 Earths, it is a small Super-Earth.|$|E
5000|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{algorithm}} is to match MSERs to establish correspondence points between images. First MSER regions are computed on the intensity image (MSER+) and on the inverted image (MSER-). Measurement regions are selected at multiple scales: {{the size of the}} actual region, 1.5x, 2x, and 3x scaled convex hull of the region. Matching is accomplished in a robust manner, so it is better to increase the distinctiveness of large regions without being severely affected by clutter or non-planarity of the region's pre-image. A measurement taken from an almost planar patch of the scene with stable invariant description are called a 'good measurement'. Unstable ones or those on non-planar surfaces or discontinuities are called 'corrupted measurements'. The robust similarity is computed:For each [...] on region [...] regions [...] from the other image with the corresponding i-th measurement [...] nearest to [...] are found and a vote is cast suggesting correspondence of A and each of [...] Votes are summed over all measurements, and using <b>probability</b> <b>analysis,</b> we pick out the 'good measurements' as the 'corrupt measurements' will likely spread their votes randomly. By applying RANSAC to the centers of gravity of the regions, we can compute a rough epipolar geometry. An affine transformation between pairs of potentially corresponding regions is computed, and correspondences define it up to a rotation, which is then determined by epipolar lines. The regions are then filtered, and the ones with correlation of their transformed images above a threshold are chosen. RANSAC is applied again with a more narrow threshold, and the final eipolar geometry is estimated by the eight-point algorithm.|$|E
