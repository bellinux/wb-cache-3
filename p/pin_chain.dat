As Grewgious knew, from Helena, all that was necessary to provoke his experiment on Jasper's nerves, Mr. Proctor argued on false premises, but that was due to the craft of Dickens. Mr. Proctor rejected Forster's report, from memory, of what he understood to be the [...] "incommunicable secret" [...] of Dickens's plot, and I think that he was justified in the rejection. Forster {{does not seem to have}} cared about the thing--he refers lightly to [...] "the reader curious in such matters"--when once he had received his explanation from Dickens. His memory, in the space of five years, may have been inaccurate: he probably neither knew nor cared who Datchery was; and he may readily have misunderstood what Dickens told him, orally, about the ring, as the instrument of detection. Moreover, Forster quite overlooked one source of evidence, as I shall show later.|$|E

40|$|A polymer <b>chain</b> <b>pinned</b> {{in space}} exerts a {{fluctuating}} {{force on the}} pin point in thermal equilibrium. The average of such fluctuating force is well understood from statistical mechanics as an entropic force, but {{little is known about}} the underlying force distribution. Here, we introduce two phase space sampling methods that can produce the equilibrium distribution of instantaneous forces exerted by a terminally pinned polymer. In these methods, both the positions and momenta of mass points representing a freely jointed chain are perturbed in accordance with the spatial constraints and the Boltzmann distribution of total energy. The constraint force for each conformation and momentum is calculated using Lagrangian dynamics. Using terminally <b>pinned</b> <b>chains</b> in space and on a surface, we show that the force distribution is highly asymmetric with both tensile and compressive forces. Most importantly, the mean of the distribution, which is equal to the entropic force, is not the most probable force even for long chains. Our work provides insights into the mechanistic origin of entropic forces, and an efficient computational tool for unbiased sampling of the phase space of a constrained system.

Afterwards, an internal coating {{is applied to the}} cans and it is sent to another gas oven to be cured. Some of the problems using this thermal process of coating and curing includes: Speed of printing limited by length and speed of <b>pin</b> <b>chain</b> conveyors, high energy costs for gas ovens, and also the can coatings becoming non-functional, when they are overheated in the oven due to slow speed or stoppages. Also, the use of lubricants on the pin chains is kept to a minimum to prevent it from getting into the can. Because of this, pin chains [...] "wear excessively and break frequently". Before it can even be repaired, 20 minutes need to be spent to wait for the oven to cool down enough.|$|E

However, on 25 September 1852 The Mining Journal ran an advert for the sale of all the mine's equipment by public auction.

40|$|The melting of the Abrikosov vortex lattice in a 2 D type-II {{superconductor}} at high {{magnetic fields}} is studied analytically {{within the framework}} of the phenomenological Ginzburg-Landau theory. It is shown that local phase fluctuations in the superconducting order parameter, associated with low energies sliding motions of Bragg chains along the principal crystallographic axes of the vortex lattice, lead to a weak first order 'melting' transition at a certain temperature T_m, well below the mean field T_c, where the shear modulus drops abruptly to a nonzero value. The residual shear modulus above T_m decreases asymptotically to zero with increasing temperature. Despite the large phase fluctuations, the average positions of Bragg chains at fimite temperature correspond to a regular vortex lattice, slightly distorted with respect to the triangular Abrikosov lattice. It is also shown that a genuine long range phase coherence exists only at zero temperature; however, below the melting point the vortex state is very close to the triangular Abrikosov lattice. A study of the size dependence of the structure factor at finite temperature indicates the existence of quasi-long range order with S(G) ∼ N^σ, and 1 / 2 <σ < 1, where superconducting crystallites of correlated Bragg chains grow only along <b>pinning</b> <b>chains.</b> This finding may suggest a very efficient way of generating pinning defects in quasi 2 D superconductors.

40|$|The {{effects of}} <b>pinning</b> density, <b>chain</b> length, and 'cloud point' (CP) versus non-CP {{grafting}} conditions {{have been studied}} {{on the ability of}} polyethylene glycol (PEG) layers to minimize adsorption from a multicomponent (lysozyme, human serum albumin (HSA), IgG and lactoferrin) protein solution. Methoxy-terminated aldehyde-PEG (M-PEG, MW 5000) and dialdehyde-PEG (PEG(ald) 2, MW 3400) were grafted by reductive amination onto two surfaces of different amine group density, generated by radio-frequency glow discharge (r. f. g. d.) deposition of n-heptylamine (HA) (low density) or allylamine (AlA) (high density) r. f. g. d. polymer layers. The PEG graft density was varied also by increasing the temperature and salt (K 2 SO 4) content of the grafting solution; it reached a maximum at the CP of the PEGs. The CP reaction conditions were critical for producing PEG layers capable of minimizing protein adsorption. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) showed that under these conditions, PEG(ald) 2 produced a thick linear PEG layer, most likely by aldol condensation. Protein adsorption was assessed using XPS and matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-ToF-MS) in the surface mode (Surface-MALDI-MS). Coatings grafted at non-CP conditions showed some protein adsorption, as did the HA/M-PEG layer grafted at the CP. On the other hand, no protein adsorption was detected on the HA/PEG(ald) 2, AlA/M-PEG, and AlA/PEG(ald) 2 surfaces when grafted at the CP. Thus, the effects of <b>pinning</b> density and <b>chain</b> length are interrelated, but the key factor is optimization of PEG chain density by use of the CP conditions, provided that a sufficient density of pinning sites exists...|$|R

40|$|We {{study the}} {{critical}} depinning current J_c, {{as a function}} of the applied magnetic flux Phi, for quasiperiodic (QP) pinning arrays, including one-dimensional (1 D) chains and two-dimensional (2 D) arrays of pinning centers placed on the nodes of a five-fold Penrose lattice. In 1 D QP <b>chains</b> of <b>pinning</b> sites, the peaks in J_c(Phi) are shown to be determined by a sequence of harmonics of long and short periods of the chain. This sequence includes as a subset the sequence of successive Fibonacci numbers. We also analyze the evolution of J_c(Phi) while a continuous transition occurs from a periodic lattice of pinning centers to a QP one; the continuous transition is achieved by varying the ratio gamma = a_S/a_L of lengths of the short a_S and the long a_L segments, starting from gamma = 1 for a periodic sequence. We find that the peaks related to the Fibonacci sequence are most pronounced when gamma is equal to the "golden mean". The critical current J_c(Phi) in QP lattice has a remarkable self-similarity. This effect is demonstrated both in real space and in reciprocal k-space. In 2 D QP pinning arrays (e. g., Penrose lattices), the pinning of vortices is related to matching conditions between the vortex lattice and the QP lattice of pinning centers. Although more subtle to analyze than in 1 D <b>pinning</b> <b>chains,</b> the structure in J_c(Phi) is determined by the presence of two different kinds of elements forming the 2 D QP lattice. Indeed, we predict analytically and numerically the main features of J_c(Phi) for Penrose lattices. Comparing the J_c's for QP (Penrose), periodic (triangular) and random arrays of pinning sites, we have found that the QP lattice provides an unusually broad critical current J_c(Phi), that could be useful for practical applications demanding high J_c's over a wide range of fields.

Firstly, {{the properties of}} optical traps and potential energy landscapes are determined using driven colloidal particles and clusters. The trap stiffness and potential depth of single Gaussian traps are measured directly. It is shown {{that the nature of}} optical potential energy landscapes may be fully engineered and predicted using a sum of single Gaussian potentials. Next, the motion of colloidal particles driven by a constant force over a periodic optical potential energy landscape is considered. The average particle velocity is found {{as a function of the}} driving velocity, and the wavelength of the optical potential energy landscape, which is found to be sinusoidal at small trap spacings. The critical driving velocity required for a particle to move across the landscape is determined as a function of the wavelength. Brownian motion is found to have a significant effect on the critical driving velocity, but a negligible effect at high driving velocity. Subsequently, the dynamic mode locking caused by adding a modulation to the driving force is studied. This synchronisation manifests as a `Devil's staircase' in the average particle velocity as a function of driving velocity. The amplitude and frequency dependence of the mode locked steps are studied. Furthermore, particle trajectories are examined, and phase portraits show locked (unlocked) states as closed (open) loops in phase space. A state diagram of mode locked steps is constructed. Finally, driven systems of magnetically interacting colloidal particles are examined in potential energy landscapes. The critical driving velocity of a chain of coupled particles driven by a constant force is found to depend strongly on the chain length and the magnetic field. Secondly, a mobile density wave (kink) in an optically <b>pinned</b> <b>chain</b> of coupled particles is exposed to a constant and modulated drive. The kink is found to behave as a quasi-particle, exhibiting analogous dynamic mode locking behaviour to the single particle case. Finally, the mode locking of a finite mobile chain is considered, and found to be affected by the chain flexibility, which is a function of the magnetic field.

40|$|We {{study the}} thermal {{properties}} of a <b>pinned</b> disordered harmonic <b>chain</b> weakly perturbed by a noise and an anharmonic potential. The noise {{is controlled by}} a parameter λ → 0, and the anharmonicity by a parameter λ ≤ λ. Let κ be the conductivity of the chain, defined through the Green-Kubo formula. Under suitable hypotheses, we show that κ = O(λ) and, {{in the absence of}} anharmonic potential, that κ ∼ λ. This is in sharp contrast with the ordered chain for which κ ∼ 1 /λ, and so shows the persistence of localization effects for a non-integrable dynamic...|$|R
5000|$|Some chain {{tools are}} better at {{removing}} pins than they are at inserting them. Once completely removed, <b>chain</b> <b>pins</b> are often very difficult to insert with a tool unless it has been specifically designed to do so. Users may overcome this limitation of some tools by never completely removing a pin that they intend to replace. They push the pin so that the chain can be broken, to shorten it for example, but {{so that it is}} firmly retained in the farthest plate. This way, even simple chain tools can press the pin back into place.|$|R
25|$|Each shoulder-clasp {{consists}} of two matching curved halves, hinged upon a long removable <b>chained</b> <b>pin.</b> The surfaces display panels of interlocking stepped garnets and chequer millefiori insets, surrounded by interlaced ornament of Germanic Style II ribbon animals. The half-round clasp ends contain garnet-work of interlocking wild boars with filigree surrounds. On {{the underside of the}} mounts are lugs for attachment to a stiff leather cuirass. The function of the clasps is to hold together the two halves of such armour so that it can fit the torso closely in the Roman manner. The cuirass itself, possibly worn in the grave, did not survive. No other Anglo-Saxon cuirass clasps are known.|$|R
50|$|In the handicap, {{there were}} just six points {{separating}} Stubenrauch and Toseland, pointing to an exciting finish. At Berwick Toseland lost a <b>pin</b> from his <b>chain,</b> lost contact with the bunch and lost his chance at the £500. For {{the second time in}} the race C Grade set the fastest time of the race, with Howden leading the bunch. Stubenrauch finished with the bunch to win the handicap, while Duffy’s second place was enough to see him snatch 2nd in the handicap from Toseland. Toseland had an impressive race in that, riding from C grade, he finished 9th in the championship, beating all of the B grade riders.|$|R
