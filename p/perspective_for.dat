The game's story focuses on two different styles of gameplay which the player switches between at various points.|$|E
5|$|David was {{conceptualized}} {{as a character}} to provide a non-human <b>perspective</b> <b>for</b> the theme of meeting one's creators in Prometheus, with him representing the next generation {{in a line of}} creators who finds himself disillusioned by his predecessors. Fassbender, who was director Ridley Scott's first choice for the role, helped fashion the character to share traits with T. E. Lawrence, who was a source of inspiration as a control freak caught between two cultures- the cultures being humanity and synthetics, in David's case. As the series progresses, David's behaviors and motivations evolve from a mysterious agent with ambiguous motivations to a character directly opposing the well-being of humanity.|$|E

5|$|Among {{the various}} {{patterns}} and motifs found in Delian mosaics is the triple-colored lozenge {{that creates a}} three-dimensional illusion of cubes in <b>perspective</b> <b>for</b> the viewer. This pattern appears in fifteen different locations, {{making it one of}} the most common. Other motifs include waves and stepped triangles, while major themes include maritime, theatrical, natural, or mythological objects and figures. The single wave pattern, a common motif in Hellenistic art, is the most predominant type of border design for mosaics at Delos and appear in mosaics of Arsameia (albeit arranged in the opposite direction). The rosette motif, which is found in the mosaics of various Hellenistic sites across the Mediterranean, is often coupled with single-wave borders in Delian mosaics. The typical Hellenistic palmette motif is used in a mosaic of Delos to fill the four corners around a central rosette motif. The illusion of three-dimensional relief in the figured scenes of Delian mosaics was usually achieved by the use of polychrome, with white, black, yellow, red, blue and green hues.|$|E

Timeout is called with three seconds remaining, John Smith is on the line. And I don't care what's on the line, Howard, {{you have got to}} say what we know in the booth.Cosell: Yes, we have to say it. Remember this is just a football game, no matter who wins or loses. An unspeakable tragedy confirmed to us by ABC News in New York City: John Lennon, outside of his apartment building on the West Side of New York City, the most famous perhaps, of all of the Beatles, shot twice in the back, rushed to Roosevelt Hospital, dead on arrival. Hard {{to go back to the}} game after that newsflash, which, in duty bound, we have to take. Frank?Gifford: (after a pause) Indeed, it is.|$|E
5|$|In {{classical}} times, {{rather than}} making distant figures smaller with linear perspective, painters sized objects and figures according to their thematic importance. In the Middle Ages, some artists used reverse <b>perspective</b> <b>for</b> special emphasis. The Muslim mathematician Alhazen (Ibn al-Haytham) described a theory of optics in his Book of Optics in 1021, but never applied it to art. The Renaissance saw a rebirth of Classical Greek and Roman culture and ideas, among them the study of mathematics to understand nature and the arts. Two major motives drove artists in the late Middle Ages and the Renaissance towards mathematics. First, painters needed {{to figure out how}} to depict three-dimensional scenes on a two-dimensional canvas. Second, philosophers and artists alike were convinced that mathematics was the true essence of the physical world and that the entire universe, including the arts, could be explained in geometric terms.|$|E

5|$|The StarCraft II Editor is a campaign, map, and mod editor. It is {{far more}} {{sophisticated}} than StarCrafts StarEdit and s World Editor for creating custom maps and campaigns, {{and it is the}} first editor by Blizzard to feature built-in mod creation and usage support. Updated art and data from the original StarCraft that were not used, along with models and data that were scrapped during the development process (including those made as April Fools jokes) will be available in the editor. Unlike previous editors made by Blizzard, it is the first to have Internet connectivity features such as map publishing, retrieval, and online activation of the editor client. Lead producer Chris Sigaty has stated that the editor gives players the ability to create role-playing, Hero-type units and structures resembling those from WarCraft III. At BlizzCon 2009, Blizzard demonstrated a build of the StarCraft II Editor showcasing its capabilities, such as the ability to customize the user interface to include features such as the Item system from Warcraft III. The final build includes a third-person style <b>perspective</b> <b>for</b> missions.|$|E
