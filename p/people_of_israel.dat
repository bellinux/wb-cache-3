5|$|The {{first two}} stories were both seen in Medieval- and Renaissance {{theology}} as prefiguring the Crucifixion of Jesus. In {{the story of}} the Brazen Serpent, the <b>people</b> <b>of</b> <b>Israel</b> become dissatisfied and grumble at God. As punishment they receive a plague of venonous snakes. God offers the people relief by instructing Moses to make a snake of brass and set it up on a pole, the sight of which gives miraculous healing. Michelangelo chooses a crowded composition, depicting a dramatic mass of suffering men, women, and writhing snakes, separated from redeemed worshipers by the snake before an epiphanic light.|$|E

25|$|The Torah {{starts from}} the {{beginning}} of God's creating the world, through the beginnings of the <b>people</b> <b>of</b> <b>Israel,</b> their descent into Egypt, and the giving of the Torah at biblical Mount Sinai. It ends with the death of Moses, just before the <b>people</b> <b>of</b> <b>Israel</b> cross to the promised land of Canaan. Interspersed in the narrative are the specific teachings (religious obligations and civil laws) given explicitly (i.e. Ten Commandments) or implicitly embedded in the narrative (as in Exodus 12 and 13 laws of the celebration of Passover).|$|E

25|$|God {{called on}} the <b>people</b> <b>of</b> <b>Israel</b> to {{remember}} these things, and not forget God who formed them and blotted out their sins. God {{called on the}} heaven and earth, mountain and forest to sing, for God had redeemed Israel for God's glory.|$|E
25|$|Exodus {{begins the}} story of God's revelation to his <b>people</b> <b>of</b> <b>Israel</b> through Moses, who leads them out of Egypt (Exodus 1–18) to Mount Sinai. There the people accept the {{covenant}} with God, agreeing to be his people and abide by his holy Law, in return for his agreeing to be their God, and protect and defend them from their enemies, and provide for and prosper them. Moses receives the Torah from God, and teaches His laws and Covenant (Exodus 19–24) to the <b>people</b> <b>of</b> <b>Israel.</b> It also talks about the first violation of the covenant when the Golden Calf was constructed (Exodus 32–34). Exodus includes the instructions on building the Tabernacle and concludes with its actual construction (Exodus 25–31; 35–40).|$|E
50|$|A {{commentary}} on the Song of Songs, treating each verse at three levels: at the literal level, citing contemporary grammarians to explain every word on the scroll; at a rabbinical level, based on midrashic texts, symbolising the <b>people</b> <b>of</b> <b>Israel's</b> relationship with God; and at an allegorical level, describing the soul trying to unite itself with the intellect, supported by Jewish and Arab poets, and the philosophy of Al-Farabi and Avicenna.|$|R

50|$|Wilson {{commenced}} {{studying at}} great length in the Library of Trinity College, Dublin, in 1837. Within a year, he was giving a series of lectures, which developed an audience. In 1840, he published Our Israelitish Origin, a book of his lectures, in which he claimed that the <b>peoples</b> <b>of</b> <b>Israel</b> had made {{their way across the}} continent of Europe to the British Isles. He brought evidence to bear from Ptolemy and works by Diodorus, supporting the earlier history of the Israelites. He studied the works of Rawlinson, Herodotus, and Josephus, and quoted extensively from Sharon Turner.|$|R
25|$|The righteous, however, and, {{according}} to some, also the sinners among the <b>people</b> <b>of</b> <b>Israel</b> for whom Abraham intercedes because they bear the Abrahamic {{sign of the}} covenant are not harmed by the fire of Gehenna {{even when they are}} required to pass through the intermediate state of purgatory ('Er. 19b; Ḥag. 27a).|$|E
25|$|And yet God {{told the}} <b>people</b> <b>of</b> <b>Israel</b> not to fear, for God would pour water upon the thirsty land, and God's blessing upon their offspring, {{and they would}} spring up like grass.

25|$|Hanukkah {{marks the}} defeat of Seleucid Empire forces that had tried to prevent the <b>people</b> <b>of</b> <b>Israel</b> from {{practicing}} Judaism. Judah Maccabee and his brothers destroyed overwhelming forces, and rededicated the Temple in Jerusalem.

5000|$|God has freely {{chosen to}} {{associate}} {{man with the}} work of his grace. the fatherly action of God is first on his own initiative, and then follows mans free acting through his collaboration. For Catholics, therefore, human cooperation with grace is essential. When God establishes his eternal plan of predestination, he includes in it each persons free response to his grace, whether it is positive or negative: [...] "In this city, in fact, both Herod and Pontius Pilate, with the Gentiles and the <b>peoples</b> <b>of</b> <b>Israel,</b> gathered together against your holy servant Jesus, whom you anointed, to do whatever your hand and your plan had predestined to take place" [...] (...)

25|$|In {{the text}} of the psalm, {{specifically}} verses 2 through 5, the speaker makes the assumption that individuals who plot against the nation of Israel must inherently be enemies of God. He also ascribes to them the intention of the complete extinction of the <b>people</b> <b>of</b> <b>Israel,</b> as that is the meaning of verse 4, which indicates that the name of Israel will be obliterated or remembered no more.|$|E
25|$|God {{formed the}} <b>people</b> <b>of</b> <b>Israel</b> {{that they might}} praise God, {{but they did not}} call upon God, nor did they bring God their burnt-offerings, meal-offerings, frankincense, or the fat of their sacrifices. Rather, they {{burdened}} God with their sins. God blots out their transgressions for God's own sake. Their first father sinned, and their intercessors transgressed, and so God abandoned the sanctuary and the Israelites to condemnation.|$|E
25|$|Most Islamic {{tradition}} conveys Jesus and {{his teaching}} conformed to the prophetic model: a human, as with previous prophets, sent by God {{to a certain}} people at a certain time, to present both a judgement upon humanity for worshipping idols and a challenge {{to turn to the}} one true God. Tradition believes Jesus' mission was to the <b>people</b> <b>of</b> <b>Israel,</b> his status as a prophet confirmed by numerous miracles.|$|E

The congregation also ran a religious school. By 1907 Staunton's Jewish population was an estimated 40 <b>people.</b> House <b>of</b> <b>Israel</b> had fifteen member families, and still held services twice a week. However, the congregation still had no rabbi, and the religious school no longer functioned.|$|R

Moab rebels against oppression, like Moses, leads his <b>people</b> out <b>of</b> <b>Israel,</b> as Moses does from Egypt, and his first-born son is slaughtered at the wall of Kir-hareseth as the firstborn <b>of</b> <b>Israel</b> are condemned to slaughter in the Exodus story, [...] "an infernal passover that delivers Mesha while wrath burns against his enemies".|$|R

25|$|Judah {{did what}} was {{evil in the}} sight of the Lord, and they {{provoked}} him to jealousy with their sins which they committed, more than all that their fathers had done.

There is no scholarly consensus as to when the Hebrew Bible canon was fixed: some scholars argue that it was fixed by the Hasmonean dynasty, while others argue it was not fixed until the second century CE or even later.|$|E

25|$|But it was {{particularly}} with the view of fitting the soul for communion with God, or {{for the purpose of}} keeping the body sufficiently pure to allow it to come into contact with sacred objects, that many strove to avoid things that either cause intoxication or Levitical impurity, the drinking of wine (Lev. x. 9; Num. vi. 3; Amos ii. 12; Judges xiii. 14), or sexual intercourse, which was forbidden to the <b>people</b> <b>of</b> <b>Israel,</b> in preparation for the Sinai Revelation (Ex. xix. 15), and to Moses during the life of communion with God (Deut. ix. 9, 18; I Sam. xxi. 5; Shab. 87a).|$|E

When he is eighty years old, Moses is tending a herd of sheep in solitude on Mount Sinai when he sees a desert shrub that is burning but is not consumed.
