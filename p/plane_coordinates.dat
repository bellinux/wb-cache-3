This property is known as shift invariance (Scott 1998). No optical system is perfectly shift invariant: as the ideal, mathematical point of light is scanned away from the optic axis, aberrations will eventually degrade the impulse response (known as a coma in focused imaging systems).

Then, we can have punctures in the plane (holes so to speak) so that if γ is a closed path which winds once around the puncture, [...] is only an integer multiple of 2π. These punctures are called vortices and if γ is a closed path which only winds once counterclockwise around the puncture and its winding number about any other puncture is zero, then the integer multiplicity can be attached to the vortex itself.

40|$|Abstract: The {{nature of}} {{surveying}} {{lends itself to}} the use of coordinate systems for calculating the positions of points. Large, statewide projects benefit from a single uniform coordinate system that provides one datum for the calculations. Unfortunately, using coordinates from a rectangular system to depict positions from the curved earth’s surface leads to scale distortions. Typically, the established state <b>plane</b> <b>coordinate</b> systems have been derived to keep the relative scale error at 1 : 10, 000 or better. This was chosen because the desired and achievable relative error in surveys was thought to be 1 : 10, 000. Currently, Illinois uses two zones for the state <b>plane</b> <b>coordinate</b> system. A single zone for Illinois would eliminate the calculations required when working from one zone to another. Using appropriate data, a system can be created that would be useful to mapping professionals and land surveyors.

The coordinate system generated is such that in the transformed <b>plane</b> <b>coordinate</b> spacing in the xi, eta, zeta direction is constant and equal to unity.
