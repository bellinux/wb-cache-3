5|$|Although {{rubidium}} is {{more abundant}} in Earth's crust than caesium, the limited applications {{and the lack}} of a mineral rich in rubidium limits the production of rubidium compounds to 2 to 4 tonnes per year. Several methods are available for separating potassium, rubidium, and caesium. The fractional crystallization of a rubidium and caesium alum (Cs,Rb)Al(SO4)2·12H2O yields after 30 subsequent steps pure rubidium alum. Two other methods are reported, the chlorostannate <b>process</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> ferrocyanide process.|$|E
5|$|As {{the weather}} warmed and work resumed {{on the main}} pipeline, Alyeska administrators were distracted by a {{controversy}} about pipeline welds {{that had been done}} the previous year. In September 1975, a former employee of Ketchbaw Industries filed suit against the company, alleging that he had been laid off because he would not participate in a conspiracy to falsify quality control X-Rays of pipeline welds. The Trans-Alaska Pipeline was unique among pipeline projects to that point in that it required all welds of the main pipeline to be verified by X-Ray. This was a time-consuming <b>process,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> quality-control procedures continually lagged behind the welders.|$|E

5|$|Because of the {{versatility}} of the <b>process</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> {{simplicity of}} its equipment and operation, shielded {{metal arc welding}} {{is one of the}} world's first and most popular welding processes. It dominates other welding processes in the maintenance and repair industry, and though flux-cored arc welding is growing in popularity, SMAW continues to be used extensively in the construction of heavy steel structures and in industrial fabrication. The process is used primarily to weld iron and steels (including stainless steel) but aluminium, nickel and copper alloys can also be welded with this method.|$|E
