40|$|The {{quality of}} the {{castings}} are depended on many properties of sand mould like mould hardness, green compression strength, shear strength etc. and these properties in turn dependent on factors such as grain fineness number of sand, setting/curing time, amount of resin, amount of hardener, moisture content etc. Mould hardness is very important while transferring mould from moulding station to <b>pouring</b> <b>station</b> when {{the weight of the}} mould is above 100 kg and may lead to defects. In the present work, an effort is made to study the mould hardness of a moulding sand specimen using Taguchi technique. L 9 orthogonal array is used and experiments are conducted randomly. The main factors such as the amount of resin, amount of hardener and setting time were considered. Factors were selected based on Literature review and brainstorming session with foundries. The chemical (resin and hardener) used is alphas set type two part system. From experiments, it was observed that the Amount of resin and setting time are significant for mould hardness. Confirmation tests were conducted to validate the obtained results...|$|E
50|$|Nallasopara is {{a railway}} {{station on the}} Western line of the Mumbai Suburban Railway network.The Western Railways is {{planning}} to widen platforms at the station. It has placed work orders to create more space on the narrow fast-train platform 4 at Nallasopara and also at Mira Road that {{is linked to the}} skywalk. The project cost is about 72 lakh and the work will be completed by July 2012. Nallasopara is one of the busiest railway station in Mumbai.In 2011, Nallasopara alone recorded a 25% increase in commuters travelling in first-class compartments as compared to the previous year. The extra space on platforms will help the railway deal with the sea of people continuously <b>pouring</b> into <b>stations</b> because of longer trains, wider bridges and new skywalks.|$|R
5000|$|Thompson's {{performance}} {{began at}} 8 P.M. that night, with Hay introducing Thompson and stating that Thompson would take requests from listeners. Phone calls and telegrams immediately began <b>pouring</b> into the <b>station.</b> At {{the end of}} the hour, Hay asked Thompson if he had done enough fiddling, to which Thompson replied, [...] "a man don't get warmed up in an hour," [...] and showed Hay the blue ribbon he had recently won at the eight-day fiddle contest in Dallas.|$|R
500|$|The {{contract}} for tunneling and station {{construction on the}} project, since renamed the [...] "Northgate Link extension", was awarded by Sound Transit to JCM Northlink LLC (a joint venture of Jay Dee, Coluccio, and Michels) for $462 million in 2013. In May 2013, demolition of an existing Chase Bank branch and a university-owned property began at the future site of the station. In December, a segment of Brooklyn Avenue NE was closed through the work zone as part of final preparations for the station site. Construction of shoring walls and drilling of pilings in the station box was completed from April to August 2014, leading {{to the start of}} excavation the following month. By the completion of excavation the following summer, over [...] of dirt was removed from the site to reach a depth of [...] Concrete <b>pouring</b> of the <b>station</b> box began in July 2015, to prepare for the arrival of two tunnel boring machines (TBMs).|$|R
50|$|The Pine Street {{segment of}} the tunnel, running from 4th Avenue to 9th Avenue, would be dug cut-and-cover, {{requiring}} a long-term closure of the street. SCI Contractors of Calgary was awarded the $74.5 million contract for the Pine Street segment, including the construction of Westlake and Convention Place stations, in February 1987. On April 27, 1987, Pine Street was closed to non-bus traffic, and construction of Westlake station's pilings and outer walls began. Excavation of the tunnel on Pine Street was completed in late August, allowing for concrete pouring to begin. Pine Street was briefly re-opened for the Christmas shopping season, from November 2 to January 4, {{at the request of}} downtown merchants; the excavated tunnel was backfilled and given a temporary surface for automobile traffic. A pair of tunnel boring machines arrived at Westlake station in the spring of 1988 after completing the 3rd Avenue {{segment of the}} bus tunnel; the machines were partially salvaged, leaving the outer shells in place to form part of the tunnel walls. Pine Street was re-opened to traffic on November 1, 1988, coinciding with the opening of Westlake Center and Westlake Park. Excavation and concrete <b>pouring</b> in Westlake <b>station</b> were completed in December 1988, leaving major work on the mezzanine level left to finish.|$|R
5000|$|On {{the back}} of the jacket, Furman writes an {{explanation}} for the recording of the EP, reading: [...] "A good song takes you far," [...] sang Jackson Browne on tour in the 70's. It's true, and very strange-- how these little three-minute compositions crafted on a whim in a bedroom end up bringing us out on planes and highways, into bars and ballrooms and radio <b>stations,</b> <b>pouring</b> out our hearts and lungs for those who themselves were pulled out of their rooms and into the world by the power of song. Browne understood this: he himself was covering Danny O'Keefe's perfect ode to the bizarre, bittersweet life of a traveling musician, and when I listen to it crammed in a van full of instruments speeding across rainy Germany, it hits hard.I have always played other people's songs, alone and with friends, at home and on the road. I know our audiences' main interest is in our original songs, and for that I'm honored. But I can't seem to stop playing covers. Every time we are preparing to go on tour I can't help assembling the Boy-Friends and demanding that we learn a new cover song to play live. I listen to so much great music and just ache to be able to inhabit it more fully. I want to be Beck or Melanie or Jackie Wilson. So this record is me playing dress-up, with the help of my incredible band.(Don't miss that point-- The Boy-Friends are an incredible band that can do anything, without whom my voice would not be in your earholes.)Thanks for indulging us in these cover versions, pieced together from studio recordings, recordings made on tour in backstage rooms and hotels, and a live show in Austria. I'd {{like to point out that}} we've included a song from every decade since rock'n'roll has been a viable marketing category, the 1950's through the 2010's. You are encouraged to look up the original versions if you've never heard them. They blew my mind.-Ezra, December 2015 ...|$|R
