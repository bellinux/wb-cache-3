40|$|Multilevel {{logistic}} regression models were constructed {{to predict the}} 5 -year mortality of Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) and <b>pubescent</b> <b>birch</b> (Betula pubescens Ehrh.) growing in drained peatland stands in northern and central Finland. Data concerning tree mortality were obtained from two successive measurements of the National Forest Inventory-based permanent sample plot data base covering pure and mixed stands of Scots pine and <b>pubescent</b> <b>birch.</b> In the modeling data, Scots pine showed an average observed mortality of 2. 73 % compared to 2. 98 % for <b>pubescent</b> <b>birch.</b> In the model construction, stepwise {{logistic regression}} and multilevel models methods were applied, the latter {{making it possible to}} address the hierarchical data, thus obtaining unbiased estimates for model parameters. For both species, mortality was explained by tree size, competitive position, stand density, species admixture, and site quality. The expected need for ditch network maintenance or re-paludifi cation did not infl uence mortality. The multilevel models showed the lowest bias in the modeling data. The models were further validated against independent test data and by embedding them in a stand simulator.

30|$|A tending {{treatment}} was simulated {{at the age}} of 7  years. It was first assumed that species other than the planted one are completely removed. Then, other optimizations were conducted in which a mixture of pine, spruce and birch was left to continue growing. Hardwoods other than birch were removed completely. Trees were left in all size classes of the plantation species but smaller classes were thinned more than larger ones. Other species were treated with uniform thinning. As a result, the tending treatment reduced the size variation of seedlings only slightly. The tending of the spruce plantation left 330 pines, 1028 spruces, 330 silver <b>birches</b> and 330 <b>pubescent</b> <b>birches</b> per hectare. In the pine plantation, 1525 pines, 300 spruces, 90 silver <b>birches</b> and 90 <b>pubescent</b> <b>birches</b> were kept. The number of birches was lower because of the adverse effect of a dense birch cover on pine development. This is because birches easily overtop pines, which reduces the productivity of the stand. This was also noted in preliminary simulations.|$|R
30|$|Based of this rationale, a {{thinning}} treatment was specified with three harvest percentages that were optimized separately for pine, spruce, silver birch and <b>pubescent</b> <b>birch.</b> The {{number of years}} since planting (first thinning) or previous cutting (other thinnings) defined {{the timing of the}} {{thinning treatment}}.

40|$|Abstract Plant {{registration}} and selection work aimed at identifying the best genotypes for northern landscaping {{has been carried}} out in Finland since the 1980 ’s. In the University of Oulu Botanical Gardens, micropropagation methods have been developed for several woody plant taxa registered during the POHKAS (Northern Hardy Plants) project. Micropropagation is an effective method to conserve valuable genetic characteristics and to produce plantlets from woody species with limited mother stock material and in a limited time period. In this study the long-term field phenology and success of 19 micropropagated shrub and tree taxa was followed in plant selection experiments. Experiments were conducted at four northern field sites presenting different climatic conditions. Of the phenological monitoring parameters, the onset of foliation and flowering in the field revealed a strong relation to spring time temperature, being obviously latest to occur in northernmost site. The gradient between southern and northern sites for autumn phenology was not so obvious. However, between the different genotypes, the greatest differences were observed in the timing of autumn colouration and defoliation. Winter hardiness also showed clear differences between genotypes. Of the success parameters, it was most decisive as winter hardy genotypes had a higher occurrence of flowers and ornamental appearance, for example in Rosa majalis ‘Tornedal’. Some of these hardy genotypes with known characteristics were introduced to northern tourism areas to create examples of sustainable landscaping. Further, a list of potential plants for different northern sites was compiled. Special forms with both scientific and ornamental value are occasionally found in wild species. One example of this is the red-leaved form of a <b>pubescent</b> <b>birch,</b> Betula pubescens f. rubra, which was studied in the plant selection experiments, and was used as a model tree to evaluate the role of anthocyanins in northern plants in a case study of northern birches. In the case study, the red-leaved <b>pubescent</b> <b>birch</b> showed some differences in flavonoid responses and growth rate in comparison to Betula pubescens and Betula pubescens ssp. czerepanovii. Phenology of the B. p. f. rubra was corresponding to that of the B. pubescens. For cultivated woody plants the most important selection criteria for the northern areas are the suitability to local climate i. e. timing of phenological events and winter hardiness.

The aim was to assess the developing young plantations of Norway spruce, European beech, European larch and Carpathian <b>pubescent</b> <b>birch</b> in particular, as well as of sycamore maple, European mountain ash and Silesian willow aged 9 [...] 14 years after planting. The assessment was focused primarily on the mensurational variables of the tree species (height, root collar diameter, crown diameter, and their increments). Part of the work was to evaluate the condition of soil environment, nutrition, root system architecture and health of Norway spruce. The best growth was shown by European larch. By contrast, the use of sycamore maple, European mountain ash and Silesian willow did not prove well. The mixing of Norway spruce and European beech was demonstrated to have a significantly favourable influence on the growth of the two species. The root system was confined to humus horizons only and all individuals exhibited deformation into a tangle.

Rowan (Sorbus aucuparia) and aspen (Populus tremula) were preferred-food compared to pine and both silver birch (Betula pendula) and <b>pubescent</b> <b>birch</b> (B. pubescens). However, rowan and aspen were not capable of withstanding continuous browsing by moose owing to their diminished biomass.

The number of bites per available branch, as well as the maximum diameter of the bites, decreased as the density of the plantation increased. Silver birch was preferred to pubescent birch; planted silver birch was preferred to naturally regenerated trees. Main stem breakage was especially common in winter 1988; the average height of pine and birch was > 2 m. The tops of broken stems were commonly utilized as food. The increase in moose density and the relatively deep snow cover promoted the incidence of serious damage.

The reconstruction of past debris-flow activity was, in contrast, only very rarely based on growth anomalies in broad-leaved trees. Consequently, this study aimed at dating the occurrence of former debris flows from growth series of broad-leaved trees and at determining their suitability for dendrogeomorphic research. Results were obtained from gray alder (Alnus incana (L.) Moench), silver birch and <b>pubescent</b> <b>birch</b> (Betula pendula Roth and Betula pubescens Ehrh.), aspen (Populus tremula L.), white poplar, black poplar and gray poplar (Populus alba L., Populus nigra L. and Populus x canescens (Ait.) Sm.), goat willow (Salix caprea L.) and black elder (Sambucus nigra L.) injured by debris-flow activity at Illgraben (Valais, Swiss Alps). Tree-ring analysis of 104 increment cores, 118 wedges and 93 cross-sections from 154 injured broad-leaved trees allowed the reconstruction of 14 debris-flow events between AD 1965 and 2007. These events were compared with archival records on debris-flow activity at Illgraben. It appears that debris flows are very common at Illgraben, but only very rarely left the channel over the period AD 1965 – 2007. Furthermore, analysis of the spatial distribution of disturbed trees contributed to the identification of six patterns of debris-flow routing and led to the determination of preferential breakout locations of events. The results of this study demonstrate the high potential of broad-leaved trees for dendrogeomorphic research and for the assessment of the travel distance and lateral spread of debris-flow surges...|$|E
40|$|Increased risk of soil {{waterlogging}} {{in winter}} and spring at northern latitudes will potentially affect forest production in the future. We studied gas exchange, chlorophyll content index, chlorophyll fluorescence, nutrient concentration and biomass accumulation in 1 -year-old silver (Betula pendula Roth) and <b>pubescent</b> <b>birch</b> (Betula pubescens Ehrh.) seedlings. We hypothesized that B. pubescens has different physiological mechanisms that make it tolerate waterlogging better than B. pendula. The treatments were: (i) no waterlogging throughout the experiment; (ii) 4 -week waterlogging during dormancy (dormancy waterlogging `DW'); (iii) 4 -week waterlogging during the early growing season (growth waterlogging `GW'); and (iv) 4 -week DW followed by 4 -week GW during the early growing season (`DWGW'). Stomatal conductance and light-saturated net assimilation rate were reduced by GW in both species, and in B. pubescens also by DW. However, recovery was seen during the follow-up growing season. In B. pendula, DW, GW and DWGW temporarily resulted in reduced stem biomass, and GW and DWGW caused reduced leaf biomass. In B. pubescens, the stem biomass was decreased in GW and DWGW. Leaf nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) concentrations were generally low, and increased by GW, while potassium, calcium, magnesium and to some extent, boron and zinc concentrations decreased in both species and additionally manganese in B. pendula. The increases in N and P are mostly due to a concentration effect due to smaller leaf biomass, yet suggest that their uptake was not impaired. The decreases in cation concentrations {{are likely to be}} connected to impaired root functioning, which was not yet fully recovered from GW. We conclude that morphological acclimation to waterlogging of the leaves and roots rather than photosynthesis explains why B. pubescens is able to grow better in wetter areas than B. pendula...|$|E
40|$|A {{comparative}} study of shoot development in deciduous trees after cleaning of railway verges was carried out during the period 1999 - 2001. The trials were located in Långsele (Västernorrland County), Garsås (Dalarna County), Herrljunga (Västra Götaland County) and Tockarp (Skåne County). The methods of cleaning compared in the study were: motor-manual cleaning with normal stump height; motor-manual cleaning with low stump height; mechanical cleaning with a chain cutter once; mechanical cleaning with chain cutter annual three times (1999, 2000, 2001) and mechanical cleaning with a blade cutter. Cleaning operations were carried out April-June, 1999 - 2001. Tree species {{included in the study}} were <b>pubescent</b> <b>birch</b> (Betula pubescens Ehrh), pendula birch (Betula pendula Roth), aspen (Populus tremula L.), goat willow (Salix caprea L.) and common alder (Alnus glutinosa (L.) Gaertn.). Shoot density, shoot height and shoot diameter were estimated before cleaning. The effects of cleaning were evaluated by calculating annually for three years: the number of living stumps per m 2, the number of shoots per stump and the height of the shoots. The study had two objectives, namely to evaluate the biological effects of various vegetation cleaning methods and to act as a demonstration project for the Swedish Rail Authority and the Swedish Roads Authority, who commissioned the work. There were differences in stump height after cleaning using the different methods. In the four trials, stump height was 2 - 25 cm after mechanical cleaning with a chain cutter. After repeated mechanical cleaning of <b>pubescent</b> <b>birch</b> on peat soil (Herrljunga) with a chain cutter to leave 2 cm high stumps, there was a greater {{reduction in the number of}} shoots and a smaller number of living stumps compared with the other cleaning methods. The reason for this was that greater numbers of the stumps were totally destroyed or that higher placed sprouts were cut away. After repeated cleaning of clumps with several generations of stumps, there was also a tendency for the number of main stumps with sprouts to be reduced. After a single cleaning of birch, the choice of cleaning method had no effect on sprout development. The number and length of aspen suckers decreased after repeated mechanical cleaning in Långsele and a similar trend was observed in Tockarp. Grasses and herbaceous vegetation grew quickly and inhibited sucker development, particularly in Långsele. Aspen is very susceptible to fungal attack after repeated grazing and cleaning, which may explain this result. Goat willow was included in the study and was favoured in areas which had drainage water in the ditch below the railway embankment. Access on sloping embankments was often poor, which resulted in the stump height after mechanical cleaning being two to three times higher than on flat ground. In the Herrljunga trial, willow had many high placed spruts on the stump. Repeated cleaning or grazing gave rise to a bushy thicket. It could be seen in a number of sites that willow was particularly attractive to wild animals. Motor-manual cleaning with low stump height (average 8 - 18 cm) left a smaller number of uncleaned fast-growing sprouts remaining on the stump than mechanical cleaning with normal stump height (average 15 - 20 cm). It is easier to cut the main stump under a wide clump with a mechanical chain cutter than with a brush saw. The view from the track is affected by the density of the thicket (stems) and its maximum height. After three years growth in Garsås, the average height of the highest shoots per birch stump was 112 cm and the sprout (stem) density was 18. 2 sprouts per m 2. After seven years, the corresponding sprout height and density were 441 cm and 2. 9 sprouts per m 2. There were differences in height between treatments. Differences in shoot height were a result of the tree species, the site and the position in the country. Mechanical cleaning with a cutter chain thrashes the thicket apart completely. However, when the thicket is cut with a mechanical circular saw or by motor-manual cleaning, the cut brushwood can be collected. In Garsås, the production of birch biomass in track areas which were not cleared for seven years was 22 tonnes d. w. (dry weight) per ha along a kilometre of track with a 5 metre strip on each side. On the Herrljunga trial on peat soil, the total biomass production on a similar area with less dense thicket was 5. 6 tonnes d. w. per ha from six-year old sprouts of <b>pubescent</b> <b>birch.</b> The corresponding production from six-year aspen suckers was 6. 2 tonnes d. w. per ha in Långsele and 9. 7 tonnes d. w. per ha in Tockarp. The removal of the biomass probably prevented embankments being set on fire and reduced the green manure effect. There is also the advantage that the woody biomass removed can be utilised as a mulch or as a biofuel. Selective motor-manual cleaning of previously identified tree specimens was also included in the study. Two variants of selective motor-manual cleaning were tested, either sparing selected specimens or cleaning half the normal treatment area. Specimens that were spared were located at appropriate safety distances from the tracks and often had characteristic growth patterns and attractive flowering. Selective cleaning was carried out at all four sites, but was more successful in open landscape (Tockarp, Långsele) where the light allowed in helped to stimulate the undergrowth, which competed with suckers and stump sprouts from cleared trees. The effects of shoot formation and growth after different forms of repeated cleaning should be investigated further under more controlled conditions. The practicality and cost of selective mechanical cleaning should also be investigated...|$|E
40|$|The {{prescribed}} burning of a 7. 3 ha clear-cut and a 1. 7 ha partially cut forest (volume 150 m 3 /ha) {{was carried out}} in Evo (61 ° 12 'N, 25 ° 07 'E) on 1 June 1992. The forest was a mesic Myrtillus site type forest dominated by Norway spruce (Picea abies (L.) Karst.). Practically all the trees and the above-ground parts of the understorey vegetation died in the fire, while the mor layer was thinned by an average of 1. 5 cm. A study was made on the change of germinated seedling populations in time and their dependence on environmental factors. Seedlings of Norway spruce, Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.), silver birch (Betula pendula Roth), <b>pubescent</b> <b>birch</b> (B. pubescens Ehrh.) and rowan (Sorbus aucuparia L.) were inventoried in 1993 and in 1994 on permanent plots, four times per growing season. Autoregression models were used to compare regeneration of tree species in the burned forest with regeneration in the burnt clear-cut area, and to study the effect of distance from nearest seed source to regeneration. The average number of seedlings germinating in 1993 was higher than in 1994, probably because of differences between these consecutive years in regard to the amount of seed rain and weather conditions. The number of Norway spruce and rowan seedlings was higher inside the forest area than in the clear-cut area. The distance to the bordering forest and to the closest seed trees did not explain the result. It is suggested that the more stable microclimatic conditions under the shade of dead trees promote germination and seedling establishment in the forest area. As rowan is a bird-dispersed species, it is likely that dead trees help the dispersal of rowan seeds by providing birds places to sit and defecate. The shade provided by dead trees may influence the further succession of the tree stand and vegetation composition and diversity...|$|E

Gas concentrations were measured with an online cavity ring-down spectroscopy gas analyzer. Fluxes were calculated with both linear and exponential regression. The use of linear regression resulted in systematically smaller CH 4 fluxes by 10 – 45  % as compared to exponential regression. However, the use of exponential regression with small fluxes ([*]<[*]  2. 5  µg CH 4  m − 2  h − 1) typically resulted in anomalously large absolute fluxes and high hour-to-hour deviations. Therefore, we recommend that fluxes are initially calculated with linear regression to determine the threshold for low fluxes and that higher fluxes are then recalculated using exponential regression. The exponential flux was clearly affected by the length of the fitting period when this period was [*]<[*]  190  s, but stabilized with longer periods. Thus, we also recommend the use of a fitting period of several minutes to stabilize the results and decrease the flux detection limit. There were clear seasonal dynamics in the CH 4 flux: the forest floor acted as a CH 4 sink particularly from early summer {{until the end of the}} year, while in late winter the flux was very small and fluctuated around zero. However, the magnitude of fluxes was relatively small throughout the year, ranging mainly from − 130 to + 100  µg CH 4  m − 2  h − 1. CH 4 emission peaks were observed occasionally, mostly in summer during heavy rainfall events. Diurnal variation, showing a lower CH 4 uptake rate during the daytime, was observed in all of the chambers, mainly in the summer and late spring, particularly in dry conditions. It was attributed more to changes in wind speed than air or soil temperature, which suggest that physical rather than biological phenomena are responsible for the observed variation. The annual net CH 4 exchange varied from − 104  ±  30 to − 505  ±  39  mg CH 4  m − 2  yr − 1 among the six chambers, with an average of − 219  mg CH 4  m − 2  yr − 1 over the 2 -year measurement period...|$|E
40|$|Le {{district}} minier Saint-Véran (Hautes-Alpes) est connu pour avoir été exploité dès la fin du Chalcolithique et au Bronze ancien. Le minerai, une bornite massive très riche, était traité sur un atelier situé à 250 m en contrebas de la mine. Les travaux miniers les plus importants se situent sur la branche ouest du gîte à l’endroit appelé Tranchée des Anciens, où les mineurs ont exploité la veine verticale de minerai, comprise entre des quartzites et des chloritoschistes. L’exploitation en surface de la branche est du gîte est plus discrète. Mis à part quelques grattages vers 2 650 m d’altitude, le travail le plus intéressant se situe {{au niveau}} d’une recherche moderne (travers-banc 0). C’est une amorce de tranchée taillée au feu datée du début du Bronze ancien soit entre 3366 ± 42 BP (1750 - 1520 cal. BC [2 σ] : Tucson AA 58833) et 3524 ± 41 BP (1960 - 1730 cal. BC [2 σ] : Tucson AA 58831), ce qui est exceptionnel dans les Alpes. On y a observé une série de cuvettes thermiques creusées dans les schistes, résultant de l’allumage de foyers, remplies de charbons et de roches éclatées. Un foyer placé contre la paroi, dernier état d’une attaque abandonnée, a montré trois niveaux bien individualisés, dont le plus profond était riche en bois carbonisés. Un maillet en riébeckite a servi à détacher le minerai de la roche encaissante. Le charbon de bois issu du remplissage a permis de réaliser une étude anthracologique qui a corroboré les résultats déjà obtenus sur la mine et l’atelier. Les trois espèces arborescentes identifiées dans les échantillons révèlent un choix délibéré dans l’utilisation du combustible pour l’abattage au feu, en l’occurrence le pin cembro. Le mélèze et le bouleau sont anecdotiques, tandis que dans la mine la préférence est allée au pin sylvestre/ pin à crochets. L’étude confirme aussi que les hommes ont utilisé le bois qu’ils avaient à proximité, que la végétation alpine autour du site était bien plus forestière qu’elle ne l’est {{de nos jours}} et que l’activité minière a contribué à la déforestation du versant ainsi qu’à la raréfaction du pin cembro. The copper deposit of Clausis Saint-Véran (Hautes-Alpes, France) is a lens of ore included between an oceanic substratum, with serpentinite and shale, and a sedimentary cover with marble and quartzite with riebeckite. The sulphide ore is a high-grade massive bornite (45 / 65 % copper) associated with native copper. Prehistoric mining activity was located between 2 400 and 2 600 metres, and thus represents the highest mine in Europe for this period. The miners excavated the ore systematically in the oxidation rich outcrop, from the soft shale, {{in contact with the}} ore, up to a wall of quartzite. The mined ore was then taken down into the valley, 250 metres below the level of the mine, to the mineralogical/ metallurgical workshop of Cabane des Clausis for treatment. The metallurgists used all the technical processes necessary to change the ore into copper metal : hand-picking, washing, crushing and smelting. The earliest date obtained is 3815 ± 50 BP (2460 - 2140 cal. BC [2 σ] : Tucson AA 22621), cf. Barge, 2002 and 2003; Barge ed., 2006. On the main vein, the most important extraction was from an open cut called Tranchée des Anciens. In places, the irregular and rounded rock faces show tool-prints (fine grooves, hammer marks) resulting from green stone picks and grooved mauls. Numerous well-conserved waterlogged wood fragments (pit-props, floor planks, sticks from torches) have dated the exploitation to between 3656 ± 44 BP (2189 - 1888 cal. BC [2 σ] : Tucson AA 36604) and 3418 ± 43 BP (1877 - 1618 cal. BC [2 σ] : Tucson AA 36603). However the presence of charcoal remains is not necessarily proof of fire-setting in the mine, as they could come from torches. A second old mine working was discovered on the eastern branch of the copper deposit, {{at the top of the}} outcrop at an altitude of 2 650 m. Here, short excavations were dug into small secondary mineral veins (native copper ?). They show the prehistoric workers’ intensive search to collect copper ore from the slightest irregularities of the rock. Contrary to all expectations, traces of the fire-setting technique were found in this second zone, little studied previously. This exploitation, situated near a modern prospection (gallery no. 0) on a quartzite outcrop between shale and ophiolite, has been dated to the Early Bronze Age, between 3366 ± 42 BP (1750 - 1520 cal. BC [2 σ] : Tucson AA 58833) and 3524 ± 41 BP (1960 - 1730 cal. BC [2 σ] : Tucson AA 58831), which remains exceptional in the Southern Alps. This open cut, excavated over a surface of 5 m 2, show a succession of circular or oval thermal hollows containing broken stones and charcoals. These hollows are the result of successive and contiguous fires with a diameter of 0. 60 m. A hearth structure was preserved against the rock face and represents the last stage of an abandoned fire-setting attempt. The cross-section shows three particularly well characterised levels : a superficial filling material above a dense level of brown and grey sediments with numerous small plates of shale and quartz, then an unstable level with small plates of shale and quartz and charcoal. The ore was extracted with stone tools like those discovered in situ, including a riebeckite maul bearing percussion marks. Numerous small and dense cup-like marks are also visible on the green shale. More than one kilo of charcoals was collected during the excavation of the fire-setting open cut and from thermal hollows or hearths. From the point of view of species selection, it is obvious that the anthracological assemblage is not very rich. Only three species were identified, all trees. They were Pinus Cembra, largely dominant in our results, larch and <b>pubescent</b> <b>birch.</b> No shrubs, such as juniper, bilberry or rhododendron, were identified, pointing to a deliberate choice of the wood used. Pinus Cembra was especially selected for fire-setting, while larch and birch were merely occasional. On the contrary, the results of the anthracological study of the underground workings showed a preference for Norway pine/ Mugho pine. These results confirm those of the anthracological analysis of the fire-setting open cut, the underground workings and the mineralogical/ metallurgical workshop. Therefore, anthracological analysis of the material found in the fire-setting open cut at Saint-Veran provides interesting information about the choice of the combustible used preferentially for fire-setting, i. e. Pinus Cembra. It also proves that the alpine vegetation around the site was more wooded than at present and that prehistoric men used the wood found nearby. Thus, the mining activity largely contributed to deforestation of the mountainside and to rarefaction of the Pinus Cembra. Barge-Mahieu Hélène, Talon Brigitte.
