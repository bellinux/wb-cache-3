40|$|Graduation date: 1976 The {{purpose of}} this study was to assess {{reactions}} to and opinions about color and color performance by women ages 45 to 54 years. Hypotheses were developed to test relationships and differences between both perception and acceptance of color change and: 1) the three primary colors, 2) the two methods of sample presentation, 3) order in presentation of the single color level 5, and 4) how well the color was liked. Liking of the color of the original sample was compared to that of the faded samples. Average levels of acceptance were compared to the L 22 and Celanese performance standards. Interviews with 152 subjects were conducted under controlled conditions. Subjects were first shown single and then paired fabric samples. The samples used consisted of three intensely colored fabrics, red, blue, and yellow, with each color faded to five different levels according to the Gray Scale. While viewing the samples, the subjects answered several questions concerning perception of color changes, wearing garments of that color in public, and how well the color was liked. In comparing the percentages of perception and acceptance of color change, diverse differences for the three colors were evident. Thus, it was considered inappropriate to make comparisons among the three colors. The percentage of subjects perceiving color change generally varied directly with the amount of color change for all three colors. The acceptance of color change in red varied inversely with the amount of color change. Irregular results occurred in acceptance of yellow for the single presentation, but acceptance generally varied inversely with the amount of color change in the paired pre sentation. A significant number of subjects identified color differences in each color at level 5, where no difference actually existed. More subjects identified color differences at this level in the single presentation than in the paired. The two methods of sample presentation, single and <b>paired</b> <b>frames,</b> differed significantly for both perception and acceptance. There was a higher percentage of perception at all faded levels for the paired presentation, but the degree of acceptance tended to be higher for the single presentation. The order in which the level 5 sample was presented was found to have no significant effect on either perception or acceptance of color change in all colors. Subjects who clearly liked a color differed from those who disliked it in the perception of color change only for the upper levels of red and level 3. 5 of blue in the single presentation. The acceptance of color change as related to the degree a color was liked varied with the color and color level. The acceptance of color change was found to be similar for both ways it was assessed: 1) the amount of color change (nonmatching) and 2) harmonious blending. Levels of acceptance were compared to those standards established by Celanese and the USA Performance Requirements, L 22, and both generally appeared to be minimal when the responses of 75 percent of these subjects who identified color change were considered. Mean scores of color preference indicated that for blue and red, the colors of the original samples were preferred to most of the faded samples, but just the opposite was true for yellow. Overall, blue was rated the highest in preference of the three colors, with red second, and yellow last...|$|E

40|$|Abstract—In 3 D-wavelet video coding {{framework}} temporal filtering is done {{along the}} trajectory of motion using Motion Compensated Temporal Filtering (MCTF). Hence computationally efficient motion estimation technique is the need of MCTF. In this paper a predictive technique is proposed {{in order to reduce}} the computational complexity of the MCTF framework, by exploiting the high correlation among the frames in a Group Of Picture (GOP). The proposed technique applies coarse and fine searches of any fast block based motion estimation, only to the first <b>pair</b> of <b>frames</b> in a GOP. The generated motion vectors are supplied to the next consecutive frames, even to subsequent temporal levels and only fine search is carried out around those predicted motion vectors. Hence coarse search is skipped for all the motion estimation in a GOP except for the first <b>pair</b> of <b>frames.</b> The technique has been tested for different fast block based motion estimation algorithms over different standard test sequences using MC-EZBC, a state-of-the-art scalable video coder. The simulation result reveals substantial reduction (i. e. 20. 75 % to 38. 24 %) in the number of search points during motion estimation, without compromising the quality of the reconstructed video compared to non-predictive techniques. Since the motion vectors of all the <b>pair</b> of <b>frames</b> in a GOP except the first pair will have value ± 1 around the motion vectors of the previous <b>pair</b> of <b>frames,</b> the number of bits required for motion vectors is also reduced by 50 %.
