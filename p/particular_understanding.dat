Europa Barbarorum retains this basic gameplay mechanic and sets itself in a similar time period and geographical area to {{the original}} game. However, as a total conversion the mod replaces the particular factions, military units, buildings, and other elements present in the original game, and adds a new soundtrack and several brand-new gameplay mechanics not present in the original, such as the installation of puppet rulers. The modification's development team's stated aim in making the changes that they have to Rome: Total War is to make the player's experience of the ancient world more historically accurate. For this reason, numerous parameters of the game {{at the start of the}} campaign in 272 BC, such as generals' names, the diplomatic relations between factions, and the <b>particular</b> <b>understanding</b> of the outside world that each faction has, have been set to correspond to the actual political situation in that year.|$|E

2500|$|As was {{frequently}} noted at the time, and Hazlitt reminds his readers, Lord Eldon delights in investigating the mazes of the law, and will prolong a case {{as necessary to}} decide fairly between participants in a legal matter; and the decision, however protracted the delay, might well be a fair one. But when the matter {{is one in which}} deciding against the continuance of royal or noble privilege would risk disapproval of the king or lord, however long Eldon's delay, the ruling is invariably in favor of established prerogative. In this, Hazlitt notes, Eldon has been consistent, [...] "a thorough-bred Tory ... an out-and-outer". Hazlitt supports his contention by following it with a list of issue after issue in which, by backing royal and aristocratic privilege, Eldon has decided in favor of maintaining abuses of individual rights. The Lord Chancellor does this not out of malice; his persistent failure to sympathise with the suffering of the common man is due to his blindness to it. This in turn is enabled by the persistent underlying support of royal favor, along with other motives: [...] "The King's hand is velvet to the touch—the Woolsack is a seat of honour and profit!" [...] Nor has he any <b>particular</b> <b>understanding</b> of the plight of the common man through [...] "strong feeling [...] principle." [...] And in this (Hazlitt here continues his psychological explanation) he follows a common human tendency: [...] "Where remote and speculative objects do not excite a predominant interest and passion, gross and immediate ones are sure to carry the day, even in ingenuous and well-disposed minds." ...|$|E

The proconsul obliged some of them and then sent the rest away, saying that if they wanted to kill themselves there was plenty of rope available or cliffs they could jump off." [...] Such seeking after death is found in Tertullian's Scorpiace and in the letters of Saint Ignatius of Antioch but was not the only view of martyrdom in the early Christian church. The 2nd century text Martyrdom of Polycarp relates the story of Polycarp, bishop of Smyrna, who did not desire death, but died a martyr, bound and burned at the stake, then stabbed when the fire miraculously failed to touch him. The Martyrdom of Polycarp advances an argument for a <b>particular</b> <b>understanding</b> of martyrdom, with Polycarp’s death as its prized example. The example of the Phrygian Quintus, who actively sought out martyrdom, is repudiated.|$|E
