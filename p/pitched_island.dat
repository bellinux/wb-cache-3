50|$|Pikisaari (literally <b>Pitch</b> <b>island</b> in Finnish) is a {{neighbourhood}} of {{the city}} of Oulu, Finland. The neighbourhood consists of Pikisaari and Korkeasaari islands connected due to the post-glacial rebound. Pikisaari is located near the city centre in the estuary of Oulujoki River in between market square and Hietasaari island.|$|R

40|$|As {{early as}} {{possible}} after Lieutenant-Governor Collins began his settlement at Hobart Town, on the memorable 21 st February, 1804, a marquee was doubtless pitched {{for the purposes of}} the General Hospital. Whether the General Hospital was set up at Hobart Town before or after the landing of the second detachment is unknown at the present time. Nor is it known so far whether the marquee for the patients was <b>pitched</b> on Hunter <b>Island</b> or within 'the camp,' possibly on a site not far distant from what was designated in print twelve years later as Hospital Hill...|$|R
50|$|Since 1950 {{football}} {{has been}} {{played on the}} Cayman Islands, but there were still no football <b>pitches</b> on the <b>islands.</b> It was not until 1960, thanks to Clifton Hunter and Timothy McField, that a sports field - The Annex - was built in Georgetown. Clifton Hunter worked parallel in West Bay, driving the development of football. During this time a rivalry between the two districts, the capital region and the West Bay region, which still exists today, developed. For a long time the two football pitches in Georgetown and West Bay were the only places in the country.|$|R
40|$|The new island {{divertor}} in W 7 -AS enables quasi steady-state {{operation with}} NBI {{at very high}} density including scenarios with stable detachment from the targets. Experiments with reversed B-field indicate that the interaction zones on the targets are affected in first order by E×B drifts. Stable detachment is restricted to magnetic field configurations with sufficiently large separation between x-points and targets and not too small field line <b>pitch</b> inside the <b>islands.</b> It is always partial {{in the sense that}} it does not extend over the full target area. This inhomogeneity is ascribed to an in/out asymmetry of the electron temperature at the upstream separatrix position...|$|R
50|$|During the 1980s {{almost all}} <b>pitches</b> on the <b>islands</b> {{were covered with}} {{artificial}} grass, and {{now more than ever}} the pitches are the public playground (outside training and match hours) for the kids in particular. Many of the grounds aren't real stadiums, as several of them have no seats for the supporters, you have to stand up under no cover, often in harsh weather conditions and watch the matches, which usually attract approx. 300 to 1,000 people in the top division. The first official competitive match against Austria was played in Sweden, because there was no suitable grass pitches in the Faroe Islands at that time. Most teams played on artificial pitches, but a few still played on sand pitches.|$|R
40|$|Three {{groups of}} {{monolingual}} listeners, with Standard Chinese, Dutch and Hungarian as their native language, judged pairs of trisyllabic stimuli which differed {{only in their}} itch pattern. The segmental structure of the stimuli was made up by the experimenters and presented to subjects as being taken from a little-known language spoken on a South Pacific <b>island.</b> <b>Pitch</b> patterns consisted of a single rise-fall located {{on or near the}} second syllable. By and large, listeners selected the stimulus with the higher peak, the later eak, and the higher end rise as the one that signalled a question, regardless of language group. The result is argued to reflect innate, non-linguistic knowledge of the meaning of pitch variation, notably Ohala’s Frequency Code. A significant difference between groups is explained as due to the influence of the mother tongue...|$|R
5|$|The Faroe Islands {{national}} football team represents the Faroe Islands in association football and {{is controlled by}} the Faroe Islands Football Association (FSF), the governing body of the sport in the country. It competes {{as a member of the}} Union of European Football Associations (UEFA), which encompasses the countries of Europe. Organised football has been played in the country since the 19th century; Tvøroyrar Bóltfelag was its first club, founded in 1892. Initially, clubs played friendlies to determine the winner of an unofficial championship, with matches being contested home and away, depending on the weather and the state of the generally uneven grass <b>pitches.</b> The Faroe <b>Islands</b> Sports Association was formed in 1939, and three years later a national league was created. Cup competitions were introduced in 1955 before the FSF was founded on 13 January 1979.|$|R
5000|$|Set up in 1633, {{a private}} pitch boilery started to produce pitch (by boiling tar) on the <b>island,</b> <b>pitch</b> {{at the time}} being both {{frequently}} used at the city's abundant shipyards and an important national trade item. The operations must have had quite an impact, since Queen Christina (1626-1689) when handing the area over to the city in 1647, explains she wished to see storehouses built on Bäck- eller Tiärholmen (The [...] "Pitch" [...] or [...] "Tar Islet") for [...] "the advantage and benefit {{of the city and}} the residents". Thus having both its name and reputation set, the islet was bestowed a tar distilling workshop, originally intended for the north-eastern shores of Södermalm, replacing the boilery during the 1680s. Private entrepreneurs took charge of the island in 1717 and, in spite of a devastating fire in 1723, developed it into an important part of their trading house.|$|R
40|$|Two very {{contrary}} particle confinement stages {{were obtained}} at TEXTOR-DED by application of resonant magnetic perturbations. On {{the one hand}} a spontaneous build up {{of the total number}} of particles N-tot with correlated increase in the particle confinement time tau(p) was observed and on the other hand a controlled decrease of N-tot and tau(p) - the so called stochastic particle pump out is seen. Numerical analysis of the perturbed magnetic field topology shows that both domains can be distinguished by the ratio of short connection length field lines touching a specific resonant flux surface (here the q = 5 / 2 surface) to the complete perturbed layer width. During improved particle confinement, the hyperbolic fixed points (X-points) of the <b>pitch</b> resonant <b>islands</b> are directly connected to the DED target followed by an less than or similar to 40 % increase in tau(p). The subsequent increase in the E x B shear rate Omega(ExB) at the q = 5 / 2 surface and a steepening of del n(e) (r) suggests a reduction of the radial particle transport. On the opposite, complete stochastisation of this island chain, i. e. a predominant diffusive field line characteristics, causes a less than or similar to 30 % decrease of tau(p) with a reduction in Omega(ExB) at the q = 5 / 2 surface and del n(e) (r) indicating enhanced effective outward particle transport.

2500|$|Arthur Grimble, {{a future}} Resident Commissioner of the Gilbert and Ellice Islands colony, recounted in his memoir, A Pattern of Islands, that cricket was [...] "going strong" [...] on Ocean Island (now Banaba Island) {{at the time}} of his arrival in 1914. Ten years later, {{according}} to Grimble, it was [...] "popular everywhere" [...] in the islands, although it subsequently declined. Cricket was still regularly played on Ocean Island in the 1950s, where there were two main teams – one featuring mainly Australians and New Zealanders employed by the British Phosphate Commission, and the other featuring members of the local police force, who were predominantly indigenous Gilbertese.

5000|$|Faroe Islands {{pulled one}} of the biggest upsets in footballing history when they beat Austria 1-0 in their first ever {{competitive}} international on 12 September 1990. The game, a Euro 92 qualifier, was played in Landskrona, Sweden, because there were no grass <b>pitches</b> on the <b>Islands.</b> Torkil Nielsen, a salesman for his local builders company scored the goal. 32 year old national coach Páll Guðlaugsson became a folk hero overnight, and is today remembered by his players as a fearless character, who always believed that the Faroe Islands could get a result against the bigger nations. In his self-biography, national goalkeeper Jens Martin Knudsen revealed that Guðlaugsson held a stunning pre-match speech, that boosted the players confidence prior to the match against the Austrians. Guðlaugsson pre-match speech goes; [...] "Think of the Faroese flag. Your flag. Take it with you on that field. Throw yourself into the tackles against those arrogant Austrians with one mission - to win the game for your nation. Tonight you pay back your childhood home. You have the opportunity now and it is an irrepaple blow if you don't cease it!" [...] The win was against all odds and to this day, this is the story about Faroese football - and the story about sports in the Faroe Islands. American sports magazine Soccerphile rated the Faroese victory number 10 of all-time football greatest upsets.|$|R
50|$|Starting about 1865, {{the river}} was used for massive logging drives from Third Connecticut Lake to {{initially}} water powered sawmills near Enfield Falls. Trees cut adjacent to tributary streams including Perry Stream and Indian Stream in Pittsburg, New Hampshire, Halls Stream on the Quebec-New Hampshire border, Simms Stream, the Mohawk River, and the Nulhegan River basin in Essex County, Vermont, would be flushed into the main river by the release of water impounded behind splash dams. Several log drivers died trying to move logs through Perry Falls in Pittsburg. Teams of men would wait at Canaan, Vermont, to protect the bridges from log jams. Men guided logs through a 400 ft drop {{along the length of}} Fifteen-Mile Falls (now submerged under Moore and Comerford reservoirs), and through Logan's Rips at Fitzdale, Mulligan's Lower <b>Pitch,</b> and Seven <b>Islands.</b> The White River from Vermont and Ammonoosuc River from New Hampshire brought more logs into the Connecticut. A log boom was built between Wells River, Vermont, and Woodsville, New Hampshire, to hold the logs briefly and release them gradually to avoid jams in the Ox Bow. Men detailed to this work utilized Woodsville's saloons and red-light district. Some of the logs were destined for mills in Wilder and Bellows Falls, Vermont, while others were sluiced over the Bellows Falls dam. North Walpole, New Hampshire, contained twelve to eighteen saloons, patronized by the log drivers. Mount Tom was the landmark the log drivers used to gauge the distance to the final mills near Holyoke, Massachusetts. These spring drives were stopped after 1915, when pleasure boat owners complained about the hazards to navigation. The final drive included 500 workers controlling 65 million feet of logs. A final pulp drive consisted of 100,000 cords of four-foot logs in 1918. This was {{to take advantage of the}} wartime demand.|$|R
