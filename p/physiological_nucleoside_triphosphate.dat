40|$|Measurements of {{nucleoside}} triphosphate levels in Saccharomyces cerevisiae {{reveal that the}} four rNTPs are in 36 - to 190 -fold molar excess over their corresponding dNTPs. During DNA synthesis in vitro using the <b>physiological</b> <b>nucleoside</b> <b>triphosphate</b> concentrations, yeast DNA polymerase ε, which is implicated in leading strand replication, incorporates one rNMP for every 1, 250 dNMPs. Pol δ and Pol α, which conduct lagging strand replication, incorporate one rNMP for every 5, 000 or 625 dNMPs, respectively. Discrimination against rNMP incorporation varies widely, in some cases by more than 100 -fold, depending on {{the identity of the}} base and the template sequence context in which it is located. Given estimates of the amount of replication catalyzed by Pols α, δ, and ε, the results are consistent with the possibility that more than 10, 000 rNMPs may be incorporated into the nuclear genome during each round of replication in yeast. Thus, rNMPs may be the most common noncanonical nucleotides introduced into the eukaryotic genome. Potential beneficial and negative consequences of abundant ribonucleotide incorporation into DNA are discussed, including the possibility that unrepaired rNMPs in DNA could be problematic because yeast DNA polymerase ε has difficulty bypassing a single rNMP present within a DNA template...|$|E
40|$|The guanine nucleotide-binding protein Ras {{exists in}} {{solution}} {{in two different}} conformational states when complexed with different GTP analogs such as GppNHp or GppCH 2 p. State 1 has only a very low affinity to effectors {{and seems to be}} recognized by guanine nucleotide exchange factors, whereas state 2 represents the high affinity effector binding state. In this work we investigate Ras in complex with the <b>physiological</b> <b>nucleoside</b> <b>triphosphate</b> GTP. By polarization transfer 31 P NMR experiments and effector binding studies we show that Ras(wt) ·Mg 2 +·GTP also exists in a dynamical equilibrium between the weakly populated conformational state 1 and the dominant state 2. At 278 K the equilibrium constant between state 1 and state 2 of C-terminal truncated wild-type Ras(1 – 166) K 12 is 11. 3. K 12 of full-length Ras is > 20, suggesting that the C terminus may also have a regulatory effect on the conformational equilibrium. The exchange rate (kex) for Ras(wt) ·Mg 2 +·GTP is 7 s− 1 and thus 18 -fold lower compared with that found for the Ras·GppNHp complex. The intrinsic GTPase activity substantially increases after effector binding for the switch I mutants Ras(Y 32 F), (Y 32 R), (Y 32 W), (Y 32 C/C 118 S), (T 35 S), and the switch II mutant Ras(G 60 A) by stabilizing state 2, with the largest effect on Ras(Y 32 R) with a 13 -fold increase compared with wild-type. In contrast, no acceleration was observed in Ras(T 35 A). Thus Ras in conformational state 2 has a higher affinity to effectors as well as a higher GTPase activity. These observations can be used to explain why many mutants have a low GTPase activity but are not oncogenic...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: The DHH {{superfamily}} human protein h-prune, {{a binding}} {{partner of the}} metastasis suppressor nm 23 -H 1, is frequently overexpressed in metastatic cancers. From an evolutionary perspective, h-prune {{is very close to}} eukaryotic exopolyphosphatases. Here, we show {{for the first time that}} h-prune efficiently hydrolyzes short-chain polyphosphates (kcat of 3 - 40 s- 1), including inorganic tripoly- and tetrapolyphos-phates and nucleoside 5 ′-tetraphosphates. Long-chain inorganic polyphosphates (g 25 phosphate residues) are converted more slowly, whereas pyrophosphate and <b>nucleoside</b> <b>triphosphates</b> are not hydrolyzed. The reaction requires a divalent metal cofactor, such as Mg 2 +, Co 2 +, or Mn 2 +, which activates both the enzyme and substrate. Notably, the exopolyphosphatase activity of h-prune is suppressed by nm 23 -H 1, long-chain polyphosphates and pyrophosphate, which may be potential <b>physiological</b> regulators. <b>Nucleoside</b> <b>triphosphates,</b> diadenosine hexaphosphate, cAMP, and dipyridamole (inhibitor of phosphodiesterase) do not affect this activity. Mutation of seven single residues corresponding to those found in the active site of yeast exopolyphosphatase led to a severe decrease in h-prune activity, whereas one variant enzyme exhibited enhanced activity. Our results collectively suggest that prune is the missing exopolyphosphatase in animals and support the hypothesis that the metastatic effects of h-prune are modulated by inorganic polyphosphates, which are increasingly recognized as critical regulators in cells...|$|R
