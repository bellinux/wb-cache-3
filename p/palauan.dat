5|$|During the Japanese colonial-era, a {{sizeable}} minority of mixed-race Japanese-Palauans emerged. Japanese-Palauans were offsprings of intermarriages between Japanese men and <b>Palauan</b> women. Most of them lived in urban areas, and {{were brought up}} in accordance to Japanese norms and values and spoke Japanese in their daily lives. A few sought further education in Japan, {{and at the same}} time had limited knowledge of <b>Palauan</b> customs and language, although children that were born out of wedlock reportedly had a greater exposure to their matrilineal customs and spoke both Japanese and <b>Palauan</b> fluently. Although Japanese-Palauan children were generally classified as Japanese in official figures and had access to Japanese social privileges, many reportedly faced discrimination when placed in Japanese and <b>Palauan</b> circles. In rural areas where Palauans formed higher concentrations, spouses and mistresses of Japanese men were shunned upon, and <b>Palauan</b> nationalists (especially Modekngei) actively discouraged mixed unions between Japanese men and <b>Palauan</b> women. The Japanese government encouraged such intermarriages, and provided social benefits to women who had married Japanese men. However, only unions with civilian men were recognised and military personnel were prohibited from marrying <b>Palauan</b> women, although they were allowed to keep mistresses. The civilian government suppressed unions between <b>Palauan</b> men and Japanese women, and there was only one known case of a union between a <b>Palauan</b> man and a Japanese woman during the Japanese colonial-era.|$|E
5|$|During the Japanese colonial era, Japanese {{settlers}} mainly used Japanese {{in their}} daily discourse, and Japanese was the lingua franca used for communication between Japanese and Palauans. English was also recognised as a co-official language along with Japanese, and many Japanese had at least some knowledge of the language as well. People of mixed Japanese-Palauan heritage were more competent in Japanese than to <b>Palauan,</b> especially those who attended mainstream primary schools. The Japanese also introduced {{the use of the}} Katakana script in <b>Palauan,</b> which was also used in informal settings. After the Japanese surrender, the use of Japanese was discouraged in place of <b>Palauan</b> and English. Most Japanese-Palauans use <b>Palauan</b> {{in their daily}} discourse in favour of Japanese or English, although Japanese was used more frequently among Japanese-Palauans than to those that do not have Japanese ancestry. As the number of Japanese tourists increased during the 1990s, Japanese was introduced as an elective subject to <b>Palauan</b> schools and in elections.|$|E
5|$|Second and third-generation {{descendants}} of Japanese-Palauans who were descended from earlier settlers generally chose to remain behind, although {{those who were}} raised in Japanese-speaking families reportedly faced trouble conversing in <b>Palauan.</b> Most retained their Japanese surnames, but Japanese-Paluans generally identified themselves as Palauans after the war. Second-generation Japanese-Palauans usually married <b>Palauan</b> women, and became assimilated with the local <b>Palauan</b> populace. In terms of self-identification, Japanese-Palauans usually emphasised their Japanese identities only on occasions when they associate with other Japanese, for instance when they participate in memorial services for Japanese soldiers who died during the Pacific War. Some Japanese-Palauans also chose {{to be buried in}} Japanese cemeteries after their deaths, notably those in Koror.|$|E
50|$|Many <b>Palauans</b> live in California, most notably, Pasadena. <b>Palauans</b> also live in Portland, Oregon, {{where a few}} {{thousand}} Micronesians live, and Corsicana, Texas.|$|R
50|$|Since {{the late}} 1940s, many <b>Palauans</b> have emigrated abroad. In 1953, {{about a hundred}} people from Palau founded the Palau Association in the American island of Guam. Over the years, the number of <b>Palauans</b> has {{continually}} grown.|$|R
5000|$|In January 2008, Whipps {{proposed}} a bill requiring {{the minimum wage}} to apply not just to <b>Palauans,</b> but to non-resident workers as well. It was reasoned that this would help more <b>Palauans</b> to become employed, due to the increased cost of hiring non-resident workers.|$|R
5|$|After the Japanese {{surrender}} in 1945, Japanese settlers were repatriated back to Japan, {{and male}} Japanese settlers who had raised Japanese-Palauan families abandoned {{their families in}} favour of repatriation, reasoning that the offspring {{would be able to}} better adapt in Palau than in Japan. Many of these <b>Palauan</b> women raised their mixed-race children singlehandedly, while others were abandoned and adopted by <b>Palauan</b> families. Some Japanese-Palauan families migrated to Japan, but generally faced a cultural shock and petitioned to return to Palau after living in Japan for some years. Most petitions were allowed, although they were not allowed to bring their Japanese spouses along.|$|E
5|$|When the Japanese {{surrendered}} in 1945, Japanese business {{enterprises and}} organisations in Palau closed, effectively ending the Japanese influence on Palau's economy. In {{the first two}} decades after the war, the American occupation government imposed strict trade restrictions with Japan. Contact with Japan was reestablished in the 1960s, starting with Okinawan fishermen who were granted fishing rights. Japanese tourists began to visit Palau in increasing numbers from the mid-1970s. The growing influx of tourists to Palau led to the restoration of heritage sites around Palau, particularly memorial sites and administrative buildings built in the Japanese era as well as <b>Palauan</b> longhouses to accommodate {{to the interests of}} Japanese tourists, which accounted for half of all visiting tourists. Many of Palau's tourist sites were run and maintained by <b>Palauan</b> citizens of Japanese-Palauan heritage, whose knowledge in Japanese and <b>Palauan</b> customs and languages helped to facilitate tour groups consisting of Japanese tourists.|$|E
5|$|As the Great Depression {{resulted}} in massive {{unemployment in the}} late 1920s and 1930s, more Japanese and Okinawans migrated to Palau. Immigrants brought along their families and sought employment in various professions. The Japanese immigrants held administrative posts, while the Okinawans and a few Koreans worked as labourers in the agricultural, fishery and mining industries. By 1935, the Japanese constituted at least 60% of Palau's population and were concentrated in urban areas such as Angaur and Koror. Some Japanese settlers took <b>Palauan</b> wives or mistresses, {{and there was a}} sizeable minority of mixed Japanese-Palauan children towards the later years of the Japanese administration.|$|E

50|$|The {{population}} of Palau is approximately 21,000, of whom 70% are native <b>Palauans</b> of mixed Melanesian, and Austronesian descent. There are many Asian communities within Palau. Filipinos form the largest Asian group and second largest ethnic {{group in the}} country. There are significant numbers of Chinese and Koreans. There are also smaller numbers of <b>Palauans</b> of mixed or full Japanese ancestry. Smaller numbers of Bangladeshi and Nepalese migrant workers and their descendants {{who came to the}} islands during the late 1900s can also be found. Most <b>Palauans</b> of Asian origin came during the late 1900s with many Filipinos, Chinese, Bangladeshis and Nepalese coming to Palau as unskilled workers and professionals. There are also small numbers of Europeans and Americans.|$|R

5|$|Palau's {{interaction}} with Japan was {{kept to a}} minimal level during the post-war years, although Okinawan fishermen occasionally visited Palau for catches from the 1960s onwards. A few Japanese nationals resettled in Palau in the 1970s, and married local Palauans. In the 1980s, Japanese businessmen set up businesses in Palau, and by 1995 there were 218 Japanese nationals residing in Palau. Of these, {{about half of them}} expressed a desire for permanent residency in Palau and a few married <b>Palauan</b> or Filipino women. However, the majority brought their families from Japan along, and maintained frequent contacts with Japan. Some settlers from the 1980s also consisted of former Japanese settlers who were repatriated back to Japan after World War II. Former settlers who returned to Palau usually consisted of individuals over 60 years of age, and often worked as tour guides or restaurateurs in Palau.|$|E
5|$|The Japanese navy {{expanded}} their military facilities from 1937 onwards. More labourers from Japan and Korea {{were employed to}} construct the facilities to complete the facilities within {{a short period of}} time. The number of indentured labourers rose to more than 10,000 throughout Micronesia, and placed a heavy strain on the islands' scarce resources. Many Okinawan and Japanese labourers and permanent settlers were repartriated back to their homeland. Japanese men were conscripted into regular services, and Palauans who held administrative posts in the police force were reallocated jobs in the agricultural sector. The Japanese civilians {{played an important role in}} the islands' propaganda activities. As food resources were cut off from Japan, many Japanese encountered greater difficulties in dealing with starvation than their <b>Palauan</b> counterparts, who were more knowledgeable with tropical survival skills.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} years of {{civilian}} administration, the Japanese population consisted of about a few hundred individuals, and reached a little over 2,000 by 1930. The Japanese resident population increased at an exponential rate from the mid-1930s onwards, and there were about 15,000 Japanese in Palau by 1938, the vast majority of whom were concentrated in Koror. The influx of Japanese immigrants fuelled the development of Koror into a city by 1939. The Palauans were quickly outnumbered by the Japanese, and constituted only about 16 percent of the city's population in 1937. The Japanese made up {{more than half of the}} islands' population, as well as 27% of Micronesia's Japanese population in a 1938 census. A large minority of the Japanese populace consisted of Okinawan immigrants, as well as a few Koreans. Palau's Japanese population was repatriated after the Japanese surrender, but people of Japanese-Palauan descent remained behind and constitute a large minority of Palau's population. A study done by the Sasakawa Pacific Island Nations Fund estimated that about 10% of Palauans are born to a Japanese father and <b>Palauan</b> mother, the vast majority of whom were born before 1945. Another study done by the Foundation for Advanced Studies in International Development from Japan in 2005 estimates that about 25% of Palau's populace have some Japanese ancestry.|$|E
5000|$|Vanderklippe {{reported}} that the men had never felt they could {{fit in with the}} <b>Palauans.</b> [...] Some of the men compared Palau with a lusher, larger Guantanamo. Some of the men were able to bring their wives to Palau. Attempts to hold most regular jobs failed, due to cultural differences. Attempts to use their traditional leather-working skills to be self-employed failed. Eventually, all six men were employed as night-time security guards, a job that did not require interaction with <b>Palauans.</b>|$|R

50|$|During the German era, the Germans {{passed laws}} that <b>Palauans</b> {{must work to}} grow various plants, those refusing {{would be sent to}} Ngebuked for imprisonment. This is one reasons {{explaining}} the many coconuts in Palau. Germans also outlawed marriage and any religion except Catholicism. Some people of Ngaraard moved to Angaur to work in the phosphate mines. Later, doctors from Angaur traveled to Ngebuked because of an outbreak of leprosy, sending the sick to Melekeok for healing. The leprosy outbreak resulted in the deaths of many <b>Palauans.</b>|$|R

25|$|Baseball {{was first}} brought to Palau by the Japanese, who annexed the islands from Germany in 1914 and {{controlled}} them until losing the Battle of Peleliu in November 1944. One noted early promoter of baseball {{on the islands}} was Motoji Kono, {{who worked for the}} Imperial Japanese government on Palau from 1922 to 1929. He is credited with a foundational role in <b>Palauan</b> baseball for his work teaching <b>Palauan</b> men the basic skill sets and rules necessary to play the game, as well as being an energetic promoter of the sport, primarily from 1925 onwards. Most <b>Palauan</b> players in the 1920s were employed with the Japanese administration on the island.|$|E

25|$|Marine {{biologist}} Michael Dawson {{proposed that}} the golden jellyfish that inhabit Jellyfish Lake be classified as a subspecies (Mastigias cf. papua etpisoni) of the spotted jellyfish living in the nearby lagoons. The species identification is uncertain (denoted by cf. in the name) because the Mastigias papua local to <b>Palauan</b> lagoons may be {{only one of several}} cryptic species that make up the M. papua group, and in the future, the M. papua local to Palau may be identified as a separate species from other M. papua. He also {{proposed that the}} jellyfish living in four other <b>Palauan</b> marine lakes were distinctive enough to deserve recognition as unique subspecies.|$|E

40|$|Until {{the early}} part of this century, a {{thorough}} knowledge of their world was essential to the well-being of the people of the islands now known as Palau. Largely isolated, the <b>Palauans</b> would surely have faced starvation if they had irreversibly upset the natural balance of their environment. Eco-consciousness was intrinsic to their everyday life and cultural perspectives. With the arrival of various colonizers, Palau was propelled, virtually overnight, from a subsistence economy to one that involved trading inter-nationally and exposure to previously unknown goods. The presence of foreign governments and the emergence of a trade-based economy eroded traditional conservation practices, leaving an ethical vacuum as the peo-ple struggled to adjust to new guiding principles. The next decades were marked by overharvesting of marine and land resources and overall degra-dation of the environment through pollution and modern development activities. Today, although degradation continues at an ever-increasing pace, there is hope as many are witnessing firsthand the costs of such behavior. Despite the overwhelming impact of foreign lifestyles, the core of many traditional beliefs, values, and practices has survived. <b>Palauans</b> are still closely tied to the land and the sea. Nevertheless, the changes that have occurred in the last century require traditions that once met the needs of the community to undergo further modification in order to adjust to the modern lifestyle that <b>Palauans</b> are adopting...|$|R
