The formation of the atrium has been described. The metapleural folds run forward in front of the velum, as the epipleurs (ep. in Sections 1 and 2), and form an oral hood (b.c.), around which the tentacles appear, and which is evidently not equivalent to the vertebrate mouth cavity, but in front of and outside it.

We further exposed X. tropicalis embryos to TPT during different stages. Severe malformations {{were observed}} in the embryos after exposure to 5 - 10 mu gSn/L TPT during S 32 - 40 and S 40 - 46. Comparatively, the embryos showed slight or moderate malformations after exposure during S 10 - 25, S 25 - 32 or S 46 - 47. The most characteristic malformations were narrow or no fins, followed by enlarged <b>proctodaeums</b> and skin hypopigmentation. The developed fins were still affected after TPT exposure, but the inhibited fins could not recover even after the removal of TPT exposure. In TPT treatment groups, the <b>proctodaeums</b> of embryos externally expanded, and the pigment cells of embryos were poor, small and dot like. Our results suggested that TPT-induced teratogenicity was highly stage-specific. The sensitive window of fin defects indicated that TPT affected the formation rather than induction or expansion of fins. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved...|$|R

The present study on the anatomy and histomorphology of alimentary tract of adult weevil is one of the striking scientific aspects as the stage has to propagate the pests race. The digestive tract is tubular and coiled structure having 39 - 42 mm in length measuring almost double the length of the body (measuring 18 - 22 mm long). The tract is divisible into Stomodaeum or foregut measuring 9 - 11 mm. in length, Mesenteron or Midgut is 20 - 22 mm in length and <b>Proctodaeum</b> or Hindgut measuring 10 - 11 mm in length. These parts are well demarcated by the presence of distinct grooves.

The <b>proctodaeum</b> is proximal to the cloacal vent and houses the genitalia. The urodaeum is the largest chamber, is capable of storing large quantities of urine, and is lined with an epithelium with the capacity for transepithelial water and ion exchange. The coprodaeum, the most orad cloacal chamber, is a small, only marginally expandable chamber that has an epithelium composed almost entirely of mucus-secreting cells. The coprodaeum and lower intestine are reported to be the site(s) for urine modification in birds and bladderless lizards.

Instead, urine was stored in the urodaeum of C. porosus. Examination of the mucosal surface of the urodaeum by SEM showed a plastic response to environmental salinity, with a possible increase in surface area in animals kept in hyperosmotic water compared with animals from fresh water.

40|$|Dysdercus koenigi has {{two pairs}} of Malpighian tubules, each pair arising from a vesicle and forming a closed loop. The vesicles are {{connected}} dorsally, and the tubules are differentiated into proximal and distal regions with refractive granules in the latter and brush border in both. In winters at Allahabad the embryonic period lasts about a fortnight, and on the 9 th day, 4 small buds arise apparently from the anterior end of the <b>proctodaeum.</b> These grow rapidly and become tubular; their tips fuse, but the lumina remain separate. At this stage the met-enteric membrane (Henson, 1946 a) stretches over the anterior end of the <b>proctodaeum</b> and an interstitial ring is differentiated, so that the zone {{of the origin of}} the tubules lies anteriorly to it and posteriorly to the met-enteric mem-brane. Meanwhile the basal part of each tubule swells and the two swellings of each side fuse, thus forming a vesicle on each side. A dorsal outgrowth from each vesicle meets its fellow of the opposite side. The tubules continue to elongate, at the same time becoming narrower, and ultimately only 3 cells can be seen in a cross-section. The tubules grow in 3 phases—(1) active mitosis, (2) of cell multiplication and cell rearrangement, and (3) of cell rearrangement and cell enlargement. Finally, the tips of each pair fuse completely and their lumina become continuous. In the newly hatched first nymph the tubules are uniform throughout, but in the later part of this stage they become differentiated into proximal and distal regions and the striated or brush borders appear. Thus the embryonic development continues for some time in the first nymph. Once this condition has been reached, cyclical changes involving increase in the diameter of the tubules, {{in the size of the}} nuclei, and in the number of cells in the proximal region occur in each nymphal stage, but before each ecdysis the diameter decreases slightly. Thus the adult condition is reached in 5 distinct steps, corresponding to the 5 instars. Henson's view that Malpighian tubules are endodermal is considered plausible, but his view regarding the primitive number of tubules is not accepted...|$|E
40|$|The {{following}} {{points in}} the descriptive embryology of the sawfly appear to be important especially for comparison with the higher Hymenoptera, e. g. the honey bee. 1. The earlier stages of development (formation of the blastoderm, germinal layers, &c.) take relatively {{more time in the}} honey bee than in the sawfly, while the later stages of development (organogenesis) take more time in the sawfly. 2. Only two well-defined germ layers are formed—the outer (ectoderm) and the inner (mesoderm). Cells proliferate from the mid-ventral area of the germ band and spread out to form the inner layer in the sawfly, whereas in the honey bee it forms as a middle plate. Localized proliferations at the anterior and the posterior end of the germ band form two cell-clumps; from these differentiate the midgut epithelium, mesoderm of the procephalic region of the head, muscle layer of the <b>proctodaeum</b> and stomodaeum, and also the germ cells. These are here called the mesendoderm rudiments. The coelom sacs are not well defined from each other but form a more or less continuous tube as in the honey bee. 3.

40|$|AbstractThe {{number of}} leg-bearing {{segments}} in centipedes varies extensively, between 15 and 191, {{and yet it}} is always odd [1, 2]. This suggests that segment generation in centipedes involves a stage with double segment periodicity and that evolutionary variation in segment number reflects the generation of these double segmental units. However, previous studies have revealed no trace of this [3 – 5]. Here we report the expression of two genes, an odd-skipped related gene (odr 1) and a caudal homolog, that serve as markers for early steps of segment formation in the geophilomorph centipede, Strigamia maritima. Dynamic expression of odr 1 around the <b>proctodaeum</b> resolves into a series of concentric rings, revealing a pattern of double segment periodicity in overtly unsegmented tissue. Initially, the expression of the caudal homolog mirrors this double segment periodicity, but shortly before engrailed expression and overt segmentation, the intercalation of additional stripes generates a repeat with single segment periodicity. Our results provide the first clues about the causality of the unique and fascinating “all-odd” pattern of variation in centipede segment numbers and have implications for the evolution of the mechanisms of arthropod segmentation...|$|E
40|$|Resume 1) The egg of Squilla oratoria DE HAAN is centrolecithal and {{undergoes}} partial cleavages {{resulting in}} rudimentary primary yolk pyramids. 2) The germinal disk is first {{represented by a}} pair of optic lobes and a ventral plate, which are afterward connected by paired, lateral ectoderm thickenings to form a V-shape. The V is then transformed into an O by the appearance of a transverse band between the optic lobes of both sides. 3) A small blastopore is formed. Of the mesendoderm cells derived from the blastopore by cell immigrations, those attached to the lower surface of the lateral ectoderm thickenings are differentiated into a U-shaped, naupliar mesoderm band. This inesoderm band joins the preante:mulary mesoderm derived from the optic lobe, and grows into a complete ring conforming to the shape of the germinal disk. 4) The extra-blastoporic immigrants consist of a preantennulary mesoderm, mesodermal yolk cells and a part of the naupliar mesoderm. The greater part of the preantennulary mesoderm cells disintegrate sooner or later, without forming any distinct structure. The mesodermal yolk cells also degenerate after taking part in the dissolution of the deutoplasm. A discussion as regards the mutual relationship between these elements, with the conclusion that the formation of the preantennulary mesoderm represents the initial step of the extra-blastoporic cell sinking from the whole egg surface, is included. 5) The endodermal elements consist of a compact cell mass differentiated from the posterior part of the mesendoderm layer and the endodermal yolk cells immigrated from the blastopore. The yolk cells, after migrating through the most peripheral part of the yolk, scatter all over its surface. The endoderm plate is nothing but a mass of yolk cells. which remain without scattering. 6) Eight mesoteloblasts derived from the blastoporic lip are attached to the inner surface of the thoracico-abdominal process, making four groups. The ectoteloblasts are differentiated from the ordinary blastoderm cells in a later stage than the mesoteloblasts. In the final condition they consist of 21 cells forming a complete ring around the thoracico-abdominal process. 7) Both the ectoderm and the mesoderm are derived from the teloblasts in all of the post-naupliar segments. · The dorsal ectoderm, however, is non-teloblastic in only a few anterior segments. Differentiation of segments proceeds from the front toward the back. 8) The telson mesoderm is formed by the cells sunk from the telson ectoderm which is derived from the peri-blastoporic ectoderm. 9) The anus is the remnant of the blastopore. In accordance with the change of the caudal furca, the anus is displaced from the dorsal side of the telson to the ventral border between this and the last abdominal segment. 10) There is a distinct nauplius stage. Of the meta-naupliar segments, those from the m:txillula to the second maxilliped are laid on the germinal disk, the following segments together forming a thoracico-abdominal process. Two maxiliiped segments, however, are later separated from the cephalon with the development of the carapace fold, and join the trunk segments. Externally, six abdominal segments are formed. 11) The ganglionic cells are proliferated from the neuroblasts occupying the most superficial part of the centra 1 nervous system. The giant ganglionic cells arise from the ordinary ganglionic cells and not directly from neuroblasts. The development of the cerebrum is described. The tritocerebra of both sides are conne~ted by a transverse nerve-fibre bundle behind the stomodaeum. The ganglia of the segments from the mandible to the second maxilliped first exhibit a typical ladder-like shape. Of these ganglia, the anterior three constitute a sub-resophageal ganglion by more or less complete fusion, while the posterior two are transferred from the cephalon to the thoracico-abdomimil process with the constriction of the segments. The inter-ganglionic cell groups take part in the constriction of the consecutive segments. The seventh abdominal ganglion is clearly indicated by the presence of such a cell group as well as of a pair of nerve fibre masses. 12) The development of the compound eye is traced. The ganglion opticum is derived from the ectoderm of the optic lobe lateral to the protocerebrum; it is not an outgrowth of the cerebrum. 13) The ganglion visceralum is differentiated from the anterior wall of the stomodaeum. 14) A median dorsal organ is formed. In close connection with the activity of this organ, the embryo undergoes one ecdysis. 15) The mid-gut epithelium is formed by the gradual expansion of the anterior and posterior endoderm plates over the yolk sac. These plates, however, extend only on the ventral side of the yolk sac before hatching. The posterior plate is produced by the concentration of the scattered yolk cells toward the periphery of the. plate differentiated from the mesendoderm, while the anterior plate is formed by yolk cells alone. 16) The greater part of the intestine develops from the outgrowth of the posterior endoderm epithelium, the <b>proctodaeum</b> occupying only the rectum. 17) The posterior liver lobes are produced from the posterior endoderm plate as a pair of blind tubes and extend as far backward as the telson. The anterior liver lobes and the lateral mid-gut cceca are rather incompletely developed, being ~eparated by shallow superficial grooves of the yolk sac. These two pairs of diverticula are only partially covered by the endoderm epithelium, and develop into more or less distinct coeca during larval life. They later seem to be completely absorbed again by the mid-gut. 18) The product of each division of the mesoteloblast is equivalent to one mesodermal-segment. The mesoderm of the seventh abdominal segment is derived from the posteriorly situated daughter cell produced by the last division of the teloblast. In' accordance with the grouping of teloblasts, the trunk mesoderm is separated into two ventral and two dorsal bands. Each band is further separated into segmentally arranged blocks, the somites. The ccelom develops in no stage and in no segment. 19) The dorsal mesoderm gives rise to the extensor and the oblique muscles of the trunk, the anterior and posterior limb muscles, {{as well as to the}} mesodermal inclusion of the limb. The -ventral mesoderm grows into the flexor. The connective tissue investing the intestine -and the liver lobes are principally constructed from the dorsal mesoderm. The germ cell does not appear until hatching. A brief account is also given of the fate of the naupliar mesoderm. 20) The heart wall and the pericardial floor are morphologically one unit. They arise from the dorsal mesoderm as a pair of membranes stretching between it and the intestine. The dilated and elongated parts of the heart are formed by the subsequent union of these paired rudiments. 21) The anterior dorsal vessel has a two-fold origin; it is formed by the fusion of an anterior rudiment extending backward from the rostrum and a posterior one developing as a tubular outgrowth of the heart. The former is derived from the rearrangement of mesenchymatous cells which migrated from the anterior end of the naupliar mesoderm. 22) By the time of hatching, two pairs of lateral vessels are formed as hollow linear thickenings of the pericardial floor in front and behind the dilated part of the heart. 23) The antennal gland remains rudimentary without acquiring any intercellular lumen. The maxillar gland is not laid until hatching. The labral and anal glands are derived from the peristomodaeal and the telson mesoderm respectively. 23) Comparisons are made bewteen Squilla and other orders of Malacostraca as regards the salient points of the embryonic development. These have led to the conclusion that the Stomatopoda are most closely related in their embryonic development to Nebaliacea, and further that Stomatopoda represent a rather primitive group separated from the main stem of Malacostraca very early, only next in order to Nebaliacea...|$|E
