Deborah Coles of the charity Inquest, who has supported the Lewis family throughout their campaign, said the jury had reached the most damning <b>possible</b> <b>conclusions</b> on the actions of police and medics. “This was a most horrific death. Eleven police officers were involved in holding down a terrified young man until his complete collapse, legs and hands bound in limb restraints, while mental health staff stood by.

Evidence heard at this inquest begs the question of how racial stereotyping informed Seni’s brutal treatment.” ...|$|E
60|$|In {{answer to}} that appeal Captain Blunt, always correct, didn’t open his lips but only made a little bow. For the rest he was {{perfectly}} ruthless. If he was utterly incapable of being carried away by love there was nothing equivocal about his jealousy. Such psychology is not very rare and really {{from the point of}} view of the combat itself one cannot very well blame him. What happened was this. Monsieur George fired on the word and, whether luck or skill, managed to hit Captain Blunt in the upper part of the arm which was holding the pistol. That gentleman’s arm dropped powerless by his side. But he did not drop his weapon. There was nothing equivocal about his determination. With the greatest deliberation he reached with his left hand for his pistol and taking careful aim shot Monsieur George through the left side of his breast. One may imagine the consternation of the four seconds and the activity of the two surgeons in the confined, drowsy heat of that walled garden. It was within an easy drive of the town and as Monsieur George was being conveyed there at a walking pace a little brougham coming from the opposite direction pulled up at the side of the road. A thickly veiled woman’s head looked out of the window, took in the state of affairs at a glance, and called out in a firm voice: “Follow my carriage.” The brougham turning round took the lead. Long before this convoy reached the town another carriage containing four gentlemen (of whom one was leaning back languidly with his arm in a sling) whisked past and vanished ahead in a cloud of white, Provençal dust. And this is the last appearance of Captain Blunt in Monsieur George’s narrative. Of course he was only told of it later. At the time he was not in a condition to notice things. Its interest in his surroundings remained of a hazy and nightmarish kind for many days together. From time to time he had the impression that he was in a room strangely familiar to him, that he had unsatisfactory visions of Doña Rita, to whom he tried to speak as if nothing had happened, but that she always put her hand on his mouth to prevent him and then spoke to him herself in a very strange voice which sometimes resembled the voice of Rose. The face, too, sometimes resembled the face of Rose. There were also one or two men’s faces which he seemed to know well enough though he didn’t recall their names. He could have done so with a slight effort, but it would have been too much trouble. Then came a time when the hallucinations of Doña Rita and the faithful Rose left him altogether. Next came a period, perhaps a year, or perhaps an hour, during which he seemed to dream all through his past life. He felt no apprehension, he didn’t try to speculate as to the future. He felt that all <b>possible</b> <b>conclusions</b> were out of his power, and therefore he was indifferent to everything. He was like that dream’s disinterested spectator who doesn’t know what is going to happen next. Suddenly for the first time in his life he had the soul-satisfying consciousness of floating off into deep slumber.|$|E

5000|$|Quinn bases the Food Race on {{the premise}} that the total human population, like that of all other animals, is {{influenced}} by food supply. Thus, larger populations are the result of more abundant food supplies, and intensification of food cultivation in response to population growth merely leads to still more population growth. Quinn compared this to the arms race in the Cold War, noting that any increase in food supply is met with a corresponding increase in population. Like Garrett Hardin, then, Quinn sees the only <b>possible</b> <b>conclusions</b> to the Food Race as either abandonment (of such a [...] "race") or catastrophe.|$|E
5000|$|Traditional stories, rituals, and taboos of the Inuit {{are often}} {{precautions}} against dangers posed by their harsh Arctic environment. Knud Rasmussen asked his guide and friend Aua, an angakkuq (spiritual healer), about Inuit religious beliefs among the Iglulingmiut (people of Igloolik) and was told: [...] "We don't believe. We fear." [...] Authors Inge Kleivan and Birgitte Sonne debate <b>possible</b> <b>conclusions</b> of Aua's words, because the angakkuq {{was under the}} influence of Christian missionaries, and later he even converted to Christianity. Their study also analyses beliefs of several Inuit groups, concluding (among others) that fear was not diffuse.|$|E
50|$|Backward {{chaining}} is a {{bit less}} straight forward. In backward chaining the system looks at <b>possible</b> <b>conclusions</b> and works backward {{to see if they}} might be true. So if the system was trying to determine if Mortal(Socrates) is true it would find R1 and query the knowledge base to see if Man(Socrates) is true. One of the early innovations of expert systems shells was to integrate inference engines with a user interface. This could be especially powerful with backward chaining. If the system needs to know a particular fact but doesn't it can simply generate an input screen and ask the user if the information is known. So in this example, it could use R1 to ask the user if Socrates was a Man and then use that new information accordingly.|$|E

Marat sur le feu, l'électricité et la lumière (Mr Marat's Discoveries on Fire, Electricity and Light) in 1779. He then went on to publish three much more detailed and extensive works, expanding on each of his areas of research.

5000|$|Police {{were trained}} to view Lewis's {{behaviour}} as a medical emergency but the jury found police failed to act on this. “The police failed to follow their training, which requires them to place an unresponsive person into the recovery position and if necessary administer life support.

The Independent Police Complaints Commission first cleared officers over the death, but following pressure from the family they scrapped the conclusions and started a new inquiry. The IPCC is planning disciplinary action against some of the police officers involved.

5000|$|Greek music theoreticians such as Simon Karas {{continue}} {{up to the}} end of {{the twentieth}} century to regard the intonation nenano as [...] "exotic," [...] although they do not always agree, whether the echos plagios devteros intonation is hard or soft chromatic. Anonymous authors like the one of the 16th-century Papadike (EBE 899) maintained, that one of the minor tones in the tetrachord of nenano should be either smaller or larger than a tempered semitone, approaching the smallest interval of a third or a quarter of a tone. The banishment of instrumental musical practice and its theory from the tradition of Byzantine chant has made it very difficult to substantiate any such claims experimentally, and traditional singers use different intonations depending on their school. The only <b>possible</b> <b>conclusions</b> can be drawn indirectly and tentatively through comparisons with the tradition of Ottoman instrumental court music, which important church theoreticians such as the Kyrillos Marmarinos, Archbishop of Tinos considered a necessary complement to liturgical chant. However, Ottoman court music and its theory are also complex and diverging versions of modes exist according to different schools, ethnic traditions or theorists. There, one encounters various versions of the [...] "nenano" [...] tetrachord, both with a narrow and with a wider minor second either at the top or at the bottom, depending on the interval structure of the scale beyond the two ends of the tetrachord.|$|E

5000|$|Trenton Webb {{reviewed}} The Rod of Seven Parts for Arcane magazine, rating it a 9 out of 10 overall. He {{commented that}} [...] "The power {{and success of}} The Rod of Seven Parts campaign stems directly from the artefact itself" [...] and states that the quest is [...] "a big, character-killing task that's probably a bit too long for its own good, but one that's so fascinating it's well worth sticking with". Webb comments: [...] "The success of The Rod of Seven Parts lies in its flexibility. With three starting points and three <b>possible</b> <b>conclusions</b> there's real scope for players {{to make their own}} decisions rather than scrabbling to satisfy a designer's conditions. Throughout each set-piece useful trouble-shooting guides crop up and alternative solutions are suggested to the ref. In essence, The Rod of Seven Parts guides the course of events rather than forcing the pace." [...] He continues: [...] "And so this relaxed approach encourages players through the adventures, but these are not the only carrots that this stick has to offer. There are glorious visual cue cards which will help the players to picture the locations and characters they meet perfectly. These are indicative of the extremely high standard of artwork throughout all three manuals and the vast number of maps, which underline the superior quality of the set." [...] Webb adds: [...] "The weaknesses of The Rod are few and far between. There are a few annoying typographical errors ... which trip up an otherwise highly readable manual. The only real problem, though, is the size - in all honesty, the campaign may just be too big for one party to play through." [...] He continues: [...] "However, The Rod of Seven Parts is a very persuasive adventure because it addresses the fraught issue of heroic power. Potent artefacts have a way of finding themselves powerful guardians, so parties are going to have to tackle some major league nasties if they are to ensure its safe assembly. Yet these aren't just monsters that have been dropped in to crank up the combat, but well-rounded NPCs with an agenda of their own. If players keep their ears open and their brains in gear it should become obvious how to reclaim the next section without the need for a fight, or, if it comes to blows, the best way to tip the balance in their favour. It's this ability to turn no-win scenarios into victories that separates heroes from hardmen, and it's what drives the Rod campaign. Regarding the choice between siding with either the dragons or the giants, Webb said [...] "The chances of even a tough party beating either group in a battle are pretty slim, and their chances of victory over both together are nonexistent. So players are forced to muster up their courage and attempt to survive this vicious intrigue long enough to spot and steal the segment. ... And stepping into a Cloud Giant Castle which you know could well come under serious Dragon attack at any second is a great gulp moment, regardless of how hard you reckon you are!" ...|$|E
