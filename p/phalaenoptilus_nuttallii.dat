50|$|The common poorwill, <b>Phalaenoptilus</b> <b>nuttallii,</b> {{is unique}} {{as a bird}} that {{undergoes}} a form of hibernation, becoming torpid and with a much reduced body temperature for weeks or months, although other nightjars can enter a state of torpor for shorter periods.|$|E
50|$|The {{common poorwill}} (<b>Phalaenoptilus</b> <b>nuttallii)</b> is a nocturnal bird {{of the family}} Caprimulgidae, the nightjars. It is found from British Columbia and southeastern Alberta, through the western United States to {{northern}} Mexico. The bird's habitat is dry, open areas with grasses or shrubs, and even stony desert slopes with very little vegetation.|$|E
50|$|Historically, Pliny the Elder {{believed}} swallows hibernated, and ornithologist Gilbert White documented {{anecdotal evidence}} in his 1789 book The Natural History of Selborne that indicated the belief was still current in his time. Birds typically do not hibernate, instead utilizing torpor. One known {{exception is the}} common poorwill (<b>Phalaenoptilus</b> <b>nuttallii),</b> first documented by Edmund Jaeger.|$|E
50|$|On {{cold winter}} nights, these birds can reduce their body {{temperature}} {{by as much}} as 10 to 12 °C (from their normal temperature of about 42 °C) to conserve energy. Such a capacity for torpor is not very common in birds. Other bird species capable of torpor include the common swift Apus apus, the common poor-will <b>Phalaenoptilus</b> <b>nuttallii,</b> the lesser nighthawk Chordeiles acutipennis, and various species of hummingbirds.|$|E

In 2002 and 2003 this committee resolved 202 rare bird records. On {{the basis of}} this review, seven species were added to the North Dakota state bird list: common crane (Grus grus), lesser black-backed gull (Larus juscus), acorn woodpecker (Melanerpes jormicivorus), plumbeous vireo (Vireo plumbeus), Carolina wren (Thryothorus ludovicianus), prairie warbler (Dendroica discolor), and Cassin 2 ̆ 7 s finch (Carpodacus cassinii). Evidence was accepted that established Northern saw-whet owl (Aegolius acadicus), common poorwill (<b>Phalaenoptilus</b> <b>nuttallii),</b> and Henslow 2 ̆ 7 s sparrow (Ammodramus henslowii) as breeding species. In addition, the committee accepted documentation regarding the state 2 ̆ 7 s first Selasphorus sp. hummingbird and 2 ̆ 2 Brewster 2 ̆ 7 s 2 ̆ 2 warbler (Vermivora pinus x V. chrysoptera). Based on the records reviewed, we recommend changes in the recognized status of 37 avian species...|$|E
