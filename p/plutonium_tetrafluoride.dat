Addition of one atmosphere of helium to plutonium hexafluoride at a pressure of approximates 80 mm Hg does not significantly change the G value for the decomposition compared with that for pure plutonium hexafluoride. Addition of 2 atmos of helium to plutonium hexafluoride at approximates 80 mm Hg results in a G value for the decomposition of 5. 8 plus or minus 0. 9. A study {{of the effect of}} krypton on the decomposition of plutonium hexafluoride by gamma radiation revealed a marked enhancement of the decomposition at an electron fraction of No such enhancement was observed at an exposure dose of 2 x 10 /sup 8 / rads. Addition of fluorine or oxygen to plutonium hexafluoride resulted in a G value for the decomposition that was less than that obtained from the irradiation of pure plutonium hexafluoride.

40|$|Experiments {{were carried}} out to {{determine}} the extent and rate of separation of mixtures of uranium hexafluoride and plutonium hexafluoride by selective thermal decomposition. Gaseous mixtures of uranium hexafluoride, plutonium hexafluoride, and helium were circulated for varying lengths of time through nickel vessels packed with nickel wool at temperatures of 150, 200, and 300 deg C. The initial ratios of uranium hexafluoride to plutonium hexafluoride in the mixtures were of the order of 10 to 1. The gas phase was analyzed for uranium and plutonium before and after circulation. The amounts of uranium and plutonium in the solid compounds deposited in the vessels were also determined. Passage of the mixtures through the hot vessels resulted in the removal of 99. 5 to 99. 9 % of the plutonium. The solid product remaining in the vessels was <b>plutonium</b> <b>tetrafluoride</b> containing 0. 09 to 1. 3 % uranium. The separation of plutonium hexafluoride from uranium hexafluoride by selective thermal decomposition is applicable to fluid bed fluoride volatility processes for the recovery of fissile material from reactor fuels.

40|$|This report {{documents}} response {{characteristics and}} the development of dose algorithms for the Hanford Combination Neutron Dosimeter (HCNO) implemented on January 1, 1995. The HCND was accredited under the U. S. Department of Energy (DOE) Laboratory Accreditation Program (DOELAP) during 1994. The HCND employs two neutron dose components consisting of (1) an albedo thermoluminescent dosimeter (TLD), and (2) a track-etch dosimeter (TED). Response characteristics of these two dosimeter components were measured under the low-scatter conditions of the Hanford 318 Building Calibration Laboratory, and under the high-scatter conditions in the workplace at the Plutonium Finishing Plant (PFP). The majority of personnel neutron dose at Hanford (currently and historically) occurs at the PFP. National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) traceable sources were used to characterize dosimeter response in the laboratory. At the PFP, neutron spectra and dose-measuring instruments, including a multisphere spectrometer, tissue equivalent proportional counters, and specially calibrated rem meters, were used to determine the neutron dose under several configurations from three different plutonium sources: (1) <b>plutonium</b> <b>tetrafluoride,</b> (2) plutonium metal, and (3) plutonium oxide. In addition, measurements were performed at many selected work locations. The HCNDs were included in all measurements. Comparison of dosimeter- and instrument-measured dose equivalents provided the data necessary to develop HCND dose algorithms and to assess the accuracy of estimated neutron dose under actual work conditions...|$|E
40|$|Vacuum {{distillation}} of chloride salts from {{plutonium oxide}} (PuO{sub 2 }) and simulant PuO{sub 2 } {{has been previously}} demonstrated at Department of Energy (DOE) sites using kilogram quantities of chloride salt. The apparatus for vacuum distillation contains a zone heated using a furnace and a zone actively cooled using either recirculated water or compressed air. During a vacuum distillation operation, a sample boat containing the feed material is placed into the apparatus while it is cool, and the system is sealed. The system is evacuated using a vacuum pump. Once a sufficient vacuum is attained, heating begins. Volatile salts distill from the heated zone to the cooled zone where they condense, leaving behind the non-volatile materials in the feed boat. The application of vacuum salt distillation (VSD) is {{of interest to the}} HB-Line Facility and the MOX Fuel Fabrication Facility (MFFF) at the Savannah River Site (SRS). Both facilities are involved in efforts to disposition excess fissile materials. Many of these materials contain chloride and fluoride salt concentrations which make them unsuitable for dissolution without prior removal of the chloride and fluoride salts. Between September 2009 and January 2011, the Savannah River National Laboratory (SRNL) and HB-Line designed, developed, tested, and successfully deployed a system for the distillation of chloride salts. Subsequent efforts are attempting to adapt the technology for the removal of fluoride. Fluoride salts of interest are less-volatile than the corresponding chloride salts. Consequently, an alternate approach is required for the removal of fluoride without significantly increasing the operating temperature. HB-Line Engineering requested SRNL to evaluate and demonstrate the feasibility of an alternate approach using both non-radioactive simulants and plutonium-bearing materials. Whereas the earlier developments targeted the removal of sodium chloride (NaCl) and potassium chloride (KCl), the current activities are concerned with the removal of the halide ions associated with plutonium trifluoride (PuF{sub 3 }), <b>plutonium</b> <b>tetrafluoride</b> (PuF{sub 4 }), calcium fluoride (CaF{sub 2 }), and calcium chloride (CaCl{sub 2 }). This report discusses non-radioactive testing of small-scale and pilot-scale systems and radioactive testing of a small-scale system. Experiments focused on demonstrating the chemistry for halide removal and addressing the primary engineering questions associated with a change in the process chemistry...|$|E
