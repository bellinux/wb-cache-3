As {{for the effort}} involved in the materials development, {{in addition to the}} ALS findings already mentioned (ALS, 1998), Rumble (2001, p. 79) reviews a study by Sparkes (1984, p. 219) who states that an academic needs between 2 to 10  h to <b>prepare</b> <b>a</b> conference, 1 to 10  h to <b>prepare</b> <b>a</b> small group session, 3 to 10  h to <b>prepare</b> <b>a</b> video recording, 50 to 100  h to <b>prepare</b> <b>a</b> text, around 100  h to <b>prepare</b> <b>a</b> live TV session, 200  h to <b>prepare</b> <b>a</b> tutorial and about 300  h to <b>prepare</b> <b>an</b> interactive software, not counting the time of the technical staff supporting the process. Many faculty would agree that these figures are not far from current ones, being the expertise of the academic and the possibility of repurposing available resources what makes the difference. Rumble points out that one way of keeping production costs within an acceptable range is by using an author-editor model with advisors supporting the author, rather than having permanent staff in charge of producing materials. He also states (p. 80) that because the quality of materials is critical, to achieve cost-efficiency, it is better to seek savings in recurrent costs such as course promotion.|$|R

5|$|As {{a result}} of the incident, safety {{regulations}} for the project were scrutinized and revised.

Additionally, discussions and designs for remote-controlled test devices were initiated, eventually leading {{to the creation of the}} Godiva device.|$|E

5|$|Following the pagoda raids, the United States {{terminated}} {{funding to}} Tung's men {{because they were}} used as a political tool rather than against the communists.

However, the pair were unaware that General Tôn Thất Đính, who was planning the phony operation, was involved in the real coup plot.

5|$|Morchella rufobrunnea is the morel that is {{cultivated}} commercially per US patents 4594809 and 4757640. This {{process was}} developed in 1982 by Ronald Ower with {{what he thought was}} Morchella esculenta; M.rufobrunnea had not yet been described. The cultivation protocol consists of <b>preparing</b> <b>a</b> spawn culture that is mixed with nutrient-poor soil. This mixture is laid on nutrient-rich soil and kept sufficiently moist until fruiting. In the nutrient-poor substrate, the fungus forms sclerotia—hardened masses of mycelia that serve as food reserves. Under appropriate environmental conditions, these sclerotia grow into morels.|$|E
