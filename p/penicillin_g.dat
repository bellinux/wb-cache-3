40|$|Penicillium chrysogenum is a {{filamentous}} fungus {{used for the}} bulk production of penicillins by industry. Only the <b>penicillins</b> <b>G</b> and V are produced by fed-batch cultivation of high-yielding P. chrysomgenum strains. Transport studies in P. chrysogenum presented so far were conducted at mycelial suspensions only. Mycelial suspensions are inadequate for such studies as data are often affected by metabolism and compartmentalization of the transported compounds. This project was initiated to obtain solid information on the nature and specificity of the transport systems that reside in the plasma membrane and that are of important in penicillin production. To study these transport systems in detail a simple model system based on isolated plasma membranes had to be constructed. ...|$|R
5|$|Aspirin {{is known}} to {{interact}} with other drugs. For example, acetazolamide and ammonium chloride are known to enhance the intoxicating effect of salicylates, and alcohol also increases the gastrointestinal bleeding associated with these types of drugs. Aspirin {{is known to}} displace a number of drugs from protein-binding sites in the blood, including the antidiabetic drugs tolbutamide and chlorpropamide, warfarin, methotrexate, phenytoin, probenecid, valproic acid (as well as interfering with beta oxidation, {{an important part of}} valproate metabolism), and other NSAIDs. Corticosteroids may also reduce the concentration of aspirin. Ibuprofen can negate the antiplatelet effect of aspirin used for cardioprotection and stroke prevention. The pharmacological activity of spironolactone may be reduced by taking aspirin, and it is known to compete with <b>penicillin</b> <b>G</b> for renal tubular secretion. Aspirin may also inhibit the absorption of vitamin C.|$|E
5|$|No {{definitive}} antidote for amatoxin poisoning is available, {{but some}} specific treatments such as intravenous <b>penicillin</b> <b>G</b> {{have been shown}} to improve survival. There is some evidence that intravenous silibinin, an extract from the blessed milk thistle (Silybum marianum), may be beneficial in reducing the effects of amatoxins, preventing their uptake by hepatocytes, thereby protecting undamaged hepatic tissue. In patients developing liver failure, a liver transplant is often the only option to prevent death. Liver transplants have become a well-established option in amatoxin poisoning. This is a complicated issue, however, as transplants themselves may have significant complications and mortality; patients require long-term immunosuppression to maintain the transplant. Evidence suggests that, although survival rates have improved with modern medical treatment, in patients with moderate to severe poisoning up to half of those who did recover suffered permanent liver damage. However, a follow-up study has shown that most survivors recover completely without any sequelae if treated within 36hours of mushroom ingestion.|$|E
5|$|No {{definitive}} antidote is available, {{but some}} specific treatments {{have been shown}} to improve survivability. High-dose continuous intravenous <b>penicillin</b> <b>G</b> has been reported to be of benefit, though the exact mechanism is unknown, and trials with cephalosporins show promise. Some evidence indicates intravenous silibinin, an extract from the blessed milk thistle (Silybum marianum), may be beneficial in reducing the effects of death cap poisoning. A long-term clinical trial of intravenous silibinin began in the US in 2010. Silibinin prevents the uptake of amatoxins by liver cells, thereby protecting undamaged liver tissue; it also stimulates DNA-dependent RNA polymerases, leading to an increase in RNA synthesis. According to one report based on a treatment of 60 patients with silibinin, patients who started the drug within 96 hours of ingesting the mushroom and who still had intact kidney function all survived. As of February 2014 supporting research has not yet been published.|$|E
40|$|The {{therapeutic}} use of penicillin has been {{complicated by the}} demonstration (Chemistry of Penicillin, 1945) that {{there are at least}} four molecular species, identified as F, G, K, and X, the relative proportions of which in the commercial product may vary with different strains of mold and different methods of con-centration, and even in the output of a single plant at different times. Against a standard test strain of Staphylococcus aureus, the activities of <b>penicillins</b> F, <b>G,</b> K, and X have been found to be, respectively, 1, 550, 1, 667, 2, 300, and 900 units per mg (Veldee et al., 1945; Coghill, 1946; Libby and Holmberg, 1945; Welch et al., 1944). This corresponds to relative gravimetric activities against the same organism of approximately 90, 100, 140, and 55. The relative molar ac-tivities are of the same order of magnitude. In the case of <b>penicillins</b> <b>G</b> and X these relative activities have been shown to vary from organism to organism. Thus, per staphylococcidal "unit, " Welch, Putnam, Randall, and Herwick (1944) found X to be significantly more active than G against gonococci in man and 3 to 5 times more active against pneu-mococci (I) in white mice; Libby and Holmberg (1945) found X to be gravimetri-cally 1. 2 to 2 times more active than G in vitro against 3 strains each of pneu-mococci (I, II, III) and streptococci (A, B, D); and Ory, Meads, and Finland (1945) found 2 preparations in whichX constituted 65 and 90 per cent of the total penicillin to be 2 to 8 times more active per unit than G against most strains of group A streptococci, gonococci, and meningococci in vitro, and twice as active against most strains of pneumococci and Streptococcus viridans. The present communication will deal with the relative activities in vitro of <b>penicillins</b> F, <b>G,</b> K, and X against a group A hemolytic streptococcus (strain C- 203) and a cultured strain of Spirochaeta pallida (Reiter) ...|$|R
40|$|The penamaldic {{derivatives}} of amoxicillin, ampicillin, and <b>penicillins</b> <b>G</b> and V, stabilized with Zn 2 �, {{were obtained}} from a methanolic medium. The enzymatic kinetic {{results show that the}} these derivatives elicit reversible inhibition of the enzyme metallo-�-lactamase from Bacillus cereus, with inhibition constant values determined at pH 7. 0 and 25 °C. Bacteria have developed various strategies to deactivate �-lactam antibiotics, including the production of �-lactamase enzymes. These have been grouped in four classes (6, 10). Classes A, C, and D contain a catalytic serine residue in their active sites, and several have inhibitors utilized in therapeutics (4, 15, 16). Class B metalloenzymes require one or two zinc ions to carry out the hydrolysis of the �-lactams (3) and act {{on a wide range of}} �-lactam antibiotics, including carbapenems and inhibitors of the serine-dependent enzymes (12).

5|$|Many species produce {{metabolites}} {{that are}} {{major sources of}} pharmacologically active drugs. Particularly important are the antibiotics, including the penicillins, a structurally related group of β-lactam antibiotics that are synthesized from small peptides. Although naturally occurring penicillins such as <b>penicillin</b> <b>G</b> (produced by Penicillium chrysogenum) have a relatively narrow spectrum of biological activity, {{a wide range of}} other penicillins can be produced by chemical modification of the natural penicillins. Modern penicillins are semisynthetic compounds, obtained initially from fermentation cultures, but then structurally altered for specific desirable properties. Other antibiotics produced by fungi include: ciclosporin, commonly used as an immunosuppressant during transplant surgery; and fusidic acid, used to help control infection from methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus bacteria. Widespread use of antibiotics for the treatment of bacterial diseases, such as tuberculosis, syphilis, leprosy, and others began in the early 20th century and continues to date. In nature, antibiotics of fungal or bacterial origin appear to play a dual role: at high concentrations they act as chemical defense against competition with other microorganisms in species-rich environments, such as the rhizosphere, and at low concentrations as quorum-sensing molecules for intra- or interspecies signaling. Other drugs produced by fungi include griseofulvin isolated from Penicillium griseofulvum, used to treat fungal infections, and statins (HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors), used to inhibit cholesterol synthesis. Examples of statins found in fungi include mevastatin from Penicillium citrinum and lovastatin from Aspergillus terreus and the oyster mushroom.|$|E

40|$|Penicillins and {{cephalosporins}} are b-lactam antibiot-ics {{widely used}} in human medicine. The biosynthesis of these compounds starts by the condensation of the amino acids L-a-aminoadipic acid, L-cysteine and L-valine to form the tripeptide d-L-a-aminoadipyl-L-cysteinyl-D-valine catalysed by the non-ribosomal peptide ‘ACV synthetase’. Subsequently, this tripep-tide is cyclized to isopenicillin N that in Penicillium is converted to hydrophobic <b>penicillins,</b> e. <b>g.</b> benzylpeni-cillin. In Acremonium and in streptomycetes, isopeni-cillin N is later isomerized to penicillin N and finally converted to cephalosporin.

N-acetylcysteine has shown promise in combination with other therapies. Animal studies indicate the amatoxins deplete hepatic glutathione; N-acetylcysteine serves as a glutathione precursor and may therefore prevent reduced glutathione levels and subsequent liver damage. None of the antidotes used have undergone prospective, randomized clinical trials, and only anecdotal support is available. Silibinin and N-acetylcysteine appear to be the therapies with the most potential benefit. Repeated doses of activated carbon may be helpful by absorbing any toxins that are returned to the gastrointestinal tract following enterohepatic circulation. Other methods of enhancing the elimination of the toxins have been trialed; techniques such as hemodialysis, hemoperfusion, plasmapheresis, and peritoneal dialysis have occasionally yielded success but overall do not appear to improve outcome.|$|E
