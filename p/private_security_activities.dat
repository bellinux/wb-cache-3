It is indicated that some scholars refer liability and willingness to take risks to professionally important qualities of guards ? employees of <b>private</b> <b>security</b> companies. Thus, if liability is considered as absolutely positive professionally needed personal characteristics, then {{it is not so}} clear with readiness (predisposition) to take risks. Contradictory data on the impact of the predisposition to take risks on the effectiveness of professional activity is provided in the literature. Predisposition to take risks is often considered as a contraindication for <b>private</b> <b>security</b> <b>activity,</b> but it is also noted that the choice to take risks can be conscious, value conditioned decision, which guarantees effective performance of professional duties. During the conducted research the author has found out that the guards of <b>private</b> <b>security</b> organizations (hereinafter ? PSO) are characterized by the same level of desire for risk as people whose professional activity is not related to extreme situations. However, the structure of relationships between {{the willingness to}} take risks and liability of guards and employees of PSO, who are not related to <b>security</b> <b>activity,</b> is significantly different. Such components of the willingness to take risks, as the desire for thrills and the search for new experiences of the guards of SPO are caused by profound and holistic understanding about liability, understanding of its essence, commitment and integrity, manifested in carrying out duties aimed at the social environment, as well as experience of positive emotions while performing responsible tasks. Besides, the liability associated with a sense of duty, reduces non-adaptive commitment for difficulties. Another situation is observed talking about SPO employees not related to <b>security</b> <b>activity.</b> Facial understanding of liability, focus on personal well-being and existence of negative emotions while performing responsible tasks lead to the fact that SPO employees, who do not exercise <b>security</b> <b>activity,</b> have no willingness to take risks. ????????, ??? ????????? ??????? ???????? ???????????

40|$|Tens of {{thousands}} of contractors work for <b>private</b> military and <b>security</b> companies (PMSCs) in armed conflicts around the world, often hired by states to fulfil functions that were once the exclusive domain of the armed forces. In this context, PMSCs have performed {{a wide range of}} activities including offensive combat, prisoner interrogation, military advice and training, armed security, intelligence and logistics. The proliferation of PMSCs {{during the past two decades}} has challenged conventional conceptions of the state as the primary holder of coercive power in the international arena. Nonetheless, this Thesis argues that the traditional state-centred frameworks of international law remain vitally relevant to the regulation of <b>private</b> <b>security</b> <b>activity</b> in contemporary armed conflict. Three states are in a strong position to influence PMSCs in this context—the state that hires the PMSC, the state in which the company is based or incorporated, and the state in which the company operates—and this capacity for influence enables international law to regulate PMSC activities indirectly using these states as an intermediary. This Thesis critically analyses the pertinent international obligations on these three categories of states and identifies the circumstances in which PMSC misconduct may give rise to state responsibility in each case. It also examines the recent practice of certain key states in order to evaluate their compliance with these obligations. By providing a clear and in-depth analysis of states' international obligations to control PMSCs in armed conflict, this Thesis may not only facilitate the assessment of state responsibility in cases of PMSC misconduct; it may also play an important prospective role in setting standards of conduct for states in relation to the <b>private</b> <b>security</b> industry. This in turn may encourage and assist states to develop their domestic laws and policies in order to improve overall PMSC compliance with international law.

We and others have examined many of the challenges the government faces using contractors in Iraq, including {{issues related to the}} scope of <b>private</b> <b>security</b> contractors' <b>activities,</b> the challenges in providing sufficient oversight, the appropriate accountability processes, and difficulties in conducting background screenings of foreign national contractor employees. What has not been so well examined is the comparative cost of using civilian employees or military members versus the cost of using contractors, particularly <b>private</b> <b>security</b> contractors, during contingency operations such as Operation Iraqi Freedom. Generally, when costs have been discussed, the focus has been on the daily rate paid to contractor employees, rather than on the total costs of using State Department or DOD personnel. However, in October 2005, the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) issued a study that compared the cost of using military personnel, federal civilians, or contractors to provide logistic support for overseas operations. The study concluded that over a 20 -year period, using Army military units would cost roughly 90 percent more than using the contractor. Also, in an August 2008 report on contractor support in Iraq, the Congressional Budget Office conducted a comparison of one contractor's costs to provide <b>private</b> <b>security</b> services in Iraq versus estimated military costs. The report concluded that for the 1 -year period beginning June 11, 2004, the costs of the private contractor did not differ greatly from the costs of having a comparable military unit performing similar functions. Because of the broad level of interest by Congress in issues dealing with Iraq, the Comptroller General performed this review under his authority to conduct evaluations on his own initiative. For this engagement, congressional interest specifically focused on determining the costs to the Department of Defense and the State Department of using <b>private</b> <b>security</b> contractors for security services versus using federal employees to provide the same services. We focused our review on the comparison of the State Department's costs to use <b>private</b> <b>security</b> contractors [...] to perform both personal and static security functions [...] as opposed to using State Department employees to perform those same functions. ...|$|R

The researcher reviewed previous studies with a view to establish academic gaps which the present study sought to bridge. This study adopted a census survey design and employed quantitative research methods as the main approach to guide the study. The research targeted all of the <b>private</b> <b>security</b> firms in Kenya. There are 23 listed security firms under the Kenya Security Industry Association (KSIA) and 44 under the Protective Security Industry Association (PSIA) - a total of 67 security firms in Kenya. The research instrument used for data collection was a questionnaire to elicit the required information from the respondents. The respondents were either the Managing Director or Head of Security at these firms, since they have a broad knowledge about the business activities being conducted by the company. Most of them have been with the company for a significant number of years. Emanating from the research findings it is recommended that the security firms should better train the <b>private</b> <b>security</b> guards in order to enhance overall security being provided to clients. Security guards must be able to respond to different changes in their environment, which include action such as traffic movement; ensure the safety of people among and inside different localities; observing and handling the admittance and exit of individuals and cars and evaluating and monitoring individuals and coming up with a policy and legal framework for regulating and observing <b>Private</b> <b>Security</b> Company (PSC) <b>activity.</b> The study concludes that the <b>private</b> <b>security</b> sector in Kenya impacts on and influences overall safety and security. The study, therefore, finds that there has been growth and development of the <b>private</b> <b>security</b> sector in Kenya and it continues to do so currently. Finally, advances the view that a significant relationship does exist between the functions of the <b>private</b> <b>security</b> sector and the development of the <b>private</b> <b>security</b> sector in Kenya which have had an extensive influence on levels of safety and security in that country.
