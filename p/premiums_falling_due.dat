A defensible range of risk-aversion coefficients {{is defined by the}} coefficients that correspond to risk <b>premiums</b> <b>falling</b> between 1 and 99 % of the amount at risk or to probability <b>premiums</b> <b>falling</b> between. 005 and. 49 for a lottery that pays or loses a given sum. The consequences of ignoring risk premiums when selecting risk-aversion coefficients for representative decision makers are illustrated by calculation of the implied risk premium associated with the levels of absolute risk aversion assumed in six selected studies...|$|R

30|$|Employers and {{professionals}} earn {{a statistically significant}} premium of over 50 percent in low and upper middle income countries (Table  3 b). This <b>premium</b> <b>falls</b> to 8 percent and becomes statistically insignificant in high income countries. Figure  1 c presents earnings differentials between employers {{and professionals}} vs. employees for the each country in our sample. Employers and professionals earn a premium in most low and middle income countries compared to employees. In many high income countries employers and professionals face a penalty compared to employees, and in countries where they earn a premium compared to employees the premium tends to be small.|$|R

Dominus Hugo's apartments were plundered by his servants, to the last portable stool, in a few minutes after the breath was out of his body. Forlorn old Hugo, fare thee well forever.|$|R
40|$|In this {{practically}} oriented review, we will {{outline the}} clinical approach {{of patients with}} <b>falls</b> <b>due</b> to an impairment or loss of consciousness. Following a set of definitions, we describe the salient clinical features of disorders leading to such falls. Among falls caused by true loss of consciousness, we separate the clinical characteristics of syncopal <b>falls</b> (<b>due</b> to reflex syncope, hypovolemia, orthostatic hypotension or cardiac syncope) from <b>falls</b> <b>due</b> to other causes of transient unconsciousness, such as seizures. With respect to falls caused by an apparent loss of consciousness, we discuss the presentation of cataplexy, drop attacks, and psychogenic falls. Particular emphasis will be laid upon crucial features obtained by history taking for distinguishing between the various conditions that cause or mimic a transient loss of consciousness...|$|R

40|$|Using nationally {{representative}} survey data for Finnish employees linked to register data on their wages and work histories {{we find that}} wage effects of high involvement management (HIM) practices are generally positive and significant. However, employees with better wage and work histories {{are more likely to}} enter HIM jobs. The wage <b>premium</b> <b>falls</b> substantially having accounted for employees’ work histories, which suggests that existing studies’ estimates are upwardly biased owing to positive selection into HIM. Results using standard regression techniques are robust to propensity score matching and instrumental variables estimation. The premium also rises with the number of HIM practices and differs markedly across different types of HIM practice...|$|R

40|$|Vlieghe {{considers}} {{the link between}} housing prices and consumption in a model where housing equity influences household borrowing capacity. Specifically, a rise in housing prices reduces household leverage and improves household balance sheets. As household balance sheets improve, mortgage <b>premiums</b> <b>fall</b> and housing demand increases. On the consumption side, the improvement in household balance sheets also increases the amount that credit-constrained consumers can borrow for current consumption. As a result, movements in housing prices amplify the effects of underlying disturbances to the economy. Housing investment, consumption, and output exhibit greater volatility and greater comovement than one would obtain in a model with perfect capital markets. The model also contains important feedback effects in general equilibrium: as housing prices rise an...|$|R
