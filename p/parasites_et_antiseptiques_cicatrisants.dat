The formation of extracellular traps (ETs) by activated mononuclear phagocytes is meanwhile well accepted as an effector mechanism of the early host innate immune response acting against microbial infections. Recent investigations showed evidence that ETosis is a widely spread effector mechanism in vertebrates and invertebrates being utilized to entrap and kill bacteria, fungi, viruses, and protozoan <b>parasites.</b> <b>ETs</b> are released in response to intact protozoan parasites or to parasite-specific antigens in a controlled cell death process. Released ETs consist of nuclear DNA as backbone adorned with histones, antimicrobial peptides, and phagocyte-specific granular enzymes thereby producing a sticky extracellular matrix capable of entrapping and killing pathogens. This review summarizes recent data on protozoa-induced ETosis.

30|$|In {{the present}} study, {{intestinal}} acariasis {{was accompanied by}} infection with Blastocystis sp. which {{was found to be}} non-pathogenic. Members of the genus Blastocystis comprise several subtypes (genotypes) and it is suggested that its pathogenicity is related to specific subtypes and <b>parasite</b> burden (Sheehan <b>et</b> al. 1986; Stensvold et al. 2007; Al-kaissi and Al Magdi 2009; Coyle et al. 2011). There has been debate in the literature concerning the question of this organism pathogenicity; some studies suggest an association between the parasite and disease but others do not (Tan 2008). Most recent studies focused on correlating disease pathogenicity with subtypes irrespective of <b>parasite</b> density (Stensvold <b>et</b> al. 2009; Yakoob et al. 2010).|$|R
30|$|Prophenoloxidases (proPO) are the {{inactive}} form of phenoloxidases (PO). PO is synthesized {{primarily by}} hemocytes of the insects (Kanost and Gorman 2008).

Insect phenoloxidases {{play a key}} role in initiating the humoral and cellular immune reaction against pathogen and <b>parasites</b> (Marmaras <b>et</b> al. 1996). During melanogenesis, the main role of PO is converting phenols to quinones, which subsequently polymerized to form melanin and generating toxic radicals (Shelby and Popham 2006; González-Santoyo and Córdoba-Aguilar 2012).|$|R

30|$|The {{present study}} {{indicates}} that higher species richness and infection level of monogeneans {{were found in the}} cultured O. niloticus compared to the wild O. niloticus. This concurs with the finding by Ibrahim (2012) who reported that cultured fish {{were more likely to be}} infected by monogeneans parasites due to cultivation of high density of fish in aquaculture systems. Besides, low water quality in cultured pond may also increase stresses on fish and suppress their immune system, which would promote the transmission of <b>parasites</b> (Landsberg <b>et</b> al. 1998; Shoemaker et al. 2015).|$|R
3000|$|Diarrheal {{diseases}} are the important causes of {{morbidity and mortality}} among young children in developing countries; with significant numbers of cases being attributable to <b>parasites</b> (Sherchand <b>et</b> al. 2009). Their prevalence depends upon various socio-economic factors such as hygiene, availability of clean drinking water, poverty and education (Tandukar et al. 2013). Diarrheal diseases mainly affect young children, diminishing cognitive function (Niehaus et al. 2002) and are the second major leading causes of childhood mortality (World Health Organization 2013). Diarrheal diseases account for large number of child deaths in Asia, Latin America and Africa (Uga et al. 2004).|$|R
30|$|The {{hygienic}} {{quality of}} treated organic waste may be assessed using naturally occurring and/or added indicator organisms {{to model the}} survival of bacteria, viruses and <b>parasites</b> (Tønner-Klank <b>et</b> al. 2007). Some bacteria like coliforms are used as indicators (Lester and Birkett 1999). The presence of coliform bacteria is often used {{as an indicator of}} the overall sanitary quality of soil and water environments. Use of an indicator such as coliforms, as opposed to the actual disease-causing organisms, is advantageous as the indicators generally occur at higher frequencies than the pathogens and are simpler and safer to detect (Hassen et al. 2001).|$|R
30|$|In {{addition}} to these local limitations, the main obstacles in mussel aquaculture in general are those regarding infectious diseases and <b>parasites</b> (Bower <b>et</b> al. 1994), marine phycotoxins (Svensson 2003; Moroño et al. 2003) as well as carrying capacity and competition {{for the use of}} marine space (Martínez et al. 2007; Costa-Pierce 2008; Byron et al. 2011). Limited marine space coupled with commercial objectives often results in non-sustainable practices for commercial mussel cultivation (Smaal 2002; Waite et al. 2005; Duarte et al. 2008). It is encouraging, however, that ecosystem-based approach-management strategies have been recommended to promote the sustainable development of mussel cultivation (Soto et al. 2008).|$|R
30|$|Functions of NK {{cells of}} the group 1 ILC family have been well established, which include killing virus-infected cells through {{cytolysis}} mediated by granzymes and perforin, and targeting tumor cells that have lost expression of the class I major histocompatibility complex (MHCI) (Biron et al., 1999; Vivier et al., 2012). The other non-cytotoxic ILC 1 s can produce high amounts of IFNγ and TNFα, contributing {{to the protection of}} hosts against bacteria and intracellular <b>parasites</b> (Klose <b>et</b> al., 2014; Klose et al., 2013).

30|$|The {{most common}} {{gastrointestinal}} parasite prevalent {{throughout the year}} in Meghalaya, India is Strongyle infection. This {{is because of the}} high rainfall and humidity prevalent in the North Eastern regions that augments the free living larval development in soil to complete the life cycle of strongyle group of <b>parasite</b> (Bandyopadhyay <b>et</b> al.; 2010, Soulsby, 1982). As the prevalence of free-living larval stages is mainly dependent on micro-climatic environment, therefore, study was initiated to identify the relationship between meteorological parameters and prevalence of gastrointestinal parasitic load in animals. The study would also prove vitally useful in predicting/forecasting the disease occurrence based on the prevailing pattern of rainfall in any specific location.|$|R
40|$|Several {{dermatophytes}} producing numerous pyriform or round microconidia {{were called}} Trichophyton mentagrophytes. Among these dermatophytes are the teleomorph species Arthroderma benhamiae, Arthroderma vanbreuseghemii and Arthroderma simii, {{and other species}} such as Trichophyton interdigitale, Trichophyton erinacei and Trichophyton quinckeanum for which only the anamorph is known. Confusion exists about which fungus should be really called T. mentagrophytes and about the rational use of this name in practice. We report a case of beard ringworm (tinea barbae) with A. vanbreuseghemii. According to both clinical signs {{and the type of}} hair parasitism, this case was exactly compatible to the first description of a non-favic dermatophytosis by Gruby under the name of "mentagrophyte" from which was derived the dermatophyte epithet mentagrophytes. In addition, the phenotypic characters of the isolated fungus in cultures perfectly matched with those of the first description of a dermatophyte under T. mentagrophytes by Blanchard (<b>Parasites</b> animaux <b>et</b> <b>parasites</b> végétaux à l'exclusion des Bactéries, Masson, Paris, 1896). In conclusion, T. mentagrophytes corresponds to the fungus later named A. vanbreuseghemii. However, because the neotype of T. mentagrophytes was not adequately designated in regard to the ancient literature, we would privilege the use of A. vanbreuseghemii and abandon the name of T. mentagrophytes...|$|R
30|$|Another {{question}} that arises {{with the national}} distribution of some breeds {{is the question of}} genotype x environment interaction. Unlike the British study (Carson et al., 2009), Brazil is a continental sized country ranging from the equator to the Tropic of Capricorn, englobing at least six different and distinct ecosystems. Most of the breeds have no formal breeding plans in place and studies have shown that breed success depends largely on environmental factors, especially in stressful environments. Also the smaller naturalized breeds tend to have less propaganda. Some breeding actions taken by farmers to “improve” the Santa Ines in terms of production capacity have also resulted in a worsening of their adaptive ability and resistance to <b>parasites</b> (McManus <b>et</b> al., 2009 a, b; 2010).|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT. Spectacled eider (Somareria jischeri) {{populations in}} western Alaska are now less than 4 % {{of the numbers}} {{estimated}} in the early 1970 s.

Many aspects of spectacled eider biology remain unknown, including their marine foraging habitats, food items, migratory movements, and population ecology. A review of some biological characteristics and possible threats to the species suggests the importance of quantifying potential impacts from parasites and disease, subsistence harvest, predation during brood rearing, and alteration of Bering Sea food resources.

30|$|Projections {{of climate}} change effects for forests and forest sector are as follows: {{increased}} frequency and intensity of tree diseases and pest outbreaks due to a warmer climate, and particularly warmer winters, which increases the survival of <b>parasites</b> (Dale <b>et</b> al. 2001); a modification of the potential distribution ranges of tree species, as conditions are shifting far faster than their ability to adapt in place or migrate to more suitable locations (Bell and Collins 2008); and warmer growing seasons and rising CO 2 concentrations, which, in the short term, will enhance forest production where soil nutrient and water availability allow. However, under nutrient-poor or water-deficient conditions, {{such as those in}} the Belgian forest regions of Ardennes and Campine, respectively (Campioli et al. 2011), this would not apply. As a result, there is a dire need to raise awareness of climate-related risks (and opportunities) among forest stakeholders, and engage them in adaptation.|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe yellow-legged hornet, Vespa velutina nigrithorax, was accidentally {{introduced}} from China to southwestern France in 2004 (Haxaire et al. 2006). The {{species is}} currently colonizing France and neighboring countries (Spain, Portugal, Belgium, and Italy) (Darrouzet and Gévar 2012; Monceau et al. 2013). V. velutina is a pest in France because it preys upon domestic honeybees, Apis mellifera.

In addition, the fish need {{to adapt to the}} tank conditions and begin feeding on the supplied feed. To assist with recovery, the fish are usually treated upon arrival with antibiotics to prevent bacterial infections, which are more likely to occur given the fish’s compromised physical condition. Treatment options include; intra-muscular injection of oxytetracycline (OTC, 100  mg mL− 1, to a final concentration of 0.3 – 0.7  mL kg body weight− 1), submersion in sodium nifurstyrenate solution (7  ppm for 1  h), submersion in formalin solution (200  ppm, for 1  h) to remove external <b>parasites</b> (Wexler <b>et</b> al. 2003), and submersion or soaking of the feed in a commercial anti-microbial agent (Trimetox® 240, 20  ppm for 3  days and 50  ppm for 20  min, respectively) (Correia et al. 2011).|$|R
30|$|My study {{contrasted with}} the common {{understanding}} that long-distance dispersers should be less influenced by space (i.e., environmentally structured), while dispersal-limited species should be more influenced by space (Bahn et al. 2008; Shurin et al. 2009; Flinn et al. 2010). Instead, long-distance-dispersing species could have a better spatial structure than short-distance-dispersing species, as evidenced by comparing the explained variance for birds and amphibians. The dispersal ability of species may be inaccurate for predicting spatial autocorrelation patterns, which was found across different taxa, including animals, plants, and <b>parasites</b> (Harrison <b>et</b> al. 1992; Poulin 2003). Moreover, a previous field study showed that local dispersal did {{not contribute to the}} spatial autocorrelation of mistletoe richness per tree (Overton 1996). At a broad spatial scale, long-range dispersal was found to be important in structuring species diversity patterns. For example, long-distance dispersal was vital to the interplay of climatic conditions in determining the spread of the gypsy moth (Tobin and Blackburn 2007).|$|R
40|$|This {{study was}} {{designed}} to identify the external parasites and to evaluate their effects on mortality, growth and reproduction of poultry in the traditional rearing system in the sub-humid zone of Burkina Faso. Identification of external parasites was done on 500 of each species of chicken, guinea fowls and turkeys. For the evaluation of the effects of external parasites on the productivity of poultry, 324 chicks that were 6 weeks of age were randomly divided into 12 groups of 27 chicks each. Four of the groups was assigned at random to receive a treatment against external <b>parasites</b> (<b>ET),</b> 4 other groups were similarly assigned to receive a treatment against external parasites and another treatment against internal parasites (EIT). The 4 remaining groups were not treated against parasites (NT). Two mice species Liperus gallinae and Monopon gallinae have been found on both chicken and turkeys while Goniodes gigas was the only mice species parasiting chicken. The lice Echidnophaga gallinacea and the tick Argas persicus have been found to parasite chicken. Results of productivity trial showed that mortality due to effects of external parasites amounted to 13. 9 % of non treated poultry. Live weight of male birds increased from the base line of 850 g of the non-treated birds by 9. 8 % (950164. 3 g) due to treatment against external parasites and by 44. 5 % (1250133. 1 g) due to treatments against both external and internal parasites. Live weight of female birds increased similarly from 952. 5238. 7 g by only 3. 8 % (980. 536. 2 g) due to treatment against external parasites and then by 13. 5 % (1081. 6160. 2 g) due to treatment against both external and internal parasites.

With the recent arrival of complete genome sequences for three distinct trypanosomatid <b>parasites</b> (Berriman <b>et</b> al. 2005; El-Sayed et al., 2005 a and El-Sayed et al., 2005 b; Ivens et al. 2005), new insights into the unusual biology of this fascinating family of protozoan parasites, considered to occupy one of the deeper branches of eukaryotic phylogeny, are apparent. Focusing mainly in the general areas of genome architecture and metabolism, this overview discusses some biological and evolutionary insights that have arisen as a consequence of sequence availability for the medically relevant trypanosomatids Trypanosoma brucei, T. cruzi, and Leishmania major. Much of the disease burden caused by these parasites occurs in the developing world, typically afflicting poor or isolated communities. In the future, a key translational application will be integration of the trypanosomatid genome sequences into ongoing discovery and development programmes for much needed new drug...|$|R
50|$|In the {{experiment}} conducted by Pulkkinen et al. {{it was found}} that when food was limited in a population of crabs infected with daphnia, there were mortalities among the infected population of crabs.

Pulkkinen <b>et</b> al. also found that after a period of time there was a corresponding reduction in average size of crabs, and therefore the mortality rate due to malnutrition and environmental stress was reduced. This increased the parasite load within the population. Parasite load is a complex ecological phenomenon, often exhibiting a negative feedback loop, as it is within the interest of the parasite population for the host to survive infection.|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: Mosquitoes were {{collected}} by a human-bait-trap and a dog-bait-trap at two areas, suburban and rural, of Nagasaki City in 1968 and 1969 to compare the feeding preferences of mosquitoes for man and dogs. Species composition of mosquitoes collected by the two different traps was very similar to each other at both areas, and Armigeres subalbatus, Aedes albopictus and Culex pipiens pallens were predominant. It was considered that the latter two species may be important in transmitting the canine heartworm to man. Although the canine heartworm, Dirofilaria immitis, {{is known as a}} commonparasite of dogs in Japan, it is becoming a new problem also as a parasite causing zoonosis, because several human cases have recently been reported (Nishimura et al., 1954; Yoshimura and Yokogawa, 1970; Ishii and Fuse, 1974; Otsuru and Shiraki 1974). In our previous papers, it was reported that Nagasaki City and Omura City are heavily endemic areas of the <b>parasite</b> (Suenaga <b>et</b> al, 1971, 1974), and that itsmain vectors are Culex pipiens pallens and Aedes albopictus (Suenaga and Itoh, 1973; Suenaga, 1975).

30|$|An {{effective}} {{approach to}} enhancing prescribed fire knowledge and application {{has been the}} coupling of fire management with fire research by the Australian Department of Environment and Conservation, {{which has led to}} a large body of regionally specific research (Sneeuwjagt et al. 2013). Our experience at OSU suggests that research and management are highly synergistic, and that training students on both research fires and management fires enhances the research capacity while developing research-based prescribed fire guidelines that are specific to Oklahoma and the Great Plains. At OSU, the majority of the research fires were conducted by students with the supervision of only a few OSU employees. Assimilating an adequate fire crew can be very difficult and students have been {{an important part of the}} research process. This integration has led to research dealing with livestock <b>parasites</b> (Scasta <b>et</b> al. 2012, Polito et al. 2013), fuel combustion on grazed pastures (Scasta et al. 2014), invasive plant species (Cummings et al. 2007), and many more studies. Student experiences in the field can also be the impetus to additional types of fire research and inquiry that continue to address regional issues (for example, Weir and Scasta 2014). We recommend that universities encourage more integration of fire ecology research and experiential education to maximize benefits to both researchers and students.|$|R
40|$|Problems in the Belgian {{fisheries}} sector due to low fish prices, {{limitations in}} landings and high fuel costs, are {{putting pressure on}} the fishermen to look for other and more sustainable production methods, {{with the emphasis on}} diversification. Aquaculture might be a solution for at least a part of the problems. However, the short Belgian coastline is already used intensively for recreation, nature conservation and harbour activities, making coastal aquaculture almost impossible. Recent developments in offshore or open-ocean shellfish culture were a challenge to start aquaculture in the rough North Sea. Culture experiments with blue mussel (Mytilus edulis) started in 1998 at the ropes and grown over a period of 14 months to marketable size mussels.

The different shellfish production areas show differences in spat fall and growth, which indicates that a feasibility study is needed to determine the productivity and specific use of the different areas. The rough North Sea with its erratic waves and strong winds makes it hard to harvest these off-shore mussel cultures. Future research will focus on improvement of the harvesting techniques, mussel area site selection (e. g. windmill farms) and diversification towards other shellfish species such as flat oyster (Ostrea edulis) and scallop (Pecten sp.) ...|$|R
