40|$|A design {{concept for}} the {{receiver}} {{portion of a}} proposed free-space optical-communication terminal calls for integration of its communication and <b>pointing</b> <b>detectors.</b> As explained below, this would entail a departure from prior designs, in which <b>pointing</b> and communication <b>detectors</b> have been separate. As used here, communication detector denotes a single high-speed photodetector used for reception of a laser beam that has been modulated to convey information, while <b>pointing</b> <b>detector</b> denotes an array of photodetectors (typically, a quad-cell detector or a charge-coupled device) used in sensing the pointing error (the error in the aim of a receiver telescope, relative to the laser-beam axis). The <b>pointing</b> <b>detector</b> of this or any free-space optical-communication receiver is necessary for proper acquisition and tracking of the received laser beam. The suitably processed output of the <b>pointing</b> <b>detector</b> is fed back to a fine-steering mirror to reduce any pointing error and thereby maintain optimum reception. Heretofore, it has been common practice to pass the incoming laser beam through a beam splitter that sends about 10 percent of the beam power to a <b>pointing</b> <b>detector</b> and the rest to a separate communication detector, as illustrated in {{the upper part of}} the figure. One disadvantage of this is that because only 10 percent of the received signal power is available for use by the <b>pointing</b> <b>detector,</b> the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) at the <b>pointing</b> <b>detector</b> is lower than it otherwise would be. The performance of the <b>pointing</b> <b>detector</b> is correspondingly limited. Another disadvantage is that the alignment between the communication and <b>pointing</b> <b>detectors</b> is critical and must be ensured by means of a calibration procedure. According to the proposal, there would be no beam splitter. The communication and <b>pointing</b> <b>detectors</b> would be positioned coaxially in the same focal plane, as shown in the lower part of the figure: the communication detector would occupy the central part of the focal plane, while the <b>pointing</b> <b>detector</b> would occupy the surrounding area.

50|$|An open path {{detector}} usually {{costs more}} than a single <b>point</b> <b>detector,</b> so there is little incentive for applications that play to a point detector's strengths: where the <b>point</b> <b>detector</b> can be placed at the known location of the highest gas concentration, and a relatively slow response is acceptable. The open path detector excels in outdoor situations where, even if the likely source of the gas release is known, the evolution of the developing cloud or plume is unpredictable. Gas will almost certainly enter an extended linear beam before finding its way to any single chosen point. Also, point detectors in exposed outdoor locations require weather shields to be fitted, increasing the response time significantly. Open path detectors can also show a cost advantage in any application where a row of point detectors would be required to achieve the same coverage, for instance monitoring along a pipeline, or around the perimeter of a plant. Not only will one detector replace several, but the costs of installation, maintenance, cabling etc. are likely to be lower.|$|E

It describes a distribution of Haar wavelet responses within the interest point neighbourhood.

The indexing step is based on the sign of the Laplacian, which increases the matching speed and the robustness of the descriptor.|$|E

5000|$|Gauss-SIFT [...] {{is a pure}} image {{descriptor}} {{defined by}} performing all image measurements underlying the pure image descriptor in SIFT by Gaussian derivative responses as opposed to derivative approximations in an image pyramid as done in regular SIFT. In this way, discretization effects over space and scale {{can be reduced to}} a minimum allowing for potentially more accurate image descriptors. In Lindeberg (2015) [...] such pure Gauss-SIFT image descriptors were combined with a set of generalized scale-space interest points comprising the Laplacian of the Gaussian, the determinant of the Hessian, four new unsigned or signed Hessian feature strength measures as well as Harris-Laplace and Shi-and-Tomasi interests points. In an extensive experimental evaluation on a poster dataset comprising multiple views of 12 posters over scaling transformations up to a factor of 6 and viewing direction variations up to a slant angle of 45 degrees, it was shown that substantial increase in performance of image matching (higher efficiency scores and lower 1-precision scores) could be obtained by replacing Laplacian of Gaussian interest points by determinant of the Hessian interest points. Since difference-of-Gaussians interest points constitute a numerical approximation of Laplacian of the Gaussian interest points, this shows that a substantial increase in matching performance is possible by replacing the difference-of-Gaussians interest points in SIFT by determinant of the Hessian interest points. Additional increase in performance can furthermore be obtained by considering the unsigned Hessian feature strength measure [...] A quantitative comparison between the Gauss-SIFT descriptor and a corresponding Gauss-SURF descriptor did also show that Gauss-SIFT does generally perform significantly better than Gauss-SURF for a large number of different scale-space interest point detectors. This study therefore shows that discregarding discretization effects the pure image descriptor in SIFT is significantly better than the pure image descriptor in SURF, whereas the underlying interest <b>point</b> <b>detector</b> in SURF, which can be seen as numerical approximation to scale-space extrema of the determinant of the Hessian, is significantly better than the underlying interest <b>point</b> <b>detector</b> in SIFT.|$|E
50|$|Any thermoacoustic {{imaging device}} {{requires}} {{a source of}} electromagnetic radiation, be it a laser or a microwave antenna, to deliver energy to the anatomy being studied, and one or more acoustic detectors coupled acoustically to the outside surface of the anatomy, as is illustrated in Fig. 4. The typical acoustic detector is an ultrasound transducer, which is commonly made of a piezo-electric material that converts detected pressure to an electrical signal. Thermoacoustic waves are induced within the anatomy wherever absorption takes place, {{and the strength of}} these thermoacoustic waves is proportional to the energy absorbed within the tissue. Some of these waves propagate through the anatomy over some time interval (time-of-flight) before being detected by {{one or more of the}} acoustic transducers. The exact time-of-flight is proportional to the distance between an absorption site and a transducer, assuming for the moment that each transducer is a <b>point</b> <b>detector.</b> For any given time-of-flight, each transducer will receive the sum of the thermoacoustic waves originating at the same distance from the detector in question as is illustrated in Fig. 5. For this reason, ambiguity arises when attempting to localize an absorption site with a point transducer. A variety of stratgies have been employed to mitigate this ambiguity.|$|E
5000|$|Feature {{detection}} {{is necessary}} to automatically find correspondences between images. Robust correspondences are {{required in order to}} estimate the necessary transformation to align an image with the image it is being composted on.Corners, blobs, harris corners and Difference of gaussian of harris corners (DoG) are good features since they are repeatable and distinct.One of the first operators for interest point detection was developed by Hans P. Moravec in 1977 for his research involving the automatic navigation of a robot through a clustered environment. It was also Moravec who defined the concept of [...] "points of interest" [...] in an image and concluded these interest points could be used to find matching regions in different images. The Moravec operator {{is considered to be a}} corner detector because it defines interest points as points where there are large intensity variations in all directions. This often is the case at corners. It is interesting to note, however, that Moravec was not specifically interested in finding corners, just distinct regions in an image that could be used to register consecutive image frames.Harris and Stephens improved upon Moravec's corner detector by considering the differential of the corner score with respect to direction directly. They needed it as a processing step to build interpretations of a robot's environment based on image sequences. Like Moravec, they needed a method to match corresponding points in consecutive image frames, but were interested in tracking both corners and edges between frames.SIFT and SURF are recent keypoint or interest <b>point</b> <b>detector</b> algorithms but a point to note is that these are patented and their commercial usage restricted.Once a feature has been detected then a descriptor method like SIFT descriptor can be applied to later match them.|$|E

Specifically, it is shown how a significant increase in matching performance can be obtained in relation to the underlying interest <b>point</b> <b>detectors</b> in the SIFT and the SURF operators.
