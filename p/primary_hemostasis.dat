30|$|Fg is a plasma {{glycoprotein}} of 340  kDa, made of two subunits. It {{is involved}} in both the <b>primary</b> and secondary <b>hemostasis</b> and is an hemostatic agent routinely used [10]. The two subunits of Fg are cleaved by thrombin in fibrinopeptids A and B, which polymerize to form the fibrin chains.

25|$|Coagulation begins almost {{instantly}} after {{an injury to}} the blood vessel has damaged the endothelium lining the vessel. Leaking of blood through the endothelium initiates two processes: changes in platelets, and the exposure of subendothelial tissue factor to plasma Factor VII, which ultimately leads to fibrin formation. Platelets immediately form a plug {{at the site of}} injury; this is called <b>primary</b> <b>hemostasis.</b> Secondary hemostasis occurs simultaneously: Additional coagulation factors or clotting factors beyond Factor VII (listed below) respond in a complex cascade to form fibrin strands, which strengthen the platelet plug.|$|E
2500|$|Activated {{platelets}} {{will release}} {{the contents of}} stored granules into the blood plasma. The granules include ADP, serotonin, platelet-activating factor (PAF), vWF, platelet factor 4, and thromboxane A2 (TXA2), which, in turn, activate additional platelets. The granules' contents activate a Gq-linked protein receptor cascade, resulting in increased calcium concentration in the platelets' cytosol. The calcium activates protein kinase C, which, in turn, activates phospholipase A2 (PLA2). PLA2 then modifies the integrin membrane glycoprotein IIb/IIIa, increasing its affinity to bind fibrinogen. The activated platelets change shape from spherical to stellate, and the fibrinogen cross-links with glycoprotein IIb/IIIa aid in aggregation of adjacent platelets [...] (completing <b>primary</b> <b>hemostasis).</b>|$|E
2500|$|The main {{function}} of platelets is {{to contribute to}} hemostasis: the process of stopping bleeding {{at the site of}} interrupted endothelium. They gather at the site and unless the interruption is physically too large, they plug the hole. First, platelets attach to substances outside the interrupted endothelium: adhesion. Second, they change shape, turn on receptors and secrete chemical messengers: activation. Third, they connect to each other through receptor bridges: aggregation. Formation of this platelet plug (<b>primary</b> <b>hemostasis)</b> is associated with activation of the coagulation cascade with resultant fibrin deposition and linking (secondary hemostasis). These processes may overlap: the spectrum is from a predominantly platelet plug, or [...] "white clot" [...] to a predominantly fibrin clot, or [...] "red clot" [...] or the more typical mixture. The final result is the clot. Some would add the subsequent clot retraction and platelet inhibition as fourth and fifth steps to the completion of the process and still others a sixth step wound repair.|$|E

40|$|Previous {{studies of}} von Willebrand disease {{indicate}} that a deficiency of blood clotting Factor VIII/von Willebrand factor (FVIII/vWF) activity {{is responsible for the}} failure of platelets to participate fully in the initial stages of hemostasis. We have recently identified specific FVIII/vWF binding sites on platelets, suggesting that the interaction of these sites with FVIII/vWF may be functionally important in the development of platelet clumps. We have now studied how different ristocetin concentrations, various known platelet aggregation inhibitors, and the exposure of platelets to proteases affect the ability of platelets to bind FVIII/vWF and to form aggregates. Our results demonstrate a highly significant linear correlation between the degree of FVIII/vWF receptor binding and the extent of ristocetin-induced platelet aggregation. Because neither FVIII/vWF binding nor platelet aggregation occurs after platelets are exposed to low concentrations of proteases, the FVIII/vWF receptors must be in the platelet membrane. We conclude that the interaction between FVIII/vWF protein and its receptors on the platelet membrane is an important mechanism by which platelet aggregation occurs during <b>primary</b> phase <b>hemostasis...</b>|$|R

40|$|Although {{platelets}} {{are best}} known as <b>primary</b> mediators of <b>hemostasis,</b> this function intimately associates them with inflammatory processes, {{and it has been}} increasingly recognized that platelets play an active role in both innate and adaptive immunity. For example, platelet adhesive interactions with leukocytes and endothelial cells via P-selectin can lead to several pro-inflammatory events, including leukocyte rolling and activation, production of cytokine cascades, and recruitment of the leukocytes to sites of tissue damage. Superimposed on this, platelets express immunologically-related molecules such as CD 40 L and Toll-like receptors that have been shown to functionally modulate innate immunity. Furthermore, platelets themselves can interact with microorganisms, and several viruses have been shown to cross-react immunologically with platelet antigens.

40|$|The liver is an {{essential}} player in the pathway of coagulation in both <b>primary</b> and secondary <b>hemostasis</b> {{as it is the}} site of synthesis of all coagulation factors and their inhibitors. Liver diseases are associated with complex changes in coagulation and the delicate balance between pro and antithrombotic factors is preserved but reset to a lower level. There is growing evidence that portal and hepatic vein thrombosis is cause of disease progression in cirrhotic patients and worsens hemostatic abnormalities. These hemostatic abnormalities do not always lead to spontaneous bleeding, which may be triggered only by additional factors, such as infections. Usually therapy for coagulation disorders in liver disease is needed only during bleeding or before invasive procedures. In patients with end stage liver disease liver transplantation is the only treatment available, which can restore normal hemostasis, and correct genetic clotting defects.

5000|$|Platelet plug formation- Platelets {{adhere to}} damaged {{endothelium}} {{to form a}} platelet plug (<b>primary</b> <b>hemostasis)</b> and then degranulate. This process is regulated through thromboregulation. Plug formation is activated by a glycoprotein called Von Willebrand factor (vWF), which is found in plasma. Platelets play one of major roles in the hemostatic process. When platelets come across the injured endothelium cells, they change shape, release granules and ultimately become ‘sticky’. Platelets express certain receptors, {{some of which are}} used for the adhesion of platelets to collagen. When platelets are activated, they express glycoprotein receptors that interact with other platelets, producing aggregation and adhesion. Platelets release cytoplasmic granules such as adenosine diphosphate (ADP), serotonin and thromboxane A2. Adenosine diphosphate (ADP) attracts more platelets to the affected area, serotonin is a vasoconstrictor and thromboxane A2 assists in platelet aggregation, vasoconstriction and degranulation. As more chemicals are released more platelets stick and release their chemicals; creating a platelet plug and continuing the process in a positive feedback loop. Platelets alone are responsible for stopping the bleeding of unnoticed wear and tear of our skin on a daily basis. This is referred to as <b>primary</b> <b>hemostasis.</b>|$|E
50|$|Thromboregulation is {{the series}} of {{mechanisms}} in how a primary clot is regulated. These mechanisms include, competitive inhibition or negative feedback. It includes <b>primary</b> <b>hemostasis,</b> which {{is the process of}} how blood platelets adhere to the endothelium of an injured blood vessel. Platelet aggregation is fundamental to repair vascular damage and the initiation of the blood thrombus formation. The elimination of clots is also part of thromboregulation. Failure in platelet clot regulation may cause hemorrhage or thrombosis. Substances called thromboregulators control every part of these events.|$|E
5000|$|Thromboregulation is also {{in charge}} of {{regulating}} the process of clot elimination, called <b>primary</b> <b>hemostasis</b> inhibition. These inhibitors are substances that prevent the clot formation by preventing platelet adhesion. Platelet inhibition is important to prevent thrombotic episodes or the formation of blood clot and consequently preventing heart attacks and strokes. Some <b>primary</b> <b>hemostasis</b> inhibitors are cAMP, prostacyclin, PGE1, and kistrin. cAMP, cyclic adenosine monophosphate, phosphorylate messengers via protein kinase A (PKA). These signaling elements include thromboxane A2, receptor type α, phospholipase Cβ3, and IP3 receptors. Signalization in platelets is very sensitive in cAMP levels. Nitric oxide (NO) stimulates cGMP production and therefore the activation cGMP-dependent protein kinase (G kinase). This kinase inhibits Gαq-phospholipase C-inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate signaling and the mobilization of calcium inside the cell for thromboxane A2. [...] PGI2, prostacyclin, binds to IP receptors that catalyze cAMP formation. This process is mediated via GTP-binding protein Gs and adenylyl cyclase. PGE1 binds to IP receptors. IP receptors bind with ionophores that induce ADP and serotonin secretion. PGE1 inhibits the secretion of factors that stimulate platelet aggregation by competitive inhibition. Kistrin is a protein inhibitor of platelet aggregation. It belongs to the homologous family of glycoprotein IIb-IIa antagonists. Kistrin has an adhesion site that binds to GP IIb-IIIa.|$|E

[...] Bleeding peptic ulcers require endoscopic treatment if they show evidence of high risk stigmata of re-bleeding, such as evidence of active bleeding or oozing on endoscopy or {{the presence of a}} visible blood vessel around the ulcer. [...] The alternatives to endoscopic clipping of peptic ulcers are thermal therapy (such as electrocautery to burn the vessel causing the bleeding), or injection of epinephrine to constrict the blood vessel. Comparative studies between endoclips and thermal therapy make the point that endoclips cause less trauma to the mucosa around the ulcer than electrocautery, but no definitive advantage to either approach has reached consensus by gastroenterologists.|$|R
40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] University of Washington, 2001 The {{goal of the}} {{acoustic}} hemostasis project is to locate a hemorrhage using diagnostic ultrasound and halt the bleeding using high intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU). To enhance the imaging of blood, the use of ultrasound contrast agents (UCA; gas filled microbubbles that increase the echogenicity of fluids), has been proposed {{as a means to}} locate internal bleeding (Schmiedl et al., 1999). This study investigates the mechanisms of HIFU-induced bioeffects in blood which may lead to <b>primary,</b> or platelet-related, <b>hemostasis.</b> Using platelet rich plasma (PRP), we investigated the effect of 1. 1 -MHz continuous wave (CW) HIFU on platelet activation, aggregation and adhesion to a collagen-coated surface. Flow cytometry, laser aggregometry, and environmental scanning electron microscopy (ESEM) were used to quantify platelet activation and aggregation, and to observe adhesion to a collagen-coated surface. To investigate the role of cavitation as a mechanism for platelet aggregation, a 5 -MHz passive cavitation detector was used during aggregation trials to monitor cavitation activity, which was then quantified to provide a relative measure of the amount of cavitation that occurred in each aggregation trial. The effects of HIFU induced cavitation on platelet aggregation in PRP were investigated by enhancing cavitation activity through use of UCA, and by limiting cavitation activity through use of an overpressure system. Platelet aggregation was measured in PRP with laser aggregometry, and in whole blood using an impedance measurement technique. Doppler ultrasound and high speed camera observations were used to measure bulk streaming velocities, providing an estimate of shear stresses due to bulk flow. Our results show that in PRP, increased cavitation activity lowers the intensity threshold to produce platelet aggregation and decreased cavitation activity in the overpressure system raises the intensity threshold for platelet aggregation. Resulting platelet aggregation in whole blood is less than in samples of PRP for comparable cavitation doses. Shear stresses due to bulk flow are insufficient to stimulate platelet aggregation. It was determined that HIFU can activate platelets, stimulate them to aggregate and promote their adherence to a collagen-coated surface. In principle, HIFU can stimulate <b>primary,</b> or platelet-related, <b>hemostasis.</b> This study explores the HIFU exposure mechanisms responsible for inducing platelet activity in vitro...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background Blood {{platelets}} {{undergo a}} carefully regulated change in shape {{to serve as}} the <b>primary</b> mediators of <b>hemostasis</b> and thrombosis. These processes manifest through platelet spreading and aggregation and are dependent on platelet actin cytoskeletal changes orchestrated by the Rho GTPase family member Rac 1. To elucidate how Rac 1 is regulated in platelets, we captured Rac 1 -interacting proteins from platelets and identified Rac 1 -associated proteins by mass spectrometry. Findings Here, we demonstrate that Rac 1 captures the Rac guanine nucleotide exchange factor P-Rex 1 from platelet lysates. Western blotting experiments confirmed that P-Rex 1 is expressed in platelets and associated with Rac 1. To investigate the functional role of platelet P-Rex 1, platelets from P-Rex 1 -/- -deficient mice were treated with platelet agonists or exposed to platelet activating surfaces of fibrinogen, collagen and thrombin. Platelets from P-Rex 1 -/- mice responded to platelet agonists and activating surfaces similarly to wild type platelets. Conclusions These findings suggest that P-Rex 1 is not required for Rac 1 -mediated platelet activation and that the GEF activities of P-Rex 1 may be more specific to GPCR chemokine receptor mediated processes in immune cells and tumor cells. </p...|$|R

The predictive ability of fibrinogen for 3 -month mortality in AoCLF patients was assessed using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve and multivariable logistic regression analyses.

40|$|Endothelial {{cells are}} covered by a {{delicate}} meshwork of glycoproteins known as the glycocalyx. Under normophysiological conditions the glycocalyx plays {{an active role in}} maintaining vascular homeostasis by deterring <b>primary</b> and secondary <b>hemostasis</b> and leukocyte adhesion and by regulating vascular permeability and tone. During (micro) vascular oxidative and nitrosative stress, which prevails in numerous metabolic (diabetes), vascular (atherosclerosis, hypertension), and surgical (ischemia/reperfusion injury, trauma) disease states, the glycocalyx is oxidatively and nitrosatively modified and degraded, which culminates in an exacerbation of the underlying pathology. Consequently, glycocalyx degradation due to oxidative/nitrosative stress has far-reaching clinical implications. In this review the molecular mechanisms of reactive oxygen and nitrogen species-induced destruction of the endothelial glycocalyx are addressed in the context of hepatic ischemia/reperfusion injury as a model disease state. Specifically, the review focuses on (i) the mechanisms of glycocalyx degradation during hepatic ischemia/reperfusion, (ii) the molecular and cellular players involved in the degradation process, and (iii) its implications for hepatic pathophysiology. These topics are projected against a background of liver anatomy, glycocalyx function and structure, and the biology/biochemistry and the sources/targets of reactive oxygen and nitrogen species. The majority of the glycocalyx-related mechanisms elucidated for hepatic ischemia/reperfusion are extrapolatable to the other aforementioned disease states. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc.
