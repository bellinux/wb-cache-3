40|$|The {{influence}} of healthcare enviroment on individual wellbeing has been object {{of great interest}} during the last decades, with the aim to identify the most <b>proprer</b> design criteria, able {{to comply with the}} contemporary patient-centered vision of care and medicine. the article presents the results of a multidisciplinary research path in order to identify suitable design criteria for the humanization of the existing facilities, in a gender-sensitive way...|$|E
40|$|For {{the control}} of {{schistosomiasis}} in irrigated agricultural schemes, the inhabitants must have: 1) Enough potable water. 2) Latrines. 3) <b>Proprer</b> health education to motivate the community {{to participate in the}} control. 4) Proper diagnostic facilities. 5) Proper availabel chemotherapy. 6) Focal mullusciciding. 7) If possible trial of biological and environmental methods control. Following the above methods, we could reduce the prevalence of schistosomiasis from over 50 % to about 13 %. The important achievement, is the improvement of the health of the community; therefore more production and reduced morbidity and mortality...|$|E
40|$|O presente artigo apresenta argumentos em defesa da hipótese de que nomes próprios gerais são impossíveis no contexto da filosofia geral de Stuart Mill. Minha tese é contrária à posição de John Skorupski sobre esta questão. Ofereço dois argumentos que representam, respectivamente, duas diferentes perspectivas: pragmático e sistemático. No primeiro, analiso o problema dos nomes próprios gerais no contexto da linguagem natural. No segundo, discuto o problema no contexto interno do Sistema de Lógica de Mill. This paper {{presents}} {{arguments in}} defense of the hypothesis that general <b>proprer</b> names are impossible in the context of Stuart Mill's philosophy of language. My thesis is contrary to John Skorupski's position to this subject. I offer two arguments related, respectively, to two different perspectives: the pragmatic and the systematic. In the first one I analyze the problem of general proper names in the context of natural language. In the second one I discuss this problem in the inner context of Mill's System of logic...|$|E
40|$|The {{establishment}} of neural connections requires activity-dependent and independent mechanisms. The well-understood {{organization of the}} visual system comprises an excellent model to analyze the contribution {{of each of these}} mechanisms in brain wiring. Retinal projections form a visual map in their target organized in a topographic and eyespecific manner (Huberman et al., 2009). This specific organization is crucial for <b>proprer</b> vision. I will first review how retinal projections are guided and map into the brain, and the mechanisms involving guidance molecules and retinal activity (Petros et al., 2009; Huberman et al. 2009). Second, I will illustrate how a change in the guidance of retinal ganglion cell axons at the optic chiasm midline affect their projection using different examples (Rebsam et al., 2009; Rebsam et al., 2011). Finally, I will discuss the role of spontaneous retinal activity for the refinement of visual maps (Huberman et al., 2009) mentioning our recent unpublished work on the role of presynaptic release on retinal axon refinement...|$|E
