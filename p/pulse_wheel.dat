40|$|In today's digital ({{electronic}}s) world, people's {{desire for}} electronic goods that ease their life at work, and leisure is increasing {{the complexity of}} the products of the embedded systems industry. For example, MP 3 players for listening to music and cell phones for communicating with people. The gap between the hardware and software parts of embedded systems is being reduced by the use of System Level Design Languages (SLDL) that can model both hardware and software simultaneously. One such SLDL is SpecC. In this thesis, a SpecC model of a Real Time Operating System (RTOS) is constructed. It is shown how RTOS features can be incorporated into a SpecC model. The model is used to develop an application involving a robot avoiding obstacles to reach its destination. The RTOS model operates similar to the actual RTOS in the robot. The application includes a testbench model for the robot, including features such as interrupts, sonar sensors and <b>wheel</b> <b>pulses,</b> so that its operation closely resembles the actual robot. The sensor model is programmed to generate the values from the four sensor receivers, similar to the behaviour of the sensors on the actual robot. Also the <b>pulses</b> from the <b>wheels</b> and associated interrupts are programmed in the model so that it resembles the interrupts and <b>wheel</b> <b>pulses</b> present on actual robot...|$|R

25|$|The ball mouse has two freely {{rotating}} rollers. These {{are located}} 90 degrees apart. One roller detects the forward–backward {{motion of the}} mouse and other the left–right motion. Opposite the two rollers is a third one (white, in the photo, at 45 degrees) that is spring-loaded to push the ball against the other two rollers. Each roller is on the same shaft as an encoder wheel that has slotted edges; the slots interrupt infrared light beams to generate electrical <b>pulses</b> that represent <b>wheel</b> movement. Each wheel's disc has a pair of light beams, located so that a given beam becomes interrupted or again starts to pass light freely when the other beam of the pair is about halfway between changes.|$|R
40|$|We {{describe}} here a 12 -channel aggregometer, {{evolved from}} the instrument described by Beug & Gerisch in 1972, which records the course of aggregation or agglutination of cells or other particles by following the changes in light-scattering of the aggregating suspension. The instrument incorporates a simple memory system for condensing the data, introduces an improved cuvette design, and can be adjusted in its responsiveness to light-scattering by particles of different sizes. In our aggregometer, a vertical wheel in an opaque thermostatted chamber accommodates up to 12 cuvettes each containing a cell suspension and an air bubble. The constant rising of the bubble as the wheel rotates causes the stirring action which promotes aggregation. At {{a certain point in}} its rotational path, each cuvette is penetrated by a beam of light focused upon an absorbing beam stop centred in front of a photomultiplier tube. Particles suspended in the cuvette scatter a portion of the light beyond the beam stop into the photomultiplier tube to produce an electrical pulse proportional to the photon input. Collection of these <b>pulses</b> with the <b>wheel</b> in continuous motion avoids any disturbance of the course of aggregation. The pulses are routed to memory circuits for summation and eventual recording by a 12 -channe...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Experiments {{were carried}} out using {{simulated}} den cages to delineate specific char-acteristics of phase delaying in circadian photoentrainment of a nocturnal rodent, the flying squirrel. The principal experiments entailed presentation of one to five consecutive 15 -min white-light pulses per activity cycle at activity onset to animals free-running in darkness, {{in order to determine}} the immediate and final phase-shifting effect. Auxiliary experiments recorded entrainment patterns on light-dark (LD) schedules in the den cages. Phase response curves (PRCs) based on 15 -min white-light <b>pulses</b> in standard <b>wheel</b> cages were also constructed for these animals as background information for interpreting the phase-delaying experiments. Exposure of a den animal to light by light sampling at the time of initial arousal from the rest state at circadian time (CT) 12, either by an LD schedule or by a 15 -min light pulse, resulted in a return to the nest box for a short rest period. The phase delay occurring after a single light exposure at activity onset was equal to the induced rest, thus suggesting an immediate phase shift. The maximum delay was about 11 / 2 hr/cycle, with the amount of delay related to the number of light exposures. During the photoentrained state on an LD schedule, the activity rhythm of a den-housed animal was essentially free-running on the days following a phas...|$|R
5000|$|Jack, Paul, and Heather {{discover}} that Patty has been impersonating Emily and they {{rush to the}} sanitarium to get her. Patty, {{knowing full well that}} her lies had been revealed, went to the cell and took Emily's place again. She gave the real Emily a shot that would make her seem to be dead and barely have a <b>pulse,</b> Patty then <b>wheeled</b> her down to the morgue and left a Jane Doe tag on her foot. On May 10, Jack is with Patty in the cell and he figures out what Patty did because he could smell the peroxide and see the cat scratch she had. He begged with her to tell him where Emily is and all Patty said was [...] "she's gone" [...] and Jack ran down to the morgue and found her body about to be cut open for an autopsy, Jack was crying and thought she was dead until he saw a tear run down her cheek. She then wakes up and they go to Patty's cell where Patty is about to commit suicide and Emily talks her out of it. Jack then takes Emily to the hospital. Emily and Jack share a tearful farewell as Emily states that she will be moving away from Genoa City, most likely back to Minneapolis, where she lived and worked before her arrival.|$|R
5000|$|The 3-D Imager, {{invented by}} John Ross, turns the 2-D {{black-and-white}} images {{drawn by the}} Vectrex into a color 3-D experience. The imager works by spinning a disk {{in front of the}} viewer's eyes. The disk is black for 180 degrees and in some cases has 60 degree wedges of transparent red, green, and blue filters. The user looks through this to the Vectrex screen. The Vectrex synchronizes the rotation of the disk to the software frame rate as it draws 6 screens: with the right eye covered: the left eye red image, then green, and then the blue image is drawn... and then, while the left eye is covered by the black 180 degree sector: the right eye red, green, and then the blue image is drawn. Only one eye will see the Vectrex screen and its 3 associated images (or colors) at any one time while the other will be blocked by the 180 degree mask. The prototype was made in the plastic casework of a Viewmaster. The disc spins freely and is driven by a motor. The Vectrex software generates its own frame-rate and compares it to an index signal from the glasses once per revolution. Score is kept of how many wheel rotations are early compared to the software frame rate, and how many are late. The software tries to keep these two trends equal by adjusting the power being delivered to the motor that spins the filter and mask <b>wheel.</b> <b>Pulse</b> Width Modulation (PWM) is used to control the motor speed: the ratio of the [...] "on" [...] time versus the [...] "off" [...] time of a rapid stream of power pulses to the motor. In this way the software synchronizes the wheel rotation to the software's frame rate, or drawing time, for the combined and repeating group of up to 6 evolving images.|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} the {{analysis}} on percentage of wheel slip for a passenger car using GPS and wheel speed sensor. The objective of this thesis is to analyze the percentage of wheel slip for a passenger car in a various velocity, road condition and driving mode. The thesis describes the post-processing method to analyze the percentage of wheel slip and identify the effective rolling radius and the longitudinal tire stiffness for maximum tire life and performance. Driving and braking behaviour of vehicle were both studied in this thesis for paved and unpaved sandy road condition which commonly the contributing factors to the wheel slip to occur. The data used for the analysis is obtained through experimental test using UMP Test Car which has been installed with <b>Wheel</b> <b>Pulse</b> Transducer, Global Positioning System and DEWESOFT software for data acquisition purpose. The post-processing method was performed using Flexpro and Microsoft Office Excel. The post-processing method to analyze the percentage of wheel slip was performed using the SAE definition of wheel slip and the percent error in the distance travel by the car between free rolling and actual condition. Finally, the longitudinal force, the effective rolling radius and the longitudinal tire stiffness was determined for both driving and braking maneuver of vehicle on paved and unpaved sandy road condition. From the results, {{it is observed that}} the percentage of wheel slip during driving maneuver is higher for unpaved sandy road condition compares to that the paved road. It is also observed that the longitudinal force of the tire is lower for unpaved sandy road compare to the paved road condition. The effective rolling radius of the tire during driving maneuver was determined to be lower compare to the free rolling radius of the tire. During braking manuever, the results show that the percentage of wheel slip is higher for unpaved sandy road compare to that for paved road condition. The longitudinal force and tire stiffness also observed lower for unpaved sandy road condition. The effective rolling radius of the tire during braking determined higher compared to that in the free rolling radius. The results concluded that the percentage of wheel slip is strongly dependent to the longitudinal force and the tire road friction. Therefore, effective rolling radius and longitudinal tire stiffness obtained can significantly use to improve tire design and construction. The results also can be use to improve the energy usage efficiency and fuel consumption of vehicle...|$|R
40|$|A {{project to}} {{construct}} a high-speed road deflection tester was initiated in the 1991. A mid-sized truck {{was used as a}} carrier for the first prototype. The results were promising and it was decided to build a full-size truck system. The new vehicle, based on a Scania R 143 ML, was completed in 1997. The Road Deflection Tester (RDT) is equipped with two arrays of twenty noncontact laser sensors that collects transversal surface profiles at normal traffic speeds. One profile, placed between the wheel axles, constitutes an unloaded case. The other profile, just behind the rear axle of the vehicle, constitutes the loaded case. By subtracting the front cross profile from the corresponding rear one, the "deflection profile" is assessed. The deflection is assumed to vary with the stiffness of the road. In order to produce a large load on the rear wheels the engine was mounted {{in the back of the}} vehicle, slightly behind the rear axle. In testing mode the rear axle force is approximately 112 kN, and the front axle force is about 30 kN. An incremental <b>wheel</b> <b>pulse</b> transducer, two force transducers and two accelerometers, an optical speedometer and a gyroscope are also mounted on the RDT. The first test programme was carried out in 1998. Due to the careful choice of test sections, data from these sections still produce the best results. A smaller test programme was carried out in 2001, and a larger one in 2002 when the RDT was taken to England and France for demonstration. Promising results, both on an aggregated scale and for individual test sections, have been obtained. The RDT compares favourably with the Falling Weight Deflectometer. Short histories of road construction and road research give some historical and cultural background to the more recent developments. A more comprehensive history of rolling deflectographs presents all devices found in the literature from the start in the mid-fifties when the California Traveling Deflectograph and Lacroix Deflectograph were constructed, to the latest laser based High-Speed Deflectograph. Many references are given for further reading. The data acquisition hardware on the RDT system consist of sensors, signal converters, signal processing cards, an industrial computer for data communication, and an ordinary PC for operating the equipment and data storage. The software used to evaluate the data is written entirely in Matlab. Many levels of pre-processing make evaluation relatively fast, and the modularised design makes it easy to implement new evaluation algorithms in a clean and efficient way. A literature survey on the deformations of solids under static and moving load is presented in Appendix A. The static case started with Boussinesq in 1885, was much developed in the sixties, but since the eighties only a very limited amount of new results have been published. The moving load case, on the other hand, is still an field of active research and development. QC 2010110...|$|R
