50|$|As {{a member}} of the House, Williams served on the Education Committee. His most notable actions were in {{opposition}} to an education reform package proposed by Governor Martha Layne Collins, a Democrat, during a special legislative session in July 1985. Williams opposed a provision of the plan that required county officials to raise additional tax revenue in order to participate in school construction program; he said that counties which were owed large amounts in delinquent taxes would have to raise tax rates above the state minimum in order to collect the requisite funds. He offered several amendments to the plan, including the repeal of a provision to <b>pilot</b> a career <b>ladder</b> program for educators and a requirement that the state retirement system pay the full health insurance premiums of retired teachers and their spouses. All of Williams' amendments were defeated, except one to maintain the same qualifications for writing aides that were required of kindergarten aides. After the session, Williams and Representative John Harper charged that Collins delayed approval of public works grant projects in their districts in retaliation for their opposition to the reform plan; Collins denied that.|$|R

40|$|In 2003, the Florida {{legislature}} appropriated {{funds to}} finance pilot programs (1012. 231, Florida Statutes) {{to prepare for}} the 2004 - 2005 school year in which pay for performance initiatives were to be implemented in each district. Therefore, {{the purpose of this study}} was to examine and describe the planning, processes, and implications of a <b>pilot</b> career <b>ladder</b> program that was implemented into a large Florida school district in the spring of 2004. During data collection, the program was terminated therefore creating a second purpose that sought to describe residual implications of a program when it is discontinued. Data collected for this study were used to respond to six specific research questions. The first inquired about the planning process prior to implementation. Archival documents were used to determine whether research-based strategies were involved. The second through the fifth questions rely heavily on survey and structured interview data collected by the district and the primary researcher respectively and seek to determine critical perspectives from teachers and administrators regarding the career ladder including knowledge, fairness, and implications for school and district. The sixth question asks whether residual effects remain in place after an initiative has been terminated. Particularly, as a major finding, time for implementation was a theme throughout the study as most respondents were concerned about the short timeline this program had to develop fully. Stakeholder buy-in and understanding of program roles emerged from the data. However, the notion of a mentor that was given the time and resources was frequently mentioned as a benefit to new teachers and the school overall. Furthermore, respondents saw the potential long-term benefit of staff development that would allow highly trained master teachers to coach new and struggling teachers during the day in a clinical setting. There was evidence that this program did have an initial negative impact on the culture of the schools in the district. One unplanned aspect of this case study was the fact that the program was terminated at the state level. This had implications for all stakeholders and could be a strong factor in later implementations; therefore, this would require further study...|$|R
5000|$|Typically a Delaware River and Bay pilot boards a ship as {{it passes}} Lewes, Delaware, {{entering}} the Delaware Bay, and guides the vessel up the bay and into the canal to Chesapeake City.

40|$|This {{invention}} {{relates to}} a <b>pilot</b> <b>ladder</b> designed as to facilitate embarking to and disembarking from a ship from/to a pilot boat in safety conditions, also in rough seas. The ladder has modified steps and represents a noticeable improvement {{in respect of}} the performances of the conventional ladders. The improvement being obtained by realizing a handle portion in the central region of the step which enables the user to grip the step and to have more movement freedom and to maintain a more balanced condition particularly {{when he has to}} turn in order to descend from the ladder. The handle portion is formed by realizing a slot (33) in the central region of the step; in particular, the handle to be easily grasped is formed by the region (27) existing between the slot and the step edge facing the people who is passing from a craft to another craft. The decrease in the resistant cross section of the step {{as a consequence of the}} slot can be largely compensated by a greater thickness in the region (28) existing between the slot and the step edge contacting the flank of the craft...|$|E
40|$|This study {{investigated}} the individual power of teachers as subordinates in elementary schools. It focused on the informal social structure in "good" elementary schools and the roles played by principals, teachers who held formal governance positions, itinerant teachers, and participants in the district's career <b>ladder</b> <b>pilot</b> program. Roles sampled were (1) providers of moral support, (2) sources of teaching expertise, (3) dispensers of procedural information, and (4) those able to "get things done" in the school. Peer and principal dependency data were also collected. Teachers and principals in five elementary schools in a single school district were sampled twice in a two year period. Findings were: (1) Although "good" principals received high total scores for providing resources to the faculty, there were instances when individual teachers scored as high or higher than the principal. (2) Faculty and principals depended on providers of moral support more than they depended {{on any of the}} traditionally power-producing roles. (3) Teachers depended on peers mostly for moral support, less for teaching expertise and "getting things done," and least for information. Teachers depended on the principal for moral support and information, less for "getting things done," and least for teaching expertise. (4) Full-time classroom teachers and specialists were most active in the social structure. Part-time teachers, itinerant teachers, and special services personnel, such as psychologists, speech/language pathologists, etc., were not key participants. Some full-time teachers, such as fine arts, physical education, and self-contained special education teachers were less active. (5) Teachers holding formal governance positions in the school established or gained influence while holding the formal positions, and they apparently did not lose influence the year after leaving the positions. Formal positions were held by full-time classroom teachers and only occasionally by a specialist. (6) Career ladder candidates or participants established or gained influence in the school's social structure during the career ladder process. Itinerant teachers and individuals who teach specialized curricula were more active in the career ladder program {{than they were in the}} school governance network...|$|R
