The precursor of the style was the Italian-born engineer Alula Baldassarini, who popularized the use of stone on the frontispieces in 1925. Some of this early examples were labeled chalet inglés ("English chalet"), a type of bungalow or cottage which flourished between 1925 and 1935. Baldassarini also developed a technique known as bastón roto ("broken stick"), which consisted in rectangular stone bricks irregularly arranged on vertical and horizontal joints.|$|E
25|$|By {{historical}} accident, all Wren's large-scale secular commissions dated from {{after the}} 1680s. At {{the age of}} 50 his personal development, as was that of English architecture, {{was ready for a}} monumental but humane architecture, in which the scales of individual parts relates both to the whole and to the <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>used</b> them. The first large project Wren designed, the Chelsea Hospital (1682–92), does not entirely satisfy the eye in this respect, but met its brief with distinction and such success that even in the 21st century it fulfills its original function. The reconstruction of the state room at Windsor Castle was notable for the integration of architecture, sculpture and painting. This commission was in the hand of Hugh May, who died in February 1684, before the construction finished; Wren assumed his post and finalised the works.|$|E

25|$|For several centuries, {{the site}} was used for {{religious}} purposes by both Hindus and Muslims. In 1822, the claim was made {{for the first time}} that the mosque stood on the site of Rama's birth, or the Ram Janmabhoomi. Citing this claim, the Hindu sect Nirmohi Akhara laid claim to the mosque, resulting in inter-communal violence in the period 1853–55. In 1949, an idol of Rama was surreptitiously placed inside the mosque, and an attempt was made to convince devotees that it had appeared miraculously. An official investigation concluded that the mosque had been desecrated and the idol placed there by three men, together with a large band of supporters. This caused an uproar among Muslim <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>used</b> the mosque, and the gates to the mosque were locked on the orders of the state government. However, in the 1980s a movement began advocating demolishing the mosque and building a temple there dedicated to Rama. Following its poor performance in the 1984 parliamentary election, the Bharatiya Janata Party shifted toward a policy of more hardline Hindu nationalism. It lent its support to the agitation for a temple at Ayodhya. In 1986, the district magistrate of Ayodhya ordered that the gates be opened once more, and Hindus be allowed access to the shrine. On the strength of this agitation, the BJP won 86 Lok Sabha seats in 1989, a tally which made its support crucial to the National Front government.|$|E

The {{elemental}} powers of this world are determined by the state of four orbs, each governing one of the four classical elements: earth, fire, water, and wind. The world of Final Fantasy is inhabited by numerous races, including Humans, Elves, Dwarves, Mermaids, Dragons, and Robots. Most non-Human races have only one [...] "town" [...] in the game, although individuals are sometimes found in Human towns or other areas as well. Four hundred years {{prior to the start of}} the game, the Lefeinish <b>people,</b> <b>who</b> <b>used</b> the Power of Wind to craft airships and a giant space station (called the Floating Castle in the game), watched their country decline as the Wind Orb went dark. Two hundred years later, violent storms sank a massive shrine that served as the center of an ocean-based civilization, and the Water Orb went dark. The Earth Orb and the Fire Orb followed, plaguing the earth with raging wildfires, and devastating the agricultural town of Melmond as the plains and vegetation decayed. Some time later, the sage Lukahn tells of a prophecy that four Light Warriors will come to save the world in a time of darkness.|$|E
