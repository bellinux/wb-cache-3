5000|$|The Land Forces were [...] "basically a light {{infantry}} {{force in}} 1991, supported by specialized elements. Operational control {{extended from the}} headquarters of the general staff in Khartoum to the six regional commands (central, eastern, western, northern, southern, and Khartoum). Each regional command was organized along divisional lines. Thus, the Fifth Division was at Al-Ubayyid in Kurdufan (Central Command), the Second Division was at Khashm El Girba (Eastern Command), the Sixth Division was assigned to Al-Fashir in Darfur (Western Command), the First Division was at Juba (Southern Command), and the Seventh Armoured Division was at As Shajarah just south of Khartoum (Khartoum Command). The Airborne Division was based at Khartoum International Airport. The Third Division was located in the north, although no major troop units were assigned to it. Each division had a liaison officer attached to general headquarters in Khartoum to facilitate the division's communication with various command elements. This organisational structure did not provide an accurate picture of actual troop deployments. All of the divisions were understrength. The Sixth Division in Darfur was a reorganised brigade with only 2,500 <b>personnel.</b> <b>Unit</b> strengths varied widely. Most brigades were composed of 1,000 to 1,500 troops."

40|$|An {{interim review}} of {{management}} performance at ICARDA was {{requested by the}} CGIAR following its discussion of the Second External Management Review (EMR) of ICARDA at International Centers Week, October-November 1988. The 1988 EMR had been strongly critical {{of a number of}} facets of ICARDA's management and administration, and this interim review was intended to monitor ICARDA's progress in implementing the EMR recommendations. The document contains a transmittal by the CGIAR Executive Secretary and draft comments from the ICARDA Board. The principal document is a letter from John Dillon, who had chaired the 1988 EMR, and Pammi Sachdeva of the CGIAR Secretariat, containing the results of their review. The two reviewers reported substantial progress in implementation of the EMR recommendations, and sufficient improvement in management to warrant postponing further external monitoring until the next regular external review. Topics addressed included staffing of top management, organizational culture, legal status in Syria, Lebanon and Iran, research management, operations management, financial management, human resources, administration and information. An earlier recommendation for employment of an internationally recruited human resources professional to head the <b>personnel</b> <b>unit</b> was reiterated. This document was circulated prior to the CGIAR meeting of October-November 1991, but was not formally discussed...|$|E
