25|$|Meanwhile, a British inventor, William Fox Talbot, {{had succeeded}} in making crude but {{reasonably}} light-fast silver images on paper as early as 1834 but had kept his work secret. After reading about Daguerre's invention in January 1839, Talbot published his hitherto secret method and set about improving on it. At first, like other pre-daguerreotype processes, Talbot's paper-based photography typically required hours-long exposures in the camera, but in 1840 he created the calotype process, which used the chemical development of a latent image to greatly reduce the exposure needed and compete with the daguerreotype. In both its original and calotype forms, Talbot's process, unlike Daguerre's, created a translucent negative {{which could be used}} to print multiple positive copies; this is the basis of most modern chemical photography up to the present day, as Daguerreotypes could only be replicated by rephotographing them with a camera. Talbot's famous tiny <b>paper</b> <b>negative</b> of the Oriel window in Lacock Abbey, {{one of a number of}} camera photographs he made in the summer of 1835, may be the oldest camera negative in existence.|$|E

50|$|The {{process of}} the <b>paper</b> <b>negative</b> is still relevant, though, {{in the realm of}} alternative-process photography.

50|$|The {{collodion}} process {{produced a}} negative image on a transparent support (glass). This was {{an improvement over}} the calotype process, invented by William Henry Fox Talbot, which relied on <b>paper</b> <b>negatives,</b> and the daguerreotype, which produced a one-of-a-kind positive image {{and could not be}} replicated. The collodion process, thus combined desirable qualities of the calotype process (enabling the photographer to make a theoretically unlimited number of prints from a single negative) and the daguerreotype (creating a sharpness and clarity that could not be achieved with <b>paper</b> <b>negatives).</b> Collodion printing was typically done on albumen paper.|$|R

5000|$|When Talbot {{created this}} process it was {{intended}} to be a way to reproduce nature as accurately as possible (hence the name of his work, [...] "The Pencil of Nature").

50|$|Starting in 1850, Marville {{began to}} make photographs. He {{traveled}} throughout France, Italy and Germany, using the <b>paper</b> <b>negative</b> process with great skill to create beautiful landscapes and striking architectural photographs. Many of these works were included in albums produced by the pioneering publisher Louis Désiré Blanquart-Evrard. Around 1855, Marville undertook a series of delicate cloud studies, made from the rooftop of his Parisian studio using the collodion process. More rapid and sensitive than the <b>paper</b> <b>negative</b> process, the collodion negative enabled the photographer to capture delicate, luminous cloud formations on the city's horizon—-an achievement that was noted by several critics at the 1862 Universal Exhibition in London. At {{the same time that}} he was exploring new photographic technologies, Marville expanded his practice by homing in on two lucrative areas: reproductions of artworks (including a significant body of work by the French painter and draughtsman Jean-Dominique Ingres) and architectural photographs. He excelled at both and assumed the title and related privileges of photographer to the Louvre, while he also documented building and renovation projects in Paris and the provinces for prominent French architects, including Eugène Viollet-le-Duc and Felix Duban.|$|E

40|$|When {{photography}} appeared {{shortly before}} 1840, the metal-plate daguerreotype, invented in France, {{was first to}} achieve popularity. But the process simultaneously developed in England for capturing an image on a paper negative—from which many positives could be printed—provided the foundation on which photography would build for the next 150 years. This beautiful book presents more than 120 photographs printed from <b>paper</b> <b>negatives,</b> or calotypes, most never before published. The entire course of the <b>paper</b> <b>negative’s</b> “golden age” is described, from its laborious invention by William Henry Fox Talbot to competition with French photographers and commercial practitioners. Aesthetically ambitious, these richly textured calotypes were created by photographers both eminent and virtually unknown. Also included is an invaluable biographical dictionary of more than 500 British calotypists. The exhibition and its catalogue reveal a previously unrecognised artistic flourishing of the British Calotype among British photographers working on several continents in the 1840 s and 1850 s...|$|R
50|$|The {{collodion}} {{process had}} other advantages, especially {{in comparison with}} the daguerreotype. It was a relatively inexpensive process. The polishing equipment and fuming equipment needed for the daguerreotype could be dispensed with entirely. The support for the images was glass, which was far less expensive than silver-plated copper, and was more durable than <b>paper</b> <b>negatives.</b> It was also fast for the time, requiring only seconds for exposure.|$|R
50|$|The {{earliest}} {{forms of}} photogravure {{were developed by}} two original pioneers of photography itself, first Nicéphore Niépce in France in the 1820s, and later Henry Fox Talbot in England. Niépce was seeking a means to create photographic images on plates that could then be etched and used to make prints on paper with a traditional printing press. Niépce's early images {{were among the first}} photographs, pre-dating daguerreotypes and the later wet collodion photographic process. Talbot, inventor of the calotype <b>paper</b> <b>negative</b> process, wanted to make paper prints that would not fade. He worked on his photomechanical process in the 1850s and patented it in 1852 ('photographic engraving') and 1858 ('photoglyphic engraving').|$|E
5000|$|The <b>paper</b> <b>negative</b> process {{consists}} {{of using a}} negative printed on paper (either photographically or digitally) to create the final print of a photograph, as opposed to using a modern negative on a film base of cellulose acetate. The plastic acetate negative (which is what modern films produce) enables the printing of a very sharp image intended to be as close {{a representation of the}} actual subject as is possible. By using a negative based on paper instead, there is the possibility of creating a more ethereal image, simply by using a paper with a very visible grain, or by drawing on the paper or distressing it in some way.|$|E
50|$|Paper texture {{effects in}} calotype {{photography}} limit {{the ability of}} this early process to record low contrast details and textures. A calotype is a photographic negative produced on uncoated paper. (See <b>Paper</b> <b>negative.)</b> An important feature is that a relatively short exposure in a camera produces a latent image that is subsequently made visible by development. Then positive images for viewing are obtained by contact printing. This technique was in use principally from 1840 into the 1850s, when it was displaced by photography on glass. Skilled photographers were able to achieve dramatic results with the calotype process, {{and the reason for}} its eclipse may not be evident from viewing reproductions of early work.|$|E

50|$|Panchromatic {{black-and-white}} {{photographic printing}} papers {{are sensitive to}} all wavelengths of visible light.

Panchromatic papers {{can also be used}} to produce <b>paper</b> <b>negatives</b> in large-format cameras. These materials must be handled and developed in near-complete darkness.

He joined the Photographic Society, later the Royal Photographic Society, and was recorded as a member from 1854, although it is likely he joined in 1853 and remained a member until at least 1893, albeit with a break in membership between c.1871, rejoining in 1883.
