40|$|Optimal immune {{responses}} {{require both}} an antigen-specific and a co-stimulatory signal. The shared ligands B 7 - 1 and B 7 - 2 on antigen-presenting cells deliver the co-stimulatory signal through CD 28 and CTLA- 4 on T cells. Signalling through CD 28 augments the T-cell response, whereas CTLA- 4 signalling attenuates it. Numerous animal studies and recent clinical trials indicate that manipulating these interactions holds considerable promise for immunotherapy. With {{the consequences of}} these signals well established, and details of the downstream signalling events emerging, understanding the molecular nature of these extracellular interactions becomes crucial. Here we report the crystal structure of the human CTLA- 4 /B 7 - 1 co-stimulatory complex at 3. 0 A resolution. In contrast to other interacting cell-surface molecules, the relatively small CTLA- 4 /B 7 - 1 binding interface exhibits an unusually high degree of shape complementarity. CTLA- 4 forms homodimers through a newly defined interface of highly conserved residues. In the crystal lattice, CTLA- 4 and B 7 - 1 pack in a strikingly periodic arrangement in which bivalent CTLA- 4 homodimers bridge bivalent B 7 - 1 homodimers. This zipper-like oligomerization provides the structural basis for forming unusually stable signalling complexes at the T-cell surface, underscoring the importance of <b>potent</b> <b>inhibitory</b> <b>signalling</b> in human immune responses...|$|E
40|$|Cytotoxic T {{lymphocyte}} associated antigen- 4 (CTLA- 4) is a costimulatory receptor transducing a <b>potent</b> <b>inhibitory</b> <b>signal.</b> Increasing evidence {{showed that}} CTLA- 4 gene is an important susceptibility locus for autoimmune disorders. Alternatively spliced mRNA generates a soluble form, called sCTLA- 4. Whereas low levels of sCTLA- 4 are detected in normal human serum, increased/high serum levels are observed in several autoimmune diseases. The biological significance of increased sCTLA- 4 serum level is not fully clarified yet. It can be envisaged that sCTLA- 4 specifically inhibits the early T-cell activation by blocking the interaction of CD 80 /CD 86 with the costimulatory receptor CD 28. On the other hand, higher levels of sCTLA- 4 could contend the binding of the membrane form of CTLA- 4 with CD 80 /CD 86, in later activation phase, causing a reduction of <b>inhibitory</b> <b>signalling.</b> We showed that sCTLA- 4 from sera of patients with different autoimmune diseases is able to display functional activities on an in vitro system acting on the proliferation capability and modulating the secretion of cytokines. We observed a dual effect of sCTLA- 4 : inhibiting the secretion of IFN-γ, IL- 2, IL- 7, and IL- 13 and activating the secretion of TGF-β and IL- 10. This study underlines the role of sCTLA- 4 in modulating the immune response and its relevance in autoimmune disease pathogenesis...|$|R
40|$|Certain crosses {{of common}} bean (Phaseolus vulgaris) result in temperature-dependent hybrid {{weakness}} {{associated with a}} severe root phenotype. This {{is controlled by the}} interaction of the root- and shoot-expressed semidominant alleles dosage-dependent lethal 1 (DL 1) and DL 2, which communicate via long-distance signaling. Previously, apparent reciprocal effects on root growth and the restoration of normal root growth by exogenous sucrose led to the hypothesis that the dosage-dependent lethal (DL) system may control root–shoot carbon partitioning. Here, recombinant inbred lines were used to map the DL loci and physiological and biochemical analysis, including metabolite profiling, was used to gain new insights into the signaling interaction and the root phenotype. It is shown that the DL system does not control root–shoot carbon partitioning and that roots are unlikely to die from carbon starvation. Instead, root death likely occurs by defense-related programmed cell death, as indicated by salicylic acid accumulation. DL 2 -expressing cotyledons supply a <b>potent</b> <b>inhibitory</b> <b>signal</b> that is sufficient to cause such death in DL 1 -expressing roots. These data implicate the DL system in defense-related signaling and provide support for the recent hypothesis of defense-related autoimmunity as a potential isolating mechanism in plant speciation, in particular, setting a precedence for the potential roles of long-distance signaling and temperature dependence.

40|$|Notch {{functions}} as an oncogene or tumor inhibitor in various cancers, and decreases in Notch 2 expression {{are associated with}} increasing grade of human breast cancer. We constitutively activated Notch signaling with intracellular domain (ICD) expression in the human adenocarcinoma line MDA-MB- 231. Notch 2 signaling increased apoptosis, whereas Notch 4 ICD (int 3) significantly increased cell proliferation and growth. Cells with activated Notch 2 or Notch 4 were injected into nu/nu mice for analysis of in vivo tumor xenograft phenotype. Tumor growth was significantly altered depending on the receptor activated. Notch 2 ICD potently suppressed tumor take and growth, leading to a 60 % decrease in tumors and significantly smaller, necrotic tumors. Despite this, Notch 2 ICD tumors were highly vascularized, although the vessels were smaller and comprised a more immature network compared with Notch 4 ICD tumors. Notch 4 ICD tumors were highly aggressive and well vascularized, indicating a role for Notch 4 signaling in {{the promotion of the}} malignant phenotype in addition to its transforming ability. Although both NotchICD groups expressed angiogenic factors, Notch 4 ICD had selective vascular endothelial growth factor-D in both tumor and host stroma, suggesting a differential regulation of cytokines that may impact vascular recruitment and autocrine tumor signaling. Our results demonstrate that Notch 2 <b>signaling</b> is a <b>potent</b> <b>inhibitory</b> <b>signal</b> in human breast cancer xenografts...|$|R
40|$|CD 160 was {{recently}} {{identified as a}} T cell coinhibitory molecule that interacts with the herpesvirus entry mediator (HVEM) on antigen-presenting cells to deliver a <b>potent</b> <b>inhibitory</b> <b>signal</b> to CD 4 + T cells. HVEM also binds to the coinhibitory receptor BTLA (B- and T-lymphocyte attenuator) and the costimulatory receptor LIGHT (which is homologous to lymphotoxins, exhibits inducible expression, and competes with the herpes simplex virus glycoprotein D for HVEM, a receptor expressed by T lymphocytes, or TNFSF 14), thus regulating the CD 160 /BTLA/LIGHT/HVEM signaling pathway. To date, the detailed properties {{of the formation of}} these complexes, especially HVEM binding to the newly identified receptor CD 160, and the relationship of CD 160 with BTLA and LIGHT are still unclear. We performed N-terminal sequencing and a mass spectrometric analysis, which revealed that the extracellular domain of CD 160 exists primarily in the monomeric form. The surface plasmon resonance (SPR) analysis revealed that CD 160 binds directly to the cysteine-rich domain (CRD) 1 - 3 of HVEM with a similar affinity to, but slower dissociation rate than, that of BTLA. Notably, CD 160 competed with BTLA for binding to HVEM, in contrast, LIGHT did not affect HVEM binding to either CD 160 or BTLA. The results of a mutagenesis study of HVEM also suggest that the CD 160 binding region on HVEM was slightly different than, but overlapped with, the BTLA binding site. Interestingly, an anti-CD 160 antibody exhibiting antiangiogenic properties blocked CD 160 -HVEM binding. These results provide insight into the molecular architecture of the CD 160 /BTLA/LIGHT/HVEM signaling complex that regulates immune function...|$|R
40|$|Interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma), tumour {{necrosis}} factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) and Fas-ligand can mediate <b>potent</b> <b>inhibitory</b> <b>signals</b> in haemopoietic cells. Clinical {{and laboratory}} {{studies have suggested}} the involvement of these cytokines in the regulation of normal haemopoiesis and in the pathophysiology of bone marrow (BM) failure syndromes. As the effects of cytokines may also be regulated at the cellular receptor level, we studied the expression and modulation of TNF receptor (TNFR), IFN-gammaR and Fas-R on haemopoietic progenitor cells. In freshly isolated BM, using flow cytometry, TNFR 1 (p 55), TNFR 2 (p 75), IFN-gammaR, and Fas-R were detected on 5 - 12 % of mononuclear cells. Two-colour staining showed comparable receptor expression on a CD 34 + population, which includes haemopoietic progenitor and stem cells. Using reverse transcriptase-PCR (RT-PCR) transcription of mRNA coding for these receptors was demonstrated in fresh, highly purified CD 34 + cells. These findings indicate {{that the effects of}} these factors on progenitor cells may be directly mediated. In cultured BM cells, expression of TNFR 1 was not influenced by IFN-gamma, TNF-alpha or apoptosis-inducing anti-Fas monoclonal antibody (mAb). IFN-gamma decreased CD 34 + cell TNFR 2 expression. CD 34 + cell Fas-R expression was increased by IFN-gamma and TNF-alpha. IFN-gammaR expression was enhanced by anti-Fas mAb and to lesser degree with TNF-alpha. Similar results were obtained with RT-PCR analysis in cultured CD 34 + cells. Potentiation of anti-Fas mAb-mediated inhibition of haemopoietic colony formation by IFN-gamma and TNF-alpha was observed. Similarly, anti-Fas mAb enhanced the inhibitory effects of IFN-gamma. These results suggest that, in addition to interacting at the level of intracellular signalling pathways, IFN-gamma, TNF-alpha or Fas-ligand may potentiate or antagonize their effects through modulation of cytokine receptor expression...|$|R
40|$|PD- 1, a {{receptor}} {{expressed by}} T cells, B cells, and monocytes, {{is a potent}} regulator of immune responses and a promising therapeutic target. The structure and interactions of human PD- 1 are, however, incompletely characterized. We present the solution nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) -based structure of the human PD- 1 extracellular region and detailed analyses of its interactions with its ligands, PD-L 1 and PD-L 2. PD- 1 has typical immunoglobulin superfamily topology but differs {{at the edge of}} the GFCC' sheet, which is flexible and completely lacks a C" strand. Changes in PD- 1 backbone NMR signals induced by ligand binding suggest that, whereas binding is centered on the GFCC' sheet, PD- 1 is engaged by its two ligands differently and in ways incompletely explained by crystal structures of mouse PD- 1 · ligand complexes. The affinities of these interactions and that of PD-L 1 with the costimulatory protein B 7 - 1, measured using surface plasmon resonance, are significantly weaker than expected. The 3 - 4 -fold greater affinity of PD-L 2 versus PD-L 1 for human PD- 1 is principally due to the 3 -fold smaller dissociation rate for PD-L 2 binding. Isothermal titration calorimetry revealed that the PD- 1 /PD-L 1 interaction is entropically driven, whereas PD- 1 /PD-L 2 binding has a large enthalpic component. Mathematical simulations based on the biophysical data and quantitative expression data suggest an unexpectedly limited contribution of PD-L 2 to PD- 1 ligation during interactions of activated T cells with antigen-presenting cells. These findings provide a rigorous structural and biophysical framework for interpreting the important functions of PD- 1 and reveal that <b>potent</b> <b>inhibitory</b> <b>signaling</b> can be initiated by weakly interacting receptors...|$|R

Results We provide unequivocal evidence that PD- 1 is highly expressed (PD- 1 bright) on an NK cell subset detectable in the peripheral blood of approximately one fourth of healthy subjects.

40|$|The {{immune system}} has the {{difficult}} challenge of discerning and defending against {{a diversity of}} microbial pathogens, while simultaneously avoiding self-reactivity. T lymphocytes function as effectors and regulators of the immune system. While central tolerance mechanism results in deletion {{of the majority of}} self-reactive T lymphocytes during thymic selection, a fraction of self reactive lymphocytes escapes to the periphery and retains the potential to inflict destructive autoimmune pathology. The immune system evolved various mechanisms to restrain such auto-reactive T cells and maintain peripheral tolerance, including T cell anergy, deletion, and suppression by regulatory T cells (TRegs). These effects are regulated by a complex network of stimulatory and inhibitory receptors expressed on T cells and their ligands, which deliver cell-to-cell signals that dictate the outcome of T cell encountering with cognate antigens. Among the inhibitory immune mediators, the pathway consisting of the programmed cell death 1 (PD- 1) receptor (CD 279) and its ligands PD-L 1 (B 7 -H 1, CD 274) and PD-L 2 (B 7 -DC; CD 273) plays a vital role in the induction and maintenance of peripheral tolerance and for the maintenance of T cell homeostasis. In contrast to its beneficial role in self-tolerance, the PD- 1 : PD-L 1 /L 2 pathway mediates <b>potent</b> <b>inhibitory</b> <b>signals</b> that prevent the expansion and function of T effector cells and have detrimental effects on antiviral and antitumor immunity.

40|$|Although the {{presence}} of considerable levels of overweight, the main concern in elderly people is the reported decline in food intake {{and the loss of}} motivation to eat. This suggests {{the presence}} of problems associated with the regulation of energy balance and the control of food intake. A reduced energy intake causing body weight loss may be caused by social or physiological factors, or a combination of both. Poverty, loneliness and social isolation are the predominant social factors that contribute to decrease food intake in the elderly. Depression, often associated with loss or deterioration of social networks, is a common psychological problem in the elderly and a significant cause of loss of appetite. The reduction in food intake may be due to reduced drive to eat (hunger) resulting from a lower need state, or it arises because of more rapidly acting or more <b>potent</b> <b>inhibitory</b> (satiety) <b>signals.</b> The early satiation appears to be predominantly due to a decrease in adaptive relaxation of the fundus stomach resulting in early antral filling, while increased levels and effectiveness of cholecystokinin {{play a role in the}} anorexia of aging. The central feeding drive (both the opioid and the neuropetide Y effects) appear to decline with age. Physical factors such as poor dentition and ill-fitting dentures or age associated changes in taste and smell may influence food choice and limit the type and quantity of food eaten in older people. Common medical conditions in the elderly such as gastrointestinal disease, malabsorption syndromes, acute and chronic infections, hypermetabolism often cause anorexia, micronutrient deficiencies and increased energy and protein requirements. Furthermore, the elderly are major users of prescription medications, a number of which can cause malabsorption of nutrients, gastrointestinal symptoms and loss of appetite. There is now good evidence that, although age related reduction in energy intake is largely a physiologic effect of healthy aging, it may predispose to the harmful anorectic effects of psychological, social and physical problems that become increasingly frequent with aging. Poor nutritional status has been implicated in the development and progression of chronic diseases commonly affecting the elderly. Protein-energy malnutrition is associated with impaired muscle function, decreased bone mass, immune dysfunction, anaemia, reduced cognitive function, poor wound healing, delayed recovery from surgery and ultimately increased morbidity and mortality. An increasing understanding of the factors that contribute to poor nutrition in the elderly should enable the development of appropriate preventive and treatment strategies and improve the health of older people...|$|R

40|$|Treatment with IFN-β {{showed a}} <b>potent</b> <b>inhibitory</b> {{effect on the}} {{proliferation}} of pancreatic cancer cell lines. The expression, distribution, and localization of type I IFN receptor subtypes (IFNAR- 1 and IFNAR- 2 c) seem to predict the response to IFN treatment in these cells. However, further studies will need to confirm this observation in vivo...|$|R
40|$|AbstractTwo {{signaling}} molecules {{have been}} implicated in the modulation of immune receptor activation by inhibitory coreceptors: an inositol polyphosphate 5 ′-phosphatase, SHIP, and a tyrosine phosphatase, SHP- 1. To address the necessity, interaction, or redundancy of these signaling molecules, we have generated SHP- 1 - or SHIP-deficient B cell lines and determined their ability to mediate <b>inhibitory</b> <b>signaling.</b> Two distinct classes of inhibitory responses are defined, mediated by the selective recruitment of SHP- 1 or SHIP. The FcγRIIB class of <b>inhibitory</b> <b>signaling</b> is dependent on SHIP and not SHP- 1; conversely, the KIR class requires SHP- 1 and not SHIP. The consequence of this selective recruitment by inhibitory receptor engagement is seen in BCR-triggered apoptosis. SHP- 1 -mediated <b>inhibitory</b> <b>signaling</b> blocks apoptosis, while SHIP recruitment attenuates a proapoptotic signal initiated by FcγRIIB...|$|R
