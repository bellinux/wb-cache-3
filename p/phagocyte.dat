5|$|Immunodeficiencies {{occur when}} {{one or more}} of the {{components}} of the immune system are inactive. The ability of the immune system to respond to pathogens is diminished in both the young and the elderly, with immune responses beginning to decline at around 50 years of age due to immunosenescence. In developed countries, obesity, alcoholism, and drug use are common causes of poor immune function. However, malnutrition is the most common cause of immunodeficiency in developing countries. Diets lacking sufficient protein are associated with impaired cell-mediated immunity, complement activity, <b>phagocyte</b> function, IgA antibody concentrations, and cytokine production. Additionally, the loss of the thymus at an early age through genetic mutation or surgical removal results in severe immunodeficiency and a high susceptibility to infection.|$|E
5|$|Neutrophils and macrophages are phagocytes {{that travel}} {{throughout}} the body in pursuit of invading pathogens. Neutrophils are normally found in the bloodstream and are the most abundant type of <b>phagocyte,</b> normally representing 50% to 60% of the total circulating leukocytes. During the acute phase of inflammation, particularly {{as a result of}} bacterial infection, neutrophils migrate toward the site of inflammation in a process called chemotaxis, and are usually the first cells to arrive at the scene of infection. Macrophages are versatile cells that reside within tissues and: (i) produce a wide array of chemicals including enzymes, complement proteins, and cytokines, while they can also (ii) act as scavengers that rid the body of worn-out cells and other debris, and as antigen-presenting cells that activate the adaptive immune system.|$|E

As {{in the case of}} ascites <b>phagocytes</b> are decidedly numerous in the pleural fluid of the mouse and rabbit. 2. The morphology of the <b>phagocytes</b> found in the pleural fluid is almost identical with that of pagocvtes in the ascites. 3. The motility, transformation, and the course of degeneration of <b>phagocytes</b> in the pleural fluid more or less coincide with those of <b>phagocytes</b> in the ascites. 4. From these findings it seems rational to assume that the <b>phagocytes</b> in the pleural fluid are the same kind of cells as <b>phagocytes</b> in the ascites, and consequently, belong to the same cell series as monocytes. 5. <b>Phagocytes</b> in the pleural fluid, as well as those in the ascites, change their own shapes to fibroblast-like or histiocyte-like figures in the medium of tissue culture, but essentially they do not lose their original character as <b>phagocytes.</b> However, this transformation is dependent upon various condition of the culture...|$|R

However, <b>phagocytes</b> in pleural fluid tend to show a more marked neutral-red rosette formation than the <b>phagocytes</b> in ascites, while on the contrary the degree of neutralred stain, the time retaining the stain and also the time retaining Janus-green stain are inferior to those of the <b>phagocytes</b> in ascites; and this phenomenon seems to be due to the immaturity of the <b>phagocytes</b> in the pleural fluid...|$|R
5|$|Phagocytosis is an {{important}} feature of cellular innate immunity performed by cells called 'phagocytes' that engulf, or eat, pathogens or particles. Phagocytes generally patrol the body searching for pathogens, but can be called to specific locations by cytokines. Once a pathogen has been engulfed by a <b>phagocyte,</b> it becomes trapped in an intracellular vesicle called a phagosome, which subsequently fuses with another vesicle called a lysosome to form a phagolysosome. The pathogen is killed by the activity of digestive enzymes or following a respiratory burst that releases free radicals into the phagolysosome. Phagocytosis evolved {{as a means of}} acquiring nutrients, but this role was extended in phagocytes to include engulfment of pathogens as a defense mechanism. Phagocytosis probably represents the oldest form of host defense, as phagocytes have been identified in both vertebrate and invertebrate animals.|$|E

25|$|Concerning {{immunological}} adaptation, it {{was discovered}} that wild common ostriches have a pronounced non specific immunity defense, with blood content reflecting high values of lysosome, and <b>phagocyte</b> cells in medium. This is in contrast to domesticated ostriches, who in captivity develop high concentration of immunoglobulin antibodies in their circulation, indicating an acquired immunological response. It is suggested that this immunological adaptability may allow this species to have a high success rate of survival in variable environmental settings.|$|E
5000|$|There {{are several}} ways {{bacteria}} avoid contact with <b>phagocytes.</b> First, they can grow in sites that <b>phagocytes</b> are not capable of traveling to (e.g., the surface of unbroken skin).

Third, some species of bacteria can inhibit the ability of <b>phagocytes</b> {{to travel to the}} site of infection by interfering with chemotaxis. Fourth, some bacteria can avoid contact with <b>phagocytes</b> by tricking the immune system into [...] "thinking" [...] that the bacteria are [...] "self". Treponema pallidum—the bacterium that causes syphilis—hides from <b>phagocytes</b> by coating its surface with fibronectin, which is produced naturally by the body and plays a crucial role in wound healing.|$|R

500|$|<b>Phagocytes</b> are {{cells that}} protect the body by ingesting harmful foreign particles, bacteria, and dead or dying cells. Their {{name comes from}} the Greek phagein, [...] "to eat" [...] or [...] "devour", and [...] "-cyte", the suffix in biology {{denoting}} [...] "cell", from the Greek kutos, [...] "hollow vessel". They are essential for fighting infections and for subsequent immunity. <b>Phagocytes</b> are important throughout the animal kingdom and are highly developed within vertebrates. One litre of human blood contains about six billion <b>phagocytes.</b> They were discovered in 1882 by Ilya Ilyich Mechnikov while he was studying starfish larvae. Mechnikov was awarded the 1908 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for his discovery. <b>Phagocytes</b> occur in many species; some amoebae behave like macrophage <b>phagocytes,</b> which suggests that <b>phagocytes</b> appeared early {{in the evolution of}} life.|$|R
25|$|The spleen plays {{important}} roles in regard to red blood cells (also referred to as erythrocytes) and the immune system. It removes old red blood cells and holds a reserve of blood, which can be valuable in case of hemorrhagic shock, and also recycles iron. As {{a part of the}} mononuclear <b>phagocyte</b> system, it metabolizes hemoglobin removed from senescent red blood cells (erythrocytes). The globin portion of hemoglobin is degraded to its constitutive amino acids, and the heme portion is metabolized to bilirubin, which is removed in the liver.|$|E
25|$|It is {{believed}} that filamentation is induced as a response of DNA damage (by the mechanisms previously exposed), participating SulA mechanism and additional factors. Furthermore, {{the length of the}} filamentous bacteria could have a stronger attachment to the epithelial cells, with an increased number of adhesins participating in the interaction, making even harder the work for (PMN). The interaction between <b>phagocyte</b> cells and adopting filamentous-shape bacteria provide an advantage to their survival. In this relate, filamentation could be not only a virulence, but also a resistance factor in these bacteria.|$|E
25|$|The spleen synthesizes {{antibodies}} in {{its white}} pulp and removes antibody-coated bacteria and antibody-coated blood cells {{by way of}} blood and lymph node circulation. A study published in 2009 using mice found that the spleen contains, in its reserve, half of the body's monocytes within the red pulp. These monocytes, upon moving to injured tissue (such as the heart), turn into dendritic cells and macrophages while promoting tissue healing. The spleen is a center of activity of the mononuclear <b>phagocyte</b> system and can be considered analogous to a large lymph node, as its absence causes a predisposition to certain infections.|$|E
500|$|<b>Phagocytes</b> {{of humans}} and other animals are called [...] "professional" [...] or [...] "non-professional" [...] {{depending}} on how effective they are at phagocytosis. The professional <b>phagocytes</b> include many types of white blood cells (such as neutrophils, monocytes, macrophages, mast cells, and dendritic cells). The main difference between professional and non-professional <b>phagocytes</b> is that the professional <b>phagocytes</b> have molecules called receptors on their surfaces that can detect harmful objects, such as bacteria, that are not normally found in the body. <b>Phagocytes</b> are crucial in fighting infections, {{as well as in}} maintaining healthy tissues by removing dead and dying cells that have reached the end of their lifespan.|$|R
40|$|To {{test whether}} {{lysosomal}} degranulation of <b>phagocytes</b> {{is associated with}} antibody-dependent cytotoxicity, eggs of Arbacia punctulata were used as targets for blood <b>phagocytes</b> of Mustelus canis. Eggs were coated with heat-aggregated dogfish IgM and exposed to <b>phagocytes,</b> and cytolysis of eggs was observed by Nomarski optics. <b>Phagocytes</b> adhered, degranulated, and raised fertilization membranes resembling those induced by sperm or ionophore A 23187. Lysis was then observed as damage radiating {{from the point of}} phagocyte-egg contact. By 4 hr, coated eggs exposed to <b>phagocytes</b> released 8. 9, 12. 3, and 7. 4 % of total catalase (EC 1. 11. 1. 6), β-glucuronidase (EC 3. 2. 1. 31), and superoxide dismutase (EC 1. 15. 1. 1) into the medium. Cytotoxic enzyme release significantly exceeded that from uncoated eggs incubated with <b>phagocytes</b> or eggs alone (uncoated or coated). Because activated eggs release a neutral protease, it was considered possible that this enzyme might be responsible for autolysis of eggs. This possibility was excluded because (i) lysis of eggs was not inhibited by soybean trypsin inhibitor (SBTI) whereas the egg protease was sensitive to SBTI, and (ii) the major trypsin-like activity of <b>phagocytes</b> was not inhibited by SBTI. These experiments demonstrate that Ig-coated cells are first activated, and then killed, when exposed to degranulating <b>phagocytes</b> and suggest that enzymes from attacking <b>phagocytes,</b> and not target cells, are responsible for cell death...|$|R

25|$|Once {{inside the}} human host, promastigotes invade macrophages. Inside the cells they {{transform}} {{back into the}} smaller amastigote form. The amastigotes replicate in the most hostile part of the macrophage cell, inside the phagolysosome, whose normal defensive response {{they are able to}} prevent. After repeated multiplication, they break down their host cell by sheer pressure of mass, but there is some recent speculation that they are able to leave the cell by triggering the exocytosis response of the macrophage. The daughter cells protozoans then migrate to fresh cells or through the bloodstream to find new hosts. In this way the infection is progressive, spreading to the host's mononuclear <b>phagocyte</b> system, particularly the spleen and liver. The free amastigotes in peripheral tissues are then ingested by sandfly to enter another cycle.|$|E

It infects the mononuclear <b>phagocyte</b> system including spleen, liver and bone marrow. Infection is transmitted by species of sandfly belonging to the genus Phlebotomus in Old World and Lutzomyia in New World. Therefore, the parasite is prevalent throughout tropical and temperate regions including Africa (mostly in Sudan), China, India, Nepal, southern Europe, Russia and South America.

25|$|The aging {{red blood}} cell {{undergoes}} changes in its plasma membrane, making it susceptible to selective recognition by macrophages and subsequent phagocytosis in the mononuclear <b>phagocyte</b> system (spleen, liver and lymph nodes), thus removing old and defective cells and continually purging the blood. This process is termed eryptosis, {{red blood cell}} programmed cell death. This process normally occurs {{at the same rate}} of production by erythropoiesis, balancing the total circulating red blood cell count. Eryptosis is increased {{in a wide variety of}} diseases including sepsis, haemolytic uremic syndrome, malaria, sickle cell anemia, beta-thalassemia, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency, phosphate depletion, iron deficiency and Wilson's disease. Eryptosis can be elicited by osmotic shock, oxidative stress, energy depletion as well as a wide variety of endogenous mediators and xenobiotics. Excessive eryptosis is observed in red blood cells lacking the cGMP-dependent protein kinase type I or the AMP-activated protein kinase AMPK. Inhibitors of eryptosis include erythropoietin, nitric oxide, catecholamines and high concentrations of urea.|$|E
500|$|Phagocytosis is {{the process}} of taking in {{particles}} such as bacteria, parasites, dead host cells, and cellular and foreign debris by a cell. It involves a chain of molecular processes. Phagocytosis occurs after the foreign body, a bacterial cell, for example, has bound to molecules called [...] "receptors" [...] that are {{on the surface of the}} <b>phagocyte.</b> The <b>phagocyte</b> then stretches itself around the bacterium and engulfs it. Phagocytosis of bacteria by human neutrophils takes on average nine minutes. Once inside this <b>phagocyte,</b> the bacterium is trapped in a compartment called a phagosome. Within one minute the phagosome merges with either a lysosome or a granule to form a phagolysosome. The bacterium is then subjected to an overwhelming array of killing mechanisms and is dead a few minutes later. Dendritic cells and macrophages are not so fast, and phagocytosis can take many hours in these cells. Macrophages are slow and untidy eaters; they engulf huge quantities of material and frequently release some undigested back into the tissues. This debris serves as a signal to recruit more phagocytes from the blood. Phagocytes have voracious appetites; scientists have even fed macrophages with iron filings and then used a small magnet to separate them from other cells.|$|E
500|$|A <b>phagocyte</b> {{has many}} types of receptors on its surface {{that are used to}} bind material. They include [...] opsonin receptors, {{scavenger}} receptors, and Toll-like receptors. Opsonin receptors increase the phagocytosis of bacteria that have been coated with immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies or with complement. [...] "Complement" [...] is the name given to a complex series of protein molecules found in the blood that destroy cells or mark them for destruction. Scavenger receptors bind to a large range of molecules on the surface of bacterial cells, and Toll-like receptors—so called because of their similarity to well-studied receptors in fruit flies that are encoded by the Toll gene—bind to more specific molecules. Binding to Toll-like receptors increases phagocytosis and causes the <b>phagocyte</b> to release a group of hormones that cause inflammation.|$|E

500|$|Bacteria have {{developed}} ways to survive inside phagocytes, where {{they continue to}} evade the immune system. To get safely inside the <b>phagocyte</b> they [...] express proteins called invasins. When inside the cell they remain in the cytoplasm and avoid toxic chemicals contained in the phagolysosomes. Some bacteria prevent the fusion of a phagosome and lysosome, to form the phagolysosome. Other pathogens, such as Leishmania, create a highly modified vacuole inside the <b>phagocyte,</b> which helps them persist and replicate. Some bacteria are capable of living inside of the phagolysosome. Staphylococcus aureus, for example, produces the enzymes catalase and superoxide dismutase, which break down chemicals—such as hydrogen peroxide—produced by phagocytes to kill bacteria. Bacteria may escape from the phagosome before {{the formation of the}} phagolysosome: Listeria monocytogenes can make a hole in the phagosome wall using enzymes called listeriolysin O and phospholipase C.|$|E
500|$|During an infection, {{chemical}} signals attract phagocytes {{to places}} where the pathogen has invaded the body. These chemicals may come from bacteria or from other phagocytes already present. The phagocytes move by a method called chemotaxis. When phagocytes {{come into contact with}} bacteria, the receptors on the phagocyte's surface will bind to them. [...] This binding will lead to the engulfing of the bacteria by the <b>phagocyte.</b> Some phagocytes kill the ingested pathogen with oxidants and nitric oxide. After phagocytosis, macrophages and dendritic cells can also participate in antigen presentation, a process in which a <b>phagocyte</b> moves parts of the ingested material back to its surface. This material is then displayed to other cells of the immune system. Some phagocytes then travel to the body's lymph nodes and display the material to white blood cells called lymphocytes. This process is important in building immunity, and many pathogens have evolved methods to evade attacks by phagocytes.|$|E

Ex vivo models of opsonin-dependent phagocytosis by pronephros <b>phagocytes</b> demonstrated increased phagocytosis efficacy. Analysis of <b>phagocytes</b> collected from diseased fish demonstrated that ∼ 70 % of the bacteria contained in the blood during the septic phase of the disease were located within <b>phagocytes,</b> suggesting an in vivo intracellular lifestyle.

The present study investigated the mechanisms of action of melatonin and its effects on the functional activity of colostral <b>phagocytes</b> in diabetic women. Colostrum samples were collected from normoglycemic (N = 38) and diabetic (N = 38) women. We determined melatonin concentration, superoxide release, bactericidal activity and intracellular Ca 2 + release by colostral <b>phagocytes</b> treated or not with 8 -(Diethylamino) octyl- 3, 4, 5 -trimethoxybenzoate hydrochloride (TMB- 8) and incubated with melatonin and its precursor (N-acetyl-serotonin-NAS), antagonist (luzindole) and agonist (chloromelatonin-CMLT). Melatonin concentration was higher in colostrum samples from hyperglycemic than normoglycemic mothers. Melatonin stimulated superoxide release by colostral <b>phagocytes</b> from normoglycemic but not hyperglycemic women. NAS increased superoxide, irrespective of glycemic status, whereas CMTL increased superoxide only in cells from the normoglycemic group. Phagocytic activity in colostrum increased significantly in the presence of melatonin, NAS and CMLT, irrespective of glycemic status. The bactericidal activity of colostral <b>phagocytes</b> against enterophatogenic Escherichia coli (EPEC) increased in the presence of melatonin or NAS in the normoglycemic group, but not in the hyperglycemic group. Luzindole blocked melatonin action on colostrum <b>phagocytes.</b> <b>Phagocytes</b> from the normoglycemic group treated with melatonin exhibited an increase in intracellular Ca 2 + release. <b>Phagocytes</b> treated with TMB- 8 (intracellular Ca 2 + inhibitor) decreased superoxide, bactericidal activity and intracellular Ca 2 + release in both groups. The results obtained suggest an interactive effect of glucose metabolism and melatonin on colostral <b>phagocytes.</b> In colostral <b>phagocytes</b> from normoglycemic mothers, melatonin likely increases the ability of colostrum to protect against EPEC and other infections. In diabetic mothers, because maternal hyperglycemia modifies the functional activity of colostrum <b>phagocytes,</b> melatonin effects are likely limited to anti-inflammatory processes, with low superoxide release and bactericidal activity. © 2013 Morceli et al...|$|R

Therefore, the number and profile of bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) and blood <b>phagocytes</b> and their in vitro spontaneous and serum-treated-zymosan (STZ) -stimulated O 2 - production were assessed after allogeneic (BN to LEW) and syngeneic (LEW to LEW) transplantation of the left lung in rats.
