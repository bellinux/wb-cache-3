5|$|Parliament is {{not bound}} by the common law, {{and as a result}} several acts of {{parliament}} unwittingly create valid exceptions to the doctrine of <b>privity.</b> Under the Road Traffic Act 1988, motorists are obliged to take out third party liability insurance. This means that victims of car accidents can claim money from the insurer of the driver at fault, even though they {{are not part of the}} original contract. Under the Married Women's Property Act 1882 a husband can take out insurance in his own name, but make it enforceable by his wife and children despite the doctrine of <b>privity.</b>|$|E
5|$|In Beswick v Beswick {{an uncle}} gifted his nephew a business, on the {{condition}} that the nephew would pay the uncle (Mr Beswick) a certain amount per week, and in the event of the uncle's death, give a similar amount to his widow (Mrs Beswick). When the uncle died the nephew refused to pay the widow the money required, arguing that as she was not party to the original agreement she could not benefit from it. The Court of Appeal under Lord Denning tried to use {{this as an opportunity to}} claim that the doctrine of <b>privity</b> was invalid, something the House of Lords rejected. However, the Lords did agree that Mrs Beswick could sue, not as a third party to the contract but as the executrix of her husband's estate. As executrix she would be acting as a representative of Mr Beswick, and the doctrine of <b>privity</b> would not apply.|$|E
5|$|The second rule of <b>privity,</b> that a {{third party}} cannot claim {{benefits}} from a contract, was widely criticised by academics, members of the judiciary and legal professionals. One {{problem was that the}} rule made no exceptions for cases where it was obviously intended for the third party to claim a benefit, such as in Beswick v Beswick, where an uncle gave his nephew a business, on the condition that the nephew would pay the uncle a certain amount per week, and in the event of the uncle's death, give a similar amount to his widow.|$|E
5|$|Supporters of the {{original}} doctrine of <b>privity</b> {{say that it is}} reasonable not to allow third parties to enforce contracts, arguing that to allow them to do so would hamper the rights of {{the original}} parties in relation to amending or terminating contracts. Another argument put forward is that the doctrine was deliberately retained by judges to protect consumers from exclusion clauses designed to protect third party manufacturers from liability. The general view of academics, however, is that no legal argument has yet been advanced as to why the original doctrine should be good law. Patrick Atiyah argues that the doctrine came from a time of rising trade through middlemen, and was designed to simplify commercial transactions and encourage enterprise liability.|$|E

25|$|The Law Reform Commission {{considers}} {{and reports}} on {{such topics as}} may be referred to it by the Secretary for Justice or the Chief Justice of the Court of Final Appeal of the HKSAR. Its membership includes academics, practising lawyers and prominent community members. The Commission has published reports covering subjects as diverse as commercial arbitration, data protection, divorce, sale of goods and supply of services, insolvency, fraud and statutory interpretation. The recommendations in many of its reports have been implemented, either {{in whole or in}} part. It is currently considering references on privacy, guardianship and custody, domicile, <b>privity</b> of contract, advance directives, hearsay in criminal proceedings and conditional fees.|$|E
25|$|The {{common law}} of <b>privity</b> of {{contract}} is a sub-rule of consideration because it restricts who can enforce {{an agreement to}} those who have brought consideration to the bargain. In an early case, Tweddle v Atkinson, it was held that because a son had not given any consideration for his father in law's promise to his father to pay the son £200, he could not enforce the promise. Given the principle that standing to enforce an obligation should reflect whoever has a legitimate interest in its performance, a 1996 report by the Law Commission entitled <b>Privity</b> of Contract: Contracts for the Benefit of Third Parties, recommended that while courts should be left free to develop the common law, some of the more glaring injustices should be removed. This led to the Contracts (Rights of Third Parties) Act 1999. Under section 1, a third party may enforce an agreement if it purports to confer a benefit on the third party, either individually or a member as a class, and there is no expressed stipulation that the person was not intended to be able to enforce it. In this respect there is a strong burden on the party claiming enforcement was not intended by a third party. A third party has the same remedies available as a person privy to an agreement, and can enforce both positive benefits, or limits on liability, such as an exclusion clause. The rights of a third party can then only be terminated or withdrawn without her consent if it is reasonably foreseeable that she would rely upon them.|$|E
25|$|Given {{that the}} 1999 Act {{preserves}} the promisee's right {{to enforce the}} contract as it stood at common law, an outstanding issue is to what extent a promisee can claim damages for a benefit {{on behalf of a}} third party, if he has suffered no personal loss. In Jackson v Horizon Holidays Ltd, Lord Denning MR held that a father could claim damages for disappointment (beyond the financial cost) of a terrible holiday experience on behalf of his family. However, a majority of the House of Lords in Woodar Investment Development Ltd v Wimpey Construction UK Ltd disapproved any broad ability of a party to a contract to claim damages on behalf of a third party, except perhaps in a limited set of consumer contracts. There is disagreement about whether this will remain the case. Difficulties also remain in cases involving houses built with defects, which are sold to a buyer, who subsequently sells to a third party. It appears that neither the initial buyer can claim on behalf of the third party, and nor will the third party be able to claim under the 1999 Act, as they will typically not be identified by the original contract (or known) in advance. Apart from this instance relating to tort, in practice the doctrine of <b>privity</b> is entirely ignored in numerous situations, throughout the law of trusts and agency.|$|E
500|$|A general {{consensus}} is that <b>privity</b> is distinct from consideration. As well as Haldane's judgment in Dunlop, the courts have stated a similar principle in other cases such as Scruttons Ltd v Midland Silicones Ltd [...] AC 446 and Beswick v Beswick - that <b>privity</b> is separate from consideration. Supporters of this view concede that while <b>privity</b> and consideration are distinct doctrines, {{there is a strong}} relationship between the two. This causes problems with the idea that the doctrine of <b>privity</b> should be abolished, as the idea that third parties can claim benefits from promises that they gave nothing for clashes with the doctrine of consideration, which prevents parties who did not contribute something to the agreement from benefiting from it.|$|E
500|$|A second {{argument}} used {{to undermine}} the doctrine of <b>privity</b> is {{the large number of}} exceptions to the rule created by Acts of Parliament, which seemed to indicate that Parliament itself had an issue with the doctrine. Critics also argued that with the large number of inconsistencies and exceptions with the doctrine of <b>privity,</b> it was [...] "bad" [...] law, as it provided no reliable rule; the way that the law works in theory is hugely different from the way it was enforced by the courts. The doctrine is also not found in many other legal systems, such as that of the United States.|$|E
500|$|The {{doctrine}} of <b>privity</b> was significantly reformed by the Contracts (Rights of Third Parties) Act 1999, which received the Royal Assent on 11 November 1999 and [...] "thereby [...] {{one of the}} most universally disliked and criticised blots on the legal landscape". The first proposal to reform the {{doctrine of}} <b>privity</b> was made in 1937 by the Law Revision Committee in its Sixth Interim Report, which proposed an act of Parliament to allow third parties to enforce terms of a contract that specifically allowed them to do so. The report was not acted on - as late as 1986 the assumption was that Parliament would not act, and any reform would come from judicial sources (particularly the House of Lords).|$|E
500|$|Trusts {{have been}} used as a way around the {{original}} doctrine of <b>privity.</b> A trust is an arrangement where the owner of property gives it to a second party (a trustee) to manage on behalf of a third party (a beneficiary). In this situation the House of Lords decided (in Les Affréteurs v Walford [...] AC 801) that the trustee's ability to sue the owner of the property is to be exercised on behalf of the beneficiary, a third party. This is known as a [...] "trust of the promise", and, while artificial, it bypassed the doctrine of <b>privity.</b> The trust exception has been heavily undermined by the decision in Re Schebsman [...] Ch 83, which requires a court to find evidence of an intent to create a trust of the promise rather than simply using the requirement as an intention as a fiction to allow the courts to enact the trust exception.|$|E
500|$|It {{has been}} argued, however, that <b>privity</b> {{is not even}} a {{distinct}} doctrine, but rather simply part of consideration. Consideration is a rule that there must be a [...] "benefit or detriment" [...] involved in any contract, and that this must initially come from the promisee. It is argued that this rule and the doctrine of <b>privity</b> are two ways of saying the same thing - that to say someone is not a party to the contract is the same as saying that they gave no consideration in the initial agreement. This attitude is found in decisions by the Judiciary of England and Wales - in, Tweddle v Atkinson, Crompton and Blackburn JJ made the decision that they did because the claimant had not provided consideration, and the majority in Dunlop Pneumatic Tyre Co Ltd v Selfridge & Co Ltd based their judgment on a similar point. It is worth noting, however, that [...] Lord Haldane maintained in his judgement in Dunlop that, independent of consideration, it was a rule in English law that [...] "only a person who is party to a contract can sue on it".|$|E
500|$|A {{collateral}} {{contract is}} a contract where the consideration is the entry into another subordinate contract, which co-exists {{side by side}} with the main contract. Because this normally involves parties who are not part of the main contract, it has been used as a way around the doctrine of <b>privity.</b> The habit of the courts finding collateral contracts to allow an injured third party to sue has been criticised, however, as [...] "exceedingly artificial", and in light of the Contracts (Rights of Third Parties) Act 1999 the use of this has been predicted to decrease.|$|E
500|$|It can {{be argued}} {{that this is not a}} true {{exception}} to the doctrine because once the contract is made the [...] "agent" [...] plays no further part, leaving it as an agreement between two parties. Certain elements of the doctrine of agency have been said to clash with <b>privity,</b> however. In some circumstances the principal can sue the third party even when the agent has not disclosed to the third party that he is acting as an agent to the principal. In this situation, the third party can be sued by somebody that he had no idea was involved in the contract.|$|E
500|$|A second {{exception}} {{was created in}} Jackson v Horizon Holidays Ltd [...] 1 WLR 1468. Jackson had booked a family holiday in his own name from Horizon Holidays. The holiday did not match the specifications given in the contract, and Jackson sued Horizon Holidays. The company accepted liability, but claimed {{that they should not}} have to pay damages to the family as the doctrine of <b>privity</b> meant they were not allowed to sue on the contract. The Court of Appeal said that the loss of enjoyment suffered by the family was a loss to Jackson himself. He had paid for a family holiday but not received it, and so damages were awarded.|$|E
500|$|<b>Privity</b> is a {{doctrine}} in English contract law {{that covers the}} relationship between parties to a contract and other parties or agents. At its most basic level, the rule is that a contract can neither give rights to, nor impose obligations on, anyone {{who is not a}} party to the original agreement, i.e. a [...] "third party". Historically, third parties could enforce the terms of a contract, as evidenced in Provender v Wood, but the law changed in a series of cases in the 19th and early 20th centuries, the most well known of which are Tweddle v Atkinson in 1861 and Dunlop Pneumatic Tyre v Selfridge and Co Ltd in 1915.|$|E
500|$|The {{original}} {{doctrine of}} <b>privity</b> {{consisted of two}} rules - first, that a third party may not have obligations imposed {{by the terms of}} a contract, and second, that a third party may not benefit from the terms of a contract. The first rule is not something that is contested, while the second was described as [...] "one of the most universally disliked and criticised blots on the legal landscape". The second rule was not originally held to be valid, and in the 17th Century third parties were allowed to enforce terms of a contract that benefited them, as shown in Provender v Wood [...] Hetley 30, where the judgement stated that [...] "the party to whom the benefit of a promise accrews, may bring his action." [...] The first reversal of this was in Bourne v Mason [...] 1 Vent., where the Court of King's Bench found that a third party had no rights to enforce a contract that benefited him. This case was quickly reversed, and decisions immediately after Bourne v Mason took the view that third parties could enforce contracts that benefited them.|$|E

2500|$|Depending on the jurisdiction, one {{squatter}} {{may or may}} {{not pass}} along continuous possession to another squatter, known as [...] "tacking". Tacking is defined as [...] "The joining of consecutive periods of possession by different persons to treat the periods as one continuous period; esp., the adding of one's own period of land possession to that of a prior possessor to establish continuous adverse possession for the statutory period." [...] There are three types of Privity: <b>Privity</b> of Contract; <b>Privity</b> of Possession; and <b>Privity</b> of Estate. [...] One of the three types of <b>privity</b> is required in order for one adverse possessor to [...] "tack" [...] their time onto another adverse possessor in order to complete the statutory time period. One way tacking occurs is when the conveyance of the property from one adverse possessor to another is founded upon a written document (usually an erroneous deed), indicating [...] "color of title." [...] A lawful owner may also restart the clock at zero by giving temporary permission for the occupation of the property, thus defeating the necessary [...] "continuous and hostile" [...] element. Evidence that a squatter paid rent to the owner would defeat adverse possession for that period.|$|E
2500|$|For example, in the {{business}} realm, the auditor has a duty of care to the company they are auditing - that the documents created are a true and reliable representation of the company's financial position. However, as per Esanda Finance Corporation Ltd v. Peat Marwick Hungerfords, such auditors do NOT provide a duty of care to third parties who rely on their reports. An exception is where the auditor provides [...] the third party with a <b>privity</b> letter, explicitly stating the third party can rely on the report for a specific purpose. In such cases, the <b>privity</b> letter establishes a duty of care.|$|E
2500|$|British Virgin Islands {{contract}} law {{is almost entirely}} based upon English common law. [...] The British Virgin Islands has no equivalent of the Contracts (Rights of Third Parties) Act 1999, and applies strict <b>privity</b> of contract. [...] Similarly there is no equivalent to the Unfair Contract Terms Act 1977 in the territory.|$|E
2500|$|The {{common law}} {{doctrine}} of <b>privity</b> of contract provides that {{only those who}} are {{party to a contract}} may sue or be sued on it. The leading case of Tweddle v Atkinson [...] immediately showed that the doctrine had the effect of defying the intent of the parties. In maritime law, the cases of Scruttons v Midland Silicones [...] and N.Z. Shipping v Satterthwaite	 [...] established how third parties could gain the protection of limitation clauses within a bill of lading.|$|E
2500|$|Business torts (i.e., {{economic}} torts) typically involve commercial transactions, {{and include}} tortious interference with trade or contract, fraud, injurious falsehood, and negligent misrepresentation. Negligent misrepresentation torts are distinct from contractual cases involving misrepresentation {{in that there}} is no <b>privity</b> of contract; these torts are likely to involve pure economic loss which has been less-commonly recoverable in tort. One criterion for determining whether economic loss is recoverable is the [...] "foreseeability" [...] doctrine. The economic loss rule is highly confusing and inconsistently applied. In 2010, {{the supreme court of the}} U.S. state of Washington replaced the economic loss doctrine with an [...] "independent duty doctrine".|$|E
2500|$|Negligent {{misrepresentation}} as tort {{where no}} contractual <b>privity</b> exists was disallowed in England by Derry v Peek however, this position was overturned in Hedley Byrne v Heller in 1964 so that such actions were allowed if a [...] "special relationship" [...] {{existed between the}} plaintiff and defendant. United States courts and scholars [...] "paid lip-service" [...] to Derry; however, scholars such as William Prosser {{argued that it was}} misinterpreted by English courts. The case of Ultramares Corporation v. Touche (1932) limited the liability of an auditor to known identified beneficiaries of the audit and this rule was widely applied in the United States until the 1960s. The Restatement (Second) of Torts expanded liability to [...] "foreseeable" [...] users rather than specifically identified [...] "foreseen" [...] users of the information, dramatically expanding liability and affecting professionals such as accountants, architects, attorneys, and surveyors. As of 1989, most U.S. jurisdictions follow either the Ultramares approach or the Restatement approach.|$|E
2500|$|Yet the <b>privity</b> rule survived. In Cadillac Motor Car Co. v. Johnson, (decided in 1915 by {{the federal}} appeals court for New York and several {{neighboring}} states), {{the court held that}} a car owner could not recover for injuries from a defective wheel, when the automobile owner had a contract only with the automobile dealer and not with the manufacturer, even though there was [...] "no question that the wheel was made of dead and ‘dozy‘ wood, quite insufficient for its purposes." [...] The Cadillac court was willing to acknowledge that the case law supported exceptions for [...] "an article dangerous in its nature or likely to become so {{in the course of the}} ordinary usage to be contemplated by the vendor." [...] However, held the Cadillac court, [...] "one who manufactures articles dangerous only if defectively made, or installed, e.g., tables, chairs, pictures or mirrors hung on the walls, carriages, automobiles, and so on, is not liable to third parties for injuries caused by them, except in case of willful injury or fraud," ...|$|E
2500|$|Cardozo's new [...] "rule" [...] {{exists in}} no prior case, but is inferrable as a {{synthesis}} of the [...] "thing of danger" [...] principle stated in them, merely extending it to [...] "foreseeable danger" [...] even if [...] "the purposes {{for which it was}} designed" [...] were not themselves [...] "a source of great danger." [...] MacPherson takes some care to present itself as foreseeable progression, not a wild departure. Cardozo continues to adhere to the original principle of Winterbottom, that [...] "absurd and outrageous consequences" [...] must be avoided, and he does so by drawing a new line in the last sentence quoted above: [...] "There must be knowledge of a danger, not merely possible, but probable." [...] But while adhering to the underlying principle that some boundary is necessary, MacPherson overruled the prior common law by rendering the formerly dominant factor in the boundary, that is, the <b>privity</b> formality arising out of a contractual relationship between persons, totally irrelevant. Rather, {{the most important factor in}} the boundary would be the nature of the thing sold and the foreseeable uses that downstream purchasers would make of the thing.|$|E
2500|$|One {{example of}} the gradual change that typifies {{evolution}} of the common law is the gradual change in liability for negligence. The traditional common law rule {{through most of the}} 19th century was that a plaintiff could not recover for a defendant's negligent production or distribution of a harmful instrumentality unless the two were in <b>privity</b> of contract. Thus, only the immediate purchaser could recover for a product defect, and if a part was built up out of parts from parts manufacturers, the ultimate buyer could not recover for injury caused by a defect in the part. In an 1842 English case, Winterbottom v. Wright, the postal service had contracted with Wright to maintain its coaches. Winterbottom was a driver for the post. When the coach failed and injured Winterbottom, he sued Wright. The Winterbottom court recognized that there would be [...] "absurd and outrageous consequences" [...] if an injured person could sue any person peripherally involved, and knew it had to draw a line somewhere, a limit on the causal connection between the negligent conduct and the injury. The court looked to the contractual relationships, and held that liability would only flow as far as the person in immediate contract ("privity") with the negligent party.|$|E
2500|$|However, {{consideration}} is a doctrine deriving {{from the common}} law, and can be suspended under the principles of equity. Historically, England had two separate court systems, and the Courts of Chancery which derived their ultimate authority from the King via the Lord Chancellor, took precedence over the common law courts. So does its body of equitable principles since the systems were merged in 1875. The doctrine of promissory estoppel holds that when one person gives an assurance to another, the other relies on it {{and it would be}} inequitable to go back on the assurance, that person will be estopped from doing so: an analogue of the maxim that nobody should profit from their own wrong (nemo auditur propriam turpitudinem allegans). So in Hughes v Metropolitan Railway Co the House of Lords held that a tenant could not be ejected by the landlord for failing to keep up with his contractual repair duties because starting negotiations to sell the property gave the tacit assurance that the repair duties were suspended. And in Central London Properties Ltd v High Trees House Ltd Denning J held that a landlord would be estopped from claiming normal rent during the years of World War II because he had given an assurance that half rent could be paid till the war was done. The Court of Appeal went even further in a recent debt repayment case, Collier v P J Wright (Holdings) Ltd. Arden LJ argued that a partner who had been assured he was only liable to repay one third of the partnership's debts, rather than be jointly and severally liable for the whole, had relied on the assurance by making repayments, and it was inequitable for the finance company to later demand full repayment of the debt. Hence, promissory estoppel could circumvent the common law rule of Foakes. Promissory estoppel, however, has been thought to be incapable of raising an independent cause of action, so that one may only plead another party is estopped from enforcing their strict legal rights as a [...] "shield", but cannot bring a cause of action out of estoppel as a [...] "sword". In Australia, this rule was relaxed in Walton Stores (Interstate) Ltd v Maher, where Mr Maher was encouraged to believe he would have a contract to sell his land, and began knocking down his existing building before Walton Stores finally told him they did not wish to complete. Mr Maher got generous damages covering his loss (i.e. reliance damages, but seemingly damages for loss of expectations as if there were a contract). Yet, where an assurance concerns rights over property, a variant [...] "proprietary estoppel" [...] does allow a claimant to plead estoppel as a cause of action. So in Crabb v Arun District Council, Mr Crabbe was assured he would have the right to an access point to his land by Arun District Council, and relying on that he sold off half the property where the only existing access point was. The council was estopped from not doing what they said they would. Given the complex route of legal reasoning to reach simple solutions, it is unsurprising that a number of commentators, as well as the Principles of European Contract Law have called for simple abandonment of the doctrine of consideration, leaving the basic requirements of agreement and an intention to create legal relations. Such a move would also dispense with the need for the common law doctrine of <b>privity.</b>|$|E
