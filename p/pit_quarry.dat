50|$|Today {{the mine}} is {{predominantly}} exploited {{in an open}} <b>pit</b> <b>quarry</b> but several of the many underground mines (deep and extending over several km) still remain viable. Selenizza is produced primarily in granular form, after melting the bitumen pieces selected in the mine. Selenizza is mainly used as an additive in the road construction sector. It is mixed with traditional asphalt to improve both the viscoelastic properties and the resistance to ageing. It may be blended with the hot asphalt in tanks, but its granular form allows it to be fed in the mixer or in the recycling ring of normal asphalt plants. Other typical applications include the production of mastic asphalts for sidewalks, bridges, car-parks and urban roads as well as drilling fluid additives for {{the oil and gas}} industry. Selenizza is available in powder or in granular material of various particle sizes and is packaged in sacks or in thermal fusible polyethylene bags.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. This paper {{focuses on}} {{computational}} fluid dynamics (CFD) simulation of the dynamic exploited influence of wind field in the open <b>pit</b> <b>quarry.</b> We have picked up 3 normal exploitation parameters, e. g. the exploited depth z, the type of small hills and the measured velocity u 1, 7 simulated experiments have been done by software Fluent as well. In our experiments, the features of velocity field around the mine are shown, {{with the effects of}} open <b>pit</b> <b>quarry,</b> so as to analyze the changes of wind speed when it gets through this mine. To be exact, {{it will be possible to}} deduce there is negative correlation between the velocity decreased gratitude and the exploited depth. Besides, with the shelter effect of a small hill, the wind speed tends to slow down near this hill, and turn back to rise until the flow leaves the hill far away. The velocity decreasing has positive correlation with the measured velocity u 1, and the reverse flow is more likely to appear with higher u 1...|$|E

40|$|Drilling and {{blasting}} {{are fundamental}} {{operations in the}} mining cycle and consti tute {{an important component of}} the mining costs. Rock fragmentation can in principle be managed by means of two options: by increasing or reducing the specific consumption of explosives, or by modifying the drilling pattern. The choice of one or other type of control depends on the relationship between the unit costs of drilling and explosives, and on technical restrictions or regulations imposed by different reasons. It is then necessary to identify the link between the blast design and some factors affecting the downstream processing of the product. This paper analyzes the theoretical basis aimed at evaluating the main parameters involved when organizing a production blast in open <b>pit</b> <b>quarries.</b> In particular, a method developed through the analysis of the results in a large number of limestone open <b>pit</b> <b>quarries</b> in Italy is described and commented.

40|$|The {{following}} paper aims to {{test and}} evaluate the accuracy of UAV data for volumetric measurements to the conventional GNSS techniques. For this purpose, an appropriate open <b>pit</b> <b>quarry</b> has been chosen. Two sets of measurements were performed. Firstly, a stockpile was measured by GNSS technologies and later other terrestrial GNSS measurements for modelling the berms of the quarry were taken. Secondly, {{the area of the}} whole quarry including the stockpile site was mapped by a UAV flight. Having considered how dynamic our world is, new techniques and methods should be presented in numerous fields. For instance, the management of an open <b>pit</b> <b>quarry</b> requires gaining, processing and storing a large amount of information which is constantly changing with time. Fast and precise acquisition of measurements regarding the process taking place in a quarry is the key to an effective and stable maintenance. In other words, this means getting an objective evaluations of the processes, using up-to-date technologies and reliable accuracy of the results. Often legislations concerning mine engineering state that the volumetric calculations are to present ± 3 % accuracy of the whole amount. On one hand, extremely precise measurements could be performed by GNSS technologies, however, it could be really time consuming. On the other hand, UAV photogrammetry presents a fast, accurate method for mapping large areas and calculating stockpiles volumes. The study case was performed {{as a part of a}} master thesis...|$|E

The excavation is performed by explosives, followed by mucking with backhoe excavators and transportation to the crushing plant through dump trucks. All data on the currently in use machines at the quarry were taken into account. Economic evaluations were carried out by analyzing the fuel consumption of each machine; then different models of machines with the same power and capacity features were examined, to evaluate cheaper alternatives. Finally, the more advantageous fleet from an economic standpoint was rated, considering the critical geometry of the quarry. The cost of an initial investment was also evaluated, in reference to the purchase of a new fleet. The cycle times of the machines were experimentally evaluated on site. The results obtained are analyzed in the light of future perspectives; the analysis revealed a reliability of the evaluation and the quarry is currently testing the solution propose...|$|E
40|$|Between September 2015 and January 2016 Wardell Armstrong Archaeology (WAA) {{undertook}} a geophysical {{survey of land}} off Foxlydiate Lane, Webheath, Redditch, Worcestershire. The survey was undertaken for Hayford Developments Limited, to provide information to support a planning application for a mixed-use development at the site. An historic environment assessment of the site has been undertaken by Wardell Armstrong, which will be presented in a separate report. The Worcestershire Historic Environment Record records the presence of Hawthorn <b>Pit</b> <b>Quarry</b> {{on the east side}} of the proposed development area, and several distinct areas of ridge and furrow cultivation. Possible settlement earthworks are also recorded on the west side of the site and a holloway is recorded east of Lanehouse Farm. The objective of the geophysical survey was therefore to determine the presence/absence, nature and extent of potential archaeological features within the study area, and the presence/absence of any known modern features within the survey area, which may affect the results. Geomagnetic survey was undertaken over the majority of the study area on a field by field basis, which comprised arable and pasture land at the time of the survey. A majority of the geophysical anomalies detected at the site are believed to be agricultural in origin, including further evidence for former ridge and furrow cultivation, and a number of former field boundaries and quarry pits/ponds, many of which are depicted on historic maps of the site.

40|$|This {{doctoral}} thesis was written at the Technologies for Cultural Heritage Laboratory (TCH Lab) {{which is part}} of the Electronic Department of the University of Florence. It is a multidisciplinary laboratory in the Information Technology area that is dealing with developing and testing of innovative techniques for conservation and monitoring of Cultural and Environmental Heritage. This thesis deals with advanced data processing in Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar for unstable slope monitoring. Mainly the attention of the author is turned to the data processing algorithms for imaging the meaningful content of the specific radar observations. The particular acquisition system used in each type of observation was developed at the TCH Lab and was based on a Continuous Wave Stepped Frequency radar architecture. Now GB-SAR interferometry is generally recognized as a powerful tool for detecting the displacements of large structures such as dams or buildings, but also for the terrain monitoring, exactly as the space-born SAR interferometry. But, in respect to space- born systems, for monitoring localized landslide phenomena (of the order of 1 km x 1 km area), GB-SAR seems to be more suitable as it can be specifically set up for a particular scenario geometry and in according to the dynamic characteristics of the landslide. While conventional interferometric synthetic aperture radar is a very effective technique for measuring surface deformation, almost any interferogram includes large areas where the signals decorrelate and no measurements are possible. Consequently, most SAR studies focuses on areas that are dry and sparsely vegetated. A relatively new analysis technique (PS method) overcomes the decorrelation problem by identifying resolution elements whose echo is dominated by a single scatterer in a series of interferograms. After an introduction on radar and SAR systems, in this Thesis we focused on the application of GB-SAR to monitor an open <b>pit</b> <b>quarry</b> using the PS method, and on the influence of the atmospheric disturbances, in particular boundary layer turbulence, on ground based radar measurements. As far as the turbulence disturbances concerns, in this thesis an experimental survey was planned in order to deeply understand how radar signal, and in particular his statistic, can change in presence of such phenomena. The results obtained by using these procedures on real data acquired in a experimental facility are discussed too. The agreement between theoretical and real data confirms the validity of the used statistic, confirming the “Universal distribution” as a powerful tool to understand differend kind of complex phenomena. Chapter 1 deals with Synthetic aperture techniques for imaging and interferometric applications, while Chapter 2 describes a measurement campaign in an open <b>pit</b> <b>quarry</b> near Florence, and his results are presented and discussed. Chapter 3 presents two experiments devoted to the study of the influence of atmospherical turbulence on radar signals.
