40|$|<b>Geared</b> <b>systems</b> {{have been}} widely used in {{mechanical}} applications for more than a hundred years. A large range of literature has been published especially for spur/helical <b>gear</b> <b>systems</b> and the investigations into technical areas of spur/helical gears have been very well developed, including understanding of condition monitoring systems, diagnostic and prognostic methods. However, {{there is a lack of}} understanding on the general dynamic behavior of <b>planetary</b> <b>gear</b> <b>systems</b> with tooth faults. <b>Planetary</b> <b>gears</b> are normally used as effective power transmission elements with high power to weight/volume ratios, large speed reductions in compact volume, and high reliability. They tend to have high efficiency and are used in many applications, such as automotive, heavy truck/tractor, helicopter, wind turbines and bucket wheel reclaimer gearboxes. The purpose of this research is to develop a vibration analysis system that simulates dynamic behavior of large low speed, high torque <b>planetary</b> spur <b>gear</b> <b>systems</b> such as used in bucket wheel reclaimer and wind turbine gearboxes, with and without gear element faults. This thesis investigates lumped mass modelling methods for planetary gearbox dynamic behavior based on previous gearbox modelling research including the use of the coupled torsional-transverse behavior of the gear body. The dynamic model of the <b>planetary</b> spur <b>gear</b> <b>system</b> includes effects such as: variable tooth mesh stiffness, dynamic transmission error effects, and pitch and profile excitation for gear fault detection purposes. Different tooth faults are simulated using the concept of combined torsional mesh stiffness. The dynamics of spur <b>planetary</b> <b>gear</b> <b>systems</b> with and without tooth faults are compared and analyzed to improve the understanding of fault detection in the present <b>gear</b> <b>systems.</b> Dynamic modelling of <b>gear</b> <b>systems,</b> such as outlined in this thesis can assist in understanding the consequence of large transient events, including the fluctuations in tooth loads which can reduce gear fatigue life and lead to further tooth damage. Early detection of faults on gear teeth can be used to initiate maintenance actions in order to reduce repair work and avoid catastrophic breakdown...|$|R
50|$|Many IVTs {{result from}} the {{combination}} of a CVT with a <b>planetary</b> <b>gear</b> <b>system</b> which enforces an IVT output shaft rotation speed which is equal to the difference between two other speeds within the IVT. This IVT configuration uses its CVT as a continuously variable regulator (CVR) of the rotation speed of any one of the three rotators of the <b>planetary</b> <b>gear</b> <b>system</b> (PGS). If two of the PGS rotator speeds are the input and output of the CVR, there is a setting of the CVR that results in the IVT output speed of zero. The maximum output/input ratio can be chosen from infinite practical possibilities through selection of additional input or output gear, pulley or sprocket sizes without affecting the zero output or the continuity of the whole system. The IVT is always engaged, even during its zero output adjustment.|$|E
50|$|IVTs can in some {{implementations}} offer better {{efficiency in}} the preferred range of operation {{when compared to other}} CVTs because most of the power flows through the <b>planetary</b> <b>gear</b> <b>system</b> and not the controlling CVR. Torque transmission capability can also be increased. Staging power splits is also possible for further increase in efficiency, torque transmission capability and better maintenance of efficiency over a wide gear ratio range.|$|E

It {{is a type}} of animal engine somewhat more sophisticated than a horse mill. A common design for the horse engine was a large treadmill on which one or more horses walked. The surface of the treadmill was made of wooden slats linked like a chain.

If the housing is held still, the driver’s steer inputs are translated from the input sun gear, thought the planetary gears (sharing a common lay shaft) to the output sun gear with a net 1:1 ratio. I.e. if the planetary gear housing is held still, conventional steering operation is retained.

They {{are used in}} helicopter, aerospace, automobile, and many industrial applications. High-speed <b>planetary</b> <b>gear</b> <b>systems</b> will have significant dynamic loading and high heat generation. Hence, they need jet lubrication and associated cooling systems. For units operating in critical applications that necessitate high reliability and long life, that have very large torque loading, and that have downtime costs that are significantly greater than the initial cost, hydrodynamic journal bearings are a must. Computational and analytical tools are needed for sufficiently accurate modeling to facilitate optimal design of these systems. Sufficient physics is needed in the model to facilitate parametric studies of design conditions that enable optimal designs. The first transient journal bearing code to implement the Jacobsson-Floberg-Olsson boundary conditions, using a mass-conserving algorithm devised by Professor Emeritus Harold Elrod of Columbia University, was written by David E. Brewe of the U. S. Army at the NASA Lewis Research Center 1 in 1983. Since then, new features and improved modifications have been built into the code by several contributors supported through Army and NASA funding via cooperative agreements with the University of Toledo (Professor Ted Keith, Jr., and Dr. Desikakary Vijayaraghavan) and National Research Council Programs (Dr. Vijayaraghavan).

40|$|Abstract <b>Planetary</b> <b>gears</b> {{are very}} popular {{as a power}} {{transmission}} and extensively used {{in a variety of}} industrial fields like automobiles, helicopters, aircraft engines, heavy machinery, {{and a variety of other}} applications. Despite their advantages, negative impacts on customer perception of quality from noise and vibration are ongoing issue. The noise induced by the vibration of <b>planetary</b> <b>gear</b> <b>systems</b> remains a key concern. Therefore in recent years to reduce gear vibrations different techniques have been proposed. In this paper the experimental work is carried out to study the effect of planet phasing on vibrations of <b>planetary</b> <b>gear</b> set. For this purpose experimental set up is built and trials were performed for two different arrangements i. e with phasing and without phasing. And it is seen that noise level and resulting vibrations were reduced by planet phasing arrangement. So from the experimental results it is observed that by applying the meshing phase difference one can reduce <b>planetary</b> <b>gear</b> set vibrations and noise...|$|R
50|$|The current Autobike uses {{three main}} {{components}} in its automatic transmission. In order to provide the system with power, the front wheel uses a hub dynamo to generate electricity. Wires connect the dynamo through the frame to the bottom bracket area where it joins a small onboard computer with sensors that detect the rider's speed and cadence. The computer uses this information to actuate a motorised shifter mounted on the rear wheel's hub gear to change the gear ratio. The rear hub used is the Nuvinci N360 CVP which is a continuously variable transmission using a <b>planetary</b> <b>gear</b> <b>system</b> that can be shifted smoothly at any time, under any load.|$|E

The largest use of 3D printed planetary gear systems is as toys for children. Since herringbone gears are easy to 3D print, it has become very popular to 3D print a moving herringbone <b>planetary</b> <b>gear</b> <b>system</b> for teaching children how gears work. An advantage of herringbone gears is that they don't fall out of the ring and don't need a mounting plate.|$|E

While a conventional motor is constructed from thousands of parts, the Turbozám only has around 20. It uses a single sparkplug and a single four-cycle chamber, and has no connecting rods, pistons, camshafts, valves, carburetor or crankshaft. It consists of rotating parts on a drive shaft that, on rotating, produces compression and expansion aided by the inertia of a flywheel, based on a pair of blades or [...] "bailadores" [...] that act as pistons, named in honor of his village. These blades replace the rotating cam of conventional motors and are driven by a <b>planetary</b> <b>gear</b> <b>system</b> which forms a combustion chamber between the two blades. The feasibility of this engine has been proven by engineers at the University of Los Andes interested in the subject, but has not been implemented, due to lack of support for blade construction.

Vibration measurements show the model correctly predicts the frequencies with large components around the first several harmonics of the gear mesh frequency.

5000|$|Thus, an {{inertial}} reference frame is entrained by the rotating central mass {{to participate in the}} latter's rotation; this is called frame-dragging, and has been tested experimentally.Qualitatively, frame-dragging can be viewed as the gravitational analog of electromagnetic induction. An [...] "ice skater", in orbit over the equator and rotationally at rest with respect to the stars, extends her arms. The arm extended toward the black hole will be torqued spinward. The arm extended away from the black hole will be torqued anti-spinward. She will therefore be rotationally sped up, in a counter-rotating sense to the black hole. This is the opposite of what happens in everyday experience. If she is already rotating at a certain speed when she extends her arms, inertial effects and frame-dragging effects will balance and her spin will not change. Due to the Principle of Equivalence gravitational effects are locally indistinguishable from inertial effects, so this rotation rate, at which when she extends her arms nothing happens, is her local reference for non-rotation. This frame is rotating with respect to the fixed stars and counter-rotating with respect to the black hole. A useful metaphor is a <b>planetary</b> <b>gear</b> <b>system</b> with the black hole being the sun gear, the ice skater being a planetary gear and the outside universe being the ring gear. This can be also be interpreted through Mach's principle.|$|E
5000|$|Also, {{an inner}} region is dragged {{more than an}} outer region. This {{produces}} interesting locally rotating frames. For example, imagine that a north-south-oriented ice skater, in orbit over the equator {{of a black hole}} and rotationally at rest with respect to the stars, extends her arms. The arm extended toward the black hole will be [...] "torqued" [...] spinward due to gravitomagnetic induction ("torqued" [...] is in quotes because gravitational effects are not considered [...] "forces" [...] under GR). Likewise the arm extended away from the black hole will be torqued anti-spinward. She will therefore be rotationally sped up, in a counter-rotating sense to the black hole. This is the opposite of what happens in everyday experience. There exists a particular rotation rate that, should she be initially rotating at that rate when she extends her arms, inertial effects and frame-dragging effects will balance and her rate of rotation will not change. Due to the Principle of Equivalence gravitational effects are locally indistinguishable from inertial effects, so this rotation rate, at which when she extends her arms nothing happens, is her local reference for non-rotation. This frame is rotating with respect to the fixed stars and counter-rotating with respect to the black hole. This effect is analogous to the hyperfine structure in atomic spectra due to nuclear spin.

40|$|An {{understanding}} of the vibration spectra is very useful for any gear fault detection scheme based upon vibration measurements. The vibration measured from <b>planetary</b> <b>gears</b> is complicated. Sternfeld noted the presence of sidebands about the gear mesh harmonics spaced at the planet passage frequency in spectra measured near the ring gear of a CH- 47 helicopter. McFadden proposes a simple model of the vibration transmission that predicts high spectral amplitudes at multiples of the planet passage frequency, for <b>planetary</b> <b>gears</b> with evenly spaced planets. This model correctly predicts no strong signal at the meshing frequency {{when the number of}} teeth on the ring gear is not an integer multiple of the number of planets.
