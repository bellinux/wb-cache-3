50|$|Long term, poor saddle fit {{may cause}} {{multiple}} back {{problems for the}} horse. It is possible for the horse's topline muscles to deteriorate, or for the horse to develop the wrong muscles. The muscles of the back just rear of the withers may atrophy, causing hollows right behind the shoulders, giving the withers the appearance of being higher and sharper. Horses may also lose muscle tone from traveling with a hollowed back, leading to increased risk of lordosis ("swayback"), kissing spines, or pinched nerves. For riders, spending long hours in a poorly fitting saddle may result in lower back pain {{as a consequence of}} incorrect <b>pelvic</b> <b>angle.</b> Saddles that are too small may also cause discomfort if the rider's seat is pushed into contact with the pommel.|$|E
40|$|In {{clinical}} practice {{the degree of}} pelvictilt is commonly assessed because of its reported relationship to pelvic, spinal and lower limb pathologies. There is little normative data presented within the literature establishing typical findings within an asymptomaticpopulation from which to make comparisons in pathological populations. The {{aim of this study}} was to report typical <b>pelvic</b> <b>angle</b> in an asymptomaticpopulations and also the degree of side-to-side asymmetry which might exist within the pelvis. <b>Pelvic</b> <b>angle</b> was measured by finding the angle from horizontal of a line between the anterior superior and posterior superior iliac spines of the ilium using a PALM palpation meter in 120 healthy subjects (65 males, 55 females) with a mean age of 23. 8 (2. 1) years. 85 % of males and 75 % of females presented with an anterior pelvictilt, 6 % of males and 7 % of females with a posterior tilt and 9 % of males and 18 % of females presented as neutral. There was significant difference in <b>pelvic</b> <b>angle</b> between sides for males (p = 0. 002) but a non-significant difference between sides for females (p = 0. 314). But the difference in angle for males between sides was less than the smallest detectable difference statistic found in the reliability study, so most likely to be due to measurement error...|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to determine whether a landmark protocol could reliably gather more anatomically accurate data than the default software setting for an electromagnetic tracking system. Nineteen healthy participants (10 males, 9 females) were measured clinically for <b>pelvic</b> <b>angle</b> (deg), tibiofemoral angle (deg), and navicular drop (mm) and compared to kinematic variables of transverse knee angle, frontal plane knee valgus/varus angle, and sagittal plane <b>pelvic</b> <b>angle</b> obtained from both the default and landmark digitization protocols (counterbalanced). Day-to-day reliability for both digitization protocols ranged from an ICC of – 0. 44 (9. 5 °) to 0. 72 (2. 3 °). Kinematic values obtained from the landmark protocol were generally larger and more variable than those obtained from the default setting, and tended to correlate better with the clinical measures of anatomical alignment. While further study is needed, the landmark protocol shows promise as a method for collecting kinematic data that more closely approximate...|$|E

[Purpose] To {{investigate}} {{the effects of}} erect sitting, slouched posture with cross-legged sitting, and erect posture with cross-legged sitting on the lumbar and <b>pelvic</b> <b>angles,</b> and gluteal pressure. [Subjects] For the ex-periments, 17 healthy women were recruited. [Methods] All {{subjects were asked to}} perform three sitting postures: erect sitting, slouched posture with cross-legged sitting, and erect posture with cross-legged sitting. Lumbar and <b>pelvic</b> <b>angles</b> were measured using a three-dimensional motion-capture system, and gluteal pressure was measured using a pressure mat. [Results] Compared to erector sitting, slouched posture with cross-legged sitting showed significantly greater lumbar flexion, posterior pelvic tilt, and left pelvic tilt. Compared to erect sitting, erect posture with cross-legged sitting showed significantly greater lumbar flexion and posterior pelvic tilt. Compared to erect posture with cross-legged sitting, slouched posture with cross-legged sitting showed significantly greater lumbar flexion and posterior pelvic tilt. Compared to erect sitting and erect posture with cross-legged sitting, slouched pos-ture with cross-legged sitting showed significantly greater left gluteal pressure; {{there was no significant difference}} in right gluteal pressure.

40|$|The {{most common}} {{definition}} of <b>pelvic</b> <b>angles</b> in conventional gait analysis uses the sequence tilt, obliquity, rotation. This {{is used in}} most commercially available gait analysis software. This definition of angles, however, is not {{in agreement with the}} conventional clinical understanding of the terms when both tilt and rotation are large. This paper shows that by using the sequence rotation, obliquity, tilt it is possible to make a mathematically rigorous definition of <b>pelvic</b> <b>angles</b> which it is consistent with that conventional clinical usage. A model of the pelvis in which the hips are maintained level is developed. It is shown that as tilt and rotation are varied, in a clinically relevant range, that obliquity measured using the conventional sequence can be as much as 10 °. By definition it is 0 ° for the new sequence. A case study shows that measures of obliquity correlate better with the relative height of the hips using the new sequence than the conventional one. It is proposed that use of the new sequence would lead to data which is easier to interpret clinically...|$|R

The aim of our study was to determine kinematic parameters of spine and pelvis during trunk flexion, extension and lateral bending in normal, healthy subjects. Kinematic motion analysis was performed on 63 asymptomatic volunteers for four different trunk motions. This study has shown that the pelvis range of motion is affected by the gender. Contribution of pelvic movement to trunk flexion was 50 %, while <b>pelvic</b> <b>angle</b> was significantly higher in women.

40|$|Children with {{attention}} deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) frequently have motor problems. Previous {{studies have reported}} that the characteristic gait in children with ADHD is immature and that subjects demonstrate higher levels of variability in gait characteristics for the lower extremities than healthy controls. However, {{little is known about}} body movement during gait in children with ADHD. The {{purpose of this study was}} to identify the characteristic body movements associated with ADHD symptoms in children with ADHD. Using a three-dimensional motion analysis system, we compared gait variables in boys with ADHD (n = 19; mean age, 9. 58 years) and boys with typical development (TD) (n = 21; mean age, 10. 71 years) to determine the specific gait characteristics related to ADHD symptoms. We assessed spatiotemporal gait variables (i. e. speed, stride length, and cadence), and kinematic gait variables (i. e. angle of pelvis, hip, knee, and ankle) to measure body movement when walking at a self-selected pace. In comparison with the TD group, the ADHD group demonstrated significantly higher values in cadence (t = 3. 33, p = 0. 002) and anterior <b>pelvic</b> <b>angle</b> (t = 3. 08, p = 0. 004). In multiple regression analysis, anterior <b>pelvic</b> <b>angle</b> was associated with the ADHD rating scale hyperactive/impulsive scores (β = 0. 62, t = 2. 58, p = 0. 025), but not other psychiatric symptoms in the ADHD group.

Our kinematic findings could have potential implications for evaluating the body movement in boys with ADHD...|$|E
40|$|Hip {{range of}} motion (ROM) may {{influence}} movement kinematics and kinetics during sprinting. The purpose {{of this research was}} to investigate the relationships between hip ROM and measures of sprint kinematics and kinetics in track and field athletes, and to assess changes in these variables at different stages of the athletics season. Nineteen national-level track and field athletes undertook testing procedures for kinematic and kinetic assessment. Twelve participants returned to the laboratory 12 weeks later to carry out the same testing procedures. Clinical assessments of static and active hip ROM were conducted using a Thomas test and the active straight-leg raise. The kinematic data were collected from over-ground 40 m sprint trials recorded at 240 Hz and the kinetic data were obtained from a non-motorised treadmill with in-built load cells. The reliability of these assessments were analysed via intraclass correlation coefficients and typical error. Pearson correlation coefficients were used to examine the relationships between the kinematic and kinetic variables and the change scores between testing occasions were analysed by calculating the percentage change and effect sizes to make magnitude-based inferences. The results showed that all assessments had good reliability apart from hip extension (HE) angular velocity. Correlational analysis revealed very large correlations between dynamic hip flexion (HF) ROM and HE angular velocity (r = 0. 76), and very large negative correlations between dynamic HF ROM and <b>pelvic</b> <b>angle</b> at peak HE (r = - 0. 71), as well as peak running velocity and ground contact time (r = - 0. 73). There was also a large correlation shown between dynamic HE ROM and <b>pelvic</b> <b>angle</b> at peak HF (r = 0. 55), and large negative correlations shown between angular HF velocity and contact time (r = - 0. 61), and angular HE velocity and <b>pelvic</b> <b>angle</b> at peak HE (r = - 0. 69). Changes in the kinematic and kinetic variables were shown to be trivial between testing occasions. In conclusion, the high reliability shown for clinical measures of hip ROM and assessment of sprint kinematics and kinetics makes these tests useful for researchers and practitioners. Furthermore, the observed correlations between measures of hip ROM and sprinting kinematics and kinetics have implications for the development of technical sprinting abilities such as achieving a high degree of dynamic HF ROM to maximize HE angular velocity. The correlations between dynamic hip ROM and <b>pelvic</b> <b>angle</b> during running may also have implications for reducing vertebral impingement and hamstring strain injuries...|$|E

40|$|Background and objective: The line {{joining the}} two iliac crests is classically {{regarded}} as the anatomical landmark determining the inter-vertebral space L 4 -L 5 for the spinal punctures. Its variability has been reported but never related to predictive clinical anatomic factors identifying patients groups {{in which there is}} increased risk of miscalculation of the spinal level. Methods: Two sagittal <b>pelvic</b> anatomical <b>angles,</b> called 'pelvic incidence' and 'pelvic lordosis' were measured on lateral X-rays of the pelvis of 132 normal individuals and 49 spondylolysis patients. The values were compared with the sagittal projection of the intercrestal line on the discovertebral lumbar structures. Results: A strict relation was observed between this projection of the intercrestal line and the sagittal <b>pelvic</b> anatomical <b>angles.</b> The greater the pelvic incidence, the higher the intercrestal line was projected, all the more in patients with spondylolysis with a listhesis or a disc narrowing. Conclusions: The relation between the <b>pelvic</b> sagittal <b>angles</b> and the intercrestal line projection explains the variability described for this anatomical landmark. It implies precautions minimizing neurological risk {{in the case of a}} puncture carried out more cranially than expected, particularly for high values of pelvic incidence occurring in spinal pathologies such as spondylolysis, in the elderly or in the obese patients. In these cases, we recommend the use of spinal imaging during the procedure to assist selection of the desired insertion level...|$|R

Compared with Jersey cows, Holstein-Friesians were characterized by a higher calf weight to cow weight ratio, and higher ratios of pelvic area to cow weight and pelvic area to calf weight. The results of the study show that higher frequency of difficult calving recorded in Holstein-Friesians, in comparison with Jersey heifers, could be a consequence of relatively high calf weight and less preferable pelvic structure.

40|$|In the {{research}} setting, instrumented treadmills {{are often used}} to study prolonged periods of walking. This thesis examines the effects of in-shoe foot orthoses on walking gait during prolonged periods of treadmill walking. The two types of foot orthoses investigated were: 1) a pedorthist hand-made orthotic with medial longitudinal arch (MLA) support and 2) a proprioceptive feedback-type orthotic designed to stimulate the intrinsic foot muscles of the MLA. The three kinematic variables observed over 60 minutes of intermittent treadmill walking were toe-out angle in the transverse plane, <b>pelvic</b> tilt <b>angle</b> in the sagittal plane, and trunk lean angle in the frontal plane. Kinematic data were collected with a real-time optical motion capture system that consisted of five high resolution digital cameras which tracked {{the location of the}} reflective markers placed on the surface of skin. Static and dynamic trials were collected and analyzed to calculate the change in joint angles every 5 minutes of testing. Due to the appearance of three distinct groups for the kinematic variables, each participant was assigned into one of the following groups: Increase Group, No Change Group, or Decrease Group based on the magnitude of the change in joint angles during the 60 minutes of treadmill walking. To be assigned into either the Increase or Decrease Groups, the kinematic variable had to change by at least 1. 5 ˚. In all three conditions, data interpreted within the three subgroups showed statistical significance. In the Control condition, statistical significance was detected in the Increase Group for <b>pelvic</b> tilt <b>angle</b> and the Decrease Group for toe-out angle. In the MLA orthotic condition, statistical significance was detected in the Increase Group for <b>pelvic</b> tilt <b>angle</b> and the Decrease Group for trunk lean angle. In the Proprioceptive orthotic condition, statistical significance was detected in the Increase Group for <b>pelvic</b> tilt <b>angle</b> and the Decrease Group for trunk lean angle.

40|$|Import JabRef | WosArea Orthopedics; RheumatologyInternational audienceObjectives: (1) to {{investigate}} the test-retest reliability of 3 D gait analysis (3 DGA) in hip Osteoarthritis (OA) patients; (2) to find the minimum number of gait trials needed to overcome intrinsic variability; (3) to check the accuracy of angles measured by the 3 D system. Design: 23 Patients suffering from hip OA with no other major disease were recruited. We evaluated the reliability of spatio-temporal variables and body angles (lower-limb joints, trunk and pelvis angles) during two sessions of 3 DGA using intra-class correlation coefficients (ICC). The minimum number of trials needed to overcome intrinsic variability was evaluated using an exponential fit model and the Bland and Altman coefficient of repeatability (CoR). The accuracy of measurement was evaluated using a manual goniometer and the recording of 18 different angles. Results: Spatio-temporal variables {{and most of the}} kinematic joint and trunk angles calculated demonstrated good to excellent reliability (ICC from 0. 77 to 0. 97). This was not the case for <b>pelvic</b> <b>angles.</b> The fitting model combined with the CoR showed that 5 - 10 trials are sufficient to obtain good reliability [ICC sup 0. 7; CoR inf 2 standard deviation (SD) ] for most of the spatio-temporal variables. All body angles showed good reliability (ICC sup 0. 7) and low CoR (inf 2 SD) after five trials except for the <b>pelvic</b> <b>angles.</b> The reliability of marker positioning was found to be good (ICC sup 0. 7) to excellent (ICC sup 0. 9). Differences between angles measured using 3 DGA and angles measured with a manual goniometer were found to be less than one percent. Conclusion: The present study shows that most of variables obtained using 3 DGA in hip OA patients are reliable. Moreover, for most variables, 5 - 10 trials are needed to obtain good reliability and to overcome intrinsic variability, rather than 30 or more, thus improving the feasibility of measurement.

However, the intra-observer and inter-observer reliability of various angles assessing PO was not investigated with this new imaging protocol. Methods A retrospective cohort of 36 EOS frontal fullspine acquisitions made in sitting position was used. The sacroiliac <b>pelvic</b> obliquity <b>angle,</b> iliac crest <b>pelvic</b> obliquity <b>angle,</b> and ischiatic <b>pelvic</b> obliquity <b>angle</b> were assessed in an intra-observer and inter-observer study. Results The use of the EOS-CHAIR protocol was implemented satisfactory with a high acceptance rate by all caregivers and patients and their families. Intra-observer and inter-observer reliability was excellent for the three tested angular measurements. Discussion As for idiopathic scoliosis, we postulate the EOS system as being superior to standard radiographs to assess 3 D spinal deformities in neuromuscular conditions. The EOS-CHAIR protocol improves preoperative comprehension of the lumbosacral junction anatomy in patients with poor standing or sitting postures.

Then {{it is possible to}} use one of these three angles as well as the others to assess frontal pelvic obliquity in neuromuscular patients. This frontal pelvic obliquity protocol in sitting position with the EOS-CHAIR is a validated measurement technique that needs to be used now to measure PO as a critical parameter of the global trunk balance in neuromuscular patients...|$|R
40|$|An {{understanding}} {{concerning the}} roles of the various degrees of freedom of the human body during functions such as walking is crucial to the design of robotic devices for rehabilitation. However, the function of the three rotational degrees of freedom of the pelvis during walking remains uncertain. Theories have been previously presented postulating a role of pelvic obliquity in reducing vertical movements of the body's centre of mass, and therefore in minimising energy expenditure, but these are not fully supported by empirical evidence. In this paper, an alterative role of pelvic obliquity in reducing lateral movements of the upper body is proposed. Through the application of a robotic orthosis platform, a variety of walking conditions are tested with different levels of pelvic rotation and lateral movement of the upper body. The presence of the robotic device significantly reduces the degree of pelvic obliquity. Though the data show no significant relationship between the <b>pelvic</b> <b>angles</b> and lateral movement, a trend for decreasing upper body movement with increasing pelvic obliquity is apparent...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: Rice farming {{activities}} involve prolonged {{manual work}} and human-machine interaction. Prolonged farming risk-exposure {{may result in}} lower limb malalignment. This malalignment may {{increase the risk of}} lower extremity injury and physical disabilities. However, the prevalence and factors associated with lower extremity malalignment have not yet been reported. This study aimed to investigate the prevalence and risk factors of lower extremity malalignment among rice farmers. METHODS: A cross-sectional survey was conducted with 249 rice farmers. Lower extremity alignment assessment included: <b>pelvic</b> tilt <b>angle,</b> limb length equality, femoral torsion, quadriceps (Q) angle, tibiofemoral angle, genu recurvatum, rearfoot angle, and medial longitudinal arch angle. Descriptive statistics were used to analyze participant characteristics and prevalence of lower extremity malalignment. Logistic regression analysis was used to identify risk factors. RESULTS: The highest prevalence of lower extremity malalignment was foot pronation (36. 14 %), followed by the abnormal Q angle (34. 94 %), tibiofemoral angle (31. 73 %), <b>pelvic</b> tilt <b>angle</b> (30. 52 %), femoral antetorsion (28. 11 %), limb length inequality (22. 49 %), tibial torsion (21. 29 %), and genu recurvatum (11. 24 %). In females, the risk factors were abnormal Q angle, tibiofemoral angle, and genu recurvatum. Being overweight was a risk factor for abnormal <b>pelvic</b> tilt <b>angle,</b> Q angle, and tibiofemoral angle. Age was a risk factor for limb length inequality. Years of farming were a major risk factor for abnormal Q angle, tibiofemoral angle, and foot malalignment. CONCLUSION: Prevalence of lower extremity malalignment was reported in this study. Female sex, being overweight, and years of farming were major risk factors for lower extremity malalignment. Lower extremity screening should assist in the identification of foot and knee malalignment in rice farmers. This may then lead to early prevention of musculoskeletal disorders arising from such malalignment. Usa Karukunchit, Rungthip Puntumetakul, Manida Swangnetr, Rose Boucau...|$|R

We therefore propose to begin the evaluation of the sagittal plane alignment of the spine in clinical practice with measurement of the <b>pelvic</b> incidence <b>angle.</b> The relationship between the <b>pelvic</b> incidence <b>angle</b> and the sacral slope, as well as between the sacral slope and lordosis, is then assessed, and these are related to each other. The use of a graphic abacus facilitates assessment of the physiological comparison of the measured values and of the relationship between pelvic and spinal parameters, within their range of physiological variability. This analysis of the sagittal alignment of the spine also considers its dynamic aspect and the importance of gravity load and of muscular contraction on the lumbar structures. These data have been published previously and are recalled here. Three basic patterns of disruption of the relations between parameters may be encountered: a sacral slope angle exceeding the value expected considering the measured <b>pelvic</b> incidence <b>angle</b> (owing to fixed flexion contracture of the hips), excessive lordosis with regard to the observed sacral slope angle (with hyperkyphosis at the thoracic level) and stiff hypolordosis with pelvic retroversion. These three conditions are analysed {{in the light of the}} repercussions of the gravity load on the lumbar structures. A convenient method is thus available for functional analysis of the sagittal balance of the spine...|$|R
50|$|The hip joint, scientifically {{referred}} to as the acetabulofemoral joint (art. coxae), is the joint between the femur and acetabulum of the pelvis and its primary function is to support the weight of the body in both static (e.g. standing) and dynamic (e.g. walking or running) postures. The hip joints are the most important part in retaining balance. The <b>pelvic</b> inclination <b>angle,</b> which {{is the single most important}} element of human body posture, is mostly adjusted at the hips.|$|R
40|$|Purpose] The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} the relationship between the ability to perform the sit-to-stand movement and the maximum pelvic anteversion and retroversion angles of patients. [Subjects] Thirty-two stroke patients (66. 7 ± 7. 6  years) (> 3 months post-stroke) who were able to sit unsupported and 50 age-matched healthy subjects participated in this study. The stroke patients were classified into two groups according to the sit-to-stand movement test: the group that was able to stand up (the stand-able group) (18 persons) and the group that was unable to stand up (the stand-unable group) (14 persons). [Methods] Pelvic anteversion and retroversion maximum angles were measured by a manual goniometer attached to an inclinometer. [Results] The maximum <b>pelvic</b> anteversion <b>angles</b> were − 1. 6 ± 5. 0 °, 1. 2 ± 2. 8 °, and − 12. 4 ± 6. 1 ° in the control group, the stand-able stroke group, and the stand-unable stroke group, respectively. A significant main effect of group was found. An angle discriminating between the two stroke groups was found: the maximum anteversion angles in the stand-able group were distributed above − 5 °. [Conclusion] The maximum <b>pelvic</b> anteversion <b>angle</b> was significantly smaller in the stand-unable group than in the stand-able and control groups. 出版者照会後に全文公...|$|R
40|$|Background: Lower {{extremity}} alignment {{may influence}} the load distribution at the knee, potentially predisposing the anterior cruciate ligament to greater stress. We examined whether lower extremity alignment predicted the magnitude of anterior knee laxity in men and women. Hypothesis: Greater anterior <b>pelvic</b> <b>angle,</b> hip anteversion, tibiofemoral angle, genu recurvatum, and navicular drop will predict greater anterior knee laxity. Study Design: Descriptive laboratory study. Methods: Women (n = 122) and men (n = 97) were measured for anterior knee laxity and 7 lower extremity alignment variables on their dominant stance leg. Linear regression determined {{the extent to which}} the alignment variables predicted anterior knee laxity for each sex. Results: Lower anterior pelvic tilt and tibiofemoral angle, and greater genu recurvatum and navicular drop were related to greater anterior knee laxity in women, explaining 28. 1 % of the variance (P <. 001). Lower anterior pelvic tilt and greater hip anteversion, genu recurvatum and navicular drop were predictors of greater anterior knee laxity in men, explaining 26. 5 % of the variance (P <. 001). Conclusion: Lower anterior pelvic tilt, greater knee hyperextension, and foot pronation predicted greater anterior knee laxity in both men and women, with genu recurvatum and navicular drop having the greatest impact on anterior knee laxity.

40|$|Background: To provide {{patients}} with a superior quality of life (QOL) after their pelvic tumor re-section, ensuring {{the stability of the}} trunk as well as satisfactory lower extremity function is im-portant. Although microsurgical reconstructions for the pelvic ring and hip are used clinically, the details of postoperative long-term spinal deformity and QOL remain unclear. Methods: The pa-tients were 66 - and 43 -year-old men and a 43 -year-old woman. The mean postoperative follow-up period was 134 months. The surgical procedures performed on these patients were: pelvic ring reconstruction using a double-barreled free vascularized fibular graft (FVFG) in Patient 1; simul-taneous pelvic ring reconstruction using FVFG and hip arthrodesis in Patient 2; and latissimus dorsi free flap without pelvic ring reconstruction in Patient 3. As indicators of spinal deformity, we measured the Cobb angle, thoracic kyphosis angle, lumbar lordosis angle, <b>pelvic</b> <b>angle</b> on the sa-gittal plane, and sagittal plane balance using whole spine radiography. To assess the patients ’ QOL, we examined the International Society of Limb Salvage (ISOLS) score, the Roland-Morris Disability Questionnaire (RDQ), activities of daily living (ADL) satisfaction using a visual analogue scale (VAS), and the SF- 36. Results: Spinal alignment in the frontal plane worsened in order from Pa...|$|E
30|$|Ida et al. [28] used X-rays to {{evaluate}} the pelvic posture among cases of acetabular dysplasia (AD) (100 hips from 94 patients, mostly female) with (40 hips) and without (60 hips) cam deformity, {{and found that the}} pelves with combined AD and cam-FAI showed higher forward pelvic rotation (i.e., lower PT) while standing than pelves with pure dysplasia. In detail, the authors measured two less common pelvic parameters, the pelvic inclination angle (i.e., the acute sagittal angle between the line joining the promontorium to the upper surface of the pubic symphisis and the vertical axis) and the <b>pelvic</b> <b>angle</b> (i.e., the sagittal acute angle between the line joining the posterior edge of the sacral plate to the midpoint of the bicoxofemoral axis and the vertical axis), and found that both these parameters were significantly reduced when a cam deformity was associated with dysplasia, only in the upright position and not in decubitus. Notwithstanding the different SS, lumbar lordosis did not differ between the two groups. Intra-/inter-rater reliability was properly assessed, examiners were adequately blind regarding clinical information, and the two groups were comparable with regard to the most relevant confounding variables. Unfortunately no information is provided about PI. The authors conclude that cam deformity is associated with significant forward pelvic rotation in dysplastic acetabula, and this might affect the outcome of corrective acetabular surgery, predisposing to postoperative FAI.|$|E
40|$|In this study, we {{evaluated}} alternative technical markers for the motion {{analysis of the}} pelvic segment. Thirteen subjects walked eight times while tri-dimensional kinematics were recorded for one stride of each trial. Five marker sets were evaluated, and we compared the tilt, obliquity, and rotation angles of the pelvis segment: (1) standard: markers at the anterior and posterior superior iliac spines (ASIS and PSIS); (2) markers at the PSIS and at the hip joint centers, HJCs (estimated by a functional method and described with clusters of markers at the thighs); (3) markers at the PSIS and HJCs (estimated by a predictive method and described with clusters of markers at the thighs); (4) markers at the PSIS and HJCs (estimated by a predictive method and described with skin-mounted markers at the thighs based on the Helen-Hayes marker set); (5) markers at the PSIS and at the iliac spines. Concerning the <b>pelvic</b> <b>angles,</b> evaluation of the alternative technical marker sets evinced that all marker sets demonstrated similar precision across trials (about 1 degrees) but different accuracies (ranging from 1 degrees to 3 degrees) {{in comparison to the}} standard marker set. We suggest that all the investigated marker sets are reliable alternatives to the standard pelvic marker set. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R
40|$|The {{spinal column}} {{performs}} important {{functions in the}} body, including {{the support of the}} entire weight of the human body, the ability to orientate the head in space, bending, flexing and rotating the body. Diseases affecting the spine are manifold: the most frequent is scoliosis, which often affects the female population. It is often treated surgically with a very high percentage of failures. The aim of the thesis is to study the role of instrumentation in mechanical failures encountered 12 months after surgery in the treatment of scoliosis. For the purposes of the study, we analyzed specific biomechanical parameters. The <b>pelvic</b> <b>angles</b> determine the position of the pelvis, while the imbalance parameters the structure of the body. We infer other parameters by analyzing the characteristics of the implanted instrumentation. Initially, the anatomy is described of the spine and vertebrae, the equipment used and the possible failures that may occur after surgery. Subsequently, the materials and methods used for the analysis of the above-mentioned parameters for the 61 patients are reported. All data are obtained by the observation of pre and post-operative x-rays with a special program, by reading reports from operators and by medical records. In the fourth chapter, we report the results: the overall failure rate is 60. 9...|$|R
40|$|Background While the Trendelenburg {{test has}} been used for 120 years to detect hip {{abductor}} muscle weakness, the methodology has not been standardised. Purposes This study undertook to quantitatively analyze the relation between abductor muscle activity and <b>pelvic</b> tilt <b>angle</b> in the Trendelenburg one-leg stance, examine the pitfalls associated with performing the T-test, and develop a modified method that will produce reliable results. Methods A convenience sample of 15 healthy males was asked to assume a one-leg stance in ten different postures, five with mild flexion on the unsupported side, and five with severe flexion. Trunk sway <b>angle,</b> <b>pelvic</b> tilt <b>angle,</b> and the <b>pelvic</b> on femur (POF) angle were measured for each posture. Statistical analysis was used to assess differences in hip abductor activity and public tilt angle between the control posture and the test postures. Results With minimum trunk sway, hip abductor muscle activity increases when the pelvis is elevated and decreases when it is dropped. With trunk sway toward the test side, abductor muscle activity decreased when the pelvis was elevated; with trunk sway toward the non-test side, muscle activity stayed approximately constant when the pelvis was dropped. Conclusions Based on the results we developed a modified T-test methodology that would improve reliability. This test should be performed with minimum trunk sway and severe flexion on the non-test side. The assessment of muscle weakness is based on whether the patient can keep the single-leg standing posture when forced to elevate the pelvis, not simply on the pelvic drop. In future research, we will perform the modified T-test on patients with a suspected hip abductor deficiency, and assess the usefulness of the modified test. © 2016 The Japanese Orthopaedic Associatio...|$|R
