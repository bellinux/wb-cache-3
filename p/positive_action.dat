5|$|In 1932 Wilkinson {{was invited}} by the India League {{to join a}} small delegation, to report on {{conditions}} in India. During the three-month visit she met Gandhi, then in prison, and became convinced that his co-operation was essential to any prospect of peace in the subcontinent. On her return home she delivered her conclusions in an uncompromising report, The Condition of India, published in 1934. She visited Germany shortly after Hitler {{came to power in}} 1933, and published a pamphlet, The Terror in Germany, that documented early incidents of Nazi outrage. She collaborated with a refugee from Hitler's Germany, Edward Conze, to produce a major book, Why Fascism?, which condemned the Labour Party's gradualism and focus upon parliament as well as the failure of communist strategy, arguing for the need for grassroots workers' unity and revolution to check the threat of fascism across Europe. Meanwhile, her parliamentary prospects had been revived by her selection as Labour candidate for Jarrow, a Tyneside shipbuilding town. Jarrow had been devastated early in the 1930s by the run-down and closure of Palmers shipyard, the town's main source of employment. Early in 1934 Wilkinson led a deputation of Jarrow's unemployed to meet the prime minister, MacDonald, in his nearby Seaham constituency, and received sympathy but no <b>positive</b> <b>action.</b> She was unimpressed by the government's Special Areas Act, passed late in 1934 and designed to assist distressed areas such as Jarrow; she thought the legislation provided inadequate funding, and benefited employers more than workers.|$|E

25|$|The British {{convened a}} {{selected}} commission of middle-class Africans, including {{all of the}} Big Six except Nkrumah, to draft a new constitution that would give Ghana more self-government. Nkrumah saw, even before the commission reported, that its recommendations would fall short of full dominion status, and began to organise a <b>Positive</b> <b>Action</b> campaign. Nkrumah demanded a constituent assembly to write a constitution. When the governor, Charles Arden-Clarke, would not commit to this, Nkrumah called for <b>Positive</b> <b>Action,</b> with the unions beginning a general strike to begin on 8 January 1950. The strike quickly led to violence, and Nkrumah and other CPP leaders were arrested on 22 January, and the Evening News was banned. Nkrumah was sentenced {{to a total of}} three years in prison, and he was incarcerated with common criminals in Accra's Fort James.|$|E
25|$|The police {{dismissed}} Police Constable Thiel, {{a prominent}} {{member of the}} force and a union organiser, for union activities. This action was a catalyst for the 1918 strike, a spark for many grievances over pay and conditions. The authorities grossly underestimated the strength of rank-and-file support for <b>positive</b> <b>action</b> to address their grievances and to defend Constable Thiel. The day before the strike began, Police Superintendents reported at their weekly meeting with the Commissioner that all was quiet in the force.|$|E

25|$|In {{cells with}} Hh-activated Patched (Figure 3), the intact Ci protein accumulates {{in the cell}} {{cytoplasm}} and levels of CiR decrease, allowing transcription of some genes such as decapentaplegic (dpp, {{a member of the}} BMP growth factor family). For other Hh-regulated genes, expression requires not only the loss of CiR but also the <b>positive</b> <b>action</b> of uncleaved Ci to act as a transcriptional activator. Costal-2 is normally important for holding Ci protein in the cytoplasm, but interaction of Smoothened with Costal-2 allows some intact Ci protein to go to the nucleus. The Drosophila protein Fused (Fu in Figure 3) is a protein kinase that binds to Costal-2. Fused can inhibit Suppressor of Fused (SUFU), which in turn interacts with Ci to regulate gene transcription in some cell types.|$|E
25|$|In the {{old days}} I had looked up to MacDonald as a great leader. He had a fine {{presence}} and great oratorical power. The unpopular line which he took during the First World War seemed to mark {{him as a man}} of character. Despite his mishandling of the Red Letter episode, I had not appreciated his defects until he took office a second time. I then realised his reluctance to take <b>positive</b> <b>action</b> and noted with dismay his increasing vanity and snobbery, while his habit of telling me, a junior Minister, the poor opinion he had of all his Cabinet colleagues made an unpleasant impression. I had not, however, expected that he would perpetrate the greatest betrayal in the political history of this country... The shock to the Party was very great, especially to the loyal workers of the rank-and-file who had made great sacrifices for these men.|$|E
25|$|Although {{the income}} limit for {{allowances}} varied {{according to the}} position of the child in the family and the number of dependent children, these ceilings were made more favourable in cases where both parents were working or where a single parent was in charge and were linked to changes in wage levels. Those taking parental leave to care for three or more children (provided that they fulfilled the rules for eligibility) also received certain benefits in kind, such as a non-taxable, non-means-tested benefit and priority on vocational training courses. A new boost was also given to research into family problems including an interest in the effects of changing family structures, of women’s employment and the impact of local social policies on family life. In addition, while a law on equal opportunities in employment was passed in July 1983 which prohibited all forms of unequal treatment regardless of the circumstances, together with providing for <b>positive</b> <b>action</b> plans to be established in major companies. In January 1984, a decree was made granting state aid to companies which implemented equality plans for staff.

The court also issued numerous opinions, including that the accident was caused by [...] "a series and combination of individual negligence(s) onboard Greeneville," [...] "artificial urgency" [...] by Waddle to rush the submarine through its demonstration schedule as it began to run late, failure to follow standard procedures, the abbreviated periscope search, distractions and obstruction caused by the presence of the civilian guests, crew training deficiencies, overconfidence and complacency, and Waddle's not paying enough attention to ship contact information. [...] The court found that, although Brandhuber was the senior officer present on Greeneville, Waddle as captain was solely responsible for the safe navigation of the submarine. [...] The inquiry report went into great detail on the purpose and rules surrounding the USN's DVE program.|$|E

40|$|Behavior is a {{sequence}} of actions.   Premackian conditioning occurs when one of those actions permits an animal to engage in more biologically potent positive responses—reinforcement—or forces them to engage in less positive (or negative) responses —punishment.   Signals of the transition from one class of actions to another focus the instrumental responses in the first class and inform the contingent responses in the second class.   The signals may be innate (USs) or learned (sign-learning); excitatory (leading to more <b>positive</b> <b>actions)</b> or inhibitory (leading to less <b>positive</b> <b>actions).</b>   The potency of an action has phylogenetic origins, but may be conditioned by proximity to more potent responses, such as consummation of a reinforcer.   With practice instrumental responses may take on increased strength, {{and in some cases}} become motivationally autonomous—become habits.   Stimuli or responses that signal the availability of more <b>positive</b> <b>actions</b> may become incentive motivators that animals will approach.   Discriminative stimuli do not have intrinsic value as reinforcers, but only the value derived from the responses that they release.   These forces bend an animal’s trajectory through its stimulus-action-time context into a path that leads more directly to <b>positive</b> <b>actions.</b>   The association of actions (conditioned responses, operants, and observing responses) with actions of different potency (ultimately unconditioned responses or consummatory behavior) is the primary association in Premackian conditioning.   All other types of conditioning may be interpreted as instances of such Premackian conditioning...|$|R

500|$|Section 7 {{creates the}} [...] "broad and {{innovatory}} offence" [...] {{of the failure}} of commercial organisations to prevent bribery on their behalf. This applies to all commercial organisations which have business in the UK. Unlike corporate manslaughter, this does not only apply to the organisation itself; individuals and employees may also be found guilty. The offence is one of strict liability, with no need to prove any kind of intention or <b>positive</b> <b>action.</b> It is also one of vicarious liability; a commercial organisation can be guilty of the offence if the bribery is carried out by an employee, an agent, a subsidiary, or another third-party, as found in Section 8. The location of the third-party is irrelevant to the prosecution— according to David Aaronberg and Nichola Higgins in the Archbold Review, [...] "therefore, a German business with retail outlets in the UK which pays a bribe in Spain could, in theory at least, face prosecution in the UK". Under Section 7(2), the commercial organisation has a defence if it can show that, while bribery did take place, the commercial organisation had in place [...] "adequate procedures designed to prevent persons associated with [...] from undertaking such conduct". Under the Act's explanatory notes, the burden of proof in this situation is on the organisation, with the standard of proof being [...] "on the balance of probabilities".|$|E
