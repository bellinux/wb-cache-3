2500|$|His {{willingness}} {{to experiment with}} the Moog led to unexpected results, such as the time he stumbled into the signature sound for [...] "Hoedown", one of ELP's most popular tunes. He later said, [...] "We'd started working on that arrangement and then I hit, I don't know what, I switched a blue button and I put a <b>patch</b> <b>cord</b> in there, but anyway 'whoooeee.'" ...|$|E
2500|$|Regular {{electronic}} tuners contain {{either an}} input jack for electric instruments (usually a 1/4" [...] <b>patch</b> <b>cord</b> input), a microphone, or a clip-on sensor (e.g., a piezoelectric pickup) {{or some combination}} of these inputs. [...] Pitch detection circuitry drives some type of display (an analog needle, an LCD simulated image of a needle, LED lights, or a spinning translucent disk illuminated by a strobing backlight). Some tuners have an output, or through-put, so the tuner can connect 'in-line' from an electric instrument to an instrument amplifier or mixing console. Small tuners are usually battery powered. Many battery powered tuners also have a jack for an optional AC power supply.|$|E
2500|$|Guitar {{amplifiers}} {{can also}} modify the instrument's tone by emphasizing or de-emphasizing certain frequencies, using equalizer controls, which function {{the same way}} as the bass and treble knobs on a home hi-fi stereo, and by adding electronic effects; [...] distortion (also called [...] "overdrive") and reverb are commonly available as built-in features. The input of modern guitar amplifiers is a 1/4" [...] jack, which is fed a signal from an electro-magnetic pickup (from an electric guitar) or a piezoelectric pickup (usually from an acoustic guitar) using a <b>patch</b> <b>cord,</b> or a wireless transmitter. For electric guitar players, their choice of guitar amp and the settings they use on the amplifier are a key part of their signature tone or sound. Some guitar players are longtime users of a specific amp brand or model. Many electric guitar players use external effects pedals to alter the sound of their tone before the signal reaches the guitar amp, such as the wah wah pedal and the chorus pedal.|$|E

50|$|The {{birth of}} {{progressive}} rock roughly {{coincided with the}} commercial availability of synthesizers. Early modular synthesizers were large instruments that used <b>patch</b> <b>cords</b> to route the signal flow. Programming the instruments meant placing the <b>patch</b> <b>cords</b> to connect the individual modules. The Minimoog, a smaller, simplified synthesizer that needed no <b>patch</b> <b>cords,</b> began production in 1971 and provided keyboardists with a more-easily programmed instrument that could imitate other instruments, could create new sounds of its own, and was highly portable and affordable. Progressive rock was the genre in which the synthesizer first became established as a common part of popular music. Synthesizers {{could be used to}} play the rapid, virtuosic lines that changed the perception of keyboard instruments.|$|R
50|$|<b>Patch</b> <b>cords</b> are {{classified}} by transmission medium (long or short distance), by connector construction and by {{construction of the}} connector's inserted core cover.|$|R
50|$|To {{ensure that}} {{specifications}} are met over FDDI-grade, OM1 and OM2 fibers, the transmitter should be coupled through a mode conditioning <b>patch</b> <b>cord.</b> No mode conditioning <b>patch</b> <b>cord</b> {{is required for}} applications over OM3 or OM4.|$|E
50|$|Armored {{fiber optic}} <b>patch</b> <b>cord</b> uses {{flexible}} {{stainless steel tube}} inside the outer jacket as the armor to protect the fiber glass inside. It retains all the features of standard <b>patch</b> <b>cord,</b> but is much stronger. It will not get damaged even if stepped by an adult and they are rodent-resistant.|$|E
50|$|<b>Patch</b> <b>cord</b> cable {{differs from}} {{standard}} structured cabling cable in that patch cable is stranded for flexibility, whereas standard cable is solid copper. Because the <b>patch</b> <b>cord</b> is stranded copper construction the attenuation (signal loss) is higher on patch cords than solid cable so short lengths should be adhered to.|$|E
50|$|Instead {{of using}} {{expensive}} {{shielded twisted pair}} wiring as in Apple's LocalTalk implementation, PhoneNet uses standard four-conductor telephone (Category 1) <b>patch</b> <b>cords</b> and modular connectors.|$|R
50|$|A {{patch cable}} is an {{electrical}} or optical cable used to connect one electronic or optical device to another or to building infrastructure for signal routing. Devices {{of different types}} (e.g. a switch connected to a computer, or a switch connected to a router) are connected with <b>patch</b> <b>cords.</b> <b>Patch</b> <b>cords</b> are usually produced in many different colors {{so as to be}} easily distinguishable, and most are relatively short, no longer than a few meters. In contrast to on-premises wiring, patch cables are more flexible but may also be less durable.|$|R
50|$|FTTO is {{a hybrid}} network {{involving}} fibre optic cabling (pre-terminated or extractable cables) and copper twisted pair <b>patch</b> <b>cords</b> with 8P8C connectors. In an FTTO environment, fibre is laid up vertically {{from the central}} distribution switch right to the office floor, where it runs horizontally to active FTTO switches at the users' workplaces. The final distance of 3-5 m to the end user desk is bridged using standard 8P8C twisted pair <b>patch</b> <b>cords.</b> There are only two network levels: the core and the access with no aggregation or distribution level in between compared to traditional structured cabling networks.|$|R
5000|$|It is {{conventional}} to {{have the}} top row of jacks wired at the rear to outputs and bottom row of jacks wired to inputs. Patch bays may be half-normal (usually bottom) or full-normal, [...] "normal" [...] indicating that {{the top and bottom}} jacks are connected internally. When a patch bay has bottom half-normal wiring, then with no <b>patch</b> <b>cord</b> inserted into either jack, the top jack is internally linked to the bottom jack via break contacts on the bottom jack; inserting a <b>patch</b> <b>cord</b> into the top jack will take a feed off that jack while retaining the internal link between the two jacks; inserting a <b>patch</b> <b>cord</b> into the bottom jack will break the internal link and replace the signal feed from the top jack with the signal carried on the <b>patch</b> <b>cord.</b> With top half-normal wiring, the same happens but vice versa. If a patch bay is wired to full-normal, then it includes break contacts in both rows of jacks.|$|E
50|$|Bend {{insensitive}} fiber <b>patch</b> <b>cord</b> {{is widely}} used in FTTH. The fiber is not sensitive to stress and bending. Singlemode bend insensitive fibers include G657A1, G657A2, G657B2, and G657B3.|$|E
50|$|For MMF {{links the}} WDM output {{needs to be}} coupled through a SMF offset-launch mode-conditioning <b>patch</b> <b>cord.</b> This is {{explained}} in subclauses 53.6 and 38.11.4 of the IEEE 802.3 spec.|$|E
50|$|Matrix systems use pin matrixes {{or other}} {{crosspoint}} switches rather than <b>patch</b> <b>cords.</b> Historic examples with pin matrixes include the EMS Synthi 100, EMS VCS-3, ETI International 4600, Maplin 5600. The ARP 2500 used a matrix switch.|$|R
50|$|The use of {{flexible}} cords with plugs at their ends and sockets (jacks) to make temporary connections {{dates back to}} cord-type manually operated telephone switchboards (if not even earlier, possibly for telegraph circuits). Cords with plugs at both ends had been used for many decades {{before the advent of}} Moog's synthesizers to make temporary connections (patches) in such places as radio and recording studios. These became known as <b>patch</b> <b>cords,</b> and that term was also used for Moog modular systems. As familiarity developed, a given setup of the synthesizer (both cord connections and knob settings) came to be referred to as a patch, and the term has persisted, applying to systems that do not use <b>patch</b> <b>cords.</b>|$|R
5000|$|A {{variety of}} cables {{are used to}} carry {{electrical}} signals in sound recording studios and with electronic or electrical musical instruments. Microphones are typically connected to mixing boards or PA systems with XLR microphone cables which use three-pin XLR connectors. A huge range of electric or electronic instruments use 1/4 inch mono <b>patch</b> <b>cords</b> to connect the instrument to the amplifier, such as the electric guitar, electric bass, synthesizer, electric piano, or electronic drum machine. Musicians playing electric or electronic instruments often use longer cables (from 10 to 20 feet) between their instrument and their amplifier, and then use shorter <b>patch</b> <b>cords</b> (from a few inches {{to one or two}} feet long) to connect chains of effects devices, [...] "stomp box" [...] pedals, or other signal processors.|$|R
50|$|Mode Conditioning <b>Patch</b> <b>Cord</b> is {{required}} where Gigabit 1000 Base-LX and 10GBASE-LRM routers and switches are installed into existing multimode cable plants. The transceiver modules launch only singlemode 1300 nm signals but the existing network is built with multimode cables.|$|E
5000|$|Shortly after Mickey, Worlds of Wonder {{created an}} {{animated}} Goofy to sit aside Mickey. Goofy {{used the same}} cassettes, but also {{the use of a}} double-ended audio <b>patch</b> <b>cord</b> and 4 [...] "C" [...] Batteries to function with Mickey. Goofy was not made to function alone.|$|E
5000|$|A {{fiber optic}} <b>patch</b> <b>cord</b> is a {{fiber optic cable}} capped at either end with {{connectors}} that {{allow it to be}} rapidly and conveniently connected to CATV, an optical switch or other telecommunication equipment. Its thick layer of protection is used to connect the optical transmitter, receiver, and the terminal box. This is known as [...] "interconnect-style cabling".|$|E
40|$|In vivo optogenetic {{experiments}} commonly employ long {{lengths of}} optical fiber {{to connect the}} light source (commonly a laser) to the optical fiber implants in the brain. Commercially available <b>patch</b> <b>cords</b> are expensive and break easily. Researchers have developed methods to build these cables in house for in vivo experiments with rodents [1 – 4]. However, the half-life of those <b>patch</b> <b>cords</b> is greatly reduced when they are used with behaving rats, which {{are strong enough to}} break the delicate cable tip and to bite through the optical fiber and furcation tubing. Based on [3] we have strengthened the patch-cord tip that connects to the optical implant, and we have incorporated multiple layers of shielding to produce more robust and resistant cladding. Here, we illustrate how to build these <b>patch</b> <b>cords</b> with FC or M 3 connectors. However, the design can be adapted for use with other common optical-fiber connectors. We have saved time and money by using this design in our optical self-stimulation experiments with rats, which are commonly several months long and last four to eleven hours per session. The main advantages are: • Long half-life. • Resistant to moderate rodent bites. • Suitable for long in vivo optogenetic experiments with large rodents...|$|R
50|$|A modular {{synthesizer}} has a case or frame {{into which}} arbitrary modules can be fitted; modules are usually connected together using <b>patch</b> <b>cords</b> {{and a system}} may include modules from different sources, {{as long as it}} fits the form factors of the case and uses the same electrical specifications.|$|R
5000|$|Category 8 was {{ratified}} by the TR43 working group under ANSI/TIA 568-C.2-1. It is defined up 2000 MHz and only for distances from 30 to 36m depending on the <b>patch</b> <b>cords</b> used. ISO is expected to ratify the equivalent in 2017 or 2018 but will have 2 options: ...|$|R
5000|$|His {{willingness}} {{to experiment with}} the Moog led to unexpected results, such as the time he stumbled into the signature sound for [...] "Hoedown", one of ELP's most popular tunes.

5000|$|A <b>patch</b> <b>cord</b> {{is always}} fitted with {{connectors}} at both ends. A pigtail {{is similar to}} a <b>patch</b> <b>cord</b> and is the informal name given to a cable fitted with a connector at one end and bare wires (or bare fibre) at the other. In the context of copper cabling, these cables are sometimes referred to as blunt patch cords and the non-connectorized end ("the pigtail") is intended to be permanently attached to a component or terminal. Optical fiber pigtails, in contrast to copper pigtails, can be more accurately described as a connector than a cable or cord. A fiber pigtail is a single, short, usually tight-buffered, optical fiber that has an optical connector pre-installed on one end and a length of exposed fiber at the other end. The end of the fiber pigtail is stripped and fusion spliced to a single fiber of a multi-fiber trunk. Splicing of pigtails to each fiber in the trunk [...] "breaks out" [...] the multi-fiber cable into its component fibers for connection to the end equipment.|$|E
50|$|A {{fiber optic}} <b>patch</b> <b>cord</b> is {{constructed}} from a core {{with a high}} refractive index, surrounded by a coating with a low refractive index, that is strengthened by aramid yarns and surrounded by a protective jacket. Transparency of the core permits transmission of optic signals with little loss over great distances. The coating's low refractive index reflects light back into the core, minimizing signal loss. The protective aramid yarns and outer jacket minimizes physical damage to the core and coating.|$|E
50|$|ENIAC {{could be}} {{programmed}} to perform sequences and loops of addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, square-root, input/output functions, and conditional branches. Programming was initially accomplished with <b>patch</b> <b>cords</b> and switches, and reprogramming took days. It was redesigned in 1948 to allow the use of stored programs with some loss in speed.|$|R
5000|$|The Chroma uses an Electronically Reconfigurable System {{which allows}} the VCOs, VCFs and VCAs to be reconfigured, or [...] "patched" [...] like modular synthesizers, but without the <b>patch</b> <b>cords.</b> Instead, the Chroma {{digitally}} stores all of the parameters which determine a sound. Sound programs can also be saved to and loaded from cassette.|$|R
50|$|A plugboard, {{or control}} panel (the term used {{depended}} on the application area), is an array of jacks, or sockets (often called hubs), into which <b>patch</b> <b>cords</b> can be inserted to complete an electrical circuit. Control panels were used to direct the operation of some unit record equipment. Plugboards were used on some s, and some early computers.|$|R
5000|$|Like the {{electric}} guitar, {{the electric}} bass guitar {{is almost always}} connected to an amplifier and a speaker with a <b>patch</b> <b>cord</b> for live performances. Electric bassists use either a [...] "combo" [...] amplifier, which combines an amplifier and a speaker in a single cabinet, or an amplifier and one or more speaker cabinets (typically stacked, with the amplifier sitting on the speaker cabinets, leading to the term [...] "half-stack" [...] for one cabinet setups and [...] "full stack" [...] for two).|$|E
50|$|A {{single-mode}} laser {{launch into}} the center of a multimode fiber can generate multiple signals that confuse the receiver {{at the other end of}} the fiber. These multiple signals, caused by Differential Mode Delay (DMD) effects, limit the system distance lengths for operating Gigabit Ethernet. Mode Conditioning <b>Patch</b> <b>Cord</b> eliminates these multiple signals by aligning the single-mode launch away from the center of a multimode fiber core. This offset launch creates a transmitted signal that is similar to typical multimode light emitting diode (LED) launches.|$|E
50|$|NORDX/CDT {{developed}} the GigaBIX IDC-based {{system with a}} transmission performance thatgoes beyond the Category-6 standard and is available in two topologies: the <b>Patch</b> <b>Cord</b> topology and the Cross-Connect Wire topology. It {{is based on the}} mature BIX technology, which is over 25 years old and well-established in the telecommunications industry. The termination and installation procedures have been improved, allowing the quality of the system to surpass Category-6. The system guarantees channel bandwidths up to 300 MHz, and can transmit data up to 4.8 Gbit/s.|$|E
50|$|<b>Patch</b> <b>cords</b> {{are often}} made of coaxial cables, with the signal carried through a {{shielded}} core, and the electrical ground or earthed return connection carried through a wire mesh surrounding the core. Each {{end of the}} cable {{is attached to a}} connector so that the cord may be plugged in. Connector types may vary widely, particularly with adapting cables.|$|R
50|$|Two years later, fellow {{engineer}} Walt Lehnert joined Allison, {{and together}} they diversified the company's product line to include amplifiers and transformers for the broadcast industry. By 1942, the company had designed a sophisticated audio system for the University of Minnesota, and the resulting jacks, plugs, <b>patch</b> <b>cords</b> and jackfields became the cornerstones for ADC's later entry into telecommunications.|$|R
5000|$|FTTO (fiber-to-the-office): Fiber {{connection}} is installed {{from the main}} computer room/core switch to a special mini-switch (called FTTO Switch) located at the user´s workstation or service points. This mini-switch provides Ethernet services to end user devices via standard twisted pair <b>patch</b> <b>cords.</b> The switches are located decentrally all over the building, but managed from one central point.|$|R
