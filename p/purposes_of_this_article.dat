25|$|Since the 1960s, {{improving}} {{the efficiency of}} foreign aid has been a common topic of academic research. There is debate on whether foreign aid is efficacious, but for the <b>purposes</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>article</b> we will ignore that. Given that schema, a common debate is over which factors influence the overall economic efficiency of foreign aid. Indeed, there is debate about whether aid impact should be measured empirically at all, but again, we will limit our scope to increasing the economic efficiency.|$|E

25|$|Southern Television's logo is {{sometimes}} {{said to be}} a compass, what with the directional station name {{and the fact that the}} bottom point on the logo is longest – thereby suggesting a compass pointing south, in the direction of Southern Television's service area. However, the general consensus is that it is a star, named after the Southern Star and because Southern Television's final transmission showed the logo zooming off into the night sky. For the <b>purposes</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>article,</b> the logo will be referred to as a star, to reflect what it is most popularly called.|$|E
25|$|Scottish legal {{institutions}} in the High Middle Ages are, for the <b>purposes</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>article,</b> the informal and formal systems which governed and helped to manage Scottish society between the years 900 and 1288, a period roughly corresponding with the general European era usually called the High Middle Ages. Scottish society in this period was predominantly Gaelic. Early Gaelic law tracts, first written down in the ninth century reveal a society highly concerned with kinship, status, honour and the regulation of blood feuds. The early Scottish lawman, or Breitheamh, became the Latin Judex; the great Breitheamh became the magnus Judex, which arguably developed into the office of Justiciar, an office which survives to this day in that of Lord Justice General. Scottish common law {{began to take shape}} {{at the end of the}} period, assimilating Gaelic and Celtic law with practices from Anglo-Norman England and the Continent.|$|E

500|$|In the {{broadest}} circumscription, Insecta sensu lato consists of all hexapods. Traditionally, insects defined {{in this way}} were divided into [...] "Apterygota" [...] (the first five groups in the table) – the wingless insects – and Pterygota – the winged insects. However, modern phylogenetic {{studies have shown that}} [...] "Apterygota" [...] is not monophyletic, and so does not form a good taxon. A narrower circumscription restricts insects to those hexapods with external mouthparts, and comprises only the last three groups in the table. In this sense, Insecta sensu stricto is equivalent to Ectognatha. In the narrowest circumscription, insects are restricted to hexapods that are either winged or descended from winged ancestors. Insecta sensu strictissimo is then equivalent to Pterygota. For the <b>purposes</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>article,</b> the middle definition is used; insects consist of two wingless taxa, Archaeognatha (jumping bristletails) and Zygentoma (silverfish), plus the winged or secondarily wingless Pterygota.|$|E

2500|$|Otomi has {{traditionally}} {{been described as a}} single language, although its many dialects are not all mutually intelligible. SIL International's Ethnologue considers there to be nine separate Otomi languages, based on needs for literature and the degree of mutual intelligibility between varieties, and it assigns an ISO code to each of these nine. [...] INALI, the Mexican National Institute of Indigenous Languages, avoids the problem of assigning dialect or language status to Otomian varieties by defining [...] "Otomi" [...] as a [...] "linguistic group" [...] with nine different [...] "linguistic varieties", but for official purposes each variety is considered a separate language. Other linguists, however, consider Otomi to be a dialect continuum that is clearly demarcated from its closest relative, Mazahua.

2500|$|The {{mechanism}} for blackout on ascent differs from hyperventilation induced hypocapnia expedited blackouts {{and does not}} necessarily follow hyperventilation. However, hyperventilation will exacerbate the risk {{and there is no}} clear line between them. Shallow water blackouts can happen in extremely shallow water, even on dry land following hyperventilation and apnoea but the effect becomes much more dangerous in the ascent stage of a deep freedive. There is considerable confusion surrounding the terms shallow and deep water blackout and they have been used to refer to different things, or be used interchangeably, in different water sports circles. For example, the term shallow water blackout has been used to describe blackout on ascent because the blackout usually occurs when the diver ascends to a shallow depth. For the <b>purposes</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>article</b> there are two separate phenomena Shallow water blackout and Blackout on ascent as follows: ...|$|E
