40|$|Engineers now {{routinely}} use planning {{tools to}} prepare and document master plans for construction. However, the tools do not evaluate how easy or difficult the <b>plans</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>to</b> perform, i. e., their manageability. Furthermore, engineers can not carefully evaluate plan manageability because of time and resource limitations during the pre-construction designing and planning stages. Thus, construction managers often encounter unanticipated problems during the construction and start up period. Such problems might be avoided by changes in the design, building methods or construction plans. The Construction Manageability Planning System (CMy Planner) builds a master plan and schedule that explicitly represents the manageability of planned construction methods, schedules and resource utilization. The system simulates project execution and identifies potential risk factors in the plan and schedules, then predicts construction manageability {{in order to help}} project managers. This paper also discusses the results of predicting some aspects of a test case construction project. Low management influences in a given time span appears to cause later how manageability. Furthermore, the number of problems decreases after periods of high management influence. We infer that the project status at any time depends on a balance between the severity of the problems and the influence of management. Research suggests that computer tools can give early insight into management risks associated with a given master plan. Future project managers can use extensions of these computer tools to identify design, construction methods and planning assumptions that may lead to manageability problems. ...|$|E

25|$|Gateshead 51's remains <b>were</b> {{transferred}} <b>to</b> Beamish in 2006 {{where the}} eventual <b>plan</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>to</b> restore it as a fully enclosed single-decker. Although known <b>to</b> have <b>been</b> No. 51 on withdrawal, its prior history is unclear.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{think that}} the only <b>plan</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>to</b> hide up {{for a couple of}} days, or so; then to make our way down again to where the horses are, and then make a dash through Parton." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No, Tony, I shall {{certainly}} not do that. We will either get off or be taken together. Well, I {{think the best}} <b>plan</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>to</b> go straight down to the river. How far is it away?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{think the}} best <b>plan</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>to</b> lead our horses, Mike, across this country. It would seem natural to do so, and once through them, we could then gallop round and join the troops on the plateau." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Then I think, Dias, {{that our}} best <b>plan</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>to</b> go down {{again into the}} valley we left {{yesterday}} morning, and then strike across for the mouth of this pass you speak of. You know the direction?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "We both {{think that}} it <b>will</b> <b>be</b> {{impossible}} for us to travel north either to Egypt, or to Berber and thence <b>to</b> Suakim. They <b>will</b> <b>be</b> on the watch for us everywhere. Our best <b>plan</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>to</b> make for Massowah." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{have been}} {{thinking}} it over, as we came. I think that our best <b>plan</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>to</b> go on to Johore. Doubtless the road down the coast <b>will</b> <b>be</b> watched. How far from Johore {{do you think we}} are?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "The best <b>plan</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>to</b> put a {{knife into}} his heart {{at once the}} minute you have got the order signed," [...] Victor said savagely; [...] "I should have no more {{hesitation}} in killing him than stamping on a snake." ...|$|R
60|$|Certainly, vicar. If {{peace of}} mind be the summum bonum, and {{religion}} is merely the science of self-satisfaction, they are right; and your wisest <b>plan</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>to</b> follow them at once, or failing that, {{to apply to the}} next best substitute that can be discovered-- alcohol and opium.|$|R

6000|$|... "I {{really like}} the idea, very much. The best <b>plan</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>to</b> pick out two or three score of men who are shoemakers by trade, and pay them a trifle for the making of each pair. In that way we could get much greater {{uniformity}} than <b>were</b> each man <b>to</b> make his own.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{suppose you}} know that he {{is the head of the}} firm of Cox, Tuke, and Atkinson, in Coleman Street. I suggest that the best <b>plan</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>to</b> see him to-morrow, and to make an {{appointment}} with him for you to inspect the mortgage. You would wish me, of course, <b>to</b> <b>be</b> with you when you do so?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'It is now {{a quarter}} to seven o'clock,' said Mountclere; 'and the {{question}} arises, shall I go on to Knollsea, or branch off at Corvsgate Castle for Enckworth? I think the best <b>plan</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>to</b> drive first to Enckworth, set me down, and then get him to take you on at once to Knollsea. What do you say?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I know no {{more than}} you do, Angus. I {{do not know whether}} the king has gifted my mother's estate to others, as assuredly he has done my father's lands. If he has, I have been {{thinking}} that the best <b>plan</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>to</b> ask the king's permission to leave the kingdom and return to your native Scotland." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "We are {{scattered}} over a considerable extent of country," [...] he said; [...] "and the colonel, alone, {{could tell you}} how we are all placed. I expect that he <b>will</b> <b>be</b> here, tonight; and your best <b>plan</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>to</b> stay here, till he comes. We have not much to offer you, but such as it is, it is at your service." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Either with chassepots, or {{with your}} English rifles. It {{is of no}} use {{applying}} to Government. They <b>will</b> not <b>be</b> able <b>to</b> arm the Mobiles, for months; {{to say nothing of}} the national guard. We must buy the rifles in England, or Belgium. It <b>will</b> <b>be</b> difficult <b>to</b> get chassepots; so I think the best <b>plan</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>to</b> decide, at once, upon your Sniders." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "The first difficulty, then, <b>is</b> <b>to</b> procure {{sufficient}} provisions. The next <b>is</b> <b>to</b> {{make our}} escape unseen. The four natives who, night and day, watch {{at the corners}} of this shed, mean it as a great honor, no doubt; but, like many other honors, it is an unpleasant one. Our only <b>plan</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>to</b> seize and gag them suddenly, each pouncing upon one.|$|R
6000|$|Simcoe made no answer; he {{knew that}} it was so, and could hardly hope that there would be an {{exception}} in their case. After thinking for a minute he said, [...] "Well, Bill, in that case I think the safest <b>plan</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>to</b> take to the canoe at once. We can stay away a few weeks and then come back here and see how matters stand." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That is true," [...] said Glinda the Good. [...] "And {{as these}} people are Ozma's subjects, I think she would refuse to escape with Dorothy and leave the others behind, or to abandon the island which is the lawful home of the Skeezers. I believe the best <b>plan</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>to</b> summon the three fishes and learn from them how to raise the island." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Our best <b>plan</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>to</b> {{leave it}} alone till morning. If we sit outside the hut, and take it in turns to watch, we shall hear him when he moves, which he <b>is</b> sure <b>to</b> do when it gets dark. It <b>will</b> <b>be</b> a still night, and we should hear a stick break half a mile away. We shall catch him, safe enough, before he has gone far." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'These {{two gentlemen}} have ordered supper in an hour's time,' she said, taking {{her into the}} bar; 'and your best <b>plan</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>to</b> sup with them. Meanwhile you shall have a little taste of {{something}} that'll do you good, for I'm sure you must want it after all you've gone through to-day. Now, don't look after the old gentleman, because when you've drank that, he shall have some too.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Down with it, then, {{and hang}} Mrs. Charmond," [...] said Mr. Fitzpiers. [...] "The best <b>plan</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>to</b> {{wait till the}} evening, when it is dark, or {{early in the morning}} before he is awake, so that he doesn't see it fall, for that would terrify him worse than ever. Keep the blind down till I come, and then I'll assure him, and show him that his trouble is over." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "If {{we go to}} the {{mountain}}," [...] {{said the}} Wizard, [...] "we may get into trouble with that wicked Su-dic, and then we would be delayed in rescuing Ozma and Dorothy. So I think our best <b>plan</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>to</b> go to the Skeezer Country, raise the sunken island and save our friends and the imprisoned Skeezers. Afterward we can visit the mountain and punish the cruel magician of the Flatheads." ...|$|R
6000|$|... “Capital, Joyce! That is {{just the}} thing. There is flint and steel, and a tinder-box in the locker, and our best <b>plan</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>to</b> make a fire and heat that pricker of yours red-hot. It would make the work a great deal easier, and there <b>will</b> <b>be</b> less risk of {{breaking}} it or of splitting the wood. So now we will collect dry wood and creepers and leave the thorns alone.” ...|$|R
50|$|Domestically {{produced}} {{nuclear power}} accounted for 53% {{of the electricity}} consumption in Belgium, in 2009. This is among the highest nuclear dependencies in the Europe. Less than France(79%) but more than Switzerland(40%) and Sweden(35-40%). The current <b>plan</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>to</b> phase out nuclear power by 2025. Several scenario's exist on how this phase-out can occur. Depending on how this will occur, more or less greenhouse gases may <b>be</b> emitted compared <b>to</b> the current situation.|$|R

I dare say fellows who {{understood}} a boat well could manage it but, if we hold on like this, we shall end by drowning ourselves. I think the best <b>plan</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>to</b> lower the sail and mast, and row straight to shore." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "No, I don't {{see why you}} should, Carey," [...] {{the doctor}} said; [...] "the best <b>plan</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>to</b> keep away from the ladder for the present. Perhaps, when he thinks you <b>are</b> not going <b>to</b> make the attempt, he will move away, {{and then we can}} get up there before he sees us. I will go first because he knows me, and my {{influence}} may quiet him, but we had better arm ourselves with sticks so as to knock that knife out of his hand." ...|$|R
25|$|The <b>plan</b> <b>will</b> not <b>be</b> able <b>to</b> pay {{benefits}} when due.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{have been}} {{thinking}} it over, Moore," [...] he said; [...] "and {{it seems to me}} the best <b>plan</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>to</b> allow you to go quietly away. Your conduct in the fight in the cave in itself showed that you were not voluntarily with the others; and I do not think, therefore, that it <b>is</b> necessary <b>to</b> report you among the prisoners. I suppose the Red Captain's gang have not done any unlawful act beyond taking part in the still business since they took you away from home?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No {{wonder they}} work well {{when they can}} put away such {{a lot of food}} as that," [...] Bob Grimstone said, after {{watching}} them for some time in silent astonishment. [...] "Bill and me was always considered as being pretty good feeders, but one of these chaps would eat twice as much as the two of us. I should say, Mr. Wilfrid, that in future your best <b>plan</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>to</b> let these chaps board themselves. Why, it would <b>be</b> dear <b>to</b> have them without pay if you had to feed them!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No. It {{is no good}} {{doing that}} until we have quite decided what we <b>are</b> going <b>to</b> do. The wedges {{certainly}} won't go into this crack. I think our best <b>plan</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>to</b> sink a bore-hole about two inches from the crack. We will drive it in in a slanting direction towards the edge, {{and in that way}} it will have more chance of blowing a piece out. First of all, we must make a slight indentation with a pick, otherwise we sha'n't get the bore to work. I will begin." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No doubt, madam, no doubt. All I can say is, if his {{recommendations}} {{are not the}} same as mine, he must be a downright fool. Very well, Miss Hannay, I think we understand each other; I shall be on board by eleven o'clock, and shall keep a sharp lookout for you. Don't be later than twelve; she will warp out of the dock by one at latest, and if you miss that your only <b>plan</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>to</b> take the train down to Tilbury, and hire a boat there." ...|$|R
