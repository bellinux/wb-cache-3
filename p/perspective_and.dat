5|$|Although not all Conservapedia {{contributors}} {{subscribe to}} a young-earth creationist point of view—former administrator Terry Koeckritz stated to the Los Angeles Times {{that he did not}} take the Genesis creation account literally—sources have attributed the poor science coverage to an overall editorial support of the young-earth creationist <b>perspective</b> <b>and</b> an over-reliance on Christian creationist home-schooling textbooks. In an analysis in early 2007, science writer Carl Zimmer found evidence that much of what appeared to be inaccurate or inadequate information about science and scientific theory could be traced back to an over-reliance on citations from the works of home-schooling textbook author Jay L. Wile.|$|E

Some of Sterling's features could be directly customized by the player, although Armada of the Damned was centered on a choice system that would affect the character's appearance, personality, weapons, attacks, quests, and story developments.|$|E

5|$|In Brussels, Rodin {{created his}} first {{full-scale}} work, The Age of Bronze, having returned from Italy. Modeled after a Belgian soldier, the figure {{drew inspiration from}} Michelangelo's Dying Slave, which Rodin had observed at the Louvre. Attempting to combine Michelangelo's mastery of the human form with his own sense of human nature, Rodin studied his model from all angles, at rest and in motion; he mounted a ladder for additional <b>perspective,</b> <b>and</b> made clay models, which he studied by candlelight. The result was a life-size, well-proportioned nude figure, posed unconventionally {{with his right hand}} atop his head, and his left arm held out at his side, forearm parallel to the body.|$|E

5|$|In the marginalia that El Greco {{inscribed in}} his copy of Daniele Barbaro's {{translation}} of Vitruvius' , he refuted Vitruvius' attachment to archaeological remains, canonical proportions, <b>perspective</b> <b>and</b> mathematics. He also saw Vitruvius' manner of distorting proportions {{in order to}} compensate for distance from the eye as responsible for creating monstrous forms. El Greco was averse to {{the very idea of}} rules in architecture; he believed above all in the freedom of invention and defended novelty, variety, and complexity. These ideas were, however, far too extreme for the architectural circles of his era and had no immediate resonance.|$|E
5|$|Leonardo's {{youth was}} spent in a Florence that was ornamented by the works of these artists and by Donatello's contemporaries, Masaccio, whose figurative frescoes were imbued with realism and emotion, and Ghiberti, whose Gates of Paradise, gleaming with gold leaf, {{displayed}} the art of combining complex figure compositions with detailed architectural backgrounds. Piero della Francesca had made a detailed study of <b>perspective,</b> <b>and</b> was the first painter to make a scientific study of light.
