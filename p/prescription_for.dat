5|$|The exact {{meaning of}} Keynes's {{work has been}} long debated. Even the {{interpretation}} of Keynes's policy <b>prescription</b> <b>for</b> unemployment, {{one of the more}} explicit parts of General Theory, {{has been the subject of}} debates. Economists and scholars debate whether Keynes intended his advice to be a major policy shift to address a serious problem or a moderately conservative solution to deal with a minor issue.|$|E
5|$|Approximately {{two weeks}} later on March 19, 2007, Sports Illustrated posted on its website another article in its {{continuing}} series investigating a steroid and HGH ring used {{by a number of}} professional athletes in several sports. That article mentioned that ten other professional wrestlers were implicated to have received performance-enhancing drugs from the same drug ring, including four WWE wrestlers and Eddie Guerrero. Angle never failed a drug test for pain pills, but he did fail a steroid test under WWE's Wellness Policy because his <b>prescription</b> <b>for</b> nandrolone had expired.|$|E
5|$|Keynes's <b>prescription</b> <b>for</b> strong public {{investment}} had ties to {{his interest in}} uncertainty. Keynes had given a unique perspective on statistical inference in A Treatise on Probability, written in 1921, years before his major economic works. Keynes thought strong {{public investment}} and fiscal policy would counter the negative impacts the uncertainty of economic fluctuations can have on the economy. While Keynes's successors {{paid little attention to}} the probabilistic parts of his work, uncertainty may have played a central part in the investment and liquidity-preference aspects of General Theory.|$|E

Another album of jazz duets based on Undertales songs, <b>Prescription</b> <b>for</b> Sleep, was performed and released in 2016 by saxophonist Norihiko Hibino and pianist Ayaki Sato. iam8bit is producing a vinyl edition of the Undertale soundtrack across two discs, expected to be available in Q4 2016.|$|E
5|$|Despite these efforts, on 21February {{it became}} clear just how {{fundamentally}} opposed the groups were. Philip Nye, one of the dissenting brethren, asserted in a speech that a presbytery set over local congregations would become as powerful as the state and was dangerous to the commonwealth, provoking vigorous opposition from presbyterians. The next day, the Assembly finally began to establish a <b>prescription</b> <b>for</b> presbyterian government. Owing to a strong belief in {{the unity of the}} church, the Assembly continued to try to find ways to reconcile the dissenting brethren with the majority throughout 1644, including the establishment of a special committee for that purpose in March. However, on 15November, the dissenting brethren presented their reasons for disagreement {{with the rest of the}} Assembly to Parliament, and on 11December the majority submitted a draft of a presbyterian form of government.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, a {{young woman}} named Peggy Olson (Elisabeth Moss) begins a new career at Sterling Cooper as Don's secretary. She is excited {{to be working in}} Manhattan, but finds herself {{overwhelmed}} by her new surroundings. The office manager, Joan Holloway (Christina Hendricks), a voluptuously beautiful and capable woman, proves more intimidating than helpful as she gives advice on how to be appealing to the men of the office and how that will lead to both success in the office and a good marriage. Peggy is dismayed to find a secretary in the bathroom crying. A junior account executive named Pete Campbell (Vincent Kartheiser) makes boorish comments about Peggy's appearance and clothing, causing Don to rebuke him. On her break, Peggy goes to the office of a doctor recommended by the all-knowing Joan, where she gets a <b>prescription</b> <b>for</b> the recently introduced birth control pill, which at the time was not supposed to be prescribed to unmarried women or married women without their husband's consent. Later in the day, Peggy makes a subtle, sexually inviting gesture to Don, but he definitively rejects her advances.|$|E

Kyle and his grandmother, Sheila (Colette Mann), later find Chris {{collapsed in the}} garden and Karl tells Chris to stop taking the sleeping pills. Chris ignores his advice and starts sleepwalking. Chris also has a series of one-night stands and gets two warnings at work from his new boss, Danni Ferguson (Laura McIntosh). Chris is arrested when he punches Josh Willis, who spoke to a journalist about Chris and Hudson's relationship. Kate Ramsay (Ashleigh Brewer) drives Chris to the prison, so he can see Hudson and sort things out. Hudson tells Chris that he cut off contact as he needed time to prepare himself for prison. Chris asks Hudson to give their relationship another go and he agrees. Chris keeps Hudson's incarceration a secret from his parents, so he is angered when Sonya Rebecchi (Eve Morey) inadvertently reveals his secret to his mother, Patricia (Katerina Kotsonis). When Patricia is later arrested for theft, Chris learns that she is a gambling addict and Sonya knew.|$|E
