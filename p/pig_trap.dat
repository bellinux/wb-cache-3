The basic characteristics of this technology is that the water mixes with fly ash and bottom ash in the ratio 1 : 1 and in the form of dense slurry transporting by high pressure pumps and by pipeline to disposal area. Pigging in the maintenance of pipelines refers to the practice of using pipeline inspection gauges or 'pigs ' to perform various operations on a pipeline without stopping the flow of the product in the pipeline. The pipeline is normally segmented into sections, and a <b>pig</b> <b>trap</b> is fitted at the start and end of each section. The <b>pig</b> <b>trap</b> is similar to an air lock or a torpedo launch tube. It is isolated from the pipeline by a valve, so it can be depressurized to load the pig. Once loaded, the trap door is closed and the trap is pressurized. With the main trap valve open, oil or gas flow can be directed behind the pig to push it into the pipeline. The reverse process applies {{at the other end of}} the line, when the pig is received.

40|$|Wild pigs (Sus scrofa) are a non-native, {{invasive}} species that cause {{in excess of}} $ 1. 5 billion of damage annually in the United States. Although lethal removal by trapping is oftentimes the most cost- and time-effective means for managing local wild pig populations, many landowners and natural resource professionals implement additional non-trapping techniques such as opportunistic daytime shooting, night shooting, hunting with dogs, and shooting over bait to further enhance removal rates. However, these non-trapping techniques may significantly alter the behavior of wild pigs and subsequently reduce trapping success. Our objective {{was to provide a}} preliminary assessment of the effects non-trapping techniques on wild <b>pig</b> visitation to <b>traps.</b> During the summer of 2012, we monitored trap visitation of wild pig sounders and boars using game cameras at 26 corral traps on 6 study sites in Alabama. We implemented combinations of non-trapping removal techniques (recreational stalk hunting, night shooting, and shooting of <b>pigs</b> at <b>traps)</b> coupled with increase vehicular (ATV and truck) traffic along property trails (hereafter collectively termed disturbance) for 3 - 5 days on 3 study sites while continually monitoring sounder and boar visitation to traps on all 6 study sites. On each site, we pre-baited traps for ≥ 2 weeks to condition approximately 3 - 4 sounders to visit traps and used game cameras to determine sounder composition. Once sounders became conditioned to visiting traps daily, we recorded the total number of days traps were visited, number of visits per 24 -hour period, and the duration (min) of all visits during a one-week period prior to the implementation of disturbance. Repeated trap visits were segregated by ≥ 1 hour absence of pigs between image recordings and visit duration began when the first pig of a sounder was recorded on camera until after the last pig of the sounder left the trap. After one week of monitoring visitation metrics, we applied disturbance to one of each pair of sites. We classified non-trapping removal techniques as either direct or indirect disturbance. Indirect disturbance was a combination of non-trapping removal techniques that were not knowingly applied directly to wild pigs, such as stalk hunting and the periodic discharge of firearms and cracker shells in the immediate vicinity of traps and increased vehicular traffic. Direct disturbances were applied directly to specific wild pigs, mainly the shooting of non-trapped pigs while they are at a trap which is somewhat of a common practice among novice pig control operators. To simulate this direct disturbance, we set several traps to capture a portion of pigs from a sounder. Once captured, we then released the pigs while discharging several rounds as the <b>pigs</b> exited the <b>trap.</b> After disturbance was implemented, we continued monitoring trap visitation metrics on both sites within each pair of study sites. We used a Before-After-Control-Impact (BACI) design to test for interaction effects among the visitation metrics between treatment and control sites before and after disturbance implementation. We monitored trap visitation of 16 sounders and 8 boars and 10 sounders and 8 boars on treatment and control sites, respectively. Overall, we applied 39 hours of indirect disturbance and 3 hours of direct disturbance (via use of dogs) including the discharge of 112 cracker shells and 63 high-powered rifle rounds on treatment (disturbance) sites. Additionally, we simulated the shooting of <b>pigs</b> while at <b>traps</b> (direct disturbance) on an additional 6 sounders. Total number of days (P= 0. 349) and total number of visits (P= 0. 130) 1 -week before and after disturbance on treatment and control sites were similar; however, total visit duration differed before and after disturbance on treatment and control sites (P= 0. 038), demonstrating a change in pig behavior in response to disturbance. Although we did not detect treatment effects for total days visited and total number of visits, we speculate {{this may be due to}} our relatively small sample sizes coupled with inherent variability in pig response. Moreover, we only applied disturbance for a relatively short period of time (3 - 5 days) with somewhat minimal levels of disturbance. Within the context of one year of data, we suggest non-trapping techniques be implemented cautiously, and strategically, when conducting wild pig removal as these techniques may reduce overall trapping success...|$|R

The food study examined their relative associations with carrion and four different dung types within a single vegetation community. A total of 70 species was recorded.

Forty species analyzed in the food association study showed clear distributional biases to carrion or the dung of elephant (monogastric herbivore), pig (omnivore), cattle and sheep (ruminant herbivores), or pig and cattle.

Surveillance has involved the use of sentinel pigs that develop detectable viremias and antibody titers to JEV. However, pigs are amplifying hosts for JEV, and thus pose a health risk to the public and to pig handlers who bleed the pigs. A remote mosquito trap system would not have these risks. We report on trials using a remote mosquito trap system for the surveillance of JEV in the Torres Strait. The Mosquito Magnet (MM) Pro[R], MM Liberty Plus[R], and a novel updraft trap, the NAQS Mozzie Trap, were run at Badu and Moa islands in the Torres Strait and at Bamaga in the northern Cape York Peninsula from 2002 - 2005. TagMan real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was used to detect JEV nucleic acid in weekly mosquito collections. Sentinel pigs located at Badu were also bled and the serum processed by reverse transcriptase (RT) -PCR for JEV antigen and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for anti-JEV antibodies.

40|$|Background: The {{proportion}} of blood meals that mosquitoes take from a host species {{is a function}} of the interplay of extrinsic (abundance and location of potential hosts) and intrinsic (innate preference) factors. A mark-release-recapture experiment addressed whether host preference in a population of Anopheles farauti was uniform or if there were anthropophilic and zoophilic subpopulations. The corresponding fitness associated with selecting different hosts for blood meals was compared by measuring fecundity. Methods: The attractiveness of humans for blood meals by An. farauti in the Solomon Islands was compared to <b>pigs</b> using tent <b>traps.</b> Host fidelity was assessed by mark-release-recapture experiments in which different colour dusts were linked to the host to which the mosquito was first attracted. Outdoor resting An. farauti were captured on barrier screens and the human blood index (HBI) as well as the feeding index were calculated. The fecundity of individual An. farauti after feeding on either humans or pigs was assessed from blood-fed mosquitoes held in individual oviposition chambers. Results: Anopheles farauti were more attracted to humans than pigs at a ratio of 1. 31 : 1. 00. The mark-release-recapture experiment found evidence for An. farauti being a single population regarding host preference. The HBI of outdoor resting An. farauti was 0. 93 and the feeding index was 1. 29. Anopheles farauti that fed on a human host laid more eggs but had a longer oviposition time compared to An. farauti that had blood fed on a pig. Conclusions: One of the strongest drivers for host species preference was the relative abundance of the different host species. Here, An. farauti have a slight preference for humans over pigs as blood meal sources. However, the limited availability of alternative hosts relative to humans in the Solomon Islands ensures a very high {{proportion of}} blood meals are obtained from humans, and thus, the transmission potential of malaria by An. farauti is high. ...|$|R
40|$|Children, LiteraturePostmodern at Bedtime Ellen Handler Spitz The Three Pigs by David Wiesner Clarion Books, 40 pp., $ 16 Children love stories, and so {{we provide}} them. In the {{contemporary}} West we rely on books, {{but this was not}} always our way: as long ago as 1936, Walter Benjamin’s essay “The Storyteller” lamented the passing of the art of oral narration. The ancient art of oral storytelling endures {{in many parts of the}} globe. In southeast India, for example, I sat on the floor of a Chennai nursery and listened to a story, enthralled. Here, by contrast, we buy or borrow children’s books, or take them out of the attic, and read them to our offspring. In considering a growing trend in American books for children, I find it hard to push aside the question of why children love stories. An outstanding example will serve: a Caldecott Medal-winning picture book The Three Pigs, by David Wiesner. Said to exemplify dramatic changes that are occurring in children’s cultural lives as a result of web technology, Wiesner’s book has been touted for its special appeal to the population of children known as “cyberkids,” “digital youth,” and the “net generation. ” Books addressed to these allegedly postmodern children draw increasingly on hypertext and interactivity. They eschew linear plots, and favor formats that demand participation from individual child readers in various processes of active co-creation. Each book serves as an elaborate set-up for storylines that can vary not only from reader to reader but also from one reading to the next. An early groundbreaking example of this genre was David Macaulay’s Black and White, a picture book in which at least four versions of the same story are simultaneously recounted, but which may be read in any number of ways. Like a child clicking a mouse or tapping a screen, the reader of Black and White is free to move in any direction and thus to construct his or her own narrative. Not surprisingly, Wiesner dedicates his Three Pigs to Macaulay. Are the experiences offered by books of this type dramatically new? To claim as much is to risk a somewhat ahistorical perspective, and to assume that a passive receptive state is the mode with which children approach more traditional books. I am doubtful. John Dewey, Lev Vygotsky, Jean Piaget, and Jerome Bruner, all noted psychologists, have shown persuasively that children invariably construct their worlds, and indeed must do so. Mental construction may seem passive from the outside, because it cannot be directly observed, but it occurs quite actively and passionately. Out of stories and out of life, children make what they need. They select, they re-work, they re-create. We must therefore recognize that in the presence of the great classic picture books—Potter’s Tale of Peter Rabbit (1902), Bemelmans’s Madeline (1939), Sendak’s Where the Wild Things Are (1963) —children become as mentally engaged as they do with any of the post-Internet offerings. On the other hand, something is clearly new, in degree if not in kind; and the phenomenon deserves our serious consideration. More to the point, does it merit an unqualified welcome? The earliest versions of the Three Pigs story are buried in time, although we do have nineteenth-century English renderings of it. I want, as a foil, to consider Disney’s Silly Symphony animation, from 1932, with its refrain, “Who’s afraid of the big bad wolf?,” frequently issued in print form and known worldwide, because it forms, like so much of Disney’s work, an inescapable template. Disney’s pigs are “little,” that is, they are children; whereas Wiesner’s pigs are neither verbally nor pictorially “little. ” On the book jacket, Wiesner’s three porkers zoom in and eye us. We go snout to snout with them, as if looking in a mirror. Disney’s tiny fellows, on the other hand, caper at a distance; they are comical and vulnerable in their sailor suits, except of course for the wise guy in blue working man’s overalls and cap, who, channeling La Fontaine’s La cigale et la fourmi, warns the others against frivolity. The story, as Disney tells it, conforms to Aristotelian aesthetics: from start to finish, the plot conforms to propter hoc, replete with necessity and peripeteia (an unexpected reversal of fortune), as the industrious little pig saves his brethren by turning the tables on the wicked wolf, who flees in howling agony, his bottom scorched in boiling turp. And children feel good; they smile. They have been through fear, trembling, revenge, resolution, catharsis. And all of this in a single, justly famous, work of art. Wiesner draws in several linear styles, each one of which is associated with a different thread of his layered narrative. When the story starts, his art recalls the late Victorian Walter Crane’s illustrations for “This little pig went to market. ” As we read the text set neatly above the imagery, we are lulled into complacency. We are in the story we know. The wolf blows the first house down—but the threatened pig, instead of being eaten or running to his brother’s, simply exits the story altogether! He escapes danger by escaping the story. Imagine waking yourself up in the middle of a scary dream: now you are not in that story any more. The tale winds along until the wolf is about to do his worst, but the second pig steps out of the story, too, and joins the first. When the third pig joins them, they pick up some pages of their former story, fold them into a paper airplane, and defy gravity by flying the plane—a ubiquitous childhood fantasy—until it collapses under their combined weight and they find themselves inside “Hey Diddle Diddle,” where Wiesner now shifts his drawing style yet again to emulate the iconic Randolph Caldecott. Finally, with the cat from Hey Diddle Diddle (Disney uses this reference too in his version) the pigs return to their original story (“Let’s go home”) and end up supping with the added characters inside their house of brick. And Wiesner’s concluding tour-de-force is an image in which the wolf, trying blow down the house of brick, finds that his breath now scatters the very letters of the words of the story, so that its elemental structures come apart and are collected by the visiting dragon in a basket. On his final soup-slurping page, Wiesner writes in type unevenly set aslant: “And they all lived happily ever aft [no closure]. ” The book will intrigue, delight, and puzzle children. (Where did the pig go? What is he standing on? How did the wolf really eat the pig if he goes away? Why does it say so?). Wiesner’s tale turns back on itself to reveal its form, and to show that a story can be protean, metamorphic, and infinitely malleable. We have to co-construct it. Indeed, one of its boons is that, since there is no right way to read it, adults, too, are put to the test intellectually, (Wiesner’s pigs are not just children). The book can be seen as an unexpected lesson in the ethic of storytelling. But has something been lost? Fear, after all, has been drained completely away. By letting the pigs out of the story, Wiesner has pushed us out as well. We have no need for empathy, no real worry any more about their fate, or our own, or about good or evil. When bad comes along here, you simply jump out of your story into another one: Click. Evil is therefore unreal. The pigs get away, but the wolf cannot. He exists only in the story. Unlike the <b>pigs,</b> he is <b>trapped.</b> And this is a deprivation. By eschewing an incantatory mode, by not luring children step by step into a transparent world and holding them spellbound as in a dream, this postmodern tale, artful and ingenious, wakes us up, and provides its own useful challenge to understanding. But there is a cost. The risk with the cyber-genre is that, with all its glitz, we lose the pity and terror which Aristotle extolled and Plato feared. Surely we need not make such a sacrifice. Think of Ovid, after all, with his Orpheus, Icarus, Daphne, and Phaeton: he did not write for children, but he proved forever that you can glide from story to story without losing the quiver, the throb, the core. Whatever the achievements of much new work in the field of children’s books—of David Wiesner’s work in particular—I confess that I am still on the lookout for those rare treasures that can make us tremble mightily like Disney’s giddy piglets under their blanket when the wolf is at the door.
