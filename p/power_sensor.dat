50|$|Thermal sensors can {{generally}} {{be divided into}} two main categories, thermocouple <b>power</b> <b>sensors</b> and thermistor-based <b>power</b> <b>sensors.</b> Thermal sensors depend on the process of absorbing the RF and microwave signal energy, and sense the resulting heat rise. Therefore, they respond to true average power of the signal, whether it is pulsed, CW, AM/FM or any complex modulation. (Agilent 2008).Thermocouple <b>power</b> <b>sensors</b> make up the majority of the thermal <b>power</b> <b>sensors</b> sold at present. They are generally reasonably linear and have a reasonably fast response time and dynamic range. The microwave power is absorbed in a load whose temperature rise is measured by the thermocouple. Thermocouple sensors often require a reference DC or microwave power source for calibration before measuring; this can be built into the <b>power</b> meter.Thermistor-based <b>power</b> <b>sensors</b> such as the Agilent 8478B are generally only used in situations where their excellent linearity is important, as they are both much slower and have a smaller dynamic range than either thermocouple or diode-based <b>sensors.</b> Thermistor-based <b>power</b> <b>sensors</b> are still the sensor of choice for power transfer standards because of their DC power substitution capability (Agilent 2006).Other thermal sensing technologies include microwave calorimeters and bolometers,and quasi-optic pulsed microwave sensors.|$|R

50|$|Usually a {{microwave}} power meter will consist of a measuring head which contains the actual power sensing element, connected via a cable to the meter proper, which displays the power reading. The head may {{be referred to as}} a <b>power</b> <b>sensor</b> or mount.Different power sensors can be used for different frequencies or power levels. Historically the means of operation in most <b>power</b> <b>sensor</b> and meter combinations was that the sensor would convert the microwave power into an analogue voltage which would be read by the meter and converted into a power reading.

50|$|Most models {{like the}} above {{do not have}} the {{capability}} to measure power consumption at a component or subsystem level. DiPART (Disaggregated Power Analysis in Real Time) developed by Professor M. Srivastava, Y. Sun, and L. Wanner at University of California, Los Angeles enables this capability to estimate power consumption based on hardware performance counters and using only one <b>power</b> <b>sensor</b> for the whole system. Models are required to estimate power consumption based on performance counters. These models correlate the data for different performance counters with power consumption and static models like above examples (First-order and Piece-wise linear) have different estimation errors due to variations across identical hardware. DiPART is a solution to this problem because it is a self-adaptive model that can be calibrated once and be applied across different platforms.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—Clustering is used {{extensively}} in {{wireless sensor networks}} to optimize lifetime. Within clustering, the optimization of cluster head (CH) location is critical since CHs consume energy faster and have greater influence on lifetime than non cluster head (NCH) sensors. Energy harvesting wireless sensor networks (EH-WSNs) use energy harvesting devices to harvest energy from environment. In contrast with the traditional battery <b>powered</b> wireless <b>sensor</b> networks, EH-WSNs have extended network lifetime substantially. In this paper, we present a single cluster algorithm for lifetime optimization in homogeneous wireless sensor networks with one solar <b>powered</b> <b>sensor.</b> The proposed method could determine the optimal CH location within a given network distribution.

50|$|Instruments with moving coils can be {{calibrated}} {{for direct}} current or power frequency currents up {{to a few}} hundred hertz. At radio frequencies a common method is a rectifier circuit arranged to respond to current in a transmission line; the system is calibrated for the known circuit impedance. Diode detectors are either directly connected to the source, or used with a sampling system that diverts {{only a portion of}} the RF power through the detector. Thermistors and thermocouples are used to measure heat produced by RF power and can be calibrated either directly or by comparison with a known reference source of power. A bolometer <b>power</b> <b>sensor</b> converts incident radio frequency power to heat. The sensor element is maintained at a constant temperature by a small direct current. The reduction in current required to maintain temperature is related to the incident RF power. Instruments of this type are used throughout the RF spectrum and can even measure visible light power. For high-power measurements, a calorimeter directly measures heat produced by RF power.|$|E

40|$|Key words: thermal {{transduction}}, transduction physics We give {{an introduction}} to the physical principles onwhich silicon themlal sensors are based. We briefly describe the transductions and conversions involved in these sensors, and different themlal sensors and the physics on which they are based. 1. The Functioilal Principle of Thermal Sensors In this paper, we describe themlal sensors based on silicon and related technologies, with an electrical output signal. The input signal can be any of the six signal types defined by Middelhoek and Audet,(l) i. e., mechanical, magnetic, chemical, radiant, themlal and electrical signals. In themlal sensors, the transduction of the input signal to the output signal is carried out in two steps. First the input signal is transduced into a themlal signal, and then the themlal signal is transduced into the eleetrical output signal. 1. 1 Thermal <b>power</b> <b>sensors</b> An important distinction among themlal sensors is that between <b>power</b> <b>sensors</b> and conductance <b>sensors.</b> In <b>power</b> <b>sensors</b> the input signal which is measured by the <b>sensor</b> is themlal <b>power,</b> which is used to generate the electrical <b>power</b> of the <b>sensor</b> output signal.
