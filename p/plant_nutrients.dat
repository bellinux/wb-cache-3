5|$|In the Amazon basin, when caimans became scarce as {{a result}} of {{overhunting}} in the mid-20th century, the number of local fish, such as the important arapaima (Arapaima gigas), also decreased. These are nutrient-poor waters, and the urine and faeces of the caimans may have increased primary production by contributing <b>plant</b> <b>nutrients.</b> Thus the presence of the reptiles could have benefited the fish stock; the number of crocodilians in a stretch of water appears to be correlated with the fish population.|$|E

40|$|A NODC {{data set}} {{representing}} all {{regions of the}} world ocean was analyzed for temperature and sigma-t relationships with nitrate, phosphate or silicic acid. Six cubic regressions were for each ten degree square of latitude and longitude containing adequate data. World maps display the locations that allow the prediction of <b>plant</b> <b>nutrient</b> concentrations from temperature or sigma-t. Geographic coverage improves along the sequence: nitrate, phosphate, and silicic acid and is better for sigma-t than for temperature. Contour maps of the approximate temperature of sigma-t at which these nitrients are no longer measurable in a parcel of water are generated, based on a percentile analysis of the temperature or sigma-t at which less than a selected amount of <b>plant</b> <b>nutrient</b> occurs.

40|$|An alfalfa field {{experiment}} {{was conducted at}} the Debre Zeit Experiment station {{for a period of}} 2 years with the main objective of investigating the effects of cattle manure om dry matter yields, <b>plant</b> tissue <b>nutrient</b> concentration and <b>plant</b> <b>nutrient</b> uptake. Dry matter yields were significantly increased by manure application. <b>Plant</b> tissue <b>nutrient</b> concentration data indicated that these were generally not significantly influenced by manure application, except for a few harvesting times, where P and Mg were significantly increased. <b>Plant</b> <b>nutrient</b> uptake was generally significantly increased by the addition of manure, except for N, Ca and Mg, which were not significantly increased. However, uptake of all nutrient elements was significantly correlated with increasing manure rates. The uptake of large quantities of nutrient by alfalfa indicates the potential of this legume to provide high quality feed for livestock and, if returned to the soil, for soil fertility improvement. The correaltion between dry matter yields and <b>plant</b> tissue <b>nutrient</b> concentration were generally poor, except for K and Mg during the last harvest.

40|$|Animal manures have {{economic}} value as <b>plant</b> <b>nutrient</b> sources and as amendments for soils whose physical properties {{can be improved}} by adding organic matter. Their value as fertilizer per metric ton applied is generally inverse to their water and carbon contents. <b>Plant</b> <b>nutrient</b> concentrations in animal manures are highly variable, thereby introducing uncertainty into meeting <b>plant</b> <b>nutrient</b> needs for crop production. Where manure has been applied for several years, however, little or no additional fertilizer phosphorus (P) and potassium (K) are needed for crop production. Animal manures were ranked in decreasing order as to replacement fertilizer value (dollars) as follows: broiler litter; hen litter; hen droppings; beef feedlot, swine and dairy solid manures; poultry slurry; and other classes of livestock manure slurries. Storage conditions and degree of dilution mainly determine the fertilizer value of liquid manure. Liquid manures have little potential {{economic value}} as fertilizer outside the farm where produced. Relative efficiencies of manure nitrogen (N) as compared to commercial fertilizer N range from less than 30 % to greater than 100 %. Manure N applications that are immediately incorporated have produced yields equal to those produced by fertilizer N for many different crops. The representative <b>plant</b> <b>nutrient</b> contents selected from the literature suggest that replacement fertilizer value can exceed waste management costs, thus changing manure from a waste to a resource...|$|R
25|$|The use of {{melamine}} as fertilizer for crops {{had been}} envisaged during the 1950s and 1960s {{because of its}} high nitrogen content (2/3). However, melamine is much more expensive to produce than are other common nitrogen fertilizers, such as urea. To be effective as a fertilizer, {{it is essential that}} the <b>plant</b> <b>nutrients</b> are released or made available in a manner that matches the needs of the growing crop. The nitrogen mineralization process for melamine is extremely slow, making this product both economically and scientifically impractical for use as a fertilizer.|$|E
25|$|The {{nitrogen}} (N) {{and phosphorus}} (P) applied to agricultural land (via synthetic fertilizers, composts, manures, biosolids, etc.) can provide valuable <b>plant</b> <b>nutrients.</b> However, if not managed correctly, excess N and P can have negative environmental consequences. Excess N supplied by both synthetic fertilizers (as highly soluble nitrate) and organic {{sources such as}} manures (whose organic N is mineralized to nitrate by soil microorganisms) can lead to groundwater contamination of nitrate. Nitrate-contaminated drinking water can cause blue baby syndrome. Together with excess P from these same fertilizer sources, eutrophication can occur downstream due to excess nutrient supply, leading to anoxic areas called dead zones.|$|E
25|$|The {{biological}} load, or bioload, is {{a measure}} of the burden placed on the aquarium ecosystem by its inhabitants. High biological loading presents a more complicated tank ecology, which in turn means that equilibrium is easier to upset. Several fundamental constraints on biological loading depend on aquarium size. The water's surface area limits oxygen intake. The bacteria population depends on the physical space they have available to colonize. Physically, only a limited size and number of plants and animals can fit into an aquarium while still providing room for movement. Biologically, biological loading refers to the rate of biological decay in proportion to tank volume. Adding plants to an aquarium will sometimes help greatly with taking up fish waste as <b>plant</b> <b>nutrients.</b> Although an aquarium can be overloaded with fish, an excess of plants is unlikely to cause harm. Decaying plant material, such as decaying plant leaves, can add these nutrients back into the aquarium if not promptly removed. The bioload is processed by the aquarium's biofilter filtration system.|$|E
25|$|A {{nutrient}} that is able {{to limit}} plant growth according to Liebig's law of the minimum is considered an essential <b>plant</b> <b>nutrient</b> if the <b>plant</b> cannot complete its full life cycle without it.

40|$|Theoretical {{arguments}} {{suggest that}} increased plant productivity may not only increase consumer densities {{but also their}} fluctuations. While increased consumer densities are commonly observed in fertilization experiments, experiments are seldom performed at a spatial and temporal scale where effects on population fluctuations may be observed. In this study we used a natural gradient in soil fertility caused by cormorant nesting. Cormorants feed on fish but defecate on their nesting islands. On these islands we studied soil <b>nutrient</b> availability, <b>plant</b> <b>nutrient</b> content and the density of Galerucella beetles, main herbivores feeding on Lythrum salicaria. In a common garden experiment, we followed larval development on fertilized plants and estimated larval stoichiometry. Soil nutrient availability varied among islands, and several cormorant islands had very high N and P soil content. <b>Plant</b> <b>nutrient</b> content, however, did not vary among islands, {{and there was no}} correlation between soil and <b>plant</b> <b>nutrient</b> contents. Beetle densities increased with <b>plant</b> <b>nutrient</b> content in the field study. However, there was either no effect on temporal fluctuations in beetle density or that temporal fluctuations decreased (at high P). In the common garden experiment, we found limited responses in either larval survival or pupal weights to fertilization. A possible mechanism for the limited effect of fertilization on density fluctuations may be that the distribution of L. salicaria on nesting islands was restricted to sites with a lower N and P content, presumably because high N loads are toxic...|$|R

500|$|The {{mycorrhizal}} symbiosis is ancient, dating {{to at least}} 400 million years ago. It often increases the plant's uptake of inorganic compounds, such as nitrate and phosphate from soils having low concentrations of these key <b>plant</b> <b>nutrients.</b> The fungal partners may also mediate plant-to-plant transfer of carbohydrates and other nutrients. Such mycorrhizal communities are called [...] "common mycorrhizal networks". A special case of mycorrhiza is myco-heterotrophy, whereby the plant parasitizes the fungus, obtaining all of its nutrients from its fungal symbiont. Some fungal species inhabit the tissues inside roots, stems, and leaves, in which case they are called endophytes. Similar to mycorrhiza, endophytic colonization by fungi may benefit both symbionts; for example, endophytes of grasses impart to their host increased resistance to herbivores and other environmental stresses and receive food and shelter from the plant in return.|$|E

Scientific and reasonable fertilization based on rapid and nondestructive <b>plant</b> <b>nutrient</b> detection {{will be a}} valuable solution for solving above problems. In this study, spectral transmittance in wavelength ranged from 300 to 1100 nm, chlorophyll content and nitrogen content of rice and cucumber leaves treated with culture solution in five different nitrogen levels were measured.
