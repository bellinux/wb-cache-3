Because the safety {{and validity of the}} VAT has been questioned in the literature, {{the purpose of this study}} was to determine if a relationship existed between a new tool, the cervical <b>positional</b> <b>tolerance</b> questionnaire (CPTQ), and the duplex Doppler ultrasound findings for patients with suspected VBI. Subjects were 39 consecutive patients referred by their physician for a duplex Doppler ultrasound with suspicion of VBI. On the CPTQ, patients reported whether they avoided certain cervical positions due to symptoms consistent with VBI prior to undergoing the ultrasound. The CPTQ had a sensitivity = 1. 00 (95 % CI: 0. 34 – 1. 00); specificity = 0. 78 (95 % CI: 0. 64 – 0. 92); negative likelihood ratio = 0. 00 (95 % CI: 0. 02 – 2. 73); and positive likelihood ratio = 4. 50 (95 % CI: 1. 67 – 7. 89). The results of this case series study, while preliminary, are encouraging. Further research with larger sample sizes is warranted in the development of the CPTQ regarding pre-cervical manipulation clinical decision-making. Inclusion of subjects from a cohort including asymptomatic people (no suspicion of VBI) would also strengthen the screening ability of the CPTQ.

40|$|The human {{visual system}} {{is able to}} {{effortlessly}} integrate local features to form our rich perception of patterns, {{despite the fact that}} visual information is discretely sampled by the retina and cortex. By using a novel perturbation technique, we show that the mechanisms by which features are integrated into coherent percepts are scale-invariant and nonlinear (phase and contrast polarity independent). They appear to operate by assigning position labels or “place tags” to each feature. Specifically, in the first series of experiments, we show that the <b>positional</b> <b>tolerance</b> of these place tags in foveal, and peripheral vision is about half the separation of the features, suggesting that the neural mechanisms that bind features into forms are quite robust to topographical jitter. In the second series of experiment, we asked how many stimulus samples are required for pattern identification by human and ideal observers. In human foveal vision, only about half the features are needed for reliable pattern interpolation. In this regard, human vision is quite efficient (ratio of ideal to real ≈ 0. 75). Peripheral vision, on the other hand is rather inefficient, requiring more features, suggesting that the stimulus may be relatively underrepresented at the stage of feature integration...|$|E
40|$|Representing the {{semantics}} of {{the interaction}} {{of two or more}} tolerances (i. e. composite tolerance) explicitly to make them computer-understandable is currently a challenging task in computer-aided tolerancing (CAT). We have proposed a description logic (DL) ontology based approach to complete this task recently. In this paper, the representation of the semantics of the composite <b>positional</b> <b>tolerance</b> (CPT) for patterns of holes (POHs) is used as an example to illustrate the proposed approach. This representation mainly includes: representing the structure knowledge of the CPT for POHs in DL terminological axioms; expressing the constraint knowledge with Horn rules; and describing the individual knowledge using DL assertional axioms. By implementing the representation with the web ontology language (OWL) and the semantic web rule language (SWRL), a CPT ontology is developed. This ontology has explicitly computer-understandable semantics due to the logic-based semantics of OWL and SWRL. As is illustrated by an engineering example, such semantics makes it possible to automatically check the consistency, reason out the new knowledge, and implement the semantic interoperability of CPT information. Benefiting from this, the ontology provides a semantic enrichment model for the CPT information extracted from CAD/CAM systems...|$|E

40|$|This study {{proposes a}} simple method of {{fabricating}} flexible electronic devices using a metal template for passive alignment between chip components and an interconnect layer, which enabled efficient alignment with high accuracy.

The interconnect layer was fabricated by a two-step photolithography process and evaporation. After applying solder paste, the metal template was placed {{on top of the}} interconnect layer. The metal template had rectangular holes at the same position as the chip components on the interconnect layer. Rectangular hole sizes were designed to account for alignment tolerance of the chips. Passive alignment was performed by simply inserting the components in the holes of the template, which resulted in accurate alignment with <b>positional</b> <b>tolerance</b> of less than 10 µm based on the structural design, suggesting that our method can efficiently perform chip mounting with precision.

40|$|A {{new method}} for {{aligning}} and actuating membranes for 3 D nano-assembly {{based on the}} interactions of nanomagnets has been developed. Arrays of nanopatterned magnetic material are integrated onto thin-film membranes. It is shown theoretically and experimentally that separate arrays of nanomagnets attract and self-align when brought into close proximity. This provides a useful mechanism for 3 D nanofabrication because it allows higher <b>positional</b> <b>tolerances</b> as the nanomagnets provide the fine alignment. The features on the membrane can first be patterned using traditional wafer and thin-film processes with features such as nanophotonics {{as well as the}} nanomagnets.

Hardware development focused on the Component Test Power Converter (CTPC), a single cylinder, 12. 5 -kWe engine. Design parameters for the CTPC were 150 bar operating pressure, 70 Hz frequency, and hot-and cold-end temperatures of 1050 K and 525 K, respectively. The CTPC was also designed for integration with an annular sodium heat pipe at the hot end, which incorporated a unique "Starfish" heater head that eliminated highly stressed brazed or weld joints exposed to liquid metal and used a shaped-tubed electrochemical milling process to achieve precise <b>positional</b> <b>tolerances.</b> Selection of materials that could withstand high operating temperatures with long life were another focus.

Tests on the CTPC were performed in three phases: cold end testing (525 K), engine testing with slot radiant heaters, and integrated heat pipe engine system testing. Each test phase was successful, with the integrated engine system demonstrating a power level of 12. 5 kWe and an overall efficiency of 22 percent in its maiden test.

A random, but known pattern of more than 50, 000 lead tiles, each 5 mm square, was bonded to a large honeycomb panel which projects a shadow on the detector array during a gamma ray burst. A two-year development process was necessary to explore ideas, apply techniques, and finalize procedures to meet the strict requirements for the coded aperture mask. Challenges included finding a honeycomb substrate with minimal gamma ray attenuation, selecting an adhesive with adequate bond strength to hold the tiles in place but soft enough to allow the tiles to expand and contract without distorting the panel under large temperature gradients, and eliminating excess adhesive from all untiled areas. The largest challenge was to find an efficient way to bond the > 50, 000 lead tiles to the panel with <b>positional</b> <b>tolerances</b> measured in microns. In order to generate the desired bondline, adhesive was applied and allowed to cure to each tile. The pre-cured tiles were located in a tool to maintain positional accuracy, wet adhesive was applied to the panel, and it was lowered to the tile surface with synchronized actuators. Using this procedure, the entire tile pattern was transferred to the large honeycomb panel in a single bond. The pressure for the bond was achieved by enclosing the entire system in a vacuum bag. Thermal vacuum and acoustic tests validated this approach.

40|$|Precision {{structures}} for space-based optical systems are typically subjected to brief periods of random vibration during the launch and ground testing phases. Such events pose {{a potential threat}} to the dimensional stability of such structures, which {{may be required to}} maintain <b>positional</b> <b>tolerances</b> on large optics in the low 10 s of microns to meet optical performance requirements. Whilst there is an abundance of information in the literature on structural instability caused by hygrothermal cycling, there appears to have been little work done on the effects of random vibration. This issue has recently been addressed at RAL with a series of tests aimed at characterizing the behavior of dimensional instability in {{structures for}} high-resolution Earth-imaging cameras subject to random vibration. Firstly, a breadboard model of a typical "conventional" CFRP-based optical payload structure was produced and subjected to a range of environmental tests. The effects of random vibration were compared to those of other environmental stressors (such as thermal vacuum testing) and found to be significant. Next, controlled tests were performed on specific structural areas in order to assess the specific contributions of each area to overall instability. These tests made use of novel test setups and metrology techniques to assess the dimensional stability response of material samples and bolted joints to random vibration exposure. The tests were able to measure dimensional instability, characterize it over a series of tests of increasing vibration levels, and assess variability in results between identical samples. Finally, a predictive technique using a Finite Element Model with nonlinear kinematic hardening was produced. A time domain solution was obtained, using an analogy to Miner's Rule to determine load cycle amplitudes. This model correlated reasonably well with test results. This paper presents this program of work, and the results. It also proposes ways to minimize and mitigate dimensional instability due to random vibration by design, analysis and procedural means...|$|R

As the literature research grew, it became more and more clear that experts on the field were focusing their studies on the different types of piles, the various items of piling equipment and later the possible installation methods of general application. Moreover, noise control in construction sites is nowadays a matter of increasing importance due to the global turn towards the environmental safety and {{the health and safety of}} the people. Whereas most would find the subject complete from a Civil Engineer point of view, a Surveyor would object; an essential aspect of the installation process is to come up with a way to accurately position the piling frame that will guide the pile to the correct position. The greater the magnitude of the project and the more piling work at sea, the greater the challenge. In addition, in order to meet the requirements of the project in <b>positional</b> <b>tolerances,</b> one would consider a new model of piling frame, one with the element of flexibility in micro – movements, rather than trying to achieve the aforementioned accuracy by positioning the marine barge.

An optical coordinate measuring machine (CMM) {{can be used to}} position optical detectors relative to mechanical reference points. This approach will eliminate all requirements on <b>positional</b> <b>tolerances.</b> The only requirement is that the PCB is manufactured with oversized holes. An exaggerated sketch of this situation is shown in Figure 2. The sketch shows very loose tolerances on mounting the optical detector in the chip carrier, loose tolerance on soldering the chip carrier to the PCB, and finally large tolerance on where the mounting screws are located. The PCB is held with large screws and oversized holes. The PCB is mounted loosely so it can move freely around. The optical CMM measures the mechanical reference points. Based on these measurements, the required positions of the optical detector corners can be calculated. The optical CMM is commanded to go to the position where one detector corner is supposed to be. This is indicated with the cross-hairs in Figure 2 (a). This figure is representative of the image of the optical CMM monitor. Using a suitable tapping tool, the PCB is manually tapped around until the corner of the optical detector is at the crosshairs of the optical CMM. The CMM is commanded to another corner, and the process is repeated a number of times until all corners of the optical detector are within a distance of 10 to 30 microns of the required position. The situation is sketched in Figure 2 (b) (the figure also shows the tapping tool and where to tap). At this point the fasteners for the PCB are torqued slightly so the PCB can still move. The PCB location is adjusted again with the tapping tool. This process is repeated 3 to 4 times until the final torque is achieved. The oversized mounting holes are then filled with a liquid bonding agent to secure the board in position (not shown in the sketch). A 10 - to 30 -micron mounting accuracy has been achieved utilizing this method. ...|$|R
40|$|Next-generation space telescopes in NASA's Origins {{missions}} require use {{of advanced}} imaging techniques to achieve high optical performance with limited launch mass. Structurally-connected Michelson interferometers meet these demands, but pose specific {{challenges in the}} areas of system dynamics and controls, uncertainty management and testing. The telescope optics must meet stringent <b>positional</b> <b>tolerances</b> in the presence of environmental and on-board disturbances, resulting in heavy demands on structural dynamics and control. In addition, fully integrated system tests are cost-prohibitive due to the size and flexibility of the system coupled with the severe differences between the on-orbit and ground testing environments. As a result, the success of these missions relies heavily on the accuracy of the structural and control models used to predict system performance. In this thesis, dynamic tailoring and tuning are applied to the design of precision optical space structures to meet aggressive performance requirements in the presence of parametric model uncertainty. Tailoring refers to changes made to the system during the design, and tuning refers to adjustments on the physical hardware. Design optimizations aimed at improving both performance and robustness are considered for application to this problem. It is shown that when uncertainty is high and performance requirements are aggressive, existing robust design techniques do not always guarantee mission success. Therefore, dynamic tuning is considered {{to take advantage of the}} accuracy of hardware performance data to guide system adjustments to meet requirements. (cont.) A range of hardware tuning techniques for practical implementation are presented, and a hybrid model updating and tuning methodology using isoperformance analysis is developed. It is shown that dynamic tuning can enhance the performance of a system designed under high levels of uncertainty. Therefore, robust design is extended to include tuning elements that allow for uncertainty compensation after the structure is built. The new methodology, Robust Performance Tailoring for Tuning creates a design that is both robust to uncertainty and has significant tuning authority to allow for hardware adjustments. The design methodology is particularly well-suited for high-performance, high-risk missions and improves existing levels of mission confidence in the absence of a fully integrated system test prior to launch. In the early stages of the mission the design is tailored for performance, robustness and tuning authority. The incorporation of carefully chosen tuning elements guarantees that, given an accurate uncertainty model, the physical structure is tunable so that system performance can be brought within requirements. It is shown that tailoring for tuning further extends the level of parametric uncertainty that can be tolerated at a given performance requirement beyond that of sequential tailoring and tuning, and is the only design methodology considered that is consistently successful for all simulated hardware realizations. by Rebecca Ann Masterson.

40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} {{comprehensive}} {{framework for the}} accuracy assessment of taxonomically diverse LULC maps. A widely accepted difficulty in assessing such maps {{is associated with the}} vagueness in the interpretation of complex landscapes. For every class of the map, this method quantified the thematic and positional fuzziness of accuracy, induced by this difficulty. The labeling protocol consisted of a fuzzy comparison between the map and a reference maplet, for which degrees of <b>positional</b> and thematic <b>tolerance</b> can be user-defined. The construction of reference maplets permitted a flexible analysis (comparable with the assessment of other maps) of the positional fuzziness of the reference dataset and of the vagueness of the assessment process, while the alternate evaluation protocol, based on traditional point like data collection, did not allow such analysis...|$|R
40|$|Protein {{engineering}} {{techniques such}} as directed evolution and structure-based design aim to improve the properties of natural proteins. The next step, the de novo insertion of function into previously inert protein scaffolds, is the lofty promise of computational protein design. In order {{to achieve this goal}} reliably and efficiently, computational methods can be iteratively improved by cycling between theory and experiment. Efforts to both accelerate the rate and broaden the information exchanged within protein design cycles form the core of this thesis. Improvements in the throughput of experimental stability determination allowed the thorough assessment of new multi-state and library design tools. Intending to alleviate the fixed backbone, single native state design approximation, the study found constrained molecular dynamics ensembles useful for core repacking applications. The subsequent development of automated liquid handling protocols for common molecular biology techniques brings design experiments to new levels of sample throughput. This technology facilitated the creation of a stability database encompassing every single mutant in a small protein domain. Although constructed to facilitate future computational training efforts, we answer a multitude of questions pertaining to mutational outcomes, distributions, <b>positional</b> sensitivity, <b>tolerance,</b> and additivity {{in the context of a}} protein domain. By expanding the constraints of experimental molecular biology, this work opens up new possibilities in the efforts to train and assay new computational methodologies for protein engineering applications. ...|$|R
