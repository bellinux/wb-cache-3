To-day I dined at Molesworth's, the Florence Envoy; and sat {{this evening}} {{with my friend}} Darteneuf,(3) whom you have heard me talk of; the {{greatest}} <b>punner</b> of this town next myself. Have you smoked the Tatler that I writ?(4) It is much liked here, and I think it a pure(5) one. To-morrow I go with Delaval,(6) the Portugal Envoy, to dine with Lord Halifax near Hampton Court.(7) Your Manley's brother, a Parliament-man here, has gotten an employment;(8) and I am informed uses much interest to preserve his brother: and, to-day, I spoke to the elder Frankland to engage his father (Postmaster here); and I hope he will be safe, although he is cruelly hated by all the Tories of Ireland. I have almost finished my lampoon, and will print it for revenge on a certain great person.(9) It has cost me but three shillings in meat and drink since I came here, as thin as the town is. I laugh to see myself so disengaged in these revolutions. Well, I must leave off, and go write to Sir John Stanley,(10) to desire him to engage Lady Hyde as my mistress to engage Lord Hyde(11) in favour of Mr. Pratt.(12) ...|$|E
5000|$|The {{pleasures of}} the table and of convivial society proved an irresistible {{attraction}} for him throughout his life, and he became in general estimation the bon-vivant of his day. Jonathan Swift and Dartiquenave were friends, and by themselves or in the company of such spirits as Henry St. John and Thomas Parnell, they dined or drank punch. ‘My friend Dartineuf,’ says Swift in his ‘Journal to Stella,’ ‘is the greatest <b>punner</b> of this town next myself,’ and in another passage of the same journal Swift dubs his friend ‘the man that knows everything and that everybody knows; that knows where a knot of rabble are going on a holiday and when they were there last.’ Alexander Pope in his imitations of Horace, ‘Satire I.,’ allows to each mortal his pleasure, and asserts that none deny Scarsdale his bottle, Darty his ham-pie, and in ‘Satires’ (II. ii) he mentions ‘Darty’ as a culinary judge. Lord Lyttelton, in his ‘Dialogues of the Dead’ (dialogue xix.), made Apicius and Dartiquenave represent the epicures of ancient and modern history. Samuel Johnson recorded (in 1776) that when this book came out Dodsley the publisher remarked to him, ‘I knew Dartineuf well, for I was once his footman.’ Tradition has assigned to Dartiquenave some contributions to the ‘Tatler,’ e.g. a letter in No. 252, ‘On the Pleasure of Modern Drinking.’ ...|$|E
6000|$|SIR, I cannot {{but think}} {{that we live in}} a bad age, O tempora, O mores! as 'tis in the adage. My foot was but just set out from my cathedral, When into my hands comes a letter from the droll. I can't pray in quiet for you and your verses; But now let us hear what the Muse from your car says. [...] Hum--excellent good--your anger was stirr'd; Well, <b>punners</b> and rhymers must have the last word. But let me advise you, when next I hear from you, To leave off this passion which does not become you; For we who debate on a subject important, Must argue with calmness, or else will come short on't. For myself, I protest, I care not a fiddle, For a riddle and sieve, or a sieve and a riddle; And think of the sex as you please, I'd as lieve You call them a riddle, as call them a sieve. Yet still you are out, (though to vex you I'm loth,) For I'll prove it {{impossible}} they can be both; A school-boy knows this, for it plainly appears That a sieve dissolves riddles by help of the shears; For you can't but have heard of a trick among wizards, To break open riddles with shears or with scissars. [...] Think again of the sieve, and I'll hold you a wager, You'll dare not to question my minor or major.[1] A sieve keeps half in, and therefore, no doubt, Like a woman, keeps in less than it lets out. Why sure, Mr. Poet, your head got a-jar, By riding this morning too long in your car: And I wish your few friends, when they next see your cargo, For the sake of your senses would lay an embargo. You threaten the stocks; I say you are scurrilous And you durst not talk thus, if I saw you at our ale-house. But as for your threats, you may do what you can I despise any poet that truckled to Dan But keep a good tongue, or you'll find to your smart From rhyming in cars, you may swing in a cart. You found out my rebus with very much modesty; But thanks to the lady; I'm sure she's too good to ye: Till she lent you her help, you were in a fine twitter; You hit it, you say;--you're a delicate hitter. How could you forget so ungratefully a lass, And if you be my Phoebus, pray who was your Pallas? [...] As for your new rebus, or riddle, or crux, I will either explain, or repay it by trucks; Though your lords, and your dogs, and your catches, methinks, Are harder than ever were put by the Sphinx. And thus I am fully revenged for your late tricks, Which is all at present from the [...] DEAN OF ST. PATRICK'S.|$|R

Inicialmente, procedemos a uma retomada histórica, buscando conhecer como o riso e o risível foram explicados por vários pensadores e teóricos de diferentes épocas. De Aristóteles a Freud, pudemos constatar o domínio de três grandes correntes teóricas: a psicológica, a sociológica e a psicanalítica. Somente quando a Lingüística se fixa como ciência, já no século XX, o fenômeno do riso passa a ser estudado sob a perspectiva estritamente lingüística. No segundo capítulo, procedemos à contextualização do corpus e buscamos verificar como a produtividade do humor ? o dizer muito com pouco ? se constrói em outra mídia. Se a comicização extratextual revelou-se típica nos textos analisados, também pudemos detectar que o humor de José Simão constantemente se realiza via paródia e apresenta características do cômico grotesco. Explicitar e exemplificar a Teoria Semântica do Humor, proposta por Raskin - para quem todo texto risível envolve a sobreposição de scripts e a presença de um gatilho que permite a passagem do modo sério (bona fide) para o modo joke telling (non-bona fide) ? foram as ações que nortearam a elaboração do nosso terceiro capítulo. Já o quarto capítulo foi dedicado exclusivamente ao humor das palavras, ou seja, ao humor verbal cuja motivação inicial decorre de se explorarem os aspectos sonoros, significantes. O último capítulo, dedicado à análise, permitiu-nos constatar como a clássica divisão de Cícero (humor da res e humor da verba) permanece atual: as piadas trocadilhescas e as situacionais bem o comprovam. The aim of {{this paper}} is to analyse as the humor and the laugh are {{linguistic}} made. The theory?s statement is based on Bergson, Propp, Bahktin, Todorov e Attardo. Firstly we made a historical retrospective, trying to know as the humor and the laugh were explained by several thinkers and theorists throughout the different ages. From Aristotle to Freud we could realize the domain of the three remarkable current theories: the psychological, the sociological, the psychoanalytic. Only when the Linguistic was considered as a science - which happened just on the XX century - the humor´s phenomenon started to be studied from a proper linguistic side of view. On the second chapter, we focused the corpus and we tried to verify how the humor?s productivity - as to say lots in few words - is made in another media. We noted that extratextual comic action was the typical one in the studied texts and we also realized that José Simão?s humor is often parodist and so it shows typical characteristics of the grotesque comic. To explain and to give some examples of the ?Semantic Theory of Humor? proposed by Raskin - to whom all the humor texts involves a overlap of scripts and the presence of a trigger which provides the passage from the bona fide to the joke telling mode ? were the actions that leaded the elaboration of the third chapter. The fourth chapter was dedicated specifically to the humor of the words, it is to say: the verbal humor which bases come from the sonorous aspects of the words. The last chapter, dedicated to the final analysis, let us realized as the classic division of Cicero (humor of res and humor of verba) remains between us: the jokes and the <b>punners</b> can prove it...|$|R
