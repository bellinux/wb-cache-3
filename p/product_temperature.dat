40|$|Laminar {{premixed}} unity-Lewis number flames are studied numerically, {{to examine}} flow-flame interaction in a two-dimensional closed domain. Two opposed planar flame fronts are perturbed sinusoidally {{and allowed to}} develop by consuming premixed reactants. Combustion heat release leads to global pressure and temperature rise in the domain, due to confinement. A superadiabatic condition, with <b>products</b> <b>temperature</b> rising with distance behind the flame front, is observed due to stagnation pressure rise. Variations in tangential strain rate behind the perturbed flame fronts, due to flame curvature and heat release, result in a modified local superadiabatic temperature gradient in the products. These variations in temperature gradients are shown to determine the net local confinement-heating rate in the products, leading to corresponding deviations in <b>products</b> <b>temperature,</b> and the local reaction rate along the flame front.

50|$|In {{sectional}} coolers every {{free flowing}} bulk material can be cooled. They often {{can be found}} after rotary kilns in calcination processes or similar. Their intended purpose is usually to reduce the <b>product</b> <b>temperature</b> as far {{that it can be}} handled with other apparatus (conveyors, mills, etc.). Often the cooling itself also is an important part in the production process. Typical products are, e.g. calcined petroleum coke; zinc calcine; soda ash; pigments and more.

50|$|Moisture is {{the most}} {{important}} of these factors, and affects the mix viscosity, acting to plasticize the extrudate. Increasing moisture will decrease viscosity, torque, and <b>product</b> <b>temperature,</b> and increase bulk density. This will also reduce the pressure at the die. Most extrusion processes for food processing maintain a moisture level below 40%, that is low to intermediate moisture. High-moisture extrusion is known as wet extrusion, but it was not used much before the introduction of twin screw extruders (TSE), which have a more efficient conveying capability.

50|$|Micro {{reactors}} can be tube or {{plates and}} have the key feature of small diameter flow channels (typically less than <1 mm). The significance of micro reactors is that the heat transfer area (A) per unit volume (of product) is very large. A large heat transfer area means that high values of qx can be achieved with low values of Tp - Tj. The low value of Tp - Tj limits the extent of over cooling that can occur. Thus the <b>product</b> <b>temperature</b> can be controlled by regulating {{the temperature of the}} heat transfer fluid (or the product).|$|E

50|$|The most {{commonly}} applied technique {{to provide a}} safe and shelf-stable milk is heat treatment. The first system involving indirect heating with continuous flow (125 °C for 6 min) was manufactured in 1893. In 1912, a continuous-flow, direct-heating method of mixing steam with milk at temperatures of 130 to 140 °C was patented. However, without commercially available aseptic packaging systems to pack and store the product, such technology was not very useful in itself, and further development was stalled until the 1950s. In 1953, APV pioneered a steam injection technology, involving direct injection of steam through a specially designed nozzle which raises the <b>product</b> <b>temperature</b> instantly, under brand name Uperiser; milk was packaged in sterile cans. In the 1960s APV launched the first commercial steam infusion system under the Palarisator brand name.|$|E

The granulate can be directly compressed into tablets without additional processing steps besides blending with a lubricant.

The effect of <b>product</b> <b>temperature</b> heterogeneity in MTM <b>product</b> <b>temperature</b> determination was investigated by comparing the MTM product temperatures with directly measured thermocouple product temperatures in systems differing in temperature heterogeneity.

The skim milk powder was {{extruded}} with pearled corn starch at different moisture contents, protein contents, lactose/protein ratios, and feed rates (control variables). Response surface methodology and a central composite in cube experimental design were used. This design required 30 experimental runs with 16 factorial points, 8 axial points, and 6 center points for replication. The physical and functional properties evaluated were expansion ratio, <b>product</b> <b>temperature,</b> bulk density, color, shear stress, viscosity, and water absorption index (response variables). Scanning electron microscopy {{was done to}} evaluate the microstructural attributes of the extrudates.

An increase in moisture content decreased expansion ratio, <b>product</b> <b>temperature,</b> color, and water absorption index, and increased bulk density, shear stress, and viscosity. An increase in protein content decreased <b>product</b> <b>temperature,</b> shear stress, viscosity, and water absorption index, increased color, and had no effect on expansion ratio and bulk density.

Consumers and repository personnel pass {{in front of the}} VORDC and frequently remove or place food products on shelves. This movement affects the thermal performance of the VORDC.

This experimental study quantifies the <b>products</b> <b>temperature</b> and the energy consumption of the VORDC when there is an interference due to consumers passing in front of the VORDC.
