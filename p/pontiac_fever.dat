25|$|<b>Pontiac</b> <b>fever</b> {{was named}} for Pontiac, Michigan, where the first case was recognized. In 1968, several workers at the county's {{department}} of health came down with a fever and mild flu symptoms, but not pneumonia. After the 1976 Legionnaires' outbreak in Philadelphia, the Michigan health department re-examined blood samples and discovered the workers had been infected with the newly identified Legionella pneumophila. An outbreak caused by Legionella micdadei in early 1988 in the UK became known as Lochgoilhead fever. Since that time, other species of Legionella that cause <b>Pontiac</b> <b>fever</b> have been identified, most notably in New Zealand, in 2007 where Legionella longbeachae was discovered. The New Zealand outbreak also {{marked the first time}} <b>Pontiac</b> <b>fever</b> had been traced to potting soil.|$|E
25|$|Species of Legionella {{known to}} cause <b>Pontiac</b> <b>fever</b> include Legionella pneumophila, Legionella longbeachae, Legionella feeleii, Legionella micdadei, and Legionella anisa.|$|E
40|$|Legionellosis became actual in 60 - 80 s of the 20 th century. Legionellosis {{is caused}} by Legionella pneumophila and related bacteria. Clinical manifestations of the disease may vary from mild <b>fever</b> (<b>Pontiacs</b> <b>fever)</b> to {{potentially}} lethal pneumonia (Legionnaires disease). Main natural habitats of Legionella genus are freshwater and humid soil sources. Nevertheless, nowadays most cases of legionellosis are caused by consumption or use of water from man-made water supply systems, especially when appropriate control measures are not carried out. After entering water supply system, Legionella spp. {{can be found in}} all levels of the system - from the water preparation to the consumer. Significant increase of Legionellosis cases (from 0. 13 cases per 100 000 residents in 2009 up to 2. 20 cases per 100 000 residents in 2011 was observed in Latvia.

50|$|The genus Legionella is a {{pathogenic}} {{group of}} Gram-negative bacteria {{that includes the}} species L. pneumophila, causing legionellosis (all illnesses caused by Legionella) including a pneumonia-type illness called Legionnaires disease and a mild flu-like illness called <b>Pontiac</b> <b>fever.</b>|$|E

50|$|People {{of any age}} {{may suffer}} from Legionnaires' disease, but the illness most often affects middle-aged and older persons, {{particularly}} those who smoke cigarettes or have chronic lung disease.

50|$|Legionella anisa is a Gram-negative bacterium, one of {{more than}} 40 species in the family Legionellaceae.

50|$|Legionella longbeachae is {{one species}} of the family Legionellaceae. It was first {{isolated}} from a patient in Long Beach, California. It is found predominantly in potting soil and compost. In humans, the infection is sometimes called <b>Pontiac</b> <b>fever.</b> Human infection from L. longbeachae is particularly common in Australia, but cases have been documented in other countries including the United States, Japan, Greece and the UK.|$|E
50|$|Upon inhalation, the {{bacteria}} can infect alveolar macrophages, where {{the bacteria}} can replicate. This results in Legionnaires' {{disease and the}} less severe illness <b>Pontiac</b> <b>fever.</b> Legionella transmission is via inhalation of water droplets from a contaminated source that has allowed the organism to grow and spread (e.g., cooling towers). Transmission also occurs less commonly via aspiration of drinking water from an infected source. Person-to-person transmission has not been demonstrated; though, it could be possible in rare cases.|$|E
50|$|Legionella feeleii is a Gram-negative, {{rod-shaped}} bacterium {{from the}} genus Legionella which was isolated from an automobile plant {{and which was}} held responsible for causing <b>Pontiac</b> <b>fever</b> in 317 workers. The organism did not grow on blood agar, required L-cysteine, and showed significant quantities of branched-chain fatty acids. More recently, an unusual, extrapulmonary case was described in a 66-year-old woman admitted to Hopital Nord, Marseille, France because of a complicated cellulitis and an abscess on her right leg following a suspected insect or spider bite.|$|E
50|$|In 2014, it was {{reported}} that use of common garden hoses in combination with spray nozzles may generate aerosols containing droplets smaller than 10 μm, which can be inhaled by nearby people. Water stagnating in a hose between uses, especially when warmed by the sun, can host the growth and interaction of Legionella and free-living amoebae (FLA) as biofilms on the inner surface of the hose. Clinical cases of Legionnaires' disease or <b>Pontiac</b> <b>fever</b> {{have been found to be}} associated with inhalation of garden hose aerosols containing Legionella bacteria. The report provided measured microbial densities resulting from controlled hose conditions in order to quantify the human health risks. The densities of Legionella spp. identified in two types of hoses were found to be similar to those reported during legionellosis outbreaks from other causes. It was proposed that the risk could be mitigated by draining hoses after use.|$|E

Results The proposed definition of <b>Pontiac</b> <b>fever</b> associated the following criteria: occurrence of at least one symptom among headache, myalgia, fever and shivers, possibly associated with other 'minor' symptoms, within three days after a shower contaminated by Legionella, during a maximum of 8 days (minimum 2 days). 23 such cases occurred during the study (incidence rate: 0. 125 cases per person-year [95 % CI: 0. 122 – 0. 127]). A concentration of Legionella in water equal to or greater than 10 4. L - 1 (FISH method) was associated with a significant increase of incidence of <b>Pontiac</b> <b>fever</b> (p = 0. 04).

During March 2004, a large outbreak of legionnaires disease and <b>Pontiac</b> <b>fever</b> occurred among hotel guests in Oklahoma. An investigation {{was conducted to}} identify the source and evaluate {{the utility of the}} Legionella urine antigen assay and serologic testing for the identification of <b>Pontiac</b> <b>fever.</b> Methods. A retrospective cohort investigation of hotel guests and employees and an environmental evaluation were performed. Participants were interviewed, and clinical specimens were collected from consenting individuals. Results. Six cases of legionnaires disease and 101 cases of <b>Pontiac</b> <b>fever</b> were identified. Exposure to the indoor pool and hot tub area was associated with legionellosis (relative risk, 4. 4; 95 % confidence interval, 2. 8 – 6. 9).

For <b>Pontiac</b> <b>fever,</b> the sensitivity and positive predictive value were 35. 7 % and 100 %, respectively, for the urine antigen assay, and 46. 4 % and 90 %, respectively, for serologic testing.
