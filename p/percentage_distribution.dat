A complete equipercentile procedure which uses the proposed method and provides linear and quadratic functions for goodness-of-fit and extrapolation is discussed and illustrated with data from a test equating project.

40|$|Purpose: To evaluate, by {{transmission}} electron microscopy, {{the extent}} of silver nitrate penetration into four polymerized resin blends with increasing degree of hydrophilicity {{after a period of}} 24 hours. Methods: The uncured resin was polymerized in an experimental composite inlay processing chamber under a pressurized nitrogen atmosphere maintained at 551. 6 KPa and light-activated for one complete cycle at 125 °C for 10 minutes. The resin blocks were sectioned occluso-gingivally into multiple 0. 9 x 0. 9 x 5 mm resin beams, and immersed in 50 % basic, ammoniacal silver nitrate for 24 hours, exposed to a photodeveloping solution and prepared for transmission electron microscopy. The <b>percentage</b> <b>distributions</b> of silver deposits were compared using Kruskal-Wallis one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) on ranks and Dunn's multiple comparison tests. Results: No silver uptake occurred in the two most hydrophobic resins (Groups 1 & 2). The <b>percentage</b> <b>distributions</b> of silver deposits in the more hydrophilic Group 3 (6. 23 ± 1. 35 %) and 4 (5. 08 ± 1. 09 %) resins were significantly higher (P< 0. 05) than were found in the more hydrophobic resins but Groups 3 and 4 were not significantly different from each other. The intensity of silver uptake increased with hydrophilicity of the resin blends. TEM examination revealed two types of silver deposits: fine spotted-type silver grains, and islands of interconnecting electron-dense clusters of silver grains. Phase separation of resin components was observed in Group 4 resin blends. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R

D is the measure of one half the sum of the absolute difference between the <b>percentage</b> <b>distributions.</b> The values range from 0 to 100 and measures the relative separation or integration of groups across an area. If the value equals 0% it means the area is distributed evenly. If the value is 100% it means the area is completely segregated.
