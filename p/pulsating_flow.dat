40|$|<b>Pulsating</b> <b>flow</b> can {{increase}} the heat transfer coefficient when a two-phase flow passes through a single horizontal tube through the following mechanisms: 1) When liquid-vapor two-phase flow and heat transfer occurs inside a tube, flow pulsations can change the flow pattern and increase liquid-wall contact area at a fixed void fraction, thus increasing the heat transfer coefficient; 2) Local pressure at some locations in the tube will drop more with <b>pulsating</b> <b>flow,</b> and the attendant reduction saturation temperature {{can increase}} local evaporation and heat transfer. However, the effects of pulsation are more complex for pulsations within a practical evaporator for which {{the use of a}} multi-tube construction and the presence of tube bends {{at the end of each}} tube certainly affect the resulting flow. In this case, it is anticipated that pulsation width modulation is very important for evaporator performance enhancement. Moreover, local pressure drop in the evaporator increases due to the <b>pulsating</b> <b>flow,</b> and this needs to be taken into account for practical evaporators when considering pulsation as a method of heat transfer performance enhancement.

Empirical non-dimensional relations for the amplitude and the spectral character of the sound radiated from confined jet flows were developed, utilizing an original spectral decomposition procedure.

Broadband noise generation in <b>pulsating</b> <b>flows</b> was also investigated.
