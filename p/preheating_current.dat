40|$|Two {{types of}} {{starting}} auxiliary electrode {{were used for}} the investigation that the hot cathode type fluorescent discharge lamps were started on the low voltage. The ring type electrode or the strip type electrode, as the starting electrode, was positioned near the 20 W fluorescent lamp wall, and the starting characteristics of the discharge lamp were measured for the source frequency region between commercial frequencies and 500 Hz. For commercial frequencies and 500 Hz, the relation between the main restriking voltage and the ring location and also the <b>preheating</b> <b>current</b> of electrodes were obtaind. Using the strip electrode, the relation between the main restriking voltage and the frequency and also the <b>preheating</b> <b>current</b> of electrodes were obtained. When the ring electrode location was on the discharge lamp center and on its both end, the starting voltage was the minimum value and the maximum value respectively, that is it showed V-curve. Using the ring electrode, the minimum restriking voltage dropped to about 30 % (100 V) at commercial frequencies and about 90 % (215 V) at 500 Hz as compared with the normal type-Using the strip electrode, the minimum restriking voltage dropped to less than about 30 % (100 V) at commercial frequencies and less than 50 % (120 V) at high frequencies as compared with the normal type. Generaly, the starting voltage decreases as the <b>preheating</b> <b>current</b> increases, but the degree of <b>preheating</b> <b>current</b> region between 300 mA and 350 mA is neccesary to accelerate the starting. It is thought that the effect of the starting auxiliary electrodes resultes essentially in shortening of the electrode gap. When the reflector was earthed, the starting characteristics were not affected by the earthing effect for the strip electrode, but those were made random by the earthing effect for the ring electrode. Thus, it is concluded that as the strip type and the ring type electrode can be dropped the restriking voltage of the long type discharge lamps, using those are succesful in case of the low voltage starting in frequency region between commercial frequencies and high frequencies...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe laser brazing {{of steel}} sheets is widely applied in car-body manufacturing. The {{critical}} {{value for the}} strength of the joint is the minimal connection width between the two sheets. However, this value is depending on the feed rate and power of the laser and the feed rate and <b>preheating</b> <b>current</b> of the filler wire used. Furthermore, the wetting behavior of the brazing solder is affected by the surface properties of the joining partners and is thus prone to errors. Currently, mostly destructive testing is used to evaluate the connection state. Therefore, we studied a novel optical measurement technique which is capable of remotely measuring oscillations of the joining partners. In the proposed study, we show how the oscillations are connected to the process behavior and the fusion area and how the setup might be applied as a post- and in-process measurement system...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: The {{resistance}} spot welding process of galvanized steel sheet used in the body manufacturing of family car was studied, and the indexes of nugget geometry and tensile-shear strength of spot welds were tested. Four process parameters, namely welding current, electrode force, welding <b>current</b> duration and <b>preheat</b> <b>current,</b> and interactions among them were regarded as factors impacting indexes. Method using in mathematical models developing was nonlinear multiple orthogonal regression assembling design, which was optimized by the technology of variance analysis.

40|$|Material {{variations}} {{and process}} modifications {{have been studied}} to determine their effects on the acceptable range of resistance spot welding conditions for galvanized steel sheet. The material variations studied include zinc coating integrity, structure, composition, thickness, roughness, oil, and the amount and type of Fe-Zn intermetallics. Process modifications studied include upsloping and downsloping of the weld <b>current,</b> <b>preheat</b> <b>current,</b> postheat current, electrode tip geometry, and applied force. It was found that hot-dipped galvanized materials with coatings which have a very thin Fe-Zn alloy layer have {{a wider range of}} acceptable welding conditions than the commercial galvannealed products, which have a fully alloyed Fe-Zn coating. The decreased lobe width of the galvannealed material is due to the discontinuous Fe-Zn coating structure and morphology. Small variations in the thickness of the coatings studied have no significant effect on the welding current range. Surface roughness of the coating has no effect on lobe width. Ups loping and downs loping of the weld current increase the welding range of hot-dipped products when using truncated cone electrodes, whereas sloped current has no advantage for galvannealed or uncoated materials. Radiused electrodes can increase the lobe width of hot-dipped products but are not beneficial when using sloped currel) t or when welding galvannealed or uncoated materials. I...|$|R

50|$|When starting, {{the glow}} plug is {{electrically}} <b>preheated</b> by electric <b>current.</b> The glow plug {{is not to}} be confused with a spark plug - there is no spark in the glow plug. Catalysis from methanol vapor on the heated platinum element keeps it red-hot even after voltage has been removed, which ignites the fuel and keeps the engine running. Whereas spark plugs are constantly used to ignite the fuel/air mix every time the piston comes up, as seen in the petrol engine where the spark plug is used, the fuel cannot be ignited with compression alone. It is the plug's temperature, still red-hot from previous ignition and from catalysis with the new compressed mixture, that ignites the fuel.|$|R
40|$|One of {{the crucial}} {{problems}} in fusion research is the understanding of heat and particle transport in plasmas relevant for energy production. The neo-classical theory of tokamak transport is well-established, but it cannot explain experimental results. Instead, the micro-turbulence driven anomalous transport {{has been found to}} be dominant in present tokamak experiments. There are several mechanisms that can locally suppress micro-turbulence and reduce significantly the anomalous transport. These regions of reduced transport are called transport barriers. The presence of Internal Transport Barriers (ITBs) is one of the bases in 'Advanced Tokamak Scenarios'. One of the principal goals in the 'Advanced Tokamak Scenarios' is to improve the fusion power density and confinement with internal transport barriers by controlling the current density profile and maximising the bootstrap current - and ultimately rendering the tokamak compatible with continuous operation. This thesis reports on studies and modelling of internal transport barriers and current density profiles in the Joint European Torus (JET) tokamak with a fluid transport code. Explanations for the following open questions are sought: what are the mechanisms that govern the formation and dynamics of the ITBs in JET and secondly, how can the current density profile be modified and further, how does it affect ITBs and plasma performance? On the basis of the empirical study at the ITB transition, the ωE×B flow shear and magnetic shear appear as strong candidates in determining the onset time, the radial location and the dynamics of the ITBs in JET. This ITB threshold condition, employed in the semi-empirical Bohm/GyroBohm transport model, {{has been found to be}} in good agreement with experimental results in predictive transport simulations. On the other hand, the simulation results from the predictive transport modelling with a theory-based quasi-linear fluid transport model strongly emphasise the importance of the density gradient in the ITB formation. According to the current density modelling studies, lower hybrid and electron cyclotron current drive are the most versatile current drive methods in terms of the produced q-profile in the preheating phase in JET. With lower hybrid <b>preheating,</b> a core <b>current</b> hole has been found and a physics-based explanation, confirmed by the transport modelling, is given. The predictive transport simulations indicate that application of lower hybrid current drive during the high performance phase can enhance the fusion performance significantly by increasing the ITB radius. reviewe...|$|R
40|$|The {{study of}} fuel {{droplets}} undergoing evaporation in convective environments has been made. Droplets studied have sizes less than 100 μm which {{are close to}} the range found in modern high pressure fuel spray systems. To enable this study, a co-flow reactor and a piezo-electric nozzle were used. The evaporation environments with varying degrees of convection were produced by use of an inverse flat-flame burner operating on a combination of CH 4, H 2, O 2 and N 2. Temperatures studied are up to 676 K which closely resembles {{that at the end of}} the compression stroke of a diesel engine. To measure the evaporation rate in these circumstances, digital inline holography was selected and developed to a magnified version which was combined with particle image velocimetry for measurement. This thesis presents the development of the measurement technique and a full analysis of potential sources that contribute to the measurement uncertainty. The development was based on use of a coherent collimated laser beam with a wavelength of 635 µm for illumination and a high speed camera with CCD array resolution of 12 µm/px for recording. To find the focus position of the droplet in the optical path at which the image is used to calculate the droplet size, a criterion of maximum area with a threshold value was chosen. Magnification factor used in this study was 3. 996 which enables the measurement of droplets with sizes down to about 10 μm. Droplet sizes measured were found to have acceptable uncertainty with the largest error to be about ± 4 µm resulting from optics imperfections. Although the cross-correlation of reconstructed images was found to be affected by the reconstruction quality, the uncertainty in velocity measurement was found negligible. The evaporation rate was estimated to have a typical error of 9 %. Experiment was done for petroleum distillates n-nonane, n-decane and n-dodecane; and standard light diesel as a multicoponent fuel in two varying heating conditions. It was found that the evaporation process is not only dependant on the surrounding temperature but also largely influenced by the <b>preheating</b> effect. For <b>current</b> conditions, all fuels initially experience thermal expansion except for nonane. This expansion level as well as the preheating time was found to be affected by the droplet size which, in turn, was found to play no noticeable role on the evaporation rate for the low convections used. Amongst alkane fuels the evaporation rate was found to be higher for the lighter fuel but when the gas temperature is close to the peak used, their rates become virtually the same to be about 0. 22 mm 2 /s. For all temperatures, diesel has the lowest evaporation rate which initially shows preferential vaporisation but then resembles the diffusion limit behaviour. For the peak temperature used, its rate is about 0. 19 mm 2 /s. A simple infinite conductivity Lump model accounting for convection as well as the transient droplet preheating was formulated which was found to be efficient in describing the single component droplet behavior in this work in terms of the evaporation rate but slightly underpredicts the initial expansion and slightly overpredicts the droplet lifetime. If a proper set of properties is used, diesel may also be approximated by this model for certain conditions. This model indicated that the evaporation rate is controlled by the droplet temperature which tightly follows the gas temperature and that the droplet temperature is always well below the boiling point. Extension of the model to account for the Stefan flow effect and internal liquid temperature variation by using an effective conductivity concept revealed that for current conditions, the Stefan flow has very little effect in slowing down the process and that the initial strongly unsteady evaporation is due to the difference between the droplet surface and center temperatures. This difference is however not large for all cases even though the liquid thermal transport was found to be mostly by conduction. The Lump model was favored by the findings in this work that it could be used to approximate micro droplets undergoing evaporation in high temperature, strongly convective environments at least for single component fuels such as those used here...|$|R
