40|$|This thesis {{describes}} {{and discusses}} {{the findings of}} an in-depth experimental investigation to explore the effect of section thickness on microstructural evolution and mechanical properties of high <b>pressure</b> <b>die</b> <b>cast</b> magnesium alloys AM 50. In comparison with <b>die</b> <b>cast</b> AM 50, the microstructure and tensile behavior of squeeze cast AM 50 also were studied. High <b>pressure</b> <b>die</b> <b>cast</b> magnesium alloy AM 50 is currently used extensively in complex shaped automotive components with various cross-section thicknesses. Understanding {{of the effect of}} section thicknesses on mechanical behavior of AM 50 is critical for proper design of different applications. In the present study, magnesium alloy AM 50 was high <b>pressure</b> <b>die</b> <b>cast</b> into rectangular coupons with section thicknesses of 2, 6 and 10 mm. Microstructural analysis and porosity measurement were performed on the representative specimens. The prepared coupons were tensile tested at room temperature. Squeeze casting technology has also been applied to produce AM 50 alloy discs in this study. (Abstract shortened by UMI.)

40|$|The microstructures and {{mechanical}} properties of strontium modified semisolid metal high <b>pressure</b> <b>die</b> <b>cast</b> A 356 alloy are presented. The alloy A 356 -F (as cast) has a globular primary grain structure containing a fine eutectic. Solution treatment results in spheroidisation of the eutectic silicon particles under the T 4 and T 6 temper conditions. The A 356 -T 5 maintains the fibrous silicon morphology after artificial aging. A 356 -T 4 has better ductility and impact strength than A 356 -T 5 {{due to its}} spheroidised silicon morphology. The impact properties of semisolid metal high <b>pressure</b> <b>die</b> <b>cast</b> A 356 are controlled mainly by the silicon morphology and alloy strength (hardness), whereas tensile strength {{is determined by the}} degree of solid solution coupled with precipitate formation during aging...|$|R

Silicon tombac has good friction bearing characteristics and is corrosion resistant but is not resistant to ammonia atmosphere. The strength properties are largely retained at application temperatures up to 200 °C.It is a special alloy {{in terms of the}} combination of casting process and casting temperature. In most cases, parts made of silicon tombac, are produced through the high <b>pressure</b> <b>die</b> <b>casting</b> process, which is normally specialized on metals with relatively low melting temperatures. But in this case the temperature melting range of silicon tombac is in the area of 950 to 1000 °C, which is relatively high for casting into permanent moulds. The advantage is the productivity of this highly automated casting process. The disadvantage is the temperature stress of the surface of the permanent mould, so that the lifetime of these moulds is limited.|$|E

Joining of vacuum high <b>pressure</b> <b>die</b> <b>cast</b> aluminum alloy A 356 subjected to different heat treatments with wrought 6061 was carried out by using the Gas Metal Arc Welding (GMAW) process. The results of tensile testing showed that the order of the welded samples with the overall engineering performance combining the strengths and ductility from the highest to the lowest were T 5 - A 356 alloy, as-cast A 356 alloy, T 6 -A 356 alloy and T 4 -A 356 alloy.

50|$|Breeden was a Lucas {{employee}} who acquired {{an interest in}} the Wilmot company, a long-established Birmingham silversmiths, which accounts for the name. Wilmot stayed with the company until 1949 at least, and the title was hyphenated until the early fifties. By the time of Breeden's death in 1951 it employed more than 5,000 people. Breeden had brought back from the United States the concept of attached metal bumpers or fenders. Breeden was approached by William Morris, probably in 1928, and asked to supply bumpers for the new Morris Minor. With very {{little in the way of}} facilities he delivered the first batch within three months of commencement. He subsequently began supplying Austin, Wolseley, and eventually almost every UK vehicle maker. The Wilmot part of the business concentrated upon smaller parts, developing new techniques of <b>pressure</b> <b>die</b> <b>casting</b> and chromium plating which made them market leaders. By 1931 the company had issued a catalogue which contained many other types of automotive components including door locks. It is one of the direct antecedents of the current Inteva Products international components group. He was well-connected within the automotive industry in other ways too. In 1914, he married Hilda, the daughter of Harry Lucas, son of the founder of Lucas Industries and the head of that company; in 1951, just six months before he died, his younger son married a daughter of Leonard Lord, the head of the Austin Motor Company and the architect of the British Motor Corporation. Before the First World War, Breeden had worked with Oliver Lucas of the Lucas Industries group to develop the dynamo for use on motorcycles, which were a fast-growing industry in Birmingham.|$|E

The morphology of alpha-Mg is controlled by the number of nucleation events and the cooling rate. (C) 2009 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R
40|$|Simulation of mould {{filling in}} high <b>pressure</b> <b>die</b> <b>casting</b> {{has been an}} {{attractive}} area of research for many years. Several numerical methodologies have been adopted {{in the past to}} study the flow behaviour of the molten metal inside the die cavities. However, many of these methods require stationary mesh or grid which limits their ability in simulating highly dynamic and transient flows encountered in high <b>pressure</b> <b>die</b> <b>casting</b> processes. In recent years, the advent of meshfree methods have led to the opening of new avenues in numerical computational field. Consequently, particle based methods have emerged as an attractive alternative for modeling mould filling simulation in <b>pressure</b> <b>die</b> <b>casting</b> processes. In this paper the Corrected Smooth Particle Hydrodynamics (CSPH) method is used to simulate fluid flow in the high <b>pressure</b> <b>die</b> <b>casting</b> cavity. CSPH is a Lagrangian method based on Smooth Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) techniques. In CSPH method, the quantities determining the flow are localised on set of particles, which move with the flow.

The additives tested were added as AlCr 15, AlV 10 and AlMo 8 master alloys. Alloys tested were poured into DTA sampler as well as using <b>pressure</b> <b>die</b> <b>casting.</b> An amount of Cr, V and Mo additives in alloy poured into DTA sampler comprised within the range approximately 0. 05 - 0. 35 %. Alloys to <b>pressure</b> <b>die</b> <b>casting</b> contained 0. 05 - 0. 20 % Cr, V and Mo. The crystallization process was examined using the derivative thermal analysis (DTA). The microstructure of castings made in the DTA sampler as well as castings made with use of <b>pressure</b> <b>die</b> <b>casting</b> were examined. The basic mechanical properties of castings made using <b>pressure</b> <b>die</b> <b>casting</b> were defined too.

These phases have a morphology similar to the walled and a relatively large size. The analogous phases also occur in <b>pressure</b> <b>die</b> <b>casting</b> alloys containing 0. 10 % or more additions of Cr, V and Mo.

40|$|Understanding tensile and {{fracture}} {{behaviors of}} <b>die</b> <b>cast</b> magnesium alloys is {{of importance for}} proper design of various emerging automotive applications. In the present study, magnesium alloy AM 50 was high <b>pressure</b> <b>die</b> <b>cast</b> into rectangular coupons with section thicknesses of 2, 6, and 10 [*]mm. Effect of section thicknesses on strain-hardening and fracture behaviors of the <b>die</b> <b>cast</b> AM 50 was investigated. The results of tensile testing indicate that the tensile properties including yield strength (YS), ultimate tensile strength (UTS), and elongation (Ef) decrease with increasing section thicknesses of <b>die</b> <b>cast</b> AM 50.

The observation via SEM fractography illustrates that the fracture behavior of <b>die</b> <b>cast</b> AM 50 is influenced by section thicknesses.
