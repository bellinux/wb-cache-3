However, {{the value of these}} deferred assets could only be claimed if the company turned a profit in the future. Because of bank's <b>profit</b> <b>outlook</b> was so dim, Resona's auditor refused to certify the company's financial statement if the deferred tax assets were included. Without being able to count the deferred tax assets, the bank was effectively insolvent.|$|E

They thereby credibly signal to their new managers, that they are high profit types. Low profit firms {{on the other hand}} will offer contracts with high profit participations and low fixed wages. One can thus easily explain the prevalence of contracts with high fixed salaries, without having to appeal to employee risk aversion. ...|$|E
40|$|Over {{the last}} few decades the wind power {{industry}} has grown very rapidly, and dozens of wind turbine manufacturers now operate all over the globe. Worldwide, installed capacity has increased tenfold in the last ten years, and the average rated power of the wind turbines available on the market has quadrupled in the same period (BWE 2010). However, in recent times wind turbine manufacturers have struggled to achieve profitable value performance, typically including wind turbine engineering, production, project management, logistics, installation, and commissioning (Knight 2012; McKenna 2012; Quilter 2012). The wind energy industry is customer-driven and regulated by local laws and guidelines. Both have a strong influence on the technology of wind turbines. Wind turbine manufacturers attempt to provide wind turbines that fit the specific requirements of each market or customer exactly. This regularly leads to a high variety of products, which are designed to fit many different market and customer demands. Furthermore, in times of overcapacity, markets demand that product manufacturers are more responsive and provide short and reliable lead times for customer-specific products (Albrecht 1999). The wind turbine market currently faces these challenges (Knight 2012; McKenna 2012; Quilter 2012). In such market environments, an excellent strategy planning with innovative elements, e. g. in product development, manufacturing procedures, the supply chain or the sales channels is inevitably a key factor for companies looking to maintain and/or improve their competitive position and <b>profit</b> <b>outlooks</b> (Albrecht 1999). The overall goal of this research is to investigate whether lean or agile manufacturing techniques can help manufacturers respond to these challenges. In particular, to evaluate whether lean or agile manufacturing techniques exist that have the capability to improve the value performance of wind turbine manufacturers and simultaneously enable sufficient product variety, as demanded by the different markets. The evaluation of the identified manufacturing strategies, concepts and methods resulted in Mass Customization being chosen as most suitable for wind turbines, due to its capabilities for managing a large number of product variants and a reduction of inventory. Finally, the manufacturing concept Mass Customization was implemented in a single case study at a wind turbine manufacturer, in order to investigate the physical and organizational impacts caused by the implementation. The research showed that there are lean and agile manufacturing techniques that address the needs of wind turbine manufacturers. The research further showed that the implementation of Mass Customization {{had a significant impact on}} the customer order process of a wind turbine manufacturer. Besides certain product preparations, a timely and comprehensive communication concept was required. The effects of both proper and poor project measures became evident in the case study. In summary, the research proved that Mass Customization has the capability to create corporate-wide and seamless communication on the product and customer order process at a wind turbine manufacturer, which can create the basis for an improved value performance...|$|R
40|$|The Australian Securities Exchange (ASX) listing rule 3. 1 {{requires}} {{listed companies}} to immediately disclose price sensitive {{information to the}} market via the ASX’s Company Announcements Platform (CAP) prior to release through other disclosure channels. Since 1999, to improve the communication process, the ASX has permitted third-party mediation in the disclosure process {{that leads to the}} release of an Open Briefing (OB) through CAP. An OB is an interview between senior executives of the firm and an Open Briefing analyst employed by Orient Capital Pty Ltd (broaching topics such as current <b>profit</b> and <b>outlook).</b> Motivated by an absence of research on factors that influence firms to use OBs as a discretionary disclosure channel, this study examines (1) Why do firms choose to release information to the market via OBs?, (2) What are the firm characteristics that explain the discretionary use of OBs as a disclosure channel?, and (3) What are the disclosure attributes that influence firms’ decisions to regularly use OBs as a disclosure channel? Based on agency and information economics theories, a theoretical framework is developed to address research questions. This theoretical framework comprises disclosure environments such as firm characteristics and external factors, disclosure attributes and disclosure consequences. In order to address the first research question, the study investigates (i) the purpose of using OBs, (2) whether firms use OBs to provide information relating to previous public announcements, and (3) whether firms use OBs to provide routine or non-routine disclosures. In relation to the second and third research questions, hypotheses are developed to test factors expected to explain the discretionary use of OBs and firms’ decisions to regularly use OBs, and to explore the factors influencing the nature of OB disclosure. Content analysis and logistic regression models are used to investigate the research questions and test the hypotheses. Data are drawn from a hand-collected population of 1863 OB announcements issued by 239 listed firms between 2000 and 2010. The results show that types of information disclosed via an OB announcement are principally on matters relating to corporate strategies and performance and outlook. Most OB announcements are linked with a previous related announcement, with the lag between announcements significantly longer for loss-making firms than profitmaking firms. The main results show that firms which tend to be larger, have an analyst following, and have higher growth opportunities, are more likely to release OBs. Further, older firms and firms that release OB announcements containing good news, historical information and less complex information tend to be regular OB users. Lastly, firms more likely to disclose strategic information via OBs tend to operate in industries facing greater uncertainty, do not have analysts following, and have higher growth opportunities are less likely to disclose good news, historical information and complex information via OBs. This study is expected to contribute to disclosure literature in terms of disclosure attributes and firm characteristics that influence behaviour in this unique (OB) disclosure channel. With regard to practical significance, regulators can gain an understanding of how OBs are disclosed which can assist them in monitoring the use of OBs and improving the effectiveness of communications with stakeholders. In addition, investors can have a better comprehension of information contained in OB announcements, which may in turn better facilitate their investment decisions...|$|R

ENGLISH ABSTRACT: The {{purpose of}} this report {{is to create a}} better {{understanding}} of the new pharmacy initiatives in the South African market, with specific reference to the Nuclicks and Pick 'n Pay groups. In order to understand the respective business concepts better the following abstracts from each chapter of the study is given. Chapter one is basically the introduction to the study and describes the events that lead to the above mentioned corporate retailers to enter the pharmacy market place. An introduction to Hamel's business model theory is also discussed and identified as a possible means of evaluating the corporate retailers' business concepts. In Chapter two the strategic analysis of the South African retail pharmacy industry is performed. This analysis is performed to create an understanding of the different forces at work in the industry. Some of the key findings in this chapter are that changes to the pharmacy act and the way dispensing licences are going to be awarded creates uncertainty. The <b>profit</b> <b>outlook</b> of retail pharmacy, though on the decline, still compares favourably to other retailers. In chapter three the core concepts of Hamel's business model are presented in more detail and applied to the retail pharmacy environment. In his view, a strategy needs to change the industry rules. This chapter ends with the concept of wealth potential based on Hamel's teachings. The wealth potential concept is about creating cash flow and profits. A business model that is able to create customer benefits well below the cost of the competitors is regarded as efficient. By utilising the Hamel way the Nuclicks (chapter four) and Pick 'n Pay (chapter five) business concepts is unpacked. Both Nuclicks and Pick 'n Pay pharmacy business models are presented within the corporate framework of the groups. Nuclicks bought an established pharmacy franchise while Pick 'n Pay launched Healthpharm. Nuclicks creates a possible choke point by buying UPD. The Nuclicks pharmacy strategy is a more comprehensive health strategy, while Pick 'n Pay follows a more cautious approach. As franchising will playa major role in both pharmacy concepts, the theory of franchising is presented in chapter six. Telephonic interviews with Link franchisees are conducted and the possible reasons for the ambiguity that crept into the Link business model are discussed. As the Healthpharm franchise is a new concept, it is evaluated based on information gathered from press releases and the Healthpharm web-site. In chapter seven universal conclusions and recommendations, based upon the literature study and this investigation, are presented. One of the key findings are, success in the face of changes requires more than the current way of doing business. It requires an innovative thinking process. New business models have to be formulated that allows retail pharmacists to establish a focused and well-differentiated value proposition. This value proposition needs to be meaningful for consumers and must strengthen a pharmacy outlet's competitive position. AFRIKAANSE OPSOMMING: Die doel van hierdie verslag is om 'n beter begrip vir die nuwe apteek inisiatiewe in die Suid-Afrikaanse mark te ontwikkel, met spesifieke verwysing na die Nuclicks en Pick 'n Pay groepe. Om die onderskeie besiqheidskonsepte beter te verstaan, word die volgende opsomming van elke hoofstuk van die studie uiteengesit. Hoofstuk een is 'n inleiding tot die studie en beskryf die gebeure wat aanleiding gegee het tot die bogenoemde korporatiewe kleinhandelaars se toetrede tot die apteek mark. 'n Inleiding van Hamel se besigheidsmodel teorie is ook bespreek en is geïdentifiseer as evaluering van die korporatiewe kleinhandelaars se besigheidskonsepte. Hoofstuk twee bied 'n strategiese analise van die Suid-Afrikaanse kleinhandelaars apteek industrie. Hierdie analise is geskep om beter begrip te ontwikkel vir die verskillende kragte wat inwerk in die industrie. Van die bevindinge in die hoofstuk is die veranderinge in die apteek wetgewing en die wyse waarop resepteer lisensies toegeken gaan word, en hoeveel onsekerhede dit tot gevolg het. Die wins vooruitsigte van kleinhandelaars apteke, alhoewel aan die afneem, vergelyk steeds gunstig met ander kleinhandelaars. In Hoofstuk drie is die kern konsepte van Hamel se besigheidsmodel in meer detail uiteengesit en toegepas op die kleinhandelaar apteek omgewing. Uit sy oogpunt, is 'n strategie nodig om veranderinge te weeg te bring in die industrie reëls. Hierdie hoofstuk eindig met die konsep van waarde potensiaal wat gebaseer is op Hamel se teorie. Hierdie waarde potensiaal konsep is gebaseer op die skep van kontantvloei en 'n Besigheidsmodel wat in staat is om die kliënt te begunstig heelwat laer as die koste van die teenstander, word beskou as effektief. Hamel se teorie is gebruik om Nuclicks (hoofstuk vier) en Pick 'n Pay (hoofstuk vyf) se besigheidskonsepte te analiseer. Beide Nuclicks en Pick 'n Pay se besigheidsmodelle word aangebied binne die korporatiewe raakwerke van die groepe. Nuclicks het 'n gevestigde apteek konsessie gekoop terwyl Pick 'n Pay vir Healthpharm begin het. Nuclicks het 'n moontlike 'wurgpunt" geskep deur die aankoop van UPD. Die Nuclicks apteek strategie is 'n meer omvattende gesondheidstrategie, terwyl Pick 'n Pay 'n meer versigtige benadering volg. Aangesien besigheid konsessie 'n belangrike rol speel in beide apteek konsepte, word die teorie van konsessie in hoofstuk ses behandel. Telefoniese onderhoude is gevoer met Link konsessiehouers en die moontlike redes vir die twyfelagtigheid van die Link besigheidsmodel word bespreek. Aangesien die Healthpharm konsessie 'n nuwe konsep is, word dit geëvalueer op grond van inligting wat versamel is uit die media en die Healthpharm webtuiste. In Hoofstuk sewe word universele afleidings en aanbevelings, gebaseer op die literatuurstudie en die ondersoek, uiteengesit. Een van die hoof bevindings was dat sukses benodig meer as die huidige manier van besigheid doen. Nuwe besigheidsmodelle moet geformuleer word, wat dit vir kleinhandelaar apteke moontlik sal maak om 'n gefokusde en goed gedifferensieerde waarde voorstel tot stand te bring. Hierdie voorstel moet betekenisvol wees vir die verbruiker en moet die apteek kompeterende posisie versterk...|$|E
