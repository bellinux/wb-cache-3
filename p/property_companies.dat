5|$|A major {{report was}} {{published}} in January 1998 by The New York Times detailing Zardari's vast corruption and misuse of public funds. The report discussed $200 million in kickbacks to Zardari and a Pakistani partner for a $4 billion contract with French military contractor Dassault Aviation, in a deal that fell apart only when the Bhutto government was dismissed. It contained details of two payments of $5 million each by a gold bullion dealer {{in return for a}} monopoly on gold imports. It had information from Pakistani investigators that the Bhutto family had allegedly accrued more than $1.5 billion in illicit profits through kickbacks in virtually every sphere of government activity. It also reported Zardari's mid-1990s spending spree, which included {{hundreds of thousands of dollars}} spent on jewellery. The arrangements made by the Bhutto family for their wealth relied on Western <b>property</b> <b>companies,</b> Western lawyers, and a network of Western friends. The report described how Zardari had arranged secret contracts, painstaking negotiations, and the dismissal of anyone who objected to his dealings.|$|E

25|$|To {{the north}} of the library, where an Athletic Institute was {{originally}} to stand, a six-storey office block was built in 198889 by Leonard J. Multon & Partners. A footbridge connecting the library with Centenary Square was added as part of improvements to the square in 198889. The atrium was enclosed with a glass roof and screens by the City Architect’s Department in 198991. The space below was named Paradise Forum, originally proposed as an alfresco eating and entertainment area, but eventually leased to <b>property</b> <b>companies</b> who sublet the units to shops and fast food outlet tenants. The uncompleted bus interchange became service areas for the tenants of Paradise Forum. In 1999 the whole of Paradise Forum was sold off to Argent Group.|$|E

2500|$|In the United Kingdom, The Crown (which, for {{practical}} purposes, meant the civil service) did not insure property such as government buildings. [...] If a government building was damaged, {{the cost of}} repair would be met from public funds because, in the long run, this was cheaper than paying insurance premiums. [...] Since many UK government buildings have been sold to <b>property</b> <b>companies,</b> and rented back, this arrangement is now less common and may have disappeared altogether.|$|E
2500|$|The Arndale Property Trust, {{formed in}} the early 1950s, took its name from its founders, Arnold Hagenbach and Sam Chippindale. Hagenbach, a Yorkshireman of Swiss {{extraction}} owned a chain of baker's shops and had invested in retail premises from 1939. Chippindale was an estate agent and former civil servant from Otley. Arndale was unusual, though not unique, amongst <b>property</b> <b>companies</b> in being based outside London and specialising in retail property. Hagenbach invested more and was the quieter partner. Chippindale was blunt and outspoken but was able to persuade sceptical northern councils to accept the company's proposals, where London-based developers could not. Arndale bought property north of Market Street in 1952.••• ...|$|E
2500|$|At {{the end of}} December 2008, the Quinn {{family and}} related {{undertakings}} had loans of €891.3 million to Quinn Group (ROI) Limited. The annual report for 2008 states in the [...] "related party transactions" [...] section that Group had taken a total of €888m of provisions related to loans given to family controlled <b>property</b> <b>companies,</b> investment and finance companies, and other family controlled companies. Of these provisions, €785.6 million related to the investment and finance companies which includes Quinn Finance Holdings, the entity that owned an economic interest of 15% in Anglo Irish Bank. Provisions of €888m accounted for against the €891m of loans, may indicate {{the family and the}} related entities may be unlikely to repay over 99% of these loans to Group.|$|E
