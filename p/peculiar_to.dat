5|$|But the {{equation}} of theft with disloyalty to Æthelstan's person appears <b>peculiar</b> <b>to</b> him. His preoccupation with theft—tough on theft, tough on the causes of theft—finds no direct parallel in other kings' codes.|$|E

5|$|J. Rendel Harris {{pointed out}} that the menology of the Ferrar group {{contains}} saints which appear to be <b>peculiar</b> <b>to</b> Calabria or Sicily.

5|$|According to the {{practice}} of cursing and sorcery <b>peculiar</b> <b>to</b> Sinhala Buddhists, Kataragama deviyo has his dark side represented by Getabaru and Kadavara. The current Getabaru shrine is located in an isolated place near Morawaka. The shrine for Kadavara is in the town of Kataragama. His power to curse is carried out in secret outside the Main Kataragama deviyo shrine at a place at the Menik Ganga, where he receives animal sacrifices. Katagama devio is also directly invoked in sorcery practices.|$|E
5|$|Mountfort's early Gothic work in New Zealand was of {{the more}} severe Anglican variety as practised by Carpenter, with tall lancet windows and many gables. As his career progressed, and he had proved himself to the {{employing}} authorities, his designs developed into a more European form, with towers, turrets and high ornamental roof lines in the French manner, a style which {{was in no way}} <b>peculiar</b> <b>to</b> Mountfort but was endorsed by such architects as Alfred Waterhouse in Britain.|$|E

5|$|The Collégiale Notre-Dame de la Crypte is Cassel's main church, {{built in}} brick. Parts {{date from the}} 11th century but the main part is a 16th-century Gothic {{structure}} of a design known as a hallekerk or hall-church, <b>peculiar</b> <b>to</b> Flanders and Artois. It comprises a huge rectangular space with three gables, three aisles, three apses and a square tower over the transept. During his stay in Cassel during the First World War, Marshal Foch regularly prayed here.|$|E
5|$|Though {{the basic}} {{plan of the}} Western Chalukya style {{originated}} from the older dravida style, many of its features were unique and <b>peculiar</b> <b>to</b> it. One of these distinguishing features of the Western Chalukyan architectural style was an articulation that can still be found throughout modern Karnataka. The only exceptions to this motif {{can be found in}} the area around Kalyani, where the temples exhibit a nagara (North Indian) articulation which has its own unique character.|$|E
5|$|To the {{practical}} ornithologist there arises a considerable gratification {{in being able}} to ascertain the distinguishing characters of birds as they appear at a distance, whether at rest, or during their flight; for not only every genus has something <b>peculiar</b> <b>to</b> itself, but each species has its own appropriate marks, by which a judicious observer may discriminate almost with certainty.|$|E
50|$|Moscou is a densely {{populated}} neighbourhood of the Belgian city of Ghent, which owes its <b>peculiar</b> name <b>to</b> {{the presence of}} the Russian army in 1814-1815.|$|R

5|$|Although 0 is {{divisible}} by 2 {{more times}} than any other number, it is not straightforward to quantify exactly how many times that is. For any nonzero integer n, one may define the 2-adic order of n to be {{the number of times}} n is divisible by 2. This description does not work for 0; {{no matter how many times}} it is divided by 2, it can always be divided by 2 again. Rather, the usual convention is to set the 2-order of 0 to be infinity as a special case. This convention is not <b>peculiar</b> <b>to</b> the 2-order; it is one of the axioms of an additive valuation in higher algebra.|$|E
5|$|Asser's prose {{style has}} been criticised for weak syntax, stylistic pretensions, and garbled exposition. His {{frequent}} use of archaic and unusual words gives his prose a baroque flavour that is common in Insular Latin authors of the period. He uses several words that are <b>peculiar</b> <b>to</b> Frankish Latin sources. This has led to speculation that he was educated at least partly in Francia, {{but it is also}} possible that he acquired this vocabulary from Frankish scholars he associated with at court, such as Grimbald.|$|E
5|$|Bipartite verbal {{compounds}} such {{as these}} are not <b>peculiar</b> <b>to</b> any language in particular. They are in fact very common, and may even occur in every language, albeit with varying frequency. English {{has a number of}} complex predicates, include go sightseeing, have breakfast and take (a) bath. The event described by go sightseeing is unable to be described using a single verb sightsee; inflections like sightsaw and sightseen are ungrammatical. An event like take (a) bath, however, may be described by a single verb bathe, but it arguably has a slightly different meaning. Take (a) bath, in any case, is far more common.|$|E

5|$|By the 19th century, Leicester Square {{was known}} as an {{entertainment}} venue, with many amusements <b>peculiar</b> <b>to</b> the era, including Wyld's Great Globe, which was built for The Great Exhibition of 1851 and housed a giant scale map of the Earth. The construction of New Coventry Street {{made it easier for}} traffic to access the square, resulting in private residences being replaced by shops, museums and exhibition centres. Savile House at No.5–6, built in 1683 for Thomas Bruce, 2nd Earl of Ailesbury, had become a museum by this time, and was ultimately destroyed by fire in 1865. It was rebuilt as the Empire Theatre.|$|E
5|$|The bulk of Masonic ritual {{consists}} of degree ceremonies. Candidates for Freemasonry are progressively initiated into Freemasonry, {{first in the}} degree of Entered Apprentice. Some time later, in a separate ceremony, they will be passed to the degree of Fellowcraft, and finally they will be raised to the degree of Master Mason. In all of these ceremonies, the candidate is entrusted with passwords, signs and grips (secret handshakes) <b>peculiar</b> <b>to</b> his new rank. Another ceremony is the annual installation of the Master and officers of the Lodge. In some jurisdictions Installed Master is valued as a separate rank, with its own secrets to distinguish its members. In other jurisdictions, the grade is not recognised, and no inner ceremony conveys new secrets during the installation of a new Master of the Lodge.|$|E
5|$|The {{original}} {{writing was}} retraced by a later scribe (usually dated to the 10th or 11th century), {{and the beauty}} of the original script was spoiled. Accents and breathing marks, as well as punctuation, have been added by a later hand. There are no enlarged initials, no divisions into chapters or sections such as are found in later manuscripts, but a different system of division <b>peculiar</b> <b>to</b> this manuscript. There are plenty of the itacistic faults, especially the exchange of ει for ι and αι for ε. The exchange of ει and ο for ω is less frequent.|$|E

5|$|Vedar use the Sri Lankan Tamil dialect <b>peculiar</b> <b>to</b> the region, {{known as}} Batticaloa Tamil dialect, in their {{day to day}} conversations. Vedar {{children}} also study in that language in schools. During Sadangu ceremonies, those who are possessed by spirits speak in a mixed language that they call Vedar Sinkalam(Vedar Sinhala") or Vedar Bhasai which is the Vedda language of the interior Vedas. This Vedar Sinkalam is mixed with many Tamil words, as people no longer know the language. There is evidence {{at some point in}} the past that the people were bilingual in Vedda language and Tamil, but that is no longer the case.|$|E
5|$|While each façade of Quattro Canti is {{pleasing}} to the eye, as a scheme {{it is both}} out of proportion with the limited size of the piazza and, like most other examples of early Sicilian Baroque, can be considered provincial, naive and heavy-handed, compared with later developments. Whatever its merit, {{it is evident that}} during the 17th century, the Baroque style {{in the hands of the}} local architects and sculptors was already deviating from that of mainland Italy. This localised variation on the mainstream Baroque was not <b>peculiar</b> <b>to</b> Sicily, but occurred as far afield as Bavaria, and Russia, where Naryshkin Baroque would be just as eccentric as its Sicilian cousin.|$|E
5|$|Wright's {{scientific}} paintings adopted {{elements from}} {{the tradition of}} history painting but lacked the heroic central action typical of that genre. While ground-breaking, they are regarded as <b>peculiar</b> <b>to</b> Wright, whose unique style has been explained in many ways. Wright's provincial status and ties to the Lunar Society, a group of prominent industrialists, scientists and intellectuals who met regularly in Birmingham between 1765 and 1813, have been highlighted, {{as well as his}} close association with and sympathy for the advances made in the burgeoning Industrial Revolution. Other critics have emphasised a desire to capture a snapshot of the society of the day, in the tradition of William Hogarth but with a more neutral stance that lacks the biting satire of Hogarth's work.|$|E
