This was protested by the Scandinavian and United States jumpers, and a 40-minute discussion broke out. At one point, one of the facilitators at the in-run received a telephone call confirming top speed. The facilitator was skeptical, and chose to call back to the judges, who could confirm {{that they had not}} given such a go-ahead. In the end, the judges chose to allow higher speeds, with a compromise of 5.0meters more distance. However, the facilitator only moved the rope 4.5meters. This made the Swiss furious, and they used their knives to cut the rope. They then accused the <b>participants</b> <b>who</b> <b>were</b> opposed to full speed of being cowards.|$|E

25|$|The {{application}} of a mnemonic is intentional, suggesting {{that in order to}} successfully use a mnemonic device an individual should be aware that the mnemonic can aid his or her memory. Awareness of how a mnemonic facilitates one's memory is an example of metamemory. Wimmer and Tornquist conducted an experiment in which participants were asked to recall a set of items. Participants were made aware of the usefulness of a mnemonic device (categorical grouping) either before or after recall. <b>Participants</b> <b>who</b> <b>were</b> made aware of the usefulness of the mnemonic before recall (displaying metamemory for the mnemonic's usefulness) {{were significantly more likely to}} use the mnemonic than those who were not made aware of the mnemonic before recall.|$|E

25|$|A {{rotator cuff}} tear {{can be caused}} by the {{weakening}} of the rotator cuff tendons. This weakening {{can be caused by}} age or how often the rotator cuff is used. Adults over the age of 60 are more susceptible to a rotator cuff tear. According to a study in the Journal of Orthopaedic Surgery and Traumatology the frequency of rotator cuff tears can increase with age. The study shows the participants that were the ages of 70–90 years old had a rate of rotator cuff tears that were 1 to 5. The <b>participants</b> <b>who</b> <b>were</b> 90+ years old the frequency of a rotator cuff tear jumped to 1 to 3.

25|$|Recent {{research}} on spatial memory and wayfinding {{in an article}} by Ishikawa et al. in 2008 revealed that using a GPS moving map device reduces an individual's navigation abilities {{when compared to other}} <b>participants</b> <b>who</b> <b>were</b> using maps or had previous experience on the route with a guide. GPS moving map devices are frequently set up to allow the user to only see a small detailed close-up of a particular segment of the map which is constantly updated. In comparison, maps usually allow the user to see the same view of the entire route from departure to arrival. Other research has shown that individuals who use GPS travel more slowly overall compared to map users who are faster. GPS users stop more frequently and {{for a longer period of}} time whereas map users and individuals using past experience as a guide travel on more direct routes to reach their goal.|$|E
25|$|Another {{significant}} protest {{related to}} disability rights was the Deaf President Now protest by the Gallaudet University students in Washington, D.C. in March 1988. The 8-day (March 6 – March 13) demonstration and occupation and lock-out {{of the school}} began when the Board of Trustees appointed a new hearing President, Elisabeth Zinser, over two Deaf candidates. The students’ primary grievance was that the university, which was dedicated {{to the education of}} people who are Deaf, had never had a Deaf president, someone representative of them. Of the protesters’ four demands, the main one was the resignation of the current president and the appointment of a Deaf one. The student demonstration consisted of about 2,000 <b>participants</b> <b>who</b> <b>were</b> not just students. The protests not only took place on campus, but they also took it to government buildings and marched through the streets. In the end, all the students’ demands were met and I.

25|$|Politeness is {{one measure}} that {{researchers}} {{have used to}} study human-computer interaction. Being polite is an automatic response in most interpersonal interactions. When a person asks a question about themselves, most people will give a positive response, even if {{it may be a}} dishonest answer, to avoid hurting the other person’s feelings. To test this idea with human-computer interaction, researchers designed an experiment in which participants would work with a computer on a tutoring exercise. The computer would provide them with a fact about American culture and then provide supplemental information. The computer then prompted participants to take a test to evaluate what they have learned. After completing the tests participants were asked to evaluate the computer’s performance. The participants were assigned to one of three conditions – a pencil and paper evaluation, an evaluation on a different computer, or an evaluation on the same computer. The results indicate that <b>participants</b> <b>who</b> <b>were</b> asked to evaluate the same computer gave the computer more positive feedback than the other two conditions. To learn more about this experiment, see Nass, Moon, & Carney, 1999.|$|E
25|$|In 2005, the Home Office {{issued a}} report on {{research}} examining the level {{and nature of the}} use of khat by Somalis in four English cities; Birmingham, Bristol, London and Sheffield. It found that 38 per cent of the respondents had ever used khat in their lifetime, with 58 per cent of men and only 16 per cent of women reporting having ever used it. 34 per cent of the overall sample indicated that they had chewed khat the month before, with 51 per cent all men in the study and 14 per cent of the women having done so. Some reported family tensions arising from their khat use. 49 per cent of those surveyed were in favour of banning khat, with 35 opposed, but the report suggested that this would not be effective. Three quarters of participants who had used khat reported having suffered health effects, although these were mostly mild in nature, with the most common symptoms respondents associated with khat use being sleeping difficulties, loss of appetite, and an urge to chew more khat. The study concluded that most of the <b>participants</b> <b>who</b> <b>were</b> using khat were using it moderately in terms of both the quantity used and the frequency and duration of chewing sessions, and that khat use was typically a social activity. Only a small minority of the study participants' khat use was judged to be excessive. In January 2013, the Advisory Council on the Misuse of Drugs also again cited insufficient evidence that the plant caused serious health or societal problems to warrant governmental control.|$|E

[...] The participant could thus either ignore the majority and go with his own senses or he could go along with the majority and ignore the clearly obvious fact.

According to the advertisements and accompanying mini-documentary, the Whopper was the most popular sandwich among the test subjects. A social media based promotion from Crispin Porter + Bogusky in 2009 gave a free Whopper coupon for every 10 friends on Facebook a user would drop. The advertising program dubbed [...] "Whopper Sacrifice", was stopped after a week when Facebook canceled the Whopper Sacrifice account as a violation of its user privacy policy.

500|$|In {{comparison}} with other contemporary reality television programmes and previous editions of Big Brother, this series has received lower viewing figures and less press coverage. Bookmakers have also reported that this series has attracted the lowest amount of bets placed for any reality programme in the last decade. Four weeks before the programme began, former chat show presenter Michael Parkinson was critical of the programme; [...] "I object to the exploitation of the underclass in shows like Big Brother. It is the modern version of Bedlam, where you pay to see the poor benighted people making asses of themselves". Charlie Brooker of The Guardian said that the series contained forgettable participants and that the producers were alienating the viewers with confusing tasks that seemed to take place [...] "every four minutes". Simmy Richman of The Independent wrote that the programme had become predictable after ten editions {{and that it had}} a [...] "here-we-go-again feel". They also complained that the format had become clichéd and the housemates stereotypical, and they criticised the producers for enrolling <b>participants</b> <b>who</b> <b>were</b> using the programme as [...] "a springboard to a Heat magazine cover and temporary free entry to dodgy nightclubs". Maggie Brown, writing in her book A Licence to be Different — The Story of Channel 4, believed that the programme limited its broadcaster as the cost to produce the programme were not justified by the number of viewers it attracted. Mark Lawson, also writing in The Guardian, suggested that the lack of viewers linked with a tired format and minimal press coverage, claiming that the newspapers had become preoccupied with stories such as the outbreak of swine flu, death of Michael Jackson and MPs' expenses scandal. Lawson also believed that the death of Big Brother 2002 participant Jade Goody prior to the launch of Big Brother 2009 contributed to the low viewing figures. Journalist James Donaghy branded the programme a [...] "sorry atrocity" [...] and celebrity gossip blogger Darryn Lyons said that the series had been [...] "massively disappointing", pinpointing Isaac Stout's entrance as a [...] "desperate stunt" [...] to attract viewers. Despite returning to the House to participate in a task, former housemate Dean O'Loughlin has also been critical of this series, describing it as [...] "way too superficial".|$|E
