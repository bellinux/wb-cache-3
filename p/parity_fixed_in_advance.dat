When both sets of marginal totals are <b>fixed</b> <b>in</b> <b>advance,</b> none of these variants is wholly satisfactory, even with moderately large samples. When one set of marginal totals is <b>fixed</b> <b>in</b> <b>advance</b> while the other is free to vary, or when neither set of marginal totals is <b>fixed</b> <b>in</b> <b>advance,</b> a variant of chi-square proposed by Upton (1982) is to be preferred both theoretically and in practice. The variant proposed by Yates (1934) which incorporates a correction for continuity and which is often recommended in statistics textbooks is theoretically unsound, shows an extremely conservative bias, and lacks sufficient power...|$|R

40|$|The alternating-time {{temporal}} logic (ATL) of Alur, Henzinger and Kupferman is being increasingly widely {{applied in the}} specification and verification of open distributed systems and game-like multi-agent systems. In this article, we investigate the computational complexity of the satisfiability problem for ATL. For the case where the set of agents is <b>fixed</b> <b>in</b> <b>advance,</b> this problem was settled at EXPTIME-complete in a result of van Drimmelen. If the set of agents is not <b>fixed</b> <b>in</b> <b>advance,</b> then van Drimmelen’s construction yields a 2 EXPTIME upper bound. In this article, {{we focus on the}} latter case and define three natural variations of the satisfiability problem. Although none of these variations fixes the set of agents <b>in</b> <b>advance,</b> we are able to prove containment in EXPTIME for all of them by means of a type elimination construction—thus improving the existing 2 EXPTIME upper bound to a tight EXPTIME one. ...|$|R
