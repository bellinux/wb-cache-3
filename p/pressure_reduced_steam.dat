Non-combustion heat sources such as solar power, nuclear power or geothermal energy may be used. The ideal thermodynamic cycle used to analyze this process is called the Rankine cycle.

40|$|Dupont's Marshall Laboratory is an {{automotive}} paint {{research and}} development facility in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. The campus is comprised of several buildings that are served by Trigen-Philadelphia Energy Corporation's district steam loop. In 1996 Dupont management {{announced that it was}} considering moving the facility out of Philadelphia primarily due to the high operating cost compared to where they were considering relocating. The city officials responded by bringing the local electric and gas utilities to the table to negotiate better rates for Dupont. Trigen also requested the opportunity to propose energy savings opportunities, and dedicated a team of engineers to review Dupont's steam system to determine if energy savings could be realized within the steam system infrastructure. As part of a proposal to help Dupont reduce energy costs while continuing to use Trigen's steam, Trigen recommended modifications to increase energy efficiency, <b>reduce</b> <b>steam</b> system maintenance costs and implement small scale cogeneration. These recommendations included <b>reducing</b> the medium <b>pressure</b> <b>steam</b> distribution to low pressure, eliminating the medium pressure to low <b>pressure</b> <b>reducing</b> stations, installing a back pressure steam turbine generator, and preheating the domestic hot water with the condensate. Dupont engineers evaluated these recommended modifications and chose to implement most of them. An analysis of Dupont's past steam consumption revealed that the steam distribution system sizing was acceptable if the <b>steam</b> <b>pressure</b> was <b>reduced</b> from medium to low. After a test of the system and a few modifications, Dupont <b>reduced</b> the <b>steam</b> distribution system to low pressure. Energy efficiency is improved since the heat transfer losses at the low pressure are less than at the medium pressure distribution. Additionally, steam system maintenance will be significantly <b>reduced</b> since 12 <b>pressure</b> <b>reducing</b> stations are eliminated. With the steam pressure reduction now occurring at one location, the opportunity existed to install a backpressure turbine generator adjacent to the primary <b>pressure</b> <b>reducing</b> station. The analysis of Dupont's steam and electric load profiles demonstrated that cost savings could be realized with the installation of 150 kW of self-generation. There were a few obstacles, including meeting the utility's parallel operation requirements, that made this installation challenging. Over two years have passed since the modifications were implemented, and although cost savings are difficult to quantify since process steam use has increased, the comparison of steam consumption to heating degree days shows a reducing trend. Dupont's willingness to tackle energy conservation projects without adversely affecting their process conditions can be an example to other industrial steam users...|$|R

40|$|Steam {{has been}} widely used {{as the source of}} heating in {{commercial}} buildings and industries throughout the twentieth century. Even though contemporary designers have moved to hot water as the primary choice for heating, a large number of facilities still use steam for heating. Medical campuses with on-site steam generation and extensive distribution systems often serve a number of buildings designed prior to the mid- 1980 s. The steam is typically used for preheat as its high thermal content helps in heating the air faster and prevents coils from freezing in locations with extreme weather conditions during winter. The present work provides a comprehensive description of the various types of steam heating systems, steam coils, and valves to facilitate the engineer's understanding of these steam systems. A large percentage of the steam coils used in buildings are provided with medium pressure steam. Veterans Integrated Service Network and Army Medical Command Medical Facilities are examples which use medium pressure steam for heating. The current design manual for these medical facilities recommends steam at 30 psig be provided to these coils. In certain cases although the steam heating coil is designed for a 5 psig steam pressure, it is observed that higher pressure steam is supplied at the coil. A higher steam pressure may lead to excessive heating, system inefficiency due to increased heat loss, simultaneous heating and cooling, and increased maintenance cost. Field experiments were conducted to evaluate the effect of lowering steam pressure on the system performance. A 16 % reduction in temperature rise across the coil was found when the steam pressure in the coil was reduced from 15 psig to 5 psig. The rise in temperature with lower pressure steam was sufficient to prevent coil freeze-up even in the most severe weather conditions. Additional benefits of <b>reduced</b> <b>steam</b> <b>pressure</b> are <b>reduced</b> flash <b>steam</b> losses (flash steam is vapor or secondary steam formed when hot condensate from the coil is discharged into a lower pressure area, i. e., the condensate return line) and radiation losses, increased flow of air through the coil thereby reducing air stratification and reduced energy losses in the event of actuator failure. The work also involved evaluating the existing control strategies for the steam heating system. New control strategies were developed and tested to address the short comings of existing sequences. Improved temperature control and occupant comfort; elimination of valve hunting and reduced energy consumption were benefits realized by implementing these measures...|$|R

40|$|Hydrogen {{fuel cell}} {{electric}} vehicle (FCEV) can achieve zero exhaust emission and zero pollution. In {{order to make}} FCEV reach a farther travel distance, greater demands are put on its <b>pressure</b> <b>reducing</b> system. In this paper, a two-step high <b>pressure</b> <b>reducing</b> system for FCEV is proposed. The system {{is made up of}} two parts, a new high multi-stage <b>pressure</b> <b>reducing</b> valve (HMSPRV) and a multi-stage muffler. As a new system, its feasibility has to be verified. Since the valve opening condition has a great effect on hydrogen flow, pressure reduction and energy consumption, different valve opening conditions are taken as the research point. The flow field analysis of the new HMSPRV is conducted on three aspects: pressure field, velocity field and energy consumption. It can be found that both the <b>pressure</b> <b>reducing</b> and velocity increasing gradients mainly reflect at those throttling components for all valve openings. For energy consumption, in the comprehensive study of flow vortexes and turbulent dissipation rate, it can be found that the larger of the valve opening, the larger of energy consumption. Then, a thermo-fluid-solid coupling analysis is conducted on the new HMSPRV, and it is concluded that the new system meets strength requirement. Furthermore, as the second step of the high <b>pressure</b> <b>reducing</b> system, the flow and pressure fields of multi-stage muffler are investigated. The five-stage muffler is exactly designed to complete the whole <b>pressure</b> <b>reducing</b> process. This study can provide technological support for achieving pressure regulation in the hydrogen transport system of FCEV when facing complex conditions, and it can also benefit the further research work on energy saving and multi-stage flow of <b>pressure</b> <b>reducing</b> devices...|$|R
