25|$|George Hodson, who {{had been}} having lunch in the prison officers' mess near the Number 1 post, responded to Lange's whistle. Bennett shouted to Hodson {{that he had a}} prisoner, Walker, pinned down behind the low church {{boundary}} wall. Hodson headed for Walker and picked up Walker's pipe. Hodson grappled with Walker but the escapee managed to break free so Hodson began hitting him over his head with the piece of pipe. Walker was a faster runner than Hodson, but Hodson continued to chase after Walker with the <b>pipe</b> <b>still</b> in his hand. Both men ran towards the armed Ryan.|$|E
2500|$|Around 11:20pm, while {{preparations}} for the final act were under way, stage manager J. W. Thorpe saw a small flame on the left, or prompt side of the stage. The fire {{was coming from the}} lower part of a drop hanging below the rigging loft near the center stage border-light. The canvas was hanging, partially detached, from its frame and, Thorpe thought, somehow must have slipped past the wire mesh guard of the border lamp and ignited. He estimated its size to be no larger than his hand. Though water in paint buckets was once kept on hand on the stage and in the rigging loft and though a two and a half inch (...) water <b>pipe</b> <b>still</b> serviced a fire hose backstage, none of these facilities was readily available. Thorpe considered the fire hose, but there was much scenery in the way. He decided that the fire would be well under way by the time the hose was in place. He opted to extinguish the flame by whatever means were readily available. He directed carpenters Hamilton Weaver and William Van Sicken to extinguish the flame. They attempted this by beating the fire with long stage poles.|$|E

50|$|The HAMEL pipes {{were also}} valuable, but being less flexible, {{needed to be}} cut into lengths {{on the deck of}} the {{recovery}} ship. Cutting either type of pipeline was very dangerous because the <b>pipes</b> <b>still</b> contained petrol. The contaminated petrol from both types of pipe was recovered and cleaned up, yielding some 66000 imp gal of useful fuel.|$|R
50|$|Though {{the organ}} has been rebuilt and {{enlarged}} several times since 1867, the original iconic casework {{and some of}} Ridges' <b>pipes</b> <b>still</b> remain in the organ today. The current organ is largely the work of G. Donald Harrison of the former Aeolian-Skinner organ firm. It was completed in 1948 and contains 11,623 pipes, 147 voices (tone colors) and 206 ranks (rows of pipes).|$|R

60|$|Sir Charles Bowen {{is to be}} congratulated on {{the success}} of his version. It has both style and {{fidelity}} to recommend it. The metre he has chosen seems to us more suited to the sustained majesty of the AEneid than it is to the pastoral note of the Eclogues. It can bring us something of the strength of the lyre but has hardly caught the sweetness of the <b>pipe.</b> <b>Still,</b> it is in many points a very charming translation, and we gladly welcome it as a most valuable addition to the literature of echoes.|$|E

And the younger son of Mars, conquered by tobacco and whiskey, was leaning his unfortunate head on the table, and deluging Keegan's feet with the shower which he was unable to restrain.|$|E
60|$|Trayton Burleigh {{sat back}} in his chair {{watching}} the smoke of his cigar through half-closed eyes. Occasionally he opened them a little wider and glanced round the comfortable, well-furnished room, or stared with a cold gleam of hatred at Fletcher as he sat sucking stolidly at his brier pipe. It was a comfortable room and a valuable house, half of which belonged to Trayton Burleigh; and yet he was to leave it in the morning and become a rogue and a wanderer over the face of the earth. James Fletcher had said so. James Fletcher, with the <b>pipe</b> <b>still</b> between his teeth and speaking from one corner of his mouth only, had pronounced his sentence.|$|E

When they were about fifty yards away and I was {{preparing}} for the worst, a shot rang out from above and behind me. At the same instant Greybeard threw his arms wide and letting fall the spear he held, pitched from his horse, evidently stone dead. I glanced back and saw Hans, the corn-cob <b>pipe</b> <b>still</b> in his mouth and the little rifle, [...] "Intombi," [...] still at his shoulder. He had fired {{from the back of the}} camel, I think for the first time that day, and whether by chance or through good marksmanship, I do not know, had killed this man.|$|E
6000|$|That {{rats and}} field-mice were sacred in Egypt, then, we may believe on the {{evidence}} of the Ritual, of Strabo, and of many relics of Egyptian art. Herodotus, moreover, is credited when he says that the statue 'had a mouse on its hand.' Elsewhere, it is certain that the story of mice gnawing the bowstrings occurs frequently as an explanation of mouse-worship. One of the Trojan 'mouse-stories' ran--That emigrants had set out in prehistoric times from Crete. The oracle advised them to settle 'wherever they were attacked by the children of the soil.' At Hamaxitus in the Troad, they were assailed in the night by mice, which ate all that was edible of their armour and bowstrings. The colonists made up their mind that these mice were 'the children of the soil,' settled there, and adored the mouse Apollo. {114a} A myth of this sort may either be a story invented to explain the mouse-name; or a Mouse tribe, like the Red Indian Wolves, or Crows, may actually have been settled on the spot, and may even have resisted invasion. {114b} Another myth of the Troad accounted for the worship of the mouse Apollo on the hypothesis that he had once freed the land from mice, like the Pied Piper of Hamelin, whose <b>pipe</b> (<b>still</b> serviceable) {{is said to have been}} found in his grave by men who were digging a mine. {114c} ...|$|E

50|$|In {{its heyday}} in the 1920s, Hempstead House {{revealed}} {{a taste for}} extravagance. In the Entry Foyer was an organ made of oak. The <b>pipes</b> <b>still</b> visible on the walls above were merely for show—the music reverberated through openings in the floors. Medieval tapestries once hung on the walls, and oriental carpets covered the floor. The sunken Palm Court once contained 150 species of rare orchids and other plants. An aviary housed exotic birds in ornate cages among the flowers. The walnut-paneled Library was copied from the palace of King James I; relief portraits of literary figures still decorate the plaster ceiling. The Billiard Room featured a gold leaf ceiling, hand-tooled leather wall covering, and carved oak woodwork from a 17th century Spanish palace.|$|R
60|$|And now the Boer cause {{appeared}} to be visibly tottering to its fall. The flight of the President had accelerated that process of disintegration which had already set in. Schalk Burger had assumed the office of Vice-President, and the notorious Ben Viljoen had become first lieutenant of Louis Botha in maintaining the struggle. Lord Roberts had issued an extremely judicious proclamation, in which he pointed out the uselessness of further resistance, declared that guerilla warfare would be ruthlessly suppressed, and informed the burghers that no fewer than fifteen thousand of their fellow-countrymen were in his hands as prisoners, and {{that none of these}} could be released until the last rifle had been laid down. From all sides in the third week of September the British forces were converging on Komatipoort, the frontier town. Already wild figures, stained and tattered after nearly a year of warfare, were walking the streets of Lourenco Marques, gazed at with wonder and some distrust by the Portuguese inhabitants. The exiled burghers moodily pacing the streets saw their exiled President seated in his corner of the Governor's verandah, the well-known curved <b>pipe</b> <b>still</b> dangling from his mouth, the Bible by his chair. Day by day the number of these refugees increased. On September 17th special trains were arriving crammed with the homeless burghers, and with the mercenaries of many nations--French, German, Irish-American, and Russian--all anxious to make their way home. By the 19th no fewer than seven hundred had passed over.|$|E
6000|$|He helped Anne upstairs, {{left her}} {{in the hands of}} a maid, and came down again to the drawing-room. He was {{surprised}} to find them all sitting just where he had left them. He had expected that, somehow, everything would be quite different--it seemed such a prodigious time since he went away. All silent and all damned, he reflected, as he looked at them. Mr. Scogan's <b>pipe</b> <b>still</b> wheezed; that was the only sound. Henry Wimbush was still deep in his account books; he had just made the discovery that Sir Ferdinando was in the habit of eating oysters the whole summer through, regardless of the absence of the justifying R. Gombauld, in horn-rimmed spectacles, was reading. Jenny was mysteriously scribbling in her red notebook. And, seated in her favourite arm-chair at the corner of the hearth, Priscilla was looking through a pile of drawings. One by one she held them out at arm's length and, throwing back her mountainous orange head, looked long and attentively through half-closed eyelids. She wore a pale sea-green dress; on the slope of her mauve-powdered decolletage diamonds twinkled. An immensely long cigarette-holder projected at an angle from her face. Diamonds were embedded in her high-piled coiffure; they glittered every time she moved. It was a batch of Ivor's drawings--sketches of Spirit Life, made in the course of tranced tours through the other world. On the back of each sheet descriptive titles were written: [...] "Portrait of an Angel, 15th March '20;" [...] "Astral Beings at Play, 3rd December '19;" [...] "A Party of Souls on their Way to a Higher Sphere, 21st May '21." [...] Before examining the drawing on the obverse of each sheet, she turned it over to read the title. Try as she could--and she tried hard--Priscilla had never seen a vision or succeeded in establishing any communication with the Spirit World. She had to be content with the reported experiences of others.|$|E
