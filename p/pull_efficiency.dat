40|$|This study {{deals with}} {{industrial}} trends in tunnelling by drill and blast (D&B). We perform a {{statistical analysis of}} accumulated experience from the 1950 s to the modern day to provide advice for proper project management in tunnel driving. The basis {{of the study is}} a wide database of tunnel blast schemes. This database is made of excavation parameters, and considers two main families of blasts: with parallel hole cuts and with inclined hole cuts. Such parameters are analysed by means of statistical regression. Correlations are shown. We present a general curve of correlation between tunnel sections and specific drilling and specific explosive consumption. We show how <b>pull</b> <b>efficiency</b> cannot be correlated to a single parameter, and how tunnelling by D&B needs to be treated as a complex system. Finally, we propose a method for quantifying and classifying the difficulty of tunnelling. The deviation of specific drilling (SD) from industrial average trend is used as an indicator of difficulty: easier when SD is lower than average, and more difficult when SD is higher than average. We show how such deviation can be preliminarily associated with lithotypes. This provides to designers and cost estimators a tool of a first approximation for D&B cost prediction at the pre-feasability and feasibility stages of a tunnelling project...|$|E

50|$|This {{requires}} the locomotives to constantly work {{near the edge}} of their power reserve when <b>pulling</b> and <b>efficiency</b> is coincidentally the highest in that region. Extensive preventive maintenance procedures developed by MÁV depots allowed the V43 to serve 40+ years reliably, despite of being maxed out most of the time.|$|R
40|$|An {{appropriate}} {{additional load}} of driving wheels {{is very important}} for an efficient use of engine output. This additional load influences significantly the driving momentum and, thus, the <b>pulling</b> <b>efficiency</b> of the tractor. This pulling force is dependent on adhesion forces influencing the driving wheels and {{it can be said that}} the higher this adhesion force (i. e. the higher additional load), the higher the adhesion force and the higher the engine output. In this paper the authors present results of measurements of the pulling characteristics on a roller dynamometer. The measurements were performed in two variants, viz. (i) with additional loading only when using the basic load and (ii) with an additional load simulating the load of a plough. The measured parameters demonstrated that the additional loading either increased the tractor‘s pulling strength or reduced the slippage of wheels. The increase in the pulling strength was manifested especially when using lower gears. The obtained results documented the importance of additional loading. From the practical point of view this additional load influenced above all operation with attached or pulled machines. If the regulatory systems of tractor’s three-point suspension are correctly used, it is possible to transfer automatically a part of machine weight to the driving wheels and to increase the tractor’s pulling strength. A graphical presentation of obtained results (i. e. without and with the additional load can provide quite concrete output values, which document the economic advantages resulting from a correct selection of tractor’s operational mode...|$|R
40|$|Lotus-compatible {{templates}} were revised {{from the}} Zoz (1987) spreadsheets. Performance of two-wheel-drive (2 WD) and four-wheel-drive/mechanical-front¬wheel-drive (4 WD/MFWD) tractors were predicted on agricultural soils for radial tractor tires. Comparisons between the predicted and experimental results of 41 tractors using radial tractor tires showed fair agreement. The performance parameters {{used in the}} comparisons were wheel slip, drawbar <b>pull</b> and tractive <b>efficiency.</b> The percentage differences were calculated and the acceptable range was set at 20 % difference. For wheel slip, 22 out of 41 tractors had percentage differences that fell within the acceptable range. The drawbar pull comparison showed that 35 out of the 41 tractors had percent differences within the acceptable range. The tractive efficiency comparison showed that 27 out of 33 tractors had percentage differences that fell within the 20 % range. The predicted drawbar <b>pull</b> and tractive <b>efficiency</b> were higher than the experimental values in most cases of MFWD tractors. Because some input values for the spreadsheet such as available power, cone index and travel speed were not given in the source of data, the predicted results of tractor performance were not in close agreement to experimental results...|$|R
40|$|Workplace {{democracy}} is 'an evolving reality' reflected in an organization's daily practices {{to deal with}} dilemmas. This article examines the inherent tensions and conflicts of practising workplace democracy in three women workers' cooperatives in Hong Kong. The co-ops were young and supported by non-governmental organizations. Based on interviews and participant observation, {{it was found that}} on balance, these co-ops were tilted towards democracy at the expense of efficiency. The analyses suggest that as these co-ops grow and develop, to sustain democracy in the long term, they may need {{to pay more attention to}} efficiency issues. Although the <b>pull</b> towards <b>efficiency</b> can lead to the emergence of a managerial elite group, thus contributing to a degeneration of democracy, paradoxically, to revive democracy, some form and function of leadership and management, collectively agreed, need to be established.

40|$|The mode of {{road freight}} {{transportation}} changes from single vehicle transport to drop and <b>pull</b> transport. The <b>efficiency,</b> safety, {{and reliability of}} coupling between semi-trailer towing vehicle and semi-trailers {{is the key to}} developing drop and pull transport. Some technical clauses of standards on connection between semi-trailer towing vehicle and semi-trailers are not suitable requirements for drop and pull transport, and application status is not optimistic. This paper puts forward some suggestions based on analysis of articulated vehicle dimensions, interchangeability between semi-trailer towing vehicle and semi-trailers, electrical and pneumatic connector, fifth wheel kingpin, trailer landing gears, and so on, that would provide a reference to revise the relevant standards.

40|$|A {{comparison}} between a traditional ploughing and a spading (performed at different travelling and rotor speeds) {{was carried out}} in a paddy field, for evaluating both technical and agronomic parameters (working time, power required, fuel consumption, <b>pulling</b> force, <b>efficiency</b> of crop residues incorporation, etc.). The ploughing showed an effective tillage capacity 51 % higher than the faster spading, and a reduction ranging between 20. 8 and 44. 1 % of fuel consumption per surface unit. On the contrary, the spading machine requested no or minimum pulling force, making possible its use even in critical conditions, as for example on wet soil. On the other hand, the spading machine shows clear advantages under the agronomic point of view: in fact it does not create the typical compact layer {{at the bottom of the}} working depth, which reduces the root penetration and does not allow the capillary circulation of the solution into the soil. Indeed, in the paddy field the creation of a compact layer is able to reduce the water consumption, so it is not considered a problem to be solved. In any case, the spading machine better managed the crop residues, because they were mixed along the completely tilled layer...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} {{the geography of}} regional competitiveness in manufacturing in Brazil. The authors estimate stochastic frontiers to calculate regional efficiency of representative firms in 137 regions in the period 2000 - 2006, in four sectors defined by technological intensity. The efficiency results are analyzed using Markov Spatial Transition Matrices to provide insights into the transition of regions between efficiency levels, considering their local spatial context. The results indicate that geography {{plays an important role}} in manufacturing competitiveness. In particular, regions with more competitive neighbors are more likely to improve their relative <b>efficiency</b> (<b>pull</b> effect) over time, and regions with less competitive neighbors are more likely to lose relative efficiency (drag effect). The authors find that the pull effect is stronger than the drag effect. spatial markov Chains; neighborhood and efficiency; manufacturing; stochastic production frontier; production function...|$|R
40|$|The authors {{conducted}} a comparative test {{to determine whether}} the introduction of a hydraulic slack puller allowed reducing the physiological workload of operators assigned to log winching tasks. The tests were conducted in northern Italy, on the mountains near Como. The study involved five volunteer subjects, considered representatives of the regional logging workforce. Physiological workload was determined by measuring the operators’ heart rate upon completion of specific tasks. The slack <b>puller</b> improved the <b>efficiency</b> of downhill winching, since it allowed a single operator to pull out the cable on his own, without requiring the assistance of a colleague. However, introduction of the slack puller did not result in any reductions of operator physiological workload. The main stressor when working on a steep slope is moving up and down the slope: pulling a cable is only a secondary stressor. Any measures targeting secondary stressors are unlikely to produce dramatic reductions of operator workload...|$|R
40|$|Objective: To compare process {{designs of}} three {{high-volume}} cataract pathways in a lean thinking framework {{and to explore}} how efficiency in terms of lead times, hospital visits and costs is related to process design. Design: International retrospective comparative benchmark study with a mixed-method design. Setting: Three eye hospitals in the UK, the USA and the Netherlands participated in this study. All are major international tertiary care and training centres in ophthalmology. Participants: Data on all patients who underwent first eye cataract surgery in 2006 were used. Interventions: The study related six operational aspects of lean thinking in the process design to efficiency. Outcome measures: Measures of lean aspects were operational focus, autonomous work cell, physical lay-out of resources, multi-skilled team, pull planning and elimination of wastes. Efficiency was measured with lead times (access time plus waiting time for surgery), hospital visits and direct costs. Results: Operational focus was influenced by external circumstances leading to different orientations on <b>efficiency.</b> <b>Pull</b> planning with integrating activities in one-stop procedures conducted by multi-skilled nurses as well as eliminating wastes reduced both the number of hospital visits and costs. Short lead times {{were associated with the}} use of a general outpatient clinic and a high-volume cataract surgery clinic. Conclusions: The environmental context and operational focus primarily influenced process design of the cataract pathways. When pressed to further optimize their processes, hospitals can use these systematic benchmarking data to decrease the frequency of hospital visits, lead times and costs...|$|R
40|$|The {{performance}} of tuned mass dampers (TMDs), {{widely used in}} civil engineering, depends on their state parameters. Therefore {{the evolution of the}} controlled structure and the evolution of the type of excitation may <b>pull</b> down the <b>efficiency</b> of this kind of device. Active tuned mass dampers (ATMDs) have been widely explored for damping the dynamic response of bridges under construction and submitted to various types of external excitations such as wind. However in view of permanent control of bridges under operation, active devices suffer from several drawbacks such as the necessity of an important source of external energy that must always be available. In this paper a new type of semi-active control system based on an electromechanical device is presented. This semi-active tool consists of a pendulum coupled to an alternator. The alternator converts the mechanical energy of the oscillating pendulum into electrical energy to be dissipated through an exterior resistor via Joule effect. Given an optimal design of a reference pendulum TMD for the structure in its current configuration, the semi-active control consists in changing the resistor in real-time in such a way to lock the apparent stiffness and damping of the real TMD at their desired optimal values at each construction step and for each type of external excitation. Detailed experimental studies on a small-scale bridge mock-up show the effectiveness of this semi-active control device and validates the capability of the semi-active control law to make the {{performance of}} the actuator independent of the structural evolution and of type of the external excitation...|$|R
40|$|Off-road {{mobility}} {{defines the}} ability of land-based vehicles to accelerate, pull loads and climb gradients. Historically, {{much of the work}} completed to relate mobility to vehicle and terrain characteristics has been empirical in nature, and has therefore been susceptible to errors caused by the inherent variability of naturally occurring soils. This thesis addresses the off-road mobility of wheeled vehicles, and in particular the use of a finite element (FE) based approach to predict performance metrics such as rolling resistance, drawbar <b>pull</b> and tractive <b>efficiency.</b> Tools to predict these measures of performance have a wide range of applications, including military, agricultural and leisure vehicles, aircraft operating from temporary airfields and planetary landing craft. The current study extends the virtual proving ground (VPG) concept, where a single vehicle model can be subjected to a series of virtual test conditions, to include the assessment of off-road mobility. Throughout, modelling has been carried out using LS-DYNA, a commercially available non-linear dynamic analysis code. Unlike previous studies using FE techniques to investigate wheel / soil interaction, an Eulerian representation of the soil has been employed, which permits a consistent approach to be applied to both purely cohesive and purely frictional soils, as well as those displaying a combination of cohesive and frictional behaviour. At each stage of the research, the validity of the FE-based modelling approach has been assessed using data from controlled experimental testing at Cranfield University’s off-road dynamics facility. A key finding of the work completed is that rate sensitivity in moisture containing soils can significantly affect the accuracy of (empirical, analytical and numerical) model predictions, even at low translational speeds (less than 0. 1 m/s). This finding highights the adverse impact of simplifications in many previous experimental and modelling studies, which have assumed that rate effects may be ignored providing the translational speed of the vehicle is low...|$|R
40|$|The {{increasing}} {{environmental concerns}} mostly {{due to the}} depletion of fossil fuels {{and a great deal}} of airborne pollution have been the prime topics of interest for the researchers. This has led to the development of new transportation alternatives which are in line with the "Go Green" manifesto. One such development is the concept of human powered vehicles (HPVs), transportation machines that use human power as the source of its energy for locomotion. Further development has led to inclusion of ergonomics and aesthetics into their design, which aim at higher value and efficiency. Aerodynamic drag is a major element of obstruction in the efficiency of these vehicles which mostly run by pedalling. The major area of research in this present work will therefore be the optimised design of the fairing, an element of the HPV that contributes heavily to its aerodynamics since it determines the exterior shape of the vehicle. Taking vehicle performance as the major topic of concern, aerodynamic aspects can sometimes turn out to be a greater deciding factor than the mechanical aspects of an HPV because of the immense magnitude of drag experienced by a moving vehicle. This drag reduces the motion to the power transferred ratio, which in turn indicates a drop in efficiency. This raises the requirement of a study which is specially focussed on the aerodynamics of such a vehicle. This would help enhance the comfort for the driver and also aid in <b>pulling</b> up the <b>efficiency</b> of the vehicle. Fairing being the external cover also plays a pivotal role in enhancing its aesthetics. The study conducted was used for fabrication of the vehicles presented in the Human Powered Vehicle Challenge India' 14 (HPVC) organised at New Delhi and later the results obtained from the competition were used for the new vehicle, which participated in HPVC East’ 14 organised at University of Central Florida, USA...|$|R
40|$|Energy {{is always}} the {{important}} material for economic growth and social development. A new index of energy efficiency called total factor energy efficiency (TFEE) consists of energy, capital, labor and other input that produce GDP as output. TFEE index is accounted by DEA through multiple input-output frameworks. Malmquist index measures productivity changing in two periods. Then decomposed the Malmquist index into efficiency change (EFFCH) and technical change (TECH) to estimate whether EFFCH or TECH influence TFEE. This paper analyze the energy consumption of two provinces and one city in Yangtze River Delta region, {{in terms of the}} quality of energy consumption and intensity of energy consumption. It shows that the increasing rate of energy consumption in the Yangtze River Delta was slowing down by using the absolute quantity of energy consumed in the region and its proportion in the country. Then the total factor energy efficiency of the Yangtze River Delta region was estimated by using the Yangtze River Delta region's energy consumption and economic growth data during from 1992 to 2010, based on DEA-Malmquist. The changes of total factor energy efficiency can be decomposed in energy efficiency and find the energy efficiency trends. The empirical results show that the Yangtze River Delta region, due to technological progress and technical <b>efficiency,</b> <b>pulls</b> together all the elements of energy efficiency. With time as a dimension, from 1992 to 2008, the TFEE is greater than 1, which means that the TFP is increasing and reaches the efficient frontier in the Yangtze River Delta Region. In a deeper analysis, the trend of total factor energy efficiency shows a W pattern, with the high point appearing in 1998 and 2007 by 5. 4 % and 5. 2 % respectively. And the main cause is the technical progress. With region as a dimension, from 1992 to 2008, the TFEE of the provinces and one city in the Yangtze River Delta Region are greater than 1. It indicates that the TFE climbs and reaches the efficient frontier. However, in Shanghai the TFEE is 1. 060 which is the highest, followed by Jiangsu and Zhejiang...|$|R
