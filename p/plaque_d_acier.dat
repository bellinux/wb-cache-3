They account {{for up to}} 75 % to 80 % of all cutaneous lymphomas. The current WHO-EORTC classification of cutaneous lymphomas with primary cutaneous manifestations lists 13 entities. The most common subtypes—mycosis fungoides, Clinical features MF is typically a chronic, slowly progressing disease with an indolent evolution. The disease {{is characterized by the}} development of patches, plaques or tumors (Figure 1; see Color Figures, page 513). The typical patch is a flat, annu-lar, scaly skin lesion mimicking eczema, psoriasis, or der-matophyte infection. It is often erythematous to violaceous in color and has a predilection for sun-protected areas, in-cluding the lower abdomen, upper thighs, buttocks, and female breasts. These initial lesions may spontaneously regress and recur. Patches are highly variable and can give rise to or coexist with plaques, which are raised, palpable skin lesions (Figure 1 a and 1 b; see Color Figures page 513).

40|$|This {{study was}} {{performed}} to evaluate {{the effect of a}} glucose rinse and of plaque accumulation on pH of tooth surface in healthy adolescents with a device used in gastroenterology and never tested in the oral cavity. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Values of pH were monitored in 12 adolescents using a portable device (pH-day 2 ® Menfis, bioMedica S. r. l., Bologna, Italy) with a disposable antimonium electrode kept in contact with the interproximal surface of the upper molars for 40 minutes respectively before and after a one-minute rinse with 10 ml of a 10 % glucose solution. The same procedure was repeated in the same subjects after 72 hours of plaque accumulation. The device tested resulted difficult to use on the tooth surface because {{of the size of the}} active part of the probe. The glucose rinse caused a statistically significant decrease of the mean pH, restrained in basal conditions (d = - 0. 16, p < 0. 05), clinically relevant after <b>plaque</b> accumulation (<b>d</b> = - 1. 24, p < 0. 05). Time in minutes of pH < 6 grew considerably only in case of combination of plaque accumulation and glucose rinse (d = 20. 90, p < 0. 05). A Stephan's curve of drop and recover of the pH values was not recorded. The continuous recording of pH of natural plaque present on the tooth could represent an alternative to other techniques found in literature. More studies are necessary to verify the suitability of this new device for the monitoring of pH in the oral cavity...|$|R
40|$|The anti-phenyltrimethylamino (TMA) {{response}} in A/J mice {{is characterized by}} a cross-reactive idiotype(s) (CRI) that appears linked to the Ig-Ie allotype. These findings made it attractive to look for a CRI on T cells reactive to the same TMA determinant. Thus a suppressor T-cell (Ts) assay specific for L-tyrosine-p-azophenyltrimethylammonium [tyr(TMA) ] was developed. A/J mice were primed with either tyr(TMA) in complete Freund's adjuvant (CFA), L-tyrosine-azobenzenearsonate [tyr(ABA) ] in CFA, or with CFA alone. 6 wk later all mice were inoculated with TMA-bovine serum albumin (BSA) in CFA, boosted with soluble TMA-BSA 3 wk later, and <b>plaqued</b> 7 <b>d</b> after the soluble boost. Priming with tyr(TMA) in CFA resulted in 66 % suppression of anti-TMA plaque-forming cells (PFC) as compared with control groups primed with tyr(ABA) in CFA or CFA alone. The suppression was shown to be mediated by Ts, as only T cells but not B cells from suppressed animals transfer the suppression in adoptive cell transfer experiments into lethally irradiated recipients. The profile of the anti-TMA PFC in the suppressed and nonsuppressed animals was examined via incorporation of anti-idiotypic sera (specific for CRI-TMA) into the plaquing medium. The results of these experiments indicate that the suppression of the major CRI+-TMA PFC was virtually complete, whereas the CRI [...] TMA PFC are left intact. When A/J mice were primed with idiotypic antisera (anti- Id) or normal rabbit serum (NRS) rather than with the antigen on CFA alone, and the same protocol was followed thereafter, the anti-Id- inoculated mice were suppressed by 63 % when compared with the NRS- primed controls. Again the suppression could be accounted for by the exclusive elimination of CRI+ anti-TMA PFC. The possibility that the antigen-induced idiotype suppression may result from idiotypic restrictions between interacting CRI+-Ts and CRT+-B cells will be discussed...|$|R
40|$|The {{traditional}} re storative {{approach to}} active dentin carie s in th e temporary dentition is questioned. This paper argues {{in favour of}} a causal approach. The causal approach focuses on caries m anagement. Restoration is of secondary im portance. Delay or replacement of invasive re storative treatm ent by a causal approach decreases d iscomfort for ch ildren and promotes oral health over time. A form of causal treatment is the so called ‘Non-Res torative Cavity Treatment’. This approach requires that some m easures be taken for managing cavitated caries lesions: 1. written informed consent; 2. m aking the cavity accessible for plaque removal; 3. treating carious dentition with anti-cariogenic agents and/or applying a protective layer to the carious dentition; 4. m onitoring the caries process; 5. effective communication about dental h ealth education. Some d iagnostic criteria are im portant for th e risk as ses sment of cavitated les ions : 1. activity of the caries les ion; 2. acces s ibility of the caries les ion for <b>plaque</b> control; 3. <b>d</b> epth of the cavity; 4. condition of the pulp.

40|$|Abstract Objective Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a {{progressive}} neurodegenerative {{disease of the}} central nervous system (CNS). Recently, an increased interest in the role diet plays in the pathology of AD has resulted in a focus on the detrimental effects of diets high in cholesterol and fat and the beneficial effects of caloric restriction. The current study examines how dietary composition modulates cerebral amyloidosis and neuronal integrity in the TgCRND 8 mouse model of AD. Methods From 4 wks until 18 wks of age, male and female TgCRND 8 mice were maintained on one of four diets: (1) reference (regular) commercial chow; (2) high fat/low carbohydrate custom chow (60 kcal% fat/ 30 kcal% protein/ 10 kcal% carbohydrate); (3) high protein/low carbohydrate custom chow (60 kcal% protein/ 30 kcal% fat/ 10 kcal% carbohydrate); or (4) high carbohydrate/low fat custom chow (60 kcal% carbohydrate/ 30 kcal% protein/ 10 kcal% fat). At age 18 wks, mice were sacrificed, and brains studied for (a) wet weight; (b) solubilizable Aβ content by ELISA; (c) amyloid <b>plaque</b> burden; (<b>d)</b> stereologic analysis of selected hippocampal subregions. Results Animals receiving a high fat diet showed increased brain levels of solubilizable Aβ, although we detected no effect on plaque burden. Unexpectedly, brains of mice fed a high protein/low carbohydrate diet were 5 % lower in weight than brains from all other mice. In an effort to identify regions that might link loss of brain mass to cognitive function, we studied neuronal density and volume in hippocampal subregions. Neuronal density and volume in the hippocampal CA 3 region of TgCRND 8 mice tended to be lower in TgCRND 8 mice receiving the high protein/low carbohydrate diet than in those receiving the regular chow. Neuronal density and volume were preserved in CA 1 and in the dentate gyrus. Interpretation Dissociation of Aβ changes from brain mass changes raises the possibility that diet plays a role not only in modulating amyloidosis but also in modulating neuronal vulnerability. However, {{in the absence of a}} study of the effects of a high protein/low carbohydrate diet on nontransgenic mice, one cannot be certain how much, if any, of the loss of brain mass exhibited by high protein/low carbohydrate diet-fed TgCRND 8 mice was due to an interaction between cerebral amyloidosis and diet. Given the recent evidence that certain factors favor the maintenance of cognitive function in the face of substantial structural neuropathology, we propose that there might also exist factors that sensitize brain neurons to some forms of neurotoxicity, including, perhaps, amyloid neurotoxicity. Identification of these factors could help reconcile the poor clinicopathological correlation between cognitive status and structural neuropathology, including amyloid pathology. </p...|$|R
40|$|Herpes simplex virus (HSV) ICP 0 can {{effectively}} activate gene expression from otherwise silent promoters contained on persisting viral genomes. However, {{the expression of}} high levels of ICP 0, as from ICP 4 − HSV type 1 (HSV- 1) vectors, results in marked toxicity. We have analyzed the results of ICP 0 expressed from an E 1 − E 4 − adenovirus vector (AdS. 11 E 4 ICP 0) in which ICP 0 expression is controlled from the endogenous adenoviral E 4 promoter. In this system, the expression level of ICP 0 was reduced more than 1, 000 -fold relative {{to the level of}} expression from HSV- 1 vectors. This low level of ICP 0 did not affect cellular division or greatly perturb cellular metabolism as assessed by gene expression array analysis comparing the effects of HSV and adenovirus vector strains. However, this amount of ICP 0 was sufficient to quantitatively destroy ND 10 structures as measured by promyelocytic leukemia immunofluorescence. The levels of adenovirus-expressed ICP 0 were sufficient to activate quiescent viral genomes in trans and promote persistent transgene expression in cis. Moreover, infection of complementing cells with AdS. 11 E 4 ICP 0 promoted viral growth and resulted in a 20 -fold increase in the <b>plaquing</b> efficiency of <b>d</b> 109, a virus defective for all five immediate-early genes. Thus, the low level expression of ICP 0 from the E 1 − E 4 − adenovirus vector may increase the utility of adenovirus vectors and also provides a means to efficiently quantify and possibly propagate HSV vectors defective in ICP 0. Importantly, the results demonstrate that the activation function of ICP 0 may not result from changes in cellular gene expression, but possibly as a direct consequence of an enzymatic function inherent to the protein that may involve its action at ND 10 resulting in the preferential activation of viral genomes...|$|R
40|$|Lui J, Corbet EF, Jin L. Combined {{photodynamic}} and low-level laser therapies as {{an adjunct}} to nonsurgical treatment of chronic periodontitis. J Periodont Res 2011; 46 : 89 - 96. © 2010 John Wiley & Sons A/S Background and Objective: In recent years, there has been a growing interest in the use of dental lasers for treatment of periodontal diseases. The purpose of this short-term clinical trial was to evaluate the effects of a combination of photodynamic therapy with low-level laser therapy {{as an adjunct}} to nonsurgical treatment of chronic periodontitis. Material and Methods: Twenty-four nonsmoking adults with untreated chronic periodontitis were randomly assigned in a split-mouth design to receive scaling and root debridement with or without one course of adjunctive photodynamic therapy and low-level laser therapy within 5 <b>d.</b> <b>Plaque,</b> bleeding on probing, probing depth and gingival recession were recorded at baseline, 1 and 3 mo after the treatment. Gingival crevicular fluid was collected for assay of interleukin- 1 β levels at baseline, 1 wk and 1 mo. Results: The test teeth achieved greater reductions in the percentage of sites with bleeding on probing and in mean probing depth at 1 mo compared with the control teeth (p < 0. 05). A significant decrease in gingival crevicular fluid volume was observed in both groups at 1 wk (p < 0. 001), with a further decrease at 1 mo in the test sites (p < 0. 05). The test sites showed a greater reduction of interleukin- 1 β levels in gingival crevicular fluid at 1 wk than the control sites (p < 0. 05). No significant differences in periodontal parameters were found between the test and control teeth at 3 mo. Conclusions: The present study suggests that a combined course of photodynamic therapy with low-level laser therapy could be a beneficial adjunct to nonsurgical treatment of chronic periodontitis on a short-term basis. Further studies are required to assess the long-term effectiveness of the combination of photodynamic therapy with low-level laser therapy as an adjunct in nonsurgical treatment of periodontitis. © 2010 John Wiley & Sons A/S. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
