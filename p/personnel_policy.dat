With private capital and a legacy from Matthes' mother, they founded the Nederlandsche Oliefabriek NV, and built a factory next to the yeast factory. In 1885, they took over [...] Delftse Lijm & Gelatinefabriek NV. Jacques van Marken officially acted as sole manager. To operate a purchasing cooperative in Agnetapark, they founded the Cooperative Winkelvereeniging in 1873. In 1892 they also founded a printing company, which now {{is owned by the}} Koninklijke Drukkerij GJ Thieme. In all these companies, Matthes was instrumental in decision making, planning and organisation. The couple pursued the same <b>personnel</b> <b>policy</b> as in the Gist & Spiritusfabriek. In 1878, they established the first works council of the Netherlands, called, [...] "de Kern" [...] (the kernel). At the height of their success in 1885, when they employed approximately 1,250 employees, their companies were collectively known as, the Delftsche Nijverheid (Delft Industry).|$|E

Despite the dual contracting problem, properly constructed <b>personnel</b> <b>policies</b> can encourage intrinsically motivated public sector employees to invest in expertise, seek promotion, remain in the public sector, and develop policy projects. However, doing so requires internal <b>personnel</b> <b>policies</b> that sort "slackers " from "zealots.

As of 2012, all of their homes are still standing and all are classified as historic buildings. Their last home, to which they moved on 3 June 1885, was a villa in Agnetapark, Delft. When Matthes learnt that their marriage would be childless, she decided to dedicate her life to her husband's business and career, and participated in the establishment and management operation. She accompanied her husband to the factory every day, having her own office. She also continued to have private lessons. In addition to administrative activities, their main interests were <b>personnel</b> <b>policy</b> issues. Matthes and van Marken maintained close contact with the employees of the factory and their families, which appealed to the couple's sense of community; {{they wanted to be}} part [...] "of a larger whole".

Brezhnev phoned Khrushchev, {{and asked him to}} meet him in Moscow. There, a convened Central Committee voted Khrushchev out of office, both as First Secretary of the Central Committee and Chairman of the Council of Ministers. At the beginning, Brezhnev's principal rival was Nikolai Podgorny, a member of the Secretariat. Podgorny was later [...] "promoted" [...] to the Chairmanship of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union, and Andrei Kirilenko replaced him as Secretary in charge of <b>personnel</b> <b>policy.</b> At the same time, Alexander Shelepin, another rival, was replaced as Chairman of the Party-State Control Commission and lost his post as Deputy Chairman of the Council of Ministers.

2500|$|On July 16, 2012, Mayer was {{appointed}} president and CEO of Yahoo!, effective the following day. She {{is also a}} member of the company's board of directors. To simplify the bureaucratic process and [...] "make the culture the best version of itself", Mayer launched a new online program called PB It collects employee complaints, as well as their votes on problems in the office; if a problem generates at least 50 votes, online management automatically investigates the matter. In February 2013, Mayer oversaw a major <b>personnel</b> <b>policy</b> change at Yahoo! that required all remote-working employees to convert to in-office roles. Having worked from home toward the end of her pregnancy, Mayer returned to work after giving birth to a boy, and built a mother's room next to her office suite—Mayer was consequently criticized for the telecommuting ban. In April 2013, Mayer changed Yahoo!'s maternity leave policy, lengthening its time allowance and providing a cash bonus to parents. CNN noted this was in line with other Silicon Valley companies, such as Facebook and Google. Mayer has been criticized for many of her management decisions in pieces by The New York Times and The New Yorker.|$|E
2500|$|The Organisational Bureau, usually {{abbreviated}} Orgburo, was {{an executive}} party organ. The Central Committee organised the Orgburo. Under Lenin, the Orgburo met at least 3 times a week, {{and it was}} obliged {{to report to the}} Central Committee every second week. The Orgburo directed all organisational tasks of the party. In the words of Lenin, [...] "the Orgburo allocates forces, while the Politburo decides policy." [...] In theory, the Orgburo decided all policies relating to administrative and personnel related issues. Decisions reached by the Orgburo would in turn be implemented by the Secretariat. The Secretariat could formulate and decide policies on party administration and personnel if all Orgburo members agreed with the decision. The Politburo frequently meddled in the affairs of the Orgburo, and became active in deciding administrative and <b>personnel</b> <b>policy.</b> Even so, the Orgburo remained an independent organ during Lenin's time, even if the Politburo could veto its resolutions. The Orgburo was an active and dynamic organ, and was in practice responsible for personnel selection for high-level posts; personnel selection for unimportant posts or lower-tier posts were the unofficial responsibility of the Secretariat. However, the Orgburo was gradually eclipsed by the Secretariat. The Orgburo was abolished in 1952 at the 19th Party Congress.|$|E
2500|$|Just {{as there}} are no rights to paid annual leave or maximum hours, there are no rights to paid time off for child care or family leave in federal law. There are minimal rights in some states. Most {{collective}} agreements, and many individual contracts, provide paid time off, but employees who lack bargaining power will often get none. There are, however, limited federal rights to unpaid leave for family and medical reasons. The Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993 generally applies to employers of 50 or more employees in 20 weeks of the last year, and gives rights to employees who have worked over 12 months and 1250 hours in the last year. Employees can have up to 12 weeks of unpaid leave for child birth, adoption, {{to care for a}} close relative in poor health, or because of an employee's own poor health. Child care leave should be taken in one lump, unless agreed otherwise. Employees must give notice of 30 days to employers if birth or adoption is [...] "foreseeable", and for serious health conditions if practicable. Treatments should be arranged [...] "so as not to disrupt unduly the operations of the employer" [...] according to medical advice. Employers must provide benefits during the unpaid leave. Under §2652(b) states are empowered to provide [...] "greater family or medical leave rights". In 2016 California, New Jersey, Rhode Island and New York had laws for paid family leave rights. Under §2612(2)(A) an employer can make an employee substitute the right to 12 unpaid weeks of leave for [...] "accrued paid vacation leave, personal leave or family leave" [...] in an employer's <b>personnel</b> <b>policy.</b> Originally the Department of Labor had a penalty to make employers notify employees that this might happen. However, five judges in the US Supreme Court in Ragsdale v Wolverine World Wide, Inc held that the statute precluded the right of the Department of Labor to do so. Four dissenting judges would have held that nothing prevented the rule, and it was the Department of Labor's job to enforce the law. After unpaid leave, an employee generally has the right to return to his or her job, except for employees who are in the top 10% of highest paid and the employer can argue refusal [...] "is necessary to prevent substantial and grievous economic injury to the operations of the employer." [...] Employees or the Secretary of Labor can bring enforcement actions, but there is no right to a jury for reinstatement claims. Employees can seek damages for lost wages and benefits, or the cost of child care, plus an equal amount of liquidated damages unless an employer can show it acted in good faith and reasonable cause to believe it was not breaking the law. There is a two-year limit on bringing claims, or three years for willful violations. Despite the lack of rights to leave, there is no right to free child care or day care. This has encouraged several proposals to create a public system of free child care, or for the government to subsize parents' costs.|$|E
