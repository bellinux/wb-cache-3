5000|$|Sixteen {{years since}} his escape from New York, Snake {{is once again}} enlisted for a similar situation, as the story begins with a similar plotline as was used in Escape from New York. This time, Snake is forced to {{retrieve}} a disk for a remote control which controlled a series of EMP style satellites. These devices are positioned around the entire world. The disk was somewhere in Los Angeles. The city had separated from the mainland due to an earthquake in August 2000 and had become an island separate from the United States which had become a totalitarian theocratic police state. Snake had to retrieve a black box which the President's (Cliff Robertson) daughter, Utopia (A.J. Langer), went into LA with. The <b>President</b> <b>says</b> <b>he</b> doesn't care if she is returned or killed, she is a traitor to his country. Snake initially refuses but once injected with the plutoxin 7 virus - which will lead to his death in ten hours - he agrees. Snake retrieves the box and seemingly returns it to the President; however, when the President attempts to activate it, he learns {{it is not the}} real box. Snake reveals that he switched the box with a fake, and promptly uses the code [...] "666" [...] to [...] "wipe out all technology" [...] in the world.|$|E

5|$|Without a peace treaty, MacArthur {{decided not}} to resign {{while at the same}} time writing letters to Wood <b>saying</b> <b>he</b> would be more than happy to accept the Republican {{nomination}} if it were offered to him. In late 1947 and early 1948, MacArthur received several Republican grandees in Tokyo. On 9 March 1948 MacArthur issued a press statement declaring his interest in being the Republican candidate for <b>president,</b> <b>saying</b> <b>he</b> would be honored if the Republican Party were to nominate him, but would not resign from the Army to campaign for the presidency. The press statement had been forced by Wood, who told MacArthur that it was impossible to campaign for a man who was not officially running for president, and that MacArthur could either declare his candidacy or see Wood cease campaigning for him. MacArthur's supporters made a major effort to win the Wisconsin Republican primary held on 6 April 1948. MacArthur's refusal to campaign badly hurt his chances and it was won to everybody's surprise by Harold Stassen. The defeat in Wisconsin followed by defeat in Nebraska effectively ended MacArthur's chances of winning the Republican nomination, but MacArthur refused to withdraw his name until the 1948 Republican National Convention which was won by Governor Thomas Dewey of New York.|$|R
