30|$|Numerous {{studies have}} shown that Ag NPs {{toxicity}} to algae was mainly driven by Ag ions dissolved in the exposure medium rather than Ag NPs and also depended on Ag NPs coatings and sizes [80, 84 – 89]. Our study revealed high toxicity of Ag NPs thus suitable for algicidal applications. The ionic Ag and/or Ag NPs (5  nm) could directly enter algal cells [90], causing damage to the cell membranes and other cellular compartments by ROS formation. Moreover, Ag NPs could damage algal cells by direct interaction between NPs and algal cells [72] or the type of NPs coating could play a significant role. For example, dexpanthenol, polyethylene glycol and <b>polyvinyl</b> <b>polypyrrolidone</b> coatings caused a similar effect as AgNO 3 on C. reinhardtii, while carbonate, chitosan, and citrate decreased the Ag effect on photosynthesis [87]. Our Ag NPs showed strong effect toward C. reinhardtii regardless GK coating.|$|E

This experiment evaluated {{the effects of}} extracts from the leaf and stem of Anadenanthera colubrina, Leucaena leucocephala and Mimosa tenuiflora on larval exsheathment of Haemonchus contortus in vitro and verified the role of tannins in this process. Third-stage larvae of H. contortus were incubated with extracts for 3 hours and were exposed to sodium hypochlorite solution. The extracts were tested at 300 µg. mL- 1 and accompanied by controls: phosphate buffer solution (PBS) and <b>polyvinyl</b> <b>polypyrrolidone</b> (PVPP). The larval exsheathment was evaluated for 60 minutes, {{and the results were}} subjected to the Kruskal-Wallis test (p 0. 05), except for L. leucocephala and M. tenuiflora leaf extracts. However, pre-incubation with PVPP of these two extracts significantly changed larval exsheathment when compared to the non-treated extracts (p < 0. 05). These results suggest that A. colubrina, L. leucocephala and M. tenuiflora could be useful in gastrointestinal nematode control and that tannins are probably the main compounds involved in the observed effects. However, in vivo and toxicological studies should be conducted...|$|E
40|$|Nutritive {{values of}} green and black tea {{by-products}} and anti-nutritive activity of their tannins were evaluated in an in vitro rumen fermentation using various molecular weights of polyethylene glycols (PEG), polyvinyl pyrrolidone (PVP) and <b>polyvinyl</b> <b>polypyrrolidone</b> as tannin-binding agents. Significant improvement in gas production by addition of PEG 4000, 6000 and 20000 and PVP was observed only from black tea by-product, but not from green tea by-product. All tannin binding agents increased NH 3 -N concentration from both green and black tea by-products in the fermentation medium, and the PEG 6000 and 20000 showed relatively higher improvement in the NH 3 -N concentration. The PEG 6000 and 20000 also improved in vitro organic matter digestibility and metabolizable energy contents of both tea by-products. It was concluded that high molecular PEG would be suitable to assess the suppressive activity of tannins in tea by-products by in vitro fermentation. Higher responses to gas production and NH 3 -N concentration from black tea by-product than green tea by-product due to PEG indicate that tannins in black tea by-product could suppress rumen fermentation more strongly than that in green tea by-product...|$|E
40|$|The {{adsorption}} of isoflavones from an okara extract onto <b>polyvinyl</b> <b>polypyrrolidone</b> (PVPP) was {{studied for}} a pH ranging from 4 to 7. In general, the affinity of aglycones to PVPP was around 10 {{times higher than}} the affinity of the glycosides. Towards lower pH, the adsorption performance improved for the glycosides, especially for the malonyl-glucosides, but not for the aglycones. Towards neutral pH the affinity also increased, and showed the highest affinity for the total amount of isoflavones. Due to a large amount of protein present in the extract, some isoflavones were lost at lower pH due to the precipitation of protein, which led to losses of 3 - 25 % in the protein fraction without any addition of PVPP. Moreover, PVPP was added to the crude starting material (i. e. okara), investigating the effect of the matrix on the adsorption and the possibility to combine the extraction and adsorption process. The isoflavone extraction was modelled using affinity constants of isoflavones to the matrix and the PVPP. The simulation showed that concurrent PVPP addition results in more extraction from the isoflavones from the matrix. </p...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe {{resistance}} of gastrointestinal nematodes to anthelmintics {{has increased the}} need to evaluate natural products that can replace or assist current strategies to control gastrointestinal nematodes. The objective {{of this study was}} to evaluate the effect of decoctions of Lantana camara (DLc), Alpinia zerumbet (DAz), Mentha villosa (DMv) and Tagetes minuta (DTm) on Haemonchus contortus by two in vitro tests. The effects of increasing concentrations of lyophilized decoctions (0. 31 to 10 mg/ml) were assessed using the egg hatch test (EHT). The decoctions were then tested in the larval artificial exsheathment assay. H. contortus third stage larvae (L 3) were exposed to 0. 31 mg/ml A. zerumbet and M. villosa decoctions and 0. 62 mg/ml T. minuta and L. camara decoctions for 3 h and then exsheathment procedure at 10 min intervals. An inhibitor of tannins, <b>polyvinyl</b> <b>polypyrrolidone</b> (PVPP), was used to study if tannins were responsible for the inhibitory effect on hatching and exsheathment of larvae. A. zerumbet, M. villosa and T. minuta showed a dose-dependent effect in the EHT, which did not disappear after the addition of PVPP. No effect was observed for L. camara in the EHT. However, the decoctions inhibited the process of larval exsheathment, which may be related to tannin action because the addition of PVPP reversed the inhibitory effect. A. zerumbet, M. villosa and T. minuta decoctions showed inhibitory activity on H. contortus larvae hatching and exsheathing. The decoctions of these plants could be used to control gastrointestinal nematodes following confirmation of their anthelmintic activity in vivo...|$|E
40|$|Gastrointestinal {{nematodes}} are a {{major threat}} to small ruminant rearing in the Sahel area, where farmers traditionally use bioactive plants to control these worms, including Acacia nilotica and Acacia raddiana. The main aim {{of this study was to}} screen the potential anthelmintic properties of aqueous and acetone extracts of leaves of these two plants based on three in vitro assays: (1) the egg hatch inhibition assay (EHA); (2) the larvae exsheathment inhibition assay (LEIA) using Haemonchus contortus as a model; and (3) an adult mortality test (AMT) applied on Caenorhabditis elegans. For the EHA, only A. raddiana was effective with IC 50 [*]=[*] 1. 58 [*]mg/mL for aqueous extract, and IC 50 [*]=[*] 0. 58 [*]mg/mL for acetonic extract. For the LEIA, all extracts inhibited the exsheathment of larvae compared to the controls, and the aqueous extract of A. nilotica was more larvicidal with IC 50 [*]=[*] 0. 195 [*]mg/mL. In general, all responses to the substances were dose-dependent and were significantly different from the control group (p[*]<[*] 0. 05). For the AMT, the extracts of the two Acacia species were effective but A. raddiana showed greater efficacy with 100 % mortality at 2. 5 [*]mg/mL and LC 50 [*]=[*] 0. 84 [*]mg/mL (acetonic extract). The addition of <b>polyvinyl</b> <b>polypyrrolidone</b> (PVPP) to the extracts suggested that tannins were responsible for blocking egg eclosion and inducing adult mortality but were not responsible for exsheathment inhibition.

40|$|Six methologies for extracting DNA in cocoa and cocoa-derived {{products}} (cocoa leaves, cocoa beans, cocoa powder, cocoa butter, cocoa mass, {{and dark}} chocolate) are described. These DNA extraction methods included 4 commercial kits DNeasy Plant kit, DNeasy Plant kit with <b>polyvinyl</b> <b>polypyrrolidone</b> (PVPP), QIAamp DNA Stool kit, Wizard Genomic DNA kit and 2 CTAB based methods, CTAB-Proteinase K procedure and CTAB-SDS (sodium dodecyl sulfate) procedure. The DNA yield, purity, and quality for 6 different cocoa matrices are discussed. The yield and purity were determined through spectrophotometry. Three different conventional PCR reactions {{were used to}} assess the quality of the DNA extracted. The Wizard Genomic DNA kit and the CTAB-Proteinase K method were found to be the best for DNA quality and PCR detection in cocoa leaves. The CTAB-Proteinase K procedure is highly recommended for cocoa beans, while the Wizard Genomic DNA kit revealed the best PCR performance when applied to cocoa powder. The cocoa butter matrix gave the lowest DNA yield, purity, and amplification results for all the examined extraction methods. The QIAamp DNA Stool kit and the CTAB-SDS method showed the best result for PCR detection of cocoa mass. The Wizard Genomic DNA kit and the CTAB-SDS method showed the best PCR performance for dark chocolate. In general, the two CTAB based methods, namely the CTAB-Proteinase K and the CTAB-SDS were suitable for the DNA extraction of all types of cocoa-derived products with the exeption of cocoa butter.

40|$|Synthetic {{polymers}} such as water-soluble polyvinyl pyrrolidone (PVP), water-insoluble <b>polyvinyl</b> <b>polypyrrolidone</b> (PVPP), and water-soluble {{polyethylene glycol}} (PEG) contain sufficient oxygen molecules {{in a chain}} to form strong hydrogen bonds with the phenolic and hydroxyl groups in tannins. This review deals with the practical uses of tannin-binding agents, particularly PEG, in tannins assays and for determining {{the negative effects of}} tannins on feed intake and digestion in ruminants. A gravimetric method to assay tannins by precipitation with PVPP is specific for tannins and does not require standards. The extractability of tannins from plant tissues can be reduced by drying samples at temperatures above 50 °C and is dependent on many other factors, such as content and types of plant proteins. Therefore, it is not feasible to recommend a single, optimal protocol for all plant samples. A method to assay tannins which is based on measuring the amount of binding of PEG to plant samples was shown to be simple and accurate. It can also overcome some of these extractability problems. The following biological effects of tannins were investigated in studies where tannin anti-nutritional effects were partially or completely neutralised by varying levels of PEG supplementation. (1) Effects on appetite: the negative effects of tannins on appetite can occur in the short-term (within 20 - 60 min) and the long-term (days and weeks), Astringency and adverse postingestive influences of tannins on the epithelium of the oral cavity and the foregut cause short-term effects on food intake. Long-term effects can be related to reduction in the concentration of ammonia and volatile fatty acids (VFA) in rumen fluids, which can in turn serve as metabolic cues for deficiency of nitrogen (ammonia), energy (VFA), or both. (2) Effects on digestion: increasing content of tannins in foliage can be associated with an increase in bound protein and with reduced degradation rate of the degradable matter in the rumen, but there is no corresponding increase of the non-degradable fraction. Consequently, organic matter, protein, and cell wall digestibility are inversely related to tannin concentrations. (3) Inducing digestive responses: if a significant amount of tannins reach the duodenum, they may markedly reduce the intestinal activity of pancreatic enzymes (trypsin and amylase) and amino acids absorption from the intestine. Condensed tannins can also reduce the content of fluid and particulate matter in the rumen, accelerate the passage of liquid from the abomasum, and delay the passage of digesta in the intestine. The overall effect is a delay in the passage of fluid and particulate matter throughout the entire gastrointestinal tract. It is hypothesised that these responses are largely the consequence of the interaction of tannins with digestive enzymes and the epithelium lining the digestive tract...|$|E
40|$|By-product utilisation, more {{efficient}} use of resources, and more sustainable processing have become {{of the utmost importance}} for society and the food industry. During soymilk production, a by-product called okara is produced in great quantities. Despite being a by-product, okara contains many nutrients, which could be utilised for human consumption. Isoflavones are one example of the components present in soy, which are also found in okara. Isoflavones are a subclass of flavonoids, a group of the many polyphenols that exist, and are believed to have a positive effect in the prevention of hormone related cancers, cardiovascular disease, osteoporosis and obesity. One of the main challenges when extracting isoflavones from okara are their low concentration in okara and the strong water binding capacity of the biopolymer matrix of okara. Besides, isoflavones comprise several classes of components having different properties with respect to for example their solubility. This makes the separation and purification of those components in a cost-efficient manner with a non-toxic solvent route challenging. The aim of this thesis is to provide insight {{for the development of a}} polyphenol separation process on the case of okara. The presence of a partly solid matrix and its impact on the separation process was investigated, and the opportunities and challenges for isoflavone separation from okara are presented in this thesis. By means of this case, the applicability of a process synthesis methodology for separation processes was investigated. In chapter 2, the use of ethanol and water was investigated as relatively non-toxic solvents for extraction of the isoflavones. High extraction yields were obtained with 50 - 70 % ethanol. However, different optima in the range of 0 %- 100 % ethanol were obtained dependent on the isoflavone group, which highly differ in hydrophobicity. The glucosides had an optimum at 50 %- 60 % ethanol, the malonyl-glucosides between 30 % and 60 % ethanol, and the aglycone yield increased monotonously with the ethanol concentration. The solvent choice does not just determine the yield of isoflavones in the extract, but also the swelling of the matrix, important for the separation of the solvent and the okara, and the purity in the extract. While finding a good solvent for a range of components is one issue, a second challenge in the utilisation of okara is its high moisture content, because this limits the ethanol concentrations that can be used in the extraction solvent when extracting the crude okara. Nevertheless, the same extraction yields were obtained as with the dried material, which led to the conclusion that drying of the starting material, being an energy intensive operation, should be omitted. The consequences of using the wet, non-dried okara were evaluated using an exergy analysis. The use of the water in okara poses a challenge if a high fraction of a co-solvent such as ethanol is needed, since that increases the total liquid-to solid ratio. Therefore, we conceptually designed the extraction process and evaluated the efficiency and sustainability of different options (chapter 3). Exergy analysis can quantify and combine effects of solvent consumption and physical energy thermodynamically. In addition, it can indicate the resource efficiency of a process and can be used to compare streams with different solvents such as ethanol and water. Often used for process optimisation, we investigated the use of exergy for process synthesis, which delivered the information for further process design and decision-making. A drying step was found to be less detrimental than an increased solvent use. The use of ethanol, its loss and distillation, and the loss of the extracted residue were identified as the most inefficient steps within the conceptual process, and with this, guidelines were given how to improve the systems sustainability. The analysis performed in chapter 3 showed that a significant step towards better sustainability is made when ethanol is fully omitted as solvent in the extraction step. Furthermore, it was shown in chapter 2 that part of the isoflavones are rather water soluble due to their glucosidic nature. Therefore, the extraction and solubilisation of isoflavones in water was investigated in detail in chapter 4. Besides, the co-extraction of proteins in the water environment and their effect on the isoflavone extraction was investigated. The temperature did not influence the extraction, but an increased liquid-to-solid ratio and the pH did have a clear influence on the extraction yield. Okara may also contain the less polar aglycones, which are in general not present naturally in the soybeans, but which are products of hydrolysis of the glycosides due to certain processing conditions. The ionisation (dissociation) of the components at higher pH can modify their solubility and interaction with the matrix; therefore, by adjusting the pH the aglycones could be solubilised in water as well. Further purification based on affinity separation was shown to be more feasible with water as solvent, since a water-ethanol mixture would be such a good solvent that the adsorption on the column would be hindered. The common way of regenerating such components includes the use of another solvent than is used for extraction, leading to an additional evaporation step. The higher affinity of isoflavones in an aqueous environment to a resin, and the possibility to omit an additional preparation step demonstrated the suitability of water as solvent in the primary extraction step: the extracts are more suitable for chromatographic purification, while ethanol or aqueous ethanol could be used as eluent. This demonstrates that it is important not to design a processing step by itself, but to optimise an internally coherent processing system as a whole. Chapter 5 reports on the adsorption of the isoflavones on <b>polyvinyl</b> <b>polypyrrolidone</b> (PVPP) with special regards to the effect of proteins that are co-suspended in the extract. The adsorption efficiency was only negatively influenced when accounting for the isoflavones that are lost with protein that precipitates at lower pH. The affinity of the isoflavone groups could be described with constant partition coefficients resulting from a simple model. Furthermore, the adsorption of the isoflavones onto PVPP with the entire okara matrix present at floating pH could be described with a model using the partition coefficients describing the affinity to the PVPP and to the matrix. The model suggests that it is possible to ‘pull’ the isoflavones from the okara by concurrent adsorption of the isoflavones to an adsorption resin that is present in the same solution, thus increasing both yield and purity. The three main isoflavone groups present in okara behave differently throughout the entire study, due to their different properties. The order of their adsorption affinities was the reverse of their water extractability. A more sustainable integrated recovery process can be designed for polyphenolic components, by identifying the right balance between the polarity and hydrophobicity of the component of interest, the solvent, and the adsorbent. The investigated process synthesis methodology, and the design options that followed by applying this methodology are discussed in detail in chapter 6. A simplified simultaneous extraction-adsorption separation process, which resulted from the process synthesis is presented. Two base case flow diagrams that can be investigated in depths are further discussed in chapter 7. Since the relevant properties and phenomena underlying the results presented in this thesis are quite generic, they can be translated to other separation processes, and the same approach can be used to develop more sustainable separation processes for polyphenols or other useful compounds from other food-by-products. By using the sustainability and efficiency as a prime objective within process design in combination with a good understanding of the underlying phenomena of the system, a new step in process design can be made: Sustainable process development requires proper understanding of the complex systems we are dealing with, the matrix itself, but also the thermodynamic behaviour of the components, and their behaviour in the matrix and during processing...|$|E
40|$|Thesis (MscAgric (Viticulture and Oenology)) [...] University of Stellenbosch, 2007. The rapid {{expansion}} of the world wine industry has increased the pressure on wine producers to produce high quality, distinguishable wines. The use of sensory evaluation alone {{as a tool to}} distinguish between wines is limited by its subjective nature. Chemical characterisation using analytical methods and data analysis techniques are increasingly being used in conjunction with sensory analysis for comprehensive profiling of wine. Analytical chemistry and chemometric techniques are important and inextricable parts of the chemical characterisation of wine. Through this process insight into the inherent composition of wines, be it in a general sense or related to a particular wine category is gained. Data generated during chemical characterisation are typically compiled into electronic databases. The application of such information towards wine quality control includes the establishment of industry benchmarks and authentication. The current project is part of The South African Young Wine Aroma Project, a long term research initiative funded by the South African Wine Industry with the ultimate aim to establish a comprehensive, up-to-date, database of the volatile composition of young wines. The data generated during this thesis represent the first contribution towards realising this ambition. Three clearly defined aims were set for this project, the first of which is the chemical characterisation of South African young wines in terms of selected volatile and non-volatile compounds and Fourier transform infrared spectra, with particular focus on the volatile composition. FTMIR spectra are information rich and non-specific instrumental signals that could provide invaluable information of the inherent composition of the wines. The second aim is the evaluation of the analytical methods used to generate the data and in the last instance, the optimisation of FTMIR spectroscopy for rapid quantification of major wine parameters and volatile compounds. The concentrations of 27 volatile compounds in South African young wines were determined by gas chromatography coupled to flame ionisation detection (GC-FID) using liquid-liquid extraction of the analytes. Wine samples of the 2005 and 2006 vintages produced from six of the most important cultivars in the South African wine industry, namely Sauvignon blanc, Chardonnay, Pinotage, Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot and Shiraz were used. The producing cellars were from four major South African wine producing regions, namely Stellenbosch, Paarl, Robertson and Worcester. The data captured made a significant contribution to the establishment of the Aroma Project Database. Univariate statistics showed wide variations in the chemical composition of the wines. Red wines were generally characterised by high levels of higher alcohols and white wines by high levels of esters. Most of the differences between vintages were cultivar dependent and phenological differences between cultivars were suggested as a possible cause. Fusel alcohols, iso-acids and esters of fusel alcohols were particularly responsible for differences between red wines. A combination of fatty acids and higher alcohols were responsible for differences between production regions. However, using univariate statistics alone was limited in identifying characteristic features of the chemical composition of the wines. In order to explore the correlations between the volatile components, FTMIR spectra and nonvolatile components the data were further investigated with multivariate data analysis. Principal component analysis was successfully employed to distinguish between wines of different vintages and cultivars. The role of the volatile composition was more influential in the separation of vintage and red wine cultivar groupings than the non-volatile components or the FTMIR spectra. Almost all the individual volatile components contributed to the separation between the vintages and cultivars, thereby highlighting the multivariate nature required to establish the distinguishing features pertaining to each of these categories. The FTMIR spectra and the non-volatile components were more important than the volatile components to characterise the differences between the white cultivars. It was not surprising that both the volatile components and the FTMIR spectra were needed to distinguish between both red and white cultivars simultaneously. It was of interest the full spectrum, including all wavenumbers were required for a powerful classification model. This finding supports the initial expectation that the non-selective but information rich signal captured in the FTMIR spectra is indispensable. No distinction could be made between the production regions, which was not surprising since the wines used in this study was not of guaranteed origin. Furthermore, no clear correlation could be established between the chemical composition or the FTMIR spectra and the quality ratings of the wines. Limitations in the dataset were pointed out that {{must be taken into account}} during further investigations in the future. The liquid-liquid extraction method used during the analysis of the volatile components was evaluated for precision, accuracy and robustness. Generally good precision and accuracy were observed. There were slight indications of inconsistencies in the recoveries of analytes between the red and white wine matrices. Certain parameters of the protocol, namely sample volume, solvent volume, sonication temperature and sonication time, were identified as factors that had a major influence on quantification. The results obtained in this study made a major contribution towards establishing this technique for routine GC-FID analysis in our environment. Due to the high sample throughput in wine laboratories, the use of rapid quantitative analytical methods such as FTMIR spectroscopy is becoming increasingly important. Enzymatic-linked spectrophotometric assays and high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) methods were evaluated for their suitability to serve as reference methods for optimising and establishing FTMIR calibrations for glucose, fructose, malic acid, lactic acid and glycerol. Pigmented and phenolic compounds were identified as sources of interference in the determination of organic acids in red wines with both enzymatic assays and HPLC. The use of fining treatments for the decolourisation of red wine samples was investigated. Activated charcoal was more efficient in terms of colour removal than <b>polyvinyl</b> <b>polypyrrolidone</b> (PVPP), but neither were compatible with the specific enzymatic method used in this study. Solid phase extraction (SPE), a method commonly used during sample clean-up prior to HPLC analysis of organic acids in wine, and PVPP fining were evaluated as sample preparation methods for HPLC analysis to optimise the quantification of organic acids in red wine. Four different types of SPE cartridges were evaluated and the SPE method was optimised in order to recover the maximum amount of organic acids. However, low recoveries, in some instance less than 50 %, for the organic acids in wine were reported for the optimised SPE method. In this respect one was the worst. On average, excellent recoveries were observed for the organic acids using the PVPP method that were in excess of 90 %. This method therefore provides a very valuable and simple alternative to SPE for sample-cleanup prior to HPLC analysis. One aspect that still needs to be investigated is the reproducibility of the method that should still be optimised. In general, enzymatic analysis was more suitable for the determination of glucose and fructose, while HPLC analysis were more suitable for the quantification of organic acids. Efficient glycerol quantification was observed with both enzymatic and HPLC analysis, although a lower measurement error was observed during the HPLC analysis. Apart from reliable reference methods, successful FTMIR calibrations also rely on the variability present in the reference sample set. The reference sample set used to establish FTMIR calibrations must ideally be representative of the samples that will be analysed in the future. Commercial, or so-called global, FTMIR calibrations for the determination of important wine parameters were evaluated for their compatibility to a South African young wine matrix. The prediction pH, titratable acidity, malic acid, glucose, fructose, ethanol and glycerol could be improved by establishing a brand new FTMIR calibration, thereby clearly indicating that the South African young wine matrices were significantly different from the samples of European origin that were used to establish the commercial calibrations. New preliminary calibration models were established for a young wine sample matrix and were validated using independent test sets. On average the prediction errors were considered sufficient for at least screening purposes. The effect of wavenumber selection was evaluated. Relatively successful models could be established for all the compounds except glucose. Wavenumber selection had an influence on the efficiency of the calibration models. Some models were more effective using a small amount of highly correlated wavenumbers, while others were more effective using larger wavenumber regions. Preliminary FTMIR calibration models for the screening of volatile compound groups in young wines were evaluated. Compound groups were compiled based on chemical similarity and flavour similarity. Good linearity were observed for the “total alcohol”, “total fatty acids”, “esters” models while an interesting polynomial trend was observed for the “total esters” model. Relatively high prediction errors indicated the possibility of spectral interferences, but the models were nevertheless considered suitable for screening purposes. These findings are a valuable contribution to our environment where fermentation flavour profiles must often be examined. The important role sound and validated analytical methods to generate high quality analytical data, and the subsequent application of chemometric techniques to model the data for the purpose of wine characterisation has been thoroughly explored in this study. After a critical evaluation of the analytical methods used in this study, various statistical methods were used to uncover the chemical composition of South African young wines. The use of multivariate data analysis has revealed some limitations in the dataset and therefore it must be said that wine characterisation is not just reliant on sophisticated analytical chemistry and advanced data analytical techniques, but also on high quality sample sets...|$|E
