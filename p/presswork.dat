60|$|McGaffey, {{knowing he}} was about to decamp, had not kept the press very clean; but Thursday Smith put in the {{afternoon}} and evening removing grease, polishing and rubbing, until the huge machine shone resplendent. The girls went home at dinner time, but they sent Arthur to the office at midnight to see if the new pressman was proving capable. The Tuesday morning Tribune greeted them at the breakfast table, and the <b>presswork</b> was remarkably clean and distinct.|$|E
60|$|Everybody's term of {{subscription}} will {{be extended}} {{enough to cover}} all missed issues, and we hope soon to report that the goose remains suspended at a favorable altitude. People {{who have tried to}} run a funny paper and entertain a congregation of large piebald measles at the same time will understand something of the tact, finesse, and hot sassafras tea required to do so. We expect to get out the paper regularly from this time on, but are forced to be very careful, as improper treatment and deleterious after-effects of measles, combined with the high price of paper and <b>presswork,</b> have been known to cause a relapse. Any one not getting their paper regularly will please come down and see about it, bringing with them a ham or any little delicacy relished by invalids.|$|E
60|$|These two {{printers}} I found {{poorly qualified}} for their business. Bradford had been bred to it, {{and was very}} illiterate; and Keimer, though something of a scholar, was a mere compositor, knowing nothing of <b>presswork.</b> He {{had been one of}} the French prophets, and could act their enthusiastic agitations. At this time he did not profess any particular religion, but something of all on occasion; was very ignorant of the world, and had, as I afterward found, a good deal of the knave in his composition. He did not like my lodging at Bradford's while I worked with him. He had a house, indeed, but without furniture, so he could not lodge me; but he got me a lodging at Mr. Read's, before mentioned, who was the owner of his house; and my chest of clothes being come by this time, I made rather a more respectable appearance in the eyes of Miss Read than I had done when she first happened to see me eating my roll in the street.|$|E
60|$|At {{my first}} {{admission}} into the printing-house I took to working at press, imagining I felt a want of the bodily exercise I {{had been used}} to in America, where <b>presswork</b> is mixed with the composing. I drank only water; the other workmen, near fifty in number, were great drinkers of beer. On occasion, I carried up and down stairs a large form of types in each hand, when others carried but one in both hands; they wondered to see, from this and several instances, that the Water American, as they called me, was stronger than themselves who drank strong beer! We had an alehouse-boy, who attended always in the house to supply the workmen. My companion at the press drank every day a pint before breakfast, a pint at breakfast with his bread and cheese, a pint between breakfast and dinner, a pint at dinner; a pint in the afternoon about six o'clock, and another when he had done his day's work. I thought it a detestable custom; but it was necessary, he supposed, to drink strong beer, that he might be strong to labour. I endeavoured to convince him that the bodily strength afforded by beer could only be in proportion to the grain or flour of the barley dissolved in the water of which it was made; that there was more flour in a pennyworth of bread, and, therefore, if he could eat that with a pint of water, it would give him more strength than a quart of beer. He drank on, however, and had four or five shillings to pay out of his wages every Saturday night for that vile liquor: an expense I was free from; and thus these poor devils keep themselves always under.|$|E

50|$|The Phosphor Bronze Company {{was bought}} in 1937 for its {{manufacture}} of high grade non-ferrous castings {{and the following}} year Hardy, Spicer elected {{to make their own}} forgings in their own forging plant.

Sheffield's Laycock Engineering also made a flexible coupling known as Layrub as well as being a large manufacturer of garage and railway equipment.|$|E
50|$|The {{company had}} four {{operating}} divisions: precision pressing division, steel division, fastener division, and engineering and forging division. The Precision pressing division made precision <b>presswork</b> for electrical, automotive, and textile industries stampings and strip would cores for electrical industry.

Engineering and forging division produces drop upset and press forgings.|$|E
50|$|From the start, the Spiral Press {{found work}} doing typography, often for large {{publishers}} like Henry Holt who ordered designs for dust jackets, title pages, advertising, etc. Printing and composing were sometimes delegated to outside plants that had higher capacity, but for more exclusive jobs, the Spiral Press acquired production equipment such that Blumenthal could attend to {{every detail of}} typesetting, ink, paper, and <b>presswork.</b> During the Depression years, Blumenthal further immersed himself in the traditional craft by setting up a hand-press shop.|$|E
50|$|Amongst {{the many}} {{industrial}} machines {{on display at}} the Great Exhibition was Mr John Ashton's button-making press, first patented in 1841. This could manufacture buttons from thin metal sheet far more quickly and cheaply than hand work. These new buttons had the advantage of smart modernity. Birmingham would soon become a major centre for this type of costume jewellery and small <b>presswork.</b> The centralised factories, steam power and access to venture capital could not be competed with by the small-scale enterprises of rural Dorset.|$|E
5000|$|McCune {{started his}} own hand-printing {{enterprise}} early in 1968. As a gift upon his retirement from Kaiser Permanente, he chose an Adana Horizontal Quarto Printing Press. He described his early foray into hand-printing: [...] "Early in this new career — now three months old — I printed an apprentice-piece, Ad Dante, embodying the only Latin verses I have ever {{had the nerve to}} write — and that nearly fifty years ago. The <b>presswork</b> was atrocious." [...] He then took lessons from Roger Levenson at the Tamalpais Press.|$|E
50|$|Blumenthal {{soon began}} {{thinking}} about how to turn his after-hours print shop into a viable independent business. As a salesman for Marchbanks, Blumenthal had encountered great difficulty trying to sell fine <b>presswork</b> as opposed to normal <b>presswork</b> because the usual customers for printing saw no advantage to the extra cost. Blumenthal came to believe that there was no set market for fine presses but that customers who believed in craftsmanship would seek it out. Perhaps a better assurance of customers {{was the fact that the}} 1920s was a fertile period for book design, with a new generation of craftsmen trained by the pioneers of the book arts movement, which had been sparked in the 1890s by William Morris in reaction to the rise of industrial production. The Spiral Press worked with a variety of clients, including Henry Holt & Co., Random House, Robert Frost, The Limited Editions Club, The Museum of Modern Art, President Franklin Roosevelt, The Metropolitan Museum of Art, and the Pierpont Morgan Library. The press was also known for taking on a range of work: not only the invitations, bookplates, and limited editions expected for a small press but also typography for large trade editions, indicating the expanding interest in well-designed books.|$|E
50|$|The 20TS {{was built}} using {{existing}} components: its engine {{came from the}} Standard Vanguard, its suspension from the Triumph Mayflower, and its chassis from the Standard 8 hp, itself based on the pre-war Standard Flying Nine. The body {{was designed to be}} built economically, with no panels requiring double-action <b>presswork.</b> Economy of design was considered vital, as the company did not expect high sales figures and had targeted a price of £500 before sales tax. The rear of the car was short and curved and had the spare tyre bolted to it.|$|E
50|$|Publication {{decisions}} and editorial work are shared. The design and type-setting (usually by hand) are done by Crispin, and the <b>presswork</b> by Jan:The press publishes in several main areas -- literary classics, translations, typography, and books on wood engraving. They publish works {{that they themselves}} would like to read, with a particular focus (to quote Jan) on “books which celebrate wood engravings as an art form.”' Most of their publications use wood engravings as illustrations, and the press publishes an ongoing series of monographs on individual engravers called Endgrain Editions The Elsteds periodically provide workshops in their press room.|$|E
5000|$|De Celis was {{editor of}} the Spanish-language {{newspaper}} La Cronica, which had been founded in Los Angeles in 1872. In 1878 he was publishing a newspaper called La Reforma, and he was attacked editorially by the Los Angeles Daily Herald, which {{said he had not}} paid a bill owed to the Herald for printing his newspaper. [...] "He can come and pay the charges overdue for <b>presswork</b> and take his forms away, and this time he must keep them away, for he is such bad pay that we shall no longer subject ourselves to the worry of the job." ...|$|E
5000|$|Chapbooks {{are mostly}} small paper-covered booklets, usually printed {{on a single}} sheet folded into books of 8, 12, 16 and 24 pages, often {{illustrated}} with crude woodcuts, which sometimes bear {{no relation to the}} text. They were produced cheaply. One collector, Harry Weiss, wrote: [...] "the printing in many cases was execrable, the paper even worse, and the woodcut illustrations, some of which did duty for various tales regardless of their fitness, were sometimes worse than the paper and <b>presswork</b> combined". However, the category has no real limits: some chapbooks were long, some well produced, and some even historically accurate.|$|E
5000|$|Under English law, a {{bank has}} a general right to combine {{accounts}} where a customer has multiple accounts {{with the same}} bank. [...] The right has been recognised since at least 1860 (and probably longer). However {{it was not until}} 1975 in the House of Lords decision in National Westminster Bank Ltd v Halesowen <b>Presswork</b> & Assemblies Ltd 1972 AC 785 that it was finally determined that this was a type of set-off right rather than anything related to the banker's lien (a separate common law right). Typically the right will be exercised where one account is overdrawn and the other is in credit so that the bank can secure full repayment of overdraft without the need to take any further action with respect to the customer. The broad rationale is that separate numbered accounts are set up for administrative convenience only, but the legal duty upon a bank to [...] "account" [...] to its customers for the sums held by it only extends to the net sum.|$|E
50|$|The {{technique}} of stochastic screening, which has existed since the seventies, {{has had a}} revival in recent times thanks to increased use of computer-to-plate (CTP) techniques. In previous techniques, computer to film, during the exposure {{there could be a}} drastic variation in the quality of the plate. It was a very delicate and difficult procedure that was not much used. Today, with CTP during the creation of the plate you just need to check a few parameters on the density and tonal correction curve. When you make a plate with stochastic screening you must use a tone correction curve, this curve allows one to align the tone reproduction of an FM screen to that of an industry standard.Given the same final <b>presswork</b> tone value, an FM screen utilizes more halftone dots than an AM/XM screen. The result is that more light is filtered by the ink and less light simply reflects off the surface of the substrate. The result is that FM screens exhibit a greater color gamut than conventional AM/XM halftone screen frequencies.The creation of a plate with stochastic screening is done the same way as is done with an AM/XM screen. A tone reproduction compensation curve is typically applied to align the stochastic screening to conventional AM/FM tone reproductions targets (e.g. ISO 12647-2).|$|E
5000|$|Johannes Gutenberg is {{credited}} with the development in the western hemisphere, in about 1440, of modern movable type printing from individually cast, reusable letters set together in a form (frame or chase). Movable type was first invented in China using ceramic type in 1040 AD. Gutenberg also invented a wooden printing press, based on the extant wine press, where the type surface was inked with leather covered ink balls and paper laid carefully on top by hand, then slid under a padded surface and pressure applied from above by a large threaded screw. It was Gutenburg's [...] "screw press" [...] or hand press {{that was used to}} print 180 copies of the Bible. At 1,282 pages, it took him and his staff of 20 almost 3 years to complete. 48 copies remain intact today. This form of <b>presswork</b> gradually replaced the hand copied manuscripts of scribes and illuminators as the most prevalent form of printing. Printers' workshops, previously unknown in Europe before the mid-15th century, were found in every important metropolis by 1500. Later metal presses used a knuckle and lever arrangement instead of the screw, but the principle was the same. Ink rollers made of composition made inking faster and paved the way for further automation.|$|E
50|$|In 1889 the {{partners}} obtained a second patent on {{the manufacture of}} 'Dorcas' thimbles. This was for a minor improvement, the provision of thicker material {{at the top of}} the thimble, the area of most wear. As this was such a minor improvement, it may have been applied for more to extend the lifetime of patent protection held by the Horner company, rather than for a specific improvement. The same partners were also granted another patent, for a similar idea of layered metal protection formed by the <b>presswork</b> with which they were already familiar. This was for a long-lasting yarn spindle or 'cone', where the boxwood cone was sheathed entirely in brass. Such an invention was of obvious relevance in the Pennines of Northern England, where textile spinning and weaving was such an important trade. Previous cones had been partially sheathed in brass. The softer boxwood would wear in time so that the brass became a protruding lip which then caught on the yarn. A complete sheathing would have no lip, but required the Horner's skill to devise a means of manufacturing the deep metal cone. Unusually, although Halifax and Yorkshire East of the Pennines is best known for its wool trade, the patent mentions cotton yarns specifically, generally considered a Lancashire trade, West of the Pennines.|$|E
5000|$|Arsenije IV {{commissioned}} Pavle Nenadović, a clergyman {{and poet}} {{from the town}} of Karlovci, to compose a heraldic handbook, Stemmatographia (meaning [...] "the drawing of ancestry" [...] in Greek). This heraldic album was modelled after a book of the same title on Slavonic heraldic bearings, engraved in 1701 by Croatian poet Pavao Ritter Vitezović (who modelled his Stemmatographia after an older version of Slavic heraldry composed by Mavro Orbini). Arsenije IV's Stemmatographia was perceived by some as an illustrated political programme that was supposed to act both as a verification of the Serbian historical past and as a clear geo-political statement of the lands belonging to the Serbs in the Balkans. His intention, however, was educational, and for this work he hired three people: Hristofor Zhefarovich originally from Dojran as an artist; German-born Thomas Mesmer as an engraver; and clergyman Pavle Nenadović as a poet. Arsenije IV was well aware of the power of communuication that printed imagery had in those early days of the printing press and the art of engraving. His Stemmatographia was widely distributed among the Serbian villages and towns in the then Habsburg-occupied Serbian lands, and in Imperial Russia where Serbian colonies existed. (The letter from Arsenije IV, written and dated 19 June 1743, demanding a wide distribution is kept in the Archiepiscopal Archives Sremski Karlovci under the <b>presswork</b> B-1743-68).|$|E
5000|$|Recent work in 2017 has {{identified}} {{the parents of}} George Soule through a high-quality Y-DNA match of Soule with families in Scotland and Australia. Jan Sol and his wife Mayken Labis are identified by their marriage as Protestant refugees in London, England, in 1586 and by the baptisms of their children before 1600 in Haarlem, Holland. Their eldest known son Johannes Sol is identified by his baptism, {{as well as by}} his permission in Haarlem to marry in Leyden. Johannes Sol, a printer in Leyden with one known publication, died suddenly, probably while helping William Brewster in the <b>presswork</b> for [...] "Perth Assembly." [...] His apprentice, Edward Raban, apparently fled to Scotland in 1619 in order to avoid being apprehended by agents of the King of England. It appears he was accompanied by the pregnant widow of his master and probably took with him the missing press of Brewster, as well as the telltale type and initials from Brewster; Raban also apparently took with him the Sol press and type. Edward Raban in 1622 published a very veiled version of his master's shocking death, well hidden in a discussion of drunkeness and resultant whoredom. It would appear all helpers in the press work and distribution of [...] "Perth Assembly" [...] took an oath of silence that was never breached, even after King James I died in 1625 ...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Optical {{dot gain}} {{is the key}} point of {{halftone}} reconstruction study, and {{has always been a}} meaningful topic of theoretical study. The Yule–Nielsen formula {{is by far the most}} widely used research method of optical dot gain. However, solving the Yule–Nielsen parameter n remains a difficult problem. This paper disregards solving for the Yule–Nielsen parameter n, analyzes the light scattering and osmotic effect of halftone <b>presswork,</b> deduces the exact expressions of blank area of <b>presswork,</b> and determines the reflectivity of the dot part and halftone <b>presswork</b> according to the point spread function and probability method. Furthermore, this paper analyzes how the optical dot gain depends on the dot area coverage of <b>presswork,</b> ink layer transmittivity, and paper-based spectral reflectivity. In addition, a new algorithm model for optical dot gain is established. By employing the Clapper–Yule Model to calculate the spectral transmittance of printing ink and comparing it with the practical measured spectral reflectivity of the halftone <b>presswork</b> proof, the accuracy of the model established in this paper is fully verified. ...|$|E
