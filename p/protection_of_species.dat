Following human migration and population growth, species extinctions have progressively increased to a rate unprecedented since the Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event.

Some scientific estimates indicate that up to half of presently existing species may become extinct by 2100.

He was also the author of numerous books on the ecology of the Black Sea, the fauna of Romania, bioethnology, etc.. As a tribute to his work, more than 70 taxa have been dedicated to him by various scientists. Louis Fage named a species of Cumacea, Diastyloides bacescoi.|$|E

50|$|Between 1800 and 1950, {{the culture}} and way of living of the Canadian Inuit, who had not known any {{monetary}} system before, changed fundamentally. Complete self-sufficiency and independence were {{to a large extent}} replaced by dependence on goods of western industrialized countries, such as clothing, many kinds of foodstuffs, weapons, tools and technical equipment. This development was largely {{due to the fact that}} as hunters and trappers, they could develop only a low level of productivity that could not financially cover the Western way of living. Moreover, the products of the kill depended too much on market and fashion fluctuations, not to speak of concerns related to <b>protection</b> <b>of</b> <b>species</b> and of the environment.|$|E
50|$|<b>Protection</b> <b>of</b> <b>species</b> or {{individual}} populations is usually achievable via conservation and restoration of habitats. To do so, collecting essential data on biological communities and ecosystem function are important. Therefore, long term monitoring of populations {{needs to be}} accompanied by monitoring of the environment parameters. To determine the health of ecosystem, observation of the ecosystem processes such as temperature, rainfall, humidity and soil erosion, is necessary. Monitoring the community characteristics such as the present species and amount of biomass, are also other parameters in a healthy ecosystem. By monitoring the studies of these parameters, it enables managers {{to decide whether or not}} the goals of their projects are being achieved or if management plans need to be adjusted.|$|E

Jonathan Baillie, of the Zoological Society of London and co-author of the report, stated that, [...] "The donor community and conservation movement are increasingly leaning towards a 'what can nature do for us?' approach, where species and wild habitats are valued and prioritised according to these services they provided for people.
