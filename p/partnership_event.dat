40|$|At {{this point}} {{in the life of the}} Talawanda-Miami Partnership (2001 – 08), it is {{important}} to take stock, classify, describe, and interpret the general trends of activity in order to understand where we have been, what we have done, and where we might go from here. Th is paper then is an attempt by the authors to classify, describe, and interpret the curriculum interventions that have occurred as a result of the partnership. It is important for the reader to know that we, the authors, view human experience as curricular by its very nature. We seek to understand the world through the notion that educative experiences are curriculum events. From the macro-structural decisions that are made by a partnership taskforce to advance an educational agenda to the micro-level decision to provide snacks during a <b>partnership</b> <b>event</b> for children creating art forms for a diversity festival, we recognize a continuum of curriculum events both great and small. Our contention will be that we need to understand how these curriculum interventions look, act, and contribute (or not) to the partnership...|$|E
