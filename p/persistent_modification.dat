40|$|Morphine {{is a poor}} inducer of μ-opioid {{receptor}} (MOR) internalization, but {{a potent}} inducer of cellular tolerance. Here we show that, in contrast to full agonists such as [D-Ala 2 -MePhe 4 -Gly-ol]enkephalin (DAMGO), morphine stimulated a selective phosphorylation of the carboxy-terminal residue 375 (Ser 375). Ser 375 phosphorylation was sufficient and required for morphine-induced desensitization of MOR. In the presence of full agonists, morphine revealed partial agonistic properties and potently inhibited MOR phosphorylation and internalization. Upon removal of the drug, DAMGO-desensitized receptors were rapidly dephosphorylated. In contrast, morphine-desensitized receptors remained at the plasma membrane in a Ser 375 -phosphorylated state for prolonged periods. Thus, morphine promotes terminal MOR desensitization by inducing a <b>persistent</b> <b>modification</b> of Ser 375...|$|E

Metabolite {{changes and the}} decline in free myoplasmic calcium influence the activation and contractile processes. This study was aimed at evaluating whether fatigue also causes <b>persistent</b> <b>modifications</b> of key myofibrillar and sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) proteins that contribute to tension reduction. The presence of such modifications was investigated in chemically skinned fibers, a procedure that replaces the fatigued cytoplasm from the muscle fiber with a normal medium. Myofibrillar Ca(2 +) sensitivity was reduced in slow-twitch muscle (for example, the pCa value corresponding to 50 % of maximum tension was 6. 23 +/- 0. 03 vs. 5. 99 + 0. 05, P < 0. 01, in rested and fatigued fibers) and not modified in fast-twitch muscle. Phosphorylation of the regulatory myosin light chain isoform increased in fast-twitch muscle. The rate of SR Ca(2 +) uptake was increased in slow-twitch muscle fibers (14. 2 +/- 1. 0 vs. 19. 6 +/- 2. 5 nmol. min(- 1). mg fiber protein(- 1), P < 0. 05) and not altered in fast-twitch fibers.

Here we showed that visual experience can induce <b>persistent</b> <b>modification</b> of developing retinotectal circuits via spike timing-dependent plasticity (STDP). Pairing light stimuli with spiking of the tectal cell induced persistent enhancement or reduction of light-evoked responses, with a dependence on the relative timing between light stimulus and postsynaptic spiking similar to that for STDP. Using precisely timed sequential three-bar stimulation to mimic a moving bar, we showed that spike timing-dependent LTP/LTD can account for the asymmetric modification of the tectal cell receptive field induced by moving bar. Furthermore, selective inhibition of signaling mediated by brain-derived neurotrophic factor and nitric oxide, which are respectively required for light-induced LTP and LTD, interfered with moving bar-induced temporally specific changes in the tectal cell responses. Together, these findings suggest that STDP can mediate sensory experience-dependent circuit refinement in the developing nervous system...|$|E

Here {{we found that the}} repetitive stimulation of two distinct excitatory inputs to the GCs induced a <b>persistent</b> <b>modification</b> of lateral inhibition in MCs in opposing directions. This bidirectional modification of inhibitory inputs differentially regulated the subsequent synaptic plasticity of the excitatory ON inputs to the MCs, which was induced by the repetitive pairing of excitatory postsynaptic potentials (EPSPs) with postsynaptic bursts. The regulation of spike timing-dependent plasticity (STDP) was achieved by the regulation of the inter-spike-interval (ISI) of the postsynaptic bursts.

Prolonged dialysis of the postsynaptic cell blocks the triggering of LTP, with no effect on expression of LTP.

40|$|What are the {{long-lasting}} {{changes that}} occur in your brain as you learn new information? It is generally thought that memory is due to <b>persistent</b> <b>modification</b> {{of the strength of}} synapses, the structures that communicate information from one neuron to the next. One such modification is the long-term potentiation (LTP) that occurs at the synapses of the CA 1 region of the hippocampus. This type of modification is of particular interest because it has associative properties that match that of learning itself (we come to associate the smell and taste of food), and because the hippocampus is important for long-term memory. The report by Barria et al. on page 2042 in this issue (1) is a significant step forward in our understanding of the persistent biochemical modifications that underlie this form of LTP. The major new finding of Barria et al. is that the postsynaptic receptors (a subtype of glutamate receptor known as AMPA receptors) that mediate excitatory synaptic transmission at this synapse become phosphorylated after LTP induction and stay phosphorylated for at least 1 hour thereafter. The authors also show that phosphorylation of AMPA receptors in an expression system enhances the response...|$|E

All four CPEBs in vertebrates are expressed in the brain, including the hippocampal neurons, suggesting their potential roles in translation-dependent plasticity and memory. Although CPEB 1 and CPEB 3 {{have been shown to}} control specific kinds of hippocampus-related LTM, the role of CPEB 2 and CPEB 4 in learning and memory remains elusive.

Electrophysiological recordings of multiple forms of synaptic plasticity in the Schaffer collateral pathway-CA 1 neurons also showed normal responses in the KO hippocampal slices.

40|$|Persistent {{dendritic}} spine enlargement {{is associated with}} stable long-term potentiation (LTP), and the latter is thought to underlie long-lasting memories. Extracellular proteolytic remodeling of the synaptic microenvironment could be important for such plasticity, but whether or how proteolytic remodeling contributes to <b>persistent</b> <b>modifications</b> in synapse structure and function is unknown. Matrix metalloproteinase- 9 (MMP- 9) is an extracellular protease that is activated perisynaptically after LTP induction and required for LTP maintenance. Here, by monitoring spine size and excitatory postsynaptic potentials (EPSPs) simultaneously with combined 2 -photon time-lapse imaging and whole-cell recordings from hippocampal neurons, we find that MMP- 9 is both necessary and sufficient to drive spine enlargement and synaptic potentiation concomitantly. Both structural and functional MMP-driven forms of plasticity are mediated through β 1 -containing integrin receptors, are associated with integrin-dependent cofilin inactivation within spines, and require actin polymerization. In contrast, postsynaptic exocytosis and protein synthesis are both required for MMP- 9 -induced potentiation, but not for initial MMP- 9 -induced spine expansion. However, spine expansion becomes unstable when postsynaptic exocytosis or protein synthesis is blocked, indicating that the 2 forms of plasticity are expressed independently but require interactions between them for persistence. When MMP activity is eliminated during theta-stimulation-induced LTP, both spine enlargement and synaptic potentiation are transient. Thus, MMP-mediated extracellular remodeling during LTP has an instructive role in establishing <b>persistent</b> <b>modifications</b> in both synapse structure and function of the kind critical for learning and memory...|$|R

40|$|International audienceThe {{ability of}} synapses {{to modify their}} {{synaptic}} strength in response to activity is a fundamental property {{of the nervous system}} and may be an essential component of learning and memory. There are three classes of ionotropic glutamate receptor, namely NMDA (N-methyl-D-aspartate), AMPA (alpha-amino- 3 -hydroxy- 5 -methyl- 4 -isoxazole- 4 -propionic acid) and kainate receptors; critical roles in synaptic plasticity have been identified for two of these. Thus, at many synapses in the brain, transient activation of NMDA receptors leads to a <b>persistent</b> <b>modification</b> in the strength of synaptic transmission mediated by AMPA receptors. Here, to determine whether kainate receptors are involved in synaptic plasticity, we have used a new antagonist, LY 382884 ((3 S, 4 aR, 6 S, 8 aR) - 6 -((4 -carboxyphenyl) methyl- 1, 2, 3, 4, 4 a, 5, 6, 7, 8, 8 a-decahydro isoquinoline- 3 -carboxylic acid), which antagonizes kainate receptors at concentrations that do not affect AMPA or NMDA receptors. We find that LY 382884 is a selective antagonist at neuronal kainate receptors containing the GluR 5 subunit. It has no effect on long-term potentiation (LTP) that is dependent on NMDA receptors but prevents the induction of mossy fibre LTP, which is independent of NMDA receptors. Thus, kainate receptors can act as the induction trigger for long-term changes in synaptic transmission...|$|E
40|$|The <b>persistent</b> <b>modification</b> of {{synaptic}} efficacy as {{a function}} of the relative timing of pre- and postsynaptic spikes is a phenomenon known as spiketiming-dependent plasticity (STDP). Here we show that the modulation of STDP by a global reward signal leads to reinforcement learning. We first derive analytically learning rules involving reward-modulated spike-timing-dependent synaptic and intrinsic plasticity, by applying a reinforcement learning algorithm to the stochastic Spike Response Model of spiking neurons. These rules have several features common to plasticity mechanisms experimentally found in the brain. We then demonstrate in simulations of networks of integrateand-fire neurons the efficacy of two simple learning rules involving modulated STDP. One rule is a direct extension of the standard STDP model (modulated STDP), while the other one involves an eligibility trace stored at each synapse that keeps a decaying memory of the relationships between the recent pairs of pre- and postsynaptic spike pairs (modulated STDP with eligibility trace). This latter rule permits learning even if the reward signal is delayed. The proposed rules are able to solve the XOR problem with both rate coded and temporally coded input and to learn a target output firing rate pattern. These learning rules are biologically-plausible, may be used for training generic artificial spiking neural networks, regardless of the neural model used, and suggest the experimental investigation in animals of the existence of reward-modulate...|$|E

A 40 % enhancement of spontaneous neural synchrony, as measured by spike cross-correlation, was found. Hearing sensitivity, measured by auditory brainstem response, was not affected by the kindling sessions. A profound alteration of the tonotopic map in AI was observed with a large extent becoming tuned to similar high characteristic frequencies. The percentage of double tuned neurons was significantly increased, nevertheless the frequency-tuning curve bandwidth was on average reduced.

Inhibition of microtubule dynamics induces <b>persistent</b> <b>modification</b> of biological processes (M arrest) and signaling pathways (mitotic spindle assembly checkpoint activation, Bcl- 2 phosphorylation, c-Jun NH 2 -terminal kinase activation), which ultimately lead to apoptosis through the accumulation of signals that finally reach the threshold for the onset of apoptosis or through diminishing the threshold for engagement of cell death. Microtubules serve also as scaffolds for signaling molecules that regulate apoptosis, such as Bim and survivin, and their release from microtubules affect the activities of these apoptosis regulators. Thus, sustained modification of signaling routes and changes in the scaffolding properties of microtubules seem to constitute two major processes in the apoptotic response induced by microtubule-interfering agents.

The first device, created through the hybridization of the metamaterials and the phase-transition oxide vanadium dioxide (VO 2), is probed using Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy.

This macroscopic control mechanism enables <b>persistent</b> <b>modification</b> of the device, though the hysteretic nature of the VO 2 insulator to metal transition (IMT), on spatial scales {{on the order of}} a few wavelengths of the probing light. In addition to effects from current-induced heating, we show that the optical response can also be modified through the use of an ionic gel to oxidize or reduce the vanadium ions in VO 2, thereby driving its IMT. These measurements also demonstrate the potential for metamaterials as a means of probing metal-to-insulator transitions, allowing for enhanced optical probing of changes in VO 2 properties due to electric fields from the ion gel. The second device we explored is a graphene based device used for examining the modification of graphene’s plasmonic response in conjunction with the ferroelectric high-κ dielectric lead zirconium titanate (PZT) employed as a gate dielectric. By using PZT, the carrier concentration, and therefore the optical properties of graphene, can be heavily modified with small back-gate voltages. Additionally, the use of a ferroelectric dielectric enables a form of memory in the device where transient voltage application leads to persistent changes in graphene properties.

However, the potential coexistence of these two aspects of plasticity remained unclear. In this paper we have investigated the effect of high-frequency stimulation on synaptic transmission and intrinsic excitability at the mossy fiber–granule cell relay of the cerebellum.

40|$|Generally speaking, {{malicious}} code leverages hooks within {{a system to}} divert the control flow. Without them, an attacker is blind to the events occurring in the system, rendering her unable to perform malicious activities (e. g., hiding of files or capturing of keystrokes). However, while hooks {{are an integral part}} of modern attacks, they are at the same time one of their biggest weaknesses: Even the most sophisticated attack can be easily identified if one of its hooks is found. In spite of this fact, hooking mechanisms have remained almost unchanged over the last years and still rely on the <b>persistent</b> <b>modification</b> of code or control data to divert the control flow. As a consequence, hooks represent an abnormality within the system that is permanently evident and can in many cases easily be detected as the hook detection mechanisms of recent years amply demonstrated. In this paper, we propose a novel hooking concept that we refer to as dynamic hooking. Instead of modifying persistent control data permanently, this hooking mechanisms targets transient control data such as return addresses at run-time. The hook itself will thereby reside within non-control data and remains hidden until it is triggered. As a result, there is no evident connection between the hook and the actual control flow change, which enables dynamic hooks to successfully evade existing detection mechanisms. To realize this idea, dynamic hooks make use of exploitation techniques to trigger vulnerabilities at run-time. Due to this approach, dynamic hooks cannot only be used to arbitrarily modify the control flow, but can also be applied to conduct non-control data attacks, which makes them more powerful than their predecessors. We implemented a prototype that makes uses of static program slicing and symbolic execution to automatically extract paths for dynamic hooks that can then be used by a human expert for their realization. To demonstrate this, we used the output provided by our prototype to implement concrete examples of dynamic hooks for both modern Linux and Windows kernels...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{focuses on}} the ultrafast {{dynamics}} of electronic excitations in solids {{and how they are}} influenced by the screening of the Coulomb interaction between charged particles. The impact of screening on electron dynamics is manifold, ranging from modifications of electron-electron scattering rates over trapping of excess charges to massive renormalisation of electronic band structures. The timescales of these dynamical processes are directly accessible by femtosecond time-resolved photoemission and optical spectroscopy. Three exemplary systems are investigated to shed light onto these fundamental processes: Vanadiumdioxide undergoes a phase transition from a monoclinic insulator to a rutile metal. Apart from temperature, doping and other influences, the insulator-to-metal transition can also be driven by photoexcitation. This, in the past, gave rise to a controversy about the timescales of structural and electronic transition and raised the question which of them constitutes the driving mechanism. Using time-resolved photoelectron spectroscopy, it is shown that the electronic band gap of the insulator collapses instantaneously with photoexcitation and without any structural involvement. The reason is a change of screening due to the generation of photoholes. At the same time, the symmetry of the lattice potential changes, as seen by coherent phonon spectroscopy. This potential change is likely to initiate the structural phase transition from monoclinic to rutile structure. However, the initial non-equilibrium situation can be described by a metallic electronic structure with the atoms still in the monoclinic lattice positions. The SrTiO 3 /vacuum interface exhibits a two-dimensional electron gas (2 DEG), which is delocalised within the surface plane, but localised perpendicular to it. The lower dimensionality changes the form of the screened Coulomb interaction and the phase space within the 2 DEG, leading to modified hot carrier lifetimes. These are investigated by time-resolved photoemission spectroscopy: The predicted 2 D behaviour is confirmed and two distinct final states within the unoccupied electronic band structure are discovered. Furthermore, the population of the 2 DEG is transiently increased by photoexcitation from localised in-gap states into the 2 DEG. A different type of screening by dipole moments in amorphous ice layers, is exploited to stabilise and trap electrons within the polar medium in front of a metal surface. Thereby, the mean free path of low energy electrons in amorphous ice is estimated. Moreover, the trapped electrons are used to drive a chemical reaction: A <b>persistent</b> <b>modification</b> of the surface electronic structure of the ice layer is explained via the `dielectron hydrogen evolution reaction'.

And I speak of [...] "persistent modifications" [...] or [...] "stocks" [...] rather than of [...] "varieties," [...] or [...] "races," [...] or [...] "species," [...] because each of these last well-known terms implies, on the part of its employer, a preconceived opinion touching one of those problems, the solution of which is the ultimate object of the science; and in regard to which, therefore, ethnologists are especially bound to keep their minds open and their judgments freely balanced.|$|R
60|$|Such {{is a brief}} {{sketch of}} the {{characters}} and distribution of the <b>persistent</b> <b>modifications,</b> or stocks, of mankind at the present day. If we seek for direct evidence of how long this state of things has lasted, we shall find little enough, and that little far from satisfactory. Of the eleven different stocks enumerated, seven {{have been known to}} us for less than 400 years; and of these seven not one possessed a fragment of written history at the time it came into contact with European civilization. The other four--the Negroes, Mongolians, Xanthochroi, and Melanochroi--have always existed in some of the localities in which they are now found, nor do the negroes ever seem to have voluntarily travelled beyond the limits of their present area. But ancient history is in a great measure the record of the mutual encroachments of the other three stocks.|$|R
40|$|The study {{presented}} here indicates that norepinephrine (NE) selectively induces long-lasting modifications of synaptically mediated {{responses in the}} dentate gyrus of the rat hippocampal slice. A low concentration of NE (1. 0 microM; {{in the presence of}} 50 microM phentolamine, an alpha-adrenergic antagonist) or a 1. 0 microM concentration of the specific beta-adrenergic agonist isoproterenol induced long-lasting pathway-specific alterations of granule cell electrophysiological responses. Excitatory postsynaptic potentials and population spikes evoked by stimulation of the medial perforant pathway (PP) were potentiated for more than 45 min. In contrast, responses to lateral PP stimulation were depressed for the same period. Both potentiation and depression were blocked by the beta-adrenergic antagonist propranolol (1. 0 microM). These results indicate that NE can act differentially on projections to the dentate gyrus arising in the entorhinal cortex. Such selective <b>persistent</b> <b>modifications</b> of cortical circuits may be involved in processes in the mammalian brain underlying attention, learning, and memory...|$|R

Application of this mechanism for realization of diffractive optical elements is demonstrated...|$|R
