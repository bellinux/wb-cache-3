40|$|The role of domain-specific {{interference}} in the complex-span paradigm is still controversial. Here we distinguish two operations within the processing task of this paradigm-a cognitive operation to solve the task and a <b>motor</b> <b>operation</b> to give the answer. Their domain-specific interference with maintenance was investigated within the complex-span paradigm. Presentation of the memoranda-six words or four spatially distributed dots-was interleaved with the presentation of letter pairs to be processed. Cognitive operation domain was manipulated by asking participants to make either a rhyme judgment or a symmetry judgment for each letter pair. <b>Motor</b> <b>operation</b> domain was varied by requiring a response by either speaking or pointing. Cognitive load was held constant. Cognitive and <b>motor</b> <b>operation</b> showed separate domain-specific effects on memory: Visuospatial memory was impaired more by visuospatial than verbal cognitive operations and more by manual-spatial than oral <b>motor</b> <b>operations.</b> In contrast, verbal memory performance was worse when verbal cognitive <b>operations</b> and oral <b>motor</b> <b>operations</b> were executed. The results are discussed {{in relation to the}} multicomponent model, the time-based resource-sharing (TBRS) model, and the Serial Order in a Box-Complex-Span (SOB-CS) model. They imply that models of working memory must incorporate mechanisms that allow for domain-specific {{interference in}} the verbal and the visuospatial domain...|$|R

To track the {{response of}} the visual system during the task and to determine potential differences in the {{response of the}} visual system and in the speed in the simulator and in the real car environment. Methods: The laboratory measurement was realized in a driving simulator OCTAVIA II. The measurement in real conditions was realized in Škoda Octavia as well.

Results: In the simulator the more experienced driver managed to do the <b>parallel</b> <b>motor</b> task within a shorter period of time than the less experienced driver, lower frequency of looks at the radio during the tasks with the more experienced driver was not proved. There was not an evidence of more balanced speed during the drive with the more experienced driver in the simulator.

Elastomeric seals used in the Space Shuttle redesigned solid rocket motors can experience compression times of up to six months.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a system modeling technique for a high-speed gantry-type machine tool driven by linear motors. One feed {{axis of the}} investigated machine tool {{is driven by the}} joint thrust from two <b>parallel</b> linear <b>motors.</b> These two <b>parallel</b> <b>motors</b> are coupled mechanically to form the Y-axis while another standalone motor fixed to a support forms the X-axis. The components in the X-axis, which is treated as the mechanical coupling, are carried by the slides of the Y-axis motors. This configuration is applied to improve the dynamic stiffness of the system and operation speed/acceleration. However, the pre-cise synchronous control of the two <b>parallel</b> and coupled <b>motors</b> would be the major chal-lenge. To overcome this challenge, a multivariable system identification method is developed in this paper. This method is used to construct an accurate system mathemati-cal model for the target coupled system. A synchronous control scheme is then applied to the model obtained using the proposed technique. The performance of the system is experimentally verified with a high-speed S-curve motion profile. The results substantiate the constructed system model and demonstrate the effectiveness of the control scheme. [DOI: 10. 1115 / 1. 4028688...|$|R
