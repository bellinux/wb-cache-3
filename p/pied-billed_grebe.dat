25|$|The Kishwaukee's bird {{population}} is not atypical for the area, which is primarily agricultural. Of the 299 species of bird that regularly occur in Illinois at least 262 {{of them can}} be found along and around the Kishwaukee River. Around 135 species have bred in and around the Kishwaukee River at some time or another. The wetlands that remain along the Kishwaukee {{are some of the most}} desirable habitat for avian species. Exner Marsh and Kloemphen Marsh, both in McHenry County have had several rookeries of great blue heron, <b>pied-billed</b> <b>grebe,</b> king rail, common gallinule, veery the state-endangered yellow-headed blackbird, the state-endangered osprey, and the state-threatened least bittern. Several Bald Eagles hunt and nest in the Rockford area.|$|E

50|$|The <b>pied-billed</b> <b>grebe</b> (Podilymbus podiceps) is {{a species}} of the grebe family of water birds. Since the Atitlán grebe (Podilymbus gigas) has become extinct, it is the sole extant member of the genus Podilymbus. The <b>pied-billed</b> <b>grebe</b> is {{primarily}} found in ponds throughout the Americas. Other names of this grebe include American dabchick, dabchick, Carolina grebe, devil-diver, dive-dapper, dipper, hell-diver, pied-billed dabchick, pied-bill, thick-billed grebe, and water witch.|$|E

50|$|The Atitlán grebe (Podilymbus gigas), {{also known}} as giant grebe, giant <b>pied-billed</b> <b>grebe,</b> or poc, is an extinct water bird, a {{relative}} of the <b>pied-billed</b> <b>grebe.</b> It was endemic at the Lago de Atitlán in Guatemala {{at an altitude of}} 1700 m asl. It was described in 1929 by Ludlow Griscom based on a specimen collected in 1926 and had been overlooked in the past.

50|$|With its open {{coastal water}} and {{abundant}} prey, the refuge plays {{a significant role}} as migration and wintering habitat for the federally protected bald eagle. The bay area also provides prime migration habitat for the peregrine falcon. Many state-protected species use the refuge, including the common loon, <b>pied-billed</b> <b>grebe,</b> osprey, common tern, northern harrier and upland sandpiper. The bay area also serves as New Hampshire's major wintering area for black ducks.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>pied-billed</b> <b>grebe</b> was {{described}} by Carl Linnaeus in the 10th edition of his Systema Naturae in 1758 as Colymbus podiceps.

5000|$|In 2004, the Illinois Audubon Society {{designated}} the Hennepin Lake site as an Important Bird Area of Illinois. [...] Birdwatchers joined other biology observers in logging species sightings in the Refuge. The <b>pied-billed</b> <b>grebe,</b> listed before 2001 as threatened in Illinois, increased in numbers, leading the Illinois Department of Natural Resources to successfully delist the bird. [...] In 2005 the refuge was {{named in honor}} of donors Sue and Wes Dixon. [...] As of 2015 the Wetlands Initiative reports that nearly 30 percent of all the bird species yet recorded in North America have been seen at the site just since 2001.|$|E
50|$|An endemic {{subspecies}} is the Bermuda white-eyed vireo or chick-of-the-village (Vireo griseus bermudianus). The national bird of Bermuda is the white-tailed tropicbird or longtail, {{which is}} a summer migrant to Bermuda, its most northerly breeding site in the world. Other native birds include the eastern bluebird, grey catbird and perhaps the common ground dove. The common moorhen {{is the most common}} native waterbird; very small numbers of American coot and <b>pied-billed</b> <b>grebe</b> are breeding. Small numbers of common tern nest around the coast. The barn owl and mourning dove colonized the island during the 20th century, and the green heron has recently begun to breed.|$|E
50|$|The <b>pied-billed</b> <b>grebe</b> breeds {{in south-central}} Canada, {{throughout}} the United States, Central America, the Caribbean, and temperate South America. These grebes may lay {{up to two}} sets of eggs a year. Their nests sit {{on top of the}} water, their eggs sitting in vegetation that resides in the water. Grebes lay between three and ten bluish white smooth elliptical eggs with the female starting the incubation process. They are incubated for around 23 days by both parents, with the female taking over incubation duties towards the end of that time period. They will cover the nest with nesting material if they have to leave it {{for an extended period of}} time.|$|E
5000|$|Over 90 {{bird species}} -both migratory and resident- have been reported, {{including}} a large nesting heron population (Ardeidae), cormorants (Phalacrocoracidae), pelicans (Pelecanidae), ibises (Threskiornithidae), plovers, dotterels, lapwings (Charadriidae) and gull species (Laridae).
