5|$|Food {{production}} at Gedi likely involved a mixed economy based on livestock, {{as well as}} agricultural and horticultural production. Some foods were introduced through trade. Available crops included millet, African rice, cocoyam, coconuts, bananas, citrus fruits, <b>pomegranates,</b> figs, sugar cane, cotton, and various vegetables, while the principal livestock was likely cattle. Sheep, goats, and chickens {{played an important role}} as well.|$|E

50|$|Agriculture: Jowar, maize, wheat, cotton, sugarcane, bajari and <b>pomegranate</b> are {{the main}} {{agricultural}} produce in Atpadi. <b>Pomegranate</b> plantations are quite new and modern irrigation techniques, like drip irrigation, have helped local farmers to grow <b>pomegranate</b> fields. Being an export product to Middle-East and Arab nations, <b>pomegranate</b> has given higher yields to farmers than traditional crop-based farming. The low monsoon rainfall is advantageous to farmers as the <b>pomegranate</b> is a desert tree.|$|R
5|$|The food of {{the ancient}} Israelites was based on several {{products}} that still play important roles in modern Israeli cuisine. These were known as the seven species: olives, figs, dates, <b>pomegranates,</b> wheat, barley and grapes. The diet, based on locally grown produce, was enhanced by imported spices, readily available due to the country’s position {{at the crossroads of}} east-west trade routes.|$|E
5|$|Fruit {{was popular}} {{and could be}} served fresh, dried, or preserved, and was a common {{ingredient}} in many cooked dishes. Since sugar and honey were both expensive, it was common to include many types of fruit in dishes that called for sweeteners of some sort. The fruits of choice in the south were lemons, citrons, bitter oranges (the sweet type was not introduced until several hundred years later), <b>pomegranates,</b> quinces, and, of course, grapes. Farther north, apples, pears, plums, and strawberries were more common. Figs and dates were eaten all over Europe, but remained rather expensive imports in the north.|$|E

5|$|There {{are various}} climatic areas in Israel and areas it has settled that allow {{a variety of}} {{products}} to be grown. Citrus trees such as orange, lemon and grapefruit thrive on the coastal plain. Figs, <b>pomegranates</b> and olives also grow in the cooler hill areas. The subtropical climate near the Sea of Galilee and in the Jordan River Valley is suitable for mangoes, kiwis and bananas, while the temperate climate of the mountains of the Galilee and the Golan is suitable for grapes, apples and cherries.|$|E
5|$|Gaza's cuisine is {{characterized}} by its generous use of spices and chillies. Other major flavors and ingredients include dill, chard, garlic, cumin, lentils, chickpeas, <b>pomegranates,</b> sour plums and tamarind. Many of the traditional dishes rely on clay pot cooking, which preserves the flavor and texture of the vegetables and results in fork-tender meat. Traditionally, most Gazan dishes are seasonal and rely on ingredients indigenous to the area and its surrounding villages. Poverty has also {{played an important role}} in determining many of the city's simple meatless dishes and stews, such as saliq wa adas ("chard and lentils") and bisara (skinless fava beans mashed with dried mulukhiya leaves and chilies).|$|E
5|$|Rosh Hashana, the Jewish New Year, {{is widely}} celebrated with festive family meals and {{symbolic}} foods. Sweetness {{is the main}} theme and the Rosh Hashana dinners typically begin with apples dipped in honey, and end with honey cake. The challah is usually round, often studded with raisins and drizzled with honey, and other symbolic fruits and vegetables are eaten as an entree, such as <b>pomegranates,</b> carrots, leeks and beets. Fish dishes, symbolizing abundance, are served; for example, gefilte fish is traditional for Ashkenazim, while Moroccan Jews prepare the spicy fish dish, chraime. Honey cake (lekach) is often served as dessert, accompanied by tea or coffee.|$|E

40|$|<b>Pomegranate</b> is {{a source}} of some very potent {{antioxidants}} (tannins, anthocyanins) which are considered to be also potent anti-atherogenic agents. The combination of the above unique various types of <b>pomegranate</b> polyphenols provides a much wider spectrum of action against several types of free radicals. Indeed, <b>pomegranate</b> is superior in comparison to other antioxidants in protecting low-density lipoprotein (LDL, “the bad cholesterol”) and high-density lipoprotein (HDL, “the good cholesterol”) from oxidation, and as a result it attenuates atherosclerosis development and its consequent cardiovascular events. <b>Pomegranate</b> antioxidants are not free, but are attached to the <b>pomegranate</b> sugars, and hence were shown to be beneficial even in diabetic patients. Furthermore, <b>pomegranate</b> antioxidants are unique in their ability to increase the activity of the HDL-associated paraoxonase 1 (PON 1), which breaks down harmful oxidized lipids in lipoproteins, in macrophages, and in atherosclerotic plaques. Finally, unique <b>pomegranate</b> antioxidants beneficially decrease blood pressure. All the above beneficial characteristics make the <b>pomegranate</b> a uniquely healthy fruit...|$|R
40|$|<b>Pomegranate</b> {{seed oil}} has antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and chemo {{preventive}} activities. <b>Pomegranate</b> seed oil is lipophilic substance suitable {{to be prepared}} in emulsion dosage forms. Long-chain triglyceride (LCT) and medium-chain triglyceride (MCT) are commonly used as oil phase in emulsion dosage forms. This research aimed to compare the use of LCT and MCT in the Nano emulsion formula of <b>pomegranate</b> seed oil dosage forms. Formulation of <b>pomegranate</b> seed oil Nano emulsion was conducted using high energy emulsification. Parameters observed were pH, Nano emulsion type, percent transmittance, viscosity, turbidity, and droplet size before and after 3 cycles of freeze-thaw. The result showed {{that there was no}} significant difference between physical properties of <b>pomegranate</b> oil Nano emulsion with LCT as oil phase and <b>pomegranate</b> oil Nano emulsion with MCT as oil phase. Moreover, physical stability of <b>pomegranate</b> oil Nano emulsion with LCT as oil phase was better than <b>pomegranate</b> oil Nano emulsion with MCT as oil phase...|$|R
5|$|It {{became a}} halting post along the newly {{introduced}} regular mail routes connecting Damascus and Cairo, which were run by horse-mounted messengers with colored sashes. Syrian historian Ibn Fadlallah al-Umari {{did not mention}} Darum in his list of the route's stopping points in 1349, instead noting that al-Salqah was the only post between Rafah and Gaza, suggesting that Darum was not a major settlement at the time. However, 14th-century Egyptian historian Ahmad al-Qalqashandi counters al-Umari's account, writing that Darum was the last halting post before Gaza. Roads, bridges, postal stations and a khan (caravanserai) {{were built in the}} town to accommodate the messengers. Pigeon mail service was introduced for which towers were built. Produce available in Darum during this time period included barley, wheat, grapes and grape leaves, olives, raspberries, lemons, figs, sweet melons, <b>pomegranates</b> and dates. Surrounding the town were the encampments of the Batn Jarm, an Arab clan that also lived around Gaza.|$|E
5|$|The {{interior}} decoration was extraordinarily rich. The walls were decorated with marble, {{the roof was}} gilded, while the narthex featured a depiction of the baptism of Constantine the Great. Fragments of ivory, amethyst, gold and colored glass, originally inlaid in the marble sculptures, have also been found at the site, as well as fragments of mosaics. The deliberate evocation of the Solomonic Temple was further reinforced by the preponderance of motifs such as palm trees, <b>pomegranates</b> and lilies in the church's decoration. A notable characteristic, {{which has not been}} attested before in Constantinopolitan art and architecture, is the extensive use of Sassanid Persian decorative motifs such as friezes of running palmette and pomegranate leaves or symmetric geometric and vegetal patterns. Persian motifs became increasingly popular in the 6th century, and were also used in the decoration of the Hagia Sophia. Another exceptional find are ten relief plaques bearing the images of Christ, the Virgin Mary and the Apostles; such images are very rare due to the destruction of human representations in the Iconoclasm of the 8th and 9th centuries.|$|E
5|$|The {{regional}} specialties {{that are}} a feature of early modern and contemporary cuisine were not in evidence in the sparser documentation that survives. Instead, medieval cuisine can be differentiated by the cereals and the oils that shaped dietary norms and crossed ethnic and, later, national boundaries. Geographical variation in eating was primarily the result of differences in climate, political administration, and local customs that varied across the continent. Though sweeping generalizations should be avoided, more or less distinct areas where certain foodstuffs dominated can be discerned. In the British Isles, northern France, the Low Countries, the northern German-speaking areas, Scandinavia and the Baltic, the climate was generally too harsh for the cultivation of grapes and olives. In the south, wine was the common drink for both rich and poor alike (though the commoner usually {{had to settle for}} cheap second pressing wine) while beer was the commoner's drink in the north and wine an expensive import. Citrus fruits (though not the kinds most common today) and <b>pomegranates</b> were common around the Mediterranean. Dried figs and dates were available in the north, but were used rather sparingly in cooking.|$|E

The PubMed search provided 162 references for <b>pomegranate</b> and cancer and 122 references for <b>pomegranate</b> and safety/toxicity. We identified 4 clinical studies investigating 3 <b>pomegranate</b> products, of which one was inappropriate because of the low polyphenol content. The evidence of clinical effectiveness was poor because the quality of the studies was poor. Although there is no concern over safety with the doses used in the clinical studies, <b>pomegranate</b> preparations may be harmful by inducing synthetic drug metabolism through activation of liver enzymes. We have analysed various <b>pomegranate</b> products for their content of anthocyanins, punicalagin, and ellagic acid in order to compare them with the benchmark doses from published data. If the amount of coactive constituents is not declared, patients risk not benefiting from the putative <b>pomegranate</b> effects.
