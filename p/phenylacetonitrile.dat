40|$|AbstractThe ‘black yeast’ Exophiala oligosperma R 1 can utilise various organic {{nitriles}} under {{acidic conditions}} as nitrogen sources. The induction of a <b>phenylacetonitrile</b> converting activity was optimised by growing the strain {{in the presence}} of different nitriles and /or complex or inorganic nitrogen sources. The highest nitrile hydrolysing activity was observed with cells grown with 2 -cyanopyridine and NaNO 3. The cells metabolised the inducer and grew with 2 -cyanopyridine as sole source of nitrogen. Cell extracts converted various (substituted) benzonitriles and phenylacetonitriles. They usually converted the isomers carrying a substituent in the meta-position with higher relative activities than the corresponding para- or ortho-substituted isomers. Aliphatic substrates such as acrylonitrile and 2 -hydroxy- 3 -butenenitrile were also hydrolysed. The highest specific activity was detected with 4 -cyanopyridine. Most nitriles were almost exclusively converted to the corresponding acids and no or only low amounts of the corresponding amides were formed. The cells hydrolysed amides only with extremely low activities. It was therefore concluded that the cells harboured a nitrilase activity. The specific activities of whole cells and cell extracts were compared for different nitriles and evidence obtained for limitation in the substrate-uptake by whole cells. The conversion of 2 -hydroxy- 3 -butenenitrile to 2 -hydroxy- 3 -butenoic acid at pH 4 demonstrated the unique ability of cells of E. oligosperma R 1 to hydrolyse aliphatic α-hydroxynitriles under acidic conditions.

CBMAI 936, Penicillium oxalicum CBMAI 1185, Penicillium citrinum CBMAI 1186, Penicillium decaturense CBMAI 1234, Penicillium raistriicki CBMAI 1235, Cladosporium sp. CBMAI 1237 e Aspergillus sydowii CBMAI 1241 para avaliar o potencial enzimático destes micro-organismos frente à fenilacetonitrila 1. Estes micro-organismos foram isolados de esponjas e alga coletadas do litoral norte do estado de São Paulo. A triagem foi realizada em meio sólido mineral suplementado com glicose e fenilacetonitrila 1 como única fonte de nitrogênio. Dentre os fungos, 8 adaptaram-se muito bem ao substrato 1 nas respectivas quantidades 5 µL (0, 04 mmol), 10 µL (0, 08 mmol) e 15 µL (0, 12 mmol). Em seguida, a triagem foi realizada em meio líquido (20 µL (0, 17 mmol), 40 µL (0, 35 mmol) e 60 µL (0, 50 mmol) de fenilacetonitrila 1 e obteve um bom crescimento de massa micelial dos fungos. Experimentos realizados na ausência de fenilacetonitrila 1, tanto em meio sólido, quanto em meio líquido, não promoveram o crescimento microbiano, evidenciando que as enzimas capazes de hidrolisarem nitrilas presente no sistema catalítico são construtivas. A fenilacetonitrila 1 foi biotransformada ao ácido 2 -(2 -hidroxifenil) acético 1 b (51 % pelo fungo A. sydowii CBMAI 934) por todos os fungos adaptados. Devido ao bom crescimento do fungo A. sydowii CBMAI 934 em meio mineral sólido e líquido na presença de fenilacetonitrila 1, este fungo foi selecionado para promover reações de hidrólise frente a diferentes organonitrilas, arilcetonitrilas: 4 -fluorofenilacetonitrila 2, 4 -clorofenilacetonitrila 3, 4 -metoxifenilacetonitrila 4, 2 -metilfenilacetonitrila 5, 3 -metilfenilacetonitrila 6, 4 -metilfenilacetonitrila 7 aos seus correspondentes ácidos carboxílicos 4 -fluorofenilacético 2 a (51 %), 4 -clorofenilacético 3 a (55 %), 4 -metoxifenilacético 4 a (43 %), 2 -metilfenilacético 5 a (76 %), 3 -metilfenilacético 6 a (52 %) e 4 -metilfenilacético 7 a (46 %), em nitrila alifática, 2 -(1 -ciclo-hexen- 1 -il) acetonitrila 8 ao ácido 2 -(1 -ciclo-hexen- 1 -il) acético 8 a (28 %) e nitrila hetero-aromática, 2 -cianopiridina 19 a 2 -piridinamida 19 a. As reações foram acompanhadas por GC-FID e os produtos de biotransformações foram isolados e caracterizados por GC-MS, HRMS, RMN de 1 H e de 13 C. Este trabalho envolveu o primeiro estudo frente à biotransformação de nitrilas por micro-organismos de origem marinha. In {{the present}} study, a {{screening}} of 12 marine fungi Penicillium miczynskii CBMAI 930, Penicillium raistriicki CBMAI 931, Aspergillus sydowii CBMAI 933, Aspergillus sydowii CBMAI 934, Aspergillus sydowii CBMAI 935, Bionectria sp. CBMAI 936, Penicillium oxalicum CBMAI 1185, Penicillium citrinum CBMAI 1186, Penicillium decaturense CBMAI 1234, Penicillium raistriicki CBMAI 1235, Cladosporium sp. CBMAI 1237 and Aspergillus sydowii CBMAI 1241 was done in order to evaluate the enzymatic potential of these microorganisms in <b>phenylacetonitrile</b> 1. These microorganisms were isolated from sponges and algae collected at {{the north shore of}} Sao Paulo State. The screening was carried out in solid mineral medium supplemented with glucose and <b>phenylacetonitrile</b> 1 as the only source of nitrogen. Among the fungi, 8 adapted to the subtract really well 5 µL (0, 04 mmol), 10 µL (0, 09 mmol) and 15 µL (0, 13 mmol). Afterwards, a screening was carried out in liquid medium 20 µL (0, 17 mmol), 40 µL (0, 35 mmol) and 60 µL (0, 50 mmol) of <b>phenylacetonitrile</b> 1) and a great mass of the fungi was obtained. The <b>phenylacetonitrile</b> 1 was biotransformed in the acid 2 -(2 -hydroxyphenyl) acetic 1 b (51 % by the fungus A. sydowii CBMAI 934) by all the adapted fungi. Experiments carried out without <b>phenylacetonitrile</b> 1, both in solid and liquid media did not show microbial growth. Enzymes which hydrolyzed nitriles present in the catalytic system were constructive. Due to the good growth rate of the fungus A. sydowii CBMAI 934 in solid and liquid mineral media in presence of <b>phenylacetonitrile</b> 1, this fungus was selected to promote hydrolysis reactions in different organonitriles, arylacetonitriles: 4 -fluorophenylacetonitrile 2, 4 -chlorophenylacetonitrile 3, 4 -methoxyphenylacetonitrile 4, 2 -methylphenylacetonitrile 5, 3 -methylphenylacetonitrile 6, 4 -methylphenylacetonitrile 7 in their corresponding carboxylic acids 4 -fluorophenylacetic 2 a (51 %), 4 -chlorophenylacetic 3 a (55 %), 4 -methoxyphenylacetic 4 a (43 %), 2 -methylphenylacetic 5 a (76 %), 3 -methylphenylacetic 6 a (52 %) and 4 -methylphenylacetic 7 a (46 %), aliphatic nitrile 2 -(1 -cyclohexen- 1 -yl) acetonitrile 8 to 2 -(1 -cyclohexen- 1 -yl) acetic acid 8 a (28 %) and heteroaromatic nitrile 2 -cyanopiridine 19 to 2 -pyridinecarboxamides 19 a. The reactions were monitored by GC-FID and the biotransformation products were isolated and characterized by GC-MS, HRMS and 1 H and 13 C NMR.

40|$|Syntheses of {{variously}} substituted diphenylpiperidine derivatives were {{accomplished and}} their reactions, as intermediates {{in a new}} synthetic route to the physiologically active phenanthroindolizidine alkaloids and their analogues, were investigated. The s 5 nithesis involves Michael addition of <b>phenylacetonitrile</b> donors to ethyl cinnamate acceptors, yielding a series of ethyl- 3, 4 -diphenyl- 4 -cyanobutanoates bearing aromatic methoxy, methylenedioxy and iodo substituents. Reductive cyclisation of these cyanoesters with Raney-nickel or copper chromite catalysts gave, imder exactly controlled conditions, either secondary or tertiary diphenylpiperidine derivatives or the corresponding dC - lactams. The ratio of the cis- and trans- racemates formed in each reaction was found to vary with changes in reduction temperature and with the substituent pattern of the starting material...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: The {{roles of}} anti-juvenile hormone (precocene II) on phase changes and {{pheromone}} production {{were examined in}} laboratory-bred gregarious desert locust, Schistocerca gregaria. Precocene II was applied to last instar nymphs and newly emerged adults in gregarious phase. Generally, the 5 th instar nymphs exhibited a higher sensitivity to topical appli-cation of precocen II than the adults. In contrast, the adults exhibited a higher sensitivity to injection of precocen II in comparison to 5 th instar nymphs. Topical application or injection of precocene II inhibited pheromone production (as measured {{by the amount of}} <b>phenylacetonitrile</b> released). Both topical application to 5 th instar nymphs and injection to adults affected the external body coloration, sexual behavior and mating of gregarious adult males, S. gregaria in com-parison to control insects...|$|E
40|$|The boxelder bug (BEB), Boisea rubrolineata (Heteroptera: Rhopalidae), is a {{specialist}} herbivore of boxelder trees, Acer negundo. BEBs form spectacular aggregations on (i) pistillate A. negundo when seeds are maturing, (ii) {{in and around}} shelters in fall and winter, and (iii) in response to warm sunlight. When sunbathing, BEBs release from their posterior dorsal abdominal gland an odorous blend of monoterpenes with heretofore unknown biological function. We reveal that (1) BEBs exploit semiochemicals (<b>phenylacetonitrile,</b> 2 -phenethyl acetate) from host trees to locate them during foraging and colonization, (2) aggregation and sexual communication of BEBs are mediated by a complex pheromone system, and (3) BEBs in warm sunlight, but not in shade, exude and spread copious amounts of monoterpenes onto their cuticle. These monoterpenes do not serve as a pheromone, but rather a means of sanitation that interferes with spore germination and growth of the pathogenic fungus Beauvaria bassiana...|$|E
