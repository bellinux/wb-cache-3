In arid Australia flooding rains trigger flushes in primary productivity that allow ephemeral irruptions of consumer organisms, but they also provide conditions for 2 ̆ 7 <b>perfect</b> <b>storms</b> 2 ̆ 7 : wildfires that are carried by flood-stimulated increases in fuel load. Here we describe demographic responses of the long-haired rat Rattus villosissimus to flood rains and prescribed burns in the Mitchell grass downs of central Queensland, Australia, during a broad-scale irruption of this species in 2011. Populations were sampled on three trapping grids on two occasions before and two occasions after control burns in April 2011, and compared with populations sampled at the same times on three further grids that remained unburnt. Rat populations declined temporarily just after the fires, but survival, sex ratio, body condition, reproduction and other demographic parameters remained unaffected by the burn treatment. The temporary declines in rat numbers on the burnt grids were probably caused by resource shortages, but subsequent increases in rat numbers suggest that these impacts were not severe. If small-scale prescribed burns reduce the chance of landscape-wide wildfires taking hold, we suggest that they should effectively allow long-haired rats to weather <b>perfect</b> <b>storms</b> in future. © 2013 The Authors...|$|R

5|$|The most {{significant}} storm {{of the season}} was Hurricane Bob, {{which at the time}} was among the ten costliest United States hurricanes. After brushing the Outer Banks of North Carolina and Long Island in New York, the hurricane made landfall on Rhode Island. It caused $1.5billion in damage (1991USD), mostly in Massachusetts, and 17fatalities. The strongest hurricane of the season was Claudette, which reached peak winds of 135mph (215km/h) near Bermuda. It passed near the island but did not cause any damage. Tropical Storm Fabian was the only tropical storm to move over or near Cuba or Florida, producing heavy rainfall but no damage. Hurricane Grace, the final named storm of the season, provided the energy that {{led to the development of}} a powerful nor'easter known as the <b>Perfect</b> <b>Storm.</b> Originating from an extratropical storm, the <b>Perfect</b> <b>Storm</b> intensified while moving westward toward New England, leaving $200million in damage and causing coastal damage from Puerto Rico to Florida and northward through Canada.

High tides along the shore were only surpassed by the 1944 hurricane, while {{significant}} bay flooding occurred. Strong waves and persistent intense winds cause extreme beach erosion, amounting to 13.5million cubic feet (383,000m3) of sand lost in one location. In all, damage amounts to $90million (1991USD, $142million 2008USD), though no deaths occur in the state.|$|E
5|$|Waves {{and high}} tides {{from the storm}} caused {{flooding}} along the Pamlico Sound side of Ocracoke and southern Hatteras Island. High tides also resulted in overwash in Pea Island, forcing the closure of Highway 12 due to 12inches (305mm) of salt water. High tides from the storm also destroyed two houses in South Nags Head and one in Rodanthe, two of which were previously condemned after the 1991 <b>Perfect</b> <b>Storm.</b> Three other houses in the Outer Banks were threatened by the storm. Elsewhere in the Outer Banks, damage was minimal, and was limited to pedestrian ramps and steps to the beachfront.|$|E

5|$|The <b>Perfect</b> <b>Storm</b> {{originated}} from a cold front that exited {{the east coast}} of the United States. On October 28, the front spawned an extratropical low to the east of Nova Scotia. Around that time, a ridge extended from the Appalachian Mountains northeastward to Greenland, with a strong high pressure center over eastern Canada. The blocking ridge forced the extratropical low to track toward the southeast and later to the west. Hurricane Grace was swept aloft by its cold front into the warm conveyor belt circulation of the deep cyclone on October 29. The cyclone significantly strengthened {{as a result of the}} temperature contrast between the cold air to the northwest and the warmth and humidity from the remnants of Hurricane Grace. The low pressure system continued deepening as it drifted toward the United States. It had an unusual retrograde motion for a nor'easter, beginning a set of meteorological circumstances that occur only once every 50 to 100 years. Most nor'easters affect New England from the southwest.|$|E

He seeks to do so in BONG HiTS 4 JESUS by incorporating interviews with and discussion about the parties, some bystanders, and various judges and lawyers who worked on the case throughout its multiyear history.

40|$|The {{price of}} {{emission}} permits is deemed {{too low to}} mitigate climate change. In three studies, policy approaches to pricing carbon in a market setting are examined. First, the emission permit market is analyzed comparatively to how the ethanol mandate impacted prices in the corn market. This leads {{to the realization that}} the marketization of carbon is more like a currency than a physical commodity. The next study examines emission permits as a monetary policy tool. Emissions correlate GDP output, thus central banks can use emission permits as forward guidance, as a means to optimize the price for climate change mitigation, and as an alternative to interest rates. Opinions of thought leaders are used to question the acceptability of emission permits as a monetary policy tool. The final study is an ethical analysis using deontology, utilitarianism and virtue ethics within a pragmatic philosophical context, analyzing carbon as a monetary policy tool. In order for carbon as a monetary policy tool to be considered ethically acceptable, it must satisfy the temporal, spatial and institutional dilemmas of climate change articulated in Stephen Gardiner’s <b>Perfect</b> Moral <b>Storm.</b> Under this ethical standard, it is found that using carbon as a monetary policy tool can help address these concerns, but not solve them alone.

40|$|Even {{with the}} {{considerable}} progress in atmospheric science during the twentieth century, there remains considerable {{room for improvement}} in {{the accuracy of the}} public warnings of tornadoes, flash floods, large hail and damaging thunderstorm winds. But even if we had perfect knowledge of the process of tornadogenesis, for example, inadequate atmospheric sampling and measurements would still prevent warning accuracy from ever reaching 100 percent. Stewart (2000) states the problem succinctly: Every prediction contains an element of irreducible uncertainty … actions that are based on predictions lead to two kinds of errors. One is when an event that is predicted does not occur, i. e., a false alarm. The second is when an event occurs but is not predicted, i. e., a surprise. There is an inevitable tradeoff between the two kinds of errors; steps taken to reduce one will increase the other. This article examines the effects of false alarms and proposes two classifications of false alarms. Further, some rudimentary estimates of the costs of false alarms are presented. Two Types of False Alarms To use tornado warnings as an example, if one were to turn the clock back fifty years, tornado warnings were in their infancy. The “hook echo ” (Bigler 1956) was yet to be discovered. The initial Weather Bureau tornado warnings were issued on a countywide basis, in part, because our knowledge was so lacking {{it was not possible to}} isolate the portions of the thunderstorm where a tornado was likely to occur.

40|$|The ‘smart’(ly) {{disruptive}} {{world of}} the consumer internet of things (CIOT) is here. Australian consumers are poised to live in ‘smart’ homes, monitor their ‘smart’ selves and ride in ever- ‘smart’er cars, while smart(er) cities, transport and industrial IOT brilliance changes their world, and the world around them, irretrievably. This thesis both celebrates and exposes this radical, impending CIOT-driven disruption in all its consumer-abusive, privacy-intrusive glory. It posits that consumers and regulators do not yet understand the adverse implications of this new panopticon technology which surveys everything and blurs traditional understandings of human autonomy and privacy, nor has consumer law yet properly tackled the many adverse implications of an expanded big data universe: from ubiquitous collection to consumer profiling and analytics, anonymisation failures, data breach and so on. With {{the coming of the}} consumer IOT, there is a <b>perfect</b> consumer-adverse <b>storm,</b> in which multiple fast-paced and little-regulated technologies collide - seismically. As one of the first few legal studies of the consumer internet of things in Australia, this thesis partly fills a vast gap in scholarly literature by scoping the Australian CIOT and its stakes, identifying potential gaps in Australian consumer protective laws, and adapting the Australian Consumer Law Policy Framework (Framework) to the critical question of whether the CIOT exhibits consumer detriment sufficient to warrant regulatory action now, using the smart car, home and self contexts as rapidly-evolving reference-points. Informed by aspects of behavioural economics, regulatory theory and the first international CIOT cases and defect reports, this thesis is a confronting snapshot which concludes with a call for strategic policy and various regulatory and self-regulatory actions. It also proposes a simple series of draft principles for CIOT policy and regulation which synthesise established best practice by design and default, conform to the normative Framework values and offer an improved prospect of protecting and realising the indisputable public interest in a principled, morally-grounded and trusted CIOT world...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe twenty {{first century}} is rapidly {{becoming}} the <b>perfect</b> energy <b>storm,</b> modern society {{is faced with}} volatile energy prices and growing environmental concerns as well as energy supply and security issues. One {{of the greatest challenges}} facing mankind in the twenty first century is energy. Fossil fuels such as coal, petroleum and natural gas have been the main energy resources for everything vital for human society. The burning of fossil fuels has caused and is causing damage to the environment of earth. By 2050 the demand for energy could double or even triple as the global population grows and developing countries expand their economies. This has already raised concerns over potential supply difficulties, depletion of energy resources and expediting environmental impacts like ozone layer depletion, global warming and climate change etc. The most abundant energy resource available to human society is solar energy. The utilization of solar energy is as old as human history. Among various types of renewable energy resources, solar energy is the least utilized. Air conditioning is essential for maintaining thermal comfort in indoor environments, particularly for hot and humid climates. Today, air conditioning comprising cooling and dehumidification has become a necessity in commercial and residential buildings and industrial processes. During the summer, the demand for electricity greatly increases because of the extensive use of air-conditioning systems. This is a source of major problems in the country's electricity supply and contributes to an increase of CO 2 emissions causing the environmental pollution and global warming. On the other hand, vapour compression air conditioning systems have impacts on stratospheric ozone depletion because of the chlorofluorocarbons (CFC) and the hydro fluorocarbon (HCFC) refrigerants. The use of solar energy to drive cooling cycles is attractive since the cooling load is roughly in phase with solar energy availability. To cool with solar thermal energy, one solution is to use an absorption chillier using water and lithium bromide solution. Solar air conditioning systems help to minimize fossil fuel energy use. Among the evolving energy efficient air conditioning technologies are liquid desiccant air conditioning (LDAC) systems, which have showed promising performance during the past decades and are believed to be a strong competitor with the widely used conventional air conditioning systems (CAC). Desiccant evaporation cooling technology is environmental friendly and can be used to condition the indoor environment of buildings. Unlike conventional air conditioning systems, the desiccant air conditioning systems can be driven by low grade heat sources such as solar energy and industrial waste heat. In this study, a focus is made on reduction in Air Conditioning capacity, fuel savings and emission reductions attainable through the use of solar energy...|$|R
40|$|In {{the wake}} of the recent {{financial}} crisis of 2008, and in the run-up to what some are calling a <b>perfect</b> fiscal <b>storm,</b> {{there is no shortage of}} commentary on the need for fundamental market reform. Though there are certainly disagreements about where the real problems are and what to do, almost all the commentary remains wedded to an old and entirely false image of “free competition. ” Of course, there is hardly consensus about whether markets require the heavy hand of regulative control, or are better left to regulate themselves, but a belief in the distinction between these two images — competition and control — is common ground. Unfortunately for all of us, this ground is a mirage. The idea of a pre-legal, “self-regulating” market has always been, and still is, a deep and abiding fiction. This Article argues that our continued commitments to the legal distinctions between competitive and controlled markets are far more dangerous than they are pedantic. If there is serious interest in avoiding the circular pitfalls of market society, which no doubt there is, attention must be paid to the manner in which the market is legally constructed from the bottom up, and the fact that there is nothing natural or necessary about that construction. In order to understand the dominant characterization of market society, we must map the basic legal postures that populate our conversations about free markets and the interventionist state — postures that have been built in the fields of classic and modern liberalism. This Article endeavors to stylize these liberalisms through an analysis of representative texts from John Locke, Henry Carter Adams, and Frank Knight. Though important, the awareness provided by this intellectual history of liberal legalism is insufficient for serious thinking about market reform — what is also needed is a critique of that history, a critique that reminds us that while liberalism provides legal rules for the creation and maintenance of the market, these rules are never neutral with respect to the distribution of wealth and resources among market players. In service of that recollection, the Article surveys three moments in a critical history of economic liberalism through a sample of texts from Karl Marx, Robert Hale, Morris Cohen, and Duncan Kennedy. To be sure, a successful strategy of market reform requires a great deal more than a familiarity with the legal styles of classic and modern liberalism, and leftist critiques of the liberal market’s legal structure. But that’s hardly the point. The point is that a successful strategy of market reform can’t do without them...|$|R
