40|$|This is a {{case study}} of {{participant}} narratives in the <b>prior</b> learning <b>assessment</b> and recognition (PLAR) process at The Royal Military College (RMC) in Kingston, Ontario. RMC is {{under the direction of the}} Department of National Defence Canada, and has a full-time staff dedicated to the maintenance and expansion of the <b>prior</b> learning <b>assessment</b> and recognition process. The research problem of this thesis is to ask if a participant in a <b>prior</b> learning <b>assessment</b> and recognition program acknowledges their own knowledge as valuable and how this may be linked to the motivating factors that cause the participant to return to formal study. In order to provide a context for the research problem, I use the literature review to examine the history of <b>prior</b> learning <b>assessment</b> and recognition programs in Canada. Through a mail survey, the use of participant narratives provides a voice to the literature in discussing the question of how knowledge is valued in a <b>prior</b> learning <b>assessment</b> program. Although the focus of the thesis will be <b>prior</b> learning <b>assessment</b> and recognition in Canada, the background to the concept of <b>prior</b> learning <b>assessment</b> is found in the United States. It is therefore essential to begin there in order to provide a context in which to understand the current Canadian situation. As a timeline the study begins with the post-World War II era and continues to the present.

According to the principles of cognitive task analysis, a frame and a procedure to be strictly executed were mapped out for the <b>prior</b> <b>assessment</b> of higher mathematics test items. Taking into account the characteristics of math problems, we designed such indexes as number of elements in a problem, element identification difficulty, number of principles used in answering, principle identification difficulty and cognitive load.

40|$|This {{paper was}} {{previously}} titled “Optimists, Pessimists, and Managerial Disclosures. ” We {{would like to}} thank Nahum Melumad, Robert Verrecchia, and the participants of workshops at UCLA This paper explores a setting in which analysts and other investors in the marketplace face uncertainty over how to interpret information contained in a manager’s voluntary disclosures. It is shown that when such uncertainty exists and investors ’ <b>prior</b> <b>assessment</b> of firm value was favorable, the manager will disclose his private information when it is favorable as well as when it is sufficiently unfavorable. In contrast, when their <b>prior</b> <b>assessment</b> was unfavorable, an equilibrium exists in which the manager will withhold his information when it is unfavorable as well as when it is sufficiently favorable. These results differ from those in a setting in which investors are assumed to be able to perfectly interpret managerial disclosures, where there exists only one disclosure and one nondisclosure region. These differences highlight the need for the manager to assess whether uncertainty over information interpretation exists, in determining his disclosure strategy. If it does, the manager’s strategy will depend on the prior valuation of the firm in the marketplace, as it helps him infer how value-relevant information is likely to be interpreted by investors.

40|$|This study {{examined}} the knowledge, perceptions and benefits of <b>prior</b> learning <b>assessment</b> as perceived by the Faculty and Management of Cabot College. [...] The study focused on: (a) their perceptions regarding learning from past work and life experiences; (b) what non-college learning activities they felt can result in learning equivalent to that taught in college courses; (c) their past practices of <b>prior</b> learning <b>assessment</b> and methods they felt should be used or {{would be willing to}} use; (d) who they felt should determine credit award, how it should appear on the student's transcript, and the maximum amount of credit that should be awarded; and (e) their perceived benefits of <b>prior</b> learning <b>assessment</b> for students and Cabot College. [...] The target group for the study was the full-time Faculty and Academic Management at Cabot College during the spring of 1994. Cabot College was selected for the study {{because it was the only}} public post secondary institution that was actively involved in the development and implementation of <b>prior</b> learning <b>assessment.</b> Also, the researcher anticipated that the information obtained would be useful in the continued development and implementation of <b>prior</b> learning <b>assessment</b> at Cabot College. [...] A questionnaire was used in the collection of data. The response rate was 81 % for Management and 52 % for Faculty. Frequencies and means were used to determine the correlation between the independent and dependent variables. Analysis of Variance and Chi-Square were used to analyze the data, but no significant difference was found. [...] The findings of the study indicated that Faculty and Management at Cabot College are receptive to the concept of <b>prior</b> learning <b>assessment.</b> Both groups felt that many non-college learning activities can result in knowledge and/or skills equivalent to that taught in college courses. While there has been minimal use of <b>prior</b> learning <b>assessment</b> in the past, both groups indicated they would like to see more application of it and generally felt that whatever method was used, the pass mark should be the same as the pass mark for the particular course the student was challenging. [...] Responses varied on who they felt should make the decision regarding credit award for non-credit learning, the maximum amount of credit that should be awarded, and how it should be transcripted. It was clear, however, that the transcript should indicate that the credit was obtained through <b>prior</b> learning <b>assessment.</b> [...] Finally, most respondents agreed that <b>prior</b> learning <b>assessment</b> is beneficial both to students and to Cabot College. The most common benefit cited by both groups was that it can save the student time. For Cabot College, respondents indicated that <b>prior</b> learning <b>assessment</b> would yield better use of both physical and human resources within the college...|$|R

40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{consider}} the generalized gamma distribution as introduced in Gåsemyr and Natvig (1998). This distribution enters naturally in Bayesian inference in exponential survival models with left censoring. In the paper mentioned above it is shown that the weighted sum of products of generalized gamma distributions is a conjugate prior for the parameters of component lifetimes, having autopsy data in a Marshall-Olkin shock model. A corresponding result is shown in Gåsemyr and Natvig (1999) for independent, exponentially distributed component lifetimes in a model with partial monitoring of components with applications to preventive system maintenance. A discussion in the present paper strongly indicates that expressing the posterior distribution {{in terms of the}} generalized gamma distribution is computationally efficient compared to using the ordinary gamma distribution in such models. Furthermore, we present two types of sequential Metropolis-Hastings algorithms that may be used in Bayesian inference in situations where exact methods are intractable. Finally these types of algorithms are compared with standard simulation techniques and analytical results in arriving at the posterior distribution of the parameters of component lifetimes in special cases of the mentioned models. It seems that one of these types of algorithms may be very favourable when <b>prior</b> <b>assessments</b> are updated by several data sets and when there are significant discrepancies between the <b>prior</b> <b>assessments</b> and the data...|$|R
