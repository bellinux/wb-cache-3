5|$|As {{prosperity}} {{began to}} return in the 1980s, the city {{was stunned by the}} Wah Mee massacre in 1983, when 13 people were killed in an illegal gambling club in the Seattle Chinatown-International District. Beginning with Microsoft's 1979 move from Albuquerque, New Mexico, to nearby Bellevue, Washington, Seattle and its suburbs became home to a number of technology companies including Amazon.com, F5 Networks, RealNetworks, Nintendo of America, McCaw Cellular (now part of AT Mobility), VoiceStream (now T-Mobile), and biomedical corporations such as HeartStream (later <b>purchased</b> <b>by</b> Philips), Heart Technologies (later <b>purchased</b> <b>by</b> Boston Scientific), Physio-Control (later <b>purchased</b> <b>by</b> Medtronic), ZymoGenetics, ICOS (later <b>purchased</b> <b>by</b> Eli Lilly and Company) and Immunex (later <b>purchased</b> <b>by</b> Amgen). This success brought an influx of new residents with a population increase within city limits of almost 50,000 between 1990 and 2000, and saw Seattle's real estate become some of the most expensive in the country. In 1993, the movie Sleepless in Seattle brought the city further national attention. Many of the Seattle area's tech companies remained relatively strong, but the frenzied dot-com boom years ended in early 2001.|$|E
