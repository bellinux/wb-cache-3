40|$|The {{effectiveness}} of using 75 aides {{in special education}} classrooms in Albuquerque, New Mexico, was evaluated in terms of impact on students, classrooms, and staff. Interviews, record reviews, and survey research were used to collect data. Findings revealed that aides were perceived as having {{a positive impact on}} the children through more individualized instruction, as well as emotional and academic support. Program and teacher impact included greater <b>planning</b> and <b>preparation</b> <b>time</b> and emotional support for teachers. In addition, administrators and teachers felt that the aides increased program effectiveness and positively affected staff morale and interaction. Mere was a need for clarification of aides' roles with mainstreamed students. Staff voiced a need for inservice on better using the aides, improving communication between teachers and aides, and helping the aides work with students with various types of handicaps.

40|$|When {{subjects}} are intentionally preparing a curved trajectory, they {{are engaged in}} a time-consuming trajectory planning process that is separate from target selection. To investigate the construction of such a plan, we examined the effect of artificially shortening <b>preparation</b> <b>time</b> on the performance of intentionally curved trajectories using the Timed Response task that enforces initiation of movements prematurely. Fifteen subjects performed obstacle avoidance movements toward one of four targets that were presented 25 or 350 ms before the “go” signal, imposing short and long <b>preparation</b> <b>time</b> conditions with mean values of 170 ms and 493 ms, respectively. While trajectories with short <b>preparation</b> <b>times</b> showed target specificity at their onset, they were significantly more variable and showed larger angular deviations from the lines connecting their initial position and the target, compared to the trajectories with long <b>preparation</b> <b>times.</b> Importantly, the trajectories of the short <b>preparation</b> <b>time</b> movements still reached their end-point targets accurately, with comparable movement durations. We hypothesize that success in the short <b>preparation</b> <b>time</b> condition is a result of an online control mechanism that allows further refinement of the plan during its execution and study this control mechanism with a novel trajectory analysis approach using minimum jerk optimization and geometrical modeling approaches. Results show a later agreement of the short <b>preparation</b> <b>time</b> trajectories with the optimal minimum jerk trajectory, accompanied by a later initiation of a parabolic segment. Both observations are consistent with the existence of an online trajectory planning process. Our results suggest that when <b>preparation</b> <b>time</b> is not sufficiently long, subjects execute a more variable and less optimally prepared initial trajectory and exploit online control mechanisms to refine their actions on the fly...|$|R

40|$|In this paper, {{realistic}} production-inventory {{models with}} shortages for a deteriorating item with imprecise <b>preparation</b> <b>time</b> for production (hereafter called <b>preparation</b> <b>time)</b> has been formulated and an inventory policy is proposed for maximum profit in a finite time horizon. Here, {{the rate of}} production is constant, demand depends on selling price, marketing cost, and inventory level, and setup cost depends on <b>preparation</b> <b>time.</b> The imprecise <b>preparation</b> <b>time</b> {{is assumed to be}} represented by a fuzzy number and is first transformed to a corresponding interval number and then following interval mathematics, the objective function for total profit over the finite time horizon is changed to respective multi-objective functions. These functions are maximized and solved for a set of Pareto optimal solution {{with the help of the}} weighted sum method using the generalized reduced gradient technique. Different case studies have been made depending upon the occurrence of shortages. The models have been illustrated by numerical data. Pareto-optimal solutions for different weights are obtained and presented in tables and graphs.

METHODS:A retrospective analysis from August 2009 to August 2012 in our hospital in 320 cases treated by LASEK in myopic patients(640 eyes), {{the patients were}} grouped according to age, 18 - 23 years, 24 - 29 years, 30 - 35 years, and greater than 35 year were divided into 4 groups(A, B, C, D), each group according to whether wearing contact lenses for more than 3 months, divided into 2 subgroups(I, II), the average flap <b>preparation</b> <b>time</b> statistics for each group. RESULTS: Most of the patients in postoperative 2 - 4 h after a foreign body sensation, presented ocular pain. Corneal epithelium was basically healed after about 7 days. Visual acuity recovered to the best after 20 d. After 6 months, the average visual acuity was 1. 23 ± 0. 15. Flap <b>preparation</b> <b>time</b> 11 - 30 s, average 18 ± 3. 5 s. With the increase of age, flap <b>preparation</b> <b>time</b> was significantly prolonged. For those wearing contact lens over 3 months, flap <b>preparation</b> <b>time</b> was significantly longer.
