25|$|While air {{pollution}} hotspots affect {{a variety of}} populations, some groups {{are more likely to}} be located in hotspots. <b>Previous</b> <b>studies</b> <b>have</b> shown disparities in exposure to pollution by race and/or income. Hazardous land uses (toxic storage and disposal facilities, manufacturing facilities, major roadways) tend to be located where property values and income levels are low. Low socioeconomic status can be a proxy for other kinds of social vulnerability, including race, a lack of ability to influence regulation and a lack of ability to move to neighborhoods with less environmental pollution. These communities bear a disproportionate burden of environmental pollution and are more likely to face health risks such as cancer or asthma.|$|E
25|$|In August 2017, the {{findings}} of tests conducted by astronomers using the European Southern Observatory’s Very Large Telescope (VLT), among other instruments, were released, and which positively demonstrated gravitational effects predicted by Albert Einstein. One of which tests observed the orbit of the stars circling around Sagittarius A*, a black hole about 4 million times as massive as the sun. Einstein’s theory suggested that large objects bend the space around them, causing other objects to diverge from the straight lines they would otherwise follow. Although <b>previous</b> <b>studies</b> <b>have</b> validated Einstein's theory, {{this was the first}} time his theory had been tested on such a gigantic object. The findings were published in The Astrophysical Journal.|$|E

25|$|In 2008, two {{international}} {{research teams}} published analyses of large-scale genotyping of large samples of Europeans, using over 300,000 autosomal SNPs. With {{the exception of}} usual isolates such as Basques, Finns and Sardinians, the European population lacked sharp discontinuities (clustering) as <b>previous</b> <b>studies</b> <b>have</b> found (see Seldin et al. 2006 and Bauchet et al. 2007), {{although there was a}} discernible south to north gradient. Overall, they found only a low level of genetic differentiation between subpopulations, and differences which did exist were characterised by a strong continent-wide correlation between geographic and genetic distance. In addition, they found that diversity was greatest in southern Europe due a larger effective population size and/or population expansion from southern to northern Europe. The researchers take this observation to imply that genetically, Europeans are not distributed into discrete populations.|$|E
25|$|The same ice cores {{were also}} tested for Mercury {{deposition}} from natural and human-induced activities. This {{is the first}} known instance in which ice cores {{have been used to}} determine Mercury deposition from a mid-latitude glacier in North America, as all <b>previous</b> <b>studies</b> <b>have</b> been derived from other sources. The majority of Mercury deposition is by way of the atmosphere and sources of the element may be from volcanic activity or from industrialization, but volcanoes contribute a small proportion of the Mercury. The ice core samples from the Upper Fremont Glacier indicated that levels of Mercury increased dramatically during the industrial revolution and have decreased significantly since the mid-1980s. It is believed that the decrease in Mercury deposition since the 1980s coincides {{with the passage of the}} Clean Air Act.|$|E
25|$|It was {{hypothesized}} that interactions between neurotrophic factors could alter the optimal concentrations of each factor. While cell survival and phenotype maintenance are important, the emphasis of evaluation was on neurite extension. A combination of NGF, glial cell-line derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF), and ciliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF) was presented to Dorsal root ganglion cultures in vitro. One factor from each neurotrophic family was used. It was determined {{that there is not}} a difference in individual optimal concentration and combinatorial optimal concentration; however, around day 5 or 6 the neurites ceased extension and began to degrade. This {{was hypothesized}} to be due to lack of a critical nutrient or of proper gradients; <b>previous</b> <b>studies</b> <b>have</b> shown that growth factors are able to optimize neurite extension best when presented in gradients. Future studies on neurotrophic factor combinations will need to include gradients.|$|E

[...] However, {{it has also been}} suggested that core self-evaluations can be conceptualized as an [...] "aggregate construct," [...] which is composed of or predicted by its four dimensions. In other words, an individual's levels on each of these traits may predict their level of core self-evaluations as opposed to the other way around. This conceptualization difference has important implications for how CSE is measured and, thus, has important implications for the effects found when researching this construct. For this reason, additional research is necessary to examine this conceptualization discrepancy.|$|E

Meanwhile, observed snow depth across Utah has decreased and is accompanied by consistent decreases in snow cover and surface albedo. Weather systems with the potential to produce precipitation in Utah have decreased in number with those producing snowfall decreasing at a considerably greater rate.|$|E
