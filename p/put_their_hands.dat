500|$|At the 2011 MTV Video Music Awards, Beyoncé {{performed}} [...] "Love On Top" [...] {{after having}} {{said on the}} black carpet about an hour previous to going on stage {{that she would be}} making an announcement. Before beginning her live performance, she said to the audience: [...] "Tonight I want you to stand up on your feet, I want you to feel the love that's growing inside of me", giving a hint about the news that she had alluded to on the black carpet. She took the stage in [...] "a purple spangly tuxedo jacket, black pants and white tuxedo shirt, still rocking her fierce six-inch heels of old, pregnant or not", as stated by Gil Kaufman of MTV News. As she performed, her blond hair blowing in the wind, and backed by six dancers wearing similar shimmering tuxes, Beyoncé gave new meaning to the lyrics: [...] "Now everybody asks me why I'm smiling out from ear to ear." [...] She kept her dancing to a minimum for most of the song as she held onto the microphone stand while singing [...] "Love On Top". Eventually making her way to the extended lip in front of the stage and throwing down, she encouraged the audience to <b>put</b> <b>their</b> <b>hands</b> together. Beyoncé ended the performance by dropping the microphone, opening her jacket, rubbing her belly, and thus announcing her pregnancy to the world.|$|E
500|$|... "Bye Bye" [...] {{served as}} the album's thirteenth track, and also {{composed}} by Carey and Stargate. An [...] "inspirational power ballad", it is influenced by R and pop music genres. The song is built on an understated and simple piano-driven melody, that is decorated with a soft bass-line. Lyrically, the song was described by critics as a [...] "larger than life anthem", and an [...] "inspirational lighter-in-the-air ballad", and finds Carey remembering both her father, {{as well as any}} lost loved ones. While the verses are dedicated to him, the chorus was written in a third-person point of view, for her fans: [...] "This is for my peoples who just lost somebody / Your best friend, your baby, your man or your lady / Put your hand way up high / We will never say bye / Mamas, daddies, sisters, brothers, friends and cousins / This is for my peoples who lost their grandmothers / Lift your hands to the sky / Because we won't ever say bye bye". While listing several forms of loss, Carey encourages to never let go, and always live with their memory, and <b>put</b> <b>their</b> <b>hands</b> up if they ever lost someone, 'cause we won't ever say bye bye'. Serving as the album's closing number, [...] "I Wish You Well" [...] was compared to the closing number on Mimi, [...] "Fly Like a Bird". Similarly, [...] "I Wish You Well" [...] incorporates gospel influence into its melody of [...] "rousing piano waltz", that [...] "extends forgiveness to those who have wronged her in the past and is pretty much interchangeable with its predecessors." [...] Extensively making use of the whistle register, she references Mottola in another light than [...] "Side Effects": [...] "'I Wish You Well's' message to Mottola is similarly striking. Accompanied by a piano and some multi-tracked backing vocals, Carey sings: [...] "Still bruised, still walk on eggshells / Same frightened child, hide to protect myself / But you can't manipulate me like before." [...] She then prescribes Bible study and says, [...] "I wish you well." ...|$|E

2500|$|Mousquetaire gloves have buttons at {{the wrist}} so the wearer {{could open the}} buttons and slip her hand out without taking the whole glove off. The finger section would be folded in and kept away tidily. This is how ladies wore gloves while dining. After the meal they would <b>put</b> <b>their</b> <b>hands</b> back into the gloves, usually {{for the rest of}} the evening. During the 19th century, {{especially}} from the mid-Victorian era onwards, gloves were tailored so as to fit very tightly onto the hands and armsso tightly, in fact, that it was often necessary to use aids such as talcum powder and buttonhooks to put on one's gloves; therefore, it was considered somewhat uncouth to put on or remove one's gloves completely in public and women would make sure to don their gloves in the privacy of their homes before going out to some event (another reason for the popularity of the mousquetaire opening). The mousquetaire opening/fastening for women's long gloves seems to have become most popular during the Victorian era; during the Napoleonic/Regency period, women's long gloves were often tailored to fit loosely on the wearer's arm, and were often worn gathered below the elbow or held up on the biceps with a garter-like strap. (In the 2005 film version of Pride and Prejudice, Rosamund Pike and several other actresses wear opera-length gloves with drawstring ties at the top of the glove, but this might not be an accurate representation of the style of long gloves in the Regency era; fashion plates from the period do not appear to show gloves with drawstring-type ties, but do often show women wearing gloves held up by garterlike straps or ribbons.) ...|$|E

It came about when {{she was having a}} late night conversation with Naughty Boy, the song's producer with whom she worked throughout the whole album. She said that Naughty Boy had a beat running in the background, and then she got the first line of the song and the song began to write itself from there. She said; [...] "I love how songs like that develop: before we knew it, we were putting strings on with a synth, Naughty Boy suggested the Funky Drummer loop and it came together really organically." [...] The song was heavily compared to Massive Attack's [...] "Unfinished Sympathy", however Sandé said that she takes it as a compliment as she is a big fan of Massive Attack. However, she said lyrically or melodically the songs are not similar, but the Funky Drummer loop has been used so much and it has strings on people and that is why the connection is made between the two songs. She said she was glad if people get the same vibe from the song, as she loves the song and said the song was [...] "really exciting". Sandé said she also [...] "designed" [...] the song for a night club moment, where everyone can <b>put</b> <b>their</b> <b>hands</b> in the air. The song's genre featured a dubstep pop.
