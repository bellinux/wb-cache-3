25|$|Title vi, Of the Education of Catholic Youth, treats of (i) Catholic schools, {{especially}} parochial, viz., {{of their}} absolute necessity and {{the obligation of}} pastors to establish them. <b>Parents</b> <b>must</b> {{send their children to}} such schools unless the bishop should judge the reason for sending them elsewhere to be sufficient. Ways and means are also considered for making the parochial schools more efficient. It is desirable that these schools be free.

25|$|For a white Bengal tiger to be born, both <b>parents</b> <b>must</b> {{carry the}} unusual gene for white colouring, which only happens {{naturally}} about once in 10,000 births. Dark-striped white individuals are well-documented in the Bengal tiger subspecies (Panthera tigris tigris) {{as well as}} having been reported historically in several other subspecies. Currently, several hundred white tigers are in captivity worldwide, with about one hundred being found in India. Their unique white color fur has made them popular in entertainment showcasing exotic animals, and at zoos.|$|E
25|$|Both α- and β-thalassemias {{are often}} {{inherited}} in an autosomal recessive manner. Cases of dominantly inherited α- and β-thalassemias have been reported, {{the first of}} which was in an Irish family with two deletions of 4 and 11 bp in exon 3 interrupted by an insertion of 5 bp in the β-globin gene. For the autosomal recessive forms of the disease, both <b>parents</b> <b>must</b> be carriers for a child to be affected. If both parents carry a hemoglobinopathy trait, the risk is 25% for each pregnancy for an affected child.|$|E
25|$|In general, idic(15) occurs de novo but the <b>parents</b> <b>must</b> be karyotyped to {{make sure}} it is not inherited, mostly because this will affect the course of genetic {{counseling}} given to the family. If the abnormality is found prenatally and one of the parents harbour the marker, the child has a chance of not carrying the mutation. Further tests should however be done to prove the marker has not been rearranged while being inherited. This information is also necessary for counseling of future pregnancies. Each family is unique and should therefore be handled individually.|$|E

25|$|Middle-class {{families}} have certain class-specific problems that arise when family and work intersects. Many {{of them have}} to do with the balance <b>parents</b> <b>must</b> create between their career aspirations and their familial desires. Because the middle class has greater access to more stable occupations and the chances for occupational mobility, many middle class American families must deal with the ultimate decision between balancing their families with their jobs. Although the figures vary depending on parents' household income, the U.S. Department of Agriculture estimates families spend anywhere from $134,370 to $269,520 raising a child from birth through age 17.|$|E
25|$|Tuition Students {{who live}} in the Clearfield Area School District's {{attendance}} area may choose to attend one of Pennsylvania's 157 public charter schools. A student living in a neighboring public school district or a foreign exchange student may seek admission to Area School District. For these cases, the Pennsylvania Department of Education sets an annual tuition rate for each school district. It is the amount the public school district pays to a charter school for each resident student that attends the charter and it is the amount a nonresident student's <b>parents</b> <b>must</b> pay to attend the district's schools. The 2012 tuition rates are Elementary School - $8,087.30, High School - $8,610.90.|$|E
25|$|Like {{many other}} types of social category, in Judaism the mamzer status is {{hereditary}} - a child of a mamzer (whether mother or father) is also a mamzer. However, since these rules are regarded as applying only to Jews, and since traditional Rabbinical law regards being a Jew as something which is only maternally inheritable, {{the child of a}} male mamzer and a non-Jewish woman cannot be a mamzer. Notably, the child of a female mamzer and a non-Jewish man is an ordinary Jew, because both <b>parents</b> <b>must</b> be Jews in order for mamzer status to accrue to the child, but the child does inherit Jewish status from the mother.|$|E
