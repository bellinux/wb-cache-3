25|$|Lean {{manufacturing}} is {{an approach}} to production which arose in Toyota {{between the end of}} World War II and the seventies. It comes mainly from the ideas of Taiichi Ohno and Toyoda Sakichi which are centered on the complementary notions of just in time and autonomation (jidoka), all aimed at reducing waste (usually applied in PDCA style). Some additional elements are also fundamental: production smoothing (Heijunka), capacity buffers, setup reduction, cross-training and <b>plant</b> <b>layout.</b>|$|E
25|$|The plant {{design was}} {{essentially}} the same as Calder Hall comprising four 180 MW(th) graphite moderated, carbon dioxide cooled nuclear reactors fuelled by natural abundance uranium (0.71% 235U) enclosed in magnesium-alloy cans, the principal difference being in <b>plant</b> <b>layout.</b> Since Chapelcross was commissioned from the outset as a four-reactor site (the option for a further four reactors was not exercised) rather than separate two-reactor sites as at Calder ‘A’ and ‘B’ stations, the site layout was more compact. There is a single turbine hall housing all eight turbines which were originally rated at 23 MW(e) but progressively uprated to 30 MW(e) as the reactor thermal output was uprated to nominally 265 MW(th).|$|E

40|$|Optimising the {{container}} transfer schedule at the multimodal terminals {{is known to}} be NP-hard, which implies that the best solution becomes computationally infeasible as problem sizes increase. Genetic Algorithm (GA) techniques are used to reduce container handling/transfer times and ships' time at the port by speeding up handling operations. The GA is chosen due to the relatively good results that have been reported even with the simplest GA implementations to obtain near-optimal solutions in reasonable time. Also discussed, is the application of the model to assess the consequences of increased scheduled throughput time as well as different strategies such as the alternative <b>plant</b> <b>layouts,</b> storage policies and number of yard machines.

40|$|A new solid oxide {{electrolysis}} cell (SOEC) plant {{powered by}} solar energy for carbon dioxide reduction is established, {{in which the}} electrical/thermal energy production process, electrochemical reaction process, heat transfer processes, inlet gas compression process and products compression process are considered as the main energy consumption processes. The efficiency expressions for the plant are given under different operating conditions. Thermodynamic-electrochemical analysis shows that the joule heat generated from the irreversibilities in the SOEC may be larger than the thermal energy needed for the carbon dioxide reduction reaction. Some alternative <b>plant</b> <b>layouts</b> are designed to reasonably utilize the surplus waste heat in the SOEC, and accordingly, the expressions of the efficiency for the plant are modified. It is confirmed that the alternative <b>plant</b> <b>layouts</b> can effectively improve {{the performance of the}} plant. The effects of the support types of the SOEC, operating current density, operating temperature, operating pressure, effectiveness of heat exchangers and inlet flow rate of the carbon dioxide on the efficiency of the plant are revealed.

40|$|AbstractThe ongoing {{transformation}} of the German energy system calls for both new technologies and new methods to assess the role these technologies can play in future energy scenarios. This paper presents a new methodology that combines detailed thermodynamic process modelling and investor-centered economical evaluation to form an integrated technology assessment of {{compressed air energy storage}} plants. The respective model derives characteristics for charging and discharging operation of these plants from detailed component level process calculations. These characteristics are then processed in a unit commitment model that optimises plant operation in terms of market revenues using mixed integer linear programming. Arbitrary energy systems are represented by time series of spot and tertiary control reserve markets. In a case study, three different <b>plant</b> <b>layouts</b> are investigated using historical data and future price variations on the German energy market. It shows that simple conventional <b>plant</b> <b>layouts</b> would presently generate the highest profitability. Adiabatic storage systems tend to be an even better option if the price spread should increase in future markets. However, the profitability strongly relies on revenues from the control reserve market. The high volatility of this market explains why potential investors currently show restraint with respect to compressed air energy storage plants...|$|R
40|$|In {{the last}} decade, the European Union {{promoted}} several directives dealing with strategies and methodologies pertaining to buildings energy demand reduction. To accomplish fixed targets, a different design philosophy {{has to be}} adopted for new buildings construction. Additionally, RES (Renewable Energy Sources) have to be integrated {{as much as possible}} and non-invasive refurbishment interventions, matching architectural constraints for existing buildings have to be considered. This work explores the possibility to apply small scale hybrid energy systems generating electricity and high temperature heat which are compatible with typical limitations of historic buildings. To do so, six different <b>plant</b> <b>layouts</b> have been implemented, combining CHP (combined heat and power), PV (photovoltaics) arrays, PV/T (solar hybrid collectors), electric heat pumps, trans-critical CO 2 heat pumps and gas heat pumps. Moreover, the potential effects of hydrogen enrichment in Natural gas, on the selected <b>plant</b> <b>layouts</b> have been investigated. Thus, all of energy scenarios have been compared each other based on four different indicators such as PFEC, building EPg (Energy performance index), RES fraction and renewable heat. Finally, a sensitivity analysis with varying the building PTHR (Power To Heat Ratio) has been carried out in order to identify under what conditions each layout is the most efficient...|$|R
