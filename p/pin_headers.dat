50|$|Normally <b>pin</b> <b>headers</b> are {{pin through}} hole (PTH) devices, but surface-mount {{technology}} (SMT) versions {{of one and}} two row <b>pin</b> <b>headers</b> also exist. In the latter case the solder sides of the pins are simply bent on a 90 degree angle {{so as to be}} soldered to a solder plane. On single row <b>pin</b> <b>headers</b> the pins are bent alternating to one side or the other, on dual row <b>pin</b> <b>headers</b> the pins are simply bent outwards. If <b>pin</b> <b>headers</b> are optional, the PTH variant is often chosen for ease of manual assembly. <b>Pin</b> <b>headers</b> can be either straight or angled. The latter form is often used to connect two boards together.|$|E
50|$|<b>Pin</b> <b>headers</b> {{are often}} {{associated}} with ribbon cable connectors, <b>pin</b> <b>headers</b> often also function as recipients for jumpers. The most common jumper spacing is 2.54 mm, though 2.0 mm is sometimes used in smaller products.|$|E

50|$|Some systems {{polarize}} or key the <b>pin</b> <b>header</b> {{connection with}} something that fills and blocks one of {{the holes in the}} sockets.One pin of the wrong <b>pin</b> <b>header</b> (or the correct <b>pin</b> <b>header</b> rotated in the wrong orientation) hits that obstruction and prevents an incorrect connection. The correct <b>pin</b> <b>header</b> has one or more <b>pins</b> in the <b>header</b> removed or clipped to indicate a key for correct orientation.|$|R

50|$|For all of {{the above}} connectors, the {{computer}} manufacturer typically attaches a female IDC connector onto one end of a ribbon cable, and later slides that connector onto a matching male box <b>header</b> or <b>pin</b> <b>header</b> on the computer motherboard.|$|R

5000|$|<b>Pin</b> <b>header</b> {{connectors}} {{are thus}} [...] "male" [...] connectors ("female" [...] counterparts do exist, {{but these are}} normally just called female header (FH) or header connector, without [...] "pin") and are mostly used inside equipment, rather than {{being used as a}} connector {{on the outside of the}} device.|$|R

5000|$|A <b>pin</b> <b>header</b> (often {{abbreviated}} as PH, {{or simply}} header) {{is a form}} of electrical connector. It consists of one or more rows of male pins typically spaced 2.54 mm apart, but 5.08 mm, 5.00 mm, 3.96 mm, 2.00 mm, 1.27 mm or 1.00 mm are common as well. [...] The distance between pins is commonly referred as pitch in the electronic community.|$|R
50|$|<b>Pin</b> <b>headers</b> are {{cost-effective}} due {{to their}} simplicity. Headers are often sold as long strips (typically 40 or 50 pins for the dual row versions) which can easily be broken {{off to the right}} number of pins.|$|E

50|$|The STK600 allows {{in-system}} programming {{from the}} PC via USB, leaving the RS-232 port {{available for the}} target microcontroller. A 4 <b>pin</b> <b>header</b> on the STK600 labeled 'RS-232 spare' can connect any TTL level USART port on the chip to an onboard MAX232 chip to translate the signals to RS-232 levels. The RS-232 signals {{are connected to the}} RX, TX, CTS, and RTS pins on the DB-9 connector.|$|R
50|$|Arduino and Arduino-compatible boards use {{printed circuit}} {{expansion}} boards called shields, which plug into the normally supplied Arduino <b>pin</b> <b>headers.</b> Shields can provide motor controls for 3D printing and other applications, Global Positioning System (GPS), Ethernet, {{liquid crystal display}} (LCD), or breadboarding (prototyping). Several shields can also be made do it yourself (DIY).|$|E
50|$|It has onboard VGA video, VIA VT6106S 10/100 8P8C Ethernet, UDMA 33/66/100/133 44-pin PATA (1x), and SATA (1x) I/O. DVI and LVDS video-out, USB 2.0, COM, PS/2 Mouse & Keyboard, and HD 5.1 channel audio (supplied by a VIA VT1708A chip) are {{supported}} through {{the usage of}} I/O <b>pin</b> <b>headers</b> and add-on modules/daughter cards.|$|E
50|$|The {{motherboard}} is Dell P/N P270J {{and uses}} the Intel X58 chipset. It is a standard full ATX motherboard size and design and operates like any other ATX motherboard in regard to using a standard 24-pin and 8-pin power connectors. It has a standard PWM 4-pin CPU header and several 3-pin chassis <b>pin</b> <b>headers.</b>|$|E
50|$|Many {{personal}} computer motherboards still {{have at least}} one serial port, even if accessible only through a <b>pin</b> <b>header.</b> Small-form-factor systems and laptops may omit RS-232 connector ports to conserve space, but the electronics are still there. RS-232 has been standard for so long that the circuits needed to control a serial port became very cheap and often exist on a single chip, sometimes also with circuitry for a parallel port.|$|R
50|$|One {{edge of the}} {{expansion}} card holds the contacts (the edge connector or <b>pin</b> <b>header)</b> that fit into the slot. They establish the electrical contact between the electronics on the card and on the motherboard. Peripheral expansion cards generally have connectors for external cables. In the PC-compatible personal computer, these were located in the support bracket {{at the back of}} the cabinet. Industrial backplane systems had connectors mounted on the top edge of the card, opposite to the backplane pins.|$|R
50|$|Since {{executable}} code on the Xbox 360 is digitally signed, and runs underneath a hypervisor, an exploit or hack {{is necessary in}} order to execute homebrew code. On the Xbox 360, one such exploit exists, relying on and utilizing a modified DVD-ROM drive firmware, a modified burnt disc of the game King Kong (for Xbox 360), and the target console having either one of two vulnerable Kernel revisions. Optionally, a home-made serial cable may be used where attached to the appropriate <b>pin</b> <b>header</b> on the motherboard of the console.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Pin</b> <b>headers</b> with {{a plastic}} guide box around them are known as box headers (BH) or {{shrouded}} headers and are normally only used in combination with insulation-displacement connectors (IDC) for ribbon cables. A notch (key) in the guide box normally prevents placing the connector (polarised by a [...] "bump" [...] on one side) the wrong way around.|$|E
50|$|For multi-row <b>pin</b> <b>headers,</b> the {{pin number}} is more complex, because knowing the {{location}} of pin 1 doesn't automatically ensure how the remaining pins are numbered. Typically for headers attached to ribbon cables, the pins are numbered so they go linearly across the cable. Because {{of the way the}} connector attaches to the cable, this means in a two-row header, pins in one row have odd numbers and pins in the other row have even numbers.|$|E
50|$|EPIC (Embedded Platform for Industrial Computing) is {{a single}} board {{computer}} form factor which, like EBX, supports PC/104 peripheral boards but is smaller than EBX at 6.5 xx 4.5 in. It allows I/O connections to be implemented as either <b>pin</b> <b>headers</b> or PC-style ("real world") connectors. The standard provides specific I/O zones to implement functions such as Ethernet, serial ports, digital and analog I/O, video, wireless, and various application-specific interfaces. EPIC Express adds PCI Express expandability.|$|E
50|$|Novation also {{released}} a full-duplex Bell 212-compatible expansion {{known as the}} Novation 212 Expansion Card, which plugged into the Apple II motherboard {{as well as an}} existing APPLE-CAT II via a ribbon cable. The card was very expensive, and rarely seen. Novation also created an 'Expansion Pack' or external breakout box that would connect to the large <b>pin</b> <b>header</b> on the top middle of the card. This item allowed easy external access to the built in serial port, phone line and hand set connections. Due to its cost at the time, the item is very rare.|$|R
