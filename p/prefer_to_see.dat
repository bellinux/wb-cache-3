5|$|Editorials by AlterNet, The Montreal Gazette, The Wall Street Journal, The Guardian, and The New York Times {{have accused}} Wilders of {{hypocrisy}} given that, in their view, Wilders {{has called for}} the ban of {{the sale of the}} Quran while simultaneously arguing for his own personal freedom of speech. In a speech during a Dutch parliamentary debate, Wilders elaborated that he calls for the consistent application of Dutch laws restricting any act of expression that incites violence. Ideally, he would <b>prefer</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> nearly all such laws abolished. As such, he supports a European-wide constitutional protection of freedom of speech like that which exists in the United States.|$|E
5|$|In {{the middle}} of the 2012–13 posting season, MLB {{approached}} NPB seeking to change the way MLB teams bid for the right to negotiate with NPB players. Instead of using a silent auction in which teams bid blindly, MLB would prefer its teams to participate in a traditional, open auction where the bids are known and teams can knowingly outbid each other. Such a change would likely lower the price of the transfer fees paid to NPB teams. MLB and the players' unions agree that they'd <b>prefer</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> the players receive more money for the transfer rather than the teams. The Japan Times columnist Jason Coskrey also believed that these talks provided the JPBPA an opportunity to voice their concerns about the posting system and attempt to gain more leverage for themselves during the posting process. The new agreement, as noted, was announced on December 16, 2013, with most of the changes desired by MLB and players from both leagues.|$|E

Massachusetts residents would <b>prefer</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> solar power (91%), more energy conservation (90%), and wind power (89%) used first before resorting to more nuclear power. On the Cape and on the Islands, the views were very similar, with strong support for wind power (75%); conservation(81%); and solar(84%).|$|E

25|$|Blair {{has stated}} that he would <b>prefer</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> a single police force {{for the whole of}} London, an opinion shared by Ken Livingstone, with the {{functions}} of both the City of London Police and the British Transport Police absorbed by the Metropolitan Police. Already, the duties and functions of one police force (the Royal Parks Constabulary) have been taken by the Met. However, both the City of London Police and BTP have expressed their strong objections to this proposal, while the Home Office {{has stated that}} reorganisation of policing in London is not on their agenda. The publication of reviews into the operation of the British Transport Police, and the national review of fraud by the Attorney General, combined with the ending of the police merger proposals for England and Wales, appear to rule out any possibility of police mergers in London for the foreseeable future.|$|E
25|$|Parking lot attendants {{can include}} people who simply {{coordinate}} where to park {{and how much}} to pay or they may also include formal valets who will park a vehicle and keep track of the driver's keys while he or she is in the club. Some clubs require paid or valet parking to be used if keeping cars on the premises, to generate revenue and help regulate patron behavior. Bathroom attendants monitor the restrooms on behalf of management; primarily watching for policy violations and potential liability concerns. In strip clubs, policy enforcement can range from watching for drug use, sex, fighting, and other activities the club would <b>prefer</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> done off the premises. The attendant will also attempt to keep the restroom area clean, assist with the washing of hands, and if available, provide by request an assortment of cologne, mints, and other disposable items.|$|E

25|$|The bridge {{question}} has again been revived {{after many years}} of slumber, and business men in Quebec seem hopeful that something will come of it, though the placing of a subsidy on the statute book is but {{a small part of the}} work to be accomplished, as some of its enthusiastic promoters will, ere long, discover. Both Federal and Provincial Governments seem disposed to contribute towards the cost, and the City of Quebec will also be expected to do its share. Many of our people have objected to any contribution being given by the city unless the bridge is built opposite the town, and the CHRONICLE like every other good citizen of Quebec would <b>prefer</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> it constructed at Diamond Harbor, and has contended in the interests of the city for this site as long as there seemed to be any possibility of securing it there. It would still do so if it appeared that our people could have it at that site. A bridge at Diamond Harbor would, it estimated, cost at least eight millions. It would be very nice to have, with its double track, electric car track, and roads for vehicles and pedestrians, and would no doubt create a goodly traffic between the two towns, and be one of the show works of the continent.|$|E

500|$|In special {{elections}} in June, pro-Union candidates captured 9 of 10 seats in Kentucky's House delegation. Returning to the Senate {{for a special}} session in July, Breckinridge {{was regarded as a}} traitor by most of his fellow legislators because of his Confederate sympathies. He condemned as unconstitutional Lincoln's enlistment and arming of men for a war Congress had not officially declared, his expending funds for the war that had not been allocated by Congress, and his suspension of the writ of habeas corpus. He was the only senator to vote against a resolution authorizing Lincoln to use [...] "the entire resources of the government" [...] for the war. Asked what he would do if he were president, he replied, [...] "I would <b>prefer</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> these States all reunited upon true constitutional principles to any other object that could be offered me in life... But I infinitely <b>prefer</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> a peaceful separation of these States than to see endless, aimless, devastating war, {{at the end of which}} I see the grave of public liberty and of personal freedom." [...] On August 1, he declared that, if Kentucky sided with the federal government against the Confederacy, [...] "she will be represented by some other man on the floor of this Senate." ...|$|E

500|$|When the Senate convened for {{a special}} session on July 4, 1861, Breckinridge stood almost alone in {{opposition}} to the war. Labeled a traitor, he was removed from the Committee on Military Affairs. He demanded to know what authority Lincoln had to blockade Southern ports or suspend the writ of habeas corpus. He reminded his fellow senators that Congress had not approved a declaration of war and maintained that Lincoln's enlistment of men and expenditure of funds for the war effort were unconstitutional. If the Union could be persuaded not to attack the Confederacy, he predicted that [...] "all those sentiments of common interest and feeling... might lead to a political reunion founded upon consent". On August 1, he declared that if Kentucky supported Lincoln's prosecution of the war, [...] "she will be represented by some other man on the floor of this Senate." [...] Asked by Oregon's Edward Dickinson Baker how he would handle the secession crisis, he responded, [...] "I would <b>prefer</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> these States all reunited upon true constitutional principles to any other object that could be offered me in life... But I infinitely <b>prefer</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> a peaceful separation of these States, than to see endless, aimless, devastating war, {{at the end of which}} I see the grave of public liberty and of personal freedom." ...|$|E
500|$|Since 2005, Romney {{described}} himself as [...] "pro-life".

500|$|In {{two reports}} from 1993 and 1996, Ranariddh {{rejected}} {{the notion of}} becoming the next king. In November 1997, Ranariddh suggested that his outspoken and passionate personality made him an unsuitable candidate for the throne. However, by March 1999 Ranariddh had become became more receptive {{to the idea of}} succeeding his father. In early 2001, in an interview to Harish Mehta, Ranariddh discussed his conflicting desires between taking the throne and staying in politics. In November 2001, Ranariddh told the Cambodia Daily that he had decided to prioritize his political career over the throne. In the same interview, he added that Sihamoni had in the past supported him to become the next king. In September 2004, Ranariddh revealed that although he had been offered the throne by both Sihanouk and Monineath, who was Sihamoni's mother, [...] he would <b>prefer</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> Sihamoni take the throne.
