40|$|An {{extraction}} device is disclosed comprising a tube containing a substantially inert, chemically non-reactive <b>packing</b> <b>material</b> {{with a large}} surface area to volume ratio. A sample which consists of organic compounds dissolved in a liquid, is introduced into the tube. As the sample passes through the <b>packing</b> <b>material</b> it spreads over the material's large surface area to form a thin liquid film which is held on the <b>packing</b> <b>material</b> in a stationary state. A particular group or family of compounds is extractable from the sample by passing a particular solvent system consisting of a solvent and selected reagents through the <b>packing</b> <b>material.</b> The reagents cause optimum conditions to exist for the compounds of the particular family {{to pass through the}} phase boundary between the sample liquid and the solvent of the solvent system. Thus, the compounds of the particular family are separated from the sample liquid and become dissolved in the solvent of the solvent system. The particular family of compounds dissolved in the solvent, representing an extract, exits the tube together with the solvent through the tube's nozzle, {{while the rest of the}} sample remains on the <b>packing</b> <b>material</b> in a stationary state. Subsequently, a different solvent system may be passed through the <b>packing</b> <b>material</b> to extract another family of compounds from the remaining sample on the <b>packing</b> <b>material...</b>|$|R

25|$|An {{extensive}} {{fire was}} considered unlikely {{because of a}} lack of flammable materials throughout the complex, other than <b>packing</b> <b>materials</b> in the rear. There were open spaces between rooms in place of doors to allow for easy access by forklift trucks. The only barriers were curtains of plastic strips between some to hold in refrigerated air. This allowed for rapid spread of smoke and heat in the deadly blaze. The building's previous use as an ice cream production facility meant that the walls and floor were hard, smooth surfaces, which limited the amount of material that was available to absorb heat and smoke during the fire.|$|E
25|$|While {{the feature}} film {{made use of}} new sets and props, Dwyer reused {{previous}} Star Trek props or made new ones out of premade materials where possible rather than {{spend more money on}} entirely new items: a chair used to torture LaForge was created using a birthing chair, nosehair clippers and flashlights for accents; <b>packing</b> <b>materials</b> formed the shapes of set walls for the Bird of Prey bridge; and Soran's missile used a bird feeder and other garden store supplies for its interior elements. The Amargosa stellar observatory set was filled with reused props from The Next Generation, with others added in deliberate nods to past episodes. In addition to sets used on The Next Generation, other reused sets included the Klingon bridge built for , and ribbed plastic walls in the Jefferies tubes were repurposed from the sets of The Hunt for Red October. Other set pieces and props were original; these included paintings of Picard's ancestors and a cowboy for the locations in the Nexus.|$|E

Acetone, xylene and ammonia vapours were filtered through the biofilter's <b>packing</b> <b>material</b> during the investigations. The biofilter's structure is particular in that its <b>packing</b> <b>material</b> consists of polymer plates arranged vertically {{next to each other}} which produce a capillary effect of humidification. The plate-type structure of <b>packing</b> <b>material</b> with spaces (4 ± 0. 2 mm) between the plates reduces the device's aerodynamic resistance.

2500|$|Chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) are {{anthropogenic}} {{compounds that}} have been released into the atmosphere since the 1930s in various applications such as in air-conditioning, refrigeration, blowing agents in foams, insulations and <b>packing</b> <b>materials,</b> propellants in aerosol cans, and as solvents. [...] The entry of CFCs into the ocean makes them extremely useful as transient tracers to estimate rates and pathways of ocean circulation and mixing processes. However, due to production restrictions of CFCs in the 1980s, atmospheric concentrations of CFC-11 and CFC-12 has stopped increasing, and the CFC-11 to CFC-12 ratio in the atmosphere have been steadily decreasing, making water dating of water masses more problematic. Incidentally, production and release of sulfur hexafluoride (SF6) have rapidly increased in the atmosphere since the 1970s. Similar to CFCs, SF6 is also an inert gas and is not affected by oceanic chemical or biological activities., CFC-11, CFC-12 and CFC-113 | journal = Journal of Oceanography | volume = 59 | issue = 5 | pages = 719–729 | year = 2003 | doi = 10.1023/B:JOCE.0000009600.12070.1a | url = https://www.researchgate.net/publication/248068919_Comparison_of_Time-Dependent_Tracer_Ages_in_the_Western_North_Pacific_Oceanic_Background_Levels_of_%28SF_6__CFC11_CFC12_and_CFC113 }} Thus, using CFCs in concert with SF6 as a tracer resolves the water dating issues due to decreased CFC concentrations.|$|E
