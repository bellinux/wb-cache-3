25|$|Patent {{infringement}} typically {{is caused}} by using or selling a <b>patented</b> <b>invention</b> without permission from the patent holder. The scope of the <b>patented</b> <b>invention</b> or the extent of protection is defined in {{the claims of the}} granted patent. There is safe harbor in many jurisdictions to use a <b>patented</b> <b>invention</b> for research. This safe harbor does not exist in the US unless the research is done for purely philosophical purposes, or in order to gather data in order to prepare an application for regulatory approval of a drug. In general, patent infringement cases are handled under civil law (e.g., in the United States) but several jurisdictions incorporate infringement in criminal law also (for example, Argentina, China, France, Japan, Russia, South Korea).|$|E

25|$|Patent {{infringement}} {{occurs when}} a third party, without authorization from the patentee, makes, uses, or sells a <b>patented</b> <b>invention.</b> Patents, however, are enforced on a nation by nation basis. The making of an item in China, for example, that would infringe a U.S. patent, would not constitute infringement under US patent law unless the item were imported into the US.|$|E
25|$|The {{procedure}} for granting patents, requirements {{placed on the}} patentee, {{and the extent of}} the exclusive rights vary widely between countries according to national laws and international agreements. Typically, however, a granted patent application must include one or more claims that define the invention. A patent may include many claims, each of which defines a specific property right. These claims must meet relevant patentability requirements, such as novelty, usefulness, and non-obviousness. The exclusive right granted to a patentee in most countries is the right to prevent others, or at least to try to prevent others, from commercially making, using, selling, importing, or distributing a <b>patented</b> <b>invention</b> without permission.|$|E

25|$|Quanta Computer, Inc. v. LG Electronics, Inc., , is a {{decision}} of the United States Supreme Court in which the Court reaffirmed {{the validity of the}} patent exhaustion doctrine, and in doing so made uncertain the continuing precedential value of a line of decisions in the Federal Circuit that had sought to limit Supreme Court exhaustion doctrine decisions to their facts and to require a so-called “rule of reason” analysis of all post-sale restrictions other than tie-ins and price fixes. In the course of restating the patent exhaustion doctrine, the Court held that the exhaustion doctrine is triggered by, among other things, an authorized sale of a component when the only reasonable and intended use of the component is to practice the patent and the component substantially embodies the <b>patented</b> <b>invention</b> by embodying its essential features. The Court also overturned, in passing, the part of decision below that held that the exhaustion doctrine was limited to product claims and did not apply to method claims.|$|E

2500|$|The {{design of}} the Stipa-Caproni was {{very similar to that}} of modern jet engines; in fact, after having {{patented}} his design in Italy, Germany, and the United States in 1938, Stipa became convinced that German rocket and jet technology (especially the V-1 flying bomb) was using his <b>patented</b> <b>invention</b> without giving proper credit. Stipas basic idea—which he called the [...] "intubed propeller"—was to mount the engine and propeller inside a fuselage that itself formed a tapered duct, or venturi tube, and compressed the propeller's airflow and the engine exhaust before it exited the duct at the trailing edge of the aircraft, essentially applying Bernoulli's principle of fluid movements to make the aircraft's engine more efficient.|$|E
2500|$|Snowmaking is the {{artificial}} production of snow by forcing water and pressurized air through a [...] "snow gun" [...] or [...] "snow cannon", on ski slopes. Snowmaking is mainly used at ski resorts to supplement natural snow. This allows ski resorts {{to improve the}} reliability of their snow cover and to extend their ski seasons. The costly production of snowmaking requires low temperatures. The threshold temperature for snowmaking decreases as humidity decreases. Machine-made snow was first co-invented by three engineers—Art Hunt, Dave Richey and Wayne Pierce of Milford, Connecticut on March 14, 1950. Their <b>patented</b> <b>invention</b> of the first [...] "snow cannon" [...] used a garden hose, a 10-horsepower compressor, and a spray-gun nozzle, which produced about 20inches of snow.|$|E

2500|$|Another {{effect of}} modern patent usage is to both enable and incentivize {{competitors}} to design around (or to [...] "invent around" [...] according to R S Praveen Raj) the <b>patented</b> <b>invention.</b> This may promote healthy competition among manufacturers, resulting in gradual improvements {{of the technology}} base. This may help augment national economies and confer better living standards to the citizens. The 1970 Indian Patent Act allowed the Indian pharmaceutical industry to develop local technological capabilities in this industry. This act coincided with the transformation of India from a bulk importer of pharmaceutical drugs to a leading exporter. The rapid evolution of Indian pharmaceutical industry since the mid-1970s highlights {{the fact that the}} design of the patent act was instrumental in building local capabilities even in a developing country like India.|$|E
2500|$|While [...] "reverse DI" [...] {{re-recording}} {{techniques have}} been used for decades, the process was popularized in part by the introduction of the Reamp device in 1993. The registered trademark [...] "Reamp" [...] describes a <b>patented</b> <b>invention</b> (...) filed in 1994 by audio engineer John Cuniberti, perhaps best known for his lifelong engineering work with guitarist Joe Satriani. The Reamp inductively couples balanced line-level sources into unbalanced guitar-level destinations (e.g., DAW output to guitar amp input) and includes a potentiometer which alters both signal level and source impedance. Derivations of the Reamp trademark, such as [...] "reamping" [...] and [...] "re-amplification," [...] have become common terminology in professional audio to describe the process of amplified re-recording – much like the word [...] "Band-aid" [...] is often used to describe adhesive bandages (see Genericized trademark).|$|E
2500|$|A patent {{does not}} give a right to make or use or sell an invention. Rather, a patent provides, from a legal standpoint, the right to exclude others from making, using, selling, {{offering}} for sale, or importing the <b>patented</b> <b>invention</b> for the term of the patent, which is usually 20 years from the filing date subject to the payment of maintenance fees. From an economic and practical standpoint however, a patent is better and perhaps more precisely regarded as conferring upon its proprietor [...] "a right to try to exclude by asserting the patent in court", for many granted patents {{turn out to be}} invalid once their proprietors attempt to assert them in court. A patent is a limited property right the government gives inventors in exchange for their agreement to share details of their inventions with the public. Like any other property right, it may be sold, licensed, mortgaged, assigned or transferred, given away, or simply abandoned.|$|E

"In cases now arising trial {{courts should}} {{bear in mind}} that in many {{instances}} the nature of the patent being enforced and the economic function of the patent holder present considerations quite unlike earlier cases. An industry has developed in which firms use patents not as a basis for producing and selling goods but, instead, primarily for obtaining licensing fees. ... For these firms, an injunction, and the potentially serious sanctions arising from its violation, can be employed as a bargaining tool to charge exorbitant fees to companies that seek to buy licenses to practice the patent. ... When the <b>patented</b> <b>invention</b> is but a small component of the product the companies seek to produce and the threat of an injunction is employed simply for undue leverage in negotiations, legal damages may well be sufficient to compensate for the infringement and an injunction may not serve the public interest. In addition injunctive relief may have different consequences for the burgeoning number of patents over business methods, which were not of much economic and legal significance in earlier times. The potential vagueness and suspect validity of some of these patents may affect the calculus under the four-factor test." ...|$|E
