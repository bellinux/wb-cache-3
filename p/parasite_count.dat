40|$|Background Malaria-induced {{proteinuria}} {{has been}} observed in severe cases of malaria. Few {{studies have been done}} to assess for an association between proteinuria and malaria <b>parasite</b> <b>counts</b> before the disease becomes severe. Objective To investigate a possible association between proteinuria and malaria <b>parasite</b> <b>counts</b> in children. Methods A cross-sectional study was conducted on school-aged children in Panyabungan, Mandailing Natal, between September to November 2010. Malaria was diagnosed by microscopic examination of peripheral blood smears. Children with malaria underwent proteinuria t ests by urine dipstick method. An association between proteinuria and malaria <b>parasite</b> <b>counts</b> was analyzed using linear regression test. Results Of 181 participants with Plasmodium fak:iparum malaria, 53. 6 % were female and had a mean age of 7. 8 years.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{investigate}} retinal lesions {{in children}} with severe falciparum malaria. METHODS: Color photography and fluorescein angiography were performed in consecutive children admitted to a pediatric high-dependency unit in Kenya during 1 malaria season. The presence and category of retinal lesion was compared with disease severity, clinical outcome, anemia, lactic acidosis, and <b>parasite</b> <b>count.</b> RESULTS: Twenty-six patients with cerebral malaria and 14 patients who were prostrate were studied. Thirty-one of the patients had clinical features of ocular disease, including round, flame-shaped, and white-centered hemorrhages; peripheral and foveal retinal opacification; peripheral vascular occlusion; venous dilation; disc edema with hyperemia; and arterial pulsatility. Of 8 patients with retinal opacification, only 2 showed small, infrequent zones of capillary nonperfusion on fluorescein angiography; the leakage of dye at sites of opacification was not seen. Retinal opacification {{was significantly associated with}} a higher <b>parasite</b> <b>count</b> (P <. 02). White-centered hemorrhages were significantly associated with a higher <b>parasite</b> <b>count</b> (P <. 05), severe disease (p <. 05), and severe anemia (P <. 02). CONCLUSIONS: The blood-retina barrier and retinal vascular flow remain substantially normal despite widespread pathological features. Retinal features {{in children with}} severe malaria are consistent with cellular hypoxia, nutritional deficiency, or both rather than with vascular occlusion; they support the concept of metabolic steal by parasites...|$|E

HbAA and HbAS patients were compared for levels of plasma soluble IL- 2 receptors (IL- 2 R) and the in vitro cellular reactivity to affinity-purified soluble P. falciparum antigens (SPAg), PPD and phytohaemagglutinin (PHA). At diagnosis, HbAS patients with clinical disease had lower plasma-soluble IL- 2 R levels and <b>parasite</b> <b>counts</b> than the corresponding HbAA patients, whereas HbAS and HbAA patients with asymptomatic infections had comparable soluble IL- 2 R levels and <b>parasite</b> <b>counts.</b> PBMC from HbAS patients had higher proliferation and IFN-gamma production in response to SPAg than PBMC from HbAA patients. The difference in the lymphoproliferative responses to SPAg between the two groups was evident in patients with asymptomatic infections. In all patients, the clinical severity, the soluble IL- 2 R levels and the <b>parasite</b> <b>counts</b> were directly related. The former two were inversely related to the proliferative responses to SPAg. After treatment, all the studied parameters were comparable in the two groups.

A total of 60 adult males were included in the study, of which 30 had the slide-confirmed infection by P. falciparum. Serial blood samples were collected at admission and on days 3, 14 and 43. Triglycerides, total cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein (HDL-c), and low-density lipoprotein (LDL-c) were measured by colorimetric methods. At admission, the levels of total cholesterol, LDL and HDL were significantly lower in malaria cases compared to healthy controls, but the levels of triglycerides were significantly higher in these patients.

40|$|Alpine ibex is {{characterized}} by strong sexual differences, both morphological and in population dynamics. Host sex {{has been shown to}} strongly affect parasite load with males usually more infected than females. Moreover ibex exhibit a peculiar pattern of survival with subadult males having a slow growing rate coupled with high survival which rapidly decline in old individual. This peculiar life history has been suggested to have been developed as adaptation to an harsh environment. In this way by investing fewer resources in growing the ibex can direct more energy in survival. At the same time the investment in immunodefence can change over the age. To verify the hypothesis that sex and age affect parasite infection, we analysed the abomasal parasite community of swiss ibexes shot during the 2007 hunting season. We analysed the parasite community of 31 abomasa coming from 17 males, 12 females, ranging from 1 to 16 years old. The ibex analysed harboured a mean of 1472 helminth/individual. Seven parasites species have been identified with Teladorsagia circumcincta and Marshallagia marshalli covering the 90 % of total <b>parasite</b> <b>count.</b> The mean abundance of total <b>parasite</b> <b>count</b> and of M. marshalli was different between sexes, with more parasites found in males.

40|$|Variant alleles in the {{mannose-binding lectin}} (MBL) gene (mbl 2) causing {{low levels of}} {{functional}} MBL are associated with susceptibility to different infections and are common in areas where malaria is endemic. Therefore, we investigated whether MBL variant alleles in 551 children from Ghana {{were associated with the}} occurrence and outcome parameters of Plasmodium falciparum malaria and asked whether MBL may function as an opsonin for P. falciparum. No difference in MBL genotype frequency was observed between infected and noninfected children or between children with cerebral malaria and/or severe malarial anemia and children with uncomplicated malaria. However, patients with complicated malaria who were homozygous for MBL variant alleles had significantly higher <b>parasite</b> <b>counts</b> and lower blood glucose levels than their MBL-competent counterparts. Distinct calcium-dependent binding of MBL to the membrane of P. falciparum-infected erythrocytes, which could be inhibited by mannose, was observed. Further characterization revealed that MBL reacted with a P. falciparum glycoprotein identical to the 78 -kDa glucose-regulated stress protein of P. falciparum. MBL seems to be a disease modifier in clinical malaria and to function as an opsonin for erythrocytes invaded by P. falciparum and may thus be involved in sequestration of the parasite, which in turn may explain the association between homozygosity for MBL variant alleles and high <b>parasite</b> <b>counts...</b>|$|R

Individuals with a moderate <b>parasite</b> <b>count</b> (less than 50, 000 /ml) were seen more commonly amoung AS and AC individuals as compared to AA controls. It is postulated that heterozygotes have a better immunological defense against the deleterious effects of P. falciparum infection because persistent parasitemia stimulates antibody production...|$|E
40|$|Ivermectin {{given in}} a single {{subcutaneous}} dose of 300 μg/kg was tested for safety and efficacy against swine hyperkeratotic scabies in a large breeding piggery. Approximately 15 % {{of the adult population}} was showing severe clinical mange. Skin scrapings were taken from 40 affected animals to provide <b>parasite</b> <b>counts.</b> Eight of 40 animals were used as untreated controls; all test animals were injected subcutaneously on day 0 with Ivermectin. General improvement was noted as early as eight days after treatment. Scratching stopped by day 21 in all treated animals. The results are discussed in regard to a control program for Sarcoptes scabiei infestation in pigs...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. A {{retrospective}} analysis {{was made of}} clinical and parasitologic parameters in patients with induced Plas-modium ovale infection to document the initial clinical and parasitologic response and their subsequent development of clinical and parasitologic immunity, and {{to determine the effect}} of previous homologous and heterologous malaria on subsequent infection with this parasite. The prepatent periods were relatively uniform. Eight patients injected with sporozoites that had been stored frozen had a median prepatent period of 14 days (range 14 – 20 days). Thirty-five patients infected via the bites of infected mosquitoes had a median prepatent period of 15 days (range 12 – 18 days). In eight patients previously infected with P. vivax, the median prepatent period was 16 days. High-intensity fever (104 °F) was frequently seen, with instances of fever 106 °F recorded on many occasions. Fever> 101 °F and> 104 °F occurred for much shorter periods of time than had been observed in patients infected with P. falciparum. Parasite counts> 10, 000 /L were infrequent; in most patients, such <b>parasite</b> <b>counts</b> rarely lasted {{more than two or three}} days. Gametocytemia was generally of low density and lasted only a few days. The overall length of the clinical and parasi-tologic period was much shorter compared with that seen in patients infected with P. falciparum. Previous infection with P. ovale did not prevent reinfection, but resulted in reduced levels of parasitemia and fever. Previous infection with heterologous species of Plasmodium did not prevent infection; some reduction in the frequency and intensity of fever and <b>parasite</b> <b>counts</b> was evident. Previous infection with homologous or heterologous parasites failed to eliminate th...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. An open {{randomized}} controlled study of mefloquine-artesunate and mefloquine-primaquine for the treat-ment of uncomplicated Plasmodium falciparum malaria {{was carried out}} in Kanchanaburi in the Saiyok District in western Thailand. Weekly <b>parasite</b> <b>counts</b> from thick and thin blood films were done for six weeks. The gametocyte carriage rate was calculated and compared between the two treatment groups. Gametocytes on presentation, recrudes-cent infection, and reinfection were the significant factors associated with subsequent development of gametocytemia. It is the increased propensity of recrudescent infections to produce gametocytes that drives drug resistance. The results of this study confirmed that the complete eradication of asexual forms of P. falciparum by effective antimalarial treatment, but not by combination treatment with primaquine, is the most effective means to prevent subsequent gametocytemia...|$|R
