5000|$|The code {{position}} {{assigned to}} Null {{was in fact}} used only for the idle state of teleprinters. During long periods of idle time, the impulse rate was not synchronized between both devices (which could even be powered off or not permanently interconnected on commuted phone lines). To start a message it was first necessary to calibrate the impulse rate a sequence of regularly timed [...] "mark" [...] pulses (1) by group of five pulses, which could also be detected by simple passive electronic devices {{to turn on the}} teleprinter; this series of pulse was generating series of Erasure/Delete and also initializing the receiver state to the Letters shift mode, however the first pulse could be lost, so this <b>power</b> <b>on</b> <b>procedure</b> could then be terminated by a single Null immediately followed by an Erasure/Delete character. To preserve the synchronization between devices, the Null code could not be used arbitrarily in the middle of messages (this was an improvement to the initial Baudot system where spaces were not explicitly differentiated, so it was difficult to maintain the pulse counters for repeating spaces on teleprinters). But it was then possible to resynchronize devices at any time by sending a Null {{in the middle of a}} message (immediately followed by an Erasure/Delete/LS control if followed by a letter, or by a FS control if followed by a figure). Sending Null controls also did not cause the paper band to advance to the next row (as nothing was punched), so this saved precious lengths of punchable paper band. On the opposite the Erasure/Delete/LS control code was always punched and always shifted to the (initial) letters mode. According to some sources, the Null code point was reserved for country-internal usage only.|$|E

40|$|The aims of this {{research}} were to study and optimize the effects of different electromagnetism wave (microwave) <b>powers</b> <b>on</b> drying <b>procedure</b> of Bakhtiari savory. The essential oils from shade and microwaves dried samples were isolated by hydrodistillation in a Clevenger apparatus and analysed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). The results showed that with increasing the microwave power, drying time and essential oil yield decreased. The highest values of thymol and carvacrol and sum of them that show the quality of essential oil was obtained with 800 W microwave power. The results of optimization using Response Surface Methodology revealed that the optimum point was 561. 3 W microwave power. At this point, the analytical software obtained the p-cymene, γ-terpinene, thymol, carvacrol, yield and drying time values were 5. 61 %, 12. 61 %, 12. 87 %, 43. 28 %, 1. 79 % and 445. 37 s, respectively. Hence, if we consider the quality of essential oil together with shorter time of drying, the microwave power of 800 W is recommended and if essential oil yield {{is more important than}} its quality, shade-dried is recommended...|$|R

Speaking {{plays a significant role}} in mastering English is speaking. As a skill, speaking is the most used skill by people rather than the three other skills. In learning speaking skill, the students often find some problems. The problem frequently found is that they are difficult to use the foreign language. The other reason is because they are too shy also afraid to take a part. The students’ interest, the English material, including the technique in teaching and learning English are the factors that can become causes the problem of the students’ speaking skill. So that, in this reasearch, the writer use schema activation strategy as the method to teaching and learning the speaking skill. The aim of this reasearch are to know the students’ response toward the application of schema activation strategy <b>on</b> <b>procedure</b> text, to know the students’ ability before and after the application of schema activation strategy <b>on</b> <b>procedure</b> text, and to know the influence of schema activation strategy in speaking to the students’ speaking ability <b>on</b> <b>procedure</b> text. The method of this research is quantitative approach. The technique for collecting data in this research are observation, interview, test, and questionnaire. Then, the writer use the statistical analysis that is ttest.
