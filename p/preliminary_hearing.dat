5|$|Much of what {{is known}} of the event is based on a month-long <b>preliminary</b> <b>hearing</b> held afterward, {{generally}} known as the Spicer hearings. Reporters from both newspapers covered the hearings and recorded the testimony there and at the coroner's inquest, but only the reporter from The Daily Nugget knew shorthand. The testimony recorded by the court recorder and the two newspapers varied greatly.|$|E
5|$|On October 30, as {{permitted}} by territorial law, Ike Clanton filed murder {{charges against the}} Earps and Holliday. Justice Wells Spicer convened a <b>preliminary</b> <b>hearing</b> on October 31 to determine if enough evidence existed to go to trial. In an unusual proceeding, he took written and oral testimony {{from a number of}} witnesses over more than a month.|$|E
5|$|Brocius waived the <b>preliminary</b> <b>hearing</b> {{so he and}} {{his case}} could be {{immediately}} transferred to Tucson. Wyatt and a deputy took Brocius in a wagon {{the next day to}} Tucson to stand trial, possibly saving him from being lynched. Wyatt testified that he thought the shooting was accidental. It was also demonstrated that Brocius' pistol could be fired from half-cock. Fred White left a statement before he died two days later that the shooting was not intentional. Based on the evidence presented, Brocius was not charged with White's death.|$|E

5|$|Frank Stilwell {{had just}} arrived in Bisbee with his livery stable partner, Pete Spence, when the two were arrested by Deputy U.S. Marshal Virgil Earp for the holdup. Both were friends of Ike Clanton and the McLaurys. At the <b>preliminary</b> <b>hearing,</b> Stilwell and Spence were able to provide several {{witnesses}} who supported their alibis. Judge Spicer dropped the charges for insufficient evidence {{just as he had}} done for Doc Holliday earlier in the year.|$|E
5|$|Kinne {{was arrested}} at her home for the murder around 11 p.m. on May 31, the same night as Patricia Jones's funeral. The same day, the Jackson County Sheriff {{requested}} that prosecutors consider a second charge of murder, this one {{for the death of}} James Kinne. Kinne's lawyers, Alex Peebles and Martha Sperry Hickman, filed a writ of habeas corpus with the court the next morning, and a hearing that afternoon resulted in her release on $20,000 bond while she awaited a <b>preliminary</b> <b>hearing</b> originally scheduled for June 16.|$|E
5|$|On June 19, 1969, Hendrix flew to Toronto for a <b>preliminary</b> <b>hearing.</b> He wore a {{business}} suit {{for the first time}} since before the formation of the Experience in late 1966. Judge Robert Taylor presided over the hearing, setting a date for December 8, at which Hendrix would stand trial for two counts of possession of heroin and hashish, for which he faced as many as 20 years in prison. More serious potential charges of drug transporting and trafficking, which had been discussed at the time of the arrest, were not filed.|$|E

5|$|The {{following}} day, the Latter Day Saints {{surrendered to}} 2,500 state troops {{and agreed to}} forfeit their property and leave the state. Smith was immediately brought before a military court, accused of treason, and sentenced to be executed the next morning; Alexander Doniphan, who was Smith's former attorney and a brigadier general in the Missouri militia, refused {{to carry out the}} order. Smith was then sent to a state court for a <b>preliminary</b> <b>hearing,</b> where several of his former allies testified against him.|$|E
5|$|Wyatt altered {{his story}} later on, telling John H. Flood {{that he did}} not see Brocius's pistol {{on the ground in the}} dark until afterward. The pistol {{contained}} one expended cartridge and five live rounds. Brocius waived a <b>preliminary</b> <b>hearing</b> so he and his case could be transferred to Tucson District Court. Virgil and Wyatt escorted Brocius to Tucson to stand trial, possibly saving him from a lynching. White, age 31, died of his wound two days after his shooting.|$|E
5|$|After a brief <b>preliminary</b> <b>hearing</b> {{starting}} on 8 October 1966, during which Lamb reportedly {{showed no signs}} of emotion, the young man's trial for capital murder began on 16 January 1967 at Essex County Courthouse in Windsor. Because of the charge's severity, the case was heard by a judge and jury under the auspices of Ontario's Supreme Court, which chose Justice Alexander Stark to preside. The trial started with Lamb pleading not guilty to the capital murder of Edith Chaykoski and Andrew Woloch; Nosanchuk then opened his mental disorder defence under Section 562 of the Canadian Criminal Code. Stark gave an order allowing all relevant psychiatric doctors to remain, then allowed the Crown to open its case against Lamb.|$|E
50|$|Based on {{the holding}} of Morrissey v. Brewer a year earlier, which {{extended}} Fourteenth Amendment due process protection to the parole revocation process, the Supreme Court held, in an 8-1 decision, that a probationer's sentence can only be revoked after a <b>preliminary</b> revocation <b>hearing</b> and a final revocation hearing. These hearings are {{now known as the}} Gagnon I and Gagnon II hearings, respectively.|$|R
50|$|In October 1838, Smith, Brigham Young, Heber C. Kimball {{and other}} Latter Day Saint leaders {{gathered}} to dedicate the temple square {{on the highest}} point on the bluff. Smith, Wight and others surrendered on November 1, 1838, on charges of murder, arson, theft, rebellion, and treason. After a <b>preliminary</b> court <b>hearing</b> was held November 12 to 29 in Richmond, Smith and Wight were transferred to the jail in Liberty.|$|R
25|$|In February 2007, International Media Films, Inc., {{which owns}} the rights to Fellini's La Dolce Vita, filed suit against Lucas (as Andrei Treivas Bregman), Lucas Entertainment, Inc., and Lucas Distribution, Inc. for {{trademark}} and copyright infringement. The lawsuit seeks to collect unspecified damages and to stop sales of Michael Lucas' La Dolce Vita Parts 1 & 2. At the <b>preliminary</b> injunction <b>hearing</b> in April, 2007, {{the attorney for the}} plaintiff asked the judge to enjoin further distribution of Lucas' film, which he refused to do.|$|R
5|$|During the <b>preliminary</b> <b>hearing</b> in late July, {{prosecutors}} presented testimonies from Jew's neighbors {{at both of}} his homes, {{indicating that}} Jew had never lived in his 28th Avenue house {{and spent most of}} his time in Burlingame. Testimony from a U.S. Postal Service inspector revealed that Jew's first-class mail went to Burlingame while junk mail went to his San Francisco address; prosecutors cited utility bills showing low usage of water and electricity at his 28th Avenue home, as well as loan applications that indicated he lived in Burlingame. In his defense, Jew produced a jury duty summons to indicate his address in San Francisco, and questioned the possible bias of the witnesses against him.|$|E
5|$|Earp improbably testified {{during the}} <b>preliminary</b> <b>hearing</b> after the gunfight at the O.K. Corral {{that he and}} Behan had made a deal. If Earp withdrew his {{application}} to the legislature, Behan agreed to appoint Earp as undersheriff. Behan received the appointment in February 1881, but did not keep {{his end of the}} bargain, and instead chose Harry Woods, a prominent Democrat, as undersheriff. Behan testified at first that he had not made any deal with Earp, although he later admitted he had lied. Behan said he broke his promise to appoint Earp because of an incident that occurred shortly before his appointment.|$|E
5|$|Four {{days after}} the shootout, Ike Clanton filed murder charges against Doc Holliday and the Earps. Wyatt and Holliday were arrested and brought before Justice of the Peace, Wells Spicer. Morgan and Virgil were still {{recovering}} at home. Only Wyatt and Holliday were required to post $10,000 bail, which was paid by their attorney Thomas Fitch, local mine owner E.B. Gage, Wells Fargo undercover agent Fred Dodge, and other business owners appreciative of the Earps' efforts to maintain order. Virgil Earp was suspended as town marshal pending {{the outcome of the}} trial. Justice Spicer convened a <b>preliminary</b> <b>hearing</b> on October 31 to determine if there was enough evidence to go to trial.|$|E

50|$|Judicial magistrates {{primarily}} {{serve their}} home county and have jurisdiction over simple misdemeanors, local infractions, and small claims.

They serve four-year terms and are appointed by county commissions.|$|R
50|$|On November 16, 1998, Jose Luis Ortiz Vega, Barbarita's {{stepfather}} and Eugenio J. Rodriguez Galindo {{were arrested}} and charged with the kidnapping and murder of Cepeda Casado. During a <b>preliminary</b> court <b>hearing</b> on December 16 of that year, it was determined there was probable cause to accuse the two of first degree murder and of kidnapping, in addition to gun law violations. A third man, named Eliezer Santana Baez, testified he had witnessed some of what the other two men had been accused of doing. Santana Baez, however, had also declared that he was not there when Cepeda Casado died and that he had been coerced to lie by authorities.|$|R
5|$|The <b>preliminary</b> <b>hearing</b> {{began on}} March 13, 1951, and lasted three days, {{during which the}} Crown called 20witnesses. Diefenbaker alleged that {{the rules of the}} CNR did not require that the {{telegraph}} operator listen to the repeat of his message, but merely recommended that he should. Nevertheless, Diefenbaker's motion to dismiss was unsuccessful and Atherton was committed for trial before the Supreme Court of British Columbia (a trial-level court). Manslaughter was a charge for which the accused did not have the option of a speedy trial before a county court judge, and Atherton's case was set for the Spring Assizes in Prince George.|$|E
5|$|At a <b>preliminary</b> <b>hearing</b> on June 19, Judge Robert Taylor set a {{date for}} December 8, at which Hendrix would stand trial for two counts of illegal {{possession}} of narcotics, for which he faced as many as 20 years in prison. While {{there was no question}} as to whether the drugs were in Hendrix's luggage, in order for the Crown to prove possession they had to show that he knew they were there. In his cross-examination of Canadian customs officials, defense attorney John O'Driscoll raised doubts about whether the narcotics belonged to Hendrix, who had no drug paraphernalia in his luggage or needle tracks on his arms. After a trial that lasted for three days, the jury deliberated for 8 hours before returning a not guilty verdict, acquitting Hendrix of both charges.|$|E
5|$|Judicial oratory {{had become}} a {{significant}} literary genre by {{the second half of}} the fifth century, as represented in the speeches of Demosthenes' predecessors, Antiphon and Andocides. Logographers were a unique aspect of the Athenian justice system: evidence for a case was compiled by a magistrate in a <b>preliminary</b> <b>hearing</b> and litigants could present it as they pleased within set speeches; however, witnesses and documents were popularly mistrusted (since they could be secured by force or bribery), there was little cross-examination during the trial, there were no instructions to the jury from a judge, no conferencing between jurists before voting, the juries were huge (typically between 201 and 501 members), cases depended largely on questions of probable motive, and notions of natural justice were felt to take precedence over written law—conditions that favoured artfully constructed speeches.* H. Yunis, Demosthenes: On The Crown, 263 (note 275).|$|E
50|$|One of the lay {{members should}} have {{experience}} from the employer's side of disputes {{and the other}} from the trade union movement.

50|$|On February 22, 2016, Dalton was arraigned on sixteen charges {{including}} six counts of murder, {{two counts of}} assault with intent to commit murder, and eight counts of using a firearm during the commission of a felony. He was to reappear in court on March 10 for a <b>preliminary</b> examination <b>hearing.</b> On March 3, {{he was ordered to}} undergo a psychiatric evaluation to determine his competence to stand trial. He reappeared in court on April 22, where it was ruled by the Michigan Center for Forensic Psychiatry that he was found competent to stand trial. Eusebio Solis, a former Calhoun County Chief Assistant Prosecutor and a former Calhoun County Commissioner, was appointed to represent Dalton in court.|$|R
5000|$|The {{night of}} Dunne's attack, {{responding}} officers found Sweeney standing by Dunne's unconscious body in her driveway. A {{spokesman for the}} West Hollywood police later told reporters that Sweeney told officers, [...] "I killed my girlfriend". He was immediately {{arrested and charged with}} attempted murder. Those charges were dropped after Dunne died on November 4, and Sweeney was charged with first-degree murder to which he pleaded not guilty. Sweeney was later charged with assault with intent to do great bodily harm when he admitted during a <b>preliminary</b> trial <b>hearing</b> to the altercation with Dunne that occurred on September 26, 1982, the day before she filmed the Hill Street Blues episode in which she appeared with visible bruises. He denied assaulting Dunne claiming that he was only trying to prevent her from leaving their home.|$|R
5|$|On January 14, 2010, he {{was placed}} under house arrest over accusations that he {{accepted}} money from Lucky Games SA casino. It was the first arrest of a former Panamanian president. In April, the bank account of his company Shelf Holding Inc. was frozen, and Pérez Balladares was required to hand over his passport following a trip to Peru. District Attorney Jose Ayu Prado announced in October 2010 that there was sufficient evidence to charge Pérez Balladares with money laundering. A <b>preliminary</b> <b>hearing</b> on the case was held on April 11, 2011, and the case was dismissed by the judge two weeks later. In December 2012, Ayu Prado was nominated to the Supreme Court. Perez Balladares stated via Twitter that the appointment was a trade for having persecuted him.|$|E
5|$|Preckwinkle {{chairs the}} ward organization, the Fourth Ward Democratic Organization, {{which was one}} of sixteen Chicago Democratic ward {{organizations}} named in a complaint filed on August 31, 2005 with the Illinois State Board of Elections by the Cook County Republican Party charging that Democratic Party ward organizations are illegally housed in City-funded neighborhood ward offices. Taxpayers fund aldermanic service centers, which are open to the public. State law prohibits the use of public funds by any candidate for political or campaign purposes. The complaint against Preckwinkle's ward organization was one of nine that a Hearing Officer appointed by the Board recommended proceed to the next step of the hearing process, an Open <b>Preliminary</b> <b>Hearing.</b> On October 17, 2005, at a regularly scheduled meeting of the Board of Elections, the Board entered an executive session and voted, in a 4–4 tie, along strict party lines, failing to adopt the recommendation of the Hearing Officer, and ordered the complaints dismissed. The complaint against Preckwinkle's ward organization was one of eight that the Cook County Republican Party appealed {{all the way to the}} Supreme Court of Illinois. On January 23, 2009, the Illinois Supreme Court unanimously ordered the Illinois appellate court to conduct a judicial review of the Board's dismissals of the complaints.|$|E
5|$|Tran {{made his}} first {{appearance}} in Sacramento County Superior Court on November 6, 2015, charged of the attempted murder of Stone with an allegation of using a dangerous weapon, a knife. He did not enter a plea, was ordered to be held without bail, and was scheduled to return to court December 1, 2015. On December 1, 2015, Tran again appeared in the Sacramento Superior Court for a bail review hearing. This was subsequently postponed, with Tran held without bail. On January 7th, 2016, Tran was again denied bail, and another <b>preliminary</b> <b>hearing</b> was set for February 26th, 2016. At the February 26th hearing, Sacramento County Deputy District Attorney Anthony Ortiz informed Superior Court Judge Geoffrey Goodman that his department plans to amend the original criminal charges against Tran, to include gang involvement in the assault. A gang involvement charge in California provides for additional penalties if the defendant is found guilty. Judge Goodman ordered another hearing to be held on March 30, 2016, {{to determine whether or}} not prosecutors have enough evidence to proceed with the charges against Tran.|$|E
50|$|For example, if {{two people}} think a law is unconstitutional, one might sue another {{in order to}} put the lawsuit before a court which can rule on its constitutionality. Because courts {{generally}} reserve jurisdiction for situations in which there is an actual case or controversy - i.e., a real dispute between the parties - where such a suit is suspected, the court may refuse to exercise jurisdiction. For example, the European Court of Justice does not <b>hear</b> <b>preliminary</b> references arising out of hypothetical disputes.|$|R
2500|$|On Friday, May 4, a U.S. District Court Judge {{issued a}} Temporary Restraining Order precluding the State of Tennessee from {{executing}} Workman until a <b>preliminary</b> injunction <b>hearing</b> assesses {{the constitutionality of}} Tennessee's revised procedure for administering lethal injections. However, this restraining order was vacated by a two-to-one decision of the U.S. Court for Appeals for the Sixth Circuit on Monday, May 7 and Workman was moved to death watch. The decision to vacate the restraining order was stridently criticized, on both procedural and substantive grounds, by the dissenting Judge Cole. Judge Cole wrote, [...] "The majority's opinion rests on a profound jurisdictional defect: There is no appealable order before this Court. The district court issued a temporary restraining order, not a preliminary injunction [...] [...] [...] The district court's TRO cannot be magically transformed into a preliminary injunction, which is an appealable order, even though the State {{and a majority of}} this Court may wish it." ...|$|R
2500|$|Kelly {{began his}} Double Up tour with Ne-Yo, Keyshia Cole and J. Holiday opening for him. After two shows, {{promoter}} Leonard Rowe had Ne-Yo {{removed from the}} tour because of a contract dispute. However, Ne-Yo alleges {{that the reason for}} the dropout was because Ne-Yo believes he received a better response from critics and fans, even though he only performed at two shows. Ne-Yo filed a lawsuit against Rowe Entertainment. It was shown that Kelly was not mentioned in the lawsuit. In December 2007, Kelly was showing up to another <b>preliminary</b> court <b>hearing</b> on his case due to his tour bus being held up in Utah. The judge threatened to revoke Kelly's bond, but the judge eventually decided not to. In 2008, Kelly released a rap track titled [...] "I'm a Beast" [...] in which he coarsely attacked his detractors, though Kelly himself never mentioned by name whom the song was directed to.|$|R
