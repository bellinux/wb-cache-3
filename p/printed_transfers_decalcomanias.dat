40|$|These prototypes are {{results of}} the AHRC funded {{research}} project - Extending the Potential for the Digitally Printed Ceramic Surface. Abstract: The digital laser <b>printed</b> <b>transfer</b> system offers the potential to change the qualities, speeds and economies of commercial ceramic production; this potential {{has not yet been}} exploited by the UK ceramics industry. The focus of the research project is extending the use of laser <b>printed</b> <b>transfer</b> systems by exploring the use of new materials, methods and economies within a commercial context. The research aimed to revitalize the UK ceramics industry and so support regeneration across the UK in locations where ceramics manufacturing is situated. Whilst it is already possible to use laser printing to produce ceramic transfers, this has remained a marginal technology in the UK, used only for single print or small batch production jobs; the current market model is a bureau-based service. Due to the limited resources and current client base of the bureaux, there has been a lack of investment in developing the process for large-scale manufacturing. The project has aimed to resolve this issue by building a consortium of innovators to explore the potential of this technology in large-scale manufacturing. The projects research team at the Royal College of Art collaborated throughout the project’s duration of two years, with the inventor and patent holder of the laser <b>printed</b> ceramic <b>transfer</b> process, Michael Zimmer of MZTT, his UK partners Digital Ceramic Systems and the high-value ceramic manufacturers, Royal Crown Derby...|$|R
40|$|Department of Energy EngineeringTransfer {{printing}} is {{a promising}} fabrication {{process for the}} high-performance electronic devices, novel device structures, and flexible electronics. It enables {{the combination of the}} current low-cost and well-established standard silicon process with high performance of III-V compound semiconductor to overcome the limitations of silicon devices, resulting in low-cost fabrication of high-performance devices. This process can be applied to not only III-V compound semiconductor technology but also low-dimensional materials (i. e. graphene and nanowires). In addition, it guarantees the freedom of choice of materials and substrates. Thus, combination and stacking process of various nanomaterials can be potentially employed by <b>transfer</b> <b>printing</b> for the fabrication of diverse hetero-structured optoelectronic applications. Furthermore, <b>transfer</b> <b>printing</b> of inorganic semiconductor onto flexible substrate enables to achieve high-performance flexible electronic system. As a result, the <b>transfer</b> <b>printing</b> has been actively studied in various research fields. In this thesis, we introduce the various <b>transfer</b> <b>printing</b> methods and their applications in electronic and optoelectronic devices. Firstly, Chapter 1 introduces the historical background and the necessity of the <b>transfer</b> <b>printing,</b> the mechanism of the various <b>transfer</b> <b>printing</b> methods, and its applications. In Chapter 2, we introduce the dry <b>transfer</b> <b>printing</b> method of InAs high electron mobility transistor (HEMT) on silicon substrate for the silicon-based high-performance electronic device. In Chapter 3, we introduce the broadband and high-photoresponsivity photodiode through hetero-integration of III-V compound semiconductors on Si substrates with high-quality interface. In Chapter 4, we show the adhesive layer-assisted <b>transfer</b> <b>printing</b> method and the wrinkling process of the III-V compound semiconductor nanomembranes by using the vacuum-induced stress control of nanomembranes on polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) microwell arrays. In this method, the size, direction, and location of wrinkle arrays can be easily controlled by changing the shape and location of the microwell arrays and the modulus of soft substrates. Finally, we introduce nanosheet-on-one-dimensional heterojunction photodiode by using wet <b>transfer</b> <b>printing</b> process in Chapter 5. The device shows high rectification ratio, very low dark current, and the high On/Off current ratio at room temperature under the light illumination. The <b>transfer</b> <b>printing</b> methods introduced in this thesis can be potentially employed in the fabrication of various heterostructure of semiconductors for diverse optoelectronic applications. ope...|$|R

Among five approaches of <b>transfer</b> <b>printing</b> summarized in the paper, the viscoelastic property of stamps is widely adopted to modulate the interfacial adhesion between the stamp and devices by applying different pulling speed. A viscoelastic model for <b>transfer</b> <b>printing</b> is established analytically.
