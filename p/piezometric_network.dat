40|$|The future {{irrigated}} {{zones of}} the Senegal river valley are actually accurately studied {{because of the}} risks of soil degradation. This phenomenon is increased by groundwater recharge under flooded culture, which could be understood using a dense <b>piezometric</b> <b>network.</b> In order to define the geometrical characteristics of the aquifer, a Schlumberger DC electrical survey soundings was carried out along 3 main profiles. In spite of scarce geological information, the interpretation gives precious indications on the aquifer system to locate accurately the future <b>piezometric</b> <b>network</b> and on complex lateral variations in superficial soils. This classical approach seems also to be adequate to explore and understand the main soil systems and to give a deeper image of the soils than the image given by shallow pits. (Résumé d'auteur...|$|E

A <b>piezometric</b> <b>network</b> was used to obtain water table data {{in the vicinity of}} each pond. The data collected for each pond was evaluated to calculate monthly hydraulic conductivity coefficients. The lowest value for pond 1 was 0. 78 feet/day, while the low values for ponds 2 and 3 were 1. 86 and 1. 67 feet/day respectively.

40|$|International audienceFor a {{long time}} ago {{considered}} as a region devoid of big aquifers, Brittany’s region has a <b>piezometric</b> <b>network</b> since 10 years contrary to other regions equipped since the 1970 s. Its implementation was financed by Loire-Bretagne Water Agency, BRGM, Regional Council of Brittany, and Regional Department for the environment. Since 2008, network’s supervision and follow-up is financed by ONEMA and BRGM. Brittany’s <b>piezometric</b> <b>network</b> is constituted by 52 boreholes equipped with automatic acquisition of water level and with data’s remote transmission. Among these points, 48 are settled in hard-rock aquifers (4 others follow alluviums or tertiary aquifers). Their location has been carefully cogitated, and it allows to cover main geological and hydrogeological formations existing in Brittany and takes into account weather conditions very contrasted from west to east and between coast and the inland. After check and validation, data are stored and put at the public’s disposal on the French national groundwater database called ADES. 10 years after its implementation, piezometric network’s basic data of Brittany are useful for various valorisations and plenty of different uses : evaluation of groundwater bodies quantitative status, bulletins of groundwater’s level situations, elaboration of indicators piezometric dedicated to the departmental management of the drinking water, contribution of groundwater to rivers flows, diagnosis of floods by water table rise, interactive dashboard…Acquired data have also allowed to better understand Brittany’s hard-rock aquifers : dynamics and slowness, cycles of data variation, memory effect, overflowing, time of water table’s drop, and blocking high levels...|$|E

40|$|In the Mo. S. E. {{project for}} the {{protection}} of Venice against exceptional high tides, the development of Treporti (Lido's inlet) and Ca' Roman (Chioggia's inlet) harbours in the Venice Lagoon required the realization of two provisional sea basins (cofferdams) which will be drained to provide access to the building sites, positioned below the sea level. The dewatering systems installed on the perimeter of the basins, which have been active since 2005 in Punta Sabbioni and since 2007 in Ca' Roman, permitted to dry up the cofferdams, where the concrete lodging caissons of mobile barriers are to be built. Two groundwater monitoring systems have been emplaced to measure hydraulic heads in the first and second aquifer levels, in order to monitor the effects of the dewatering systems in the proximity of the constructions sites. The monitoring network is composed of more than twenty piezometers intercepting both aquifer layers in Punta Sabbioni (Lido's inlet) and two in Ca' Roman (Chioggia's inlet). The monitoring systems emplaced in both sites permitted to discriminate between the effects of natural driving forces (rainfall, atmospheric pressure, tidal oscillations) from the anthropogenic ones (construction and dewatering of the cofferdam). The effects of construction works in the first phreatic aquifer have been highlighted by shallow piezometers. The measurements indicate a partial isolation of this groundwater body from the sea with a consequent increase in the hydraulic head and a decrease in the groundwater salinity. The deep piezometers next to the cofferdam showed instead a decrease of hydraulic head due to dewatering operations. The lecture will describe the natural and anthropogenic system driving forces, the characteristics of the <b>piezometric</b> monitoring <b>network</b> and of the installed instrumentation, and will analyse in the details the groundwater level monitoring operations relating them with the pre-established high and low level threshold...|$|R
40|$|International audienceIn {{a climate}} change context, the {{availability}} of real time and forecast piezometric data is essential information for decision makers. Indeed, associated with threshold values (groundwater levels corresponding to different alert discharges values) those data can indicate if a crisis situation is expected, either drought or flooding episodes. To meet societal expectations, BRGM (French geological survey) currently works on improving its national <b>piezometric</b> data <b>network.</b> Raw data from sensors are exposed in interoperable formats and services in accordance with international open standards for sensorWeb interoperability and European rules (INSPIRE directive guidance {{on the use of}} Observations & Measurements and OGC SWE-Sensor Web Enablement Framework). The objective of the " MétéEau des Nappes " project is to deploy an interoperable communication tool unable to cross data from different networks (meteorology, river flow, piezometric) in order to characterize in almost real-time groundwater quantitative state. A prototype of this tool was deployed on a few selected French regions with different hydrogeological characteristics and various issues (drought or flooding). Preliminary steps were to define case studies (watersheds) to select the representative piezometers and the corresponding measured stations and, eventually to calibrate models that provide piezometric level forecasts. At the present stage, the tool shows maps giving the location of measured stations and charts drawing the real time evolution of data compared to thresholds and model predictions. It also provides the model predictions as a Sensor Observation Service in addition to the raw data flows. BRGM also contributes to the achievement of the national hydrological situation report (monthly evolution of water resource) on behalf of the French ministry of Environment. Then the final step of the project is to integrate into the tool a map showing specified indicators of the groundwater state and trends. Perspectives of the project are the implementation of data assimilation and automatic forecasting processes into the models. Among the French stakeholders interested in the tool, we can indicate: Water agencies, decentralized services of ministries, Regions and Departments, Association of Municipalities, Industrial water producers...|$|R
40|$|A yearly {{survey in}} a <b>piezometric</b> <b>network</b> was {{realized}} in the Litorale Romano Natural Reserve (Rome, Central Italy), collecting water table and chemo-physical data. Monthly chemo-physical surveys highlighted a groundwater salinization variability in a coastal unconfined aquifer. The aquifer is mostly composed by aeolian sands of a still preserved dune ridge environment, on which a pine forest develops. The groundwater salinity variability resulted {{is connected to the}} wind pattern and rainfalls. In fact, wind speed higher than 4  m/s is responsible for generating sea salt aerosols (SSA) from sea surface. A statistical analysis was performed for wind with a speed higher than 4  m/s, to detect wind orientation. The dry deposition of SSA on the tree foliage appeared correlated to the westerly winds, blowing in the springtime. When the rainy season occurs, the SSA is washed out from the trees and it is directed to groundwater, where an enhancement of the Electrical Conductivity (EC) values is noticed. Whenever rain events occur and winds are not westerly, a dilution of groundwater salinity takes place and consequently a reduction of EC. Chemical analyzes were realized as well. They confirmed that groundwater of piezometers located close to the coast line is enriched of SSA elements...|$|E
40|$|International audienceThanks {{to recent}} {{evolutions}} in environmental sensors, new data transmission associated with better autonomy, {{it is now}} feasible toconsider raw data quality with more confidence. Even if human QA/QC activity is still required (at least to check the overall workflowstatus), raw data {{can be considered as}} fitted for direct reuse. Groundwater level data and their near real time availability (raw data) answer to important societal needs:- Natural resource management in a climate change context with even more frequent drought episodes and their impact on qualityand quantity of the resource,- But also civil security in specific geological contexts where surface/ground water connexion associated with water table rise have adirect impact on flood events. Parallel to these, the ICT context is also evolving with more mature international open standards for sensorWeb interoperability(namely the OGC SWE - Sensor Web Enablement Framework) along with their endorsement by Legal obligations (INSPIRE directive) and communities. BRGM is conducting a dedicated joint SensorWeb activity between its IT and Water/Environment/Ecotechnologies division for severalyears. This transversal activity enables both:- The appropriation of the IT context and opportunities by domain experts,- And the possibility to be active on the international IT context (OGC, INSPIRE) so that international interoperability standardsdefinition and application is close to domain needs. This presentation will focus on the IT changes the French national <b>piezometric</b> <b>network</b> is currently going through. From the sensor onthe field, to the central information system, data validation, exploitation and reuse the system is progressively proposing a change ofparadigm in hydrogeologists activities. As a conclusion these changes will be linked to new opportunities, partnerships with other institutions (ex: dynamic Groundwaterlevel forecast – MétéEau des nappes) and but also to new challenges (vendor specific formats, big data, data accessibility) theycreate...|$|E
40|$|International audienceOn November 29, 2007, at 3 : 00 pm {{local time}} (7 : 00 TU), a 7. 4 {{earthquake}} occurred at about 30 km north {{from the island}} of Martinique, and was widely felt in all the Caribbean, from Jamaica to French Guyana. Piezometric levels changes (some abrupt rises or decreases), apparently correlated with the earthquake, were recorded by 12 of the 24 piezometers from the groundwater monitoring network of Martinique. Such reactions have already been observed notably in Japan, in the US or in Armenia. Variation of spring discharge or piezometric level changes induced by earthquake have been widely described, and synthesized. Most of them occur after the quake, nevertheless, some precursors have also been described. The present earthquake {{and its effects on}} piezometric levels are very interesting as the <b>piezometric</b> <b>network</b> is dense and the levels are not affected by external noise. The earthquake occurred after two dry weeks, and the local seismic activity was very low prior to the quake. Moreover, to our knowledge, {{it is the first time}} that hydrologic responses to an earthquake are reported and described in the Caribbean. The main objectives of this poster are to analyze the piezometric level changes observed in Martinique and attributed to this earthquake, to deeper characterize the earthquake mechanism and if possible to better understand the structure and functioning of the aquifers from Martinique. This poster will also spot piezometers that show probable precursors. These precursors consist in a decrease of the recession slope and/or of no more discernable barometric and/or tidal effects. These precursors begin approximately 30 to 75 h before the earthquake each at a different date. They all reveal a compression (a probable increase of the stresses) before the quake; the piezometers with such a precursor showing then systematically a co-seismic distension...|$|E
40|$|The goal of {{this work}} is to {{illustrate}} a methodology aimed at planning a monitoring network in urban areas affected by hydrogeological instability phenomena. The monitoring network will provide a continuous collection of data and their transmission through a Global Position System (GPS) to a central collecting and processing office. The monitoring of an area prone to high landslide risk, as could be any urban area (the town of Poggioreale in our study case), should {{take into consideration the}} collection of data relevant both for the knowledge of the landslide features {{as well as for the}} planning of reclamation action. At the same time it would also seem opportune to collect data relating to deep movements, to neutral pressures and to atmospheric parameters. All these data will be detected, collected and transmitted using a GPS technology in order to create a database to be consulted in real time, easily added to in time and useful for defining the pre-alert and/or alert thresholds. Of course, a careful evaluation of the geological and geomorphological elements is needed to optimize the amount and the distribution of the monitoring points in the planning of such a monitoring network. The characterization of the geological, hydrological and morphological aspects is necessary to identify the parameters to be used for monitoring purposes. In the Poggioreale area, the lithological and hydrological features and the amount of rainfall constitute the main factors responsible for gravitational processes (MONTELEONE et alii, 2000). The morphology of the area as a whole is in particular or especially characterized by complex landslides which indicate the precarious state of the slopes. The monitoring of the Poggioreale area, should therefore provide for: deep displacement, surface displacement, neutral pressures and rainfall conditions (BAMBINA et alii, 2003). Those sites selected as monitoring points of the network, lie in the downtown urban area and in its immediate neighbourhood. The choice of such points has been made according to two basic criteria: the presence of areas particularly subject to reactivation slope processes and the presence of public infrastructure, dwellings and technological systems representing areas of greatest economic value. The different types of landslide impose also a random planning of sections relating to surface and deep movements, whose positions correspond to those significant areas, aimed at controlling the evolution of the slope instability. The <b>piezometric</b> control <b>network</b> has been planned taking into consideration the variability of the water table which is a function of the different degree of permeability showed by different elements of the Sandy-Marly Formation of the Belice Valley...|$|R

The objective is also to show the data coming from modelling and forecasting of groundwater’s levels (high and low) with cards and curves. This project, led by a multidisciplinary team (hydrogeologists, computer scientists, and geostatistical men of the BRGM), deals with various scientific and technical bolts : storage and provision of basic data coming from more than 1400 sensors of groundwater’s levels and from the forecasts, model tools for the prediction of the aquifers functioning, interoperable communication tools/standards allowing exploitation and crossing data from other networks (meteorology, river flow) daily to characterize in almost real-time quantitative state of groundwater resources…After 3 years of project, a practical and innovative tool could be set up. It would allow varied uses : going of the simple display of current and future height or depth of groundwater table by water’s stakeholders (French SAGE’s moderators, technicians of river catchments), to the improvement of the water use management in the dry season or in the flood season by State’s Services (for example : order of water restriction).

40|$|This paper {{evaluates the}} {{perceptions}} and conceptual basis in hyporheic flow (HF) modeling. The combination of flow processes at several scales may currently not be well described by mechanistic models {{which are often}} limited by the calibration data and the modeler's understanding of the system. For example, transient storage models calibrated on tracer tests may underestimate long residence time (days) flow paths; the Darcy approach based on hydraulic heads tends to underestimate the shorter ones (hours). This {{has important implications for}} predicting contaminant fluxes through the hyporheic zone at the catchment scale. A set of standard measurements (metrics) in the hyporheic physical environment, combined with a typology of HF systems are discussed as promising lines to predict the relative magnitude of changes of residence time, flow budgets and spatial extent of flow paths. Since models {{do not need to be}} strictly realistic in terms of structure, the potential for hyporheic metrics to inspire simplified models is stressed. Such an approach may be appealing to ecologists who must integrate the hydrological component in more complex systems. These metrics are discussed on the basis of both experimental evidence and theoretical studies. Because some metrics may only apply to specific environments, a typology of hyporheic systems is presented which is a function of the physiographic setting, including scale and dynamics, and the biogeochemical problem addressed. There has been speculation that stream morpho-dynamic controls on HF deal more with shallow exchange, which is often easier to measure. Such a bias may be addressed by building on the hydrogeological experience and concepts in dealing with heterogeneous media, in particular in groundwater contaminant literature. More widely, environmental modelling principles such as equifinality and predictive uncertainty, which are often ignored in hyporheic studies, are discussed on the basis of generic HF models. The scope for hyporheic metrics and a physical typology of hyporheic systems is illustrated by the study case of a groundwater-fed river in the UK. A range of methodological tools, such as electrical resistivity profiles, environmental and artificial tracers, <b>piezometric</b> <b>network</b> development, has been applied from the bedform to the kilometre scale...|$|E
40|$|Dissertação de mest., Recursos Hídricos, Faculdade de Ciências e Tecnologia, Univ. do Algarve, 2011 According to the International Panel for Climatic Changes (IPCC), {{decreases}} in {{mean annual precipitation}} and changes in its annual distribution associated with increases in temperature, can lead to significant decrease in recharge of aquifers in southern Europe, which can turn into a major problem at a large regional scale. Moura-Ficalho aquifer (MF) is a karstic-fissured aquifer made of Paleozoic carbonate rocks (dolomitic rocks and marbles) in the Alentejo region, located in south of Portugal. Beside this predicted decrease in recharge, in this aquifer the situation was increased by soil erosion and clogging of sink holes and other karstic recharge structures, so in MF decrease in recharge has been detected and, for this reason more research and measures to reverse this desertification evolution are required. The unbalanced condition of this aquifer was first detected after {{the implementation of a}} monitoring <b>piezometric</b> <b>network</b> (Costa, in ERHSA, 2001) and the calibration of a groundwater flow model using data collected from October 2000 until December 2005 (Costa, 2008). According to the transient model developed on a monthly base, by A. Costa, water recharge was not enough to compensate the water losses by the aquifer. The simulation period included one wet year (2000 / 01), three mean years (from 2001 to 2004) and a very dry year (2004 / 05). However, mean annual precipitation in these five years was 530 mm, which equals the mean annual precipitation estimated by considering long time series. Furthermore, according to predicted climate changes, the climate trends towards drier weather and so, this problem will tend to become increased, probably not only in MF but also in other karstic aquifer in southern part of Portugal. This work intends to investigate the relationship between groundwater and surface water, and to detect areas where the natural recharge is taking place and where it should be increased in order to mitigate this environmental problem. To reach this aim, several scenarios of the former groundwater modeling outputs were worked out with the help of Geographic Information System (Arc GIS). Also the subject about artificial recharge of aquifers was developed and applied to this region...|$|E
40|$|International audienceLocated in {{northern}} Botswana, the Okavango Delta {{is a vast}} wetland, fed from the Angolan highlands and constrainedby a half-graben in the Kalahari depression. Since the 70 ’s, the Okavango graben is usually consideredas the terminus of the East African Rift System. But a recent geodetic study showed {{there has been no}} extensionon the tectonic structure over the past 5 years, and recent geophysical studies began to call this hypothesis intoquestion. The deformation in the area could instead be related to far-field deformation accommodation due to themotion of the Kalahari craton relative {{to the rest of the}} Nubian plate and to the opening of the Rift Valley. Getting to the vertical deformation isn’t trivial. The GNSS time series show a strong annual deformation of theground surface (3 cm of amplitude). On the vertical component, this periodic signal is so strong that it hides thetectonic long-term deformation, while this information would give a crucial insight on the geodynamic process atplay. This periodic signal is related to the seasonal loading of water due to the rainy season. This hypothesis is corroboratedby the modeling of the surface deformation based on the GRACE satellites data, interpreted as the variationof groundwater amount. In the Okavango Delta, the peak of water level isn’t paced with the local precipitations,but is driven by a flood pulse coming from the Angolan Highlands. The migration of this massive water body isn’tvisible at first order in GRACE data. Yet, local precipitations are supposed to undergo too much evapotranspirationto be significant in the hydrological balance. Thus this later water body isn’t supposed to produce a mass anomalyin GRACE time series. This paradox could highlight a relationship not yet defined between groundwater and localrainfall. The wide spatial resolution of GRACE data (about 300 km) doesn’t allow a modeling accurate enough to give accessto the slow tectonic deformation, nor to determine the groundwater behavior within the basin. While GRACEdata show a strong groundwater variation in the area, very few direct data are available on this hydrological reservoir. We thus decided to implement a new geodetic and <b>piezometric</b> <b>network</b> in the Okavango Delta. The first results show an unpredicted influence of the local rainfall on the water table elevation, with disturbanceor even stop of decrease of the water table.
