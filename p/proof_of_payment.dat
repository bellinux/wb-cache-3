25|$|Passengers in an LRT <b>proof</b> <b>of</b> <b>payment</b> area must present <b>proof</b> <b>of</b> <b>payment</b> {{upon request}} by an ETS officer. <b>Proof</b> <b>of</b> <b>payment</b> {{includes}} LRT tickets, transfers, validated transit tickets and transit passes. Failure to provide <b>proof</b> <b>of</b> <b>payment</b> {{can result in}} a $250 fine. <b>Proof</b> <b>of</b> <b>payment</b> areas include all LRT trains and LRT station platforms, unless the ticket vending machines are located on the platform itself.|$|E
25|$|<b>Proof</b> <b>of</b> <b>payment</b> is {{used for}} fare {{collection}} along the route. On June 23, 2015, CTDOT began issuing $75 tickets for riders found to have not paid their fare.|$|E
25|$|Passengers {{paying a}} cash fare at a fare machine at an LRT station are issued a transit ticket, which is {{validated}} as an LRT ticket after being time-stamped. This ticket is valid both as <b>proof</b> <b>of</b> <b>payment</b> {{and as a}} transfer. Transfers allow the passenger to transfer from the LRT to a bus, from a bus to the LRT and between buses, and is valid for 90 minutes from {{the time it was}} stamped. Passengers paying a cash fare or validating a ticket on a bus obtain a transfer at the time the fare is paid. Transfers also serve as <b>proof</b> <b>of</b> <b>payment</b> for 90 minutes.|$|E
50|$|Viva Orange duplicates the routing of the Toronto Transit Commission's 196 York University Rocket bus {{rapid transit}} route between York University and Sheppard West Station. On this segment, both TTC and YRT <b>proofs</b> <b>of</b> <b>payment</b> are accepted.|$|R
50|$|GNU Taler is an {{electronic}} payment system developed in the public at Inria, France. It largely functions like digital cash with {{an electronic}} wallet. The system is based on blind signature and provides cryptographic <b>proofs</b> <b>of</b> <b>payment.</b> It is said to become operational in 2017.|$|R
50|$|Viva Orange shares routing with Brampton Transit's 501 Züm Queen {{express bus}} route between Martin Grove and York University, {{and has been}} fare {{integrated}} with it since its creation in September 2010. Both Brampton Transit and York Region Transit <b>proofs</b> <b>of</b> <b>payment</b> are accepted for {{the entire length of}} both bus routes.|$|R
25|$|Failure to pay {{the fare}} or produce valid <b>proof</b> <b>of</b> <b>payment</b> is an offence. Fare {{inspections}} are conducted by the South Coast British Columbia Transportation Authority Police Service and Transit Security. Fraudulent use of fares (e.g., using a fake pass, using another person's non-transferable pass,) may result in criminal charges. Passengers found without a valid fare or who fail to produce valid <b>proof</b> <b>of</b> <b>payment</b> are served with an Infraction Ticket of $173, under the Fare Collection Regulation. In September 2012, amendments to the South Coast British Columbia Transportation Authority Act came into effect, making TransLink responsible for collection of fines issued by Transit Police and Transit Security. Since October 5, 2015, all bus travel is considered one-zone travel and no additional fares are required for crossing fare boundaries on the bus.|$|E
25|$|A Fare Paid Zone is {{a clearly}} marked {{territory}} on which passengers must have valid <b>proof</b> <b>of</b> <b>payment</b> and present it for inspection upon request of a Transit Security Officer. Initially, these were only in effect in SkyTrain and SeaBus stations and vehicles until June 25, 2007, when {{the law was}} changed. Now, all buses, including West Vancouver buses, are designated Fare Paid Zones. The reason for implementing Fare Paid Zones on buses was to remove the responsibility of fare enforcement from bus drivers, as {{too many of them}} were being assaulted in disputes over fare payment. Fare enforcement on all buses are now the responsibility of the Transit Police and Transit Security Department. Officers may board a bus at any time and conduct a fare inspection. Those who fail to pay the fare and retain <b>proof</b> <b>of</b> <b>payment</b> could be removed from the bus and/or fined $173.|$|E
25|$|As February 2008, 98 B-Line route {{passengers}} with valid <b>proof</b> <b>of</b> <b>payment</b> {{were permitted}} to board using {{any of the three}} doors at any stop. To facilitate this, the bus driver controlled the operation of all three doors at each of the stops. Passengers paying cash or validating FareSavers had to board through the front door.|$|E
40|$|The paper {{traces the}} {{evolution}} of the tally from a receipt for cash payments into the treasury, to <b>proof</b> <b>of</b> <b>payments</b> made by royal officials outside of the treasury and finally to an assignment of revenue to be paid out by royal officials. Each of these processes is illustrated by examples drawn from the Exchequer records and explains their significance for royal finance and for historians working on the Exchequer records...|$|R
5000|$|Unattended {{devices are}} often called [...] "validators", a term which {{originated}} with devices that would stamp a date/time onto paper tickets to provide <b>proof</b> <b>of</b> valid <b>payment</b> for a conductor.|$|R
50|$|That no indorsement or {{memorandum}} <b>of</b> any <b>payment</b> {{written or}} made upon any promissory note, bill of exchange, or other writing, {{by the party}} to whom such payment shall be made, shall be deemed sufficient <b>proof</b> <b>of</b> such <b>payment,</b> so as {{to take the case}} out of the operation the above acts.|$|R
25|$|Until April 2016, SkyTrain's fare {{system was}} a proof-of-payment system; {{there were no}} {{turnstiles}} at the entrances to train platforms. Instead, fares were enforced by random ticket inspections – usually by police or transit security but occasionally by SkyTrain attendants – through trains and stations, or at special events such as after BC Lions or Vancouver Canucks games. The fine for failure to show <b>proof</b> <b>of</b> <b>payment,</b> fare evasion, ticket reselling, or other scams is $173.|$|E
25|$|The tickets {{may have}} to be shown or checked {{automatically}} at the station platform or when boarding, or during the ride by a conductor. Operators may choose to control all riders, allowing sale of the ticket at the time of ride. Alternatively, a proof-of-payment system allows riders to enter the vehicles without showing the ticket, but riders {{may or may not be}} controlled by a ticket controller; if the rider fails to show <b>proof</b> <b>of</b> <b>payment,</b> the operator may fine the rider at the magnitude of the fare.|$|E
25|$|MAX uses a proof-of-payment system; riders {{must carry}} a valid ticket or pass at all times. Tickets or passes are {{purchased}} before boarding and retained as <b>proof</b> <b>of</b> <b>payment.</b> Passengers must board the train {{before the time}} on ticket or pass expires, and are allowed to ride past {{the time on the}} ticket, provided the train was boarded before the expiration time. After validation, tickets are valid for 2½ hours and passes are valid until end of service day, and can be used an unlimited number of times, for travel in any direction, on MAX, WES, TriMet buses, Portland Streetcar, and C-Tran buses (except express routes).|$|E
40|$|Ecosystem {{service value}} (ESV) {{transfer}} {{is a hot}} spot in ecology, also a focus of ecological economics, {{as well as the}} basis of countries to develop ecological compensation policies. This paper built a ESV transfer assessment model according to the Breaking-point model and field intensity theory. Weigan River Basin, {{which is one of the}} nine branches of Tarim River Basin, the largest inland river in arid area in China, was taken as an example, with ArcGIS 9. 2 buffer and overlay analysis, the scope and intensity of ecosystem service value transfer from upstream to downstream were calculated.

5000|$|Due to {{apparent}} FCC paperwork {{problems or}} misunderstandings, the official license for W10BM was deleted on October 18, 2004; however, bills for fees from the FCC continued to arrive and were paid; the owner has saved these notices for fees and <b>proof</b> <b>of</b> <b>payments</b> made. The licenses for other separate LPTV channels (W06BC) {{of the same}} owners were allegedly canceled on August 1, 1998. The stations' owners {{continue to try to}} get this situation resolved, if possible. Local moral and advertiser support has helped to keep the station on the air, despite these setbacks. The station's current hosts and studio manager are apparently open to any useful ideas to continue their [...] "independent" [...] community service.|$|R
50|$|Invoices are {{different}} from receipts. Both invoices and receipts are ways of tracking purchases of goods and services. In general {{the content of the}} invoices can be similar to that of receipts including tracking the amount of the sale, calculating sales tax owed and calculating any discounts applied to the purchase. Invoices differ from receipts in that invoices serve to notify customers <b>of</b> <b>payments</b> owed, whereas receipts serve as <b>proof</b> <b>of</b> completed <b>payment.</b>|$|R
25|$|A {{new line}} to Coquitlam and Port Moody (the Evergreen Line) was {{completed}} in December 2016. There is planning for {{an extension of the}} Millennium Line through Vancouver City to the University of British Columbia. Turnstiles have been added to all existing stations in the system. In the past, SkyTrain used a <b>proof</b> <b>of</b> <b>payment</b> honour system. In the capital city of Victoria BC Transit and the provincial government's infrastructure ministry are working together to create a bus rapid transit from the Westshore communities to downtown Victoria. In Kamloops there is a rapid transit/ bus GPS trail underway to see how bus rapid transit effects smaller cities, rather than larger (Victoria and Vancouver).|$|E
25|$|The {{cash fare}} for Muni Metro, like Muni buses, {{effective}} July 1, 2017, is $2.75 {{for adults and}} $1.35 for youth ages 5–17, seniors, and the disabled. Like Muni buses, the Muni Metro operates on a proof-of-payment system; on paying a fare, the passenger will receive a ticket good for travel on any bus, historic streetcar, or Metro vehicle for 90 minutes. Payment methods depend on boarding location. On surface street sections {{in the south and}} west of the city, passengers can board {{at the front of the}} train and pay their fare to the train operator to receive their ticket; those who already have a ticket, or who have a daily, weekly, or monthly pass, can board at any door of the Metro streetcar. Subway stations have controlled entries via faregates, and passengers usually purchase or show Muni staff a ticket in order to enter the platform area. Faregates closest to an unmanned Muni staff booth open automatically if a passenger has a valid pass or transfer that cannot be scanned. Muni's fare inspectors may board trains at any time to check for <b>proof</b> <b>of</b> <b>payment</b> from passengers.|$|E
500|$|A {{properly}} prepared substitute {{check is}} considered the legal equivalent of the original paper check that can be accepted for payment or <b>proof</b> <b>of</b> <b>payment</b> {{in the same manner}} as the original check. Every substitute check must adhere to the following requirements before it can be recognized as the legal equivalent of the original check: ...|$|E

50|$|Employers had {{to file a}} {{pay-roll}} {{report in}} the form of an individual periodical reporting leaflet (feuillet de cotisations) for each insured wage earner employed, plus a summary sheet (bordereau) for the entire group. The bordereau lists the name, registration number, and total contribution amount of each worker employed by the employer. Tax stamps were affixed on the bordereau as <b>proof</b> <b>of</b> the <b>payment</b> <b>of</b> social insurance contributions.|$|R

2500|$|Ticketing on the Trillium Line works {{entirely on}} a proof-of-payment basis; {{there are no}} ticket {{barriers}} or turnstiles, and the driver does not check fares. Occasionally, OC Transpo employees wait at stations and require <b>proof</b> <b>of</b> <b>payment.</b> Tickets can be purchased from a vending machine on the platform, and certain bus passes are also valid for the Trillium Line. Trillium Line tickets are exchanged for bus transfers upon boarding a bus. [...] Although bus transfers {{can be used to}} board the O-Train, prepaid bus tickets cannot.|$|E
2500|$|When {{the line}} opened, fare {{collection}} was modelled on traditional rapid transit lines, with booth attendants. Low volumes of activity at some entrances led to weekend closures of alternate station entrances. In November 1980, Edmonton Transit (as {{it was then}} named) switched to a modified European-style [...] "proof of payment" [...] system, retaining the old turnstiles to issue the new receipts. Fares were now collected by automated ticket vending machines with irregular <b>proof</b> <b>of</b> <b>payment</b> inspectors, which permitted keeping all entrances open and required fewer staff.|$|E
50|$|Güney's {{employment}} records {{start on}} 1 May 1988. He has assumed {{a variety of}} jobs, mostly in journalism, to cover his actual profession of espionage. At {{the time he was}} exfiltrated to the United States, he was receiving a government pension. Since he is too young (29) to have retired, this has been adduced as <b>proof</b> <b>of</b> covert <b>payment</b> from the government. His file from the Social Security Administration (Emekli Sandığı) was classified during the investigation.|$|R
5000|$|An {{in-vehicle}} {{parking meter}} (IVPM) (also known as in-vehicle personal meter, in-car parking meter, or personal parking meter) is a handheld electronic device, {{roughly the size}} of a pocket calculator, that drivers display in their car windows either as a parking permit or as <b>proof</b> <b>of</b> parking <b>payment.</b> [...] IVPM was first implemented in the late 1980s in Arlington, VA, and is spreading to campuses and municipalities worldwide as a centralized method of parking management, revenue collection, and compliance enforcement.|$|R
60|$|Besides, if his {{customers}} {{at any time}} paid him money, let them look to themselves, and to their Acquitances, for he would usually attempt to call for that payment again, specially if he {{thought that there was}} hopes of making a prize thereby, and then to be sure if they could not produce good and sufficient ground <b>of</b> the <b>payment,</b> a hundred to one but they payed it again.

2500|$|The mail or post is {{a system}} for {{physically}} transporting postcards, letters, and parcels. A postal service can be private or public, though many governments place restrictions on private systems. Since the mid-19th century, national postal systems have generally been established as government monopolies with a fee on the article prepaid. <b>Proof</b> <b>of</b> <b>payment</b> is often {{in the form of}} adhesive postage stamps, but postage meters are also used for bulk mailing. Modern private postal systems are typically distinguished from national postal agencies by the names [...] "courier" [...] or [...] "delivery service".|$|E
2500|$|In most {{countries}} {{a system of}} codes has been created (referred to as ZIP codes in the United States, postcodes in the United Kingdom and Australia, and postal codes in most other countries), {{in order to facilitate}} the automation of operations. This also includes placing additional marks on the address portion of the letter or mailed object, called [...] "bar coding." [...] Bar coding of mail for delivery is usually expressed either by a series of vertical bars, usually called POSTNET coding, or a block of dots as a two-dimensional barcode. The [...] "block of dots" [...] method allows for the encoding of <b>proof</b> <b>of</b> <b>payment</b> of postage, exact routing for delivery, and other features.|$|E
2500|$|Vehicle Excise Duty, also {{commonly}} known as 'VED', 'vehicle tax', 'car tax' and 'road tax', is a vehicle road use tax levied as an excise duty which must be paid for most types of vehicle which are to be used (or parked) on the public roads in the United Kingdom. Motor vehicles used on public roads {{no longer need to}} display a current vehicle licence (tax disc) as <b>proof</b> <b>of</b> <b>payment</b> which will not be issued without prior proof that the vehicle has valid MOT and insurance. [...] A 'Statutory Off Road Notification (SORN)' must be made for a registered vehicle that is not being used on the road, and which has been taxed since 31 January 1998.|$|E
