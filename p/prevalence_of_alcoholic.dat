40|$|To {{identify}} {{the consumption of}} alcoholic beverage and the relation with hypertension, their prevalence and associated factors, in indigenous Mura, Brazil. A cross-sectional population-based {{study was conducted with}} 455 adult indigenous aged 18 years or more of Mura ethnics in Amazonia, Brazil. Interview was conducted and the alcohol intake was assessed by the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test. Blood pressure was measured in three measurements and the mean of the last two measurements was used. Physical examination included the following data: weight, height, waist and neck circumference, bioimpedance, and capillary measurement of glucose, triglycerides and cholesterol. Through multivariate Logistic regression in stepwise, the odds ratios for alcohol consumption and associated factors were identified. The <b>prevalence</b> <b>of</b> <b>alcoholic</b> beverage was 40. 2 %, with no significant difference for hypertension in those who drink (23. 0 %) {{and those who did not}} drink (29. 0 %). Referred hypertension in indigenous was associated to less use of alcoholic beverages (14. 2 % vs 24. 3 %, P = 0. 009). After an adjusted analysis (Odds Ratio, 95 % CI), there was a positive association between alcoholic drink intake and male sex (10. 27, CI: 5. 76 - 18. 30), smoking (4. 72, CI: 2. 35 - 9. 46) and live in rural areas (9. 77, CI: 5. 08 - 18. 79). On the other hand, age (0. 95, IC: 0. 94 - 0. 97), and absence of dyslipidemia (0. 41, CI: 0. 19 - 0. 89) were associated to lower alcohol consumption. The <b>prevalence</b> <b>of</b> <b>alcoholic</b> beverage was high and associated with referred hypertension, but this association was not maintained after adjusted analysis. Changes to habits and inappropriate lifestyles in indigenous populations and living in urban areas may contribute to increase risk for cardiovascular diseases. Therefore, health policies should be implemented to meet the uniqueness of indigenous people...|$|E
40|$|Patients with {{cirrhosis}} who are {{hospitalized for}} an acute decompensation (AD) and also have organ failure(s) {{are at high}} risk of short-term death. These patients have a syndrome called Acute-on-Chronic Liver Failure (ACLF). ACLF is now considered as a new syndrome that it is distinct from “mere” AD {{not only because of the}} presence of organ failure(s) and high short-term mortality but also because of younger age, higher <b>prevalence</b> <b>of</b> <b>alcoholic</b> etiology of cirrhosis, higher prevalence of some precipitants (such as bacterial infections, active alcoholism), and more intense systemic inflammatory response. ACLF is a new syndrome also because severe sepsis or severe alcoholic hepatitis do not account for 100 % of the observed cases; in fact, almost 50 % of the cases are of “unknown” origin. In other words, severe sepsis, severe alcoholic hepatitis and ACLF of “unknown origin” are subcategories of the syndrome...|$|E
40|$|Although {{per capita}} alcohol consumption, {{and thus the}} <b>prevalence</b> <b>of</b> <b>alcoholic</b> liver disease, {{decreases}} generally with age in Europe and in the United States, recently an increase in alcohol consumption {{has been reported in}} individuals over 65 years. Reasons explaining this observation may include an increase in life expectancy or a loss of life partners and, thus, loneliness and depression. Although ethanol metabolism and ethanol distribution change with age, and an elderly person's liver is more susceptible to the toxic effect of ethanol, the spectrum of alcoholic liver diseases and their symptoms and signs is similar to that seen in patients of all ages. However, prognosis of alcoholic liver disease in the elderly is poor. In addition, chronic alcohol consumption may enhance drug associated liver disease and may also act as a cofactor in other liver diseases, such as viral hepatitis and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease...|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: Smoking, {{drinking}} and chewing tobacco product, common habits in India have been {{positively associated with}} oral lesions. No study has been conducted {{in this part of}} Tamilnadu regarding the <b>prevalence</b> <b>of</b> oral lesions in relation to habits. METHODS: A hospital based cross-sectional study was carried out at Ragas Dental College, Chennai. Already existing data of two thousand and seventeen consecutive patients from sub-urban areas of Chennai, who attended the outpatient department, at Ragas Dental College, for dental complaints during a period of three months in 2004, who underwent oral examination and interviewer based questionnaire was used. RESULTS: Oral soft tissue lesions were found in 4. 1 &#x 0025; of the study subjects. The <b>prevalence</b> <b>of</b> leukoplakia, OSF and oral lichen planus was 0. 59 &#x 0025;, 0. 55 &#x 0025;, and 0. 15 &#x 0025; respectively. The <b>prevalence</b> <b>of</b> smoking, drinking <b>alcoholic</b> beverages and chewing was 15. 02 &#x 0025;, 8. 78 &#x 0025; and 6. 99 &#x 0025; respectively. Smoking and chewing were significant predictors of leukoplakia in this population. DISCUSSION: The <b>prevalence</b> <b>of</b> leukoplakia, OSF and oral lichen planus in our study population is similar to those found in other populations. The <b>prevalence</b> <b>of</b> consumption <b>of</b> <b>alcoholic</b> beverages in our study population was higher when compared to the Indian National Sample Survey study. However the <b>prevalence</b> <b>of</b> smoking and chewing was found to be lower. Smokers were more likely to develop smoker&#x 2032;s melanosis compared to other lesions. Among those who consumed alcoholic beverages alone, the <b>prevalence</b> <b>of</b> leukoplakia was higher compared to other lesions. OSF was the most prevalent lesion among those who chewed panmasala or gutkha or betel quid with or without tobacco...|$|R

40|$|The rising {{consumption}} of alcohol per capita in Britain over the past 20 years has produced large increases in the <b>prevalence</b> <b>of</b> <b>alcoholic</b> cirrhosis, alcohol related violence, and heavy alcohol use, costing the British economy around £ 30 bn ($ 55 bn; {euro} 44 bn) a year. 1 About 7. 5 % of men and 2. 1 % of women in Britain are dependent on alcohol, among the highest rates in the European Union. 2 Two papers in this issue show that two relatively brief psychosocial interventions—motivational enhancement treatment and social network therapy—are effective and cost effective in treating alcohol dependence, when delivered under routine clinical conditions in the NHS. 3 4 The UK government could realise its stated aim of increasing access to effective treatments for alcohol dependence by investing in these interventions.

40|$|Background. Over {{the last}} 20 years, the {{prevalence}} of hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection in China has decreased gradually due to {{the application of a}} national HBV vaccination program. In contrast, the <b>prevalence</b> <b>of</b> <b>alcoholic</b> liver disease (ALD), nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, autoimmune liver disease, and drug-induced liver injury has markedly increased. Methods. We conducted a retrospective review of 82, 562 hospitalized patients diagnosed with liver cirrhosis in Beijing 302 Hospital from 2002 to 2013. Results. The top four etiologies of cirrhosis were HBV, HCV, ALD, and autoimmune liver disease. The percentage of HBV cirrhosis decreased from 81. 53 % in 2002 to 66. 0 % in 2013, whereas the frequency of alcoholic cirrhosis increased from 3. 34 % in 2002 to 8. 40 % in 2013. Females (84. 34 %) accounted for the majority of cirrhotic patients with autoimmune liver diseases. Males accounted for 80. 16 % of HBV cirrhosis patients and 98. 02 % of alcoholic cirrhosis patients. Conclusion.

40|$|The World Health Organization classifies alcohol as a psychoactive {{substance}} {{capable of producing}} addiction, associated to various diseases and social problems. However, it is largely consumed in the various social strata by youngster which ultimately leads to its common practice. These individuals know little about the harms posed by excessive consumption of alcoholic beverages. In this scenario, education is a major promoter of change in this longstanding social behavior. This study aimed at promoting the consolidation of the teaching of Biology by using alcohol as generative themes {{for the development of}} contents in Biochemistry, as well as elaborating a methodology that will stimulate learning about ethanol metabolism. A research was carried out with 316 individuals in the age group 13 - 19, enrolled in four public High Schools in the Municipality of Campos dos Goytacazes/RJ. <b>Prevalence</b> <b>of</b> <b>alcoholic</b> beverages was identified among 72 %, and beginning of such habit was found in the 13 - 15 age group motivated by curiosity or peer influence. Considering these data, an educational methodology was developed based on the concept of generative themes by Paulo Freire and structured by Delizoicov (2007). To verify the value of such methodology in Biochemistry classroom, data was collected by applying a questionnaire and images with texts produced by students. Several didactic resources designed by the authors were used, such as slide presentation and a roulette game named “Bioquimicados”. Critical analysis of texts written by students were carried out before and after the class using DTA. Students developed more grounded scientific concepts, making use of terms common in scientific language. This suggests that the use of the Generating Issue in a lesson based on problematization, and supported by a ludic activity, provided a meaningful contribution to improve the students' understanding of the scientific content.

40|$|Abstract: Objectives: The aim of {{the present}} study was to {{evaluate}} the <b>prevalence</b> and incidence <b>of</b> binge and at-risk alcohol consumption among new-entrant students in a public university in the South-East Region of Brazil. Methods: Longitudinal study undertaken with a random sample of undergraduates (N= 1, 168) in the first semesters of 2010 (n= 256) and 2011 (n= 183). In order to evaluate drinking patterns, participants were classified as abstainers, light, moderate, binge or heavy binge drinkers. The Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT) questionnaire score was used to define the risk categories for consumption: low risk, risk, harmful use and probable dependence. Statistical analysis was undertaken using Stata software, version 11. 0. Results: Amongst the 256 students evaluated, 51. 6 % were women and 64. 5 % were aged � 19 years. The <b>prevalence</b> <b>of</b> consumption <b>of</b> <b>alcoholic</b> beverages was 75. 8 %. The average age of onset of alcohol consumption was 15. 7  1. 9 years. The incidence of binge + heavy drinkers was 2. 6 / 100 persons per year, with vulnerability shown in individuals of male sex and of age 19 years or more. The incidence of risk level drinkers was 2. 0 / 100 persons per year and greater for individuals of male sex and younger than 19 years.

40|$|Abstract — Cultural {{differences}} in alcohol consumption are inescapable, {{but have been}} difficult to establish as predictor variables in epidemiological models. With respect to dependent variables, the behavioural outcomes of alcohol use have not been operationalized as successfully as the health outcomes. This study examined cultural {{differences in}} drinking by employing Levine's distinction between Temperance and non-Temperance cultures, along with other cultural, consumption, and policy predictor variables, among 21 Western countries. Dependent variables included the <b>prevalence</b> <b>of</b> <b>Alcoholics</b> Anonymous (AA) groups (as a measure of behavioural and social problems) and a range of alcohol consumption and health measures. Level of consumption was an important determinant of the health consequences of drinking among Western nations, but not so important in determining behavioural outcomes. Culture, on the other hand, is largely determinative of behavioural outcomes and also quite critical for some health outcomes. An inverse relationship between alcohol consumption and AA membership strongly indicated that consumption is modified by cultural styles in producing drinking behaviours. Temperance cultures, which are largely Protestant, have far more AA groups and higher rates of coronary heart disease mortality, but lower cirrhosis mortality. Overall mortality does not vary according to national alcohol consumption or cultural distinctions. The percentage of alcohol consumed as wine is a strong inverse predictor of mortality in the 55 - 64 year age group, but the change in absolute national wine consumption is directly associated with overall all-age mortality. In conclusion, religious and cultural distinctions among Western nations strongly predict behavioural drinking problems and also enhance the prediction of death rates from diseases related to alcohol consumption. Social engineering techniques which attempt to modify well-established cultural drinking practices can have counter-productive results...|$|R

40|$|A {{consecutive}} {{series of}} 352 attacks of acute pancreatitis (AP) was studied prospectively in 318 patients. AP was ascertained by contrast- enhanced CT scan {{in all but}} four cases in which diagnosis was made at operation or autopsy. Sixty-seven of these cases (19 %) had normal serum amylase levels on admission (i. e., less than 160 IU/L, a limit that includes 99 % of control values), a figure considerably higher than generally admitted. When compared to AP with elevated serum amylase, normoamylasemic pancreatitis was characterized by the following: (1) the <b>prevalence</b> <b>of</b> <b>alcoholic</b> etiology (58 % vs. 33 %, respectively, p less than 0. 01), (2) {{a greater number of}} previous attacks in alcoholic pancreatitis (0. 7 vs. 0. 4, p less than 0. 01); and (3) a longer duration of symptoms before admission (2. 4 vs. 1. 5 days, p less than 0. 005). In contrast AP did not appear to differ significantly in terms of CT findings, Ranson's score, and clinical course, when comparing normo- and hyperamylasemic patients, although there was a tendency for normoamylasemic patients to follow milder courses. Serum lipase was measured in 65 of these normoamylasemic cases and was found to be elevated in 44 (68 %), thus increasing diagnostic sensitivity from 81 % when amylase alone is used to 94 % for both enzymes. A peritoneal tab was obtained in 44 cases: amylase concentration in the first liter of dialysate was greater than 160 IU/L in 24 cases (55 %), and lipase was greater than 250 U/L in 31 cases (70 %). Twelve of these 44 cases had low peritoneal fluid and plasma concentrations for both enzymes. Thus little gain in diagnostic sensitivity was obtained when adding peritoneal values (96 %) to serum determinations. AP is not invariably associated with elevated serum amylase. Multiple factors may contribute to the absence of hyperamylasemia on admission, including a return to normal enzyme levels before hospitalization or the inability of inflamed pancreases to produce amylase. Approximately two thirds of cases with normal amylasemia were properly identified by serum lipase determinations. AP does not appear to behave differently when serum amylase is normal or elevated, and should therefore be submitted to similar therapeutic regimens in both conditions...|$|E
40|$|Also {{cited as}} vol. 11, no. 3, issue 43 BACKGROUND: Alcoholic liver disease {{is one of}} the most {{frequently}} diagnosed liver problems in the hospitalized patients in most tertiary care hospitals all over the world. The diagnosis of alcoholic liver disease is most of the time clinical. The AST/ALT ratio is a useful and reliable biochemical marker of liver injury due to alcohol. Whether the value of AST/ALT ratio correlates with clinical severity has not been studied. OBJECTIVES: To study values of AST/ALT ratio in correlation with clinical severity of illness due to alcoholic liver disease using Child-Pugh's grading. METHODS: This is a retrospective study. Inpatient records of all the patients admitted with diagnosis of alcoholic liver disease from July 2009 to 2011 June were analyzed. Data from 174 patients with the diagnosis of alcoholic liver disease-alcoholic hepatitis or alcoholic cirrhosis were retrieved; out of 174 patients, 138 were eligible for the study. The AST/ALT ratio and Child's grading of all the patients were calculated from the documented biochemical and clinical parameters on admission. Demographic profiles of all the patients were also recorded and analyzed. The data was analyzed using software SPPSS 16 version. RESULTS: A total of 138 patients diagnosed as alcoholic liver disease since July 2009 to June 2011 were analyzed. The male-female ratio was found to be 5. 34 : 1. The mean age of the patients at diagnosis was found to be 47. 58 ± 12. 83 years. Among 138 patients, Mongolians were found to have the highest <b>prevalence</b> <b>of</b> <b>alcoholic</b> liver disease (38. 8 %), followed by Newars (33. 6 %), Brahmin and Chhetri (19. 1 %) and Dalit (7. 2 %). With respect to AST/ALT ratio and Child's grading of ALD, the mean AST/ALT ratio was found to be 3. 03 ± 2. 24 in those patients who had Chlild's grade C; likewise the mean AST/ALT ratio was 2. 28 ± 1. 14, and 1. 68 ± 0. 83 in patients with Child B and Child A respectively. CONCLUSION: The higher value of AST/ALT ratio is indicative of more severe liver damage due to alcohol. Gurung RB, Purbe B, Gyawali P, Risal...|$|E

From a retrospective study of LB performed in the Hepatology liver Unit of Santa Maria Hospital, between 1989 and 1993, we correlated the histologic diagnosis with the etiology of liver disease, sex, age and the Aspartate aminotransferase/Alanine aminotransferase (AST/ALT) and Gama-Glutamyl transpeptidase (gamma GT) index in patients with chronic liver test abnormalities. 790 LB were reviewed retrospectively, of patients aged between 11 and 78 years, 68 % males and 32 % females. The most common etiology was Hepatitis C (34. 6 %), followed by Hepatitis B (20. 1 %) and alcohol (15. 8 %). Autoimmune diseases (Primary Biliary Cirrhosis and Autoimmune Hepatitis) were present in 3 % of cases, and metabolic liver diseases in 1. 4 %. The distribution by sex revealed a predominance of Hepatitis C in both, alcoholic liver disease being more frequent in males (21. 5 % vs 3. 9 %). The main histological diagnoses were Chronic Active Hepatitis (27. 2 %), Liver Cirrhosis (19. 5 %), Steatohepatitis (9. 5 %) and minor lesions (24. 6 %). In alcoholic liver disease, 47. 2 % had Liver Cirrhosis and 16 % Steatohepatitis; in Hepatitis B, Liver Cirrhosis was found in 12. 6 % and in Hepatitis C in 11. 4 %. Liver Cirrhosis had a prevalence between the 4 th and 6 th decade of life (82 %) with a peak incidence in the 5 th, and appeared earlier in Hepatitis B and later in Hepatitis C. The prevalence between sexes was similar. The main etiology of Liver Cirrhosis was alcohol (38. 3 %). The gamma GT index was greater in alcoholic liver disease (average 4. 1) and was nearly twice in Hepatitis C than in Hepatitis B (1. 7 vs 0. 8).

40|$|Abstract Background Denmark {{has one of}} {{the highest}} alcohol {{consumption}} rates in Northern Europe. The overall per capita alcohol consumption has been stable in recent decades, but surveys have indicated that consumption has decreased in the young and increased in the old. However, there is no recent information on the epidemiology <b>of</b> <b>alcoholic</b> cirrhosis. We examined time trends in incidence, prevalence, and hospitalization rates <b>of</b> <b>alcoholic</b> cirrhosis in Denmark between 1988 and 2005. Methods We used data from a nationwide population-based hospital registry to identify all Danish citizens with a hospital diagnosis <b>of</b> <b>alcoholic</b> cirrhosis. We computed standardized incidence rates, prevalence and hospitalization rates <b>of</b> <b>alcoholic</b> cirrhosis within the Danish population. We also computed the number <b>of</b> hospitalizations per <b>alcoholic</b> cirrhosis patient per year. Results From 1988 to 1993, incidence rates for men and women of any age showed no clear trend, and after a 32 percent increase in 1994, rates were stable throughout 2005. In 2001 – 2005, the incidence rates were 265 and 118 per 1, 000, 000 per year for men and women, respectively, and the prevalence rates were 1, 326 and 701 per 1, 000, 000. From 1994, incidence, prevalence, and hospitalization rates decreased for men and women younger than 45 years and increased in the older population, although the latter finding might be partly explained by changes in coding practice. Men and women born around 1960 or later had progressively lower age-specific alcoholic cirrhosis incidence rates than the generations before them. From 1996 to 2005, the number <b>of</b> hospitalizations per <b>alcoholic</b> cirrhosis patient per year increased from 1. 3 to 1. 5 for men and from 1. 1 to 1. 2 for women. Conclusion From 1988 to 2005, alcoholic cirrhosis put an increasing burden on the Danish healthcare system. However, the decreasing incidence rate in the population younger than 45 years from 1994 indicated that men and women born around 1960 or later had progressively lower incidence rates than the generations before them. Therefore, we expect the overall incidence and <b>prevalence</b> rates <b>of</b> <b>alcoholic</b> cirrhosis to decrease in the future. </p...|$|R
40|$|ObjectiveTo {{investigate}} the <b>prevalence</b> <b>of</b> <b>alcoholic</b> liver disease (ALD) among {{the staff of}} Yanchang Oilfield and related risk factors. MethodsThe physical examination {{data were collected from}} the staff of Yanchang Oilfield in June 2016, and all the staff underwent anthropometric measurement (body height, body weight, and blood pressure), laboratory examinations (routine blood test, liver function, blood lipids, blood glucose, and viral markers), and upper abdominal ultrasound and completed the questionnaire. The chi-square test was used for comparison of categorical data between groups, and logistic regression was used for multivariate analysis. ResultsA total of 6723 employees participated in the study, among whom 397 had ALD, and the prevalence rate of ALD was 5. 91 %. Compared with female staff, male staff had significantly higher drinking rate (65. 07 % vs 15. 75 %, χ 2 = 1107. 48, P＜ 0. 001) and prevalence rate of ALD (7  20 % vs 1. 11 %, χ 2 = 75. 34, P＜ 0. 001). Male population was the major group for alcohol consumption. There was {{a significant difference in the}} prevalence rate of ALD between the staff with different degrees of education (χ 2 = 86. 598, P＜ 0. 001). The obese group had a significantly higher prevalence rate of ALD than the non-obese group (17. 70 % vs 9. 27 %, χ 2 = 40. 698, P＜ 0. 001). With the increases in drinking volume and drinking years, the prevalence rate of ALD gradually increased, and there was a significant difference in the prevalence rate of ALD between the staff with different daily drinking volumes and drinking years (χ 2 = 1147. 428 and 116. 542, both P＜ 0  001). With the increase in daily drinking volume, the abnormal rates of gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase (GGT), alanine aminotransferase, and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) gradually increased (χ 2 = 250. 013, 199. 027, and 151. 459, all P＜ 0. 001); with the increase in drinking years, the abnormal rates of GGT and AST gradually increased, with a significant increase in the abnormal rate of GGT (χ 2 = 27. 158, P＜ 0. 001). There were significant differences between the drinking group and the control group in the abnormal rates of liver function, blood pressure, blood lipids, body mass index, and mean corpuscular volume (χ 2 = 51. 272, 9. 988, 316. 430, 80. 675, and 13. 570, all P＜ 0. 05). The multivariate analysis showed that age, male sex, obesity, daily drinking volume, drinking pattern, degree of education, GGT, AST, and mean corpuscular volume were closely associated with the development of ALD (all P＜ 0. 05).

40|$|Background: Significantly higher <b>prevalence</b> <b>of</b> Strongyloides stercoralis {{has been}} {{reported}} in chronic alcoholic patients. The aim of this investigation was to report the <b>prevalence</b> <b>of</b> Strongyloides larvae in stools <b>of</b> chronic <b>alcoholic</b> patients with known daily ethanol intake. Methods: From January 2001 through December 2003 the results of fecal examinations and the daily ethanol intake were retrieved from the records <b>of</b> 263 chronic <b>alcoholic</b> and from 590 non-alcoholic male patients that sought health care at the outpatients unit of the University Hospital C A Moraes. Alcoholic patients were separated into four groups, with 150 g intervals between the groups according to the daily ethanol intake. Results: (a) The frequency of Strongyloides was significantly higher in alcoholic patients than in control group (overall prevalence in alcoholic 20. 5 % versus 4. 4 % in control group; p = 0. 001). Even in the group with a daily intake of ethanol equal to or less than 150 g the prevalence was higher than in control group, although non significant (9. 5 %, versus 4. 4 % in control group; p = 0, 071); (b) the <b>prevalence</b> <b>of</b> Strongyloides in <b>alcoholic</b> patients rises with the increase of ethanol intake (Pearson’s Correlation Coefficient = 0. 956; p = 0. 022), even in patients without liver cirrhosis (Pearson’s Correlation Coefficient = 0. 927; p = 0. 037).

40|$|BACKGROUND: 					 The direct {{relationship}} between alcoholism and dermatoses has been evaluated in recent researches. However, there are few objective surveys that demonstrate and prove a {{direct relationship}} between alcohol and a specific dermatosis. 				 				 					OBJECTIVES: 					 to verify the <b>prevalence</b> <b>of</b> dermatoses in <b>alcoholics,</b> analize the dermatological changes found in these patients and their evolution during alcoholic abstinence. Also, to compare the results obtained with a non-alcoholic control group and with the data found in medical literature. 				 				 					METHODS: 					 the dermatologic conditions <b>of</b> 278 <b>alcoholic</b> patients (250 men, 28 women) were studied {{over a period of}} 4 years, and compared to those of a control group of 271 non-alcoholic individuals (249 men, 22 women), members of the Military Police Force. The individuals in both groups were between 20 and 60 years old. 				 				 					RESULTS: 					 Pellagra, nummular eczema, purpura pigmentosa chronica (also known as pigmented purpuric dermatosis) and psoriasis were more frequent in the group <b>of</b> <b>alcoholics</b> and, apparently, occurred in parallel with alcoholism that seems {{to play a role in}} the evolution of these dermatoses. The dermatopathies were more frequent before the age of forty, regardless of factors such as profession, race or gender. 				 				 					CONCLUSION: 					 the association of dermatoses and alcoholism was extremely significant according to the statistical data. Alcoholism can be considered a risk factor for pellagra, psoriasis, nummular eczema and purpura pigmentosa chronica dermatoses, which can, as well, be considered alcoholism indicators...|$|R
40|$|Background—The Dionysos Study is {{a cohort}} study <b>of</b> the <b>prevalence</b> <b>of</b> chronic liver {{disease in the}} general {{population}} of two northern Italian communities. It included 6917 subjects, aged 12 - 65 (69 % of the total population).  Aims—The aim of this part {{of the study was to}} examine the relationship of daily alcohol intake, type <b>of</b> <b>alcoholic</b> beverage consumed, and drinking patterns to the presence of alcohol induced liver damage in an open population.  Patients and methods— 6534 subjects, free of virus related chronic liver disease and participating in the first cross-sectional part of the study, were fully examined. Each subject underwent: (a) medical history and physical examination, (b) evaluation of alcohol intake using an illustrated dietary questionnaire, and (c) routine blood tests. More invasive diagnostic procedures were performed when indicated.  Results—Multivariate analysis showed that the risk threshold for developing either cirrhosis or non-cirrhotic liver damage (NCLD) was ingestion of more than 30 g alcohol per day in both sexes. Using this definition, 1349 individuals (21 % of the population studied) were at risk. Of these, only 74 (5. 5 % of the individuals at risk) showed signs of liver damage. The <b>prevalence</b> <b>of</b> "pure" <b>alcoholic</b> cirrhosis was 0. 43 % (30 of 6917), representing 2. 2 % of the individuals at risk, with a ratio of men to women of 9 : 1, while 44 (3. 3 % of the individuals at risk) showed persistent signs of NCLD. After 50 years of age, the cumulative risk of developing both NCLD and cirrhosis was significantly higher (p< 0. 0001) for those individuals who regularly drank alcohol both with and without food than for those who drank only at mealtimes.  Conclusions—Our data show that in an open population the risk threshold for developing cirrhosis and NCLD is 30 g ethanol/day, and this risk increases with increasing daily intake. Drinking alcohol outside mealtimes and drinking multiple different alcoholic beverages both increase the risk of developing alcohol induced liver damage. ...|$|R
40|$|PURPOSE: To {{determine}} the <b>prevalence</b> <b>of</b> non <b>alcoholic</b> fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and non alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) in morbidly obese patients undergoing bariatric surgery {{and to identify}} risk factors associated with the disease spectrum. METHODS: Liver biopsy was performed in 60 patients who underwent bariatric surgery, after other causes of liver disease were excluded. Clinical, biochemical and histological features were evaluated. RESULTS: NAFLD was detected in fifty-seven patients (95 %) of the sample and forty patients (66. 7 %) {{of the total sample}} met the criteria for NASH. Perisinusoidal fibrosis was only found in three (7. 5 %) patients with NASH. The &# 947;GT was an independent predictive factor associated with the degree of hepatic steatosis. The variables such as dyslipidemia and ALT were independently associated with the presence of Mallory's corpuscles with the following values, respectively, OR 0, 05, 95 % CI 0. 002 to 0. 75, P = 0. 031 and OR 10, 99, 95 % CI 1. 44 to 83. 93, P = 0. 021.

40|$|Introduction: Epidemiologic {{researches}} about {{psychoactive substance}} use have shown an up-and-coming situation to abusive {{consumption of alcohol}} in adolescent and young-adult groups. This consumption over come the knowledge about damage caused by abusive of these substances, especially for the population part {{who is in the}} “top of life experiences”; the university students. Aim: To estimate the <b>prevalence</b> <b>of</b> the <b>alcoholic</b> ingestion and alcohol abuse in university students at Jequié-BA, and to verify the association between the alcoholic ingestion and alcohol abuse with the gender, race, smoking and graduation area. Methods: Prevalence study with probabilistic randomized sample (n = 129) of a population of 3, 644 university students, registered in three universities. It was used a Questionnaire contends socio-demographic data, asking for the alcoholic ingestion and test CAGE to abuse. Results: It has been found <b>prevalence</b> <b>of</b> 63. 6 % to alcohol ingestion, 21. 7 % of high risk in abuse, and 8. 5 % of alcohol abuse. Although they have not been gotten association statistics between these variable and gender, race, graduation area and smoking; the data had demonstrated highest rates of alcohol abuse, and high risk in developing in students of masculine gender, medium brown race, who attend a graduation course in the health area. Those who have used of the tobacco had presented percentile greater of high risk in becoming alcohol consumer abusive.

40|$|Alcohol use {{disorders}} (AUDs) {{are complex}} and developing effective treatments will require the combination of novel medications and cognitive behavioral therapy approaches. Epidemiological studies have shown {{there is a high}} correlation between alcohol consumption and tobacco use, and the <b>prevalence</b> <b>of</b> smoking in <b>alcoholics</b> is as high as 80 % compared to about 30 % for the general population. Both preclinical and clinical data provide evidence that nicotine administration increases alcohol intake and nonspecific nicotinic receptor antagonists reduce alcohol-mediated behaviors. As nicotine interacts specifically with the neuronal nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) system, this suggests that nAChRs {{play an important role in}} the behavioral effects of alcohol. In this review, we discuss the importance of nAChRs for the treatment of AUDs and argue that the use of FDA approved nAChR ligands, such as varenicline and mecamylamine, approved as smoking cessation aids may prove to be valuable treatments for AUDs. We also address the importance of combining effective medications with behavioral therapy for the treatment of alcohol dependent individuals...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND: The <b>prevalence</b> <b>of</b> {{metabolic}} syndrome (MetS) in USA and Makassar are 22 % and 23. 7 %. The <b>prevalence</b> <b>of</b> Non <b>Alcoholic</b> Steatosis Hepatosis (NASH) in MetS {{has not been}} reported. Study in Non-alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD) is 25 – 90 % in obesity patients. In NASH, there is accumulation of lipid in hepatocyte (raised free fatty acid level), raised stress oxidative (decreased total antioxidant status), raised of inflammation process (decreased adiponectin) and hepatic fibrotic process (raised TGF β 1). The {{aim of this study}} is to investigate the correlation of free fatty acid, total antioxidant status, adiponectin and TGF-β 1 with the occurrence of NASH. METHODS: This was a case control study in man aged ≥ 30 years old. Metabolic syndrome (MetS) was defined by IDF categories. NASH was defined as fatty liver plus raised type IV collagen level ≥ 140 ng/ml and Alanine Transferase (ALT) level 1. 5 x upper normal limit. RESULTS: The samples consisted of 8 MetS subjects, 11 MetS subjects with fatty liver and 2 MetS subjects with suspect NASH. Low level of adiponectin and high level free fatty acid led to progression from Fatty Liver (FL) to NASH. Level of total antioxidant and Level of TGF-β 1 were relatively steady in NASH. CONCLUSIONS: The level of Free Fatty acid in subjects with MetS-FL was higher than in subjects with MetS, but was lower than in subjects with MetS-NASH. No difference in total antioxidants status level was observed among all groups. Level of adiponectin decreased in subjects with MetS-FL and MetS-NASH compared with subjects with MetS only. The level of TGF-β 1 increased in subjects with MetS-FL more than in subjects with MetS only, and was steady low in subjects with MetS-NASH.

40|$|Abstract Background Fatty {{liver disease}} is {{characterized}} by the accumulation of fat vacuoles inside of the hepatocytes. Non alcoholic fatty liver is associated with obesity, type 2 diabetes, dyslipemia, the intake of certain drugs and with the so-called metabolic syndrome. However, there is little information on the clinical relevance of this disorder as a healthcare problem in the general population, since the studies published generally include a limited number of patients and the diagnosis is established on the basis of clear biochemical alterations and liver biopsy. Methods/Design The aim of the study is the <b>prevalence</b> <b>of</b> non-alcoholic fatty liver disease in a general adult population by hepatic ultrasonography. A population-based, descriptive, transversal, multicentre study. Eighteen primary care centres of the north of Barcelona and the Maresme Areas of Healthcare Management attending an urban and semi-urban population of 360. 000 inhabitants. A randomized sample of 786 subjects of 15 years or older were selected from the population and assigned to the participating centres according to the Primary Care Information System (SIAP) : This population is practically the same as the general population of the area. The following determinations will be carried out in all the participants: hepatic ultrasonography to detect fatty liver, a questionnaire concerning liver diseases, alcohol intake, smoking and drug use, physical examination including abdominal perimeter and body mass index and biochemical analysis including liver function tests and parameters related to the metabolic syndrome and the HAIR score. Ultrasonographic diagnosis of fatty liver will be made according to established criteria (American Gastroenterology Association) and diagnosis of metabolic syndrome according to the criteria of the European Group for the Study of Insulin Resistance.
