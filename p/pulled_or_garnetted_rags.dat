50|$|The {{nomenclature}} allows up {{to a few}} {{percent of}} orthopyroxene. Accessory minerals include ilmenite, chromite, magnetite and an aluminium phase (plagioclase, spinel <b>or</b> <b>garnet).</b>|$|R
25|$|Dated early Ludlow to Wenlock. This may outcrop in Belconnen and Florey. The {{composition}} is calcareous and tuffaceous shale, sandstone, ashstone and limestone. These volcanics lack cordierite <b>or</b> <b>garnet.</b>|$|R
40|$|Rigid {{tetrahedral}} ligands are {{of particular}} interest in Metal-Organic Framework (MOF) construction due to their highly branched nature, high symmetry and also their rarity. Within this context the silicon-centred linker tetrakis(4 -tetrazolylphenyl) silane is shown to give porous networks exhibiting fluorite <b>or</b> <b>garnet</b> topology with copper(ii), manganese(ii) and cadmium(ii) metal based nodes...|$|R
50|$|The geology of Groix is {{distinct}} {{from that of the}} nearby continent, and the east and south coasts have been designated a mineral nature reserve since 1982. More than 60 minerals {{can be found on the}} island, particularly blue glaucophane (observable on the surface), epidote <b>or</b> <b>garnet.</b> The island mainly consists of schist.|$|R
5000|$|Malaia <b>garnet</b> <b>or</b> Malaya <b>garnet</b> is a gemological varietal {{name for}} light to dark {{slightly}} pinkish orange, reddish orange, <b>or</b> yellowish orange <b>garnet,</b> {{that are of}} a mixture within the pyralspite series pyrope, almandine, and spessartine with a little calcium. The name Malaia is translated from Swahili to mean, [...] "one without a family". It is found in east Africa, in the Umba Valley bordering Tanzania and Kenya.|$|R
50|$|Endergonic {{reactions}} can {{be achieved}} if they are either <b>pulled</b> <b>or</b> pushed by an exergonic (stability increasing, negative change in free energy) process. Of course, in all cases the net reaction of the total system (the reaction under study plus the <b>puller</b> <b>or</b> pusher reaction) is exergonic.|$|R
60|$|The gray clouds {{became a}} long, low swathe of ruby red, <b>or</b> <b>garnet</b> red--such as one sees {{in a glass}} of heavy {{burgundy}} when held to the light. There was such depth to this red! And, below it, separated from the main colour-mass by a line of gray-white fog, or line of sea, was another and smaller streak of ruddy-coloured wine.|$|R

40|$|Two {{species were}} newly identifi ed in Japan. Lachnum lanariceps was {{characterized}} by a central and cylindrical stipe and hairs containing pale yellow pigment with red <b>or</b> <b>garnet</b> resinous matter. Lachnum oncospermatum was identifi ed after comparison with the holotype of Dasyscyphus oncospermatis. This fungus has the characteristics of wrinkled apothecium and branched stipe.

5000|$|Unsportsmanlike conduct (15 yards) {{penalties}} will {{be called}} on players who <b>pull</b> <b>or</b> yank opponents off piles (ex. fumbles).|$|R
5000|$|Tirando: <b>Pulling</b> <b>or</b> {{plucking}} {{the strings}}'ordinary' plucking of the strings with index, middle and ring fingers when playing falsetas.|$|R
2500|$|... recursive: This is {{the default}} when <b>pulling</b> <b>or</b> merging one branch, {{and is a}} variant of the {{three-way}} merge algorithm.|$|R
5000|$|An {{intermediate}} use is {{to harness}} animals, singly or in teams, to <b>pull</b> (<b>or</b> haul) sleds, wheeled vehicles or plough.|$|R
5000|$|Eclogite that {{is brought}} to shallow {{conditions}} is unstable, and retrograde metamorphism often occurs: secondary amphibole and plagioclase may form reaction rims on the primary pyroxene <b>or</b> <b>garnet,</b> and titanite may form rims about rutile. Eclogite may completely retrogress to amphibolite or granulite during exhumation. In some retrogressed eclogites and accompanying more silica-rich rocks, UHP (ultrahigh-pressure) metamorphism has been recognized {{only because of the}} preservation of coesite and/or diamond inclusions within trace minerals such as zircon and titanite.|$|R
50|$|Conventional deadlift: The deadlift can {{be broken}} down into three parts: The setup, the initial <b>pull</b> <b>or</b> drive, and the lockout.|$|R
30|$|The {{performance}} of V-shaped structure is the best, and the {{performance of}} X-shaped structure is the worst under <b>pulling</b> <b>or</b> pressure force.|$|R

25|$|Among the {{earliest}} known jade artifacts excavated from prehistoric sites are simple ornaments with bead, button, and tubular shapes. Additionally, jade was used for adze heads, knives, and other weapons, which can be delicately shaped. As metal-working technologies became available, the beauty of jade made it valuable for ornaments and decorative objects. Jadeite measures between 6.0 and 7.0 Mohs hardness, and nephrite between 6.0 and 6.5, {{so it can be}} worked with quartz <b>or</b> <b>garnet</b> sand, and polished with bamboo or even ground jade.|$|R

5000|$|A typical 90 degree {{bellcrank}} {{consists of}} an [...] "L" [...] shaped crank pivoted where the two arms of the L meet. Moving rods (or cables or ropes) {{are attached to the}} ends of the L arms. When one is pulled, the L rotates around the pivot point, pulling on the other arm. A typical 180 degree bellcrank consists of a straight bar pivoted in the center. When one arm is <b>pulled</b> <b>or</b> pushed, the bar rotates around the pivot point, <b>pulling</b> <b>or</b> pushing on the other arm.|$|R
