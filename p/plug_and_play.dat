A recent review article found that careful system design would enable such systems to meet all technical, though not all safety requirements. There are several companies selling <b>plug</b> <b>and</b> <b>play</b> solar systems available on the web, but there is a concern that if people install their own it will reduce the enormous employment advantage solar has over fossil fuels.|$|E
5|$|Initial {{development}} on WoA took place by porting code from Windows 7; Windows Mobile smartphones {{were used to}} test early builds of WoA {{because of lack of}} readily available ARM-based tablets. Later testing was performed using a custom-designed array of rack-mounted ARM-based systems. Changes to the Windows codebase were made to optimize the OS for the internal hardware of ARM devices, but a number of technical standards traditionally used by x86 systems are also used. WoA devices would use UEFI firmware, and have a software-based Trusted Platform Module to support device encryption and UEFI Secure Boot. ACPI is also used to detect and control <b>plug</b> <b>and</b> <b>play</b> devices and provide power management outside the SoC. To enable wider hardware support, peripherals such as human interface devices, storage and other components that use USB and I²C connections use class drivers and standardized protocols. Windows Update serves as the mechanism for updating all system drivers, software, and firmware.|$|E

40|$|Distributed {{multimedia}} {{applications such}} as Video-On-Demand (VOD) will need user-friendly graphical interfaces to specify and control compressed continuous media and their service behavior according to the quality perceived by the human user.

40|$|Sensor {{networks}} are promising in many applications; however, {{we have not}} yet seen its wide acceptance and deployment. We envision that a big obstacle to solving this dilemma is the lack of an easily usable tool for applications scientists to manage and use sensor networks. In this paper, we take an initial step to tackle this problem by developing a general tool to fill the gap between applications and sensor network protocols, which would also pave the way for the wide acceptance and deployment of sensor networks. Our approach includes two components: a general network programming interface abstracted from common usage patterns, and a transparent query to interface converter which will ease the burden on application scientists significantly. Using this automatic converter, application scientists need to use a high level SQL-like language for <b>plugging</b> <b>and</b> <b>playing</b> wireless sensor network operations. These two components will be integrated and implemented into a general query processing tool called QueryAgent. This tool also maps efficient sensor network protocols to different requirements of end-users in an intelligent way. ...|$|R

25|$|Windows Vista aims {{to simplify}} the detection, configuration, and {{installation}} of external displays and projectors by introducing a standardized setup procedure and interface. The WDDM architecture in Windows Vista enables hot plug detection of external displays and alerts the new Transient Multimon Manager (TMM) when an external display is connected to a system, which then presents an Aero Wizard interface for the configuration and setup of the display. In previous versions of Windows, installation routines for displays often varied based on hardware configurations such as function keys and specific manufacturer requirements, and typically required separate software interfaces. When possible, the TMM also saves user preferences for individual displays to improve mobility scenarios as these preferences can then be restored when a display is reconnected at a different time or location. The aforementioned improvements are intended to enable a display connectivity experience that provides the ease of use observed with <b>plug</b> <b>and</b> <b>play</b> peripherals.|$|E

40|$|Model transformations play a {{key role}} in the vision of Model-Driven Engineering. Thereby, the {{resolution}} of structural heterogeneities between metamodels (MMs) represents the key challenge. For this task, current approaches require the definition of partly tricky, low-level recurring transforma-tion logic but neglect to offer reusable components. More-over, little attention has been paid to heterogeneities caused by the concept of inheritance, although extensively used in MMs. Therefore, we propose to specify model trans-formations in a <b>plug</b> & <b>and</b> <b>play</b> manner by a set of pre-defined mapping operators (MOps) representing a DSL to resolve structural heterogeneities. For coping with inheri-tance in MMs, we introduce an inheritance mechanism be-tween MOps allowing to reuse parts of the mapping def-initions. Moreover, dedicated MOps for resolving hetero-geneities when one MM comprises inheritance hierarchies whereas the other one does not are presented, which are well-known problems in object-relational transformations and ob-ject-oriented refactorings...|$|R
