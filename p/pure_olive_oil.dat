25|$|Antiochus's actions {{provoked}} a large-scale revolt. Mattathias (Mattityahu), a Jewish priest, and his five sons Jochanan, Simeon, Eleazar, Jonathan, and Judah led a rebellion against Antiochus. It started with Mattathias killing first, a Jew {{who wanted to}} comply with Antiochus's order to sacrifice to Zeus, and then a Greek official who was to enforce the government's behest (1 Mac. 2, 24-25). Judah became known as Yehuda HaMakabi ("Judah the Hammer"). By 166 BC Mattathias had died, and Judah took his place as leader. By 165 BC the Jewish revolt against the Seleucid monarchy was successful. The Temple was liberated and rededicated. The festival of Hanukkah was instituted to celebrate this event. Judah ordered the Temple to be cleansed, a new altar {{to be built in}} place of the polluted one and new holy vessels to be made. According to the Talmud, unadulterated and undefiled <b>pure</b> <b>olive</b> <b>oil</b> with the seal of the kohen gadol (high priest) was needed for the menorah in the Temple, which was required to burn throughout the night every night. The story goes that one flask was found with only enough oil to burn for one day, yet it burned for eight days, the time needed to prepare a fresh supply of kosher oil for the menorah. An eight-day festival was declared by the Jewish sages to commemorate this miracle.|$|E

2500|$|The solemn form of Eastern Christian anointing {{requires}} {{the ministry of}} seven priests. A table is prepared, upon which is set a vessel containing wheat. Into the wheat has been placed an empty shrine-lamp, seven candles, and seven anointing brushes. Candles are distributed for all to hold during the service. The rite begins with reading Psalm 50 (the great penitential psalm), followed by the chanting of a special canon. After this, the senior priest (or bishop) pours <b>pure</b> <b>olive</b> <b>oil</b> and {{a small amount of}} wine into the shrine lamp, and says the [...] "Prayer of the Oil", which calls upon God to [...] "...sanctify this Oil, that it may be effectual for those who shall be anointed therewith, unto healing, and unto relief from every passion, every malady of the flesh and of the spirit, and every ill..." [...] Then follow seven series of epistles, gospels, long prayers, Ektenias (litanies) and anointings. Each series is served by one of the seven priests in turn. The afflicted one is anointed with {{the sign of the cross}} on seven places: the forehead, the nostrils, the cheeks, the lips, the breast, the palms of both hands, and the back of the hands. After the last anointing, the Gospel Book is opened and placed with the writing down upon the head of the one who was anointed, and the senior priest reads the [...] "Prayer of the Gospel". At the end, the anointed kisses the Gospel, the Cross and the right hands of the priests, receiving their blessing.|$|E

In this study, non-thermal plasma (NTP) is investigated as an innovative preparative analytical technique enabling classification of adulterated <b>olive</b> <b>oil</b> from an ascertained authentic batch of <b>olive</b> <b>oil</b> in a more sensitive manner. Non-thermal plasma discharges are a source of highly oxidative species such as singlet oxygen, and atomic oxygen. It was assumed that NTP-induced oxidation triggers unique lipid oxidation mechanisms depending on the specific composition of the oil matrix and minor constituents. In this work EVOO samples were adulterated with sunflower oil (1 – 3 %) and submitted to NTP treatment. Results showed that while untreated samples could not be classified from the authentic <b>olive</b> <b>oil</b> reference, NTP treatments of 60 min (Ar/O 2 0. 1 %) on the oil batches resulted in the formation of a unique set of secondary volatile lipid oxidation products enabling classification of adulterated oil samples. status: accepte...|$|R

Brooklyn: Mesorah Publications, 2003[...] The Mishnah taught that there were three harvests of olives, and each crop gave three kinds of oil (for a total of nine types of oil). The first crop of olives were picked {{from the top of the}} tree; they were pounded and put into a basket (Rabbi Judah said around the inside of the basket) to yield the first oil. The olives were then pressed beneath a beam (Rabbi Judah said with stones) to yield the second oil. The olives were then ground and pressed again to yield the third oil. Only the first oil was fit for the Menorah, while the second and third were for meal-offerings. The second crop is when the olives at roof-level were picked from the tree; they were pounded and put into the basket (Rabbi Judah said around the inside of the basket) to yield the first oil (of the second crop). The olives were then pressed with the beam (Rabbi Judah said with stones) to yield the second oil (of the second crop). The olives were then ground and pressed again to yield the third oil. Once again, with the second crop, only the first oil was fit for the Menorah, while the second and third were for meal-offerings. The third crop was when the last olives of the tree were packed in a vat until they became overripe. These olives were then taken up and dried on the roof and then pounded and put into the basket (Rabbi Judah said around the inside of the basket) to yield the first oil. The olives were next pressed with the beam (Rabbi Judah said with stones) to yield the second oil. And then they were ground and pressed again to yield the third oil.

40|$|A {{systematic}} {{investigation of}} the concentration dependence of the 13 C NMR spectra of <b>pure</b> triglycerides from <b>olive</b> <b>oils</b> was performed. It was found that (i) the chemical shift of each carbon of a given fatty acid is independent {{of the nature of}} the other two fatty acids in the triglyceride; (ii) in each fatty acid residue the chemical shifts of some carbons depend on the acyl positional distribution in the triglyceride; and (iii) the chemical shifts show a marked concentration dependence. These properties are ascribed to the lack of any specific intramolecular interactions. They are analytically favorable, as they allow the tabulation of chemical shifts as a function of concentration for any fatty acid in any position, regardless of the composition of the triglyceride to which they belong. These shifts may therefore be used for the systematic characterization of edible oil...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT Essential oil {{of plants}} called Juniperus excelsa Bieb. (JE), Origanum minutiflorum O. Schwarz and P. H. Davis (OM) {{were used in}} this study. In order to {{determine}} experimental doses, LD 50 values of essential oils were determined on mice. Taking into consideration the LD 30 range, the experimental toxic doses were calculated for each rat (rat/kg). The toxic dosages thus determined were adapted to rats for active substances (rat/kg). Using commercially available <b>pure</b> virgin <b>olive</b> <b>oil</b> (VOO) as the solvent and diluting agent, OM oil (n= 10), JE fruitoil (n= 10), carvacrol (CRV) (n= 10), VOO (n= 10) and normal saline SF (n= 8) were administered {{on the basis of}} 12 days into intraperitoneal (IP). Enzyme activities of Glucose- 6 -Phosphate dehydrogenase (G 6 PDH), malate dehydrogenase (MDH), Superoxide Dismutase (SOD), Glutathione-S-transferase (GST), Adenosine-deaminase (ADA) and Catalase were studied in isolates of kidney, brain and liver tissues. The data was statistically analyzed through Kruskal Wallis variance analysis. Elevated levels of GST and catalase have been found statistically important, as have both essential oil activities of OM and JE in the kidney tissue (p< 0. 005). All of the enzymes except the levels of ADA and SOD led to a statistically significant change in the brain and liver. There was sinusoidal hyperemia and capsular adhesion in the liver as histopathological were found to be statistically significant (p< 0. 005).
