40|$|Defect {{detection}} is a {{major concern}} in quality control of various products in industries. This paper presents two different machine-vision based methods for detecting defects on periodically patterned textures. In the first method, input defective image is split into several blocks of size same as the size of the periodic unit of the image and chi-square histogram distances of each <b>periodic</b> <b>block</b> with respect to itself and all other <b>periodic</b> <b>blocks</b> are calculated to get a dissimilarity matrix. This dissimilarity matrix is subjected to Ward's hierarchical clustering to automatically identify defective and defect-free blocks. The second method of defect detection is based on Universal Quality Index which is a measure of loss of correlation, luminance distortion and contrast distortion between any two signals. Quality indices of a <b>periodic</b> <b>block</b> with respect to itself and all other <b>periodic</b> <b>blocks</b> are calculated to get a similarity matrix containing quality indices. Specific variances of the <b>periodic</b> <b>blocks</b> are derived from the quality index matrix through orthogonal factor model based on eigen decomposition. These variances are subjected to Ward's hierarchical clustering to automatically identify defective and defect-free blocks. Results of experiments on real fabric images with defects show that the defect detection methods based on chi-square histogram distance and universal quality index yield a success rate of 98. 6 % and 97. 8 % respectively...|$|R
30|$|According to {{the results}} we {{presented}} for {{the case of a}} silicon dislocation, the adaptiveness of the <b>periodic</b> <b>block</b> matching copes fairly well with localized irregularities in the crystal structure. Nevertheless, the proposed <b>periodic</b> <b>block</b> matching is generally limited to the assumption of a perfectly periodic crystal, which is usually of less interest to material scientists than crystals with (possibly multiple) defects or changes in the lattice orientation. Thus, we plan to improve and properly extend the block-matching strategy to these more complex geometries.|$|R
40|$|In this paper, {{we propose}} a new machine vision {{algorithm}} for automatic defect detection on patterned textures {{with the help}} of texture-periodicity and the Jensen- Shannon Divergence, which is a symmetrized and smoothed version of the Kullback-Leibler Divergence. Input defective images are split into several blocks of {{the same size as the}} size of the periodic unit of the image. Based on histograms of the <b>periodic</b> <b>blocks,</b> Jensen-Shannon Divergence measures are calculated for each <b>periodic</b> <b>block</b> with respect to itself and all other <b>periodic</b> <b>blocks</b> and a dissimilarity matrix is obtained. This dissimilarity matrix is utilized to get a matrix of true-metrics, which is later subjected toWard's hierarchical clustering to automatical ly identify defective and defect-free blocks. Results from experiments on real fabric images belonging to 3 major wallpaper groups, namely, pmm, p 2, and p 4 m with defects, show that the proposed method is robust in finding fabric defects with a very high success rates without any human interventio...|$|R
40|$|Similarity {{measures}} {{are widely used}} in various applications such as information retrieval, image and object recognition, text retrieval, and web data search. In this paper, we propose similarity–based methods for defect detection on patterned textures using five different similarity measures, viz., normalised histogram intersection coefficient, Bhattacharyya coefficient, Pearson product–moment correlation coefficient, Jaccard coefficient and cosine–angle coefficient. <b>Periodic</b> <b>blocks</b> are extracted from each input defective image and similarity matrix is obtained based on the similarity coefficient of histogram of each <b>periodic</b> <b>block</b> with respect to itself and all other <b>periodic</b> <b>blocks.</b> Each similarity matrix is transformed into dissimilarity matrix containing true–distance metrics and Ward's hierarchical clustering is performed to discern between defective and defect–free blocks. Performance of the proposed method is evaluated for each similarity measure based on precision, recall and accuracy for various real fabric images with defects such as broken end, hole, thin bar, thick bar, netting multiple, knot, and missing pic...|$|R
30|$|The {{proposed}} algorithm for steering {{the spatial}} distribution of block estimates towards global uniformity achieves a significant improvement over the periodic block-matching BM 3 D for certain images. However, we also observed cases where the results are slightly worse compared to the <b>periodic</b> <b>block</b> matching without this addition. Note that our uniform adaptive periodic block-matching BM 3 D is still significantly better than the original BM 3 D in all cases. Nevertheless, we plan to further investigate this phenomenon. The goal {{is to find a}} strategy that will at least sustain the quality of the estimate compared to plain <b>periodic</b> <b>block</b> matching while improving it in the majority of the cases.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{electric field}} measurements {{in the underground}} water horizon that have been processed by a specialised model installation which receives and records electric signals. From the description and the technical characteristics of the installation, it results that the origin of changes of the recorded electric field is owed to a natural process that concerns the interior of our planet. External {{factors such as the}} Ionosphere and human activity do not interfere with the measurements of this particular installation. The presentation of the measurements is dominated by a <b>permanent</b> <b>periodic</b> variation of the electric field with a constant period of about 24 hours. The basic periodic variation of the electric component, which is recorded and examined here, is modulated by pulses of variable amplitude and duration, accidentally distributed in time. The possible generating mechanism of pulses is also under examination in this paper. The result of spectrum analysis of the initial recordings shows a high peak which is identified with the equivalent maximum of the two main mechanical tidal components that are described in the bibliography. It is under examination whether the measured changes are related or emanating from the tidal deformity of the ground. Other available measurements of the components of the Earth’s magnetic field (included in the measurements carried out by special scientific projects in Greece and around the world) show the existence of a <b>permanent</b> <b>periodic</b> variation with a constant period of about 24 hours. The time comparison between the variations of the vertical component of the Earth’s magnetic field and the measured variations of the electric field reveals a phase shift of 90 degrees. Taking into consideration the above statement, we may infer that the periodic variation of the measured electric signal is the electric component of an electromagnetic wave. It appears that this electromagnetic wave is caused by the tidal deformity of the Earth. This paper proposes a theoretical model that can justify the nature and the mechanism of genesis of that electromagnetic wave, including other electromagnetic waves emanating from the Earth’s periodic tidal deformit...|$|R

30|$|The {{paper is}} {{organized}} as follows. First, we briefly recall the original BM 3 D algorithm. Then, we present two strategies for Poisson noise removal, namely variance stabilization {{based on the}} Anscombe transform and using Poisson maximum-likelihood similarity measures due to Deledalle et al. [27] for the block matching. The main contribution is an adaptive non-local <b>periodic</b> <b>block</b> matching. It exploits the repetitive structure within the micrograph while keeping the computational cost affordable. Since the spatial distribution of the resulting block estimates is highly non-uniform, potentially resulting in a poor reconstruction in regions with few available block estimates, we discuss possible remedies of this deficiency. Finally, we evaluate the proposed method on simulated data, where the ground truth, i.e., the true, noise-free mean electron count per pixel, is available, showing the improvement {{both in terms of}} visual image quality and in quantitative measures such as peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR), precision, and fidelity achieved by the proposed method.|$|R

In addition to the familiar parametric instability of individual oscillators, two kinds of collective instabilities are identified.

Motivated by the fact that texture discrimination by human vision system is based on second-order statistics, we make use of histogram of gray-level co-occurrence matrix (GLCM) that is based on second-order statistics and propose a new machine vision algorithm for automatic defect detection on patterned textures. Input defective images are split into several <b>periodic</b> <b>blocks</b> and GLCMs are computed after quantizing the gray levels from 0 - 255 to 0 - 63 to keep the size of GLCM compact and to reduce computation time.

We have obtained a general relationship for the double nonequilibrium capillary pressure which represents great interest for applications. Due to the nonlinear coupling and the nonlocality in time, the macroscopic model remains incompletely homogenized in general case. The completely homogenized model was obtained for two different regimes. The first case corresponds to a linearized flow in the blocks.
