40|$|AbstractRapid {{industrialisation}} {{and resulting}} industrial solid waste from {{power plants and}} integrated iron and steel industries, have imposed an enormous environmental pressure on water resources of Chhattisgarh, a state in Central India. Rural population living nearby the study area is mainly depended on the available surface water {{in the form of}} lakes or pond in their vicinity. Therefore it is necessary to look after the surface water through leachate <b>pollution</b> caused <b>by</b> <b>dumping</b> and disposal of industrial solid waste. In the present study, ten surface water samples each for pre monsoon and post monsoon were collected for analysis from the surrounding areas of a major industrial region of Chhattisgarh. The AAS analysis of the surface water samples shows higher concentration of certain heavy metals above the permissible limits. In the pre monsoon samples the metals Mn and Cr resulted higher concentration {{and at the same time}} metals; Cu, Fe and Pb resulted in lower concentrations. Similarly, for the post monsoon samples, Mn, Cr and Fe found with higher concentration, while Cu and Pb resulted with lower concentration. The high amount of heavy metals were found in the analyzed samples shows that there is a real risk for population living in the nearby areas of the industrial region of Chhattisgarh. Therefore a huge amount of industrial wastes produced needs a proper disposal. Unscientific and poorly-managed disposal of industrial solid wastes containing heavy metals needs remediation before discharging into the environment...|$|R

40|$|The most {{effective}} {{solution to the}} growing e-waste problem is to recycle raw materials from end-of-life electronics. Most electronic devices contain a range of materials, including metals that can be recovered for future uses. By dismantling and providing reuse possibilities, intact natural resources are conserved and air and water <b>pollution</b> caused <b>by</b> hazardous <b>dumping</b> is avoided. Objectives of our study were to understand the various issues of e-waste management in the hospital settings and ways of e- waste disposal. Discussion: The hospitals visited by us have not considered {{the environmental impact of}} electronic waste, let alone come to terms with how they will dispose of their electronic trash. All the hospitals in the city can have agreement with one organization to collect their e-waste which should pay these hospitals for the e-waste and process it by sorting without melting. Recycling reduces the amount of greenhouse gas emissions caused by the manufacturing of new products. It simply makes good judgment and is competent to recycle and to do our part to keep the environment green. Conclusion: With this study, we make a genuine effort to have hospitals free from e-waste, thereby leading to less carbon footprints...|$|R

40|$|High cost {{of cement}} used as binder in the {{production}} of concrete has led to a search for alternative. Using a mix design ratio of 1 : 2 : 4 and water binder ratio of 0. 63, concrete cubes were casted using varying ordinary Portland cement (OPC) : palm kernel shell ash (PKSA) and ordinary Portland cement (OPC) : coconut shell ash (CSA) ratios of 100 : 0, 90 : 10, 80 : 20, 70 : 30, 60 : 40 and 50 : 50 respectively. This research reveal that partial replacement of cement with 20 % PKSA and CSA in concrete gives an average optimum compressive strength of 15. 4 N/mm 2 and 17. 26 N/mm 2 respectively at 28 days. While, the optimum value of compressive strength obtained at 28 days is 20. 58 N/mm 2 at 10 % replacement with CSA. The value obtained is suitable for both light weight and heavy weight concrete respectively. Thus, the research show that the use of PKSA and CSA as a partial replacement for cement in concrete, at lower volume of replacement, will enhance the reduction of cement usage in concretes, thereby reducing the production cost and the environmental <b>pollution</b> caused <b>by</b> the <b>dumping</b> of the agricultural waste...|$|R

The enomerous amount of mine waste dumped around the regions of mining activity need to be reused constructively. Hence, if the mine waste is studied for its use as a reinforced soil, then burning issue of environmental <b>pollution</b> caused <b>by</b> mining <b>dumps</b> lying unprotected and unstabilized can be tackled to a certain extent. Also, {{it will be a}} step towards finding an alternative material for cohesionless soil in reinforced soil construction. In this study an attempt is made to check the suitability of soil from one of the mining dumps in Goa to be used as reinforced soil. The mine waste soil samples are studied for its compressive strength and shear strength behaviour by conducting two types of tests, unconfined compressive strength test and triaxial tests on unreinforced and reinforced soil samples. The reinforcement used {{in the form of a}} grid made from natural material bamboo. The bamboo grid reinforcement is placed in one, two and three layers, for studying the effect of reinforcement on compressive strength, shear strength parameters, stiffness and modes of failure of mining waste soil. The results of the tests on mining waste show improvement in strength as a reinforced soil mass.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} the accumulation of metallic elements and the control effect of marine <b>pollution</b> caused <b>by</b> ocean <b>dumping</b> in the sediments at a waste disposal area in the Yellow Sea. In July 2009, concentrations of organic matter and metallic elements (Al, Fe, As, Cd, Cr, Co, Hg, Ni, Mn, Pb, and Zn) were measured in surface sediments at the site. The ignition loss (IL) in the surface sediments showed a mean value of 15. 4 %, about 1. 5 times higher than the mean value of the sediments in the coastal areas of Korea. The chemical oxygen demand (COD) at some disposal sites exceeded 20 ㎎ O 2 /g·dry, which signifies the initial concentration of marine sediment pollutants in Japan. The disposal sites contain higher concentrations of Cr, Cu and Zn than the sediments of bays and estuaries that might be contaminated. The magnitude of both metal enrichment factors (EF) and adverse biological effects suggest that pollution with Cr and Ni occurred due to the dumping of waste in the study area. In addition, the geoaccumulation index (Igeo) showed that the surface sediments were moderately contaminated. By the mid- 2000 s, when the amount of waste dumped at this site was the highest, the concentration of metallic elements was higher than ever recorded.
