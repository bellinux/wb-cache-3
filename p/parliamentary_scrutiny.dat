The Agency is accountable to and controlled by the Justice and Home Affairs Council. Together with the European Parliament, the Council approves Europol’s budget and regulations related to its work. The Council forwards an annual special report to the European Parliament {{on the work of}} the Agency—and the Parliament also discharges Europol from its responsibility for managing a set budget.

25|$|During the 20th century, {{a belief}} arose that some extra {{protection}} of human rights above and beyond <b>parliamentary</b> <b>scrutiny</b> was necessary. Doubts grew about the capacity of parliamentary controls, partly because of scepticism about Parliament's will to control the growing executive and the control by political parties of their MPs which allowed weak governments to avoid effective challenges. This scepticism went {{hand in hand with}} criticisms of the United Kingdom's political system and whether it is sufficiently representative of the range of opinion in the country. The doubts intensified with the experiences with terrorism in the 1970s and accession to the European Community in 1973 where Britain was exposed to other legal systems which did not share the same concept of parliamentary sovereignty and which gave stronger protection to human rights. In particular, European entry led to the notion that the Parliament of the United Kingdom could be subject to the decisions of a higher legal order {{in the form of the}} European Court of Justice. This was highlighted in the Factortame litigation where the House of Lords was required to 'disapply' provisions of an Act of Parliament which were contrary to European Community law, effectively ruling them invalid. In addition, increasingly influenced by international human rights law, comparative constitutional law and European law, English courts became more sympathetic towards the concept of popular sovereignty and fundamental rights and liberties.|$|E

40|$|Cormac Mac Amhlaigh {{contends that}} {{political}} constitutionalists {{are committed to}} the view that disagreement goes “all the way down,” and that this is self-defeating. As a result, they have no basis for arguing for the superiority of political over legal processes. Drawing on Bernard Williams’s account of realism, this article argues that political constitutionalism merely insists that politics goes all the way down, because any juridical order must first provide an answer to what Williams called “the first political question” by offering a stable and reliable form of political authority. Moreover, any satisfactory response to this question must meet what Williams termed the “Basic Legitimation Demand” by offering a process that acknowledges the need to frame such authority in a non coercive or authoritarian manner by recognizing the disagreements and conflicts that give rise to the necessity for politics in the first place. Because politics goes all the way down, the authority and legitimacy of even “legal constitutionalist” mechanisms must be political and processual rather than moral. However, judged by these criteria more conventional political mechanisms, such as competitive party elections and the <b>parliamentary</b> debate and <b>scrutiny</b> of legislation, have certain advantages to which political constitutionalists have drawn attention. Therefore, Mac Amhlaigh’s critique proves mistaken because it misunderstands and so misrepresents the political constitutionalist argument and fails to address its main claims...|$|R

2500|$|Criticism slowly mounted: {{when the}} Whigs {{introduced}} a Poor Law Amendment Bill in 1841 {{to extend the}} Commission's life, MPs complained of the pettiness {{of some of the}} rules called for by the Poor Law Commission (e.g. workhouse inmates to take their meals in silence), of the refusal of the Commissioners to allow Boards of Guardians much discretion, and of the way the Commission had evaded <b>Parliamentary</b> <b>scrutiny.</b> A general election occurred before the Bill was passed, and the Conservatives came to power, with some of their MPs stating that they owed their seats to the opposition they had professed to the New Poor-law; the government, however, came forward with a Bill to extend the Commission to 1847, and to make minor amendments to the Poor Law. [...] Whilst there continued to be cross-party Front Bench support for the New Poor Law (in 1844 in Coningsby, Benjamin Disraeli mocked Peel's 'sound Conservative government' as 'Tory men and Whig measures') Conservative malcontents such as Disraeli were alive to the consequent opportunity to undermine Peel by allying themselves with the opposition to unpopular Whig measures. [...] The Bill made very slow progress (opponents made lengthy speeches; Fielden repeatedly moved adjournment of the debate), and many clauses were dropped in order to secure its passage before the existing authorisation of the Commission lapsed. [...] The previous proceedings of the Poor Law Commission were not endorsed unequivocably : ("My Lords, I don't mean to say that I approve of every act that has been done in carrying this bill into operation. I think that in many cases those who had charge of the working of the bill have gone too far") it was now stressed that the virtue of the Commission was that it supported diversity, rather than that it was necessary to achieve uniformity; administratively 'special rules' were to be as far as possible consolidated into general rules laid before Parliament. A further Poor Law Amendment Act was passed in 1844; its main effect was to again revise the treatment of unmarried mothers: in Committee stage many amendments seeking to relax the poor law regime were rebuffed by the Home Secretary on the argument that - correctly understood - the existing rules and regulations of the Poor Law Commission already permitted the relaxation sought.|$|E
40|$|The EU’s {{foreign and}} {{security}} policy is often criticised for being undemocratic. In this article, this contention is addressed {{from the perspective}} of deliberative democracy. The focus is on the procedural qualities of the second pillar decision-making processes as {{it is not only the}} quality of the outcomes that determine the democratic legitimacy of policy-making, but also the way that decisions have come about. Against five criteria, the EU’s second pillar procedure is assessed for its putative lack of democratic qualities. The analysis shows that not only does the second pillar lack parliamentary input, but the procedural set-up also violates basic democratic principles. There is no democratic deliberative forum to which citizens have access and where decision-makers must justify their positions. There is a serious absence of democratically elected participants to counter the vast number of bureaucrats, and the level of secrecy through which decisions are made is almost absolute. Furthermore, there is no separation of powers due to the fact that the same working groups prepare the second pillar items for both the Council and European Council, allowing the two bodies to lead an almost symbiotic coexistence.

5000|$|The Tudor {{historian}} David Starkey {{describes this}} system, and Denys's role in it, as follows:In 1493 Henry VII had broken with tradition {{and set up}} a new department of the Royal Household. Historically there were 2 of these, the Lord Steward's dept. which provided food and drink, and the Lord Chamberlain's which dealt with both ceremony and the King's personal service. To these Henry added a third: the secret or Privy Chamber. This took over responsibility for the King's body service. It was also used, as its name indicates, to enforce a much more rigorous separation between the King's public and private lives. The establishment of the secret chamber greatly expanded the Groom's importance and his portfolio. Denys became the head officer of the new department. He controlled access to the King and assumed responsibility for the King's everyday necessities. Denys became the King's personal treasurer, running an account that later became known as the Privy Purse. In the last few years of Henry's reign, avarice was erected into a policy and the result was a reign of terror. The means employed were two financial instruments known as bonds and recognisances, which are agreements with penalty clauses for non-compliance. Individuals were fined for offences real or imaginary, forced pay part immediateley and to enter into bonds to pay the balance the terms imposed were broken. He was therefore at the King's mercy. The arrangements were assessed and enforced by a sub-committee of the King's Council called the Council Learned in the Law, headed by Edmund Dudley, with Sir Richard Empson as a powerful member. In the Autumn of 1508, Denys moved centre stage as the King recovered from a serious illness and decided on a wholesale extension of his policy of fiscal terrorism. Henry decided to cast his net wider than just the elite, and created the post of Surveyor of the King's Prerogative, charged with the rigorous and universal enforcement of the King's rights as head of the feudal system. Local commissioners were appointed under Edward Belknap to enforce the policy on a county by county basis. All the elements of an alternative system of taxation were in place, permanent, nation-wide and exempt from either <b>parliamentary</b> authority or <b>scrutiny.</b> The terms of Belknap's appointment are silent on what became of his profits, but it soon became clear they were to be paid over directly to Denys as a kind of private royal slush fund. Where they were paid is interesting, some at Greenwich Palace, but some at the private royal residences of Wanstead (of which Denys was the official keeper) and Hanworth. The last recording of such a paying-over of [...] "fines assessed by the King's highness" [...] was that paid by Belknap to Denys at Hanworth in February 1509, at which date the account book breaks off, incompleteIt is clear that Denys re-invested these funds in real-estate as a bare trustee for the King, using a group of feoffees many of whom were close to the King. That is to say the King must have had absolute confidence in him that he would not misappropriate the funds, for as a bare trustee no written agreement would have existed.|$|R

40|$|An {{upcoming}} audit finds {{strengths and}} deficits in Australian federalism, writes Marian Sawer AUSTRALIA {{is one of}} the world’s oldest continuing democracies and certainly the first to create itself through the democratic mechanism of the referendum. The compatibility of federalism and democracy, however, is a question that has never been resolved and that has taken on new dimensions in an era of shared decision-making rather than divided responsibilities. This relationship is closely examined in the forthcoming capstone volume of the Democratic Audit of Australia. The audit framework, developed by International IDEA in Stockholm, uses indicators derived from democratic principles to assess both formal and informal political institutions. In the Australian context these underlying principles are expressed as political equality, popular control of government, civil liberties and human rights and the quality of public debate or deliberation. If we start with the key democratic principle of political equality, federalism causes immediate difficulties. The negotiation of federal compacts typically provides guarantees of political representation that contradict the principle of one vote one value. The smaller component units are characteristically over-represented, {{as is the case in}} Australia. In 2007, a Tasmanian Senate vote was worth almost 13 times a NSW Senate vote. In principle, this prevents government from ignoring the interests of the smaller federal units. In practice, party loyalties generally trump territorial representation. One way in which federalism can uphold the principle of equal citizenship across constituent units of varying resources is through the principle of fiscal equalisation. In Australia the implementation of this principle is the responsibility of the Grants Commission. It is intended to ensure that all citizens are able to receive services at the same level and for the same tax rates, regardless of where they live. It takes into account both the differing capacity of the states to raise revenue and the differing costs of providing services – given geography, the age structure of the population and the proportion from “non-English speaking background. ” A different way that federalism can uphold the principle of equal citizenship is through providing more opportunities for popular participation in government and opportunities that are “closer to home. ” In A Federal Republic Brian Galligan describes as “dual citizenship” the fact that citizens can participate in more than one government and suggests that the smaller scale of the subnational units promotes citizen engagement. The idea that federalism multiplies the possibilities for political participation is an attractive one but tends to overlook the role of local government. This is often weaker in federal systems than in unitary systems of government and was ignored in the constitutions of the older federations. In Australia, the position of local government is particularly weak compared to a unitary democracy such as Norway. Turning to the second principle, that of popular control over government, one of the advertised virtues of federalism, from its American origins in the eighteenth century, has been the way it tames democracy rather than encourages it, creating a defence against overbearing majorities. Supporters of federalism often emphasise the way in which divided sovereignty ensures limited government by creating competing centres of power. Of course, the frustration of popular majorities may not necessarily result in smaller government. Public choice theorists argue that each of the multiple and competing centres of public authority within federal systems has a tendency to continuous expansion. The beneficial effects of the Australian Senate in ensuring parliamentary control over executive government have sometimes been attributed to federalism but can be shown to be the consequence of other factors. Strong bicameralism is not a necessary corollary of federalism (think of Canada with its appointed Senate). It is strong bicameralism in conjunction with the adoption of proportional representation that has made the Australian Senate into an effective house of legislative review and executive scrutiny. Rather than strengthening parliamentary control, we shall see that the intergovernmental institutions of federalism may result in an increased amount of decision-making taking place well away from parliamentary oversight. Linked to the argument about how federalism limits government has been an argument that it serves to protect the liberties of individuals. As federalism expert Gwendolyn Gray has pointed out, little empirical evidence has been presented for this claim, or indeed for many of the claims made in the name of federalism. Reformers seeking to increase protection for individual rights or the rights of minorities have often come up against the stumbling block of “states’ rights” — as in the long campaign for a Commonwealth power in relation to Aboriginal affairs. Protection of civil rights in Australia currently varies considerably between jurisdictions, with rights such as the freedom of speech and assembly more secure in jurisdictions with a charter of rights (such as the ACT and Victoria) than in NSW, where last year the government attempted to remove the right of peaceful protest during World Youth Day celebrations. Ideally such pluralism might act to raise standards across all jurisdictions, with the best setting benchmarks for others to follow but there is no assurance this will happen. Political scientists like Andrew Parkin have argued that federalism does provide scope for policy to be more responsive to local needs and preferences and to facilitate policy experimentation and innovation. This is a stronger argument for federalism than many others and there is evidence of successful dissemination of policy experiments that have originated in one jurisdiction (often South Australia). Less convincingly, it has been suggested that federalism offers citizens the right of choice and exit, enabling them to compare political offerings and to move from one jurisdiction to another in pursuit of better services or public goods. The accelerating drift of power from the States and Territories towards the Commonwealth in recent years has led commentators to question the future of federalism itself. Responsibilities that once belonged to the States become shared ones as the Commonwealth exerts its financial power. In an era of global markets, inconsistencies in policy or regulation between jurisdictions are subject to increased criticism for undermining Australian competitiveness. The strengthened co-ordinating role of the Council of Australian Governments (COAG) has addressed such issues, but also contributes to increased levels of shared decision-making across all portfolio areas. As Constitutional lawyer Cheryl Saunders has observed, there are now literally hundreds of intergovernmental agreements in Australia and no routine arrangements for their parliamentary oversight. Decision-making shared between different governments makes it difficult for citizens to determine where responsibility lies and who to hold to account. There is an accountability gap in relation to both parliament and the broader public. This brings us to our final democratic principle, the quality of public deliberation. The “behind closed doors” character of the intergovernmental decision-making pre-empts proper processes of community consultation and may also pre-empt proper parliamentary deliberation, as nine governments present their respective parliaments with already agreed-upon template legislation. Federalism is here serving to multiply the strengths of executive government vis à vis parliament. The nature of executive federalism is exemplified by the competition policy agreements of the 1990 s, largely unaccompanied by any public deliberative processes, whether at the parliamentary or community levels, and certainly lacking gender impact analysis, despite their implications for the female-dominated community sector. Moreover, the values of transparency and open government, currently a priority of Special Minister of State Senator Faulkner, have never been part of intergovernmental processes. In the words of Martin Painter, ministerial councils tend to be “notoriously opaque and hard to access for the public, with conventions and secrecy and bureaucratic habits of confidentiality dominant most of the time. ” The protocols now governing the ministerial councils ensure such confidentiality and, like COAG, they often simply issue press releases with brief reports of decisions. One jurisdiction that attempted to address such democratic deficits was the ACT. Under the Administrative (Interstate Agreements) Act 1997 ministers were required to consult with Legislative Assembly committees when they were about to enter into an interstate agreement. While this Act was repealed in 2005, the House of Representatives Legal and Constitutional Affairs Committee has taken up the baton, recommending in both 2006 and 2008 that all draft intergovernmental agreements be referred to a <b>parliamentary</b> committee for <b>scrutiny</b> and report. It appears anomalous that while intergovernmental agreements at the international level are now subjected to scrutiny by the Joint Standing Committee on Treaties, the same scrutiny is not applied to intergovernmental agreements within Australia. Overall, how democratic is the Australian federal system? The Australian Audit has found democratic strengths in the areas of policy innovation, political participation, potential for regional responsiveness and fiscal equalisation. It has found deficits in the lack of transparency in intergovernmental decision-making, the limited scope for community consultation and parliamentary deliberation and the accountability issues arising from shared decision-making, blame-shifting and voter confusion. Perhaps it is time for the Rudd government to respond to that House of Representatives report tabled nine months ago. • Marian Sawer is an Adjunct Professor in the School of Social Sciences ANU and Director of the Democratic Audit–ANU, and co-author of the forthcoming book, Australia: The State of Democracy (Federation Press, 2009).
