5|$|Daenerys and her {{remaining}} followers build {{a funeral}} pyre for Drogo. Daenerys <b>places</b> <b>her</b> dragon eggs atop the pyre, and she orders Ser Jorah to tie Mirri to it. Having {{set fire to}} the pyre, Daenerys declares herself queen of a new khalasar, freeing those who would remain with her. Despite Jorah's worries, Daenerys then steps into the pyre. By daybreak, Jorah and the khalasar are surprised to find her unharmed in the ashes, carrying three dragon hatchlings. Amazed, they bow to Daenerys as one of the hatchlings clambers onto her shoulder and a dragon's screech is heard {{for the first time in}} centuries.|$|E
5|$|English doctor Maxwell (Shearsmith) {{settles into}} bunk 9E while {{travelling}} from Paris to Bourg-Saint-Maurice. Maxwell is disturbed first by Jorg (Pemberton), a drunk, flatulent German who climbs into bunk 9D, then by Kath (Hesmondhalgh) and Les (Benton), a couple travelling to their daughter's wedding. Jorg is in Les's bed, but the couple climb into 9A. Australian backpacker Shona (Gunning) enters; she <b>places</b> <b>her</b> bag on bunk 9C then leaves, and Maxwell closes the door. Kath and Les, laughing at Maxwell, begin to undress on the bed. Les wakes Jorg, but understanding is limited until Maxwell translates. Jorg switches to 9F and Les climbs into 9D.|$|E

5|$|In the Uttara Kanda {{book of the}} Ramayana (regarded by most {{scholars}} as a later addition to the epic), Brahma crafts Ahalya as {{the most beautiful woman}} and <b>places</b> <b>her</b> in the care of Gautama until she reaches puberty. When that time arrives, the sage returns Ahalya to Brahma, who, impressed by Gautama's sexual restraint and asceticism, bestows her upon him. Indra, who believes that the best women are meant for him, resents Ahalya's marriage to the forest-dwelling ascetic.|$|E
5|$|In the ocean, Varaha {{encounters}} Hiranyaksha, who obstructs {{his path}} and challenges {{him to a}} duel. In some versions, the demon also mocks Varaha as the beast and warns him not to touch earth. Ignoring the demon's threats, Varaha lifts the earth on his tusks. Hiranyaksha charges towards the boar in rage with a mace. The two fiercely fight with maces. Finally, Varaha slays the demon after a thousand-year duel. Varaha rises from the ocean with the earth in his tusks and <b>places</b> <b>her</b> gently above it in her original position, as the gods and the sages sing Varaha's praises.|$|E
5|$|Several {{historians have}} {{attempted}} to establish the dates of Kanhopatra's life and death. One estimate <b>places</b> <b>her</b> life circa 1428 CE by relating her to a Bahamani king of Bidar who {{is often associated with}} the Kanhopatra story—although in most accounts, that king is never explicitly named. Pawar estimates that she died in 1480. Others suggest dates of 1448, 1468 or 1470, or simply say that she lived in the 15th century—or in rare instances, the 13th or 16th century. According to Zelliot, she was a contemporary of saint-poets Chokhamela (14th century) and Namadeva (c.1270-c.1350).|$|E

5|$|Several {{women in}} Carnivàle {{are tied to}} Avatars, but only two have Avataric blood: Belyakov's {{daughter}} Iris is a Vectorus by definition, and Justin's daughter Sofie is the Omega. Although Sofie is {{two years older than}} Ben, her father's Avataric generation <b>places</b> <b>her</b> in the next Avataric generation. The other affected women are human mothers who began to suffer from mental illness or strange behavior after giving birth to an Avatar. Ben's mother Flora was a religious fanatic who would not touch her son. Scudder's mother Emma cut her eyes out and killed several of her family members the night Scudder was born. Sofie's mother Apollonia became catatonic after Sofie's birth. Justin's and his older sister Iris's mother receives no special mention in the series, but the Pitch Document mentions her chronic paranoid schizophrenia after Justin's birth. As far as known, none of these mothers became pregnant after giving birth to an Avatar.|$|E
5|$|The song's video {{features}} close-up {{shots of}} Beyoncé and incorporates psychedelic light effects and symmetrical filming photography. As the acoustic guitar begins playing, Beyoncé's face comes into view. She stands with {{her blond hair}} draped just below her exposed shoulders. As she intently stares into the camera, her skin glistens as though it has been coated with a honey-like and glittery substance. Turning her head from right to left, with her eyes fixed off-camera, Beyoncé starts belting out the first verse. As the chorus is reached, scenes of Beyoncé in a darkened room are shown. Additionally, she <b>places</b> <b>her</b> face delicately against dripping water, gently brushing it with her lips and palms. The scenery changes and Beyoncé {{is back in the}} darkened chamber, where she removes her dress.|$|E
5|$|Brother Justin Crowe is the {{antagonist}} in Carnivàle; reviewers {{also saw}} {{in him a}} possible alternate protagonist. Brother Justin is introduced as a Methodist minister who resides with his sister Iris {{in the small town}} of Mintern, California. As the series reveals in later episodes, Justin's birth name is Alexei Belyakov. He and his sister Iris are orphaned immigrant children in the wilderness, who were found and raised by Reverend Norman Balthus. Following strange visions and supernatural abilities in the pilot episode, Brother Justin erects a church in his God's name. But after a fire in his new ministry leads him almost to suicide, Brother Justin is hospitalized in a sanatarium and discovers his ability to manipulate and control those around him through sheer force of will. Shortly after Brother Justin's return to Mintern, Norman suspects his foster son to be possessed by a demon and confronts him, but Brother Justin is not disturbed by his true nature for long. In the beginning of season 2, Brother Justin has begun to gather a huge flock of worshippers of mostly migrants and Okies outside Mintern via his nightly radio sermons and newfound abilities of persuasion. A scholar named Wilfred Talbot Smith identifies him as the Usher and tells him that, in order to gain his full measure of power and fulfill his destiny, he must find and kill a man named Henry Scudder. While escaped convict Varlyn Stroud helps Brother Justin, the Crowes find a new chambermaid in ex-carny Sofie, not knowing that she is Brother Justin's daughter. Brother Justin at long last meets his adversary, Ben, in the final episode of the series. Brother Justin is killed in a battle in a cornfield near his home, but Sofie as the Omega arrives and <b>places</b> <b>her</b> hands on his chest, causing the corn stalks around them to wither and fall away.|$|E

In several dioceses of France it was observed as a Holy Day of Obligation up {{to the beginning of}} the 17th century, the splendour of its ceremonial eclipsing that of the feasts of some of the Apostles. Numberless chapels were placed under her patronage and her statue was found in nearly all churches, representing her according to medieval iconography with a wheel, her instrument of torture.|$|E
25|$|The mimicry of egg-spots is {{utilized}} by males for the fertilization process. Mouthbrooding females lay eggs and immediately snatch {{them up with}} their mouths. Over millions of years, male cichlids have evolved egg-spots to initiate the fertilization process more efficiently. When the females are snatching up the eggs into their mouth, the males gyrate their anal fins, which illuminates the egg-spots on his tail. Afterwards, the female, believing these are her eggs, <b>places</b> <b>her</b> mouth to the anal fin (specifically the genital papilla) of the male, which is when he discharges sperm into her mouth and fertilizes the eggs.|$|E

Whitson's cumulative EVA time is 60 hours, 21 minutes, which <b>places</b> <b>her</b> in 3rd place for total EVA time. She is also the oldest female astronaut ever in space, at age 57.|$|E
25|$|An aging legacy-huntress named Philomela <b>places</b> <b>her</b> son and {{daughter}} with Eumolpus, ostensibly for education. Eumolpus makes love to the daughter, although because of his pretence of ill health he requires the help of Corax. Encolpius reveals that he has somehow been cured of his impotence (140). He warns Eumolpus that, because the wealth {{he claims to have}} has not appeared, the patience of the legacy-hunters is running out. Eumolpus's will is read to the legacy-hunters, who apparently now believe he is dead, and they learn they can inherit only if they consume his body. In the final passage preserved, historical examples of cannibalism are cited (141).|$|E
25|$|Meanwhile, in Orléans, the English army {{is laying}} siege to Charles' forces. Inside the city, the Bastard of Orléans {{approaches}} Charles {{and tells him}} {{of a young woman}} who claims to have seen visions and knows how to defeat the English. Charles summons the woman, Joan la Pucelle, (i.e. Joan of Arc). To test her resolve, he challenges her to single combat. Upon her victory, he immediately <b>places</b> <b>her</b> in command of the army. Outside the city, the newly arrived Bedford negotiates the release of Talbot, but immediately, Joan launches an attack. The French forces win, forcing the English back, but Talbot and Bedford engineer a sneak attack on the city, and gain a foothold within the walls, causing the French leaders to flee.|$|E

It is revealed early on that Skade is a Conjoiner woman who appears {{to be in touch with}} secret circles of control within the theoretically egalitarian Conjoiners society. In the ship, she discovers Galiana, the original founder of the Conjoiners, who left Conjoiner space decades previously on an exploration mission. In space, she encountered the Inhibitors, who have unleashed an agent into her ships which has taken control of it and killed her crew. It now controls her mind as well. Galiana requests that Skade kill her, but Skade only <b>places</b> <b>her</b> in suspended animation in the hope that she can be helped in the future.|$|E
25|$|On Sonny and Brenda's wedding day, Sam {{got caught}} in an {{explosion}} meant for Brenda. Jason stayed by Sam's side when she was dealing with temporary hearing loss, even communicating in sign language to express his love. Jason decides to propose to Sam soon afterwards during a romantic dinner on the roof, and Sam accepts. Overwhelmed by the wedding planning, {{the two of them}} decide to drive off on Jason's motorcycle. They end up at a Chinese restaurant, where the owner happens to be an ordained minister. Jason and Sam get married in the restaurant's garden. They leave for their honeymoon to Hawaii, where Franco drugs them both, locks Jason in a room, and makes him watch while he takes Sam to the bedroom and <b>places</b> <b>her</b> in bed, before turning off the camera. When Jason comes back to Sam, both of them come to believe Franco raped Sam.|$|E
25|$|In the German tale , Guinevere's brother Gotegrim kidnaps her and {{intends to}} kill her for refusing to marry Gasozein, who claims to be her {{rightful}} husband. In Ulrich von Zatzikhoven's , Valerin, King of the Tangled Wood, claims the right to marry her and carries her off to his castle in a struggle for power that reminds scholars of her prescient connections to the fertility and sovereignty of Britain. Arthur's company saves her, but Valerin kidnaps her again and <b>places</b> <b>her</b> in a magical sleep inside another castle surrounded by snakes, where only the powerful sorcerer Malduc can rescue her. All of these similar tales of abduction by another suitor – and this allegory includes Lancelot, who whisks her away when she is condemned to burn at the stake for their adultery – are demonstrative of a recurring Hades-snatches-Persephone theme, positing that Guinevere {{is similar to the}} Otherworld bride Étaín, who Midir, king of the Underworld, carries off from her earthly life after she has forgotten her past.|$|E
