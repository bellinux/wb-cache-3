40|$|U. S Prison {{health care}} has {{recently}} {{been in the news}} and in the courts. A particular issue is whether prisons should contract out for health care. Contracting out has been growing over the past few decades. The stated motivation for this change ranges from a desire to improve the prison health care system, sometimes in response to a court mandate, to a desire to reduce costs. This study is a first attempt to quantify the impact of this change on inmate health. As morbidity measures are not readily obtainable, we focus on mortality. More specifically, we use a panel of state prisons from 1979 - 1990 and a fixed effects Poisson model to estimate the change in mortality associated with increases in the percentage of medical <b>personnel</b> <b>employed</b> under contract. In contrast to the first stated aim of contracting, we find that a 20 percent increase in percentage of medical <b>personnel</b> <b>employed</b> under contract increases mortality by 2 percent...|$|R
