5|$|The Westerlies or the Prevailing Westerlies are the {{prevailing}} winds {{in the middle}} latitudes between 35 and 65degrees latitude. These prevailing winds blow from the west to the east, and steer extratropical cyclones in this general manner. The winds are predominantly from the southwest in the Northern Hemisphere and from the northwest in the Southern Hemisphere. They are strongest in the winter when the pressure is lower over the poles, and weakest {{during the summer and}} when <b>pressures</b> <b>are</b> higher over the poles.|$|E
5|$|The {{composition}} of the clouds varies with depth and increasing pressure. In the upper cloud layers, with {{the temperature in the}} range 100–160K and pressures extending between 0.5–2 bar, the clouds consist of ammonia ice. Water ice clouds begin at a level where the pressure is about 2.5 bar and extend down to 9.5 bar, where temperatures range from 185–270K. Intermixed in this layer is a band of ammonium hydrosulfide ice, lying in the pressure range 3–6 bar with temperatures of 190–235K. Finally, the lower layers, where <b>pressures</b> <b>are</b> between 10–20 bar and temperatures are 270–330K, contains a region of water droplets with ammonia in aqueous solution.|$|E
50|$|Pitot <b>pressure</b> <b>is</b> the <b>pressure</b> that <b>is</b> {{measured}} by a Pitot tube, an open-ended tube connected to a pressure-measuring device. For subsonic flow, pitot <b>pressure</b> <b>is</b> equal to the stagnation pressure (or total pressure) of the flow, and hence the term pitot <b>pressure</b> <b>is</b> often used interchangeably with these other terms. For supersonic flow, however, pitot <b>pressure</b> <b>is</b> the stagnation <b>pressure</b> of the flow behind the normal shock ahead of the pitot tube. Pitot <b>pressure</b> <b>is</b> named for Henri Pitot, French scientist.|$|R

5000|$|The Bernoulli {{equation}} {{applicable to}} incompressible flow {{shows that the}} stagnation <b>pressure</b> <b>is</b> equal to the dynamic pressure plus static <b>pressure.</b> Total <b>pressure</b> <b>is</b> also equal to dynamic pressure plus static pressure so, in incompressible flows, stagnation <b>pressure</b> <b>is</b> equal to total pressure.

5|$|Without seismic data or {{knowledge}} of its moment of inertia, little direct {{information is available}} about the internal structure and geochemistry of Venus. The similarity in size and density between Venus and Earth suggests they share a similar internal structure: a core, mantle, and crust. Like that of Earth, the Venusian core is at least partially liquid because the two planets have been cooling {{at about the same}} rate. The slightly smaller size of Venus means <b>pressures</b> <b>are</b> 24% lower in its deep interior than Earth's. The principal difference between the two planets is the lack of evidence for plate tectonics on Venus, possibly because its crust is too strong to subduct without water to make it less viscous. This results in reduced heat loss from the planet, preventing it from cooling and providing a likely explanation for its lack of an internally generated magnetic field.|$|E

When the capillary <b>pressure</b> <b>is</b> included in the simulation the total oil production is considerably lower than when the capillary <b>pressure</b> <b>is</b> neglected. Experimentally measured two-phase capillary <b>pressure</b> <b>was</b> used as input to the numerical simulator.

A network model was applied to generate a consistent set of two-phase and three-phase capillary pressure.

The gas-oil and mercury capillary pressure anchored the pore structure parameters, while water-oil capillary pressure anchors the wettability parameters in the network model.

In order to create the X-ray pictures, a physician guides a small tube-like device called a catheter, typically ~2.0mm (6-French) in diameter, through the large arteries of the body until the tip is just within the opening of one of the coronary arteries. By design, the catheter is smaller than the lumen of the artery it is placed in; internal/intraarterial blood <b>pressures</b> <b>are</b> monitored through the catheter to verify that the catheter does not block blood flow.|$|E
30|$|However, {{when the}} {{difference}} (skeleton pressure) between the overburden pressure and fluid pressure (pore <b>pressure,</b> formation <b>pressure)</b> <b>is</b> decreased, the elastic {{parameters of the}} skeleton decrease and their corresponding velocities are decreased as well.
