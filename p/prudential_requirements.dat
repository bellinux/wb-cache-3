40|$|This paper raises {{questions}} about the consistency of the Z-score, which is the most applied accounting-based measure of bank risk. In spite of its main advantage, namely the concept of risk on which it relies, the traditional formula is precisely inconsistent with this concept. The Z-score is deduced from the probability that bank’s losses exceed its capital, but under the very unrealistic assumption of normally distributed returns on assets. Consequently, we propose a structural approach to determine this bank risk measure. It consists to define the default event when banks’ profit is lower than a default threshold level, which is based on the balance-sheet structure of banks and on new <b>prudential</b> regulation <b>requirements...</b>|$|R
40|$|Universities {{that own}} patents have a problem. While nearly all are keen {{to enhance their}} revenue {{generated}} from patents, few are eager or prepared to enforce them in court, alone or with their exclusive licensees, should a third party deploy a product or process covered by a university-owned patent. Yet strict <b>prudential</b> standing <b>requirements</b> imposed by the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit (“CAFC”) effectively require university participation as plaintiffs in enforcement lawsuits over their exclusively licensed patents, regardless of a university’s effective ability or enthusiasm {{to participate in a}} given action. Supported by forty years of lawsuit data and original survey and interview data collected from high-level administrators at universities that litigate patents, this Article explores in depth the complicated legal and policy tensions presented by university participation as plaintiffs in patent infringement litigation. I offer two proposals for alleviating these tensions. The first proposal urges universities to move toward a coherent position on patent ownership and enforcement, particularly in light of recent trends in higher education finance. The second proposal outlines a potential legislative amendment to the Patent Act that would allow universities to enjoy the revenue-generation aspect of patent ownership while freeing them from the legal compulsion to participate as co-plaintiffs with their exclusive licensees in enforcement actions. This novel tweaking of the CAFC’s <b>prudential</b> standing <b>requirement</b> would save universities untold time and money that they currently spend pursuing litigation. By permitting universities to focus more on innovation and less on litigation, this proposal also would better align societal expectations for university commercialization efforts with the public interest...|$|R

40|$|The Supreme Court {{has clearly}} treated the Constitution’s Article III {{standing}} requirements as mandatory jurisdictional hurdles that a plaintiff must meet for each form of relief sought before federal courts may consider {{the merits of}} a case. But the Supreme Court has never squarely held that prudential standing is a jurisdictional issue that must be decided before the merits in every single case. A 1975 Supreme Court decision suggested in dicta that prudential standing doctrine {{plays a crucial role}} in preventing federal courts from addressing political questions, but a 1984 Court decision implied in dicta that prudential standing is less important than Article III constitutional standing. In light of the Court’s conflicting dicta about the importance of prudential standing doctrine, {{it is not surprising that}} lower federal courts have split over whether <b>prudential</b> standing <b>requirements</b> are jurisdictional or whether such barriers may be waived if a party fails to raise the issue. Recently, in Grocery Manufacturers Association v. EPA, a three-judge panel of the D. C. Circuit divided over this issue. Chief Judge David Sentelle in his opinion for the Court held that the petitioners met neither constitutional Article III nor <b>prudential</b> standing <b>requirements.</b> Judge David Tatel’s concurring opinion concluded that the food producers had constitutional standing to bring their claims, but that <b>prudential</b> standing <b>requirements</b> barred jurisdiction. He personally agreed with those circuits that have held that prudential standing is non-jurisdictional, but concluded that he was bound by the D. C. Circuit’s precedent holding that prudential standing is jurisdictional. By contrast, Judge Brett Kavanaugh’s dissenting opinion reasoned that prudential standing is not a jurisdictional issue because recent Supreme Court decisions had narrowed the scope of which questions are jurisdictional in nature, although these decisions had not specifically addressed the issue of prudential standing. This Article generally agrees with Judges Kavanaugh and Tatel that prudential standing should not be treated as a jurisdictional issue. The greatest weakness of Judge Kavanaugh’s opinion is that he did not thoroughly address why the Court has sought to narrow the range of jurisdictional issues. This article examines the adversarial traditions that underlie the Anglo-American legal system. It explains that Judge Kavanaugh’s argument for limiting the scope of jurisdictional rules would have been more convincing if he had also pointed out that sua sponte jurisdictional decisions by judges are generally contrary to the Anglo-American legal system’s party-controlled adversarial model of legal decision-making. The Court’s best explanation for making a sharp distinction between jurisdictional and non-jurisdictional rules is that “[b]randing a rule as going to a court’s subject-matter jurisdiction alters the normal operation of our adversarial system. ” Prudential standing is not so closely entwined with Article III jurisdiction to require an exception to our adversarial traditions of party autonomy in a free society...|$|R
