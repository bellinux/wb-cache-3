5|$|Bertin bequeathed the {{portrait}} {{to his daughter}} Louise (1805–77) on his death. She passed it to her niece Marie-Louise-Sophie Bertin (1836–93) wife of Jules Bapst, a later director of the Journal des débats. They bequeathed it to their niece Cécile Bapst, its last <b>private</b> <b>owner.</b> In 1897 Cécile sold it to the Musée du Louvre for 80,000 francs.|$|E
5|$|In 1935, {{the house}} was {{purchased}} from the Cope family by Ronald Nall-Cain, 2nd Baron Brocket, the house's last <b>private</b> <b>owner.</b> It {{was used by the}} Red Cross as a maternity home during the Second World War, after which it became the home of the exiled King Michael and Queen Anne of Romania for several years.|$|E
40|$|The {{elements}} manganese, cobalt, nickel, copper, zinc, arsenic, selenium, molybdenum, cadmium, antimony, thallium, {{lead and}} mercury, and selected persistent organochlorine compounds (dioxins, marker and dioxin-like polychlorinated biphenyls, dichlorodiphenyltricholroethane (DDT) and metabolites {{as well as}} other chlorinated pesticides) were analysed in Belgian free-range eggs obtained from hens of <b>private</b> <b>owners</b> and of commercial farms. It was found that eggs from <b>private</b> <b>owners</b> were more contaminated than eggs from commercial farms. The ratios of levels in eggs from <b>private</b> <b>owners</b> to the levels in eggs from commercial farms ranged from 2 to 8 for the toxic contaminants lead, mercury, thallium, dioxins, polychlorinated biphenyls and the group of DDT. DDT contamination was marked by the substantial presence of p,p 0 -DDT in eggs from <b>private</b> <b>owners</b> in addition to dichlorodiphenyldichloroethylene (p,p-DDE) and dichlorodiphenyl-dichloroethane (p,p 0 -DDD). It is postulated that environmental pollution is at the origin of the higher contamination of eggs from <b>private</b> <b>owners.</b> Extensive consumption of eggs from <b>private</b> <b>owners</b> is likely to result in toxic equivalent quantity intake levels exceeding the tolerable weekly intake...|$|R

5|$|In 1928, Verville left Buhl-Verville to {{establish}} the Verville Aircraft Company, also in Detroit. The company sought to market planes to the wealthy <b>private</b> <b>owner.</b> Verville Aircraft produced the Verville Air Coach, a four-passenger, high-wing monoplane, which made its debut at the 1929 Detroit Air Show and the Verville Sport Trainer, a two-seat tandem biplane. The United States Army Air Corps purchased 4 Sport Trainers under the designation YPT-10. The USAAC tested with 5 different engine versions resulting in YPT-10 thru YPT-10D designations.|$|E
5|$|Johann Christian Götze (1692–1749), German theologian and {{director}} of the Royal Library at Dresden, purchased the codex from a <b>private</b> <b>owner</b> in Vienna in 1739 while traveling to Italy. Thompson speculates that the codex was sent as a tribute to Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor by Hernán Cortés, governor of Mexico, since examples of local writings and other Maya items were sent to the king in 1519 when he was living in Vienna.|$|E
5|$|After many years, {{the site}} was finally cleared of {{undergrowth}} in the 1850s, revealing more of the castle's remains, and William Wynne, {{the owner of the}} site, carried out the first archaeological investigations. In 1949 Charles Corbett, the last <b>private</b> <b>owner</b> of the ruins, placed them into the guardianship of the state. In the 21st century the site is in the care of Cadw and is protected as a scheduled monument and maintained as a tourist attraction. In the light of Welsh devolution and other political changes, the history of Castell y Bere and similar Welsh castles has become increasingly prominent. In response, Cadw have noted that they intend to give an increased priority to communicating the history of these castles and the Welsh princes.|$|E

5|$|Issues {{surrounding}} {{the planning and}} construction of L'Enfant Plaza (immediately {{to the west of}} the site) delayed construction of any buildings on the block until the late 1960s. In 1963, the RLA purchased the land from the Westminster Memorial Church, Fifth Baptist Church, and homeowners. The United States Department of Health, Education and Welfare wished to purchase the site for its new headquarters, but the RLA declined to sell the property. (The federal government does not pay taxes on land and structures it owns, and the RLA wanted a <b>private</b> <b>owner</b> who would add to the tax base.) The RLA attempted to sell the land on January 29, 1965, but there were no buyers.|$|E
5|$|Pevensey Castle {{remained}} {{abandoned and}} crumbling {{from the end}} of the 16th century to the first quarter of the 20th. It was nearly demolished during the period of the English Commonwealth in the 17th century when Oliver Cromwell's Parliamentary Commissioners sold it for £40 to a builder, John Warr of Westminster, who planned to quarry it for its stones. Very little work took place, however, and the Crown reacquired the castle in 1660. It was restored to the possession of the Pelham family, until in 1730 the Duke of Newcastle resigned it to Spencer Compton, 1st Earl of Wilmington. It was subsequently acquired by the House of Cavendish. In 1925 its last <b>private</b> <b>owner,</b> the 9th Duke of Devonshire, gave the castle to the state as a historic monument and it underwent repairs and some reconstruction under the supervision of the Ministry of Works.|$|E
5|$|William Moreton III used what {{is today}} {{known as the}} Exhibition Room as a bedroom in the mid-17th century; it is entered through a doorway from the {{adjoining}} Withdrawing Room. Following William's death in 1654 his children Ann, Jane and Philip divided the house into three separate living areas. Ann, whose accommodation was in the Prayer Room above, then used the Exhibition Room as a kitchen. The adjoining Chapel, begun in 1508, is accessible by a doorway from the courtyard. The Chapel contains Renaissance-style tempera painting, thought to date from the late 16th century. Subjects include passages from the Bible. The chancel was probably a later addition dating from the mid-16th century. It is separated from the nave by an oak screen and projects eastwards from the main plan of the house, with a much higher ceiling. The stained glass in the east wall of the chancel is a 20th-century addition installed by Charles Abraham, the last <b>private</b> <b>owner</b> of Little Moreton Hall, as a parting gift on his transfer of ownership to the National Trust.|$|E
