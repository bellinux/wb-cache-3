40|$|Abstract—Reaction time (RT) {{tests are}} known as simple and {{sensitive}} cognitive tests. A drawback of existing RT tests is that they require the full attention of a test person which prohibits the measurement of cognitive functioning during daily routine tasks. In this contribution we present our first steps in designing and evaluating <b>reaction</b> <b>time</b> tests which can be operated throughout everyday life by means of wearable devices. In a feasibility study we induce changes in <b>reaction</b> <b>times</b> by applying cognitive load in 5 test subjects. We compare the obtained wearable <b>reaction</b> <b>times</b> with desktop-based <b>reaction</b> <b>time</b> tests. We show that relative changes in the mean duration and the variability of <b>reaction</b> <b>times</b> are similar for both desktop-based and wearable <b>reaction</b> <b>time</b> test. We conclude that wearable <b>reaction</b> <b>time</b> tests seems feasible to measure changes in <b>reaction</b> <b>times</b> and hence would allow the measurement of cognitive functioning throughout everyday life.

40|$|Purpose. The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to determine the level and rate of change of <b>reaction</b> <b>time</b> during the developmental period from early childhood to early adulthood. Polynomial regression analysis was applied to determine the age at which the best <b>reaction</b> <b>time</b> results are achieved. Methods. The study involved 550 females between the ages of 7 and 20 years. Participants completed a computer test measuring simple <b>reaction</b> <b>times</b> to visual and auditory stimuli and choice <b>reaction</b> <b>time</b> during the ontogenetic developmental period. Results. Analysis of the results for age group distinguished two sub-periods of <b>reaction</b> <b>time</b> dynamics: a progressive increase throughout the developmental period followed by a plateau phase. This was evident for all <b>reaction</b> <b>time</b> measures (simple and choice) particularly in the case of that data collected empirically. Conclusions. best <b>reaction</b> <b>times</b> to visual and auditory stimuli were approximately at the age of 17 years. In turn, quickest choice <b>reaction</b> <b>time</b> was approximately one year earlier in life. The most dynamic increase in the results of both simple <b>reaction</b> <b>times</b> was between the age of 7 and 8 years, whereas for choice <b>reaction</b> <b>time</b> this was between 10 and 11 years of age...|$|R

There {{is a need for}} an easy-to-use program that can run <b>reaction</b> <b>time</b> tasks and anticipation skills with no special experiments.

Therefore, {{the aim of this}} study was to compare <b>reaction</b> <b>time</b> and anticipatory skill of volleyball players versus non-athletes. &nbsp; Materials and Methods: Eleven female volleyball players and 11 female non-athletes participated in this study. Auditory choice <b>reaction</b> <b>time,</b> auditory complex choice <b>reaction</b> <b>time,</b> visual choice <b>reaction</b> <b>time,</b> visual complex choice <b>reaction</b> <b>time,</b> anticipatory skill of the high speed of the ball and anticipatory skill of the low speed of ball of both groups were analyzed by a software (Speed Anticipation Reaction Test (SART)). &nbsp; Results: Statistical analysis did not show any significant differences between two groups in both auditory <b>reaction</b> <b>time</b> tests (P&gt; 0. 05). However, volleyball players showed better results in visual choice <b>reaction</b> <b>time,</b> visual complex choice <b>reaction</b> <b>time,</b> anticipatory skill of the high speed of the ball and anticipatory skill of the low speed of ball tests (P&gt; 0. 05). &nbsp; Conclusion: Volleyball players acquire extensive knowledge of sport specific patterns of perceptual abilities due to experiences within the volleyball domain and due to the efficient extraction of this knowledge in similar conditions such as, computerized neurocognitive tests, they have superior perceptual skills than non-athletes. &nbsp; Key words: <b>Reaction</b> <b>time,</b> Anticipatory skill, Volleyball players, Neurocognitive tests. &nbsp...|$|R
40|$|The {{literature}} on cutaneous communication {{suggests that a}} square wave electro-pulse {{may be a more}} eflective tactile stimulus for cross modality comparisons of <b>reaction</b> <b>times</b> than more traditional stimuli. It was hypothesized that the electro-pulse would give faster <b>reaction</b> <b>times</b> than either light or sound, when presented independently or in simultaneous combinations with the other stimuli. Mean <b>reaction</b> <b>times</b> of 10 male subjects, analysis o f variance and mean separation test all indicated that the electro-pulse resulted in faster <b>reaction</b> <b>times</b> and less variability of responses than the other stimuli in both single and combined presentations. The hypotheses were supported and an ordering of <b>reaction</b> <b>times</b> was statistically established as following from the hypotheses. Pooling of stimuli effectiveness was offered as an explanation for the rapid <b>reaction</b> <b>times</b> of combined stimuli...|$|R
