40|$|Pavement systems provide {{critical}} infrastructure services to society but also pose significant impacts related to high material consumption, energy inputs, and capital investment. A new <b>pavement</b> asset <b>management</b> approach, using economic, social, and environmental metrics, is proposed {{to enhance the}} sustainability of transportation infrastructure systems. This dissertation develops methods for evaluating and enhancing the sustainability of pavement infrastructure. Four methods are presented: (1) integrated life cycle assessment and life cycle cost analysis modeling of pavement overlay systems comparing new material Engineered Cementitious Composites (ECC) to conventional materials, (2) project-level <b>pavement</b> asset <b>management</b> system using life cycle optimization, (3) multi-objective and multi-constraint optimization informing policy and enhancing sustainability, and (4) network-level <b>pavement</b> asset <b>management</b> system integrated with geographic information systems. The integrated life cycle model {{results indicated that the}} application of ECC can significantly improve overlay system sustainability. Compared to conventional concrete and hot mixed asphalt (HMA) overlay systems, the ECC overlay system reduces life cycle energy consumption by 15 % and 72 %, greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by 32 %and 37 %, and costs by 40 % and 47 %, respectively. A project-level <b>pavement</b> asset <b>management</b> system was developed to determine the optimal pavement preservation strategy using life cycle optimization methods. The results showed that the optimal preservation strategies reduce the total life cycle energy consumption by 5 %- 30 %, the GHG emissions by 4 %- 40 %, and the costs by 0. 4 %- 12 % for the concrete, ECC, and HMA overlay systems, respectively. Multi-constraint and multi-objective optimization was conducted to study the relationship between material consumption, traffic congestion, and roughness effects. The influence of fuel prices, fuel taxes and government subsidies on sustainability performance was explored and specific policy recommendations were provided. The network-level <b>pavement</b> asset <b>management</b> system provides highway agencies the capability to better maintain a well functioning pavement network and to minimize life cycle cost. A case study application showed that the optimal preservation strategy can reduce life cycle cost by 13 % compared to current planning methods for the entire pavement network...|$|R

40|$|Pavement marking is a {{delineation}} practice that, until recently, has {{not been}} emphasized as much as other forms of delineation. The Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) is currently {{in the process of}} determining if there should be minimum retroreflectivity criteria for pavement markings. If these criteria become mandatory, road management agencies will be forced to understand the retroreflectivity of edge lines and centerlines and the retention of retroreflectivity with exposure to weather, snowplowing, road salt and sand, and traffic density. The three key characteristics of greatest interest when selecting a marking material are: durability, retroreflectivity, and cost.

40|$|Roads {{represent}} a major long-term infrastructure investment. A well-managed and maintained road is therefore {{fundamental to the}} safety and availability of the road network as a whole. In carrying out pavement maintenance functions, Local Road Authorities face growing pressures arising from inadequate budgets and greater accountability, when many of the existing roads have reached the upper limits of their design life spans while being subjected to increasing traffic. There are many factors that influence the decision making process in <b>pavement</b> maintenance <b>management,</b> including road surface conditions, safety, traffic loading, cost, funding and prioritisation decisions, hence an efficient approach is vital to ensure optimisation and a satisfactory trade-off between conflicting factors. A Multi-criteria Decision Making (MCDM) approach is used to handle the trade-off between conflicting factors. It is processed in the Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) using Excel software, and the database developed in Excel is then imported into GIS {{in order to allow}} ease of query, analysis and visualisation of results. The main key output of this research will be the development of a GIS-based <b>pavement</b> maintenance <b>management</b> model to support decision making in <b>pavement</b> maintenance <b>management.</b> The most important factors influencing decision making in <b>pavement</b> maintenance <b>management</b> are established through a nationwide questionnaire survey, which is undertaken among the UK Local Authorities’ pavement maintenance experts. 14 factors were identified, which are: Remaining Service Life, Road Condition Indicator (RCI), Type of Deterioration, Observed Deterioration Rate, Traffic Diversion, Importance of Road/Classification, Annual Average Daily Traffic (AADT), Possible Conflict or Overlap with Other Road Works, Risk of failure, Safety Concern, Accident Rate (related to surface condition), Scheme Cost, Available Budget/Funding and Whole Life-Cycle Cost. Interviews were also conducted with experts in pavement maintenance within different Local Road Authorities to justify the rated factors affecting pavement maintenance prioritisation. The case study approach was adopted, based on Runnymede District roads within the Surrey County Council, for developing and testing the GIS-based decision support model. The output model was validated through interviews with four experts in pavement maintenance as target end-users, and the model was judged as a rational, simple and usable appropriate tool for network analysis as GIS.

40|$|One of the {{critical}} elements in any <b>pavement</b> asset <b>management</b> system is linked to a realistic life cycle assessment modelling of the pavement structure.

The method has been used here to calculate the degradation of an arterial road in Southern Sweden and thereafter compared with measurements from the Swedish long term pavement performance (LTPP) database. The arterial road had reached {{the critical}} 15 mm rut after 18 years in operation. The M-E approach used was a two-step procedure where the response of the structure was calculated mechanistically and thereafter the performance predicted empirically based on scaling of laboratory test results. The analysis shows that the rutting development can be simulated adequately although the calculations show slower rate than the measurements towards the end of the simulated period.

40|$|One {{of the key}} {{principal}} {{goals of}} <b>pavement</b> asset <b>management</b> is {{to develop and implement}} cost-effective pavement construction and maintenance strategies that achieve the required levels of service and performance. A sustainable, cost-effective technique for rehabilitating pavements is foamed bitumen stabilization. This paper presents a study on the performance of foamed bitumen pavements tested in the Canterbury Accelerated Pavement Testing Indoor Facility (CAPTIF), for full scale testing of pavements. Six pavement sections were tested; the variables were bitumen and cement content; one control section with the untreated unbound material was tested. Results showed that surface deflections decreased at sections with higher bitumen contents. After the application of 5, 710, 000 Equivalent Standard Axles (ESAs), the sections stabilised with cement only, bitumen only, and the control section all showed large amounts of rutting. Conversely, little rutting was observed in the three sections stabilised with foamed bitumen and 1. 0 % cement, showing that cement and FB together significantly improve pavement performance. The rutting results were used to develop models to describe the stable and unstable performance of the tested pavements. The paper concludes by outlining some of the practical benefits of utilising this technology in <b>pavement</b> asset <b>management...</b>|$|R

50|$|The {{introduction}} of the Governmental Accounting Standards Board’s (GASB’s) Statement 34 is having a dramatic impact on the financial reporting requirements {{of state and local}} governments. Introduced in June 1999, this provision recommends that governmental agencies report the value of their infrastructure assets in their financial statements. GASB recommends that government agencies use a historical cost approach for capitalizing long-lived capital assets; however, if historical information is not available, guidance is provided for an alternate approach based on the current replacement cost of the assets. A method of representing the costs {{associated with the use of}} the assets must also be selected, and two methods are allowed by GASB. One approach is to depreciate the assets over time. The modified approach, on the other hand, provides an agency more flexibility in reporting the value of its assets based upon the use of a systematic, defensible approach that accounts for the preservation of the asset. <b>Pavement</b> <b>management</b> and <b>pavement</b> <b>management</b> systems provide agencies with the tools necessary to evaluate their pavement assets and meet the GASB34 requirements under the modified depreciation approach.|$|E

40|$|Purpose The study aims {{to develop}} a methodological {{framework}} to estimate life cycle energy consumption and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions related to <b>pavement</b> design and <b>management</b> decisions. Another objective is to apply the framework to the design and management of flexible highway pavement in Hong Kong. Traditionally, <b>pavement</b> design and <b>management</b> decisions are solely based on economic considerations. This study quantifies the relationships between such decisions and the environmental impacts, thereby helping highway agencies understand the environmental implications of their decisions and make more balanced decisions to improve highway sustainability. Methods (1) A methodological framework is developed by integrating the mechanistic-empirical pavement design guide (ME-PDG) and life cycle assessment (LCA) methods. (2) The calculation processes for the detailed components in the framework are proposed by synthesizing existing models, data, and tools. (3) In applying the framework to <b>pavement</b> design and <b>management</b> in Hong Kong, {{a large number of}} simulations are conducted to generate pavement performance data at different combinations of pavement thickness, roughness trigger value, and traffic levels. (4) GHG emissions and energy consumption are calculated for each simulation scenario, and the results are used to build statistical regression models. (5) The simulation and calculation results are also analyzed to gain additional insights on the environmental impacts of <b>pavement</b> design and <b>management</b> decisions. Results and conclusions (1) The developed framework that integrates ME-PDG and LCA methods is useful to assess pavement-related life cycle energy consumption and GHG emissions. (2) The developed regression models can well capture the trends of life cycle energy consumption and GHG emissions at different traffic levels, using asphalt concrete (AC) layer thickness and roughness trigger value as independent variables. (3) Material production, road use, and congestion due to road closure dominate pavement-related life cycle energy use and GHG emissions. (4) Optimum pavement thickness and international roughness index (IRI) trigger values exist, and they vary with traffic levels.
