This family has long controlled different kinds of resources (religious, economic) reinforcing each other, this circuit being secured by its integration in the Ottoman imperial system. The closing of the bektashi brotherhood in 1925 caused both the diminution of the resources they controlled collectively, and conflicts about the distribution of these - most importantly the spiritual leadership[mürşitlik] [...] inside the family. Consequently, the strategies that appeared aiming to increase and convert these resources into other sectors (mainly politics) became individual, and were mostly initiated by <b>persons</b> <b>marginalized</b> <b>from</b> mürşitlik. These initiatives caused both an increase and diversification of their personal resources and, since some of them were considered illegitimate, the decrease {{of the value of the}} collective resources (family authority, reputation). In the same way that family resources determine the strategies and margins for action of each of its members, their individual initiatives also have effects on the collective resources. At the same time, these individuals aiming to come closer to the core family have built centripetal alliances, thus contributing to produce a bounded family more favourable to them during future decades. As sacred as it may be, and even if based on something as tangible as blood, family remains a social construct and the product of collective action, at the crossroads of multiple tensions...|$|R

[...] He breaks into an empty seaside villa. He visits the town at rare intervals and as briefly as his scant purchases (of cigarettes, biscuits, or even beer) require. Soon, lack of human contact affects him like a drug and he experiences other modes of being: through a dog's eye or a rat's.. states of heightened consciousness which build up into a terrifying world of glaring hallucinatory experience.

After these reforms, the Vichy government began to display its anti-Semitic views by installing laws discriminating against Jews and imitating the Nazi German Nuremberg laws.

40|$|The trope of {{the mirror}} is {{prevalent}} in La Haine/Hate (1995). Structurally the film is constructed around a series of recurring images, around a collection of cinematic citations reflected and refracted from elsewhere. On a narrative level, characters frequently look into mirrors. However, what becomes visible in the reflective surface of the looking glass is not a sense of identity, but rather a sense of lack. Estranged from their ancestry and <b>marginalized</b> <b>from</b> the <b>society</b> of their present, Vinz, Hubert and Sad borrow from other sources (historical, cinematic, linguistic) {{in order to create}} a sense of presence and identity. Like the film in which they star, they frequently borrow from Black American culture, film and heritage. However, the borrowed masks certain characters create for themselves prove to be problematic. They do not always fit. Moreover, the sense of origin they provide is shifting for a number of the sources from which the boys and film borrow are themselves already borrowed. By allowing us to fall into the coils of the palimpsest of Vinz's identity in La Haine, the film powerfully underlines the ever-receding absence which constitutes the only presence of his being...|$|R

Deena Weinstein’s book Heavy Metal: The Music And Its Culture argues that heavy metal “…has persisted far longer than most genres of rock music” due {{to the growth of}} an intense “subculture which identified with the music”. Metal fans formed an “exclusionary youth community” which was [...] "distinctive and <b>marginalized</b> <b>from</b> the mainstream” <b>society.</b> The heavy metal scene developed a strongly masculine “community with shared values, norms, and behaviors”. A “code of authenticity” is central to the heavy metal subculture this code requires bands to have a “disinterest in commercial appeal” and radio hits as well as a refusal to “sell out”. The metal code also includes “opposition to established authority, and separateness from the rest of society”. Fans expect that the metal “…vocation performers includes total devotion to the music and deep loyalty to the youth subculture that grew up around it…” a metal performer must be an “idealized representative of the subculture”.|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background There {{is little}} {{published}} research investigating sex work in Namibia, particularly in rural areas. Therefore, {{the aim of}} this paper was to determine the views of women engaged in sex work in the Oshakati area of Namibia concerning the main factors influencing their use, or non-use, of male condoms during transactional sexual exchanges. Methods Qualitative interviews were used to better understand the perceptions, experiences and economic considerations of female sex workers in Namibia who were involved in a Behavior Change Communication Program encouraging safer sex practices among high-risk populations in 2006 and 2007. Results While the Behavior Change Communication Program has made significant strides in educating and empowering young women to negotiate more consistent condom use with sexual partners, the gendered economic inequalities and power imbalances within rural and semi-urban Namibian society that favor men hinder further advancement towards positive behavioral change for HIV prevention and also hinder the development of the loving relationships sought by some sex workers. Conclusion This study found that sex workers and transactional sex encounters are heterogeneous entities dependent upon the characteristics of the man (known, stranger, wealthy, attractive to the woman) and the woman (in financial need, desiring love). These features all influence condom use. The 3 E's 'education, empowerment and economic independence' are critical factors needed to encourage and facilitate consistent condom use to prevent HIV transmission. Without financial independence and occupational alternatives building on their health education and empowerment, women who engage in sex work-and transactional sex more generally-will remain largely <b>marginalized</b> <b>from</b> Namibian <b>society,</b> and will continue engaging in risky sexual practices that facilitate HIV acquisition and transmission throughout the community. </p...|$|R
40|$|Promoting the {{utilization}} of Information and Communications Technology (ICT) for mainstream society is no longer enough as significant groups of people in our societies are being left <b>marginalized</b> <b>from</b> the information <b>society.</b> ICT can provide tools that help these marginalized groups to attain levels of wellbeing that are equal to others. For example, the elderly are a marginalized group that is rapidly growing in APEC economies causing an urgent need to improve the ICT literacy and ICT capabilities. Another group equally affected is those with special needs such as the disabled. This report argues that one way to improve the ICT utilization of people with special needs and therefore contribute to wider development targets for these groups is to provide supplementary training to professionals who are {{in direct contact with}} them. The training will necessarily differ for each type of professional and for each economy and situation, but a generic training model and recommendations may be given which can help develop the training agenda and design the curriculum for these professionals. Such a model and recommendations are outlined in this report. The report outlines nine main competency areas in which training should be provided and eight different trainer types to whom this training should be focused on. In essence, the training to be provided is “training for trainers”, that is, competencies are created in groups for professionals who are in close contact with the elderly, disabled and others with special needs on a regular basis...|$|R

It also includes a short comparison with China when it comes to treating people with mental disorders. According to the Mental Health Global Action Program of WHO number of people suffering from the mental disorders is expected to reach 450 million people worldwide. Statistics released by the Chinese Centre for Disease Control and Prevention in 2009 showed that mental disorder in China affects a population of over 100 million people, of which 16 million are severely ill. People with mental disorders cannot be described as one single group; there is a wide range of different state of illness, including the depression, and patients with schizophrenia. One could even add other mental handicapped groups. These patients inflict severe burden upon their families and as well as the society. They have diseased emotional expressions what ‘normal’ people are not endowed with, so that they are somehow misunderstood, to be more exact, they are not accepted.

Six confi rmed cases of pandemic (H 1 N 1) 2009 were detected, {{and the use}} of rapid, mobile infl uenza testing was demonstrated. The first declared influenza pandemic in 40 years likely originated in March 2009 in La Gloria, Veracruz, a small rural town in southern Mexico (1). The virus responsible for the outbreak, identified as a novel influenza A (H 1 N 1) virus, now referred to as pandemic (H 1 N 1) 2009, spread quickly. By the end of 2009, ≈ 70, 000 cases were confirmed and 944 deaths were recorded in Mexico (2), and> 600, 000 cases were reported worldwide (3). When pandemic (H 1 N 1) 2009 first emerged there was concern that Mexico–US border cities, which have served as corridors for binational transmission of infectious diseases (4), might become overwhelmed by the disease before national surveillance resources could be mobilized. Of particular concern was the fact that traditional hospital-based disease surveillance would miss the emergence of pandemic (H 1 N 1) 2009 in the dense, highly mobile (5), marginalized border populations. Furthermore, the poorest and most underserved border populations, composed of the homeless, commercial sex workers, and those with alcohol and drug abuse problems, have disproportionately high levels of diseases such as HIV (6) and tuberculosis (7), illnesses suspected of increasing vulnerability to acquiring and dying of pandemic (H 1 N 1) 2009 (8, 9).
