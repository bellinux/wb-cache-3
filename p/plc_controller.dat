40|$|In this paper, {{we present}} the {{automatic}} PID tuning procedure {{based on the}} Method of Moments and AMIGO tuning rules. The advantage of the Method of Moments is that the time constant and transport delay are estimated at the areas {{rather than on the}} individual points. This results in high resistance to the measurement noises. The sensitivity to measurement noises is a serious problem in other autotuning methods. The second advantage of this method is that it approximates plant during identification process to first order model with time delay. We combined the Method of Moments with the AMIGO tuning rules and implemented this combination as a stand-alone autotuning procedure in Siemens S 7 - 1200 <b>PLC</b> <b>controller.</b> Next, we compared this method with two built-in PID autotuning procedures which were available in Siemens S 7 - 1200 <b>PLC</b> <b>controller.</b> The procedure was tested for three types of plant models: with lag-dominated, balanced, and delay-dominated dynamics. We simulated the plants on a PC in Matlab R 2013 a. The connection between the PC and PLC was maintained through a National Instruments data acquisition board, NI PCI- 6229. We conducted tests for step change in the set point, trajectory tracking, and load disturbances. To assess control quality, we used IAE index. We limited our research to PI algorithm. The results prove that proposed method was better than two built-in tuning methods provided by Siemens, oscillating between a few and even a dozen percent in most cases. The proposed method is universal and can be implemented in any <b>PLC</b> <b>controller...</b>|$|E
