50|$|The website “Native American Myths of Creation” {{offers the}} story for the Lakota tribes’ myth: The Earth that was before this one, the people of that world did not behave themselves. The Creating Power was {{dissatisfied}} {{so he decided to}} bring a very heavy rain that flooded the whole Earth. All the people and almost all the animals died except for Kangi, which was a crow. The crow asked the Creating Power to create him a new resting spot so the Creating Power decided to create the new world. Creating Power had a huge <b>pipe</b> <b>bag</b> that had all types of animals and birds in it. He selected four animals that could survive underwater for long periods of time. He told each animal to grab a clump of mud from underwater. First the dove tried and failed. Then the otter tried but also failed to reach the bottom. Next the beaver tried but he too also failed. The Creating Power was about to give up hope but decided to try the turtle. The turtle had stayed underwater for so long everyone was sure he had drowned. But then he broke the water’s surface with mud clenched in his mouth, feet, claws and turtle shell. The mud became the resting place for the turtle and crow while the Creating Power shook two long eagle feathers which caused the mud to expand across the water to form a dry surface. The Creating Power was saddened for how dry the land was which caused him to cry which now are the oceans, stream, and lakes. He named this new Earth Turtle Continent. He released more animals from his <b>pipe</b> <b>bag</b> to roam the new Earth and created human from red, white, black, and yellow Earth. He gave the new people his sacred pipe and told them do good and warned them about what happened to the people before then when they started living bad.|$|E

50|$|In 1956-57, the Pipe Band was {{authorized}} for the College and was under process of formation and training being {{guided by the}} Padre, Major Jack Armstrong. Sgt. Mackenzie and Sgt. Blackely of the R.C.A.F. pipe band at Rockcliffe provided the pipers and drummers with professional instruction. A position of Cadet Wing Band Officer was created; C.F.L. Cooke, the pipe-major, trained new members and {{was responsible for the}} general direction of the band. Major-General J.B.D. Smith, CBE, DSO, CD, Commandant of the National Defence College remarked to the Cadet Wing that the 1956 parade was a special one because it marked the return of the famous pill-boxes and the first appearance of the RMC pipe-band on a ceremonial parade. Much more extensive use has been made of the pipe band this year than ever before. The pipe band performed on parades, sporting events, and special occasions; the band performed at three ceremonial parades in the first term and at many of the football games, several hockey games and the West Point hockey game. The band acquired new <b>pipe</b> <b>bag</b> covers, new side drums, and the mace and sash carried by Cadet Doyle, the drum-major.|$|E
5000|$|A half set is {{the next}} stage up from a {{practice}} set. As with other forms of bagpipes, uilleann pipes use [...] "drones", which are most commonly three pipes accompanying the melody of the chanter with a constant background tonic note. The pipes are generally equipped with three drones: the tenor drone, as the highest sounding pipe, which is pitched {{the same as the}} lowest note of the chanter; the baritone drone pitched one octave below that; and the bass drone, as the lowest sounding pipe, two octaves below the bottom note of the chanter. The Pastoral pipes had four drones: these three plus one more that would play a harmony note at the fourth or fifth interval. These drones are connected to the <b>pipe</b> <b>bag</b> by a [...] "stock". This is an intricately made wooden cylinder tied into the bag (as any other stock) by a thick yarn or hemp thread. The drones connect to the stock, as do the regulators (see full set below). The stock and drones are laid across the right thigh. This is distinct from other forms of bagpipes, in which the drones are usually carried over the shoulder or over the right arm.|$|E
40|$|Greengrass Pipe Dancers is {{an account}} of Little Eagle 2 ̆ 7 s trips in 1988 and 1990 to Lakota {{communities}} in South Dakota, notably Greengrass on the Cheyenne River Reservation, on a quest for counsel about an old Oglala <b>pipe</b> <b>bag</b> that had come into his possession, for physical healing for his sick wife, and for his own emotional and spiritual healing following her death. During these brief visits, the author, who claims European and Micmac ancestry, meets several well-known Lakota religious leaders and elders; attends ceremonies including pipe ceremonies, inipis, a yuwipi, and a sun dance; and experiences visions. Little Eagle states in his introduction that he writes with 2 ̆ 2 absolutely no authority 2 ̆ 2 about the Lakota traditions he describes and that although Greengrass Pipe Dancers is 2 ̆ 2 true 2 ̆ 2 he does 2 ̆ 2 not claim that it is completely factual 2 ̆ 2 Readers would {{be well advised to}} keep both of these points in mind in accessing the portrait of Lakota life and spirituality shown in the book and the claim on the back cover that 2 ̆ 2 Crazy Horse 2 ̆ 7 s <b>pipe</b> <b>bag</b> is the inspiration for this true story. 2 ̆ 2 The author presents no substantial evidence to support the supposition that his <b>pipe</b> <b>bag</b> once belonged to Crazy Horse. More disturbing is Little Eagle 2 ̆ 7 s attribution of long quotations to Lakota spiritual leaders and elders based on memories of his visits and only occasionally backed up with notes taken at the time. He states repeatedly that he humbly respects these people, but is it humble or respectful to put words into their mouths for which they may be held responsible by unwary readers? Of his reconstructed quotations, the author writes that 2 ̆ 2 Good stories are like good recipes: sometimes you will add a few more grains of sugar, or substitute 2...|$|E

50|$|The bunker when in {{operation}} {{would have been}} pressurized. The pressurization would keep out poison gas should the Allies use it, and ensure that when the guns fired, almost all {{the smoke from the}} burnt powder exited the bunker. When the gunners fired, the pressurized air in the bunker would push the gasses out through the guns' barrels. The reduction in smoke would allow the crew to operate effectively even when firing constantly. The pressurization also meant that the spent cases contained less residual gas, meaning they could just be fed out of the cupola via <b>pipes</b> into <b>bags</b> with no danger of smoking out the bunker's other occupants.|$|R

Chevals must be prevented from falling or leaping into the sea and drowning, as it would offend Agwe.

40|$|Plastic {{materials}} have been worldwide applied in agriculture for soil mulching, greenhouse covering, irrigation and drainage <b>pipes,</b> <b>bags,</b> containers, pots, and agrochemical containers. All of these plastic materials require, {{at the end}} of their lifetime, suitable collection and treatment systems. Agricultural activities in some areas of the Apulia Region, Southern Italy, are characterized by huge quantities of plastic wastes and local authorities and farmers associations have been interested in solving this problem by applying modern land management tools such as Geographical Information System (G. I. S.). In this paper a G. I. S. methodology is applied to an area of 10, 200 ha in the Trani municipality, included in the Province of Barletta, Andria, Trani (BAT) - Apulia Region, in order to assess the agricultural plastic waste generation. The use of plastics at the agricultural farms has been investigated and related to the land use by applying statistical analysis, orthophoto analysis and remote sensing surveys. These data were introduced in a specific geo-database, and the agricultural plastic waste quantity and localization were defined. Vineyards and olive groves are scattered in this area, so the agricultural plastic waste mostly consists in irrigation pipes, after-use covering films and anti-hail nets used on vineyards. The analysis carried out showed that up to 614 kg ha- 1 of covering films waste are yearly produced in some areas while the estimation of waste from the anti-hail nets was up to 159 kg ha- 1 and the waste yearly produced from irrigation pipes was up to 83 kg ha- 1. Through the use of the G. I. S., the areas with high density of plastic wastes were pointed out thus allowing to determine the suitable location of temporary storage areas and collecting points, in order to optimize the transport of agricultural plastic waste from the farms to the collecting points and to the recycling firms...|$|R
