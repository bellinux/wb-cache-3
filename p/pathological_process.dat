25|$|Disseminated {{intravascular}} coagulation (DIC) is a <b>pathological</b> <b>process</b> {{characterized by}} the widespread activation of the clotting cascade that results {{in the formation of}} blood clots in the small blood vessels throughout the body. This leads to compromised tissue blood flow and can ultimately lead to multiple organ damage. In addition, as the coagulation process consumes clotting factors and platelets, normal clotting is disrupted and severe bleeding can occur from various sites.|$|E
25|$|Any <b>pathological</b> <b>process</b> in {{the visual}} system, even in older humans beyond the {{critical}} period, will often cause decreases in visual acuity. Thus measuring visual acuity is a simple test in accessing {{the health of the}} eyes, the visual brain, or pathway to the brain. Any relatively sudden decrease in visual acuity is always a cause for concern. Common causes of decreases in visual acuity are cataracts and scarred corneas, which affect the optical path, diseases that affect the retina, such as macular degeneration and diabetes, diseases affecting the optic pathway to the brain such as tumors and multiple sclerosis, and diseases affecting the visual cortex such as tumors and strokes.|$|E

The rheumatology unit she established there has a strong interest in scleroderma: it is a national tertiary referral centre for patients suffering from the illness and is the major European centre for clinical research into the disease, with a particular focus on trying to understand the <b>pathological</b> <b>process</b> of fibrosis or scarring that characterises the condition at a histological level. The unit also has a strong tradition of high-quality teaching aimed at medical students and specialists-in-training.|$|E

25|$|Excitotoxicity is the <b>pathological</b> <b>process</b> {{by which}} nerve cells are damaged or killed by {{excessive}} stimulation by neurotransmitters such as glutamate and similar substances. This occurs when receptors for the excitatory neurotransmitter glutamate (glutamate receptors) {{such as the}} NMDA receptor and AMPA receptor are overactivated by glutamatergic storm. Excitotoxins like NMDA and kainic acid which bind to these receptors, as well as pathologically high levels of glutamate, can cause excitotoxicity by allowing high levels of calcium ions (Ca2+) to enter the cell. influx elicited by glutamate: role in neuronal death | url = | journal = Molecular Pharmacoloy | volume = 36 | issue = 1| pages = 106–112 | pmid = 2568579 }} Ca2+ influx into cells activates a number of enzymes, including phospholipases, endonucleases, and proteases such as calpain. These enzymes go on to damage cell structures such as components of the cytoskeleton, membrane, and DNA.|$|E
2500|$|Urine [...] {{bilirubin}} {{may also}} be clinically significant. Bilirubin is not normally detectable in the urine of healthy people. If the blood level of conjugated bilirubin becomes elevated, e.g. due to liver disease, excess conjugated bilirubin is excreted in the urine, indicating a <b>pathological</b> <b>process.</b> Unconjugated bilirubin is not water-soluble and so is not excreted in the urine. Testing urine for both bilirubin and urobilinogen can help differentiate obstructive liver disease from other causes of jaundice.|$|E

However, existing methods and standards for documenting these conditions have flaws that inhibit these goals, especially translational research that bridges the two activities.

Specifically, a substance intolerance is a disease whose <b>pathological</b> <b>process(es)</b> are realized upon exposure to a quantity of substance of a particular type, and this quantity would normally not cause {{the realization of the}} <b>pathological</b> <b>process(es).</b> To develop this theory, it was necessary to build pieces of a theory of <b>pathological</b> <b>processes.</b> Overall, however, the framework of the Ontology for General Medical Science (which uses Basic Formal Ontology as its uppermost level) was a more-than-adequate foundation on which to build the theory...|$|R
