5|$|Ununennium, {{also known}} as eka-francium or simply element 119, is the {{hypothetical}} chemical element with symbol Uue and atomic number 119. Ununennium and Uue are the temporary systematic IUPAC name and symbol respectively, until a <b>permanent</b> <b>name</b> is decided upon.

5|$|Using Mendeleev's {{nomenclature}} for unnamed and undiscovered elements, roentgenium {{should be}} known as eka-gold. In 1979, IUPAC published recommendations according to which the element was to be called unununium (with the corresponding symbol of Uuu), a systematic element name as a placeholder, until the element was discovered (and the discovery then confirmed) and a <b>permanent</b> <b>name</b> was decided on. Although widely used in the chemical community on all levels, from chemistry classrooms to advanced textbooks, the recommendations were mostly ignored among scientists in the field, who either called it element 111, with the symbol of E111, (111) or even simply 111.|$|E
5|$|Unbinilium, {{also known}} as eka-radium or simply element 120, is the {{hypothetical}} chemical element in the periodic table with symbol Ubn and atomic number 120.

In the periodic table of the elements, {{it is expected to}} be an s-block element, an alkaline earth metal, and the second element in the eighth period. It has attracted attention because of some predictions that it may be in the island of stability, although newer calculations expect the island to actually occur at a slightly lower atomic number, closer to copernicium and flerovium.|$|E
5|$|Unbiunium, {{also known}} as eka-actinium or element 121, is the {{hypothetical}} chemical element with symbol Ubu and atomic number 121. Unbiunium and Ubu are the temporary systematic IUPAC name and symbol, until a <b>permanent</b> <b>name</b> is decided upon. In the periodic table of the elements, {{it is expected to}} be the first of the superactinides, and the third element in the eighth period: analogously to lanthanum and actinium, it could be considered the fifth member of group 3 and the first member of the fifth-row transition metals. It has attracted attention because of some predictions that it may be in the island of stability, although newer calculations expect the island to actually occur at a slightly lower atomic number, closer to copernicium and flerovium.|$|E
