5|$|After {{a four-month}} investigation, the {{criminal}} justice branch of the Attorney General of British Columbia announced formal charges of assault causing bodily harm against Bertuzzi on June 24, 2004. With the charge, Bertuzzi faced up to one-and-a-half years in prison. Bertuzzi pleaded guilty to the assault charge on December 22 after arranging a <b>plea</b> <b>bargain</b> with prosecutors. He was given a conditional discharge requiring 80 {{hours of community service}} and one year's probation that additionally prohibited him from playing in any hockey game Moore was competing in. Under Canadian law, Bertuzzi's successful completion of his probationary period precluded him from a criminal record. Moore expressed disappointment regarding Bertuzzi's discharge and was upset that he was unable to attend the court date, having to issue a written victim statement instead. Moore's lawyer, Tim Danson, was given one day's notice of the court date following Bertuzzi's <b>plea</b> <b>bargain,</b> which he said was insufficient time for Moore to travel to Vancouver.|$|E

This Article exposes the deficiencies in guilty plea procedures at The Hague, particularly those designed to assess whether a plea is fully informed and voluntary.

40|$|The {{dominant}} {{theoretical model}} of <b>plea</b> <b>bargaining</b> predicts that, {{under conditions of}} full information and rational choice, criminal cases should uniformly be settled through <b>plea</b> <b>bargaining.</b> That prediction holds for innocent and guilty defendants alike. Because it is perfectly rational for innocent defendants to plead guilty, <b>plea</b> <b>bargaining</b> might {{be said to have}} an 2 ̆ 2 innocence problem. 2 ̆ 2 <b>Plea</b> <b>bargaining</b> 2 ̆ 7 s innocence problem is, at bottom, the result of a signaling defect. Innocent defendants lacking verifiable innocence claims are pooled together with guilty defendants who falsely proclaim innocence. As a result, both groups of defendants are treated similarly at trial and in <b>plea</b> <b>bargaining.</b> Signaling defects, however, at least in theory, can be overcome. As economists have observed, a variety of signaling mechanisms reliably communicate nonverifiable information among parties. This Article considers one such signaling mechanism, subwagers, and attempts to demonstrate their capacity to signal the kind of private information typical in the <b>plea</b> <b>bargaining</b> context. Not only are subwagers theoretically possible, the Article argues that police interrogation already functions as such a subwager. The Article addresses the theoretical basis and empirical evidence supporting the hypothesis regarding interrogation 2 ̆ 7 s important impact on <b>plea</b> <b>bargaining,</b> and concludes that <b>plea</b> <b>bargaining</b> theory must be modified to take account of the effects of subwager-type signaling...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{examines}} {{the practice of}} <b>plea</b> <b>bargaining</b> in national and international criminal courts. <b>Plea</b> <b>bargaining</b> is a controversial practice {{at the national level}} and that controversy is escalated when dealing with the most serious crimes, such as genocide, that will be prosecuted in international criminal courts. There are arguments both for and against <b>plea</b> <b>bargaining</b> in national adversarial systems. Many of these arguments are also applicable in international criminal law and there will be further arguments for and against <b>plea</b> <b>bargaining</b> in international criminal courts that do not apply, or apply only to a lesser extent in national systems. A balance has to be struck between an efficient criminal justice system and a criminal justice system that achieves its aims of reconciliation, deterrence and punishment for perpetrators. The practice of <b>plea</b> <b>bargaining</b> has been used at the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia (hereinafter ICTY) and the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda (hereinafter ICTR). The experiences of these ad hoc tribunals in dealing with the practice {{must be taken into account}} in coalition with the theoretical arguments for and against <b>plea</b> <b>bargaining</b> to determine a best practice approach to <b>plea</b> <b>bargaining</b> in international criminal law that could be implemented at the International Criminal Court (hereinafter ICC) and in international criminal forums generally.
