Traditional {{third world}} agriculture that is best at maintaining diversity with multiple cropping systems such aspolyculture(includingcompanion plantingandintercropping) andagroforestrysystems such as shifting cultivation. In Latin America, between 70% and 90% of beans are grown mixed with other {{crops such as}} maize and potatoes. Worldwide, multiple cropping provided up to 20% of all food in 1986. Traditional systems also maintain diversity within a crop species, such as in theAndesmountains where up to 50 varieties of potato are grown.The effects of loss of biodiversity are especially noticeable in pest control. Herbivorous pest insects tend to become more abundant inmonocultures. Stable agroecosystems are biodiverse and contain sufficient numbers of natural enemies of crop pests, such asparasitoidalwasps which are able to controlaphidsandlepidopterancaterpillars. These ecosystems continuously provide food and breeding sites for these beneficial species. Agroecosystems can achieve this equilibrium by arranging a suitable combination of crops in space and time, given the type of soil and surrounding environment; sufficient abundance of non-crop plants in and around fields; and appropriate management of vegetation. Suitable farming strategies include polyculture,crop rotation, mosaics of small scattered fields and uncultivated land. Additional strategies include <b>perennial</b> <b>crops</b> such asorchards(especially if a diverse floral undergrowth is permitted), tolerating specific weed species, and raising genetic diversity such as by planting mixtures of crop varieties.|$|E

The objective {{of this study was}} to evaluate possible structural changes and degradation in an Oxisol under different managements for 20 years: no-tillage cultivation with and without <b>crop</b> rotation, <b>perennial</b> <b>crop</b> and conventional tillage, plus a forested area (reference). Initially, the crop profile was described and subsequently, 10 samples per management system and forest soil were collected to quantify soil organic matter, flocculation degree, bulk density, and macroporosity.

The soil was increasingly degraded in the increasing order: forest => no-tillage <b>crop</b> rotation => <b>perennial</b> <b>crop</b> => no-tillage without crop rotation => conventional tillage. In all managements, the values of organic matter and macroporosity were always below and bulk density always above those of the reference area (forest) and, under no-tillage <b>crop</b> rotation and <b>perennial</b> <b>crop,</b> the flocculation degree was proportionally equal to that of the reference area...|$|R

25|$|Shifting {{cultivation}} (or slash and burn) is {{a system}} in which forests are burnt, releasing nutrients to support cultivation of annual and then <b>perennial</b> <b>crops</b> for a period of several years. Then the plot is left fallow to regrow forest, and the farmer moves to a new plot, returning after many more years (10–20). This fallow period is shortened if population density grows, requiring the input of nutrients (fertilizer or manure) and some manual pest control. Annual cultivation is the next phase of intensity {{in which there is no}} fallow period. This requires even greater nutrient and pest control inputs.|$|E
25|$|Because {{under this}} {{approach}} land cannot be sown but existing plants can be tended and harvested, {{the approach is}} applied to orchards, vineyards, and other <b>perennial</b> <b>crops.</b> A beit din, or rabbinical court supervising the process, hires farmers as its agents to tend and harvest the crops, and appoints the usual distributors and shopkeepers as its agents to distribute them. Individual consumers appoint the court and its designees as their agents and pay monies to court-appointed designees as agents of the court. Thus, under this approach, a legal arrangement is created whereby the crops themselves are never bought or sold, but rather people are merely paid for their labor and expenses in providing certain services. In modern Israel, the badatz is notable for adapting and supervising such arrangements.|$|E

The focus is on activities which threaten the integrity of the national park (<b>perennial</b> <b>crop</b> production and sale of forest products) and on non-agricultural activities (wage labour and self-employment) which are able to reduce poverty without threatening the national park. The analysis allows to identify factors which are essentially for the design of policies and programmes aiming to promote rural development and to protect the national park. <b>Perennial</b> <b>crop</b> production and activities outside the agricultural sector are particularly important for the less-poor households, whereas the selling of forest products is especially important for the poorest households. The econometric analysis shows that the possession of irrigated land, the access to social capital, and the participation in formal credit markets positively influences <b>perennial</b> <b>crop</b> production, which is a major source of deforestation. The possession of irrigated land, education, and the access to road infrastructure have a negative influence on the sale of forest products which are mainly collected inside the national park.

Root-knot nematodes are distributed worldwide, and are obligate parasites of the roots of thousands of plant species, including monocotyledonous and dicotyledonous, herbaceous and woody plants. The genus includes more than 90 species, with some species having several races. Four Meloidogyne species (M. javanica, M. arenaria, M. incognita, and M. hapla) are major pests worldwide, with another seven being important on a local basis.

500|$|At the {{opposite}} end of the parish is part of the 580 acre East Malling Research Station. This began in 1913 with 23 acres in response to a need among Kent farmers for assistance with their fruit growing activities. Since fruit was an important part of the Kent economy, the station performed a valuable role is carrying out research experiments and advising farmers on fruit production. The land that forms the research station grounds is conducive to the growing of fruit, with good water retention and drainage properties. The station was also well placed in terms of transport links, since the nearby railway connected with London in one direction and the agricultural college at Wye in the other. It was an indication of the importance of the research station that the government and fruit producers were prepared to give financial support for its work. In 1938 the 360 acre Bradbourne House estate was added to the site. As a result of research work carried out on the site, the station established a reputation as a world centre for the research of <b>perennial</b> <b>crops.</b> Horticultural Research International operated the site until 2009 until 1 April 2010, since when the research station has been owned by the East Malling Trust.

In the process of transformation of tropical rain forests and semiarid grasslands to farmlands, land degradation usually occurs. But the transformation of arid desert landscape to oasis is found to have quite different consequences. Taking an alluvial plain oasis in the north piedmont (if the Tianshan Mountains as a case study, we investigate oasis soil properties related to different land-use systems during the transformation of and desert to oases. Selected land-use systems consisted of an annual crop field less than 3 years old, annual crop field 3 - 6 years old, annual crop field more than 6 years old, <b>perennial</b> <b>crop</b> field less than 4 years old, <b>perennial</b> <b>crop</b> field of 4 - 6 years old, <b>perennial</b> <b>crop</b> field more than 6 years old, abandoned farmland more than 3 years old, woodland field more than 6 years old, ecological forestation field, natural shrubbery field, desert grass land, and saline or alkaline field. Different land-use systems affect significantly the distribution of sand, silt and clay. Sand content in oasis soil tends to decrease with cultivation years but silt and clay contents tend to be increased in the oasis soils. Soil fertility is higher in the land-use systems under strong human disturbance than under weak human disturbance. Oasis soil nutrients also tend to increase with cultivation years. Soils have a significantly lower salinity in the land-use systems under strong human disturbance than under weak human disturbance. Soil organic matter and nutrients of the annual and <b>perennial</b> <b>crop</b> systems in the oasis tend to increase with cultivation time with the oasis soil acting as a carbon sink.
