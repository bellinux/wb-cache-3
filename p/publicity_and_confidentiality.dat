40|$|This thesis brings new {{insights}} to efficiency analysis by extending the research {{to the lowest}} level of aggregation in economics; the individual. The thesis is part of a bigger, interdisciplinary research project entitled “The linkages between employee well-being, social networks and productivity in services. Case: Nordea Life”. The research project is rooted in the “Healthy financial industry” –project, a joint effort of employers and employees whose goal is to increase the well-being, productivity and competitivity of the finance industry. The thesis employs a cross-sectional dataset on over four hundred anonymized individuals working in a case company, operating in the finance and insurance industry. The data was collected within a nine-month period between June 2016 and May 2017 and contained data on the working time, sales, customer satisfaction scores, location, sales channels, as well as other relevant information. The dataset consists of individuals working in four distinct work roles across four regions in two separate sales channels. The dataset was a preliminary dataset delivered to initiate the research project and consequently exhibited quality-issues that are also discussed. Due to the <b>publicity</b> <b>and</b> <b>confidentiality</b> of the work, the data and results are obfuscated. The service delivery process is assessed through the Service Profit Chain. A framework and procedural methodology for measuring the efficiency of the individuals is adapted from the COOPER-framework. The method employed to calculate the efficiency scores is a 2 -stage network Convex Nonparametric Least Squares (CNLS) regression solved as a Quadratic Programming (QP) problem in an additive form. The thesis constructs an Efficiency Matrix to assess the efficiency scores in conjunction with other potentially relevant attributes. The thesis’ major findings can be summarized as follow. Evidence is found efficiency varies based on operating unit, region and branch in the different work roles. There is strong evidence the channel has a major effect on the efficiency of individuals within the roles. Additionally, there is some evidence customer satisfaction and efficiency are positively connected and that distance from the mean efficiency correlates highly with the dispersion of the customer satisfaction scores. This empirically corroborates linkages in the Service Profit Chain between employee efficiency and customer satisfaction. Similar datasets have rarely been accumulated. My thesis benefits the Nordea Life –research project and serves a seminal study for future research focusing or tangent to the efficiency analysis of individuals in a working context...|$|E

Dessutom vill vi undersöka chefers tillämpning av ovan nämnda lagstiftning utifrån fiktiva fall. Vidare syftar studien till att undersöka hur de etiska grundprinciperna inom LSS påverkar enhetschefernas beslut om åtgärder gällande situationer då brukare begått brott. Vi vill också undersöka om det finns en problematik med att brukare inom LSS begår brott. Vi har använt oss av en kvalitativ metod där fyra semistrukturerade intervjuer genomförts med chefer inom verksamhetsområdet. Intervjuerna utgick delvis ifrån två fiktiva fall. Vi ville med det ge alla respondenter samma utgångs punkt. Vi har transkriberat vårt {{material}} för att tematisera och tolka det. Studien visar på att det finns en problematik med tillämpningen av lagstiftningen. Samtliga respondenter visste i teorin hur lagstiftningen såg ut, men ingen av respondenterna visste hur lagstiftningen tillämpades. Resultatet visar också att det finns en skillnad i synen på värdegrunderna beroende på hur nära brukaren respondenten arbetar. De respondenter som arbetat närmast brukarna vill skydda brukarna från allt ont, vilket ibland kan påverka brukarnas möjligheter att uppleva de värdegrunder som finns inom LSS. Respondenterna som inte arbetade nära brukarna uppfattade brukarna som vilka medborgare som helst. Nyckelord: Lagen om stöd och service till vissa funktionshindrade (LSS 1993 : 387), Offentlighet och sekretesslagen (OSL 2009 : 400), Brottsbalken (BrB 1962 : 700), värdegrunder inom LSS, chef.  LAW OR VALUES? WHAT RUNS IN PRACTICE? Öberg, MariaÖstberg, YlvaÖrebro UniversityDepartment for Behavioral, Social and Legal SciencesSocial Work programSocial work, 61 - 90 pointsC-essay, 15 pointsAutumn term 2009   Abstract The study aims {{to highlight}} the problems {{that are related to}} enforcement of the law for criminal code (BrB, 1962 : 700) and law of <b>publicity</b> <b>and</b> <b>confidentiality</b> (OSL, 2009 : 400) when patient in the 9 : 9 § in law of support and service for some functional disability peoples (LSS, 1993 : 387) commit crimes. We also want to investigate managers' implementation of the said law on the basis of fictitious cases. Furthermore, the study aims to examine how the basic ethical principles of LSS affects of Unit Decision on measures concerning situations where patient have committed crimes. We also want to investigate if {{there is a problem with}} users, within LSS, committing crimes. We have used a qualitative approach in which four semi-structured interviews conducted with managers in the business field. The interviews were based in part from two fictional cases. We wanted to give it all respondents the same starting point. We have transcribed our material for themed and interpret it. The study shows that there is a problem in law enforcement. All respondents knew in theory how the legislation looked like, but none of the respondents knew what the law was applied. The results also show that there is a difference of opinion on the value basis depending on how close to the patient the respondent works. Respondents who worked closest to the patient want to protect patient from all trouble, this sometimes can affect patient' ability to experience the values that exist in the LSS. Respondents who did not work close to patient, perceived the patient´s as any other citizens. Keywords: patient, functional disability, ethnical values, crime, manager. ...|$|E

Key findings - There were 98 participants consisting of consumers and carers (n= 74), health professionals (n= 13) and representatives from consumer organisations (n= 11). Participants highlighted a need for improved staff awareness. Consumers indicated a desire to receive information {{in a way that}} respects their privacy <b>and</b> <b>confidentiality,</b> in an appropriate space. Areas identified that require improved protection of privacy <b>and</b> <b>confidentiality</b> during pharmacy interactions were the number of staff having access to sensitive information, workflow models causing information exposure and pharmacies' layout not facilitating private discussions.

Given the small sample size and low response rate, the significance of the quantitative analysis must be regarded with modesty, and qualitative analysis of open-ended questions may be more valuable for development of future research.

40|$|Abstract — In this paper, we {{investigate}} the tradeoff between performance <b>and</b> <b>confidentiality</b> in signature-based air indexing schemes for wireless data broadcast. Two metrics, namely false drop probability and false guess probability, are defined {{to quantify the}} filtering efficiency <b>and</b> <b>confidentiality</b> loss of a signature scheme. Our analysis reveals that false drop probability and false guess probability share a similar trend as the tuning parameters of a signature scheme change and {{it is impossible to}} achieve a low false drop probability and a high false guess probability simultaneously. In order to balance the performance <b>and</b> <b>confidentiality,</b> we perform an analysis to provide a guidance for parameter settings of the signature schemes to meet different system requirements. In addition, we propose the jump pointer technique and the XOR signature scheme to further improve the performance <b>and</b> <b>confidentiality.</b> A comprehensive simulation has been conducted to validate our findings.
