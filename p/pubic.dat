5|$|Bikini waxing is the {{epilation}} of <b>pubic</b> hair {{beyond the}} bikini line {{by use of}} waxing. The bikini line delineates {{the part of a}} woman's <b>pubic</b> area to be covered by the bottom part of a bikini, which means any <b>pubic</b> hair visible beyond the boundaries of a swimsuit. Visible <b>pubic</b> hair is widely culturally disapproved, considered to be embarrassing, and often removed.|$|E
5|$|Humans host three {{different}} kinds of lice: head lice, body lice, and <b>pubic</b> lice. Lice infestations can be controlled with lice combs, and medicated shampoos or washes.|$|E
5|$|Males reach sexual {{maturity}} at 3–5 weeks; females can be fertile {{as early as}} four weeks and can carry litters before they are adults. Females that have never given birth may develop irreversible fusing of the <b>pubic</b> symphysis, a joint in the pelvis, due to calcification which may occur between six and ten months of age. If they become pregnant after this has happened, the birth canal will not widen sufficiently; this may lead to dystocia and death {{as they attempt to}} give birth. Calcification of the female's <b>pubic</b> symphysis (if not bred) is a common myth. The reason for potential calcification is a metabolic disease, like ochronosis. A healthy, normal female guinea pig's <b>pubic</b> symphysis does not calcify.|$|E
5|$|Humans host {{three species}} of louse, the head louse, the body louse and the <b>pubic</b> louse. The body louse has the {{smallest}} genome of any known insect; {{it has been}} used as a model organism and has been the subject of much research.|$|E
5|$|Late in the {{dry season}} (around April) of each year, females {{give birth to a}} single offspring. During feeding periods, the young either stays in the roost or remains {{attached}} to the mother at one of her two vestigial <b>pubic</b> nipples.|$|E
5|$|Depending {{on which}} bones are present, sex can be {{determined}} by looking for distinctive sexual dimorphisms. When available, the pelvis is extremely useful in the determination of sex and when properly examined can achieve sex determination with a great level of accuracy. The examination of the <b>pubic</b> arch {{and the location of}} the sacrum can help determine sex.|$|E
5|$|Lice {{have been}} the subject of {{significant}} DNA research in the 2000s that led to discoveries on human evolution. The three species of sucking lice that parasitize human beings belong to two genera, Pediculus and Pthirus: head lice (Pediculus humanus capitis), body lice (Pediculus humanus corporis), and <b>pubic</b> lice (Pthirus pubis). Human head and body lice (genus Pediculus) share a common ancestor with chimpanzee lice, while <b>pubic</b> lice (genus Pthirus) share a common ancestor with gorilla lice. Using phylogenetic and cophylogenetic analysis, Reed et al. hypothesized that Pediculus and Pthirus are sister taxa and monophyletic. In other words, the two genera descended from the same common ancestor. The age of divergence between Pediculus and its common ancestor is estimated to be 6-7 million years ago, which matches the age predicted by chimpanzee-hominid divergence. Because parasites rely on their hosts, host-parasite cospeciation events are likely.|$|E
5|$|The {{subject of}} the series, whose name was never released, was an {{intersex}} person with a male build and stature, but who may have self-identified as female and/or been assigned female at birth. The subject had a small, probably hypospadic, penis, rudimentary scrotum, and male <b>pubic</b> hair pattern. The subject also had a retracted or rudimentary clitoral hood and vaginal opening. In most photographs the subject's face and chest are covered.|$|E
5|$|By 1824, the {{material}} available to Buckland consisted of specimen OUM J13505, {{a piece of}} a right lower jaw with a single erupted tooth; OUM J13577, a posterior dorsal vertebra; OUM J13579, an anterior caudal vertebra; OUM J13576, a sacrum of five sacral vertebrae; OUM J13585, a cervical rib; OUM J13580, a rib; OUM J29881, an ilium of the pelvis, OUM J13563, a piece of the <b>pubic</b> bone; OUM J13565, a part of the ischium; OUM J13561, a thighbone and OUM J13572, the lower part of a second metatarsal. As he himself was aware, these did not all belong to the same individual; only the sacrum was articulated. Because they represented several individuals, the described fossils formed a syntype series. By modern standards, from these a single specimen has to be selected to serve as the type specimen on which the name is based. In 1990, Ralph Molnar chose the famous dentary (front part of the lower jaw), OUM J13505, as such a lectotype. Because he was unaccustomed to the deep dinosaurian pelvis, much taller than with typical reptiles, Buckland misidentified several bones, interpreting the <b>pubic</b> bone as a fibula and mistaking the ischium for a clavicle. Buckland identified the organism as being a giant animal belonging to the Sauria – the Lizards, at the time seen as including the crocodiles – and he placed it in the new genus Megalosaurus, repeating an estimate by Cuvier that the largest pieces he described, indicated an animal twelve metres long in life.|$|E
5|$|During early {{childhood}} androgen synthesis and secretion remain low, but {{several years before}} puberty (from 6–8 years of age) changes occur in both anatomical and functional aspects of cortical androgen production that lead to increased secretion of the steroids DHEA and DHEA-S. These changes {{are part of a}} process called adrenarche, which has only been described in humans and some other primates. Adrenarche is independent of ACTH or gonadotropins and correlates with a progressive thickening of the zona reticularis layer of the cortex. Functionally, adrenarche provides a source of androgens for the development of axillary and <b>pubic</b> hair before the beginning of puberty.|$|E
5|$|Genetic {{evidence}} suggests that our human ancestors acquired <b>pubic</b> lice from gorillas approximately 3-4 million years ago. Unlike the genus Pediculus, the divergence in Phthirus does not match the age of host divergence that likely occurred 7 million years ago. Reed et al. propose a Phthirus species host-switch around 3-4 million years ago. While {{it is difficult to}} determine if a parasite-host switch occurred in evolutionary history, this explanation is the most parsimonious (containing the fewest evolutionary changes).|$|E
5|$|Opisthocoelicaudia {{may have}} been able to rear up on its hindlimbs for foraging, using its tail as a third leg. In 1977, Borsuk-Białynicka cited several {{skeletal}} features that might have been related to rearing, including the opisthocoelous vertebrae of the anterior part of the tail, which, according to this author, would have made the tail more flexible than in other sauropods. Features of the pelvis, such as the thickened shelf of the acetabulum, the flaring ilia, and the fused <b>pubic</b> symphysis, may have allowed the pelvis to withstand the stress of rearing.|$|E
5|$|Reptilian lungs {{typically}} receive air via {{expansion and}} contraction of the ribs driven by axial muscles and buccal pumping. Crocodilians also {{rely on the}} hepatic piston method, in which the liver is pulled back by a muscle anchored to the <b>pubic</b> bone (part of the pelvis) called the diaphragmaticus, which in turn creates negative pressure in the crocodile's thoracic cavity, allowing air to be moved into the lungs by Boyle's law. Turtles, which are unable to move their ribs, instead use their forelimbs and pectoral girdle to force air {{in and out of}} the lungs.|$|E
5|$|The {{clitoral}} hood {{projects at}} the front of the labia commissure, where the edges of the labia majora (outer lips) meet at the base of the <b>pubic</b> mound; it forms as part of the external folds of the labia minora (inner lips) and covers the glans and external shaft. There is considerable variation in how much of the glans protrudes from the hood and how much is covered by it, ranging from completely covered to fully exposed, and tissue of the labia minora also encircles the base of the glans.|$|E
5|$|The {{presence}} of Acrocanthosaurus in the Cloverly Formation {{was established in}} 2012 with the description of another partial skeleton, UM20796. This specimen, consisting of parts of two vertebrae, partial <b>pubic</b> bones, a femur, a partial fibula, and fragments, represents a juvenile animal. It came from a bonebed in the Bighorn Basin of north-central Wyoming, and was found near the shoulder blade of a Sauroposeidon. An assortment of other fragmentary theropod remains from the formation may also belong to Acrocanthosaurus, {{which may be the}} only large theropod in the Cloverly Formation.|$|E
5|$|Another {{prominent}} early anthropologist, Thomas Wingate Todd, {{was primarily}} responsible {{for the creation of}} the first large collection of human skeletons in 1912. In total, Todd acquired 3,300 human skulls and skeletons, 600 anthropoid skulls and skeletons, and 3,000 mammalian skulls and skeletons. Todd's contributions to the field of anthropology remain in use in the modern era and include various studies regarding suture closures on the skull and timing of teeth eruption in the mandible. Todd also developed age estimates based on physical characteristics of the <b>pubic</b> symphysis. Though the standards have been updated, these estimates are still used by forensic anthropologists to narrow down an age range of skeletonized remains. These early pioneers legitimized the field of anthropology, {{but it was not until}} the 1940s, with the help of Todd's student, Wilton M. Krogman, that forensic anthropology gained recognition as a legitimate subdiscipline.|$|E
5|$|Apart {{from the}} neotype, other fossils are known of Scelidosaurus. In 1888 Lydekker catalogued {{a large number}} of single bones, largely limb elements, and osteoderms, that had been {{acquired}} by the BMNH from the Norris collection. Owen in 1861 described a second, partial, skeleton of a juvenile animal, that later was added to the collection of Elizabeth Philpot and today is registered in the Lyme Regis Museum as specimen LYMPH 1997.37.4-10. As it was relatively large, Owen speculated, in the context of its presumed marine lifestyle, that Scelidosaurus might have been ovoviviparous. The short prepubis in this specimen convinced scientists that this process did not represent the main <b>pubic</b> body as some had thought, who had been unable to believe that the thin, backward-pointing, pubis with the Ornithischia was homologous to the forward-pointing much larger <b>pubic</b> bone in most reptilian groups. In more recent times, new discoveries have been made at Charmouth, not through commercial quarrying but by the efforts of amateur palaeontologists. In 1968 a second partial juvenile skeleton was described, specimen BMNH R6704, that had already been reported in 1959. Found by geologist James Frederick Jackson (1894-1966) of Charmouth, it is from a slightly younger layer, the Stonebarrow Marl Member dating to the early Pliensbachian, about 190 million years old. In 1985 Simon Barnsley, David Costain and Peter Langham excavated a partial skeleton including a very complete skull and skin impressions, which was sold to the Bristol Museum where it is registered as specimen BRSMG CE12785. Specimen CAMSMX.39256 is part of the collection of the Sedgwick Museum at Cambridge. Several specimens remain undescribed because they are in private collections. These include a two metres (7ft) long skeleton found by David Sole in 2000, perhaps the most complete non-avian dinosaur exemplar ever discovered in the British Isles. All elements of the skeleton are now known. The finds by Sole differ from the neotype in details of the armour and might represent a separate taxon or reflect sexual dimorphism.|$|E
5|$|From there, {{the story}} becomes more complex. Apparently, the {{skeleton}} was {{scattered throughout the}} quarry, with the remains being recovered from September 1879 to September 1880. Marsh elected to place some of the material in a new species, C. agilis, {{on the strength of}} a pair of fused <b>pubic</b> bones he thought belonged to an animal {{three times the size of}} C. fragilis. He returned to the genus in 1888 to add C". gracilis, based on unknown remains only represented today by a single claw bone pertaining to a small theropod from the Early Cretaceous Arundel Formation of Maryland. This species is not currently accepted as representing Coelurus in reviews of the genus, but has not been given its own genus.|$|E
5|$|In 1981, {{the then}} 68-year-old Takechi {{decided to return}} to film with a series of {{theatrical}} hardcore films, beginning with a remake of his 1964 Daydream, also titled Daydream. Noticing actress Kyōko Aizome in one of her nude photo magazine appearances, Takechi chose her to star in the film. Japan's first theatrically released film featuring hardcore sex, Aizome added to the controversy surrounding the film by admitting to having performed actual sexual intercourse on camera. Though, as Japanese law required, sexual organs and <b>pubic</b> hair were fogged on screen, the Asahi Shimbun called it a breakthrough film, and Japan's first hardcore pornographic movie. Takechi took a novel, yet traditional approach to the fogging by covering the forbidden areas with floating images of topless female shamisen players. Unlike Takechi's earlier Dream of the Red Chamber, the full, uncensored version of Daydream 1981 did survive, and circulated underground in Japan. This uncensored version of the film was released on video at one time in the Netherlands.|$|E
5|$|It is {{important}} for forensic anthropologists {{to take into account}} all available markers in the determination of sex due to the differences that can occur between individuals of the same sex. For example, it is possible that a female may have a slightly more narrow than normal <b>pubic</b> arch. It {{is for this reason that}} anthropologists usually classify sex as one of five possibilities: male, may be male, indeterminate, may be female, or female. In addition, forensic anthropologists are generally unable to make a sex determination unless the individual was an adult at the time of death. The sexual dimorphisms present in the skeleton begin to occur during puberty and are not fully pronounced until after sexual maturation.|$|E
5|$|On January 8, 2009, an 18-year-old male {{member of}} Anonymous {{ran into the}} New York Scientology {{building}} shirtless and covered with Vaseline, <b>pubic</b> hair, and toenail clippings. He then proceeded to toss books around and smear the mixture on objects in the building. The man, identified by police as Mahoud Samed Almahadin, was charged with burglary, criminal mischief, and aggravated harassment as hate crimes. Two weeks later, 21-year-old film student and Anonymous member Jacob Speregen was charged with aggravated harassment and criminal mischief as hate crimes after he filmed Almahadin carrying out his prank. According {{to his mother and}} the video, Speregen was filming the event from behind the barricade. Scientology critics Mark Bunker and Jason Beghe disagreed with the individual's actions.|$|E
5|$|The ilium of {{the pelvis}} had a convex upper border, a low postacetabular blade (behind the acetabulum), and a narrow brevis-shelf (a {{projection}} where tail muscles attached). The <b>pubic</b> foot was pronounced and shorter {{at the front}} than behind. The ischium was straight and expanded hindwards, ending in a lobe-shape. The femur was sigmoid-shaped, and had a very robust, upwards pointing head, with a deep sulcus (groove). The lesser trochanter of the femoral head was wing-like, and placed below the greater trochanter, which was short. The fourth trochanter was large and projected backwards. The tibia of the lower leg was expanded at the upper end, its articular facet (where it articulated with the femur) was wide, and its shaft was compressed from front to back.|$|E
5|$|The panel {{captures the}} instant of Christ's death, {{traditionally}} the moment after {{the breaking of}} the thieves' legs (although this is not depicted). Christ is naked except for a transparent veil, with some of his <b>pubic</b> hair visible. His hands and feet are nailed to the timber; the blood from the nail holding his feet to the cross stains its wooden base. His arms strain under the weight of his upper body, and in his final agony, his jaw has fallen slack; his mouth is open with his teeth exposed in the grimace of death. In the mid-ground, {{at the base of the}} cross, Longinus, on horseback, wearing a fur-trimmed hat and green tunic, guided by an assistant, stretches to pierce Jesus' side with a lance, as deep-red blood pours from the wound. To the right of Longinus, a mostly obscured Stephaton holds high a sponge soaked with vinegar on the tip of a reed.|$|E
5|$|Traces of red pigment {{still remain}} on the figure's body that was {{originally}} painted red overall. The feathers of her wings and the owls' feathers were also colored red, alternating with black and white. By Raman spectroscopy the red pigment is identified as red ochre, the black pigment, amorphous carbon ("lamp black") and the white pigment gypsum. Black pigment is also found on {{the background of the}} plaque, the hair and eyebrows, and on the lions' manes. The <b>pubic</b> triangle and the areola appear accentuated with red pigment but were not separately painted black. The lions' bodies were painted white. The British Museum curators assume that the horns of the headdress and part of the necklace were originally colored yellow, just as they are on a very similar clay figure from Ur. They surmise that the bracelets and rod-and-ring symbols might also have been painted yellow. However, no traces of yellow pigment now {{remain on the}} relief.|$|E
5|$|Allosaurus coexisted {{with fellow}} large theropods Ceratosaurus and Torvosaurus {{in both the}} United States and Portugal. The three appear to have had {{different}} ecological niches, based on anatomy {{and the location of}} fossils. Ceratosaurs and torvosaurs may have preferred to be active around waterways, and had lower, thinner bodies that would have given them an advantage in forest and underbrush terrains, whereas allosaurs were more compact, with longer legs, faster but less maneuverable, and seem to have preferred dry floodplains. Ceratosaurus, better known than Torvosaurus, differed noticeably from Allosaurus in functional anatomy by having a taller, narrower skull with large, broad teeth. Allosaurus was itself a potential food item to other carnivores, as illustrated by an Allosaurus <b>pubic</b> foot marked by the teeth of another theropod, probably Ceratosaurus or Torvosaurus. The location of the bone in the body (along the bottom margin of the torso and partially shielded by the legs), {{and the fact that it}} was among the most massive in the skeleton, indicates that the Allosaurus was being scavenged.|$|E
5|$|From 1277, Stratton {{acted in}} the {{capacity}} as Countess Isabella's steward, though he never officially used that title. It was in this post that he committed {{some of his most}} grievous offences. In 1278 he was accused of cutting off the seal of a charter from Quarr Abbey, thereby invalidating its authenticity. As a result, several other similar cases were brought to light, but none led to conviction. It was widely believed that he had bought himself off with bribes. Stratton's transgressions continued however, and by the late 1280s the complaints reached King Edward I. Edward returned from a prolonged stay in Gascony in late 1289, and immediately started a purge of corruption in the royal administration, including proceedings against Ralph de Hengham, Chief Justice of the King's Bench. Stratton was relieved of his office of chamberlain, along with his temporal possessions, on 17 January 1290. On his arrest, £12,666 17s 7d was found in his possession, a vast sum at the time, equivalent to about £ in present-day terms. According to the chronicle of Bartholomew Cotton, a silk-lined chest was also discovered, containing fingernail and toenail clippings, women's <b>pubic</b> hair, and feet of toads and moles. These were considered the ingredients of witchcraft, and the box was sealed up by officials, but Stratton managed to break the seal and throw the contents down a latrine.|$|E
5|$|In August 1993, police raided Jackson's home and, {{according}} to court documents, found books and photographs in his bedroom featuring young boys {{with little or no}} clothing. Since the books were legal to purchase and own, the jury decided not to indict Jackson. Jordan Chandler gave police a description of Jackson's intimate parts; a strip search revealed that Jordan had correctly claimed Jackson had patchy-colored buttocks, short <b>pubic</b> hair, and pink and brown marked testicles. Reportedly, Jordan had also drawn accurate pictures of a dark spot on Jackson's penis only visible when his penis was lifted. Despite differing initial internal reports from prosecutors and investigators, with reports of jurors feeling that the photos did not match the description, the DA stated his belief in a sworn affidavit that the description was accurate, along with the sheriff's photographer stating the description was accurate. A 2004 motion filed by Jackson's defense asserted that Jackson was never criminally indicted by any grand jury and that his settlement admitted no wrongdoing and contained no evidence of criminal misconduct.|$|E
5|$|Lice {{are divided}} into two groups: sucking lice, which obtain their {{nourishment}} from feeding on the sebaceous secretions and body fluids of their host; and chewing lice, which are scavengers, feeding on skin, fragments of feathers or hair, and debris found on the host's body. Most are found on only specific types of animals, and, in some cases, on only a particular part of the body; some animals are known to host up to fifteen different species, although one to three is typical for mammals, and two to six for birds. For example, in humans, different species of louse inhabit the scalp and <b>pubic</b> hair. Lice generally cannot survive for long if removed from their host. Some species of chewing lice house symbiotic bacteria in bacteriocytes in their bodies. These may assist in digestion because if the insect is deprived of them, it will die. If their host dies, lice can opportunistically use phoresis to hitch a ride on a fly and attempt {{to find a new}} host.|$|E
5|$|Nemegtomaia is {{estimated}} to have been around 2m (7ft) in length, and to have weighed 40kg (85lb), a size extrapolated from more completely known relatives. As an oviraptorosaur, {{it would have been}} feathered. The neural spines of the neck (cervical) vertebrae were short, and the neural arches had an x-shaped appearance. The middle three of these vertebrae were the largest. The scapula (shoulder blade) appears to have been 185mm (7in) in total length. The humerus (upper arm bone) had a fossa (depression) in a position similar to modern birds, but atypical among oviraptorosaurs, and appears to have been 152mm (6in) long. The radius of the lower arm was straight, oval in cross-section, and may have been 144mm (5in) long. The first finger was relatively large and had a strong ungual (claw bone), and was more massive than the two other fingers. The second finger was slightly longer than the first, and the third finger was the smallest. The upper margin of the ilium of the pelvis was straight, and though both ilia were close to each other, they were not fused together. The <b>pubic</b> shaft was turned backwards. The femur (thigh bone) {{is estimated}} to have been 286mm (11in) long, and the tibia of the lower leg 317mm long (12in).|$|E
5|$|Proposed in 1987 by Brinkman and Sues, Herrerasaurus has {{at times}} been {{considered}} basal to Ornithischia and Saurischia, although Brinkmann and Sues still considered {{it to be}} inside Dinosauria. They supported this {{on the basis that}} Herrerasaurus has a large pedal digit V, and has a well developed medial wall on the acetabulum. Brinkmann and Sues considered Staurikosaurus and Herrerasaurus to not form a true group called Herrerasauridae, and that instead they were successively more primitive forms. Also, they considered the characters used by Benedetto to be invalid, instead representing only the plesiomorphic state that was found in both taxa. This was disagreed with in 1992 by Novas, who stated many derived synapomorphies of Herrerasauridae, such as a distinct <b>pubic</b> boot, but still classified them as basal to Ornithischia and Saurischia. Novas defined the family as the least common ancestor of Herrerasaurus and Staurikosaurus and all its descendants. A differing definition of Herrerasaurus but not Passer domesticus first suggested by Sereno (1998), and more closely follows the original inclusion proposed by Benedetto. Another group, Herrerasauria was named by Galton in 1985, and defined as Herrerasaurus but not Liliensternus or Plateosaurus by Langer (2004), who used the node-based definition for Herrerasauridae.|$|E
5|$|The {{distinctive}} dromaeosaurid {{body plan}} helped to rekindle theories {{that at least}} some dinosaurs may have been active, fast, and closely related to birds. Robert Bakker's illustration for John Ostrom's 1969 monograph, showing the dromaeosaurid Deinonychus in a fast run, is among the most influential paleontological reconstructions in history. The dromaeosaurid body plan includes a relatively large skull, serrated teeth, narrow snout, and forward-facing eyes which indicate some degree of binocular vision. Dromaeosaurids, like most other theropods, had a moderately long S-curved neck, and their trunk was relatively short and deep. Like other maniraptorans, they had long arms that could be folded against the body in some species, and relatively large hands with three long fingers (the middle finger being the longest and the first finger being the shortest) ending in large claws. The dromaeosaurid hip structure featured a characteristically large <b>pubic</b> boot projecting beneath the base of the tail. Dromaeosaurid feet bore a large, recurved claw on the second toe. Their tails were slender, with long, low, vertebrae lacking transverse process and neural spines after the 14th caudal vertebra.|$|E
5|$|Allosaurus {{had nine}} {{vertebrae}} in the neck, 14 in the back, and {{five in the}} sacrum supporting the hips. The number of tail vertebrae is unknown and varied with individual size; James Madsen estimated about 50, while Gregory S. Paul considered that to be too many and suggested 45 or less. There were hollow spaces in the neck and anterior back vertebrae. Such spaces, which are also found in modern theropods (that is, the birds), are interpreted as having held air sacs used in respiration. The rib cage was broad, giving it a barrel chest, especially in comparison to less derived theropods like Ceratosaurus. Allosaurus had gastralia (belly ribs), {{but these are not}} common findings, and they may have ossified poorly. In one published case, the gastralia show evidence of injury during life. A furcula (wishbone) was also present, but has only been recognized since 1996; in some cases furculae were confused with gastralia. The ilium, the main hip bone, was massive, and the <b>pubic</b> bone had a prominent foot that may have been used for both muscle attachment and as a prop for resting the body on the ground. Madsen noted that in about half of the individuals from the Cleveland-Lloyd Dinosaur Quarry, independent of size, the pubes had not fused to each other at their foot ends. He suggested that this was a sexual characteristic, with females lacking fused bones to make egg-laying easier. This proposal has not attracted further attention, however.|$|E
5|$|He {{suffered}} a stress fracture to the <b>pubic</b> bone which {{kept him out}} {{for more than three}} months from November 2007 until he returned to first-team action for Middlesbrough's 2–0 FA Cup victory over Mansfield Town on 26 January 2008. He was sent off in the 80th minute in a match against Arsenal on 15 March 2008 after kicking Gaël Clichy in the face with his boot, which resulted in him receiving a three-match ban. Mido was ruled out {{for the remainder of the}} 2007–08 season in April following a hernia operation on a pelvic injury. He made the bench for Middlesbrough's opening Premier League fixture against former club Tottenham and came on as a substitute in the 82nd minute and scored four minutes later after deflecting Didier Digard's shot. The following weekend saw him score against Liverpool at Anfield to put Middlesbrough 1–0 in the lead, but they eventually lost the game 2–1. This was followed up with goals against Yeovil Town in the League Cup and Portsmouth in the league. Mido was again targeted by some Newcastle fans while warming up before Middlesbrough's 0–0 draw, with claims of racist chanting being investigated by The FA. He revealed his anger at The FA's investigation, believing that they would make no difference to any future abuse. Two men were eventually arrested over the chanting and were due to appear at Teesside Magistrates Court.|$|E
25|$|<b>Pubic</b> hair {{patterns}} {{can vary}} {{by race and}} ethnicity. Patterns of <b>pubic</b> hair, known as the escutcheon, vary between sexes. On most women, the <b>pubic</b> patch is triangular and lies over the vulva and mons pubis. On many men, the <b>pubic</b> patch tapers upwards to a line of hair pointing towards the navel (see abdominal hair), roughly a more upward-pointing triangle. As with axillary (armpit) hair, <b>pubic</b> hair {{is associated with a}} concentration of sebaceous glands in the area.|$|E
25|$|In ancient Egyptian art, female <b>pubic</b> hair is {{indicated}} {{in the form of}} painted triangles. In medieval and classical European art, <b>pubic</b> hair was very rarely depicted, and male <b>pubic</b> hair was often, but not always, omitted. Sometimes it was portrayed in stylized form, {{as was the case with}} Greek graphic art. The same was true in much of Indian art, and in other Eastern portrayals of the nude. In 16th century southern Europe, Michelangelo showed the male David with stylized <b>pubic</b> hair, but female bodies were depicted hairless below the head. Nevertheless, Michelangelo's male nudes on the Sistine Chapel ceiling display no <b>pubic</b> hair. In Renaissance northern Europe, <b>pubic</b> hair was more likely to be portrayed than in the south, more usually male, while occasionally on female figures.|$|E
25|$|The <b>pubic</b> {{symphysis}} or {{symphysis pubis}} is the midline cartilaginous joint (secondary cartilaginous) uniting the superior rami {{of the left}} and right <b>pubic</b> bones. It is located anterior to the urinary bladder and superior to it. In males, the suspensory ligament of the penis attaches to the <b>pubic</b> symphysis. In females, the <b>pubic</b> symphysis is intimately close to the clitoris. In normal adults it can be moved roughly 2mm and with 1 degree rotation. This increases for women at the time of childbirth.|$|E
