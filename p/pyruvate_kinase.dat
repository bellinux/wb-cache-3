5|$|In glycolysis, glucose and {{glycerol}} are metabolized to pyruvate. Glycolysis generates two equivalents of ATP through substrate phosphorylation catalyzed by two enzymes, PGK and <b>pyruvate</b> <b>kinase.</b> Two equivalents of NADH {{are also}} produced, {{which can be}} oxidized via the electron transport chain and result in the generation of additional ATP by ATP synthase. The pyruvate generated as an end-product of glycolysis is a substrate for the Krebs Cycle.|$|E
5|$|Of {{concern to}} breeders is the {{condition}} known as uterine inertia, {{an inability to}} expel the foetus due to weak muscles. This condition was present {{in one of the}} foundation cats and appears in some Singapura females today. Individuals with uterine inertia may require deliveries to be made by Caesarean section. Another issue that affects the breed is <b>Pyruvate</b> <b>kinase</b> deficiency, which leads to hemolytic anemia. Typical symptoms includes lethargy, diarrhea, lack of appetite, poor coat quality, weight loss and jaundice.|$|E
5|$|In glycolysis, {{hexokinase}} {{is directly}} inhibited by its product, glucose-6-phosphate, and <b>pyruvate</b> <b>kinase</b> is inhibited by ATP itself. The main control {{point for the}} glycolytic pathway is phosphofructokinase (PFK), which is allosterically inhibited by high concentrations of ATP and activated by high concentrations of AMP. The inhibition of PFK by ATP is unusual, since ATP is also a substrate in the reaction catalyzed by PFK; the active form of the enzyme is a tetramer that exists in two conformations, only one of which binds the second substrate fructose-6-phosphate (F6P). The protein has two binding sites for ATP– the active site is accessible in either protein conformation, but ATP binding to the inhibitor site stabilizes the conformation that binds F6P poorly. A number of other small molecules can compensate for the ATP-induced shift in equilibrium conformation and reactivate PFK, including cyclic AMP, ammonium ions, inorganic phosphate, and fructose-1,6- and -2,6-biphosphate.|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe {{provision}} of a high-fat diet (47 % of energy as fat) for 28 days {{led to a}} significant increase in hepatic <b>pyruvate</b> dehydrogenase <b>kinase</b> activity, together with significant suppression of hepatic pyruvate dehydrogenase (active form). An enhanced hepatic <b>pyruvate</b> dehydrogenase <b>kinase</b> activity continued to be observed at 6 h after the withdrawal of the high-fat diet. Significant suppression of hepatic <b>pyruvate</b> dehydrogenase <b>kinase</b> activity was observed in post-absorptive, high-fat-fed rats after a 2. 5 h euglycaemic-hyperinsulinaemic clamp, such that differences in <b>pyruvate</b> dehydrogenase <b>kinase</b> activities between control and high-fat-fed rats were no longer evident. Starvation for 24 h in rats previously maintained on standard diet also evoked a substantial increase in hepatic <b>pyruvate</b> dehydrogenase <b>kinase</b> activity. This latter response was only partially reversed by 2. 5 h of euglycaemic hyperinsulinaemia. Suppression of <b>pyruvate</b> dehydrogenase <b>kinase</b> activity by 2. 5 h euglycaemic hyperinsulinaemia in high-fat-fed rats was associated with a substantial increase in hepatic pyruvate dehydrogenase activity (active form) whereas no significant increase in hepatic pyruvate dehydrogenase activity (active form) was observed after 2. 5 h euglycaemic hyperinsulinaemia in 24 h-starved rats. The results are consistent with the proposition that hepatic <b>pyruvate</b> dehydrogenase <b>kinase</b> responds directly to an increase in lipid oxidation which is facilitated by insulin deficiency or an impaired action of insulin...|$|R
25|$|<b>Pyruvate</b> <b>kinase</b> (PK) deficiency, {{also called}} {{erythrocyte}} <b>pyruvate</b> <b>kinase</b> deficiency, is an inherited metabolic disorder of the enzyme <b>pyruvate</b> <b>kinase.</b> In this condition, {{a lack of}} <b>pyruvate</b> <b>kinase</b> slows down the process of glycolysis. This effect is especially devastating in cells that lack mitochondria, because these cells must use anaerobic glycolysis as their sole source of energy because the TCA cycle is not available. One example is red blood cells, which {{in a state of}} <b>pyruvate</b> <b>kinase</b> deficiency rapidly become deficient in ATP and can undergo hemolysis. Therefore, <b>pyruvate</b> <b>kinase</b> deficiency can cause hemolytic anemia.|$|E

30|$|<b>Pyruvate</b> {{dehydrogenase}} <b>kinase</b> 1 {{deficiency in}} F. graminearum {{resulted in an}} increase in pyruvate dehydrogenase activity, causing growth retardation and increased pigmentation (Gao et al. 2016). Inhibition of <b>pyruvate</b> dehydrogenase <b>kinase</b> has been suggested as a therapeutic approach for the development of anticancer drugs (Steták et al. 2007).

30|$|Both the peptide and mRNA {{were down}} {{regulated}} for pyruvate dehydrogenase, which produces acetyl-CoA from pyruvate in mitochondria, by agmatine addition. Conversely, the mRNA content of <b>pyruvate</b> dehydrogenase <b>kinase,</b> which phosphorylates <b>pyruvate</b> dehydrogenase and inhibits {{the influx of}} pyruvic acid into mitochondria, was up regulated. Unfortunately, the peptide of <b>pyruvate</b> dehydrogenase <b>kinase</b> could not be detected in this experiment. <b>Pyruvate</b> dehydrogenase <b>kinase</b> is an important mitochondrial enzyme that blocks the production of acetyl-CoA by selectively inhibiting the activity of pyruvate dehydrogenase through phosphorylation. <b>Pyruvate</b> dehydrogenase <b>kinase</b> is up regulated in cancer cells, which {{is considered to be}} one of the factors contributing to the up regulation of glycolytic metabolism in cancer cells (Zhang et al. 2014).|$|R

25|$|Glycolytic {{mutations}} {{are generally}} rare due to {{importance of the}} metabolic pathway, {{this means that the}} majority of occurring mutations result in an inability for the cell to respire, and therefore cause the death of the cell at an early stage.

25|$|An {{appropriate}} {{example is}} <b>pyruvate</b> <b>kinase</b> (see first figure), a glycolytic enzyme that {{plays an important}} role in regulating the flux from fructose-1,6-biphosphate to pyruvate. It contains an all-β nucleotide binding domain (in blue), an α/β-substrate binding domain (in grey) and an α/β-regulatory domain (in olive green), connected by several polypeptide linkers.

25|$|The TIM-barrel in <b>pyruvate</b> <b>kinase</b> is 'discontinuous', {{meaning that}} more than one segment of the {{polypeptide}} is required to form the domain.

50|$|Pyruvate {{dehydrogenase}} (E1) {{is one of}} {{the three}} components (E1, E2, and E3) of the large pyruvate dehydrogenase complex. <b>Pyruvate</b> dehydrogenase <b>kinases</b> catalyze phosphorylation of serine residues of E1 to inactivate the E1 component and inhibit the complex. Pyruvate dehydrogenase phosphatases catalyze the dephosphorylation and activation of the E1 component to reverse the effects of <b>pyruvate</b> dehydrogenase <b>kinases.</b> <b>Pyruvate</b> dehydrogenase phosphatase is a heterodimer consisting of catalytic and regulatory subunits. Two catalytic subunits have been reported; one is predominantly expressed in skeletal muscle and another one is much more abundant in the liver. The catalytic subunit, encoded by this gene, is the former, and belongs to the protein phosphatase 2C (PP2C) superfamily. Along with the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex and <b>pyruvate</b> dehydrogenase <b>kinases,</b> this enzyme is located in the mitochondrial matrix.|$|R
25|$|As PEPCK acts at the {{junction}} between glycolysis and the Krebs cycle, it causes decarboxylation of a C4 molecule, creating a C3 molecule. As the first committed step in gluconeogenesis, PEPCK decarboxylates and phosphorylates oxaloacetate (OAA) for its conversion to PEP, when GTP is present. As a phosphate is transferred, the reaction results in a GDP molecule. When <b>pyruvate</b> <b>kinase</b> - the enzyme that normally catalyzes the reaction that converts PEP to pyruvate - is knocked out in mutants of Bacillus subtilis, PEPCK participates {{in one of the}} replacement anaplerotic reactions, working in the reverse direction of its normal function, converting PEP to OAA. Although this reaction is possible, the kinetics are so unfavorable that the mutants grow at a very slow pace or do not grow at all.|$|E
2500|$|Liver <b>pyruvate</b> <b>kinase</b> is {{indirectly}} {{regulated by}} epinephrine and glucagon, through protein kinase A. This protein kinase phosphorylates liver <b>pyruvate</b> <b>kinase</b> to deactivate it. Muscle <b>pyruvate</b> <b>kinase</b> is not inhibited by epinephrine activation of protein kinase A. Glucagon signals fasting (no glucose available). Thus, glycolysis is inhibited {{in the liver}} but unaffected in muscle when fasting. [...] An increase in blood sugar leads to secretion of insulin, which activates phosphoprotein phosphatase I, leading to dephosphorylation and activation of <b>pyruvate</b> <b>kinase.</b> These controls prevent <b>pyruvate</b> <b>kinase</b> from being active {{at the same time}} as the enzymes that catalyze the reverse reaction (pyruvate carboxylase and phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase), preventing a futile cycle.|$|E

40|$|Tyrphostins inhibit tryosine kinases {{and have}} {{little effect on}} the {{activity}} of serine/threonine <b>kinases.</b> <b>Pyruvate</b> dehydrogenase <b>kinase</b> inactivates <b>pyruvate</b> dehydrogenase by phosphorylating serine residues within the multienzyme complex.

Experiments designed to determine if the tyrphostins altered pyruvate dehydrogenase activity in mitochondria prepared from rat epididymal adipocytes using [l- 14 C]-pyruvate as the sub strate demonstrated a dose dependent increase in enzyme activity in the presence of tyrphostin 47, but not in tyrphostin 23. This apparent stimula tion of pyruvate dehydrogenase activity was attributed to tyrphostin 47 ’s ability to nonenzymatically decarboxylate [l- 14 C]-pyruvate, the substrate for the pyruvate dehydrogenase assay. Neither tyrphostin directly altered <b>pyruvate</b> dehydrogenase <b>kinase</b> activity.

2500|$|When glucose {{has been}} {{converted}} into G6P by hexokinase or glucokinase, it can either be converted to glucose-1-phosphate (G1P) for conversion to glycogen, or it is alternatively converted by glycolysis to pyruvate, which enters the mitochondrion where it is converted into acetyl-CoA and then into citrate. Excess citrate is exported from the mitochondrion back into to the cytosol, where ATP citrate lyase regenerates acetyl-CoA and oxaloacetate (OAA). The acetyl-CoA is then used for fatty acid synthesis and cholesterol synthesis, two important ways of utilizing excess glucose when its concentration is high in blood. The rate limiting enzymes catalyzing these reactions perform these functions when they have been dephosphorylated through the action of insulin on the liver cells. [...] Between meals, during fasting, exercise or hypoglycemia, glucagon and epinephrine are released into the blood. This causes liver glycogen to be converted back to G6P, and then converted to glucose by the liver-specific enzyme glucose 6-phosphatase and released into the blood. Glucagon and epinephrine also stimulate gluconeogenesis, which coverts non-carbohydrate substrates into G6P, which joins the G6P derived from glycogen, or substitutes for it when the liver glycogen store have been depleted. This is critical for brain function, since the brain utilizes glucose as an energy source under most conditions. The simultaneously phosphorylation of, particularly, phosphofructokinase, but also, {{to a certain extent}} <b>pyruvate</b> <b>kinase,</b> prevents glycolysis occurring {{at the same time as}} gluconeogenesis and glycogenolysis.|$|E
