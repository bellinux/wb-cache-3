40|$|A {{review of}} the general chromatographic theory and of {{continuous}} chromatographic techniques has been carried out. Three methods of inversion of sucrose to glucose and fructose in beet molasses were explored. These methods were the inversion of sucrose using the enzyme invertase, {{by the use of}} hydrochloric acid {{and the use of the}} resin Amberlite IR 118 in the H+ form. The preferred method on economic and purity considerations was by the use of the enzyme invertase. The continuous chromatographic separation of inverted beet molasses resulting in a fructose rich product and a product containing glucose and other non-sugars was carried out using a semi-continuous counter-current chromatographic refiner (SCCR 6), consisting of ten 10. 8 cm x 75 cm long stainless steel columns packed with a calcium charged 8 % cross-linked polystyrene resin Zerolit SRC 14. Based on the literature this is the first time such a continuous separation has been attempted. It was found that the cations present in beet molasses displaced the calcium ions from the resin resulting in poor separation of the glucose and fructose. Three methods of maintaining the calcium form of the resin during the continuous operation of the equipment were established. Passing a solution of calcium nitrate through the <b>purge</b> <b>column</b> for half a switch period was found to be most effective as there was no contamination of the main fructose rich product and the product concentrations were increased by 50 %. When a 53 % total solids (53 Brix) molasses feedstock was used, the throughput was 34. 13 kg sugar solids per m 3 of resin per hour. Product purities of 97 % fructose in fructose rich (FRP) and 96 % glucose in the glucose rich (GRP) products were obtained with product concentrations of 10. 93 %w/w for the FRP and 10. 07 %w/w for the GRP. The effects of flowrates, temperature and background sugar concentration on the distribution coefficients of fructose, glucose, betaine and an ionic component of beet molasses were evaluated and general relationships derived. The computer simulation of inverted beet molasses separations on an SCCR system has been carried out successfully...|$|E
50|$|Simon was {{a member}} of the Fifth Column and a friend to Willie. During the Second Invasion, he survived Diana's <b>purge</b> of Fifth <b>Column</b> members and served as Willie's contact in the fleet, giving {{information}} whenever he could, but these acts left him paranoid of being followed by Diana's spies. He met Willie at an abandoned building to warn him of an imminent arrival of weapons to a secret location in the Open City of Los Angeles. Simon's fears of being followed prove to be warranted when two troopers arrive and open fire. Willie is injured and escapes while Simon is killed.|$|R
40|$|Aqueous {{mobile phases}} above pH 8 often cause {{premature}} column failure, limiting {{the utility of}} silica-based columns for applications requiring high pH. Previous studies suggest that covalently bound silane ligands are hydrolyzed and removed by high-pH mobile phases. However, {{we found that the}} siloxane bonds for certain monomeric silanes are hydrolyzed very slowly from silica supports at pH 9 â€“ 10. Therefore, bonded-phase packing degradation at high pH is a result mainly of silica support dissolution. The rate of column degradation for C 18 columns is influenced not only by the type and purity of silica support, but also {{by the nature of the}} silane stationary phase. We found different rates of degradation for several commercial C 18 columns. The relative rates of silica dissolution for these packings were determined by chemically measuring the silicate formed during <b>column</b> <b>purging</b> at high pH. The type and concentration of mobile phase organic modifier also significantly influences column degradation at high pH. Certain silica-based C 18 packings can be used for long periods at pH 9 without significant changes in chromatographic properties. Results of this study better define the practical utility and limitations of silica-based columns in high pH environments...|$|R
40|$|Adsorption {{behaviour}} {{of various}} gases {{have been studied}} in this work for air pre-purification, landfill gas, coal gas, natural gas and flue gas applications. This study included physical adsorption of commonly found impurities in air like carbon dioxide, methane, ethylene, acetylene, nitrous oxide, acetonitrile, methyl tert-butyl ether, methyl sulfoxide, dimethyl sulfoxide and methanol which constitute a safety hazard in the cryogenic air separation plant when present even in small quantities. Henry's law constants and heat of adsorption values were determined using the concentration pulse chromatographic technique for pure and composite adsorbents. It was found that latter performed better for these separations. Single component and binary mixture adsorption isotherms were obtained using constant volume and concentration pulse chromatographic techniques for three gas separation applications: CH 4 -N 2, CO 2 -CH 4 and CO 2 -N 2. Experimental x-y diagrams and equilibrium separation factors determined showed that Ceca 13 X is a promising adsorbent to preferably adsorb CO 2 from N 2 and CO 2 from CH 4. A novel, lab scale two bed advanced dynamic adsorption analysis system was designed and built in-house. Ceca 13 X {{was used in this}} system to study the temperature and concentration profiles in the column, for a composition of 10 % CO 2 (by vol) in N 2 which represented dry flue gas. Column breakthrough experiments were performed to compare the Pressure Swing Adsorption (PSA) process with Thermal Pressure Swing Adsorption (TPSA) process for CO 2 recovery. A novel and yet a simple approach was used to model the non-isothermal adsorption in the fixed bed which exhibited significant heat effects for this system. Also, effects of various operating parameters on the TPSA performance such as purge/feed flow ratio, purge temperature, <b>purge</b> time and <b>column</b> pressure were investigated to optimise the CO 2 recovery. Results indicated that better regeneration conditions used in a TPSA cycle was essential over a PSA cycle for recovering the maximum adsorption capacity of the used 13 X. The developed model indicated to be an adequate representation of the experimental data. It was also observed that purge time had the most significant effect on CO 2 recovery...|$|R
