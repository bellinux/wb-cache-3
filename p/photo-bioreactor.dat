40|$|The aim of {{this work}} was the {{examination}} of the treatment potential of molasses wastewater, by the utilization of activated sludge and microalgae. The systems used included a sequencing batch bioreactor and a similar <b>photo-bioreactor,</b> favoring microalgae growth. The microalgae treatment of molasses wastewater mixture resulted in a considerable reduction in the total nitrogen content. A reduction in the ammonium and nitrate content was observed in the <b>photo-bioreactor,</b> while the effluent's total nitrogen consisted mainly of 50 % organic nitrogen. The transformation of the nitrogen forms in the <b>photo-bioreactor</b> was attributed to microalgae activity, resulting in the production of a better quality effluent. Lower COD removal was observed for the <b>photo-bioreactor</b> than the control, which however increased, by the replacement of the anoxic phase by a long aeration period. The mechanism of nitrogen removal included both the denitrification process during the anoxic stage and the microalgae activities, as the replacement of the anoxic stage resulted in low total nitrogen removal capacities. A decrease in the photobioreactor performance was observed after 35 days of operation due to biofilm formation on the light tube surface, while the operation at higher temperature accelerated microalgae growth, resulting thus in the early failure of the photoreactor...|$|E

40|$|This study {{investigated}} the impact of varying concentrations of tetracycline {{on the performance of}} mixed microalgae-bacteria <b>photo-bioreactors.</b> <b>Photo-bioreactors</b> were assessed for their ability to remove carbon dioxide (CO 2) from the biogas of anaerobic membrane bioreactor (anMBR), and nutrients from the anaerobic effluent. The varying concentrations of tetracycline had no impact on the removal of CO 2 from biogas. 29 % v/v of CO 2 was completely removed to generate > 20 % v/v of oxygen (O 2) in all reactors. Removal of nutrients and biomass was not affected at low concentrations of tetracycline (≤ 150 μg/L), but 20 mg/L of tetracycline lowered the biomass generation and removal efficiencies of phosphate. Conversely, high chlorophyll a and b content was observed at 20 mg/L of tetracycline. High tetracycline level had no impact on the diversity of 18 S rRNA gene-based microalgal communities but adversely affected the 16 S rRNA gene-based microbial communities. Specifically, both Proteobacteria and Bacteroidetes phyla decreased in relative abundance but not phylum Chloroplast. Additionally, both nitrogen-fixing (e. g. Flavobacterium, unclassified Burkholderiales and unclassified Rhizobiaceae) and denitrifying groups (e. g. Hydrogenophaga spp.) were significantly reduced in relative abundance at high tetracycline concentration. Phosphate-accumulating microorganisms, Acinetobacter spp. and Pseudomonas spp. were similarly reduced upon exposure to high tetracycline concentration. Unclassified Comamonadaceae, however, increased in relative abundance, which correlated with an increase in the abundance of tetracycline resistance genes associated with efflux pump mechanism. Overall, the findings demonstrate that antibiotic concentrations in municipal wastewaters will not significantly affect the removal of nutrients by the mixed microalgae-bacteria <b>photo-bioreactors.</b> However, utilizing such <b>photo-bioreactors</b> as a polishing step for anMBRs that treat wastewaters with high tetracycline concentration may not be effective as evidenced from the lower nutrient removal and occurrence of antibiotic resistance genes...|$|R

In this study respiration deficient mutants of Saccharomyces cerevisiae did not show any differences in the productivity of ethanol to their wild types under anaerobic conditions. Under aerobic conditions the wild types remained clearly behind the respiration deficient strains in their productivity of ethanol. The saturation of the cultures with pure oxygen had no short-term effect on the productivity of the respiration deficient strains but it results in a decrease of the long-term stability of not growing cultures.

At the end of the experiment (330 h), 90 % of the initial magnesium (17. 7 mg/L) in the medium was associated with the biomass, of which 4 % was adsorbed and 86 % absorbed by cells. This study was consistent with the kinetic model based on a reversible first-order reaction for Mg 2 + bioaccumulation in C. vulgaris. Mixotrophic growth conditions can be used at industrial scale to increase both the speed and the extent of Mg 2 + uptake by the microalgal...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: The {{cultivation}} of algae in photo-bioreactors shows similarities to crop cultivation in greenhouses, {{especially when the}} reactors are driven by sun light. Advanced methodologies for dynamic optimization and optimal control for greenhouses are known from earlier research. The aim here is to extend these methodologies to microalgae cultivated in a flat plate <b>photo-bioreactor.</b> A one-state space model for the algal biomass in the reactor is presented. The growth rate vs. light curve is parameterized {{on the basis of}} experimental evidence. Spatial distribution of light and growth rate between the plates is also considered. The control variable is the dilution rate. Dynamic optimal control trajectories are presented for various choices of goal function and external solar irradiation trajectories over a horizon of 3 days. It was found that the algae present in the reactor at final time represent a value for the future. Numerical and theoretical results suggest that the control is bang-(singular-) bang, with a strong dependence on the weather. The optimal biomass also depends on the available light, and achieving it to reach a new optimal steady cycle after a prolonged change in weather may take several days. A preliminary theoretical analysis suggests a control law that maximizes the effective growth rate. The analysis shows that like in the greenhouse case, the co-state of the algal biomass plays a pivot role in developing on-line controllers...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: This study {{investigates the}} scaling of <b>photo-bioreactor</b> {{productivity}} {{based on the}} growth of Nannochlor-opsis salina incorporating the effects of direct and diffuse light. The scaling and optimization of photobioreactor geometry was analyzed by determining the growth response of a small-scale system designed to represent a core sample of a large-scale photobioreactor. The small-scale test apparatus was operated {{at a variety of}} light intensities on a batch time scale to generate a photosynthetic irradiance (PI) growth dataset, ultimately used to inform a PI growth model. The validation of the scalability of the PI growthmodel to predict productivity in large-scale systems was done by comparison with experimental growth data collected from two geomet-rically different large-scale photobioreactors operated at a variety of light intensities. For direct comparison, the small-scale and large-scale experimental systems presented were operated similarly and in such a way to incorporate cultiva-tion relevant time scales, light intensities, mixing, and nutrient loads. Validation of the scalability of the PI growth model enables the critical evaluation of different photobior-eactor geometries and design optimization incorporating growth effects from diffuse and direct light. Discussion focuses on the application of the PI growth model to assess the effect of diffuse light growth compared to direct light growth for the evaluation of photobioreactors followed by the use of the model for photobioreactor geometry optimi-zation on the metric of areal productivity...|$|E
40|$|Radiant field {{distribution}} {{is an important}} modeling issue in many systems of practical interest, such as <b>photo-bioreactors</b> for algae growth and heterogeneous photo-catalytic reactors for water detoxification. In this work, a simple radiant field model suitable for dispersed systems showing particle size distributions, is proposed for both dilute and dense two-phase systems. Its main features are: (i) only physical, independently assessable parameters are involved and (ii) its simplicity allows a closed form solution, which makes it suitable for inclusion in a complete photo-reactor model, where also kinetic and fluid dynamic sub-models play a role. A similar model can be derived by making use of concepts developed {{in the realm of}} stereology. The resulting equation is similar, yet not identical, to that obtained with the probabilistic approach, {{due to the fact that}} in stereology the front plane, or the focus plane, may well cut through particles, a circumstance excluded both in the probabilistic model and in actual photoreactors. The two models are compared with pseudo-experimental data obtained by means of Monte Carlo simulations, and the probabilistic model is found to give rise to the best agreement...|$|R
40|$|The {{extensive}} {{amount of}} available information {{on global warming}} suggests that this issue has become prevalent worldwide. Majority of countries have issued laws and policies {{in response to this}} concern by requiring their industrial sectors to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, such as CO 2. Thus, introducing new and more effective treatment methods, such as biological techniques, is crucial to control the emission of greenhouse gases. Many studies have demonstrated CO 2 fixation using <b>photo-bioreactors</b> and raceway ponds, but a comprehensive review is yet to be published on biological CO 2 fixation. A comprehensive review of CO 2 fixation through biological process is presented in this paper as biological processes are ideal to control both organic and inorganic pollutants. This process can also cover the classification of methods, functional mechanisms, designs, and their operational parameters, which are crucial for efficient CO 2 fixation. This review also suggests the bio-trickling filter process as an appropriate approach in CO 2 fixation to assist in creating a pollution-free environment. Finally, this paper introduces optimum designs, growth rate models, and CO 2 fixation of microalgae, functions, and operations in biological CO 2 fixation...|$|R
40|$|International audienceWithin cloud water, {{microorganisms}} are metabolically active and, thus, {{are expected}} {{to contribute to the}} atmospheric chemistry. This article investigates the interactions between microorganisms and the reactive oxygenated species that are present in cloud water because these chemical compounds drive the oxidant capacity of the cloud system. Real cloud water samples with contrasting features (marine, continental, and urban) were taken from the puy de Dôme mountain (France). The samples exhibited a high microbial biodiversity and complex chemical composition. The media were incubated in the dark and subjected to UV radiation in specifically designed <b>photo-bioreactors.</b> The concentrations of H 2 O 2, organic compounds, and the ATP/ADP ratio were monitored during the incubation period. The microorganisms remained metabolically active in the presence of ●OH radicals that were photo-produced from H 2 O 2. This oxidant and major carbon compounds (formaldehyde and carboxylic acids) were biodegraded by the endogenous microflora. This work suggests that microorganisms could play a double role in atmospheric chemistry; first, they could directly metabolize organic carbon species, and second, they could reduce the available source of radicals through their oxidative metabolism. Consequently, molecules such as H 2 O 2 would no longer be available for photochemical or other chemical reactions, which would decrease the cloud oxidant capacity...|$|R
