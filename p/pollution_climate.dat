25|$|The natural {{heritage}} of Brazil is severely threatened by cattle ranching and agriculture, logging, mining, resettlement, {{oil and gas}} extraction, over-fishing, wildlife trade, dams and infrastructure, water <b>pollution,</b> <b>climate</b> change, fire, and invasive species. In {{many areas of the}} country, the natural environment is threatened by development. Construction of highways has opened up previously remote areas for agriculture and settlement; dams have flooded valleys and inundated wildlife habitats; and mines have scarred and polluted the landscape. At least 70 dams are said to be planned for the Amazon region, including the controversial Belo Monte hydroelectric dam.|$|E
25|$|Livestock {{production}} {{is by far}} the biggest cause of land use, as it accounts for 30% of the global land surface. It is probably the leading player in biodiversity loss, as it causes deforestation, land degradation, <b>pollution,</b> <b>climate</b> change, overfishing, and invasions by alien species. Livestock is also responsible for at least 20% of the world's greenhouse gas emissions, which are the main cause of the current climate change. This is due to feed production, enteric fermentation from ruminants, manure storage and processing, and transportation of animal products. The greenhouse gas emissions from livestock production greatly exceeds the greenhouse gas emissions of any other human activity. Some authors argue that by far the best thing we can do to slow climate change is a global shift towards a vegetarian or vegan diet.|$|E

40|$|Simultaneous {{addressing}} air <b>pollution</b> and <b>climate</b> change {{effects on}} forests {{is an opportunity}} for capturing synergies in future research and monitoring. Many air pollutants and greenhouse gases have common sources, contribute to radiative balance, interact in the atmosphere, and affect ecosystems. The impacts on forest ecosystems have been traditionally treated separately for air <b>pollution</b> and <b>climate</b> change. However, the combined effects may significantly differ from a sum of separate effects. We review the links between air <b>pollution</b> and <b>climate</b> change and their interactive effects on northern hemisphere forests. A simultaneous addressing of the air <b>pollution</b> and <b>climate</b> change effects on forests may result in more effective research, management and monitoring as well as better integration of local, national and global environmental policies...|$|R

40|$|Impact of {{environmental}} <b>pollution</b> and <b>climate</b> change on forest ecosystems: {{the activity of}} the IUFRO Research Group 7. 01. The IUFRO RG 7. 01 deals with "Impacts of Air <b>Pollution</b> and <b>Climate</b> Change on Forest Ecosystems". Climate change and air pollution are closely linked, although in applied scientific research and even more in political negotiations they have been largely separated. Many of the traditional air pollutants and greenhouse gases have not only common sources, but may also interact physically and chemically in the atmosphere causing a variety {{of environmental}} impacts on the local, regional and global scales. The impacts on forest ecosystems have been traditionally treated separately for air <b>pollution</b> and <b>climate</b> change. However, the combined effects of numerous climate change and air pollution factors may significantly differ from a sum of separate effects due to an array of various synergistic or antagonistic interactions. The net effect varies for different ecosystem types and geographic regions, and depends on magnitude of <b>climate</b> or air <b>pollution</b> drivers, and types of interactions between them. This paper reviews the links between air <b>pollution</b> and <b>climate</b> change and their interactive effects on forests. A simultaneous addressing of the air <b>pollution</b> and <b>climate</b> change effects on forests is an opportunity for capturing synergies and avoiding overlaps between two lines of traditional research. This could result in more effective research, monitoring and management as well as better integration of environmental policies...|$|R

40|$|In January 1993 {{within the}} {{framework}} of the LIFE programme a project was financed which aim was to develop a deposition monitoring method for air pollution of Europe. This method should be used to extend existing European monitoring networks of air concentrations to provide deposition inputs on an ecosystem scale. A monitoring station for atmospheric deposition was designed and constructed using existing methods. Three such stations were applied in a pilot project for a year on three sites in different regions in Europe to estimate local inputs and to validate deposition models which are currently developed for estimation of ecosystem-specific deposition in Europe. The results of this project show that the developed deposition monitoring method is successful in determining the deposition of pollutants and can be applied on a routine basis. The equipment for flux measurements provided continuous high quality data for all major gaseous and particulate pollutants throughout the range of <b>pollution</b> <b>climates</b> present in Central and Northern Europe. The monitoring facility was therefore highly successful. The sites selected were representative of the major ecosystems of Europe and the range of air <b>pollution</b> <b>climates</b> (excepting urban areas and Mediterranean regions) ...|$|R
