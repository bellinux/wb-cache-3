25|$|Law arrived Washington in {{the summer}} of 1794. He met Greenleaf in November or December 1794 and was deeply {{impressed}} with him. On December 4, 1794, Greenleaf sold 500 city lots to Law for £50,000 (or $133,000). The price <b>per</b> <b>lot</b> was $297.60, a 372 percent increase over the $80 <b>per</b> <b>lot</b> which Greenleaf, Morris, and Nicholson had paid just a year earlier.|$|E
25|$|The Residence Act of 1790, which {{established}} {{the site for}} the nation's capital, provided for the appointment of three commissioners by the President (and without the need for Senate confirmation) to govern the District of Columbia, survey its land, purchase property from private landowners, and construct federal buildings. On September 23, 1793, Greenleaf purchased 3,000 city lots from the commissioners. The city offered him the lots at $66.50 each, a significant discount from the going price of $200 to $300 <b>per</b> <b>lot.</b> To get this low price, Greenleaf was required to construct 70 homes on the lots before 1800, not sell any of the land before 1796, and lend the commissioners $2,200 a month until certain public buildings were constructed. To raise money to improve the lots, Greenleaf executed a power of attorney on November 2, 1793, with Sylvanus Bourne, the American vice consul in Amsterdam. Bourne, who served as vice consul in Amsterdam under Greenleaf, was empowered to sell lots or obtain mortgages on them.|$|E

2500|$|During the 1960s a {{large part}} of the Farm's land was reallocated for the {{construction}} of sorority houses, as a result many of the fruit breeding programs had to be moved to other parts of the state. In the 1990s a new student recreation center and playing fields were created on the site of most of the remaining land, the remaining research programs were moved to the Burden Research Plantation. Today five acres of the original Hill Farm remain and used primarily as an agriculture teaching facility and community garden. Individual garden plots are nine by five feet (9' X 5') and may be rented by students, faculty, and the community at large. The price <b>per</b> <b>lot</b> has been deliberately kept low in order to support the Farm's mission to [...] "provide access to gardening space, education, and resources necessary for the community to grow food in environmentally sustainable ways as a means of creating a food system where locally produced, affordable and nutritious food is available to all, and where the community can come together to share, play, and inspire one another." [...] Although the gardeners are not required to plant certified organic seeds and plants, the Farm does require that gardeners use organic farming methods.|$|E
60|$|The {{proprietor}} of the San Francisco News Letter had determined {{to be at the}} centre of the present excitement in the El Dorado, and to judge for himself, or, rather {{to solve the problem of}} how much gold, how many Indians, and how much humbug, went on board the Pacific mail steam-ship Cortes, Captain Horner, and made the passage to Victoria, 840 miles, in five days. Although nine hundred persons were on board, yet no actual inconvenience was felt by the high-pressure packing; the greatest good humour and accommodating spirit prevailing, controlled by the gentlemanly conduct of Captain J.B. Horner and his officers. On the day of arrival, the operations of the Government Land Office at the fort in Victoria was 26,000 dollars. The importance of the amount can best be realised by comparing it with the prices, viz. 100 dollars <b>per</b> <b>lot,</b> 60 by 100 feet, unsurveyed. Some of these lots have been sold at 200 to 1000 dollars. Lots at first sale, surveyed price, 50 dollars; lots, second and last sale, 100 dollars each, are now being sold from 500 to 1000 dollars each. Six lots together in the principal street are valued at 10,000 dollars. The figures at Esquimault Harbour and lots in that vicinity assume a bolder character as to value, from the fact that the harbour is a granite-bound basin, similar to Victoria, with an entrance now wide and deep enough to admit the Leviathan. Victoria has a bar which must be dredged, dug, or blown away. We noted at Victoria that the most valuable lot, with a flat granite level, with thirty feet of water, sufficient for any ship to unload without jetty, is now covered by a large building constructed of logs, belonging to Samuel Price and Company. A ship was unloading lumber at this wharf at 35 dollars per M, which was the ruling price. At Victoria, on the 21st June, a Frenchman landed from the steamer Surprise, who came on board at Fort Langley with twenty-seven pounds weight of gold on his person, which we saw and lifted. Another passenger, whom we know, states that there are six hundred persons within eight miles of Fort Hope, who are averaging per man an ounce and a half of gold per day minimum to six and a half ounces per day maximum. The largest sums seem to be taken out at Sailor's Bar, five miles above Fort Hope. The lowest depth as yet reached by miners is fifteen inches; these mere surface scratches producing often 200 dollars per day. At Fort Hope, potatoes were selling at 6 dollars per bag; bacon, 75 cents per pound; crackers, 30 cents. From Fort Hope to Fort Thompson the road is good, with the exception of twenty miles. For 20 dollars, the steamers will take miners from Victoria to the diggings at Fort Hope, and for three or four dollars more an Indian will accompany you to Fort Yale. Bowen, steward of the Surprise, says that about a hundred Indians usually ran after him to obtain little sweet cakes, which he traded off four or five for 1 dollar in gold dust. Sugar at Fort Langley, 1 dollar 50 cents per pound; lumber, 1 dollar 50 cents per foot; tea and coffee, 1 dollar per pound; pierced iron for rockers, 8 dollars; plain sheets, 2 dollars each; five pounds of quicksilver sold for 40 dollars--10 dollars per pound was the ordinary price. The actual ground prospected and ascertained to be highly auriferous extends to three hundred and fifty miles from the mouth of Fraser River. One hundred miles of Thompson River has been prospected, and found to be rich, south-east of Fraser River. The same will apply to all the tributaries of Thompson River. A large extent of auriferous quartz has been discovered ten miles from Fort Hope. Exceedingly rich quartz veins have been found on Harrison River.|$|E

40|$|Five lots of {{good quality}} Hereford steer calves, 10 head to a lot, were used in this study. They {{were a part of}} the light end of a group of 150 steel calves {{originating}} at Marfa, Texas, and purchased for experimental purposes. They were received November 8, 1951, and started on test December 22, 1951. Until they were started on test, they were fed sorghum silage, prairie hay, and 1 pound of cottonseed cake per head daily with free access to salt. During the experiment all were fed in drylot, except Lot 1, which was fed out on dry bluestem pasture. All lots had free access to a mineral mixture (bonemeal and salt) and salt during the winter. The different lots received the following rations from December 22, 1951. to May 2, 1952 : Lot 1 -Bluestem pasture and 2 pounds cottonseed cake <b>per</b> head daily; <b>Lot</b> 2 -Sorghum silage and 1 pound cottonseed cake <b>per</b> head daily; <b>Lot</b> 3 -Prairio hay and 1 pound cottonseed cake <b>per</b> head daily; <b>Lot</b> 4 -Prairie hay, 2 pounds milo grain, and 1 pound cottonseed cake <b>per</b> head daily; <b>Lot</b> 5 -Prairie hay, 4 pounds milo grain, and 1 pound cottonseed cake per head daily.

40|$|This paper {{considers}} a production lot sizing and scheduling problem with sequence-dependent setup times {{that are not}} triangular. Consider, for exam-ple, a product p that contaminates some other product r unless either a decon-tamination occurs {{as part of a}} substantial setup time stpr or there is a third product q that can absorb p’s contamination. When setup times are triangular then stpr ≤ stpq+stqr and there is always an optimal lot sequence with at most one <b>lot</b> <b>per</b> product per period (AM 1 L). However, product q’s ability to absorb p’s contamination presents a shortcut opportunity and could result in shorter non-triangular setup times such that stpr> stpq+stqr. This implies that it can sometimes be optimal for a shortcut product such as q to be produced in more than one lot within the same period, breaking the AM 1 L assumption in much research. This paper formulates and explains a new optimal model that not only permits multiple setups and <b>lots</b> <b>per</b> product in a period (ML), but also prohibits subtours using a polynomial number of constraints rather than an exponential number. Computational tests demonstrate the effectiveness of the ML model, even in the presence of just one decontaminating shortcut product, and its fast speed of solution compared to the equivalent AM 1 L model...|$|R
