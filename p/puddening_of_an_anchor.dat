Based on a vessel model from the MSS Toolbox, develop and implement <b>a</b> simulator <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>anchor</b> handling vessel in MATLAB/Simulink. The simulator should contain the necessary modules for ballast tanks, roll reduction, cable systems and anchor handling equipment on deck. 3. Verify the simulator by simulating relevant anchor handling scenarios. 4. Present your findings and theoretical results in a report...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the effect that}} the loss <b>of</b> <b>a</b> shopping center <b>anchor</b> tenant has on the rental rates of the remaining tenants. Using data from smaller and moderately sized centers located in Florida and Georgia, two alternative regression procedures are employed and the results compared. Both estimates suggest similar and substantial effects to the rental rates. The rental rates of non-anchor tenants are estimated to decline approximately 25 % in response to the loss <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>anchor</b> tenant. ...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. This {{research}} {{carried out}} field tests on nine vertical anchors to investigate their behavior in gravel of Taichung Basin. An anchor {{can be categorized}} as <b>a</b> deep <b>anchor</b> when the free length Z exceeds 8 D (D is {{the diameter of the}} anchor). The shape of the heave on the ground surface <b>of</b> <b>a</b> shallow <b>anchor</b> is similar to a normal distribution curve. The extended diameter of the heave was between 170 and 300 cm, which could be divided into two zones, primary and secondary, based on the failure mode <b>of</b> the ground. <b>As</b> the fixed length <b>of</b> <b>a</b> shallow <b>anchor</b> increased, the extended diameter also increased. The ultimate load <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>anchor</b> increased with the free length and, to a greater degree, with the fixed length <b>of</b> <b>an</b> anchor: <b>a</b> fixed length <b>of</b> only 3 m (D = 0. 12 m) generated <b>an</b> ultimate load <b>of</b> over 1100 kN...|$|R

40|$|People‘s numeric {{estimates}} are often influenced by irrelevant values, known as anchors. Traditional theories of anchoring {{suggest that these}} anchoring effects will asymptote given sufficiently extreme anchors that fall outside <b>a</b> boundary <b>of</b> plausible values. However, the existing literature provides mixed evidence for <b>an</b> occurrence <b>of</b> asymptoting. Study 1 provides <b>a</b> rigorous test <b>of</b> asymptoting of anchoring by varying the level of extremity <b>of</b> the <b>anchor</b> past <b>a</b> boundary <b>of</b> plausible values. The results of Study 1 demonstrate that anchoring can continue without asymptoting past <b>a</b> boundary <b>of</b> plausible values for the target judgment. Study 2 examines {{the possibility of the}} influence <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>anchor</b> on these boundaries of plausible values, and shows that the extremity <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>anchor</b> impacts the extremity of the nearest boundary value for both target- and domain-ranges. In addition, these shifts in the boundaries impact people‘s judgments...|$|R
50|$|In rock climbing, <b>an</b> <b>anchor</b> {{can be any}} device or {{method for}} {{attaching}} a climber, a rope, or a load to the climbing surface - typically rock, ice, steep dirt, or a building - either permanently or temporarily. The intention <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>anchor</b> is case-specific but is usually for fall protection, primarily fall arrest and fall restraint. Climbing anchors are also used for hoisting, holding static loads, or redirecting (sometimes called deviating) a rope.|$|R
