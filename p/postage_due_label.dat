5000|$|In 1863, Turkey {{issued a}} set of <b>postage</b> <b>due</b> stamps, being among the first {{countries}} in the world to issue stamps for that specific purpose. The <b>postage</b> <b>dues</b> through 1913 had the same designs as the regular stamps, such as the Duloz or Empire issues, but were typically distinguished by being printed in brown or black.

50|$|While, technically, {{there is}} no reason for <b>postage</b> <b>dues</b> to reach private hands unused, postal administrations have sold them to collectors, and the <b>postage</b> <b>dues</b> of many {{countries}} exist in large numbers, often unused and of low value. Conversely, surviving examples of valid postally used <b>postage</b> <b>due</b> stamps tied together by a dated cancellation or other postal markings with a postage stamp on cover are less common and are sought after by philatelists.|$|R

25|$|With the {{termination}} of Parcel Post stamps the need for Parcel Post <b>Postage</b> <b>Due</b> stamps also ended. They had seen little use since most parcels were properly weighed and paid for at post offices. But in a way analogous to the Parcel Post issues they were retained by postmasters and used as regular <b>postage</b> <b>due</b> stamps until the supplies were exhausted. Some were employed well into the 1920s. The 25-cent denomination was of particular use {{since there was no}} correspondingly valued regular <b>postage</b> <b>due</b> stamp.|$|R
