40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to examine the {{consequences}} for the Canarian banana sector of the obligation to be integrated in <b>producer’s</b> <b>organisations</b> as a result of the coming into force of the European Common Market Organisation for bananas. Firstly, the successive modifications to the legislation referring to banana <b>producer’s</b> <b>organisations</b> are presented both at EU and Canarian level. And secondly, the effects that the application of this regulation has had on the commercial structures of the Canarian banana sector are analysed. A concentration of the supply and that has generated more results in cost savings that in sales management.

50|$|For {{a product}} {{to carry the}} FAIRTRADE Mark, it must come from FLO-CERT {{inspected}} and certified producer organizations.

To become certified Fairtrade producers, the primary cooperative and its member farmers must operate to certain political standards, imposed from Europe.

50|$|International {{trade and}} {{production}} involves long processes which take much time. For example, many months elapse between the sowing of a crop {{in the tropics}} and the final purchase by a consumer of a finished product in a European supermarket. The money laid out at each stage of production and distribution is called working capital. For smaller <b>producer</b> <b>organisations</b> to access international markets on terms consistent with their independence, if at all, requires access to working capital, by both producers and fair trade distributors, beyond what is available from banks. Normally this extra working capital would come from profit-maximising shareholders {{in some form or}} from accumulated past profits. Shared Interest provides unsecured finance, similar to trade credit. Shared Interest can do this only because its own members are prepared to accept the risk of loss on their investment in Shared Interest, and to accept the limited and currently lower financial returns resulting from the high costs of dealing with emerging organisations in the Global South.|$|E

40|$|The {{imbalances}} in {{bargaining power}} between {{the contracting parties}} in the food supply chain have drawn much attention, also from policy makers. The European Commission is committed to facilitate the restructuring of the sector by encouraging the creation of voluntary agricultural <b>producer</b> <b>organisations.</b> DG Agriculture and Rural Development has launched a large study, “Support for Farmers' Cooperatives”, that will provide the background knowledge that will help farmers organise themselves in cooperatives {{as a tool to}} consolidate their market orientation and so generate a solid market income.

40|$|The {{extension}} of the <b>producer</b> <b>organisation</b> (PO) regime to all agricultural sectors is another milestone in the EU Agricultural policy designed to encourage the development of collective action to promote competitiveness and improve farm returns. This paper, {{through the lens of}} power dependency theories suggests that in any supply tier, additional players may not serve the interests of those for whom it is intended. In markets serving highly concentrated and consolidated downstream buyers, the introduction and continued presence of the PO can result in a negative yardstick effect and thereby have a deflationary effect on farm gate price...|$|R

30|$|This paper {{examines}} the current setting of instruments aimed at rebalancing unequal market {{power in the}} food chain. Particular attention is given to horizontal integration possibilities for farmers, and organisations of farmers, as derogations to competition policies contained in the Common Market Organisation Regulation (EU) 1308 / 2013 (CMO Regulation). Firstly, we propose {{a review of the}} literature that looks at the imperfect price transmission along the food chain. Secondly, we examine how CAP of instruments aimed at counterbalancing market inequalities along the chain have been functioning over time, notably if they contributed to improving efficiency, farmers’ income and consumers’ welfare. Thirdly, we assess the current setting of the CMO Regulation, in particular, the way derogations to the competition policy are defined (exclusions, e.g. <b>producer’s</b> <b>organisations).</b> The main research question here is if the current setting does, or does not, allow attaining the objective of strengthening the bargaining power of producers, while at the same time avoiding the creation of monopoly power. Our research highlights that divergent results emerged from studies on the relation between size and profitability or efficiency, with evidence of significant economies of scale. Larger PO not only would be more profitable, but they also may offer more services to their members, especially when these services are associated with significant investment costs. In relation to policy measures aimed at improving the functioning of the food supply chain, the CMO Regulation relies on <b>producer’s</b> <b>organisations</b> as the main vehicle for producer cooperation. But the new legislative setting could lead to the paradoxical consequence of impeding the functioning by challenging the existence and/or creation of POs.|$|R
