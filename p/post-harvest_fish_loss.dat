Even Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) {{states that the}} <b>post-harvest</b> <b>fish</b> <b>loss</b> in Indonesia reaches up to 30 percent per year. This study aims to analyze quality loss of capture fisheries in the Gulf of Tomini region-Indonesia. This research used a survey method through direct observation to the fish caught by fishermen. In order to assess the fish loss, organoleptic testing based on the supply chain was done, the sample is four fish. Organoleptic characteristics observation was done through providing an assessment based on the parameter of SNI 01 - 2346 - 2006. The result shows {{that there is a}} quality loss of capture fisheries in the Gulf of Tomini region after the fish on the fishing boats (9. 0) and landed at the fish port (7. 8), fish terminal (6. 8), and fish market (5. 0).

40|$|This is {{a manual}} of <b>post-harvest</b> <b>fish</b> <b>loss</b> {{assessment}} methodologies. The manual describes two methodologies {{that can be}} used to generate information on post-harvest fish losses. Chapter 2 describes the informal methodology which will generate qualitative and indicative quantitative data on post-harvest fish losses. Chapter 3 describes a recall questionnaire methodology designed to generate quantitative data. The data these methodologies produce will assist those responsible for fisheries planning and policy making to understand fish losses and to go on, if need be, to make informed decisions about how best to reduce losses. The manual draws heavily on research by the ODA-funded NRI Post-harvest Fish Losses Project which over a period of three years set out to develop and field test methodologies to assess post-harvest fish losses. It is designed to be a practical guide for those who wish to investigate post-harvest fish losses and is aimed at those who will be involved in implementing loss assessments, i. e. fisheries researchers, extension workers, post-harvest specialists and socio-economists. The manual will be of interest to those working for bilateral and multilateral organisations who are concerned with fisheries development and management issues and the reduction of post-harvest fish losses. Although the methodologies presented were developed in the context of artisanal fisheries there may be scope for the manual to be used by people in private sector business to characterise losses in their particular environment for the purpose of increasing efficiency and profit...|$|E

40|$|Systematic {{studies of}} 618 <b>fishing</b> vessel <b>losses</b> between January 1961 and December 1982 {{have shown a}} {{significantly}} increased incidence of total losses from 1972 onwards. Comparison of mean pre- and post- 1972 rates indicated an increase of 120 % from 2. 54 to 5. 58 losses per 1000 vessels at risk. Parallel examination of the mortality of fishermen from all occupational accidents showed no improvement. For deaths arising from vessel losses alone, the mean crude death rate, for the same periods, increased by 13 %. Despite these findings, formal investigations (courts of inquiry) into <b>fishing</b> <b>losses,</b> ordered by the Department of Transport according to specified criteria, decreased in number from about 1975 onwards. The mean number fell by 61 % from 3. 1 (1961 - 71) to 1. 2 a year (1972 - 82). Furthermore, {{the reduction in the}} rate of formal investigations into <b>fishing</b> vessel <b>losses</b> (- 84 %; p less than 0. 0001) was greater than the corresponding reduction (- 61 %; p less than 0. 001) in United Kingdom merchant vessel investigations and this difference was statistically significant (p less than 0. 01). During 1972 - 82 there were 61 fewer fishing investigations than predicted from the rate at which these were ordered during 1961 - 71. The last took place in 1979.

40|$|Many rivers {{experience}} intermittent flows naturally or as {{a consequence}} of water abstraction. Climate change is likely to exacerbate flow variability such that dry spells may become more common. It is important to understand the ecological consequences of flow intermittency and habitat fragmentation in rivers, and to identify and protect habitat patches that provide refugia for aquatic biota. This paper explores environmental factors influencing dry season <b>fish</b> <b>losses</b> from isolated waterbodies in Cooper Creek, an unregulated arid-zone river in the Lake Eyre Basin, Australia. Multivariate ordination techniques and classification and regression trees (CART) were used to decompose species-environment relationships into a hierarchically structured data set, and to determine factors explaining changes in fish assemblage structure and species losses over a single dry season. Canonical correspondence analysis (CCA) explained 74 % of fish assemblage change in terms of waterhole morphology (wetted perimeter, depth), habitat structure (bench development, off-take channels), waterhole quality (eroded banks, gross primary production), the size of surrounding floodplains and the relative isolation of waterholes. Classification trees for endemic and restricted species reaffirmed the importance of these waterhole and floodplain variables as drivers of <b>fish</b> <b>losses.</b> The CCA and CART models offer valuable tools for identification of refugia in Cooper Creek and, possibly, other dryland rivers.

40|$|Abstract only. The {{past twenty}} years has seen the {{offshore}} outsourcing of <b>post-harvest</b> <b>fish</b> processing gain unprecedented momentum. The growth in offshore processing is a further stage in an increasingly globalised fisheries value chain. Raw material is head and gutted, then frozen, and transported to processing sites in Asia (especially China). The fish is then thawed, valueadded processed, and refrozen for export to the original sourcing country or third country markets primarily Europe and North America. China is the worlds largest exporter of seafood principally due to its cost-efficient reprocessing trade. The growth in offshore processing has heightened concern in terms of traceability, food safety, country of origin labelling, and fraud. The performance of New Zealands seafood processing industry is intrinsically linked to, and influenced by, market forces. New Zealand seafood companies first began to sub-contract processing to China in the early 1990 s. A reduction in hoki quotas coupled with increasing processing costs {{as well as the}} disposal - and/or configuration changes - of trawlers contributed to moving value-added processing offshore. New Zealand companies have also transferred processing technology to China during the last fifteen years. In order to understand the drivers behind the move to offshore outsourcing, this paper critically examines the development of Chinas post-harvesting processing industry before exploring the changing nature of New Zealand seafood companys production practices.

40|$|The main aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} the number and biomass of impinged fish at Forsmark Nuclear Power Plant in Sweden, located on the coast of the Baltic Sea. Of particular interest was the number of impinged individuals of the critically endangered European eel (Anguilla anguilla) which is regularly caught in the cooling system. Another aim was to determine the comparability of the results from Forsmark and results from impingement studies in other types of waters. Cross-systems studies make it possible to (1) estimate <b>fish</b> <b>loss</b> at plants where fish is not counted, and (2) to predict changes in <b>fish</b> <b>loss</b> from changes in electricity production or cooling water use. In 2010, 31, 300, 000 fish with a total biomass of 62, 600 kg were impinged at Forsmark. In 2011, 27, 300, 000 fish weighing 38, 500 kg were impinged. The maximum peak in total fish number and biomass occurred in spring. The most critical period for herring was in late summer and early autumn. Regarding eel, the largest impingement losses were recorded in November. The number of fish agreed with earlier established quantities of impinged fish in both freshwater and marine ecosystems.

40|$|What is {{the focus}} of {{attention}} in the <b>post-harvest</b> <b>fishing</b> industry? Like other branches of the food sector, the <b>post-harvest</b> <b>fishing</b> industry depends on providing products that are both safe and which meet consumersÂ´ increasing demands for quality. As fish exporters, we have a particularly difficult job because fish are extremely susceptible to contamination. They are exposed to everything from pathogens and allergens to heavy metals, parasites and toxins, so the potential health hazards for fish consumers are legion. WhatÂ´s more, fish are highly perishable. Especially in hot climates, significant quality losses can occur very soon after the fish are caught. What is needed, then, is a control mechanism that takes in both these factors right through the entire fish processing supply chain, from the moment a fish is caught to the dispatch of the final product. Our fish processing plant in Uganda {{is one of the first}} in East Africa to implement such a comprehensive control mechanism. It has put into place a system of Hazard Analysis Critical Control Points (HACCP) which is based on standard operating procedures and good manufacturing practices. HACCP dates back to the 1960 s, when NASA needed a foolproof method to prevent potentially catastrophic disease-producing bacteria and toxins in food consumed on space missions. From the 1990 s onwards, the food industry has adopted this method to comply with international food safety and hygiene regulations, chief among them European Council directives 91 / 493 /EEC and 98 / 83 /EEC, which lay down the requirements for handling and marketing fish products destined for the EU. HACCP is, essentially, a management tool that establishes control over the entire food preparation process. It aims to prevent food safety problems rather than identifying them after they have already occurred. Under this system, food inspections take place at every level of the fish supply chain - at the catch, landing, processing and marketing stages - and involve all main industry stakeholders, from small fishermen and processing plant workers to traders and regulatory authorities. When, for example, a parasite is found in a catch at the landing stage, it is stopped in its tracks and will never reach the processing plant, thus preventing mounting costs and the further spread of the organism. HACCP also imposes strict standards regarding the construction of buildings and equipment intended for holding fish prior to export. On-site laboratories, strict record keeping, and accurate traceability procedures are other requirements. Can you describe the fish processing phases and how ICTs are integrated? The chain starts with the local fishers, who are increasingly using ICTs in their daily activities. Mobile phones, for example, now allow fishing crews to communicate with staff on shore, to notify them of any preparations that need to be made or to alert them to any difficulties. Many larger fishing vessels are equipped with computers and software that allow their crews to weigh their catch immediately and store it at the right temperature. Also, in the near future, sophisticated GPS and sonar devices will provide an affordable means of accurately tracking and determining the size of fish stocks (see elsewhere in this issue). Once ashore, the fish are subjected to quality control inspections with the help of software that measures the catch against predefined standards, assessing everything from the freshness and shelf-life of the fish, to their texture and post-mortem skin colour. The results are entered into a database. Fish that pass the test are transported to the processing plant, where they are weighed by electronic scales and graded with the help of another software package. The next step involves plant workers filleting or descaling the fish, while computer programs calculate the speed at which this is carried out and continually regulate work environment temperatures. When the fish have been deskinned and trimmed, they are graded once more as workers input their new weight and quality parameters into a database. They are then quickly moved to a chilling/freezing area, where a computer monitors the temperature and total amount of time the fish are required to stay inside. The fish are subsequently packed in boxes or cartons and moved to a separate cold storage area, which is also computer-controlled, before being dispatched to the airport or port. Marine Products Ltd is currently working to perfect this HACCP-based and ICT-supported quality control system. HACCP not only allows us to comply with EU regulations, it also produces an efficient work environment that our employees find stimulating. Above all, the system - which is in place in several other Ugandan fish processing plants - has made it possible for us to stay competitive in the international export market and to secure the future of our national fisheries.
