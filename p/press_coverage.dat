5|$|Because The Birth of a Nation {{attracted}} increased scrutiny due {{to possible}} Oscar nominations, {{and the film}} itself depicts a brutal rape, there was significant <b>press</b> <b>coverage</b> about damage control by Fox Searchlight Pictures, the studio releasing the film.

5|$|<b>Press</b> <b>coverage</b> of {{the concept}} XJ220 in 1988 was {{overwhelmingly}} positive {{and contributed to the}} decision in 1989 to put the XJ220 into limited production.

5|$|Since {{at least}} the 1870s, American religious, medical, legislative, and legal {{commentators}} have debated contraception laws. Ana Garner and Angela Michel have found that in these discussions men often attach reproductive rights to moral and political matters, {{as part of an}} ongoing attempt to regulate human bodies.

5|$|By {{the time}} of the 1997 general election, polls {{suggested}} that Eurosceptic sentiment was running high in the UK, and the question of the country's ongoing membership of the EU was a topic of regular discussion in the media. Much of this <b>press</b> <b>coverage</b> took a negative stance toward the EU, mainstream newspapers like the Daily Mail, The Telegraph and The Times promoting Eurosceptic sentiment. Such debates were influenced by the UK's recent signing of the Maastricht Treaty and the looming possibility that the country would adopt the euro currency.|$|E

5|$|Mark Kellogg (March 31, 1831 – June 25, 1876) was a {{newspaper}} reporter killed at the Battle of the Little Bighorn. Kellogg rode with George Armstrong Custer during the battle and was evidently {{one of the first}} men killed by the Sioux and Cheyenne. His dispatches were the only <b>press</b> <b>coverage</b> of Custer and his men {{in the days leading up}} to the battle.

Nevertheless, by January 1972, McGovern had only 3percent national support among Democrats in the Gallup Poll and had not attracted significant <b>press</b> <b>coverage.</b>|$|E

5|$|Operations in Borneo were {{extremely}} sensitive and they received little <b>press</b> <b>coverage</b> in Australia, while official acknowledgement {{of involvement in}} cross-border missions only occurred in 1996.

5|$|<b>Press</b> <b>coverage</b> in the {{following}} days, after Howe's statement that no bomb had been found, continued {{to focus on the}} act planned by the IRA; several newspapers reported a search for a fourth member of the team.

5|$|The {{match between}} Taylor and Bigelow brought the WWF {{mainstream}} <b>press</b> <b>coverage.</b> The {{reactions to the}} match were mixed; some people thought that Taylor performed surprisingly well for a non-wrestler. Others thought that the WWF pushing a football player to defeat a wrestler made professional wrestling look bad. Reviews of the event as a whole have also been mixed, and the event has been called both the worst WrestleMania of all time and the event that saved the WWF.|$|E
5|$|The {{reaction}} to La Mitrailleuse prompted the Leicester Galleries to offer Nevinson a one-man show {{which was held}} in October 1916. The show was a critical and popular success and the works displayed all sold.
