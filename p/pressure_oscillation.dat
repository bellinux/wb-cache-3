The primary waves are {{generated}} in shallow waters by direct water wave-land interaction and have the same period as the water waves (10 to 16 seconds). The more powerful secondary waves are generated by the superposition of ocean waves of equal period traveling in opposite directions, thus generating standing gravity waves - with an associated <b>pressure</b> <b>oscillation</b> at half the period, which is not diminishing with depth. The theory for microseism generation by standing waves was provided by Michael Longuet-Higgins in 1950, after in 1941 Pierre Bernard suggested this relation with standing waves on the basis of observations.|$|E
50|$|Variable-Length Intake Manifold (VLIM) is an {{internal}} combustion engine manifold technology.Four common implementations exist. First, two discrete intake runners with different length are employed, and a butterfly valve can close the short path. Second the intake runners can be bent around a common plenum, and a sliding valve separates them from the plenum with a variable length. Straight high-speed runners can receive plugs, which contain small long runner extensions. The plenum of a 6- or 8-cylinder engine can be parted into halves, with the even firing cylinders in one half and the odd firing cylinders in the other part. Both sub-plenums and the air intake are connected to an Y (sort of main plenum). The air oscillates between both sub-plenums, with a large <b>pressure</b> <b>oscillation</b> there, but a constant pressure at the main plenum. Each runner from a sub plenum to the main plenum can be changed in length. For V engines this can be implemented by parting a single large plenum at high engine speed by means of sliding valves into it when speed is reduced.|$|E

During mainstage, the thrust chamber exhibited no large-amplitude chamber <b>pressure</b> <b>oscillations</b> that could be identified as low-frequency combustion instability or 'chug'. However, during start-up and shutdown, the thrust chamber very briefly exhibited large-amplitude chamber <b>pressure</b> <b>oscillations</b> that were identified as chug. These instabilities during start-up and shutdown were regarded as benign due to their brevity. Linear models of the thrust chamber and the propellant feed systems were formulated for both the thrust chamber component tests and the flight engine tests. These linear models determined the frequency and decay rate of chamber <b>pressure</b> <b>oscillations</b> given the design and operating conditions of the thrust chamber and feed system.

It was Lindzen, in his 1966 paper, On the theory of the diurnal tide, who showed that the solution set of Hough functions given by Bernard Haurwitz to Laplace's tidal equation was incomplete: modes with negative equivalent depths had been omitted. Lindzen went on to calculate the thermal response of the diurnal tide to ozone and water vapor absorption in detail and showed that when his theoretical developments were included, the surface <b>pressure</b> <b>oscillation</b> was predicted with approximately the magnitude and phase observed, as were most of the features of the diurnal wind oscillations in the mesosphere. In 1967, along with his NCAR colleague, Douglas D. McKenzie, Lindzen extended the theory to include a term for Newtonian cooling due to emission of infrared radiation by carbon dioxide in the stratosphere along with ozone photochemical processes, and then in 1968 he showed that the theory also predicted that the semi-diurnal oscillation would be insensitive to variations in the temperature profile, which is why it is observed so much more strongly and regularly at the surface.|$|E

One of his most important contributions resulted from data collected during the early days of computers using the now antiquated system of IBM punch cards, and yet the data gathered on ocean swells was groundbreaking. It suggested that storms were being generated from very distant origins, as far as halfway around the earth. Snodgrass installed a directional array off San Clemente Island, just off the California coast. “The results were spectacular” said Walter Munk. Data pointed to storms originating close to Antarctica and New Zealand. Subsequently, six wave stations were established to confirm this theory. Stations were established in New Zealand, Samoa, Palmyra (an uninhabited island in the Pacific), Hawaii, FLIP (an SIO special special-purpose vessel, which was moored in position for about a month), and Alaska. Snodgrass' free-fall instruments were used in each station (except FLIP) to track waves originating in the southern storm belt.|$|E

Analyses of data from medium and large caliber gun firings reveal that the dominant frequencies can vary from a few kHz to about 60 kHz. The frequency depends, at least in part, on chamber dimensions, suggesting the pressure variations are reinforced by wave reflections forming acoustic types of oscillations.

These physical phenomena were experimentally studied using a newly developed confined combustion chamber equipped with one or two orifice plates. The results showed that there are five stages of flame propagation when a laminar flame passes through the orifice plate in a confined space. These include the deceleration of the laminar flame, jet flame formation and rapid acceleration, deceleration of the flame, turbulent flame formation and acceleration, and turbulent flame propagation in the end-gas region. Flame acceleration and <b>pressure</b> <b>oscillation</b> were found to be strongly related to the aperture size of the orifice plate. The high amplitudes of pressure oscillations were found to be the results of two combustion mechanisms: the end gas auto-ignition and the interactions between the accelerated turbulent flame and shock wave. To further accelerate the flame and promote stronger disturbance in the end gas, another identical orifice plate was employed. Subsequently, strong flame-shock interaction caused end-gas auto-ignition with an extremely high-amplitude <b>pressure</b> <b>oscillation.</b> Eventually, the maximum amplitude of <b>pressure</b> <b>oscillation</b> exceeded 8 MPa as end-gas auto-ignition occurred in the end region of the combustion chamber...|$|E
