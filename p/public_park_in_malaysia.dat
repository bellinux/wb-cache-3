40|$|<b>Public</b> <b>park</b> {{areas are}} {{developed}} {{to serve as}} major activity areas in the city or town. They are public spaces designed to attract all races and cultures and to provide places for attention to the integration of uses. The spaces affect many people and their design could be replicated <b>in</b> several other <b>public</b> <b>parks.</b> A major problem faced by designers <b>in</b> <b>Malaysia</b> {{is the fact that}} there are three major communities, each with their own distinctive culture. These different communities are Malay, Chinese, and Indian and each group has different traditions about the use of <b>public</b> <b>parks.</b> The area of landscape design which is the concern of this book relates to the design of <b>public</b> <b>parks</b> <b>in</b> the context of a multi–racial society. The purpose of this book is to rationalize how <b>public</b> <b>parks</b> function <b>in</b> <b>Malaysia.</b> This objective is achieved by looking at current theories <b>in</b> <b>public</b> <b>park</b> design, examining the appropriateness of them all to the local tropical situation.
