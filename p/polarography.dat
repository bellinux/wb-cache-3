50|$|<b>Polarography</b> is a voltammetric {{measurement}} whose {{response is}} determined by combined diffusion/convection mass transport. The simple principle of <b>polarography</b> {{is the study of}} solutions or of electrode processes by means of electrolysis with two electrodes, one polarizable and one unpolarizable, the former formed by mercury regularly dropping from a capillary tube. <b>Polarography</b> is a specific type of measurement that falls into the general category of linear-sweep voltammetry where the electrode potential is altered in a linear fashion from the initial potential to the final potential. As a linear sweep method controlled by convection/diffusion mass transport, the current vs. potential response of a polarographic experiment has the typical sigmoidal shape. What makes <b>polarography</b> different from other linear sweep voltammetry measurements is that <b>polarography</b> makes use of the dropping mercury electrode (DME) or the static mercury drop electrode.|$|E

50|$|Dramatically better {{discrimination}} against the capacitive current {{can be obtained}} using the tast and pulse polarographic techniques. These have been developed with introduction of analog and digital electronic potentiostats. A first major improvement is obtained, if the current is only measured {{at the end of}} each drop lifetime (tast <b>polarography).</b> An even greater enhancement has been the introduction of differential pulse <b>polarography.</b> Here, the current is measured before the beginning and before the end of short potential pulses. The latter are superimposed to the linear potential-time-function of the voltammetric scan. Typical amplitudes of these pulses range between 10 and 50 mV, whereas pulse duration is 20 to 50 ms. The difference between both current values is that taken as the analytical signal. This technique results in a 100 to 1000-fold improvement of the detection limit, because the capacitive component is effectively suppressed.|$|E
