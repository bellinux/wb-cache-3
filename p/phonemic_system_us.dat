This article makes a contrastive analysis of the <b>phonemic</b> <b>systems</b> of English and Bangla. The aspects of similarities as well as dissimilarities between the two have been explored in detail.

40|$|Omani EFL {{learners}} face {{various problems}} in learning different {{skills such as}} reading, writing, grammar, vocabulary and pronunciation. In particular, {{it is very difficult}} for Omani EFL learners to pronounce certain consonant sounds correctly. For instance, the sound /p/ of the English language do not have similar sound in the <b>phonemic</b> <b>system</b> of the Arabic language, so it is not easily recognised by Omani students. This sound is always replaced by /b/, a sound in the Arabic <b>phonemic</b> <b>system.</b> Similar case is observed with the sound /ʧ/, /v/ and /g/, which do not have similar sounds in the Arabic consonantal system. Consequently, these are often replaced by the sound /ʃ/, /f/ and /ʤ/ respectively. The absence of one sound of a language <b>phonemic</b> <b>system</b> from another <b>phonemic</b> <b>system</b> of another language creates problem to learners. Hence, {{the purpose of this study}} is to examine the difficulties experienced by Omani EFL learners in pronouncing certain English consonant sounds. The study also provides a theoretical description of first language interference which affects Omani ESL learners’ pronunciation of /p/ and /ʧ/ consonant sounds in words in isolation for three positions – initial, middle and final. Quantitative research methodology was employed, with the use of a diagnostic test to assess students’ pronunciation on certain consonant sounds. A questionnaire was also utilized to gather information from the teachers pertaining to students’ difficulties in pronouncing certain consonant sounds. The study is significant as it offers a practical outcome where teachers will be able to use suitable pedagogical approaches in handling this problem in Omani EFL classes...|$|R

Yet, what counts as a repetition? When a spoken word is repeated, is it the acoustic shape or the linguistic type that matters? In the present study, we contrasted the contribution of acoustic and phonological features by using participants with different linguistic backgrounds: they came from two populations sharing a common vocabulary (Catalan) yet possessing different <b>phonemic</b> <b>systems</b> [1]. They performed a lexical decision task with lists containing words that were repeated verbatim, as well as words that were repeated with one phonetic feature changed.
