These sessions at Redshop Studio are the earliest recordings that would be released under The Waterboys name. During the same period, Scott formed the short-lived band The Red and the Black, with saxophone player Anthony Thistlethwaite, after hearing him play on Waiting on Egypt, a Nikki Sudden album. The Red and the Black performed nine concerts in London. Thistlethwaite introduced Scott to drummer Kevin Wilkinson, who joined The Red and the Black. During 1982, Scott made a number of recordings, both solo and with Thistlethwaite and Wilkinson. These recording sessions, both of Scott's solo work and the group performances, would later be divided between The Waterboys' first and second albums.|$|E

The band had trouble creating a follow-up single, {{but they made}} progress when paired with producer Stephen Street. The resulting single release, [...] "There's No Other Way", became a hit, peaking at number eight.

500|$|Zeta-Jones' first {{release of}} 1999 was the heist film Entrapment, {{in which she}} starred {{opposite}} Sean Connery as a seductive insurance agent {{on the lookout for}} an art thief. Despite a negative critical reception, the film was a commercial success; Janet Maslin of The New York Times thought that the film provided Zeta-Jones a platform to [...] "show off her slithery skills", and Desson Howe of The Washington Post called on viewers to appreciate the sex appeal she brought to the role. Later that year, Zeta-Jones appeared alongside Liam Neeson and Lili Taylor in The Haunting, a remake of the 1963 film of the same name about a team of paranormal experts who look into strange occurrences in an ill-fated mansion. The horror feature received generally poor reviews but found a significant worldwide audience. In a scathing review, the critic Mick LaSalle wrote that [...] "Zeta-Jones seems less an actress and more a <b>pretty</b> <b>face,</b> and not an interesting one at that".|$|E
500|$|Dismayed {{at being}} typecast as the token pretty girl in British films, Zeta-Jones {{relocated}} to Los Angeles. She remarked, [...] "There {{was all this}} fuss about who I was and wasn't dating. I was a <b>pretty</b> <b>face</b> and a big bust and nothing else. People in the business believed what they read about me. So I decided to move away and start again." [...] She believed that the anonymity she faced in America helped her get roles on merit and not due to her public image. She earned the part of Sala, the hench-woman to the villainous Drax (Treat Williams) in the superhero film The Phantom (1996), starring Billy Zane in the titular role. A reviewer for Variety considered Zeta-Jones to be a standout in her part, but the film received a negative critical reception and earned little at the box office. The CBS television miniseries Titanic (1996), however, was better received. Starring opposite Peter Gallagher and George C. Scott, she portrayed the lead role of Isabella Paradine, a young mother engaged in an extramarital affair on the [...]|$|E

500|$|Blur's baggy-inspired {{debut album}} Leisure (1991) was a UK Top 10-charting record that, {{according}} to the NME, made the band the [...] "acceptable <b>pretty</b> <b>face</b> of a whole clump of bands that have emerged since the whole Manchester thing started {{to run out of}} steam". However, as the baggy scene soon began to fade, Blur were—according to The Guardian—"wiftly exposed as bogus trend-hoppers, [...] they duly caught the wrath of the Madchester backlash". Further, following their fall from public favour, the group found that they were £60,000 in debt, mainly due to mismanagement. Blur hired new manager Chris Morrison and, to recoup losses, were sent by their record label Food to the United States as part of the Rollercoaster tour. To coincide with the start of the tour, Blur released the [...] "Popscene" [...] single; the new release showcased a significant change in musical direction, as Blur traded their shoegaze-derived sound for one influenced by 60s British guitar pop. However, the single failed to break into the UK top 30 which further diminished Blur's profile in the UK.|$|E
500|$|On 17 February, Henry Sutherland Edwards {{wrote in}} the Musical World: [...] "In almost all conjunctions of music and words, there is a {{sacrifice}} of one to the other; but in Thespis... Sufficient opportunities have been given for music; and the music serves only to adorn the piece." [...] Similar reports continued to appear through early March, when Thespis closed. The final performance during the authors' lifetimes was given {{less than two months}} later, on 27 April, at a matinée for the benefit of Mlle. Clary, the original Sparkeion. On such an occasion, a performer would normally choose a piece likely to sell well, as the beneficiary was entitled to the income (after expenses), and tickets were generally offered at [...] "inflated prices". The actress was a Gaiety favourite, [...] "not only in respect of her voice but also her delicious French accent and, of course, her figure." [...] Others recalled [...] "the charm of Mlle. Clary, with her <b>pretty</b> <b>face</b> and piquant broken English". She had been particularly successful as Sparkeion, and her song in Act II, [...] "Little Maid of Arcadee", was the only one chosen for publication.|$|E

They {{are part of a}} Francoist film troupe that travels from Spain during the Spanish Civil War to Nazi Germany for a joint production with UFA. Cruz's performance in the film was praised by film critics, with Jonathan Holloland of Variety magazine writing [...] "if confirmation is still needed that Cruz is an actress first and a <b>pretty</b> <b>face</b> second, then here it is". A writer for Film4 commented that [...] "Cruz herself is the inevitable focus of the film" [...] but noted that overall the film [...] "looks great". Cruz's role as Macerna has been viewed as her [...] "largest role to date". For her performance, Cruz received a Goya Award and Spanish Actors' Union Award, and was nominated for a European Film Award. In 1999, Cruz worked with Almodóvar again in All About My Mother, playing Sister María Rosa Sanz, a pregnant nun with AIDS. The film received favorable reviews, and was commercially successful, grossing over $67million worldwide, although it performed better at the box office internationally than domestically.|$|E

However, despite his imperfections, the protagonist admits she still loves him. Beyoncé sings the lines [...] "nderneath the <b>pretty</b> <b>face</b> is something complicated / I come with a side of trouble / But I know that's why you're staying" [...] in the song aimed to inform her [...] "roguish" [...] male lover. The lines of the chorus are sung by Beyoncé with pronouncing one word at a time in longer intervals. A short interlude about [...] "mov things to the bedroom" [...] is interpolated in the song. Beyoncé forgoes lyrical subtlety during that part, singing explicit lines such as [...] "Tell me do you wanna ride?" [...] and [...] "First both of my legs go back on your head, and whatever you want, yeah baby, I'm bad". Fuse's Mark Sundstrom interpreted the song's message as talking about the singer's husband Jay-Z and added [...] "She loves him more because she knows him entirely, accepting he's not perfect or without a past". Complex editor Claire Lobenfeld considered its lyrical content to be about how a [...] "couple's respective internal messiness can bring them closer together".|$|E

Tanner Stransky of Entertainment Weekly concluded that although the video {{was different from the}} previous [...] "heavily produced spectacles" [...] Beyoncé has made, [...] "it's hard to take your eyes off it".

The producer of the Tekken video game series, Katsuhiro Harada, said that Dragon Ball was one of the first works to visually depict chi and thereby influenced Tekken and other Japanese games such as Street Fighter. Ian Jones-Quartey, a producer of the American animated series Steven Universe, is a fan of Dragon Ball and Dr. Slump, and uses Toriyama's vehicle designs as a reference for his own.

500|$|When Sinatra's {{mother was}} a child, her <b>pretty</b> <b>face</b> earned her the {{nickname}} [...] "Dolly." [...] Energetic and driven, biographers {{believe that she was}} the dominant factor in the development of her son's personality traits and extraordinary self-confidence. Barbara Sinatra claims that Dolly was abusive to him as a child, and [...] "knocked him around a lot". Dolly became influential in Hoboken and in local Democratic Party circles. She worked as a midwife, earning $50 for each delivery, and according to Sinatra biographer Kitty Kelley, also ran an illegal abortion service that catered to Italian Catholic girls for which she was nicknamed [...] "Hatpin Dolly". She also had a gift for languages and served as a local interpreter. [...] Sinatra's illiterate father was a bantamweight boxer who fought under the name Marty O'Brien. He later worked for 24 years at the Hoboken Fire Department, working his way up to captain. Sinatra spent much time at his parents' tavern in Hoboken, [...] working on his homework and occasionally singing a song on top of the player piano for spare change. During the Great Depression, Dolly provided money to her son for outings with friends and to buy expensive clothes, resulting in neighbors describing him as the [...] "best-dressed kid in the neighborhood". Excessively thin and small as a child and young man, Sinatra's skinny frame later became a staple of jokes during stage shows.|$|E

Klepacki has declared pop music as having become the [...] "largest farce in music history—soul-less, mechanical, and only {{made for the}} sole purpose of making the fastest dollar possible, with more emphasis on imagery than the music." [...] He's also criticized lip-synching and the repackaging of music genre through different labels—such as Nu metal for rock music and Neo soul for soul music. He believes that signing a deal does not guarantee profits, and would rather keep his day job as audio director. These sentiments were echoed in a special feature on the band Home Cookin' in 2000—Klepacki said the group wanted to [...] "work with a label, not for them." [...] Stating that he would not compromise his work for popularity, he believes that [...] "the only artists that have any longevity are the ones that pioneer a movement—not follow one." [...] He enjoys working independently, as he does not have to [...] "change...music for the sake of pop radio." [...] He champions the internet as a medium through which creative and original artists can be found. Klepacki believes it is the preferred avenue for music when compared to radio airplay—where one hears [...] "the exact same songs 3 months at a time." [...] When interviewed about file-sharing, he expressed mixed emotions. Holding that compact discs are [...] "just too damn expensive", Klepacki believes that a few dollars' reduction in price would [...] "deter people from downloading for free." [...] Conversely, he notes that artists—who [...] "don't get as much money as you think"—need to be compensated for their work.

500|$|Pfeiffer {{has long}} been {{referred}} to {{as one of the most}} beautiful actresses in Hollywood, a designation The Daily Telegraph Mick Brown considers to be both [...] "a defining characteristic in her acting career" [...] and [...] "a curse". Pfeiffer initially struggled to convince casting agents and directors to take her seriously as an actress because they perceived her as little more than a <b>pretty</b> <b>face</b> during the early stages of her career. Pfeiffer's acting abilities continued to be overshadowed by her beauty even several years after her breakout performance in Scarface (1983); she responded by pursuing roles in which being blond is not a requirement. The Daily Beast Elizabeth Kaye recognized Pfeiffer among Hollywood's rare [...] "beautiful women" [...] who trust that it is possible to be physically beautiful and serious simultaneously. Kaye believes that the actress achieves this feat by [...] "grafting the sensibility of a modern woman onto the glamour of a '30s icon"; Rolling Stones Gerri Hirshey agreed that Pfeiffer's roles combine [...] "Nineties guts and Thirties glamour." [...] For Interview magazine, Peter Stone described Pfeiffer as a [...] "Blond, sultry, and ethereal" [...] actress with an [...] "unforgettable" [...] face. Nisha Lilia Diu, another The Daily Telegraph contributor, opined, [...] "It's not that she looks younger than she is – she doesn't particularly – it's the symmetry of her bone structure, the flashing aquamarine eyes and those lips, the top one so much fuller than the bottom. It's the kind of beauty you find yourself involuntarily taking a moment to marvel at mid-conversation." [...] At least two of Pfeiffer's films, Stardust (2007) and Chéri (2009), in which she plays a 5, 000 year old witch obsessed with beauty and a courtesan fading into obscurity, respectively, explore themes of beautiful women struggling with the idea of aging. Pfeiffer personally identified with the topic of [...] "our obsession with youth and the ludicrous degrees to which women will go to reclaim it" [...] portrayed in the films. Pfeiffer claims to not want to appear younger than she is and has yet to undergo plastic surgery, although she admits she would [...] "never say never" [...] to the procedure. Dismissing the claim that she is [...] "drop dead gorgeous", insisting that she is only [...] "conventionally pretty". Pfeiffer has been famously self-deprecating about her own appearance, comparing herself to Howard the Duck.|$|E
500|$|Teetotal and a non-smoker, O'Hara {{rejected}} the Hollywood party lifestyle, and was relatively moderate in her personal grooming. In her earlier career {{she refused to}} appear to smoke and drink on screen, {{and it was only}} later that she relented to avoid being out of a job. O'Hara was considered to be prudish in Hollywood. Malone wrote that [...] "her attitude towards sex bordered on puritanical at times, which wasn't what one expected from a sex symbol". When asked why she would not pose for scantily clad photographs O'Hara remarked: [...] "I come from a very strict family, and I can't do some of the things other actresses can because my folks in Dublin would think I turned out bad", and in 1948 she stated that she wouldn't be photographed in a bathing suit [...] "Because I don't think I looked like Lana Turner in a bathing suit, frankly. O'Hara later commented that [...] "I'm not prudish but my training was strict". She believed that her squeaky-clean lifestyle took its toll on her career. She once said, [...] "I'm a helpless victim of a Hollywood whispering campaign. Because I don't let the producer and director kiss me every morning or let them paw me they have spread around town that I am not a woman, that I am a cold piece of marble statuary" [...] and [...] "I wouldn't throw myself on the casting couch, and I know that cost me parts. I wasn't going to play the whore. That wasn't me". She vented her frustration on not being given edgier roles in an interview with The Los Angeles Times, saying [...] "Producers look at a <b>pretty</b> <b>face</b> and think: 'She must have got this far on her looks'. Then comes along a girl with a plain face and they think, 'She must be a great actress, she isn't pretty'. So they give her the glamour treatment and the pretty girl gets left behind". O'Hara believed that she missed out on a number of roles in some of the classic black and white films because she aesthetically pictured so well in Technicolor productions. Such was her natural beauty that {{she was one of the}} few actresses in Hollywood during her career to not undergo cosmetic surgery, though she had one crooked tooth which she refused to part with.|$|E
