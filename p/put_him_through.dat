25|$|McMahon {{then began}} a feud with Kurt Angle. By the King of the Ring, on June 24, McMahon's feud with Angle had culminated. After already {{participating}} in two tournament matches that night, Angle wrestled McMahon in a Street Fight. After a suplex {{on the hard}} floor, Angle was thought to have cracked his tailbone. Angle also delivered an overhead belly to belly suplex through the plated glass stage set, but McMahon did not break through on the first attempt, causing him to fall head-first onto the concrete floor. After a successful second attempt, Angle was to <b>put</b> <b>him</b> <b>through</b> a second plate {{back out to the}} stage and again failed two more times. The match also had Shane missing a shooting star press and ended with Angle performing the Angle Slam off the top rope before scoring the victory over a bloodied McMahon.|$|E
25|$|On 19 November the Red Army began {{a counter}} offensive, named Operation Uranus. Within days, the Soviets had encircled some 300,000 German, Italian, Romanian and Hungarian {{soldiers}} {{in the city of}} Stalingrad. It was decided by Hitler and the OKL to supply the Axis forces by air. Richthofen was horrified. He telephoned Berchtesgaden and tried to get through to Hitler, but none of his aides would <b>put</b> <b>him</b> <b>through.</b> He tried to convince Göring that his air fleet did not have the resources to sustain an air lift, and that the best option would be to attempt a breakout before the Soviet forces entrenched. He flew to Manstein's headquarters, and the Field Marshal agreed a breakout must take place. With the Sixth Army preserved, the initiative could be regained later. He made this request to Hitler. The Soviet divisions were smaller than their German counterparts: but they had 97. Holding Stalingrad was now impossible.|$|E

500|$|Bob Bowman {{took over}} as head coach of Michigan for the 2004–05 season. [...] He put Tarwater on a new {{training}} program, with a greater focus on speed training and less on distance. [...] "We've also <b>put</b> <b>him</b> <b>through</b> weight training, and I think it's been improving his speed", Bowman said. [...] "He {{has a very strong}} work ethic and always wants to improve. Instead of just getting in the pool and doing what we tell him to do, he actually thinks about it and asks questions. He wants to know the theory behind what he's doing." [...] Tarwater won the 2005 NCAA championship in the 200-yard butterfly. [...] His time of 1:42.30 was a Michigan and Big Ten record, and the third fastest time in NCAA history. In the 100-meter butterfly, he placed fourth.|$|E

500|$|For {{the timing}} of {{introducing}} the new characters, the showrunners decided to introduce the Punisher immediately and hold back on Elektra briefly, with Ramirez explaining that [...] "one of the pitfalls when we have this many great characters to play with is wanting to throw them at the wall", but {{it was important to}} take the time to introduce the new characters properly to the audience, particularly to the people who weren't already familiar with them. Elaborating on the aim to keep the story focused on Murdock, Petrie revealed that the writers would often come up with [...] "amazing stuff" [...] for the season, but then realize that they had forgotten about Murdock and had to [...] "completely turn it over and look at how this affects Matt and filter it through that prism." [...] Ramirez added,It could easily become The Punisher story or the Elektra story that Matt cameos in, and not vice versa. So, we built it like a Matt story, in terms of what we wanted to <b>put</b> <b>him</b> <b>through,</b> where we wanted to get him, by the end of the season, and what we wanted to have him learn about himself, and we used an Elektra and Frank story throughout, to get him there... we talked about when we watch shows in 13 episode stretches, how do we watch them? What is an exciting structure that we would like to think about here? Do we divide it right down the middle? Do we do a three-act structure?...If you were to sit and watch 13 episodes, you would absolutely feel a structure, much like in the comics. That’s what we did this season.|$|E

500|$|Entering {{his fourth}} season, Washington knew {{the only thing}} keeping him in the league was his {{guaranteed}} contract and that the Lakers had essentially written him off. The organization felt he had the requisite physical skills, so they ascribed his failure to excel to mental deficiencies. Washington was particularly disturbed when {{in a game against}} Golden State, he got into an awkward collision with Rick Barry, upon which Barry remarked: [...] "Listen, you better learn how to play this game." [...] The criticism especially bothered Washington because he felt Barry's rebuke was correct. Desperate to improve, he contacted Pete Newell at the recommendation of an agent. Newell was a retired pro and college coach who worked in a front office position with the Lakers, and had drafted Washington when he was then the team's GM. In truth, while Newell says he felt some responsibility considering he drafted him, he was involved in many player transactions {{over the course of his}} long career, and was not especially attached to Washington. He was surprised by this request, however, and unhappy with his new highly marginalized job within the organization, so Newell agreed to meet Washington for individual drills. He scheduled the practices very early in the morning to test Washington's dedication, thinking a professional athlete would not bother to get up at that hour every day. Washington showed up without complaint and Newell <b>put</b> <b>him</b> <b>through</b> intense training sessions. Newell is often seen as a kind, gentlemanly person, who is considered one of the most important figures in the history of the game of basketball. In private practice, however, he could be an intense, unforgiving teacher, and he was even more unforgiving than usual with Washington as he felt that if he were to offer his services for free he would only do so if the player was willing to train maniacally.|$|E

His performance received unanimous praise from the judges as Randy mentioned that Kim {{has one of the}} best male vocals he has heard this season. In contrast to their early praise, the judges mentioned when they <b>put</b> <b>him</b> <b>through</b> that Paul {{made it to the top}} 24 by [...] "a split decision".

Michael Gold, an eyewitness to Reed's arrival to Manhattan, recalls how [...] "a swarm of Department of Justice men stripped him, went over every inch of his clothes and baggage, and <b>put</b> <b>him</b> <b>through</b> the usual inquisition. Reed had been sick with ptomaine on the boat. The inquisition had also been painful." [...] Back home during mid-summer 1918, Reed, worried that [...] "his vivid impressions on the revolution would fade," [...] fought hard to regain his papers from the possession of the government, who refused to return them.|$|E
2500|$|When Milner was 10 years old, {{he joined}} the Leeds United Academy after being spotted by a scout while playing for Westbrook Juniors in Horsforth. At the academy, Milner played against contemporaries from other clubs in the north, {{including}} future Manchester United striker Wayne Rooney. His role model was Leeds-born Alan Smith, who was then a Leeds United striker. Milner believed playing with Smith <b>put</b> <b>him</b> <b>through</b> a learning curve, as Smith had done what Milner aspired to do; that is, {{to come through the}} academy and play for the first team. Having made good progress at the Academy, Milner was taken on as a trainee after leaving school. However, his father insisted that he attend college once a week to continue his education. Milner remarked later {{that he did not want}} to get excited and think that he had [...] "made it". He also said he could hardly believe he was playing alongside first-team Leeds players such as David Batty and Olivier Dacourt. He continued to excel in the youth team, and played for England at under-15 and under-17 levels. He helped the England under-17 team win the 2002 Nationwide summer tournament against Italy, Czech Republic and Brazil, scoring a goal against the latter. Milner claims to have never consumed alcohol throughout his life, despite pressures from those around him when he was growing up.|$|E
2500|$|In mid-1999, Ventura reappeared on WWF {{television}} {{during his}} term as Governor of Minnesota, {{acting as the}} special guest referee for main event of SummerSlam held in Minneapolis. Ventura would continue {{his relationship with the}} WWF by performing commentary for Vince McMahon's short-lived XFL. On the March 20, 2003 episode of SmackDown!, Ventura appeared in a taped interview to talk about the match between McMahon and Hulk Hogan at WrestleMania XIX. Less than a year later, he would be inducted into the WWE Hall of Fame on March 13, 2004 and the following night at WrestleMania XX, he approached the ring to interview Donald Trump, who had a front row seat at the event. Trump affirmed that Ventura would receive his moral and financial support were he to ever reenter the world of politics. Alluding to the 2008 election, Ventura boldly announced that [...] "In 2008, maybe we oughta put a wrestler in the White House". On the June 11, 2007 episode of Raw, Ventura appeared to give comments about McMahon. Ventura was guest host on the November 23, 2009 episode of Raw, during which he retained his heel persona by siding with the number one contender Sheamus over WWE Champion John Cena. This happened while he confronted Cena about how it was unfair that Cena always got a title shot in the WWE, while Ventura never did during his WWE career. After that, Sheamus attacked Cena and <b>put</b> <b>him</b> <b>through</b> a table. Ventura then made the match a Table match at [...] During the show, {{for the first time in}} nearly 20 years, McMahon joined Ventura at ringside to provide match commentary together.|$|E

2500|$|Regardless, Clooney was {{determined}} {{to stay with the}} role. Loyal to the script, Clooney helped convince executives to support certain aspects of the film (such as the exploding cow scene) even after he was urged to drop out of production, as his contract called for his compensation with or without his decision to stay in the film. After a number of arguments, Clooney wrote Russell a letter that criticized Russell's behavior in a last attempt to make peace between the two, days before another fight would break out during the filming of the movie's finale. In it, the three lead characters attempt to escort Iraqi rebels across the border to Iran. There were a number of actors and extras in the scene, as well as other elements, such as helicopters flying overhead and landing {{in the center of the}} location. The fight began after an extra was having difficulty throwing Ice Cube's character to the ground. After a number of takes, Russell came to the extra and <b>put</b> <b>him</b> <b>through</b> the motions of the action. Some individuals present on the set during the incident state that Russell was simply showing the extra how to convincingly act in the scene. However, Clooney and others thought that Russell had violently thrown the extra to the ground. Clooney recalls: [...] "We were trying to get a shot and then he went berserk. He went nuts on an extra." [...] Clooney approached Russell and began criticizing him again, coming to the extra's defense. The two began shouting at one another before entering a physical fight. Second assistant director Paul Bernard was so fed up with the experience when the fight broke out that he put down his camera and walked off the set, effectively quitting. Clooney concludes, [...] "Will I work with David ever again? Absolutely not. Never. Do I think he's tremendously talented and do I think he should be nominated for Oscars? Yeah." [...] Russell offered a different view, saying [...] "we're both passionate guys who are the two biggest authorities on the set," [...] and maintaining that the two continue to be friends. Ice Cube felt the conflict helped the film, saying [...] "it kind of kicked the set into a different gear where everybody was focused and we finished strong. I wouldn't mind if the director and the star got into an argument on all of my movies." ...|$|E
2500|$|Afterwards La Hermandad started feuding with La Sociedad, a superstable {{consisting}} of invaders from Los Perros del Mal {{and members of}} Los Maniacos, La Legión Extrangera and La Milicia, El Zorro and Hernandez in particular. La Hermandad received their rematch for the AAA World Tag Team Championship from Los Maniacos (Silver King and Último Gladiador) on September 19, 2010, but Lider was forced to enter the match without Nicho, who was taken out by El Zorro, Hernandez and La Legión the previous week, {{and was unable to}} regain the championship. At Héroes Inmortales IV Nicho and Lider gained a measure of revenge on Konnan by defeating him and Perros del Mal members Damián 666 and Halloween in a three–on–two handicap hardcore match. On October 30, 2010, El Zorro defeated Nicho in a Lucha de Apuesta to take his hair. On December 5 at Guerra de Titanes Nicho and Líder received a shot at the AAA World Tag Team Championship, but were unable to dethrone Los Maniacos in a three–way ladder match, which also included Hernandez and El Ilegal. During the first half of 2011, La Hermandad 187 started feuding with La Maniarquía (Chessman, Silver King and Último Gladiador), during which the rudo trio injured Nicho, forcing him out of Triplemanía XIX on June 18. At the event Nicho tried to interfere in the match between Líder, Electroshock and Heavy Metal and La Maniarquía, but was stopped by AAA president Joaquín Roldan, who suspended him from AAA for his interference and had him removed the arena. Prior to the start of his three-month-long suspension, Nicho appeared at the June 30 tapings, voicing his displeasure over the suspension, claiming that he had been there for the company from the beginning even though they had given his name (Psicosis) to another performer [...] "not even close to his level", before noting that he had a son and that if he was suspended without pay, he would have to find work from another promotion. Nicho returned to AAA on July 16, threatening Roldan, which led to Joe Líder trying to calm his partner down. This in turn led to Nicho declaring that if Líder was with Roldan, they were no longer friends. Later in the event, Nicho interfered in Líder's match and turned on him, effectively ending La Hermandad 187. On July 31 at Verano de Escándalo, Nicho attacked Líder during a Monster's Ball match and <b>put</b> <b>him</b> <b>through</b> a flaming table, costing him the match in the process. On August 19, 2011, Nicho attacked Líder again before putting on a Perros del Mal T-shirt, which led to the group's leader El Hijo del Perro Aguayo officially welcoming him to the group, turning rudo in the process. On October 9 at Héroes Inmortales, Los Perros del Mal and Los Psycho Circus ended their year-long rivalry, when Nicho, Damián 666 and Halloween were defeated in a Mask vs. Hair steel cage match, following interference from Joe Líder, and were all shaved bald.|$|E
