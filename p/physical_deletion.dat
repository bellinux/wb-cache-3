After the physical single release, the song climbed to #6, its peak position. The song had a strong chart run initially, spending seven weeks inside the top 30 there, however, because the physical copies of the single were deleted, the single was withdrawn from the chart due to new chart rules stating that singles could only remain in the chart for two weeks after their <b>physical</b> <b>deletion.</b> This is why the record seemingly fell from the UK top 75 from the top 30. The song was also popular on the charts in the U.S., peaking at #16 on the Billboard Hot 100 and topping the chart in New Zealand.|$|E
40|$|Introduction Base tables {{supporting}} transaction {{time are}} ever-growing because all logical updates, including deletions, transform into insertions at the physical level. This contrasts snapshot tables where logical and <b>physical</b> <b>deletion</b> coincide. Logical deletion in TSQL 2 {{was covered in}} 16. As {{there is a need}} for <b>physical</b> <b>deletion</b> capabilities in snapshot tables (and valid-time tables), there is also a need for such capabilities in temporal tables supporting transaction time (i. e., transaction-time tables and bitemporal tables). This chapter is divided into two parts. In the first, the general notion of vacuuming and associated concepts are introduced and motivated. It is shown that straightforward <b>physical</b> <b>deletion</b> may adversely affect the usefulness of query results and that special attention thus should be devoted to the design of appropriate vacuuming facilities. We then give reasons why disciplined vacuuming is a highly desirable capability. Subsequently, the important c...|$|E

40|$|Line {{drawings}} {{are easy}} to recognize, although the only information tc, the visual system is the contour itself. Starting from information theory and a theory of decomposition in parts, we investigated whether certain regions of such a contour are perceptually more relevant than others, using a deletion detection paradigm. In this paradigm, high detectability means poor contour integration, and vice verse. Regions of interest were curvature singularities, namely positive maxima (M+), negative minima (m-) and inflection points (I), of smooth, closed contours. In Experiment 1, we performed a first exploration of the detectability of deletions around these three types of curvature singularities. M+ deletions were easier to detect than the deletions around the other two singularities, a result that is explained using a post hoc combination of both mentioned theoretical frameworks. In Experiment 2, we replicated these findings using figure-background reversal, so that the same <b>physical</b> <b>deletions</b> could either be M+ or m-. Again, the M+ deletions were easier to detect than m- deletions. Although both types of singularities involve regions of high curvature changes, they differ in that m- deletions create gaps that concur with spontaneous segmentation. status: publishe...|$|R

We have previously reported that mature CD 4 -CD 8 + T cells when confronted with their antigen can proliferate extensively but are finally eliminated or become intrinsically anergic such that remaining cells are refractory to stimulation by any T cell receptor ligands, even in the presence of exogenous interleukin 2.

40|$|Chronic viral infections often {{result in}} {{ineffective}} CD 8 T-cell responses due to functional exhaustion or <b>physical</b> <b>deletion</b> of virus-specific T cells. However, how persisting virus impacts various CD 8 T-cell effector functions and influences {{other aspects of}} CD 8 T-cell dynamics, such as immunodominance and tissue distribution, remains largely unknown. Using different strains of lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV), we compared responses to the same CD 8 T-cell epitopes during acute or chronic infection. Persistent infection led to a disruption of the normal immunodominance hierarchy of CD 8 T-cell responses seen following acute infection and dramatically altered the tissue distribution of LCMV-specific CD 8 T cells in lymphoid and nonlymphoid tissues. Most importantly, CD 8 T-cell functional impairment occurred in a hierarchical fashion in chronically infected mice. Production of interleukin 2 {{and the ability to}} lyse target cells in vitro were the first functions compromised, followed by the ability to make tumor necrosis factor alpha, while gamma interferon production was most resistant to functional exhaustion. Antigen appeared to be the driving force for this loss of function, since a strong correlation existed between the viral load and the level of exhaustion. Further, epitopes presented at higher levels in vivo resulted in <b>physical</b> <b>deletion,</b> while those presented at lower levels induced functional exhaustion. A model is proposed in which antigen levels drive the hierarchical loss of different CD 8 T-cell effector functions during chronic infection, leading to distinct stages of functional impairment and eventually to <b>physical</b> <b>deletion</b> of virus-specific T cells. These results have implications for the study of human chronic infections, where similar T-cell deletion and functional dysregulation has been observed...|$|E
40|$|Breast cancer {{susceptibility}} genes BRCA 1 and BRCA 2 are tumour suppressor genes the alleles {{of which}} have to be inactivated before tumour development occurs. Hereditary breast cancers linked to germ-line mutations of BRCA 1 and BRCA 2 genes almost invariably show allelic imbalance (AI) at the respective loci. BRCA 1 and BRCA 2 are believed {{to take part in}} a common pathway in maintenance of genomic integrity in cells. We carried out AI and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) analyses of BRCA 2 in breast tumours from germ-line BRCA 1 mutation carriers and vice versa. For comparison, 14 sporadic breast tumours were also studied. 8 of the 11 (73 %) informative BRCA 1 mutation tumours showed AI at the BRCA 2 locus. 53 % of these tumours showed a copy number loss of the BRCA 2 gene by FISH. 5 of the 6 (83 %) informative BRCA 2 mutation tumours showed AI at the BRCA 1 locus. Half of the tumours (4 / 8) showed a <b>physical</b> <b>deletion</b> of the BRCA 1 gene by FISH. Combined allelic loss of both BRCA 1 and BRCA 2 gene was seen in 12 of the 17 (71 %) informative hereditary tumours, whereas copy number losses of both BRCA genes was seen in only 4 / 14 (29 %) sporadic control tumours studied by FISH. In conclusion, the high prevalence of AI at BRCA 1 in BRCA 2 mutation tumours and vice versa suggests that somatic events occurring at the other breast cancer susceptibility gene locus may be selected in the cancer development. The mechanism resulting in AI at these loci seems more complex than a <b>physical</b> <b>deletion.</b>   [URL] © 2001 Cancer Research Campaig...|$|E

In vitro-studies have established direct relationship between the response to topoII-inhibitors and topoIIa expression level in cancer cells: cells with low nuclear concentrations of topoIIa are less sensitive to topoII-directed drugs than cells containing high amounts of topoIIa. There are no commonly accepted markers available to predict the response to cytotoxic chemotherapy in breast cancer. I studied whether topoIIa can predict the response to topoII-inhibitors in metastatic breast cancer. TopoIIa expression was found be proliferation-dependent in primary breast cancer: rapidly proliferating cancer cells expressed more topoIIa than cancer cells with low proliferation rate. In addition, high topoIIa expression associated with ErbB 2 oncogene overexpression, aneuploidy of the tumor and negative hormone receptor status. The percentage of topoIIa-positive cancer cells could not predict the response to topoII-inhibitor chemotherapy in metastatic breast cancer.

These changes in the protein expression, in turn, altered the sensitivity to topoII-inhibitor in vitro. TopoIIa amplification induced hypersensitivity to topoII-inhibitor, while topoIIa deletion caused primary resistance.

We demonstrate the utility of chromosomal deletion mutations through production of a soybean supernodulation mutant FN 37 that lacks the internal autoregulation of nodulation mechanism. After inoculation with microsymbiont Bradyrhizobium japonicum, FN 37 forms at least 10 times more nodules than the wild type G. soja parent and has a phenotype identical to that of chemically induced allelic mutants nts 382 and nts 1007 (NTS- 1 locus). Reciprocal grafting of shoots and roots confirmed systemic shoot control of the FN 37 nodulation phenotype. RFLP/PCR marker pUTG 132 a and AFLP marker UQC-IS 1 which are tightly linked to NTS- 1 allowed the isolation of BAC contigs delineating both ends of the deletion.

40|$|Topoisomerase IIα (topoIIα) is a {{key enzyme}} in DNA {{replication}} and a molecular target for many anti-cancer drugs called topoII inhibitors. The topoIIα gene is located at chromosome band 17 q 12 -q 21, close to the ErbB- 2 oncogene (HER- 2 /neu), {{which is the most}} commonly amplified oncogene in breast cancer. Because of the physical proximity to ErbB- 2, copy number aberrations may also occur in the topoIIα gene. These topoIIα gene copy number aberrations {{may be related to the}} altered chemosensitivity to topoII inhibitors that breast cancers with ErbB- 2 amplification are known to have. We used fluorescence in situ hybridization to study copy number aberrations of both topoIIα and ErbB- 2 in nine breast cancer cell lines and in 97 clinical breast tumors, which were selected for the study according to their ErbB- 2 status by Southern blotting. TopoIIα-protein expression was studied with Western blot and sensitivity to doxorubicin (a topoII inhibitor) with a 96 -well clonogenic in vitro assay. Two of the five cell lines with ErbB- 2 gene amplification (SK-BR- 3 and UACC- 812) showed amplification of topoIIα. In MDA- 361 cells, ErbB- 2 amplification (14 copies/cell) was associated with a <b>physical</b> <b>deletion</b> of topoIIα (four copies of chromosome 17 centromere and two copies of topoIIα). The topoIIα amplification in UACC- 812 cells was associated with 5. 9 -fold-increased topoIIα protein expression and 2. 5 -fold-increased sensitivity to the topoII inhibitor, doxorubicin, whereas the deletion in MDA- 361 leads to decreased protein expression (45 % of control) and a 2. 4 -fold-increased chemoresistance in vitro. Of 57 ErbB- 2 -amplified primary breast carcinomas, 25 (44 %) showed ErbB- 2 -topoIIα coamplification and 24 (42 %) showed a <b>physical</b> <b>deletion</b> of the topoIIα gene. No topoIIα copy number aberrations were found in 40 primary tumors without ErbB- 2 amplification. TopoIIα gene amplification and deletion are common in ErbB- 2 -amplified breast cancer and are associated with increased or decreased sensitivity to topoII inhibitors in vitro, respectively.

Previous loss of heterozygosity (LOH) analyses identified a consensus minimal deleted region between the markers D 12 S 377 and D 12 S 296, and a YAC clone contig covering the region was generated. Here, we describe a high-resolution sequence-ready physical map of this contig covering a 3 -Mb region. The map comprised of 52 cosmids, 49 PACs, and 168 BACs that were anchored to the previous YAC contig; 99 polymorphic, nonpolymorphic, EST, and gene-based markers are now placed on this map in a unique order. Of these, 61 markers were isolated in the present study, including one that was polymorphic. In addition, we have narrowed the minimal deletion to ∼ 830 kb between D 12 S 1716 (proximal) and P 382 A 8 -AG (distal) by LOH analysis of 108 normal-tumor DNAs from GCT patients using 21 polymorphic STSs.

Despite the continuing decrease in cost of data storage, it is still, for various reasons, not always acceptable that all data be retained forever. Therefore, {{there is a}} need for a new mechanism for the vacuuming, i. e., <b>physical</b> <b>deletion,</b> of data when such tables are being managed. We propose syntax and informal semantics for vacuuming of data from temporal tables in TSQL 2 which support transaction time. The mechanism allows—at schema definition time, as well as later, during the life span of a table—for the specification of so-called cut-off points. A cut-off point for a table is a timestamp that evaluates to a time instant. The timestamp may be either absolute or a bound or unbound now-relative timestamp. Conceptually, the cut-off point indicates that all data, current in the table solely before the (current value of the) timestamp, has been physically deleted. Vacuuming based on cut-off points is an example of a more general notion of vacuuming where arbitrary subsets of data may be physically deleted. ...|$|E

In this study, we describe the tolerization of transgene-specific CTL following administration of �-galactosidase (�gal) -recombinant adenovirus (Ad-LacZ). Using MHC class I tetramers to track �gal-specific CTL, we found that a significant expansion of �gal-specific CTL was restricted to a very narrow dose range. Functional analysis revealed that adenovirus-induced �gal-specific CTL produced only very low amounts of effector cytokines and were unable to exhibit cytolytic activity in a 51 Cr release assay. Furthermore, Ad-LacZ vaccination failed to efficiently clear established �gal-positive tumors. The impaired function of Ad-LacZ-induced CTL correlated {{with the presence of}} persisting �gal Ag in the liver.

Atcoilin is able to bind RNA effectively and in a non-specific manner. This activity is provided by three RNA-binding sites: two sets of basic amino acids in the N-terminal domain and one set in the central domain.

Exhaustion is not a uniformly disabled setting as a gradation of phenotypic and functional defects can manifest, and these cells are distinct from prototypic effector, memory and also anergic T cells.

One way to ensure appropriate use and thus end-to-end accountability of such information is tamper detection in databases via a continuous assurance technology based on cryptographic hashing. In our current research we are working to show how to develop the necessary approaches and ideas to support accountability in high-performance databases. This will include the design of a reference architecture for information accountability and several of its variants, the development of forensic analysis algorithms and their cost model, and a systematic formulation of forensic analysis for determining when the tampering occurred and what data were tampered with. Finally, for privacy, we would like to create mechanisms for allowing as well as (temporarily) preventing the <b>physical</b> <b>deletion</b> of records in a monitored database. In order to evaluate our ideas we will design and implement an integrated tamper detection and forensic analysis system. This work will show that information accountability is a viable alternative to information restriction for ensuring the correct storage, use, and maintenance of databases. 1...|$|E
40|$|Objective To test a {{conceptual}} model linking parental physical activity orientations, parental support for physical activity, and children's self-efficacy perceptions with physical activity participation. Participants and setting The {{sample consisted of}} 380 students in grades 7 through 12 (mean age, 14. 0 ± 1. 6 years) and their parents. Data collection {{took place during the}} fall of 1996. Main outcome measures Parents completed a questionnaire assessing their physical activity habits, enjoyment of physical activity, beliefs regarding the importance of physical activity, and supportive behaviors for their child's physical activity. Students completed a 46 -item inventory assessing physical activity during the previous 7 days and a 5 -item physical activity self-efficacy scale. The model was tested via observed variable path analysis using structural equation modeling techniques (AMOS 4. 0). Results An initial model, in which parent physical activity orientations predicted child physical activity via parental support and child self-efficacy, did not provide an acceptable fit to the data. Inclusion of a direct path from parental support to child <b>physical</b> activity and <b>deletion</b> of a nonsignificant path from parental physical activity to child physical activity significantly improved model fit. Standardized path coefficients for the revised model ranged from 0. 17 to 0. 24, and all were significant at the p< 0. 0001 level. Conclusions Parental support was an important correlate of youth physical activity, acting directly or indirectly through its influence on self-efficacy. Physical activity interventions targeted at youth should include and evaluate the efficacy of individual-level and community-level strategies to increase parents’ capacity to provide instrumental and motivational support for their children's physical activity...|$|R

40|$|Polyphenol oxidases (PPOs) are {{involved}} in the time-dependent darkening and discolouration of Asian noodles and other wheat end products. In this study, a doubled haploid (DH) population derived from Chara (moderately high PPO activity) /WW 2449 (low PPO activity) was screened for PPO activity based on L-DOPA and Ltyrosine assays using whole seeds. Both these assays were significantly genetically correlated (r= 0. 91) in measuring the PPO activity in this DH population. Quantitative trait loci (QTLs) analysis utilising a skeleton map enabled us to identify a major QTL controlling PPO activity based on LDOPA and L-tyrosine on the long arm of chromosome 2 A. The simple sequence repeat (SSR) marker GWM 294 b explained over 82 % of the line mean phenotypic variation from samples collected in both 2000 and 2003. Four SSR markers were validated for PPO linkage in genetically diverse backgrounds and proven to correctly predict the PPO activity in more than 92 % of wheat lines. <b>Physical</b> mapping using <b>deletion</b> lines of Chinese Spring has confirmed the location of the GWM 294 b, GWM 312 and WMC 170 on chromosome 2 AL, between deletion breakpoints 2 AL-C to 0. 85. In order to identify functional gene markers, data searches for alignments between rice BAC/PAC clones assembled on chromosome 1 and 4, chromosome 7, and (1) the wheat expressed sequence tags mapped in deletion bin (2 AL-C to 0. 85) and (2) the coding sequence of a previously cloned wheat PPO gene were made and found significant sequence similarities with the PPO gene or common central domain of tyrosinase. Available PPO gene sequences in the National Centre for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) database have revealed that there is a significant molecular diversity at the nucleotide and amino acid level in the wheat PPO genes...|$|R

40|$|Hepatitis C virus (HCV) becomes {{persistent}} in {{the majority}} of infected individuals. In doing so, the virus evades host adaptive immune responses, although the mechanisms responsible in this evasion are not clear. Several groups have demonstrated weak or absent HCV-specific CD 4 + T cell responses during chronic HCV infection using proliferation assays and, more recently, class II tetramers. However, the functional status of HCV-specific CD 4 + T cells in resolved and persistent infection is poorly understood. Using interferon gamma (IFN-gamma) and interleukin 2 (IL- 2) enzyme-linked immunospot assays, we analyzed cytokine secretion patterns in chronically infected patients and compared them with those with resolved infection. In the spontaneous resolver group, strong IL- 2 secretion in relation to IFN-gamma secretion was observed. However, in the persistently infected group, a consistent and significant loss of IL- 2 -secreting cells, compared with IFN-gamma-secreting cells, was identified. In vitro addition of IL- 2 had a substantial effect in restoring CD 4 + T cell activity. In conclusion, failure of IL- 2 secretion, as opposed to <b>physical</b> <b>deletion</b> or complete functional unresponsiveness, appears to be an important determinant of the status of CD 4 + T cell populations in chronic HCV infection. Loss of IL- 2 secretory capacity may lead to disruption of IFN-gamma and proliferative function in vivo a status that characterizes the cellular immune response in both CD 4 + and CD 8 + compartments in chronic disease...|$|E
40|$|Copy-number {{variants}} (CNVs) are {{an abundant}} form of genetic variation in humans. However, approaches for determining exact CNV breakpoint sequences (<b>physical</b> <b>deletion</b> or duplication boundaries) across individuals, crucial for associating genotype to phenotype, have been lacking so far, {{and the vast}} majority of CNVs have been reported with approximate genomic coordinates only. Here, we report an approach, called BreakPtr, for fine-mapping CNVs (available from [URL] We statistically integrate both sequence characteristics and data from high-resolution comparative genome hybridization experiments in a discrete-valued, bivariate hidden Markov model. Incorporation of nucleotide-sequence information allows us to take into account the fact that recently duplicated sequences (e. g., segmental duplications) often coincide with breakpoints. In anticipation of an upcoming increase in CNV data, we developed an iterative, “active” approach to initially scoring with a preliminary model, performing targeted validations, retraining the model, and then rescoring, and a flexible parameterization system that intuitively collapses from a full model of 2, 503 parameters to a core one of only 10. Using our approach, we accurately mapped > 400 breakpoints on chromosome 22 and a region of chromosome 11, refining the boundaries of many previously approximately mapped CNVs. Four predicted breakpoints flanked known disease-associated deletions. We validated an additional four predicted CNV breakpoints by sequencing. Overall, our results suggest a predictive resolution of ≈ 300 bp. This level of resolution enables more precise correlations between CNVs and across individuals than previously possible, allowing the study of CNV population frequencies. Further, it enabled us to demonstrate a clear Mendelian pattern of inheritance for one of the CNVs...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: CD 4 + T cell help is {{critical}} in maintaining antiviral immune responses and such help {{has been shown to}} be sustained in acute resolving hepatitis C. In contrast, in evolving chronic hepatitis C CD 4 + T cell helper responses appear to be absent or short-lived, using functional assays. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Here we used a novel HLA-DR 1 tetramer containing a highly targeted CD 4 + T cell epitope from the hepatitis C virus non-structural protein 4 to track number and phenotype of hepatitis C virus specific CD 4 + T cells in a cohort of seven HLA-DR 1 positive patients with acute hepatitis C in comparison to patients with chronic or resolved hepatitis C. We observed peptide-specific T cells in all seven patients with acute hepatitis C regardless of outcome at frequencies up to 0. 65 % of CD 4 + T cells. Among patients who transiently controlled virus replication we observed loss of function, and/or <b>physical</b> <b>deletion</b> of tetramer+ CD 4 + T cells before viral recrudescence. In some patients with chronic hepatitis C very low numbers of tetramer+ cells were detectable in peripheral blood, compared to robust responses detected in spontaneous resolvers. Importantly we did not observe escape mutations in this key CD 4 + T cell epitope in patients with evolving chronic hepatitis C. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: During acute hepatitis C a CD 4 + T cell response against this epitope is readily induced in most, if not all, HLA-DR 1 + patients. This antiviral T cell population becomes functionally impaired or is deleted early in the course of disease in those where viremia persists...|$|E
40|$|The {{effector}} {{function of}} CD 8 T cells is mediated via cell-mediated cytotoxicity {{and production of}} cytokines like gamma interferon (IFN-γ) and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α). While the roles of perforin-dependent cytotoxicity, IFN-γ, and TNF-α in controlling acute viral infections are well studied, their relative importance in defense against chronic viral infections is not well understood. Using mice deficient for TNF receptor (TNFR) I and/or II, we show that TNF-TNFR interactions have a dual role in mediating viral clearance and downregulating CD 8 and CD 4 T-cell responses during a chronic lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) infection. While wild-type (+/+) and TNFR II-deficient (p 75 −/−) mice cleared LCMV from the liver and lung, mice deficient in TNFR I (p 55 −/−) or both TNFR I and TNFR II (double knockout [DKO]) exhibited impaired viral clearance. The inability of p 55 −/− and DKO mice to clear LCMV was not a sequel to either suboptimal activation of virus-specific CD 8 or CD 4 T cells or impairment in trafficking of LCMV-specific CD 8 T cells to the liver and lung. In fact, the expansion of LCMV-specific CD 8 and CD 4 T cells was significantly higher in DKO mice compared to that in +/+, p 55 −/−, and p 75 −/− mice. TNFR deficiency did not preclude the <b>physical</b> <b>deletion</b> of CD 8 T cells specific for nucleoprotein 396 to 404 but delayed the contraction of CD 8 T-cell responses to the epitopes GP 33 - 41 and GP 276 - 285 in the viral glycoprotein. The antibody response to LCMV was not significantly altered by TNFR deficiency. Taken together, these findings have implications in development of immunotherapy in chronic viral infections of humans...|$|E
