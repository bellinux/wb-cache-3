50|$|There are, however, a few {{problems}} with some syntheses. The Piloty-Robinson reaction competes with {{the formation of}} <b>pyrazoline</b> when the reactant is an aliphatic azine derived from a ketone. Also, under high temperatures and highly acidic solutions, azines derived from aldehydes are not stable. This prevents the formation of 2,5-disubstituted pyrroles (where R=H) using this method.|$|E
50|$|For example, {{diazomethane}} generally adds to {{methyl acrylate}} to give 3-carboxyl <b>pyrazoline.</b> However, by putting more steric demands into the system, {{we start to}} observe the isomeric 4-carboxyl pyrazolines. The ratio of these two regioisomers depends on the steric demands.

50|$|Certain diazo compounds, such as diazomethane, {{can react}} with olefins to produce cyclopropanes in a 2 step manner. The first step {{involves}} a 1,3-dipolar cycloaddition {{to form a}} <b>pyrazoline</b> which then undergoes denitrogenation, either photochemically or by thermal decomposition, to give cyclopropane. The thermal route, which often uses KOH and platinum as catalysts, {{is also known as}} the Kishner cyclopropane synthesis after the Russian chemist Nikolai Kischner and can also be performed using hydrazine and α,β-unsaturated carbonyl compounds. The mechanism of decomposition {{has been the subject of}} several studies and remains somewhat controversial, although it is broadly thought to proceed via a diradical species. In terms of green chemistry this method is superior to other carbene based cyclopropanations; as it does not involve metals or halogenated reagents, and produces only N2 as a by-product. However the reaction can be dangerous as trace amounts of unreacted diazo compounds may explode during the thermal rearrangement of the <b>pyrazoline.</b>|$|E
50|$|In {{one study}} it is {{attempted}} to trap any reactive intermediate of this reaction with an internal alkene.

The actual process taking place is path A with elimination of HI to the diazo compound 4 followed by a diazoalkane 1,3-dipolar cycloaddition to the <b>pyrazoline</b> 5 in 85% yield.|$|E

50|$|Azoles are a {{class of}} five-membered heterocyclic {{compounds}} containing a nitrogen atom {{and at least one}} other non-carbon atom (i.e. nitrogen, sulfur, or oxygen) as part of the ring. Their names originate from the Hantzsch-Widman nomenclature. The parent compounds are aromatic and have two double bonds; there are successively reduced analogs (azolines and azolidines) with fewer. One, and only one, lone pair of electrons from each heteroatom in the ring is part of the aromatic bonding in an azole. Names of azoles maintain the prefix upon reduction (e.g., <b>pyrazoline,</b> pyrazolidine). The numbering of ring atoms in azoles starts with the heteroatom that is not part of a double bond, and then proceeds towards the other heteroatom.|$|E

This reaction scheme is well suited for the purpose of labeling in live cells, because UV light at 365 nm damages cells minimally. Moreover, the reaction proceeds quickly, so that the UV light can be administered for short durations. Finally, the non-fluorogenic reactants give rise to a fluorogenic product, equipping the reaction with a built-in spectrometry handle.|$|E
