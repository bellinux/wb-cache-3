40|$|Chronic groin pain is {{a common}} symptom in the {{football}} and hockey codes. Although {{there is a large}} differential diagnosis, this review focuses upon the peri-pubic causes of isolated groin pain (<b>pubalgia).</b> Publications that included a hypothesis of the cause of <b>pubalgia</b> were reviewed. The competing views were that <b>pubalgia</b> arises from a single pathology, multiple unrelated pathologies, and multiple interdependent pathologies. An interdependent model is the most practical, in the absence of scientific proof for either paradigm. Posterior inguinal canal deficiency is established as a common finding in male athletes, but it may be asymptomatic. Osteitis pubis and insertional adductor tendinopathy are also both common entities that often are considered to coexist. Overuse in sports involving kicking, sprinting, and changing direction is implicated as a cause of <b>pubalgia</b> by all paradigms. Various surgeries to the pubic region may achieve results by i) correcting a force imbalance at the pubic symphysis and surrounding pubic rami created by abnormal adductor and abdominal muscles; ii) reducing compartment pressures; and iii) enforcing a rest period and gradual resumption of activities.

40|$|Chronic groin pain in athletes {{represents}} a major diagnostic and therapeutic challenge in sports medicine. Two recognized causes of inguinal {{pain in the}} young adult athlete are core muscle injury/athletic <b>pubalgia</b> (CMI/AP) and femoroacetabular impingement (FAI). CMI/AP and FAI were previously considered to be two distinct entities, however recent studies have suggested both entities to frequently coincide in the athlete with groin pain.

40|$|Hip and groin pain are {{a common}} {{complaint}} among athletes of all ages, and may result from an acute injury or from chronic, repetitive trauma. Hip injuries can be intraarticular, extraarticular, or both. Labral abnormalities may occur in asymptomatic patients {{as well as in}} those with incapacitating symptoms and signs. Athletic hip injury leading to disabling intraarticular hip pain most commonly involves labral tear. The extraarticular causes are usually the result of overuse activity, leading to inflammation, tendonitis, or bursitis.

30|$|Extracorporeal {{shock wave}} therapy (ESWT) {{is one of}} the great {{advances}} in orthopaedics over the last 20  years [1]. Initially indicated for the treatment of kidney stones [2], it has been applied in cases of bone non-unions, and then in several musculoskeletal disorders, given the satisfactory clinical outcomes reported in different randomized clinical trials and cohort studies. The main indications have been the following: lateral epicondylitis of the elbow, calcific tendonitis of the rotator cuff, plantar fasciitis, Achilles and patellar tendinopathy, and <b>pubalgia</b> [1, 3 – 13]. A reduction of pain and a good recovery of articular function have been obtained in most cases [13 – 17], even if in high-level athletes a more aggressive strategy is recommended to allow a quick return to sports activities [18].|$|E
40|$|Recent studies {{described}} that MRI {{is a good}} examination {{to assess}} damage in chronic athletic <b>pubalgia</b> (AP). However, to our knowledge, no studies focus on systematic correlation of precise tendon or parietal lesion in MRI with surgery and histological assessment. Therefore, we performed a case-control study to determine if MRI can precisely assess Adductor longus (AL) tendinopathy and parietal lesion, compared with surgery and histology. MRI can determine if AP comes from pubis symphysis, musculotendinous or inguinal orifice structures. Eighteen consecutive patients were enrolled from November  2011 to April  2013 for chronic AP. To constitute a control group, we also enrolled 18  asymptomatic men. All MRI were reviewed in consensus by 2  skeletal radiologists for pubic symphysis, musculotendinous, abdominal wall assessment and compared to surgery and histology findings. Regarding pubis symphysis, we found 4  symmetric bone marrow oedema (14 %), 2  secondary cleft (7 %) and 2  superior ligaments lesions (7 %). For AL tendon, we mainly found 13  asymmetric bone marrow oedema (46 %), 15  hyperaemia (54 %). Regarding abdominal wall, the deep inguinal orifice size {{in the group of}} symptomatic athletes and the control group was respectively 27. 3 ± 6. 4 mm and 23. 8 ± 6. 3 mm. The correlation between MRI and surgery/histology was low: 20 % for the AL tendon and 9 % for the abdominal wall. If we chose the criteria "affected versus unaffected", this correlation became higher: 100 % for AL tendon and 73 % for the abdominal wall. MRI chronic athletic <b>pubalgia</b> concerns preferentially AL tendinopathy and deep inguinal canal dehiscence with high correlation to surgery/histology when only considering the item "affected versus unaffected" despite low correlation when we try to precisely grade these lesions.

40|$|Recent {{publicity}} and some scientific reports suggest increasing success in treating an entity called “sports hernia” - more accurately named athletic <b>pubalgia.</b> The {{primary purpose of}} this article is to portray what we believe to be the key concept for understanding this wide variety of abdominal and groin injuries that afflict high performance athletes. These injuries have been plaguing athletes for a long time, and past treatments, based on concepts of occult hernia or simple strains, have generally failed. The former concepts do not take into account the likely mechanisms of injury or various patterns of pain that these athletes exhibit. The authors believe that the concept of a 2 ̆ 2 pubic joint 2 ̆ 2 or 2 ̆ 2 pubic dynamic complex 2 ̆ 2 is fundamental to understanding the anatomy and pertinent pathophysiology in these patients. Many injuries can now be treated successfully. Some of the injuries require surgery and others do not.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{discuss the}} case of a 49 -year-old man who {{presented}} to the sports medicine staff with pelvic pain of 10 years 2 ̆ 7 duration consistent with pudendal neuralgia. BACKGROUND: Testicular pain in men is often provoked by direct trauma or may indicate an oncologic process. DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS: Epididymitis, athletic <b>pubalgia,</b> testicular tumor, sacroiliac joint dysfunction, lumbar radiculopathy. TREATMENT: The patient responded positively to treatment and rehabilitation to restore normal mechanics to the lumbo-pelvic-hip complex. Several flare-ups since the initial treatment have been of short duration (days) and less intense. UNIQUENESS: Pudendal neuralgia tends to affect females more than males due to changes in the alignment and stability of the pelvis from a combination of a shorter, wider pelvis and muscle imbalances associated with childbirth. Typically, males with testicular pain suffer from epididymitis or some type of testicular torsion, which was not the situation in this case. Compression is also a common cause of pudendal neuralgia, although it was not responsible for this patient 2 ̆ 7 s pain, making diagnosis and treatment complex. CONCLUSIONS: Many pain syndromes can be treated with removal of the original stimulus. However, recognizing the factors contributing to pelvic pain and dysfunction in males can be a challenge for the sports medicine professional. A vigilant and unassuming approach to male pelvic pain is warranted, particularly by health care providers in diverse practice settings...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVE: to {{evaluate}} the return to sport after surgical treatment for <b>pubalgia</b> among 30 professional soccer players and describe the surgical technique used. METHOD: this case series was evaluated {{by means of a}} questionnaire and physical examination on 30 male professional soccer players of mean age 24. 4 years (range: 18 - 30). The mean duration of the symptoms was 18. 6 months (range: 13 - 28). The diagnosis was made through clinical investigation, special maneuvers and complementary examinations, by the same examiner. All the patients underwent surgical treatment after conservative treatment failed; all procedures were performed by the same surgeon using the same technique. Nonparametric comparisons were made to investigate the time taken to recover after the surgery, for the patients to return to their sport. RESULTS: five patients evolved with hematoma, with the need to remove the stitches three weeks after the operation because of a small dehiscence {{at the site of the}} operative wound. The wound healed completely in all these cases by five weeks after the surgery. Four patients presented dysuria in the first week, but improved in the second postoperative week. The mean time taken to return to training was around eight weeks (range: seven-nine). All the players returned to competitive soccer practice within 16 weeks. When asked about their degree of satisfaction after the operation (satisfied or dissatisfied), taking into consideration their return to the sport, there was 100 % satisfaction, and they returned to professional practice at the same competitive level as before the injury. This degree of satisfaction continued to the last assessment, which was made after 36 months of postoperative follow-up. CONCLUSION: the surgical technique presented in this case series, with trapezoidal resection of the pubic symphysis in association with bilateral partial tenotomy of the long adductor, was a fast and effective procedure with a low rate of postoperative complications. It was shown to be an excellent treatment option for refractory cases, with a return to sports activity among professional soccer players...|$|E
