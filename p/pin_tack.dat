F. Schulz, St. Paul, Minn." [...] and [...] "Drawn by 'Sparky'" [...] (C.F. was his father, Carl Fred Schulz).|$|R

50|$|The {{presence}} of full-time specialists {{seems to be}} attested already in the first Chalcolithic period. Regarding the metal production, in Hissar I were made both weapons (daggers, knife blades, arrowheads) and other tools (<b>pins,</b> <b>tacks,</b> points and needles). In Hissar II and III copper artifacts increase in quality and variety and include personal ornaments (earrings, pendants, bracelets, bands), tools and weapons (bidents, lances, mattocks, chisels, mace heads), and luxury items (vessels, mirrors, boxes and intricately cast pins and rods).|$|R
5000|$|In {{woodworking}} and construction, a nail is a pin-shaped {{object of}} metal (or wood, called a treenail or [...] "trunnel") {{which is used}} as a fastener, as a peg to hang something, or sometimes as a decoration. Generally, nails have a sharp point on one end and a flattened head on the other, but headless nails are available. Nails are made in a great variety of forms for specialized purposes. The most common is a wire nail. Other types of nails include <b>pins,</b> <b>tacks,</b> s, and cleats.|$|R

50|$|A {{thumb tack}} (North American English) or push pin {{is a short}} nail or pin used to fasten items to a wall or board for display and {{intended}} to be inserted by hand, generally without the assistance of tools. A variety of names are {{used to refer to}} different designs intended for various purposes. Thumb <b>tack</b> and push <b>pin</b> are both sometimes compounded (thumbtack or pushpin) or hyphenated (thumb-tack or push-pin). Thumb tacks made of brass, tin or iron may be referred to as brass <b>tacks,</b> brass <b>pins,</b> tin <b>tacks</b> or iron tacks, respectively. These terms are particularly used in the idiomatic expression to come (or get) down to brass (or otherwise) tacks, meaning to consider basic facts of a situation. Drawing pin or drawing-pin refers to thumb tacks used to hold drawings on drawing boards. Map <b>pin</b> or map <b>tack</b> refers to thumb tacks used to mark locations on a map and to hold the map in place.|$|R
40|$|A 69 -year-old female {{presented}} {{as an emergency}} with atrial fibrillation, which was treated with warfarin. She subsequently developed fresh rectal bleeding and after further investigations a Dukes B adenocarcinoma of the rectum was found. She subsequently underwent a low anterior resection, coloanal anastamosis and a defunctioning ileostomy. Three sterile surgical metallic <b>tacks</b> (<b>pins)</b> were inserted into the sacrum to stop brisk bleeding from the presacral venous plexus. Following discharge, she was readmitted with septic shock and a CT scan revealed a presacral fluid collection in the area surrounding the sacral <b>tacks</b> (<b>pins)</b> and an anastamotic dehiscence. The patient was not fit for further pelvic surgery to remove the tacks, so an alternative minimally invasive cystoscopic procedure was performed. The sacral <b>tacks</b> (<b>pins)</b> were removed by the urologist using a rigid cystoscope and cold cup biopsy forceps. To our knowledge, {{this is the first}} reported case in the literature.

The photograph shows several separated field of groves with a small structure among them on the left.

Taller trees encircle a clearing of land in the background where the town sits at the foot of faint hills...|$|R
25|$|Machine {{quilting}} is {{the process}} of using a home sewing machine or a longarm machine to sew the layers together. With the home sewing machine, the layers are tacked together before quilting. This involves laying the top, batting, and backing out on a flat surface and either pinning (using large safety <b>pins)</b> or <b>tacking</b> the layers together. Longarm quilting involves placing the layers to be quilted on a special frame. The frame has bars on which the layers are rolled, keeping these together without the need for <b>tacking</b> or <b>pinning.</b> These frames are used with a professional sewing machine mounted on a platform. The platform rides along tracks so that the machine can be moved across the layers on the frame. A longarm machine is moved across the fabric. In contrast, the fabric is moved through a home sewing machine.|$|R
60|$|Ans. That {{there is}} no such order in that {{commission}} as you feign, I have proved. As for your far-fetch'd instance (1 Chron 15), it is quite beside your purpose. The express word was, That the priest, not a cart, should bear the ark of God. Also they were not to touch it, and yet Uzza did (Exo 25:14; 1 Chron 15:12-16; Num 4:15; 1 Chron 13). Now, if you can make that 28th of Matthew say, Receive none that are not baptized first; or that Christ would have them of his, that are not yet baptized, kept ignorant of all other truths that respect church communion; then you say something, else you do but raise a mist before the simple reader: but whoso listeth may hang on your sleeve. As for the <b>pins</b> and <b>tacks</b> of the tabernacle, they were expressly commanded; and when you have proved by the word of God, That you ought to shut saints out of your communion for want of baptism, then you may begin more justly to make your parallel. How fitly you have urged (Eze 44) to insinuate that unbaptized believers are like the uncircumcised in heart and flesh, I leave it to all gospel-novices to consider.|$|R
6000|$|The form of {{saltation}} suggested Mr. Catlin's drawings. A circular {{procession of}} children, {{as well as}} adults, first promenaded round the princess, who danced with all her might in the centre, her countenance preserving the grand sérieux. The performers in this [...] "ging-a-ring" [...] then clapped hands with prolonged ejaculations of o-o-o-oh, stamped and shuffled forwards, moving the body from the hips downwards, whilst H. R. H. alone stood stationary and smileless as a French demoiselle of the last century, {{who came to the}} ball not to causer but to danser. At times, when King Fitevanga condescended to show his agility, the uproar of applause became deafening. The orchestra consisted of two men sitting opposite each other,--one performed on a caisson, a log of hollowed wood, four feet high, skin-covered, and fancifully carved; the other on the national Anjyá, a rude [...] "Marimba," [...] the prototype of the pianoforte. It is made of seven or eight hard- wood slats, <b>pinned</b> with bamboo <b>tacks</b> to transverse banana trunks lying on the ground: like the grande caisse, it is played upon with sticks, plectra like tent-pegs. Mr. W. Winwood Reade ("Savage Africa," [...] chap, xiii.) says: [...] "The instrument is also described by Froebel as being used by the Indians of Central America, where, which is still more curious, it is known by the same name--'marimba.'" [...] Of course they borrowed the article and the name from the negroes: most tribes in Africa have their own terms for this universal instrument, but it is everywhere recognized by the African who knows Europeans as [...] "marimba." [...] Thus Owen tells us (p. 308) [...] "that {{at the mouth of the}} Zambesi it is called 'Tabbelah,'" [...] evidently the Arabic [...] "Tablah" [...] Another favourite instrument is a clapper, made of two bamboos some five feet long, and thick as capstan bars,--it is truly the castanet en grand.|$|R
