5|$|In 1931, Everett H. Kimmell, another U.S. Surveyor, {{found this}} newer stone had broken too and he {{replaced}} it with a brass disc marker set in cement. In 1962, the Bureau of Land Management and the Bureau of Indian Affairs poured an elevated cement pad around the 1931 brass marker; this pad included the state border lines and names in tile. The monument was completely rebuilt in 1992, and the 1931 brass marker was replaced with a disc shaped aluminum-bronze <b>plate</b> <b>set</b> in granite. The monument was again rebuilt in 2010, although the disc shaped plate from 1992 remained in place.|$|E

It has a large inscribed brass <b>plate</b> <b>set</b> in marble showing the genealogical links between the Bold family and the Tudor dynasty. There are two 18th-century memorials on the north wall of the nave, less elaborate than the Bold memorial.|$|E
2500|$|Jones next {{crossed the}} Solway Firth from Whitehaven to Scotland, hoping to hold for ransom the Earl of Selkirk, {{who lived on}} St Mary's Isle near Kirkcudbright. The Earl, Jones reasoned, could be {{exchanged}} for American sailors impressed into the Royal Navy. The Earl was discovered to be absent from his estate, so his wife entertained the officers and conducted negotiations. Canadian historian Peter C. Newman gives credit to the governess for protecting the young heir and to the butler for filling a sack half with coal, and topping {{it up with the}} family silver, in order to fob off the Americans. Jones claimed that he intended to return directly to his ship and continue seeking prizes elsewhere, but his crew wished to [...] "pillage, burn, and plunder all they could". Ultimately, Jones allowed the crew to seize a silver <b>plate</b> <b>set</b> adorned with the family's emblem to placate their desires, but nothing else. Jones bought the plate himself when it was later sold off in France, and returned it to the Earl of Selkirk after the war.|$|E

After he had several times lighted a cigar and let it go out again, Breckenridge glanced at him deprecatingly.|$|E
60|$|Then a {{door opened}} {{at the far side}} of the chamber and a strange, dried up, little mummy of a man came toward me. He wore but a single article of {{clothing}} or adornment, a small collar of gold from which depended upon his chest a great ornament as large as a dinner <b>plate</b> <b>set</b> solid with huge diamonds, except for the exact center which was occupied by a strange stone, an inch in diameter, that scintillated nine different and distinct rays; the seven colors of our earthly prism and two beautiful rays which, to me, were new and nameless.

40|$|The {{experimental}} {{behavior of}} spinning laminated composite pretwisted plates (turbo-fan blade-like) with small (less than 10 % by volume) integral viscoelastic damping patches was investigated at NASA-Lewis Research Center. Ten different <b>plate</b> <b>sets</b> were experimentally spin tested {{and the resulting}} data was analyzed. The first-four <b>plate</b> <b>sets</b> investigated tailoring patch locations and definitions to damp specific modes on spinning flat graphite/epoxy plates {{as a function of}} rotational speed. The remaining six <b>plate</b> <b>sets</b> investigated damping patch size and location on specific modes of pretwisted (30 degrees) graphite/epoxy plates. The results reveal that: (1) significant amount of damping can be added using a small amount of damping material, (2) the damped plates experienced no failures up to the tested 28, 000 g's and 750, 000 cycles, (3) centrifugal loads caused an increase in bending frequencies and corresponding reductions in bending damping levels that are proportional to the bending stiffness increase, and (4) the centrifugal loads caused a decrease in torsion natural frequency and increase in damping levels of pretwisted composite plates...|$|R
