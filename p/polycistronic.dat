5|$|A third protein can {{sometimes}} be involved in type II toxin-antitoxin systems. In {{the case of the}} aforementioned MazEF addiction module, in addition to the toxin and antitoxin there is a regulatory protein involved called MazG. MazG protein interacts with E. colis Era GTPase and is described as a 'nucleoside triphosphate pyrophosphohydrolase,' which hydrolyses nucleoside triphosphates to monophosphates. Later research showed that MazG is transcribed in the same <b>polycistronic</b> mRNA as MazE and MazF, and that MazG bound the MazF toxin to further inhibit its activity.|$|E
5|$|Many prokaryotic {{genes are}} {{organized}} into operons, with multiple protein-coding sequences that are transcribed as a unit. The genes in an operon are transcribed {{as a continuous}} messenger RNA, {{referred to as a}} <b>polycistronic</b> mRNA. The term cistron in this context is equivalent to gene. The transcription of an operon’s mRNA is often controlled by a repressor that can occur in an active or inactive state depending on the presence of certain specific metabolites. When active, the repressor binds to a DNA sequence {{at the beginning of the}} operon, called the operator region, and represses transcription of the operon; when the repressor is inactive transcription of the operon can occur (see e.g. Lac operon). The products of operon genes typically have related functions and are involved in the same regulatory network.|$|E
25|$|An operon {{contains}} {{one or more}} structural genes {{which are}} generally transcribed into one <b>polycistronic</b> mRNA (a single mRNA molecule that codes {{for more than one}} protein). However, the definition of an operon does not require the mRNA to be <b>polycistronic,</b> though in practice, it usually is. Upstream of the structural genes lies a promoter sequence which provides a site for RNA polymerase to bind and initiate transcription. Close to the promoter lies a section of DNA called an operator.|$|E
25|$|The genomes {{of three}} Leishmania species (L. major, L. infantum, and L. braziliensis) have been sequenced, {{and this has}} {{provided}} much information about the biology of the parasite. For example, in Leishmania, protein-coding genes are understood to be organized as large <b>polycistronic</b> units in a head-to-head or tail-to-tail manner; RNA polymerase II transcribes long <b>polycistronic</b> messages {{in the absence of}} defined RNA pol II promoters, and Leishmania has unique features with respect to the regulation of gene expression in response to changes in the environment. The new knowledge from these studies may help identify new targets for urgently needed drugs and aid the development of vaccines.|$|E
25|$|After {{the host}} cell is infected, HPV16 early {{promoter}} is activated and a <b>polycistronic</b> primary RNA containing all six early ORFs is transcribed. This <b>polycistronic</b> RNA contains three exons and two introns and undergoes active RNA splicing to generate multiple isoforms of mRNAs. One of the spliced isoform RNAs, E6*I, {{serves as an}} E7 mRNA to translate E7 oncoprotein. In contrast, an intron in the E6 ORF that remains intact without splicing is necessary for translation of E6 oncoprotein. However, viral early transcription subjects to viral E2 regulation and high E2 levels repress the transcription. HPV genomes integrate into host genome by disruption of E2 ORF, preventing E2 repression on E6 and E7. Thus, viral genome integration into host DNA genome increases E6 and E7 expression to promote cellular proliferation and the chance of malignancy.|$|E
25|$|For some RNA (non-coding RNA) {{the mature}} RNA {{is the final}} gene product. In the case of {{messenger}} RNA (mRNA) the RNA is an information carrier coding for the synthesis {{of one or more}} proteins. mRNA carrying a single protein sequence (common in eukaryotes) is monocistronic whilst mRNA carrying multiple protein sequences (common in prokaryotes) is known as <b>polycistronic.</b>|$|E
25|$|A major viral late {{promoter}} in viral early region becomes active only in differentiated {{cells and}} its activity {{can be highly}} enhanced by viral DNA replication. The late transcript is also a <b>polycistronic</b> RNA which contains two introns and three exons.

25|$|Originally, operons {{were thought}} to exist solely in prokaryotes (which {{includes}} organelles like plastids that are derived from bacteria), but since {{the discovery of the}} first operons in eukaryotes in the early 1990s, more evidence has arisen to suggest they are more common than previously assumed. In general, expression of prokaryotic operons leads to the generation of <b>polycistronic</b> mRNAs, while eukaryotic operons lead to monocistronic mRNAs.|$|E
25|$|In animal mitochondria, each DNA strand is {{transcribed}} continuously {{and produces}} a <b>polycistronic</b> RNA molecule. Between most (but not all) protein-coding regions, tRNAs are present (see the human mitochondrial genome map). During transcription, the tRNAs acquire their characteristic L-shape that gets recognized and cleaved by specific enzymes. With the mitochondrial RNA processing, individual mRNA, rRNA, and tRNA sequences are {{released from the}} primary transcript. Folded tRNAs therefore act as secondary structure punctuations.|$|E
25|$|When {{transcription}} {{takes place}} on the heavy strand a <b>polycistronic</b> transcript is created. The light strand produces either small transcripts, {{which can be used}} as primers, or one long transcript. The production of primers occurs by processing of light strand transcripts with the Mitochondrial RNase MRP (Mitochondrial RNA Processing). The requirement of transcription to produce primers links the process of transcription to mtDNA replication. Full length transcripts are cut into functional tRNA, rRNA, and mRNA molecules.|$|E
25|$|Spot42 can {{interact}} directly with mRNA targets through base pairing. The first Spot 42 target {{was discovered by}} Møller et al. who showed that Spot 42 specifically binds to a short complementary region at the translation initiation region of galK (encodes a galactoinase). galK is the third gene in the galactose operon, which contains four genes (galETKM) and produces a <b>polycistronic</b> mRNA. Spot 42 mediates discoordinate expression of the gal operon (i.e., the individual genes in the operon are not similarly expressed) by binding to the galK Shine-Dalgarno region, thereby blocking ribosome binding and translation of the galK gene. The physiological significance of the coordinate expression is unclear, but suggests that Spot 42 {{plays a role in}} fine-tuning gene expression to optimize the utilization of carbon sources.|$|E

2500|$|... 75% {{of plant}} viruses have genomes that consist of single {{stranded}} RNA (ssRNA). 65% of plant viruses have +ssRNA, {{meaning that they}} are in the same sense orientation as messenger RNA but 10% have -ssRNA, meaning they must be converted to +ssRNA before they can be translated. 5% are double stranded RNA and so can be immediately translated as +ssRNA viruses. 3% require a reverse transcriptase enzyme to convert between RNA and DNA. 17% of plant viruses are ssDNA and very few are dsDNA, in contrast a quarter of animal viruses are dsDNA and three quarters of bacteriophage are dsDNA. Viruses use the plant ribosomes to produce the 4-10 proteins encoded by their genome. However, since many of the proteins are encoded on a single strand (that is, they are <b>polycistronic)</b> this will mean that the ribosome will either only produce one protein, as it will terminate translation at the first stop codon, or that a polyprotein will be produced. Plant viruses have had to evolve special techniques to allow the production of viral proteins by plant cells.|$|E

50|$|An mRNA {{molecule}} {{is said to}} be monocistronic when {{it contains}} the genetic information to translate only a single protein chain (polypeptide).

These polypeptides usually have a related function (they often are the subunits composing a final complex protein) and their coding sequence is grouped and regulated together in a regulatory region, containing a promoter and an operator.
