40|$|With the {{implementation}} of efficient algorithms for the accurate calculation of reaction source terms, computational fluid dynamics (CFD) is now {{a powerful tool for}} the simulation and design of chemical reactors with complex kinetic schemes. The example studied in this work is the methane chlorination reaction for which the detailed chemistry scheme has 152 reactions and 38 species. The adiabatic, jet-stirred chlorination reactor used for the CFD simulations is an insulated right cylinder with a coaxial <b>premixed</b> <b>feed</b> stream at one end. In order for this reactor to remain lit, recirculation of hot products is crucial, and hence, reactor stability is sensitive to both macroscale and microscale mixing. By neglecting density variations, a Lagrangian composition probability density function (PDF) code with a novel chemistry tabulation algorithm (in-situ adaptive tabulation or ISAT) for handling complex reactions is used to simulate the species concentrations and temperature field inside of the reactor. In addition, a reduced mechanism with 21 reactions and 15 species is tested for accuracy against the detailed chemistry scheme, a simplified CSTR model is used to illustrate the shortcomings of zero-dimensional models, and a pair-wise mixing stirred reactor (PMSR) model is used to show the stabilizing effect of micromixing on reactor stability.

40|$|Ration {{formulation}} by linear program-ming techniques {{assumes a}} perfect knowl-edge of all coefficients involved. Because {{of variation in}} composition of feedstuffs, this assumption cannot hold in practical situations. However, the problem can be reformulated as a chance-constrained pro-gramming model for which a determinis-tic equivalent can be derived. In the case where only one nutrient is considered random, the methodology is labeled as single-chance constrained programming. The exact deterministic equivalent re-quires nonlinear programming methods for which algorithms are not available to the feed industry. Three linear approxi-mation algorithms were derived and com-pared with the exact solution given by nonlinear programming in the formula-tion of a <b>premix</b> <b>feed.</b> Prices from 1970 to 1979 for 17 feed ingredients were used. An algorithm based on a linear function of the standard deviation of the random nutrient within each feedstuff, for which a penalty parameter is iterated {{in a search for}} a desired probability, yielded results very similar to the exact solutions found by nonlinear program-ming methods.

40|$|Sodium {{selenite}} is more hygroscopic than sodium selenate. It is, therefore, {{more likely}} to dissolve when dispersed in feeds of relatively high water activity. When dissolved, it may form selenious acid and disperse as a vapor. This is easily demonstrated by mounting a filter paper wetted with a reagent such as ascorbic acid over the subject feed, but not in contact with it. The paper turns brown as elemental selenium is formed from reduction of the vapor. Analysis of the paper ensures that the brown is indeed selenium. Though premixes are generally low enough in moisture content to ensure stability of the selenites, {{this is not true}} of many feeds.

40|$|A {{reliable}} and sensitive analytical method {{was developed for}} simultaneous determination of deoxynivalenol(DON), 3 -acetyldeoxynivalenol (3 -ADON), 15 -acetyldeoxynivalenol (15 -ADON), fusarenon X (FUS-X), and masked deoxynivalenol (deoxynivalenol- 3 -glucoside, D 3 G) in formula feed, concentrated feed, and <b>premixed</b> <b>feed</b> products. The method {{was based on an}} improved sample pretreatment with the commercially available HLB cartridges used for sample purification and enrichment followed by analysis using ultra-high performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (UHPLC-MS/MS). Several key parameters including the extraction solvents, the positions of sample loading solvents, washing and elution solvents for HLB cartridges were carefully optimized to achieve optimal extraction and purification efficiencies. The established method was extensively validated by determining the linearity (R 2 ≥ 0. 99), sensitivity (limit of quantification in the range of 0. 08 – 4. 85 μg/kg), recovery (79. 3 %– 108. 1 %), precision (Intra-day RSDs ≤ 13. 5 % and Inter-day RSDs ≤ 14. 9 %), and then was successfully applied to determine the four type B trichothecenes and D 3 G in a total of 31 feed samples. Among them, 26 were contaminated with various mycotoxins at the levels of 2. 1 – 864. 5 μg/kg, and D 3 G has also been detected in 17 samples with the concentrations in the range of 2. 1 – 34. 8 μg/kg, proving the established method to be a valuable tool for type B trichothecenes and masked DON monitoring in complex feed matrices...|$|E
40|$|The {{continuous}} precipitation of BaSO(4) with a <b>premixed</b> <b>feed</b> in a {{stirred tank}} is simulated. The population balance equation (PBE) is closed with the multi-class method. The effects of aggregation, feeding concentration, agitation speed, mean residence time, the crystal size distribution (CSD) at different locations {{and the net}} birth rate of each size bin due to aggregation are numerically studied. Size bin number tests show that at least 36 bins are needed for the size range in this work to achieve acceptable accuracy in both cases with and without aggregation. The predicted CSD is in good agreement with the reported experimental measurement. Narrower CSD and higher peak value are obtained with higher feed concentration. Aggregation broadens the CSD, decreases the peak value, and makes the CSD shift toward a larger size. The mean size L(32) of crystals decreases significantly with increasing the inlet concentration, {{which is consistent with}} the experiments and model predictions reported in the literature. The effects of residence time and agitation speed on CSD and L(32) are limited, which is very different from those in unpremixed cases. The CSD at the inlet region differs greatly from the outlet and near impeller regions, both in shape and value. A bimodal distribution appears around the inlet under some conditions. The net birth rate of the ith size bin due to aggregation increases dramatically with the inlet concentration. The detailed information, such as the bimodal distribution in a certain location under certain conditions and the aggregation rate of each size bin, could be useful for the precise and sophisticated control of precipitation in some novel processes like nano-particles production.

40|$|Invariant rectifying-stripping (IRS) curves are {{presented}} for energy analysis of distillation processes. The IRS curves are invariant to the column configuration (that is, feed location and {{total number of}} stages) and depend only on the separation problem and the operating pressure of the column. IRS curves are useful to set targets without performing multiple simulation studies. A novel method is proposed to extend the IRS curves, originally developed for simple distillation columns (with single feed and two end products), to complex multiple feed columns. In the proposed method, a column with n feeds is decomposed into n simple single feed columns. The IRS curves are generated for these simple columns and the order and location of the feeds are targeted. Then these IRS curves are added in distinct sections demarcated by the feed points to the column to obtain the composite IRS curves for the complex column. Various targets such as minimum energy requirements (that is, minimum condenser and reboiler loads), appropriate feed locations; proper order of feeds, and effect of <b>premixing</b> <b>feeds</b> can be targeted from the composite IRS curves. Thus, the composite IRS curves for complex columns retain all {{the advantages of the}} IRS curves established for the case of simple distillation columns.

40|$|Wood {{waste is}} the most popular biomass {{recourse}} for many nations. Burned wood can, direct or indirect, release one of the greenhouse gases, carbon dioxide. The process can still be seen as a renewable source of energy since replanting of the trees and crops are consuming nearly the same amount of carbon dioxide through photosynthesis. Thermal gasification is one of the efficient methods to utilize energy from wood waste. Products from the component of concern can be used for direct energy production like in boilers and gas turbines or indirectly via dimethyl ether (DME), for instance. The physics of gasification is complex and several issues can influence the process. There is a lack of knowledge of several phenomena, some of which are related to solid-gas flow in the gasifier and in the <b>premixed</b> <b>feeding</b> pipelines. One such area is mechanisms related to turbulence modulation in the presence of spherical and non-spherical particles and how much the flow can disturb the motion of the particles. This is studied in the present thesis and the motion of the particles in different flow field is disclosed. At the moment there is no agreement in the scientific community on a single dimensionless number that can safely describe the influence of spherical particles in turbulent flow. For non-spherical particles additional levels of freedom are introduced and the dependence on drag and lift from the orientation of the particles as a function of Reynolds number adds to the complexity. Based on a literature review a fundamental experimental study is carried out in simple flow field geometry, a 2 D duct flow. The aim is to reveal the influence of spherical glass particle on the turbulent flow field in the core and near wall flows. Additional studies with wood particles gave more information about how real biomass particles affect the turbulence as compared to spherical ones. Next the instantaneous distribution of biomass particles was studied experimentally. It is known that this distribution significantly influences the soot formation in a gasifier. Two different techniques of flow control were studied, swirling flow and synthetic jet flow. Particles shape and inertia and the strength of vortices and vortices interaction in coaxial jets and swirling jet flow were studied and yielded a high influence on the preferential concentration of particles {{as well as on the}} root mean square values for velocity in coaxial jets flow. The synthetic jet add momentum to the flow without disturbing the mass loading ratio and result in higher dispersion of the particles away from the centreline of the jet.

Higher digestibility of calcium (Ca) (71. 11 % vs. 69. 09 %) and phosphorus (P) (52. 74 % vs. 47. 55 %) was determined in horses fed the phytogenic additives (P> 0. 05). In this group of horses we found significantly (P< 0. 05) higher digestibility of magnesium (Mg), 64. 32 % in comparison with the control group (43. 55 %). Insignificantly differences in sodium (Na) digestibility we found (75. 98 % in control group vs. 76. 58 % in experimental group). Significantly (P< 0. 05) higher potassium (K) digestibility we found in horses fed with phytoadditives (57. 11 %). In horses fed without phytoadditives we detected significantly (P< 0. 05) lower digestibility of K (30. 55 %). In conclusion, we found positive effects of a phytogenic additive on macroelements faecal digestibility in sport horses...|$|R
40|$|Veterinary {{drugs are}} therapeutically used for laying hens {{but may also}} reach them unintentionally via the feed e. g. {{as a result of}} {{cross-contamination}} during <b>premix</b> manufacture, <b>feed</b> preparation in the feed mill or during feed transport. When these compounds reach the bloodstream, they will occur in the ovary with growing follicles and the oviduct, where the egg white is formed and secreted. The deposition of drugs in either yolk or white or both phases determines where one should look for residues. Three reasons might rule the distribution of drugs between egg yolk and egg white: lipid solubility as fat soluble compounds generally occur in yolk, pK a value as ionised molecules will distribute in a certain way between phases with different pH values such as yolk and white or protein binding to egg white proteins. An extensive survey of available literature data on residues in egg yolk and white after administration to laying hens was made. The data on the distribution of residues between yolk and white differ considerably between drugs, but show remarkable resemblance for data on a given drug. All data on sulfonamides as well as on tetracyclines were considered carefully for any relationship between physicochemical characteristics and residue data in yolk and white. The lipid solubility hypothesis was certainly not supported by the available data including own previous experiments. All three explanations have also been tested in two animal experiments in which several sulfonamides differing in lipid solubility, pK a value and protein binding were administered to laying hens via the feed during 14 days and the levels in both yolk and egg white measured. None of the three reasons could satisfactorily explain the ratio of the sulfonamide residues in egg white and yolk found in these experiments. The conclusion therefore is that - at least for the sulfonamides tested - egg yolk and egg white are not two phases separated by a semi-permeable membrane and in some way in equilibrium with each other. Rather, two independent physiological processes in the laying hen govern the deposition of residues of the sulfonamides in egg yolk and egg white...|$|R

Thirty laboratories from 26 countries registered to the exercise of which 25 reported results for total As, 30 for total Cd, 29 for total Pb, 13 for total Hg and 9 for total Sn. Laboratories were asked to perform two or three independent measurements and to report the mean, the associated uncertainty, the coverage factor of the associated uncertainty and the technique used to perform the measurements. Laboratory results were rated using z- and ζ-scores (zeta-scores) in accordance with ISO 13528. The assigned values (Xref) for the measurands were determined as the mean of the values reported by two expert laboratories. The standard deviation for proficiency assessment (σˆ), also called target standard deviation, was set to 15 % of the assigned value, for the analytes investigated. Between 60 and 90 % of the laboratories reported satisfactory results for total As and total Cd, and 50 % for total Pb. Only 3 participants reported satisfactory results for total Sn (out of 9 laboratories that reported values). Thirteen participants reported results for total Hg although, according to the expert laboratories the mass fraction for that measurand was below their limit of detection. JRC.

40|$|Salmonella in {{pigs and}} derived pork is a {{significant}} food safety concern in Ireland. During commercial pig production, it is proposed {{that a number of}} risk factors including commercial feed can introduce Salmonella to fattening pig herds and may thereby cause human infections via consumption of contaminated pork. The objective of this work was to carry out an in-depth study on ten high Salmonella sero-prevalence pig farms to firstly identify which production stages were the principal harbours of Salmonella infection and secondly, to assess the occurrence of Salmonella in feed throughout the different production stages on these farms and thereby assess potential risks as well as epidemiological relationships. Isolates were characterized by serotyping, antibiotic resistance profiling, pulsed field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) and multiple locus VNTR analysis (MLVA). Eleven serotypes were recovered, with a monophasic variant of Typhimurium (4,[5], 12 :i:) accounting for 41. 1 % of all isolates recovered. Five Salmonella 4,[5], 12 :i:- isolates were recovered from the commercial feed mills supplying our pig farms. Typing of all isolates resulted in two common distinct MLVA profiles for both mills and farms. The Salmonella 4,[5], 12 :i:- variant that predominated in the pigs and feed is an emerging strain in Europe and are of increasing food safety concern. The objective of the final {{study was to determine the}} survival characteristics of Salmonella 4,[5], 12 :i:- strains. The thermal inactivation of the five feed strains at 55, 60 and 65 °C was investigated using an immersed heating coil apparatus. The ability of the five strains to survive during storage on weaner pig <b>feed</b> <b>premixed</b> with Sodium Butyrate was also assessed over 28 day storage. The key findings in this study is the confirmation of monophasic Salmonella Typhimurium occurrence in new geographical settings and the indication of its possible role in the transmission of Salmonella from contaminated feed ingredients and feed to pigs...|$|R
