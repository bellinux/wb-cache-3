Evidence is drawn from case studies examining the effects of these different mechanisms on organisations in the public and private sectors, and from econometric analysis of the impact of stock market pressures on firms ’ human resource practices. We argue that there is scope for reflexive solutions to improve the effectiveness in practice of UK equality law, by inducing efficient disclosure by employers, setting default rules, and encouraging bargaining {{in the shadow of the}} law...|$|E
40|$|Equal <b>Pay</b> <b>Audits</b> are {{the latest}} tool in the {{campaign}} for gender equality at work. I use two <b>pay</b> <b>audits,</b> in a bank and an insurance company, to demonstrate {{how they can be}} used and abused, and in the process I explore the reasons for the massive gender pay gap of forty three per cent in the finance sector of the United Kingdom. The conduct of a pay audit allows an employer to claim conformity with government approved procedures, but I ask how reliable those procedures are, and how the process can be improved. The introduction of 'nev/ payment systems such as performance related pay has allowed employers to claim that pay and promotion are fair because they are determined by 'objective' criteria. The validity of such claims is tested, and other elements of the pay process that contribute to unequal pay sought out. The potential for 'new' payment systems to be transparent is found to be offset by provision for management discretion, but the major contributor to the gap is found to be the development of a two tier workforce following recent restructuring of the industry. This effectively reproduces the gendered divisions that existed prior to the implementation of Equal Opportunities legislation. The women who occupy most of the lower tier are mainly employed in call centres and customer service departments, where they have better pay and conditions than they could expect for alternative jobs in the same locality, sufficient flexibility to accommodate domestic commitments, but a flat career structure with little opportunity for promotion. The few men who join this tier do so as a stepping stone to the traditional departments where promotion provides access to some of the highest salaries in the UK...|$|E

40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to examine the {{stability}} or loyalty in the auditor-client relationship. It explores the association between audit fees and auditor loyalty. Specifically, it investigates whether clients <b>paying</b> less <b>audit</b> fees relative to other companies in their industries are more likely to be loyal to their auditors. Design/methodology/approach – Logistic and ordinal regression analyses are used to compare loyal clients to clients that switched audit firms after controlling for factors that are expected to be associated with client loyalty. Findings – Results show that relative audit fees have a significant effect on the degree of loyalty of clients to their audit firms. Additional analysis shows that the loyalty of clients that <b>pay</b> higher <b>audit</b> fees relative to similar clients in their industry are highly affected by increases in audit fees. However, the loyalty of clients who <b>pay</b> lower <b>audit</b> fees compared to similar clients in their industry is not affected by further increases in relative audit fees. Research limitations/implications – The study does not differentiate between auditor dismissal and auditor resignation in the classification of clients that switched auditors. It also does not classify auditor switches into auditor-initiated switches and client-initiated switches. Practical implications – It is cost effective for clients to stay with the same audit firm. Audit firms should be careful when adjusting their audit fees from one period to another, as there is a higher probability of losing a client, when increasing the audit fees, especially if this client is already <b>paying</b> higher <b>audit</b> fees relative to similar clients. Originality/value – The findings of this study increase the understanding of how relative audit fees affect client loyalty in the audit market.

Drawing {{on the existence of}} a clearly identifiable ethnic domination of board membership and ownership of Malaysian listed firms, the study also posits that Bumiputera-controlled firms <b>pay</b> higher <b>audit</b> fees because of their weaker governance practices. Design/methodology/approach – This study employs a cross-sectional analysis of 736 firms listed on the Bursa Malaysia for the financial year ending in 2003. Multiple regression analysis is used to estimate the relationships proposed in the hypotheses. Findings – Overall, {{the results of this study}} reveal that external audit fees are positively and significantly related to board independence, audit committee expertise, and the frequency of audit committee meetings. The study also finds a strong negative association between external audit fees and Bumiputera-owned firms. An additional analysis into the internal governance structures of firms in the sample show that Bumiputera firms practice more favourable corporate governance practices compared to their Non-Bumiputera counterparts. Originality/value – This study is a unique contribution in that it provides data on corporate governance practices in Malaysia for a large sample in the period after the corporate governance reforms taken by Malaysian capital market regulators and participants. Previous studies have shown that Bumiputera-controlled firms <b>pay</b> higher <b>audit</b> fees than Non-Bumiputera-controlled firms.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{attitudes to}} pay equity of smaller employers {{to identify what}} would encourage or discourage them in ensuring pay equity within their firm. To achieve this, semi-structured interviews with owner-managers of eight smaller firms (employing 100 or less employees) were held to explore their understanding of and attitudes to pay equity, their perceptions of its relevance to their firm’s ability to compete and succeed, and the structure and design of Human Resource Management (HRM) practices that enable (or not) equal pay for {{work of equal value}} within their firm. All but one of these firms was based in Western Australia. The overarching question driving this project is, "What do smaller firm owner-managers think about pay equity and what would encourage or discourage smaller firm owner-managers from embedding equal pay practice within their firm?" Key findings: 1. There is a lack of knowledge about gender pay equity within SMEs; 2. That in SME’s there is both ‘traditional’ attitudes of managers in relation to women’s and men’s work and more inclusive attitudes as a result of changes in the economy; 3. That gender-segregated labour pools from which employees are recruited contributes to pay inequity; 4. That awards hold back pay inequity between award covered, lower paid employees; 5. The lack of negotiation skills amongst women (especially those who were not considered to be covered by an award) contributes to pay inequity; 6. That individualised ‘rewards’ are given to high performing or ‘meritorious’ employees. 7. That the owner-manager’s values, attitudes and previous work experience is important in terms of their treatment of women. 8.

Moreover, in the context of auditor’s industry specialization, unlike the American and Australian counterparts, none of the four large audit firms in Malaysia are specialists in a particular industry.

We also show that a rational risk-neutral consumerÂ’s response to a market environment, wherein a firm engages in confidential settlement agreements, may be to reduce demand. We discuss how firm profitability is influenced by the decision to have open or confidential settlements; all else equal, a firm following a policy of openness will pay higher equilibrium wages and incur higher training costs, though product demand will not be diminished (as it may be for a firm employing confidentiality). Further, we characterize the choice of regime, providing conditions such that, if the cost of credible auditing (to verify openness) is low enough, a firm will choose to <b>pay</b> for <b>auditing</b> and eschew confidentialityproduct saftey, confidential settlement...|$|R

40|$|This {{study has}} four (4) broad {{objective}}s. The first {{objective is to}} investigate whether politically connected (PCON) firms <b>pay</b> higher <b>audit</b> fees than non-PCON firms. The second objective {{is to examine the}} moderating effect of political connections (PCON versus non-PCON) on the association between the internal governance mechanisms, specifically, audit committee (AC) and internal audit functions (IAF), and audit fees. The third objective is to investigate whether high regulated firms (HRFs) <b>pay</b> higher <b>audit</b> fees than less regulated firms (LRFs). The fourth objective is to examine the moderating effect of regulatory oversight (HRF versus LRF) on the association between the above mentioned internal governance mechanisms and audit fees. This study is conducted in the Malaysian corporate setting that is unique due to the high involvement of the government in business (resulting in significantly high political connectedness with businesses) and the stringent regulatory oversight by the Central Bank of Malaysia (Bank Negara Malaysia) on financial institutions. In addition, the Bursa Malaysia revised its Listing Requirements to enhance the internal governance mechanisms in 2008, thus providing an opportunity to examine the audit fees issue from the demand side perspective both for the PCON firms and the HRFs. This research draws from three theories, namely, the agency theory, political embeddedness perspective and institutional theory, to form the framework and develop the hypotheses to be examined. Six (6) hypotheses are developed and tested, using data from 209 sample firms from years 2005 to 2009, that are before and after the revision of the Bursa Malaysia Listing Requirements in 2008 (BMLR 2008). The data were collected from the firms‟ annual reports and DataStream. In addition, interviews were conducted with selected external auditors, heads of the internal auditors and regulators that ascertain the existence of the demand side explanation for the audit fees. This study is important as it provides additional knowledge {{about the impact of the}} revised BMLR 2008 on AC characteristics and IAF attributes for PCON firms since most prior research was conducted before 2008. Specifically, it is evidenced that PCON firms have higher audit fees due to improved internal governance mechanisms which demand for increase in audit effort. Further, this study also provides support that HRFs firms have higher audit fees than LRFs due to the existence of an industry-specific regulator, over and above the capital market regulator, which requires more audit effort thus, increase in audit fees. As such, this study provides evidence and implications for regulators and others concerned with establishing guidelines and listing rules pertaining to internal governance mechanisms in an institutional context such as Malaysia...|$|R
