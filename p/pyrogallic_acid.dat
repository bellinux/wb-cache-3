40|$|The {{results of}} {{investigation}} of the tannin content in the oak acorn kernel Quercus cerris, qualitative analysis of tannin and antioxidation effect of ethanol extracts of acorn on porcine lipid (prime steam lard) as a substrate are presented in this paper. Experiments were carried out on kernel samples of the domestic oak acorn, from the location Zaglavak, near by the town of Bajina Bašta. Tannin content was determined by spectrophotometric procedure using phosphorus Wolframic acid on wave length of 715 nm. Qualitative analysis of tannin included sediment and stain responses as well as tannoform test with formalaldehyde and HCl. Antioxidant effect of ethanol extracts was investigated on fat samples treated at the temperature of 600 C in the dark (Schaaloven test). The rate of oxidation was determined by measuring Peroxide value (Pb) and TBA value. The investigated extracts were obtained based on drying of acorn kernel and extracts based on thermal treatment - dry frying of acorn kernel. The obtained results show that dried acorn kernel contains 11. 69 % of tannin and thermally treated acorn kernel 8. 55 %. Qualitative analysis confirmed the presence of gallic <b>acid</b> (<b>pyrogallic,</b> hydrolysing) tannins based on positive general sediment and stain responses on tannins. Ethanol extracts demonstrate antioxidation traits on porcine lipids in trial conditions. Synergistic effect of citric acid with primary anti oxidant was not proved. Thermal treatment of acorn kernel does not reduce the antioxidation activity of extracts...|$|R
5000|$|Fox Talbot {{claimed that}} his patent covered [...] "the making visible {{photographic}} images upon paper ... by washing them with liquid" [...] {{and argued that}} Laroche's use of <b>pyrogallic</b> <b>acid</b> rather than his own mixture of silver nitrate, acetic acid, and gallic acid was immaterial.|$|E
5000|$|Toning is {{the process}} used to change {{the color of the}} iron in the print cyanotype. The color change varies with the reagent used. There are a variety of {{elements}} that can be used, including tannic acid, oolong tea, wine, cat urine, and <b>pyrogallic</b> <b>acid.</b>|$|E
5000|$|His career {{spanning}} six decades, Bell {{worked in}} nearly every major early photographic process, including daguerreotype, collodion processes, albumen prints, stereo cards, and early film. [...] He was considered a pioneer of the dry plate and lantern slide processes, and experimented with night photography, using magnesium wire for lighting. [...] He wrote technical articles {{on topics such as}} gelatine emulsions, the use of <b>pyrogallic</b> <b>acid</b> to recover gold from waste solutions, and the development of isochromatic plates.|$|E
5000|$|In 1865 in {{the fifth}} volume of [...] "A {{dictionary}} of chemistry", Henry Watts wrote : It exhibits with ferric salts the same reactions as gallotannic acid. It differs however from the latter in not being convertible into gallic acid, and not yielding <b>pyrogallic</b> <b>acid</b> by dry distillation. It is precipitated by sulfuric acid in red flocks. (Stenhouse, Ann. Ch. Pharm. xlv. 16.)According to Rochleder (ibid lxiii. 202), the tannic acid of black tea {{is the same as}} that of oak-bark.|$|E
5000|$|In {{the domain}} of plant chemistry, Braconnot contributed to the {{isolation}} and the description of several compounds, {{most of which were}} shown later to be mixtures of simpler products. Among others, Braconnot discovered gallic and ellagic acids (1818) and <b>pyrogallic</b> <b>acid</b> (pyrogallol) which later enabled the development of photography. He discovered also in 1811 chitin in mushrooms, the earliest known polysaccharide. In 1819, he published a memoir describing {{for the first time the}} conversion of wood, straw or cotton into a sugar by a sulfuric acid treatment. The name glucose was proposed 24 years later by Dumas for a sugar similarly obtained from starch, cellulose, or honey.By the same acid process, Braconnot obtained a [...] "gelatin sugar" [...] (named later glycocolle, now glycine) from gelatin and leucine from muscle fibers. Furthermore, reacting concentrated nitric acid on wood or cotton, Braconnot obtained an inflammable product, xyloïdine (a precursor of collodion and nitrocellulose), which could be transformed into a vitreous varnish. This substance may be considered as the first polymer or plastic material created by a chemist.|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe Cu-S {{separation}} {{tests have}} been conducted at pH= 7 ∼ 8 with five combined depressants, namely, Starch + <b>pyrogallic</b> <b>acid,</b> sodium hypochlorite + <b>pyrogallic</b> <b>acid,</b> <b>pyrogallic</b> <b>acid</b> + Tannic, sodium hypochlorite + Tannic and calcium hypochlorite + DT- 2 #. The tests show that calcium hypochlorite + DT- 2 # is the best depressor for pyrite, {{which leads to the}} Cu-S separation at a low alkalinity of pH= 7 ∼ 8 without lime. From the chemical analysis of the mineral surface, the inhibition mechanism of pyrite at a pH of 7 ∼ 8 is as following: calcium hypochlorite + DT- 2 # oxidizes the pyrite surface to produce a hydrophilous film of Fe(OH) 3 and CaCO 3, which enhances the hydrophilicity of the pyrite surface, then pyrite is inhibited in the pulp, and the Cu-S separation can be achieved in lime-free condition...|$|E
40|$|A {{simple method}} of {{producing}} anaerobic conditions {{is to set}} a small tube filled with <b>pyrogallic</b> <b>acid</b> solution so that its open capillary tip discharges into a small beaker containing the proper amount of KOH solution and evacuate it in a closed system-as shown in picture and sketch. FIG. 1 As the <b>pyrogallic</b> <b>acid</b> is not mixed with the KOH solution-until the jar is exhausted, waste is avoided and only a small amount, which may readily be calculated is needed.

40|$|Phenolic {{compounds}} {{are some}} of the most widespread molecules among plant secondary metabolites, which are of great significance in plant metabolism. With an objective to study the impact of some of these compounds on the seed germination and seedling growth, the seeds of cucumber (Cucumis sativus L.) were treated with distilled water (control), 5 × 10 – 5 M, 10 - 4 M, 5 × 10 – 4 M or 10 – 3 M, each of catechol, gallic acid or <b>pyrogallic</b> <b>acid.</b> Treatment of the seeds with the phenolic compounds significantly decreased the germination percentage, growth of radicle and hypocotyls and the fresh and dry weight of the seedlings. Out of the different concentrations of these compounds used, 10 – 3 M caused the maximum inhibition. Among the phenolics used, <b>pyrogallic</b> <b>acid</b> was the inhibitoriest. However, total phenolic content in the seedlings increased in response to different treatments, in a concentration dependent manner...|$|E

40|$|AbstractDothideaceous black yeast-like fungi (BYF) {{are known}} to {{synthesise}} DHN-melanin that is inhibited by the systemic fungicide tricyclazole. The final step of the DHN melanin pathway is the conjoining of 1, 8 -DHN molecules to form the melanin polymer. There are several candidate enzymes for this step, including phenoloxidases such as tyrosinase and laccases, peroxidases, and perhaps also catalases. We analysed the type polyphenoloxidases {{that are involved in}} biosynthesis of BYF melanins. For that purpose we used substrates of o-diphenoloxidases (EC 1. 10. 3. 1.) : 4 -hydroxyphenyl-pyruvic acid, L-β-phenyllactic acid, tyrosine, pyrocatechol, 3, 4 -dihydroxyphenylalanine and homogentisic acid, as well as substrates of p-diphenoloxidases (EC 1. 10. 3. 2.) : syringaldazine, resorcinol, p-phenylenediamine, phloroglucinol, guaiacol and <b>pyrogallic</b> <b>acid.</b> Fourteen strains of black yeasts originating from different natural biotopes were investigated. The tested strains could be divided into four groups based on their ability to produce dark pigments when cultivated on aromatic substrates of o- and on p-diphenoloxidases. It was established that syringaldazine, <b>pyrogallic</b> <b>acid</b> and 4 -hydrophenyl-pyruvic acid, β-phenyllactic acid optimally promote melanin biosynthesis. Average intensity of pigmentation of all strains studied was minimal when guaiacol was used as a substrate. The present investigation indicates that the melanisation process may involve more enzymes and more substrates than those commonly recognised. Black yeasts are likely to contain a multipotent polyphenoloxidase...|$|E

40|$|The {{potential}} of holograms {{has been left}} virtually untapped {{in the field of}} education. A hologram can be described as a three-dimensional photographic record of the interference pattern of two superimposed beams of coherent light. Holography requires: (1) high-resolution film; (2) a laser, often a red-beamed helium neon laser; (3) optical components, including positive and negative lenses, mirrors which redirect light, beamsplitters which create the two superimposed beams, and the film plate holder; and (4) the isolation table, which stabilizes the other components and saves them from vibration. Setups vary according to whether the recording proc,ss involves a one-beam transmission or a two-beam transmission. Film processing is very similar to photography but requires <b>pyrogallic</b> <b>acid,</b> sodium carbonate, potassium dichromate, and concentrated sulfuric acid.

30|$|All fish {{samples were}} {{analyzed}} {{according to a}} slightly modified AOAC Official Method 996.06. In brief, the lipid of the samples was hydrolyzed by concentrated nitric acid. <b>Pyrogallic</b> <b>acid</b> was added to prevent oxidative degradation of fatty acids during acid hydrolysis while triundecanoin was added as internal standard. After hydrolysis, fatty acids extracted into diethyl ether were concentrated and then methylated to fatty acid methyl esters (FAMEs) with boron trifluroide as derivatizing agent. FAMEs yielded were quantitatively measured by using a gas chromatograph equipped with flame ionization detection system (6890 : Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA).

30|$|Polyphenol oxidase from Castanea henryi nuts was {{partially}} purified. Some {{characteristics of the}} enzyme were then determined to help devise measures {{for the prevention of}} undesirable enzymatic browning during storage and processing of the nuts. Preparation of acetone powder extracts of the nuts, ammonium sulfate precipitation, dialysis, and gel filtration resulted in 37 -fold purification of the enzyme with a yield of 13 %. Sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and the excitation spectrum confirmed the enzyme preparation to be homogeneous. The approximate molecular weight of the enzyme was determined by gel filtration to be 69 [*]kD. The enzyme catalyzed the oxidation of catechol and <b>pyrogallic</b> <b>acid</b> as substrates but did not affect cresol or tyrosine. Using catechol as substrate, p-nitrophenol, thiourea, orcinol, and naphthol showed strong inhibition. The optimal pH and temperature for the enzyme were pH 5.0 and 40 °C, respectively. The enzyme proved heat labile. When the enzyme was incubated at 70 °C for 30 [*]min, the remaining activity of the enzyme was only 8 %. Possible approaches to applying {{the results of this study}} to the prevention of enzymatic browning in the production of C. henryi nuts is also discussed.|$|E

40|$|Free radicals, {{particularly}} reactive {{oxygen species}} (ROS), {{are involved in the}} pathogenesis of several chronical and degenerative diseases. This study was designed to investigate the antioxidative properties of natural extracts and isolated compounds of Casimiroa edulis and Casimiroa pubescens Llave et Lex (Rutaceae). The genus Casimiroa is widely spread in the tropical and subtropical areas of central America: the decoction of leaves and seeds, together with the consumption of the edible fruits are quite diffused as folk remedies to relieve hypertensive ailments, insomnia, rheumatisms and arthritic pains. To the best of our knowledge, there are no available scientific data directly related to the benefit of scavenging activity toward radical-mediated disease prevention, such as for coronary heart disease, cancer, Alzheimer, arthritis and diabetes as well as degenerative processes associated with aging (Haliwell et al. 1992), in consequence of membrane damage, protein modification, enzyme inactivation and DNA damage induced by free radicals. The antioxidant effect was evaluated by ,-diphenyl--picrylhydrazyl (DPPH.) decolorization, according to the method reported by Brand-Williams et al. (1995); the assay was performed first with TLC plate as positive antioxidant control and then with a spectrophotometric analysis to measure the effective in vitro scavenging activity. We used N-acetyl-L-cysteine, <b>pyrogallic</b> <b>acid,</b> -tocopherol, L-ascorbic acid and quercetin as antioxidative standards.
