50|$|Doppler VOR beacons are {{inherently}} {{more accurate than}} Conventional VORs because they are less affected by reflections from hills and buildings. The variable signal in a DVOR is the 30 Hz FM signal; in a CVOR it is the 30 Hz AM signal. If the AM signal from a CVOR beacon bounces off a building or hill, the aircraft will see a phase {{that appears to be}} at the phase centre of the main signal and the reflected signal, and this phase centre will move as the beam rotates. In a DVOR beacon, the variable signal, if reflected, will seem to be two FM signals of unequal strengths and different phases. Twice per 30 Hz cycle, the instantaneous deviation of the two signals will be the same, and the phase locked loop will get (briefly) confused. As the two instantaneous deviations drift apart again, the phase locked loop will follow the signal with the greatest strength, which will be the line-of-sight signal. If the phase separation of the two deviations is small, however, the phase locked loop will become less likely to lock on to the true signal for a larger percentage of the 30 Hz cycle (this will depend on the bandwidth of the output of the <b>phase</b> <b>comparator</b> in the aircraft). In general, some reflections can cause minor problems, but these are usually about an order of magnitude less than in a CVOR beacon.|$|E

5000|$|The {{comparator}} {{hypothesis is}} a psychological model of associative learning and performance. To understand the model, {{it helps to}} consider how associative learning is usually studied. For example, to study the learning of an association between cues, such as lights and sounds, and an outcome such as food, an experimenter typically pairs the cues and the food {{a number of times}} (the learning phase) and then tests with {{one or more of the}} cues to see if a response has been learned (the test phase). Most theories of associative learning have assumed that phenomena of interest (see Classical conditioning for a list of phenomena) depend on what happens during the learning <b>phase.</b> The <b>comparator</b> hypothesis assumes, on the contrary, that what happens during the learning phase is fairly simple, and that most interesting phenomena depend on what happens during the test <b>phase.</b> The <b>comparator</b> hypothesis arose primarily in response to so-called “cue competition” effects. If for example in classical conditioning, two conditioned stimuli A and B are presented with an unconditioned stimulus, one may find on test that the subject responds to A or to B or to both or not very much to either. How can one account for such varied results? [...] First proposed by Ralph Miller' [...] the comparator hypothesis is a model of Pavlovian associations which posits that cue competition effects arise at the time of test, that is during performance, not during learning. The model assumes, essentially, that during conditioning the subject acquires both CS-US and context-US associations. At the time of the test, the associations are compared, and a response to a CS occurs only if the CS-US association is stronger than the context-US association. The model was initially proposed to account for unexplained variations in cue competition effects such as recovery from blocking, but has been expanded to apply more broadly to learning phenomena. [...] The success of the hypothesis has led to modifications in existing theories, such as Wagner's SOP and the Rescorla-Wagner model, enabling them to explain such phenomena as retrospective reevaluation, but other phenomena such as counteraction still pose difficulties for most models.|$|R

40|$|To {{reduce the}} number of <b>phase</b> {{sampling}} <b>comparators</b> in a direction finding (DF) interferometer antenna, a new array based on a robust symmetrical number system (RSNS) is described. The RSNS is used to decompose the spatial filtering operation into a number of parallel sub-operations that are of smaller computational complexity. Each sub-operation (interferometer) symmetrically folds the phase with folding period equal to 2 Nm(i) where N is the number of channels that are used and n(i) the channel modulus. A small comparator ladder mid-level quantizes each folded phase response. Each sub-operation only requires a precision in accordance with that modulus. A much higher DF resolution is achieved after the N different RSNS moduli are used and the results of these low precision sub-operations are recombined. The parallel use of phase waveforms increases the antenna resolution without increasing the folding rate of the system. The new antenna is constructed and tested in an anechoic chamber, and the results are compared with the experimental results of a previously tested optimum symmetrical number system (OSNS) array.

This applied research project has designed, simulated, constructed and tested {{the performance of}} a processing system for a prototype direction finding antenna.
