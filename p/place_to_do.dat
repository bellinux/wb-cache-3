5|$|Switzerland has an {{overwhelmingly}} private sector economy and low tax rates by Western World standards; overall taxation {{is one of}} the smallest of developed countries. Switzerland is a relatively easy <b>place</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> business, currently ranking 20th of 189 countries in the Ease of Doing Business Index. The slow growth Switzerland experienced in the 1990s and the early 2000s has brought greater support for economic reforms and harmonisation with the European Union. According to Credit Suisse, only about 37% of residents own their own homes, one of the lowest rates of home ownership in Europe. Housing and food price levels were 171% and 145% of the EU-25 index in 2007, compared to 113% and 104% in Germany.|$|E

Another was his naturalness; the man that viewers saw on television every week was the same person who could be encountered behind a supermarket shopping cart, at a bowling alley, or in a kitchen making breakfast. From his first Chesterfield Supper Club television show, if scripts were written at all, they were based on Como's everyday manner of speaking. Though Como was widely known for his amiability, laid-back and easygoing style, he was not devoid of a temper, and it could be seen at times {{as a result of the}} frustrations of daily life. Mitchell Ayres, his musical director from 1948 to 1963 said, [...] "Perry has a temper like everyone else. And he loses his temper at the normal things everyone else does.

500|$|When Mallory's men {{searched the}} South for {{factories}} that could build engines {{to drive the}} heavy ships that he wanted, they found no <b>place</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> it immediately. At the best facility, the Tredegar Iron Works in Richmond, building engines from scratch would take at least a year. Upon learning this, Williamson suggested taking the engines from the hulk of Merrimack, recently raised from {{the bed of the}} Elizabeth River. His colleagues promptly accepted his suggestion and expanded it, proposing that the design of their projected ironclad be adapted to the hull. Porter produced the revised plans, which were submitted to Mallory for approval. On July 11, 1861, the new design was accepted, and work began almost immediately. The burned-out hull was towed into the graving dock that the Union Navy had failed to destroy. During the subsequent conversion process, the plans developed further, incorporating an iron ram fitted to the prow. The re-modeled ship's offense, in addition to the ram, consisted of 10 guns: six [...] smooth-bore Dahlgrens, two [...] and two [...] Brooke rifles. Trials showed that these rifles firing solid shot would pierce up to eight inches of armor plating. [...] The Tredegar Iron works could produce both solid shot and shell, and since it was believed that Virginia would face only wooden ships, she was given only the shell. The armor plating, originally meant to be [...] thick, was replaced by double plates, each [...] thick, backed by [...] of iron and pine. The armor was pierced for 14 gunports: four on each broadside, three forward, and three aft. The revisions, together with the usual problems associated with the transportation system of the South, resulted in delays that pushed out the launch date until February 3, 1862, and she was not commissioned until February 17, bearing the name CSS Virginia.|$|E
