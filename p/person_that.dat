5|$|For {{an object}} in free-fall, this force is unopposed and the net force on the object is its weight. For objects not in free-fall, {{the force of gravity}} is opposed by the {{reaction}} forces applied by their supports. For example, a person standing on the ground experiences zero net force, since a normal force (a reaction force) is exerted by the ground upward on the <b>person</b> <b>that</b> counterbalances his weight that is directed downward.|$|E

5|$|The {{concept for}} the Fuchikoma came from one climactic {{scene of the}} film: the battle between Motoko Kusanagi and the big spider-like tank in the museum of paleontology. Based on this tank design, mecha creators Shōji Kawamori and Atsushi Takeuchi made a smaller version, {{designed}} for one <b>person,</b> <b>that</b> would {{be used by the}} police. Thus, the player becomes the pilot of one of these combat machines.|$|E
40|$|The Code of Criminal Procedure {{provides}} some exceptions, {{from the general}} rule according to which any persons can be heard as witness, as there are certain <b>persons</b> <b>that</b> can not become witnesses in a criminal trial; these persons are as follow: <b>persons</b> <b>that</b> can not be heard as witnesses and <b>persons</b> <b>that</b> are entitled to decline to testify. We consider that the stipulations of the current Code of Criminal Procedure regarding the <b>persons</b> <b>that</b> can {{not be forced to}} testify in some criminal cases is criticisable in terms of requirements of legislative technique regarding the usage of a concise, clear style and a correct terminology. Also, in order to correlate the stipulations of the Code of Criminal Procedure with the ones of the current Criminal Code, we propose, de lege ferenda, a modification of the criminal procedural stipulations regarding the <b>persons</b> <b>that</b> can refuse to testify as witness, by using the expression “family member of the suspect or of the defendant”...|$|R

5|$|Even {{though this}} episode aired {{as the last}} episode of the first season, {{it was the first}} episode in {{production}} and was intended to be the first episode to air from the half-hour show. The series is a spin-off from The Tracey Ullman Show in which the family already appeared in a series of animated one-minute shorts. The characters were already created, but had to be further developed in order to carry a half-hour show. The episode was therefore meant as an introduction to the characters. The Simpsons creator Matt Groening and writer/producer Sam Simon (of such television series as Cheers) wrote the script for the episode. Both Groening and Simon are credited with developing the series along with executive producer James L. Brooks. The name of Ms. Botz was based on a real <b>person</b> <b>that</b> once babysat Groening.|$|E
5|$|Jewish legend {{records that}} Samson's {{shoulders}} were sixty cubits broad. (Many Talmudic commentaries, however, explain {{that this is}} not to be taken literally, for a <b>person</b> <b>that</b> size could not live normally in society. Rather, it means that he had the ability to carry a burden 60 cubits wide (approximately 30 meters) on his shoulders). He was lame in both feet but, when the spirit of God came upon him, he could step with one stride from Zorah to Eshtaol, while the hairs of his head arose and clashed against one another so that they could be heard for a like distance. Samson was said to be so strong that he could uplift two mountains and rub them together like two s of earth, yet his superhuman strength, like Goliath's, brought woe upon its possessor.|$|E

When Hibiki makes a mistake, Misaki lectures her and informs her how {{a member of the}} faculty should act, even when it may not entirely be her fault. Due to Hibiki's low magical experience, Misaki worries about Hibiki succeeding {{as a member of the}} staff. Like Hibiki, Misaki cannot perform magic, though she still has a vast knowledge of magic at her disposal. She had been adopted by a man that constantly abused her and the only thing that could cheer her up was a book from a magic user. She had been saved by Asuma and hopes to be of use to him.|$|E

5|$|The Emperor {{is known}} to hold the nominal {{ceremonial}} authority. For example, the Emperor is the only <b>person</b> <b>that</b> {{has the authority to}} appoint the Prime Minister, even though the Diet has the power to designate the person fitted for the position. One such example can be prominently seen in the 2009 Dissolution of the House of Representatives. The House was expected to be dissolved on the advice of the Prime Minister, but was temporarily unable to do so for the next general election, as both the Emperor and Empress were visiting Canada.|$|E
5|$|The Mahabharata corroborates the Ramayana account. Vishvavasu tells Rama to {{seek the}} help of Sugriva, who would know where Ravana stays. Kabandha also assured Rama that he would {{definitely}} meet Sita again. In the Mahavira-charita, the divine <b>person</b> <b>that</b> leaves the funeral pyre informs Rama that he is Danu and a curse had turned him in a demon, who was manipulated by Malyavan – Ravana's chief adviser – to create havoc in the region. He expresses his gratitude to Rama and cautions him that Malyavan has also set Vali against him.|$|E
5|$|The Warners {{starred in}} the feature-length, direct-to-video movie Wakko's Wish. The movie {{takes place in the}} fictional town of Acme Falls, in which the Warners {{and the rest of the}} Animaniacs cast are under the rule of a greedy king who conquered their home country from a {{neighboring}} country. When the Warners find out about a star that will grant a wish to the first <b>person</b> <b>that</b> touches it, the Warners, the villagers (the Animaniacs cast), and the king race to get to it first. Although children and adults rated Wakko's Wish highly in test-screenings, Warner Bros. decided to release it direct-to-video, rather than spend money on advertising. Warner Bros. released the movie on VHS on December 21, 1999; the film was then released on DVD on October 7, 2014.|$|E

This equipment includes flashlights, signal mirrors, tactical vests, safety vests, and food that will last them at least 24hours. The equipment carried by ground teams varies much by the mission at hand. Urban direction finding (UDF) missions necessitate only a small kit of gear. But intensive mountain search and rescue can require packs that provide for up to 72 hours of operational supplies and tool for the location, rescue and extraction of lost or crashed parties. This gear includes the above, plus additional water, meals, and survival gear. Although a standardized list {{is provided by the}} national command, many teams modify the list to match the needs of the mission.|$|E
5|$|The primary storyline {{heading into}} Genesis {{involved}} the TNA World Heavyweight Championship held by then-champion Kurt Angle. On the October 25 episode of TNA's television program TNA Impact!, Management Director Jim Cornette {{announced that the}} title would be defended in a tag team match with Angle and Kevin Nash against Sting and a partner of his choosing. The lead-up to this decision began at TNA's previous PPV event Bound for Glory on October 12. There, Sting defeated Angle to win the TNA World Heavyweight Championship. On the October 25 episode of Impact!, with help from Nash, Angle defeated Sting to win back the title. Due to the controversial circumstances, Cornette announced that Angle would defend the title in a tag team match, in which the <b>person</b> <b>that</b> got the pinfall or submission would win the title.|$|E

He offered to resign from his post in favour of any <b>person</b> <b>that</b> the assembly chose, but the dignitaries, led by Michael Palaiologos, dissuaded him and encouraged him to stay on and even accepted {{to take an oath}} of loyalty to him {{as well as to the}} young emperor. It was a sham, as a conspiracy by the leading aristocratic families was well under way to depose him, in which Palaiologos apparently played a covert but leading role.|$|E

5|$|Many of the tornadoes {{embedded}} in this initial squall line were weak, though several were strong and caused considerable damage. An EF3 caused major damage to homes in Coaling, Alabama, an EF2 and an EF3 caused major damage and a fatality near Eupora, Mississippi, and an EF3 caused heavy damage in downtown Cordova, Alabama, which {{was struck by}} a deadly EF4 tornado later that afternoon. One embedded cell that began in Cullman County, Alabama produced a long-tracked EF2 that struck the town of Hanceville, killing one <b>person.</b> <b>That</b> cell would go on to produce over ten tornadoes (mostly EF1s) to the northeast in Marshall County and another EF1 in Dade County, Georgia. The initial storms caused widespread power and telephone line outages across Alabama and Tennessee. This line of storms also caused some NOAA weather radio transmitter sites to stop functioning {{for the remainder of the}} outbreak. As a result, many people had no warning of approaching tornadoes later in the day.|$|E
5|$|Meltzer {{began the}} Hall of Fame by {{choosing}} {{a list of}} 122 inaugural inductees in 1996. Since then, wrestlers from past and present, others employed in the professional wrestling industry, and wrestling journalists and historians have been selected by Meltzer to cast secret ballots to determine annual groups of inductees. Voting criteria include {{the length of time}} spent in wrestling, historical significance, ability to attract viewers, and wrestling ability. Inductees must have at least 15 years of experience in the wrestling business or be over 35 years old and have 10 years of experience. To gain membership in the hall, potential inductees must receive 60% support on the ballots from their geographic region. Any <b>person</b> <b>that</b> gets less than 10% of the vote is eliminated from the ballot. If a person fails to get inducted 15 years after being put on the ballot, they must get 50% of the vote or be eliminated. There are 211 inductees, including the seven tag teams.|$|E

He also ruled himself out of being the lead vocalist of Velvet Revolver due to the experiences he has had of being the vocalist of his own band Loaded, saying that being the lead vocalist and being a bass player at the same time was not as appealing to him because it would require him to be much more static in his stage presence, saying that he prefers moving around on stage during live performances.
