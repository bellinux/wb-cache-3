Chips that were produced from vine pruning were subjected to some <b>pre-treatments</b> namely cold water, 1 % sodium hydroxide, and 1 % acetic acid in order to improve their performance in particleboard manufacturing. One-layer experimental particleboards with density of 0. 5 g/cm 3 were manufactured from vine pruning using 6, 8, 10 % percent of urea formaldehyde (UF) adhesive. Modulus of elasticity (MOE), modulus of rupture (MOR), internal bond strength (IB), thickness swelling (TS) and water absorption properties of the boards were evaluated, and a statistical analysis was performed in order to evaluate effects of <b>pre-treatments</b> on physical and mechanical properties. The results have shown that <b>pre-treatments</b> increase bending and internal bond strength of the boards while no significant effects has been observed on modulus of elasticity.

40|$|Anaerobic {{digestion}} (AD) is {{the most}} commonly applied end-treatment for the excess of waste activated sludge (WAS) generated in biological wastewater treatment processes. The efficacy of different typologies of <b>pre-treatments</b> in liberating intra-cellular organic substances and make them more usable for AD was demonstrated in several studies. However, the production of new extracellular polymeric substances (EPSs) that occur during an AD process, due to microbial metabolism, self-protective reactions and cell lysis, partially neutralizes the benefit of <b>pre-treatments.</b> The efficacy of post- and inter-stage treatments is currently under consideration to overcome the problems due to this unavoidable byproduct.

Batch mesophilic digestibility tests demonstrated that intermediate treatments were effective in making the residual organic substance of a 7 -day digestate usable for a second-stage AD process.
