40|$|The studies {{covered a}} total of 313 wards of <b>Part</b> <b>Time</b> Care <b>Centers.</b> This number {{comprised}} 227 boys and 86 girls in the age from 8 to 17 years. Anthropological examinations refered to measurements of body height and weight, the evaluation of secondary sexual traits in this age (the menarche in girls) and health conditions. Data concerning the above traits were also retrospectively obtained from the records since {{the time when the}} subjects were admitted to the institution. In 225 children of 313 additional measurements of 7 somatic traits were made and they are presented in fig. 3. Furhtermore exact information about the functioning of the family environment of the ward was collected. Due to a small number of the investigated subjects the results of somatic measurements were presented in the form of standardized values referring them to the arithmetical mean and the standard deviation of random sample of Warsaw children [J. CHARZEWSKI 1981]. This procedure permitted to omit the age groups of the examined subjects and to evaluate the differences in comparison with the reference group. The children from <b>Part</b> <b>Time</b> Care <b>Centers</b> show lower values of somatic traits and a slower rate of maturation in comparison with the random sample of Warsaw children. 1. The obtained differences are: - greater in boys than in girls - they are more intensively expressed in the height than in body weight. 2. These differences both in boys and girls decrease with the appearance of tfye successive degrees of sexual maturity being indirectly a proof of a delay in the maturity rate of the studied children. 3. The degree of the obtained differences depends on: - the extent of the pathology of family environment - and on the time of the child’s abiding in the Care Centers...|$|R
50|$|Early center caps {{were usually}} either very small, or very large. They started on cartwheels and wagons and slowly evolved into {{what we know}} them as today. Many of the centercaps from the 1950s to the 1970s were made of {{stainless}} steel.

40|$|In Britain, <b>part</b> <b>time</b> {{employment}} is typically used to combine work and motherhood: 60 % of employed mothers in Britain work <b>part</b> <b>time,</b> and this usually involves {{a transition from}} full time employment around the first childbirth. <b>Part</b> <b>time</b> jobs are often situated in lower level occupational groups and so a transition from full to <b>part</b> <b>time</b> employment may reduce the wage. Using the British Household Panel Survey this study investigates the wage impact of switching from full to <b>part</b> <b>time</b> employment. Furthermore, mother-specific wage impacts of re-entering employment after childbirth via <b>part</b> <b>time</b> employment are analysed. A mother of one child receives a pay penalty of 7 %, switching to <b>part</b> <b>time</b> employment increases this to 13 %. Mothers who move from full to <b>part</b> <b>time</b> employment over childbirth receive lower wages than mothers who remained in full or <b>part</b> <b>time</b> employment over childbirth for 10 years after the birth...|$|R

40|$|The rise of <b>part</b> <b>time</b> {{employment}} {{over the}} past forty years represents {{a fundamental change in}} the Australian labour market. <b>Part</b> <b>time</b> employment has become {{an important component of the}} range of working arrangements and represents an example of the labour market’s response to economic and social changes. It has been associated with increased diversity of the workforce and contributed to changes in workplace culture and attitudes towards work. There has been considerable debate about the reasons underlying the growth in <b>part</b> <b>time</b> work and whether it has been beneficial for individuals and the community as a whole. Indeed, some <b>part</b> <b>time</b> work is seen as a stop gap where full time employment is desired but cannot be achieved — these are the involuntary <b>part</b> <b>time</b> employed. But <b>part</b> <b>time</b> work also enables individuals to combine work with other activities such as undertaking studies or raising a family. More recently, it is being used increasingly to enable workers to transition more slowly to retirement.   This paper identifies who are <b>part</b> <b>time</b> workers; explores some suggested reasons why <b>part</b> <b>time</b> work has grown rapidly; examines the role it plays in response to changes in labour market conditions and individuals’ lives; identifies the nature and conditions of <b>part</b> <b>time</b> work and the contribution it makes to household income.  ...|$|R

40|$|University {{education}} in Kenya has witnessed a common cost cutting strategy – {{the use of}} <b>part</b> <b>time</b> lecturers. This is due to reduced government funding (public universities), and the increasing size of student enrollment. Numerous satellite campuses have therefore been established {{to cope with the}} situation. In return, this has led to cut throat competition in the academic sector, where enrolment in some Universities is very low. To realize profitability, cost cutting strategies have been adopted, inclusive, the use of <b>part</b> <b>time</b> faculty. The same is replicated in private Universities. This study sought to assess the effectiveness of <b>Part</b> <b>time</b> lecturers as a cost cutting strategy. A survey design was adopted. The target population was <b>part</b> <b>time</b> faculty in Kenyan Universities with campuses located in Nairobi Kenya. A sample of 130 <b>part</b> <b>time</b> faculty was used. Primary data was collected through self administered questionnaires. The study found that most universities employed <b>part</b> <b>time</b> faculty as a cost cutting strategy. It was established that part timers were not satisfied with their jobs and therefore were not adequately motivated, and lacked commitment in their work. This negatively impacts on their service delivery, which leads to a client exodus, and therefore less profitability. The study recommends that <b>part</b> <b>time</b> positions should be well regulated and adopted on a need basis rather than as a cost cutting strategy. Similarly, the study recommends policies to be enacted by the Universities so that <b>part</b> <b>time</b> staff is better co opted in the universities work force...|$|R
