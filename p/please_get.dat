500|$|During development, Mahito Yokota, who was {{in charge}} of the musical direction, {{originally}} wanted Super Mario Galaxy to have a Latin American style of music; and even had composed 28 tracks in that style. Latin American percussion instruments had already been featured in previous Super Mario instalments, such as steelpans, bongo drums, and congas. For Super Mario Galaxys theme, Yokota used Latin American instruments and a synthesiser to replicate the sounds featured in old science fiction films. The composition was approved by Yoshiaki Koizumi, the game's director and designer, but when Yokota presented it to the game's sound supervisor, Koji Kondo, he stated that it was [...] "no good". When asked why his music was rejected, Kondo responded: [...] "if somewhere in your mind you have an image that Mario is cute, <b>please</b> <b>get</b> rid of it". Incensed by the rejection, Yokota almost resigned from his job, but Kondo implied that Mario's character was [...] "cool" [...] and instructed him to try again.|$|E
500|$|Quinn's {{increasingly}} odd {{behavior was}} commented on by several reviewers. Chaney wrote {{that she was}} acting [...] "in an irrational manner that has no connection with reality", and Bell wondered if co-creator Murphy was [...] "trying to make her the most hated character on 'Glee' ever". Amy Reiter of The Los Angeles Times, though she noted that [...] "Quinn's character just gets weirder and weirder", wrote that Puck gets it right: [...] "Quinn's the craziest, most self-involved character on the show", but [...] "has a resilience that may take her far in life" [...] and needs a [...] "healthy dose of self-esteem". VanDerWerff was initially pleased that the show [...] "acknowledged that all of her actions are driven by a deep, sucking need to be loved" [...] and that [...] "Puck gently {{told her that she}} was better than that, that she could put herself together again", but not that it then [...] "just turned into more pointless Puck/Shelby/Quinn drama. Ugh." [...] Critics such as Kubicek were even more scathing about Shelby and the storyline with Puck that led to the pair having sex during the episode: [...] "The dumbest storyline Glee has ever done gets even dumber." [...] Sullivan called it [...] "the most divisive plot line of the season", and Bell asked, [...] "Instead of these super creepy scenes between Puck and Shelby, can we <b>please</b> <b>get</b> more screen time for Shelby and Rachel?" ...|$|E

500|$|Samantha Urban of The Dallas Morning News {{dismissed}} {{the fact that}} Shelby had been hired to form a second glee club at McKinley as [...] "mind-bogglingly idiotic". Amy Reiter of the Los Angeles Times found the idea incomprehensible, and Vanity Fair Brett Berk wrote, [...] "Given Will's ongoing struggles to fill his own crooning baker's dozen, {{this is about as}} realistic a plan as Michele Bachmann starting a rival chapter of PFLAG at Liberty University." [...] Vicki Hyman of The Star-Ledger characterized the notion of [...] "Shelby deciding to give up a burgeoning Broadway career because she was missing her daughter grow up" [...] to take a part-time job in Lima as [...] "ridiculous", and the whole scenario as [...] "more than a little bizarre". Puck and Shelby's kiss in the [...] "Pot o' Gold" [...] episode was characterized as [...] "creepy" [...] and [...] "super awkward" [...] by AOLTV's Crystal Bell, as either [...] "super creepy" [...] or [...] "romantic" [...] by BuddyTV's John Kubicek, and as [...] "groan-inducing" [...] in the [...] "You're actually going to go there?" [...] vein by IGN journalist Robert Canning. Critics were polarized by Puck and Shelby's sexual encounter in the [...] "I Kissed a Girl" [...] episode. Kubicek declared that [...] "the dumbest storyline Glee has ever done gets even dumber," [...] MTV contributor Kevin Sullivan called it [...] "the most divisive plot line of the season", and Bell asked, [...] "Instead of these super creepy scenes between Puck and Shelby, can we <b>please</b> <b>get</b> more screen time for Shelby and Rachel?" ...|$|E
500|$|Zacharias {{was born}} in Madras, India. He is descended from {{a woman of the}} Nambudiri Brahmin caste and a Christian man of the Boatman caste. His mother was from Madras (now Chennai) while his father was from Kerala. He grew up in Delhi. According to Zacharias, before her marriage, Swiss German missionaries had spoken to his Brahmin {{ancestor}} about Christianity and she had converted and had been made an outcast by her Brahmin family and community. Zacharias grew up in a nominal Anglican household, and says that he was an atheist until the age of 17 when he tried to commit suicide by swallowing poison. While in the hospital, a local Christian worker brought him a Bible and told his mother to read to him from John 14. [...] Zacharias says that it was [...] that touched him and meant to him as the defining paradigm: [...] "Because I live, you also will live." [...] He said that he thought, [...] "This may be my only hope: A new way of living. Life as defined by the Author of Life." [...] and that he committed his life to Christ praying, [...] "Jesus if You are the one who gives life as it is meant to be, I want it. <b>Please</b> <b>get</b> me out of this hospital bed well, and I promise I will leave no stone unturned in my pursuit of truth." [...] In 1966 Zacharias emigrated with his family to Canada, earning his undergraduate degree from the Ontario Bible College in 1972 (now Tyndale University College & Seminary) and his M.Div. from Trinity International University. In 1990 Mr. Zacharias did a 2-3 month sabbatical at Ridley Hall in the town of Cambridge. Zacharias has multiple honorary doctoral degrees.|$|E

In order to go quickly to the bank to send the money, I left my luggage at the depository and carried only a small bag with me. As soon as I {{came out of the}} train station, I saw a rather luxurious automobile and four Westerners standing by it. I did not realize that they were French, because in Shanghai there was a great mixture of Westerners and there were swarms of foreign visitors. It was quite common for cars to be used to pick up hotel guests. Little did I know that this car was there to kidnap someone! When I had gone a few steps from the station, one of the Westerners {{came up to me and}} said in Mandarin: 'This car is very nice; <b>please</b> <b>get</b> in.' I politely refused, saying 'I do not need a car.' Suddenly, one of the Westerners behind the car with a great heave pushed me inside it, the engine accelerated and we were off like a shot. In no time we had already entered the French Concession. The car drew up to the waterfront, where a French warship was docked. I now became a prisoner on this warship." ...|$|E
