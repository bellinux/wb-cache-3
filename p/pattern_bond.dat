40|$|This paper {{examines}} the topological properties of protein disulfide <b>bonding</b> <b>patterns.</b> First, {{a description of}} these patterns in terms of partially directed graphs is developed. The topologically distinct disulfide <b>bonding</b> <b>patterns</b> available to a polypeptide chain containing n disulfide bonds are enumerated, and their symmetry and reducibil-ity properties are examined. The theoretical probabilities are calculated that a randomly chosen <b>pattern</b> of n <b>bonds</b> will have any combination of symmetry and reducibility properties, given that all patterns have equal probability of being chosen. Next, the National Biomedical Research Foundation protein sequence and Brookhaven National Laboratories protein structure (PDB) databases are examined, and the occurrences of disulfide <b>bonding</b> <b>patterns</b> in them are determined. The frequencies of symmetric and/or reducible patterns are found to exceed theoretical predictions based on equiprobable pattern selection. Kauzmann’s model, in which disulfide bonds form during random encounters as the chain assumes random coil conformations, finds that bonds {{are more likely to}} form with near neighbor cysteines than with remote cysteines. The observed frequencies of occurrence of disulfide pat-terns are found here to be virtually uncorrelated with the predictions of this alternative random bonding model. These results strongly suggest that disulfide <b>bond</b> <b>pattern</b> formation is not the result of random factors, but in-stead is a directed process...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—During {{manufacture}} of wire bonding in packaged IC products, {{the breaking of}} bond wires and the peeling of bond pads occur frequently. The result is open-circuit failure in IC products. There were several prior methods reported {{to overcome these problems}} by using additional process flows or special materials. In this paper, a layout method is proposed to improve the bond wire reliability in general CMOS processes. By changing the layout <b>patterns</b> of <b>bond</b> pads, the reliability of bond wires on bond pads can be improved. A set of different layout <b>patterns</b> of <b>bond</b> pads has been drawn and fabricated in a 0. 6 - m single-poly triple-metal CMOS process for investigation by the bond wire reliability tests, the ball shear test and the wire pull test. By im-plementing effective layout <b>patterns</b> on <b>bond</b> pads in packaged IC products, not only the bond wire reliability can be improved, but also the bond pad capacitance can be reduced for high frequency application.

The hydrogen <b>bond</b> <b>patterns</b> and stabilities were characterized by analysis of the dynamics trajectories with specified hydrogen bond angle and distance criteria, and were compared with hydrogen <b>bond</b> <b>patterns</b> and stabilities previously determined from high-resolution NMR structural analysis and amide hydrogen exchange measurements in methanol. The two alamethicin simulations rapidly converged to a persistent hydrogen <b>bond</b> <b>pattern</b> {{with a high level}} of 3 (10) hydrogen bonding involving the amide NH's of residues 3, 4, 9, 15, and 18. The 3 (10) hydrogen bonds stabilizing amide NH's of residues C-terminal to P 2 and P 14 were previously proposed to explain their high amide exchange stabilities. The absence, or low levels of 3 (10) hydrogen bonds at the N-terminus or for A 15 NH, respectively, in the melittin simulations, is also consistent with interpretations from amide exchange analysis. Perturbation of helical hydrogen bonding in the residues before P 14 (Aib 10 -P 14, alamethicin; T 11 -P 14, melittin) was characterized in both peptides by variable hydrogen <b>bond</b> <b>patterns</b> that included pi and gamma hydrogen bonds. The general agreement in hydrogen <b>bond</b> <b>patterns</b> determined in the simulations and from spectroscopic analysis indicates that with suitable conditions (including solvent composition and counterions where required), local hydrogen-bonded secondary structure in helical peptides may be predicted from dynamics simulations from alpha-helical starting structures. Each peptide, particularly alamethicin, underwent some large amplitude structural fluctuations in which several hydrogen bonds were cooperatively broken.

To prove it and reveal the possible disulfide <b>bond</b> <b>pattern</b> of NFAP 2 an RP-HPLC method was applied.

Based on this finding as well as on our experience on folding of P. chrysogenum antifungal protein PAF (Váradi et al. 2013), disulfide bond formation of NFAP 2 was followed by reversed-phase liquid chromatography. Figure  5 c shows RP-HPLC elution profiles of folded NFAP 2 and PAF measured under the same conditions. NFAP 2 and PAF share structural similarities concerning their cationic character and the number of amino acids they are composed of. Both proteins are stabilized by three disulfide bridges.
