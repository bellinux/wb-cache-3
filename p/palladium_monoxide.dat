40|$|The {{catalytic}} effect in hydrogen oxidation experiments was evaluated using oxides of palladium that were formed electrochemically and their behavior {{was compared to}} oxides thermally formed in air. I-t curves measured at 0. 6 V(NHE) showed average current densities of 30 mA cm- 2 obtained with the electrochemical oxide compared to 40 mA cm- 2 obtained with the thermally formed oxide. Though the oxide formed electrochemically had 25 % less current density than the oxide formed thermally, its synthesis conditions are more energy efficient than those for the thermal oxide. This leads to envisioning its use as a catalyzer in low temperature fuel cells.

40|$|This work {{investigates the}} {{preparation}} {{and performance of}} palladium cobalt binary doped silica (PdCoSi) membranes. In view that palladium nitrates precipitate under typical silica 501 -gel synthesis conditions, membranes were prepared via the acid catalysis of tetraethylorthosilane (TEOS) with ethanol, palladium and cobalt chlorides. The largest H- 2 fluxes reached 0. 6 x 10 - 6 mol m(- 2) s(- 1) Pa- 1 at 500 degrees C for H- 2 permeation for the reduced membranes, whilst the best He/N- 2 permselectivies of 70 were observed for the oxidised membranes. The redox effect resulted in membranes with different performance as the reduction increased the total pore volumes of xerogels. However, XPS analysis revealed that <b>palladium</b> <b>monoxide</b> preferentially reduced to metal palladium, whilst reduction was not significant for cobalt oxide. Hence, the reduction to metallic palladium tailored molecular sieving domains through the loss of oxygen. As a result, the permeance of the larger molecular gases CO 2 and N- 2 increased, whilst only a small increase was observed for the smaller molecular gas He. Interestingly, the membranes essentially remained as molecular sieves as evidenced by temperature dependent activated transport and high permselectivities. The molecular sieving domains created preferential pathways for CO 2 and N- 2 permeance, though the silica matrix integrity remained generally intact. Hence, binary and multi doping of metal oxides in silica matrices {{can be used as}} a strategy to attain further functionalities not previously attained by pure silica or single metal oxide doped silica membranes using TEOS as a precursor (C) 2013 Elsevier B.

40|$|Abstract: Destructive {{tests of}} the {{catalyst}} was carried out to study the eect of temperature on the catalytic activity of CO coupling to diethyl oxalate (DEO) over a Pd-Fe/Al 2 O 3 catalyst. It was found that a temperature jump could cause the deactivation of the Pd-Fe/-Al 2 O 3 catalyst. The catalyst deactivated at dierent temperatures has dierent characteristics. After deactivation the crystal structure of -Al 2 O 3 did not change, but the Pd particle size was enlarged. Most of the Pd 0 were oxidized to Pd 2 +, and Fe 2 + was oxidized to Fe 3 + {{on the surface of}} the deactivated catalyst. The catalyst could be regenerated, but its original activity could not be recovered completely.
