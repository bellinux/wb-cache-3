40|$|Abstract The {{transition}} from fossil fuel to {{renewable energy sources}} such as biomass-to-energy (B 2 E) is an environmentally sustainable pathway. However, increased use of biomass is hampered by {{the high costs of}} logistics activities within the <b>physical</b> <b>flow.</b> There are several approaches for improving the <b>physical</b> <b>flow,</b> and in this thesis pre-treatment technology and coordination of activities have been explored. The purpose of this thesis is: to investigate how pre-treatment technology and coordination can improve the <b>physical</b> <b>flow</b> in B 2 E supply chains. This thesis consists of a kappa and five appended papers, based on two interview studies; a conceptual study; a techno-economical study and one multiple case study. This thesis is built on three cornerstones; supply chain attributes, pre-treatment technology and coordination, all centred on the <b>physical</b> <b>flow</b> as the unit of analysis. In order to improve the <b>physical</b> <b>flow,</b> the unique attributes of the B 2 E supply chain in which the flow is embedded need to be understood. Identification of these attributes has been an ongoing activity throughout the entire research process, using literature reviews and interviews as data collection methods. Biomass is a unique type of good for which it is concluded that there are nine distinct attributes in terms of (1) perishability, (2) shape of goods, (3) geographical spread, (4) weather and climate, (5) customer diversity, (6) fluctuations in demand, (7) time gaps between supply and demand, (8) system openness and (9) interorganisational relationships. These determine the configuration of supply chains and the <b>physical</b> <b>flow</b> therein. Also, these attributes serve as a platform for understanding how to make use of pre-treatment technology and coordination of activities to improve the <b>physical</b> <b>flow.</b> This thesis concludes that pre-treatment technology, in this thesis represented by torrefaction, has great potential to improve the <b>physical</b> <b>flow</b> within B 2 E supply chains, primarily by altering supply chain attributes. In particular, torrefaction alters the shape of goods, which then allows transport across longer distances. However, attributes also shape the ways in which torrefaction is made use of; e. g., variances in geographical spread shape the optimal size of a torrefaction plant. Also, the production strategies of torrefaction plants need to accommodate different end users and their respective distribution system. It is also concluded that in comparison to pre-treatment technology that alters a number of attributes, coordination of activities can primarily reduce the relative importance of B 2 E supply chain attributes, especially that of the shape of goods, which renders an improved <b>physical</b> <b>flow</b> in terms of higher transport efficiency. Similarly, the relative importance of fluctuations in demand and perishability can be reduced by moving storage downstream to power plants, or by power plants themselves investing in supplementary businesses, e. g. producing pellets. Also, the attributes shape the use of means of coordination; e. g., B 2 E supply chains are characterised by system openness, and therefore, network connections to other energy producers can be a barrier towards as well as an enabler for various means of coordination...|$|R

Design tools include service scenarios (which describe the interaction) and use cases (which illustrate the detail of time sequences in a service encounter).

However, when used in service design, they have been adequately adapted to include more information concerning material and immaterial components of a service, as well as time sequences and <b>physical</b> <b>flows</b> (Morelli 2006).

5000|$|A {{centrally}} {{planned economy}} combines public ownership {{of the means of}} production with centralised state planning. This model is usually associated with the Soviet-style command economy. In a {{centrally planned economy}}, decisions regarding the quantity of goods and services to be produced are planned in advance by a planning agency. In the early years of Soviet central planning, the planning process was based upon a selected number of <b>physical</b> <b>flows</b> with inputs mobilized to meet explicit production targets measured in natural or technical units. This material balances method of achieving plan coherence was later complemented and replaced by value planning, with money provided to enterprises so that they could recruit labour and procure materials and intermediate production goods and services. The Soviet economy was brought to balance by the interlocking of three sets of calculation, namely the setting up of a model incorporating balances of production, manpower and finance. The exercise was undertaken annually and involved a process of iteration (the [...] "method of successive approximation"). Although nominally a [...] "centrally planned" [...] economy, in reality formulation of the plan took place on a more local level of the production process as information was relayed from enterprises to planning ministries. Aside from the USSR and Eastern bloc economies, this economic model was also utilized by the People's Republic of China, Socialist Republic of Vietnam, Republic of Cuba and North Korea.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. The {{difference}} between schedule power flow and online power flow {{is that the}} former has no corresponding <b>physical</b> power <b>flow,</b> while the latter is the reappearance of existing <b>physical</b> power <b>flow.</b> Owing to the different premise, the selection of power flow calculation’s known quantities can be different. A schedule power <b>flow</b> schedules <b>physical</b> power <b>flow</b> for power system, so the selection of known quantities has strict requirements, such as active power and reactive power regulation capability. Since the <b>physical</b> power <b>flow</b> exists, the selection of online power flow calculation’s known quantities can be more flexible. For example, we can choose load bus as slack bus or replace PQ bus with PV bus. The example demonstrated that we could locate the stealing electricity buses by choosing load bus as slack bus. Considering that voltage amplitude measurement accuracy is higher than reactive power measurement accuracy, we can replace PQ bus with PV bus and make the power flow calculation results more consistent with the <b>physical</b> power <b>flow.</b> Finally, the examples show that online power flow calculation’s known quantities can be selected flexibly according to the actual situation rather than strictly following the classical power flow calculation requirements...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{deals with}} a state {{estimator}} or simply an observer of flow field. The observer, being a fundamental concept in the control system theory, also has a potential {{in the analysis of}} flow related problems as an integrated computational method with the aid of experiment. In the framework of the observer, the state of <b>physical</b> <b>flow</b> is estimated from the mathematical model with the feedback of on-line experimental measurement. A SIMPLER based flow simulation algorithm is used as the mathematical model of the real flow and partial experimental measurement of flow is fed back to the boundary condition through the feedback controller. The existence of the feedback-loop essentially distinguishes the observer from ordinary flow simulations. Time variation of the computational result of the observer is ex-pected to converge exactly to that of the <b>physical</b> <b>flow</b> in the whole flow domain even for unstable turbulent flows. A numerical experiment has been performed to confirm the validity of the proposed observer for a turbulent flow through a duct of square cross section. The <b>physical</b> <b>flow</b> to be estimated is modeled by a numerical solution. Appropriate choice for the proportional feedback gain of the observer results in accelerated convergence of the simulation by a factor of 0. 012 and reduced error in estimation of the perturbation velocity by a factor of 0. 6 in the whole domain or a factor of 0. 3 behind the output measurement plane in comparison with the ordinary flow simulation without feedback. ...|$|R

Yet, little is known about how this adjacent connectivity impacts on the "hidden" flows being exchanged between any two arbitrary nodes, after travelling longer non-adjacent paths.
