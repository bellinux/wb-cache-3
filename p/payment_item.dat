Only such an approach can provide with a comprehensive measure of external debt consistent across the range of debt instruments, institutional sectors and valuation methods used. This paper develops an assessment of external debt measures and concludes about their potential advantages and disadvantages. Comparisons are made by focusing on alternatives like external gross debt against external net debt, external debt vis-à-vis international investment position, and external debt at nominal value against external debt at market value.

40|$|This paper {{addresses}} {{the issue of}} foreign exchange and capital controls {{in the context of}} the Southern African Development Community’s goal of regional integration. It reviews the theory and evidence surrounding current and capital account liberalisation and argues that there is a lack of sufficiently refined de jure measures of capital account openness. A new index for measuring exchange control restrictiveness is created based on data from the International Monetary Fund’s Annual Report on Exchange Arrangements and Exchange Restrictions (AREAER) for the 15 SADC member states. It identifies substantial variation in the exchange control regulations across SADC countries that other existing, more indices fail to account for. The new index illustrates the considerable range of variation of exchange restrictiveness within SADC, as well as illustrating SADC’s relative exchange restrictiveness compared with other countries, inside and outside of Africa. The new index also correlates with several measures of financial development, certain balance of <b>payment</b> <b>items,</b> and some measures of institutional development, which makes it a useful measure for SADC integration. The paper highlights the challenges for SADC monetary union in the sphere of exchange control. ...|$|R

Pregovori Hrvatskih vlasti s EU počeli su godine 1995. i održani su prvi susreti stručnih tijela Hrvatske i Unije. Ostvarivanjem Sporazuma o pridruživanju u Hrvatskoj bi se promijenili mnogi gospodarski parametri, od ukidanja carina, do stavaka bilance plaćanja. Cilj hrvatske gospodarske politike jest pristup Europskoj uniji, a taj korak moraju potvrditi ekonomske analize o njegovoj korisnosti i učinkovitosti, što autorica pokušava pokazati ovim radom. Since {{getting its}} {{independence}} the Republic of Croatia {{has been trying}} to approach economically and politically to European integrations, especially to the European Union as the most significant European economic integration. Negotiations of Croatian authorities with EU started in 1995, when there were held first meetings of professional bodies of Croatia and Community. Technical negotiations within Agreement on Trade and Cooperation included three groups of problems, the solution of which should bring three important agreements: Agreement on Trade and Cooperation which had to be associated by Financial protocol, Agreement on Traffic and Agreementon Coal and Steel. Due to known political happenings negotiations were postponed all to political change in Croatia and the authority of democratic option. Afterwards, changes have been happening almost daily and Croatia hurriedly realizes what was omitted. As it became the member of European Council, WTO, CEFTA and Stability Pact, Croatia hurriedly prepares for accession to Agreement on Uniting. Realization of Agreement on Uniting in Croatia would change many economic parameters, from tariffs annulment, to balance of <b>payments</b> <b>items.</b> The answer to these questions is given by analyses of static and dynamic effects to accession to the European Union.
