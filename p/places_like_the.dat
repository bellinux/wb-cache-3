5|$|The black-on-white painted pottery {{found at}} Chaco Canyon {{originated}} from various places throughout the Four Corners region, including the Red Mesa Valley, northeastern Arizona, the San Juan River, and the Chuska Valley, forty miles distant. Whereas {{most of the}} gray ware, non-decorative or utility, pottery uncovered at Puebloan sites was produced locally, {{more than half of}} the vessels found in the canyon were imported from <b>places</b> <b>like</b> <b>the</b> Chuska Valley, which supplied the majority of utility pottery found in the region.|$|E
5|$|Gimmick! {{initially}} garnered lackluster {{interest and}} mixed reviews from publications like Famitsu, Electronic Gaming Monthly, and Nintendomagasinet. This lack of popularity was blamed on casual players {{being unable to}} handle the difficulty, and the industry's transition to newer 16-bit consoles like the Super NES and Mega Drive. When Gimmick! was exhibited at <b>places</b> <b>like</b> <b>the</b> Tokyo Toy Show, Sakai recalled that he was hoping a dealer would see Gimmick! as a next-generation title developed for the original Nintendo and distribute it, only for them to lose interest once they learned it was an NES game. In retrospect, he joked that the game took 10 years for people to appreciate.|$|E
5|$|The {{only major}} battle {{that took place}} between Japan and Germany was the siege of the German-controlled Chinese port of Tsingtao in Kiautschou Bay. The German forces held out from August until November 1914, under a total Japanese/British blockade, {{sustained}} artillery barrages and manpower odds of 6:1 – a fact that gave a morale boost during the siege as well as later in defeat. After Japanese troops stormed the city, the German dead were buried at Tsingtao and the remaining troops were transported to Japan where they were treated with respect at <b>places</b> <b>like</b> <b>the</b> Bandō Prisoner of War camp. In 1919, when the German Empire formally signed the Treaty of Versailles, all prisoners of war were set free and returned to Europe.|$|E

5|$|The tourism {{industry}} in Enugu, {{managed by the}} Enugu State Tourism Board (ESTB), is small; however, the state government recognises a variety of historic and recreational sites. These sites include <b>places</b> <b>like</b> <b>the</b> Udi Hills, from which the majority of Enugu city can be viewed. The Polo amusement park is a funfair that is among {{the first generation of}} public parks in the city; other parks in the city include the Murtala Muhammed Park.

Other galleries include the Bona Gallery.|$|E

25|$|There {{have been}} {{complaints}} that the hawsepiper progression path {{has been made}} too difficult since the requirements of STCW 95 have been enacted.

25|$|The {{origins of}} Hungarian opera {{can be traced}} to the late 18th century, with the rise of {{imported}} opera and other concert styles in cities like Pozsony, Kismarton, Nagyszeben and Budapest.

25|$|At {{the time}} of Suzuki's arrival, Zen had become a hot topic amongst some groups in the United States, {{especially}} beatniks.

Kato had done some presentations at the Academy and asked Suzuki to come join a class he was giving there on Buddhism. This sparked Suzuki's long-held desire to teach Zen to Westerners.|$|E
