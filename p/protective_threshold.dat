40|$|New {{vaccines}} against Streptococcus pneumoniae, {{which is}} the leading cause of invasive diseases, are important advances in improving childhood health. Following the introduction of heptavalent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine to the national vaccine schedule in more than 30 countries, evaluation of immunogenicity of the vaccines has been an important procedure to carry out. The concentration of 0. 35 microg/ml is suggested as the <b>protective</b> <b>threshold</b> against invasive disease. The additional absorption of the sera with pneumococcal type 22 F polysaccharide makes the test more specific for the pneumococcal antibody concentration and correlates well with <b>protective</b> <b>threshold</b> levels of 0. 20 microg/ml. The <b>protective</b> <b>threshold</b> levels for seropositivity of a child with post primary vaccination were; ELISA test specific for antibodies to vaccine-type capsular polysaccharides ≥ 0. 05 μg/ml, opsonophagocytic activity ≥ 1 : 8 and anti-PD antibody levels ≥ 100 EL. U/ml. The antibody level against Protein D is reported to be protective against otitis media due to nontypeable Haemophilus influenzae. By adding pneumococcal serotypes 1 - 5 - 7 F to vaccine, vaccine coverage was increased up to 80 % and could prevent otitis media and pneumoniae as well as IPD. Clinical studies demonstrated non-inferiority to PCV 7 and no interference with coadministered vaccines...|$|E
40|$|AbstractAntibodies to {{selected}} Plasmodium falciparum merozoite antigens {{are often}} {{reported to be}} associated with protection from malaria in one epidemiological cohort, but not in another. Here, we sought to understand this paradox by exploring the hypothesis that a threshold concentration of antibodies is necessary for protection. We analyzed data from two independent cohorts along the Kenyan coast, one in which antibodies to AMA 1, MSP- 2 and MSP- 3 were associated with protection from malaria (Chonyi) and another in which this association was not observed (Junju). We used a malaria reference reagent to standardize antibody measurements across both cohorts, and applied statistical methods to derive the threshold concentration of antibodies against each antigen that best correlated with a reduced risk of malaria (the <b>protective</b> <b>threshold),</b> in the Chonyi cohort. We then tested whether antibodies in Junju reached the <b>protective</b> <b>threshold</b> concentrations observed in the Chonyi cohort. Except for children under 3 years, the age-matched proportions of children achieving <b>protective</b> <b>threshold</b> concentrations of antibodies against AMA 1 and MSP- 2 were significantly lower in Junju compared to Chonyi (Fishers exact test, P< 0. 01). For MSP- 3, this difference was significant only among 4 – 5 year olds. We conclude that although antibodies are commonly detected in malaria endemic populations, they may be present in concentrations that are insufficient for protection. Our results have implications for the analysis and interpretation of similar data from immuno-epidemiological studies...|$|E

40|$|Young infants {{have reduced}} {{susceptibility}} to febrile malaria compared with older children, but the mechanism for this remains unclear. There are conflicting {{data on the}} role of passively acquired antibodies. Here, we examine antibody titres to merozoite surface antigens in the protection of children in their first two years of life in two settings with differing malaria transmission intensity and compare these titres to previously established <b>protective</b> <b>thresholds.</b> Two cohorts of children aged four to six weeks were recruited in Banfora, Burkina and Keur Soce, Senegal and followed up for two years. Malaria infections were detected by light microscopic examination of blood smears collected at active and passive case detection visits. The titres of antibodies to the Plasmodium falciparum recombinant merozoite proteins (AMA 1 - 3 D 7, MSP 1 - 19, MSP 2 -Dd 2, and MSP 3 - 3 D 7) were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay at 1 - 6, 9, 12, 15 and 18 months of age and compared with the <b>protective</b> <b>thresholds</b> established in Kenyan children. Antibody titres were below the <b>protective</b> <b>thresholds</b> throughout the study period and we did not find any association with protection against febrile malaria. Antibodies to AMA 1 and MSP 1 - 19 appeared to be markers of exposure in the univariate analysis (and so associated with increasing risk) and adjusting for exposure reduced the strength and significance of this association. The antibody levels we measured are unlikely to be responsible for the apparent protection against febrile malaria seen in young infants. Further work to identify protective antibody responses might include functional assays and a wider range of antigens...|$|R
40|$|Over {{the last}} 15 years the malaria burden has {{globally}} declined, but not evenly across endemic areas. In areas with substantial decline, elimination became realistic. However, malaria elimination has to, in a cost-effective way, overcome {{problems such as}} increasing drug and insecticide resistance and the increasing heterogeneity in transmission as the transmission intensity declines. Vaccines are proven cost-effective tools in infectious disease control and substantial progress was made with the RTS, S vaccine. However, vaccine development is hampered {{by the lack of}} reliable immune correlates of protection. We have analysed antibody responses in relation to the incidence of febrile malaria in young children, with the specific objective of investigating their contribution to the apparent resistance of young infants to febrile malaria. We have also analysed the dynamics of antibodies in relation to previously established <b>protective</b> <b>thresholds.</b> We found that the antibody responses to 6 different falciparum antigens were not associated with protection against febrile malaria in young children and that their levels were consistently below the <b>protective</b> <b>thresholds.</b> Furthermore, we found that antibody titres were often actually associated with increasing risk of febrile malaria. A likely explanation is that the antibodies were markers of exposure and hence associated with higher risk. We therefore analysed geo-spatial data on malaria risk to identify hotspots of clinical malaria and their association with hotspots of serological responses to malaria antigens. We found that 1) antibody responses correlated well with asymptomatic parasitaemia detected by polymerase chain reaction, and 2) there was substantial overlapping between the hotspots detected using these markers. Our data suggest that other mechanisms are responsible for the apparent resistance of infants to febrile malaria. Moreover, our data suggest that serology or polymerase chain reaction results may be used as markers for the detection of hotspots when the transmission declines to very low levels. ...|$|R

40|$|An {{increasing}} body {{of evidence}} suggests that a substantial proportion of individuals who respond to measles vaccine display an antibody boost accompanied by mild or no symptoms on exposure to wild virus. It is unknown whether this emerging class of individuals can support transmission. The epidemiologic consequences of vaccinated individuals able to transmit virus are investigated using a mathematical model. Parameters for this model are estimated using regression analysis on a Canadian serologic data set. The authors confirm that neutralizing antibodies are decaying significantly in absence of circulating virus. Based on a <b>protective</b> <b>threshold</b> plaque reduction neutralization (PRN) titer of 120, the authors estimate the mean duration of vaccine-induced protection in absence of reexposure to be 25 years (95 % confidence interval (CI) 18, 48). After long-term absence of circulating virus, the mathematical model predicts that 80 % (95 % CI 65, 91) of all seroconverted vaccinees have titers below the <b>protective</b> <b>threshold.</b> In this case, elimination of measles virus cannot be achieved by a single-dose routine vaccination strategy if the basic reproduction number in vaccinated individuals exceeds 1. 24 (95 % CI 1. 10, 1. 53).

40|$|BALB/c mice are {{resistant}} to measles virus (MV) -induced encephalitis due to their strong MV-specific CD 4 + T-cell response. Resistance is broken by neutralization of gamma interferon with monoclonal antibodies, indicating an important role for this pleiotropic cytokine. Here, we demonstrate that mouse gamma interferon has no direct antiviral effect in vitro and in vivo. The breakdown of resistance is due neither to a switch in the T-helper response nor to an impaired migration of CD 4 + T cells. Neutralization of gamma interferon interferes with the major histocompatibility complex class II-dependent antigen presentation and subsequent proliferation of CD 4 + T cells in vitro and in vivo. In consequence, the reduction in numbers of CD 4 + T cells below a <b>protective</b> <b>threshold</b> leads to susceptibility to MV-induced encephalitis...|$|E

40|$|Background and Methods: Highly {{pathogenic}} {{avian influenza}} (HPAI) viruses constitute a pandemic threat {{and the development}} of effective vaccines is a global priority. Sixty adults were recruited into a randomized clinical trial and were intramuscularly immunized with two virosomal vaccine H 5 N 1 (NIBRG- 14) doses (21 days apart) of 30 μg HA alone or 1. 5, 7. 5 or 30 μg HA adjuvanted with Matrix M. The kinetics and longevity of the serological responses against NIBRG- 14 were determined by haemagglutination inhibition (HI), single radial haemolysis (SRH), microneutralization (MN) and ELISA assays. The cross-H 5 clade responses in sera were determined by HI and the antibody-secreting (ASC) cell ELISPOT assays. The protective efficacy of the vaccine against homologous HPAI challenge was evaluated in ferrets. Results: The serological responses against the homologous and cross-reactive strains generally peaked one week after the second dose, and formulation with Matrix M augmented the responses. The NIBRG- 14 -specific seroprotection rates fell significantly by six months and were low against cross-reactive strains although the adjuvant appeared to prolong the longevity of the protective responses in some subjects. By 12 months post-vaccination, nearly all vaccinees had NIBRG- 14 -specific antibody titres below the <b>protective</b> <b>thresholds.</b> The Matrix M adjuvant was shown to greatly improve ASC and serum IgG responses following vaccination. In a HPAI ferret challenge model, the vaccine protected the animals from febrile responses, severe weight loss and local and systemic spread of the virus. Conclusion: Our findings show that the Matrix M-adjuvanted virosomal H 5 N 1 vaccine is a promising pre-pandemic vaccine candidate...|$|R

However, the effect of antenatal zinc supplementation on infants' postnatal immune response to vaccinations is unknown. The objective {{of this study was}} to evaluate the effect of zinc supplementation during pregnancy on immune response to the Bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) vaccine and the Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib) component of the combined diphtheria, tetanus toxoid and pertussis (DTP) -Haemophilus influenzae type-b (Hib) - conjugate vaccine in poor Bangladeshi infants. We immunized 405 infants whose mothers were supplemented daily with 30 mg elemental zinc or placebo beginning at 12 - 16 weeks gestation with the standard BCG vaccine at birth. A subcohort of 203 infants were in addition immunized at 1 -month intervals with three doses of DTP-Hib vaccine starting at 9 weeks of age. The delayed hypersensitivity (PPD) skin test was performed in 345 infants at 24 weeks of age. Hib polysaccharide (PRP) antibodies were assessed for 91 infants at 4 and 24 weeks of age. In infants born with low birth weight (LBW) a lower proportion of negative responses to PPD skin test were observed in the zinc (66. 2 %) compared to placebo (78. 5 %) group (p = 0. 07). No differences were observed in normal birth weight infants. There were no differences in proportion of infants above the <b>protective</b> <b>thresholds</b> for anti-PRP antibodies between zinc (81 %) and placebo (89 %) group.

40|$|Soils at {{waste sites}} must be {{evaluated}} {{for the potential}} of residual soil contamination to leach and migrate to the groundwater beneath the disposal area. If migration to the aquifer occurs, contaminants can travel vast distances and contaminate drinking water wells, thus exposing human receptors to harmful levels of toxins and carcinogens. To prevent groundwater contamination, a contaminant fate and transport analysis is necessary to assess the migration potential of residual soil contaminates. This type of migration analysis is usually performed using a vadose zone model to account for complex geotechnical and chemical variables including: contaminant decay, infiltration rate, soil properties, vadose zone thickness, and chemical behavior. The distinct advantage of using a complex model is that less restrictive, but still <b>protective,</b> soil <b>threshold</b> levels may be determined avoiding the unnecessary and costly remediation of marginally contaminated soils. However, the disadvantage of such modeling is the additional cost for data collection and labor required to apply these models. In order to allay these higher costs and to achieve a less restrictive but still protective clean-up level, a multiple contaminant and multi layered soil column equilibrium partitioning model was developed which is faster, simpler and less expensive to use...|$|R

Therefore, in {{addition}} to the significance of using thin, pliable, color-matched, and hairless cover in resurfacing the lesion in this area, recovery of sensation should also be taken into consideration. Materials and Methods: Thirteen patients with thumb degloving injuries were candidates for sensate reverse island radial forearm surgery. After transferring the flap, forearm lateral sensory nerve was sewn to the thumb digital nerve. At least for two years, these patients received regular diagnosis, and monofilament, static two point discrimination (S- 2 PD), and moving two point discrimination (M- 2 PD) tests were taken from them. Results: Monofilament test did not show normal sensation recovery, at protective sensation threshold, in the parents. The difference between monofilament test and normal thumb was statistically significant (p< 0. 0001). In spite of this, the protective sensation was restored in all flaps after two years.

40|$|The {{mumps virus}} {{belongs to the}} family of paramyxoviruses. It has a single-strand, nonsegmen-ted, negative-sense RNA genome and is spread by the {{respiratory}} route. Following a 12 – 25 -day incubation period, infection frequently causes the classic symptom of mumps: painfully swol-len parotid salivary glands (parotitis). Some complications of infection include hearing loss, orchitis, oophoritis, mastitis, and pancreatitis. Mumps may also result in aseptic meningitis and, infrequently, encephalitis (5 %– 10 % and< 0. 5 % of unvaccinated cases, respectively) [6]. Importantly {{it has been estimated that}} as many as 30 % of infections in unvaccinated individu-als may be asymptomatic [7]. What DoWe Know about the Immune Response to Mumps?

40|$|Infection of mice with sporozoites of Plasmodium berghei or Plasmodium yoelii {{has been}} used {{extensively}} to evaluate liver-stage protection by candidate preerythrocytic malaria vaccines. Unfortunately, repeated success of such vaccines in mice has not translated readily to effective malaria vaccines in humans. Thus, mice may be used better as models to dissect basic parameters required for immunity to Plasmodium-infection than as preclinical vaccine models. In turn, this basic information may aid in the rational design of malaria vaccines. Here, we describe a model of circumsporozoite-specific memory CD 8 T cell generation that protects mice against multiple P. berghei sporozoite challenges for at least 19 months. Using this model we defined a threshold frequency of memory CD 8 T cells in the blood that predicts long-term sterilizing immunity against liver-stage infection. Importantly, the number of Plasmodium-specific memory CD 8 T cells required for immunity greatly exceeds the number required for resistance to other pathogens. In addition, this model allowed us to identify readily individual immunized mice that exceed or fall below the <b>protective</b> <b>threshold</b> before infection, information that should greatly facilitate studies to dissect basic mechanisms of protective CD 8 T cell memory against liver-stage Plasmodium infection. Furthermore, the extremely large threshold in memory CD 8 T cell frequencies required for long-term protection in mice may {{have important implications for}} development of effective malaria vaccines...|$|E
40|$|INTRODUCTION: We {{examined}} the differential {{effects of the}} supply of physicians on care for breast cancer in Ontario and California. We then used criteria for optimum care for breast cancer to estimate the regional needs for the supply of physicians. METHODS: Ontario and California registries provided 951 and 984 instances of breast cancer diagnosed between 1998 and 2000 and followed until 2006. These cohorts were joined with the supply of county-level primary care physicians (PCPs) and specialists in cancer care and compared on care for breast cancer. RESULTS: Significant <b>protective</b> PCP <b>thresholds</b> (7. 75 to = 8. 25 PCPs per 10 000 inhabitants) were observed for breast cancer diagnosis (odds ratio [OR] 1. 62), receipt of adjuvant radiotherapy (OR 1. 64) and 5 -year survival (OR 1. 87) in Ontario, but not in California. The number of physicians seemed adequate to optimize care for breast cancer across diverse places in California and in most Ontario locations. However, there was an estimated need for 550 more PCPs and 200 more obstetrician-gynecologists in Ontario 2 ̆ 7 s rural and small urban areas. We estimated gross physician surpluses for Ontario 2 ̆ 7 s 2 largest cities. CONCLUSION: Policies are needed to functionally redistribute primary care and specialist physicians.

OBJECTIVE: To analyze the short-term functional outcome of an early re-education program using mirror therapy compared to a late classic sensory program for hand nerve repair. METHOD: This is a randomized controlled trial. We assessed 20 patients with median and ulnar nerve and flexor tendon repair using the Rosen Score combined with the DASH questionnaire. The early phase group using mirror therapy began on the first postoperative week and lasted 5 months. The control group received classic sensory re-education when the <b>protective</b> sensation <b>threshold</b> was restored. All participants received a patient education booklet and were submitted to the modified Duran protocol for flexor tendon repair. The assessments were performed by the same investigator blinded to the allocated treatment. Mann-Whitney Test and Effect Size using Cohen's d score were used for inter-group comparisons at 3 and 6 months after intervention. RESULTS: The primary outcome (Rosen score) values for the Mirror Therapy group and classic therapy control group after 3 and 6 months were 1. 68 (SD= 0. 5); 1. 96 (SD= 0. 56) and 1. 65 (SD= 0. 52); 1. 51 (SD= 0. 62), respectively. No between-group differences were observed.

40|$|New {{research}} data for low-dose, low- {{linear energy transfer}} (LET) radiation-induced, stochastic effects (mutations and neoplastic transformations) are modeled using the recently published NEOTRANS 3 model. The model incorporates a <b>protective,</b> stochastic <b>threshold</b> (StoThresh) at low doses for activating cooperative protective processes considered to include presumptive p 53 -dependent, high-fidelity repair of nuclear DNA damage in competition with presumptive p 53 -dependent apoptosis and a novel presumptive p 53 - independent protective apoptosis mediated (PAM) process which selectively removes genomically compromised cells (mutants, neoplastic transformants, micronucleated cells, etc.). The protective StoThresh are considered to fall in a relatively narrow low-dose zone (Transition Zone A). Below Transition Zone A is the ultra-low-dose region where {{it is assumed that}} only low-fidelity DNA repair is activated along with presumably apoptosis. For this zone there is evidence for an increase in mutations with increases in dose. Just above Transition Zone A, a Zone of Maximal Protection (suppression of stochastic effects) arises and is attributed to maximal cooperation of high-fidelity, DNA repair/apoptosis and the PAM process. The width of the Zone of Maximal Protection depends on low-LET radiation dose rate and appears to depend on photon radiation energy. Just above the Zone of Maximal Protection is Transition Zone B, where deleterious StoThresh for preventing the PAM process fall. Just above Transition Zone B is a zone of moderate doses where complete inhibition of the PAM process appears to occur. However, for both Transition Zone B and the zone of complete inhibition of the PAM process, high-fidelity DNA repair/apoptosis are presumed to still operate. The indicated protective and deleterious StoThresh lead to nonlinear, hormetic-type dose-response relationships for low-LET radiationinduced mutations, neoplastic transformation and, presumably, also for cancer...|$|R
40|$|It {{is largely}} unknown why certain {{infected}} hosts shed Herpes Simplex Virus- 2 (HSV- 2) more frequently {{and have more}} severe disease manifestations than others. One idea is that different density or functional capacity of tissue resident effector memory CD 8 + T-cells between infected persons may explain phenotypic variability. To generate hypotheses for contrasting shedding patterns in different infected hosts, a spatial mathematical model was employed to evaluate the effects of variability in tissue resident effector memory CD 8 + T-cell response, and HSV- 2 replication and spread, on viral shedding rate. Model simulations suggest that high levels of CD 8 + T-cells in the mucosa do not necessarily indicate a protective phenotype but rather an effective response to recent shedding. Moreover, higher CD 8 + T-cell expansion rate and lower viral replication rate, which correlate with better short-term control, may have only a minor impact on long term shedding rates. Breakthrough shedding occurs under all sets of model parameter assumptions, because CD 8 + T-cell levels only surpass a <b>protective</b> <b>threshold</b> in a minority of genital tract mucosal micro-regions. If CD 8 + T-cell levels are artificially increased using an immunotherapeutic approach, better control of shedding is predicted to occur {{for at least a}} year.

Currently, all registered live and inactivated JEV vaccines are derived from genotype III viruses. In Taiwan, the compulsory JEV vaccination policy recommends that children receives four doses of formalin-inactivated Nakayama (GIII) JEV vaccine. Methodology/Principal Findings: To evaluate the influence of genotype replacement on the post-vaccination viral neutralizing ability by GIII and GI viruses, the small panel of vaccinated-children serum specimens was assembled, and the reciprocal 50 % plaque-reduction neutralizing antibody titers (PRNT 50) were measured against Nakayama vaccine strain, CJN GIII human brain isolate and TC 2009 - 1 GI mosquito isolate. The seropositivity rate (PRNT 50 $ 1 : 10) and geometric mean titers (GMT) against the TC 2009 - 1 virus were the lowest among the three viruses. The <b>protective</b> <b>threshold</b> against the CJN and TC 2009 - 1 viruses could only be achieved when the GMT against Nakayama virus was $ 1 : 20 or $ 1 : 80, respectively.

Maternal serum antibody protects infants from RSV disease. The objective of our study was to characterize RSV antibody levels in mother-infant pairs. Methods. Serial serum samples were collected from mother-infant pairs in Bangladesh from the third trimester of pregnancy to 72 weeks postpartum and tested using an RSV antibody microneutralization assay. Serologic infec-tion was defined as a 4 -fold increase in antibody titer. Maternal antibody half-life was calculated using infant anti-body titers from birth to 20 weeks. Results. The ratio of infant cord blood to maternal serum RSV antibody titers in 149 mother-infant pairs was 1. 01 (95 % confidence interval [CI],. 99 – 1. 03). Maternal RSV antibody titers in the third trimester and at birth were strongly correlated (R = 0. 68). Antibody half-life was 38 days (95 % CI, 36 – 42 days). Higher cord blood RSV antibody titers were associated with a lower risk of serologic infection (P =. 01) and maintenance of antibody titer above a potentially <b>protective</b> <b>threshold</b> (P <. 001).

40|$|Introduction: Pandemic {{influenza}} A H 1 N 1 infections occurred worldwide from 2009. Children {{were particularly}} vulnerable. Novel vaccines were {{used during the}} pandemic. Objective: To assess the persistence of antibody to H 1 N 1 influenza 1 year after children aged 6 months to 12 years had been immunised with two doses of either a non-adjuvanted whole-virion H 1 N 1 influenza vaccine or an AS 03 B-adjuvanted split-virion H 1 N 1 influenza vaccine; and also to assess the immunogenicity and reactogenicity in this population of a single dose of 2010 - 11 trivalent seasonal influenza vaccine. Design: Multicentre, open-label, follow-on from randomised, head-to-head trial. Setting: Five UK sites (Southampton, Oxford, Bristol, London and Exeter). Participants: Children who completed last year's head-to-head randomised study were invited to participate. Children who had subsequently received a further dose of H 1 N 1 vaccine, or who had already received a dose of 2010 - 11 trivalent seasonal influenza vaccine, were excluded. Interventions: In the previous study, children were randomised (in a 1 : 1 ratio) to receive two doses, 21 days apart, of either a non-adjuvanted whole-virion H 1 N 1 influenza vaccine or an AS 03 B-adjuvanted split-virion H 1 N 1 influenza vaccine. In this follow-on study, a blood sample was taken to assess the persistence of antibody 1 year later, followed by administration of one 0. 5 ml-dose of trivalent seasonal influenza vaccine. A second blood sample was taken 3 weeks later. Main outcome measures: Comparison between vaccines {{of the percentage of}} participants with a microneutralisation (MN) titre ? 1 : 40 and a haemagglutination titre ? 1 : 32, 1 year after vaccination. Immunogenicity of the trivalent seasonal influenza vaccine was assessed 3 weeks after vaccination by both the MN and the haemagglutination inhibition (HI) titres. Reactogenicity data were recorded for 7 days after vaccination. Results: A total of 323 children were enrolled and 318 were included in the analysis of the persistence of antibody. One year after receipt of whole-virion vaccine, the MN titre was ? 1 : 40 in 32. 4 % of those vaccinated when < 3 years old and in 65. 9 % of those vaccinated when ? 3 years old; the HI titre was ? 1 : 32 in 63. 2 % and 79. 1 % of children in the respective age groups. One year after receipt of the adjuvanted vaccine, the MN titre was ? 1 : 40 in 100 % of those vaccinated when < 3 years old and in 96. 9 % of those vaccinated when ? 3 years old; the HI titre was ? 1 : 32 in 98. 4 % and 96. 9 % of children in the respective age groups. Three hundred and two children were given trivalent seasonal influenza vaccination. Three weeks later, sera were obtained from 282 children; 100 % had an MN titre ? 1 : 40 and HI titre ? 1 : 32.

40|$|Physical {{activity}} (PA) {{is thought}} {{to play an important}} role in preventing bone loss and osteoporosis in older people. However the type of activity which is most effective in this regard remains unclear. Objectively measured PA using accelerometers is an accurate method for studying relationships between PA and bone and other outcomes. We recently used this approach in the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC) to examine relationships between levels of vertical impacts associated with PA and hip bone mineral density (BMD). Interestingly, vertical impacts > 4 g, though rare, largely accounted for the relationship between habitual levels of PA and BMD in adolescents. However, in a subsequent pilot study where we used the same method to record PA levels in older people, no > 4 g impacts were observed. Therefore, to the extent that vertical impacts need to exceed a certain threshold in order to be bone <b>protective,</b> such a <b>threshold</b> is likely to be considerably lower in older people. Further studies aimed at identifying such a threshold in older people are planned, to provide a basis for selecting exercise regimes in older people which are most likely to be bone protective...|$|R
40|$|Pandemic {{influenza}} A H 1 N 1 infections occurred worldwide from 2009. Children {{were particularly}} vulnerable. Novel vaccines were {{used during the}} pandemic. To assess the persistence of antibody to H 1 N 1 influenza 1 year after children aged 6 months to 12 years had been immunised with two doses of either a non-adjuvanted whole-virion H 1 N 1 influenza vaccine or an AS 03 B-adjuvanted split-virion H 1 N 1 influenza vaccine; and also to assess the immunogenicity and reactogenicity in this population of a single dose of 2010 - 11 trivalent seasonal influenza vaccine. Multicentre, open-label, follow-on from randomised, head-to-head trial. Five UK sites (Southampton, Oxford, Bristol, London and Exeter). Children who completed last year's head-to-head randomised study were invited to participate. Children who had subsequently received a further dose of H 1 N 1 vaccine, or who had already received a dose of 2010 - 11 trivalent seasonal influenza vaccine, were excluded. In the previous study, children were randomised (in a 1 : 1 ratio) to receive two doses, 21 days apart, of either a non-adjuvanted whole-virion H 1 N 1 influenza vaccine or an AS 03 B-adjuvanted split-virion H 1 N 1 influenza vaccine. In this follow-on study, a blood sample was taken to assess the persistence of antibody 1 year later, followed by administration of one 0. 5 ml-dose of trivalent seasonal influenza vaccine. A second blood sample was taken 3 weeks later. Comparison between vaccines {{of the percentage of}} participants with a microneutralisation (MN) titre ≥ 1 : 40 and a haemagglutination titre ≥ 1 : 32, 1 year after vaccination. Immunogenicity of the trivalent seasonal influenza vaccine was assessed 3 weeks after vaccination by both the MN and the haemagglutination inhibition (HI) titres. Reactogenicity data were recorded for 7 days after vaccination. A total of 323 children were enrolled and 318 were included in the analysis of the persistence of antibody. One year after receipt of whole-virion vaccine, the MN titre was ≥ 1 : 40 in 32. 4 % of those vaccinated when < 3 years old and in 65. 9 % of those vaccinated when ≥ 3 years old; the HI titre was ≥ 1 : 32 in 63. 2 % and 79. 1 % of children in the respective age groups. One year after receipt of the adjuvanted vaccine, the MN titre was ≥ 1 : 40 in 100 % of those vaccinated when < 3 years old and in 96. 9 % of those vaccinated when ≥ 3 years old; the HI titre was ≥ 1 : 32 in 98. 4 % and 96. 9 % of children in the respective age groups. Three hundred and two children were given trivalent seasonal influenza vaccination. Three weeks later, sera were obtained from 282 children; 100 % had an MN titre ≥ 1 : 40 and HI titre ≥ 1 : 32. Trivalent seasonal influenza vaccine was well tolerated, although in children < 5 years old, fever ≥ 38 °C was reported in 13. 6 % of those who had previously received whole-virion vaccine, and in 18. 3 % of those who had received adjuvanted vaccine.

In the optimized multiplex immunoassay (MIA), intravenous immune globulin was introduced as an in-house reference serum, and nonspecific reacting antibodies were adsorbed with the commercial product pneumococcal C polysaccharides Multi. The antibody concentrations were assessed in 188 serum samples obtained pre- and post-booster vaccination at 11 months after administration of a primary series of the pneumococcal seven-valent conjugate vaccine (PCV- 7) at 2, 3, and 4 months of age. The results of the MIA were {{compared with those of}} the ELISA for the serotypes included in the seven-valent conjugated polysaccharide vaccine and for a non-vaccine serotype, serotype 6 A. The geometric mean concentrations of the antibodies determined by MIA were slightly higher than those determined by ELISA. The correlations between the assays were good, with R 2 values ranging from 0. 84 to 0. 91 for all serotypes except serotype 19 F, for which R 2 was 0. 70. The concentrations of antibody against serotype 6 A increased after the administration of PCV- 7 due to cross-reactivity with serotype 6 B. The differences between the results obtained by ELISA and MIA suggest that the internationally established <b>protective</b> <b>threshold</b> of 0. 35 μg/ml should be reevaluated for use in the MIA and may need to be amended separately for each serotype...|$|E
40|$|Protection of {{biodiversity}} {{is a major}} objective in environmental management. However, standard protocols for ecological risk assessments use endpoints that are {{not directly related to}} biodiversity. In the present study, the changes in five biodiversity indicators, namely, the Hill, Shannon-Wiener, Simpson's diversity index, AZTI's Marine Benthic Index (AMBI), and Benthic Quality Index (BQI), are calculated in case species experience direct chemical effects. This is done for an uncontaminated situation as well as for situations in which the effect concentration of a certain fraction of species (x%) is exceeded, that is, at the hazardous concentration (HCx) of the species sensitivity distribution (SSD) of the considered community. Results indicate that the response of the biodiversity indicators to concentrations spanning the complete concentration range of the SSD is variable. This response depends mainly on the type of indicator, the species assemblage, and the ratio of the slope of the concentration effect curves of the species and the slope of the SSD. At the HC 5, a commonly used threshold in environmental risk assessment, biodiversity indicators, are affected at a marginal level (change is less than 5 % in 99. 6 % of the simulated cases). Based on the results, the HC 5 level {{is likely to be a}} <b>protective</b> <b>threshold</b> for changes in biodiversity in terms of richness and heterogeneity in the vast majority of the simulated cases (99. 6 %) for chemicals for which direct effects are dominant...|$|E

Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is the most important viral cause of pneumonia. Maternal serum antibody protects infants from RSV disease. The objective of our study was to characterize RSV antibody levels in mother-infant pairs. Methods. Serial serum samples were collected from mother-infant pairs in Bangladesh from the third trimester of pregnancy to 72 weeks postpartum and tested using an RSV antibody microneutralization assay. Serologic infec-tion was defined as a 4 -fold increase in antibody titer. Maternal antibody half-life was calculated using infant anti-body titers from birth to 20 weeks. Results. The ratio of infant cord blood to maternal serum RSV antibody titers in 149 mother-infant pairs was 1. 01 (95 % confidence interval [CI],. 99 – 1. 03). Maternal RSV antibody titers in the third trimester and at birth were strongly correlated (R = 0. 68). Antibody half-life was 38 days (95 % CI, 36 – 42 days). Higher cord blood RSV antibody titers were associated with a lower risk of serologic infection (P =. 01) and maintenance of antibody titer above a potentially <b>protective</b> <b>threshold</b> (P <. 001). Conclusions. Efficient transplacental transfer of RSV-specific antibody frommother to the fetus was documented in mother-infant pairs in Asia.

The objective is to estimate corrosion flaw sizes on the pipeline quantitatively instead of direct excavation of the pipeline and eventual use of measuring tape to measure the flaws on the pipeline. The pipelines buried in the Benin sands at Ikot Abasi, South of the Niger Delta Basin became instructive for this study. The survey consisted of electrical potential profiling using Close Interval Pipe-Soil potential survey (CIPS) and Horizontal Electrical Profiling (HEP) according to Wenner electrodes arrangement. Two permanent test points (PS) {{were used for the}} study and the flaw sizes were estimated at points delineated to be of high corrosion risk in the study area. The data for close interval potential and HEP were analyzed and interpreted in line with the <b>threshold</b> <b>protective</b> potential (- 850 mV) as well as the American Water Works Association (AWWA) soil corrosivity rating. Results indicate high risk zones due to external corrosion at pipeline length 25 - 30 m from PS 1 and 80 m from PS 2. These locations contain significant saline groundwater that facilitates corrosion of metal pipes buried within the area. The results also suggest that the corrosion protection systems for the pipeline need to be reinforced to mitigate further growth of the flaws on the pipeline segment.

40|$|The {{measurement}} of antibody responses to vaccination {{is useful in}} the assessment of immune status in suspected immune deficiency. Previous reliance on enzyme-linked immunoabsorbent assays (ELISA) has been cumbersome, time-consuming and expensive. The availability of flow cytometry systems has {{led to the development of}} multiplexed assays enabling simultaneous {{measurement of}} antibodies to several antigens. We optimized a flow cytometric bead-based assay to measure IgG and IgM concentrations in serum to 19 antigens contained in groups of bacterial subunit vaccines: pneumococcal vaccines, meningococcal vaccines, Haemophilus influenzae b (Hib), and tetanus and diphtheria toxoid vaccines. 89 -SF was employed as the standard serum. The assay was used to determine specific antibody levels in serum from 193 healthy adult donors. IgG and pneumococcal IgM antibody concentrations were measurable across 3 log 10 ranges encompassing the <b>threshold</b> <b>protective</b> IgG antibody levels for each antigen. There was little interference between antibody measurements by the 19 -plexed assay compared with monoplexed assays, and a lack of cross-reactive IgG antibody, but evidence for cross-reacting IgM antibody for 3 / 19 pneumococcal antigens. 90 th centile values for 15 / 19 IgG concentrations and 12 / 12 IgM concentrations of the 193 adult sera were within these ranges and percentages of sera containing protective IgG antibody levels varied from 4 % to 95 % depending on antigen. This multiplexed assay can simultaneously measure antibody levels to 19 bacterial vaccine antigens. It is suitable for use in standard clinical practice to assess the in vivo immune response to test vaccinations and measure absolute antibody levels to these antigens...|$|R
40|$|AIM: To {{determine}} the immunogenicity of routine vaccination against diphtheria, tetanus, and Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib) in Asian infants {{born in the}} UK, and whether maternal antibody suppression occurs. METHODS: A cohort study with 80 % power, within 95 % confidence limits, to show that 80 % or fewer Asian infants would respond with an anti-PRP antibody concentration > 0. 15 microg/ml. Infants of South Asian origin born in Berkshire were enrolled at two general practices in Reading: 41 Asian families sequentially asked to participate within 2 weeks of birth; 36 infants were enrolled and 34 completed the study. Main outcome measures were: antibody concentration against diphtheria, tetanus, and Hib expressed as geometric mean titres (GMT) and proportion of infants about a <b>threshold</b> <b>protective</b> antibody concentration. RESULTS: Median age for completing primary vaccination course was 5 months. All 34 achieved anti-PRP antibody concentration of > 0. 15 microg/ml, 33 were > 1. 0 microg/ml, and the GMT was 15. 0 microg/ml. All infants developed protective antibody concentration > 0. 1 IU/ml for tetanus and diphtheria; the respective GMTs were 1. 94 and 5. 57 IU/ml. Infants with high (> 0. 25 IU/ml) antibody concentrations against diphtheria and tetanus at 2 months achieved lower antibody concentrations after their three dose course than those with low concentrations (< 0. 1 IU/ml) (p = 0. 06 and 0. 03, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Despite evidence for maternal antibody suppression of the response to tetanus and diphtheria vaccination, excellent antibody responses were achieved by routine vaccination according to the accelerated schedule.

The envelope (E) protein is a structural protein thatelicits protective neutralizing antibodies (Nt Ab). The GIII at 222 (a live-attenuated swinevaccine) virus E protein differs at eight amino acid residues (E- 123, E- 129, E- 138, E- 176, E- 209, E- 222, E- 327 and E- 366) {{from that of the}} GI TC 2009 - 1 strain (isolated in Taiwan in 2009). Twenty piglets were vaccinated with two doses of at 222 vaccine, and serumspecimens were collected to evaluate the strain-specific Nt Ab titer against GIII at 222, GIIICJN, and GI TC 2009 - 1 viruses. Seropositivity rates (Nt Ab titer 1 : 10) and geometric meantiters (GMT) were similar against at 222 and CJN viruses.

Deficiency of AAT is a genetic disorder that occurs {{as a result of the}} inheritance of two protease inhibitor deficient alleles. Of the deficient alleles, Pi*Z is the most common, and the homozygous form Pi*ZZ results in the lowest serum levels, usually below 50 mg/ dl. The “protective threshold” is 80 mg/dl. Smoking increases the risk of emphysema. The current goal of augmentation therapy is to raise the plasma levels, above <b>protective</b> <b>threshold</b> and slow disease progression. The authors present the experience of the Day Care Hospital of the Pulido Valente Hospital with five male patients presenting emphysema due to AAT deficiency, receiving weekly intravenous treatment with Prolastin®. We performed a clinical, respiratory functional and radiological evaluation between 2003 and 2007. The results point to a slower progression of the disease, with clinical and radiological stability and a reduced rate of FEV 1 decline. Augmentation therapy is an expensive treatment and its use is lacking supportive evidence of efficacy by randomized controlled clinical trials. Evidence that it confers benefits is based on observational studies. Our experience is positive, showing clinical, radiological and functional benefits.

40|$|Cyclic AMP {{produced}} from membrane receptor complex bound adenylyl cyclases is protective in corneal endothelial cells (CEC). CEC also express soluble adenylyl cyclase (sAC), which is localized throughout the cytoplasm. When activated by HCO 3 −, cAMP concentration ([cAMP]) increases by ∼ 50 %. Here we ask if cAMP {{produced from}} sAC is also protective. We {{examined the effects}} of HCO 3 −, pH, phosphodiesterase 4 inhibition by rolipram, sAC inhibition by 2 HE (2 -hydroxyestradiol), and sAC small interfering RNA (siRNA) knockdown on basal and staurosporine-mediated apoptosis. HCO 3 − (40 mM) or 50 μM rolipram raised [cAMP] to similar levels and protected endothelial cells by 50 % relative to a HCO 3 −-free control, whereas 2 HE, which decreased [cAMP] by 40 %, and H 89 (PKA inhibitor) doubled the apoptotic rate. sAC expression was reduced by two-thirds in the absence of HCO 3 − and was reduced to 15 % of control by sAC siRNA. Protection by HCO 3 − was eliminated in siRNA-treated cells. Similarly, caspase- 3 activity and cytochrome c release were reduced by HCO 3 − and enhanced by 2 HE or siRNA. Analysis of percent annexin V+ cells as a function of [cAMP] revealed an inverse, nonlinear relation, suggesting a <b>protective</b> <b>threshold</b> [cAMP] of 10 pmol/mg protein. Relative levels of phosphorylated cAMP response element binding protein and phosphorylated Bcl- 2 were decreased in CEC treated with 2 HE or siRNA, suggesting that HCO 3 −-dependent endogenous sAC activity can mobilize antiapoptotic signal transduction. Overall, our data suggest a new role for sAC in endogenous cellular protection...|$|E

Thresholds for PBZ in equine plasma of 15 and 2 lg ml) 1 were proposed by United States Equestrian Federa- tion-USEF and Racing commissioner international-RCI. The Federation Equestre Internationale-FEI, through the European Horserace Scientific Liaison Committee-EHSLC, has proposed a detection time of 168 h for PBZ in blood based on a LOD of 0. 050 lg ml) 1. The aim of this study was to evaluate plasma clearance of PBZ in healthy horses following both intravenous and oral administration of two commercial products marketed in Italy at the maximum dosage regimen, recommended by the manufacturer. MATERIALS AND METHODS PBZ was administered to horses intravenously (n = 6) or orally (n= 6) at a dose rate of 4. 4 mgkg) 1 once daily for five consecutive days. Both experiments involved six thoroughbred horses (three females and three males) weighing from 450 to 600 kg and aged 5 – 11 years. Blood (10 ml) samples were collected before the last dose (t 0) and then after 1, 3, 6, 9, 12 and 24 h; and every 12 h for 10 days after treatment. Plasma levels of PBZ and its major metabolite OPBZ were measured by HPLC-UV (LOD = 0. 025 lg ml) 1). The study was conducted with the approval of the ethic committee of the University of Pisa. RESULTS Plasma PBZ and OPBZ concentrations, after both intravenous and oral administration, showed a rapid elimination profile and were below the LOD at 84 h after the administration of the last dose. Plasma levels of OPBZ were 25 % or less of the concentra- tions of PBZ, showing a rapid elimination profile and being less than LOD at 84 h after the administration of the last dose. At 168 h both plasma PBZ and OPBZ were not detectable in any horse. The oral bioavailability of PBZ was 23 %. CONCLUSIONS Plasma elimination profile of the two commercial formulations of PBZ investigated in this study was rapid. The detection time suggested by the FEI for PBZ is largely <b>protective.</b> The <b>thresholds</b> indicated by USEF were reached within 4 – 6 h after intravenous administration and have never been reached after oral admin- istration.
