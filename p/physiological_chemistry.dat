5|$|As of 2015, {{there have}} been 28 laureates {{affiliated}} with the University of Pennsylvania, 6 alone in the last 10 years. The University of Pennsylvania considers laureates who attended the university as undergraduate students, graduate students or {{were members of the}} faculty as affiliated laureates. Otto Fritz Meyerhof, a research professor in <b>physiological</b> <b>chemistry,</b> was the first University of Pennsylvania laureate, winning the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1922. Two Nobel Prizes were shared by University of Pennsylvania laureates; Ragnar Granit and Haldan Keffer Hartline won the 1967 Nobel Prize in Chemistry, and Alan J. Heeger, Alan MacDiarmid and Hideki Shirakawa won the 2000 Nobel Prize in Chemistry. Three laureates, Christian B. Anfinsen, Gerald Edelman, and John Robert Schrieffer, won different Nobel Prizes in 1972, and were awarded an honorary Doctor of Science degree in 1973. Nine University of Pennsylvania laureates have won the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine, more than any other category.|$|E
5|$|By {{the end of}} the 19th century all of {{the major}} {{pathways}} of drug metabolism had been discovered, along with the outlines of protein and fatty acid metabolism and urea synthesis. In {{the early decades of the}} 20th century, the minor components of foods in human nutrition, the vitamins, began to be isolated and synthesized. Improved laboratory techniques such as chromatography and electrophoresis led to rapid advances in <b>physiological</b> <b>chemistry,</b> which—as biochemistry—began to achieve independence from its medical origins. In the 1920s and 1930s, biochemists—led by Hans Krebs and Carl and Gerty Cori—began to work out many of the central metabolic pathways of life: the citric acid cycle, glycogenesis and glycolysis, and the synthesis of steroids and porphyrins. Between the 1930s and 1950s, Fritz Lipmann and others established the role of ATP as the universal carrier of energy in the cell, and mitochondria as the powerhouse of the cell. Such traditionally biochemical work continued to be very actively pursued throughout the 20th century and into the 21st.|$|E

40|$|The Nutritional Status Assessment Supplemental Medical Objective was an {{experiment}} initiated to expand nominal pre- and postflight clinical nutrition testing, {{and to gain}} a better understanding of the time course of changes during flight. The primary activity of this effort was collecting blood and urine samples 5 times during flight for analysis after return to Earth. Samples were subjected to a battery of tests, including nutritional, <b>physiological,</b> general <b>chemistry,</b> and endocrinology indices. These data provide a comprehensive survey of how nutritional status and related systems are affected by 4 - 6 months of space flight. Analyzing the data will help us to define nutritional requirements for long-duration missions, and better understand human adaptation to microgravity. This expanded set of measurements will also aid in the identification of nutritional countermeasures to counteract, for example, the deleterious effects of microgravity on bone and muscle and the effects of space radiation...|$|R

25|$|The {{synthesis}} of urea by Friedrich Wöhler {{opened a new}} research field, organic chemistry, {{and by the end}} of the 19th century, scientists were able to synthesize hundreds of organic compounds. The later part of the 19th century saw the exploitation of the Earth's petrochemicals, after the exhaustion of the oil supply from whaling. By the 20th century, systematic production of refined materials provided a ready supply of products which provided not only energy, but also synthetic materials for clothing, medicine, and everyday disposable resources. Application of the techniques of organic chemistry to living organisms resulted in <b>physiological</b> <b>chemistry,</b> the precursor to biochemistry. The 20th century also saw the integration of physics and chemistry, with chemical properties explained as the result of the electronic structure of the atom. Linus Pauling's book on The Nature of the Chemical Bond used the principles of quantum mechanics to deduce bond angles in ever-more complicated molecules. Pauling's work culminated in the physical modelling of DNA, the secret of life (in the words of Francis Crick, 1953). In the same year, the Miller–Urey experiment demonstrated in a simulation of primordial processes, that basic constituents of proteins, simple amino acids, could themselves be built up from simpler molecules.|$|E
2500|$|The term [...] "biochemistry" [...] itself [...] {{is derived}} from a {{combination}} of biology and chemistry.

The study found that this group of vegetarians (lacto-ovo) have a significantly higher amount of plasma carboxymethyllysine and advanced glycation endproducts (AGEs) compared to this group of non-vegetarians. Carboxymethyllysine is a glycation product which represents [...] "a general marker of oxidative stress and long-term damage of proteins in aging, atherosclerosis and diabetes" [...] and [...] "dvanced glycation end products (AGEs) may play an important adverse role in process of atherosclerosis, diabetes, aging and chronic renal failure".|$|E
2500|$|If we {{evaluate}} the molecular revolution {{within the context}} of biological history, it is easy to note that it is the culmination of a long process which began with the first observations through a microscope. The aim of these early researchers was to understand the functioning of living organisms by describing their organization at the microscopic level. From the end of the 18th century, the characterization of the chemical molecules which make up living beings gained increasingly greater attention, along with the birth of <b>physiological</b> <b>chemistry</b> in the 19th century, developed by the German chemist Justus von Liebig and following the birth of biochemistry {{at the beginning of the}} 20th, thanks to another German chemist Eduard Buchner. Between the molecules studied by chemists and the tiny structures visible under the optical microscope, such as the cellular nucleus or the chromosomes, there was an obscure zone, [...] "the world of the ignored dimensions," [...] as it was called by the chemical-physicist Wolfgang Ostwald. This world is populated by colloids, chemical compounds whose structure and properties were not well defined.|$|E

We also discuss the reducing equivalent flow during photoautotrophic and photoheterotrophic growth, evolutionary links in the central carbon metabolic network, and correlations between photosynthetic and non-photosynthetic organisms.

60|$|The second wish I have {{to express}} {{concerns}} London especially, and I may {{speak of it}} briefly as a more economical use of the teaching power in the medical schools. At this present time every great hospital in London--and there are ten or eleven of them--has its complete medical school, in which {{not only are the}} branches of practical medicine taught, but also those studies in general science, such as chemistry, elementary physics, general anatomy, {{and a variety of other}} topics which are what used to be called (and the term was an extremely useful one) the institutes of medicine. That was all very well half a century ago; it is all very ill now, simply because those general branches of science, such as anatomy, physiology, chemistry, <b>physiological</b> <b>chemistry,</b> physiological physics, and so forth, have now become so large, and the mode of teaching them is so completely altered, that it is absolutely impossible for any man to be a thoroughly competent teacher of them, or for any student to be effectually taught without the devotion of the whole time of the person who is engaged in teaching. I undertake to say that it is hopelessly impossible for any man at the present time to keep abreast with the progress of physiology unless he gives his whole mind to it; and the bigger the mind is, the more scope he will find for its employment. Again, teaching has become, and must become still more, practical, and that also involves a large expenditure of time. But if a man is to give his whole time to my business he must live by it, and the resources of the schools do not permit them to maintain ten or eleven physiological specialists.|$|E

40|$|Bedside {{monitoring}} of cerebral metabolism in {{traumatic brain injury}} (TBI) with microdialysis is gaining wider clinical acceptance. The objective {{of this study was}} to examine the relationship between the fundamental physiological neuromonitoring modalities intracranial pressure (ICP), cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP), brain tissue oxygen (PbtO 2), and cerebrovascular pressure reactivity index (PRx), and cerebral chemistry assessed with microdialysis, with particular focus on the lactate/pyruvate (LP) ratio as a marker of energy metabolism. Prospectively collected observational neuromonitoring data from 97 patients with TBI, requiring neurointensive care management and invasive cerebral monitoring, were analyzed. A linear mixed model analysis was used to account for individual patient differences. Perilesional tissue chemistry exhibited a significant independent relationship with ICP, PbtO 2 and CPP thresholds, with increasing LP ratio in response to decrease in PbtO 2 and CPP, and increase in ICP. The relationship between CPP and chemistry depended upon the state of PRx. Within the studied <b>physiological</b> range, tissue <b>chemistry</b> only changed in response to increasing ICP or drop in PbtO 2 < 1. 33 kPa (10 mmHg).

40|$|Dynamic {{covalent}} chemistry (DCC) {{is currently}} exploited {{in several areas}} of biomedical applications such as in drug discovery, sensing, molecular separation, catalysis etc. Hydrazone and oxime chemistry have several advantages, such as mild reaction conditions, selectivity, efficiency, and biocompatibility and therefore, {{have the potential to}} be for bioconjugation applications. However, these reactions suffer from major drawbacks of slow reaction rate and poor bond stability under physiological conditions. In this regard, the work presented in this thesis focuses on designing novel bioconjugation reactions amenable under physiological conditions with tunable reaction kinetics and conjugation stability. The first part of the thesis presents different strategies of dynamic covalent reactions utilized for biomedical applications. In the next part, a detailed study related to the mechanism and catalysis of oxime chemistry was investigated in the presence of various catalysts. Aniline, carboxylate and saline were selective as target catalysts and their reaction kinetics were compared under physiological conditions (Paper I and II). Then we attempted to explore the potential of those chemistries in fabricating 3 D hydrogel scaffolds for regenerative medicine application. A novel mild and regioselective method was devised to introduce an aldehyde moiety onto glycosaminoglycans structure. This involved the introduction of amino glycerol to glycosaminoglycans, followed by regioselective oxidation of tailed flexible diol without affecting the C 2 -C 3 diol groups on the disaccharide repeating unit. The oxidation rate of the tailed flexible diol was 4 -times faster than that of C 2 -C 3 diol groups of native glycosaminoglycan. This strategy preserves the structural integrity of the glycosaminoglycans and provides a functional aldehyde moiety (Paper III). Further, different types of hydrazones were designed and their hydrolytic stability under acidic condition was carefully evaluated. The hydrazone linkage with the highest hydrolytic stability was utilized in the preparation of extracellular matrix hydrogel for delivery of bone morphogenetic proteins 2 in bone regeneration (Paper IV) and studied for controlled release of the growth factor (Paper III). In summary, this thesis presents a selection of strategies for designing bioconjugation chemistries that possess tunable stability and reaction kinetics under <b>physiological</b> conditions. These <b>chemistries</b> are powerful tools for conjugation of biomolecules for the biomedical applications...|$|R
