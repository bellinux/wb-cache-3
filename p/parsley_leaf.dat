This study was conducted to determine the effect of postharvest replacement of water by submerging the <b>parsley</b> <b>leaf</b> bunches in water for 3, 6 or 9 hours at three stages: when total weight loss reached 5 and 10 % and immediately after two hours of storage. Leaves were stored at 5 or 25 ºC until visible wilting or yellowing was detected. Results demonstrated that water replacement resulted in gains in fresh mass, resulting in longer shelf life for leaves stored at 5 and 25 ºC. In general, longer recharging resulted in greater water uptake by the leaves, but at a lower rate. By recharging the leaves with water, lower rates of mass loss were observed compared to untreated leaf bunches. Regardless the storage temperature, the relative water content of leaves decreased during shelf life, which in general was less accentuated for leaves submerged in water for 6 and 9 hours. Postharvest water replacement should be considered as an option to extend the shelf life of horticultural products that are susceptible to intense moisture loss. 200...|$|E

40|$|Parsley (Petroselinum crispum) {{plants and}} suspension-cultured cells {{have been used}} {{extensively}} for studies of non-host-resistance mechanisms in plant/pathogen interactions. We now show that treatment of cultured parsley cells with a defined peptide elicitor of fungal origin causes rapid and large changes in the levels of various unsaturated fatty acids. While linoleic acid decreased and linolenic acid increased steadily for several hours, comparatively sharp increases in oleic acid followed a biphasic time course. In contrast, the overall level of stearic acid remained unaffected. Using a PCR-based approach, a parsley cDNA was isolated sharing high sequence similarity with ω- 3 fatty acid desaturases. Subsequent isolation and characterization of a full-length cDNA enabled its functional identification as a plastid-localized ω- 3 fatty acid desaturase by complementation of the Arabidopsis thaliana fad 7 / 8 double mutant which is low in trienoic fatty acids. ω- 3 Fatty acid desaturase mRNA accumulated rapidly and transiently in elicitor-treated cultured parsley cells, protoplasts, and leaves, as well as highly localized around fungal infection sites in <b>parsley</b> <b>leaf</b> buds.

The sampling was performed during 3 months, from September to October, 2008. The collected 180 samples of vegetables, water, soil, after preparation by atomic absorption Spectrophotometers, were analyzed according to standard methods. Results: Mean concentration values of lead, cadmium, chromium, arsenic and zinc in vegetable samples were, respectively 23. 99, 2. 09, 5. 4, 5. 26, 168. 4 micrograms per gram of plant tissue. Mean concentrations of heavy metals in water were, respectively, 7. 55, 4. 85, 0. 78, 12. 83 and 347. 99 mg per liter in water samples. Mean concentrations of heavy metals in soil were, respectively, 81. 12, 14. 43, 134. 32, 19. 08 and 435 micrograms, per gram of soil sample. Comparing the mean concentration values for heavy metals available in vegetables, water and soil with standard values, significant differences are observed except for Zn.

In former times taxonomical determination was based only on morphological characters. Nowadays, new molecular and chemical methods and techniques are available for providing additional information. As examples of the interaction of morphological, molecular and phytochemical data, investigations of a parsley (Petroselinum crispum [Mill. ] Nyman, Apiaceae) and an opium poppy (Papaver somniferum L., Papaveraceae) collection of the German genebank are demonstrated. 220 parsley and 300 opium poppy accessions were cultivated and described morphologically.

40|$|Western water hemlock is a {{perennial}} {{plant in the}} parsley and carrot family that grows in wet areas of meadows, pastures, and streams. It has small white flowers that grow in umbrella-like clusters which each produce two seeds. The brown kidney-shaped seeds develop late in June and are dispersed mostly by wind and water. The compound leaves are; alternate, have jagged edges, and are about two inches long and 3 / 4 inch wide. It is distinguished from water <b>parsley</b> by the <b>leaf</b> veins- water hemlock’s leaf veins go from the mid-rib {{to the base of}} the notches on the leaf margin. In Thurston County, water hemlock grows about three feet tall. Western water hemlock has a bulb-like rootstalk that contains several hollow chambers and produces a highly poisonous oil (cicutoxin) that has a strong carrot odor. When the rootstalk is broken, the oil is exposed to air and turns bright yellow-orange. Off the rootstalk grows thick root tubers and other slender, hairy roots. Impacts: Water hemlock is the most toxic plant native to North America. Only a small amount of the toxic oil from the plant is needed to produce poisoning in livestock or humans. The roots are the most toxic part, but the green seed heads are also highly poisonous. The leaves and stems are poisonous in the early stages of growth, but lose much of their toxicity when mature. (Cicuta douglasii) Livestock usually show signs of poisoning fifteen minutes to six hours after they eat the plant. Symptoms include: muscle twitch, rapid pulse, rapid breathing, tremors, convulsions, excessive salivation or frothing at the mouth, and dilation of the pupils.

Culinary herbs, and their polyphenolie constituents, have been shown to inhibit COX- 2 expression and inhibit the growth of cancer cells. However, few studies have investigated their effect onCRC cells. Thus the aim of this study was to investigate whether culinary herbs inhibit the growth of human CRC cells in vitro, and to determine the role of COX- 2 expression and the Wnt /[beta]-catenin signalling pathway in this action. Aqueous and ethanol extracts of the culinary herbs bay <b>leaf,</b> <b>parsley,</b> rosemary sage and thyme were tested on CRC cell lines HT 29 (COX- 2 positive) and HCT 116 (COX- 2 negative). Growth inhibition studies revealed that with the exception of aqueous extracts of parsley all the other herb extracts inhibited the growth of HCT 116 and HT 29 cells in vitro. The IC 50 s varied based on the type of extract and cell type, suggesting that polyphenol composition within the extracts and cell type influenced the potency of the herbs. Western blotting showed that some herb extracts down-regulated COX- 2 and unphosphorylated [beta]-catenin expression in the HT 29 cell line, however, due to the poor quality of some of the blots, a more complete establishment of this effect was not possible. In conclusion, culinary herbs inhibit the growth of CRC cells in vitro however whether such an effect occurs in vivo requires further investigation. Some culinary herb extracts down-regulated COX- 2 and unphosphorylated [beta]-catenin in HT 29 cells, however, future studies are needed to confirm whether culinary herbs, and their constituent polyphenols, indeed modulate these two molecular targets as part of the prevention and/or treatment of CRC...|$|R
