5|$|Despite the {{inherent}} difficulties in accounting for inflation, several {{attempts have been}} made. Estimates depend on the <b>price</b> <b>index</b> used to adjust the grosses, and the exchange rates used to convert between currencies can also impact upon the calculations, both of which can {{have an effect on}} the ultimate rankings of an inflation adjusted list. Gone with the Wind—first released in 1939—is generally considered to be the most successful film, with Guinness World Records in 2014 estimating its adjusted global gross at $3.4 billion. Estimates for Gone with the Winds adjusted gross have varied substantially: its owner, Turner Entertainment, estimated its adjusted earnings at $3.3 billion in 2007, a few years earlier than the Guinness estimate; other estimates fall either side of this amount, with one putting its gross just under $3 billion in 2010, while another provided an alternative figure of $3.8 billion in 2006. Which film is Gone with the Winds nearest rival depends on the set of figures used: Guinness had Avatar in second place with $3 billion, while other estimates saw Titanic in the runner-up spot with first-run worldwide earnings of almost $2.9 billion at 2010 prices. The only other film that all sources agreed grossed in excess of $2 billion at recent prices is Star Wars; according to Guinness it has earned $2.8 billion at 2014 price levels, while other sources from 2010/2011 put its adjusted earnings at $2.2–2.6 billion.|$|E

5|$|On 19 March 1662, Abraham Shipman was {{appointed}} the first Governor and General of the city, and his fleet arrived in Bombay in September and October 1662. On {{being asked to}} hand over Bombay and Salsette to the English, the Portuguese Governor contended that the island of Bombay alone had been ceded, and alleging irregularity in the patent, he {{refused to give up}} even Bombay. The Portuguese Viceroy declined to interfere and Shipman was prevented from landing in Bombay. He was forced to retire to the island of Anjediva in North Canara and died there in October 1664. In November 1664, Shipman's successor Humphrey Cooke agreed to accept Bombay without its dependencies. However, Salsette, Mazagaon, Parel, Worli, Sion, Dharavi, and Wadala still remained under Portuguese possession. Later, Cooke managed to acquire Mahim, Sion, Dharavi, and Wadala for the English. On 21 September 1668, the Royal Charter of 27 March 1668, led to the transfer of Bombay from Charles II to the English East India Company for an annual rent of £10 (equivalent retail <b>price</b> <b>index</b> of £1,226 in 2007). The Company immediately set about the task of opening up the islands by constructing a quay and warehouses. A customs house was also built. Fortifications were built around Bombay Castle. A Judge-Advocate {{was appointed}} for the purpose of civil administration. George Oxenden became the first Governor of Bombay under the English East India Company on 23 September 1668. Gerald Aungier, who was appointed Governor of Bombay in July 1669, established the first mint in Bombay in 1670. He offered various business incentives, which attracted Parsis, Goans, Jews, Dawoodi Bohras, Gujarati Banias from Surat and Diu, and Brahmins from Salsette. He also planned extensive fortifications in the city from Dongri in the north to Mendham's Point (near present-day Lion Gate) in the south. The harbour was also developed during his governorship, with space for the berthing of 20 ships. In 1670, the Parsi businessman Bhimjee Parikh imported the first printing press into Bombay. Between 1661 and 1675 there was a sixfold increase in population from 10,000 to 60,000. Yakut Khan, the Siddi admiral of the Mughal Empire, landed at Bombay in October 1672 and ravaged the local inhabitants there. On 20 February 1673, Rickloffe van Goen, the Governor-General of Dutch India attacked Bombay, but the attack was resisted by Aungier. On 10 October 1673, the Siddi admiral Sambal entered Bombay and destroyed the Pen and Nagothana rivers, which were very important for the English and the Maratha King Shivaji. The Treaty of Westminster concluded between England and the Netherlands in 1674, relieved the British settlements in Bombay of further apprehension from the Dutch. In 1686, the Company shifted its main holdings from Surat to Bombay, which had become the administrative centre of all the west coast settlements then. Bombay was placed at the head of all the Company's establishments in India.|$|E

40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{investigate}} and compare the weak-form efficiency of a set of 24 African continent-wide stock <b>price</b> <b>indices</b> and those of eight individual African national stock <b>price</b> <b>indices.</b> Design/methodology/approach – Variance-ratio tests based on ranks and signs were used to examine the weak-form efficiency of the 32 stock <b>price</b> <b>indices</b> investigated. Findings – On average, it was found that irrespective of the test employed, the returns of all the 24 African continent-wide stock <b>price</b> <b>indices</b> examined in the study are less non-normally distributed compared to the eight individual national stock <b>price</b> <b>indices</b> examined. The authors also report evidence of the African continent-wide stock <b>price</b> <b>indices</b> having significantly better weak-form informational efficiency than their national counterparts. Practical implications – The policy implication of this evidence is that the African equity price discovery process can be significantly improved if African stock markets integrate their operations. Economically, this may contribute to improved liquidity and more efficient allocation of capital, which in turn can be expected to have a positive impact on economic growth. Originality/value – The paper makes two major contributions to the extant literature. First, it offers for the first time a comparative analysis of the informational efficiencies of a sample of national stock <b>price</b> <b>indices</b> as against African continent-wide stock <b>price</b> <b>indices.</b> Second, there is no prior evidence as to whether African stock markets can improve their informational efficiencies by integrating their operations.
