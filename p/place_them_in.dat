5|$|Meanwhile, in Italy {{a number}} of banks in Florence {{collapsed}} due to internal problems in Florence, contributed by King Edward III of England defaulting on some of his loans. Most notably, the Bardi family went bankrupt in this year. Italy also suffered a famine, {{making it difficult for}} the Papacy to recruit troops for the attack on Smyrna. The Venetians, however, organized an alliance uniting several European parties (Sancta Unio), composed notably of the Knights Hospitaller, which carried out five consecutive attacks on İzmir and the Western Anatolian coastline controlled by Turkish states. In the realm of technology, papermaking reached Holland, and firearms made their way to Northern Germany in this year.

5|$|The Motmot Capstone is an inscribed {{stone that}} was placed over a tomb under Structure 10L-26. Its face was finely sculpted with {{portraits of the}} first two kings of the Copán dynasty, K'inich Yax K'uk' Mo' and K'inich Popol Hol, facing towards each other with a double column of hieroglyphs between them, all {{contained}} within a quatrefoil frame. The frame and the hieroglyphic names of mythological locations underneath the feet of the two kings <b>place</b> <b>them</b> <b>in</b> a supernatural realm. The capstone bears two calendrical dates, in AD435 and AD441. The second of these is probably the date that the capstone was dedicated.|$|E
5|$|The program {{expanded}} the usual {{conventions of the}} genre by using several types of metafiction, referencing the actors themselves or {{the nature of the}} program. An example within the plot is Sos mi muqui, a program within the program whose characters were based on the show's main characters. The actors' former characters are occasionally referenced in plots that <b>place</b> <b>them</b> <b>in</b> similar contexts than those of older fictions. Martín infiltrated a convent using a habit similar to the one Arana's character in Padre Coraje wore, and Esperanza wore clothes similar to those Oreiro's character in Muñeca Brava wore when they had to get into a slum.|$|E
5|$|The taxonomic {{placement}} of the turkey vulture and the remaining six species of New World vultures has been in flux.

5|$|Wasps in {{the genus}} Sphecius are not habitually {{aggressive}} {{and use their}} venom mainly to paralyse cicadas which they take back to their nests to feed their young. The females catch around four or more cicadas for provisioning, <b>place</b> <b>them</b> <b>in</b> brood cells and lay eggs in the cells. S.grandis is endemic to Central America, Mexico and the Western United States, and is found at a higher mean altitude than other species of Sphecius. The western cicada killer males emerge earlier than females, but generally die after {{only a couple of}} days.|$|E
5|$|Sphecius grandis {{has very}} similar nesting and feeding habits to {{other members of}} its genus, most notably Sphecius speciosus. As with S.speciosus, the female hunts for cicadas in low tree trunks, helped by the calls of the cicada males, and paralyses the insect by {{piercing}} {{the central nervous system}} with her stinger. She drags the cicadas back to her nest to <b>place</b> <b>them</b> <b>in</b> brood cells in which she eventually lays one egg per cell. Females carry cicadas that are on average 88% heavier than their own body mass. It has been hypothesised that cicada killers may also have the ability to capture cicadas mid-flight. There are approximately two or more cicadas to each brood cell. When the larvae hatch, the cicada provides nutrition for the offspring to feed on.|$|E
5|$|The exact {{systematic}} {{placement of}} the king vulture and the remaining six species of New World vultures remains unclear.

50|$|Peloridiidae are {{the only}} extant family in the {{suborder}} Coleorrhyncha. Historically the Peloridiidae and their fossil kin were assigned {{to a variety of}} orders.

This was followed by Bourgoin in 1997 who placed the Peloridiidae in Fulgoromorpha. However, following Bekker-Migdisova's 1952 suggestion, and Popov and Wootton's 1977 review, there is consensus that the Peloridiidae belong in Coleorrhyncha and that Coleorrhyncha is a sister group to the Heteroptera.
