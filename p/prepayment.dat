5|$|Sales {{and profits}} grew {{year-on-year}} {{during the early}} 1950s. The <b>prepayment</b> from the government was repaid in 1952. For a short time, VAT imported and marketed clearing tractors produced by Italian firm Ansaldo-Fossati. Although there was demand {{for this type of}} vehicle, they sold poorly because their price was considered inconsistent with their technical quality; only a few units were delivered in 1953.|$|E
5|$|After the {{original}} {{contract with the}} state was terminated, a new agreement {{for the production of}} 650 vehicles to be delivered between 1948 and 1952 was reached. The state helped production with a significant <b>prepayment</b> of 132 million marks. According to the contract, 150 vehicles were scheduled to be built in 1948. The company reached this target and made a further 11 vehicles for private use. 92 were sold under the name of Sisu S-22 or S-22K and 69 were badged as Vanaja V-48. 101 M2 Half-Tracks were sold. In 1948, VAT made a loss of 746,000 marks. In 1949, VAT made another 150 vehicles for the state and 37 vehicles for private operators; it produced 163 V-48s and 24 VaWhs. The company also sold 211 M2 Half-Tracks, allowing it to declare its first profit of 1.208 million marks, which was helped by a devaluation of the Finnish mark.|$|E
50|$|In {{the first}} case, {{membership}} {{to the community}} is registered onto a taxation document (Lohnsteuerkarte). The member's employer must then withhold church tax <b>prepayments</b> from the income of the employee {{in addition to the}} <b>prepayments</b> on the annual income tax. In connection with the final annual income tax assessment, the state revenue authorities also finally assess the church tax owed. In case of self-employed persons or other tax payers not employed, state revenue authorities collect <b>prepayments</b> on the church tax together with <b>prepayments</b> on the income tax.|$|R
50|$|NAS {{bonds are}} {{designed}} to protect investors from volatility and negative convexity resulting from <b>prepayments.</b> NAS tranches of bonds are fully protected from <b>prepayments</b> for a specified period, after which time <b>prepayments</b> are allocated to the tranche using a specified step down formula. For example, an NAS bond might be protected from <b>prepayments</b> for five years, and then would receive 10% of the <b>prepayments</b> for the first month, then 20%, and so on. Recently, issuers have added features to accelerate the proportion of <b>prepayments</b> flowing to the NAS class of bond {{in order to create}} shorter bonds and reduce extension risk. NAS tranches are usually found in deals that also contain short sequentials, Z-bonds, and credit subordination.A NAS tranche receives principal payments according to a schedule which shows for a given month the share of pro rata principal that must be distributed to the NAS tranche.|$|R
50|$|Applying {{the test}} above, the Grynberg court {{concluded}} that the <b>prepayments</b> satisfied the first prong. The <b>prepayments</b> were not mere deposits but irretrievable payments. However, the court found no valid business reason for making the payments in December rather than the following February or March when the payments were actually due. Because taxpayers failed the second prong of the test, {{the court did not}} apply the third requirement to the facts of the case. Because the <b>prepayments</b> were not necessary and ordinary business expenses for the year in which they were paid, the <b>prepayments</b> were not deductible.|$|R
25|$|Unlike {{corporate}} bonds, most securitizations are amortized, {{meaning that}} the principal amount borrowed is paid back gradually over the specified term of the loan, rather than in one lump sum at the maturity of the loan. Fully amortizing securitizations are generally collateralised by fully amortizing assets, such as home equity loans, auto loans, and student loans. <b>Prepayment</b> uncertainty is an important concern with fully amortizing ABS. The possible rate of <b>prepayment</b> varies widely {{with the type of}} underlying asset pool, so many <b>prepayment</b> models have been developed to try to define common <b>prepayment</b> activity. The PSA <b>prepayment</b> model is a well-known example.|$|E

25|$|The {{price of}} an MBS pool is {{influenced}} by <b>prepayment</b> speed, usually measured in units of CPR or PSA. When a mortgage refinances or the borrower prepays during the month, the <b>prepayment</b> measurement increases.|$|E
40|$|This paper does a {{valuation}} {{analysis of}} senior-subordinated structure tranches backed by non-agency mortgages. The valuation is done using Monte Carlo simulation and employs the CIR interest rate process {{in conjunction with}} an empirical model estimated for non-agency mortgage <b>prepayments</b> and defaults. The sensitivity {{of the value of}} tranches to a number of variables are analyzed. We find that the interest rate process parameters significantly affect <b>prepayments</b> and defaults but not the relative value of the senior tranche. It is found that with the shifting of <b>prepayments,</b> the senior trances does not dominated all the junior tranches at all interest rates. The shifting of <b>prepayments</b> has the unintended effect of providing stability to the junior tranches by making their cashflows less sensitive to <b>prepayments.</b> Our main conclusion is that while the shifting of <b>prepayments</b> increases protection from default to the senior tranche for a given level of subordination, it has the unwanted effect of lowering its value through increased contraction risk. The value loss should be taken into account in determining the optimum level of subordination. ...|$|R
50|$|In {{the first}} case, {{membership}} in the religious community is stored in a database at the Federal Tax Office which employers receive excerpts of {{for the purpose of}} withholding tax on paid income. If an employee's data indicate membership in a tax-collecting religious community, the employer must withhold church tax <b>prepayments</b> from their income in addition to other tax <b>prepayments.</b> In connection with the final annual income tax assessment, the state revenue authorities also finally assess the church tax owed. In the case of self-employed persons or of unemployed taxpayers, state revenue authorities collect <b>prepayments</b> on the church tax together with <b>prepayments</b> on the income tax.|$|R
50|$|This type of {{tranching}} has a bond (often {{called a}} PAC or TAC bond) which has even less uncertainty than a sequential bond by receiving <b>prepayments</b> {{according to a}} defined schedule. The schedule is maintained by using support bonds (also called companion bonds) that absorb the excess <b>prepayments.</b>|$|R
25|$|These {{securitization}} trusts may {{be structured}} by government-sponsored enterprises {{as well as}} by private entities that may offer credit enhancement features to mitigate the risk of <b>prepayment</b> and default associated with these mortgages. Since residential mortgage holders in the United States have the option to pay more than the required monthly payment (curtailment) or to pay off the loan in its entirety (<b>prepayment),</b> the monthly cash flow of an MBS is not known in advance, and an MBS therefore presents a risk to investors.|$|E

50|$|Very {{accurately}} defined maturity (VADM) {{bonds are}} similar to PAC bonds in that they protect against both extension and contraction risk, but their payments are supported in a different way. Instead of a support bond, they are supported by accretion of a Z bond. Because of this, a VADM tranche will receive the scheduled <b>prepayments</b> even if no <b>prepayments</b> are made on the underlying.|$|R

50|$|Within the IAG, {{each member}} agency {{has its own}} billing and {{customer}} service center, and each establishes its own fee and discount structures. The agencies also set their own customer account policies. Areas of variation include the refundable deposit or nonrefundable charge for a tag, periodic maintenance fees, paper statement fees, the low account threshold, and replenishment amounts. E‑ZPass is usually offered as a debit account: tolls are deducted from <b>prepayments</b> made by the users. Users may opt to have <b>prepayments</b> automatically deposited when their account is low, or they may submit <b>prepayments</b> manually, either by phone or a toll authority's web portal, depending on the agency. For commercial accounts, some agencies allow postpaid plans with a security deposit (which effectively renders them prepaid accounts, with a different replenishment policy).|$|R

50|$|Similarly, cash {{paid out}} for (the cost of) goods and {{services}} not received {{by the end of}} the accounting period is added to the <b>prepayments</b> to prevent it from turning into a fictitious loss in the period cash was paid out, and into a fictitious profit in the period of their reception. Such cost is not recognized in the income statement (profit and loss or P&L) as the expense incurred in the period of payment, but in the period of their reception when such costs are recognized as expenses in P&L and deducted from <b>prepayments</b> (assets) on balance sheets.|$|R
25|$|The FDIC {{announced}} its intent, on September 29, 2009, {{to assess the}} banks, in advance, for three years' of premiums {{in an effort to}} avoid DIF insolvency. The FDIC revised its estimated costs of bank failures to about $100 billion over the next four years, an increase of $30 billion from the $70 billion estimate of earlier in 2009. The FDIC board voted to require insured banks to prepay $45 billion in premiums to replenish the fund. News media reported that the <b>prepayment</b> move would be inadequate to assure the financial stability of the FDIC insurance fund. The FDIC elected to request the <b>prepayment</b> so that the banks could recognize the expense over three years, instead of drawing down banks' statutory capital abruptly, {{at the time of the}} assessment.|$|E

5000|$|A {{group of}} {{mortgages}} could be split into principal-only and interest-only bonds. The [...] "principal-only" [...] bonds would sell at a discount, and would thus be zero coupon bonds (e.g., bonds that you buy for $800 each and which mature at $1,000, without paying any cash interest). These bonds would satisfy investors who {{are worried that}} mortgage <b>prepayments</b> would force them to re-invest their money at the exact moment interest rates are lower; countering this, principal only investors in such a scenario would also be getting their money earlier rather than later, which equates to a higher return on their zero-coupon investment. The [...] "interest-only" [...] bonds would include only the interest payments of the underlying pool of loans. These kinds of bonds would dramatically change in value based on interest rate movements, e.g., <b>prepayments</b> mean less interest payments, but higher interest rates and lower <b>prepayments</b> means these bonds pay more, and for a longer time. These characteristics allow investors to choose between interest-only (IO) or principal-only (PO) bonds to better manage their sensitivity to interest rates, {{and can be used}} to manage and offset the interest rate-related price changes in other investments.|$|R
