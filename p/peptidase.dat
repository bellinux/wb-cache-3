40|$|A collagen-degrading thermophile, Geobacillus collagenovorans MO- 1, {{was found}} to produce two metallopeptidases that hydrolyze the {{synthetic}} substrate 4 -phenylazobenzyloxycarbonyl-Pro-Leu-Gly-Pro-d-Arg (Pz-PLGPR), containing the collagen-specific sequence -Gly-Pro-X-. The <b>peptidases,</b> named Pz <b>peptidases</b> A and B, were purified to homogeneity and confirmed to hydrolyze collagen-derived oligopeptides but not collagen itself, indicating that Pz <b>peptidases</b> A and B contribute to collagen degradation in collaboration with a collagenolytic protease in G. collagenovorans MO- 1. There were many similarities between Pz <b>peptidases</b> A and B in their catalytic properties; however, they had different molecular masses and shared no antigenic groups against the respective antibodies. Their primary structures clarified from the cloned genes showed lower identity (22 %). From homology analysis for proteolytic enzymes in the database, the two Pz <b>peptidases</b> belong to the M 3 B family. In addition, Pz <b>peptidases</b> A and B shared high identities of over 70 % with unassigned <b>peptidases</b> and oligopeptidase F-like <b>peptidases</b> of the M 3 B family, respectively. Those homologue proteins are putative in the genome database but form two distinct segments, including Pz <b>peptidases</b> A and B, in the phylogenic tree. Mammalian thimet oligopeptidases, which were previously thought to participate in collagen degradation and share catalytic identities with Pz <b>peptidases,</b> {{were found to have}} lower identities in the overall primary sequence with Pz <b>peptidases</b> A and B but a significant resemblance {{in the vicinity of the}} catalytic site...|$|R

25|$|A seventh {{catalytic}} type of proteolytic enzymes, asparagine peptide lyase, {{was described}} in 2011. Its proteolytic mechanism is unusual since, rather than hydrolysis, it performs an elimination reaction. During this reaction, the catalytic asparagine forms a cyclic chemical structure that cleaves itself at asparagine residues in proteins under the right conditions. Given its fundamentally different mechanism, its inclusion as a <b>peptidase</b> may be debatable.|$|E
25|$|Prostate-specific antigen (PSA), {{also known}} as gamma-seminoprotein or kallikrein-3 (KLK3), is a {{glycoprotein}} enzyme encoded in humans by the KLK3 gene. PSA {{is a member of}} the kallikrein-related <b>peptidase</b> family and is secreted by the epithelial cells of the prostate gland. PSA is produced for the ejaculate, where it liquefies semen in the seminal coagulum and allows sperm to swim freely. It is also believed to be instrumental in dissolving cervical mucus, allowing the entry of sperm into the uterus.|$|E

40|$|To gain a {{detailed}} {{understanding of the}} function of <b>peptidases</b> of Lactococcus lactis in growth in milk a set of 16 mutants was constructed lacking one or combinations of the following peptidases: PepO, PepN, PepC, PepT, PepXP. Growth experiments in milk showed {{that most of the}} mutants have a decreased growth rate, the general trend being that the more <b>peptidases</b> are inactivated the slower the mutant grows. A mutant lacking all five <b>peptidases</b> grows more than 10 times slower than the wild type. The activities of the cell envelope-associated proteinase (PrtP), of the oligopeptide transport system (Opp) and of <b>peptidases</b> still present in a mutant, were not influenced by its lack of certain <b>peptidases</b> or its decreased growth rate. Therefore the slow growth phenotype was directly caused by the absence of the <b>peptidases</b> and the consequent decreased capacity to release amino acids needed for growth. Furthermore, peptide catabolism was investigated in vivo using a chemically defined medium and a variety of peptides. The study presented shows {{for the first time that}} in milk at least PepO, PepN, PepC and PepT are directly involved in the release of amino acids needed for growth. ...|$|R

25|$|SHH {{undergoes}} {{a series of}} processing steps before it is secreted from the cell. Newly synthesised SHH weighs 45kDa and {{is referred to as}} the preproprotein. As a secreted protein it contains a short signal sequence at its N-terminus, which is recognised by the signal recognition particle during the translocation into the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), the first step in protein secretion. Once translocation is complete, the signal sequence is removed by signal <b>peptidase</b> in the ER. There SHH {{undergoes a}}utoprocessing to generate a 20kDa N-terminal signaling domain (SHH-N) and a 25kDa C-terminal domain with no known signaling role. The cleavage is catalysed by a protease within the C-terminal domain. During the reaction, a cholesterol molecule is added to the N-terminus of SHH-N. Thus the C-terminal domain acts as an intein and a cholesterol transferase. Another hydrophobic moiety, a palmitate, is added to the alpha-amine of N-terminal cysteine of SHH-N. This modification is required for efficient signaling, resulting in a 30-fold increase in potency over the non-palmitylated form, and is carried out by a member of the membrane-bound O-acyltransferase family, Protein-cysteine N-palmitoyltransferase, HHAT.|$|E
25|$|The {{physiological}} function of KLK3 is {{the dissolution of}} the coagulum, the sperm entrapping gel composed of semenogelins and fibronectin. Its proteolytic action is effective in liquefying the coagulum so that the sperm can be liberated. The activity of PSA is well regulated. In the prostate it is present as an inactive pro-form which is activated through the action of KLK2, another kallikrein-related <b>peptidase.</b> In the prostate, zinc ion concentrations are ten times higher than in other bodily fluids. Zinc ions have a strong inhibitory effect on the activity of PSA and on that of KLK2, so that PSA is totally inactive. Further regulation is achieved through pH variations. Although its activity is increased by higher pH, the inhibitory effect of zinc also increases. The pH of semen is slightly alkaline and the concentrations of zinc are high. On ejaculation, semen is exposed to the acidic pH of the vagina, due to the presence of lactic acid. In fertile couples, the final vaginal pH after coitus approaches the 6-7 levels, which coincides well with reduced zinc inhibition of PSA. At these pH levels, the reduced PSA activity is countered by a decrease in zinc inhibition. Thus, the coagulum is slowly liquefied, releasing the sperm in a well regulated manner.|$|E

Anchor and α-MoRF-Pred use physicochemical properties to search for motif-like peptides in disordered regions (termed MoRFs, among others). ANCHOR identifies stretches of intrinsically disordered regions that cannot form favorable intrachain interactions to fold without additional stabilising energy contributed by a globular interaction partner. α-MoRF-Pred uses the inherent propensity of many SLiM to undergo a disorder to order transition upon binding to discover α-helical forming stretches within disordered regions.|$|E

2500|$|The {{surface of}} the rough {{endoplasmic}} reticulum (often abbreviated RER or Rough ER) (also called granular endoplasmic reticulum) is studded with protein-manufacturing ribosomes giving it a [...] "rough" [...] appearance (hence its name). The binding site of the ribosome on the rough endoplasmic reticulum is the translocon. However, the ribosomes are not a stable part of this organelle's structure as they are constantly being bound and released from the membrane. A ribosome only binds to the RER once a specific protein-nucleic acid complex forms in the cytosol. [...] This special complex forms when a free ribosome begins translating the mRNA of a protein destined for the secretory pathway. The first 5–30 amino acids polymerized encode a signal peptide, a molecular message that is recognized and bound by a signal recognition particle (SRP). Translation pauses and the ribosome complex binds to the RER translocon where translation continues with the nascent (new) protein forming into the RER lumen and/or membrane. The protein is processed in the ER lumen by an enzyme (a signal <b>peptidase),</b> which removes the signal peptide. Ribosomes at this point may be released back into the cytosol; however, non-translating ribosomes are also known to stay associated with translocons.|$|E

40|$|A {{synonym for}} a {{successful}} tumor spread is a productive invasive cell migration, a {{process by which the}} extracellular matrix plays the role of substrate for cells to move and reach a secondary site. <b>Peptidases</b> participate actively in this process to degrade the extracellular matrix. The activity of these enzymes is regulated by inhibitors, activators and receptors. However, cancer occurs in a breach of the balance of proteolytic-antiproteolytic activity. The <b>peptidases,</b> enzymes that hydrolyze peptide bonds of proteins, can act directly by degrading the components of the extracellular matrix or indirectly by activating other <b>peptidases,</b> in a process that may also generate bioactive fragments, interact with cell surface receptors, and be involved in the angiogenic process.
