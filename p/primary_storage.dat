5|$|Media Transfer Protocol (MTP) was {{designed}} by Microsoft to give higher-level access to a device's filesystem than USB mass storage, {{at the level of}} files rather than disk blocks. It also has optional DRM features. MTP {{was designed}} for use with portable media players, but it has since been adopted as the <b>primary</b> <b>storage</b> access protocol of the Android operating system from the version 4.1 Jelly Bean as well as Windows Phone 8 (Windows Phone 7 devices had used the Zune protocol which was an evolution of MTP). The primary {{reason for this is that}} MTP does not require exclusive access to the storage device the way UMS does, alleviating potential problems should an Android program request the storage while it is attached to a computer. The main drawback is that MTP is not as well supported outside of Windows operating systems.|$|E
5|$|The Nintendo DS (NDS) {{features}} a touch screen and built-in microphone, and supports wireless IEEE 802.11 (Wi-Fi) standards. Additionally, the {{revised version of}} the NDS, the Nintendo DSi, features two built in cameras, the ability to download games from the DSi store, and a web browser. The PlayStation Portable (PSP) released later the same year on December 12, 2004, followed a different pattern. It became the first handheld video game console to use an optical disc format, Universal Media Disc (UMD), as its <b>primary</b> <b>storage</b> media. Sony also gave the PSP robust multi-media capability, connectivity with the PlayStation 3, PlayStation 2 (only on some games), other PSPs, as well as Internet connectivity. The Nintendo DS likewise had connectivity to the internet through the Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection and Nintendo DS Browser, as well as wireless connectivity to other DS systems and Wii consoles. Despite high sales numbers for both consoles, PlayStation Portable sales have consistently lagged behind those of the Nintendo DS; nevertheless, the PlayStation Portable has {{the distinction of being}} the best-selling non-Nintendo handheld gaming system.|$|E

It was the last major home console to use the cartridge as its <b>primary</b> <b>storage</b> format until Nintendo's seventh console, the Nintendo Switch, released in 2017.

25|$|Until {{the launch}} of the Switch in 2017, the Nintendo 64 was the latest major home console to use the {{cartridge}} as its <b>primary</b> <b>storage</b> format, although most handheld systems (with the exception of the PlayStation Portable) continued to use cartridges. Most home systems began using disc, flash, and online formats. With the Nintendo GameCube, the company utilized the optical disc format instead of the cartridge format, in a boon to some developers. The company's stated goal was to reduce manufacturing costs; Nintendo did not cite storage space as a rationale. While the new console lacks backwards compatibility with Nintendo 64 Game Paks, Nintendo said players could simply keep their Nintendo 64.|$|E
25|$|The PlayStation Portable {{became the}} most {{powerful}} portable system when launched, just after the Nintendo DS in 2004. It was the first real competitor to Nintendo's handheld domination, where many challengers, such as SNK's Neo Geo Pocket and Nokia's N-Gage, failed. Its GPU encompassed high-end graphics on a handheld, while its 4.3 inch viewing screen and multi-media capabilities, such as its video player and TV tuner, made the PlayStation Portable a major mobile entertainment device at the time. It also features connectivity with the PlayStation 3, other PSPs and the Internet. It is the only handheld console to use an optical disc format, Universal Media Disc (UMD), as its <b>primary</b> <b>storage</b> medium.|$|E
25|$|Iron {{is stored}} in the liver, the {{pancreas}} and the heart. Long-term effects of haemochromatosis on these organs can be very serious, even fatal when untreated. For example, similar to alcoholism, haemochromatosis can cause cirrhosis of the liver. The liver is a <b>primary</b> <b>storage</b> area for iron and will naturally accumulate excess iron. Over time the liver {{is likely to be}} damaged by iron overload. Cirrhosis itself may lead to additional and more serious complications, including bleeding from dilated veins in the esophagus (esophageal varices) and stomach (gastric varices) and severe fluid retention in the abdomen (ascites). Toxins may accumulate in the blood and eventually affect mental functioning. This can lead to confusion or even coma (hepatic encephalopathy).|$|E

25|$|The first {{commercial}} computer was the Ferranti Mark 1, built by Ferranti and {{delivered to the}} University of Manchester in February 1951. It {{was based on the}} Manchester Mark 1. The main improvements over the Manchester Mark 1 were {{in the size of the}} <b>primary</b> <b>storage</b> (using random access Williams tubes), secondary storage (using a magnetic drum), a faster multiplier, and additional instructions. The basic cycle time was 1.2 milliseconds, and a multiplication could be completed in about 2.16 milliseconds. The multiplier used almost a quarter of the machine's 4,050 vacuum tubes (valves). A second machine was purchased by the University of Toronto, before the design was revised into the Mark 1 Star. At least seven of these later machines were delivered between 1953 and 1957, one of them to Shell labs in Amsterdam.|$|E
25|$|Water {{supply in}} the Bogotá metro area {{involves}} a system of watersheds that collect, store, and deliver water to the Bogotá River Basin. Watersheds upstream include Tibitoc with a total storage capacity of 887 Mn3, Chingaza with total storage capacity at 325 Mn3, and Tunjuelo with total storage capacity at 10.4 Mn3. Chingaza, which is Bogotá's primary source for drinking water receives its water from another watershed belonging to {{the inhabitants of the}} eastern Colombian plains. Waters from the eastern catchment are transferred to Chinzaga and then finally reach the Rio Bogotá as wastewater after passing through the Bogotá water system. Within these other water basins, there are approximately nine storage reservoirs that supply water by way of tunnel, aqueduct, or tributary to the main water system of Bogotá. <b>Primary</b> <b>storage</b> reservoirs include Chuza, Sisga, Tominé, and the Neusa.|$|E

The console was the first PlayStation to integrate social gaming services, including being the first to introduce Sony's social gaming service, PlayStation Network, and its remote connectivity with PlayStation Portable and PlayStation Vita, being able to remote control the console from the devices. In September 2009, the Slim model of the PlayStation 3 was released. It no longer provided the hardware ability to run PS2 games. It was lighter and thinner than the original version, and featured a redesigned logo and marketing design, as well as a minor start-up change in software. A Super Slim variation was then released in late 2012, further refining and redesigning the console.|$|E

The GameCube is the first Nintendo console to use optical discs as its <b>primary</b> <b>storage</b> medium. The discs {{are similar to the}} miniDVD format, but the system was not designed to play standard DVDs or audio CDs. Nintendo introduced a variety of connectivity options for the GameCube.

40|$|Research {{shows that}} {{flywheels}} {{have a significant}} potential for improving the performance of EV (Electric Vehicle) drivelines.

In this degree project a prototype of a flywheel-buffered driveline was constructed. The flywheel chosen was an electric motor/generator constructed at the Division of Electricity at Uppsala University. Lead acid batteries were used as the <b>primary</b> energy <b>storage</b> device in the driveline and the traction motor was a DC-motor. Two DC/DC buck converters were designed for the driveline. The first limited the current from the batteries to the flywheel and the second controlled the power from the flywheel to the traction motor. Both converters were controlled by microcontrollers. The current limiter was controlled by a hysteresis controller and the DC-motor power was regulated manually, under the constraint of a maximum current PI-controller. The buck circuits were simulated in MATLAB Simulink prior to their construction. The performance of the driveline was satisfactory, despite the poor efficiency of the DC-motor. The results showed that the efficiency of the flywheel and the power converters was relatively high and that the flywheel had excellent power-buffering properties...|$|R
