Debil Estar focuses on lyrical content rather than his trademark rapid phrase delivery. Fat Lui cemented his no-nonsense lyrical style with elegant lines that keep his verses varied.

In previous research, {{several studies have}} shown that the LFCM is advantageous to some of the models being investigated, however, Nembhard and Osothsilp (2001) found that the LFCM showed the largest deviation from empirical data. In this commentary, we demonstrate that the poor performance of the LFCM in the study of Nembhard and Osothsilp (2001) might be attributed to an error on their part when fitting the LFCM to their empirical data...|$|R

Between the events of Revelation of the Daleks and the season-long story The Trial of a Time Lord, the character is shown to have matured somewhat (coinciding with an 18-month <b>production</b> <b>break</b> between the two stories) and her relationship with the Doctor becomes less combative.|$|E

50|$|Near {{the end of}} {{recording}} the album Hysteria, during a <b>production</b> <b>break,</b> lead singer Joe Elliott was jamming with a riff he {{had come up with}} two weeks earlier on an acoustic guitar. Producer Mutt Lange, expressing great liking of it, suggested that it be developed into another song. Although already behind schedule, Lange felt that the album was still missing a strong crossover hit and that this last song had the potential to be one. Within two weeks the song was completed, smoothed out, and included as the twelfth track on Hysteria.|$|E

40|$|A parsimonious {{model with}} home production, {{estimated}} to match {{moments of the}} “labor wedge,” explains prominent puzzles of the international business cycle. If market and home activity are substitutes, then the measured labor wedge increases whenever market consumption and employment decrease. Home <b>production</b> <b>breaks</b> the tight negative link between market consumption and its marginal utility and therefore helps explain the international risk sharing puzzle. In an estimated two-country dynamic general equilibrium model in which the labor wedge is endogenously generated to match its empirical moments, market output and market employment are more correlated than market consumption and investment across countries, relative market consumption is negatively related to the real exchange rate and real net exports are countercyclical. Further, the international risk sharing puzzle becomes easier to explain as the degree of financial completeness increases. ...|$|R
