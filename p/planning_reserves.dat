40|$|This paper {{outlines}} a strawman {{proposal for}} ensuring electricity supply adequacy {{by means of}} contracting obligations imposed on load serving entities (LSE). The mandatory contracts {{take the form of}} physically covered back stop call options with a high strike price so as not to interfere with normal risk management practices. These call options which can be covered by existing capacity, new investment in generation, or curtailable load contracts are of one year duration and a two year lead time so as to enable new entrant participation. The obligation, which is based on forecasted peak load plus adequate <b>planning</b> <b>reserves,</b> can be met with any forward or option contract that meets the physical cover requirement, has the same delivery period, and has a strike or forward price at or below the backstop strike price. The proposed mechanisms is intended to facilitate smooth transition to an energy only market where voluntary bilateral contracting and spot prices provide the needed incentives for adequate investment in generation capacity. We also describe a central procurement alternative that alleviates the credit problems associated with carrying long term option contracts. The features of the proposed approach are compared to those of the controversial LICAP mechanism proposed by the NEISO and endorsed by FERC...|$|E

40|$|The {{increasing}} {{electrical load}} served by variable generation (VG), such as {{wind and solar}} energy, in the United States and many other countries has stimulated an interesting line of research to better quantify the capacity value of these resources. Methods applied traditionally to thermal units based on their average outage rates {{do not apply to}} VG because of their uncertain and non-dispatchable nature. The North American Electric Reliability Corporation's Integration of Variable Generation Task Force recently released a report that highlighted the need to develop and benchmark underlying loss-of-load expectation and related metrics that reasonably and fairly calculate the contribution to <b>planning</b> <b>reserves,</b> or capacity value, of solar and wind power. As the fraction of generation coming from VG becomes more significant, their estimated capacity value will have a larger impact on system planning. In this paper, we provide a method to include VG in traditional probabilistic-based adequacy methods. This method has been implemented in the Renewable Energy Probabilistic Resource Assessment tool developed at the National Renewable Energy Laboratory. Through an example based on the U. S. Western Interconnection, this method is applied to assess the effect that transmission can have on resource adequacy. We also analyze the interactions between available transmission and capacity value for VG...|$|E
40|$|Conservation {{planners}} must reconcile trade-offs {{associated with}} using biodiversity data of differing qualities to make decisions. Coarse habitat classifications {{are commonly used}} as surrogates to design marine reserve networks when fine-scale biodiversity data are incomplete or unavailable. Although finely-classified habitat maps provide more detail, they may have more misclassification errors, a common problem when remotely-sensed imagery is used. Despite these issues, planners rarely consider the effects of errors when choosing data for spatially explicit conservation prioritizations. Here we evaluate trade-offs between accuracy and resolution of hierarchical coral reef habitat data (geomorphology and benthic substrate) derived from remote sensing, in spatial planning for Kubulau District, Fiji. For both, we use accuracy information describing {{the probability that a}} mapped habitat classification is correct to design marine reserve networks that achieve habitat conservation targets, and demonstrate inadequacies of using habitat maps without accuracy data. We show that using more detailed habitat information ensures better representation of biogenic habitats (i. e. coral and seagrass), but leads to larger and more costly reserves, because these data have more misclassification errors, and are also more expensive to obtain. Reduced impacts on fishers are possible using coarsely-classified data, which are also more cost-effective for <b>planning</b> <b>reserves</b> if we account for data collection costs, but using these data may under-represent reef habitats that are important for fisheries and biodiversity, due to the maps low thematic resolution. Finally, we show that explicitly accounting for accuracy information in decisions maximizes the chance of successful conservation outcomes by reducing the risk of missing conservation representation targets, particularly when using finely classified data...|$|E
40|$|In 2007, the Southwest Power Pool (SPP) {{formed the}} Customer Response Task Force (CRTF) to {{identify}} barriers to deploying demand response (DR) resources in wholesale markets and develop policies {{to overcome these}} barriers. One of the initiatives of this Task Force was to develop more detailed information on existing retail DR programs and dynamic pricing tariffs, program rules, and utility operating practices. This report describes {{the results of a}} comprehensive survey conducted by LBNL in support of the Customer Response Task Force and discusses policy implications for integrating legacy retail DR programs and dynamic pricing tariffs into wholesale markets in the SPP region. LBNL conducted a detailed survey of existing DR programs and dynamic pricing tariffs administered by SPP's member utilities. Survey respondents were asked to provide information on advance notice requirements to customers, operational triggers used to call events (e. g. system emergencies, market conditions, local emergencies), use of these DR resources to meet <b>planning</b> <b>reserves</b> requirements, DR resource availability (e. g. seasonal, annual), participant incentive structures, and monitoring and verification (M&V) protocols. Nearly all of the 30 load-serving entities in SPP responded to the survey. Of this group, fourteen SPP member utilities administer 36 DR programs, five dynamic pricing tariffs, and six voluntary customer response initiatives. These existing DR programs and dynamic pricing tariffs have a peak demand reduction potential of 1, 552 MW. Other major findings of this study are: o About 81 percent of available DR is from interruptible rate tariffs offered to large commercial and industrial customers, while direct load control (DLC) programs account for ~;; 14 percent. o Arkansas accounts for ~;; 50 percent of the DR resources in the SPP footprint; these DR resources are primarily managed by cooperatives. o Publicly-owned cooperatives accounted for 54 percent of the existing DR resources among SPP members. For these entities, investment in DR is often driven by the need to reduce summer peak demand that is used to set demand charges for each distribution cooperative. o About 65 - 70 percent of the interruptible/curtailable tariffs and DLC programs are routinely triggered based on market conditions, not just for system emergencies. Approximately, 53 percent of the DR resources are available with less than two hours advance notice and 447 MW can be dispatched with less than thirty minutes notice. o Most legacy DR programs offered a reservation payment ($/kW) for participation; incentive payment levels ranged from $ 0. 40 to $ 8. 30 /kW-month for interruptible rate tariffs and $ 0. 30 to $ 4. 60 /kW-month for DLC programs. A few interruptible programs offered incentive payments which were explicitly linkedto actual load reductions during events; payments ranged from 2 to 40 cents/kWh for load curtailed...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{analyzes}} {{the effects of}} different fertilization strategies on forest management at Holmen Skog in Ume√• district. Harvesting volumes, net present values and fertilization intensity are presented for each fertilization scenario. The <b>planning</b> <b>reserve</b> (percentage area older than minimum final felling age) was also analyzed in this study. The thesis covers the analysis of five different fertilization scenarios, varying in fertilization intensity, from no fertilization at all, to fertilization at every harvesting operation (thinning or final felling). A sub-study was also carried out so the reader in detail can see how the different fertilization scenarios affect individual forest stands of different nature. The analysis has been done with the planning tool PlanWise, which is an application of the Heureka analysis and planning system. Of the analyzed scenarios it is most profitable to fertilize as much as possible, at each harvesting operation or twice before final felling. Among the analyzed scenarios, both net present value and harvesting volumes are higher the more the forest is fertilized. The size of the <b>planning</b> <b>reserve</b> has a relatively large impact on forest management. A low <b>planning</b> <b>reserve</b> results in a higher harvest volume already today compared to the current harvest level. A high <b>planning</b> <b>reserve</b> brings about low harvest volumes {{at the beginning of}} the of the planning periodas old forest must be saved to obtain a certain level of the <b>planning</b> <b>reserve.</b> Compared to a low reserve a high reserve also leads to net present value losses but has the advantage that the planning of harvesting operations is facilitated...|$|R

40|$|The Organization of Midwest ISO States (OMS) {{launched}} the Midwest Demand Resource Initiative (MWDRI) in 2007 to identify barriers to deploying demand response (DR) {{resources in the}} Midwest Independent System Operator (MISO) region and develop policies to overcome them. The MWDRI stakeholders decided that a useful initial activity would be to develop more detailed information on existing retail DR programs and dynamic pricing tariffs, program rules, and utility operating practices. This additional detail could then be used to assess any "seams issues" affecting coordination and integration of retail DR resources with MISO's wholesale markets. Working with state regulatory agencies, we conducted a detailed survey of existing DR programs, dynamic pricing tariffs, and their features in MISO states. Utilities {{were asked to provide}} information on advance notice requirements to customers, operational triggers used to call events (e. g. system emergencies, market conditions, local emergencies), use of these DR resources to meet <b>planning</b> <b>reserves</b> requirements, DR resource availability (e. g., seasonal, annual), participant incentive structures, and monitoring and verification (M&V) protocols. This report describes the results of this comprehensive survey and discusses policy implications for integrating legacy retail DR programs and dynamic pricing tariffs into organized wholesale markets. Survey responses from 37 MISO members and 4 non-members provided information on 141 DR programs and dynamic pricing tariffs with a peak load reduction potential of 4, 727 MW of retail DR resource. Major findings of this study area: - About 72 percent of available DR is from interruptible rate tariffs offered to large commercial and industrial customers, while direct load control (DLC) programs account for ~;; 18 percent. Almost 90 percent of the DR resources included in this survey are provided by investor-owned utilities. - Approximately, 90 percent of the DR resources are available with less than two hours advance notice and over 1, 900 MW can be dispatched on less than thirty minutes notice. These legacy DR programs are increasingly used by utilities for economic in addition to reliability purposes, with over two-thirds (68 percent) of these programs callable based on market conditions. - Approximately 60 percent of DLC programs and 30 percent of interruptible rate programs called ten or more DR events in 2006. Despite the high frequency of DR events, customer complaints remained low. The use of economic criteria to trigger DR events and the flexibility to trigger a large number of events suggests that DR resources can help improve the efficiency of MISO wholesale markets. - Most legacy DR programs offered a reservation payment ($/kW) for participation; incentive payment levels averaged about $ 5 /kW-month for interruptible rate tariffs and $ 6 /kW-month for DLC programs. Few programs offered incentive payments that were explicitly linked to actual load reductions during events and at least 27 DR programs do not have penalties for non-performance. - Measurement and verification (M&V) protocols to estimate load impacts vary significantly across MISO states. Almost half of the DR programs have not been evaluated in recent times and thus performance data for DR events is not available. For many DLC programs, M&V protocols may need to be enhanced in order to allow participation in MISO's proposed EDR schedule. System operators and planners will need to develop more accurate estimates of the load reduced capability and actual performance...|$|E
