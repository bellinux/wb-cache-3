Now, {{it will be}} {{observed}} by any one familiar with ordinary <b>principles</b> <b>of</b> <b>arrangement</b> of form (on which principles I shall insist at length in another place), that while the dream introduces these changes bearing on {{the expression of the}} scene, it is also introducing other changes, which appear to be made more or less in compliance with received rules of composition,[10] rendering the masses broader, the lines more continuous, and the curves more graceful. But the curious part of the business is, that these changes seem not so much to be wrought by imagining an entirely new condition of any feature, as by remembering something which will fit better in that place. For instance, Turner felt the bank on the right ought to be made more solid and rocky, in order to suggest firmer resistance to the stream, and he turns it, as will be seen by comparing the etchings, into a kind of rock buttress, to the wall, instead of a mere bank. Now, the buttress into which he turns it is very nearly a facsimile of one which he had drawn on that very St. Gothard road, far above, at the Devil's Bridge, at least thirty years before, and which he had himself etched and engraved, for the Liber Studiorum, although the plate was never published. Fig. 1 is a copy of the bit of the etching in question. Note how the wall winds over it, and observe especially the peculiar depression in the middle of its surface, and compare it in those parts generally with the features introduced in the later composition. Of course, this might be set down as a mere chance coincidence, but for the frequency of the cases in which Turner can be shown to have done the same thing, and to have introduced, after a lapse of many years, memories of something which, however apparently small or unimportant, had struck him in his earlier studies. These instances, when I can detect them, I shall point out as I go on engraving his works; and I think they are numerous enough to induce a doubt whether Turner's composition was not universally an arrangement of remembrances, summoned just as they were wanted, and set each in its fittest place. It is this very character which appears to me to mark it as so distinctly an act of dream-vision; for in a dream there is just this kind of confused remembrance of the forms of things which we have seen long ago, associated by new and strange laws. That common dreams are grotesque and disorderly, and Turner's dream natural and orderly, does not, to my thinking, involve any necessary difference in the real species of act of mind. I think I shall be able to show, {{in the course of the}} following pages, or elsewhere, that whenever Turner really tried to compose, and made modifications of his subjects on principle, he did wrong, and spoiled them; and that he only did right in a kind of passive obedience to his first vision, that vision being composed primarily of the strong memory of the place itself which he had to draw; and secondarily, of memories of other places (whether recognized as such by himself or not I cannot tell), associated, in a harmonious and helpful way, with the new central thought.|$|E

The following theoretical premises were important: Berndt Fredriksson's empirical archival science, JBLD Strömberg's concepts of archive systems and Randolph C. Head's concepts of mirroring. Two questions have been examined. What connections is there between the major reorganizations of the Swedish Royal Office archive, the process for governance of Sweden / the Royal Office, access to / control over archival documents, information needs, the political situation, and changes in how the archive was arranged and inventoried. What sources of inspiration have those responsible for the reorganizations had regarding the reorganizations? My source material consisted primarily of archival inventories. In this inquiry I have used a case study in which document and literature studies were conducted. During this study I have discovered that several <b>principles</b> <b>of</b> <b>arrangement</b> was in use simultaneously during the examined time period. This suggests either that older ideas regarding inventory labor were present {{at the same time and}} influenced the inventory labor or that the "archivist" during this time period had great freedom to choose between different <b>principles</b> <b>of</b> <b>arrangement.</b> Arrangement by geographic location were used during the entire time period. The archival inventories arranged by this principle has evolved from larger descriptions over geographic places to titles in Latin over countries. It also seems likely that the countries of this archival inventories represented Sweden's foreign relations. Mirroring has been detected between the reasons for the reorganizations, major political conflicts internally and externally, changes in the governance process, the user groups of the archive, the information needs and archival inventories.

40|$|Exhibition design conjoins {{distinct}} architectural and curatorial requirements. It {{is proposed}} that the common language of architecture and curatorship is space: how displays are arranged to be viewed in particular sequences and visual frames, placed in fields of co-visibility or grouped according to their spatial arrangement {{as well as their}} stylistic, historical or other classificatory labels. As visitors become immersed in exhibition space they are exposed to an informally staged pedagogy aimed at enhancing their enjoyment and understanding of the exhibition. The second floor of the High Museum of Art, with the permanent collection of objects, opened in 1983, is chosen as a case study. Meier designed the original building and decorative arts exhibition. Scogin and Elam produced a significant modification in 1997 to house a thematic exhibition. Lord Aeck and Sargent restored a simplified version of the original layout in 2003. Rigorous quantitative analyses document these successive changes and identify the fundamental shifts in exhibition design principles that they represent. Visual relationships, the break up of space and patterns of movement are analyzed using standard space-syntax methodologies. New techniques are proposed in order to describe and quantify overlapping patterns of spatial grouping. It is shown that the original design encouraged visitors to view and compare objects in alternative ways, generating open-ended readings and multiple understanding. The 1997 layout dictated sequences of viewing and framed frontal views in order to communicate how art engages human experience, including the body or the environment. The 2003 layout re-instated multiple viewing points and comparative groupings while emphasizing the individual work. The dissertation examines how architecture and curatorship interacted in a unique building which provides great experiential richness as well as design constraints. In addition, it demonstrates how descriptive theory can help bridge between architectural and curatorial intents by capturing the <b>principles</b> <b>of</b> <b>arrangement</b> which are fundamental to both.

The objectives of this paper are to examine meanings of the model, and to transform it into universal Terra Model based on historical issues. As the first step, fundamental systems and procedures of noospheres are discussed, and are cut (cleaved) into physical and social phases. Then both phases are given shapes concretely, and are prepared to be bonded (cleaved) to the new systems. At last, tasks ahead of us are shaping up for the model building. ...|$|R

The Educational Department of the University provides management of educational and methodical work. Methodical work of the University is a complex of measures aimed at:- providing educational process with educational-methodical documents;- improving educational skills of the teachers as well as students’ work during practical classes and after them independently;- improvement of all types and methods of training at the University considering the state and prospects of the development of medical organizations and institutions where the University grades are able to work.Courses and disciplines are taught at the University in accordance with the educational curriculum of the subjects. The content of working programs meets the requirements of educational and professional programs, and standard curriculum approved by the Central Methodical Board on higher medical education of the Ministry of Public Health of Ukraine. The programs created provide a systematic approach, during which each subject is learnt not as a separate, independent one, but as a part of an integral system aimed at training specialists of a certain specialization. Programs of acquiring practical skills in the disciplines are introduced into the educational process. The system of training of specialists at the University complies with the requirements of the existing standards of higher education. Considering the professional and active <b>principle</b> <b>of</b> <b>arrangement</b> <b>of</b> the University studies, availability, compiling and publishing textbooks, guidelines and manuals play an important role. Methodical instructions for practical classes and self-training of students which include algorithms for sequential mastering of practical skills, knowledge and abilities, educational and educational-methodical training appliances are prepared and issued at the University departments. Training at Bukovinian State Medical University is realized according to the credit-module system and requirements of the Bologna process. The credit-module system of estimating knowledge and skills of students has been used for 7 years. The University operates a mandatory control system of training students and the quality of training (test certification of the initial and final levels, the rating control). It includes: current (test, oral, written, computer-based) testing of students’ knowledge of each academic group during each practical class (100%), thematic testing of mastering separate units of the curriculum, monthly certification of students since the beginning of each term defining medium (rating) marks in each discipline, the final credit test (exam) of the students’ progress. A compulsory element of training in clinical departments and conducting tests in them is the assessment of practical skills and situational tasks, which are regarded as an algorithm of a physician’s work for a specific, defined situation and for a certain patient. Packages of programmes, sets of tests and questions of different complexity are created at the departments of the University. They are used at different stages of students’ testing and are available for convenience of study at the distance learning system [...] "MOODLE".|$|R
