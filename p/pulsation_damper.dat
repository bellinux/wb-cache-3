40|$|LecturePg. 141 - 146 Oil-free screw (OFS) {{compressors}} {{are capable}} of producing high-pressure pulsations in the discharge gas stream, over a frequency range of 200 to 3000 Hz. The fundamental pressure pulsation {{is due to the}} opening cycle of the compressor lobes at the discharge porting and {{is referred to as the}} pocket passing frequency (PPF). Fatigue failures have been observed in discharge silencers/pulsation dampers as well as downstream piping components in oil-free screw compressor service where the frequencies were greater than 1000 Hz. A careful review of the <b>pulsation</b> <b>damper</b> design has shown that attenuation effectiveness is limited to frequencies less than 1000 Hz. The principal purpose of the <b>pulsation</b> <b>damper</b> is to reduce the line pressure pulsations in order to lessen the chances of downstream piping failures. The <b>pulsation</b> <b>damper</b> does very little to attenuate high frequency noise levels that are transmitted to the area surrounding the compressor. The principal purpose of this paper is to document failures of silencer/pulsation dampers in OFS compressor service and provide a root cause analysis of these failure modes. Pulsation dampers are not used at the inlet flange in many applications, due to the lowpressure pulsation in the inlet plenum of the compressor. It is not the intent of this paper to present any theoretical background in the design of acoustic dampers, but to provide an overview of the acoustic phenomenon and how it is used in screw compressor applications. The end result of this work will be to provide practical guidelines for specifying silencer/pulsation dampers for OFS compressor applications...|$|E
40|$|We have derived {{a set of}} {{equations}} {{to describe}} the thermal evolution of a neutron star which undergoes small-amplitude radial pulsations. We have taken into account, {{in the frame of}} the General Theory of Relativity, the <b>pulsation</b> <b>damping</b> due to the bulk and shear viscosity and the accompanying heating of the star. The neutrino emission of a pulsating non-superfluid star and its heating due to the bulk viscosity are calculated assuming that both processes are determined by the non-equilibrium modified Urca process. Analytical and numerical solutions to the set of equations of the stellar evolution are obtained for linear and strongly non-linear deviations from beta-equilibrium. It is shown that a pulsating star may be heated to very high temperatures, while the <b>pulsations</b> <b>damp</b> very slowly with time (a power law damping for 100 - 1000 years), as long as the damping is determined by the bulk viscosity.

40|$|AbstractVibrations {{and noise}} {{caused by the}} {{pressure}} pulsations in the volumetric compressor manifolds have a high impact on the compression power requirement and the reliability of manifold operation. For the pressure pulsations attenuation, different types of mufflers are applied using a design based on the Helmholtz resonator model approach. This is particularly effective for the constant revolution speed compressors. For the widely introduced variable revolution speed compressors, other pressure pulsation attenuation methods are required. One of the possibilities to attenuate the pressure pulsations {{over a wide range}} of frequencies is the introduction of specially shaped nozzles in the gas duct flow. The CFD impulse flow simulations {{can be used as a}} tool for the estimation of the nozzle influence on the pressure <b>pulsations</b> <b>damping.</b> The direct 3 D or 2 D CFD simulation results are difficult to apply for this estimation. A new method has been worked out to obtain the damping coefficient for the diverse nozzle type, using the numerical simulation results of the impulse flow propagation. In this paper the application of the Levenberg-Marquardt method for damping parameter estimation is shown. This method allows fitting the attenuation curves described by damped equations to obtain damped oscillation functions from CFD results. In this paper the CFD based estimation method of pressure <b>pulsation</b> <b>damping</b> parameters is illustrated with an example of its application for a nozzle...|$|R

40|$|The {{capacity}} of a platform installation consisting of naphtha feed lines from centrifugal pumps to an oven has been increased by 25 % in combination with rerouting of the piping layout upstream of the oven and inside the convection zone. The operating company observed considerable increase of the vibration levels of the naphtha feed lines since the restart of the plant. The vibrations have resulted in breakage of the supports in vertical pipe sections on two out of four 6 -inch naphtha feed lines. TNO has received the assignment to perform a root cause analysis of the vibration problems and provide remedies to reduce the vibrations to acceptable levels. The analyses includes on site pulsation and vibration measurements followed by a pulsation and mechanical response analysis and finally a check on pulsations and vibrations after the modification. A number of possible root causes are presented and analyzed in this paper. It is most likely that the low frequency vibrations are caused by slug flow in the naphtha feed piping or two-phase flow developed into the convection zone of the oven. A simulation of the naphtha system from the pumps up to the convection zone in the oven shows pressure pulsations up to 4 % peak-to-peak of the line pressure, which causes pulsation-induced vibration forces up to 450 Newton peak-to-peak. Several modifications have been investigated to reduce pulsation levels and forces: • Omitting the sources of two-phase flow in piping to the convection zone of the oven • Install a <b>pulsation</b> <b>damper</b> at the inlet of the oven • Install orifice plates {{in combination with the}} <b>pulsation</b> <b>damper</b> • Improve the stiffness of the pipe supporting structure The paper shows that residual vibration levels are acceptable after modification of the piping support layout and that the installation can be operated over the entire operating envelope without problems. © Evert van Bokhorst, TNO Science and Industry, 2010...|$|E

40|$|Perhaps {{the most}} {{familiar}} concepts when discussing acoustic scattering by bubbles are the resonance frequency for bubble <b>pulsation,</b> the bubbles' <b>damping,</b> and their scattering and extinction cross-sections, {{all of which are}} used routinely in oceanography, sonochemistry, and biomedicine. The apparent simplicity of these concepts is illusory: there exist multiple, sometimes contradictory definitions for their components. This paper reviews expressions and definitions in the literature for acoustical cross-sections, resonance frequencies, and damping factors of a spherically pulsating gas bubble in an infinite liquid medium, deriving two expressions for resonance frequency that are compared and reconciled with two others from the reviewed literature. In order to prevent errors, care is needed by researchers when combining results from different publications that might have used internally correct but mutually inconsistent definitions. Expressions are presented for acoustical cross-sections associated with forced <b>pulsations</b> <b>damped</b> by liquid shear and (oft-neglected) bulk or dilatational viscosities, gas thermal diffusivity, and acoustic re-radiation.

40|$|Reciprocating {{compressors}} generate vibrations {{caused by}} pulsation-induced forces, mechanical (unbalanced) free forces and moments, crosshead guide forces and cylinder stretch forces. The {{traditional way of}} mitigating the vibration and cyclic stress levels to avoid fatigue failure of parts of the reciprocating compressor system (piping, separators, dampers, and compressor) is to stiffen the structures by e. g. the installation of additional pipe supports or steel structures. This {{is becoming more and}} more challenging because compressor speeds are increased, resulting in higher frequencies to be mitigated. Higher frequencies require stiffer structures which is often not possible because the available space and the absence of stiff structures in the vicinity is limited. This is especially the case for high elevated pipe systems, e. g. the pipe between the separator and suction damper. At mechanical resonance, the damping ratio determines the amplitude of the vibration: more damping decreases the vibration and cyclic stress amplitude leading to lower fatigue failures. Mitigating vibrations of rather low damped systems is possible by applying the concept of constrained layer damping (CLD). The technique has been used for decades in other industries such as the space and automotive industry, but is not often (if at all) used in reciprocating compressor systems up to now. Another way of mitigating vibrations is the application of a tuned mass damper (TMD) system which is often used in ships, building and bridges. The disadvantage of TMD systems is that fatigue failure of the TMD can occur if not damped sufficiently. This paper presents the investigative work performed on the potential of using CLD and a TMD for a U-pipe configuration and a <b>pulsation</b> <b>damper.</b> The application of CLD to increase the damping of the TMD to avoid fatigue failure of the TMD is also discussed into detail. Detailed, material characterization, FE calculations and design optimization has been performed, followed by experiments. By means of measurements it is shown that a large reduction in vibration and cyclic stress levels can be achieved. Reduction factors between 13 and 42 have been achieved with a TMD system and 20 for a CLD application. This paper explains the principle and optimized design of a CLD and damped TMD systems and will show the effectiveness for two different parts of existing reciprocating compressor systems...|$|E

40|$|In {{reciprocating}} fluid displacement systems, a {{trend toward}} high-speed machinery and application of stepless reverse-flow capacity control system is observed. Badly designed compression systems may cause excessive high-frequency noise and vibration levels, which are a risk from a structural integrity point-of-view. Furthermore, noise levels, conflicting with both environmental and HSE legislation may result in reduced system capacity or even process shutdown. Therefore, a robust system design {{should focus on the}} mitigation of high-frequency pulsations in an early design stage. This paper highlights the multi-bore orifice plates (MBRO’s) as powerful damping devices of in-line, highfrequency pressure pulsations. MBRO’s provide efficient <b>pulsation</b> <b>damping</b> behavior at high frequencies (up to 1 kHz) where conventional (single bore) orifices plates fail.

Although the physical conditions in compressor delivery systems are very different from those in gas generator suction systems, a similar theoretical approach, verified by acoustic model tests, has been found both to provide a good insight into the problem, and to give an acceptably accurate quantitative indication of pressure pulsation amplitudes.

However {{over the past few decades}} several important analyses have been based on a heuristically derived small-amplitude expansion of the Rayleigh–Plesset equation which considers the bubble volume, instead of the radius, as the parameter of interest, and for which the dissipation term is not derived from first principles. So common is the use of this equation in some fields that the inherent differences between it and the ‘radius frame’ Rayleigh–Plesset equation are not emphasised, and it is important in comparing the results of the two equations to understand that they differ both in terms of damping, and in the extent to which they neglect higher order terms. This paper highlights these differences. Furthermore, it derives a ‘volume frame’ version of the Rayleigh–Plesset equation which contains exactly the same basic physics for dissipation, and retains terms to the same high order, as does the ‘radius frame’ Rayleigh–Plesset equation.

40|$|We {{study the}} effects of finite stellar {{temperatures}} on the oscillations of superfluid neutron stars. The importance of these effects is illustrated with a simple example of a radially pulsating general relativistic star. Two main effects are taken into account: (i) temperature dependence of the entrainment matrix and (ii) the variation of the size of superfluid region with temperature. Four models are considered, which include either one or both of these two effects. Pulsation spectra are calculated for these models, and asymptotes for eigenfrequencies at temperatures close to critical temperature of neutron superfluidity, are derived. It is demonstrated that models that allow for the temperature effect (ii) but disregard the effect (i), yield unrealistic results. Eigenfunctions for the normal- and superfluid-type pulsations are analyzed. It is shown that superfluid pulsation modes practically do not appear at the neutron-star surface and, therefore, can hardly be observed by measuring the modulation of the electromagnetic radiation from the star. The e-folding times for <b>damping</b> of <b>pulsations</b> due to the shear viscosity and nonequilibrium modified Urca processes are calculated and their asymptotes at temperatures close to the neutron critical temperature, are obtained. It is demonstrated that superfluid <b>pulsation</b> modes are <b>damped</b> by 1 [...] 3 orders of magnitude faster than normal modes. Comment: 17 pages, 7 figures, accepted for publication in Phys.

40|$|We {{report this}} case of primary sarcoma of the {{pericardium}} {{because of its}} rarity and because a confident diagnosis of chronic constrictive pericarditis {{had been made in}} life, the correct diagnosis being made only at necropsy. Reference to standard works on cardiology reveals that primary tumour of the pericardium is not discussed and is not included in the differential diagnosis of con-strictive pericarditis (White, 1951; Wood, 1956). Case Report The patient, a man aged 45, was admitted to St. Vincent's Hospital on March 7, 1960 from a country hospital with a provisional diagnosis of pleural effusion. He was a carpenter and occasional farmhand, and had been in perfect health until four months previously. His personal and family history was clear, with nothing to suggest tuberculosis. On admission he complained of an unproductive cough associated with central pericardial or pleuritic type of pain. He had one or two bouts of dyspncea at rest a few months previously and was now obviously orthopnceic. He had had ankle cedema before admission. He complained of lassitude, anorexia, gross loss of weight, and night sweats, but not of hlemoptysis. On examination he had the classical signs of constrictive pericarditis, with signs of an extensive right-sided pleural effusion. The apex beat was impalpable, the pulse was fairly rapid and small, and there was in easily identified pulsus paradoxicus with disappearance of the pulse on deep inspiration. The blood pressure was 105 / 80 mm. Hg. The venous pressure was high, and the small <b>damped</b> <b>pulsations</b> in th...|$|R
40|$|Fundamental stellar properties, such as mass, radius, and age, can be {{inferred}} using asteroseismology. Cool stars with convective envelopes have turbulent motions that can stochastically drive and <b>damp</b> <b>pulsations.</b> The properties of the oscillation frequency power spectrum can be tied to mass and radius through solar-scaled asteroseismic relations. Stellar properties derived using these scaling relations need verification over a range of metallicities. Because the age and mass of halo stars are well-constrained by astrophysical priors, they provide an independent, empirical check on asteroseismic mass estimates in the low-metallicity regime. We identify nine metal-poor red giants (including six stars that are kinematically associated with the halo) from a sample observed by both the Kepler space telescope and the Sloan Digital Sky Survey-III APOGEE spectroscopic survey. We compare masses inferred using asteroseismology to those expected for halo and thick-disk stars. Although our sample is small, standard scaling relations, combined with asteroseismic parameters from the APOKASC Catalog, produce masses that are systematically higher (= 0. 17 +/- 0. 05 Msun) than astrophysical expectations. The magnitude of the mass discrepancy is reduced by known theoretical corrections to the measured large frequency separation scaling relationship. Using alternative methods for measuring asteroseismic parameters induces systematic shifts at the 0. 04 Msun level. We also compare published asteroseismic analyses with scaling relationship masses to {{examine the impact of}} using the frequency of maximum power as a constraint. Upcoming APOKASC observations will provide a larger sample of ~ 100 metal-poor stars, important for detailed asteroseismic characterization of Galactic stellar populations.

40|$|The {{effect of}} a dipole {{magnetic}} field on adiabatic axisymmetric non-radial p-mode pulsations is studied numerically. The angular dependence of pulsation, which cannot be represented by a single spherical harmonic {{in the presence of}} a magnetic field, is expanded into a series of spherical harmonics with different degrees ℓ. The presence of a magnetic field not only shifts the pulsation frequency, the <b>pulsations</b> are also <b>damped</b> due to the generation of magnetic slow waves. In agreement with the results of Cunha & Gough, who used a different approach from ours, we find that the {{effect of a}} magnetic field on the intermediate-to-high-order p-modes is not monotonic but cyclic with respect to the pulsation frequency and the magnetic field strength. The damping rate of a high-order p-mode becomes very small at about 3 kG and 8 kG; the corresponding field strengths are higher for lower overtones. The diminished magnetic damping is favourable for the corresponding modes, if they are excited by the classical κ-mechanism, to survive even {{in the presence of a}} strong magnetic field. This picture could explain the mode selection as observed in the rapidly oscillating Ap stars. For a low-order p-mode, the damping rate increases as the strength of the magnetic field increases. We find that in the presence of a magnetic field of a few kG, magnetic damping seems to exceed the driving owing to the κ-mechanism of oscillations representative of δ Scuti variability. This may explain why δ Scuti-type oscillations are unlikely to be seen in magnetic Ap stars. The amplitude of a mainly dipole (or quadrupole) mode is strongly confined to the magnetic axis in the outer layers. Furthermore, horizontal motion can be comparable to radial motion even for high-order p-modes. We discuss the influence of the magnetic distortion of the eigenfunction on the pulsation amplitude modulation with respect to the rotation phas...|$|R
