40|$|NoA current, popular, {{theory of}} spatial {{localization}} {{holds that the}} visual system represents the location of simple objects by a single <b>positional</b> <b>tag,</b> the accuracy of which is largely independent of the internal properties of the object. We have already presented evidence {{of the limitations of}} such a view (Keeble & Hess (1998). Vision Research, 38, 827 - 840) in that 3 -micropattern alignment performance was found to be dependent on the orientation of the micropatterns. We tested whether this was caused by a local anisotropy in positional coding by conducting 3 -micropattern bisection experiments with varying patch orientation. No corresponding effect of patch orientation was found, implying a difference in the mechanisms used for the two tasks. In a further experiment we show that alignment task performance is very similar to the otherwise identical 2 -patch orientation discrimination task. We conclude that the 3 -micropattern alignment task is mediated by orientational mechanisms. We therefore present a 2 nd-order orientation model for 3 -patch alignment...|$|E
50|$|According to the Chemoaffinity hypothesis, {{chemical}} {{labels are}} distributed in a graded fashion across the retina and tectum. This allows each retinal ganglion cell to recognize its proper termination site. Experiments with artificially created compound eyes in Xenopus demonstrate {{that not only}} the ganglion cells but also their axons carry these specificities. Axons {{must be able to}} communicate with each other to ensure that ones with the same <b>positional</b> <b>tags</b> innervate the same area of the superior colliculus.|$|R
40|$|AbstractWe {{conducted}} a Vernier acuity experiment using orientation-modulated (OM) textures {{in which the}} overall shape (skewness) of the modulations was manipulated independently of their orientation content. Misalignments between OMs {{were consistent with the}} application of global <b>positional</b> <b>tags,</b> but {{not on the basis of}} a single cue (e. g. centroid, peak, or zero-crossing). Instead, modelling of our results in terms of orientation-opponent spatial filters not only led to an excellent fit, but also to estimates of the size and shape of these filters that correspond closely to those made by other researchers using a different task and different stimulus parameters and configurations...|$|R
40|$|Annotated corpora such as treebanks are {{important}} {{for the development of}} parsers, language applications as well as understanding of the language itself. Only very few languages possess these scarce resources. In this paper, we describe our effort in syntactically annotating a small corpora (600 sentences) of Tamil language. Our annotation is similar to Prague Dependency Treebank (PDT 2. 0) and consists of 2 levels or layers: (i) morphological layer (m-layer) and (ii) analytical layer (a-layer). For both the layers, we introduce annotation schemes i. e. <b>positional</b> <b>tagging</b> for m-layer and dependency relations (and how dependency structures should be drawn) for a-layers. Finally, we evaluate our corpora in the tagging and parsing task using well known taggers and parsers and discuss some general issues in annotation for Tamil language...|$|R
40|$|Acyl {{migration}} {{is a serious}} problem in enzymatic modification of fats and oils, particularly in production of cocoa butter equivalent (CBE) through enzymatic acidolysis reaction, which leads to the formation of non-symmetrical triacylglycerols (TAGs) from symmetrical TAGs. Non-symmetrical TAGs may affect the physical properties of final products and are therefore often undesired. Consequently, an accurate method is needed to determine <b>positional</b> isomer <b>TAGs</b> during the production of CBE. A bidimentional high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) method with combination of non-aqueous reversed-phase HPLC and silver ion HPLC joining with an evaporative light scattering detector was successfully developed for the analysis of stereospecific TAGs. The best separation of positional isomer standards was obtained with a heptane/acetone mobile-phase gradient at 25 degrees C and 1 mL/min. The developed method was then used in multidimensional determination of the <b>TAG</b> <b>positional</b> isomers in fat and oil blends and successfully identified the TAGs and possible isomers in enzymatically acidolyzed CBE...|$|R
40|$|This {{paper is}} {{concerned}} with the de- tection and correction of sub-sentential English text errors. Previous spelling programs, unless restricted to a very small set of words, have operated as post-processors. And to date, grammar checkers and other programs which deal with ill-formed input usually step directly from spelling considerations to a full-scale parse, assuming a complete sentence. Work described below is aimed at evaluating the effectiveness of shal- low (sub-sentential) processing and the feasibility of cooperative error checking, through building and testing appropriately an error-processing system. A sys- tem under construction is outlined which incorporates morphological chcks (using new two-level error rules) over a directed letter graph, <b>tag</b> <b>positional</b> trigrams and partial partng. Intended testing is discussed...|$|R
40|$|There {{is little}} {{available}} {{information on the}} synthesis of triacylglycerol?s due to the industrial value of this field. There is also a shifting focus on enzymatic in favour of chemical processes due to more environmental friendly technology. This thesis aims to construct and understand the mechanics of an enzymatic process, utilising Novozym 435 {{for the production of}} triacylglycerol?s from high PUFA content ethyl esters. Lab-scale experiments were carried out with particular focus on factors such as temperature and pressure, but also reaction kinetics. Experimental results were analysed by TLC-FID and 13 C/ 1 H NMR to establish lipid class changes and enzymatic acyl- and <b>positional</b> preferences. Maximum <b>TAG</b> yield obtained was 81 %. An Arrhenius plot showed concave curvature with an Ea ranging from 24 - 47. 5 kJ/mol. The reaction rate showed a linear dependency on pressure and temperature with a 0. 28 - and 0. 6 area%/h change pr. 1 mbar and 1 C&# 176; respectively. Novozym 435 displayed 1, 3 -specificity, but no n- 3 preference or discrimination. </p...|$|R
40|$|The Agrobacterium vacuum {{infiltration}} {{method has}} made it possible to transform Arabidopsis thaliana without plant tissue culture or regeneration. In the present study, this method was evaluated and a substantially modified transformation method was developed. The labor-intensive vacuum infiltration process was eliminated in favor of simple dipping of developing floral tissues into a solution containing Agrobacterium tumefaciens, 5 % sucrose and 500 microliters per litre of surfactant Silwet L- 77. Sucrose and surfactant were {{critical to the success of}} the floral dip method. Plants inoculated when numerous immature floral buds and few siliques were present produced transformed progeny at the highest rate. Plant tissue culture media, the hormone benzylamino purine and pH adjustment were unnecessary, and Agrobacterium could be applied to plants at a range of cell densities. Repeated application of Agrobacterium improved transformation rates and overall yield of transformants approximately twofold. Covering plants for 1 day to retain humidity after inoculation also raised transformation rates twofold. Multiple ecotypes were transformable by this method. The modified method should facilitate high-throughput transformation of Arabidopsis for efforts such as T-DNA gene <b>tagging,</b> <b>positional</b> cloning, or attempts at targeted gene replacement...|$|R
40|$|Fatty acids {{have been}} shown to be {{selectively}} mobilized from rat white fat-cells, whatever the dietary manipulations. For convenience, fatty acids have been classified as being highly, weakly and moderately mobilizable. The aim of this study was to examine whether the selective mobilization of fatty acids can be explained, even partly, by their positional distribution in adipose-tissue triacylglycerols (TAG) via the known specificity of hormone-sensitive lipase for the sn- 1 and sn- 3 positions. Adipose tissue was dietarily manipulated in order to obtain a wide spectrum of fatty acids, including large amounts of either very-long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (VLC-PUFA) or very-long-chain monounsaturated fatty acids (VLC-MUFA). The determination of fatty acid distribution in adipose tissue TAG was based on random formation of 1, 2 -diacyl-rac-glycerols by Grignard degradation, followed by synthesis of phosphatidic acids and hydrolysis in the sn- 2 position by phospholipase A 2. Regardless of the fatty acid composition and location of fat depots, highly (e. g. 18 : 4 n- 3 and some of the VLC-PUFA) and weakly (e. g. VLC-MUFA) mobilizable fatty acids were located mainly in the outer (sn- 1 and sn- 3) positions of the glycerol moiety (79. 5 % and 92. 5 % on average, respectively). Other fatty acids, which are rather moderately mobilizable, were more randomly distributed. We conclude that the selective mobilization of white-fat-cell fatty acids is not based on their <b>positional</b> distribution in <b>TAG...</b>|$|R
40|$|Reversed-phase high {{performance}} liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC), followed by post-column addition of lithium salts and electrospray ionisation triple-stage mass spectrometry (ESI-MS 3) of lithiated TAG adducts, {{is shown to}} provide a useful method for the positional analysis of triacylglycerols (TAGs) in fish oils containing eicosapentaenoic (EPA, 20 : 5) and docosahexaenoic acids (DHA, 22 : 6). One prominent fragmentation pathway in the ESI-MS 3 of these adduct ions involves {{the loss of a}} fatty acid from the sn- 1 / 3 position in the first step followed by the loss of an 3 ̆b 1, 3 ̆b 2 -unsaturated fatty acid from the sn- 2 position in the second. Regioisomeric TAGs of the type ABA and AAB produced abundant product ions 2 ̆ 013 [ABA + Li 2 ̆ 212 RACOOH 2 ̆ 212 R 2 ̆ 032 BCHCHCOOH]+ and [AAB + Li 2 ̆ 212 RACOOH 2 ̆ 212 R 2 ̆ 032 ACHCHCOOH]+ 2 ̆ 013 the relative intensities of which were dependent on the position of acyl substituents. Standard solutions of TAGs containing different ratios of the regioisomeric pairs MME/MEM, PPE/PEP, PPD/PDP, EEP/EPE and DDP/DPD (M = 14 : 0, P = 16 : 0, E = 20 : 5, D = 22 : 6) were analysed by ESI-MS 3 with a quadrupole linear ion trap instrument. Methodology developed on the standards was applied to quantifying the relative isomeric abundances of EPA and DHA in several fish oil samples. DHA was preferentially located at the sn- 2 position in both DHA-containing TAGs studied, while EPA was either observed at near equal levels in all positions, or predominantly at the sn- 1 and - 3 positions in some cases. The analysis protocol allows for quantification of the designated regioisomers in one simple, rapid chromatographic procedure using a single column and has the advantage of specificity over other methods for the <b>positional</b> analysis of <b>TAGs,</b> since it eliminates interferences associated with co-eluting TAGs of the same molecular weight that yield isobaric diacylglycerol-like product ions.
