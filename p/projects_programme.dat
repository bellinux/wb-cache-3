40|$|AbstractClick {{here and}} insert your {{abstract}} text. Governance of <b>projects,</b> <b>programmes</b> and portfolios {{is an increasing}} research area and practice, {{but it is not}} yet considered to be as mature as it happens with project management concepts and practices. The extant research in this subject focus mainly in two different approaches: the first relates with multi-firm project governance and the second concerning governance of projects, as part of the corporate governance. This paper addresses the disclosure and reporting governance component, under the second approach. The importance of disclosure and reporting governance component is to ensure that <b>projects,</b> <b>programmes</b> and portfolios are aligned with corporation objectives and stakeholders’ expectations. The organization projects’ control system performance indicators should provide the reliable information, required for decision making by the different governance levels: Executive Board level, Contextual level, and Individual Project level. This complete and understandable set of performance indicators, across the projects’ life cycle, is required as an input to evaluate and improve the governance structures, responsibilities, principles and polices applied to <b>projects,</b> <b>programmes</b> and portfolios. This paper is the interim result of an on-going research with the overall aim of evaluates the perceived relevance of the different projects performance indicators, {{in the context of the}} governance of <b>projects,</b> <b>programmes</b> and portfolios. It also intends to evaluate in what conditions that perception is influenced by organization's governance of projects paradigm, governance of projects structure level, project contract types or even by different project types...|$|R
