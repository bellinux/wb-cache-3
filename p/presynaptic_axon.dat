40|$|Catecholaminergic neurons, {{which take}} up and retain {{exogenous}} norepinephrine labeled with tritium, were studied {{by means of}} high resolution radioautography, in the substantia nigra, the substantia grisea periventricularis, and the locus coeruleus of the rat. Under the conditions required for the radioautographic detection of exogenous norepinephrine- 3 H, it was established that (1) glutaraldehyde was the most suitable fixative for preserving the labeled amine in situ; (2) norepinephrine- 3 H itself, rather than metabolites, accounted {{for most of the}} reactions detected in catecholaminergic neurons. At various time intervals after an intraventricular injection of norepinephrine- 3 H, the tracer reached a concentration 15 – 100 times higher, and disappeared at a slower rate, in <b>presynaptic</b> <b>axons</b> (t½: 4 hr) than in nerve cell bodies (t½: 0. 8 – 1. 3 hr). After pretreatment with a monoamine oxidase inhibitor, the radioautographic reactions increased and persisted longer, especially in the preterminal axons. Within neurons, the labeled amine was ubiquitously distributed in the nerve cell body and concentrated in <b>presynaptic</b> <b>axons</b> and synaptic terminals of various morphological types. Although large granular vesicles were usually present in the labeled axonal bulbs, no structural characteristic could be specifically ascribed to catecholaminergic neurons.

50|$|In a model gated synapse, {{the gate}} is either open or closed by default. The {{gatekeeper}} neuron, therefore, {{serves as an}} external switch to the gate at the synapse of two other neurons. One of these neurons provides the input signal and the other provides the output signal. It {{is the role of}} the gatekeeper neuron to regulate the transmission of the input to the output. When activated, the gatekeeper neuron alters the polarity of the <b>presynaptic</b> <b>axon</b> to either open or close the gate. If this neuron depolarizes the <b>presynaptic</b> <b>axon,</b> it allows the signal to be transmitted. Thus, the gate is open. Hyperpolarization of the <b>presynaptic</b> <b>axon</b> closes the gate. Just like in a transistor, the gatekeeper neuron turns the system on or off; it affects the output signal of the postsynaptic neuron. Whether it is turned on or off is dependent on the nature of the input signal (either excitatory or inhibitory) from the presynaptic neuron.|$|E
50|$|Chemical {{synaptic}} {{transmission is}} {{the transfer of}} neurotransmitters or neuropeptides from a <b>presynaptic</b> <b>axon</b> to a postsynaptic dendrite. Unlike an electrical synapse, the chemical synapses are separated by a space called the synaptic cleft, typically measured between 15 and 25 nm.

50|$|This {{phenomenon}} {{is known as}} an excitatory postsynaptic potential (EPSP).

Afferents were physiologically characterized by intracellular recording, before injection with neurobiotin and preparation for electron microscopy. Axon terminals were serially sectioned and immunolabeled with antibodies against GABA and glycine using a postembedding immunogold method. Afferent boutons in lamina III were often surrounded by several <b>presynaptic</b> <b>axons</b> and postsynaptic dendrites (thus forming type II glomeruli), while boutons in laminae IV–V had only simple, nonglomerular interactions. In both regions triadic synaptic arrangements where presynaptic interneurons contact both afferent boutons and their postsynaptic dendrites were present in 50 – 75 % of boutons. Approximately three-quarters of <b>presynaptic</b> <b>axons</b> were immunoreactive for both GABA and glycine and most of the remainder for GABA alone. Most postsynaptic dendrites were not immunoreactive. Comparisons are made with information from similar studies of other rat and cat afferents conducting in the Aαβ range. This demonstrates that although the principles of control may be similar for cutaneous afferents of this type there are significant differences between cutaneous and 1 a muscle afferents in the rat. There are also differences in detail between the interactions of afferents of the same modality in rat and cat; in the rat there are greater numbers of <b>presynaptic</b> <b>axons</b> per bouton and a greater proportion of boutons receive axo-axonic contacts and are involved in synaptic triads...|$|R
40|$|Locations of a {{distinctive}} mode of trans-endocytosis involving dendrites, axons, and glia were quantified through serial section electron microscopy. Short vesicular or long vermiform evaginations emerged from dendrites and axons and were engulfed by <b>presynaptic</b> or neighboring <b>axons,</b> astrocytes, and, surprisingly, a growth cone to form double-membrane structures called spinules. In total, 254 spinules were evaluated in 326 �m 3 of stratum radiatum in area CA 1 of mature rat hippocampus. Spinules emerged from spine heads (62 %), necks (24 %), axons (13 %), dendritic shafts (1 %), or nonsynaptic protrusions (� 1 %) and invaginated into axons (� 90 %), astrocytic processes (� 8 %), or a growth cone (� 1 %). Coated pits {{occurred on the}} engulfing membrane at the tips of most spinules (69 %), and double-membrane structures occurred freely in axonal and astrocytic cytoplasm, suggesting trans-endocytosis. Spinule locations differed among mushroom and thin spines. For mushroom spines, most (84 %) of the spinules were engulfed by <b>presynaptic</b> <b>axons,</b> 16 % by neighboring axons, and none by astrocytic processes. At thin spines, only 17 % of the spinules were engulfed by <b>presynaptic</b> <b>axons,</b> whereas 67 % were engulfed by neighboring axons and 14 % by astrocytic processes. Spinules engulfed by astrocytic processes support the growing evidence that perisynaptic glia interact directly with synapses at least on thin spines. Spinules with neighboring axons may provide a mechanism for synaptic competition in the mature brain. Trans-endocytosis of spinules by <b>presynaptic</b> <b>axons</b> suggest retrograde signaling or coordinated remodeling of presynaptic and postsynaptic membranes to remove transient perforations and assemble the postsynaptic density of large synapses on mushroom spines...|$|R

Although patch recording from postsynaptic neurones is routine, many <b>presynaptic</b> <b>axons</b> take tortuous turns and are severed in the slicing procedure, blocking propagation {{of the action}} potential to the synaptic terminal and preventing synaptic stimulation. Here we demonstrate a method of using calcium imaging to select postsynaptic cells with functional synaptic inputs prior to patch-clamp recording. We have used this method for exploring transmission in the auditory brainstem at the medial nucleus of the trapezoid body neurones, which are innervated by axons from the contralateral cochlear nucleus. Brainstem slices were briefly loaded with the calcium indicator fura- 2 AM and stimulated with an electrode placed on the midline. Electrical stimulation caused a rise in intracellular calcium concentration in those postsynaptic neurones with active synaptic connections. Since < 10 % of the medial nucleus of the trapezoid body neurones retain viable synaptic inputs following the slicing procedure, preselecting those cells with active synapses dramatically increased our recording success. This detection method will greatly ease the study of synaptic responses in brain areas where suprathreshold synaptic inputs occur but connectivity is sparse. 1688...|$|R

50|$|The most {{commonly}} used treatment for spasmodic torticollis {{is the use of}} botulinum toxin injection in the dystonic musculature. Botulinum toxin type A is most often used; it prevents the release of acetylcholine from the <b>presynaptic</b> <b>axon</b> of the motor end plate, paralyzing the dystonic muscle. By disabling the movement of the antagonist muscle, the agonist muscle is allowed to move freely. With botulinum toxin injections, patients experience relief from spasmodic torticollis for approximately 12 to 16 weeks. There are several type A preparations available worldwide; however Botox and Dysport are the only preparations approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for clinical use in the United States.|$|E
50|$|Similar {{to growth}} cone guidance, synapse {{formation}} is cued by UNC-5 through a UNC-6 gradient that repels the dorsal axon migration. Dendritic filopodia extend from the dendritic shaft during synaptogenesis and appear {{as though they}} are reaching out for a <b>presynaptic</b> <b>axon.</b> Despite the appearance of attaching to an axon, cell signaling is still required for complete synaptic formation. An experiment was performed to determine the role of UNC-5 in axonal growth after spinal cord injury. The netrin is expressed by neurons in the corticospinal and rubrospinal projections, and by intrinsic neurons of the spinal cord {{both before and after the}} injury. When testing in vitro UNC-5 receptor bodies are taken from the spinal cord to neutralize netrin-1 in myelin. This increases the neurite outgrowth from UNC-5 expressing spinal motor neurons.|$|E

There can be as many as 15,000 spines per cell, each of which serves as a postsynaptic process for individual <b>presynaptic</b> <b>axons.</b> Dendritic branching can be extensive and in some cases is sufficient to receive as many as 100,000 inputs to a single neuron.|$|R

Temporal summation of synaptic potential occurs during repetitive presynaptic stimulation, and after such stimulation the rate of decay of synaptic potential is greatly slowed.

Unexpectedly, unlike other modulations mediated by presynaptic receptors, the NMDA-induced inhibition does not involve a depression of transmitter release.

5000|$|Evidence {{suggest that}} N-Cadherins {{stabilize}} {{the connection between}} the presynaptic terminal and postsynaptic spine [...] and that this stabilization increases the likelihood that released glutamate will bind receptors on the postsynaptic neuron. At basal levels of synaptic activity, N-cadherins are largely monomers and are thus weakly adhesive to cadherins located in the cell {{on the opposite side of}} the synapse. The influx of Ca2+ through NMDARs, promotes the dimerization of N-cadherins. Dimerized cadherins readily bind to their presynaptic cadherin partners. Inhibition of N-cadherin binding via blocking antibodies prevents the induction of late phase L-long term potentiation, suggesting that the adhesive property of dimeric N-cadherin is necessary for late phase L-LTP.Additionally, KCl depolarization of the <b>presynaptic</b> <b>axon</b> both confers protease resistance to N-cadherins and disperses them throughout the PSD from their original clustering in synaptic puncta, thus increasing their efficacy for cell adhesion.|$|E

50|$|One pervading {{difference}} was that inhibitors of COMT enhanced the effect of isoprenaline at β-adrenoceptors (and the ensuing blood vessel relaxation) but not the effect of noradrenaline at α-adrenoceptors (and the ensuing blood vessel contraction). Conversely inhibitors of the transport of noradrenaline into <b>presynaptic</b> <b>axon</b> terminals - cocaine being a prototype inhibitor - enhanced the effect of noradrenaline at α-, but nor the effect of isoprenaline at β-adrenoceptors. Guimarães and his coworkers concluded that the density of COMT was greater in der „biophase“ of the β-adrenoceptors than in the biophase of the α-adrenoceptors. Conversely, {{the density of the}} cocaine-sensitive transporters should be greater in the biophase of the α-adrenoceptors than the β-adrenoceptors. The hypothesis was supported by two articles in Naunyn-Schmiedeberg’s Archives of Pharmacology. In 1982, Guimarães wrote in Trends in Pharmacological Sciences: „In vascular tissue there are two different biophases for sympathomimetic agents: one for the α-adrenoceptors around the nerve terminals, where the concentration of the agonist available for the α-effect is mainly governed by uptake into these terminals; one for the β-adrenoceptors in the neighbourhood of COMT whose activity is the main factor determining the concentration of the agonist available for the β-effect.“ Rather than assuming a homogeneous distribution, pharmacologists should reckon with a very inhomogeneous distribution of catecholamines in the extracellular space, low in the immediate neighbourhood of „sites of loss“ such as transporters and enzymes, considerably higher at a distance.|$|E

Dystrophin, a structural protein, connects the sarcomere, sarcolemma, and extracellular matrix components. Rapsyn is another protein that docks AChRs and structural proteins to the cytoskeleton.
