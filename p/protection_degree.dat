40|$|Enhancing MPLS QoS routing {{algorithms}} {{by using}} the Network <b>Protection</b> <b>Degree</b> paradigm. * Abstract- IP based networks still {{do not have the}} required degree of reliability required by new multimedia services, achieving such reliability will be crucial in {{the success or failure of}} the new Internet generation. Most of existing schemes for QoS routing do not take into consideration parameters concerning the quality of the protection, such as packet loss or restoration time. In this paper, we define a new paradigm to develop new protection strategies for building reliable MPLS networks, based on what we have called the Network <b>Protection</b> <b>Degree</b> (NPD). This NPD consists of an a priori evaluation, the Failure Sensibility Degree (FSD), which provides the failure probability and an a posteriori evaluation, the Failure Impact Degree (FID), to determine the impact on the network in case of failure. Having mathematical formulated these components, we point out the most relevant components. Experimental results demonstrate the benefits of the utilization of the NPD, when used to enhance some current QoS routing algorithms to offer a certain degree of protection. I...|$|E

40|$|Indoor {{building}} materials and inventory, e. g. wood panelling, furnitures, books and paintings, {{are subject to}} degradation from solar radiation through window panes and other glass structures. Especially ultraviolet light and short-wave visible light are liable for this material degradation. Hence, {{it is important to}} select window panes and glass structures which give adequate protection towards the incoming sun rays. In order to measure and calculate the capability of glass to protect indoor materials from degradation caused by the solar radiation, the quantity Solar Material Protection Factor (SMPF) is introduced. Comparison of the SMPF values for different glass fabrications, e. g. with various applied coatings, enables one to select the most appropriate glass materials for the specific buildings. Numerical examples are shown with measurements and calculations carried out on various glass materials, including an electrochromic window (ECW) device, and several two-layer and three-layer window pane combinations. In addition, as to be transparent is the primary function of windows, visibility levels at various <b>protection</b> <b>degrees</b> are also given...|$|R

40|$|Corrosion of {{reinforced}} concrete structures {{is a major}} problem throughout the world, demanding significant amounts for repair and rehabilitation. Corrosion protection is commonly performed by coating the concrete or by using corrosion inhibitors. This paper describes the comparative evaluation of the effectiveness of an acrylic dispersion and an inorganic coating on silicate basis, of an alkanolamine-based corrosion inhibitor and of their combination, on reinforced mortar specimens partially immersed in 3. 5 % NaCl solution. The following techniques were used: strain gauges, measurements of the corrosion potential, the mass loss and the EIS of the reinforcing bars and measurements of the chloride diffusion and the carbonation depth in mortars. Results demonstrate that the simultaneous use of the alkanolamine-based corrosion inhibitor with the inorganic coating offers a <b>protection</b> <b>degree</b> comparable to that of the acrylic dispersion, which performs best in the presence of both chloride ions and carbon dioxide.

Sivas City provides {{a portion of}} the drinking and potable water with the average flow (Q) of 880 l/s from groundwater (underground drainage) in the valley. The springs in this valley are generally located in the northwest and south of the valley. There is no single exit point of Tavra Springs. Some springs flow in the form of surface stream (surface water). The groundwater flow was measured in the collection chamber downstream of the valley. This study was conducted {{in order to determine the}} spring field and the protection of the borders of the Tavra Springs in accordance with “The Communication about Drinking Water Supply and the Aquifer Protection of Sources” protocol published in 10 th October 2012, [10]. According to the reports in this type of springs, “Absolute Protection Area” is accepted to be 50 meters. Additionally, “First <b>Degree</b> <b>Protection</b> Area” is defined as an area beginning from “Absolute Protection Border” to the distance travelled by the infiltrated water into the aquifer in 10 days. In order to calculate the border of “First <b>Degree</b> <b>Protection</b> Area” of the Tavra Spring, one borehole having 35 meter in depth was drilled 130 m away from the upstream springs. The salt solution (500 kg salt/ 2000 l water) with electrical conductivity (EC) value of 222. 000 μS/cm was injected and the changes in the electrical conductivity were then tested and monitored in the downstream springs. Moreover, this area was estimated by using the empirical equations derived from Darcy's formula. The results of these two methods (testing-monitoring, empirical estimation) were compared. As a main result of this study, the distance between “Absolute Protection Area” and “First <b>Degree</b> <b>Protection</b> Area” was determined to be 437 meters...|$|R
