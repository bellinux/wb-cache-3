6000|$|... "Oh, yes; I'm sure of that. I've {{always said}} {{it was quite a}} <b>pleasure</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>you</b> and your uncle together. And when we heard about your all having to leave--" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "We will {{but look}} on," [...] Albert said, with a smile. [...] "We supped at Bruges at half-past nine, {{but it will}} be a <b>pleasure</b> indeed <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>you</b> eat it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Cold—he's quite cold, {{under the}} feathers! I think a wood-pigeon must enjoy being fought for—and being won {{especially}} if the right one won. It would be a fine <b>pleasure</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> them fighting—don't <b>you</b> think?" [...] she said, torturing him.|$|R
6000|$|... "Do not trouble {{yourself}} about that, Captain Dave," [...] Cyril said. [...] "You {{came to my}} help last time, {{and it will be}} my {{turn this}} time. I am sure that I shall have no difficulty in getting any monies that may be required from Mr. Goldsworthy, and there is nothing that will give me more <b>pleasure</b> than <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>you</b> established again in the place that was the first where I ever felt I had a home." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Captain Cuffe, I hope I {{have the}} <b>pleasure</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>you</b> well. Sir William joins the admiral in hoping {{you will make}} one of our little family party to-day at dinner, and--" ...|$|E
6000|$|... ‘It is well,’ he said. ‘Be seated. I {{should be}} glad to hear some news—if that can be called news that is already twenty years old—of how I have the <b>pleasure</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>you</b> here.’ ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Then why don't {{you listen}} to me? I would not persevere for a moment longer if it were against the wishes of your family. Your uncle says it would give him <b>pleasure</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>you</b> accept me.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Why should I be angry? Had {{the idea}} been distasteful to me I should have declined. I know not why, {{but it is}} a sort of <b>pleasure</b> <b>to</b> me <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>you.</b> It is a poor time we women have,--is it not,--in {{becoming}} playthings to men? So this Lothario that was once mine, is behaving badly to you also. Is it so? He is no longer mine, and you may ask me freely for aid, if there be any that I can give you. If he were an American I should say that he had behaved badly to me;--but as he is an Englishman perhaps it is different. Now tell me;--what can I do, or what can I say?' ...|$|R
5000|$|However, he {{says that}} he was [...] "a very bad student" [...] with abysmal grades in most classes, except for mental arithmetic. After one session of mental arithmetic, his master said teasingly, [...] "Sassoon, it is a <b>pleasure</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> that <b>you</b> have gaps of {{intelligence}} between bouts of ignorance." [...] He took a volunteer job as a choir boy for the local synagogue, which gave him one of the few chances <b>to</b> <b>see</b> his mother who would come on Saturdays.|$|R
6000|$|The old man {{placed his}} two {{hands on her}} shoulders, looked at her a moment with extreme benevolence and then gallantly kissed her. [...] "It's a great <b>pleasure</b> <b>to</b> me <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>you</b> here; but I wish you had given {{us a chance to}} receive you." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It is well," [...] he said. [...] "Be seated. I {{should be}} glad to hear some news--if that can be called news that is already twenty years old--of how I have the <b>pleasure</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>you</b> here." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It's quiet here," [...] he said; [...] "you mustn't {{come down}} {{if you find}} it dull. But it's a <b>pleasure</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>you.</b> My little sweet is the only face which gives me any pleasure, except yours." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, Mister Botanist, sorry I can't say {{it gives}} me <b>pleasure</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>you.</b> I wonder you're not ashamed {{to return to the}} country of the great chief Unaco after running away from him as you did." ...|$|E
5000|$|... "I've got {{friends who}} are armed with magnums, they don't get their money from me, coz it never is no kind of <b>pleasure</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> {{somebody}} suffer <b>you</b> see" [...] - a reference to Alex's minder/bodyguard John Miller, who once tried to capture Ronnie Biggs and bring him to justice.|$|R
6000|$|Hush! my heedless {{feet from}} under [...] Slip the {{crumbling}} banks for ever: [...] Like echoes {{to a distant}} thunder, [...] 55 [...] They plunge into the gentle river.

'tis such a <b>pleasure</b> [...] <b>To</b> <b>see</b> <b>you</b> move beneath the moon, [...] I would it were your true delight [...] To sleep by day and wake all night.|$|R
6000|$|... "It {{is a great}} <b>pleasure</b> for me <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>you</b> again, Mr Egremont;" [...] {{said the}} worthy baronet. [...] "Your father was my {{earliest}} and kindest friend. I remember you at Firebrace, a very little boy. Happy <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>you</b> again, Sir, in so eminent a position; a legislator--one of our legislators. It gave me a sincere satisfaction to observe your return." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh! two months, or more. I can't tell you, Colonel, unless I {{look at the}} books, with so many sick men {{coming and}} going. Shure! it's a <b>pleasure</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>you</b> {{yourself}} again. We thought that perhaps you'd never wake up reasonably." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'I {{am sorry}} to trouble you about such things,' said Tancred, in a hesitating voice, 'but perhaps I {{may not have the}} great <b>pleasure</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>you</b> again, and Lord Eskdale said that I was to speak to you about some letters of credit.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "For goodness' sake, no!" [...] John implored. [...] "I {{have never}} seen one of them act, and my French is appalling. I am all right, dear. It's quite enough <b>pleasure</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>you</b> looking so beautiful, {{and to think that}} I am going to be allowed to drive you home afterward." ...|$|E
6000|$|Yet another word. As years gather upon me, I {{naturally}} {{look forward}} [...] {{to what is}} to be after I am gone; and although I should indeed be [...] sorry to do or say anything having a tendency to force the action [...] of your mind beyond its natural course, it will indeed be a great [...] <b>pleasure</b> <b>to</b> me <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>you</b> well settled in life by marriage. Well [...] settled, I feel confident, you will be, if settled at all. In your [...] position at Hawarden, there would then be at once increased ease [...] and increased attraction in the performance of your duties; nor can [...] I overlook the fact that the life of the unmarried man, in this age [...] particularly, is under peculiar and insidious temptations to [...] selfishness, unless his celibacy arise from a very strong and [...] definite course of self-devotion to the service of God and his [...] fellow creatures.|$|R
6000|$|... "In {{the first}} place, {{it has given}} me great <b>pleasure</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> that <b>you</b> were able to exert {{yourself}} in company, and that the crowd of people did not annoy you: but I have chiefly been delighted by seeing that you and Adolphus are such good friends. You must think, Fanny, that I am anxious about an only brother--especially when we have all had so much cause to be anxious about him; and don't you think {{it must be a}} delight to me to find that he is able <b>to</b> take <b>pleasure</b> in your society? I should be doubly pleased, doubly delighted, if I could please him myself. But I have not the vivacity to amuse him." ...|$|R
6000|$|But {{whatever}} {{there might}} be of the too superior in this speech moved Caspar Goodwood's admiration; {{there was nothing he}} winced at in the large air of it. He had never supposed she hadn't wings and the need of beautiful free movements--he wasn't, with his own long arms and strides, afraid of any force in her. Isabel's words, if they had been meant to shock him, failed of the mark and only made him smile with the sense that here was common ground. [...] "Who would wish less to curtail your liberty than I? What can give me greater <b>pleasure</b> than <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>you</b> perfectly independent--doing whatever you like? It's to make you independent that I want to marry you." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Ah, Meester Tansee," [...] he said, with a sultry {{fire in his}} silky, black eyes, [...] "I {{give myself}} <b>pleasure</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>you</b> this evening. Meester Tansee, you have many times come to eat at my table. I theenk you a safe man--a verree good friend. How much would it please you to leeve forever?" ...|$|E

"Goot-morrow {{morning to}} ye, Leddy Staunton, and I hope I hae the <b>pleasure</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>you</b> weel--And goot-morrow to you, goot Mrs. Putler--I do peg you will order some victuals and ale and prandy for the lads, for we hae peen out on firth and moor since afore daylight, and a' to no purpose neither--Cot tam!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "With pleasure, my dear Fitz Jarndyce," [...] she {{was careful}} to explain. [...] "Not the least pain. <b>Pleasure</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>you</b> well again. Pleasure at having the honour of being {{admitted}} to see you. I am so much fonder of you, my love, than of the Chancellor. Though I DO attend court regularly. By the by, my dear, mentioning pocket handkerchiefs--" ...|$|E
6000|$|You {{will write}} to me? I am solitary, and I never felt {{solitude}} irksome [...] before. Your {{anxiety about the}} critique on----'s book is amusing; as [...] it was anonymous, certes it was of little consequence: I wish it had [...] produced a little more confusion, being a lover of literary malice. [...] Are you doing nothing? writing nothing? printing nothing? why not your [...] Satire on Methodism? the subject (supposing the public to be blind to [...] merit) would do wonders. Besides, {{it would be as}} well for a destined [...] deacon to prove his orthodoxy.--It really would give me <b>pleasure</b> <b>to</b> [...] <b>see</b> <b>you</b> properly appreciated. I say really, as, being an author, my [...] humanity might be suspected.|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{have spoken}} well, White Lily," [...] said she. [...] "Why should {{you wait until}} it is their <b>pleasure</b> <b>to</b> pluck <b>you.</b> <b>See,</b> already the glare of their fire beats upon the tree-trunks, {{and you can hear}} the howlings of those who thirst for your blood. If you die by your own hands, they will be robbed of their spectacle, and their chief will have lost his bride. So you will be the victors in the end, and they the vanquished. You have said rightly, White Lily. There lies the only path for you!" ...|$|R
6000|$|Aug. 30.—I am much {{concerned}} to lose {{at the last}} moment the [...] <b>pleasure</b> of coming <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>you</b> at Trentham—but my wife, who was not [...] quite well when I came away but hoped a day’s rest would make her [...] so, writes through Agnes to say she hopes I shall get back to-day. [...] The gratification promised me must, therefore, I fear, stand over. [...] I will write from Hawarden, and I now send this by a messenger [...] lest (as you might be sure I should not fail through carelessness) [...] you should think anything very bad had happened. Among other [...] things, I wanted help from you through speech about Tennyson. I [...] find Maud takes a good deal of trouble to understand, and is [...] hardly worth understanding. It has many peculiar beauties, but [...] against them one sets the strange and nearly frantic passages [...] about war; which one can hardly tell whether he means to be taken [...] for sense or ravings. Frank Doyle, who is essentially a poet [...] though an unwrought one, declares Guinevere the finest poem of [...] modern times.|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{will find}} Doctor Anstruther very feeble," [...] said the nurse, [...] "for he has {{suffered}} greatly. But I am {{sure it will}} give him <b>pleasure</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>you</b> again. I hope he will recognize you. I scarcely recognized you, myself, you have changed so much since last we saw you at the Voltaire. Your resemblance to your mother is quite marked, however." ...|$|E
6000|$|He took Fergus {{a little}} apart {{and spoke to}} him very earnestly {{for two or three}} minutes, and then {{returning}} to Waverley, said, 'I believe I have satisfied Colonel Mac-Ivor that his resentment was founded upon a misconception, to which, indeed, I myself gave rise; and I trust Mr. Waverley is too generous to harbour any recollection of what is past when I assure him that such is the case. You must state this matter properly to your clan, Vich Ian Vohr, to prevent a recurrence of their precipitate violence.' Fergus bowed. 'And now, gentlemen, let me have the <b>pleasure</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>you</b> shake hands.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Dear Sir," [...] it began, [...] "we are all {{naturally}} {{very much}} interested in {{the wreck of the}} Flying Scud, and as soon as I mentioned that I had the pleasure of making your acquaintance, a very general wish was expressed that you would come and dine on board. It will give us all the greatest <b>pleasure</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>you</b> to-night, or in case you should be otherwise engaged, to luncheon either to-morrow or to-day." [...] A note of the hours followed, and the document wound up with the name of [...] "J. Lascelles Sebright," [...] under an undeniable statement that he was sincerely mine.|$|E
40|$|It {{gives me}} great {{pleasure}} {{that so many}} distinguished colleagues, many of you old friends, have gathered here for a conference associated with my near-centennial, my reaching the age of fourscore years. It is a <b>pleasure</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> all of <b>you</b> and {{to listen to what}} you have to say. I have been asked to make some remarks too, and I thought hard about what would be appropriate. The result was a decision not to present a paper on some of the research that I'm carrying out, but rather to mention a few of the things I have learned about doing research in theoretical science, things I wish someone had explained to me around 60 years ago. The one I should like to emphasize particularly {{has to do with the}} frequently encountered need to go against certain received ideas. Sometimes these ideas are taken for granted all over the world and sometimes they prevail only in some broad region or in certain institutions. Often they have a negative character and they amount to prohibitions of thinking along certain lines. Now we know that most challenges to scientific orthodoxy are wrong and many are crank. Now and then, however, the only way to make progress is to defy one of those prohibitions that are uncritically accepted without good reason...|$|R
6000|$|Before going further {{consider}} well {{whether this}} {{is or is not}} your position. If it is, it is a position that neither the President himself, nor any friend of his, so far as I know, has ever taken. Their only positions are--first, that the soil was ours when the hostilities commenced; and second, that whether it was rightfully ours or not, Congress had annexed it, and the President for that reason was bound to defend it; both of which are as clearly proved to be false in fact as you can prove that your house is mine. The soil was not ours, and Congress did not annex or attempt to annex it. But to return to your position. Allow the President to invade a neighboring nation whenever he shall deem it necessary to repel an invasion, and you allow him to do so whenever he may choose to say he deems it necessary for such purpose, and you allow him to make war at <b>pleasure.</b> Study <b>to</b> <b>see</b> if <b>you</b> can fix any limit to his power in this respect, after having given him so much as you propose. If to-day he should choose to say he thinks it necessary to invade Canada to prevent the British from invading us, how could you stop him? You may say <b>to</b> him,--"I <b>see</b> no probability of the British invading us"; but he will say to you, [...] "Be silent: I <b>see</b> it, if <b>you</b> don't." ...|$|R
60|$|This week London {{has been}} {{enormously}} {{excited by the}} Imperial Press Conference. I was rather struck by the extraordinarily small attention, almost amounting to nothing, {{that was given to}} the Dominion that you here are concerned with. No doubt an Imperial Conference raises one or two very delicate questions, as to whether common citizenship is to be observed, or whether the relations between India and the Colonies should remain what they are. I am not going to expatiate upon that to-night, but it did occur to me in reading all these proceedings that the part of Hamlet was rather omitted, because India after all is the only real Empire. You there have an immense Dominion, an almost countless population, governed by foreign rulers. That is what constitutes an Empire. I observed it all with a rather grim feeling in my mind, that, if anything goes wrong in India, the whole of {{what we are talking about}} now, the material and military conditions of the Empire as a whole, might be strangely altered and convulsed. One of the happy qualities of youth--and there is no <b>pleasure</b> greater than <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>you</b> in that blissful stage, for one who has passed beyond, long beyond it--is not to be, I think I am right, in a hurry, not to be too anxious either for the present or future measure of the responsibilities of life and a career. You will forgive me if I remind you of what I am sure you all know--that the civil government of 230,000,000 persons in British India is in the hands of some 1,200 men who belong to the Indian Civil Service. Let us follow that. Any member of a body so small must be rapidly placed in a position of command, and it is almost startling to me, when I look round on the fresh physiognomies of those who are going out, and the not less fresh physiognomies of those who have returned, to think of the contrast between your position, and that, we will say, of some of your Oxford contemporaries who are lawyers, and who have to spend ever so many years in chambers in Lincoln's Inn or the Temple waiting for briefs that do not come. Contrast your position with that of members who enter the Home Civil Service, an admirable phalanx; but still for a very long time a member who enters that service has to pursue the minor and slightly mechanical routine of Whitehall. You will not misunderstand me, because nobody knows better than a Minister how tremendous is the debt that he owes to the permanent officials of his department. Certainly I have every reason to be the last man to underrate that. Well, any of you may be rapidly placed in a position of real command with inexorable responsibilities. I am speaking in the presence of men who know better than I do, all the details, but it is true that one of you in a few years may be placed in command of a district and have 1,000,000 human beings committed to his charge. He may have to deal with a famine; he may have to deal with a riot; he may take a decision on which the lives of thousands of people may depend. Well, I think that early call to responsibility, to a display of energy, to the exercise of individual decision and judgment is what makes the Indian Civil Service a grand career. And that is what has produced an extraordinary proportion of remarkable men in that service.|$|R
