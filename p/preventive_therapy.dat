5|$|Measures {{to prevent}} {{opportunistic}} infections {{are effective in}} many people with HIV/AIDS. In addition to improving current disease, treatment with antiretrovirals {{reduces the risk of}} developing additional opportunistic infections. Adults and adolescents who are living with HIV (even on anti-retroviral therapy) with no evidence of active tuberculosis in settings with high tuberculosis burden should receive isoniazid <b>preventive</b> <b>therapy</b> (IPT), the tuberculin skin test can be used to help decide if IPT is needed. Vaccination against hepatitis A and B is advised for all people at risk of HIV before they become infected; however it may also be given after infection. Trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole prophylaxis between four and six weeks of age and ceasing breastfeeding in infants born to HIV positive mothers is recommended in resource limited settings. It is also recommended to prevent PCP when a person's CD4 count is below 200cells/uL and in those who have or have previously had PCP. People with substantial immunosuppression are also advised to receive prophylactic therapy for toxoplasmosis and MAC. Appropriate preventive measures have reduced the rate of these infections by 50% between 1992 and 1997. Influenza vaccination and pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine are often recommended in people with HIV/AIDS with some evidence of benefit.|$|E

500|$|Community {{participation}} and health education strategies promoting awareness of malaria {{and the importance}} of control measures have been successfully used to reduce the incidence of malaria in some areas of the developing world. [...] Recognizing the disease in the early stages can prevent the disease from becoming fatal. [...] Education can also inform people to cover over areas of stagnant, still water, such as water tanks that are ideal breeding grounds for the parasite and mosquito, thus cutting down the risk of the transmission between people. This is generally used in urban areas where there are large centers of population in a confined space and transmission would be most likely in these areas. Intermittent <b>preventive</b> <b>therapy</b> is another intervention that has been used successfully to control malaria in pregnant women and infants, and in preschool children where transmission is seasonal.|$|E

40|$|The author {{comments}} on three {{issues raised by}} Dr. Kenneth G.

First, because the method by which the results of clinical trials are presented markedly affects the perception of those results some measure of absolute benefit and harm must be used when the results of clinical trials are presented. Second, there is increasing interest in decision aids as a means of helping patients to understand evidence and make therapeutic choices. It is important that these aids undergo rigorous testing before they are adopted for common use. Third, evidence-based clinical practice guidelines are a welcome resource for busy clinicians. However, physicians and patients should bear in mind that interpretations of the available evidence can vary, leading to different conclusions about the appropriateness of <b>preventive</b> <b>therapies...</b>|$|R

40|$|Background Stroke is {{the main}} cause of {{disability}} in high income countries and ranks second as a cause of death worldwide. Infections occur frequently after stroke and may adversely affect outcome. <b>Preventive</b> antibiotic <b>therapy</b> in the acute phase of stroke may reduce infections and improve outcome. Objectives 1. To assess whether <b>preventive</b> antibiotic <b>therapy</b> in patients with acute stroke reduces the risk of dependency and death at follow-up. 2. To assess whether <b>preventive</b> antibiotic <b>therapy</b> in patients with acute stroke reduces infection rate. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Stroke Group's Trials Register (October 2010); The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library 2010, Issue 3); MEDLINE (1950 to October 2010) and EMBASE (1980 to October 2010). In an effort to identify further published, unpublished and ongoing trials we searched trials and research registers, scanned reference lists and contacted authors, colleagues and researchers in the field. Selection criteria Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of <b>preventive</b> antibiotic <b>therapy</b> versus control (placebo or open control) in patients with acute ischaemic or haemorrhagic stroke. Data collection and analysis Two authors independently selected articles and performed data extraction; we discussed and resolved discrepancies in a consensus meeting with a third observer. We contacted the study authors to obtain missing data when required. An independent observer assessed methodological quality. We calculated relative risks (RRs) for dichotomous outcomes, assessed heterogeneity amongst included studies and performed subgroup analyses on study quality. Main results We included five studies involving 506 patients. Study population, study design, type of antibiotic and definition of infection differed considerably. The number of patients who died in the preventive antibiotic group was non-significantly reduced (33 / 248 (13 %) versus 38 / 258 (15 %), RR 0. 85, 95 % confidence interval (CI) 0. 47 to 1. 51); the number of dependent patients in the <b>preventive</b> antibiotic <b>therapy</b> group was also non-significantly reduced (97 / 208 (47 %) versus 127 / 208 (61 %), RR 0. 67, 95 % CI 0. 32 to 1. 43). <b>Preventive</b> antibiotic <b>therapy</b> did reduce the incidence of infections in patients with acute stroke from 36 % to 22 % (36 / 166 (22 %) versus 61 / 169 (36 %), RR 0. 58, 95 % CI 0. 43 to 0. 79). No major side-effects of <b>preventive</b> antibiotic <b>therapy</b> were reported.
