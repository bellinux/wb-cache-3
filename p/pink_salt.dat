50|$|Evan hansimikali bought Bella's {{share of}} the {{business}} in 2010. <b>Pink</b> <b>Salt</b> in Double Bay has been operating for over nine years and Evan hansimikali now runs <b>Pink</b> <b>Salt</b> on his own. In October 2014 Evan hansimikali temporarily closed <b>Pink</b> <b>Salt</b> for a complete renovation, new concept, new style of food and with a new team. The restaurant has received great reviews and this new <b>Pink</b> <b>Salt</b> seems to be thriving. The Sunday telegraph reviewer rated the restaurant very highly. Apart from <b>Pink</b> <b>Salt,</b> {{none of the other}} restaurants in series 1 or 2 are still operating.|$|E

2500|$|In 1842 Mosander also {{separated}} the yttria into three oxides: pure yttria, terbia and erbia (all {{the names are}} derived from the town name [...] "Ytterby"). The earth giving <b>pink</b> <b>salts</b> he called terbium; the one that yielded yellow peroxide he called erbium.|$|R
25|$|Nils Johan Berlin and Marc Delafontaine tried also to {{separate}} the crude yttria and found the same substances that Mosander obtained, but Berlin named (1860) the substance giving <b>pink</b> <b>salts</b> erbium, and Delafontaine named the substance with the yellow peroxide terbium. This confusion led to several false claims of new elements, such as the mosandrium of J. Lawrence Smith, or the philippium and decipium of Delafontaine.|$|R

50|$|One of {{the most}} common curing salts. It is also called Insta Cure #1 or <b>Pink</b> curing <b>salt</b> #1. It {{contains}} 6.25% sodium nitrite and 93.75% table salt. It is recommended for meats that require short cures and will be cooked and eaten relatively quickly. Sodium nitrite provides the characteristic flavor and color associated with curing.|$|R

5000|$|The final {{assessment}} {{was done by}} the judges, on the original criteria, and their visit was expected and announced. One of the judges was upset by Pink Salt's [...] "cheeky" [...] waitress Anna, and subsequently, gave them a low service score. Ultimately, <b>Pink</b> <b>Salt</b> ended up in the bottom two restaurants to face the public vote for potential elimination, and were joined by Whisk.|$|E
50|$|In addition, despite Sydney's {{defeat in}} series two, contestants Evan hansimikali and Bella of <b>Pink</b> <b>Salt</b> {{opened a new}} {{restaurant}} (under the same name) on 22 March 2006, at a new location in Double Bay from the original suburb of Manly.

50|$|Also called <b>Pink</b> curing <b>salt</b> #2. It {{contains}} 6.25% sodium nitrite, 4% {{sodium nitrate}}, and 89.75% table salt. The sodium nitrate found in Prague powder #2 gradually breaks down over time into sodium nitrite, {{and by that}} time a dry cured sausage is ready to be eaten, no sodium nitrate should be left. For this reason it is recommended for meats that require long (weeks to months) cures, like hard salami and country ham.|$|R

50|$|One {{study has}} found a {{correlation}} between highly frequent ingestion of meats cured with <b>pink</b> <b>salt</b> and the COPD form of lung disease. The study's researchers suggest that the high amount of nitrites in the meats was responsible; however, the team did not prove the nitrite theory. Additionally, the study does not prove that nitrites or cured meat caused higher rates of COPD, merely a link. The researchers did adjust for many of COPD's risk factors, but they commented they cannot rule out all possible unmeasurable causes or risks for COPD.|$|E
5000|$|Both <b>Pink</b> <b>Salt,</b> and The Greedy Goose {{faced the}} final public vote, {{as they were}} the last {{remaining}} restaurants. This marked Pink Salt's third time facing the public vote, {{more than any other}} restaurant for the season (falling short of Room Nineteen's record of four elimination survivals, and eventual win in season one). Adelaide faced the public vote for the first time, and were believed to be disadvantaged in that they were inexperienced in promoting themselves. They used The Giant Rocking Horse in Gumeracha, and the Giant Orange to hold banners for their support.|$|E
50|$|Curing salts {{are used}} in food {{preservation}} to prevent or slow spoilage by bacteria or fungus. Generally they are used for pickling meats {{as part of the}} process to make sausage or cured meat. Curing salts are generally a mixture of table salt and sodium nitrite, which serves to inhibit the growth of bacteria, specifically Clostridium botulinum in an effort to prevent botulism, and helps preserve the color of cured meat. Many also contain red dye that makes them pink to prevent them from being confused with common table salt. Curing salts are {{not to be confused with}} Himalayan <b>pink</b> <b>salt,</b> which is pure salt with trace elements that give it a pink color.|$|E

50|$|The company sells over 110 {{varieties}} of <b>salts,</b> including <b>pink</b> Himalayan <b>salt,</b> smoked salts, {{black and white}} truffle salts, Fleur de sel, kosher salt and more.

SaltWorks uses a combination of sifters, aspirators, and rare-earth magnets to detect and filter unwanted materials from its salt. SaltWorks fabricates most of its processing equipment on-site. The company does not use anti-caking agents or artificial flavors. All SaltWorks salts are certified kosher.|$|R

40|$|This {{thesis is}} largely devoted to {{solid-state}} NMR (SSNMR) studies of insensitive nuclei, which are challenging to study via conventional NMR experiments {{due to their}} low natural abundances, low gyromagnetic ratios, and/or anisotropically broadened powder patterns. SSNMR experiments on insensitive nuclei such as 195 Pt, 89 Y, 65 Cu, 35 Cl, and 14 N hold much promise for elucidation of structure and bonding within inorganic and organometallic systems. Herein, I describe the use of novel NMR pulse sequences and acquisition methodologies, in combination with X-ray diffraction (XRD) techniques and quantum chemical calcuations of NMR interaction tensors, for this purpose. This thesis begins with a brief introduction to NMR, followed by a proof-of-concept multinuclear (195 Pt, 14 N, 35 Cl) study on cisplatin and several related square-planar Pt(II) species. This work is extended to the structural determination of Magnus 2 ̆ 7 <b>Pink</b> <b>Salt,</b> in conjunction with refinements of powder XRD data and ab initio calculations. Two further applications of 195 Pt solid-state NMR follow: determination of Pt oxidation state and coordination with hexadentate ligands, and investigation of Pt vapochromism in the Pt(bpy) CN 2 system. NMR experiments involving insensitive 89 Y nuclei, in conjunction with 19 F NMR and powder XRD data, are applied for the structural elucidation of (H 3 O) Y 3 F 10 *x H 2 O nanoparticles. Lastly, the use of 65 Cu and 31 P SSNMR for investigation {{of a series of}} bis(triphenylphosphine) copper(I) complexes is described. A wide variety of materials may be characterized using information derived from SSNMR experiments on insensitive nuclei, in concert with a combination of complementary techniques...|$|E

5000|$|Rock salts {{originate}} in mines, {{which are a}} result of evaporation of earlier seas. These bodies of salt have been around for millions of years. Salt mines have the capacity to hold more than 350,000 tons of salt at a time. Salt is extracted from these bodies through [...] "cut and blast mining" [...] or [...] "continuous mining". [...] "Cut and blast mining" [...] requires cutting holes into the rock and charging them with explosives. [...] "Continuous mining" [...] requires using a machine to extract chunks of rock. Both processes are completed with crushing the extracted pieces to achieve small grains. Sherpa <b>Pink</b> Himalayan <b>Salt</b> and Epsoak Epsom Salts are both rock salts.|$|R
5000|$|Some gourmets believe {{sea salt}} tastes better {{and has a}} better texture than {{ordinary}} table salt. In applications that retain sea salt's coarser texture, it can provide a different mouth feel, and may change flavor due to its different rate of dissolution. The mineral content also affects the taste. The colors and variety of flavors are due to local clays and algae found in the waters the salt is harvested from. For example, some boutique salts from Korea and France are pinkish gray, some from India are black. Black and red salts from Hawaii may even have powdered black lava and baked red clay added in. Some sea salt contains sulfates. [...] It {{may be difficult to}} distinguish sea salt from other <b>salts,</b> such as <b>pink</b> Himalayan <b>salt,</b> Maras salt from the ancient Inca hot springs, or rock salt (halite).|$|R
