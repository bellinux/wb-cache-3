The development of the interdisciplinary perspective into an “interdisciplinary-disciplinary” perspective is supported by the instrument of “seed texts,” a metaphor that refers to the development of disciplinary texts influenced by interdisciplinary discussions. Under the aspect of quality assurance, it is important to preserve the disciplinary compatibility. At the same time, the seed texts are modified regarding the argumentative support of the resulting recommendations: Therefore, these recommendations are based in a comprehensible way on interdisciplinarily developed lines of arguments.

40|$|Polyethersulfone (PES) based {{membranes}} {{are used}} for dialysis, but exposure to blood can result in numerous interactions between the blood elements and the membrane. Adsorption and transformation of plasma proteins, activation of blood cells, adherence of platelets and thrombosis reactions against PES membrane can invoke severe blood reactions causing the increase rate of mortality and morbidity of hemodialysis (HD) patients. In order to minimize blood immune response, different biomimetic, zwitterionic, non-ionic, anticoagulant molecules and hydrophilic brushes were immobilized or blended with PES polymers. These additives modified {{the nature of the}} membrane, enhanced their biocompatibility and also increased the uremic waste dialysis properties. In this review, current <b>perspectives</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>different</b> additives which are used with PES are highlighted in relation with PES membrane-associated blood reactions.

40|$|Abstract. Mangrove {{ecosystems}} are rapidly declining {{in many parts}} of the world. This has resulted in the loss of important environmental and economic products and services including forest products, flood mitigation and nursery grounds for fish. The aquaculture industry was the single biggest threat to mangroves in the Philippines until 1981 when conversion of the remaining mangrove stands was prohibited by law. However, the decreasing yield from capture fisheries is putting pressure for the re-examination of this policy. To understand the importance of mangroves, insight is needed into the value of products and services provided is needed. This article compares the costs and benefits of mangrove preservation with those generated by alternative uses such as aquaculture and forestry. Equity and sustainability objectives are taken into account, in addition to economic efficiency and analyzed according to the <b>perspectives</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>different</b> types of decision makers involved...|$|E

The security hole can be exploited to obtain manufacturer or even operator permissions. In particular, we implemented a Java-based Trojan horse. This way, the compromised mobile phone can be used as an eavesdropping device by an attacker. All in all, this demonstrates that the risks are not only theoretical, but also real.

40|$|MBA - WBSThe {{impact of}} HIV/AIDS on {{employee}} risk benefits represents {{a threat to}} the social security of the majority of South African employees. The economic dimension of the disease is manifested in prohibitive cost increases and declining value of employee risk benefits. The key challenge is to balance the need for adequate and affordable insurance for HIV positive employees, against the need to protect other employees from unfair risk distribution policies. This paper evaluates existing literature and considers the response of the insurance industry by looking at theoretical principles, historical lessons, scientific evidence, and the changing social environment, from the <b>perspectives</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>different</b> stakeholders. The consolidation of this work suggests that sustainable responses are best achieved by primarily exploring cost containment measures rather than cost shifting exercises.
