5|$|After {{the closure}} of the uranium mines in Elliot Lake, in 1990, the revenue <b>prospects</b> <b>of</b> the mall dropped sharply, with no {{recovery}} in sight. This prompted the Algoma Central Company to write off over $5 million in lost property value, despite 98% occupancy.|$|E
5|$|By the mid-1920s, Victoria worried {{over the}} <b>prospects</b> <b>of</b> her children. Maria, her eldest {{daughter}} married {{the head of}} one of Germany's mediatized families, Karl, Hereditary Prince of Leiningen on 25 November 1925, Victoria’s 49th birthday. Victoria was at her daughter's bedside when she gave birth to her first child, Emich Kirill, in 1926 (father of claimant to the Russian throne, Prince Karl Emich of Leiningen). She also attended the subsequent births of Maria's children.|$|E

5|$|Due to the {{abundance}} of insects and a worldwide concern of food shortages, the Food and Agriculture Organisation of the United Nations considers that the world may have to, in the future, regard the <b>prospects</b> <b>of</b> eating insects as a food staple. Insects are noted for their nutrients, having a high content of protein, minerals and fats and are eaten by one-third of the global population.|$|E
5|$|I Corps' {{part in the}} Western Desert Campaign was brief. Its {{headquarters}} opened near Benghazi on 15 February 1941, replacing British XIII Corps. Rowell {{studied the}} <b>prospects</b> <b>of</b> an advance on Tripoli, but the headquarters was recalled to Egypt on 24 February {{to participate in the}} Battle of Greece. Nonetheless, for his part, Rowell was mentioned in despatches, and appointed a Commander of the Order of the British Empire.|$|E
5|$|Silver Cross Field, {{which was}} built in 2002 to host the Joliet Jackhammers of the Northern League is located at 1 Mayor Art Schultz Drive. By 2007, <b>prospects</b> <b>of</b> {{continued}} growth necessitated that Joliet agree on borders with the neighboring municipality of Oswego and that it consider future borders with others.|$|E

5|$|Upon {{returning}} to England, Strange finds {{that one of}} Norrell's men, socialite Christopher Drawlight, has been stealing money from eager English citizens with <b>prospects</b> <b>of</b> fulfilling their wishes through Strange's magic. Drawlight disappears and is arrested by his former friend, Henry Lascelles. Norrell strongly wishes for Drawlight to be hanged for his crime, but Strange disagrees. Lascelles starts to become closer to Norrell, challenging the relationship between Childermass and his master.|$|E
5|$|Before {{the start}} of the match, much of the {{attention}} was placed on the weather forecast and the <b>prospects</b> <b>of</b> rain. In their 12 tour matches leading up to the Tests, Australia had been almost completely untroubled by the opposition except in the two matches against Yorkshire and Hampshire on rain-affected pitches. In these two matches they came close to defeat after heavy batting collapses before recovering to victory. It was thus thought that the toss could be of great importance, especially if the team batting first had accumulated a substantial total by the time rain came. The match was the first Ashes Test to be played on English soil since the end of World War II.|$|E

5|$|During {{the late}} 1950s, Hawker Siddeley Aviation (HSA) was keen {{to develop a}} new {{generation}} of combat aircraft that would be capable of supersonic speeds. Unfortunately, despite repeated attempts to revive the program, the in-development Hawker P.1121 fighter would ultimately be left unfinished, principally {{due to a lack of}} a political support for development following the release of the 1957 Defence White Paper by Minister of Defence Duncan Sandys. Recognising the need to promptly commence work on another development program, HSA's chief aircraft designer Sir Sydney Camm, who had been in regular discussions with Sir Stanley Hooker of Bristol Aero Engines, decided that the company should investigate the <b>prospects</b> <b>of</b> developing and manufacturing a viable combat-capable vertical take-off and landing (VTOL) fighter aircraft.|$|E
5|$|Hand {{had known}} that ruling against the {{government}} might harm his <b>prospects</b> <b>of</b> promotion. By {{the time of the}} case, he was already the most senior judge of his district. The United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit often summoned him to sit with that court to hear appeals, a task he found stimulating. In 1917, he lobbied for promotion to the Second Circuit, but the unpopularity of his Masses decision and his reputation as a liberal stood against him. He was passed over in favor of Martin T. Manton.|$|E
5|$|In 2007, KKR {{filed with}} the Securities and Exchange Commission to raise $1.25 billion by selling an {{ownership}} interest in its management company. The filing came {{less than two weeks}} after the initial public offering of rival private equity firm Blackstone Group. KKR had previously listed its KPE vehicle in 2006, but for the first time, KKR would offer investors an ownership interest in the management company itself. The onset of the credit crunch and the shutdown of the IPO market dampened the <b>prospects</b> <b>of</b> obtaining a valuation attractive to KKR. The flotation was repeatedly postponed, and called off by the end of August.|$|E

5|$|In April 1941, the National Defense Research Committee (NDRC) asked Arthur Compton, a Nobel-Prize-winning physics {{professor}} at the University of Chicago, {{to report on the}} uranium program. His report, submitted in May 1941, foresaw the <b>prospects</b> <b>of</b> developing radiological weapons, nuclear propulsion for ships, and nuclear weapons using uranium-235 or the recently discovered plutonium. In October he wrote another report on the practicality of an atomic bomb. Niels Bohr and John Wheeler had theorized that heavy isotopes with odd atomic numbers were fissile. If so, then plutonium-239 was likely to be.|$|E
5|$|In April 1941, the National Defense Research Committee (NDRC), {{created a}} special project headed by Arthur Compton, a Nobel-Prize-winning physics {{professor}} at the University of Chicago, {{to report on the}} uranium program. Compton's report, submitted in May 1941, foresaw the <b>prospects</b> <b>of</b> developing radiological weapons, nuclear propulsion for ships, and nuclear weapons using uranium-235 or the recently discovered plutonium. In October he wrote another report on the practicality of an atomic bomb. For this report, he worked with Fermi on calculations of the critical mass of uranium-235. He also discussed the prospects for uranium enrichment with Harold Urey.|$|E
5|$|In November1906 the American Robert Peary {{returned}} from his latest unsuccessful quest for the North Pole, claiming a new Farthest North of 87°6′—a record disputed by later historians. He immediately began raising funds for a further attempt. In July1907 Dr Frederick Cook, a former shipmate of Amundsen's from Belgica, set off northwards on what was ostensibly a hunting trip but was rumoured to be an attempt on the North Pole. A month later Ernest Shackleton's Nimrod Expedition sailed for Antarctica, while Robert Falcon Scott was preparing a further expedition should Shackleton fail. Amundsen {{saw no reason to}} concede priority in the south to the British, and spoke publicly about the <b>prospects</b> <b>of</b> leading an Antarctic expedition—although his preferred goal remained the North Pole.|$|E

5|$|In retrospect, {{being sent}} {{far from the}} Middle East (Egypt) he viewed as a parental {{decision}} much influenced by “the <b>prospects</b> <b>of</b> deracinated people, like us the Palestinians, being so uncertain {{that it would be}} best to send me as far away as possible.” The realities of peripatetic life—of interwoven cultures, of feeling out of place, and of homesickness—so affected the schoolboy Edward that themes of dissonance feature in the work and worldview of the academic Said. At school’s end, he had become Edward W. Said—a polyglot intellectual (fluent in English, French, and Arabic) who had earned a Bachelor of Arts (1957) degree at Princeton University, and Master of Arts (1960) and Doctor of Philosophy (1964) degrees in English Literature from Harvard University.|$|E
5|$|In {{the main}} lines the pawn push c4–c5 often brings {{positional}} gains to White. In the Rubinstein variation 3...Ng4 4.Bf4 with 4...Nc6 5.Nf3 Bb4+ 6.Nbd2 Qe7 7.a3, after 7...Ngxe5 8.Nxe5 Nxe5 9.e3 Bxd2+ 10.Qxd2 (see diagram at right) White gets the bishop pair and a space advantage. In {{order to build}} up on these potential advantages, the most common plan is to perform a minority attack on the queenside, {{with the goal of}} performing the pawn advance c4–c5 in favourable conditions. This push can yield several advantages to White: it enhances the <b>prospects</b> <b>of</b> the light-square bishop, it creates a half-open file to attack with the rooks, and it creates an isolated, backward pawn on d6 after the exchange c5xd6.|$|E
5|$|In {{the months}} after the {{announcement}} that applications were being sought for the second group of NASA astronauts, Armstrong {{became more and more}} excited about the <b>prospects</b> <b>of</b> both the Apollo program and of investigating a new aeronautical environment. Armstrong's astronaut application arrived about a week past the June 1, 1962, deadline. Dick Day, with whom Armstrong had worked closely at Edwards, saw the late arrival of the application and slipped it into the pile before anyone noticed. At Brooks Air Force Base at the end of June, Armstrong underwent a medical exam that many of the applicants described as painful and at times seemingly pointless.|$|E
40|$|When {{exporting}} firms {{face the}} <b>prospect</b> <b>of</b> voluntary export restraints, {{they have an}} incentive to export more than with no <b>prospect</b> <b>of</b> a voluntary export restraint, since greater exports lead to larger license allocations {{in the event of a}} voluntary export restraint. Export-country governments' incentives differ, leading either to export tax or subsidy, depending on the circumstances. The <b>prospect</b> <b>of</b> one departure from free trade, thus, leads to another, a domino effect. Antidumping enforcement will ordinarily not eliminate and ironically may increase dumping.
