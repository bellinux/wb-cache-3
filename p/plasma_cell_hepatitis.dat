40|$|Hepatitis C virus (HCV) is {{the leading}} {{indication}} for liver transplantation in the United States. It recurs universally after transplant but the rate of fibrosis {{and the development of}} graft failure is variable. Different donor and recipient features have been demonstrated to impact fibrosis. <b>Plasma</b> <b>cell</b> <b>hepatitis,</b> a histologic finding, is one feature associated with poor graft and patient outcomes. The pathogenic mechanism resulting in <b>plasma</b> <b>cell</b> <b>hepatitis</b> is poorly understood, with evidence suggesting a role for both the HCV and the immune system. A recent publication described <b>plasma</b> <b>cell</b> <b>hepatitis</b> in a larger context of immune medicated graft dysfunction in transplant recipients receiving interferon based therapy.

40|$|The {{impact of}} donor-specific HLA alloantibodies (DSA) on short- and {{long-term}} liver transplant outcome is not clearly defined. While {{it is clear}} that not all levels of allosensitization produce overt clinical injury, and that liver allografts possess some degree of alloantibody resistance, alloantibody-mediated adverse consequences are increasingly being recognized. To better define the current state of this topic, we assembled experts to provide insights, explore controversies and develop recommendations for future research on the consequences of DSA in liver transplantation. This article summarizes the proceedings of this inaugural meeting. Several insights emerged. Acute antibody-mediated rejection (AMR), although rarely diagnosed, is increasingly understood to overlap with T cell-mediated rejection. Isolated liver allograft recipients are at increased risk of early allograft immunologic injury when preformed DSA are high titer and persist posttransplantation. Persons who undergo simultaneous liver-kidney transplantation are at risk of renal AMR when Class II DSA persist posttransplantation. Other under-appreciated DSA associations include ductopenia and fibrosis, <b>plasma</b> <b>cell</b> <b>hepatitis,</b> biliary strictures and accelerated fibrosis associated with recurrent liver disease. Standardized DSA testing and diagnostic criteria for both acute and chronic AMR are needed to distil existing associations into etiological processes in order to develop responsive therapeutic strategies...|$|E
40|$|IN 1950 Waldenstrom first drew {{attention}} to the occurrence of a form of chronic liver disease in young people, predominantly adolescent girls, in whom there was moderate jaundice, enlargement of the liver and spleen, acne, amenorrhoea and hyperglobulinaemia. The occurrence of fever, arthralgia and Cushingoid features was noted (Kunkel et al 1951, Beam et al 1956), the LE cell phenomenon was reported (Joske and King 1955) and the condition was called lupoid hepatitis (Mackay et al 1956). Over the years it has been given many other names including liver disease in young women l(Beam et al 1956) with hypergammaglobulinaemia (Jones and Castleman 1962), active juvenile cirrhosis (Read et al 1963), <b>plasma</b> <b>cell</b> <b>hepatitis</b> (Page et al 1964), autoclastic lupoid hepatitis (Naish 1960) and autoimmune hepatitis;(Mackay et al 1965), each emphasising particular pathological or clinical features. In recent years the term active chronic hepatitis has gained general acceptance because it embodies two of the essential pathological and clinical features of the disorder, namely its chronic and therefore usually progressive nature and the activity of the process typically manifested by the recurring episodes of hepatitis which punctuate its course. Lately Sherlock (1975), with a view to further refining the nomenclature of chronic hepatitis, has proposed that the classical type be called active chronic "lupoid " (HBAg negative) hepatitis. Although the main pathological process occurs in the liver the striking immunological disturbance and the wide spectrum of symptoms indicate that it is a systemic disease. Discussion continues on ithe role of altered immune responses in the pathogenesis of active chronic hepatitis, and the absence of a marker for the virus of hepatitis A has been a great obstacle to progress. It seems probable that liver cell damage caused by a variety of agents including drug...|$|E

40|$|Drug-induced liver injury {{may cause}} {{impairment}} of liver function {{and is a}} leading cause of acute liver failure. Identification of the causative substance in patients receiving several drugs is often difficult in clinical practice. Evaluation of liver biopsies in suspected drug-induced injury is a challenging task that requires close clinico-pathological correlation. Recognizing a characteristic morphological pattern of liver injury may contribute to identification of the causative drug. Flupirtine, a non-opioid analgesic, has been reported to cause liver injury of idiosyncratic type in rare instances. We wished to characterize the histopathological features of flupirtine-induced liver injury, which have not been reported so far. Liver biopsies of five patients with severe liver injury and one explanted liver of a patient with flupirtine-induced acute liver failure that required transplantation were assessed. In addition clinical presentation and course were reviewed and clinical follow up was performed. Extensive perivenular necrosis with associated ceroid pigment-laden macrophages and a mild to moderate lymphocytic infiltrate was a common feature in all cases. Histological extent of liver necrosis corresponded well to serum amino-transferase levels. Accidental reexposure of one patient resulted in a <b>plasma</b> <b>cell</b> rich <b>hepatitis</b> with perivenular necrosis. This study provides evidence that flupirtine can cause substantial liver injury of hepatocellular type. Liver damage is associated with a characteristic morphological picture, the recognition of which will aid in causality assessment of drug-induced liver injury.

40|$|Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) {{can cause}} {{frequently}} asymptomatic (or anicteric) and self-limited hepatitis, while occasionally {{may result in}} considerable cholestatic hepatitis. Herein, we describe {{the case of a}} previously healthy toddler (26 month old girl) with prolonged cholestasis, elevated serum transaminases, EBV serology compatible with recent EBV infection and positive anti liver kidney microsomal antibody type 1 which is characteristic of new-onset autoimmune hepatitis type 2. Liver biopsy was also typical of autoimmune hepatitis as attested by the presence of portal inflammation with predominant T-lymphocytes and <b>plasma</b> <b>cells</b> and interface <b>hepatitis.</b> Persistent EBV-related hepatitis was excluded by the absence of viral inclusions and steatosis on liver specimens and negative liver EBV-PCR. In conclusion, our case strongly suggests that in children with prolonged cholestatic hepatitis, positive EBV serology cannot exclude the presence of other causes of liver disease. In this context, autoimmune hepatitis should be considered as an alternate diagnosis, particularly when there is specific liver-related autoantibody detection. In such conditions, liver biopsy seems mandatory in an attempt to achieve a correct and timely diagnosis of a potentially catastrophic disease as autoimmune hepatitis. Although some cases of autoimmune hepatitis type 1 following EBV infection have been reported in adults, {{to the best of our}} knowledge, the present case of autoimmune hepatitis type 2 after EBV infection represents the first case in children ever reported in the English literature...|$|R

The present study aimed to verify the relationship between <b>plasma</b> <b>cells</b> and stellate <b>cells</b> in autoimmune <b>hepatitis.</b> Thirty-three pre-treatment, 11 post-treatment, and 10 normal liver biopsies were reviewed. Sirius Red staining (for semi-quantitative analysis of hepatic fibrosis) and immunohistochemistry were carried out: double staining for smooth muscle alpha-actin and <b>plasma</b> <b>cell</b> marker (for detection and localization of activated hepatic stellate <b>cells</b> and <b>plasma</b> <b>cells,</b> respectively); and single staining for glial fibrillary acid protein (for detection of hepatic stellate cells). We found {{an increase in the}} stellate cell population, mainly with an activated phenotype in autoimmune hepatitis, compared to the control group (liver specimens with no histological evidence of liver disease, obtained from patients undergoing hepatic resection for benign liver mass). A positive significant correlation was observed between stellate cells and scores of fibrosis (measured by Sirius Red) and the number of <b>plasma</b> <b>cells.</b> Additionally, there was a co-localization of <b>plasma</b> <b>cells</b> and activated stellate cells.

In <b>plasma</b> <b>cell</b> leukemia, however, circulating <b>plasma</b> <b>cells</b> reach far higher numbers and at these circulating levels are associated with exceptionally poor survival rates. The International Myeloma Working Group has defined the diagnostic criteria for <b>plasma</b> <b>cell</b> leukemia as the presence in blood of >2x109 <b>plasma</b> <b>cells</b> per liter or, alternatively, >20% of nucleated blood <b>cells</b> being <b>plasma</b> <b>cells.</b> More recently, the Group has suggested that values of 0.5x109 or 5%, respectively, may be more appropriate from a therapeutic viewpoint and therefore should be studied as a definitive criterion for the disease.

In contrast, our patient recalled a recent cytomegalovirus infection, which was confirmed serologically.

In this study, {{the basis for}} the abnormal <b>plasma</b> <b>cell</b> survival in NZB/W mice was investigated and different strategies for therapeutic depletion of these cells were tested. Analysis of the <b>plasma</b> <b>cell</b> compartments in IL- 6 -/- and FcγRIIb-/- mice together with in vitro results on the survival of isolated <b>plasma</b> <b>cells</b> of different mouse strains indicated that <b>plasma</b> <b>cell</b> autonomous factors may contribute to the increased survival, but could not solely explain this phenomenon. The frequency of long-lived <b>plasma</b> <b>cells</b> was much lower in the lymph nodes of NZB/W mice than in their spleens, though lymph node <b>plasma</b> <b>cells</b> exhibit all intrinsic pre-requisites to become long-lived. These results suggest that changes in the stromal environment of the spleen lead to an increased <b>plasma</b> <b>cell</b> survival in this organ. In accordance with this hypothesis, most splenic NZB/W <b>plasma</b> <b>cells</b> were found to be co-localized with SDF- 1 producing cells. Such cells are part of the <b>plasma</b> <b>cell</b> survival niche in the bone marrow. Additionally, in this study it was shown that about 40 % of all <b>plasma</b> <b>cells</b> are associated with megakaryocytes, which has never been reported so far. The numbers of megakaryocytes, though very rare in normal spleens, were increased in the spleens of autoimmune mice, which goes along with the increase of long-lived <b>plasma</b> <b>cells.</b> It is known that megakaryocytes produce multiple <b>plasma</b> <b>cell</b> survival factors.

When exposed to the right microenvironment these autoimmune <b>plasma</b> <b>cells</b> become long-lived and resistant to immunosuppressive treatment. Since autoimmune <b>plasma</b> <b>cells</b> have been detected in the salivary glands of SS patients, we wanted to investigate if the glandular microenvironment is suitable for <b>plasma</b> <b>cell</b> survival and if glandular residing <b>plasma</b> <b>cells</b> are the long-lived <b>plasma</b> <b>cell</b> subset.

Results: We detected significant numbers of CD 138 +, non-proliferating, Bcl- 2 expressing <b>plasma</b> <b>cells</b> in the salivary glands of pSS patients with high focus score (FS). Furthermore, we demonstrated that CXCL 12 and interleukin (IL) - 6 survival factors were highly expressed in pSS salivary gland epithelium and by focal mononuclear infiltrating cells. Notably, adipocytes when present in the salivary gland tissue were {{an important source of}} CXCL 12. We clearly demonstrate that <b>plasma</b> <b>cells</b> are localised in close proximity to CXCL 12 and IL- 6 expressing cells and thus that the environment of salivary glands with high FS provide factors vital for <b>plasma</b> <b>cell</b> survival. Conclusions: <b>Plasma</b> <b>cells</b> residing in the salivary glands of pSS patients with high FS showed phenotypic characteristics of the long-lived <b>plasma</b> <b>cell</b> subtype. Furthermore, the pSS salivary gland microenvironment provided niches rich in factors vital for <b>plasma</b> <b>cell</b> survival...|$|R
40|$|AbstractConventional models {{suggest that}} {{long-term}} antibody responses are {{maintained by the}} continuous differentiation of memory B <b>cells</b> into antibody-secreting <b>plasma</b> <b>cells.</b> This {{is based on the}} notion that <b>plasma</b> <b>cells</b> are short-lived and need to be continually replenished by memory B cells. We examined the issue of <b>plasma</b> <b>cell</b> longevity by following the persistence of LCMV-specific antibody and <b>plasma</b> <b>cell</b> numbers after in vivo depletion of memory B cells and by adoptive transfer of virus-specific <b>plasma</b> <b>cells</b> into naive mice. The results show that a substantial fraction of <b>plasma</b> <b>cells</b> can survive and continue to secrete antibody for extended periods of time (> 1 year) {{in the absence of any}} detectable memory B cells. This study documents the existence of long-lived <b>plasma</b> <b>cells</b> and demonstrates a new mechanism by which humoral immunity is maintained...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT <b>Plasma</b> <b>cell</b> {{granuloma}} {{is a rare}} reactive tumor- like lesion {{composed of}} polyclonal <b>plasma</b> <b>cells.</b> It primarily affects the lungs but occurs in other anatomic locations such as orbit, paranasal sinuses, larynx, tonsils, ears, tongue, lip, oral cavity and gingiva. A 65 - year old female presented with the chief complaint of swelling over the right upper gingiva and mobility of right upper 2 nd and 3 rd molar teeth since 3 - 4 months At histopathology due to presence of uniform population of <b>plasma</b> <b>cells</b> a histopathological diagnosis of <b>plasma</b> <b>cell</b> rich lesion was made with a differential diagnosis of extramedullary plasmacytoma and <b>plasma</b> <b>cell</b> granuloma. However, immunohistochemical staining for kappa and lambda chains showed a polyclonal process and antibodies to CD 138 were strongly positive, confirming the diagnosis of <b>plasma</b> <b>cell</b> granuloma. The case describes a rare condition of <b>plasma</b> <b>cell</b> granuloma occurring at an unusual site. Authors also {{emphasize the importance of}} immunohistochemistry in differential diagnosis of <b>plasma</b> <b>cell</b> rich lesions...|$|R
5000|$|The clonal <b>plasma</b> <b>cells</b> {{involved}} in <b>plasma</b> <b>cell</b> dyscrasias exhibit {{a high degree}} of genetic instability. For example, the clonal <b>plasma</b> <b>cell</b> population formed by initial genetic alterations that lead to multiple myeloma contains cells that develop further genetic changes that enhance their survival, proliferation, tissue-injuring, and metastatic capacities. This allows the new cell clones to crowd out older cell clones and thereby establish a more malignant disease. Repetition of such genetic changes underlie the evolution of a clinically silent <b>plasma</b> <b>cell</b> dyscrasia to an overt malignancy. The progressive genetic changes in clonal <b>plasma</b> <b>cells</b> include accumulating numerous single nucleotide polymorphisms, increases and decreases in gene and chromosome copy numbers, and chromosomal translocations. Genes affecting include those regulating genome stability itself (e.g. KIF2B) as well as cellular activation, proliferation, and apoptosis (e.g. CIDEC, TP52, ATM, KRAS, NRAS, Wnt, and NF-κB). In the most malignant form of <b>plasma</b> <b>cell</b> dyscrasias, primary <b>plasma</b> <b>cell</b> leukemia, the <b>plasma</b> <b>cell</b> population contains >1900 distinct DNA alterations in >600 genes.|$|R
40|$|Autoantibodies are {{believed}} to be maintained by either the continuous generation of short-lived <b>plasma</b> <b>cells</b> in secondary lymphoid tissues or by long-lived <b>plasma</b> <b>cells</b> localized in bone marrow and spleen. Here, we show in a mouse model for the autoimmune blistering skin disease epidermolysis bullosa acquisita (EBA) that chronic autoantibody production can also be maintained in inflamed lymph nodes, by <b>plasma</b> <b>cells</b> exhibiting intermediate lifetimes. After EBA induction by immunization with a mCOL 7 c-GST-fusion protein, antigen-specific <b>plasma</b> <b>cells</b> and CD 4 T <b>cells</b> were analyzed. <b>Plasma</b> <b>cells</b> were maintained for months in stable numbers in the draining lymph nodes, but not in spleen and bone marrow. In contrast, localization of mCOL 7 c-GST -specific CD 4 T cells was not restricted to lymph nodes, indicating that availability of T cell help does not limit <b>plasma</b> <b>cell</b> localization to this site. BrdU-incorporation studies indicated that pathogenic mCOL 7 c- and non-pathogenic GST-specific <b>plasma</b> <b>cells</b> resemble intermediates between short-and long-lived <b>plasma</b> <b>cells</b> with half-lives of about 7 weeks. Immunization with mCOL 7 c-GST also yielded considerable numbers of <b>plasma</b> <b>cells</b> neither specific for mCOL 7 c- nor GST. These bystander-activated <b>plasma</b> <b>cells</b> exhibited much shorter half-lives and higher population turnover, suggesting that <b>plasma</b> <b>cell</b> lifetimes were only partly determined by the lymph node environment but also by the mode of activation. These results indicate that inflamed lymph nodes can harbor pathogenic <b>plasma</b> <b>cells</b> exhibiting distinct properties and hence may resemble a so far neglected site for chronic autoantibody production...|$|R
