50|$|Since the 1960s {{there has}} {{developed}} an overlap of usage between the terms milling machine and machining center. NC/CNC machining centers evolved from milling machines, {{which is why the}} terminology evolved gradually with considerable overlap that still persists. The distinction, when one is made, is that a machining center is a mill with features that pre-CNC mills never had, especially an automatic tool changer (ATC) that includes a tool magazine (carousel), and sometimes an automatic <b>pallet</b> <b>changer</b> (APC). In typical usage, all machining centers are mills, but not all mills are machining centers; only mills with ATCs are machining centers.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. One of {{the main}} {{objectives}} in obtaining high productivity on machining centers is the reduction of auxiliary times consumed with the tool and workpiece change. In the case of workpiece change the auxiliary time is reduced by adopting {{the use of an}} automatic <b>pallet</b> <b>changer</b> system and implicitly of pallets, while in the case of tool change this time is reduced using an automatic tool changer system. The optimization of the constructive and functional parameters of palletizing systems, in the purpose of decreasing auxiliary times, implies increased speed and accelerations, inertia reduction, an optimum transmission ratio, component mechanisms coupled movements, increasing the positioning accuracy of the pallet on the machine table. This paper presents the methodology of transmission ratio optimization of an electric driven <b>pallet</b> <b>changer</b> mechanism; the main purpose is to obtain the maximum acceleration. In order to find the maximum acceleration of the electric driven pallet changing mechanism considered, and thus minimizing the total changing time, we use the equilibrium equation of the moments reduced to the motor shaft. Following the proposed methodology we obtain the maximum acceleration of the considered <b>pallet</b> <b>changer</b> mechanism. Also we issue some constructive indications for future designing of electric driven <b>pallet</b> <b>changer</b> mechanisms...|$|E

Modern Machining Centres {{have been developed to}} perform several operations on several faces of a workpiece in a single setup. On the other hand industry requires high value added components, which have many quality critical features to be manufactured in an outsourcing environment as opposed to the traditional in-house manufacture. The success of this manufacture critically depends on matching the advanced features of the machine tools to the complexity of the component. This project has developed a methodology to represent the features of a machine tool {{in the form of an}} alphanumeric string and the features of the component in another string. The strings are then matched to choose the most suitable and economical Machine Tool for the component’s manufacture. Literature identified that block structure is the way to answer the question ‘how to systematically describe the layout of such a machining centre’. Incomplete attempts to describe a block structure as alphanumeric strings were also presented in the literature. Survey on sales literature from several machine tool suppliers was investigated to systematically identify the features need by the user for the choice of a machine tool. Combining these, a new alphanumeric string was developed to represent machine tools. Using these strings as one of the ‘key’s for sorting a database of machine tools was developed. A supporting database of machine tools was also developed. Survey on machining on the other hand identified, that machining features can be used as a basis for planning the machining of a component. It analysed various features and feature sets proposed and provided and their recognition in CAD models. Though a vast number of features were described only two sets were complete sets. The project was started with one of them, (the other was carrying too many unwanted details for the task of this project) machining features supported by ‘Expert Machinist’ software. But when it became unavailable a ‘Feature set’ along those lines were defined and used in the generation of an alphanumeric string to represent the work. Comparing the two strings led the choice of suitable machines from the database. The methodology is implemented as a bolt on software incorporated within Pro/Engineer software where one can model any given component using cut features (mimicking machining operation) and produce a list of machine tools having features for the machining of that component. This will enable outsourcing companies to identify those Precision Engineers who have the machine tools with the matching apabilities. Supporting software and databases were developed using Access Database, Visual Basic and C with Pro/TOOLKIT functions. The resulting software suite was tested on several case studies and found to be effective. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R

40|$|In {{order to}} shorten the {{auxiliary}} times regarding tool and workpiece changing, conventional machine tools are equipped with automatic tool changers and automatic pallet changers, thus becoming machining centers. Reducing the time consumed with the change of the workpiece to follow in machining implies the existence of another table-i. e. the pallet-on which the workpiece is positioned and clamped, while on the working area of the machine another part is manufactured. This paper is presenting a new automatic <b>pallet</b> <b>changer</b> mechanism which is hydraulically driven, along with its guiding and transmission systems...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. In {{small and}} medium batch series {{manufacturing}} the small tool and workpiece changing time {{is one of}} the main objectives to follow in obtaining high productivity. These auxiliary times are defined as the times consumed with preparing and changing the next tool or workpiece to follow the machining process, times that usually overlap the machining process. For this purpose machining centres are equipped with an automatic tool changer system and an automatic <b>pallet</b> <b>changer</b> system. The palletizing systems imply eliminating the times consumed with the alignment, fixing and clamping of the workpieces, these systems consisting of several mechanisms: the pallet, the automatic pallet changing mechanism, the positioning mechanism and the pallet clamp/unclamp mechanism. In this paper we present an general overview of the automatic pallet changing mechanisms used both in flexible manufacturing systems and machining centres...|$|E
40|$|As {{everyone}} knows, assembly quality plays a {{very important}} role in final product quality. Since computer numerical control machine tool is a large system with complicated structure and function, and there are complex association relationships among quality characteristics in assembly process, then it is difficult and inaccurate to analyze the whole computer numerical control machine tool quality characteristic association at one time. In this article, meta-action assembly unit is proposed as the basic analysis unit, of which quality characteristic association is studied to guarantee the whole computer numerical control machine tool assembly quality. First, based on “Function-Motion-Action” decomposition structure, the definitions of meta-action and meta-action assembly unit are introduced. Second, manufacturing process association and meta-action assembly unit quality characteristic association are discussed. Third, after understanding the definitions of information entropy and relative entropy, the concrete meta-action assembly unit quality characteristic association analysis steps based on relative entropy are described in detail. And finally, the lifting piston translation assembly unit of automatic <b>pallet</b> <b>changer</b> is taken as an example, the association degree between internal leakage and the influence factors of part quality characteristics and mate-relationships among them are calculated to figure out the most influential factors, showing the correctness and feasibility of this method...|$|E
