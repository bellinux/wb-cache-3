This paper can also be found at: [URL] advances in automated production processes have resulted in the need for detecting, reading and decoding 2 D datamatrix barcodes at very high speeds. This requires the correct combination of high speed optical devices that are capable of capturing high quality images and computer vision algorithms that can read and decode the barcodes accurately. Such barcode readers should also be capable of resolving fundamental imaging challenges arising from blurred barcode edges, reflections from possible <b>polyethylene</b> <b>wrapping,</b> poor and/or non-uniform illumination, fluctuations of focus, rotation and scale changes. Addressing the above challenges in this paper we propose the design and implementation of a high speed multi-barcode reader and provide test results from an industrial trial. To authors knowledge such a comprehensive system has not been proposed and fully investigated in existing literature. To reduce the reflections on the images caused due to <b>polyethylene</b> <b>wrapping</b> used in typical packaging, polarising filters have been used. The images captured using the optical system above will still include imperfections and variations due to scale, rotation, illumination etc. We use a number of novel image enhancement algorithms optimised for use with 2 D datamatrix barcodes for image de-blurring, contrast point and self-shadow removal using an affine transform based approach and non-uniform illumination correction. The enhanced images are subsequently used for barcode detection and recognition. We provide experimental results from a factory trial of using the multi-barcode reader and evaluate the performance of each optical unit and computer vision algorithm used. The results indicate an overall accuracy of 99. 6...|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{evaluate}} the fibrovascular ingrowth progression within the porous polyethylene orbital implant (Medpor) with serial {{magnetic resonance imaging}} (MRI). DESIGN: Prospective, nonrandomized, comparative (self-controlled) trial. PARTICIPANTS: Ten patients who underwent enucleation and implantation of a 20 -mm porous <b>polyethylene</b> implant <b>wrapped</b> with heterologous sclera. METHODS: Serial precontrast and postcontrast T 1 -weighted MRI were obtained at 1. 5, 3, 6, and 12 months after implantation. The percentage area of enhancement was calculated by use of manual planimetric contouring unenhanced areas at the equator of each sphere on axial and coronal planes. RESULTS: All the implants showed enhancing areas as early as 1. 5 months after enucleation. In 8 of the 10 patients, the areas of enhancement at the equator of the implant consistently showed similar centripetal progression primarily during the first 6 months after enucleation. The presence of fibrovascular tissue at the equator was associated in all cases with enhancing zones at the anterior portion of the implant. None of the implants showed diffuse complete enhancement after 12 months. Two patients failed to demonstrate further enhancement progression 1. 5 months after implantation. No histopathologic study to equate with the MRI findings was performed in this series. CONCLUSIONS: Postcontrast magnetic resonance studies {{seem to be the}} best-suited imaging modality for assessing the fibrovascular tissue progression into porous polyethylene spheres after enucleation and for identifying patients in whom failure of vascularization occurs. Incomplete vascularization at the equator of the porous polyethylene sphere does not prove an absence of fibrovascular ingrowth in the anterior region.

50|$|LPS {{comprises}} a loose {{sleeve of}} <b>polyethylene</b> that completely <b>wraps</b> the pipe, including the bells of any joints. The sleeving inhibits corrosion {{by a number}} of mechanisms. It physically separates the pipe from soil particles, preventing direct galvanic corrosion. By providing an impermeable barrier to ground water, the sleeve also inhibits the diffusion of oxygen to the ductile iron surface and limits the availability of electrolytes that would accelerate corrosion. It provides a homogeneous environment along the pipe surface so that corrosion occurs evenly over the pipe. The sleeve also restricts the availability of nutrients which could support sulfate-reducing bacteria, inhibiting microbially induced corrosion. LPS is not designed to be completely water-tight but rather to greatly restrict the movement of water to and from the pipe surface. Water present beneath the sleeve and in contact with the pipe surface is rapidly deoxygenated and depleted of nutrients and forms a stable environment in which limited further corrosion occurs. An improperly installed sleeve that continues to allow the free flow of ground water is not effective in inhibiting corrosion.|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe pumping {{and left}} {{ventricular}} unloading {{capabilities of the}} left ventricular, ventricular synchronous skeletal-muscle ventricle were determined in nine anesthetized dogs ranging in weight from 20. 7 to 31. 8 kg. The ventricular synchronous skeletal-muscle ventricle consists of the left rectus abdominis muscle wrapped around a 4 -mil-thick <b>polyethylene</b> pouch (<b>wrapped</b> volume 80 to 100 ml) connected to the left ventricular apex with no valve and to the aorta via a prosthetic heart valve. The rectus muscle is timed to contract tetanically and relax during left ventricular ejection. This arrangement provides a high precontraction pressure for the rectus muscle and a high muscle capillary blood flow during skeletal muscle relaxation. The timing signal for initiation of the train of stimulating pulses (40 /sec) {{was derived from the}} ventricular electrogram. The delay for the stimulus train determines the preload for the rectus muscle and along with the stimulus train duration determines ventricular synchronous skeletal-muscle ventricle stroke volume, which was measured by electric impedance. With unconditioned rectus muscles (70 to 120 gm) and with a pumping ratio of 1 : 3, ventricular synchronous skeletal-muscle ventricle stroke volume averaged 26. 1 ml, which provided an average output of 876 ml/min. The normalized ventricular synchronous skeletal-muscle ventricle output was 35. 6 ml/min per kilogram of body weight. In a typical resting dog (and man), the normalized cardiac output is 70 ml/min per kilogram. Therefore the ventricular synchronous skeletal-muscle ventricle is capable of pumping 52 % of the cardiac output (with a pumping ratio of 1 : 3). The optimum train delay from the apex of the ventricular electrogram ranged from 10 to 100 msec. The left ventricular ejection period averaged 309 msec, and this determines the time available for the rectus muscle to contract and relax. Evidence for unloading the left ventricle is shown by the reduced left ventricular diastolic pressure and stroke volume for the postassisted beats.

40|$|Diffuse {{reflectance}} spectra measured during shipboard core description with {{a hand-held}} Minolta spectrophotometer are reliable data for interpreting sediment composition. Factor {{analysis of these}} spectra indicates that only Glad Cling WrapTM, a <b>polyethylene</b> food <b>wrap,</b> {{should be used to}} cover wet cores during measurement because it introduces substantially less noise into the spectra than other brands of plastic food wrap. This validates our previous recommendation that only Glad Cling WrapTM should be used to cover wet core surfaces before spectral analysis on board ship. Factor analysis also indicates that the red end of the spectrum was a little noisy; however, it is unclear if this noise was produced by the Glad Cling WrapTM, by the Minolta instrument, or by the sediment being analyzed when wet (water tends to affect the red end of the spectrum more than the violet). Comparison of spectra taken directly from wet cores on board ship with the Minolta CM- 2002 to those taken from dried, prepared samples with our shore-based Perkin-Elmer Lambda 6 spectrophotometer indicates that water mutes the spectral signal. Although factor analysis of the Perkin-Elmer data produced five factors, four of those factors are the same as the factors extracted from the wet core data with the Minolta. This suggests that the water content in the wet cores was not high enough to seriously hinder interpretation of sediment composition. These four common factors are interpreted as carbonate, chlorite or glauconite, organic matter, and iron oxides (probably a mixture of hematite and goethite). The presence of hematite can be attributed to hematite-rich sediment derived from the Canadian Maritime provinces, which has been transported southward by the Western Boundary Undercurrent (WBUC) along North American continental margin. Based on the distribution of hematite down the Leg 164 holes, the WBUC apparently has washed over the Leg 164 sites on the crest of the Blake Ridge only during the Holocene and very latest Pleistocene...|$|R

The acerola {{tropical fruit}} and papaya are of great industrial interest for its nutritional and sensory characteristics. Due to the perishable {{nature of these}} fruits to adopt conservation methods is necessary. The present study aimed at obtaining "blends" powder from freeze-drying the pulp of acerola and papaya. First were performed compounds central rotational schedules, which evaluated the influence of lyophilization time and maltodextrin concentration and humidity on the hygroscopicity of the powders. From {{the results of the}} design were produced powders from acerola and papaya in optimal process conditions based on lower hygroscopicity, moisture was not considered by the planning because the powders obtained were within the standards established by Brazilian legislation. From the physico-chemical characterizations of the pulps and the pulps fresh powder was noticed good nutritional quality for both pulps primarily by ascorbic acid, in addition to considerable amounts of anthocyanins and carotenoids in relation to adsorption isotherms both the powders exhibited type III curves concave-shaped "J" typically associated with the food powders from fruit, yet papaya pulp powder showed reversal of the effect of temperature on adsorption capacity for water a range of water activity of 0, 8. The Oswin model was the best fit curves for the prediction of the pulp powder at all temperatures analyzed for papaya pulp, the model proposed by BET was the best fit the data. Then experiment was conducted mixtures simplex centroid increased to three components (acerola pulp, papaya pulp and maltodextrin) to obtain the "blend" lyophilized powder, by determining the effect of the proportions of the mixture on the hygroscopicity, solubility, time and degree of rehydration Caking. The time lyophilization of "blends" was the simple arithmetic average between the times of lyophilization obtained by central composite design for the pulp powder acerola and papaya. The results of qualitative analysis of the mixture enabled the choice of test 6 with the proportions 25 % acerola pulp, 50 % papaya pulp and 25 % maltodextrin as best assay for production of "blend" powder.

Supplementary cementing materials such as silica fume has predominantly used for HPC due to it improves the packing of the concrete mix and activates the pozzolanic reaction. But agglomerates can be formed in this fine aggregate mix and therefore the packing of the mix is not improved, chemical reaction is hindered {{and the use of}} this aggregate may worsen the concrete properties instead of improving them. The effect of cavitation treatment on silica fume and cement is investigated in this work. Due to cavitation treatment, the agglomerate of silica fume and cement collapses into nano- and micro-particles and uniforms dispersion of small dispersed particles in liquid medium. Granulometric composition of silica fume slurry before and after cavitation treatment was determined. High performance concrete mixes with designed packing including micro- and nano-size fillers were elaborated. Fresh and hardened concrete were tested and such properties as cone flow, watertightness, water absorption and compressive strength were defined for control and experimental mixes. The influence of cavitation treatment of small dispersed raw materials on the compressive strength properties of produced concrete has been evaluated.

At the same time, cavitation features can be directed towards solving problems of engineering and manufacturing industry, such as using the cavitation process to stabilize the particles in liquids and to create various liquid emulsions Fig. 2 [15], [16], [17]. p. 599 Materials used in this study were the following: Portland cement CEM I 42. 5 N, which conforms to the standard LVS EN 197 - 1 : 2012 [18]; quartz sand 0. 3 / 4 mm, which conforms to the standard LVS EN 12620 +A 1 : 2009 L [19];p. 599 Specially designed and patented apparatus was applied to create turbulent flow and employ hydrodynamic cavitation process as a tool for silica fume and cement particle agglomerate disaggregation and surface activation [20]. p. 600 Specimens with dimensions 100 × 100 × 100 mm were cast (3 samples were made for each testing point); vibrated during 20 sec and cured 2 days covered in <b>polyethylene</b> <b>wrap,</b> 5 days in water, 21 days in climatic chamber (t= 20 °C, RH> 90 %) (LVS EN 12390 - 2 : 2009 [21]). p. 600 The segregation of particles was reached 50 % by height in the untreated suspension after 2 hours, and 10 % in suspension treated by cavitation. p. 601 The effective radius for the specimens with silica fume and water are very similar irrespective of treatment time; nevertheless, a significant difference is observed in agglomerate diameters in the liquid with plasticizers. This phenomenon could be {{explained by the fact that}} in the suspension, which contains plasticizers, more energy is needed for the dispersion of the silica fume particle agglomerates. p. 601 Compressive strength of the mixes was tested at the age of 7 days (water curing) and 28 days (normal curing) (LVS EN 12390 - 3 : 2009 [22], 2008) p. 597 - 604 mix, mixesp. 603 Effect of cavitation treatment water with silica fume on properties of concrete fresh mix has been evaluated by slump test. Application of slurry made from water with silica fume after cavitation treatment in concrete causes increasing slump value of concrete mix. It could be explained by the better particle packing and as result since rising flowability of mix. The authors would like to apologise for any inconvenience caused...|$|R

This can occur during bunch development in the field or postharvest handling and storage. Mild symptoms of chilling injury are localised to peel tissue and reduce visual quality of fruit. Light microscopy {{was used in the}} present study to analyse symptoms of mild chilling injury in Cavendish cv. Williams banana. Following storage at 5 °C for 24 hours, symptoms of chilling injury in the form of brown discolouration was observed within laticifers in sub-epidermal peel tissue. Browning was not observed in other vascular tissues as previous research has suggested. Causal mechanisms associated with browning of latex within laticifers were investigated. Polyphenol oxidase (PPO) activity in fractions of banana peel latex was measured and found to be highest in the lutoid fraction. PPO activity also provided indirect evidence that phenolics were present in peel latex. Literature suggests possible compartmentalisation of PPO and phenolics in banana lutoids. In this study it is suggested that PPO and phenolics associated with lutoids in banana peel latex may be involved in browning due to chilling stress. The lipid content of lutoids from banana latex was also investigated using FTIR spectroscopy, but showed no further involvement of lutoids in the browning reaction caused by chilling. Control of field chilling using modified bunch covers was investigated. Bunch covers used in modern banana production are usually polyethylene bags, placed over bunches during development in the field. Experiments in a northern Queensland plantation investigated effects of modified bunch covers on fruit yield and quality characteristics of Cavendish cv. Williams bananas, including the development of mild chilling injury symptoms. A further field trial was conducted using different coloured bunch covers with varied interception of photosynthetically-active radiation (PAR), to determine any negative effects of bunch cover shading on fruit yield and quality. Different coloured and layered polyethylene films (blue, double green, silver yellow and silver black) modified PAR transmission of bunch covers (PAR transmission [%] = 56, 38, 7, 0). During summer 2003, varying PAR transmission of bunch covers significantly affected fruit size. Fruit from blue polyethylene covers, which transmitted most light, were larger than fruit from covers with less light transmission. Between cover treatments of lower light transmission, fruit size remained similar. It is suggested, during summer when cloud cover in northern Queensland limits solar radiation, bunch covers with high PAR transmission facilitate greater bunch photosynthesis, which improves fruit size. Fruit quality was generally unaffected by varying PAR transmission of bunch covers, but cover treatments were found to influence peel colour. Peel colour of fruit from 'silver black' covers was significantly paler. This may have impacted upon green life due to increased de-greening. Results from this experiment suggest that bunch photosynthesis significantly influences fruit size and peel colour during summer growing periods. Modified bunch covers constructed from existing bunch cover films and <b>polyethylene</b> bubble <b>wrap</b> ('blue + silver bubble' and sealed and non-sealed 'silver blue + silver bubble') were used to test control of field chilling during winter 2003 and 2004. Compared to standard blue polyethylene bunch covers, modified covers significantly reduced exposure of bunches to chilling conditions in the field and the development of visible chilling injury symptoms on the peel surface and in underpeel tissue. Greatest control of field chilling was shown using the non-sealed 'silver blue + silver bubble' cover design. Relative to the standard blue cover, in winter 2003 the non-sealed 'silver blue + silver bubble' cover design reduced chilling exposure by 95 % at the top and 45 % at the bottom of bunches. This totally controlled chilling injury symptoms in the top and middle bunch regions. In winter 2004 chilling conditions were more severe and chilling exposure was reduced by 85 % using the non-sealed 'silver blue + silver bubble' cover. This reduced the severity of peel surface chilling symptoms by 67 % in the top bunch region relative to fruit from blue covers. Yield characteristics were positively influenced by 'blue + silver bubble' and sealed and non-sealed 'silver blue + silver bubble' covers. Improved fruit size and weight was probably due to enhanced temperature conditions inside the bunch environment, relative to 'control' covers. Fruit quality was generally unaffected by 'blue + silver bubble' and sealed and non-sealed 'silver blue + silver bubble' covers. However peel colour was significantly influenced by these cover treatments, compared to the 'control' covers. Reduced light transmission of covers produced paler fruit. This may have influenced other quality characteristics, such as green life and SSC levels, as it confounded assessment of ripening stage. Thesis (Ph. D.)
