5|$|The Mk 8 Rangekeeper was an {{electromechanical}} {{analog computer}} whose function was to continuously calculate the gun's bearing and elevation, Line-Of-Fire (LOF), {{to hit a}} future position of the target. It did this by automatically receiving information from the director (LOS), the FC Radar (range), the ship's gyrocompass (true ship's course), the ship's <b>Pitometer</b> log (ship's speed), the Stable Vertical (ship's roll and pitch), and the ship's anemometer (relative wind speed and direction). Also, before the surface action started, the FTs made manual inputs for the average initial velocity of the projectiles fired out of the battery's gun barrels, and air density. With all this information, the Rangekeeper calculated the relative motion between the ship and the target. It then could calculate an offset angle and change of range between the target's present position (LOS) and future position {{at the end of}} the projectile's time of flight. To this bearing and range offset, it added corrections for gravity, wind, Magnus effect of the spinning projectile, earth's curvature, and coriolis effect. The result was the turret's bearing and elevation orders (LOF). During the surface action, range and deflection Spots and target altitude (not zero during Gun Fire Support) were manually entered.|$|E

50|$|The basic {{technology}} of the <b>pitometer</b> log {{is similar to that}} of the pitot tube on an aircraft. Typically, the <b>pitometer</b> has a long tube that penetrates the ship's hull near the keel. The part of the <b>pitometer</b> protruding from the ship is sometimes called a pit sword or rodmeter. This tube usually has two openings: one facing the direction of seawater motion that is used to measure the dynamic pressure of the seawater and one at 90Â° to the direction of seawater motion that is used to measure the static seawater pressure. The dynamic pressure of the seawater is a function of the depth of the water and the speed of the vessel.|$|E

These very expensive devices measure the ship's ground speed by performing correlation processing between the signals received by the different receivers at different times.

5000|$|The Mk. 1/1A's {{mechanism}} support plates, some an inch (25 mm) thick, {{were made}} of aluminum alloy, but nevertheless, the computer is very heavy. On at least one refloated museum ship, the destroyer [...] (now in Boston), the computer and Stable Element more than likely still are below decks, {{because they are so}} difficult to remove. The rangekeepers required a large number of electrical signal cables for synchro data transmission links over which they received information from the various sensors (e.g. gun director, <b>pitometer,</b> rangefinder, gyrocompass) and sent commands to the guns.|$|E
50|$|Essentially an {{electromechanical}} analog computer, the Mark 1 was electrically {{linked to}} the gun mounts and the Mark 37 gun director, the latter mounted as high on the superstructure as possible to afford maximum visual and radar range. The gun director was equipped with both optical and radar range finding, {{and was able to}} rotate on a small barbette-like structure. Using the range finders, the director was able to produce a continuously varying set of outputs, referred to as line-of-sight (LOS) data, that were electrically relayed to the Mark 1 via synchro motors. The LOS data provided the target's present range, bearing, {{and in the case of}} aerial targets, altitude. Additional inputs to the Mark 1 were continuously generated from the stable element, a gyroscopic device that reacted to the roll and pitch of the ship, the <b>pitometer</b> log, which measured the ship's speed through the water, and an anemometer, which provided wind speed and direction.|$|E

40|$|Hydrocyclones {{can be used}} to {{fractionate}} fibres {{according to}} their papermaking potential. The obtained fractions typically differ in fibre wall thickness and/or degree of fibre treatment. Despite a multitude of potential application scenarios, the process has so far had little commercial success. This is largely explained by the low fractionation efficiency and unfavourable operating characteristics of the process. The fractionation efficiency of a hydrocyclone is closely related to its flow field. The influence of pulp concentration on the tangential velocity field was therefore studied, by using a self-cleaning <b>pitometer.</b> It was found that the pulp concentration had a strong influence on the tangential velocity. At a feed pulp concentration above 7. 5 g/l, the suspension rotated almost as a solid body. As a consequence, the magnitude of radial acceleration and shear stresses decreased dramatically. It is suggested that this is detrimental to the fractionation efficiency. The radial velocity field was measured using an Ultrasonic Velocity Profiler. The measurements showed that the rotational centre of the flow field did not correspond with the geometrical centre of the hydrocyclone. This displacement caused the tangential velocity component of the vortex to contribute substantially to the measurement result of the radial velocity component. Based on the findings in respect to the flow field studies, a novel design for a fibre fractionation hydrocyclone was proposed. The flow field inside this hydrocyclone was compared to that in a conventional hydrocyclone. It was found, that high radial acceleration and shear stresses could be maintained in the novel design even at high fibre concentration. The fractionation efficiency of the novel hydrocyclone was characterised in terms of surface roughness difference between fine and coarse fraction. When operated with refined bleached softwood kraft pulp, the novel hydrocyclone could produce fractions with a substantial surface roughness difference without deteriorating the dewatering characteristics of the fine fraction. A low thickening of the reject is proposed to be the explanation for that. When fractionating TMP, the best efficiency occurred at a concentration of 10 g/l. QC 2010080...|$|E
40|$|Three-dimensional {{turbulent}} flow in a cylindrical hydrocyclone is considered and studied {{by means of}} computational fluid dynamics using software packages CFX and Fluent. The aim has been to identify the methods {{that can be used}} for accurate simulation of the flow in three-dimensional configurations in hydrocyclones at high swirl numbers. As a starting point, swirling pipe flows created by tangential inlets, where detailed experimental data were available in literature, were considered. It was found that the velocity profiles for the flow with a swirl number of 2. 67 could be predicted accurately using a Reynolds stress model and an accurate numerical discretization on a fine-enough mesh. At a higher swirl number, 7. 84, under-prediction in the tangential velocity profiles was observed; however the prediction of the axial velocity profiles was satisfactory. The validated methods were then used to simulate the flow in a cylindrical hydrocyclone at a swirl number as large as 21. The calculated tangential velocity profiles were compared against experimental data measured with a <b>pitometer.</b> Acceptable agreements were recorded except near the geometric axis of the cyclone. Due to the lack of the aircore in the numerical model, disagreements near the axis of the cyclone could be expected to some extent. Numerical experiments performed in the present work indicated that the RNG k-Îµ model is not likely to be capable to predict highly swirling flows accurately and a Reynolds stress model is required. For three-dimensional models, where the computing capacity and the available memory set strong restrictions on the computational mesh, optimizing the maximum mesh resolution available play an important role on the accuracy and stability of the solution procedure. The most stable results in the present study were found using the Reynolds stress model proposed by Launder et al. on an as regular and structured mesh as possible using a higher order discretization scheme in Fluent. Therefore, the meshing capabilities of the pre-processor, the available turbulence models and the accuracy of the numerical methods must be considered in parallel. Acceptable results were also generated using the Baseline Reynolds stress model implemented in CFX, however, only with a transient procedure which was likely to be more time-consuming. Present simulations present a complex flow structure in the cylindrical cyclone with a double axial flow reversal. The effect of such a flow pattern on the fractionation of the fibres with small differences in density needs to be investigated in future studies. QC 2010120...|$|E
