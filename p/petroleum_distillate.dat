5000|$|Petroleum benzine is a {{hydrocarbon}} based solvent mixture that {{is classified}} by its physical properties (e.g. boiling point, vapor pressure) {{rather than a}} specific chemical composition, often obfuscating distinction within {{the long list of}} <b>petroleum</b> <b>distillate</b> solvent mixtures: mineral spirits, naphtha, white spirits, petroleum spirits, turps substitute, mineral turpentine, petroleum benzine, petroleum ether, ligroin, and Stoddard Solvent. The chemical composition of a <b>petroleum</b> <b>distillate</b> can also be modified to afford a solvent with reduced concentration of unsaturated hydrocarbons, i.e. alkenes, by hydrotreating and/or reduced aromatics, e.g. benzene, toluene xylene, by several dearomatization methods. In a document that attempts to draw more concise distinctions between hydrocarbon solvents, conservator Alan Phenix explains that the most important distinction amongst the various hydrocarbon solvents are their boiling/distillation ranges (and, by association, volatility, flash point etc.) and aromatic content. Given the toxicity/carcinogenicity of some aromatic hydrocarbons, most notably benzene, the aromatic content of <b>petroleum</b> <b>distillate</b> solvents, which would normally be in the 10-25% (w/w) range for most petroleum fractions, can be advantageously reduced when their special solvation properties are not required and a less odorous, lower toxicity solvent is desired, especially when present in consumer products. Phenix further points out that [...] "To all intents and purposes petroleum benzine appears synonymous with petroleum spirit." [...] Petroleum spirit is generally considered to be the fractions between the very lightest hydrocarbons, petroleum ether, and the heavier distillates, mineral spirits. For example, petroleum benzine with a boiling range of 36 - 83 °C sold by EMD Millipore under CAS-No. 64742-49-0 is identified in the product MSDS as hydrotreated light petroleum distillates comprising ≥ 90% C5-C7 hydrocarbons, n-alkanes, isoalkanes, and < 5% n-hexane, while Santa Cruz Biotechnology sells a petroleum ether product under the same CAS-No. Fisher Scientific offers a product ‘Benzine (Petroleum Naphtha)' that retails for a high price that would suggest it is a speciality product but in fact conforms to Marathon Petroleum's 'VM&P Naphtha' (Varnish Makers & Painters’ Naphtha) found widely distributed in many hardware stores in North America.|$|E

40|$|Experimental and {{analytical}} {{studies have been}} carried out to better understand the effects of additives on viscosity, density and surface tension of intermediate and heavy crude oils. The studies have been conducted for the following oil samples: San Francisco oil from Columbia with specific gravity of 28 o- 29 o API, Duri oil with gravity of 19 o- 21 o API, Jobo oil with gravity of 8 o- 9 o API and San Ardo oil gravity of 11 o- 13 o API. The additive used in all of the experiments is <b>petroleum</b> <b>distillate.</b> The experiments consist of using <b>petroleum</b> <b>distillate</b> as an additive for different samples of heavy crude oils. The experiments include making a mixture by adding <b>petroleum</b> <b>distillate</b> to oil samples and measuring surface tension, viscosity and density of pure oil samples and mixtures at different temperatures. The petroleum distillate/oil ratios are the following ratios: 1 : 100, 2 : 100, 3 : 100, 4 : 100 and 5 : 100. Experimental results showed that use of <b>petroleum</b> <b>distillate</b> as an additive increases API gravity and leads to reduction in viscosity and surface tension for all the samples. Results showed for all petroleum distillate/oil ratios viscosity and interfacial tension decreases with temperature. As petroleum distillate/oil ratio increases, oil viscosity and surface tension decrease more significantly at lower temperatures than at higher temperatures. After all experiments were completed an analytical correlation was done based on the experiment results to develop ?mixing rules?. Using this correlation viscosity, density and surface tension of different petroleum distillate/oil mixtures were obtained (output). These had properties of pure oil and <b>petroleum</b> <b>distillate,</b> mixture ratios and temperatures at which measurement is supposed to be done (output). Using this correlation a good match was achieved. For all of the cases (viscosity, density and surface tension), correlation coefficient (R?) was more than 0. 9 which proved to be optimum for a really good match...|$|E
