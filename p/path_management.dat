50|$|Each AMS2000 model {{comes with}} dual {{controllers}} that automate many storage management tasks. The symmetric active/active architecture with dynamic load balancing provides integrated, automated, front-to-back-end I/O load balancing. In this design both controllers are active {{and able to}} dynamically access any volume from a host port on either controller with no penalty on performance. By {{eliminating the need for}} each volume to be assigned to an owning controller, servers can be connected to either controller on an AMS2000 without establishing a primary and failover path to their volumes. With this design SAN <b>path</b> <b>management</b> software is not required.|$|E
50|$|With the {{introduction}} of Windows XP, GDI was complemented by the C++-based GDI+ subsystem. GDI+ adds anti-aliased 2D graphics, floating point coordinates, gradient shading, more complex <b>path</b> <b>management,</b> intrinsic support for modern graphics-file formats like JPEG and PNG, and support for composition of affine transformations in the 2D view pipeline.

50|$|With the {{introduction}} of Windows XP, the C++ based software-only GDI+ subsystem was introduced to replace certain GDI functions. GDI+ adds anti-aliased 2D graphics, textures, floating point coordinates, gradient shading, more complex <b>path</b> <b>management,</b> bicubic filtering, intrinsic support for modern graphics-file formats like JPEG and PNG, and support for composition of affine transformations in the 2D view pipeline. GDI+ uses ARGB values to represent color. Use of these features is apparent in Windows XP's user interface (transparent desktop icon labels, drop shadows for icon labels on the desktop, shadows under menus, translucent blue selection rectangle in Windows Explorer, sliding task panes and taskbar buttons), and several of its applications such as Microsoft Paint, Windows Picture and Fax Viewer, Photo Printing Wizard, My Pictures Slideshow screensaver, and {{their presence in the}} basic graphics layer greatly simplifies implementations of vector-graphics systems such as Flash or SVG. The GDI+ dynamic library can be shipped with an application and used under older versions of Windows. The total number of GDI handles per session is also raised in Windows XP from 16384 to 65536 (configurable through the registry).|$|E
30|$|Routing in {{wireless}} multihop relay networks is tree-based. In {{order to}} address path establishment, maintenance and release, the IEEE 802.16 j amendments propose to base routing decisions on metrics such as radio resource availability, radio link quality and traffic load at the RSs and propose to take these decisions at the MR-BS level based on {{information provided by the}} RSs, [1]. However, the amendments do not specify how the decisions should be made, [10]. Besides, the standard proposes two approaches to <b>path</b> <b>management</b> namely the embedded <b>path</b> <b>management</b> approach and the explicit <b>path</b> <b>management</b> approach.|$|E
30|$|The SCTP {{multihoming}} method supports multipath association, which enhances network transmission performance. SCTP supports multihoming {{and develops}} an original transmission performance.

A good <b>path</b> <b>management</b> approach effectively distinguishes path conditions (e.g., active or inactive) and efficiently switches among multiple destination addresses (e.g., active or passive path switching).|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to develop a better {{understanding}} of strategic <b>paths</b> to knowledge <b>management</b> in small and medium-sized hotels. This thesis has formulated a path knowledge concept and developed a PathFinder model. The formulation of the path knowledge concept and the development of the PathFinder model are based on an empirical investigation through the conduct of thirteen face-to-face in-depth interviews with owners/managers in small and medium-sized hotels. The interview data were analysed with the use of a purpose-built database and Structured Query Language for data manipulation. This study has identified four broad types of <b>paths</b> to knowledge <b>management</b> in small and medium-sized hotels. A hotel&# 039;s choice of a <b>path</b> to knowledge <b>management</b> is essentially dependent on two defining aspects, the sources of revenue generation and knowledge <b>management</b> activities. The <b>path</b> knowledge concept reflects the growth visions of small and medium-sized hotels, where knowledge management is practised unconscio usly as part of the integrated business operation. The PathFinder model represents the intentions of small and medium-sized hotels with regard to certain <b>paths</b> to knowledge <b>management</b> as influenced by various internal and external resources. The model provides strategic level decision making options for knowledge management and the basis for the development of future additions...|$|R

30|$|The {{embedded}} <b>path</b> <b>management</b> approach allocates {{the connection}} identifiers (CIDs) in a hierarchical manner. More precisely, the MR-BS allocates CIDs to its subordinate stations {{so that the}} CIDs allocated to all subordinate RSs of any station are {{a subset of the}} allocated CIDs for that station. Consequently, the <b>path</b> <b>management</b> is simplified because {{there is no need to}} store specific routing tables at the RS level and there is a reduced need for signaling to update the path information. On the other hand, the explicit <b>path</b> <b>management</b> approach uses an end-to-end signaling mechanism in order to distribute the routing table along the path. In more details, each path is identified by a path ID to which the CIDs are bound. The MR-BS needs to send the required information to the RSs belonging to the concerned path whenever it is created, updated or removed. Optionally, the MR-BS may specify the QoS requirements associated with each CID in order to enable the RSs to take the scheduling decision independently in case of distributed scheduling mode. The explicit <b>path</b> <b>management</b> approach needs small routing tables at the RSs and enables a reduction of the overhead required to update these tables, [10].|$|E
40|$|This work {{introduces}} {{the model of}} product flow paths as a formal framework for the correct execution of product flow operations in processing plants. A product flow path is a software object responsible for controlling, monitoring and documenting the movement of products along a determined route in the plant, and represents a temporarily and spatially isolated area for the safe and correct transport of products. A formal model provides a guide {{for the implementation of}} decentralised object-oriented product flow <b>path</b> <b>management</b> systems. A model-based synthesis technique replaces the engineering of a flow <b>path</b> <b>management</b> system for a plant with the simpler task of creating and verifying a model of the plant. A prototypical implementation of this technology has been developed as a proof of concept and tested with real-life plants, and {{can be seen as a}} reference implementation for industrial-strength flow <b>path</b> <b>management</b> systems...|$|E
30|$|<b>Path</b> <b>management</b> in SCTP applies {{multihoming}} {{to select}} the best path from all paths with the ICE mechanism (QA-SCTP). In the primary path, data packets are used to estimate the condition of path, while measuring packets are actively sent along the secondary path to measure the transmission conditions. The best path for transmitting data is determined from {{the conditions of the}} two paths. Experimental results show that the proposed QA-SCTP (quality-aware SCTP) <b>path</b> <b>management</b> mechanism assesses the path condition accurately and changes paths smoothly, thus providing high transmission efficiency.|$|E

40|$|Multi-Protocol Label Switching (MPLS) is {{suitable}} for implementing Traffic Engineering (TE) to achieve two goals: Quality of Service (QoS) provisioning and the efficient use of network resources. In fact, MPLS allows several detour paths to be (pre-) established for some source-destination pair {{as well as its}} primary path of minimum hops. Thus, we focus on a two-phase <b>path</b> <b>management</b> scheme using these two kinds of paths. In the first phase, each primary path is allocated to a flow on a specific source-destination pair if the path is not congested, i. e., if its utilization is less than some predetermined threshold; otherwise, as the second phase, one of the detour paths is allocated randomly if it is available. Therefore, in this paper, we analytically evaluate this <b>path</b> <b>management</b> scheme by extending the M/M/c/c queueing system and we investigate the impact of a threshold on the flow-blocking probability. Through some numerical results, we discuss the adequacy of the <b>path</b> <b>management</b> scheme for MPLS-TE...|$|E
