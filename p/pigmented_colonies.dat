Its long conidiophores are similar to the genus Cladosporium, which comes from the Latin word [...] "clado", meaning branched. The genus Cladophialophora is distinguished from Cladosporium because in addition to chains of conidia, members of the genus Cladophialophora also produce phialides. Cladophialophora carrionii is a dimorphic pathogen that changes states from a mycelial form to a muriform, yeast-like state once it invades its host.

Bacteriological isolation and identificationCapnocytophaga are fusiform Gram negative bacilli, and are part of the oral commensal flora.

This polymorphism is also reflected in the observation of colonies (orange <b>pigmented</b> <b>colonies,</b> spreading on agar ..[...] Capnocytophaga are capnophilic bacteria, they can live only in environments where the concentration of carbon dioxide is greater than that of the atmosphere (at least 5% CO2).

The isolation of strains of Capnocytophaga from polymicrobial samples is also possible on selective media containing antibiotics (Ehrmann et al. 2013). The identification is carried out through various biochemical tests, used for the identification of Gram negative bacterial species, and rapid determination of enzymatic reactions. The diagnosis is delayed because of the slow and difficult growth of Capnocytophaga (48 to 72 hours). The molecular techniques (16S rDNA PCR and sequencing), and mass spectrometry appear as attractive methods for reliable identification to the genus. The identification at the species level remains difficult when a single method is used.|$|E

Infected hairs treated with potassium hydroxide fluoresce under ultraviolet light despite that the fungus itself does not normally fluoresce.

Very unstable mutants selected from twelve wild type (WT) subclones of S. ambofaciens ATCC 23877 were investigated.

All reference strains and clinical isolates hybridized to the Mycobacterium genus probe (probe M) on the membrane (100 % sensitivity). Each probe had only one hybridization signal with the corresponding Mycobacterium species or complex (100 % specificity). Compared with DNA sequencing, the RDBH assay correctly identified 337 (99. 1 % accuracy) of the 340 isolates tested. One M. asia isolate and one M. neoaurum isolate were not identified by the RDBH assay due {{to the absence of}} specific probes for the two species on the membrane.

Measurements of dye uptake from solution showed that S. dysenteriae type 1 bound the most dye, followed {{in order of}} uptake by S. flexneri, S. boydii, and S. sonnei. Using the salt aggregation test (SAT) to determine cell surface hydrophobicity, we found the same order of species.

Spontaneous mutation to a Pgm- phenotype {{results in the}} loss of a number of divergent physiological characteristics, including the ability to store hemin and to bind Congo red at 26 degrees C. In this study, we generated and isolated transposon insertion mutants that are hemin storage negative (Hms-) and therefore unable to form <b>pigmented</b> <b>colonies.</b> These mutations are due to single mini-kan insertions within a 19. 5 -kilobase (kb) SalI fragment of chromosomal DNA. Restriction site analysis of eight mutants identified a minimum of six potentially different insertion sites spanning an approximately 10 -kb hemin storage (hms) locus. The 19. 5 -kb SalI fragment (containing approximately 18 kb of Y. pestis DNA and the mini-kan insert) was cloned from one of these mutants, KIM 6 - 2012. By using this cloned fragment as a DNA probe, the mechanism of spontaneous mutation to a Pgm- phenotype was identified as a massive deletion event. The deletion spans at least 18 kb of genomic DNA in spontaneous Pgm- mutants from nine separate strains of Y. pestis. DNA adjacent to the mini-kan insert was used to identify a clone containing a wild-type hms locus. A spontaneous Pgm- mutant of Y pestis KIM containing this clone exhibits an Hms+ phenotype.

This genetic instability is related to large deletions which {{can be associated with}} amplifications of DNA sequences. The influence of three fluoroquinolones (ciprofloxa-cin, enoxacin, and norfloxacin) on this property was investigated. At a survival rate higher than 60 %o, most colonies showed a patchwork phenotype consisting of phenotypically heterogeneous colonies harboring numerous mutant sectors. Moreover, the frequency of Pig-mutants rose to more than 90 %o at survival rates equal to or higher than 10 % 0. Induced Pig-mutants showed the same phenotypical features as did spontaneous mutants. Most of them also harbored deletions, associated in some cases with DNA amplifications, in two loci of the large unstable region, AUD 6 and AUD 90 (derived from amplifiable unit of DNA). The size of deletions in induced mutants could rise to 1. 5 Mb. These results show that ciprofloxacin, enoxacin, and norfloxacin greatly stimulate genetic instability and the occurrence of DNA rearrangements in S. ambofaciens. Moreover, these three fluoroquinolones had the same rank order for both toxic (i. e., antibacterial) and genotoxic activities. If the antibacterial effect of fluoroquinolones in S. ambofaciens is due to their interference with DNA gyrase, as shown for some other organisms, the genotoxic effect observed could be due to their interaction with this type II topoisomerase. This suggests that DNA gyrase is involved in the process of genetic instability in S. ambofaciens...|$|R

We constructed a recA mutant strain of Y. pestis KIM 10 + (YPRA) to test whether the high frequency Crb mutants result from a RecA-mediated deletion of the IS 100 -flanked pgm locus. Two Pgm-associated phenotypes (Crb+ and pesticin sensitivity [Psts]) were used as markers {{for the presence of}} the pgm locus in the RecA+ KIM 10 + and RecA− YPRA strains. In KIM 10 +, both phenotypes were lost at a very high (2 × 10 − 3) frequency, due to the deletion of the entire pgm locus. In YPRA, the Crb+ phenotype was still lost at a high frequency (4. 5 × 10 − 5), although the loss of the Psts phenotype occurred at spontaneous antibiotic resistance mutation frequencies (2 × 10 − 7). These RecA-independent Crb− mutants were caused by mutations in both the hmsHFRS locus and in a newly identified gene, hmsT. Nonpigmented Yersinia pseudotuberculosis and Escherichia coli strains transformed with both hmsT and hmsHFRS became Crb+. This study demonstrates that in a laboratory culture, the Crb+ phenotype is unstable, independent of the pgm locus deletion. We propose that a lack of selection for the CR-binding ability of Y. pestis in vitro may contribute to the mutation frequencies observed at the hmsHFRS and hmsT loci...|$|R
