5|$|At the 2013 inquest {{into the}} roof {{collapse}} (see Government reaction below), testimony {{has revealed that}} many unpublicized structural <b>problems</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> mall dated {{all the way back}} to its initial construction in the late 1970s. In particular, the expansion joint above the escalators, the failure of which appears to have caused the roof deck collapse, was already not properly binding to the concrete, in turn allowing water to seep into the building's seams, as early as 1981 — barely a year after the mall's original opening. The expansion joint was fixed many times, and fully replaced twice, during the building's lifetime, yet always began tearing away from the concrete again shortly after the repairs were complete.|$|E

5|$|Fowler had injury <b>problems</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> {{start of}} the 2005–06 season and rarely {{featured}} when fit, making just two substitute appearances {{in the first four}} months of the season.

5|$|In 1955, Abbe {{travelled}} to the United Kingdom. He went at {{the invitation}} of the London Judo Society (LJS), and was the first master to teach aikido in the UK. That year, he demonstrated aikido at the LJS and at the Royal Albert Hall in London. Abbe came to experience two <b>problems</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> LJS: first, he felt that the students there were more concerned with competition than his theories, and second, he felt that the students did not treat him with the appropriate respect for someone of his rank and experience in the martial arts. According to the International Budo Council (IBC), he founded the IBC in 1955.|$|E

5|$|By 1954, traffic {{entering}} {{the city by}} the Causeway had doubled, leading to renewed calls for a new bridge further west at The Narrows. That bridge was eventually built as the Narrows Bridge. Opened in 1959, the Narrows Bridge alleviated the traffic <b>problems</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> Causeway; the Narrows and the Causeway continued {{to be the only}} road crossings of the Swan River between Fremantle and Maylands until the Windan Bridge of the Graham Farmer Freeway opened in 2000. The opening of the latter eastern bypass coincided with the conversion of the Causeway's two centre lanes to bus lanes. It also lowered traffic levels on the Causeway from 107,000 cars per day to 70,000 within six months. The western roundabout, the state's worst black spot since 1989, was also remodelled in 2000 into a traffic light controlled raindrop roundabout, in conjunction with the other works on the Causeway.|$|E
5|$|By {{winning the}} 1973 FA Cup Final, Sunderland {{qualified}} for the UEFA Cup Winners' Cup, the club's only appearance in European competition to date. Sunderland beat Vasas Budapest 3–0 on aggregate, and were drawn against Lisbon club Sporting in the second round. They won the first leg at Roker Park 2–1 but were defeated 2–0 in the away leg, and were knocked out of the competition 3–2 on aggregate. After spending six seasons in the Second Division, Sunderland were promoted to Division One in the 1975–76 season; they topped the table over Bristol City by three points. However, Sunderland were relegated the following season back into Division Two, without their FA Cup Final winning manager Bob Stokoe, who had resigned because of health <b>problems</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> start of the season. The club celebrated its 100-year centenary in the 1979–80 season with a testimonial against an England XI side, which they lost 2–0.|$|E

5|$|In 1941, with World War II {{raging in}} Europe but the United States not yet at war, Feynman {{spent the summer}} working on {{ballistics}} <b>problems</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> Frankford Arsenal in Pennsylvania. After the attack on Pearl Harbor had brought the United States into the war, Feynman was recruited by Robert R. Wilson, who was working on means to produce enriched uranium for use in an atomic bomb, as part of {{what would become the}} Manhattan Project. Wilson's team at Princeton was working on a device called an isotron, which would electromagnetically separate uranium-235 from uranium-238. This was done in a quite different manner from that used by the calutron that was under development by a team under Wilson's former mentor, Ernest O. Lawrence, at the Radiation Laboratory of the University of California. On paper, the isotron was many times more efficient than the calutron, but Feynman and Paul Olum struggled {{to determine whether or not}} it was practical. Ultimately, on Lawrence's recommendation, the isotron project was abandoned.|$|E
5|$|In {{order to}} {{strengthen}} for 1996–97, Smith signed striker Nigel Jemson and spent £100,000 on Leyton Orient defender Darren Purse. In order to finance these deals he sold Chris Allen to Nottingham Forest for £450,000. Oxford knocked Premier League team Sheffield Wednesday {{out of the}} League Cup {{en route to a}} fourth round exit. Oxford were fifth in the table in December 1996, but chairman Robin Herd resigned amidst financial <b>problems</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> club, and work on the new stadium came to a halt as the club debt reached £13million. Smith raised funds by selling Elliott to Leicester for £1.7million, and signed veteran defender Chris Whyte on a free transfer as a short-term replacement. Oxford finished the season in 17th place, but the club's financial situation became ever bleaker. Numerous players were sold, though Smith was allowed to spend £170,000 on defender Phil Whelan. Smith left the Manor Ground midway through 1997–98 with Oxford 16th in the league, and his assistant Crosby managed to maintain the club's mid-table position {{at the end of the}} season.|$|E
5|$|Mills {{took over}} as player-manager at King's Lynn in September 1998 and was sent off on his playing debut, a 3–2 away defeat to Worcester City in the Southern League Premier Division on 26 September. His first goal for the club came after {{shooting}} into the bottom corner from a Lee Wilson back-heel in a 3–3 home draw with Salisbury City on 6 March 1999. He made 30 appearances and scored one goal in 1998–99, as his team finished 10th in the Southern League Premier Division. King's Lynn improved on their league performance in 1999–2000, finishing in fifth place in the table. Mills continued to appear frequently in the team, playing in 34 matches and scoring one goal. He resigned as King's Lynn manager on 8 November 2000 due to major financial <b>problems</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> club, and had made 16 appearances and scored one goal {{up to that point}} in 2000–01.
