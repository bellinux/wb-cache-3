40|$|New Zealand has a {{total area}} of 66. 4 million acres, of which 44 million are {{classified}} as occupied farm land. More than 40 per cent of this latter area is held under leasehold tenure. The Crown is the landlord of 14. 9 million acres which are let under several forms of leasing arrangement. In recent years there have been marked increases in land prices throughout New Zealand. A result {{of this has been}} a substantial increase in rents, which has caused many farmers to become disaffected with leasehold tenure. The Committee of Investigation into Rentals and Freeholding of Crown Leases (1968), convened by the Minister of Lands, studied this problem and has forwarded to Parliament recommendations for an amendment to the 1948 Land Act. The subject of this study is Crown <b>Renewable</b> <b>lease</b> tenure and its effect on farm investment. It falls naturally into three parts: firstly, a descriptive section providing a resume of the history of land tenure in New Zealand, and defining the terms of Crown <b>Renewable</b> <b>lease</b> tenure. The second part investigates the micro-economic aspects of this form of tenancy. This section takes as given the terms of the lease and investigates various courses of action at the farm level. A case study approach is used to explore the economics of alternative investment opportunities open to an individual lessee. In the third part, macro-economic aspects of Crown <b>Renewable</b> <b>lease</b> tenure are investigated. This section examines whether or not this form of tenure promotes efficient resource allocation, and is concerned with the community's point of view rather than that of the individual...|$|R

30|$|Geographically, the ‘high country’ of New Zealand’s South Island {{comprises}} the eastern {{slope of the}} Southern Alps, the main divide that forms {{the backbone of the}} South Island. From 1856 to 1992, the high country enjoyed a stable mix of land tenure that, to start, made pastoralism viable in the harshly beautiful landscapes. From 1856 to 1992, the Crown (later to become the New Zealand (NZ) government) owned 2.4 milliona ha of South Island high country land. For 150 [*]years and under several successive land acts, the Crown leased land to runholdersb ‘for pastoral purposes only’ (Land Act 1948 [*]s. 51 (1)(d)). Under pastoral leases, runholders’ property rights were strong – 33 -year <b>perpetually</b> <b>renewable</b> terms – but narrow – no subdivision, no golf courses, and no soil disturbance ([Brower 2008]).|$|R
50|$|It was a {{learning}} experience for the Kwara State government which decided to seize the opportunity {{of the situation in}} Zimbabwe, where white farmers were being displaced by the Zimbabwean government, to offer the farmers an opportunity to farm in Kwara.

50|$|One of {{the most}} serious matters of the JAWI was that of the Japanese land law.

This team successfully lobbied to delay passage of the law, defeat it, and introduce a new law. This new law allowed <b>renewable</b> <b>leases</b> of up to five years.
