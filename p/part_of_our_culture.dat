40|$|Purpose Storytelling is {{a natural}} way for humans to express {{ourselves}} – we have always told stories to each other (e. g. Shankar et al. 2001; Green 2006; Kent 2015). It is <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>our</b> <b>cultures</b> as an entertainment but also as means to pass e. g. knowledge and values (Spear & Roper 2016). Well-told stories and great myths (Holt 2004, 28) can raise emotions (Burke 1969, 55 – 59; Green 2004; Green 2006) and engage listeners to use their senses (Hiltunen 2002, XVI). Among organization researchers, storytelling has been studied as a <b>part</b> <b>of</b> organizational identity formation already for long (Boje 1991; Coupland & Brown 2004; Johansen 2014) but the subject is still relatively new for marketing researchers.

Even though companies are recommended to arise and lead conversations between stakeholders and the brand (Golant 2012) storytelling is not fully understood or investigated yet in corporate brand identity context.

5000|$|The {{representation}} {{of males and}} females on the television screen has been a subject of much discussion since the television became commercially available in the late 1930s. In 1964 Betty Friedan claimed that [...] "television has represented the American Woman as a [...] "stupid, unattractive, insecure little household drudge who spends her martyred mindless, boring days dreaming of love—and plotting nasty revenge against her husband." [...] As women started to revolt and protest to become equals in society in the 1960s and 1970s, their portrayal on the television was an issue that they addressed. Journalist Susan Faludi suggested, [...] "The practices and programming of network television in the 1980s were an attempt to get back to those earlier stereotypes of women." [...] Through television, even the most homebound women can experience <b>parts</b> <b>of</b> <b>our</b> <b>culture</b> once considered primarily male, such as sports, war, business, medicine, law, and politics. Since at least the 1990s there has been a trend of showing males as insufferable and possibly spineless fools (e.g. Homer Simpson, Ray Burone). The inherent intimacy of television makes it one of the few public arenas in our society where men routinely wear makeup and are judged as much on their personal appearance and their [...] "style" [...] as on their [...] "accomplishments." ...|$|R
