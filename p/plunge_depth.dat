40|$|Abstract: The {{effect of}} process {{parameters}} on mechanical and microstructural properties of AA 2139 T 8 joints produced by {{friction stir welding}} (FSW) was analysed by means of statistical tools. Three different parameters were taken into account: angular speed (ω), welding speed (va), and <b>plunging</b> <b>depth</b> (p); each of them was varied on three levels. Forces and temperatures achieved during the welding were monitored and analysed for all joints. An accurate microstructural anal-ysis was performed: the occurrence of some remarkable defects, typical of FSW, such as tunnel or lack of penetration, was related to actual process parameters adopted. The extension of each FSW characteristic zone was measured and the main grain dimension within each of these zones was measured. The mechanical properties of the joints were evaluated by means ofVickers microhard-ness measurements and tensile tests at room temperature. It was observed that the joint welded with lowest angular speed, highest welding speed, and greatest <b>plunging</b> <b>depth</b> attained the best performances.

50|$|During {{a time of}} high {{unemployment}} {{during the winter of}} 1908 and 1909, over 700 men relaid the park, including planting banks with shrubs and trees, diverting the Gore Brook and creating a lake and island covering just over 6 acre. Local legend speaks of a tunnel running from the boat house, underneath the lake (only a few feet deep) to somewhere on the island, though this was, in fact, never true. Access to the island was only ever possible by boat. The park, named Platt Fields Park, was formally opened on 7 May 1910 by the Lord Mayor of Manchester, Sir Charles Behrens. The Main Lake was provided with a large boat house and wood covered slipway. It housed not only a fleet of large, clinker built rowing boats and skiffs but also a fine motor launch, the Archie Littlemore, which gave rides during the summer months. 'Twice Around the Island'. At some point over the following five years, a half acre, kidney shaped paddling pool was constructed, on the Hart Road side of the main lake. On the side of the paddling pool away from the Main Lake, two further model boating lakes were constructed. The largest was the home of Platt Fields Model Yacht Club, which had a large, veranda fronted boathouse adjacent to the lake. Alongside was the children's boating lake. This shallow, circular lake was constructed entirely above ground, with raised concrete sides. This meant that children could safely sail, without any danger of falling in. Moving away from the model lakes, towards the Hart Road entrance, the long, narrow field on the right hand side of the path was home to the local model engineering society, which installed a triple gauge track for large model railway vehicles, including 'live steam' locomotives. The track was raised above the ground on concrete pylons, drivers and passengers riding astride the track. In the centre of the circuit of track stood a wooden club house. Moving on from this point, anti clockwise around the main lake brought you to the Platt Fields Lido. A 25 yard long, open air swimming pool, with changing facilities. The <b>plunge</b> <b>depth</b> was 3 to 6 feet. In later years the Lido was closed, the plunge filled with soil and surrounded by a fence. This became a rabbit warren, the centre piece of a Pet's Corner. The changing and ancillary buildings were converted into cages for small animals and birds. In latter years, all traces of the former Lido have been removed and the area landscaped. The park was used for a variety of sports, including tennis, football, bowling and cricket. More work was carried out during another time of {{high unemployment}}, between 1919 and 1925, when the park and playing fields were levelled, and bowling greens and tennis courts were constructed. Beside the path which leads from the corner of the Main Lake, towards Platt Hall, a large circular amphitheatre was sunk into the ground. At its centre a stage, with covered band stand, was surrounded by terraced seating. No trace of this installation remains today, unless you consult an aerial photograph. The position of the amphitheatre is now clearly delineated by a ring of trees which have grown up around the buried structure. A Speakers' Corner was once located near to the adjacent Holy Trinity Platt Church.|$|E

We measured the jumping performance of brook trout as a function of waterfall height (2 - 24 cm), <b>plunge</b> pool <b>depth</b> (8 - 18 cm), and fish size (total length [TL], mm). Waterfall height and TL had the largest effects on jumping performance. Maximum heights jumped decreased as waterfall height increased or TL decreased. Our second experiment measured the effects of waterfall widths of 10, 20, and 30 cm on age- 0 brook trout jumping ability for a fixed waterfall height of 20 cm and a <b>plunge</b> pool <b>depth</b> of 40 cm. Significantly fewer fish jumped through the 10 -cm-wide waterfall than through either the 20 - or 30 -cm-wide waterfalls.

40|$|Abstract: Friction stir welding (FSW) is a {{solid-state}} joining {{process for}} materials with low melting points. The process uses a rotating tool {{that consists of}} a shoulder and a pin. The tool plastically deforms the material with its pin and then forges together the parent materials underneath the shoulder. Past research has established that the axial {{force on the tool}} that creates the forging pressure is a function of <b>plunge</b> <b>depth,</b> traverse speed, and rotation speed. Historically, force control of FSW has been accomplished by varying the <b>plunge</b> <b>depth</b> of the tool. The research presented in this paper examines the force control of FSW by varying each of the process parameters separately. A force controller was implemented on a retrofitted milling machine. The closed-loop proportional–integral–derivative (PID) control architecture was tuned using the Ziegler–Nichols method.

The main {{aims of the}} present work are to (1) analyze the effect of welding speed, rotation speed, <b>plunge</b> <b>depth,</b> and shoulder diameter on the formation of internal defects during friction stir welding (FSW), (2) study the effect on axial force and torque during welding, (c) optimize the welding parameters for producing internal defect-free welds, and (d) propose and validate a simple criterion to identify defect-free weld formation. The base material used for FSW throughout the work is Al 6061 T 6 having a thickness value of 2. 1 mm. Only butt welding of sheets is aimed in the present work. It is observed from the present analysis that higher welding speed, higher rotation speed, and higher <b>plunge</b> <b>depth</b> are preferred for producing a weld without internal defects. All the shoulder diameters used for FSW in the present work produced defect-free welds. The axial force and torque are not constant and a large variation is seen with respect to FSW parameters that produced defective welds. In the case of defect-free weld formation, the axial force and torque are relatively constant. A simple criterion, (a,tau/a,p) (defective) > (a,tau/a,p) (defect free) and (a,F/a,p) (defective) > (a,F/a,p) (defect free), is proposed with this observation for identifying the onset of defect-free weld formation.

Moreover, the Energy Dispersive Spectroscopy (EDS) analysis also revealed the presence of intermetallic compounds in the Stir Zone and which correlated to the X- ray diffraction analyses. Higher microhardness values were obtained in the stir zone for all the welds due to the smaller grains present in this region resulting from the frictional stirring of the tool.
