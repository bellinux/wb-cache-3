5|$|Jacob Isaackszoon van Ruisdael {{was born}} in Haarlem in 1628 or 1629 into a family of <b>painters,</b> all landscapists. The number of <b>painters</b> in the family, and the {{multiple}} spellings of the Ruisdael name, have hampered attempts to document his life and attribute his works.|$|E
5|$|The most {{usual way}} in the 15th century for a patron to {{commission}} a piece was to visit a master's workshop. Only {{a certain number of}} masters could operate within any city's bounds; they were regulated by artisan guilds to whom they had to be affiliated to be allowed to operate and receive commissions. Guilds protected and regulated painting, overseeing production, export trade and raw material supply; and they maintained discrete sets of rules for panel <b>painters,</b> cloth <b>painters</b> and book illuminators. For example, the rules set higher citizenship requirements for miniaturists and prohibited them from using oils. Overall, panel <b>painters</b> enjoyed the highest level of protection, with cloth <b>painters</b> ranking below.|$|E
5|$|The {{principal}} Danish <b>painters</b> included Karl Madsen, Laurits Tuxen, Marie Krøyer, Carl Locher, Viggo Johansen, Thorvald Niss, {{and most}} notably, Anna and Michael Ancher and Peder Severin Krøyer.

The gatherings in Skagen were not restricted to <b>painters.</b> The Danish writers Georg Brandes, Holger Drachmann and Henrik Pontoppidan and the Swedish composer Hugo Alfvén were also members of the group.|$|E

5|$|During the Northern Song (960–1126 CE), a {{new class}} of scholar-artists emerged who did not possess the tromp l'oiel skills of the academy <b>painters</b> nor even the {{proficiency}} of common marketplace <b>painters.</b> The literati's painting was simpler and at times quite unschooled, yet they would criticize these other two groups as mere professionals, since they relied on paid commissions for their livelihood and did not paint merely for enjoyment or self-expression. The scholar-artists considered that <b>painters</b> who concentrated on realistic depictions, who employed a colorful palette, or, worst of all, who accepted monetary payment for their work were no better than butchers or tinkers in the marketplace. They were not to be considered real artists.|$|E
5|$|However, {{during the}} Song period, {{there were many}} {{acclaimed}} court <b>painters</b> and they were highly esteemed by emperors and the royal family. One of the greatest landscape <b>painters</b> given patronage by the Song court was Zhang Zeduan (1085–1145), who painted the original Along the River During Qingming Festival scroll, {{one of the most}} well-known masterpieces of Chinese visual art. Emperor Gaozong of Song (1127–1162) once commissioned an art project of numerous paintings for the Eighteen Songs of a Nomad Flute, based on the woman poet Cai Wenji (177–250 AD) of the earlier Han dynasty. The Southern Song dynasty court <b>painters</b> included Zhao Mengjian (趙孟堅, c.1199–1264), a member of the Imperial family, known for popularising the Three Friends of Winter.|$|E

5|$|The {{trends of}} large polychrome {{paintings}} {{continued into the}} Edo period (1603–1868). The Rinpa school, best represented by Tawaraya Sōtatsu and Ogata Kōrin, used vibrant colors to depict classical themes from Japanese literature and Heian period poetry. In the 18th century, paintings of Yuan dynasty scholar-amateur <b>painters</b> were brought to Japan and imitated, giving rise to the Nanga or Bunjinga style of painting. Two {{of the most prominent}} <b>painters</b> of this school were Ike no Taiga and Yosa Buson.|$|E

5|$|According to David A. Norris, {{a scholar}} specializing in Serbian {{cultural}} history, conditions in 19th-century Serbia were unsuitable {{for the development}} of visual art. Materials were difficult to come by, studio and exhibition spaces were virtually non-existent, and there were no art patrons willing to financially support <b>painters</b> and purchase their finished works. In {{the first half of the}} 19th century, Serbian visual artists dedicated themselves almost exclusively to decorating the walls of churches and producing icons and other religious objects. There were some <b>painters</b> of Serb heritage living outside Serbia, such as Uroš Knežević and Jovan Popović, who resided in the Austrian Empire.|$|E
5|$|Anna and Michael Ancher, Krøyer and Tuxen {{continued}} to paint in Skagen {{until well into}} the 20th century and were occasionally joined by their earlier friends. Two core members of the group, Drachmann and Krøyer, died in 1908 and 1909, bringing the traditional gatherings of the group to an end. There were nevertheless other <b>painters,</b> sometimes referred to as the younger group of Skagen <b>painters,</b> who {{continued to}} visit the area. They included Jørgen Aabye, Tupsy and Gad Frederik Clement, Ella Heide, Ludvig Karsten, Frederik Lange and Johannes Wilhjelm, some of whom settled in the area until the 1930s or even later. Skagens Museum has a number of their works in its collection.|$|E

5|$|Burne-Jones exerted a {{considerable}} influence on French painting. He was also highly influential among French symbolist <b>painters,</b> from 1889. His work inspired poetry by Swinburne– Swinburne's 1866 Poems & Ballads {{is dedicated to}} Burne-Jones.|$|E
5|$|Caracalla's {{memory was}} revived {{in the art}} of late {{eighteenth-century}} French <b>painters.</b> His tyrannical career became the subject of the work of several French <b>painters</b> such as Greuze, , David, Bonvoisin, J.A.C. Pajou, and Lethière. Their fascination with Caracalla was a reflection of the growing discontent of the French people with the French monarchy. Caracalla's visibility was influenced by the existence of several literary sources in French that included both translations of ancient works and contemporary works of the time. Caracalla's likeness was readily available to the <b>painters</b> due to the distinct style of his portraiture and his unusual soldier-like choice of fashion that distinguished him from other emperors. The artworks may have served as a warning that absolute monarchy could become the horror of tyranny and that disaster could come about if the regime failed to reform. Art historian Susan Wood suggests that this reform was for the absolute monarchy to become a constitutional monarchy, as per the original goal of revolution, rather than the republic that it eventually became. Wood also notes the similarity between Caracalla and his crimes leading to his assassination and the eventual uprising against, and death of, King Louis XVI: both rulers had {{died as a result of}} their apparent tyranny.|$|E
5|$|Contemporary <b>painters</b> {{are also}} {{inspired}} by El Greco's art. Kysa Johnson used El Greco's {{paintings of the}} Immaculate Conception as the compositional framework for some of her works, and the master's anatomical distortions are somewhat reflected in Fritz Chesnut's portraits.|$|E
