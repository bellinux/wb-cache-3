30|$|PET waste can be {{recycled}} {{in many ways}} including chemical and mechanical methods. Hopewell (Hopewell et al. 2009) has summarized various terminologies used for plastic recycling. The primary recycling method is re-extrusion, the classical method of recycling PET. This method involves recycling of scrap materials to form original products. However, because various polymers and other materials such as paper, pigments, metals, and adhesives are used as <b>plastic</b> <b>packing</b> materials, this makes recycling by this method difficult. Although this method has the advantages of simplicity and low cost, {{it is not a}} popular method that requires uncontaminated scrap with only a single type of waste.|$|R
