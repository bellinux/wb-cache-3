5|$|The {{chair of}} European Parliament Mediator for International <b>Parental</b> <b>Child</b> <b>Abduction</b> was {{established}} in 1987 by initiative of British politician and MEP Charles Henry Plumb, {{with the goal of}} helping minor children of international couples victim of parental abduction. The Mediator finds negotiated solutions in the higher interest of the minor when said minor is abducted by a parent following separation of the couple, regardless whether married or unmarried. Since its institution, the chair has been held by Mairead McGuinnes (since 2014), Roberta Angelilli (2009-2014), Evelyne Gebhardt (2004-2009), Mary Banotti (1995-2004), and Marie-Claude Vayssade (1987-1994). The Mediator's main task is to assist parents in finding a solution in the minor's best interest through mediation, i.e. a form of controversy resolution alternative to lawsuit. The Mediator is activated by request of a citizen and, after evaluating the request, starts a mediation process aimed at reaching an agreement. Once subscribed by both parties and the Mediator, the agreement is official. The nature of the agreement is that of a private contract between parties. In defining the agreement, the European Parliament offers the parties the juridical support necessary to reach a sound, lawful agreement based on legality and equity. The agreement can be ratified by the competent national courts and can also lay the foundation for consensual separation or divorce.|$|E

2500|$|One major obstacle, {{noted by}} Jeremy Morley, an {{attorney}} who had worked on <b>parental</b> <b>child</b> <b>abduction</b> cases in Japan, was that Japanese family law did not align to {{the parameters of the}} Hague Convention and that new legislation would need to be introduced for Japan's signature and ratification. Hans van Loon, Secretary General of the Hague Convention on Private International Law, pointed out that [...] "Japanese civil law stresses that in cases where custody cannot be reached by agreement between the parents, the Japanese Family Court will resolve the issue based on {{the best interest of the}} child. However, compliance with Family Court rulings is essentially voluntary, which renders any ruling unenforceable unless both parents agree." [...] Yuko Nishitani, an associate professor at Tohoku University and director of the Hague Academy of International Law, agreed, saying that [...] "the real reason Japan has not signed the Hague Convention is that no enforcement mechanism exists in the country. Signing the convention would expose these flaws." [...] An official of Ministry of Foreign Affairs stated, [...] "The Japanese government's position is 'not interfering in civil affairs.'" ...|$|E

5000|$|<b>Parental</b> <b>child</b> abduction: {{a family}} relative's (usually parent's) {{unauthorized}} custody of a <b>child</b> without <b>parental</b> agreement {{and contrary to}} family law ruling, which largely removes the child from care, access and contact of the other parent and family side.

2500|$|In {{the case}} of Japan, CNN quoted an unnamed {{official}} in the U.S. Embassy in Tokyo who stated, [...] "Our two nations approach divorce and child-rearing differently. <b>Parental</b> <b>child</b> <b>abduction</b> is not considered a crime in Japan." [...] However, this statement is contradicted by several Japanese news media sources which report arrests involving parental abduction in Japan. The Supreme Court of Japan categorically ruled that a parental abduction in which force and coercion is used to remove child constitutes the felony of kidnapping of a minor irrespective of person's custodial right. The case concerned a couple who were separated but not divorced so the abducting father held joint custody. [...] Therefore, while civil liability (or criminal liability in some countries) for parental abduction arise out of custodial interference of a parent and is not legally defined as kidnapping, in Japan, parental abduction is a kidnapping if it disrupts a child's residence or relationship with the primary caregiver. At the same time Japanese family courts have no enforcement mechanism in civil matters so they strongly encourage parents to engage in mediation in order to agree to custody arrangements {{on their own and}} rarely intervene in matters such as visitation and child support which are seen as private. [...] Furthermore, it is rare for a nation to extradite one of its own citizens to another country for alleged parental abduction. On the other hand, a foreign national father, trying to re-abduct his child in Japan by force, may face arrest and possible criminal prosecution irrespective of his custodial status in the child's home country. Moreover, a foreign father trying to abduct children by force to another country would face the extra charge of [...] "kidnapping for the purpose of transporting the kidnapped person to a foreign country" [...] (Article 226(1) of the Penal Code), which carries the penalty of imprisonment with labor for a limited period of not less than two years. The law, which was originally designed as an extra penalty for the kidnapping of a minor for sexual slavery in China, is now used for preventing forced abduction from Japan by a parent. This provision of the Penal Code was amended in 2005 so that it covers kidnapping and abduction from any country, not just Japan. This means that it constitutes a criminal offence under Japanese law for a Japanese national to abduct his or her own child by force in another country and bring the child to Japan, and in such cases Japanese police and prosecutors could initiate criminal proceedings. However, this provision likely will not apply to cases where a Japanese mother who is the primary caregiver brings her children back to Japan in defiance of the custodial ruling of a foreign court, as this would not likely be seen to involve coercion or force against the child.|$|E

40|$|This Note {{begins in}} Part II {{with the history}} and {{development}} of the 1980 Hague Convention and discusses the intricacies of the international attempt to regulate <b>parental</b> <b>child</b> <b>abductions.</b> Further, Part II introduces the U. S. circuit court split regarding whether the losing parent has the right to stay the proceedings while perfecting an appeal. As this Note explains, such an unpredictable judicial process within different jurisdictions of the United States frustrates the overall purpose of the 1980 Hague Convention, impeding a foreign court’s ability to take the case and offer finality to the parents and children involved. Finally, Part II introduces the Chafin decision, which ultimately decided that, according to the right to due process of law under the U. S. Constitution, a parent who loses the right to custody at the trial level has the right to an appeal. Part III analyzes the Chafin decision, discussing the benefits of having a conclusive structure to deal with 1980 Hague Convention appeals within the United States, while also pointing to several issues that must be resolved before the international system can become a fluid and cohesive unit. Ultimately, this Note suggests that while legislative action would be the most effective means of change, the courts cannot wait for lawmakers to act; they must have a plan to expedite procedures {{for the benefit of the}} families involved in such international custody disputes. It is imperative that the U. S. circuits have a plan of attack as the problem of international custody disputes shows no signs of decreasing...|$|R

2500|$|The term {{international}} <b>child</b> <b>abduction</b> {{is generally}} synonymous with international <b>parental</b> kidnapping, <b>child</b> snatching, and child stealing. [...] However, the more precise legal usage of international <b>child</b> <b>abduction</b> originates in {{private international law}} and refers to the illegal removal of children from their home by an acquaintance or family member to a foreign country. In this context, [...] "illegal" [...] is normally taken to mean [...] "in breach of custodial rights" [...] and [...] "home" [...] {{is defined as the}} child's habitual residence. As implied by the [...] "breach of custodial rights," [...] the phenomenon of international <b>child</b> <b>abduction</b> generally involves an illegal removal that creates a jurisdictional conflict of laws whereby multiple authorities and jurisdictions could conceivably arrive at seemingly reasonable and conflicting custodial decisions with geographically limited application. Such a result often strongly affects a child's access and connection to half their family and may cause the loss of their former language, culture, name and nationality, it violates numerous children's rights, and can cause severe psychological and emotional trauma to the child and family left behind.|$|R
40|$|Within {{the context}} of {{recognition}} and enforcement of foreign judgments the recognition and enforcement of foreign custody orders is unique. By reason {{of the fact that}} custody orders are always modifiable "in {{the best interests of the}} child" they cannot be regarded as final orders and are thus not capable of recognition and enforcement on the same basis as final orders. The failure of courts to afford foreign custody orders recognition and enforcement in the normal course has created the potential for a person deprived of the custody of a child to remove the child from the jurisdiction of a court rendering a custody order to another jurisdiction within which he or she may seek a new, more favourable order. This potential for behaviour in contempt of an existing order has been exploited by numerous parents who feel aggrieved by custody orders. The problem of <b>parental</b> <b>child</b> snatching has escalated to such a degree that the Hague Convention on the Civil Aspects of International <b>Child</b> <b>Abduction</b> was drawn up to introduce uniform measures amongst member states to address this problem. Despite being a meaningful step in the fight against international <b>child</b> <b>abduction</b> the Hague Convention does not fully resolve the problem. For this reason other measures have been suggested to supplement the Convention. The different approaches taken in South Africa, the United Kingdom, Australia and the United States of America to recognition and enforcement of foreign custody orders and the measures to overcome the problem of international <b>child</b> <b>abduction</b> are examined and a comparative methodology applied to the design of a model approach for South Africa.
