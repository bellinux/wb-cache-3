40|$|The {{design of}} an {{interferometer}} with a 3 1 / 2 " diameter light field and {{its application to}} a continuously operating 4 " x 10 " supersonic wind tunnel are discussed. The main features of this interferometer are (1) its very law cost compared to previous designs, (2) its light weight and flexibility, (3) a simple device permitting the instrument to be used also as a Schlieren system, and (4) its unique feature of <b>passing</b> both <b>light</b> <b>beams</b> through the test section to minimize {{the effect of the}} side wall boundary layers in the interferograms...|$|R
40|$|Optical {{monitoring}} systems {{are necessary to}} manufacture multilayer thin-film optical filters with low tolerance on spectrum specification. Furthermore, to have better accuracy on the measurement of film thickness, direct monitoring is a must. Direct monitoring implies acquiring spectrum data from the optical component undergoing the film deposition itself, in real time. In making film depositions on surfaces of optical components, the high vacuum evaporator chamber {{is the most popular}} equipment. Inside the evaporator, {{at the top of the}} chamber, there is a metallic support with several holes where the optical components are assembled. This metallic support has rotary motion to promote film homogenization. To acquire a measurement of the spectrum of the film in deposition, it is necessary to <b>pass</b> a <b>light</b> <b>beam</b> through a glass witness undergoing the film deposition process, and collect a sample of the <b>light</b> <b>beam</b> using a spectrometer. As both the <b>light</b> <b>beam</b> and the <b>light</b> collector are stationary, a synchronization system is required to identify the moment at which the optical component <b>passes</b> through the <b>light</b> <b>beam...</b>|$|R

40|$|We give {{analytic}} expressions for image {{properties of}} objects seen around point mass lenses {{embedded in a}} flat ΛCDM universe. An embedded lens in an otherwise homogeneous universe offers a more realistic representation of the lens's gravity field and its associated deflection properties than does the conventional linear superposition theory. Embedding reduces {{the range of the}} gravitational force acting on <b>passing</b> <b>light</b> <b>beams</b> thus altering all quantities such as deflection angles, amplifications, shears and Einstein ring sizes. Embedding also exhibits the explicit effect of the cosmological constant on these same lensing quantities. In this paper we present these new results and demonstrate how they can be used. The effects of embedding on image properties, although small i. e., usually less than a fraction of a percent, have a more pronounced effect on image distortions in weak lensing where the effects can be larger than 10...|$|R
40|$|The white {{appearance}} of familiar {{objects such as}} clouds, snow, milk, or foam {{is due to the}} random scattering of light by the sample. As we all know, pure water is clear and easily <b>passes</b> a <b>beam</b> of <b>light.</b> However, tiny water droplets, such as those in a cloud, scatter light because the air and water droplet have different indexes of refraction. When many droplets, or scattering sites, are present, the incident light is scattered in random directions and the sample takes on a milky white appearance. In a glass of milk, the scattering is due to small colloidal particles. The white {{appearance of}} shaving cream, or foam, is due to the scattering of light at the water-bubble interface. Diffusing wave spectroscopy (DWS) is a laser light-scattering technique used to noninvasively probe the particle dynamics in systems that strongly scatter light. The technique takes advantage of the diffuse nature of light, which is reflected or transmitted from samples such as foams, dense colloidal suspensions (such as paint and milk), emulsions, liquid crystals, sandpiles, and even biological tissues...|$|R
