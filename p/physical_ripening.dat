40|$|ABSTRACT The myrtle (Eugenia gracillima Kiaersk.) is {{a native}} fruit species in the Chapada of Araripe, state of Pernambuco, Brazil. The fruits are {{collected}} from the wild and are consumed fresh or processed as pulp, juice, jelly, liquor or desserts. Myrtle fruit production is of significant socioeconomic value for the region and, therefore, the description of myrtle fruit ripening stages {{may contribute to the}} development of its production chain. As a result, the objective of the present study was to evaluate the <b>physical,</b> quality and <b>ripening</b> changes of myrtle fruits at different developmental stages. The fruits were picked at five distinctive stages and evaluated for longitudinal and transverse diameters; fresh, dry and water mass; water contents; soluble solids (SS); titratable acidity (TA); pH; SS/TA ratio; carbohydrates (starch, total, reducing and nonreducing sugars); ascorbic acid; total pectin, soluble pectins and percentage of pectin solubilization; polymeric, oligomeric and dimeric phenolics; total anthocyanins, carotenoids and chlorophyll; and yellow flavonoids. Along fruit ripening processes increases in SS, anthocyanins and carotenoids, in the SS/TA ratio and of percentages of pectin solubilization were determined. On the other hand, decreases in TA and total chlorophyll were observed. The ripening stage at which peel color is completely dark red (ripening stage 4) is most appropriate to harvest myrtle fruits for human consumption...|$|R
40|$|It {{has been}} {{estimated}} that one-fourth of the fresh fruits harvested are never consumed because of spoilage. This spoilage amounts to many thousands of tons of fruits which are valued annually at several million dollars. Several factors are responsible for the post-harvest spoilage of fruits, namely, pathological, physiological, and mechanical. Men in the past have used various methods to control pathological spoilage of foods. The recent development of nuclear radiation, antibiotics, fungicides, and packaging films provides new methods for prolonging the shelf-life of many fruits. These may prove important in countries like India where refrigeration facilities are not readily available and food shortage has always been a problem. Likewise, in the United States, the present-day marketing of fresh fruits has become more and more complex because centers of consumption are increasingly remote from centers of production. To understand physiological and mechanical spoilage of fruits one should know that perishable products are alive, even though the connection with the source of nourishment has been severed. Continued metabolism and increase in respiration result in over-ripeness, physiological decay, and wilting. The deterioration of fruits by the processes of accelerated respiration induced by <b>ripening,</b> <b>physical</b> changes, and subsequent mechanical damage during transit cannot be stopped; but it can be retarded by lowering the temperature, by treating with respiratory inhibitors, and by careful handling...|$|R

Alexander the great and Arab conquerors introduced date fruit in Indo-Pak subcontinent after that date extended as a food item. Date palm is among the oldest cultivated plants in history of mankind, being used as food for 6000 years. Date is a world agricultural industry with total production of 7. 5 million metric tonnes (MT) of fruit and Pakistan contribution is 10. 34 metric tonnes. Date palm (2 n= 36) is dioecious monocotyledonous belonging to Arecaceae family. Fertilization and fruit set are consequences of pollination as there is an interesting but uncommon effect known as metaxenia, the direct influence of pollen on maternal tissues of date palm. Pollen not only control the fruit set, size of fruits and seeds but also effect the time of ripening. As pollen grains caused the great diversity and variations in size, quality and ripening time so 9 different pollen sources were selected to study the differential behaviour of pollen parents on fruit characteristics of two female cultivars i. e Hillawi and Khadrawy. Fruit was harvested at Khalal stage from controlled pollinated treatments and pysicochemical analysis was carried out to study the metaxenial effect of different pollen. <b>Physical</b> characters including <b>ripening</b> time, bunch weight, fruit length, fruit width, fruit area, pulp weight, seed weight and biochemical characters, total sugars, DPPH, ascorbic acid, total phenolic contents, total soluble solids, total proteins, sucrose, glucose, fructose, and enzymatic activities (peroxidase, catalaze, superoxidase ans protease) were highly variables. Data regarding all physicochemical characters was analyzed statistically using the two factor factorial in Randomized Complete Block Design (RCBD) that showed the significant differences in all variables. Duncan multiple range test was used to discrete the means (using the statistica 9. 1) revealed that different pollen sources respond variably.

40|$|In unripe {{marine clay}} soils, water flow occurs in {{relation}} to shrinkage and swelling of the soil material.

For the condition of a closed boundary at the top and a constant pressure head at the bottom, there are significant differences in downward flux density with and without an overburden component to total potential.

Initial soil formation was the main process involved and may also have been the first stage of soil genesis in the older polders. Tidal movements and rivers caused sedimentation as a low tidal marsh, dissected by some big and many small creeks. During and after sedimentation soil formation started ('ripening). Loss of water (<b>physical</b> <b>ripening)</b> caused shrinkage and subsidence, which could be measured by observations on water and humus content and grain-size distribution.

Changes in nature of these components were also used as ripening characteristics. Biological ripening started also with penetration of oxygen into the soil and controlled development of structures and homogenization. Soils were described and classified according to genesis.

40|$|Background and Goal. In the Netherlands {{about 40}} million m 3 of {{sediment}} {{has to be}} dredged annually for both maintenance and environmental reasons. Temporary upland disposal is the most widely adopted alternative for dredged sediments worldwide. For good management of temporary disposal sites, knowledge is needed on the processes controlling {{the behavior of the}} sediments during disposal. Therefore, {{a review of the literature}} was made to get an integrated overview about processes that take place during temporary disposal. Ripening. After disposal of clayey sediments, the following spontaneous dewatering processes can be distinguished: sedimentation, consolidation, and ripening. Sedimentation and consolidation are relatively fast processes, whereas ripening can take up to several years. In a remediation perspective, the ripening of sediments is the most important dewatering process. Ripening, which may be subdivided into physical, chemical, and biological ripening, transforms sediment into soil. <b>Physical</b> <b>ripening</b> is the irreversible loss of water and results in the formation of soil prisms separated by shrinkage cracks. Continuing water loss causes a breaking up of the prisms into aggregates. The aggregates produced by this ongoing desiccation process usually remain quite large (> 50 mm) and can only be further broken down by weathering processes like wetting and drying or by tillage. As a result of the aeration caused by <b>physical</b> <b>ripening,</b> also chemical and biological ripening take place. Chemical ripening can be defined as the changes in chemical composition due to oxidation reactions and leaching of soluble substances. Biological ripening is the result of the activity of all kinds of soil fauna and flora that develop as a result of aeration, including both the larger and the microscopic forms of life. Decomposition and mineralization of soil organic matter caused by micro-organisms can be seen as the most important aspect of biological ripening. many interactions exist between the different ripening processes. Conclusions and Outlook. Oxygenation of the dredged sediment is improved as a result of the natural ripening processes: the air- filled porosity increases, the aggregate size decreases, and the initially high respiration rates caused by chemical and biological ripening decreases. Therefore, conditions in the disposal site become more favorable for aerobic biodegradation of organic pollutants like Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons (PAH) and mineral oil. It is concluded that the naturally occuring process of ripening can be used as a bioremediation technique. Ripening in an upland disposal site is an off-site technique, and therefore, the process could be enhanced by means of technological interference. However, it is concluded that the knowledge currently available about upland disposal is not sufficient to distinguish critical process steps during the ripening and bioremediation of PAH and mineral oil polluted sediments because of the complex relationships between the different ripening processes and bioremediatio...|$|E
40|$|Environmental {{applications}} of nanoparticles (NP) increasingly result in widespread NP distribution within porous media {{where they are}} subject to various concurrent transport mechanisms including irreversible deposition, attachment/detachment (equilibrium or kinetic), agglomeration, <b>physical</b> straining, site-blocking, <b>ripening,</b> and size exclusion. Fundamental research in NP transport is typically conducted at small scale, and theoretical mechanistic modeling of particle transport in porous media faces challenges when considering the simultaneous effects of transport mechanisms. Continuum modeling approaches, in contrast, are scalable across various scales ranging from column experiments to aquifer. They have also been able to successfully describe the simultaneous occurrence of various transport mechanisms of NP in porous media such as blocking/straining or agglomeration/deposition/detachment. However, the diversity of model equations developed by different authors and the lack of effective approaches for their validation present obstacles to the successful robust application of these models for describing or predicting NP transport phenomena. This review aims to describe consistently all the important NP transport mechanisms along with their representative mathematical continuum models as found in the current scientific literature. Detailed characterizations of each transport phenomenon in regards to their manifestation in the column experiment outcomes, i. e., breakthrough curve (BTC) and residual concentration profile (RCP), are presented to facilitate future interpretations of BTCs and RCPs. The review highlights two NP transport mechanisms, agglomeration and size exclusion, which are potentially of great importance in controlling the fate and transport of NP in the subsurface media yet have been widely neglected in many existing modeling studies. A critical limitation of the continuum modeling approach is the number of parameters used upon application to larger scales and when a series of transport mechanisms are involved. We investigate the use of simplifying assumptions, such as the equilibrium assumption, in modeling the attachment/detachment mechanisms within a continuum modelling framework. While acknowledging criticisms about the use of this assumption for NP deposition on a mechanistic (process) basis, we found that its use as a description of dynamic deposition behavior in a continuum model yields broadly similar results to those arising from a kinetic model. Furthermore, we show that in two dimensional (2 -D) continuum models the modeling efficiency based on the Akaike information criterion (AIC) is enhanced for equilibrium vs kinetic with no significant reduction in model performance. This is because fewer parameters are needed for the equilibrium model compared to the kinetic model. Two major transport regimes are identified in the transport of NP within porous media. The first regime is characterized by higher particle-surface attachment affinity than particle-particle attachment affinity, and operative transport mechanisms of physicochemical filtration, blocking, and physical retention. The second regime is characterized by the domination of particle-particle attachment tendency over particle-surface affinity. In this regime although physicochemical filtration as well as straining may still be operative, ripening is predominant together with agglomeration and further subsequent retention. In both regimes careful assessment of NP fate and transport is necessary since certain combinations of concurrent transport phenomena leading to large migration distances are possible in either case...|$|R
