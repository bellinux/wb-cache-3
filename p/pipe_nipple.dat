The {{advantage}} of the street elbow {{is that it can}} be connected directly to another fitting without having to use an additional short connecting piece called a <b>pipe</b> <b>nipple.</b>|$|E
50|$|The {{simplest}} form {{of steam}} trap is a disc or short solid <b>pipe</b> <b>nipple</b> {{with a small}} hole drilled through it installed at the lowest point of the equipment. Since steam condensate will collect at the lowest point and live steam is about 1200 times greater in volume than this hot liquid, condensate is effectively removed and steam is blocked. However, {{the vast majority of}} steam traps in current operation are of the mechanical or thermostatically operated design.|$|E
40|$|The paper {{presents}} {{the analysis of}} the behavior of the drill <b>pipe</b> <b>nipple</b> connection under the additional load generated by power pulses. The strain wave propagation through the nipple thread connection of drill pipes to the bottomhole is studied in this paper. The improved design of the nipple thread connection is suggested using the obtained experimental and theoretical data. The suggested connection design allows not only the efficient transmission of strain wave energy to a drill bit but also the automation of making-up and breaking-out drill pipes...|$|E

40|$|Improvised {{explosive}} devices (IEDs) {{continue to be}} a national threat to the safety and security of the public. Research in explosives analysis for intact and post-blast samples {{continue to be a}} topic in which practitioners are constantly improving and searching for faster methods and techniques to analyze these sample types. The key role crime laboratories play in analyzing these sample types can have limitations, such as increasing turnaround times and backlogs. This concern additionally plays a role in the safety of the public if an unknown individual has not been discovered. Current analytical instrumentation in which explosives are analyzed includes Gas Chromatography – Mass Spectrometry (GC-MS), Liquid Chromatography – Mass Spectrometry (LC-MS), and Ion Mobility Spectrometry (IMS). Each instrument has benefits in the analytical results obtained. Direct Analysis in Real Time - Mass Spectrometry (DART-MS) has shown a significant promise as an analytical approach that can help remedy the time an explosive sample is analyzed, while additionally providing discriminating analytical results. Previous research has shown that DART-MS is capable of analyzing explosives, including smokeless powder. A limitation currently in the area of smokeless powder analysis with DART-MS is the application of utilizing this method and technology to realistic casework that may be encountered in forensic laboratories. Intact and post-blast explosive samples encountered in forensic laboratories arrive in various states and conditions. For example, the severity of the blast and environmental factors {{may play a role in}} the detection of smokeless powder on these sample types. To provide objective information and additional research, studies were conducted with mixture samples of smokeless powder and potential matrices that may be encountered in real world case samples. Faster processing time, in addition to the discrimination of smokeless powder, was the ultimate goal of this research. Due to the complexity of the mass spectra that may be generated from sample mixtures, an extraction technique coupled with DART-MS was investigated. A liquid-liquid extraction (LLE) method and dynamic headspace concentration using Carbopack™ X coated wire mesh were tested for the effectiveness of separating the analytes of interest of smokeless powder from various matrix interferences. Hodgdon Hornady LEVERevolution (HHL) smokeless powder, Pennzoil 10 W- 40 (P 10 W 40) motor oil, and residue from metal end caps (China SLK brand) and black steel <b>pipe</b> <b>nipples</b> (Schedule 40) were used during the course of the matrix interference study. The method of applying dynamic headspace concentration using Carbopack™ X coated wire mesh and analysis by DART-MS provides an effective alternative to obtaining mass spectral data in a shorter amount of time, compared to techniques currently used in forensic laboratories. Effective separation was not achieved using the various LLE methods tested. Further testing would be required in order to evaluate the feasibility of implementing the technique as a sample preparation approach prior to analysis by DART-MS...|$|R
40|$|Piping {{systems are}} one of the most {{reliable}} and safest means of transfer of matter and energy. The length of the piping system can archieve hundreds of kilometers and belong the piping system can occur mechanism failure modes including cracking, lage deformation, buckling, fracture, local damage, corrosion and clogging of piping systems. Piping system has a lot of connector along its connection. For example equal elbow, T-Joint, <b>Pipe</b> <b>nipple</b> and Pipe Offset. The connectors has their own problem and that problems can cause accident. So,it is important for engineer to design the systems safely in order to prevent accident. So, it is a responsibility for engineers to make researches in other to improve the piping syste...|$|E
40|$|Shock {{tubes are}} {{commonly}} employed to test candidate armor materials, validate numerical models, and conduct simulated blast experiments in animal models. As DoD interests desire to field wearable sensors as blast dosimeters, shock tubes may also serve for calibration {{and testing of}} these devices. The high blast pressures needed for experimental testing of candidate armors are unnecessary to test these sensors. An inexpensive, efficient, and easily available way of testing these pressure sensors is desirable. It is known that releasing compressed gas suddenly can create a repeatable shock front, and the pressures can be finely tuned by changing the pressure to which the gas is compressed. A Crosman 0. 177 caliber air pistol was used (without loading any pellets) to compress and release air in {{one end of a}} 24 inch long 3 / 4 inch diameter standard <b>pipe</b> <b>nipple</b> to simulate a blast wave {{at the other end of}} the tube. A variable number of pumps were used to vary the peak blast pressure. As expected, the trials where 10 pumps were used to compress the air resulted in the largest average peak pressure of 101. 99 kPa (+/- 2. 63 kPa). The design with 7 pumps had the second biggest peak pressure, with an average peak pressure of 89. 11 kPa (+/- 1. 77 kPa). The design with 5 pumps had the third largest peak pressure, with an average peak pressure of 78. 80 kPa (+/- 1. 74 kPa). 3 pumps produced an average peak pressure of 61. 37 kPa (+/- 2. 20 kPa). 2 pumps produced an average peak pressure of 48. 11 kPa (+/- 1. 57 kPa). The design with just 1 pump had the smallest peak pressure and produced an average peak pressure of 30. 13 kPa (+/- 0. 79 kPa). This inexpensive shock tube design had a shot-to-shot cycle time of between 30 and 45 seconds. Comment: Five pages, three figure...|$|E
