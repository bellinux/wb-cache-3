40|$|AbstractIn {{the course}} of {{completion}} of an ultra-deep well newly drilled in the Yuanba Gasfield, Sichuan Basin, long-section and large-scale deformation occurred in the heavy casing section and nickel base alloy casing section of the sealing Triassic limestone interval, so a new hole had to be sidetracked, which impels us to rediscover the applicability of conventional drilling and completion technology in ultra-deep wells. In this paper, based on the borehole condition and field operation data of this well, the borehole pressure field variation initiated by lost circulation in the low-pressure formation was analyzed {{from the perspective of}} dynamics, then, the variation pattern of differential pressure inside and outside the well bore at different time intervals was depicted, and the primary cause of such complication was theoretically revealed, i. e., the pressure wave generated by instant lost circulation in low-pressure formation would result in redistribution of pressure inside the downhole confined space, and then the crush of casing in the vicinity of local low-pressure areas. Pertinent proposals for avoiding these kinds of engineering complexities were put forward: ① when downhole sealing casing operation is conducted in open hole completion, liner completion or <b>perforated</b> <b>hole,</b> the potential damage of lost circulation to casing should be considered; ② the downhole sealing point and sealing mode should be selected cautiously: the sealing point had better be selected in the section with good cementing quality or as close to the casing shoe as possible, and the sealing mode can be either cement plug or mechanical bridge plug.

40|$|The extrusion-coated {{paperboard}} tray packaging {{which contains}} a tray container {{and a piece}} of lidding film is widely used along with MAP technology in fresh food packaging industry. Much research has been done on perforation onto lidding film. This research is based on the attempt of perforating on the tray materials : uncoated paperboard and paperboard coated with PE polymer or PET polymer. The study was an approach to the perforations on the paperboard and how to design its patterns. The study focused on to which degree does the perforation influences the strength of the paperboard materials. The diameter and the shape of perforations were observed. The GTR and WVTR of the materials were tested. From the comparison of 25 patterns, it is inferred that the better tensile strength could be achieved when the micro-holes placed with more distance and more uniformly. The less perforation done on horizontal direction of the sample, the better tensile properties it gains. The less destructing rows made on the samples, the better tensile strength the sample gets. More even and straight fraction surfaces appeared in MD samples, while CD samples also have slant and more layered fraction surfaces. Tensile strength in MD is close to two times higher than CD samples. These results are caused by the orientation of the fibers. The appearance differences between micro-holes of the three materials are quite obvious. For manual made <b>perforated</b> <b>hole,</b> the surface is not smooth enough. For laser made perforation, the paperboard got discoloration due to laser, perforation on uncoated board is more flat, outstanding ring circles appeared on PET and PE boards, and a few bubbles could be seen around the ring circle of PET coated board. The perforation could increase the WVTR of three kinds of boards effectively. The design of patterns and the observation of perforations could give the theoretical reference for manufactures or engineers who wants to apply the laser perforation on composite paperboard...|$|E

Their in-depth analyses {{are essential for}} the development of advanced noise control solutions. In this thesis, a package of efficient numerical modeling tools is developed based on the sub-structuring approach, {{in order to deal with}} complex structural-acoustical couplings among various subsystem components in a wide range of applications. A Compound Interface-Patch Transfer Function (CI-PTF) approach is proposed, highlighting its ability in handling mixed separations, such as those composed of rigid or flexible structures and apertures. Typical structural and acoustical subsystems are characterized as a few versatile subsystem modules, serving as the building blocks for constructing complex system configurations. The convergence, accuracy, and efficiency of the developed numerical tools are thoroughly validated. As an important non-fibrous sound absorbing material, micro-perforated panels (MPPs) and their in-situ sound absorption in coupled vibroacoustic systems are investigated. The MPP is modeled as an integral component of the system using the proposed CI-PTF approach. Numerical studies show that the actual sound absorption performance of the MPPs strongly depends on the surrounding environment, which unequivocally demonstrates that MPP cannot be simply considered as a locally reactive element in a complex vibroacoustic environment. For sound transmission control inside a duct, acoustic silencers are considered whose modeling is systematically tackled by the proposed numerical tools. Reactive silencers with rigid internal partitions are studied for their parametric influences and noise attenuation mechanisms. With the introduction of MPPs as dissipative elements, a unit cell treatment is proposed to model the complex side-branch configuration, and investigations reveal the hybrid attenuation mechanism of such device, which combines the reflection and absorption effects. Benefiting from the modular nature of the sub-structuring approach, the size of the <b>perforated</b> <b>hole</b> and the perforation ratio can be optimized to strike a balance between the dissipative and reactive effect, for ultimately achieving a desired Transmission Loss (TL) within a prescribed frequency range. The calculation accuracy for both reactive and hybrid MPP silencers using the proposed approach have been confirmed with finite element method (FEM) simulations and experiments. For the tuning and optimization of a silencer, the broadband TL performance realized by a number of cascade-connected sub-chambers is investigated. A theoretical basis for the description of the overall system TL is presented. The characteristics of the sub-chambers, along with the understandings of influences of the parameters, provide guidelines for their optimizations, and a desired broadband performance is achieved by connecting sub-chambers with optimized TLs to tackle different frequency regions. Based on the sub-chamber strategy, a multi-level approach for the design, analysis and optimization of acoustic silencers with cascaded sub-chambers is proposed. Through numerical case studies and a retrofitted design of a mining truck muffler, the effectiveness of the proposed methodology is demonstrated, which greatly reduces the design variables and computational costs compared with global design and optimization.

40|$|In today 2 ̆ 7 s {{computer}} paper printing, {{cross and}} edge perforations are done only by mechanical perforators. The mechanical perforation process works fine since {{the width of}} the bridges and the length of the <b>holes</b> to be <b>perforated</b> remain large. Concerned with improvements in quality, printers have introduced microperforations. The holes and bridges of the perforation pattern are so small that after the user has torn off the sheet of computer paper along the perforation pattern, the edges of the document are very smooth and clean. Unfortunately, microperforations are reaching the limits of what can be achieved by the mechanical perforators. Because of the physical contact between the perforating tool and the paper, the perforation pattern is damaged. The tensile strength of the microperforation pattern decreases significantly and the paper often jams in the computer printers. Mechanical perforator dies wear and may even break. Therefore, <b>holes</b> are incompletely <b>perforated</b> or missing, so that the document is likely to be damaged when it is torn off along the perforation pattern by the user. Incomplete or missing perforations increases the tensile strength of the perforation pattern. Therefore, the printer can increase the quality of a perforation pattern by reducing its variability in tensile strength. This thesis studies the perforation of computer paper by laser beam. It is demonstrated through a microscopic study that laser perforations are free of all the defects which are inherent to the mechanical perforation process. It has been found that laser <b>perforated</b> <b>holes</b> remain open while mechanically <b>perforated</b> <b>holes</b> close back just after being perforated. The tests which have been carried out show that using a laser instead of a mechanical perforator to do microperforations reduces the variability in the tensile strength from 0. 694 kilograms to 0. 0751 kilograms. This improvement is significant. However, using a laser instead of a mechanical perforator to do large-size perforations reduces the variability in tensile strength only from 0. 0421 kilograms to 0. 0338 kilograms. This improvement is not significant. A mathematical model expressing the relationship between the tensile strength of a perforation pattern, {{the width of the}} bridges, and the number of bridges per inch has been established. The correlation found between the model and the experimental values is high (r = 0. 98). This mathematical model is a simple method which allows the printer to adjust the tensile strength of a laser perforation pattern to the desired value. This model requires only simple calculations, and the knowledge of one basic characteristic - the tensile strength of the paper. As a conclusion, the laser beam is a very valuable tool which can achieve very high quality microperforations on computer paper. However, it seems not worth using a laser to do large-size perforations on computer paper since the decrease in tensile strength variability over the mechanical perforation process is not significant. The fact that laser <b>perforated</b> <b>holes</b> remain wide open could improve high speed folding and piling in the press deliveries by allowing the air trapped between the sheets of computer paper to escape through the <b>perforated</b> <b>holes.</b> This property has also already found an interesting application for cigarette filter paper...|$|R
