5000|$|In January 2014, Machinima was {{alleged to}} be paying its YouTube video {{partners}} for showing Xbox One content. According to reports, the content {{must be at least}} 30 seconds long and the Xbox One must be mentioned by name. An accompanying legal agreement also states that the partner [...] "may not say anything negative or disparaging about Machinima, Xbox One, or any of its games". Additionally, the agreement states that the video producer must keep the details of the promotional agreement confidential, or they do not qualify for the <b>promotional</b> <b>payment.</b> Videos participating in this promotion tag their videos with the tag: XB1M13. Microsoft claims that it had no knowledge of the promotion.|$|E
50|$|Another {{issue is}} the lack of {{interest}} of the SAGPyA (Secretaria de Agricultura, Ganaderia, Pesca y Alimentacion) to promote the forestry industry. Even though there is a law implemented for the promotion of the forestry sector, it is not a priority for the government. In many cases, economic support for cultivation projects has been delayed. For instance, it is not clear if Law 25,008 will be extended in the year 2009 or if it will be modified. In 2006, the Argentine Forestry Association-Mesopotamia (Afome) complained to the Ministry of Economy about how SAGPyA has managed the Law 25,008. Afome blames SAGPyA for not reaching cultivation goals established in 1999 due to delayed <b>promotional</b> <b>payments.</b>|$|R
50|$|Stenmark was {{not allowed}} to {{participate}} in the 1984 Winter Olympics in Sarajevo by the International Ski Federation (FIS) for accepting <b>promotional</b> <b>payments</b> directly, rather than through the national ski federation. Hanni Wenzel of Liechtenstein was also banned; both were double gold medalists in 1980. Marc Girardelli, who was the best slalom racer during the 1983-84 season, wasn't allowed to participate either. In his case it was because he didn't have citizenship in Luxembourg, the country for which he competed. Stenmark was allowed back into the Olympic competition in 1988, but was past his prime and did not medal (however, he had the fastest second run of the slalom competition). He retired from World Cup competition {{at the end of the}} 1989 season in March, days before his 33rd birthday.|$|R
