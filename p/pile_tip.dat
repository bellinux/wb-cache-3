40|$|The Cone Penetration Test (CPT) is {{used for}} many decades in order to {{evaluate}} the pile bearing capacity. Pieter Barentsen developed the CPT around 1930 in order to investigate the soil resistance. However, Boonstra was the first, in 1940, to used the cone resistance of the CPT as the unit pile bearing capacity. From this moment, the CPT became very important {{in the evaluation of}} the pile bearing capacity. An overview is given about the most common pile design methods, which are based on the in-situ Cone Penetration Test (CPT). This overview will start with the evolution of the CPT, followed by a brief presentation of the methods in use. An important part, in pile design methods, is the averaging procedure of the cone resistance over an influence zone around the <b>pile</b> <b>tip.</b> Since the <b>pile</b> <b>tip</b> is much wider than the tip of the CPT cone, the influence zone of the pile is also much larger, therefore the cone resistance has to be averaged over the influence zone around the <b>pile</b> <b>tip.</b> Unfortunately, the definition of this zone is different for each method in use. Finally, several methods for the <b>pile</b> <b>tip</b> bearing capacity near the interface of a soil layer will be discussed, including related methods from De Beer [1] and White & Bolton [2]...|$|E
40|$|An {{attempt is}} made to {{establish}} an analytically based estimate of the influence zone surrounding {{the tip of a}} loaded pile in sand. In the framework of the cavity expansion theory and a confined local failure mechanism, explicit expressions are derived in which the sizes of the upward and downward influence zones are properly linked with the angle of shearing resistance, the stiffness, the volumetric strain, and the mean effective stress of the sand at the <b>pile</b> <b>tip.</b> Based on a series of parametric analyses, the mean range of the influence zone is suggested. For piles in clean sand, the influence zone above the <b>pile</b> <b>tip</b> is between 1. 5 and 2. 5 D and the zone below the tip ranges from 3. 5 to 5. 5 D, where D is pile diameter. For piles in more compressible silty sand, the influence zone extends between 0. 5 and 1. 5 D above the <b>pile</b> <b>tip</b> and between 1. 5 and 3 D below the tip.

40|$|TheNetherlands is a densely {{populated}} country and {{is located in}} an areawhere the shallowsubsurfacemainly consists ofHolocene and Pleistocene soils. To build permanent structures, enough bearing capacity is needed to provide sufficient support for these structures. However, Holocene (soft) soils typically do not provide sufficient support. In {{the western part of}} the country, the soft soils from the Holocene overlay the stiffer Pleistocene soils. To still be able to construct at locations where soft soils are found, pile foundations are needed to transfer the loads through the soft soil onto the stiff soil in order to provide for sufficient bearing capacity. The normativemethod for determining pile bearing capacity in the Netherlands uses a relatively straightforward semi-empirical approach known as the 4 D/ 8 D or the Dutch method. This method was based on the work of [vanMierlo and Koppejan, 1952] who introduce the logarithmic spiral theory. Apart from small modifications and elaborations, the method has been used ever since. To get to a reasoned solution on how to calculate and design pile foundations the Eurocode [Normcommissie 351 006 ’Geotechniek’, 2017 a] was introduced. One of the (original) aims of the Eurocode was to harmonise rules and regulations regarding, amongst others, pile foundations. To prepare this harmonisation, Belgium, France and the Netherlands took a closer look into their calculation methods. For the Netherlands this research was performed by a committee who presented their findings in CUR 229 - “Axiaal belaste palen” [CUR B&I, 2010]. From CUR 229 it was found the <b>pile</b> <b>tip</b> capacity was overestimated. In other words, the calculated <b>pile</b> <b>tip</b> capacity was higher than the measured <b>pile</b> <b>tip</b> capacity. This overestimation led to a reduction of ®p of 30 % starting on the 1 st of January 2017. (®p is the factor which reduces the <b>pile</b> <b>tip</b> resistance for different pile types, see Appendix A.) A point of interest is the overestimation of the <b>pile</b> <b>tip</b> capacity, which seems to become more prominent when the pile goes deeper into a non-cohesive soil. It was even found, a lower ®p is not required for piles installed less than 8 D into the bearing layer. The reduction of ®p seems to contradict with practice, because no cases of damage are known regarding the bearing capacity of pile foundations. Several explanations for this might be valid. For example, hidden safeties may prevent overall safety issues to arise. In addition, errors may occur in the determination of the pile capacity from pile load tests or in the Dutch method for calculating <b>pile</b> <b>tip</b> capacity. This leads to the two main subjects for this thesis. On the one hand, the hidden mechanism of residual loads is considered and on the other hand, the zone of influence at the <b>pile</b> <b>tip</b> during failure is analysed. To analyse the above-named subjects, the 4 D/ 8 D method was put under scrutiny. First, it was compared to other (international) analytical methods, which determine the bearing capacity directly from CPT data. Furthermore, the zone of influence around the <b>pile</b> <b>tip</b> is considered inmore detail by analysing the analytical approach and comparing this to the results of numerical models. This led to the conclusion that the observed overestimation can partly be explained by the inaccuracy of the assumed zone of influence around the <b>pile</b> <b>tip,</b> especially regarding the extent of this zone above the <b>pile</b> <b>tip</b> (8 D). As this extent is too large, the 4 D/ 8 D method results in a too low average cone resistance in the 8 D zone (for piles installed less than 8 D into the bearing soil layer). In combination with the ‘old’ ®p, this leads to a reasonably accurate estimation of the <b>pile</b> <b>tip</b> capacity compared to the measured tip capacity. However, the observed extent of the zone of influence above the <b>pile</b> <b>tip,</b> in the FEMmodels, is in the order of 1 to 1. 5 D. The average cone resistance in this zone will in most cases be higher than in a zone extending 8 D above the <b>pile</b> <b>tip.</b> The hidden mechanism of residual loads is implemented in a numerical model, with the use of a static load on top of the pile. The residual loads are caused by the installation of the pile and so, they are considered to be installation effects. No analytical or numerical models or procedures were found in literature to quantify the xiii xiv 0. Abstract residual load. Residual loads were implemented using a procedure defined in this thesis, taking into account the maximum <b>pile</b> <b>tip</b> capacity as indicator for the order of magnitude for the residual load. This is done, because a drawback of FEM models is; they are not able to calculate large strains, which occur during installation of a pile. Therefore the installations effects (like residual loads) have to be implemented indirectly. The horizontal compression due to installation is modelled as an installation effect according to the procedure of [Broere and van Tol, 2006]. Both installation effects are validated using data from CUR 229 and they are subjected to a sensitivity analysis. Furthermore, the softening or peak behaviour of soils might have a significant influence on the zone of influence around the pile and on the residual loads, as for both cases, the soil is loaded up to failure. Most regular constitutive models do not take into account this behaviour. Due to the fact the Hypo Plasticity (HP) model takes into account this peak behaviour, it was used to performthe FEM analysis. During the final stages of this thesis, scaled pile load tests were performed. The results of these tests were analysed to find the presence and order of magnitude of the residual load in a pile. However, as the test results were incomplete, only first assumptions were made that indicated the presence of residual loads. No substantiated conclusion could be drawn regarding the magnitude. Due to the observed importance of residual loads in this thesis, the residual loads should be measured during load tests more extensively using Osterberg cells or fibre optics. The installation effects are modelled in the Hypo Plasticity model with reasonable confidence, but future research is needed on models that can model the installation process (for example theMaterial PointMethod). Furthermore, the small strain parameters of the HP model should be taken into account. This thesis questions the 4 D/ 8 D method and shows some of its inaccuracies. However, more extensive research should be done considering the extent of the zone of influence and the limiting value defined by in the Dutchmethod. Also, the interaction between the shaft and the <b>pile</b> <b>tip</b> resistance has to be evaluated, as this thesis indicates they interfere with each other if the Dutch method is considered. Besides the zone of influence and the residual loads, the failure criterion stated by NEN 9997 - 1 is questioned. Failure of a pile happens when the <b>pile</b> <b>tip</b> has moved 10 %D [Normcommissie 351 006 ’Geotechniek’, 2017 a], but the FEM models show more displacements at failure, where failure is defined by themoment the models cannot stabilise anymore and therefore fail to calculate for a certain load step.

40|$|The central {{pillars of}} a bridge {{belonging}} to a recently built high-speed railway line experienced an unexpected and continuous heave {{after the end of}} construction. Pillars were founded on 3 × 3 pile groups capped by a rigid slab. The <b>tips</b> of <b>piles</b> supporting the central pillars reached a hard Tertiary anhydritic claystone. Deep extensometers allowed the identification of an active layer, 12 – 15 m thick, located below the <b>pile</b> <b>tips.</b> Observations in recovered cores suggest that the heave is induced by the growth of gypsum crystals in discontinuities of the anhydritic claystone. No heave was observed in gypsum-rich claystones located above the anhydritic layer. Gypsum crystal growth is associated with dissolution of anhydrite and subsequent precipitation from a super-saturated aqueous solution. Boreholes and pile construction allowed a hydraulic connection of upper aquifers and the lower anhydritic formation. This hypothesis explains the role of the bridge construction in the triggering of a dormant heave phenomenon. The heave rate has been reduced to a small value by the weight added by an embankment 33 m high, which partially fills the original valley. Postprint (published version...|$|R

40|$|In {{recent years}} jacked steel H-piles have been {{introduced}} into Hong Kong {{as an alternative to}} driven piles. In Hong Kong practice, termination of pile driving is often based on dynamic formula and <b>pile</b> <b>tips</b> are normally embedded in a stratum with SPT-N values exceeding 200. On the other hand, installation of jacked piles ceases when the rate of penetration is less than some prescribed termination criterion and jacked piles are normally embedded in layers with SPT-N values of less than 160. As such bearing stratum is less stiff, the load transfer mechanism and capacity of jacked piles could be very different from driven piles and experience from the latter may not be directly applicable. To investigate the behaviour of such piles, a comprehensive study was conducted. In the study, six piles were instrumented with strain gauges and load tested to failure so allowing their load transfer mechanism to be studied. During installation the development of pore pressure around three of the test piles was monitored by electronic piezometers. Different criteria were adopted for determining the termination of jacking. It was found that the test piles passed the same acceptance criteria specified in the building code for driven piles. Shaft friction in the test piles contributed to over 80 % of the piles' ultimate capacity. The pore pressure was found to dissipate quickly after jacked pile installation. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R

40|$|The {{development}} of Negative skin friction (NSF) {{is regarded as}} a common problem in the design and construction of pile foundations in consolidating ground. Several authors have reported failure of pile foundations related to pile settlement (downdrag). To date most of the current design approaches consider mainly on ultimate limit state (dragload) and overestimate the effect of NSF on pile behaviour. With an aim to clarify aspects of pile behaviour subjected to NSF, four centrifuge tests have been conducted. The research includes investigations of NSF developed on single piles with different <b>pile</b> <b>tip</b> location with respect to the bearing layer as well as changes of dragload and downdrag of the centre pile inside the 3 x 3 pile group under the application of axial load. Moreover, shielding effects on dragload and downdrag in 3 x 3 pile groups at 2. 5 D and 3. 0 D spacing are investigated. The observed pile behaviour is to be compared with relevant previous studies and numerical back analysis. Combined with the findings from this study and other reported test results in literature, it suggests that the smaller of the distance of <b>pile</b> <b>tip</b> from the bearing stratum, the more significant the effect from the bearing stratum on the {{development of}} dragload and the larger the magnitude of dragload and vice versa. In contrast to the variation of dragload with <b>pile</b> <b>tip</b> location, the magnitude of downdrag with <b>pile</b> <b>tip</b> located at 0. 5 D away from the bearing stratum is about twelve times as large as the one with <b>pile</b> <b>tip</b> rest on bearing stratum. Regarding the combined effect of applied axial load and dragload on a pile where its <b>pile</b> <b>tip</b> is located at 0. 25 D from the bearing stratum, dragload developed on the centre pile is completely eliminated for the cases where pile spacing equal to 2. 5 D and 3 D when axial loads of 150 % and 175 % of the maximum dragload developed prior to the application of axial load (Pmax) is applied. The values of required axial load are comparatively close with published test result of floating pile but are about halve the value of end-bearing pile. (i. e., 3 Pmax). For the two 3 x 3 pile groups at 2. 5 D and 3. 0 D, the maximum dragload of the centre pile is 53 % and 36 % of the maximum dragload of the single isolated pile respectively. At the same time, the shielding effects on downdrag of the centre pile is about 40 % and 19 % of a single isolated pile in the case where the pile spacing equal to 2. 5 D and 3. 0 D respectively. Shielding effect on downdrag is smaller than shielding effect on dragload regardless of pile spacing and shielding effect on downdrag is largest for the centre pile as compared with other piles inside the group and the isolated pile...|$|E

And the additional settlements of the adjacent piles arising from the settlement of the loaded pile were obtained as well. Thus a simplified formula of interaction coefficients between any two piles was presented. Meanwhile, the equivalent shear stiffness coefficients of soil around each pile were developed; and an equation of displacements caused by load on top of the analyzing pile imbedded in multi-layered soils was built; so recurrence relations of settlement and axial force of pile shaft between upper and lower of each pile sections were respectively deduced; in the process of deduction, Boussinesq solution was modified to include the effect of different embedded depths, and then used to derive the equivalent stiffness coefficients of the soil under the <b>pile</b> <b>tips.</b> Lastly, the formula was extended to the settlements calculation of high and low cap pile groups.

All tests with the exception of Case 1 of the 4 x 4 group had their <b>pile</b> <b>tips</b> located at the same elevation. A special device, which was capable of both driving the piles and raining sand on the group in flight, had to be constructed to perform the tests without stopping the centrifuge (spinning at 45 g).

Determination of the influence of load transfer from the pile group to the surrounding soil and the mechanism of this transfer with increasing the load increment on the tip and pile shaft for the soil in saturated and unsaturated state (when there is a negative pore water pressure). Different basic properties are used that is (S = 90 %, γd = 15 kN / m 3, S = 90 %, γd = 17 kN / m 3 and S = 60 %, γd = 15 kN / m 3).

This study is intended to shed some light on the undrained behavior of ACIP embedded in stratified soil and to explore a methodology to predict the ultimate pile loads. The study is based on practical measurements of load–displacement relationships of 51 static loading tests of full-scale ACIP installed through multilayered soil profiles. The study revealed that the normalized load–displacement relationships of the tested piles have deterministic range with upper and lower bounds. Equations for these bounds and the mean load–displacement relationship are developed in this study. There is a deficiency in the literature concerning the calculations of ultimate loads for piles embedded in multilayered soil. Therefore, this paper presents an attempt to estimate the ultimate pile load in undrained conditions utilizing two approaches. The first approach assumed the failure pattern of the soil beneath the pile base to be punching into the sand followed by general shear failure in clay underneath. The end-bearing resistance at the <b>pile</b> <b>tip</b> was estimated by implementing Meyerhof and Hanna’s [24] shallow foundation procedure.

40|$|In this paper, an {{approach}} is formulated for analysing a pile embedded in soil {{in terms of}} the combined action of axial load and lateral shear with the inclusion of the "P-δ effect" by solving the fundamental differential equation governing the behaviour of an elastic strut supported by elastic springs by the finite difference method. As noted during the formulation of the approach, the lateral deflection and subsequently the internal force in the pile (the elastic strut) are controlled by the applied lateral shear at the pile head only under constant axial load. This phenomenon enables parametric studies to be conducted for piles so as to arrive at charts for quick determination of the lateral deflections and moments for <b>pile</b> heads and <b>tips</b> under different restraints. The approach is then used to analyse piled foundations against horizontal shears with the inclusion of the P-δ effect for piles being hinged and rigidly jointed {{on the underside of the}} pile caps with demonstration through the use of worked examples.

Finally, the applications of the approaches for non-linear soil response, together with the tracing of load-displacement relation, are discussed.

40|$|This paper {{reviews the}} {{behavior}} of three types of piles (bored, CFA and Omega piles), installed in the experimental site of Unicamp (State University of Campinas). Unicamp subsoil is characterized by non-saturated diabasic soil, lateritic in its surface layer. Extensive data from geotechnical investigation is presented, expressed in parameters derived both from in situ and laboratory tests. Static load tests with electrical extensometers were performed along the depth of instrumented piles. It was observed {{that most of the}} loads applied were transferred by lateral friction. An analysis of load transfer functions was made, which displayed a very good definition of both shaft friction and tip interaction, namely the ultimate resistance. The average maximum unit shaft friction resistance of the piles was 41 kPa, 58 kPa and 86 kPa for bored, CFA and Omega <b>piles,</b> respectively. Maximum <b>tip</b> reaction was 87 kPa, 491 kPa and 1665 kPa, for bored, CFA and Omega piles, respectively. This paper also emphasizes the relevance of extracting each pile after completion of the test in order to inspect the pile facies and characteristics. This enabled checking the shape of tips and size of shafts. Part 2 of this paper will review the tests performed at the Experimental Field of FEUP (Faculty of Engineering of the University of Porto/Portugal) ...|$|R
40|$|At the National Geotechnical Experimentation Site (NGES) on the University of Massachusetts Amherst Campus, 44 pipe piles with diameters in {{the range}} of 60 to 168 mm and lengths of 1. 5 to 10. 7 m, were {{installed}} and load tested. The majority of piles were installed in a moderately plastic, varved clay crust with overconsolidation ratios {{in the range}} of 4 to 9. Open-ended and closed-ended (60 ∘ apex cone) piles were installed by driving and jacking. An extensive program of laboratory and in situ soil testing was also completed. ^ Axial compressive load tests to failure were conducted at a predetermined time after installation and some piles were subjected to repeat load tests. Additionally, load tests were conducted on <b>pile</b> cone <b>tips,</b> independent of the pile shaft. Average unit skin friction was backcalculated from the interpreted pile failure load and estimated values of end-bearing. ^ The investigation revealed that: (1) pile driving resulted in more intrusion of soil into the pile (less plugging), as compared to pile jacking; (2) plugging was a function of pile diameter and soil characteristics; (3) jacking resulted in higher skin friction capacity than driving; (4) skin friction capacity of piles depended on the degree of plugging; (5) pile skin friction capacity appeared to be a function of the lateral reconsolidation effective stress; (6) the operative lateral effective stress acting on the piles at failure appeared to vary over wide limits between values close to the at rest earth pressure (K o) and the reconsolidation lateral earth pressure K o), estimated from in situ test results; (7) the operative coefficient of friction at the soil-pile interface at failure was best estimated from the results of interface direct shear tests using remolded soil; and (8) repeat load tests on piles resulted in successively higher failure loads until the third load test, after which the capacity dropped slightly. The mechanism responsible appeared to be an increase in end-bearing. ^ A new effective stress analysis for pile skin friction was proposed. The analysis allows for consideration of the installation method, degree of plugging during open-ended penetration and the estimated lateral stress conditions around displacement piles installed in overconsolidated clay. ...|$|R
40|$|Static {{formulas}} {{based on}} limit equilibrium theories often provide misleading predictions of pile capacity in cohesionless soils. Researchers {{have been working}} within {{the last few years}} to improve empirical prediction methods. However, even the most recent methods neglect one or more of four factors; namely: residual stresses due to pile driving, actual soil parameters prior to failure, mean normal stress levels, and stress history. ^ Available indirect methods used for residual stress measurement are not accurate. Furthermore, no accurate method for their prediction, except the wave equation, is available. Therefore, in this dissertation a new method that takes into account all related parameters for residual stress prediction was developed. It was shown that the existence of these stresses is the principal reason for observing limit values of <b>pile</b> <b>tip</b> and shaft capacities. ^ Due to high stress levels beneath the <b>pile</b> <b>tip</b> prior to failure, the initial angle of shearing resistance may be substantially reduced. This may result in serious overestimation of the <b>pile</b> <b>tip</b> capacity, especially in dense sands, if the initial angle were used. In this research, a procedure was developed to account for this behavior. ^ For many of the available methods, the vertical overburden pressure was used for predicting pile capacity. However, this capacity is actually affected by the mean normal stress. Correlations in terms of this stress are proven to be superior to those produced when the overburden pressure was used. ^ Stress history was found to have a major effect on pile capacity in both reducing soil compressibility and increasing lateral pressure on the pile shaft, and hence increasing the pile capacity. These effects have not been taken into account in available prediction methods. ^ In this research, available load test data were properly adjusted for residual stresses, and were then used to develop a new empirical prediction method for driven piles in cohesionless soils. The new method takes into account parameters at failure, mean normal stress, and stress history. This method was indicated to be superior to other available methods by comparison with actual measurements. ...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{describes}} a bearing capacity formula for {{steel pipe pile}} with four helical wings. The pile can be possessed high bearing capacity because of being screwed in with lateral soil displacement. 21 vertical loading tests, in which a new measuring system for axial strain of the pile was devised, were performed to evaluate the bearing capacity of these piles in various fields. A convenient bearing capacity formula, which is considered as a sum of end bearing capacity of the <b>pile</b> <b>tip</b> and four wings, is proposed based on the test results...|$|E
40|$|Mechanism {{of point}} {{resistance}} of pile in sand was investigated {{mainly from the}} viewpoint of the particle-crushing of sand at the <b>pile</b> <b>tip.</b> It is shown that the work dissipated in the particle-crushing of sand is as large as 66 percent of the total work done by the external force, hence the point resistance of a pile in sand greatly depends on the particle-crushing property of the sand. It is also shown that the relationship between point resistance and vertical pressure of a pile can be predicted from the triaxial compression tests in a particle-crushing region...|$|E
40|$|Day by day {{competition}} is increasing for surface space, to fulfil {{the objective of}} sustainable development, use of subsurface space becomes very important. Underground structures being difficult and uneconomical to construct were restricted to only special structures like tunnels, hydropower stations, railway platforms, defence purpose buildings and mining. But presently, in a increasing number of cases, public buildings are also being built underground {{in some of the}} metro cities for many reasons, most common reason being effective use of land and location. Construction of underground multi-storey building is provided with pile foundation. But in future, this pile foundation, being at large depths, may get affected by newly built tunnel passing close to it. This project mainly deals with analysis of pile foundation of building under the influence of tunnel with the use of finite element analysis software PLAXIS 3 D. For analysis purpose, a fully developed model was made and simulated for various positions and diameters of tunnel with respect to foundation of building. Results were analysed to find changes in the behaviour pile foundation in terms of total displacement. After thorough analysis of results of simulation, it was found that pile foundation of building is influenced by tunnel only when tunnel is in very close vicinity of pile and its influence is negligible if located far away from the structure. The distribution of internal forces induced by tunnel depend on the position of the pile with respect to the tunnel horizontal axis. The critical position of tunnel corresponds to <b>pile</b> with a <b>tip</b> just below of the tunnel. When tunnel is located at various depths, the variation of total displacement with depth of pile depends upon position of tunnel and the <b>tip</b> of <b>pile.</b> The diameter of tunnel also has small influence on displacement of pile. Displacement of pile is also influenced by diameter of tunnel to a small extent...|$|R

The ultimate axial load capacity of a single pile is generally accepted to be the total skin friction force between the soil and the <b>pile</b> plus the <b>tip</b> capacity of the pile, which are dependent on the subsurface conditions. The ultimate axial capacity of individual friction piles depends primarily upon the type of soil: soft clay, stiff clay, sand, or stratified soil layers. In soil deposits that contain layers of varying stiffness, the ultimate axial pile capacity cannot be equal to {{the sum of the}} peak strength of all the materials in contact with the pile because the peak strengths are not reached simultaneously. Failure is likely to be progressive. The existence of boulders or cobbles within foundation layers can present driving problems and hinder determination of ultimate axial capacity of a single pile. 2 - 9. Pile Instrumentation. Pile instrumentation can be delineated into three categories: instrumentation used during pile load tests to obtain design 2 - 8 15 Jan 91 data, pile driving analyzer used to control quality of pile installation, and permanent instrumentation used to gather info [...] ...|$|R
40|$|In 1920 Prandtl {{published}} an analytical {{solution for the}} bearing capacity of a centric loaded strip footing on a weightless in-finite half-space, based on a so-called Prandtl-wedge failure mechanism. Reissner extended this solution for a surrounding surcharge and Keverling Buisman and Terzaghi for the soil weight. Meyerhof and other researchers presented correction factors for {{the shape of the}} shallow foundation, which would suggest that, the failure mechanism of circular shallow foundations, is related to the Prandtl-wedge failure mechanism. Meyerhof and Koppejan adapted this Prandtl-wedge failure mechanism also for pile foundations. The numerical calculations made in this article show that the Prandtl-wedge cannot be applied to circular shallow foundations and pile foundations in non-cohesive soils. The failure zone (plastic zone) below a loaded circular plate or <b>pile</b> <b>tip,</b> is far wider and deeper than the Prandtl-wedge. The calculations also show that there is, for these axisymmetric cases, failure {{both in and out of}} the standard x-y plane, but most of the failure is due to out-of-plane (tangential) failure. Therefore, this failure mechanism is different from the Prandtl-wedge failure mechanism. Also interesting are the circular and diagonal thin zones below the plate and around the <b>pile</b> <b>tip,</b> where there is no out-of-plane failure, although there is still in-plane failure. In these thin zones without out-of-plane failure, the tangential (out-of-plane) stresses are relatively high due to large shear strains, formed during previous shearing or sliding of the soil...|$|E
